Actually, to conserve energy you need to make the power requirements
a function of velocity, and then you get into the "velocity relative
to what?" question, and get (as you note) very high power requirements for
even moderate drive velocities.

THe maneuver-drive-decreases-mass thing (reminiscent of E.E. Smith) gets
into all sorts of odd "what happens when you switch it off" questions,
and "what happens when you launch a fighter"and "what happens when you
stick your arm out the window" and "what happens when photons from
enemy lasers enter the field", etc. It\'s possible to make it work, but
it changes the
flavour a lot.

Too bad people were too hidebound/conservative/lazy to keep HEPlaR
(which only bends rather than breaks physical laws...) 

(Although even there the problem just changes scale a little - a million-ton
asteroid ship at 50 hexes/turn is still Seriously Bad News.)

One thing we did get into T4 was the Thruster plate limit at ~20 AU,
which makes it harder (though not impossible) to get up to really high
velocities.

I certainly did like the write-up for these ships.  Unfortunately because
your ships were incompletely detailed (no picture, no quality, etc.) on
those inadequate starship cards (no blanks for price, fuel tankage, and so
on)they seem misplaced in the Basic Campaigns chapter.  The ships would have
been better off included with the Imperial Squadrons Campaigns chapter, the
role playing part of the book.  Now, regarding the rest of Imperial
Squadrons.  The Basic Campaigns, a rehash of Trillion Credit Squadron, is
fairly useless, with the exception of Douglas\'s ships, due to the omission
of any way to resolve combat between squadrons.  Kind of pointless to build
squadrons to fight each other if there is no way for them to fight.
Fortunately that one chapter contained most of the problems that I have with
"Imperial Squadron".  The rest of seem quite good.  Having read through much
the Advance Campaigns chapters, it appears to be a good solid set of rules
for strategic level interstellar combat based on the old classic Fifth
Frontier War boardgame.  so far I have only skimmed the final part of the
Imperial Squadrons Campaigns which deals with role playing in the Imperial
Navy.  However, this section seem to be very good, filled with campaign and
adventure ideas as well as other useful information such starship command
structures from the Captain down to the Galley Hands and Military Justice.
Over all despite the failing of the first chapter (which is only 8 printed
pages) the Imperial Squadrons is a very good supplement.

I not so sure it\'s a good idea to be using too many of the jokes and/or 20th
century references in Traveller products, after all you do recall how some
people "loved" "Aliens of the Rim" for just this reason 8^)
(and no I didn\'t get the joke, unless its just a combination of bass akwards

Sounds like a good idea. I have always felt there was a technological
drought betweens tech levels 12 to 15. Every TL up to 12 has lots of neat
breakthroughs like computers, fusion, jump drive, gravitics, meson weapons,
and so on. But after TL 12 there just seem refinements of existing
technology.

Can anyone think of some radical new technology, which fits into the
existing Traveler TL progression, that can be introduced? An idea I had was
safe suspended animation. One would have to be suicidal to go into a low
berth the way they are described in Traveller. If safe suspended animation
was available, interstellar travel would become much safer and cheaper for
both crew and passengers. This would have significant social effects
without changing the game background radically.

I would like new technologies introduced into Traveller, and with IG we
have an opportunity for some revisions to be introduced into the game.

Also, in my M:0 campaign there is an unknown TL 14 planet Cleon\'s Imperium
will soon be encountering. I want some totally new and unexpected (even to
previous Traveller players) technology to throw at them.

With the TML down the last few days, I\'ve had a lot of idle time on my
hands -- thus offering the ideal playground.

I found a box full of discarded lucite sheeting in all different shapes,
and immediately recognized an opportunity to simulate the recoil of
pelvic-mounted projectile weaponry (e.g. the PMPP).  A bunch of scrap foam
rubber, a roll of duct tape and an old dildo harness provided basic
instrumentation; the kinetic energy was produced by an appalled but
fundamentally amenable jock.

Design-wise, I found that centering the impact right at the pubic bone is
the best way to go.  The supporting plates work best when extended sideways
and slightly up the torso, to distribute the force into the front flanges
of the hipbones and not into your viscera. A broad U or V-shaped
configuration seems optimum.

I had the recoil mechanism (an amateur competitive boxer) punch me in the
shoulder and butt of the hand (with arm fully extended) and then on the
proto-pelvic mount with as closely equal amounts of strength as she could
manage.  I have pretty limited experience firing guns myself, but it seemed
that the rough equivalents of medium-power handguns (9mm, .357 magnum) were
almost negligible on the pelvis.  The trick is bracing right and not
flinching or overcompensating -- not really much different than firing from
the hand, I guess.  On the higher end of the impact scale, the kinetic
energy provider refused to punch me as hard in the upper body as in the
crotch -- what else is new? -- but the strongest blows were still pretty
well minimized by the rig.  They did, however, make me sway a bit; clearly
not something you could do "on the run" without losing your balance and
footing.  Afterwards, I was a little sore but unbruised; better-quality
padding would be a big help.

This is definitely a feasible technology for even fairly high-recoil
weapons, and, I suspect, even for use by bipeds with (grossly) external
genitalia.  Why the hell hasn\'t anyone worked on developing this before???
If any members of the TML (preferrably physiologically male and/or more
experienced judges of firearm recoil) would volunteer as test subjects,
perhaps we could further extend the frontiers of Science.

This all depends on the type of interface you are postulating.  I see
three primary varieties: 

1) You receive information (the population of X country, the value of Y
resistor... + full sensory impressions and you access the computer using
conscious thought [what is the population of X country?  What is the
answer to Y equation].  In this type of interface the character might
receive bonuses to Edu skills, but actual skills cannot be gained through
the interface because all you are getting is data.  I\'d say you must have
at least skill level 1 and you can get no more that +2 to the skill. 

2) Full sensory output + the connection works like memory.  Thinking about
a topic will provide you with information from the computer just like
thinking about a topic now provides you with information from your own
memory.  This type of interface will provide the user with nearly
unlimited knowledge skills (in Traveller terms, any skill based off of
Edu).  Depending upon just how unconscious the interface is Int-based
skills could also be included, but you could equally say that only
Edu-based skills can be gained in this way.  It seems quite reasonable
that only skills which depend more upon learning than upon innate
intelligence (essentially any skill you can learn purely in a classroom
w/o lab time or any working with your hands:  history, genetics...).  If
you try to access any skills which require actual practice then you are in
the same situation as someone who has taken several courses on the
subject, but has never used this knowledge.  All the medical
book-knowledge in the work is only going to help you so much in actually
performing surgery. 

3) Your mind and the computer are one.  As long as your body is in the
proper physical shape you can receive *any* skill, whether mental or
physical from the computer.  I\'d avoid this option as too powerful and
*way* too odd. 

We currently have no idea which of these is more likely to happen in real
life.  1 is certain to be possible, 2 & 3 *may* be possible, but they may
not be.  If you stay aware from option 3 you are not dealing with actual
intelligence enhancement and the game should be manageable.  Option 1
should cause no problems what-so-ever, and can be used if the GM want to
be conservative. 

My problem with Traveller is it doesn\'t even include 1 as an option except
for TL 14 computer implants which cost as much as a small starship. 
Type 1 interfaces will be *cheap* and are likely to exist in our 
world within a decade or two.

True, but if someone is careful (and careful villains are more fun) they
can still have secret meetings and secret files (especially if the files
are stored on a computer with no connections to external networks).
Challenging adventures are still quite possible.

More information available does not equal smarter.  If the interface
requires conscious thought then the PC\'s aren\'t necessarily smarter, they
just have huge masses of data available instantly.  If you have an
unconscious interface then, yes, the PCs are effectively smarter. I\'d
avoid the later possibility.

 I archive the digests on my own local drive as I get them. I have the
TML Digests originally numbered 2147-2149 and 2151-2154. 2150 was
apparently damaged in transit, and it was my attempt to get it from
the ftp site that told me that mpgn was down. If you want the ones I
have for the archive, Rob, you are more than welcome to them.  The
digests that just went out are numbered over the old ones, however.
Actually, the new 2147 is about two-thirds of the original 2147 and
one-third post-crash (ie. 2155).
  If you can push the numbering up to 2158 or so, confusion might be
reduced.

Cheers,

GypsyComet@aol.com

 PS: To the TML at large. If anyone archives in digest format, I still need
digest 2150 from just before the crash.

 Ok, I think we add this to the test list for the siege engine comp. But I\'ll
need

Use MegaTraveller as a metatag for all page (Mega, CT or TNE alike), 
as MegaTraveller is unlikely to be used in another context.

Categories would include anything with the prefix Trav.
Examples:
TravTech
TravAliens
TravAncients
TravShips
TravWorlds
TravCampaign
TravAdventure

That\'s what the exercise balls are for. Cat\'s confronted with a rodent
inside one get this *really* strange look on their face. And if the
critter isn\'t overly excitable, it will even *enjoy* being a cat toy.
(I had a friend with a gerbil that got put in the exercise ball when
the cat was around. They got along fine.)

But it\'s still possible to build the 1000 km massdriver in the Oort
cloud and boost nickel/iron "rocks" to 1.5% of c. That only takes cheap
fusion power and the Famile Spofulam design team. :-)

On the other hand, they *are* "small" (few ton) rocks.

Well, there\'s a "simpler" way to screw the owner of a system that uses
EEPROMs or EAROMs. Such devices have a limited number of writes.

The later members of the Tandy 1000 line used EEPROMs for storing setup
info. And there *were* cases recorded of system failure due to people
changing the settings too many times!

So you can sabotage the system by merely writing a "virus" that updates
the EEPROM with unusable code and keeps writing it until the EEPROM
won\'t update anymore. Easiest way is to just write something like all
the same byte except for the correct checksum. Then just cycle through
the possible byte values until a read gets the old values.

True. But it might be fun to work out who an "inertialess" drive (even
one less than 100% efficient) would work. After all, the Arisians may
be out there somewhere. :-)

One thing that Smith got "right" was the decision to decouple
gravitational mass (the M in F=GMM/R^2) and inertial mass (the mass
in F=MA). That makes things easier. For one, it means you *do* have to
supply the energy for the change in potential energy as you move around
in various gravity fields.

And as for what\'s left, well, it would seem to work out ok. The classic
case of 100% inertialess has you resuming your original vector at the
point you turn off the drive.

For partial neutralization, I\'m not entirely clear how you\'d work it.
Probably by applying the vector the drive gave your (lowered) mass to
your original vector, both adjusted for the amount of neutralization.

I *think* that\'d be
(Orig_vector*percent_neutralized)+(new_vector*percent_not_neutralized).

This would *definitely* change things.

Sticking your arm out of the field would be messy, as it\'d act like the
drive had been cut... RIPPP! 

Photons entering the field should either be unaffected, or be
refracted. I think we want unaffected for Traveller. For a "Lensman"
type universe, I\'d go for refracted, with the speed *increasing* inside
the field, with 100% giving "infinite" velocity (and thus explaining
how a "free" ship could exceed lightspeed.

But you will.

        \\        /
          \\    /
            \\/  

The above isn\'t all *that* accurate, but with a 90 degree angle, you
lose *half* the possible "sky" until you get to an angle where the
"ray" misses the "facing" radiator.

The radiation pattern is a *hemisphere* at any given point on the
radiator. In the center this works out as a plane wave. but at the
*edges* it doesn\'t.

It turns out that radiators joined at any angle *other* than 180
degrees lose *some* efficiency.

I goofed here. 4 is better than a larger number, and 3 is better than
4, but *2* is the best answer. So you have 4, and only *use* two two on
opposite sides at any given time.

Again, the ridge idea is *less* efficient than a "flat" hull. It may
help to consider the sum of all individual points radiating. You do
this by (in effect) placing a compass set for a given radius at each
point on the surface of the radiator (in cross section) and drawing an
arc. The sum of the arcs is the wave front. The farther out from the
hull you get, the closer the wavefront come to the one you\'d get
*without* the ridges.

I think of virus in a quite other way. I still do not play with it, as my 
group is not in the new era (yet). But I liked the idea to bring one of 
it once into the campaign, not as weapon, but as character.
I think some way further into the new era timeline. What if Virus begins 
to build an own alliance/confederation/imperium? There was the \'mother\' 
type virus, which not fights but protects its crew. (Seems to be a kind 
of LEXX ...) The possibility of virus as NPC (or even PC) could lead to a 
fine plot device, but you must not overuse it ...
I am sure, this would change the fabric of the Traveller Universe quite a 
lot, but the future still is not written.

That\'s how I saw it all the time. It is not logical that a devastating 
lifeform like the Alien evolves to such a high state on a natural way.
It would have destroyed all of its environment long before reaching a 
standard that high. I always supposed it was a weapon created by the 
alien pilot\'s race (or his enemies). That the humans are that good fodder 
for them can be explained that Alien was designed to prey upon a wide 
variety of different life forms. So the humans are not a special form, 
only one of much.

Ok, lets dissect this one a little bit...

A) Macro viruses _DO_ contain executable code, most are merely
content to spread themselves around, but MS Word basic does have the
ability to get out there and mess with the file system. Examples that do
disrupt the \'host\' are rare, for the simple reason that messing with a
Win95 host usually means the standard "nuke and reinstall" response to
virtually any Win95 problem. This means, essentially that the virus
\'kills\' it\'s host before it gets a chance to spread. This is one
reason that most computer viruses actually do damage very rarely, so
as to enable them to spread.

B) ALL computer viruses require \'a very specific application\' to be
installed on the target computer, it\'s called \'the operating system\'.
This is why current computer viruses (with one exception) are OS specific.
There are Mac viruses (37 of them) Unix viruses (two or three), Apple II
viruses (probably the earliest viruses written and released into the wild,
circa 1977 or so), and all the hordes of MS-DOS viruses. There are a few
Windows and Windows95 specific viruses.

Because, by definition, the OS is a program you are running all the time,
in the background, you \'open\' regular viruses just like you open a Word
document, which either invalidates your definition of viruses, by making
them _all_ trojans (you have to execute code to have them function) or
macro viruses are indeed viruses. 

The example I used, of having my system set up to recognize and open word
documents automatically, when encountered in e-mail or web browsing makes
them essentially, the same as any other computer virus...when encountered
under the right conditions, it automatically infects your system.

Macro virii are the only _non OS specific_ viruses existing, in that they
can infect Word and Excel on both platforms they run on. (ThankYEW Unca\'
Billy...in one fell swoop the virus population that could infect a Mac
went from 37 to thousands...) 

C) They sure as hell replicate themselves!!!! Once you get one on your
system, every document you create or open gets infected with the macro
code. This is how we\'re seeing the main transmission of the virus. Hell,
we got one copy off of a disk that was mailed to us by a national Pharmacy
association.  They sent out dozens, if not hundreds of disks like that.

NIH sends out their grant applications as large, macro driven Word
documents, in one format. I can\'t _wait_ till they send one out with a
macro virus...Word asks now, as of Word97, if you want to open a document
that contains a macro because it might be infected...since you know it
does contain a legitimate macro...

I think, however, at the heart of this argument, is that people have some
picture of computers in Traveller as PC-XT\'s writ large. They are not! 
This makes studying computer viruses today as an example of what Virus is
comparable to studying bear attacks to cope with an Ebola outbreak.

FWEEP FWEEP!  You are penalized for genre crossover violations of the
vilest kind.  "Out of phase" indeed, "Light Sabers" Bah! (spit)...You are
sentanced to 30 minutes in the TML Penalty Box and also to test firing a
Sayat Pelvic Mount Plasma Projector without the customary human protective
devices.

Obviously, the reason that cpaws haven\'t replaced slug weapons in the 3I is
that...they haven\'t.  Not in CSC, Not in the Megatraveller Encyclopedia,
not in Mercenary, not in Smash and Grab.  Whadddaya want?  all of future
history is agin ya?

How obvious can it be?

I would guess that we will see (probably from the trav-tech mailing list
originally) some rule analagous to the TL*50 laser rule to limit PAW size
to a certain minimum.

Of course, the other defense is that particle beams tend to generate some
quantity of nasty radiation when used.  Ah, you counter, but its always
fired from within ABD right?  At any rate, radiation problems will
definitely limit the usefulness of such a weapon.

Would radiated heat be perfectly absorbed?  Even if the fins were not
parallel to one another?  I would expect there to be some "heat loss" even
if two radiating surfaces were facing each other across a small gap and
placed at exactly the same angle, if the gap were large and/or the angle of
seperation greater than 0 but less than 90 degrees I would guess (and I am
guessing) that there would be a greater amopunt of heat actually radiated
and not absorbed.

Meanwhile, lets talk about surface area.  Battle Riders (in CT) were always
of the configuration type "dispersed structure".  I would say that any time
the configuration is an easily visualized shape; wedge, needle, cylinder,
etc, the shape must follow the surface area rules as written.  The use of a
\'dispersed structure\', however, implies that there are projections and
gantries sticking out any which way, making, in the process, airframe or
streamlined hulls an impossibility, but allowing just about any quantity of
surface area one would wish for.

For example, I always wanted to build a ship that was "modular" in nature.
Imagine a long central spine made of tubular construction crystaliron
"gantries" with mounts for a variable number of fuel storage tanks,
habitation modules, cargo containers, and propulsion and/or jump drive
units.  All the structural components are open to space, and if I run fluid
through the center of the tubular elements I have a tremendous amount of
radiating surface area.  I can add jump drive, cargo space, passenger
space, etc at will...as long as certain engineering problems of balance
around the axis of thrust, and jump grid coverage are met...making this the
ultimate in flexible sized starships.  What configuration is this vessel?
How much surface area is there?

Inquiring minds want to know.

The facehugger does seem to work awfully well for a top-down oxy-breathing

    'body' => 'As a test of the FF&S system, I\'ve been trying to recreate some of the
old HG designs - in particular, the Battle Rider/Tender concept. The
problem originated from an analysis of surface area (needed for the
battle rider grapples) - I couldn\'t convince myself that I could design
a BT that could carry a squadron of BRs.

So, I set out to design the Lurenti BT/Nolikian BR tender/rider squadron
found in the "Spinward Marches Campaign" suorce book.

The Nolikian design was doable (I posted the results to TML).

But there is no way to design the Lurenti so that it matches the HG
version (300,000tons - 200x50 ton fighters, 7x20,000 ton riders). There
isn\'t enough area for the riders, and not enough volume for the fighters
(since I assume they\'re carried internal - the idea of 200 external
fighters seems silly to me).

For the record, here\'s the HG stats

CB-T7425J4-099909-99999-200   MCr23.056   300,000tons
            Y   9 KKKKZ                         TL=15

Passengers=0. Low=1,000. Cargo=500. Fuel=75,000. EP=15,000.
Agility=1. Troops=100. 200 Fighters. 7 Battle Riders.

I can\'t seem to get it to work.

I think we need to come up with some rules for pylons or struts for
external features like Battle Riders.

Strangely, the Main Server in my city went down nearly on the same weekend.
As I heard of another TML member, in his city a similar event happened, too.
Is it possible that the posting of too much virus articles created one?

I would prefer TravellerRPG as a metatag. It is generic enough to be
applied to all Traveller Role-playing forms (even GURPS ;) ) but
specific enough that it wouldn\'t be confused with sites offering free
trips to Maui.

> Categories would include anything with the prefix Trav.

I think tacking a prefix on the categories is unnecessary, if every page
also includes the metatag. You simply search for occurances of *both*
the metatag and the category. For example, if you\'re looking for
deckplans you search for "TravellerRPG" and "deckplans".

Tacking on "Trav" wastes a precious 4 bytes of bandwidth per search
term. ;P

I was reading a book the other night, though I can\'t remember the name 
of it.  Might have been the Gamester Wars...  Anyway, one individual 
started a war by surprise attack.  He had several A\'Shiga assassins take 
a 1,000 ton merchant, come out of jump at speed, and continue 
accelerating straight into the planet....approaching at 0.1 C, I 
believe.  It tore the planet up.  The only way his enemy survived was 
that his bodyguard had been watching the scanners and noticed the 
approaching ship.  He sounded the alarm and piled everyone into the ship 
he had already been warming up due to misgivings about their 
situation...  Even then they were almost destroyed by the shock waves 
and would have died had not another ship arrived and landed on their 
crippled ship.

Should be easy to take a relic merchant (2,000 dtn) and drive it into a 
planet....or wouldn\'t it work that way?

   Now that you mention it...

   Traveller Chronicle is back in the saddle after some down time after a
change in editors.  The latest issue (#13) will be arriving back from the
printers just before Christmas and will begin shipping before the end of the
year.

   If you have articles, adventures, ***artwork***, or other things
Traveller (classic, Mega, TNE, T4, varient) that you would like to see in
print, please e-mail me for details.

I realise that the best place for a bridge is "dead center" of a ship, but
in smaller vessels with only a few decks, that\'s not a problem. On larger
ships, I agree that leaving a path for such an item is not feasible unless
you\'re willing to make some sacrifices to other factors.

Also, the plug is not intended to be a lifeboat for an injured ship. It is
a last ditch effort to save the bridge crew on a ship suffering
catastrophic damage (read: the big kabluey). Pilots in fighters don\'t eject
unless staying in their aircraft is going to kill them. I\'d imagine this
would have similar rules.

occluding a distant object would be fairly negligible, but I am sure I am
wrong in this (because I am so often wrong :-). What about detecting globes
against, say, the background radiation of the universe? Would that work?
How about densitometers? Does a force field prevent a sensor of this sort
from detecting the ship so protected?

2). Is a white globe really black? What I mean is, does it look black?
Surely it isn\'t glowing white (and thus a shining beacon).

   Clearly it was the wrath of Grandfather for my smartass remarks about
Wynona Ryder.  Perhaps it was just a warning shot...so...

   I promise never to discuss any secretions of any kind which might emanate
from Ms. Ryder or any of her characters again.  I promise to do homage at a
Wynona Ryder Web site and beg forgiveness from her image.  I further promise
that I will not mention how good Ms. Weaver looks buffed out and clad in
leather nor will I ever again state that seeing Ms. Weaver in such a state
is a reason to pay double to see any film.

   There, the list should once again function normally.

Regards,

Harold

Only metaphorically speaking since the GURPS version deals with an
alternative Classic-Era universe in which Strephon\'s ceremonial double was
not assassinated.

Hey, I live *in* San Francisco, and can\'t afford Arisia if I\'m going to
GenCon next summer.

Which brings up a question.. how many of us are planning on being at GenCon
98?  It\'d be nice to be able to start arraigning get togethers and shared

    'body' => 'Hello all,

The demise of JTAS got me thinking again about a long standing dream of
publishing gaming supplements.

I have been putting together some rough plans for what the cash flow should
be for a gaming company, run under slightly different assumptions than the
norm, and I am soliciting the list for information on what it takes to get
good authors.

There are really three major categories of expenses: overhead, printing,
and content creation.  I can get pretty good numbers on overhead by looking
about the office here, and by judicious references.  I can also get good
numbers on printing from a local graphic artist.  She has given me some
reasonable numbers for quantity 100, 500, 100, and 5000, perfect bound 24,
48, 96, and 130 page books from camera ready art.

This leaves one problem - the content.  I can write a fair piece, but it
seems clear to me that a company that depends on its own internal resources
is going to have to be very quick, or have a large backlog of material
before going to press that first year.  If they use outside authors with a
decent writer\'s guide, then they can publish as many documents as they have
the resources to, or as few.

So, on this list are some of the best authors in the gaming industry.  I
would like to solicit, publicly or privately, rough guidelines for what you
expect to be paid, and how.

Here is how I imagine things working:

Assume the authors are responsible for turning in content digitally, in an
agreed common form, they will get final proofs, and some reasonable amount
of cash is set aside to pay the original author to fix any resulting errors.

So, what would you [a prototypical author] charge to write the following
kinds of books:

1.  A 24 page small supplement.  Rules heavy
2.  A 48 page adventure or backgrounder
3.  A 96 page campaign sourcebook, including rules, adventures, and examples
4.  A 128 page major rule book

How does the idea of a residual change the picture?

Are you willing to revisit a book six months later, if you are paid to do
so, to update it in light of user feedback?

Yeah, I was a bit shocked when I saw what the ships had been reduced to
myself.  Never fear, as I find and update the designs, I\'ll post them here
for your amusement.

The ship names, and how I got them.

The Coronation.  I wanted something "Imperial" for the leading Battleship,
and decided on a series of names based around the trappings of Royalty.
Other ships of the class could be Sceptre, Crown, Throne, Ascension, etc.

David R. Turner Fleet Carrier.  Named after a friend of mine who always
seems to have some sort of cold, which he gives to me.  He\'s a carrier, you
see...

Jerome Garcia Armored Cruiser.  Named for Jerry Garcia, of the Grateful
Dead.  my working name for this was the Fat Man, which was what we called
Jerry, so it stuck.

Bass Straight DE.  The big clue is the second ship named (the Gulf Breeze)
and the fact that they are named for early Terran Vilani contacts in the
First Interstellar war period.

1) First, there\'s Traveller Chronicle - which I haven\'t seen 
recently, a very high-qualtity semi-prozine.

2) Frankly, I expect there to be a lot of GURPS: Traveller articles 
in Pyramid.

Perhaps some of the more \'vocal\' posters might consider doing up 
articles for Pyramid and Shadis.

Yep.  And that does not bother me at all, because once you have cheap
power, planets get kind of fragile.  As long as the average player does not
have these resources, I am happy.

(Consider - to build such a thing in the Oort cloud takes a lot of time,
and would be detected by most planetary sensors.  This means is may be
balanced enough for use.)

Ah!  Okay, I get it now.  Thanks for the physics lesson.  I don\'t know
that much about thermodynamics (just a little applied math).  So we really
do need a relatively flat or convex surface for radiators.

Got it.  Ridges are a *bad* idea -- they cost money, add mass, and don\'t
gain you anything for any particular application. 

The other "fudge" convolutions (narrowing, elongation, flattening of the
cross-section) still have application here, though.

I\'m going to carry on this thread in my reply to Andrew Akins\' post.

I would have to defer to our resident sensor guru to confirm this, but
my intuition tells me you would need to be exceedingly close to a
\'globed ship to notice it against background radiation. Wouldn\'t the
radiation "bend" around it, in front of it? If not, wouldn\'t there be
all kinds of "holes" from other "dark matter" in space? (deep space
asteroids, rogue comets, etc.)

As for densitomiters, I guess it depends on how you theorize that they
work. If they work by some graviton emission or somesuch, they could be
absorbed by the Black Globe.

It\'s my understanding that white globes allow energy to escape, but
don\'t allow energy to enter. Therefore passive sensors should be able to
pick them up. I don\'t think they shine, they just emit the regular
radiation of the ship.

It seems to me, though, that they can be swiched to "Black Globe" mode,
if desired.

I would rule a misjump. Perhaps even catastrophic. Rationale: the black
globe absorbs the energy of the protective jumpspace field surrounding
the ship, making it impossible to remain in jumpspace.

Creative Ref\'s might use this as a rare, high tech and highly risky
method of circumventing the one week jump time limit. :-)

I tried some time ago to reverse engineer the heavy tenders in Battle
Rider (under FFS1).  I\'m sure that I wasn\'t the first, but I encountered
the same problem.  Leonard Erickson raised some good points in the thread
for the "Behemoth" class.  Clearly, it is mathematically possible for us
to increase the surface area of any volume to an unlimited degree by
adding convolutions to the surface.  However, it is limited by structural
integrity requirements, and depending on the type of convolution, it may
not be useful surface area for all types of installations.  For example
(as Leonard pointed out), radiators need convex or flat surfaces facing
into space with no other hull forms facing them, and I mentioned before
that weapon and sensor emitters/antennae have similar needs.

Grapples are one type of installation for which we should be able to add
virtually any amount of surface area to the hull.  They don\'t involve
radiated energy of any sort.  Indeed, the illustrations in Battle Rider
seem to indicate that the riders are mounted on heavy booms of some type,
and I recall seeing similar illustrations in CT supplements. 

For the purpose of making surface area for installations that don\'t
involve energy emissions, we should allow the designer to add material
volume to the hull.  The radio of total surface area to volume should not
be allowed to exceed that of a small ship, to insure some modicum of
structural integrity.  Any suggestions on the limit? 

I think you will find that even this does not solve the battle tender
problem.  ;-)

There should also be a rule allowing extra surface area for systems that
emit energy, but it should be more limited than the previous rule.  The
limit could be based on a volume to surface area ratio (much less than the
above), or a maximum percentage increase.  The allowable increase should
be different for each configuration.  I\'m not ready to suggest which type
of rule (ratio or percent) should be used at this point.  I\'d rather wait
for feedback, because I don\'t know everything.  Again, this type of area
has to be more limited because it must be flat or convex, with as much
open space in front of it as possible.

Note that neither of these rules *have* to stipulate what geometric form
the convolutions take.  There are an infinite variety of such forms, for
any type of installation.  So we can avoid a lot of complex, specific
rules (like one for towers, one for elongation, one for flattening the
cross-section, etc.).

Has this topic been discussed on the list before?

I\'m not a member of the trav-tech list, so I doubt that this message will
reach them (trying anyway).  If someone wants to forward it, that\'s fine
with me.

Thanks for listening.

"LASER PROPULSION RESEARCH FOR SPACE LAUNCH OF MICROSATELLITES


October 29, 1997

EDWARDS AFB CALIF ---- The futuristic concept of a small laser-propelled
spacecraft has taken its first research flights
towards reaching space.

That progress has been measured by short flights of 2-20 seconds duration
at a military research facility using a high power
infrared (CO2) laser, a wavelength invisible to the naked eye. 

The achievement can be likened to Robert Goddard\'s first successful
flights of his liquid propellant chemical rocket that
attained a height of 41 feet after a 2 1/2 second burn in March of 1926.
In sharp contrast with Goddard\'s rockets, there is
absolutely no fuel on board this prototype laser-boosted craft, which has
a diameter of 15 cm, mass of 40-50 grams,
machined from a solid block of 6061-T6 aluminum."

The press release goes on to describe that the thing is powered by
\'kilojoule\' pulses at 10 pulses/second (that\'s what, 600 ROF in Trav
Terms?) turning air in the center of a parabolic reflector into high temp
plasma, the expansion of which drives the craft forwards.

They claim this is pollution free (I\'d really not think about the
recombination products and other side reactions that will occur in the air
as the plasma cools, reforms back onto atoms and molecules.)

Oh, yeah...don\'t cross the beams, either!

Virtual machines (like the JVM, which is also being developed into an OS) 
are also platform-independent.  That\'s where all those holes in Netscape
and IE come from.  As software technology continues to advance, the number
and variety of virtual machines will continue to increase without bound. 
This is a significant danger, because most people won\'t even be cognizant
of the fact that they are running their software on a virtual machine, and
most anti-virus software doesn\'t target virtual machine code.  This is
likely to change in the future, but VMs add another layer of complexity to
the technology and the race will just get harder (i.e. require more outlay
of capital to effectively combat).

In 3I, with reconfigurable CPU pathways (although apparently still a
binary logic), you have the possibility of a dynamic VM loaded into the
hardware from secondary storage.  (Regardless of TL, it is quite probable
that there will always be the distinctions of primary storage, secondary
storage, and processing hardware).  If it is only software complexity that
limits the ability to produce AI, then it would be possible to create an
AI on lower TL hardware using this technique.  Since they did create AIs
on lower TL hardware, we might assume that this is the case.

I don\'t think it\'s completely negligible - but it will fall off pretty
quickly with range. A 1000-m black globe moving at 100 km/sec will
sweep out 20 square arcsecond per second or 10 square arcminutes per 
30-minute turn; there\'s certainly going to be a 15th magnitude star in 
that much area, which is around the threshold where a typical starship
sensor will be able to detect the blinking-out in the short time
available. Of course, there will be dozens of stars blinking out each turn
due to occultations due to Oort-cloud and Kuiper-belt comets...I can\'t think
of an easy way to distinguish one from another.
(Event duration and profile, maybe - the Oort objects are essentially
stationary.)
Of course it gets much harder to be detected if you\'re further away
and moving more slowly. 

>What about detecting globes
>against, say, the background radiation of the universe?
The 3K background radiation is too long-wavelength for this to work well; 
even my huge starship sensors won\'t resolve a fluctuation due to a 
1000-m object at 1 million km.

(Though I should check the math.)

What you will see is the starship against the local background - the 
zodiacal dust, which scatters sunlight and emits thermal IR. Again, I\'d have
to do the numbers, but I think for a typical scanner this becomes practical
at tens or hundreds of thousands of km. (Maybe less.) If there is much
interest (how many people are playing TL-15?) I\'ll try and simulate this for
the next Definitive Sensor Rules.

Grav sensors/densitometers would definitely work - black globes don\'t
block gravity. There are rules for this in the DSR. It\'s an open question
whether they block neutrinos - as presented in TNE they wouldn\'t, but I 
don\'t know what the current technobabble is.

>2). Is a white globe really black? What I mean is, does it look black?
If you want you can always run it as a black globe (completely absorbing.)
In its radiating mode, it\'d actually be very dull red - radiating all the
waste heat that would have been radiated by the radiators on the ship\'s
hull, over a larger surface area and more omnidirectionally. Add 0.5 to 
ship\'s passive signature.

By what Leonard wrote, if some section of the hemisphere visible from a
point on the radiated surface was open space, then a portion of the
radiated heat corresponding to that section (its size and location) would
be lost.  My intuition suggests that more heat gets radiated at the normal
angle to the radiating plane than at angles almost parallel to the plane,
but then again, I\'m no physicist.

I\'d allow some leeway on this one (see my other post on the Battle Tender
thread).  You can always flatten, elongate, and/or widen the basic volume,
which will increase its surface area, as well as add little (or big) fins,
wings, knobby projections, superstructures, and so on.  I think that the
published surface area requirements are minimums, not maximums.  After
all, that extra mass is a big limiting factor that a lot of small ship
designers would love to get rid of.

Yes, for the dispersed structure, I agree on having no upper bound, not
even for the energy emitter/receiver installations.  I think that there
may even have been a somewhat "official" note to this effect published
somewhere (in a TNE supplement).  I don\'t have FFS2.  Does it say anything
about this?

By my new understanding of the matter, only if they\'re exposed to space
(not just vacuum, but *space*).  If modules are attached, they won\'t be
useful, but then again, you can radiate from the modules.  Are conduit
couplings a standard feature of external grapples?

Dispersed structure.  I refer you to the Maggart class from TNE.  This is
exactly the kind of ship you are talking about.  There was a long central
section with a spinal mount, a command module in the front, an engineering
module in the back, and lots of custom modules attached to the spine.  GDW
did quite a job on that ship.  Does anyone remember the name of the
supplement where they gave about 10,000 modules for it?  Smash & Grab? 
They also introduced the Aurora in the main rulebook, which the Maggart
was a "stretched" version of. 

> How much surface area is there?

As per dispersed structure.  Modules attach to external grapples.  I don\'t
know about stickying a jump drive in a module.  The really icky problem
(in TNE, at least) is working out those firing arcs when you go and add
those laser modules.  They did it for us in the supplement, and a referee
can fudge it, but I\'d hate to work out solid rules for competitive design
among players.

I was doing the Aslan fonts, but my finals came up, and I had to spend all
kinds of crazy time in the lab, and...  blah blah blah.

Basically, right now, I have become really, really busy, especially with
Christmas coming up.  Expect nothing from me on the Aslan fonts until some
time a bit after Christmas at the earliest.  Sorry if anyone was waiting with

Arrival Vengeance cast the characters as the senior crew aboard the AV,

Again, I have to correct my own language -- sorry about that.  I should
have said something like, "I don\'t know about putting a jump drive in a
module".  If there are a set of standard conduit hookups for a grapple, I
doubt that they include a heavy fuel line (the jump drive sucks up a lot
of fuel *very fast*, if I\'m not mistaken) and jump grid connections. 
These would have to be added; I can\'t guess the costs (if any).  It should
be possible; a grapple would have to be designated as capable of accepting
a jump drive module.

I\'d say that they\'d be like very large external grapples (like the ones for
small craft). I\'d say you could proportionally scale up the stats to deal
with larger craft.

<big snip>

My feelings on this are that the goals of anybody who is entering
this field of endeavor out of a "love for the hobby" rather than
a "love for money" would do well to contentrate on keeping costs
minimized while keeping distribution as wide as possible. How do
you do that? The solution is right in front of you... it\'s the
internet.

The overhead is your computer and net-connection... these are sunk
costs that you\'ve already paid, so you might as well forget about
them. The printing is... well... non-existant.

As for content creation, my personal solution has always been to
scrouge for free material (there are a lot of folks out there who
have stuff they\'ve already written which they\'d let you publish
for free). As for keeping distribution as wide as possible, that\'s
easy: make your product free of charge and put in online for
everyone to download.

These are good questions, but again, you really have to ask yourself if
you want to go "pro". Being ametuer has lots of additional advantages aside
from just the cost and distribution ones mentioned above:

#1 Money never gets in the way.
   
   Look how some game companies turn out inadequtely edited product
   because they need immediate cash flow.

#2 Any mistake can be immediately fixed.

   Mistakes always happen, no matter how much your proofread. But on
   the net, you never have to recall a product. Just upload the new
   version.

#3 Electronic product is ultimately more valuable.
   
   Because paper rips, smudges, and rots... furthermore, paper isn\'t
   electronically searchable... furthermore, paper takes up space...
   furthermore, you can never find the darn stuff in the first place...
   furthermore, you\'ll probably lose it when you\'re moving...
   furthermore, if you want a copy at home and a copy at your friend\'s
   place (where you sit down to game), then you need to buy him (or her)
   a copy as well... yada yada yada. Can you tell that I hate paper?

A few hints if you actually take my advice:

#1 Keep the data format as portable as possible.

   I used to run a fanzine called the "Guildsman" back when I was in
   college. We put out six issues of the zine (ranging from 50-150 pages
   each) in a little under two years, and each run was around 50 copies
   (they were sold locally). Cost of production was about $6/issue. I
   used LaTeX on the campus net to do the formatting. Horrible idea.
   Now I\'ve got all these LaTeX-formatted files, and nobody reads LaTeX
   anymore. If I want to share them with gamers on the net, I have to
   weed out all the LaTeX formatting commands (pain in my a**). What I
   should have done in the first place was make the zine pure vanilla
   text and just distributed electronically.

#2 Don\'t solicit for submissions.

   Netters are flaky... gamers are even flakier... and net-gamers are
   the ultimate flakes. If you want submissions, just take them from the
   newsgroups and/or mailing lists, ask for permission to publish, and
   then roll with it. 99% of the time, the response will be "sure, go
   ahead." Just beware of that 1% (out of all the people I asked for
   permission to publish, only one said, "No, don\'t." I think he was
   trying to go "pro" or something... don\'t think he ever made it,
   either).

And finally one big hint if you don\'t take my advice:

A friend of mine on the net puts out a gaming fanzine in his spare-time.
He publishes on paper, not electrons. His promise to his readership is
that their copies of his zine will retain their "collector\'s value"
because he will never re-print. To ensure this, he erases the electronic
copy of each issue right after it goes to press. My question to you:
who does this serve... those with a "love for the hobby" or those who
have a much less interesting love, the "love for money"?

Always side with those who love the hobby... work this motivation into
your every strategic decision, and as long as use that as your basis,
you\'ll do just fine.

masses eight thousand kiiilos.

Weeee couldnt agreeeee on what sort of poooower plant, so weeeee figured
that youuuu can figure that out.

I wanted batteries, coz that naaasty Mr Zhuuuuunatsu doesnt like our Baby
PAW and wont let us give them to those niiiiiice Sayat ladies.

But maaaaar-keting said they wanted us to use fusion plus. Icky.

Weeeee then put a forty kiiilo ballistic computer on it, and and and a two
hunnnered kiiilo Indirect Fire Sight and and and a Fire Direction Center.
They cost one million seven hunnerd and two thousand credits.

Plus you neeed a place to siddown on it, so thats point two tons and a
kiiilocredit for a crooooostation.

Weeee reckon that lets us go zappity zap zap zap at annnnyyything within
siiiixty klicks, as soon as someone tells us where it is. Even if they\'re
behind armour or a mountain or anyything.

The meeeesons should go for four thousand kiloooometers, until they run out
of weeeeet-bix.

All up it weighs eight thousand eight hunnerd and thirty-five kiiilos, and
costs one point seven four nine megacredits.

Once you put a carrriage on it, it weighs seventeen point four seven tons,
and costs 
one point seven six five megacredits.

An an an member thats without power. It neeeeeds eighty megawatts an hour
for sustained fire.

Weeee reckon you should hide it inna mountain or somefing, and then go
zappity zap zap zap at anything that you get told is within sixty click.

Your loving cousin,

**************************************************************

Personally, I think that this TL12 design is an abomination in the sight of
God and Man.

Apart form making life impossible for grav tanks, it is also one hell of a
weapon to turn any freighter into a Q-ship.

Remember, you have a zero-second delay, counterfire-proof, speed of light
artillery weapon *at TL 12*. And I\'m sure I could build a TL11 version.

If your name happens to be Marc Miller, please say that Meson Guns have a
minimum length of, say, fifty meters at TL11, reducing by 10 meters per
tech level. Otherwise, really really strange things will happen to Imperial
Military doctrine - especially Marine doctrine.

With Marines in battle dress costing in the hundred kilo-credit range, it
is worth using a Solution to skeet-shoot them individually.

Marines will also abandon the Fusion Gun for their new role as artillery
spotters. Forget Combat Rifleman or FGMP skill - Forward Observer will be
standard for Marines.

	Hm.  I always thought it was never let the players have characters
wierder/eviller than the bad guys.  But on reflection, I agree.  So:

Rule 1) Never make it too easy to destroy the universe.

Rule 2) Never let the players have characters wierder or more evil than the
bad guys.

Rule 3) ???

Sooo, on a not so related note ... what would happen if we turned on the
force field on a 0.1 c, Virus-infected planetoid in jump transit while
amidst the inhuman drums and pipes of Azathoth\'s court (which, as we all
know, is what jump space really is and why you can\'t look at it without
coming down with a really severe case of Tourette\'s disorder) while being
chased by non-existent space pirates ("argh-matey!") riding jump torpedos
bareback, each brandishing PMPPs menacingly. (I really think it ought to be
PelvIc, to get PIMPP)

Actually, the blackglobe\'s capacitors would absorb all the energy from the
jumpfield and collapse it. I think two things then occur. 1 the capacitors
blow not be able to absorb all the energy in a jump field. This does bad
things to a ship. 2. the ship or rather what is left of the ship is in
jumpspace with nothing to protect it. This also does bad things to a ship
or rather what is left of a ship.

I would say essentially this to the players. Well guys that was a real
interesting way to waste a lot of money. Want to roll up some new
characters now or wait to next game session?

Question 2 does the universe end? certainly not. Jumpspace is not is the

In High Guard it would be a \'close structure\'. Table 160 in FFS2 has this

Two reasons.

1. The phallic symbology of a weapon projecting from the crotch is just
   *too* much.
2. you can\'t fire it from behind cover. Your entire torso *and* head
   are out there as a target. Compare this to a handgun or longarm,
   where you only have to expose your head.

If IG cannot make a go of publishing the Journal, then how close to the wall are
they for the rest of their business?

It doesn\'t look good -- they have to rush incompletely (or *never*) proof-read
products into production because they haven\'t the Time (and time = money) to do
the job properly. They have *never* been able to produce a quality product that
is proof-read adequately (and, in fact, the situation seems to be getting worse
with some of the recent efforts like FF&S#2). They make promise after promise
about T4.1 (now for a post Xmas release, I guess), but we see nothing (and, yes,
unless they stuffed up my order, I have one in for it ... if it ever sees the
light of day). They cut ties with the only designer that seems to have had a
consistent, realistic, and logical "clue" ... Greg Porter.

All the anecdotes we\'ve heard, all the evidence we\'ve seen, seems to be quite
definite that IG is seriously undercapitalised -- so is it really surprising
that JTAS has been dumped?

What I\'m saying is, today, JTAS ... tomorrow T4.1? Next week ... IG?

I\'ve also said that the best hope for Traveller surviving is obviously for
someone other than IG to do it ... which means GURPSTrav. Now, don\'t get me
wrong, I\'m not saying that GURPS is a wonderful and completely flawless system
- -- it isn\'t. It has problems -- problems that will *perhaps* make GURPSTrav
difficult to do. However, it has one big plus ... SJG is run by guys who
actually *have a clue*, they\'ve demonstrated this over the years. They produce
consistently professional product that, if not always innovative or state of the
art (but, then T4 wasn\'t, either), are well produced and, well, *professional*.

They also get product out on deadline (mostly ... don\'t mention In Nomine or,
worse, Hot Lead), too. And they have a website that keeps the fen updated on all
the relevant doings.

So, is IG going down the gurgler? The signs sure seem to indicate that they are
having (and have always had) major problems. So, perhaps, a tentative "yes"
(IMHO). Will they survive against a competent competitor? Again, a tentative
"no" ... or not for long.

I know that many on the list will violently disagree ... but I\'m merely pointing
out what seem to be unpalatable facts. The problem is, perhaps you should shoot
the originator of the problems (IG) and not the messenger (me).

I don\'t know what can be done to save them ... I don\'t even know that they\'re
*worth* saving. One solution that\'s been tried is for people on this list to
actually write good stuff for them ... and they have. Unfortunately, the people
at IG have always managed to stuff it up with the greatest of ease!

So, what *can* be done to save them? Any ideas?

Or, equally, are they worth saving? Any ideas?

As pointed out elsewhere, the problem is that you don\'t have enough
surface area on the tender for the grapples.

I propose a simple solution. Put the grapples on the *rider*, and have
it grapple to a simple reinforced "strut" on the tender. Then the
grapple\'s surface area requirement isn\'t a problem. :-)

But you missed the *key*. Memory. I was assuming memory *transfer*. In
which case you will get the (edited) memories of a practicioner,
complete with sensory impressions. So you\'ll know what the moves should
*feel* like.

If we can implant memory *at all*, we can implant sensory memory just
as easily as "data" memory. And even your "type 1" can supply sensory
info!

Bad news. People were saying that exact same thing *15* years ago. We
are making *very* little progress on interfacing to the brain. We can
interface to motor and some sensory nerves in crude ways (you have to
learn how to "feel" and "move" all over again) and those are cutting
edge experimental technologies.

The trick in such a world will be having a computer with no connections.

If we get it at all, there\'s no reason why an "unconcious" interface
would be any harder than a "concious" one. In fact, I\'ll bet that once
we crack the "code" and can interface to the brain, we\'ll have to put
in a lot of work to *filter out* "unconcious" thoughts.

Basicly, your "concious" interface seems to be more akin to interfacing
to the *sensory* and *motor* nerves, and exchanging data and commands
that way. Among other things, this will have a steep learning curve, as
it\'ll be like learning to use a new "sense" (for input) or a new "limb"
(for output). Doable, but not necessarily easy. It may not be any
harder than learning to use a mouse with a GUI. But that *isn\'t* as
easy as many folks think. I have to *teach* that to people and some
have a *really* hard time picking up the skill.

But a true *brain* interface would be what you call "unconcious". The
impulse occurs, and the computer carries it out. It may be "what if we
did this?" or it might be "Let\'s blow them away *now*." In the former
case, you\'d get a scenario simulation (probably sort of like
"imagining" it happening, only you\'d know what the odds of things
were), in the latter, you\'d get targeting crosshairs and a "Fire? Y/N"
type prompt. :-)

No, even macro viruses are "OS specific". It\'s just that for *them* the
"OS" is Word!

It helps to have experience with non-PC systems. :-) Even the Mac
doesn\'t have much in the way of security. But my first OS, the late
lamented TRSDOS had better security than *netware*. Even better than
Unix, except for the fact that the Z80 didn\'t have a "protected mode".

Multi-OS viruses are *possible*. It\'s just that your typical virus
author isn\'t *really* all that innovative. Consider the Internet Worm.
It attacked *two* different OSes on different *platforms*!

It took advantage of a known software weakness. Namely the fact that
message buffers weren\'t protected against overflow. So it just caused
an overflow where the "extra" characters were executable code that
wound up getting loaded were it\'d do the least good.

I don\'t have a problem with a multi-platform virus. I have a problem
with one that causes *hardware* changes in systems not designed to be
self modifying. And with one that infects via *sensors*. Or can infect
dedicated systems running *ROM* based code.Or can infect systems that
are *designed* to not allow data to become program (such *will* exist,
for security reasons, and there are even computer designs where code
and data are kept *strictly* seperate. It\'s *impossible* to write
self-modifying code on such a system)

And even so, I described how the Virus *could* have done what they
wanted it to do. I was just pissed that the "canon" Virus was described
in a manner that didn\'t make the "reasonable" way possible.

short version of my idea:

The Virus *can* take over transponders. They are both "alive" and the
same "OS". From there, the living chip starts cannibalizing spare
silicon nearby.

It then extends "tendrils" down any connections it has and when it
encounters a chip/system, it studies the signals (and possibly even the
actual chip structure). It then sets up part of itself to "take over"
the functions of the chip, and connects that across the chip\'s I/O,.
Then it disconnects the chip and processes it for raw materials.

Whenever it "assimilates" a complete "card", it can create a simulacrum
to replace the function, and have it hooked to the *card\'s* I/O. Then
it can assimilate the rest of the card *and* reprocess the chip level
simulacra. And given that even in the future, I bet stock "chips" will
be used more than custom ones, the card simulacra will be *simpler*
than the sum of the chip simulacra simply because most designs don\'t
*use* all the functions of the chips making them up.

When the virus has assimilated all the "cards" in a "unit", it can just
place a simulacrum across the *unit\'s* I/O. And again, simplify the
system. Even more, at this level it can likely delete functions it
doesn\'t *want* to support. And again, it spreads tendrils down the
connections to other units. Also, it can remove the simulacra for any
connections it controls both ends of. 

And all the while it can replicate itself in any unit that is big
enough, and network smaller units to at least run a copy "in common".
After a while the only things that *won\'t* be part of it will be the
actual readouts and input devices. It can just display what it wants to
the crew and ignore any instructions it doesn\'t need to pass on to
unassimalated units. In short, the crew is running a *simulation* of
the ship, they just don\'t know it yet. :-)

As it goes along, it\'ll probably wait until it has the power and other
"critical" systems under control before it attacks. At which point
things happen like life support being shut off (or run in ways that are
*worse* than having it off). Anti-hijack systems start attacking the
crew, etc. The weapons may attack any nearby ships that don\'t indicate
(via hidden signals in the transponder codes) that they are infected
and in the process of moving towards a takeover. Heck, it may even
attack them just to keep the crew\'s attention elsewhere.

The key difference between my version and the "canon" version is this:
In the canon version, the virus can infect "any" system simply be
sending code at it. It can even infect through *sensors*. 

In mine, it can infect the Imperial transponders, and they can infect
anything they can get to *physically* (or if you grant the telekinetic
ability that some say the Cymbeline chips have, anything within the
(rather short) TK range. 

This slows the spread of the virus somewhat, and makes it a *bit*
easier to guard against (after all, it can use all that spare silicon
to create "spores" that can be scattered around waiting for a ship to
get close, or to be spread around a planet. Or maybe they\'d be like
fake insects...

One *advantage* of my version is that it makes "taking back" an
infected system hopeless. The virus has *rebuilt* it. And if you kill
the power (and that copy was dumb enough not to have *local* storage of
power) you *still* can\'t restore any of the functions the virus deemed
"unnecessary".

That would help explain why tech crashed so far, so fast.

I *like* my version of the virus. Among other things, it\'s "sneakier".
And just think of the fun if the players get suspicious and open up an
assimilated unit (assuming the virus hasn\'t bothered "welding" the
cover on :-). 

"You get the cover off. The inside doesn\'t look like anything you\'ve
ever seen before. There aren\'t any cards or wires. Instead, what\'s in
there looks almost like a plant root system. Like something that
*grew*. But it\'s metal, plastic and ceramics."

"As you stare, part of it shifts and you are blinded by a bright light...."

(The virus noticed they were opening the case and built some *powerful*
diode lasers. As soon as they were finished, it targeted the players\'
eyes. It *probably* didn\'t waste enough resources to do permanent
damage. But the players will be blind for a few hours. More than long
enough for the virus to have them in deep shit. :-)

Compare that to what you\'d see with the canon Virus:

"You get the cover off. Everything looks normal."

You aren\'t thinking "alien" enough. 

.... It\'s shoved something into my:

exrcretory orifice
feeding orifice
respiratory orifice
reproductive orifice
speaking orifice
brooding pouch
storage pouch
feeding/digestive pouch

And these are just off the top of my head after running thru known
*Terran* organisms.

And with the possible exception of the last, *all* of those are usable
sites for incubating baby bursters.

The odd part about the face huggers is that they can feed oxygen to a
human. Otherwise they are a *poor* copy of digger wasps or Ixitls.

"Aliens" are too nasty for Traveller. On the other hand, I still say
I\'d like to drop Avalon into the Traveller universe somewhere. That\'s
the world from "Legacy of Heriot" and "Beowulf\'s Children".
*Especially, after the second book.

A minor human race with *intelligent* Grendels as part of their armed
forces would make even the K\'kree decide to look elsewhere for places
to conquer. :-)

Hmmm. Let\'s see. We need a cooling suit for the grendels, as well as
some way for the suit to store extra "speed" and feed it to them as
needed...

Grendels in battle dress don\'t bear thinking about. 

Oh yeah. For the *opposite* end of the spectrum I want another planet
somewhere in the reaches of unexplored space.... Discworld!

<snicker> Can you picture the ISS report when they spot *that* in their

Nope, stars are pretty far apart even with a *good* telescope. And a
ship at any great distance obscures a *very* tiny angle.

Not easily. The cosmic background is 3K. A black globe would be 0K.
That\'s an *awfully* tiny differential to detect.

Good question. I don\'t think it\'s ever been cleared up. I\'d tend to say
that gravity (and hence densitometers) is *not* affected by a black
globe. Otherwise it\'d constantly be absorbing a *lot* of energy any
time it was near a planet.

Also, gravity is carried by *virtual* particles, which the globe
shouldn\'t be able to intercept. Real particles can be. This also means
that if the ship has a big enough charge or magnetic field they would
also be detectable. (Don\'t hold your breath waiting for *that* to
happen :-)

But on the other hand a VM of this sort runs a lots *slower* than
native code.

BTW, Computers *don\'t* have to use von Neumann architecture. In other
words "storage" be it primary or secondary *doesn\'t* have to be
*shared* by code and data. Systems have been built where code is stored
seperately* from data at the *hardware* level. 

In such a system you can load anything you want into the data stream
and it won\'t corrupt the code. The code is effectively "in ROM" at all
times. The system just gets to switch between the ROMs. But the code
and data are kept seperate at the *register* level. It\'s not possible
to load an opcode register from the data store or to load an operand
register from the code store.

Developement on such systems is slow (for one thing because you have to
write assemblers/compilers rather differently, and debuggers *have* to
be hardware). But it continues because they have advantages in
applications where you *can\'t* have "viruses" and the like happen. They
are also apparently of some theoretical interest.

The radiation basicly works out to be equivalent to what you\'d get from
a flat plate set across the "trough". Pity.

Actually, the tubes don\'t have all *that* much area. That\'s the whole
reason for *using* tubes. Since the amount of material required is
directly proportional to the *surface area* of the tubes, for the
volume the framework encloses they have very *little* area.

On the other hand, they are a good design. In fact a lot of *real*
spacecraft design proposals amount to a triangular truss (think of the
arm on those cranes they use to build big buildings, or they typical
"tower" for a radio station). Such trusses are *very* strong for their
weight and can take a *lot* of thrust along their axis.

The *effective* surface area will work out to be much the same as you\'d
get if you had an infinitely stretchable balloon, inflated it, slipped
the ship inside, and then deflated the balloon. Any "convex" area will
radiate with it\'s real surface area. Any "concave" area will radiate as
if it had the area of a sheet stretched over it.

Also, it\'s *gotta* drop off in efficiency as the altitude increases. I
still prefer the original Kantrowitz design. A slab of "doped" ice (or
maybe plastic, but ice would be better) fastened to the back of the
vehicle, and the laser vaporizes a layer of the surface with every pulse.

As I understand it, tests at Lawrence Livermore showed that the
resulting "planar shockwaves" *would* provide decent thrust, even
without a nozzle.

I like the idea of "big" laser launch systems for Traveller because
they can double as *great* planetary defense systems. Would *you* get
in range of Gigawatt lasers with a rate of fire *higher* than the the
one in the test above? 

BTW, the "gigawatt" figure is for *cargo*. For launching *passengers
you need bigger lasers.... :-)

Ah.  Oh.  Good point.  I suppose one could argue that anyone who would put
on a PMPP/analogue wouldn\'t be worried about petty scaredy-cat things like
"cover", but yeah, that is a sort of drawback.

Hm... to get back to an earlier suggestion for Sayat anatomy, perhaps a
sort of prehensile version of the PMPP could get around this problem?

Why, the planetoid in question would fragment into its constituent
components (gravitically compressed Templars in a matrix of superdense
Imperial Peers).  Nothing more, nothing less.

PIMPP?  How absurd!  Pimping is an antisocial practice restricted to those
animal species suffering from severe mental illnesses; such as "private
property" and "monetarized exchange".  No, no, that wouldn\'t be appropriate
at all.  Pimping?  Really!  Besides, all Sayat research subjects are
volunteers.  Of course.  Yes.

Lots of adventure hooks. I wish more folios like this were made for =

   There is no rule in the T4 rulebook, because the animal system in T4
   was taken wholesale from CT, which did not vary the target number, but
   modified a 2D attempt to roll an 8 or better.  T4.0 overlooked this
   little omission.  The T4 equivalent to the old CT rule, using a fairly
   obvious conversion scheme, would be to have a target number of 6 with
   a 2-dice task difficulty.

I\'d say real close, I\'m afraid I\'ve got to agree with everything you said.
I had great hopes from the beginning, and have gotten everything they\'ve
done except the "Mileo 0 Campaign" hardback (Why should I waste my money on
simple reprint of two poorly done books), and the second issue they did of
JTAS (I\'ve never been able to find it, and the store that special orders
all the other Traveller books for me can\'t get it!).

Unfortunatly for the most part the stuff is very, very poorly done, I think
they have done 3 books that were produced at an acceptable level.  One
thing they need to do is get someone that has a clue when it comes to page
layout, and use a real program for page layout (I suspect they are using MS
Word).

As for proof-reading, I think that one of the best books they\'ve done is
the "Naval Architects Manual" (what can I say, I love well done starshp
deck plans).  I\'ve not had much time to read it, but the first thing I
noticed was a typo in about the first paragraph!

What I want to see is something produced of the quality of the "Delta
Green" sourcebook for COC, or the "Jovian Chronicles".  Both are excellent
examples of well produced RPG books!

>What I\'m saying is, today, JTAS ... tomorrow T4.1? Next week ... IG?

Maybe not that quick, but that is unfortunatly my guess.  I am suspecting
that a majority of people still buying the stuff are die-hard Traveller
fans like myself that already own a majority of the material produced.

Problems yes, but they just seem to write rules specific to most settings
anyway.  I think GURPS is Travellers only real hope at this point.  One
thing it will do is gain Traveller visibility that it\'s not had in years.
If IG is still around at that point they might have a chance, especially if
they produce stuff that can be used with GURPS Traveller.

The biggest problem I\'ve got with GURPS is I don\'t like the artwork.

I think a lot of companies fail to consider that once they start a Web site
they need to keep updating it with new content.  One like the IG site
doesn\'t have to be that often, but it does need to be more often than
they\'ve been doing!  To do otherwise reflects badly on them.

It\'s IG\'s ability to mess stuff up makes me wonder if they are worth
saving!  Starships is probably the best example of a book gone horribly
wrong.

>So, what *can* be done to save them? Any ideas?

We, can\'t save them.  They have to save themselves.  In order to do this,
they\'ve got to start produceing quality material.  When over 50% of the
material that they\'ve done garbage primarily do to their incompetence
they\'ve got their work cut out for them.

>Or, equally, are they worth saving? Any ideas?

Only if they make themselves worth saving.  For almost a year I\'ve been
threating to tell the store that orders the books for me not to bother any
more, but I keep getting them, because I keep hoping for the best.  The
latest book I\'ve gotten was the "Architects Manual" and I REALLY like what
I\'ve seen of that book so far.  Unfortunatly work has prevented me from
having time to really read through it.

   Hi.

   Nope.  The power requirements are a function of reaction mass and
   thrust, not velocity.  The velocity-relative-to-what issue has come up
   several times on this list, and is usually a red-herring. (The correct
   physics answer is that the velocity can be relative to /anything/, as
   long as the aforementioned anything doesn\'t change halfway through
   the working of the problem.)
   
   The real-life physics formula for power vs. thrust is:
   
      	P = sqrt((Fc)^2 + (rc^2)^2) - rc^2.
   
   Where:
   	c = speed of light = 3.00 * 10^8 m/s
   	P = power in watts
   	F = thrust in newtons
   	r = rate at which reaction fuel is spent in kg/s
   
   If you have no reaction mass, then r=0 and your equation for power
   becomes P = Fc.
   
   Now, if you have some kind of magic M-drive that takes the ship off of
   the mass shell, making it a virtual object, then the formula does not
   hold.  Relativity is violated and the relativistic relation between
   energy and momentum, E = sqrt((pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2), becomes E =
   sqrt((pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 - OSO^2), where p = momentum, E = energy, and
   OSO is the off-shell offset.  In that case, your power-to-thrust relation
   for a reactionless drive becomes:
   
   	P = sqrt(F^2 * c^2 - OSO^2).
   
   The power is now a function of thrust (F) and whatever the magical OSO
   is a function of.  Note that for the High-Guard and Striker rules to hold,
   you\'ll need a formulation of something like OSO = 0.999*F*c.

Well, while at earlier times I might have disagreed with you, I think you
may be right. Although I will point out that magazines are notorious for
not making money. Wizards of the Coast has flat-out said that neither
Dragon nor Dungeon are money-makers, but they consider them important
elements of customer service, and they will continue them. Therein lies my
secondary theory; that "does not fit in with our plans" should really mean
"does not make enough money, therefore we\'re canning it." My first theory,
unfortuately, is the same as yours . 

> What I\'m saying is, today, JTAS ... tomorrow T4.1? Next week ... IG?

At this point, I\'m not even optimistic about T4.1 ever coming out.

There has been some discussion (engendered by me) on the GURPSnet list
lately. I do think Traveller will work well in GURPS, although the
prevalent opinion is that, as much as possible, they want to stick with
GURPS rules for the way things work, not try to rework GURPS to make it
like Traveller. I don\'t have a problem with this, but then I don\'t like
random character creation anyway :) Basically, they want people to be able
to play GURPS Space in the Traveller universe, with adjustments like jump
drives using fuel, etc.

I am going to say this with deep apologies to Marc and to my friends from
the TML who have worked hard and long on the quality material that has been
put out; IG\'s situation is their own making, and this current one is not
inherited from the "old regime". if they go under, it\'s their own fault.
Their business practices are highly suspect at best, and it isn\'t like
they\'ve had ample warning. But what do we know? we\'re just the suckers who
buy anything with "Traveller" on it...(sarcasm, of course). I hate to see
Marc\'s name dragged through the mud. he did his best to bring Traveller
back to the marketplace as fast as he could after the demise of GDW (too
fast IMO, but that\'s just me), and he just wound up getting stuck with what
I consider a raw deal. The problem is with the business folks at the top,
not people like Marc and Tim Brown. And certainly not the fault of people
like Suz, Stu , Joe, Andy etc. who have done what I consider to be some of
the best stuff that has EVER been written for Traveller.

My opinion, of course.

Being relatively new to running a long-term Traveller game, I have created
only a couple of races.  What I do at first is pick a planet that will house
an alien culture (good bets, at least initially, are worlds with very low
Tech, since they\'ll be interdicted and you don\'t have to introduce the race to
the outside world too quickly), then I think of one or two traits that make
the alien race unique.  I\'m a big believer that alien races should not fill a
niche that is already possessed by another Trav race.

I try not to take ideas from movies, television, and books because to me  it
just doesn\'t sit right.  I wouldn\'t want to take alien races out of their
natural habitat.  I mean, isn\'t that against the law or something? :)

....along with several other comments concerning the potential demise of IG,
or even Traveller.

I\'d say that if IG goes belly up, it\'s their own fault, but I don\'t think
that this reflects on Traveller or even the new system (T4, T4.1).

If there\'s a demand, someone will produce it. Look at other games that have
been shuffled from one backer or producer to another. TFG and Star Fleet
Battles have had many different monetary backers. Ars Magica has changed
companies, yet is still in production. Even the mighty AD&D has not been
immune from financial hardships.

I believe that the question should not be "Should we save IG ?" but "How
can we continue to make Traveller a viable, quality game no matter who
holds the purse-strings ?"

We, the demend, hold sway over the supply if we only make ourselves heard.
If the "supply" doesn\'t listen, then they\'ll perish... and some new supply
will start. If anything we need to ensure that the new or old "supply"
lives up to the Traveller legacy.

Actually, there is a reason for this and a fundamental point.
One is allowed suspension on disbelief on a point to set up
a setting.  However, if you continue to demand suspension
of disbelief, esp. without a fundamental motivation, thing
just begin to become hokey.

The FTL drive and reactionless thrusters are necessary to set
up a the kind of interstellar travel necessary for the setting.
This doesn\'t mean you can simply tack on things like teleportation.

No, what will happen is TL 15 Imperial Marines will have man-portable
meson guns more powerful than the one above! When every Marine has a
sure killer like this weapon, everyone of them will have two skills;
Forward Observer and Heavy Weapons. No need for anything else other
than a short range personal weapon for when the enemy is within meson
gun lethal range from some other Marine.

Or you could just withdraw out of range and call in the meson strike
from every other member of the squad....

Back in the August/September region I was inclined to disagree with you when
you made a statement almost exactly the same as this one.  My disagreement was
that FF&S2 was a step up in quality for them, not a step down.  In addition,
they had done a really competent job on both Emperor\'s Arse (as my gaming
group affectionately calls it :) and Central Supply Catalog.

Then, I took a look at Emperor\'s Vehicles.  I liked it more or less, but the
quality was shoddy.  Tech Levels are something that have been in Trav since
late TL7.  They\'ve been a solid part of the Trav universe and flavor...

Then, poof, they\'re not there.

I like to think IG is worth saving, only because without them, then eventually
I\'ll have to deal with GURPs Trav.  I just won\'t have the time to convert the
new source material to the old style.  I hardly have time to keep getting a
new scenario every week for my players, and I\'m not as busy as I will be in
the near future.

The other reason to save IG is that I genuinely like T4.  I thought I wouldn\'t
at the beginning, but it is an amazingly simple and intuitive system (half-
dice and all :).  I don\'t, however, like GURPs.  I think the system is clunky
and slows down the game (granted, alot has to do with the fact that I\'m not
familiar with it) and combat is time-consuming.

>So, what *can* be done to save them? Any ideas?

A massive mailing campaign to let them know that we don\'t want the game to be
thrown down the toilet.  To let them know that it is just not _right_ to put
out shoddy product with terrible support...

The second is getting someone who has at least the tiniest clue about graphic
design, page layout, and proofreading, and getting a group of experienced (and
inexperienced) Trav gamers to volunteer to playtest the new stuff that will be
coming out.  T4 _looks_ terrible (and its not merely the Foss artwork on the
covers).  The original black books had better layout, and they were most
probably done on very primitive mechanical equipment.  Artwork is important
too.  The guy who has been doing the interior art lately is excellent (he did
Empy\'s Arse, FF&S2, and Empy\'s Vehicles), but, a little variation would be
nice.  Especially if the artwork and the text could be integrated a little
better (I can\'t stand that in every book, its a few pages of dense words, and
all of the tables are on a seperate page.  Sometimes, its okay (FF&S2 for
example) but in most other cases its a big pain).

Does anyone have a clue about layout on this list?  I would be more then happy
to send in a sample of what I can do to Imperium Games.  I would welcome the
chance to do something I would enjoy and get paid for it.

Any artists floating around?  Again, I\'d gladly submit a portfolio of what I
can do to IG.

I mean, here we are, I don\'t mean this as an insult, the Traveller Geeks.  The
regulars here are probably the core of people who are most into and interested
in Traveller as a whole.  We have the love for the game that IG is lacking
(and that GDW, even in its final days had in great abundance).

The love of the game is the part that _could_ save the game.

>Or, equally, are they worth saving? Any ideas?

As I stated, I think they are, because I think that T4 is well worth saving.

reading that aren\'t totally justified. Remember that in the publishing
industry the possiblitiy of producing a 128 page first edition totally free
of errors is considered the holy grail (something to be strived for but
generally totally impossible). IG has produced 1 rules book, 13 suppliments,
1 hard cover suppliment, 2 adventures, 2 JTAS and 1 referee\'s screen (a grand
total of 20 products). Of these 3 (starships, first survey and emperor\'s
vehicles) have been of inferior quality to the extent where I would advise
a friend not to buy them. Of the others, 1 (fire, fusion and steel) has had
major formating errors and 2 (the rule book and emperor\'s arsenal) have had
annoying formating errors. Thats a grand total of 6 products which I would
regard as being \'problems\', all the rest fit well within the catergory of
quality products. IG *is not* continually pushing out crap. It has put out
far to many problem products (30%) and needs to take a good hard look at
things. But please bear in mind the other 70%. Perhaps IG should pay
attention to how a few bad products can so taint your image.

Now on to the demise of JTAS. It could be because of lack of money, but this
is not the only possible cause. I would appear to me that IG is recognising
that it can\'t get JTAS out the door on a regular basis and dropping it on
that grounds. It could also be difficulty in obtaining quality articles
on a regular basis (which given the level of posts here, on Travlang, ISBA,
HWIG and the web, would mean that IG just isn\'t looking). The demise of JTAS
does not automatically mean that IG is teatering on the edge of oblivion. It
*may* mean that but it *may* mean a lot of things. I regard it as a bad sign,
but I\'m not going to start writing epitaphs just yet.

Now on to GURPS:Traveller. This is *not* Traveller, this is GURPS Space set
in the Third Imperium. It is GURPS and GURPS is simply not Traveller, it just
doesn\'t \'feel\' the same. GURPS Space feels too much like Star Wars, Battlestar
Galaticia, Star Trek etc. for my tastes. Now to me this doesn\'t matter; I
have more than enough Traveller material in it\'s various incarnations to keep
playing in my little non-Canon universe until the crack of doom. But I will
be very sad to see the demise of Traveller. Now in my wildest fantasies if IG
goes belly up I\'d like to see Marc Millar giving the TML, HWIG, ISBA et al an
open non-profit licence to continue Traveller; BUT I think that will happen
when I see the flocks of Pigs migrating north past my window! Hold no
illusions, if IG goes under, with GURPS:Traveller, no other publisher will
pick it up; the Third Imperium will continue, but Traveller will be dead.

   Fear of flame, or lack of concern?  When news of trouble at GDW
began, the rumor mill cranked up full tilt.  You don\'t see that now. 
Maybe its just that we\'ve all been down this road before, but I sense
that some people are actually hoping your rumor is true.

   I will say what I said when GDW went under almost two years ago--be
careful what you wish for, you may not like the consequences of your
wish.

   Hard to say.  I\'m not aware of any financial data that is available
in the public dominion, and even if there were Sweetpea Entertainment
hasn\'t been around long enough to have any kind of established finanical
history.  You could ask SE for their monthly sales figures for the last
year and that would probably tell you all you need to know.  They will
give you that information too, right after it snows in the Amazon
rainforest...

   Perhaps Loren or Marc could correct me if I\'m wrong, but sourcebooks
seem to me to be much less labor intensive (assuming you use freelance
writers) and therefore have a much higher profit margins than journals. 
This would be particularly true if you can get your authors to work for
free and send you "ready for the printer" or minimal prep material (in
an electronic format ready to be "cut and pasted" into a document).  It
could be that Sweetpea is just trying to maximize its return on
Traveller and eliminating JTAS was one way to do that.

   There is a big difference between being poor and being cheap.  IG is
cheap (Marc has had to teach them how to spend money on managing an RPG
properly), but are they also poor?  We don\'t know at this point.  My
guess (based on some conversations I\'ve had with people who should know
something) is that IG is undergoing some change of focus, and what\'s
happening now is not based on financial concerns.

>All the anecdotes we\'ve heard, all the evidence we\'ve seen, seems to be quite

   Again, we don\'t have any idea what their finances look like.  Back
when I did my analysis of GDW\'s finanical state there things in the
public dominion that you could point to and say "GDW is headed into a
downward spiral".  There is nothing like that here except that JTAS and
Citizens of the Imperium (which IMHO raised about as much enthusiasm as
Euro Disney) are on hiatus.

   No, when or even if the end come for Imperium Games, it will be
sudden and there will be no tell tale signs.  It will just happen and we
will all continue on.

True.  Whether that matters or not depends on the speed of the underlying
hardware, together with the temporal requirements of a particular
application being run on the virtual machine.  For applications that need
to run as quickly as possible, native code will always be preferable.  For
AI applications, I was implicitly suggesting that it might not matter in
the 3rd Imperium.

If the hardware is designed to directly execute code for a particular VM,
there is no difference in speed.

True, and, as you mentioned below, such architectures are of considerable
theoretical interest.  As viruses continue to do more and more damage to
our economy, interest in hardware solutions to the virus problem will
continue to increase.  More development efforts in such architectures is
probably forthcoming in science and industry.

Hardware solutions won\'t help, of course, when we try and do something
crazy like build a computer that can change its own circuit pathways. ;)

The system will be vulnerable at whatever point in time and space the code
store gets loaded.  The problem with current systems is that there are too
many points at which the code store can be loaded, because the code store
is the same logical object as the data store (segments are arbitrary and
defined at runtime, after code is loaded).

Once the two are separated, there will be a whole volume of OS design
problems that have to be addresed:  Who decides when the code store can be
written?  When is the decision made?  Does the user always get notified,
with the option of canceling the write?  What will be done to facilitate
installation software (will the user have to approve *each* write, or can
he/she approve a related group of writes, and when does approval expire)?
That last one is the killer; there is a huge price tag attached. 

Clearly, all code loaded into a machine must first reside in the data
store (be it primary or secondary), since a program\'s code will be
distributed together with its data, and the same distribution media
(network, disk) will probably be used for both.  Likewise, newly written
software will reside in the data store.  Hence, there must be some kind of
data pathway that goes between the data store and the code store.  While
we can take every precaution that the software controlling this path is
non-hostile, we will always have a certain vulnerability here.  There is
always the possibility that the user will let a hostile program into the
system unintentionally (either through implicit or explicit approval, and
the implicit approval is where the real threat comes from, which is why
those OS questions are so important).

The debugger can also be a virtual machine for many applications.  Some
tests, though, have to be conducted directly on the system.

Never let a Vampire into your house.  8-)  A hostile program can always
attack your system once it\'s running in the CPU.

I like this one, but with a twist.  *Sometimes* let the players have
something they want with little or no effort...it leaves \'em paranoid,
waiting for the other shoe to drop. :)

Hrmmmm...I don\'t know.  They\'re both hard in different ways.

My own contributions:

Rule 6)  Don\'t put the Fate of the Universe (/Kingdom/Nation) in your
         characters hands right away.

         Work up through petty rivalries, low-impact warfare, or whatever
         before starting The Quest for Argh-Thuk.  Characters develop
         better in \'normal\' situations.

Rule 7)  Avoid starting an arms race.

         If you give the players a TL-50 zap-o-tron with unlimited ammo,
         they\'ll rule the Imperium in short order unless you throw a TL-52
         killamatic-armed Ancient horde at them...at which point the
         characters will either (a) die or (b) be armed with TL-52
         killamatics taken from the vanquished Ancients.  Neither\'s good
         for the campaign.

No, no. Calvin is *obviously* a member of Famile Spofulam\'s junior

"supervise" the team.

I was flipping through my old Supplement 5 today (I do that know and
then...nostalgia(sp))

I noticed the following ship names:
  Azhanti High Lightning
  Sylean High Lightning
  Vilani High Lightning
  Fiorin High Lightning
  Geonee High Lightning
  Acheron High Lightning
  Suerrat High Lightning
  Illurian High Lightning
  Luriani High Lightning
  
The ships seem to be named after races/cultures...I recognize Sylean,
Vilani, Geonee and Suerrat. Which begs the question:

Who/what are the Azhanti/Fiorin/Acheron/Illurian/Luriani?

Does anyone know any canon (or non-canon, for that matter) information
about these?

Just curious...

(I\'m thinking about making a FF&S2 version of AHL...thus I was reviewing
my books)

This much I can understand.  However, now, to narrow down my whole point:  How
come no new technological advances have been added to the Traveller universe
since the Little Black Books.

The FTL drive, yes, I can agree with you on that 100%.  Hyper...  um...  Jump
Drives are one of the cornerstones of the Traveller universe.  However,
reactionless drives are not (and try as I may, I cannot find any early
references to reactionless drives).  Just sounds like a way to cut down on
paperwork to me, and not a terribly important part of the Traveller universe
otherwise.

Besides, I\'m not advocating putting teleportation into Traveller, I was just
wondering why its perfectly alright to break the laws of physics, or
circumvent them sometimes, but not other times.

I agree, I rather like the guy doing the latest interior artwork.  Far
better than the rest, more "Travelleresque".  But they really need to quit
reusing it.  I don\'t expect to see same artwork book after book.  I expect
to see it in one book, and I can accept reusing it in a magazine.

I am especally sick and tired of the same Foss artwork.  I didn\'t like it
when it was in the original book, I really dislike them then reusing it on
every book!

This is a good example of how I judge a RPG product these days if I with my

that look better than what is being sold something is wrong here.  In this
day and age it\'s childs play to produce starcharts, and deckplans that look

Actually, reactionless drives have been *implied* from the very 
beginning, since there was no mention in the early travel formulae of 
keeping track of reaction mass.

If there were no reactionless drives, then we would have to keep track of 
some kind of fuel, and constant accel/decel (see early tables and 
formulae) would be impossible.

3. Extra expense for harness, recoil compensation, etc. which is completely
unnecessary in a conventional firearm.

4. Difficulty firing from a prone position.

5. Awkward to use with conventional jumpsuits, armor, chairs, crew

    'topic' => 'Jumpspace Theory (This may be long, about 50 lines on my program)',
    'body' => 'Jumpspace Theory

I am looking for opinions on Jumpspace. Following is a description on how I
believe Jumpspace works.

My only resources that describe jumpspace are from the MT: Players\' Manual.

The first thing we know about Jumpspace is that we know very little. The
concept outlined in the Players\' manual describes jump as the movement of
matter from one point in space to another point in space by traveling
through an alternate space. It takes about one week to travel through
jumpspace with a maximum distance of 6 parsecs.

We also know that a misjump can make a jump random in direction and
distance. Misjumps can break the 6-parsec limit.

The way I invision this process happening is this: First, I imagine our
universe as a piece of fabric. On the topside of the fabric is our universe
(our dimension) on the bottom side of the fabric is an alternate universe,
Jumpspace. The jumpdrive acts like a needle and thread. The drive punctures
the fabric from the top, drawing a piece of thread with it into the
alternate universe. The drive then pokes back up from the alternate universe
back into our normal universe, bringing the thread back into our universe.
The thread is then pulled tight pulling the fabric closer together,
shortening the distance between two points in normal space by passing
through an alternate space. The thread symbolizes jumpspace, a wormhole that
a ship travels through. The size of the jump drive would determine how much
thread can be created and maintained.

Misjumps can happen in a number of ways. First, navigation could have failed
and the destination point incorrect, making the distance and direction
random up to 6 parsecs. For jumps longer than 6 parsecs, other ideas come
into play. Two or more jump threads could get tangled together causing an
intersection in jumpspace. A whole web of jump threads come into mind this
way. A ship could be maintained in jumpspace if it crosses into another
ships jump thread and the other ship maintains the jump thread.
Theoretically, this could cause a ship to stay in jumpspace longer than one
week for a misjump. (Imagine how worried you would be after two or three
weeks in jumpspace). A properly working jumpdrive should be able to keep
itself in its own jump thread. This theory explains why it is so important
to keep ships maintained.

Ships that loose power or a jump thread is immediately sent back to normal
space. (Note: this is not instantaneous.) It would be possible to regain a
jump thread while still in the alternate space. The ship that looses power
would ride in the residual jump thread for a short time as the thread
dissipates. It would be possible to regain power and reinitiate the jump
drive to maintain the thread. If a ship looses a jump thread could attempt
to navigate towards the nearest jump thread. Of course, the destination of
the new jump thread would be completely unknown. Anytime a jump thread is
used that did not originate from your ship, travel is limited to the time
that thread is maintained by the host ship.

I think that these ideas help to role-play the disaster of a misjump.

If a ship is forced to enter normal space without the aid of a jump thread,
serious damage could result. The ship could easily be destroyed in the
process. (If it were easy to pass from alternate space to normal space
without a jump thread, jump drives would never be needed)

To answer a question posted earlier about a black globe and jumpspace.
Several things come to mind. Would the black glove shut down the jump
thread? Well, it might, but jumpspace is a part of physics that belong in an
alternate universe and would not necessarily work the way we expect. Worse
case scenario, I would say the jump thread could collapse and the ship would
be sent back towards normal space without a thread. The ship could
theoretically appear anywhere in normal space. The ship could still try and
locate another jump thread to attempt a somewhat safer trip back.

I would say, as a starship captain, do not risk playing around with what you
do not understand. Leave it up to the scientists to figure these things out.

I tried to think of why anyone would even want to activate a black globe in
jumpspace. The only reason I could think of is to appear in normal space
undetected. I think that the disturbance caused by the opening of a jump
portal would be obvious before the black globe was in range to cover it up.
The best bet there is to come out of jumpspace farther away than normal,
giving you plenty of time to activate the globe undetected.

I would like to here any feedback on these theories. Keep in mind, I have
not seen anything from TNE or T4. If there are any published articles, web
pages, or books that better describe jumpspace, please let me know.

Thank you,

Well, it depends on how you run it.  GURPS is very adaptable
in it\'s feel.  I have been running a GURPS Traveller campaign
that does indeed keep the Traveller feel.  I\'ve been in GURPS
campaigns with Neuromancer grittiness to Star Wars cinematics.

Now this isn\'t to say that those of you who prefer T4 should
switch.  And I think this talk of IG demise is grossly premature.
I just wanted to give GURPS it\'s due.

The Covenant of Sufren Subsector map is in the "Lady Elise" adventure that
came with the TNE Referees Screen.  It has a subsector map subsector
worldlisting with uwp info for TNE and  a half a page write up on the
covenant.

Well, as one of the lurking mob (and hence pretty much unknown), I\'m hoping
to be able to go to GenCon in 1998 (along with my girfriend). Mind you, the
airfair from Australia is rather high, and since I now have a wedding to
think about (I just got engaged yesterday), other things are likely to be
taking up my available money. (Still, here\'s hoping =) ).

The Solution isnt what even I\'d call man portable ... it\'s a light
artillery piece, rather than even a squad-support weapon.

The next issue is what sort of meson screen could you build at TL15, given
a say 50 kg weight range ... I suspect you could build a screen that would
protect a fire-team fairly well, with either TL15 batteries or fusion plus.

The Solution is really optimised for blowing absolute crap out of pre-Meson
Screen militaries - they just dont have a defense against it.

Cousin Ditzie has a man-portable meson gun as one of her ahhhh special
progects. I suspect it wont have a meaningful burst radius. My take on FFS2
is that Meson Guns will get about 3 times as efficient between TL12 and
TL15 - which puts the Solution still as not a man-portable weapon.

My feeling is that TL15 Imperial Marines would use small PAWs. Again, I
havent built one at TL15. If Famile Spofulam is still around circa 1100, I
suspect that we will be building man-portable damper boxes, so Marines can
fire 12mm Californium collapsing rounds ...

These look like slightly different spellings or derivations of:

Komo=E9 River in the west to the Togo Mountains in the east, the =
Ashanti empire was active in the slave trade in
the 18th century and unsuccessfully resisted British penetration in =
the 19th.

Fiorin is a type of grass called creeping bent (Agrostis stolonifera =
var. palustris). I think there must be a cultural reference but the =
spelling like the others has been changed.

Acheron is a river in Thesprot=EDa in Epirus, Greece, that was =
thought in ancient times to go to Hades because it flowed through =
dark gorges and went underground in several places; an oracle of the =
dead was located on its bank. In Greek mythology it is a river in =
Hades, and the name sometimes refers to the lower world generally. =
Several other rivers in Greece are also called Acheron, which =
traditionally means River of Woe.

Illyria, northwestern part of the Balkan Peninsula, inhabited from =
about the 10th century BC onward by the Illyrians, an Indo-European =
people. At the height of their power the Illyrian frontiers extended =
from the Danube River southward to the Adriatic Sea and from there =
eastward to the Sar Mountains.

The Luriani were a group of Jewish people working within the Lurianic =
Kabbala tradition.

Actually, there\'s a statement in the "little black books" about
tracking reaction mass. It said that if you wanted to worry about
manuever fuel, assume there was enough for a week? Month? of use (I
don\'t have the book here, but I read it as "enough to run at normal
acceleration for a month".

Working from the fuel and acceleration figures for either a Scout or a
Free Trader, I got an Isp that was in about the right range for a
fusion drive.

With an Isp in the hundreds of thousands, the type of fusion drive I
was thinking of *would* alllow those sorts of things. With a drive like
that, you get a thrust equal to that of the Saturn V from about ten
*kilograms* of fuel per second. 

For the much lower thrust requirements of a Scout or Free Trader, you
need a lot less.

Let\'s see....

Assume a 600 ton *mass* ship, at 1 g. It needs 600 tons of thrust
(~6000 newtons). Which means it uses about a *kilo* of fuel every
second. The old chart I got my fusion drive figures from had a Isp of
600,000 listed. Folks on the list have come up with different (and
probably more accurate) figures, but back in the 70s all I had was that
old NASA chart from a HS science class.

True, assuming 100 tons of fuel, the ship can only run the drive for a
bit more than a day. But that\'s enough to go a *long* way.

Well, *especially* if this is the sort of system you are using, program
*code* has no reason to be distributed on writeable media. Use ROM
packs for the code. And steal an idea from OS-9 and require all code to
be both relocatable and re-entrant (actually, the very *design* of such
a cpu pretty much ensures re-entrant code). 

This even has the advantage that program loads will be faster!

Hiya, Steinar

Don\'t know about \'Covenant\', but the Union of Sufren is detailed
in the (For Mega Traveller) Astrogator\'s Guide to the Diaspora 
Sector. (GDW 1992). It\'s ISBN is 1-55878-138-2
My guess is that this Covenant is something in the TNE setting,
but I could be wrong, as somebody is bound to mention!

>>Besides, getting nine different weapons functions out of a laser calls

>Oh... this sounds like a CHALLENGE!

It does sound like a challenge!

Here\'s my attempt:

The laser in question is a handheld tunable free electron laser
(don\'t ask me where to get the power source!).

1. Target blinding mode--relatively low power, low or high spread.
2. "Flame thrower mode"--spread set to about target size, with
   the highest continuous power output available.  Used to burn/cook
   the target\'s surface and/or set it on fire.  Useful against
   flammable targets and targets which aren\'t fully armored or not
   fully behind cover, but difficult to employ against moving
   targets.

   (My favorite mode.)

3. "Bullet mode"--spread set to about 1mm at target distance.  Lase
   a series of pulses designed to penetrate at the target point
   by vaporizing a layer at a time.  (A continuous beam would simply
   waste energy since the vaporized layer will continue to absorb
   light until it\'s dispersed.)

   Due to diffraction limits, this mode will have a limited range,
   but it has ability to penetrate armor.

   (A favorite of John Shilling.)

4. "Pulse mode"--spread set to maximum size which the laser can
   still vaporize with.  Lase pulses at maximum peak power to
   vaporize the surface layer of the target, relying on explosive
   force to damage the target.  This mode may be useful against
   unarmored targets.

5. "Shaped Pulse mode"--like pulse mode, but the pulse is shaped
   by optics into something other than a solid circle.  A long
   rectangle or ring shape may be useful for cutting slices in
   a wall (e.g. to cut open a door, or a smaller openning suitable
   for firing through or lobbing a grenade through).

6. "Soldering iron mode"--spread set to minimum.  Lase at maximum
   continuous power, using fire control to dwell on a single point.
   This will heat up the target at that concentrated point,
   causing it to reach failure point (which will result in a puncture
   if it\'s the wall of a pressure tank) and eventually melting it.
   This mode requires the target point to remain in view more or
   less continuously and fire control sophisticated enough to keep
   the laser on the same spot.  This mode may be useful against
   liquid fuel missiles and some aircraft.

7. "Hot knife mode"--same as "soldering iron mode", except that the
   target spot is a line segment which the laser sweeps back and
   forth across.  This takes longer, but may be useful against
   solid fuel missiles.

8. "Short range mode"--any of the above, but with a wavelength
   absorbed by the atmosphere.

9. "Microwave mode"--a continuous beam with a wavelength optimized
   for cooking the target.  Due to diffraction limits, this will
   spread greatly and thus have limited range.

....and I\'m sure there\'s plenty more!

Lasers are remarkably flexible in what ways they might damage a
target.

These aren\'t "weapons functions"...

....although this arguably is, assuming you use it to intimidate
particularly gullible officers with threats of blinding them.

Saw it again today, all the way through.  By blindly spouting random BS at
every opportunity, eventually you\'ll hit some target dead-on by sheer
accident.  I think that\'s what I accomplished in this case.  I got nothing
out of the first half hour or so that I hadn\'t already picked up from
previews or correctly filled in by rote.

I wrote in plot spoilers in my first post?  Wha -- ? oh.  Sarcasm.  Gotcha.

Ooops, I suppose I should have used the name of the character rather than
the actress -- but somehow after 1 2/3 screenings, the character\'s name
still slipped right on by me.  She was _that_ impressive.

The semiotic density of that scene was so great, and so twisted, it seemed
totally... um, alien, to the rest of the film.

Yeah, she looks older and wearier and totally hot^H^H^H much better.  A
long way from the panicky last-survivor-who-just-barely-gets-away-from-the-
slasher/monster/psycho (in virginal white underwear, of course) in the
original movie.

I first saw _Alien_ (#1) right around the same time I first played
Traveller; I guess it and the sequels occupy the same sort of spot in my
sci-fi constellations as I think the Star Wars films do for a lot of other
Traveller fans.  When I think of Traveller freighters, my immediate mental
picture is the Nostromo, not the Millenium Falcon.  And the themes of
"motherhood" that run through them all I personally find sorta -- engaging,
I guess would be the word for it.  My own take on the movies is that
they\'ve more or less become worse each time, while the character Ellen
Ripley and/or Sigourney Weaver\'s performance has more or less got better
each time.  For whatever _that\'s_ worth.

Probably this is a good one to rent on video, though; I\'m not sure it\'s
worth paying the premium for seeing it on the big screen.  Maybe I\'m just
jaded, so soon after seeing _Gattaca_ and _Starship Troopers_.  Regardless
of how stupid their contents, Verhoeven has a good eye for spectacle.
Aliens #4 didn\'t particularly impress me on the visual side of things.

Well, no; both times I made a point of looking and listening around to see
if anyone else was laughing, but there was a sort of respectful or bored
silence.  (The scene _was_ set in the chapel, after all.)  I did get
frostily stared at by some uppity cordite-\'n-gore puritan across the aisle,
though.  The teenagers around me (illegally unchaperoned, I now realize)
cheered and tittered only at the gunfire and gelatin/entrail hose-downs.
It was a mite disturbing, actually.  Their apparent desire to meet aliens
in order to bust open a great big can of amplified whup-ass on their
inferior extraterrestrial skulls is what led me to write what I did, below.

Watched the *whole* movie, am thinking about it as you suggest, and still
miss The Point.  Can I have a hint?

BTW, I\'ve reconsidered the screenplay for _Jones\'s and THWAP!\'s Awfully Big
Adventure_.  How about a Traveller PBEM game instead?

I\'ve never believed TRAVELLER is a set of mechanics. While the "feels"
between CT and MT changed significantly, I coulc still live with it. T:TNE,
on the other hand, completely turned the "flavor" of the game around.
That\'s when I realized that the mechanics don\'t make the system - the
setting does. Between T:TNE and T4, I played some GURPS: Traveller. In
fact, GURPS has been my third-most played system (after TRAVELLER (various
incarnations) and CALL OF CTHULHU).

I\'d advide people to give GURPS a chance, should it ever come to that. I\'ve
always loved the system, and the combat runs smoothly once you\'re used to
it. In fact, I always thought GURPS: Space was incredibly influenced by
TRAVELLER, so while I\'ve always heard of people using GURPS to play
TRAVELLER, it never struck me as odd.

Also, Steve Jackson Games produces some amazing supplements. Their errata
rate is far less than GDWs, and unbelievably less than IGs. There\'s a lot
of great things about the company. But -- in short -- if people can live
through a transition from CT mechanics to TNE mechanics, the GURPS system
will be a breeze.

Of course, people\'s tastes differ. I\'ve never seen a system so horrible
that I would flee screaming from it. But I\'m a big fan of GURPS and GURPS:
Space, and I\'m somewhat surprised that some people find it so malodorous
that it would herald the end of life as we know it.

Well, if this is taken as a sign of IG\'s demise, I\'d dismiss it, unless
anyone has any other evidence. Magazines are nearly as hard to put out as
supplements, and take a lot of resources for (relatively) little profit. It
makes business sense, if you\'re stretched (and how many companies aren\'t,
these days) to pull back on the magazine.  It\'s a shame, a great shame, but
it\'s not the end of the world. A lot of companies I\'ve worked for have
complained about the amount of resources magazines take away from other
projects.

Hi.  I popped in the middle of this discussion, so forgive me if somebody
already mentioned this.

The old JTAS (Issue #4) contained an article in "The Bestiary" section
describing a creature called a "Reticulan Parasite".  The article was written by
Chuck Kallenback III, and based off all available Alien information of the
time.  Interestingly, since the article was written before "Aliens" came out,
the life-cycle of the Alien was described a little differently.  It did not
involve a Queen egg-layer at all.  Instead it said that an Adult alien killed to
gain two hours of life-force from its victims.  When it ran out of victims, the
Alien went dormant and the body began producing larvae which crawled away from
the body at specific intervals and grew into a nest of eggs.

Based on the life cycle, this describes a creature that exists only to kill.  It
kills until there is nothing left, then it reproduces to wait and kill again.
Try to imagine a world where such a creature could evolve.  First of all, you
couldn\'t explain it away as a random mutation.  There is no way an Alien could
mutate from a humanoid or even a large insect race in just one step.  Evolution
implies steps, where mutations arise and become a more desirable feature.  Which
feature or features of the alien are the mutation from the evolutionary
neighbor?  The acid for blood?  One would hope so.  How would you like to get
caught on a planet where every lifeform had molecular acid pumping through its
veins!  How would they feed off each other?

Ah! But Chuck\'s creature reproduces asexually.  Perhaps the species is adaptive
or prone to mutation.  Maybe it gains something from each of its victims, and
adjusts the next generation to survive better.  In this case the alien that
Helen Ripley originally faced could have been a species torn from its homeworld
many generations ago.  And it had evolved in its unique manner to be a predator
parasite on spacecraft.  You must admit that acid-blood is a much greater
deterrent on a spacecraft than planetside.

And then the sequel came.  Starting with "Aliens", the species got a mother.
Not only did the queen lay eggs, but also cared about her offspring.  The alien
drones (warriors?) protected the nest, and didn\'t kill, but captured victims to
perpetuate the race.  The creatures also showed more intelligence, they had the
ability to NOT attack when the situation warranted a strategic withdrawal.
While it is still plausible that this is a genetically engineered lifeform, the
motivation of the species has definitely shifted.  Killing is for the good of
the whole, rather than the gain of the individual.  It could still be argued
that the race reproduces asexually since we\'ve never seen anything that
impregnates the queen.  But this incarnation is less mobile.  They are tied to
the nest, and the queen.  In my opinon, that makes it a less efficient weapon.

So what is the answer?  Bio-weapon or evolutionary marvel?  Certainly the single
alien who kills and goes to larval - egg growing incarnation is more likely to
be a bio-weapon than the queen based version.  The lone alien is just an
efficient killing machine. Anyone who designed the hive alien for use as a
weapon must have been insane, especially since the queen obviously has the
ability to produce more queens.  The species is intelligent and adaptive and
vicious and let\'s face it: isn\'t likely to stay put wherever you deploy it.

What goes around, comes around!

This has always bothered me too.  I thought that it made space combat 
very unrealistic for me, but I grew up with Startrek, Battlestar 
Galactica, and Star Wars.  I for one, wouldn\'t mind the ranges being 
reduced when or if someone ever gets around to writing some good 
space combat rules.

If you read the thread carefully, we were talking about thruster plates,
which have no reaction mass. Hence to conserve energy properly their
energy requirement has to go up with velocity (and to conserve momentum
you have to be dumping momentum into some object - like a nearby star),
which you can measure your velocity relative to.

These I know - but they\'re for reaction drives, not reactionless.

And this is a bad thing?

What exactly is Traveller anyway? is it a particular set of game mechanics?
Or is Traveller the fictional setting? This answer will vary by person. if
you had said "This is not Traveller TO ME", then I could accept your point.
But I am not attatched to the game mechanics. I hate randomly generated
characters, and AS A SYSTEM, I prefer GURPS hands down. Except for the
shipbuilding rules, but that\'s another issue.
	Not too long ago, using a hodge-podge of GURPS Traveller material found on
the Net, including the very excellent material written by David Summers, I
converted and ran the old Traveller module SIGNAL GK. This was highly
enjoyed by all concerned, and even those in my group who like T4 said that
it "felt" like Traveller. What they meant, of course, was that the
background was right, the characters were believable in the context of the
game world, and things worked more or less like they were supposed to. They
liked it. They want me to run another one. It was just as much Traveller to
them as anything else I\'ve run.
	If mechanics define Traveller, rather than game setting, then I\'m going to
try using Traveller mechanics to run Star Trek. Will that then be
Traveller? I don\'t think so :) And, of course, you run into the problem
that Traveller is on it\'s fourth set of mechanics....
	I prefer to think of Traveller as the fictional setting. YMMV.

The original rules ignored fuel, and even the nature of a drive. 
(Although Newton\'s Laws _were_ clearly kept.)  

First edition High Guard clearly stated that drives were fusion rockets
which could be used as weapons by fighters (usually more dangerous than
the fighters\' lasers!), but fuel usage was still mainly ignored.  (I
remember that the power plant powered the maneuver drive, and I vaguely
remember a reference to "normal usage".  I just assumed that the fuel
needed for reaction mass was insignificant - I knew little physics in
those days.)  

MegaTraveller introduced the concept of reactionless thrusters, with a
decent handwaving explanation.  See Starship Operators Manual for more
details.

So you see, there is canonical support for either viewpoint.  I\'ve always
liked the rocket idea myself, which is why I like HEPLar, but I played
MegaTraveller with thrusters for years.

   I am aware that we are talking about thruster plates, and that they
   have no reaction mass.  I may have forgotten to point out in my posts
   that the equations can apply to reactionless drives; you need only set
   `r\' to zero.  When you do that, you get a constant acceleration for
   a constant power input, exactly what the rules require.  Thus you do not
   /need/ to have a velocity-dependent power requirement to conserve energy.

   They can apply to reactionless drives when r=0.

 I have to concur all the Gurps:Space:Traveller games have had
the same feel as my CT, MT, and TNE games. I believe it is the
setting and not the rules that makes a game.

Well, conventional firearms require holsters, cases and covers, and on
higher-end items, stocks, muzzle brakes (or wait, is it "breaks" or
"brakes"?)...

Yeah, definitely calls for loose floppy trenchcoats or codpieces, or both.
For the rest -- I don\'t see it being a particular problem.

I have to disagree on this one... from what I\'ve seen over the years, men
are able to get their bio-PMPPs out in a flash, given cause.  This one
should be even faster.  Uses TL-11 spring materials to pop erect,
infalliably, ripping clean through any intervening trouseroids.  Another
good reason for broadsword-brandishing Imperial Marines to wear kilts.

>7. Impractical to mount bayonets, flashlights, scopes, etc. on it.

The original design used the "melee weapon frame construction" option, so I
think it _is_ a bayonet.  Flashlight?   Heh.  That\'s gotta be the silliest
suggestion yet for the PMPP <G>.

>8. How the heck do ya AIM the thing?! Like a sharpshooter, I mean. Mirrors?

It has a range of 30 meters and probably has some sort of noteworthy blast
radius -- sharpshooting?  Now that\'s no fun.  Presumably one of those
little spotting laser, mounted coaxially allows for adequate aiming.  By
hand.  Wear gloves!  Presumably after plenty of experience you could aim
just with your hips; play a lot of pinball for practice.  I was thinking
that higher-tech versions would have some sort of targeting system linked
to the wearer\'s eyes; it automatically aims at whatever you\'re looking at.
Seems only appropriate, after all.

I do this for a living. I highly doubt that IG would be willing to pay
enough to make it worth the while, though. I say this not because I make
lots \'o money (I don\'t, less than $21k), but because I suspect that
production in the rpg publishing industry is less than, shall we say,
lucrative.

We had this discussion on TravIRC one night a long time ago. We came 
to the conclusion that you could dump the rules and keep the setting 
and still have Traveller. And you could keep the rules and dump the 
setting and still have Traveller. But you can\'t dump *both* and still 
have Traveller. Pretty much everyone there agreed.

Here is my theory, didn\'t Supplement 5 come out before any knowledge of
these races/cultures?  Maybe, just maybe they are actually named after the
ships, not the ships after them.  Just a thought.

Then again it makes sense for the ships of this class to be named after
important planets in the Imperium.

	Assuming of course that you don\'t genetically engineer it to have
an instinctive inability to kill or eat you and your species...  Assuming
that you don\'t engineer an "off" switch of some sort in...

	I still think that the Aliens are just too perfectly tailored for
use against humans for evolutionary coincidence.  However, since this is
all very hypothetical here, we could argue this one till doomsday or Alien
5 (which given that the bioweapon hypothesis isn\'t terribly Hollywood,
probably wouldn\'t answer it for us).

	But actually, there\'s a lot that bugs me about the Aliens aside
from them being so perfectly tailored to humans; how does a chestburster go
from being a tiny little thing that fits into a human chest cavity without
impeding respiratory or cardiac functions to being an 8\' tall clawed spiky
toothy horror?  Where is all this mass coming from?  Where does all the
biologically secreted resin that makes up the nest come from?  They\'ve got
to eat in order to grow; they\'ve got to eat in order to secrete.  There\'s a
lot of biomass that seemingly comes out of nowhere (unless they spend a lot
of time eating roaches :>).

	Yup... inquiring minds want to know :).

I do like it (ignoring the "Wildest ride in the ship" and the
"gently yielding energy wall").
I always thought that traveller ships should be cramped internally,
but some rooms (such as the bridges and media centres) are so spacious
that you\'d think the designers wanted to allow room for film cameras to
be manoeuvred around :-)
Similarly, the first thing I\'d add to the briefing rooms and theatres
would be twice as many seats. The stateroom and mess hall designs look
a lot better.
The real confusion that I have is with the low berths. Where did the
concept of a separate recovery bed come from? The low berth area seems
to be too big. It should average 2 squares per berth since the bed size
implies a 1.5m square but the average is nearer 5 squares. Despite this,
the births are too close for anyone to actually get into.

Whilst browsing in my local Games Shop to find the NAM, I spotted a set
of BITS 101 books.

I didn\'t buy any \'cos I already have them but I hope it wasn\'t just a
one off (or someone selling their own copy).

I have misplaced your original post, so I\'m not sure what the mistake in
your equations is, but it\'s pretty clear that if you have a reactionless
drive the power input needs to vary to conserve energy. Consider a ship
of mass M, velocity v(t), accelerating at acceleration A=dv/dt.
THe kinetic energy of the ship is 0.5*M*v(t)^2.
The rate of change of kinetic energy of the ship is d(0.5*M*v(t)^2)/dt,
which is M*v(t)*dv/dt = M*A*v(t).
To conserve energy, the power into the drive has to equal the rate
of change of kinetic energy; therefore the power in has to equal M*A*v(t)
and the power has to increase as the velocity increases. If you repost
your equations I\'ll try and figure out exactly what the problem is - maybe
a division-by-r in their derivation, or maybe it\'s a relativisitc thing (since
as r=>0 exhaust velocity approaches c.) (There is the case of a photon 
drive, in which case the reaction mass is massless in some sense (and you
never run out of it) but that\'s not the same as a reactionless drive like
a thruster plate - and it has terrible energy efficiency.)

(note that this might be a good thing to discuss on Trav-tech, so as not to
bore the roleplayers with heavy-duty technobabble. Consequently I\'m only
going to give the quick outline.)

This turns out not to be incredibly hard, at least for lasers. 
The tricks are (a) don\'t aim the whole launch assembly precisely - aim it in
the right general direction and do fine aiming with a small mirror further
upstream; (b) since light doesn\'t care what direction it\'s going in,
have a sensor that looks along exactly the same mirror assembly as will launch
the laser, including the steering mirror; (c) pre-align the laser so it
goes exactly where the sensor is looking; and (d) close a control loop to
move the steering mirror to hold the target still on the center of the sensor.
Systems like this in use today - "fast tip/tilt systems" - can hold light
steady to tens of nanoradians (1 cm grouping at 1000 km, in your terms.)
(Those are systems on telescopes looking up, not laser weapons, but
the principle is the same.) This is how the Boeing/LockMart/TRW is going
to aim the laser on the YAL-1 - with all sorts of added complications due
to compensating atmospheric turbublence. They expect to be able to chose which
part of a scud-type missile to hit, at ranges of a few hundred km through the
atmosphere, to hit the fuel tanks - and they should be able to do it
*easily*. This is Laser Rule 1 - lasers don\'t miss. (Which is going to be 
an unpleasant surprise for fighter pilots if the YAL-1 really works.)

This approach compoensates for any and all motion of the firing platform,
and even for gravitational bending of light (which isn\'t really a big
deal.) 

How you make this work for PAWs and MGs is less clear to me, but I\'m sure
something analagous exists.

The only thing that prevents lasers from always hitting is the time it takes
the "projectile" to reach the target, as you say; the target gets a couple of
seconds to evade by randomly changing its velocity. There are interminable
discussions on trav-tech about the exact probabilities, but it generally
turns out that one light-sec isn\'t really that hard.

This, on the other hand, is completely true - which is why fusion weapons
aren\'t used in space combat in TNE/T4.1 (much though we all miss them.) 
It\'s not so much the intrinsic accuracy as, again, the time the target has
to evade while the fusion bolt is on its way.

   Now I don\'t question that certain horror movies (i.e. the Halloween
series) were written with underage viewers in mind (16-17 year olds),
but I don\'t know of any parent that would allow a 12 year old to watch
any of the Alien movies (well perhaps after they have been edited for
broadcast television).  All of them are clearly intended for mature
adults, which is probably why I\'ve liked them, where as I find movies
like "Halloween", "Friday the 13th", and "Nightmare of Elm Street" a
complete waste of good film stock.

   In my first Traveller campaign back in 1982, I had a NPC character
that ran around in a hopped up freighter and had a Vargr for a
travelling companion.  I guess you where *that* came from...

   I didn\'t see the first Alien movie until substantially later (just
before Aliens came out in \'86), much to my regret.  I\'ve tried to catch
the others at the theatre since.

   Well you just gave a better view than the New Yorker, the critic for

   The Point was the themes and other facets of the movie you just
described.  You sound as though you actually sat through the movie and
gave it a chance to entertain you.  It\'s also apparent that it fell
short of your expectations when it came to visuals.  One of the
criticisms of the last film was that it seemed liked they spent too much
time on visuals and not enought time on everything else.  That might
have been a consideration this time around and they went too far in the
other direction.

   Based on your review this time around, I\'ll wait to see it at the
"$1.75" (second run) theatre instead of catching it at the matinee (for
$3.50), and lower my expectations.  Thanks for the head\'s up.

Again, keeping track of reaction mass is too much record keeping during play.
On the other hand, I look at \'Fighting Ships\' and the pictures seem to have
thruster stuff shooting out...

Granted, they\'re only the pictures, but then again, back then the staff was
tighter on the pictures capturing the proper feel...

According to the original life-cycle designed by Giger for the Alien, it would
kill or cocoon its victims.  When hungry, it would eat someone.  Sometimes,
though, it would leave the victim alive and lay an egg inside, while covering
the victim with a sticky goop.  The egg would eat away at the victim and then
grow into a new "egg-pod", able to wait and eventually begin the process
again.  There was a scene that was cut from the film where Ripley found Dallas
cocooned (ever wonder why they never really showed Dallas\' death?), and I
believe he begged her to kill him, or something similiar.  

In addition, the actual life-cycle of the alien was supposed to be _extremely_
short.  It would kill/reproduce and then die within a very short time.  This
was kept in the movie, the alien gets quite sluggish at the very end (Ripley\'s
got to really torment it to get it to move), the implication was that it was
dying.

Both tidbits are taken from a "the making of..." type book that I saw when I
was much younger, and has probably since been stolen from my local library.
In addition it had the original surface suit designs by Moebius (drool!  I am
a Moebius surface suit fetishist) and a bunch of other really cool stuff...

It also had two or three pages from the _original_ script, stuff that wasn\'t
filmed.  The original script said that the alien they discovered was one of a
"degenerate" race.  A race that once had all sorts of culture, learning and
technology, but had declined into a savage state.  They had some original
artwork of a flat topped pyramid, and some crude hieroglyphs drawn by Dan
O\'Bannon (I think) that showed the alien\'s life cycle from beginning to end.

Well, something didn\'t click, and they dropped the whole idea.  Now, according
to the dialogues between O\'Bannon, Scott, and Giger and the interviewer that
were spread throughout the book, it was stated that the Alien was designed as
a weapon, and the Petrified Elephant Man was a captain carrying the eggs in a
big freighter to deploy them.  Of course, he fell victim to his own race\'s
weapon.  That\'s why there are thousands of such eggs in the massive horseshoe
ship\'s hull.

I\'m not sure which member of the designing team said this, but I do remember
reading it.

Now, after that, for whatever reason, they decided to make the critters in
Aliens more insectoid then necromantic in look.  O\'Bannon and Giger had
originally envisioned an alien creature with a method of reproduction that was
truly...  well...  alien.  Cameron and his crew decided to make them more
hived out, so that they were big, viscious ants.  I think that Cameron wanted
the tails to be stingers too, but I\'m not sure exactly where I read this, so,
I\'m not going to stand by it very strongly if someone wants to call me on it.
Maybe when I read the Aliens script, perhaps?

With Alien3, they decided to shift back to the original alien, in design at
least.  Once again, the critter was sleek and streamlined and bio-mechanical,
and far less insectoid.  Alien3 however further complicated the reproduction
issue by introducing a completely random face-hugger.  Alien3 introduced a new
theory (possibly not new, may have been in the Dark Horse comics first).  The
implanted seed "borrowed" the host\'s DNA and merged it with its own.  This is
why we have the ultra-viscious, running around on four legs dog-alien.  (As a
side note, the original filmed version had the face-hugger "impregnate" one of
the oxen that the prisoners used to pull the escape pod from the water.  This
was changed at the last minute, as somebody on the design team thought a dog-
alien would be more effective.  There are some horror movie trading cards
floating around with an oxen/face-hugger photo, and an oxen chestburster.)

I will not spoil the 4th movie for anybody, but suffice to say that it further
complicates the question of the aliens\' reproductive cycle (on purpose) and
muddles with the aliens\' abilities just a bit much for my tastes.

Now, the Dark Horse comics series both complicated and clarified the aliens in
different ways.  On one hand, they more or less stuck with the Cameron
interpretation of the aliens, and seemed to cater largely towards the "Space
Marines with BIG Guns" Aliens fans.  They seemed to screw up the technological
aspects of the universe pretty severely by trying to explain how _every_ piece
of equipment worked.

On the other hand, they came up with the idea that the Petrified Elephant Man
race _did_ leave the alien eggs to destroy humanity, knowing that humanity
would eventually take them back to Earth.  They also added to the mix by
saying that the aliens could perform a second function, that of terraforming
earth to be more like the home planet of the Petrified Elephant Men.

Take all this as whatever it may be worth to you.  The more you study the
alien, the more perplexing it gets :)

This might work, if industry decides to limit itself to ROM packs on its
computers.  The cost is considerable: 

1.  No more downloading code from any kind of network server.

2.  Special purpose platforms are required for software development; the
    ROM packs are "burned" from code on these platforms.

3.  From (2), custom software tools and specialized applications rise in
    price by one or more orders of magnitude.  No more free software (a
    ROM pack is physical media which costs money to manufacture).

4.  Academia, being mostly small-time (and the largest source of free
    software), will diverge from industry\'s path.  The benefits of
    academic research will take longer to reach the industry (this is
    already a problem today).  Money for academia will dry up, and less
    pure research will get done.  Progress will slow.

5.  The platforms from (2) can still be compromised.  When that happens,
    all ROM packs produced from the compromised platform can be made
    hostile.  When a trigger date comes, the trojan goes off and every
    machine that was using the ROM pack goes down.  People will begin to
    question the benefits of the ROM pack method.

Sorry to be such a nay-sayer.  I hate being so negative, but I think it\'s
true.

Thanks for listening.

a military-grade (circa 50 megajoule) PAW is going to do bad things to
radiation-sensitive equipment and unshielded people.

I can definitly see it shorting out most everything electronic and killing
most of the people aboard.

This is a Very Bad Thing for a pirate, because it will render the ship
unable to be captured and used.

It is also a Very Bad thing for the Imperial Navy, becasue it\'s use in an
ecosystem will require, at minimum, a lot of decontamination work. It\'s
also one hell of a terror weapon, for raids against small, undefended
colonies.

Therefore they are going to be heavily regulated.

Quick figures on a 250 megawatt PAW, optimised for 30kk range.

Sixteen meters long, two meters diameter. Output 50 megajoules.

Muzzle area three point one four two meters squared.

Theoretical Effective range 37 000 km.

Ninety KK beam pointer (3 m3, MCr 0.3, 0.3 t)

Tunnel volume 50.27 m3, 37.7 t, MCr 5.027.

250 MW accumulator (12.5 m3, MCr 0.125, 25 t)

Normal crewstation (7 m3, MCr 0.002, 0.2 t)

Total weapon mass 65.2 t, volume 72.77 m3 (5.2 dt), MCr 5.454.

Damage is 35 at 30kk, 29 at 45kk, 23 at 60kk, 17 at 75kk and 15 at 90kk.

Screw it. Why are we stuffing around with a 50 megajoule weapon ? What are
we, those wimps from X-tek ? Jeeez, it barely penetrates a starship hull at
60 000 km.

Upgrade to 250 megajoule output (max with a 16m tube is 256 MJ). This will
need 1250 megawatts of input.

Add another 50 m3 of accumulators. Mass is now 166t, MCr 6, 105.7 m3 (8
dtons).

Damage is now 79 at 30kk, 65 at 45kk, 48 at 60kk, 39 at 75kk and 33 at 90kk.

Now,that more like it *grin* putting many sorts of harm onto lightly
armoured ships at up to one fifth of a light-second, and stopping an
unarmoured ship at three tenths of a light second.

The weapon would easily fit as a spinal mount in a 100dt ship, assuming
power input is sufficient. A 200dt ship would easily fit one. Remeber to
get a sensor suite that can make a fire-control solution out to 90kk or so.

I don\'t think so....

If I recall the critical mass for Californium, a standard 12mm slug is
*way* over critical mass. It\'d blow as soon as it cleared the damper
field. Try 5.56mm or so.

The usual reason for things to be cramped is that space is at a
premium. But in a spaceship *mass* is what costs. Making the hull
bigger only increases the mass a bit, and you only need to worry about
*drag* if you are going to make high speed manuevers in an atmosphere. 

And given that you can\'t exactly "take a walk on deck", you\'ll *have*
to avoid feeling cramped unless you want to exclude 90% of the
population from using the ship!

I think we need "special" grapples then. Because what the ship is
grappling to is a *strut* which is *smaller* than it is. The grapple
only has to be able to support the mass of the rider though.

Star Trek *cannot* be done with Traveller "mechanics". No warp drive,
no transporters, no subspace radio.

Ah! You are confusing the *rules* with the "technologies".

You can have a completely different history and set of cultures and
still have "Traveller" if you keep the basic factors:

1. no FTL except ships
2. ships travel thru another space where they cannot be interfered with.
3. interstellar trip length is limited
4. trip duration is multiple days per trip

Basicly, what we are defining here as the "mechanics" are the *physics*
of the game universe. How the *universe* works, not how the *game* is
played. 

And you know something? The factors I list above *don\'t* fit Star Trek
(nor a number of other fictional settings). But they *do* fit an awful
lot of classical SF, and even some *current* SF.

You *do*.

Sorry, but at that point the equations *fail*. They are derived from an
integral with a limit *approaching* zero. But *at* zero, you have
infinities involved, and the equations *fail*.

You see, the reason a reaction drive can get away with constant power
for a given accel is *because* of the reaction mass. It applies the
same impulse to each "bit" of reaction mass, and all of them *start* at
rest relative to the drive. Thus the KE and momentum conservation works
out ok.

But if there\'s nothing being pushed on, then you violate conservation
laws big time, as you are turning energy into momentum, which isn\'t
allowed. 

The only way to not carry reaction mass *and* to obey conservation laws
is to keep pushing on the *same* object (planet or star). And in that
case, the fact that you are now pushing on something that *isn\'t "at
rest" with respect to the drive changes everything.

Not an official IG answer, but in the forthcoming 101 Lifeforms we are
using a Target Number of 10, and task dice of 2D in native ecosystem
against natural prey, and 3D for non-natural situations. (Approx 92% and
50% respectively).

Hmm,  Ok,  Try this then.

[warning, non-traveller-like concept follows, parental advisory recommended]

While a ship is in jump it accumulates heat in some form of capacitor or
heat sink (Expanding H2?) for later removal.  When entering normal space,
standard procedure is to deploy a \'radiative balloon\' on a cable or gantry
to place it away from the ship a bit.  This baloon is inflated with the
chemical or vapor which has been used to store the heat (or a
heat-exchanging liquid is used to cool the capacitor if you wish).  The
Balloon acts as a radiative surface for the ship on a regular basis,
eliminating heat problems.

Eh, never mind.  It has good real-world potential, but it ain\'t traveller.
I\'ll still be going with provebial \'black boxes\' that magically turn the
generated heat into small white furry rabbits to be ejected out the
airlock.  Occasionally this can be used in the role of sandcasters during
an especially heated battle.  They also make good antipersonnel weapons.
That\'s much more like traveller.

By the way, anyone ever heard of a "poodle gun"?  Secret Zhodani weapons
project or just a nasty rumor?

There is a difference between setting and game. My point in my earlier post
was that Traveller is not so utterly dependent on it\'s particular set of
game mechanics, that you can\'t port it into another system and still have
it "feel" like Traveller.
	Now, let\'s say someone has created a variant setting, say based on the old
Terran Confederation. They have, up to this point in time, been using the
Traveller rules. They decide to port this over to GURPS, but still call it
GURPS Traveller. Are we going to chase them off the list, screaming "This
isn\'t Traveller! Go away!"? 
	I have no intention of ceasing to run Traveller (the game system),
assuming that T4.1 actually makes it to the marketplace. BUT, I will be
using the Quick Generation rules for all characters from now on. I do not
like and have never liked random character creation. And I may just
institute a system of Ads/Disads for Traveller. I like the way they assist
both the player in defining their character\'s personality and history, and
the GM in finding story ideas for that character. If however, the
doomsayers are correct and IG does not bring out T4.1...GURPS here I come.

The "ultra short range" combats shown in just about *every* SF movie
and TV program are incredibly unrealistic. Any sort of *real* space
combat (except with extremely fuel limited rockets in orbit around a
planet) will *have* to be at ranges far outside visual ranmge (and you
can see a ship a lot farther than you might think)

The combat ranges in Traveller are a *direct* consequence of the
manuever drives. They are based on how far you move in a "turn", and on
what sort of velocity changes you can make in one.

Combat at shorter ranges and lower speeds would *require* the party
being attacked to *consent* to the attack by letting the other guy get
that close.

And Traveller combat isn\'t all *that* long range. Over on
rec.arts.sf.science, we\'ve had threads discussing "near future" space
combat that had attacks taking place at multiple AU ranges. 

The key to *those* was that the vessels had to conserve fuel and stick
to Hohmann transfer orbits (in other words, to be sitting ducks for
*months* at a time).

It\'s not "technological conservatism". It\'s the laws of phsyics. Combat
ranges are determined by propulsion technology as well as weapons tech.

my campaign world...

....and I\'ve notice that using realistic thrust, big drives are required
on heavily armored warships (duh!) -- which REALLY jacks up the price.

For example, my 800ton 6-G capable ship withan armor rating of 30 [115]
costs 2.7 billion credits (2,700MCr). The thruster unit itself is
900MCr, while the powerplant is 870MCr.

I\'m not saying this is bad...but I would point out that it is a far cry
from the ships in classic Traveller. 

For yucks, I design the standard 400 ton SDB - TL 12, Armor of 30[165]
(which personally I think is a little low), 2 lasers, 2 missiles,
average sensors, no ECM (which I think is unrealistic, but it keeps the
cost down)...and the cost was still 1.2 billion credits (1,200MCr). The
thruster unit was 451MCr (providing 6.0G/6.1G thrust) and the power
plant was 2200MW (with only 5Mw surplus). The thrust drive takes up
1800MW of power.

Now I understand that the above is the realistic model - but I have to
admit that it\'s bugging me that I\'m having a hard time recreating some
classic ships and having their crews and/or price be even remotely close
(this SDB needs a crew of 32...18 being engineers, for the drive and
power plant).

Does anyone have any opinions on the matter?

Huh? Why is decontamination needed? I think you are confusing
*radiation* and *radioactivity*. Hitting something with lots of most
types of radiation will kill people, plants, etc. But the radiation is
from the beam. It goes away when the beam does. 

To have lasting radiation effects (and thus have a need to
decontaminate) you have to *induce* RADIOACTIVITY. That\'s hard to do. 
A really high energy PAW will induce *some*, but not all that much. You
have to affect atomic *nuclei* to make things radioactive. And PAw
generally don\'t.

Now if someone comes up with a PAW that fires a nice "heavy" beam of
*neutrons*, then you\'ll have some interesting effects.

Interesting! I wish I had a LLB to check for that comment... :)

The book I remember using the travel formula from was _The Traveller
Book_. Is it in there too?

<SNIPPage>

Ah! But here is the crux of the matter. IIRC, the reaction fuel isn\'t
even accounted for in the design of the ship. 100 tons is a significant
amount of "slop" for a 600 ton design. The only fuel space alloted was
space for jump fuel.

Anyway, the point I was attempting to make was: not worrying about
reaction fuel is a gross simplification. Reaction mass takes up a lot of
space, and worrying about it requires judicious planning of travel --
you can\'t use the optimum full accel \'till midpoint travel formula for
many long-distance trips.

This is why MT came up with the reactionless drive handwave, and TNE
introduced HEPlaR drives. Not tracking fuel makes the drive, for all
intents and purposes, reactionless; whether it\'s described that way or
not is another matter. :-)

My bet is that they wanted single hex planets for Mayday gravity rules and
this has stuck. Remember the first Traveller spacecombat rules with planet
templates and lasers almost totally unaffected by range? Did anybody us
them? As for that matter, did anybody use the MT gridbased spacecombat
system that surely must be one of the most screwed up ass backwards
interpretations of newtonian movement ever.

1) A flashlight-sized device that can detect human sized respiration and

the military, this is only the one they are telling us about. 

This thing is being designed for battlefield use and works with VR 
glasses (which if the photo is correct are amazingly small).

Update either of these devices to TL 12 (which involves a 7.5x increase

amazing.

Hmmmm...how about *this* weird idea:

The thruster drive uses [insert handwave here] to \'find\' nearby particles
that are more or less at rest relative to the drive, and pushes them
backward for thrust.  This has several interesting effects:

1. For low velocities inside a star system, one can postulate that there
   will always be enough matter near enough and motionless enough for
   the drive to push against.  Zodiacal dust, solar wind, and so forth
   come to mind; simple thermal noise should have a lot of stuff moving
   in all directions at a broad range of (star-relative) velocities.

2. At high enough velocities, the drive won\'t be able to find enough
   nearby particles at rest relative to the drive.  It will need to push
   on ones already moving with respect to the ship instead, incurring
   an exponentially increasing energy cost.  Goodbye, killer lifeboats!

3. Flying a thruster vehicle in an atmosphere or near the ground becomes
   interesting...there might be a tendency to push things around a little
   bit. :)  Suddenly, starports as specialized landing fields (as opposed
   to the \'plop down anywhere\' model) make sense.

4. The 20 AU drop-off in thruster efficiency is explained as being due to
   the near-interstellar vacuum out there rather than via a gravitational
   handwave.

If one posits the \'find a bunch of convenient particles\' step (which is
admittedly a whopper), this seems to work well.  I\'m *not* proposing these
be \'found\' using sensors or the like, but rather that the \'extended drive
field\' will only *interact* with particles having the right velocity.
Shades of Maxwell\'s Demon!

Um, well...more or less.

What you\'ve got to do is avoid effective *communication* or *travel*
between systems FTL...except in ships.

Let\'s say, gravity propagates it\'s effects at something above c, and in
Traveller we can manipulate gravity..then, say, it\'s possible to modulate
those gravity waves/particles to send a message FTL.  IMO, that *wouldn\'t*
be Traveller.  Given the same FTL-gravity, but limit the range at which any
modulation can be detected to..let\'s say 1 million km..I\'d say you\'re still
playing Traveller, because you can\'t really use this technology to
*effectively* transmit information between systems faster than with a ship.

This is scary when combined with my 250 mejajoule particle weapon, which
(plus enough batteries for 1 hours sustained fire) happily fits in a 200 dt
ship, and costs abou MCr 10.

I\'m starting to think that it is two out of sane cost, high gees and armour
protection.

Yeah. Once we moved thrust from being based on volume to be based on mass,
6Gs was a lot harder to do.

My back-of-the envelope TL9 starships were dealing with thrusts in about
the 0.1 G range.

OK. This means that PAWs are far less of a problem for the IN, and thus far
more likely to be standard-issue civilian (albeit high-threat civilian)
weapons.

I\'m not a physics geek ... but could you build a PAW by getting hydrogen
with extra neutrons (deuterium), charging it, accelerating it down the
tube, and then neutralising the particle ?

The heavier particle would need more energy to accelerate to near C, but
that would just mean less particles to send to get the same energy.

Enquiring minds in FS\' High Energy Solutions branch want to know ...

I\'ve been reading the \'Technological Conservatism\' messages with
interest.  Here\'s my take on nanotech and why it\'s not widespread in the
Third Imperium: it\'s been banned by the Imperium.  Just add to your
Imperial Encyclopedia some entries detailing a few gruesome accidents
involving runaway nanotech.  Add a couple of red-zone quarantined worlds
turned to goo (or such) by nanotech replicators.  Hence the
Imperium-wide ban.

Of course, this method leaves open the possibility that the PCs will
come across some kind of illegal nanotech in the course of an adventure,
while at the same time limiting the impact of widespread nanotech.

I\'d forgotten about this one. In terms of game play this would be less cruel 
to pull on players. I\'ve been watching this thread awhile and wanted to make 
some comments:

The original movie concept of the alien had some sort of queen involved
in the creature\'s reproduction. Reference to this was cut from the movie. 
I have no idea if the original "queen" was similar to the one used in 
Aliens. Since some amphibians can change gender when there is a shortage
of a particular gender, and worker bees can produce a "queen" out of what
amounts to as thin air, I\'d always thought that the Alien queen was created 
in this sort of way. Just because we didn\'t see a "queen" in A1 doesn\'t 
exclude the possibility of it being there behind the scenes.

Again this assumes that it is intended as a short term weapon. In the long 
term mass reproduction will overwhelm the other side. Every one of your 
losses means a gain in the Alien population. Think of a hive structure.

A second complaint I\'ve seen frequently posted is that the Aliens are too
well adapted to human physiology to have occurred naturally. I don\'t
see this as a problem. First of all I don\'t see the face hugger and the
chest-ripper as tailored strictly to humans. In the 3rd movie these 
stages of the creature attack and impregnate a dog. It is only necessary 
to assume that "most" animals in our region of the galaxy have a detached 
head (to grab) and that head is connected to a respiratory system in which 
to lay the egg. The end product will be a creature tailored to its new 
environment by sampling some of its host\'s DNA. Recall that the dog in A3 
produced a creature that moved on four legs and hunted. Because its behavior 
is more cat like, it would have been more consistent in A3 to have had a cat
as a host rather than a dog. This suggested to me that the creature uses its
host as a first guess as to the best morphology for survival in its new 
environment, i.e. it takes on the dominant characteristics of the host
because it assumes they will help with survival. Marc mentions that this 
is an intelligent creature. I\'d suggest that that it depends on the 
intelligence of the host. Recall that in A3 the alien seemed more 
instinctive, and less intelligent that in A1 and A2.

So if you don\'t believe that the creature was a natural occurance that was 
transported off its home world by mistake, there is still the question of 
who would build such a weapon? Could grandfather\'s conflict have unleashed
something along these lines? Perhaps it was a mistake that got loose? A
side in the conflict that sees it has nothing left to lose (for example 
the builders of the Berserker ships) might create something that is guaranteed
to take the other side with it. What about the psychological value of
threatening to unleash such a creature?

Big time.

Personally, I like random character generation better than a point system. 
What I think is that there should be several character generation systems
useable with Traveller, point based and random, quick and
detailed...whatever you want.

Ads/Disads are a mixed blessing, IMO.  Yes, they can give players ideas and
can spur them to develop unique and interesting characters, but sometimes
players use them as a crutch.  Crutches aren\'t good, spurs to thought
are...it can go either way.

From where I sit, that is to say an active GM using the T4 system, there is no
difference.  I am fortunate to have the forum of the TML for starship/vehicle
designs, equipment suggestions, story ideas.  These are all things that, prior
to my introduction to this forum, I _depended_ on the industry magazines for.
Most GM\'s do not have, or are unaware of, access to the TML, and without The
Journal, they will look elsewhere.

I am aware that IG needs the cash flow of the major releases to stay in
business.  But, IMHO, they need to \'stoke\' the fires with a relatively
inexpensive medium that keeps players and GMs alike \'hungry\' for more.  All the
avenues that I would have pursued, seem to be falling by the wayside.  The
website (which I thought had a lot of promise and would cost relatively little)
appears to have been abandoned, Citizens (an interesting way of engaging your
market) is gone and now the fanzine has been put aside.

So, allow me to propose a solution.  The website has a lot of promise and can be
relatively simple to maintain.  Hell, Word can do most of the HTML coding - you
just have to work on design and content.  Then use a text editor to remove the
MS specific garbage, and clean up the page for the various browsers that hit
your site.

Get the stuff that you are not going to support off of it (i.e. Citizens and
Journal Submissions).  If you are having difficulty keeping to your published
schedules, don\'t put specific dates, don\'t make promises that can\'t be kept (we
remember).  Keep the site simple and easy to download.  Put GM aids on the site
- - not just commercials for your products.  Make it worthwhile to visit!  Putting
the past TAS articles was a good start - follow up with adventure ideas,
mini-campaigns, etc.  Add a section for equipment and vehicle designs.  (IMO,
you missed out when THUDD was looking for a home - that was a golden
opportunity!)  With all the stuff that passes through the TML, I\'m sure there is
a percentage of gearheads and budding authors who would let their work get
posted in return for author\'s credits.  More than that, you would start getting
a lot more traffic on your web site (I do hope that counter is wrong!) and each
person who passes through would be someone who is either interested in, or
currently playing in, a Traveller campaign.  Release past material - do you know
what the demand is out here for some of the past articles of the Journal?  Even
if it is not T4 specific, there will still be interest...there are a lot of
people still playing previous versions of traveller who would love (I\'m
sure) even the appearance of support from IG.

Make the website do the job that the Journal should do - i.e. be the method with
which you can provide a consistant framework for GM\'s to build their campaigns
in.

We also had a few miniatures...the eternally unpainted Free Trader, the
incongruously Spitfirish Scout, and so forth.  Ah, I remember it well. :)

I really did enjoy Book 2 starship combat; just having a Newtonian
movement system utterly blew me away.  Needless to say, I also adored
Mayday (Book 2 with hexes).  I never did quite understand why Brilliant
Lances went to that weird, cumbersome turning-points system.

As for what would have happened if you\'d surrendered, Douglas, I had that
all planned out...they\'d kill you (and all other crewmembers) shortly
after boarding the vessel.  Why leave live enemies/witnesses?  Said
pirates were already capital criminals (IMTU) merely by virtue of having
threatened to fire on your ship.  Long before M0 came around, I realized
that the 3I is driven by economics, and that the Imperium will take active
interest in stomping out all impediments to interworld trade.

Which, of course, begs the question of where all Doug\'s pirate attackers
came from...maybe his character was just *seriously* unlucky? :)

I *like* the look of most the GURPS products, and I\'ve bought several.  The
typefaces they use are easy to read and effective. Their layout is
utilitarian, not arty, just right for a manual. There isn\'t much art, but
what there is fits the subject and conveys a good feel for it without being
distracting. Many of the GURPS books, like the CT books, can be described
as being plain and utilitarian, but I\'d say they are elegant and easy to
use. Of course, I\'m not a graphic artist, just a GM and player...that buys
games.  

Wasn\'t it Joe Walsh that said, "I don\'t know art, but I know what I
like."..or was that Ken Bearden? ;->

Ok, you are...no that would too easy! ;-> (Sorry, couldn\'t resist!)

Actually, I agree with you that the way a gamebook looks is very important.
We, probably, disagree on what "look" we\'re looking for, though. Cover Art
*might* make me pick it up, but content is what sells it to me.

I want clear well-written text in an easy to read font..IMO, a boring TmsRm
or Century Schoolbook is *good* for a body font.  I want examples, lots of
them, set off in italics and blocked with the rules they describe. I want
tables and formula with the text to which they refer, and large and easy to
read. I want a good TOC and an index. I want background, adventures and
designer notes, but I *don\'t* want them mixed in with rules, put each in
its own section. I don\'t want much art, and what there is should be small
B/W line art that illustrates the content.  Those are the things I look for
in a gamebook.

Here\'s an evil data point from "The Terrorist on the TML" (that\'s me!):

Quite a while ago, I was running gaming at a local Trek convention, and was 
asked to run a Star Trek RPG session.  "Sure thing!" I said like a fool,
planning on pulling an all-nighter and make up an adventure somehow.  Of 
course, I had my Traveller stuff with me, too.

I didn\'t create something new, so I grabbed one of the good old Classic 
Traveller Double Adventures: Chamax Plague / Horde.  The set up was that the 
PCs were the command crew of a "Classic Trek" era city-class frigate (the USS 
Baltimore, I believe), assigned to border patrol duties.  They were to patrol 
Federation colonies on the frontier and assist survey parties as required.

A survey party in a shuttlecraft put down on Chamax to conduct a detailed
survey of the world before colonization, while the Baltimore patrolled
nearby.  The shuttlecraft sent a subspace "mayday", but went off the air 
before the ship could reach them.

After taking enough time for the PCs to get thoroughly sick of the Chamax
bugs (and kill a few redshirts in good Trek style, for some odd reason
the bugs seem to be immune to phasers on \'stun\'), I had a distress call
come in from a nearby colony world that was "under attack" (giving the PCs
a good excuse to fight their way clear of the Chamax and beam up), and
moving on to the "Horde" portion of the adventure, when the Chamax bugs
attack a human-inhabited world.

I had to do a little conniving so that the PCs wouldn\'t just phaser and 
photon torpedo the peninsula from orbit until it was glassed over, so I
put some important cities and infrastructure (the colony\'s only
desalinization plant, for example) there.

The PCs had a ball fighting bugs and saving the colony.  And despite my
best efforts eventually did call for phasers from orbit (and nearly got
clobbered by their own orbital fire).

Then they got to chase down the dozen-odd _other_ Chamax escape fleets, and
sort out the bug-infested ones from the ones with sentients in cold sleep.

All in all, fairly successful.

But was it Traveller?  I kept the adventure pretty much as written, making
allowances for the different rules system.

Well, at least then the long ranges make sense.  I was a little confused as to
why they would pick such a system that was so completely against the grain of
a good deal of sci-fi...

You know, when I posted my first technological conservatism message about two
weeks ago, I started to suspect that there people don\'t actually read
messages, or at least mine (which I can understand, as I tend to have long
messages, sometimes *I\'m* not in the mood to read my own messages).

However, now I know that some people don\'t read my messages.  It seems as if
you\'re starting to tear my head off here, and you\'re repeating what I said in
the original message!  Amazing.  Amazing.

I said that the close combat in movies probably wouldn\'t be all that
realistic.

Okay, now you\'ve got my interest, WHY does space combat _have_ to be at super
long range, especially when you have to extend the ranges of weapons to do so
in the first place.  From a romantic perspective, its terrible.  From a
scientific perspective, it seems unrealistic, so where\'s the middle ground?

>Combat at shorter ranges and lower speeds would *require* the party

To look at it that way, I guess you could say that about _any_ combat, and of
course, just like in real life, the side with the longer range and better
accuracy is going to kick butt.  Of course, its not that way with real combat,
there\'s stealth, and jamming, and long range weapons, just like there are in
Traveller space combat.

May be realistic, but not terribly interesting for Traveller space combat.  So
in this case, since Traveller is a game, lets shelve realism on this point.
Travel between worlds already takes a long time, combats lasting several
months would really stretch things to the limit.

Of course combat ranges are determined by both propulsion and weapons tech.
And no it isn\'t technological conservatism, but it is related in the sense it
seems to be a holdover from an earlier time of Traveller.  Just asking, no
need to take a super arrogant tone.

Geez.

I will tend to disagree.  Traveller is, in my opinion, as much based on the
mechanics as the background.  In fact, I think it is more the mechanics then
the background.

Traveller is to me:

Traveller is, first and foremost in my mind, a character generation system.
The ability to actually have a history before the character plays one second
is great.  That\'s the single thing I remember liking the most when I was a wee
pup checking out my older brother\'s "Traveller Book".  It gave the game more
of a Star Wars type feel, where everyone had different backgrounds and skills
and abilities.

Second, and this is important, the mechanics _must_ be simple enough to come
up with a large number of things on the fly, and must be able to be recorded
simply.  The world of Traveller can have an infinite number of world,
subsector, and sector combinations.  Animals and random encounter tables must
be able to be made and recorded easily.  Mainworld data, same thing.  You must
be able to do everything "on the bounce and by the numbers".

Third is the library data.  Not the actual material contained in the data, but
the whole concept itself.  An everchanging library of information, that keeps
expanding with every book and supplement.

These are the things, not the type of ftl drive used, nor the technology, nor
the background, nor even the Imperium are Traveller.  Traveller is the ability
to come up with an infinite amount of situations in the shortest possible
time.

Mind you, before anyone opens the floodgates of flame, these are my opinions.
I\'m not saying that they are absolutely right, nor am I saying everyone else
is wrong.  I first discovered Traveller back just about the beginning of the
"golden age" of RPGs, about 1982.  My brother bought the Traveller Book and
Adventure 1: The Kinunir.  That was where I originally got the "feel" of
Traveller.  I had no universe, I had nothing but those two books.  I made up
subsectors and sectors, I made alien races, I populated worlds, I fleshed out
the short adventures in the back of the book, made maps, etc.  Certain things
stuck with me.  About 5 or 6 years later, I bought an early errata laden
version of Megatraveller.  There was too much stuff, I was completely turned
off.  I wasn\'t expecting _that much_ information, in many cases incomplete or
incorrect.  It collected dust, but I and my older brother kept generating
characters, and equipping them, and naming them.  I kept building subsectors
and sectors and designing starships and vehicles.  These things eventually
added themselves to important status in the Traveller universe.  When I
eventually got TNE, I was kind of disappointed.  They screwed with the system,
removed much of the stuff I knew about, and changed all the other stuff I knew
about.  Traveller took so much more time at that point.  The book was so thick
with background and stuff that all the imagination of making your own universe
just got sucked right out.  Everything was in a framework, and tied in with a
storyline...

When the Traveller Book just had the Imperium and info tacked on at the very
end.  You had a whole universe to invent all on your own.  TNE was faced with
closed borders and a massive history...

I like the background for all the games.  I don\'t like how the background has
overtaken the game though, and that\'s bad.  It drives away new players, and
tends to anger old players and alienate them.  I was so hopeful for TNE after
FF&S1.  They told you how things were done in the original Traveller and
MegaTraveller universes, told you what they changed and why, and then, here\'s
the clinker, gave you ideas for other ways to do the same thing.

That was really cool.

But, all this is just my opinion for what its worth, and now I\'m rambling.

In your mind, did you call it Traveller?  If you did it was...IMO.

Me, I\'d have called it Star Trek, played in the Traveller fashion..or more
likely not bothered to call it anything except a game. ;->

I completely agree.  A show of support for the product line in general might go
a long way toward dispelling these rumors about IG\'s impending demise.
Traveller is so much more than that stack of T4 books.  The game has a rich
history.  Imperium Games should embrace that history (or is it the future),
instead of pretending Milieu 0 (200, 400, etc...) is the only game in town!

If anyone wants the Classic Traveller stats to the Alien from JTAS #4, let me

The thing I like best about Traveller, is that GM\'s can tailor aspects of their
universe to fit almost any adventure they would like to run.  If they want to
run an adventure with Alien(s) in it, then they can.  And if they want the
Aliens to be bio-weapons they can be.  If they want them to be evolved they can
do that too.  We could all argue our opinions on this until we\'re blue in the
fingers, and it won\'t change the essential fact, that when it comes to how a
GM\'s universe works, the GM has the final say.  And there\'s nothing wrong with
that!  I say, let canon be damned (it\'s all invented nonsense anyway)!  Since
most players know most of the "real" Alien story, a GM could probably benefit
from "modifying" the specifics of the creature to keep the players guessing.

Like Hicks said, "I say we go back to the ship and nuke the site from orbit.
It\'s the only way to be sure."  Or is it?  Besides, where\'s the bloody sport in
that?  ;)

These numbers seem _unrealistically_ high.  IIRC wolves have about a 10
to 15% success rate in bringing down moose despite the fact that they
use pack tactics (ie gang up on) the moose.  Of course this covers the
sneak up close to the moose, chase the moose down, don\'t get kicked to
death by the moose, bite the moose, hurt the moose, slow the moose, and
kill the moose and not merely the - bite the moose - task that a single
animal attack in Traveller represents.  Maybe moose have dodge pools and
use their (Str 17 or so) strength pools to reroll their dammage dice to
hurt the wolves more.

Remember the carnivores do not have to win very often they only have to
win often enough to stay fed.  If the pack can stay fed for 3 or 4 days
on one moose and each attempt to hunt and kill a moose takes only a few
minutes or hours the wolves can afford to fail most of the time - as
long as the moose population density is high enough that the wolves can
try again.  The herbivores only get to fail once but as long as they are
breeding well enough the species won\'t miss the individual.

I am aware that wolves normally hunt prey somewhat smaller than moose
and I suspect that they probably have a somewhat higher rate of sucsess
but I think that a 92% rate is way too high.

Excellant idea, and makes for many cool scenario ideas.  :)

Yep! We did.

And actually, the hex size was set by the turn length and the
aceleration "granularity".

Triplanetary (the predecessor of Mayday) actually *had* multi-hex
planets as I recall. Or maybe that was a close approach to the Sun?

Sure. The particles will kick up *lots* of secondariy particles as they
plow into the hull. That will tend to fry electronics due to messing up
PN junctions in semiconductors. And kill crew due to radiation damage of
cells.

Easier to just use regular hydrogen. That give you a beam of protons
until you add electrons, at which point you get hydrogen again.

Ah! Like the guy I heard about who, after a long fight, got a driver\'s
license with "O" listed for "Sex".

I dunno about sex segregated, but they\'ll have to be *species*
segregated. Humans and vargr can probably use each other\'s facilities
(though the vargr will have problems with their tails). Aslan can
probably use human or vargr facilities as well, though size differences
might be a problem. 

But there\'s no way a K\'kree or a Hiver can use human facilities or each
other\'s. Ditto for lots of other "non humanoid" races.

BTW, there\'s a lot of variation in the "facilities" used in "civilized"
countries right here on Earth. Consider the bidet, and the "Turkish"
toilet. These can come as quite a suprise when visiting another country.

Alas, because of the *small* amount of such matter, you\'ll have to push
it to almost c to get the required thrust. That makes your "exhaust"
dangerous as hell for quite some distance (in effect, it\'s a huge
particle accelerator). 

Also, this immediately brings to mind the question "why not hook up a
*powerful* thruster plate, aim" it at the enemy ship and then dump in a
few kilos of sand?" This would give the other ship a near-c
sandblasting. And probably destroy it.

Whenever I make spacecombat systems (there has been a few over the years) I
always choose my hex/square scale first and calculate turn length from
that.
Why was Maydays turnlength fixed beforehand as you imply?

Unless you count cliches as bad -- that basket-case baby alien made it an
automatic B-movie in my book, no matter how much they spent on it.  I
can\'t even count the number of times that I\'ve seen that cliche on video. 
They were obviously desparate for new material.  Do they think they\'re the

This is cool :) Those adventures are my second favorite published CT
adventures, right behind Signal GK. And while I never ran it, I also
thought about using it with Star Trek :) Still have the notes I made on
converting the animals, in fact.

I would not say it was Traveller, however . I would say it was a damn good
Star Trek adventure, though ;) better than most of the ones they did.

I\'m going to very shortly be turning "Murder on Arcturus Station" into a
Babylon Project adventure. You know, those old Traveller scenarios must be
pretty good, if they can be used in so many different games :)

Allen Shock

P.S. There\'s an interesting subject: what adventures from other games would
make good Traveller adventures? i can think of one right off the top of my
head; "Stardemon", written by Greg Porter and published by Steve jackson
games for GURPS Space.

No problem.  Good to see my youth as a film geek got me somewhere in life
(besides getting all the in-jokes in Scream).

>AHA!  The aliens from Double Adventure 1 (?), _Shadows_!!!!

Yeah, I guess that there is sort of a parallel there.  I\'ve always wondered
about the aliens in Shadows.  Are they still out there?  Do they have jump
drive yet?  Are they empire builders?

Y\'know, the typical stuff :)

But, we have a bio-weapon of our own to use!  Mad cow disease!  Of course we
wouldn\'t be able to chomp down alien steaks afterwards...  But hey, one thing
at a time.

I like virus from another angle.  Up until recently I never knew that Virus
was supposed to be a silicon based life-form that was _found_.  I didn\'t have
survival margin, and there\'s no mention of that in any of the other TNE books
that I have.  I just figured that it was just a nasty virus that was amazingly
adaptive, and at one point had been extremely deadly.  I liked the idea of and
emergent sentience at war with the remnants of the old Imperium though.

Now, if you do use the DNA "splicing" abilities of the alien, here are a few
thoughts to chew on:

An Aslan-alien would be pretty nasty.
An Ithklur-alien would be far more frightening.
A Hiver-alien would be...  amusing.
A K\'Kree-alien might not be very terrifying ("Captain, he\'s eating all of our
lettuce!")
<I feel bad.  Everyone swipes at the poor Centaurs.>

Oh, one last bit of Alien trivia:

Q:  Where was the idea for the alien cleanly swiped from?

A:  _Voyage of the Space-Beagle_ by E.E. Doc Smith I believe if I remember
right.  There was a critter called an Ixtl that was one of a degenerate race.
They had eggs that could be implanted in a host and then would eat their way
out.  The one in the book was the last of the species, the others had killed
themselves in a nuclear war.  Unlike the alien though, these guys servived on
"energy" and could move through solid objects.

I sort of ran into this problem in the adventure I\'m currently writing for my
party.  It is an Ancient research complex.  What would droyne-like toilets
look like?  I\'ve finally settled on round hollow stools with a small support
for the lower back.  Each would be set a bit away from the walls because of
the wings.

Droyne beds, on the other hand, are more confusing.  I\'ve settled on a perch
that runs around the perimeter of the room and is set 1 to 1.5 meters off the
floor, in the barracks for the warriors the perch is higher then in the
barracks for the other types.

Still though.  A perplexing problem.

  This is one of the subplots in my campaign right now. Born from a feeling
of "that T2 thing was too cool to ignore", I created a robot that looks like
the T1000 creature from that movie but is really composed of tiny robots. Up
close, there is a definite grainy texture to the appearance of the thing. I
won\'t give away more details, in case any of my players read this list, but
it\'s been the cause of a few adventures.

Neals book (very good read) is SF - not real world book. Read "Engines of
creation" or better yet the other bmore recent book (forgot its name) from
that Drexler guy (godfather of nano).

GURPS is releasing GURPS Biotech just now that might be interesting but
judging from GURPS Robots and GURPS Ultra-tech-II their nanostuff is more
like magic spells than real world stuff (just as Neal Stephensons is). If
you\'re going to incorporate nanos please consider some limitations to the
tech such as cryogenic requirements (the assemblers are destroyed if above
say 100 Kelvin) or that the actual nanites are degraded over time from
thermal disruption, UV-light or whatever. If you don\'t pu reasonable
limitations on nano aside from HUGE price your players will wonder "why
isn\'t everything nano if it is so good?"

Wow. I completely disagree. Seven or so years ago, GURPS wasn\'t great, as
far as looks went, but artwork and layout seems to have become a priority
since then, with GURPS: Goblins being one of the prettiest books I\'ve
*ever* seen.

Few GURPS releases have disappointed me since, say, 1992 or so...

I remember in China in the late \'70s being shown "Western-style" toilets at
a newly-reopened tourist site:  one trench for men, one trench for women.

But public restrooms nowadays are effectively segregated by social
presentation of gender, not by anatomical sex.  How the Imperium handles
this is what I\'m wondering.  One single facility that everyone uses,
all-are-equal-before-the-porcelain-emperor?  One restroom for Imperial
citizens and one for non-citizens?

I believe that IG doesn\'t have anyone that controls there website 
currently.  That is why it hasn\'t been updated in 6 months.

I have a better solution. Why not do up a JTAS website of our own. 
There are several very smart and highly motivated individuals on the 
list.  Let\'s get Marc\'s blessing and do are own electronic magazine 
on the web.  Heaven knows we have the talent on the list to do it.

I propose a new thread to discuss it.

But it *didn\'t* grab *me*. The third time they\'ve done that bloody airlock

Perhaps my players have spent too long in restaurants.... it just had too

The main reason that I would like to see IG maintain it - at least to the point of
providing the material and editing - is maintain consistancy with their future
plans.  That, and they already have an investment in the internet namespace, the
basic web design, and have hardware installed (a gig of so of website space beats my
10 MB anyday!)

I\'ve toyed with proposing administering the website myself (it can be done nicely
from a remote site as well as a local console - with the right setup) but time is a
real issue with me.  That and...well...I know HTML, I can throw together a website
and keep it running, but it will never be as fancy as some of the sites I\'ve seen on
the webring.  (Of course, it will _load_ quickly!  :)  Has anyone jumped at the offer
that went out last week about maintaining the site?

An early JTAS Bestiary entry is the Reticulan parasite, based on the

<big honkin\' snip2>

My problem with Alien3 (besides the acting, the blocking, and the storyline
logic) was that it basically invalidated almost all of the heroics of the
second movie. Everything that was fought and suffer for, thrown out the
window. Sure, it\'s Lovecraftian, but it was just kind of a letdown for a
movie.

ObTrav: Sadistic referees, how many times have you done this?

Have two or three of the PCs survive an adventure at the cost of the
self-sacrifice of all the other PCs, only to start the next adventure with:
"Okay, everyone roll up new characters -- you all died in coldsleep. Except
for you, Sigourney; your character survived, but has been impregnated by a
parasitic alien. Oh yeah, let\'s make them all condemned criminals too."

You\'ve *almost* got it!

Here\'s a nice space opera idea...

\\handwave on

Make the nearby particles, virtual particle pairs forming from the vacuum
foam..or in other words, the aether.  ;->

The "thruster" is actually a screw drive that interacts with the zero-point
force creating a energy deficient behind the ship displacing the ship\'s
mass forward.  The other masses in the universe soon even out the area of
disturbed vacuum, but for a short while there is a "wake", a pucker in
space-time behind the ship.

As the ship continues to accelerate, the half-life of the virtual particle
pairs forming ahead of the ship extend due to the energy imbalance being
formed.  At some level of velocity, the particles last long enough to
interact with the physical material of the hull and more importantly the
screw itself.  Resistance and friction heating now quickly bring the ship
to it\'s top-end speed.

So, does our Aethereal screw violate any laws of conservation?  Yea,
verily!  ;-> OTOH, I said it was a space opera idea.  

Besides, handwave-handwave, momentum *is* conserved..the momentum gained by
the ship is pulled from the vacuum where it is spread across all the matter
of the entire universe.  Energy conservation?  Absolutely!  It comes from
the massive energy bank of the vacuum.  

\\handwave off

Set accelerations at whatever your game needs:  1-6g for orthodox
Traveller, several hundred for more "fast paced" games.  Make energy
requirements depend on the mass and increase the energy needed as you
accelerate, and put material top-end velocities down around 1% of c and let
material/design improvements over several TL\'s increase that to only 2 or
3% of c, and you take out the the .1c rock, too!

How does *that* sound? ;->

In Iain Banks\' _The Player of Games_ (which I *highly* recommend, along
with all his other SF), there occurs a humanoid starfaring civilization
with three genders -- two corresponding roughly to Terran \'male\' and
\'female\', and a third \'apex\' sex with reversible genitalia which basically
mediates between them in any fertile (extended) sex act.  They had four
restrooms in their public places...males, females, apices, and aliens.

This setup got me thinking about why different facilities were needed.
The apices would presumably be \'plumbed\' enough like either males or
females to use one of their facilities, so it was clearly being done for
social segregation reasons rather than \'engineering\' ones.  Come to that,
while urinals do provide very slightly more efficient access for males,
the fact that we all get by just fine with unisex bathrooms in our homes
demonstrates that gender-segregating restrooms is a purely social
phenomenon.

What\'s more, any conceivable being should be able to dump solid and/or
liquid waste given nothing more than a flat spot of ground (or a place to
hang, or fly, or whatever); this insistence on seats for defecating (e.g.)
is a recent and localized innovation of some Western cultures.  Thus, an
Imperial starport might offer \'male\' and \'female\' restrooms for the use of
humans, and those beings whose plumbing and social roles split along
similar gender lines -- Aslan and Vargr, notably.  Some effort might be
made to produce fixtures serving all such races reasonably well.  In
addition, a third \'others\' restroom would be supplied in which stalls of
various sizes would center on a simple sloped hole in the floor, with
various bars along the walls and ceiling of the stall for convenience in
\'squatting\' or the equivalent.

Less wealthy establishments wishing to offer restroom facilities to a
variety of races might save money by having *only* \'other\'-style
restrooms, on the theory that everyone can use them, even if it won\'t be
optimally comfortable.

Finally, cosmopolitan outfits like the Traveller\'s Aid Society (at its
major facilities) might show off by having separate restroom facilities
for a wide variety of species, subdivided by gender or other relevant
category.  Some of these facilities might be used only once or twice a
year, but the entity involved will surely appreciate the luxury of
\'correct\' fixtures.

It\'s a 48 meter long, 6 meter diameter particle accelerator that puts out
two point three gigajoules or baby waby particles going very wery wery fast.

The tuuuuube is surrounded by eleven point five gigajoules worth of
accu-accumulators. They take up fifty seven point five cubic meters, mass
one hunnerd fifteen tons and cost five hunnerd seventy thousand credits.

It\'s got a three hunnerd thousand killlllllometer beaaaam pointer, which
takes up ten cuuubic meters and weighs ten tons and costs one million credits.

It neeeds five peeeeeeople to aim it and stuff, and they each get a
terminal terminal terminal. Thiiiirty five cuuubic meters, one ton and
Fiiiiive thousand credits. Thats assuming you have a niiiiiice modern
computer or three. If you have nasty clunky ones like thoooose naaaasty
people in Puchasing make us use, you might neeeed more people *pout*.

Power comes form battery-watteries, coz weeeee reckon that you shouldnt
build engines you wont need most of the time, coz then things cost too
much. And accounting say weeeee need to save money coz leeeeegals keep
billing their new cars to us. Weeeee reckon they\'ve started blowing them up
on purrrpose, just to get us into trouble. And they\'ve been putting meson
screens on them.

So weee put enough batteries to provide five hunnerd seventy five megawatts
per second for one hour on it. That is five hunnerd seventy five cubic
meters, weighing 1150 tons and costsing two point eight seven five
megacredits. 

All up, it takes up 2035 cuuuuubic meters, twenny three hunnerd tons and
costs one hundred and forty and a half megacredits. Surface area is twenny
eight point two seven square meeeeeters. Two thousand and thirty five
cuuuubic meters is one hunnerd forty six displacement tons.

The particle-warticles have enough weet bix to go for one million
kilometers before they break up, and do two hunnerd forty damage to
anything they hit.

Coz our batteries have lots lots lots of power, you can fire it every
twenny seconds till you run out of juuuuuice in the batteries, which takes
one hour. Weeeee reckon if you can\'t hit whatever you are shooting at in
one hunnerd and eighty shots, then yoouuuuu shouldnt get to play with
niiiiice toys.

Your Loving cousin,

Ditzie

More scary stuff from the Famile, assuming I am right in saying that a

More than "somewhat smaller". Researchers have found that at least
during the spring/summer months, the main staple of the wolf diet is
*field mice*.

I don\'t know about any soyurcebooks, but I can point you at some
non-fiction and fiction that deal with it.

Non-fiction: The book that pretty much started it all is by Eric
Drexler. I *think* the title is "Engines of Creation" but I may be way
off base. But doing a search for the author should get you something
useful. 

Fiction: "Diamond Age" by Neal Stephenson.

Half right. You got the title right, but the author was A.E. Van Vogt. 

Also, I think that there was more than a hint of Coeurl in there as
well (which btw was *definitely one of the influnces for the Star Trek
episode fans refer to as "The Incredible Salt Vampire" :-)

And both Ixitl, and Coeurls would make lovely things to let your
players discover the hard way. Consider "superdense" to be the "hull
metal" that was so important in both stories, and you are pretty much set.

I\'d say we call it "cultural/social" and thus up to local policy.

At a guess, facilities frequented by offworlders will at least have
private "stalls". Then even if you are having both sexes in one
facility, you don\'t have as many problems.

Oh yeah, were you aware that there were urinals for *women*, In fact,
several of the designs used for men these days started out as designs
for women (basicly, if it has that "trough" section that sticks out a
foot or so, it may be a "female" design).

Or it is the Game Master, who leads the group through the world ...

Its time to put my custard onto this. In my view (remember this before 
flaming) Traveller consists of three main parts:

1. The Game Mechanics and Rules - as die rolling conventions, character 
generation and task systems, world generation systems and building 
starships. This would make the main difference between CT, MT, TNE, T4 and 
GURPS:Traveller.

2. The Technology - this is the point where \'explanations\' for the rules 
occur: no, you can\'t travel faster than one week per jump. yes you can 
fire high-energy plasma against to your enemy. no, you can\'t beam down to 
the planet surface. yes, there is a fire-breathing dragon, because he\'s 
spitting napalm from his nostrils ...

3. The History - one thing I like most in Traveller. You have got an 
Imperium that not only consists of some ruled NPCs, there is this 
incredible big canon behind it that travels back some 300,000 and forth 
another thousand years (from the point of milieu:0) Some feel this 
canonhas gotten too big sometimes, but I think you can find much 
adventure hooks only looking at this. I was expecting much of this when 
the T4 Rules Book announced more material about other Milieus, even the 
Ancients war, which I miss till now, as T4 seems to concentrate on M:0 at 
the time. But that\'s another thread. 

What makes a session now a TRAVELLER session aside from being some other?
My view is, that the History along with the Tech makes it. The Game 
Rules, as was written in more than one Trav Book, may be changed, for 
play\'s sake.

Another point I like in Traveller: You can take nearly all situations 
into the Traveller scenario by adjusting them a little bit (as well as 
taking Traveller adventures out to other Gaming Systems, q.e.d.)

I\'ll tell you how I prepare for my sessions: I take a video cassette to 
my VCR and look a movie from my library. I get some neat ideas when 
watching TV or going to the cinema. Some examples of Movies that inspired me:

John Carpenter\'s Assault on Precinct 13 - This one nearly fits into 
Traveller without change - you only have to change weapons (maybe) and Names.

The Money Pit (with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long) - My Scout wants to refit 
his ship; now guess what happens ...

Die Hard - An embassy will be taken hostage but not of the reasons the 
hostagers say. I expect to be a part of my group in there when this 
happens ...

Poltergeist - The last session my group had an encounter with a ghost - but 
if they find out, they will see it completely fits into the Traveller 
Universe. The basic idea came from the non-SF Drama \'House of Cards\' (with 
Kathleen Turner and Tommy Lee Jones). I stripped also The X-Files, Carrie 
and A Chinese Gost Story for some scenes of this Adventure - and my 
group nearly behaved like the Psi-Factor OSIR Corps when they came into 
this house ... but not when they ran out.

The before mentioned Chamax-Plague/Horde Adventure is, looked at it 
nearer, an adaptation of Alien/Aliens for Traveller. 
\'Nomads of the World-Ocean\' bears similarities to \'Dune\'
\'Murder on Arcturus Station\' is like Agatha Christie in third Imperium.

So this has gotten rather longish, but to say what I wanted to say, the 
feeling Traveller has to me is this of playing nearly every SF (or even 
non-SF) scenario in a world, that nevertheless has its own flavor.

Hope this didn\'t bother you

Allen Shock wondered about moving adventures from other
games into the Traveller universe, either by rules, by
setting, or both.

I\'d recommend the "2010: Odyessy 2" module.  Was it by 
TSR?  Anyhow, it has reasonable deckplans for both ships
(it looks like the Discovery is a 500td ship), and the
plot line\'s not too bad.  One might not even have to push
the year out too much (just enough so that the players
won\'t immediately recognize the scene), and set it in
Milieu E:21.  Have a large Earth corporation (heck, you
don\'t have to make it Earth... could be a Core world in
M0!) lose control of a nonjump ship while it explores a
gas giant -- oh by the way, did we mention that it has a
reeeal small crew complement?  Heh, we put in some new
AI circutry for semiautonomy... heh heh, wonder what

If I had a computer at home, I would love to keep up the IG website like 
the call for a volunteer from a few days ago.  But I don\'t.  I\'ve been 
keeping up my corporate site for a year now, but don\'t have the means to 
do IG "not on company time".  And I\'m experimenting with some new 
software for it...

I agree with doing our own JTAS.  What a great idea!  Sign me up!

I agree. I would think that the variations in this area would be as 
endless as any other cultural/social biases that different cultural 
groups would have. I wouldn\'t think that there would be any sort of 
\'Imperial standard\' imposed, even in starports. The design and 
construction of most of those starports will be local in origin, 
especially in M0 as planets are only beginning to join into the 
Imperium.

I\'d agree to this, too, though what you find inside that stall may 
give you pause for a moment. Remember Crocodile Dundee II when faced

I thought it was freakin\' GREAT.  It was the best device in any
suspense/adventure film this decade!  For all its gritty realism (tm), we
don\'t see enough reality, like "hard work doesn\'t pay" and "heroics lead to
death".  The heroics of the second movie weren\'t invalidated by the third;
they were affirmed -- IMO.

An extremely refreshing change from the lean & mean & photogenic Space
Marines, I thought...  yeah, the Traveller Adventure "Prison Planet" was
one of my faves, too.

Or perhaps Standard Imperial Interstellar Culture thinks that privacy

the gender of onlookers is irrelevant? <G>

I _hadn\'t_ seen these... didn\'t know that the drag king cabal was quite so
far along towards world domination.  Soon, nothing will be able to stop us!
<cackle>^H^H^H^H^H <chortle>.

There\'s also those little funnel devices they sell at hiking/camping stores
to let women urinate standing up; forget what they\'re called again, but
that\'s okay, since this is far off-topic... wait, no: they\'re travelers\'
aids, aren\'t they?  Whew.

How do you think the Imperium proper would handle it (for example, in

I like this idea, a lot.  \'Specially since those long-unused facilities are

The acting was probably some of the best in the Alien series, in my opinion.
Now as far as invalidating the heroics of the second movie...  Hell, people
die pointlessly and needlessly every day.  Accidents take lives.  And instead
of just having Newt and Hicks (the two people closest to Ripley) and have
Ripley walk around like nothing had happened, they built her character into
something different.

I don\'t think its Lovecraftian as much as it is stark and terrible, which is
what the Alien series started out with in the first place.

IKWYM. Some of those rooms are *huge* - bridges where the captain is so 
far from the astrogator he needs a telescope to see him (well, almost), 
stateroom suites big enough to fit a scout/courier in...

On a ship, space *is* at a premium - the bigger the ship, the bigger the 
drives you need to move it, and the more it costs.

I am aware of this, but seeing as it looks like GRUPS Traveller is 
going to be one of their major releases (they\'re doing a sub-line 
with it), I think that the\'ll do some in-house stuff to come out 
concurrent with the release.  And if you;re going to do a traveller

I just picked up FASA\'s "Graduation Exercise", which was
written for Star Trek.  It\'s about a group of Klingon
cadets who, for a final assignment, are charged the task
of recovering a downed agent on a border world.

The world itself is nasty, being in the midst of an ice
age, with inhospitable local animal life and a horrid
little virus in the water.  Even worse than that, the
agent has been captured by Romulans, who have established
a secret base there in order to develop a special serum
using local flora, following the indications inscribed on
a Preserver artifact.

Ok, you get the idea.

The Traveller version would go like this:

A group of Aslan are enrolled in the Tiyhekhou branch of 
the Imperial Marines in the Lunion subsector of the Spinward
Marches, and during their final year they are charged with
recovering a downed agent on Penkwar, near the Sword Worlds.

Penkwar       2128 X978310-1    Lo Ni           R  320 Im M0 V

Nasty world, mad animals, sneaky viruses, etc.

....and, of course, the Sword Worlders have established
a military research base, to investigate the creation of some
super-anagathic or battle drug or psi booster using a local 
virus, local flora, and the instructions from an Ancient 
pharmacological artifact.

This sound good?

Preliminaries:

Determine the setting, situation, range to the enemy, environment (vac, zero-

	Using that determine the
		Range between the parties.
		Initiative.
	Determine if the battle will be on 
Basic range bands (simple situations)
Bands with equal ranges (15 meters) outdoors
Squares with 1.5 meters  indoors

Combat
	Combat round consists of
		Each character may move or act (shoot, etc)
		Each character may act (if he didnt before) or move (if he didnt before).
	At the end of the round everyone may change status (up/down).

Continue until the battle is over.

Details
Every task should be defined (rather than hinted at)
Every action should be defined (shown on a table) with details on what can and
cant be done (ie, you cant aim fire while crawling; you cant evade while
lying down still; you cant swordfight while running).
Charts spelling all of this out for easy reference.

Better definition of how weapons hurt people (more than just hits). For
example, how do burns work, radiation, bright flashes (to blind), loud bangs
(to deafen). Sonics, etc.
Addressing environmental injuries cold, heat, 

Adding a weapon card (so we dont have to look up the weapon stats every time)
that specifically details the difficulty at various ranges, and the damage
done at those ranges. A specific aimed fire DM for the weapon. Data on
reloading and reloading time.

More detail on Heavy Weapons and how they operate.
More detail on Artillery and how it operates (for example, only a Forward
Observer can direct Artillery).

This is basically a synopsis of a set of charts I am creating for T4.1.

The question to ask is (1) How are sales?  and (2) How are expenses.

Sales;

I asked the proprietor at the Compleat Gamer on Massachusetts Ave in
Boston.  He said "Traveller is my best selling Science Fiction Role Playing
Game.", Specifically better than that Babylon thing.  Now, I\'m not saying
this is a scientific or financial analysis, but you hafta go with anecdotal
evidence sometimes.

Another game store (Excalibur Hobbies, Malden MA) Had ordered one of
everything according to the kid behind the counter, and had sold all but a
few of that order.

In both stores the product had good shelf space, both in terms of placement
and quantity.

More products are released each month, taking more space on shelves,
attracting more buyers (a supported product with lots of supplements seems
to me to be more likely to be bought by someone looking for a game they can
play for awhile...as opposed to the many games I\'ve seen with just one-two
products).

Expenses;

The business is (seems to be) being run (effectively) out of Sweetpea\'s
office.  I don\'t know if IG is paying rent to SPE or not (probably not).
Creative work is done by independents and there is no rented space/office
anywhere else.  This is a major expense avoided or at least reduced.  I
believe that "Anne" at SPE is "Running" IG by which I mean answering the
phone, assembling products and submitting them for printing.  IF that is
the only "real" salary, great.  More likely there is a salary for Tim
Brown, someone who has other projects (I think) and would probably be
getting part of a salary rather than full time.  As a long-time game maker
he knows there is not a big payoff in these endevours.

Printing costs are probably pretty high, but product pricing is certainly
sufficient to cover this cost.  since they seem to hav ea relationship with
a specific printer they are probably to the point where they are getting a
good price-break deal (as opposed to the situation if we saw a different
print format every product).  Plus using the same material (cover stock
etc) gets more efficient over time.

Salaries, printing, rent, all under control.  Where\'s the problem?  I can
see a hit coming when IG has to refund all the "Citizens" or JTAS
subscribers.  If this is done in product the hit will be a bit less
cashwise, but I also don\'t think this will be a company-killing expense
(salaries are usually the highest single budget item at an IG like company).

I find this a bit foolish as a discussion.  IG *is* producing Traveller.
Gurps Traveller will, according to the *publisher* be accorded the same
level of production as any other GURPS product; a few sourcebooks and
supplements.  Traveller as produced now by IG is an entire *line* with many
different kinds of sourcebooks.  There is no indication that SJG will ever
try to duplicate this kind of coverage.

Phil, You\'re being one-sided.  IG has messed up a few products.  They have
also produced some excellent products.  I really like CSC, The Naval
Architects Manual (although it was different from my expectations)
Emperor\'s Arsenal, Anomolies, Pocket Empires, Psionic Institutes, and
others.  All were produced *relatively* error free.  There have been a few
products with nasty debilitating errors; The Milieu 0 sourcebook/UWP
listings, Starships (what is it about Traveller starship books - remember
Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium?) with its yukky deckplans.  There
have also been a few products receiving only partly justified badmouthing
here, Emperors Vehicles is quite usable as far as it goes.  Weapon stats
must be figured seperately, Tech Levels  missing are a bitch for certain
purposes, but altogether, I have photocopied the "cards" and am using them
actively in a campaign.

The same company that you are badmouthing *published* what you call "the
best stuff that has EVER been written for Traveller."

*Some* of their business practices leave much to be desired.  You (and the
previous poster on this thread) seem to believe these errors or lapses of
professionalism are automatically going to bring down the company.  If you
are going to hold them responsible for their errors (and I think you
should) balance this with praise or consideration for their
accomplishments.  If I had never bought a thing from IG I would think, from
your post, that they had never produced anything worth having.  I know
better and so do you and Phil


I know Allen was around (on the TML I Mean) when GDW had failed and IG
hadn\'t started (I\'m not sure about Phil), and during that "long night" I
remember the horrible feeling that Traveller *never* would be produced
again.  It *is* being produced now, by a company capable of staying in
business and outputting good products (and bad).  I don\'t think we should
blindly buy their products.  I do think we should support the company by
buying their *good* products and providing fair analysis in public forums
like this one (and the GURPS list).

I do *not* think we should be anticipating their demise and possibly
spreading rumors of such based on a hunch or opinion.

Yeah, the bridges seem much too big, the fixtures are enormous.

Really, it\'s the scales used in NAM that bother me, or rather the lack
of a consistent scale..well *really* it\'s the fact they didn\'t including
*any* scaling information at all! 

For example, if the squares on the Bridges are 1.5 meters, the chairs
are almost 1.5 meters wide and the workstations are 6 meters across, and
this was on a cramped bridge too! Even if the squares represent 1 meter,
the workstations are still *way* to big. OTHO, maybe the squares are
scaled in feet, the text does refer to 5 feet here and so many feet
there.  

I liked the text, I liked the deckplans, I\'ll try to "borrow" as much as
I can from them, but the lack of stated scales on the drawings or the
use of a consistent scale throughout is a major flaw..IMO.

 Just as a counter - at my FLGS they are very pleased with T4 sales.

I would feel better if IG introduced other products tho\'...  I think that if they
had several lines running (and hopefully, successful), it would allow for a little
better quality screening on the individual products.

Good cinema.  Bad roleplaying.  The two are not always equivalent.

Alien 4 reversed it.  It might have made good roleplaying, and it would
have made a great comic book, but it was mediocre cinema.

Most starships I have seen are grossly overpowered for their normal needs,
but underpowered for peak combat efficiency. This is a problem, becasue
power plants are expensive.

As an example, let us take our "standard" 250 megajoule 20% efficiency
combat laser.

It has a theoretical rate of fire of one shot every 10 seconds, as per FFS
laser rules.

To provide this rate of fire, you need to deliver 125 megawatts per second
for ten seconds to the laser\'s accumulator banks.

Therefore, if your ship has 125 megawatts of power plant dedicated to
lasers, then it is a waste having more than one 250 mj anti-ship laser.
Point defense lasers should be optimised for point defense ie 35-50 kkm
range at TL12. Their intermittent but high power demand requires a "peak"
power output capability best provided by quick-release batteries - 10 m3 of
36s discharge batteries will provide 250 MW of power for 36 s at TL11, at a
cost of KCr 40 and a mass of 20t. At TL12, 10m3 of 36s batteries will
provide 375 MW of power, at a mass of 20t and a cost of KCr 50.

Now, the second half of the argument is the jump drives and the maneuver
drives. Somewhat obviously, you wont need to use both of them at once,
except for the 20 minutes or so the ship is preparing to enter jumpspace.

A 100 dt ship doing a jump-1 requires 25 megawatts of power per second.
This is enough to power 25 m3 of thruster plates 10 000 kN worth. 10 000 kN
will push a 1000t at one gee. Clearly, a jump-2 starship massing 10 tons
per dt will have enough power to propell itself at 2Gs. 

Therefore, an unarmed starship that plans to be at rest on jump should not
need to allocate power beyond this level.

If a ship plans to maneuver while making the jump, then it will need
batteries sufficient for those 20 minutes. At TL11, batteries that produce
25 megawatts of power for 24 minutes will take up 20 m3, mass 40t and cost
KCr80. An investment in slower-release batteries is worthwhile (25
megawatts for 1 hour masses 50t, takes up 25m3 and costs KCr 100), as the
other 40 minutes of battery power will provide a "boost" capability of 25
megawatts for the main power planet. TL12 reduces this to 16.7 m3, 33t and
KCr 83.5.

In summary, a starship designer should look very carefully on when power
will be needed before allocating ship space and mass to fusion power
plants. Batteries may well be a more efficient solution.

I hate to say it, but I\'m starting to feel the same way.  I went to my local game
store today to try and peek through the NAM.  They didn\'t have it.

In fact, all they did have was:

2 copies of Gateway
2 copies of Fire, Fusion, and Steel
1 copy of the T4 softback main book
1 copy of Aliens Archive
1 copy of First Survey

And, that\'s it.  I didn\'t ask, but you can tell by what they stock that it is not
selling that well for them.  This was sitting right next to the Star Wars game,
which had a whole shelf devoted to it.

I went to another store and did get to browse through the NAM.  I was surprised as
it looked like a good book to buy.

Funny.  In the beginning, a year ago, I would buy all T4 stuff as soon as it hit
the shelves THEN I would take it home and look at it.

I feel like I\'ve been burnt too many times now.  I haven\'t bought Gateway, EV, or
the NAM.  The jury\'s still out.

I\'ve even thought of switching to Star Wars, and the only thing stopping me is that
I\'ve got two years invested in this campaign.

Flipping though the NAM, it did look like a good book, yet I didn\'t leave the store
with it.  I bet many other Traveller players are feeling the same way.

Now with the JTAS no longer around (after only 2 issues) and the web site not
updated in six months, it really makes you think about what\'s going on at IG.

I hope they make it.  I really do.  I want Traveller to be around.

But, I gotta tell ya.  I\'m tired of being disappointed in Traveller product.  I
picked up some of the Star Wars stuff, and it just doesn\'t compare.  The West End
Games material beats the heck out of the IG stuff--in quality, design, content, and
especially aesthics.

I\'m getting to the point where I don\'t feel good buying Traveller stuff anymore,
and I don\'t like it.  But, I don\'t have any fight left in me.  I\'m tired of pulling
for them, hoping the stuff will get better.  I\'m discouraged.

From just flipping through the NAM, it looks like things are getting better, but I
can\'t help but think that it might be too late for a lot of folks.

Much too conservative, rampant technological conservatism!  ;->

At least, you could mention the "Sheinal", usable by men or women. It comes
with a funnel attached to a tube, disposable sanitary liners and takes up
no more space than a urinal. 

But the real answer is that in the future, like on TV, characters never
have to use the restroom...except to hold conversations, change clothes, or
escape someone.

  Just imagine - a traveller of one of the rarer races getting in to
an A starport, and heading off to the nearest set of comprehensive

In my campaign, washrooms are not segregated by gender, nor by race. Public
facilities have one "room" for this purpose, if it\'s even present at all.

This is the reason why the Imperium doesn\'t bother with multiple restrooms in
my universe (IMU). What if a race had four, five or more sexes? It quickly
becomes cumbersome. The Imperium adopts the attitude that, if you don\'t want
to use the public room, nobody\'s forcing you. Of course, using the sidewalk
instead may be frowned upon ...

Exactly. To extend that a bit further, I\'d say that it is a cultural trait
that we need privacy for those functions and not for others. There are
probably cultures out there in the galaxy for which the expulsion of waste
matter is done as a shared experience with the family, while the intake of
fuel (i.e. food) is done in private.

within a system ?

It strikes me that settlement costs should be reduced by 90% for insystem
colonisation, and that worlds within a system should be able to spend money
on each other at 90% efficiency at TL10, at 75% after TL8 and at 33% for TL7.

Secondly, the Finished Goods Trade should be based on the relative size of
the trade zone to your GDP. This gives a bigger bonus to small worlds
(which is good and, to me, logical) but doesnt raise the GDP of a big world
30% for colonising half a dozen balls of rock with colonies of 500 people
each.

Finished Goods Trade is still critical to an Empire\'s development, but it
means that big (billion plus population) worlds will have to contact other
big worlds to get the advantages.

Thirdly, worlds only conduct Resource Trade within a trading area. If
no-one in a trade area has infrastructure in excess of resources, then
resource doesnt happen due to a lack of demand.

Finally, base infrastructure and starport costs on population. When
population increases so as the UWP code changes, reduce the infrastructure
and starport by one level.

Starports now cost (Pop*100) RU for an A starport, (Pop*20) for a B
starport, (Pop*12) for a C starport and (Pop) for a D starport in RU.

This reflects the fact that every time your population increases tenfold,
your starport is too small and you now need to buy another one. Similarly,
you need to keep investing in infrastructure, or it wont support the
increased load of your new, higher, population on it.

To improve a starport, you need to have one of the next lower category (eg
build E, then D, then C, then B then A).

At the referees option, a world could build a small high-quality facility,
and a larger main facility (eg a TL9 pop 8 world builds an A4 starport for
building and maintaining it\'s small fleet of interstellar vessels and a
larger B8 facility for supporting it\'s large fleet of insystem vessels and
maintaining visiting traders).

An Ax class starport can build 10^(x+1) tons of vessels a year, with a
maximum size of 100*(x^2) tons.

From a scientific and *practical* perspective, it *has* to be at long
range. Given the speeds reached by any sort of decent drive, and the
difficulty of turning around given anything *resembling* real physics
for movement, and you get long ranges.

The ships won\'t be *close* for more than *seconds* unless they are both
on the same course. And that\'s *not* a common situation.

At 1 g you reach 36 km/sec in an hour. And in that time you cover
almost 65 thousand km. At that speed ships on an "intercept" course
cover 1000 km in under 14 *seconds*. And it would take them a couple of
*hours* to turn around to make another "pass".

So divide your "reasonable" weapons range by 1000 km, and multiply by
13.7777... seconds. That\'s how long the ships would be "in range" of
each other. 

Now note that this is for ships moving *slowly*. At 1 g it takes less
than 2 and a quarter hours for a ship to cover 1 light second from a
standing start (if it is accelerating all the way). And it\'ll be moving
77.5 km/sec at the end.

What was meant was that to have prolonged combat at short range, the
ships would have to *match* courses. And that pretty much takes mutual
consent, or ships with similar drive ratings starting from the same
point. 

Consider what happens if a 2 G ship chases a 1g ship that has an hours
head start. By the time the 2g ship catches up, it\'ll be moving a *lot*
faster than the other ship. So it\'d have to accelerate for a while,
then *decelerate, so as to be at the same point the other ship will be
at and moving with the same velocity. Only trouble is, ifthe other ship
spots them decelerating, it can decelerate too in which case they\'ll
*again* pass at high speed. Or it can thrust off sideways, requiring
course corrections. 

Try working out the math yourself. Or just play it out using Mayday. It
*ain\'t* easy.

Airplanes and ships can turn by using the medium they are moving thru
(air or water) to help *redirect* their velocity. Spaceships *can\'t*.
They have to change their vectors the hard way. This makes things a lot
more complicated if you have to get within a few thousand km before you
can use your weapons.

Think of what air combat would be like if a fighter had to be within
100 feet to attack another fighter...

Surte. Traveller ships (mostly) *don\'t* have to conserve fuel. But that
means they are mostly moving like a bat out of hell. Which means that
either you have to be able to shoot from a *long* ways away, or you
have to accept attacks that last a minute or less, followed by hours of
manuevering to get into position to make another attack.

That may be interesting to some folks (I wouldn\'t mind playing a few
such sessions out myself), but it\'s going to make most players irritated.

So you need weapons that can be used at "typical" ranges.

Its only a "holdover" in the sense that the *physics* haven\'t changed.

If you want drives that can boost at 1 or more gees for hours at a
time, you need weapons that have *long* ranges, or you get the combat
situation I mentioned above. 

I\'m not being *arrogant*. I *am* getting a bit frustrated that you
haven\'t actually sat down and tried to figure out *how* things will
actually work out in the game.

Very nice illustrations with detailed chairs & stuff (compare to anything
offered by GDW, really GDW maps generally sucked). The authors generally
has little or no comprehension about the Traveller universe, its more like
a mix between Star Trek and Star Wars. The deckplans use different scaled
grids (some seem to be 1m grid and others are more like 1.5m or even 2m)
The scales aren\'t labeled so its anybodys guess. Use the length of beds as
measures as these tend to be about 2m for humans.

The illustrators are to 20th century Earth (US) centric. Exercise bikes and
weightlifting stuff smell a tad low tech for me.

Despite all the shortcomings NAM will probably be the only T4 book I\'ll
ever use as it is nice to have when you need a map of something in a hurry
(bar, coference room, mess hall etc). The maps could be used for hotels etc
just as well as inside starships so I\'ll probably use them.

Heinlein, "Space Cadet"... The Venerians only recognized privacy for
the purpose of eating. And the term was almost never used. Instead
there were various circumlocutions used to describe "the act" (much
like Westen culture and fucking).

Picture the fun you\'d have if your ship was hired by the Imperial
government to carry a diplomatic delegation from a race like that.
You\'d have to put partitions in the mess room and rig some sort of
"doors" for the cubicles thus formed...

God help you if any of the crew chews gum or tobacco....

You heard that story too, huh?

To bring this *somewhat* back on topic, travellers are going to
encounter some *strange* foods out there, even with pure human
cultures.

The above brought to mind the Roman delicacy of dormice in honey. Other
"nummies" are things like fresh blood and milk mixed (An african tribe
whose name I forget use this as a staple). Various insects (but *not*
cockroaches, they have something that people are pretty much
universally allergic to).

What\'s the problem? Other than the fact that heating bourbon wastes

Hey, *I* would at least try it.

What I have trouble convincing myself to try is kumiss (fermented milk,
preferably *mare\'s* milk). 

ps. Have the Sayat tried offering that drink to any K\'kree? If so, is
there film? :-)

And don\'t forget appearance!  Seriously.  For all the toasting Chris Foss
gets on the TML for his T4 artwork (I\'m not a big fan either), it\'s well
done, as game art goes - that is, it\'s competently drawn/painted, colorful,
action-filled, etc., and is much more professional looking than a lot of
the game art out there.  Sure, a T-whatever grognard will react "This isn\'t
Traveller art!", but to a newcomer with no well-formed opinions about what
is or isn\'t Traveller art, and with a few bucks with which to buy a game,
it\'s quite attractive.  More people who DIDN\'T know about Traveller have
probably picked it up because of the artwork than veteran Traveller players
have dropped it because they couldn\'t bear the artwork... Every gameshop
owner to whom I\'ve spoken in the Wash DC area has (with one exception, who
had no opinion) cited good artwork as a strong suite for T4, at least to
new gamers.

So what you are saying is that you are talking to yourself, but you

In The Gamester Wars (can\'t remember the author) there is a race called 
the Xarn.  They eat through a "feeding tube" appendage, and their food 
is the refuse of others.  So a constant expletive is "xarnfood!" for 
"shit!".  So therefore, the feeding troughs are disgusting to 
human/other races and their breath stinks (makes for interesting 
diplomatic relations/negotiations).  And on top of it all, Xarn are 
highly excitable, and when riled up, tend to regurgitate in a spray that 
gets on most everyone and everything nearby.

But it is one way to get rid of the stuff!

 The Classic Traveller stuff was quite good, actually. No

Well, I am one of those new gamers. I first saw Chris Foss artwork many
years ago, and I thought it was great. Then a few months ago I went to a
RPG store to  look for a SF RPG (I have a fantasy and a horror game
already). Guess what? When I saw the T4 rulebook, I picked it up right
away. I was not disappointed by neither the art nor the game itself. I will
be playing Traveller for a LONG time ...

As for art being "traveller" ... that depends on your personal opinion,
doesn\'t it? I view the Chris Foss art as "traveller" ...

Waxing lyrically to the past. One of the ways you could really soup up a HG
or MT ship was by playing with the power plants. Doing things like putting
in an additional plant for combat ops (much less fuel) could make quite a
difference. IIRC both the Traveller\'s Digest/MTj and Imperial Lines
recommended such an approach for MT.

Not having FFS2 handy, can you opt to avoid putting lifesupport into the
fuel tanks etc? That was another money saver...

There is more than one way to skin an Aslan, sorry, cat. ;-)

My FLGS is suffering from the same affliction.  They\'ve put all Traveller
stuff in the "20% OFF" bins, to try and get it out of their store.

They got burned with the Traveller:TNE drek (with lots of copies still on the
shelf), so I don\'t know if they\'re willing to risk The New Error (T4).

In "Twilight\'s Peak" Ancient loos were phased teleporters built into the
ground which would teleport any material in contact with it a millimetre at
a time.

If you want to stage an adventure at an Ancient research complex I doubt
you could do better than Twilight\'s Peak; Traveller adventure 3. This is an
incredible star-spanning quest tracking a centuries-lost ship across the
Spinward Marches, with the Ancients and hints of the Fifth Frontier War
thrown in for good measure. While the ending is rather contrived, IMHO, it
is still one of my favorites and in many ways the Canonical Traveller
Adventure. You could build an entire campaign around this one adventure.

To me, Traveller art will always have to be the quirky, black and white
line drawings that were in the original TAS magazines.  They may not have
been the best quality, but they either fit _into_ a story, or inspired a
story.  ;^)

All fine ideas... provided they don\'t get bogged down in the same
hellish complexity that the Inner Circle on the TML seem to regard as a
prerequisite for their version of futuristic \'realism\'. One of the great
joys of CT was that you could play with a pencil and a pair of regular
old 6-sided dice. A calculator (the regular kind, NOT A $50 $%&%%^*
SCIENTIFIC ONE) was a luxury, not a necessity. We had a starship design
system you build grav fighters or dreadnaughts with in the early \'80\'s.
I don\'t think that wanting one now is as unreasonable as the uber-geeks
have been telling me.

I\'m a more-or-less starship/vehicle design nut, and have been hanging on
since before this time last year watching T4 unfold and hoping that
something concrete would eventually come of this unwieldy mess. I\'m
writing you briefly to bang the drum for a user-friendly & comprehensive
starship design/combat system like we had when I first started playing
as a teenager.

I was not around on the TML at the time, but I understand that
originally the starship design system for T4 was to resemble High Guard;
then the hard-core T:NE fanatics screamed so loudly that they hastily
turned an about-face and decided to base the tech on the drove-the-
company-that-produced-it-bankrupt and utterly incomprehensible FF&S.
Too, I don\'t quite understand what IG was thinking of when they farmed
out the authorship of their books to a bunch of ultra-hard-core fans. It
was like Lucas handing over creative control of his next movie to a
bunch of no-real-life Star Wars freaks. You have seen the results in a
design system that is so goddam complicated that even THEY can\'t keep it
straight.

I don\'t blame IG for that. I lay the load for the end product squarely
on the people who wrote it, where it belongs. As a technical writer, I
take a dim view of the sorts of world-class inaccuracies and internal
contradictions that have plagued T4\'s (what is it? FOUR, now?)
starship/vehicle design systems -- not one of which is fully compatible
with any other. It is worth noting that Wildstar is one of the few
fan-gurus with any common sense at all; having produced the
(unfortunately also bug-ridden but still eminantly playable) plug & play
QSDS... and he works in tech support at a large firm.

I was heartened to hear that you had your hand back in and were
apparently re-establishing a degree of control over your own game
system. I would like to encourage you to keep it simple and
user-friendly, just as you did originally. The game-geeks and
self-appointed tech-heads will scream and yell and bombard you with
self-important advice regarding the \'realism\' of any of your proposed
changes, because they seem to associate baroque complexity with internal
consistency, but I advise you to stay the course. I have seen your
handiwork, and I have seen theirs. I am pretty sure that I can live with
whatever you come up with. I have a wasted $120, a year\'s worth of
impotent frustration, and two cancelled (military-setting) campaigns
(timed to coincide with the release of Starships and FF&S2) to tell me
that the reverse is not necessarily true.

Give us our old Traveller back... or at least something resembling it.

	I don\'t know abut any cultures in Traveller that eat food in private, but 
the good \'ole K\'kree do EVERYTHING in full view of others, including 
expulsion of waste.

	I\'ve always wanted to do a scene in Traveller where the characters go to

and talks to them while in the midst of "mounting" one of his wives :-)

Twilight\'s Peak has plans and descriptions for an entire Ancient base,
complete with weaponry and warriors.  One of my favourite Traveller
adventures from the Age of Innocence.  Writing from memory here (older
books are packed away during renovations):

The toilets were just patches of floor, with built-in
teleport/disintegrators (either a disintegrator, or a teleport to the
garbage, forget which).  They took off about a millimetre at a time, so
the pile would slowly disappear, as would any player who sat there and
activated it.  Which rather indicates that Droyne produce only solid waste.

Beds were, I believe, anti-gravity.

There were perches in the base, but I think they were in the exercise room.

One of my longer-term projects is to draw the Octagon and Ancient base as
colour deckplans (like I did for Shadows).  As a use-once, I\'ve put it
lower on my list than finishing plans for Space 1889 ships that I can use
many times.  (At the moment, that is just the luxury liner.)  Take a look
at my Shadows plans
(http://www.interlog.com/~dmci104/GamingClub/Traveller/shadows.html) and
let me know if you could actually use an equivalent for the Ancient base. 
Enough votes and I\'ll move it up the priority list!

My.

If you\'d care, I could forward you a few more ways to insult me.  For the
record, I have used FF&S (both versions) with a plain calculator and a
notepad on a moving train.  My current scientific calculator cost $19.95 at
McWohrters.

I am hardly a "hard core TNE fanatic," as you so inelegantly put it, so
please do not generalize.  We did not scream, we pointed out the cons of
such a system, and several people volunteered to do QSDS for free.  along
with SSDS, and later FF&S2.  These were labors of love.  The idea was too
produce systems based on each other so you could choose the level of
difficulty you desire.  I like tinkering with the details, so I use FF&S.
My brother uses QSDS.  Guess which one of us has the engineering degree?

Imperium was probably thinking "thank God, these guys seem to understand
the damn game."  If you don\'t like what we write, write your own!  What
have you submitted?  I\'m proud of my designs in Imperial Squadrons, and am
ashamed of what IG did to their presentation.  Once the holidays are
finished (I work in the travel industry, this is a bad time for out side
projects), I\'m planning on sending the correct versions of all four ships
to the list.

What will you see?  The stats.  Size, crew, performance of drives and
weapons, armor.  *I* do the number crunching to provide a ship that will
stand up to the players when they start asking annoying questions like "how
many galleys on the Battleship?"  (On a Coronation class, there are 25.)

The writers have been forced to work under incredibly short deadlines.
QSDS was produced from scratch in a little under two weeks as I recall.
The producers of FF&S2 complained bitterly about the lack of playtest time.

You are aware that QSDS uses modules designed using FF&S, yes?  Your plug
and play system was built and made consistent by the very gearheads you
seem to despise!

Let me ask.. why don\'t you just make it all up?  "This is a Wundarbar class
Cruiser, it has lot\'s o\'guns, and whatever is convenient for the scenario
I\'m planning."

Well, no.  The pictures rarely, if ever, have anything to do with the actual
contents of the book.  Ships look a certain way, devices look a certain way,
and well, Foss\'s stuff was painted without Traveller in mind.  The pictures
epitomize the flavor of 70s sci-fi, but not Traveller.

There a couple of reasons I wouldn\'t:

1.)  I don\'t own it, and will start running this adventure in about 4 days.
2.)  I don\'t generally run pre-made adventures.  I prefer to write my
adventures with the PCs\' abilities and skills in mind, and also with my own
campaign background in mind.
3.)  I\'m not running a game in the Spinward Marches, I\'m running a game in
Daibei, and the ending will tie in with another major plot-line that has
already been introduced.  (Basically, over 300,000 years ago, the Ancients ran
into another race that was seeking asylum from their overlords.  The Ancients
promised them a world, Harrison,  in what is now the Daibei system, near which
there was an ancient complex.  The terraforming gear that the other race had
sent was never set off, and the human colonists on Harrison accidentally
activated it.  The ancient complex is going to provide clues as to how to stop
the out-of-control terraforming gear, and clues as to the _other_ ancient
race, who the PCs will eventually meet).

My mind had supressed that. Wasn\'t it INSIDE the sensor op area?

In my universe the transponder is built into the active sensor (which all
ship carry by law). When the transponder thingy is lit by active sensor it
sends fin-number etc on the standard microwave frequency which is picked up
by the active sensor. Two ships that meet simply illuminate one another in
a sort of greeting ceremony - this is called "to ping somebody" in spacers
slang. Solomani says this comes from old submariner tradition but the
Vilani insists that it derives from the sound emitted from the console when
a ping is received.
 Scholars still debate this issue at cocktail parties.

Birds\' nest soup is essentially hardened swallows\' drool, I guess.  The
contents of grazing animals\' stomachs and colons is a basic foodstuff in
some places, and a delicacy in others.  Rotting walrus blubber was a staple
in coastal NE Siberia.  Raw wheat flour mixed with (stale, reheated) fish
oil and served in vats was festival food along the American NW coast in
early colonial times.  (Again, shamelessly ripped off for the Sayat.

You\'re right, it boils off a lot of alcohol content, unfortunately.  That\'s

It\'s not that bad.  But I\'m biased -- I\'m allergic to the organic crud
floating around in beer and most wines, so kumiss is the only non-distilled
alcohol I\'ve been able to drink without dire effects.  It definitely leaves
a distinct odor of digestion afterwards... but no worse than beer.

I actually have a couple of Lovecraftian drink recipes, including the
seasonally-appropriate "Nog-Sothoth", if anyone\'s interested...  Not for
the faint of heart or tasteful of palate.

Sayat don\'t invite livestock to diplomatic functions -- much less party

    'body' => 'This is in response to Re:trav combat slow thread but I thought that the
title didn\'t reflect what was being discussed so I renamed it. I understand
what was being said about rushe deadlines concerning the systems. But the
way I see it is that Jay is right all the current systems for ship design
are inadequate. I don\'t think that it is a basic flaw of the systems idea
or intents just in the form of the presentation and ease of use.
I do not believe that it is possible to walk into your local hobby store
and buy a copy of ANY of the design systems with no prior knowledge of
traveller and effectively design a ship. This is due to a myriad of reasons.
I while there may be those that disagree I seriously doubt whether they
have carefully looked at the systems then as if they were trying to use
them for the first time. We all know that essential charts have been left
out or mislabeled or not put anywhere near other related charts in the
design system. All of the systems have failed to offer careful concise and
clearly written explanations of the basic premises that they entail. Much
less a useable flow chart for design. I have yet to be happy with any
designs that I have seen in T4. But at that level I think that my
unhappiness is a reflection also of a starship combat system that has the
same flaws as the design systems themselves. 
  What is really needed is a whole reworking of the starship portion of the
game. Design should follow form. The system should link easily to a
starship combat system  that lends itself to easy play. The basic character
generation system in realitively simple. The skill use system is elagent
and simple. The character combat system is also relatively uncluttered. The
trade and commerce is direct and easy.
All of these require a modicum of tables, common sense, and paperwork. Why
should the spacecraft design and combat system be any different. Part of
the beauty of Traveller is that the system does not get in the way of
telling the stories. All that I want is a Spacesystem that is the same.
Even the maps of subsectors elegantly tell their tales without bogging the
game down. I just recently returned to the sci-fi genre of rpg and
remembered the traveller tha tI had learned to play with all my old high
school buddies. I purchased T4 hoping to see an improved ruleset. I did
except for the ship systems.
   Obviously the game system has changed in many ways since I first played
the game in the late 70\'s and early 80\'s, but the game mechanics all had
the same flavor. I think that is what is missing with the current
hodgepodge of ship rules. I could be happy with any systems as long as it
kept the feel of the game. I don\'t know how to make the multiple ruleset
for ships do that now, but obviously someone should. I think that it is up
to us the players to come up with the right recipe of design and combat
rules to keep the flavor that made traveller the game that it was while
moving forward towards the game it can be.

Now this is just idiotic, and reflects quite badly on you.  Now, I know you\'re
going to say, "Well I don\'t care" but it does.  It sucks to see the criticism
that floats around on this list degenerate into outright insults.

High Guard was a very cool product.  The simplicity is its boon and its curse.
Boonwise, you could make a ship in a very short time.  The downside, you were
tied to the system and had no freedom to break out.  The system was not
consistent with the ground vehicles created, and there was no baseline on
which to measure the technology of the Traveller universe.

>I was not around on the TML at the time, but I understand that
>originally the starship design system for T4 was to resemble High Guard;

I haven\'t been around all too long either, only since the mid-summer or so.
However, from what I can gather  from reading throught digests, this wasn\'t
the case.  I\'m sure I will be corrected if I\'m wrong.  However, the ship
_profiles_ were supposed to be like the old High Guard profiles, if I remember
right.

I think this ground has been gone over a few times already.  FF&S didn\'t drive
GDW into the ground or cause them to go bankrupt.  Unfortunate occurences both
in the industry as a whole and between GDW and TSR served to put them out of
business.

When I got FF&S originally, I had no real higher math background, just high
school math, and I found it extremely easy to use.  No problems whatsoever.
Hardly incomprehensible in my book.

>Too, I don\'t quite understand what IG was thinking of when they farmed

Oh, I see.  Better to farm out the authorship to people who have never even
seen the game in their entire lives?  Not sure exactly what you\'re getting at
here.  Die-hard fans are the perfect resource for a role-playing game.

Hmmm...  Wow.  You sound pretty peeved here.  To me, bitching and moaning
about what vehicle design system a game uses really makes you sound like the
one with no-real-life.  Kind of like the people who write into music magazines
and all they can say is "I think that <name of band> sucks!  They just suck.
Why do you cover such a terrible band in your magazine?  I was thinking about
renewing my subscription, but no way now."

I can keep the design systems straight with no real strain on my otherwise
generally pretty busy life.  Now, don\'t like the systems?  Then don\'t use
them.  I would guess you own High Guard?  If so, then use that instead.
Nobody\'s stopping you.

I use whatever system supports what I need at the moment.  When I need a
vehicle fast, I pull out CSC.  When I want to spend a little more time and
have greater flexibilty, I pull out FF&S2.  No problem keeping those two
straight at all.  I usually default to FF&S2, because I can build a plasma
cannon, a laser turret, a handgun, a grav tank, or a scout ship using the same
book.

Isn\'t this exactly what you\'re doing, just in reverse?  "Ohhhh, I\'ve been into
Traveller longer, I know what\'s right and what\'s wrong here!"  Everyone has
their own opinions, I just think that the way yours is expressed makes you
sound like you\'d got a bug up your butt.  Unable or unwilling to speak
rationally, you result to completely uncalled-for insults for no real apparent
reason.

Seriously, what the hell are you accomplishing here?  I can understand you
having concerns about the future of the game.  I think its safe to say most of
us have a thorn in our sides about one thing or another having to do with T4,
and have a vision for the future of the game.  Most of us don\'t have to resort
to insults to get our points across, however.

I have, and will, stand by FF&S and FF&S2.  Sure, the guns come out a little
heavy, and the vehicles aren\'t absolutely perfect...  But both have their
high-points.  FF&S2 goes into detail about a number of things in the Traveller
universe, and the original gives alternate technologies for use by GMs who
don\'t want to play in the "normal" Imperial campaign setting.  The only
problem with FF&S2 is that there was a major typographical error that was
repeated throughout the book.  However, once you know what the error is (and
its pretty simple to figure out) it takes almost no thought to substitute an *
for every ->|<- funky symbol.

Well, whatever...

Nothing I say is going to stop your moaning, so I guess I better stop wasting
my time.

Well Traveller IS 70s sci-fi wether you like it or not and Mr Miller
probably had images from Foss in his mind when writing the sacred three
books.(Almost every author at the time had covers by Foss; Poul Anderson,
Asimov etc)

The best covers for Traveller stuff was the WBH: Nice looking and actually
depicting gamerelated stuff. The same goes with most covers of the Digest.

A big hand of applause for all the fans who did such magnificent work.

If the will is there, we have a rip-and-read job for articles for a

(Frontier Traders and Lo-Tech SDBs ... anyone taking bets on an Elisabeth

Mercenary Cruisers and Fighters".

Heck, if we are really enthusiastic, then how about we do up a set of
scenarios involving these ships ... a PC party in a Recollet, heading out
for the Lambeth Cluster, with nothing but a 2000 year old datatape and a
hold full of slightly-used, only-one-owner grav tanks ... signed on on a
mercenary ticket helping defend the Kaneshi Empire against a force of
high-tech (1) raiders, allegedly from outside the fledgeling Imperium but
in reality tools of the nefarious IISS.

And by the time they\'re printed, we\'ll have "Money Sinks of the Early Third

OK, big hand for everybody, and Diiitzie\'s frieeeend Michaellllll just

While discussing Alsan honour with my fiance, we came upon a situation
which we can\'t resolve to our satisfaction. She is planning on playing a
female Aslan who owns a free trader with a human crew (the rest of the
PCs). The problem we came up with is this:  According to the Aslan Alien
Module 1 (CT) under the rules of duelling, males and females do not duel
each other. For example, if a male insults a female, the female would
usually ignore the insult as part of male \'ignorance\'. However if the
insult was too great to be ignored, the nearest male member of her clan
will issue a challenge in her place. The problem is, what if there is no
male member of her clan for several subsectors? Would she ignore the insult
given her despite it\'s being \'too great to ignore\' or would she issue a
challenge herself.  Both seem to go against the Aslan code of honour.

Thanks for any ideas you can give us.

Cheers,
Jason

At first I want to say that I like Fossie\'s art, too. But I do not 
consider it as Traveller art, as I got some of the pictures on other 
products than Traveller. (For example, the triangular ship with the 
checkered Hull flying away from the viewer I have got as a title on a 
little book about Spacefaring that a german magazine brought out some ten 
years ago.)

Nevertheless, it seems to me that IG found a way of enhancing the grey 
style of the old Traveller items. Those lined graphics reminded me too 
much of those in Pery Rhodan Magazines, if you know them. I did not like 
them either. But the interior art of T4 by (losthisname...) pleases me.
What I wanted to see back on line are the drawings of  DGP\'s late 
material. The Aslan pictures in the MT Alien Module and the equipment 
illustrations were the best Traveller art for me!

There\'s a story in one issue of XXXenophile (a truly *silly* adult
comic by Phil Foglio) where as some aliens are talking to the Terran
representative, his wife comes in, undresses and proceeds to have sex
with him while he tries to keep a straight face and keep up the
conversation. 

As the aliens leave, one is *very* upset. Not at the Terrans. At a
couple members of his delegation who were "playing around" while he was
talking. If you go back and look you can see a few unimportant gestures
and touches.

In short, with *real* aliens, they may not recognize when you are
having sex and you may not recognize when they are.

Depends on what sort of "damage" you are talking about. For example a
medium sized nuclear warhead turns out to be *lethal* to unshielded
personnel at something like 10-15 *thousand* km!

This is because 90% of the energy output of a nuke is X-rays. In an
atmosphere, they get absorbed within a few meters, heat the air to the
extreme temps you see in the fireballs, and causing the blast wave as
the air expands.

For material damage, you\'ll need to be close enough to absorb enough
xrays to "cook" electronics, or overheat the hull. At *really* close
ranges the X-ray pulse out to cause an outer layer of the hull to
vaporise, doing blast damage to the hiull. But I suspect that the range
required for that is well under a km.

Well, because it does (but not exactly).  That\'s what a transponder* is for.

This is a device that the Imperium requires on all starships.  A transponder
is a simple electronic device that "listens" for active sensor
transmissions.  When it recieves one, it broadcasts a brief message.  This
message contains the ship\'s registration number, and possibly other data.  The
effect of this is to increase the effective range of the active sensor and
provide the identity of all of the ships detected by that sensor.

Thus, a ship or ground station with an operating active sensor can "see" all
of the ships in the area.  If the "additional data" in the transponder
message includes the ship\'s vector, then _all_ ships in the area can know
where each other are, too.

Traffic control and the military assume that any spacecraft not showing a
transponder is engaged in something hostile or (at very least) illegal.
The Imperial Navy has been known to adopt a "shoot first and ask questions
later" policy towards ships in frontier areas that don\'t show a transponder.

In my games, the transponders broadcast the registry number and the ship\'s
vector.  The registry number is coded so that you can tell if the ship is
military, civilian, or foreign, and for civilian ships, a code also
indicates the world where the ship was registered.  Non-military
transponders are checked during a ship\'s annual maintenance.  The
transponder electronics are hooked into the ship\'s flight recorder
system, and are similarly tamper-resistant.

All spacecraft have transponders and a transponder-compatible
active sensor.  Some non-ship objects (such as space stations, navigational
hazards, and inhabited planetoids) also have transponders (the minimum
definition of a class-D starport is a transponder and a patch of bedrock to
put it on).  Traffic control (class-C starports or better) also has a
transponder-compatible active sensor.

Non-military transponders can be turned "off", but the ID and data
transmitted can\'t be changed.  Military vessels (Imperial, local, and
appropriately-licensed mercenary units) are capable of generating any
transponder data they wish to present. 

Black-market transponders that are capable of generating false information
are clearly desirable to smugglers and other criminals.  They are sometimes
available to civilian purchasers.  The installation of such a device would
require specialized tools and knowledge - available by bribing starport
employees, or finding someone who can do the work on the sly.  There are
roumors that subsector-wide or larger shipping corporations (Oberlindes,
Al-Morai, Tukera) have military-style transponders installed on some of
their "special cargoes" ships.


* NOTE that I\'m ignoring the entire T:TNE transponder/virus stupidity.  In
  my games, at least, a transponder is a simple electronic device that
  responds to certain active sensor transmissions.  No silicon lifeforms,
  AI electronics, direct computer access, or other sillyness.

I agree.

The Traveller ship design system has to be 

1. Integrated with the combat system (in the sense that the combat system has
to be understandable so people know what poarts to put in their ship).

2. Chart based, so designers can turn to the information they need and find it
(and understand it).

3. Driven by a checklist, and supported by a usable, user friendly form,

4. Supported by a reasonable format for the ship card / USP so one can
understand what that means, and

5. supported by examples.

It would be best to order one of the main rulebooks.
I would recommend to start with the MegaTraveller Boxed set as this can
be aquired quite cheap nowadays and it contains all the rules and a lot
of background as well.

On the other hand, if you want to be fully compatible (MT is, but only
to a certain degree) with the latest releases by IG, i would recommend
waiting for the New Traveller 4 (Marc Millers Traveller) Rulebook,
version 4.1, which isn=B4 t out yet, release-date undetermined!

And finally, welcome! Always glad to see a new european Traveller!

Throwing a party in a new society, and having the natives eat something 
that the party finds utterly revolting (without going so far as, say, 
dead baby eyes) is a good way to see just how diplomatic they can be as 
they try to say "thanks, no" without either trapping themselves in some 
intolerable lie, or some intolerable faux pas.

I knew when I said that Foss\'s stuff epitomizes 70s sci-fi I was going to get
a response like this :)  While Traveller may be a child of 70s sci-fi, 70s
sci-fi is not Traveller.  What I meant, and I believe I stated was that Foss
drew this stuff years ago.  Very little of it has the flavor of the Traveller
universe, in my opinion.  The giant claws rising up out of the ice-covered
ocean menacing the giant, phallic device is a perfect example.  Technically,
the picture is competent and decent enough, and Foss gets an amazing level of
detail in his stuff.  I just don\'t think its very Traveller.

Since I don\'t have the WBH, nor have I had the opportunity to see it, I can\'t
comment.  My personal favorites for cover art were the little-black books, and
I\'m not kidding.  The covers just look really neat.  I think I like the ones
without the wide band at the bottom better though.

Otherwise, I like the MegaTraveller Ref\'s Manual quite a bit, and the cover
for the TNE\'s Vampire Fleets looked pretty cool too.  Probably my least
favorite Traveller book cover was Encounters in the Ventura Quadrant, by Group
One.

The trouble is that email doesn\'t effectively convey the mood and tone of the
sender. Thus the words sent are open to misinterpretation. The use of emoticons
reduces, but does not eliminate, these misinterpretations.

> Hmmm. Right. Is it me or is the list getting a bit hysterical?

Not hysterical, IMO, just passionate.

I have discovered, over the years, that one effective way to avoid people
taking things personally is to avoid the use of the word "you" in
communication. This works in conversation or email.  Also, judicious use of
terms like "I feel", "in my opinion", and "if I understand things right", also
soothe the wounded ego.

For example, let\'s say that two people, A and B, are having an email debate
about the nature of fog. Here\'s the wrong way to do it:

A: Of course, fog is really just a low-lying cloud. If you can\'t see that, then
you don\'t know much about meteorology.
B: Well, obviously you don\'t know me very well. Fogs are really an
interdimensional gateway. Just ask Larry Niven!

Each person is taking shots at the other. Here\'s the right way to do it:

A: The way I understand it, fog is really just low-lying clouds. Am I wrong
here?
B: Well, in my opinion, Larry Niven pegged it exactly, stating that fog is an
interdimensional gateway. That\'s just how I feel about it.

Very non-confrontational.

This is, after all, just my opinion. I try to use these guidelines when I
email, especially when I\'m a little hot under the collar.

The main problem with Foss\' work being published in Traveller books is that
most if not all of the work was chosen from stock paintings. As far as I
know, *none* of it was specifically done for Traveller, but rather was
chosen from among Foss\' already completed sci-fi pieces.

The work is well done, but I\'m in agreement with those of you who are
against it: It just isn\'t Traveller. More like Star Wars.

Aslan honor and dueling, I think, are sometimes overrated. A society
founded on fisticuffs every time someone perceives an insult would degrade
into chaos quite quickly.

I think that 99 percent of Aslan "duels" are of the "war of insults"
variety. Now, a war of insults need not be, "Aw, your mama sleeps in her
kitty litter!" I think they\'re more like boisterous intellectual debates,
perhaps somewhat akin to Crossfire on CNN. The "duelist" who is the most
clever will win when the less clever duelist recognizes defeat.

An Aslan will concede defeat rather than escalating a disagreement beyond
where it should be. The resultant loss of face for losing a war of insults
is much less than if he engages in an unnecessary violent duel.

Therefore, should your female Aslan become insulted, perhaps her clan
patriarch would engage in a "war of insults" via interstellar courier.
Perhaps this is slow, but Aslan aren\'t likely to engage in violent duels
unless absolutely necessary.

Several messages to the offending clan that indicate the error of their
ways might result in an amicable solution. The female\'s honor would thus be
defended and in future relations, the two parties would recall the
resolution between the clan patriarch and the male Aslan who hurled the
initial insult. I would think that all other avenues would be exhausted
before violence is chosen.

movie poster).  Done well, these few lines of text, together with a
great picture or graphic from the movie, will entice people to see the
thing.

I already know I\'m going to tweak this (and I have an idea for another
one-sheet if the movie gets popular and has been out for a while-you\'ve
seen how posters can change during the run of a film), but here\'s what
I\'ve come up with for the first one.

A Film By Kenneth D. Bearden



14 Days before Christmas,
5 families from the same block,
on the same side of the street,
are brutally, ritualistically murdered.

It is the most heinous crime in history.

People are afraid to go out at night.

The case remains unsolved.

And, the Police can\'t find an answer
because they don\'t belive in Vampires.

Fully agreed.  Not knowing how ships fight, even roughly, makes it
pointless to design them.  Is an armor rating of 100 enough to stp a PAW
100 cold, stop it half the time, or once only?  How about a 99, or a 101,
or a 120?  Do systems degrade, or do they die on the first hit?

If we know the answers to these, then we can build ships in virtually any
design system, as long as they evaluate to the same ship cards.

>2. Chart based, so designers can turn to the information they need and
find it
>(and understand it).

Please - make sure the charts are derived from a detailed system.  For
example, take FF&S2, or its spiritual kin, and derive charts, of sizes,
typical weapons, and so on.  Most of my designs will come from the chart
system, but i want to know that if I am contemplating adding endurance life
support from FF&S2 to a chart created ship that it will work roughly right.

>3. Driven by a checklist, and supported by a usable, user friendly form,

Yes.  Great idea.  One suggestion - include in the checklist some helpful
information, like the following:

"Hull size:

Select a hull size appropriate for your task.  Single man or two man ships
tend to be under 300 tons, because even the best automation can not allow
someone to think about two things at once.

Merchant vessels range from 200t free traders to 5000t or more bulk cargo
carriers.  Few vessels over 500 tons are privately owned because of the
immense cost.  The majority of the bulk carriers operating between worlds
of pop 6 or greater are in the 3-4kt range.  Some high pop worlds close
together will run regular lines of 60kt vessels.

Military vessels less than 3000t cannot carry the awesome weapons used in
large space battles, but are perfectly adequate to control a system.  As a
result, most vessels below 3kt are either picket boats or destroyers.  They
have armor rating sufficient to stop civilian grade weapons (around 30),
and weapons with damage ratings in the 50s, thus they tend to die off
fairly fast in combat, but are proof against civilian weapons.  (Armor: 30,
main weapon DV 50)

A 10-20kt military vessel with a spinal mount is known as a light cruiser,
and is expected to be the center of military activity for a large number of
destroyers.  Most worlds with a pop 7 or more will have at least one such
vessel, and a world with a pop of 8 will typically have several posted
throughout the system or on maneuvers.  These vessels have evenly matched
armor and weapons, and can withstand the fire of several destroyers
indefinitely, but when in combat against similar vessels, their small size
and lack of redundancy make them fragile.  (Armor: 70, main weapon DV 70)

A 30-60 kt vessel with a spinal mount is a cruiser.  This vessel will be
the flagship for a home fleet of pop 8, and will be a major component of
pop 9 fleets.  In general, they can crush a light cruiser in minutes, but
will duel each other for several hours before one is a hulk, and the other
is nearly so.  This is because they have somewhat better armor than
weaponry, and many redundant systems.  (Armor: 90, main weapon DV 88)

A 80-100kt vessel is a battleship or dreadnought.  These vessels are
fielded by pop 9 worlds as a major fleet component.  In general, nothing
lesser can stand against them, but they are terribly expensive, thus they
have an array of heavy cruisers as screening elements, and light cruisers
as scouting elements.  These vessels are heavily armored, with spinal
mounts capable of punching right through any smaller vessel.  (Armor: 120,
main weapon DV 120)

>4. Supported by a reasonable format for the ship card / USP so one can
>understand what that means, and

Though ship cards are not enough for a product like starships - we need to
see the detailed design, as well as the summary card.  For play purposes,
summary cards are fine.

>5. supported by examples.

Yes!  Yes yes yes!  Please, though, make sure that these examples are
designed with the systems you intend the players to use, and go through one
with a detailed system, and several with chart-based ones, so that people
know how to make the decisions, and trust that chart ships are sufficient
in most cases.

  Back again after a LOOOOOOooooonnng absence <grin>.

  When discussing the different "design" sequences for ships starting with
CT, working through HIGH GUARD, and finishing up with T4 Design systems, I
think it should be pointed out, that each system had to have pleased at
least a small segment of the TRAVELLER populace.
  As for preferences?  Who is to say what is right and what is wrong?
About the only measure of "success" I can point to with any certitude, is
that of pocketbook aclaim as well as frequency of use.

  Where I sit, Traveller is a "FUN" universe with a few "logic flaws", but
overall fun background.  What I find objectionable, others don\'t have a
problem with and vice versa.  For me, it is pointless to spend HOURS and
HOURS debating what is right and what is wrong, because GM\'s will change
the universe to suit themselves anyhow.  However, friendly debate about how
one GM sets up his universe and allowing other\'s to either poke holes in it
(thereby improving the setting) or adopt what they percieve to be "gems" in
the concepts is to be encouraged...

  Also, my favorite character generation system/combat system is GURPS, and
today, I would not even consider attempting to run a TRAVELLER UNIVERSE
using the classic Traveller rules nor (and I am sorry to say this), the
newer T4 version.  Lest you all get the wrong idea here, I own every
"version" of Traveller to have ever come out, and I really did give it a go
(version T4 that is) with my gaming group.  The problem was, from my gaming
group\'s perspective, is that really "ludicrous" results were relatively
easily obtained mathematically speaking.  Also, the odds of success chart
where one used 1/2 dice progressions were not smooth enough to make a
difference.  One player suggested that we consider using the Megatraveller
concept of a steadily increasing difficulty modifier such that impossible
feats were really impossible!  Another suggested that instead of using half
dice, that we just use full dice for the half dice, and then increase the
order of magnitude for the other levels.  Thus, the difficulties would
reflect an average of +3.5 average die roll per difficulty, rather than the
(1+3)/3 (which equals 1.3333 by the way) for the 1/2 die.
  Another problem that led to the abandonment of T4 with my group, was the
fact that the first book (we gave up before the other books came out) was
rife with so many errors in the sense that things were missing, and/or
misplaced.  Also, the equipment lists didn\'t seem to have been proofread
properly such that the "stats" of weapons and armor didn\'t match the
descriptions of said equipment.  When all was said and done, the players
wanted to return to GURPS.  Had GURPS not existed, chances are, we as a
group, would have "fixed" T4 to reflect our preferences, and created T4
analogs to the CT and Megatraveller equipment and weapons.

  Ok, I have slammed the T4 system enough to likely rile the proponents and
adherents of the system to get a Plasma bolt up my arse <grin>.  However,
this wasn\'t fully my intent.  Now, to slam GURPS <grin>.  What I missed
seeing in a TRAVELLER universe, was the character generation system that
gave results much like the CT, where you decided what branch you wanted
your character to emerge from.  I loved the Random Stat generation, along
with the randomized (with input from the character owner) skill
delineation.  GURPS doesn\'t readily adapt itself to this, being a point
allocation system.  And Finally, While I love GURPS VEHICLES, I also Loved
the FF&S book as well.  I HATED having to figure out the ship damage charts
for use with TNE, just as I hated the fact that ship combats became a long
drawn out affair.  I also, much to my shame, never really gave TNE ship to
ship combat a fair shake because the Ships were not the same as those
produced from CT or HIGH GUARD (yes, I make a distinction between the
two!).  Essentially put, I hate having to spend long periods of time
creating "unique" ships that are overly detailed for combat use.  I also
hate having to spend a lot of time creating deck plans for said detailed
ships.

  In the end analysis of my "tastes", the following are my preferences:

1) A slightly more "detailed" High Guard like system that does not lose the
"initial" simplicity of the combat system.  By this, I mean that Energy
generation systems be rated by the Megawattage they produce, not by "power
levels".  If the inferred concept of 1 energy point equals 250 megawatts
was possible, then why didn\'t HIGH GUARD just create a simple formula that
stated "Volume of plant is X per Megawatt of energy produced and uses Y
fuel per hour" or some thing like that.  Change the damage result of the
"powerplant" hits to read like "lose 10% power production per level of hit"
or some such non-sense.  Weapons are now rated by power usage.  Life
support is based on power usage, etc.  If I recall correctly, STRIKER ended
up doing just that.  I once, out of curiosity, went back and tried to
calculate the fuel usage versus energy output as percieved by Striker
equipment rules, and found that the fuel usage rates were comparable to the
HIGH GUARD rules...

2) a revamping of CT\'s or HG\'s approach with the computers.  Instead of
having an increasing size for higher graded computers, just have an
increasing cost level per increased capacity, but retain a simple 1 ton
volume for the "computer room".

3) a separate lifesupport section to be included in the engineering bay,
with the potential of hitting it added to the damage charts.

  I think you can see what I am getting at here.  I would have liked to see
a combat system for ship to ship, that was reasonably abstract for major
fleet battles, yet powerful enough to be done on a MAYDAY like scale or
even CT scale.  However...

HUGE HOWEVER <grin>

  Such a combat system is something that I can cobble up on my own without
having to get nasty about some other guy not having had the foresight to
make "WHAT I WANT".  So I will finish this off with the observation of this:

  Enjoy the fact you have so many different ship construction systems.  As
was pointed out, one need not use T4\'s version of ships if you want to use
HIGH GUARD - they mesh well enough!  If you would rather use the combat
system of T4, but use the skill system from Megatraveller - why not?
Frankly, one STRENGTH that I can see here, and might be worth a "PRODUCT"
from Imperium Games, is to recap the different TRAVELLER game systems, and
allow the players to pick and chose.  I don\'t know if there is a copywrite
problem, or a royalty problem with respect to reprinting all of the oldies
yet goodies stuff, but to my way of thinking, it would be worth the
while/effort to re-release some of those old standbys for the newer
generation buyers.  As one person on REC.GAMES.FRP.MISC wrote: you will get
my CT when you pry them from my cold dead fingers.

Pssst: don\'t tell anyone yet, but right now,  I am running a SCI-FI
campaign for my players that is apparently GURPS based, but in reality, is
lying doggo until GURPS TRAVELLER comes out.  Once that happens, then I can
go back once again to my long endearing love...

  Nope. No pictures. I\'ve been trying to envision the Addaxur with
little success aside from a big, toothy grin for five years now.

  Another bit of text, from the CT Zhodani Module:

  "...six-legged carnivores from a high-gravity world about 40 parsecs
from Zhodane (sic)"

  and

  "Zhdant has a population of 83 million, of whom more than 90% are
racial Zhodani. Significant non-Zhodani population is primarily Addaxur"

  This leads to a couple of assumptions on my part: The Addaxur have
their ten-world reservation, but are common and welcome travellers in
most of the Consulate. They have been a part of the Consulate for 5000
years or more (contact was in -5120 Imperial), so they are _everywhere_.
  The Addaxur used STL to link their worlds before the Zhodani found
them, so we can assume one of two things: either they DID have artificial
gravity, OR they are quite tolerant of low-G environments. Given their
current near-ubiquity in the modern consulate, the second is quite
likely. Or they go everywhere with a grav-harness that _increases_
their personal gravity to a comfortable level.
  "Six-legged" does not necessarily mean six-limbed, and this has been
one of my stumbling blocks for their appearance.  "Reptilian" means
scales or armor plates. "Intelligent" and "star-faring" requires certain
body forms: hands or their equivalent, good eyesight and/or high tactile
sense.
  It is far too easy to drop a picture of Poul Anderson\'s Adzel (sort of
a dragon-centaur with heavy armor) into this equation, and he may be what
the folks at GDW were thinking of at the time, but I would rather come
up with something else...

  As a By The Way, the home sector of the Addaxur is Tienspevnekr, which
was done for the HIWG Sector Project several years ago, planet and
subsector names complete (as was Zhdant Sector; Ziafrplians was never
finished that I recall, I\'ll have to look). Being a Zhodani nut, I will
probably make these things available on my Web site. Er. When I get one.
Copious free time and all that...

That\'s a tough one.  I\'m assuming that the duel is to be fought with another
Aslan.  If the male in question were an alien, the insult would certainly be
dismissed (with something like "An ignorant, honorless, barbaric male alien
such as yourself obviously can\'t possibly have the wit to comprehend this
point of honor that is obvious to any half-housebroken child") and the Aslan
would simply refuse to treat the alien in question as anything other than a
dim-witted animal ("one does not hold conversations with animals; and slicing
one with a dewclaw is simply a matter of butchery and not honor").

Here are some ideas if it\'s an Aslan-Aslan matter of honor:

There is a ritual of insults that typically leads to a challenge.  This is a
part of the tradition, and it gives both sides a chance to back down before
a duel is required.  If the female can keep her temper, she can probably use
this to her advantage.  She has the option of dismissing the insult for
gender-specific reasons, and should probably do so (she gains as much honor
as if the duel was fought, and the male looses none for backing down).  If
the male continues with insults that would require a challenge, she should
probably issue a challenge (by going this far, the male has already lost
considerable honor).

If the challenge is issued, she should talk to the earltrais (duel referee),
and point out that she is very distant from her clan.  The male cannot duel
her himself, or else he would suffer a great loss of honor for fighting with
a female.  The male is most likely to be concerned with this point, since
males are the more traditional element in Aslan society.  The referee will
probably make the obvious suggestion - that the male involved fetch an
appropriate female relative to fight in his stead - so that the duel can
proceed.

Another option would be for your female to hire a champion.  Champions are
(semi)-professional duel-fighters.  A mismatched duel is a grave dishonor to
those who participate in it, but in Aslan society, there are situations
where a duel must be fought between individuals who are of widely varying
health or age.  Champions are the answer - most large groups of Aslan have
champions of both genders and widely varying age.  The profession is an
honorable one, and the use of a champion to avoid a clearly-mismatched duel
is considered honorable.

If all else fails, the time and place for the duel will simply have to be
specified such that the female can get word to her clan, and have a male
sent to fight in her stead.  It\'s not unheard-of to schedule a duel this far
in advance, but it\'s certainly unusual.  It\'d also make a great adventure
seed, for the Aslan shipowner to return to her homelands, find a champion
amoung her family, and still get to the appointed place for the duel (being
late would be extremely dishonorable).

Well, the bands on the LBBs were to distinguish the core rule books from
supplements and adventures.  Made it easy to find books 1-8 on your shelf
looking at the spines.  I agree that they were quite striking, especially
in the genre of overly flashy covers like most D&D, Gamma World, etc.

Haven\'t seen the group one stuff, but I "inherited" materials from Judge\'s
Guild ("Waspwinter" is the product that sticks in my mind) with
illustrations that could have been done by my 6 year old neice.  Poorly
drawn aliens and scenes that were out of proportion, It makes me appreciate
*any* well done art.  Note that the content on the above mentioned
products, while not fabulous, is certainly usable, if a bit on the bizarre
side.

You are talking about a standard of Aslan society. Since the (the female
aslan) is operating outside of her own society (by choice, and with some
recognition that other societies are different), she has internally accepted
that normal rules don\'t apply.

If its a slight insult, she ignores it. If its too great an insult, she could
[forego tradition and] right the wrong herself, or she could work within local
society (which might allow dueling, or might call for mediation, or suing, or
talking it out).

This is like a female from an islamic country who observes strict dress codes
while at home or with her family, but adopts more open dress codes when
visiting in or living in western countries.

The idea to have a hollow slug, that on impact collapses to critical

   Just how far can you deflect a spinal mount shot?  I\'ve always 
assumed you need to be aiming within a few degrees of the target, and 
assuming a ROF of 100, you only have 30 s to switch between the 
firing spinal mounts.

  In the scary-cube department, how about having janus spinal mounts 
along each outside edge - four barrels per face.  Spin it at 1 
revolution per 30 s, and assuming each has an ROF of 100, you have a 
respectable total ROF of 1600. That should wake up the target.  I\'m 
sure there are plenty of practical reasons for it not to work well, 
but the thought\'s nice. :)

   Of course, having a million+ diplacement-ton cube drop out of 
jump space should give most characters cause for concern, regardless 
of armament. :)

She might approach a "male" member of the crew, one that she feels 
closest to or that understands Aslan ways the most to act as a 
relative and issue a challenge.  

If she is Tolerant (the skill), she may just consider the insulter to 
be tahiwihteakhtau (barbarian), and kick him off the ship at the next 
opportunity.  

_Solomani and Aslan_ mentions the use of paid Champions if the 
person needing to duel is too old or infirm; perhaps this also 
applies.

Or, her letters home get Dad angry enough he decides an Assassin is 
appropriate.

There are no simple systems that can withstand a clever person.  Clever
people take them apart, and your rules need to be, at their heart, capable
of handling people trying to do complicated things.  The average person
will do average things, and it is nice if the rules are easy to use in that
domain as well.  Remember - if the players need a fusion plant to power
their APC, and they have a solar panel in the water purifier, they _are_
going to ask if it can run the grav car.  You better be able to answer this
kind of question as a DM.

If the system can give you the answer, then you might give a consistent
answer, and the game will seem a little less arbitrary.

Digression:

The real world gets around this by having apparently simple things floating
on top of very complicated things.  Riding a bicycle involves solving lots
of nasty DEs, but we have the proper results "wired in" through practice.
If someone wants to generalize a bicycle to a thousand feet high, then you
do need to have the real physics.  A physics degree makes it pretty clear
that there is a lot of subtlety lurking under the so-called simple world.

If the gearheads have their way, then the underlying physics will come
somewhere near reality.  You can still put a simple wrapper on top, but you
_have_ to have something like the real world deep inside.  By having a
complicated system with a simple wrapper, you can get easy to use systems
with some depth behind the charts.

Here is an example-

Is damage resistance based on the cube of the armor thickness, or the
simple thickness?  Is the damage value based on the energy, or the square
of the energy?  These are fairly subtle, and do not vary a lot over the
range of a typical pistol bullet (200J vs. 1KJ), but the difference gets
pretty severe between a pistol bullet and a laser turret (200J vs. 250MJ).

Should the player care?  No.  They should be able to read off a table, or
should have a number that can be compared directly.  (E.g., a DV of 10 vs
and armor of 11 is a win for the armor.)  That the designer of the vessel,
or the designer of the chart used by the ship designer had to perform
armor=(T*d)^3, is not something that the player needs to see.

Most refs don\'t need to see it either.

Until the players drop a 600Kg boulder on a tank from 50 feet, and ask what
happens.  Saying "be creative" is not a lot of help, especially if one of
the players does know the real answer, and the GM doesn\'t.

So, the so-called "uber-gearheads" are not doing this just to make you
unhappy - they are doing this in hopes that we will not end up with a
vehicle design system that is incompatible _on an assumption level_ with
the starships, and those incompatible with the had weapons.  Many systems
have this, where a pistol is a good weapon against a tank, or a starship
capable of diving into a gas giant can be threatened with a chemical
explosive bomb in a suitcase.

T4 has the same problem, precisely because they did not start with the old
FF&S when designing the simple systems.  Wildstar did start with the old
FF&S, so we ended up with QSDS, that is basically compatible with FF&S2,
thus ships designed with one will work with the other.  Had Greg Porter
circulated betas to the people who would someday write FF&S, and had he
agreed with them on the basic assumptions, VDS-designed vehicles might well
work with all the old ships.  Further, had FF&S2 had enough time for proper
playtest, it would have had fewer problems.

My point?  Every simple system has deep assumptions, and if you develop the
deep assumptions before simplifying, you end up with a number of simple
systems that do not conflict.  If you do otherwise, then you suffer greatly.

Aha! Someone who (obviously) only read UK editions of SF in the \'70\'s! Sorry,
but I can say without fear of contradiction (well, not much :-} that no (or
extremely few) *US* editions of SF works in the 70\'s (or anytime at all, much)
used Foss artwork. Foss\'s covers were, AFAIK, used *only* on UK editions.

I know whereof I speak, for assorted arcane copyright reasons, it was
technically illegal to import US editions of any book into Australia until the
last ten years or so (it was done, and in increasingly large numbers, but it was
*very* uncommon in the 19960\'s and \'70\'s ... *except* for SF books) ... anyway,
even tho it was sometimes difficult I *never* bought a UK edition with Foss
"art" in preference to a US edition with non-Foss art. Never. (And, to boot, the
US editions were usually cheaper).

So, to most *American* readers ... and that\'s where Traveller started, after
all, your statement is likely to be completely wrong.

I was personally a fan of the "Virtual Bat (tm)", a large robotic arm that
attaches to the side of your monitor that wields a Louisville Slugger that can
be controlled by simple encoding that can be sent on chats, in e-mail, or on
usenet...

The only problem would be getting everybody else to buy them.

In alot of the stuff I see around on the Internet its just people practicing
mental masturbation.  Like, the whole tirade against the gearheads, "tech-
geeks" and "no-real-life Star Wars types".  Nothing is actually accomplished
by such yelling and screaming, people get irked (to say the least) when
they\'ve been insulted, and in the scheme of things, its not really all that
important.

Just seems kind of dopey.

Yes.  Live the adventure.

A Leatherman pocket tool (Swiss-Army knife type thing, all sorts of useful
goodies), a good survial knife (6" blade, saw edge on back, various items
in hilt, compass in pommel, my 2-liter Army canteen.  If I can port water,
I\'m halfway to anywhere.

Instead of the canteen, I\'d by a solar still at a camping supply store.

WARNING ... HEAVY ECONOMICS GEEKING FOLLOWS.
IF THIS DOESNT INTEREST YOU, PRESS DELETE NOW
***********************************************

The current Traveller trade system and all that follow it are broken beyond
recognition.

Lo-tech worlds have all this foriegn exchange to buy imports with, and
absolutely no way of earning them.

The system doesnt scale, and doesnt recognise that your freight is someone
else\'s speculative cargo.

OK. Whine over. Lets fix it.

Where economics is everything, if people can make money doing it, it will
be done.

Where money is not to be made, it will not be done.

And if any bozo can make money doing it, then every bozo will try and make
money doing it.

Therefore the quantity of trade is determined by the profitibility of that
trade.

Freight costs are adjusted to reflect the twin facts that higher jump
freighters are more expensive but less expensive per parsec. Jump-1
freighters charge Cr 1000 per jump per displacement ton (dt), Jump-2
freighters Cr1250 per jump per dt and Jump-3 freighters Cr 1500 per jump
per dt.

To solve the problem that the current Traveller cargo values dont match
anything that can be bought - the cost of a displacement ton of vacc suits
is well over Cr10 000, for example - there are now three categories of
trade goods.

Category One trade goods are goods of mass consumption, and raw and
semi-processed materials for industry. These goods use the flat Traveller
trade system.

Category Two trade goods are finished industrial products, and items of
semi-luxury consumption. These goods have a base cost of KCr 100 per dt.
They use the flat traveller trade system, except that a Source/Market DM is
an adjustment of n*10% in buying or selling price, rather than an
adjustment of n*Cr1000 in base buying or selling prices.

Category Three trade goods are items of hyper-luxury consumption, cost MCr2
per displacement ton, and have their supply and demand determined
exogenously (when goods cost MCr2 per displacement ton, you can carry it
essentially as far as you want, if you have a 10% price differential
between market and source).

Category four goods are Military Trade goods, representing military
hardware and spare parts. They cost MCr5 per displacement ton, and also
have their demand determined exogenously.

Create a trade matrix of all worlds in a trade zone for Category One and
Two trade goods, and determine profitibility for all routes, with freight
costs based on the most effective route. Remember to apply selling prices
including the best broker available at the market world\'s starport class.
Assume an average dice roll of 7 on the selling table. Do *not* apply DMs
due to Tech Level differences between source and market worlds.

<The reason for dropping TLs due to TL differences is that TL is the
primary determinant of GWP in Imperial Credit values. Low TL worlds will
have low GWP in ICr terms, and therefore small amounts of trade. Their
lower value currency will result in many of their exports being cheaper in
Imperial Credit terms for the goods they can produce that are demanded in
the wider market>

Next, generate GWPs in Imperial Credits for all worlds, whether thru
Trillion Credit Squadron, Striker or Pocket Empires. Remember that an
Imperial Credit is the highest-value credit within a trade zone.

<if you do this for the Third Imperium, please email me a copy ;) >

If worlds are of comparable economic size (GWPs within 100% of each other),
then for each pair of worlds, Category One trade in each direction will be
equal to (Expected average net profitability/500) percent of the smaller
world\'s economy. Note : if profitibility on one leg is sufficiently high
that you can make the run back empty or at a loss, do so. Record by value
and tonnage in each direction.

If worlds are of comparable economic size (GWPs within 100% of each other),
for each pair of worlds, Category Two trade in each direction will be equal
to (Expected average net profitibility/100 000) percent of the smaller
worlds\'s economy. Note : if profitibility on one leg is sufficiently high
that you can make the run back empty or at a loss, do so. Record by value
and tonnage in each direction.

Needless to say, if expected average net profitibility is negative, trade
will not happen.

A world will import (((1d6-3)+(1d6-3))*(1d6-3))/3 percent of GWP in
civilian Category Three goods. Record by value and tonnage. Source worlds
will be determined later.

A world will export ((1d6-3)+(1d6-3))*(1d6-3)-3% of GWP in Category 3
Civilian Goods. Record by value and tonnage. Destination worlds will be
determined later.

A world has a 66% chance of spending 5-30% of it\'s military budget on
imported military goods. Military budgets average 3% of GWP, 6% of GWP
outside the Third Imperium. Therefore, Category Four Military Imports will
be 1d6*5*0.03 percent of GWP if present. Source worlds will be determine
later.

A world will export Military Goods if it has a Starport type of A or B or
is Industrial and has a TL of either the Maximum or one below the maximum
for the trade zone. 

A world that meets these conditions will export 1d6% of it\'s GWP as
Category Four military goods. A world that does not meet these conditions
will not export military goods. Destination worlds will be determined later.

In a large economy, set the Category Three Civilian exports of otherwise
deficit worlds at a level sufficient to put their trade balance at an
acceptable level (zero in the Third Imperium).

Similarly, increase the Category Three Civilian imports of otherwise
surplus worlds so that their trade balance is also at an acceptable level.

<Yes, this is an exteremly ugly fix. In reality, market economies react to
balance of trade crises by changes in the valuation of their currency, thus
encouraging imports or exports as appropriate. However, the Traveller trade
system doesnt apply trade DMs based on relative currency values. Therefore,
balance of trade crises dont happen, therefore trade balances must be at or
near zero. Assume that the world couldnt have imported all those goods
without exports to pay for them in the first place. Oh yeah, and the IISS
knocks over any mercantilist governments that insist on running trade
surpluses. Incidentally, Category Three imports and export both average
about 1.7% of GWP. All worlds import some Cat 3 goods, and many worlds will
import Cat 4 goods but many worlds will not export them. The worlds that do
export Cat 3 or Cat 4 goods tend to export a *lot* of them>

For a small economy, net trade will equal zero (it has no-where else to
import or export to).

If total military exports exceed total military imports, then
proportionatly reduce all military exports until they equal total military
imports.

If total military import exceed total military exports, then proportionatly
increase all military exports until they equal total military imports.

Next, sum the total trade balance for all worlds.

If the net trade balance is negative, then proportionatly decrease all
Category Three Civilian Import levels until the sum of trade balances
equals zero.

If the net trade balance is positive, then proportionatly decrease all
Category Three Civilian Exports until the sum of all trade balances equals
zero.

<net trade within a trade zone has to equal zero - there is no-where else
they can import or export to>

Next, balance the trade balance of every individual worlds by exporting
Category Three Civilian goods from the world with the largest trade deficit
to the world with the largest trade surplus, in MCr 100 increments.

Continue until all worlds have a trade surplus or deficit of less than MCr100.

<see notes about quick and ugly fixes above>

OK. At the end of this process, we have the Category One and Category Two
trade patterns, together with total amounts of Category Three and Four
imports and exports.

Once we calculate where Category Three and Four exports and imports go to
and come from, we have a complete "trade map" of the trade zone.

The simplest way is to create a "standard basket" of both Category Three
and Four goods. Calculate the percentage of total exports of goods of each
type by exporting world. Each importing world imports according to this
profile (eg 12% of total Imperial category three goods exports comes from
Sylea. Therefore each world that imports category three goods will import
12% of it\'s category three imports from Sylea).

****************************************************************************
********

Needless to say, this process *has* to be computerised. Just figuring it
out for a small seven-world trade zone nearly drove me insane. I\'ll write
up how this system crunches out trade quantities for the Pocket Empires\'
Empire of the Seven Suns later today.

We also have to sacrifice some rules, notably the "cargo always costs about
KCr 5 per tons, modified for demand" and "Net Source/Market TL is a
determinant of demand".

However, it *is* worth it, because it will give us a way of generating a
complte "trade map". It will provide amounts of trade, trade by value and
lots of background information about worlds (knowing that a world imports
6% of it\'s GWP as luxury goods and 3% of GWP as Military goods tells you a
number of things about the world\'s probable social structure. Add a high
law level and I\'ll give you two guesses on it\'s probable social stability
too ...).

Once this is done, we will know how much trade a world does, and thus the
size of it\'s starport and the tonnage of shipping per annum.

If somebody decides to issue "Pocket Empire" sourcebooks, with one page per
world in the Empire, then you could record total trade to and from each
world by type as economic data, as well as total trade by volume, value and
type.

The short summary is that big worlds have *lots* of trade with each other,
while it is entirely credible to have a small world that literally sees one
far trader a year.

Basically, a pair of worlds will have Category 1 trade equal to 2% of the
smaller world\'s GWP per Cr1000 profit, and Cat 2 trade equal to 0.1% of the
smaller world\'s GWP per Cr10 000 profit. Worlds will tend to have a large
radius of potential Category 2 trade partners (snap-frozen strawberries
that sell for Cr 4 a 250 milliliter punnet are worth Cr200 000 a
displacement ton. Assume 50% markup between starport and purchaser. How
many PCs would buy a ICr4 punnet of strawberries as an "impulse" purchase ?
How many workers earning ICr8000 a year on an Industrial world, and eating
machine-made goop, would buy one as a holiday present for loved ones ? One
in a thousand ? Given 400 million workers, thats seven displacement tonnes
of snap-frozen strawberries per holiday, at value ICr100 000 per
displacement ton for the shipper).

I want to have smaller worlds have a multiple to their GWP for the amount
of Cat 1 trade (a big neighbour that wants lots of what you produce will
tend to dominate your economy ), but couldnt figure a clean method of doing
it.

It also shows the level of economic disruption caused by the introduction
of Jump-2 and then Jump-3 freighters into a trade zone. Honestly, they
revolutionise the pattern of long-distance interstellar trade. And with
KCr100 and MCr 2 and 4 goods, there is a lot of long-distance trade.

Military goods exporters are also vulnerable when suddenly they arent the
preferred supplier - an Indutrial Tech 10 world is going to take a *big*
trade hit once their purchasers join the TL12 Imperium\'s trade zone, and
start buying "obsolete" TL11 grav tanks and SDBs off Imperial worlds.

Oh yeah, and the invention of Category Two, Three and Four trade goods
gives pirates more of a sporting chance ... by increasing the value of a
freighter\'s cargo, it is more worthwhile taking insane risks to capture it.

Finally, the model is also quite sensitive to changes in freight costs. The
long-term fall in the cost of transport (caused by the Imperial credit
costs of cargo starships falling as Imperial technology rises) will
encourage trade. Increases in the cost of freight due to risk will cause it
to fall.

We got them in Canada, back when the Canadian dollar was worth more than

To Imperium Games

On October 24 you charged my VISA for a book, presumably Naval Architects
Manual.  When the bill arrived in mid-November I emailed you querying
this, and you replied that the book was now in the mail.  On November 21
you charged my VISA again, presumably for Imperial Squadrons (although
other people were receiving both books in a single package).

I have yet to receive either book.  I did receive the letter you sent
regarding the cancellation of JTAS.

I would appreciate receiving the books that I have ordered (and paid for).
 

I would also suggest that your review your company\'s shipping procedures. 
My order of Emperor\'s vehicles was not shipped until after I queried the
VISA charge, now it appears that the same thing happened with Naval
Architects Manual (and probably Imperial Squadrons).  I am not familiar
with American law, but in Canada it is illegal to charge a credit card
until the order is shipped.

I guess that does indicate that, doesn\'t it?  Either that, or they have some
other method of eliminating liquid waste.  I think I\'ll go with this in my
complex.  I have an idea for where the stuff was teleported to (I use limited
nanotech in my campaign-world, and I have the ancients pretty heavily involved
with it on a big scale.  The teleporter would take the waste to a "recycling
room", where the essential elements are converted by nanomachines).

It would figure, wouldn\'t it?  I should have known :)

>There were perches in the base, but I think they were in the exercise room.

I had two seperate "barracks" rooms, well, actually 3, the third was for the
human servants.  The "normal" Droyne barracks had a "pole" around the room,
irregularly shaped, set about a meter off the floor and a meter away.  The
"warrior" Droyne barracks had a thicker pole higher off the floor, and further
from the wall.  I would assume that in addition to being quite a bit taller,
warrior Droyne would have a wider wing span as well...

Depending on how crazy I am ;-) For the sake of discussion, yes. It would

Replace the waterflask with one of those handy condensator/purifier units.

Probably the same things, although a camera would have been fun. Still,

Rob,

	It is against the law in the UK too, as far as I am aware. You can tell
your credit card company that you have not yet received goods that you have
paid for. They will then get onto IG and ask for details of the
transaction, and it will be up to them to prove that they have provided the
goods that you have been billed for.

	However, as you may already have paid your bill as it was a few months
ago, I don\'t know what the procedure now is for this.	Good luck anyway.

	But, anyone else with an as yet unpaid credit card bill with something on
it that has not yet been received from IG need not pay it. Tell your credit
card company and they will contact IG. This way, no one need pay for
anything they haven\'t yet received.


	See ya...

Try emailing flagella@concentric.net - it\'s the only reliable address 
AFAICT.

This is almost identical to an email I sent about a month ago (and an 
earlier one re. another product).

I was also charged on different occasions, but the books arrived together.

Odd - I\'ve had the COTI letter but not the JTAS one.

I thought it was (and made a similar comment to IG), but since then people 
have told me (though they could be wrong) that it isn\'t strictly illegal to 
do this, at least in some cases. However, the CC companies would certainly 
take a dim view of anyone who made a habit of it.

I STRONGLY suggest you call IG and demand your money back.  I went through
similar trauma almost exactly a year ago, and was LIED to three times by IG.

My credit card was charged in November of 1996, and no product ever arrived.
This is illegal in the US as well as Canada.  (I had ordered the special t-
shirts and the mouse pad, for Christmas presents).  When I finally called (a
month or so into  1997), I was told that "they just shipped out and were in
the mail."

A week later, I still had received nothing, so I called again, and was told
that the t-shirts had not even been printed!  However, they were expected in
the next week.

I waited; still nothing.  I called and demanded a refund.  They LIED and told
me that was not possible, but I could get a credit towards another purchase.
I told them I did not want another product; I wanted my money back.  They
apologized, and said that was the best they could do.

The next day, after talking to a few lawyer friends, I faxed and mailed a
nasty letter to them, threatening legal action.  MYSTERIOUSLY, they called me
and told me I was getting a refund (which just hadn\'t been possible the day
before).

Good luck.

That *was* pretty impressive. Leonard managed to get;

Rishathra
bestiality (since Sayat don\'t think of K\'Kree as "Human", IIRC)
rape (since I\'m *certain* the K\'kree isn\'t going to approve...)
sodomy (not a problem with *me*, but still illegal in 13 subsectors of 
        Solomani space... :-)
play toys *and* weapon play (since a PMPP at least nominally meets *both*
classifications)
and most likely Snuff as well

all into a single series of actions.

wow.

:-)

(Of course, I\'m sure he didn\'t *intend* it to be taken that way...)

You\'re not the only one. In October I ordered several books from IG and
renewed my internet preoder. The charges appeared on my November statement,
but as yet the specific books and NAM have not appeared. However in early
December I did get Imperial Squadrons. Thus far IG have not even had the
courtesy to reply to three e-mails that I know they have recieved. I\'m
giving them to 1 Jan before calling in the heavy stuff (threatening legal
action and then informing the NZ mininstry of Consumer Affairs; who are
quite happy to enforce NZ law on foreign companies doing business in NZ
via the internet).

Is there any possibility that IG had \'aquired\' the GDW people responsible
for the Traveler project while it was in GDW\'s inventory?  If so expect to
see IG suffering from the same GDW faults in the near future.  For now, all
I can suggest is avoid buying anything that you can\'t lay your hands on
first in a respectable retail location...

Wait for the second edition release of the Traveller Basic Rulebook
(refered to here as T4.1).  It promises to be better than the first edition
in terms of usability and error checking.  It\'s release is delayed, but
should be Real Soon Now(tm), and it should be Done Right(tm).

The first release suffered from the need to already know about Traveller
and many of the assumptions (or so I\'ve been told).

After that, the other books are usable to expand your understanding of
different aspects of the game universe.  The Milieu 0 campaign book will
give background and world statistics for the area of The Third Imperium
when it is a young, new empire.  There is a problem with the world data in
this supplement;  The law level is identical to the government type in each
instance.  A pain in the butt, but one which can be overcome on a
planet-by-planet basis.

I would not recommend he supplement Starships.  This book is basically
flawed in the ship stats and in relatively unusable deckplans.

I will recommend the Central Supply Catalog and Emporer\'s Arsenal.  Between
them you can find all of the basic personal equipment and weapons you\'ll
need.  Emporer\'s Vehicles adds, well, vehicles, but some might say this
supplement suffers form certain important omissions.  It is usable as it
is, however.

That\'s the basics.  Beyond these are the \'adventure books\' which you may or
may not want to pick up.

The Milieu 0 book, in addition to background, will provide some adventures.
If you wish to use prepublished adventures, The Long Way Home and Gateway
are two complete campaigns.  Try TLWH first and, if you like the style, get
Gateway as it\'s "second half".

Anomolies, Alien Archive, and Psionic Institutes are basically adventure
sources.  If you don\'t want to write your own, they are quite capable of
filling in for you.

Pocket Empires is a game unto itself, which can be related back to a
campaign setting.  It allows the creation of individual interstellar \'city
states\' outside Imperial borders as either a setting, or a plot device.  It
also is playable all by itself.

Fire, Fusion and Steel is a technical supplement and is for those who wish
to design ships, vehicles, weapons and equipment.  It is (I am told) truly
detail oriented.  This is a good supplement for those with time on their
hands.

The Naval Architects Manual contains bits and pieces of deckplans for use
when such layouts are needed.  It is useful as a tool for the GM who does
not wish to detail his or her own starship deckplans, or just hasn\'t the
time.  It also has bars, offices, and other spaces detailed.

Thats all of them.  They can be ordered from Imperium Games, or any of a
number of game distributors around.

Imperium Games (310)275-9859

Their International shipping is quite high ($5 per item, item 6 & 7 free).
You may want to search the Web for a place which has better shipping costs.

  In response to your questions...

1) the Pullout module for the missiles are such that you pick and chose
your G burn time, as well as the G output, and put it together with the
warhead system to create a missile warhead.  May I suggest you contact Mr.
Miller Himself to find out if you can get a photocopy of it?

2) with respect to the High Guard combat system, one thing should be
pointed out to you: I once ran a combat between Broadsword (800 tons) and
an unnamed 1000 ton ship also carrying a platoon of soldiers.  The one
feature about the 1000 ton ship was that it carried a 100 ton missile bay
- - giving it an Attack value of 9 on the missiles chart.  As fate would
have it, I rolled a Manuever drive critical hit, along with a powerplant
critical hit on the very first salvo.  This left the Broadsword dead in
the water (so to speak).  The next thing I did was to attempt to get a
"crew" hit before engaging in close quarters combat (that\'s boarding to
us groundlubbers <grin>).  In any event, with each turn representing 20
minutes - after 3 hours of non-stop missile fire (along with laser fire I
might add), the Broadsword was as intact as it was when the missile
bombardment started!
  As a result, I created a "house rule" that stated that for ships that
are dead in the water, 1 in 3 hits are "aimed" hits that will hit as you
desire (as per the rules from Book 1 of Traveller).  Essentially, you get
to roll 1d6, on a 1 or 2, you hit where you aimed, otherwise, you don\'t.

  If you think of an alternative, let me know <grin>.

  There is something to be said about "structure" points being adapted to
the High Guard rules.  Any hit that hits a "no hit" option (ie something
that doesn\'t exist, or has already been hit, and none exist anymore) then
a structure hit occurs.  Also, crew casualties are directly related to
"structure" hits.  Thus, if there are 10 structure hits available for a
ship, and you take 5 structure hits, then 50% of the crew are casualties.
This way, a new "home brew" hit list might ignore "crew" hits, and replace
them with structure hits...

	Yow.  I think that what we have here is the worst violation of the

Oddly enough, I never had much of a problem with GDW\'s shipping department.

Well, OK, right at the end someone lost my instructions on what to do with
the leftover Challenge subscription, so I never got my merchandise in
spite of Loren\'s promise to honour the obligation.  (If you\'re listening,
Loren, I stand by what I said about taking xeroxes of unpublished
material.)

In any case, this was a problem with a company that was winding down, not
one that is (supposedly) healthy.  I think that IG\'s shipping problems are
all of its own making.

Like Andrew, I will give Imperium Games until Jan 1 to at least make
contact, then start alternate proceedings.  I suppose the Canadian
Consumer Affairs office would be a good place to start.

My take on the situation is that a nearby non-Aslan could be made an honorary
relative for the purposes of responding to the insult. If one of the human
crew is chosen, it need not be a male human, just one that occupies a male
job, such as gunner or platooon leader.

Weeee reckon you should add a 50 000 km 25 megawatt nukeie-wukie damper,
with two displacement ton of battery-watteries (42 megawatt/hours, min

have only 3 passengers then. It\'d take the cost up to three hunnerd and a
half megacredits <predesigned nuke damper from FFS2 table 140>, an the
cargo-wargo bay down to 12 displacement tons.

Last last last thingie is two Laaaaaadars, one to use and one in case the
first one breakie-wakies. They\'ll fit in the bits next to the nukie-wukie
damper, coz it\'s a bit smaller than the nine displacement-wacement tons
weeeeee allocated. They\'re factor-wactor 14, and see out to two hunnerd

You\'re in a tough spot. My campaign currently uses MT rules. I plan to
upgrade to the T4.1 rules as soon as they\'re out, but I have no idea when
that might be. In my opinion, those rules seem to be the best ones yet.

Does anyone have any ETAs for these rules?

Remember the last days of 3rd Imperium when the Hiver delegation was
cruising about. There were little "hot dogs" being served? When the
humans tried to serve hot dogs at the next function it was noted that
the Hiver delegation did not partake of the offering.
Guess those weren\'t hot dogs after all.

There were a couple of TNS messages about this is Challenge.
I don\'t have them here at work so I can\'t be more specific.

Why am I not surprised...

Roderick, we *don\'t* want to have Leonard and Kenji disintigrated...

Leonard\'s one of the best hard-sf proponents on the list, and, well, 
anyone who comes up with the Sayat is just too inventive to die (besides, 
then *you\'d* have to take care of the Trav-lang list... :-)

So I hearby withdraw my accusations. Leonard\'s is the height of good 
taste and decorum, and and a graphic depiction of his posting should be 
distributed to all schools, free of charge, as a instructional video in 
how to diplomatically deal with the K\'Kows, titled "Fun and Practical; 
your plasma-charged dildo".

:-)

(Just remember; a K\'Kow wouldn\'t hesitate to do it to *you* :-)

Only one question left to be answered:  does it fit in a Christmas stocking?

Shocking and disruptive are the ululations and spattering of precious

Great One!

BTW, Sayat page updated: no new guns or mutants, just travelogue and
translation of Acmeist poetry.

If this is true, *artificial* gravity must work differently. Otherwise, any 
grav-based drive would work through the globe (which we know is impossible), 
plus some kind of "grav communicator" would allow communication through 
(ditto).

How do you get a cat to eat coffee beans? Unless it smells like fish
or meat, I doubt they will voluntarily consume them.

    'body' => 'Generally IS is a nice product. There\'s some well written stuff
about roleplaying in a naval context, for example, and the FFW
reprint is nice to see - but it has some major-to-moderate flaws,
too. Overall I would recommend it highly for people who want to
roleplay in the navy, but only moderately for people who want to
fight wars.

(0): Foss artwork - the only thing worse than brightly coloured
inappropriate Foss covers is black-and-white inappropriate Foss
illustrations reprinted from other covers printed at random in the
interior. I can\'t even begin to imagine why they felt obliged to do
this; there are many, many better uses for the pages. (Maps, for
example, would have been nice.)

(1): The Trillion Credit Squadron stuff is mostly word-for-word from
original TCS - and it\'s worthless, because T4 doesn\'t have a space
combat system capable of dealing with large ships and fleet actions.
It also contains obsolete High Guard references.

(2): The sample starships are given in new "ship card" format. The
ship cards are full of unexplained boxes (what\'s the difference
between an installation and a fitting?), typos ("Armor" appears
twice) and lack boxes for sensors, signatures, structure points, etc.

(3): No illustration of the new starships (unless the Foss art is
supposed to represent one...) (There are descriptions in the text. I
note that Doug seems to have a fascination with long flared cylinders...
but I won\'t comment on it, much.( "Sometimes a giant cylindrical space
dreadnaught is just a giant cylindrical space dreadnaught" - Siilgmun
Freed, noted Vilani psychoanalyst.)

(4): The FFW equivalent is completely useless without Pocket Empires -
you need PE ratings ("culture" and "infrastructure") to generate
fleets, even if you know a world\'s UPP. Very annoying. It also contains
lots of no-longer-meaningful High Guard concepts ("partial streamlining").


(5): No subsector map is given for the sample FFW scenario, so you
have to buy First Survey

(6): The sample scenario is unwinnable for either side as printed.
(Both sides have fleets of 3-5 moderate squadrons - and SDB ratings
on their homeworlds of 1200 or more; no way those squadrons can even
dent that many SDBs. If anyone had ever playtested the
scenario this would have been obvious, which is disturbing. (The
lesson is "it\'s not nice to fool with a log table" - SDBs are linear
with population (so pop A worlds have 1000s of them) but the number
of battle squadrons a world can support isn\'t; a pop 8 world gets 1,
a pop 9 gets 2, and a pop A gets 4.)

(7): The FFW port is fairly conservative - they could have taken 
advantage of the opportunity to add some chrome/detail, since typical
scenarios are much smaller than FFW. (For example, splitting each 
system up into a "inner", "outer", and "oort" box...or fixing
bombardment, which is broken in FFW (all units take the same
percentage casualties from bombardment regardless of size, so it\'s
as easy to kill a corps as a battalion.) Or rules for battle tenders...
the list goes on.)

(8): The only change I can see to FFW is that damage is taken point-
by-point off of any squadron statistic, as opposed to just the
squadrons defence rating, which renders defence useless.

(9): The official list of important navy positions on a ship doesn\'t 
include a sensor officer :-)

Overall - nice for ropleplayers, mixed for wargamers. (I\'d like to
hear opinions from people who own Pocket Empires - I can\'t tell how
the integration with PE is.)

Okay, say a base of HTML 3.0, no browser-specific extensions, and nothing
fancy (no shockwave, etc).  I generally feel that webpages that are
correct will look good in *any* browser.

As a start, I can see a quick table of contents shaping up as such:

BoilerPlate (IG Home page, welcome, etc)
	About IG (information about IG)
		IG News (company press releases, etc)	
		IG Events (conventions, contests)
		Contacting IG (email addresses, snail mail)
		Submission Guidelines (updated, include online JTAS?)
	Traveller Library Data (Traveller main page)
		Traveller News Service (TNS reprints, new news, if possible)
		Traveller Products (one page per product, includes cover, info, errata
link, possible review?)
			Traveller 4 
			FFS2
			Milieu 0
			...etc...
		Errata (separate errata pages, linked to from Products page also)
			Traveller 4
			FFS2
			Milieu 0
			...etc...
		Traveller Art (Traveller themed artwork, and possible Foss work.  Other
Traveller artist?)
		X-Boat Routes	(links to other Traveller/gaming sites)
		Journal of the Traveller\'s Aid Society (possible online JTAS -big
maybe-)
			Amber Zones (short adventures)
			Casual Encounters (interesting NPCs)
			Emperors Arsenal (weapon designs)
			Emperors Vehicles (vehicle designs)
			...etc...
		
(All of the JTAS stuff at the bottom is pure speculation at the time, but
would really be neat!)

This is just a rough idea of the site structure, and it will definitely be
refined as construction begins.  With that in mind, I will start on the
creation of a sample site (three to five pages) tonight and have it up for
perusal by this weekend, publish the url on the TML, and get feedback.  I
will also initiate a discussion on the TML tonight and gather
ideas/wants/etc.

I expect to be able to pound out a page every couple of days (especially
with the products pages) and could build this site in a couple of weeks in
my spare time, and spend a Saturday morning every other week updating and
maintain the site.  Of course, this site won\'t have any feedback
facilities like the readers survey or online ordering.  Those could take a
lot longer)

Lewis Roberts has sent me the TNE data for the Diaspora Sector
(which has been incorporated into the latest version (2.3) of
Galactic). This data was originally from GDW\'s TNE-Deluxe boxed
set. Jeff Zeitlin has sent me the Classic Era data for the
Amdukan Sector (which will be incorporated into the next version
of Galactic). The data was apparently constructed by the HIWG.
Galactic is available from http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jimv (just go
to the programs section). Let me know if you need a copy of
the Amdukan data sent your way (keep in mind that it\'s in
Galactic-format so that the program can read it). I can also
email you the interim version of the program (which already
contains this data), but a general 2.4 release will be out
soonish.

Well, with Rob and I, you make three that I know are having serious problems
with IG. Now I may defend the quality of IG\'s products, but not to put too
fine a point on it; this is totally unacceptable. If this is IG\'s level of
customer support and service (ignoring repeated enquiries and refusing to
acknowledge contact) then the sooner they are gone the better. I *really*
want T4 to continue in publication, but not in the hands of a bunch of
incompetants or crocks (in relation to customer support).

All we have here is isolated data points, anecdotal evidence, and that\'s
not too reliable so don\'t put *too* much credence in them, but I\'ll add
several more data points...

I\'ve talked to people at 5 local stores about T4 products...

Store One is the main RPG store in Pensacola, it orders one of everything,
and restocks when something sells...sometimes.  They *won\'t* special order,
don\'t *like* T4 (the owners seem to be dark and weird fans, if you know
what I mean), but do have lots of used copies of classic and mega T
products lying around.  Their T4 display is small, but as big as their
GURPS or GW display.

Store Two is the oldest store here to carry RPGs, it was more of a wargame
store that did RPG\'s on the side.  Today it\'s mainly a card store (not
magic..greeting), but still stocks rpgs and wargames in the back.  No T4,
they won\'t stock any, the owner said he was badly burned by MT sales..uh,
actually the lack of them.  OTOH, they *will* special order products for
me, IG and otherwise.

Store Three is a new store in Milton, about 20 miles from the city. They
stock TSR, GW, WW, but no IG.  I asked the owner about Traveller products
and got a hostile look, not blank, hostile..I didn\'t want to pursue it with
him.  He said he would special order IG products, but he didn\'t sound
enthused and he wanted 50% of list as a downpayment.  ;-> That gave *me* a
good laugh.  I said I might drop by when Alternity comes out..but I
probably won\'t.

Store Four and Five are comic book stores.  They actually stock a good
range of rpgs, but won\'t touch Traveller.  One volunteered to special order
IG products, one didn\'t mention it.

What *any* of this has to do with the health of IG, I don\'t know, but it\'s
clear IG product is much more rare on store shelves around here than TSR,
WW, or GW products.  It also is apparent that lots of game store
owners/clerks aren\'t too swift when it comes to building markets or
satisfying customers.

Frankly, I\'ve started doing most of my buying mailorder.  I don\'t really
like it, you can\'t browse a book by mailorder, but it\'s easier, cheaper,
and faster than special ordering..and you can\'t *really* browse a special
order either. ;->  

What does this mean?  Nothing about IG, perhaps something about the
industry.

Lewis Roberts has sent me the TNE data for the Diaspora Sector
(which has been incorporated into the latest version (2.3) of
Galactic). This data was originally from GDW\'s TNE-Deluxe boxed
set. Jeff Zeitlin has sent me the Classic Era data for the
Amdukan Sector (which will be incorporated into the next version
of Galactic). The data was apparently constructed by the HIWG.
Galactic is available from http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jimv (just go
to the programs section). Let me know if you need a copy of
the Amdukan data sent your way (keep in mind that it\'s in
Galactic-format so that the program can read it). I can also
email you the interim version of the program (which already
contains this data), but a general 2.4 release will be out
soonish.

   They will still be able to, except now they will have to be dressed in
the garb of a resident of Terra c.1202.  Think long robes, long dresses, and
head scarves (for a 20th c. reference, see pictures of the former Prime
Minister of Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto).  As firearms possession outside the
home is illegal on Terra in that era, they will have to make do with
ceremonial daggers.  Fetishes...well maybe they could look as though they
are *really* having a *good* time reading their copy of the Book of the Faith...

   You sent a carrier pigeon to a house inhabited by six cats?!  No wonder I
never saw it (though it would explain that satisfied look that Luke and R.E.
Lee had the other morning...).  I would of course be reeeeeally interested
in publishing such an article--afterall I invented the multi-gun,
multi-chambered rapid fire fusion weapons system--however, next time around
we have decided instead to run a 15,000 essay about the importance of paying
free lance writers per contract agreements, customer service, quality
control, basic formatting and layout, and determining the proper pricing
structures for serialized product lines.

Hey!

I was trying to keep you out of trouble... now there are folks (well,

You must not be a cat owner. ;-)

My cat likes all kinds of strange things, the thing he goes ape over the
most, even more than fish or meat, are *muffins*. He is especially fond
of carrot muffins. He\'s also fond of several different varieties of
crackers, chips, cheese puffs or nachos. I believe the common ingredient
would be oil -- animal *or* vegetable. (must be cuz it\'s aromatic...)

It goes without saying that at this time of year, I make sure to rinse
out the empty glasses of egg nog... ;-)

Mind you, I\'m *not* a coffee drinker, so I don\'t know what he\'d think of
coffee beans.

Odd you should mention that...

I\'ve been waiting since October myself, as have a few other people here in
the Great White North and in New Zealand.  

The first time this happened to me was with the basic T4 rulebook, which I
preordered back before IG could take credit cards (ie. as soon as it was
announced).  Not only was it not ready for GenCon, but instead of shipping
orders on a \'first-received, first-shipped\' basis, the old IG shipped all
US orders first.  (While assuring those of us here in Canada that our
orders had been shipped, would be shipped shortly, or whatever that weeks\'
excuse was.)  When Sweetpea took over Anne did (finally) ship my
rulebooks, and after a mixup with returning them (they arrived damaged,
and the courier company she wanted me to use didn\'t have a Canadian phone
number) I ended up with some nice rulebook, some damaged rulebooks, and a
couple of supplements to make up for the six-mont wait.  (Too bad one was
Starships!)

Now it looks like the new management is up to the old practices.  My copy
of Emperor\'s Vehicles was only shipped after I queried the charge on my
VISA.  I was _told_ that NAM would be shipped after I queried that charge,
but still haven\'t received it.  And now there\'s a charge for Imperial
Squadrons...

Yes, we had a postal strike.  But the backlog has been cleared now, and
I\'ve received all the mail I was expecting from everyone except IG.  And
IG hasn\'t even had the courtesy to answer my recent emails (sent both from
my address and from Dom Mooney\'s, just to be certain that the message gets
through).

Marc, could you please light a fire under someone?  It was your
intervention that got things back on track last time IG dropped the ball...

And you had made mention of bird\'s nest soup, and assorted other... 
substances that people eat. 

Of course, the comment about cockroaches came back with a comment from me;


and, of course, the fact that they are the second grossest critters on   
the planet (after spiders) has nothing to do with it...                  


(because, of course, they are the 2nd grossest critters on the planet

It\'s actually a \'cat-like\' creature, omnivorous, that lives somewhere in
the indonesian islands. It eats the coffee fruits, and excretes the
undigestible seeds, IE beans. 

An old roomate of mine lived in Jamaica for a while, and got to see the
real \'Blue Mountain\' coffee plantations. He says that coffee fruits are
actually really tasty, reminiscent of cherries. The caffeine and other
alkaloids in coffee beans are to make the seeds unpalatable to the birds
and small mammals who eat the fruits, who then pass the seeds through
their digestive tracts unchewed, spreading the seeds around. Not an
uncommon plant reproductive strategy <Hu hu he said \'reproductive\' hu hu>. 

What is uncommon, and uncommonly pretentious, is collecting the digested
beans and making coffee out of them.

The special edition video that came with the trilogy boxed set includes this

Wow.  I\'m very impressed.  If IG doesn\'t take these pages on, that is the
final sign that something is sriously *wrong* in la-la land.

One suggestion.. In places with long lists of choices, organize them into a
table to keep the items from being a single-column list.  A good example
would be the Links page.

The way I heard it, it\'s a weasel-like animal on Java that eats the berries
and defecates the beans. The beans go through a "fermentation" process in
this animal\'s intestines that give the final product a "rich and deeply
satisfying" taste. The beans are collected, cleaned, roasted and sell for
between 30 and 40 dollars a pound.   

None for me, thank you! ;->

After an evening of Runequest with my old college gaming friend and a
couple of other thirtysomethings, someone noted that thirty-year-olds
play RPGs differently than when they were eighteen.  (Yes, my character
was responsible for much of the sex and violence, but hey -- he didn\'t
start the violence, and where else was he going to spend that big reward
but with a professional companion?)

	Oh, it is, all right.  Apparently _the_ single most important

I don\'t want to resurrect the TNE vs. T4 debates, but I object to the
notion that TNE somehow contributed in any major way to the downfall of T4.

T4 is falling apart under its own bloated weight. TNE for the most part was
a quality, tight set of products. The art lagged a bit, and the last two
products, one of which was produced with some lame clipart, were subpar,
but for the most part, the TNE products were far superior to 95 percent of
the T4 products that have been published.

With three competing design and mechanics systems, who can blame players
from being confused and discouraged with T4. For an RPGer, that\'s like
buying a house and then finding out that the foundation is made out of
particle board. At least with TNE you had *one* coherent system.

HTML 3.0 won\'t do it for Lynx; I think you\'ll have to stick to
2.0 or even 1.0.  Or at least avoid things like tables that are
part of the late specs but not the early specs.

Include the IG FAQ here, also forthcoming products and
publication schedule.

=46WIW, I originally intended Freelance Traveller to be a sort of
JTAS-Plus On-Line; if the New IG Page can come up with a nice
visual theme, I\'ll re-do Freelance Traveller to match, and it can
be used as the JTAS-equivalent.  That saves you as IG page
maintainer some effort (and gets FT some extra publicity <grin>).

There is an important issue on reviews: If you are the "official
voice", are you going to want/be permitted to have negative
reviews?  Negative reviews (as for Starships) will have the
effect of discouraging purchase; I could easily understand IG not
wanting this to occur.  OTOH, if there are only positive reviews,
the reviewers all risk being viewed as "bought and paid for"
publicists for IG, and their comments will be discounted.

Certainly, having reviews will be beneficial in that it will
allow potential purchasers to make _informed_ decisions; on that
basis, I support the idea of having reviews.  But that first
issue is pertinent.

Absolutely.

You might want to contact Chris Cox and Mike Linsenmayer.  Both

I would encourage _everyone_ here to visit the site and give
feedback on it; _I_ certainly intend to.  I wish I could have
gotten more feedback on Freelance Traveller - which, I admit, is
in need of updating; right now, I\'m working on a New Look for it
- - the next update should have more features and a "slicker" look.

There\'s a lot of pre-built stuff out there for handling feedback;
write me privately if you\'re interested in pursuing the idea;
there\'s info I\'ll need to know about your host before I can
advise you properly.

But at higher TL\'s the increased selectivity and sensitivity will deal with
the S/N ratio problems.

Wrong Assumption, a transmitter putting out CW will last longer than one
putting out a PRF pulse. It has to do with the turning on and off of the
the transmitter. Hot Cold etc Thermo breakdown. Besides they don\'t wear out
they just have descrete compenents that break down due to thermobreakdown.

Not true by todays use, even more so in the far future. I can think of
several scenarios that make it difficult to get a FCS.

You are not the only one who is planning on challenging a billing
from IG.  Back in September, they debited my preorder for $20; as
near as I can figure, this was supposed to have been for NAH.
Last month, when they shipped it and the following product (I\'d
have to sort through the pile to see which one it is), they
debited my account _twice_ for $20.  IOW, I got billed twice for
a single product.

I also specifically requested that I _either_ be notified in
advance of billings _or_ that an invoice be included with the
shipment (I have email to and from Ann about this); this is to
ensure that my records are kept up to date.  I have yet to see
either happen.  I have reached the point where I consider IG\'s
business practices to be ethically questionable _at_best_; there
is certainly reasonable cause to believe that some of them may be
outright illegal.  I can no longer view this as disorganization
and inexperience; it has gone on long enough, and with enough
complaints from readers of this list that I can only assume that
there is premeditation and intent behind these practices.  If IG
does not shape up, I will consider myself morally obligated to
notify the Attorneys General of New York (where I am) and
California (where IG is) in an effort to have these problems
corrected.

    'body' => 'The reintroduction of the skirt in the Old Earth Union

During the later years of the Interstellar Wars and the Rule of Man, the
skirt and dress entirely disappeared, replaced by the ubiquitous unisex
jumpsuit or slacks and shirt combination which came to dominate fashion
throught the Rim during during the Long Night. Many reasons have been
advanced for this; the final achievement of equality between the genders,
the abandonment of luxury under the presure of the Vilani threat, the lack
of practicality of the dress or skirt in space etc. None of these reasons
hold up to close scrutiny, but it remains that for some reason over a 200
year period the dress and skirt vanished from humaniti\'s collective wardrobe,
not to return for some 2000 years.

Naturally after so long an absence, the return of the skirt has been marked
by controvesy and scandal. The first inciling of the return can be found in
Yokio Verruchi\'s summer collection intorduced on Terra in 4537AD (year 18
under Imperial reaconing). Her use of a colourful short breach clout [a very
short apron like accessory] over a traditional shirt/trouser combination
created a storm of comment at the time. Most orthodox designers condemed it
as a pointless fad, but next season many young and upcomming designers had
worked the breach clout into their offerings; and they were to been seen on
many daring socialites of both genders.

The next major development came in 4544AD (25 Imperial). Over the intervening
years the breach clout had been gradually achieving more acceptance, having
become almost respectable in certain circles. However the entire Old Earth
Union was scandalised when Ulongo M\'bow took the basic breach clout and
turned it into a complete wraparound. Many commentators where shocked by this
development, claiming it drew far too much attention to the hips and buttocks.
Several major retail chains refused to carry any of M\'bow\'s designs as a
result. However it did catch on with a minority of the young and the scandal
may have actually aided it\'s acceptance in certain circles; it is interesting
to note that Hine Gordon (founder of the Hellfire Movement) was seen wearing
a wraparound on a number of occassions before her death. However despite
this, the wraparound remained an item only worn by the daring for at least a
decade.

The next stage was slow in coming and notable for being far more widely
adopted by women than men. In 4557AD (38 Imperial) Yokio Verruchi took what
now appears the minor step in transforming the short wraparound into a short
overskirt (still worn as an accessory over trousers or a jumpsuit). Even
though this was on the surface a very minor innovation, it caused a greater
scandal than M\'bow\'s introduction of the wraparound. Most of the fashion
establishment was agast at Verruchi\'s 57 winter collection. Compaired with
the soft lines of the wraparound, the overskirt\'s hard lines were regarded
as altogether too provocative. Even amongst the \'smart set\' in which the
wraparound was now widely accepted (if still considered daring), the
overskirt was very slow in being adopted. However Verruchi perservered with
it. In her 58 summer collection, she lengthed the overskirt and added a soft
flowing flounce [attachment at the back, similar in effect to a bustle] with
a light fabric cascade.

Over the next few years Verruchi\'s designs where characterised by the both
the developing overskirt and the flounce (added to both wraparounds and more
conventional trousers and jumpsuits). Slowly Verruchi\'s overskirt and flounce
were taken up by other designers; and while they have yet to achieve even
the limited social acceptance of the wraparound, they are both now well
established as independent fashion trends. As previously noted, the overskirt
was not adopted in mens fashion until well into the 4560\'s and is still a
much less common feature in men\'s fashion than in women\'s.

This situation remained relatively static for the next nine years or so.
However over this period there was a slow trend for the overskirt to lengthen
(going from just below the hip in Verruchi\'s intial offering, to just below
the knee in Adam Frazers 65 summer collection). However the entire fashion
industry was taken aback in 4566AD (47 Imperial) when Jane Husaski unveiled
her summer collection. In this she took the overskirt, lengthened it to mid
calf, and made it an idependent garment; doing away with the trousers or
jumpsuit entirely. The resulting uproar made the scandals surrounding the
wraparound and overskirt seem positively tame by comparison. Claims that she
was perverting public morals were leveled at Husaski; and one socialite was
even charged and convicted of leud and indecent behaviour for wearing one of
Husaski\'s creations to a diplomatic function. Numerious politicans called for
such lacivious clothing to be banned and many social commentators decried
it as a sign of imminent social collapse. Many are still outraged by the
appearance of a skirt as a solo garment.

Naturally, this almost universal condemnation by \'the establishment\' lead to
cautious popularity amongst the young. Many daring young men and women were
soon to be seen wearing shirt and skirt combinations without the benefit of
trousers (clothing sure to get one barred in respectable resaurants). The
situation was further confused in 4571AD (53 Imperial) when a year before her
death Verruchi combined the overskirt with the shirt to produce a high thigh
length dress worn over trousers (another development decried in polite
society).

I must say that (shock!horror!) I agree *entirely*. The Physical Product that
GDW produced was always either top quality (CTrav and MTrav) or not too far off
(TNE). IG don\'t have a clue.

On the other hand, notice that I haven\'t once mentioned the *background* of TNE!

This is where we have to part company. I think that the TNE background and
technology was so flawed that I cannot agree.

My take on it, is that given the basic formula of five times the square
root of the effective energy output at the range, if you have a bigger
number than their armour factor, then they are in trouble, and if you dont,
then they arent.

ROF shouldnt count for much if you cant do internals, although surface
damage may be an issue for ships with surface areas that are 99% used by
sensors, radiators and such (part of why I like battery-powered starships -
no surface area required). I can also see a case for surface damage
disrupting the Lanthanum grid for starships - possibly a modification of
one per surface hit to the misjump roll, unless you get somewhere quiet, a
vacc suited engineer and a couple of cans of lanthanum-rich paint.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, by my own logic the White Lightning should have one
bigger PAW rather than two smaller ones.

Also, I really, really, really dislike the T4/Starships approach of
ablative armour. Armour should either stop the shot and be intact, or not
stop the shot, and have whatever was behind the armour in trouble. Heck,
this approach even cuts down on paperwork - no need to record ablation of
armour value.

But the White Lightning needs more sand. A lot more sand. Sand, especially
clouds of sand big enough to stop the biggest laser at the current maximum
TL, keeps you alive.

Oh yeah, speaking of keeping you alive, has anyone done a design of a ship
optimised against Meson Guns, consisting of a very large, very thinly
arnmoured sphere with *lots* of waste space and *very* heavy component
armour around the actual critical components ? If it\'s a non-starship, then
mass, not volume is the issue (volume does not affect acceleration at all,
when using realistic thrust), and air is very light ...

BTW - real life legal note. Mr O\'Malley is a real lawyer, who heads up the

dangerous drugs. But I know that he has read the draft Employment Services

Not "beef". Beef comes from cattle. Just like pork comes from pigs.

*Everyone* knows that meat from K\'kree is "kreef". Thus leading to the
common expression at some barbecues: "Good kreef!"

Congratulations, Scott!

You\'ve just invented a Sayat art form. Sort of a cross between the
folks who throw paint at the canvas, and the folks who use explosives
for sculpture.

You\'re objecting to something that was never implied.  What I meant was that
the last incarnation of Traveller sold miserably for them, regardless of how
good/bad a system it was.  Years later, they still have just about every TNE
book in overstock.  I can see why they would be hesitant to restock anything
with "Traveller" on it, especially in light of the pitiful quality of T4.  And
it hasn\'t been selling here.  Thus the 20% off bin.

with a couple of questions:

1)  On the Ship Status Sheets (from both the original game set and "Ships of

Arm), almost consistently, there is one (1) communicator for each Remote Pilot
Work 
Station in the TAC.  However, I do not find Communicators associated with 
Submunitions.  Once a Submunition is launched, does it not need to be
controlled by a 
Remote Pilot?  Or, is it given targeting data before being launched?

2)  In light of the previous question, is a Submunition controlled/launched by
a Fire Control 
Work Station?

Lending a peculiarly aesthetic dimension of menace to the catchphrase of
Ms. Hurkiptan of the No. 15 Xenopolitical Investigative Committee: "Betcha
that\'ll blow up real good."  Cf.
www.geocities.com/Area51/Chamber/2662/saynpc.html.

This is also probably the source of the Sayat art-terrorist slang "lighting
up some kreefer".

Speaking of which, did anyone know that marijuana, passed through the first
stage of K\'kree digestion, is worth a fortune on the black market?
"Psst... wanna score some cud?"

I feel it would be appropriate to call you on your discrimination towards
non-readers and differently sighted persons, as evidenced by your use of
oppressively written standards of communication; and more than that, your
preferential treatment of those economically and socially privileged
fractions of the people of the world who have access to the internet.
Furthermore, I must deplore your complicity in the ongoing hegemony of
English.  Or Proto-Galanglic, as the case may be.

I do intend to keep the pages as simple as possible.  I gave a copy of
Lynx, and have been checking the pages to make sure that they will degrade
as gracefully as possible.  Tables are almost too useful to give up.

>Include the IG FAQ here, also forthcoming products and

Excellent idea!  This is a must do.

Any decisions on the JTAS stuff will be made later, but thanks for the
offer.  This just might be the optimum solution.

Yep, it\'s IG\'s call as to whether these pages will be adopted or not, and
it\'s really up to them what goes on it - especially anything as touchy as
a review.  Luckily, it\'s not my call. :)


>You might want to contact Chris Cox and Mike Linsenmayer.  Both

Yes, I just got email from Mr. Linsenmayer with two *very nice* pictures
attached.  If anyone else is doing Traveller themed art and would like it
on these pages, I\'ll take it.  I would like to place a couple of pieces
from each artists on the page, and then a link to their site with their
other works.

I\'m kind of undecided about what to do about feedback  ( I maintain a
corporate intranet for a living), since I know nothing about IG\'s current
setup, server, or anything else.

Also, If anyone else has any links to add to the links page, send them to

Your command is my wish.  there will be a \'Last updated\' line on the

    'body' => 'Okay, now to lay to rest a few things about pirates and sensors in my mind,
and hopefully other\'s minds too.

The whole pirate and sensor issue often denotes that pirates are practically
broadcasting that they are pirates by the fact that they don\'t have their
transponders active. Would you get near a ship that did not have its
transponders active? Of course not! So what is a greedy pirate to do? Steal
a transponder or create a forgery. This would allow the pirates get close
enough to another ship to attack, threaten, or cajole.

But alas, we forget, when there is money to be had, many other ways will be
found. So just a few ideas..... <grin><maniacal laugh><heeehehe, haahaahar>
(oh, okay, more than a few)

(Note: for clarity, though it might be redundant, I have capitalized Pirate,
and called the victims of the Pirate Ship(s) Targets. A Target ship can
either mean a ship of plundering opportunity or even planned piracy)

- -A Pirate ship with a regular transponder, can get close enough to a target
ship to threaten with superior fire power.
- -A Pirate ship can send off a Mayday / Signal G.K. to attract a Target ship
to rescue, then attack.
- -A Pirate ship might be able to lay-in-wait in "stealth mode" (a ship with a
low sensor signature)
- -Pirates could create limpet missiles or limpet mines that attach to a ship,
and then threaten to blow the Target ship up if they don\'t surrender.
- -A Pirate ship could pose as Imperial inspectors to board and attack.
- -Pirates could hide in cargo containers in the cargo hold of the Target
ship.
- -The right Pirate ship could out maneuver the Target ship, 1G vs. 2G+ and a
good computer system (to match and maintain vectors) to approach and clamp
down and grapple another ship.
(Remember, not all ships are armed)
- -Pirates with a small ship (a powerful fighter) could subdue a Target ship
and send in a boarding party using a launch. And then if needed dump some
cargo and stash their small Pirate vessels in a cargo hold and jump out of
system.
- -A Pirate ship could use jammers so Maydays could not be detected by the
local System Defense.
- -A Pirate ship could use a EMP missiles to knock out the ship. Of course
they would have to be careful with this one, else the Pirate ship could be
knocked out too. Though pirates who do this are out for cargo only because
the EMP would totally waste a ship\'s electronics.
- -If a Pirate ship can knock out a Target\'s weapons, sensors, and maneuver;
the Target ship would be a sitting duck (yes, a tall order). Most of these
things will be found on the surface of a ship (just polish that ship\'s
surface), leaving that soft interior ready to plunder. Especially without
sensors, things get difficult if the Targeted ship cannot see what is
attacking, no counter-attacking or evading. (Of course, this depends what
kind of maneuver drives are used, Plates or HEPLAR)
- -Pirates could sabotage a Target ship by sneaking on board and cause
problems of all sorts. Such as a virus in the computer system that makes a
ship jump to a secluded location, with pirates laying in wait.
- -Pirates could pose as passengers... (done many times before, I know, but it
still has possibilities)
- -Pirates would find that planets orbiting gas giants make perfect plunder
areas because it takes forever to leave the 100dia limit, thus increasing
the opportunity to make a move.
- -Pirates could lay-in-wait at a common exit or entrance vector. I imagine
that ships will exit and enter systems within common vectors, since a ship
needs to match vector with destination.
- -Pirates most likely will have someone at port that can spy and give info
about leaving ships... where the Target ship is going, what cargo it is
carrying (and select high value cargoes).  Then a signal can be sent to the
Pirate ship ready to pounce.
- -Remember, a Pirate that successfully pirates a heavy hauler with the right
cargo (spies again) would only need to do so often. High returns mean less
ships that need to be pirated.
- -A Pirate ship could lay-in-wait on a backwater, low tech, low ship traffic
world. Even better is getting a Targeted ship to go to that world by the
Pirates commissioning cargo to be taken there.
- -Pirates when they can, would of course take the whole ship, and either use
it for themselves, forge papers for it and sell it, or even have a Chop Shop
cut it up and sell or use the parts.
- -Pirates would try to obtain accurate long range weapons to disable Target
ships at distance, and then move in.
- -Pirates could use asteroid ships (always fun), being disguised as a rock
often gives surprise advantage upon a Target ship.

Overall cunning, superior firepower, and surprise will make a Pirate gang
successful.

Have fun with these. Open for comments, debate, and just lots of pirate fun.
Some will work better than others.

Okay once again this image of IG putting out nothing other than crap raises
it\'s ugly head. Now I have some very real (read huge) problems with the way
that IG conducts business; to the extent that I\'m seriously considering
taking legal action against them. But that concerns them delivering their
products, not the products themselves.

Just what is wrong with the physical product produced by IG? Full of errors?
Well generally not. Yes Starships and First Survey were utter disasters,
the basic rulebook had two serious ommissions (but an errata was produced
in a timely fashion), Fire Fusion and Steel had one serious ommission
(but again an errata was forthcoming) and Emperors Vehicles had one
mindboggling error (no TL data). Just how many errors are there in
Central Supply Catalog, Aliens Archive, Mileau O, Emperors Arsenal, Pocket
Empires, Psionic Institutes, Anomolies, Naval Architects Handbook, Imperial
Squadrons, The Long Way Home, Gateway, The Referee\'s Screen, Journal 25 or
Journal 26? That\'s 2 disasters (Starships, FS); 1 very poor (EV); 2 could
do better (T4 rules, FFS) and 15 good to excellent. Hardly a constant stream
of crap.

Layout problems? I\'m a professional graphic artist. My job depends on layout
and delivering information in a concise and interesting manner. I would say
that all of IG\'s products achieve that goal. The charts grouped at the back
idea was interesting, it has proved to have more minuses than pluses, but it
was a worthwhile experiment. The now infamous typo in FFS, well I have no
idea how that got through; an utter failure from setting to binding, but it
is just one out of twenty products. The cover and interior art. I was taught
that if an illustration does not directly relate to a text block, make sure
it stays seperate (failure to do this risks confusing the reader). IG seems
to be following this sound basic rule. As to the choice of the art itself,
well that is a highly individual thing; what one person loves, one will hate;
but I would say it achieve the basic goal of grabbing the attention or
breaking up section (these are the true roles of unrelated illustrations).

As I say, I think IG\'s business practices are highly questionable and quite
possibly illegal; but the actual quality of their products is generally
quite professional. They have had three real clunkers, but that is only three
out of twenty.

Scientific American, January 1998, page 34.)

To briefly summarize for our literacy-impaired Sayat members:

A chap named John Long wondered whether the shock wave from an underwater
explosion would tenderize meat. (This was a spin-off from his day job in
nuclear weapons design!)  After much experimenting with C4, he discovered:

Yes, shock waves to tenderize meat, but only work properly for boneless
cuts. A shockwave to a whole side of beef (or presumably, kreef) fails
because the bones alter the characteristics of teh wave and leave some
parts tough while others are pulped.

The shock wave causes tiny tears in the tissue that keeps muscle fibers
orderly, hence the tenderization effect. The fats and oils responsible for
flavour are unaffected. The waves also seem to kill some of teh bacteria
that eventually spoil meat.

The hydrodyne method (sounds safer, doesn\'t it) could be commercialized by
1999.

Vacuum is even *lighter* and doesn\'t transmit shockwaves.

I\'d go for a *very* dispersed (and redundant) structure with an "outer

   I wouldn\'t say so much clueless as erradic, the result of a mentality
that advocates the proposition that if you can crank out enough
sourcebooks (good, bad, or ugly), eventually enough of them will be of
adequate quality to keep the fans coming back for more.  Gaia help those
who insist of buying everything to keep their Traveller collection
complete--you\'re approaching the "I could have put together a killer
\'Magic: The Gathering\' deck and won back some of the money I\'ve invested
at tournaments" level.

   You\'re so blinded by your hate of TNE you\'ve missed the point. 
Whether or not you *liked* the way TNE went about constructing the
universe, it was at least a coherant system (of course it wasn\'t
perfect, as everyone who remembers the original TNE energy weapons will
recall, but no simulation of "future reality" is).  "T4" as it stands
right now does not have a coherant system.  Anticipation is growing that
"T4.1" will *finally* wrap everything together with a nice bow, which of
course only serves to heighten the expectations for it to (IMHO)
unrealisitic levels.

  No, but a constant stream of product *all* of which that could have
been better, whether the problem is formatting, lack of knowledge of the
Traveller universe, poor overall quality, errata, missing information
(those non-errata items that were excluded that should have been
included: incomplete explanation of things or concepts, things that
require clarification that weren\'t), etc.  OK, no product is ever
perfect (the stuff produced by BITS comes as close as IG will ever get),
but all IG products seem to lack that little extra something intangible
that says that the publisher cares about what goes on the door and
ultimately ends up in your Traveller collection.  I honestly think that
it stems from the fact that those running IG on a day-to-day basis are
not gamers (and especially not RPGers).  They no more understand the
common RPG fan (or the business of selling to them) than I understand
advanced diferential equations.

   And what of basic ergonomics?  As a graphic artist, you should be
aware that being forced to flip back and forth constantly in a manual
can be one of the most frustrating things a reader runs up against.  You
should also be aware that the only reason that you include all the
charts and tables in the back of a book is to *simplify* formatting, not
make a product concise or interesting.  Honestly, if you think that
Imperium Games does a good job on layout in that regard, I\'d hate to see
the budgets and time constraints you are forced to work under--your
place of work must resemble an ancient galley ship.

>The now infamous typo in FFS, well I have no

   There are typos and basic bad grammar in other sourcebooks as well,
evidence of hastily done layout with no quality control.  The classic
error that GDW ran into with the first printing of MegaTraveller--no
lessons learned here.

   Evidently you never tried to design a ship using the basic "T4"
manual.  The design process is interupted in at least a couple of places
by illustrations are in no way related to the text, and the color full
page illustrations are particularly bothersome.

   We agree at least in part here.  I do not care for Mr. Foss\' work as
it relates to Marc Miller\'s Traveller, but I can not fault it in the way
that it is technically executed either.  Good stuff that doesn\'t
fit--sort of like hanging a Cezanne or Monet in a gallery full of High
Renaissance art.

   With regard to the use of art, in some sourcebooks it has been
adequate, in others it clearly is not--consistent inconsistency being an
IG hallmark, I\'m not surprised.

>As I say, I think IG\'s business practices are highly questionable and quite
>possibly illegal; but the actual quality of their products is generally

   While IG\'s business practices show inexperience at handling public
relations, and verge on criminal behavior with regard to their treatment
of freelancers (an area where they are actually similar to other RPG
companies--the whole industry could do with an US Justice Department
investigation), it is in the area of layout and design that IG clearly
is *unprofessional*.  I\'m left feeling that when they have gotten it
right, it was because somebody else formatted it and they didn\'t tinker
with it (FF&S was cocked up *after* it arrived at IG), or the layout for
the product was so easily executed that even the personnel they are
using (no doubt working under extreme time pressure) could get it
right.  

   Unquestionably the time and effort that Marc Miller is putting into
"T4.1" will show how such product *should* be executed, provided he
handles layout locally in Illinois.  Maybe he should send it to a local
printer there too....

Regards,

Harold

P.S. I find it interesting that while I\'m willing to cut IG perhaps a
few millimeters of slack with regard to their business practices, Andrew
apparently is not, while on the other hand he willing to cut them slack
on product quality while on the other hand I am not for the most part. 
Different priorities?

Not sure if that\'s an insult or not, guess I\'ll play.

Actually it usually resembles a madhouse (I have to produce under the
industry standard impossible deadlines). Yes putting all the charts at the
back is mainly a formatting decision, but I don\'t know about you, but after
four or five designs I generally only use the tables and charts having
learned how the system works so I don\'t need the text. IMHO the best format
layout for charts and tables is in a seperate book, the first time I saw
the charts at the back (PE IIRC) I saw it as an attempt to achieve that.
Photocopy the charts and see what I mean.

Check anything, there are typos and grammer errors in any lengthy first
edition. It goes with the territory. IG does do worse than many, but most are
"invisible" (ie they don\'t show up in casual reading). Its is evidence of
poor proofing but not of poor layout.

To be honest no. I use a text printout of QSDS. As a personal choice I
prefer text without illustrations. Yep that section has too many full page
illustrations, but they are full page. This is much better than the usual
half or quarter page illustrations that seem to be scattered at random through
alot of RPG material. Plus it would seem that IG has learnt at least a little
since then (interor full colour was abandoned with Starships IIRC).

To my eye it does fit with Traveller. It is the sytle of art that was common
on the SF books I read when I first started playing Traveller (as an aside
I don\'t care for the style, my tastes are fairly "minimilist", but the style
itself does attach to Traveller in my mind). If I had to choose cover art
for Traveller, I would go for block colour pics al la the old CT boxed
starter edition and modules (Tarsus and Beltstrike), but that is as I say
a highly personal choice.

The use of art has shown a clear evolution. I am annoyed that much in IS was
recycled from other products. But if you look at it, interior art is now
used as a chapter break, screened background logo or descriptive illustration
and has been for since EA if my memory serves me. Sure the screened logos can
get a little irritating (don\'t put them on every second page). This state has
been true for sometime. I am particularly fond that IG only uses full page
non-descriptive illustrations.

I have tried to recreate the FFS error by importing the text into pagemaker,
freehand, illustrator, quarkXpress as word, rtf, and plain text and I just
can\'t do it. That error still leaves me baffled (I suspect a font conversion
problem). When I look at IG\'s products I am left with a feeling of adequate,
there are things that could be done better (like you I suspect that they
don\'t have a good graphic designer on staff) but it understandable and
nothing generally leaps out and screams at me.

Other than the T4 rulebook (my copy was badly setoff on the inside cover)
I don\'t think anyone can fault the physical printing job of IG\'s printers!
I have yet to see any hickeys, setoff (other than in the T4 rulebook),
misregistration, colour variation etc.

Layout is easy to get wrong, business is not. Listen to your customers,
acknowledge correspondance, pay your writers, give your writers clear and
understandable guidelines. Just how hard is that? Please note, I am willing
to cut IG slack on layout but not on content.

I was trying, however the physical limitations (minimum requirement of a
top speed of Mach 750 along with a 300,000 metric tonne cargo capacity, all
using only 8 raindeer for motive power) have as yet proved insurmountable.
Plus when one moves into space, you have to add jump 500. Perhaps a working
group is in order.

I\'ve not seen the trailers, but I\'m an admitted LIS fan :^)  A couple weeks
ago I noticed my favorite Comic and Game shop had LIS cards, so I got the
manager to build me a set.  Some of the more common specialty cards are
movie preview cards.

Be interesting to see what they do with the movie.  It has always been one
of my favorite Sci-Fi TV shows, but I\'ll be the first to admit that almost
all the episodes were pretty atrocious!  Still the first six or so were
awsome, and I\'ve always loved the ship.

Depends... generally leaving something on causes some wear and turning
something on and off causes some wear.  Depending on how bad each of these
are, there\'s a break point when it\'s better to leave it on all the time.

You can\'t engage something you don\'t see...  it would most likely be
easier to hit a broadcasting target so noone would want to broadcast...

   I have discovered the cargo capacity issue is easily solved with a
bit of TL 21+ technology.  All it takes is a pocket universe with an
access port built into the sleigh.  This also allows Santa to take along
additional support staff and warehouse facilities.

   As far as performance characteristics are concerned, once again TL
21+ technology comes to the rescue.  There would be no jump drive, as
transport between systems would be handled via psionic transfer drive or
perhaps a series of teleportation gates a la Secret of the Ancients (one
for each inhabited system).  Sublight drive performance required could
be provided by the reindeer provided they were genetically engineered
for this purpose.  Since we already know they can fly, it can safely be
assumed this has already taken place (btw, bad Mexican food would
provide lift but not propulsion).

OK, it\'s on again. I\'m goanna go through these one by one, but the basic
Piracy Problems remain.

(1) any ship well armed enough to be able to consistently win against
civilian ships, let alone a lighgt escort, is going to attract notice

(2) when a pirate jumps insystem, does he use his "cover" ID, or her "real"
Pirate ID 

(3) every time your target gets a message off, you need a new fake ID.

How do you know how a "target of opportunity" is armed, or what it is
carrying, or how good it\'s crew is, before you engage ?

Trust me, plannend targets (preferably with the cooperation of the crew)
are the way to go. But technically, that is Barratry or Skipping, not Piracy.

>

Not if I\'m the target\'s Captain. If someone is bearing down on me, we are
going to Red Alert, and notifying the authorities.

If it\'s a frontier system, you are getting a warning shot too.

If it\'s outside the frontier, forget the warning shot.

>- -A Pirate ship can send off a Mayday / Signal G.K. to attract a Target ship
>to rescue, then attack.

What if they send a launch or ships boat, and hang out at range ? Or even
better, what if they too are "ethically challenged" and decide to lase you
while you are a sitting duck, just to be sure. I mean, a cargo full of
maneauver drive and power plant will cover at least six months worth of
payments ...

Lay in wait where ? Near the planet will make you real obvious to the
Planetary Aithorities, and why in the name of Cleon Zhunatsu will any
trader go further than outside the jump limit ?

>- -Pirates could create limpet missiles or limpet mines that attach to a

I\'m curious. How do you propose to get the limpets onto the target hull
without them noticing ?

>- -A Pirate ship could pose as Imperial inspectors to board and attack.

OK ... I guess you could. It\'d get the Imperium real upset at you. You\'d
need a suitable ship (I dunno about you, but my Imperial Representitives
dont hang out on 100t Scouts or 200t Far Traders). It could also be
interesting explaining why the Imperial Inspector is carrying such a large
handgun.

Possible, but what if the cheapskate captain doesnt fund Life Support in
the hold, and stacks the boxes in frames so they must be loaded and
unloaded in a specific order ?

Will this take longer than (a) the target ship creating a jump solution or
(b) the local starport\'s Piracy Patrol (say, 2 Drachen Jaeger fighters or
one White Lighning Class Frigate <pulls 6Gs, plus HePLAR afterburners for
another 3G. NB Famile Spofulam reccomends a safe operating acceleration of
5Gs, as the G-compensation is only rated at 4Gs>) turns up ?

This is essentially requiring a fixed base, to locate the fighter and
launch(s). This gets real dangerous when the target squirts off a signal.

OTOH it is a far more low-capital affair than a 200 dt pirate ship, so it
might happen. Plant a couple of quonoset huts on some moon, drop the
fighter and launches off out of your Far Trader and hope.

Ummmm, the use of the Jammers themselves will, I think, show up like dogs
balls. And how do you jam the ship\'s Laser Comm from a distance ?

EMP weapons are fundamentally nuclear arent they ? Coool. I\'ve always
wanted to use one of those Coronation Class Battleships.

Pirates have to cope with this as well. And civilians find it much easier

Inteeligence Group Four think they are, forcing all the starports to report
all battle damage repairs ?

Look, if you get people on board, just hijack the Target.

OK, OK, you will have to explain why the Captain and crew are now
different, and why the payments stop being made on it, and so on, but OK.
It\'s only paperwork.

>- -Pirates could pose as passengers... (done many times before, I know,
but it

Hijacking has it\'s own problems. Most of which involve having the passenger
compartment have very very very limited access to essential areas. And, in
an emergency, passengers are advised they have 30 seconds to get into their
cabins, after which the corridors have the air evacuated from them. Oh
yeah, and we start strobing the gravity outside the cabins as well.

True. However, the planet too would know this. Fighters are *cheap*,
especially if you leave off unneccessary stuff like EMM masking. Just give
me 3 gees and a 600 megajoule laser, and a cheap sensor package.

And attract absolutely no attention, right ? No pesky Planetary Defense
fighters wandering over to check your paperwork ? The Third Imperium doesnt
*have* 15-mile limits or right of innocent passage. They have the right to
stop and search *at will*.

*sigh* Think for a second how useful such an operation would be for an
Enemy Power at war with the Imperium. The various Imperial intelligence
agencies will follow similar logic, right ?

Me, I wouldnt put it past those INI bastards to try and set up a couple of
such networks, pirating carefully chosen targets, just to find the weak
points before it becomes serious. I\'m sure Ling Standard would co-operate -
we could kick back the values of ships lost with a very small amount of
padding on a Naval contract.

High value cargoes are tend to have crack crews and excellent equipment. At
least when I\'m building ships to carry megacredit a displacement ton cargoes.

You need bloody good contacts and reasons to get det laser missiles on
civilian shipping. Nahh. Never happens. The Navy would never allow it.
Chances of them getting into the wrong hands are just too high. It\'s never
happen. Honest.

Yup. That works. Could be difficult pulling it off multiple times though.

True. First catch your pigeon.

What you are describing is the reasons varuious people have postulated a
series of stepped Weapon Permits for the Third Imperium.

And if you think that the Starport officials are going to go "Oh. Thats a
Famile Spofulam 256 megajoule particle accelerator on that Far Trader.
Coool, see the chromium streaks down the barrel, Jake ? That Hengbar sure
knows his weapons", then I have this bridge to sell you.

>- -Pirates could use asteroid ships (always fun), being disguised as a rock

How many asteroid freighters have you seen. Seriously. Do the numbers.
Under FFS2 the hull itself is a seriuosly small part of total ship costs.

Now, given the fact that asteroids on intercept courses are Not Common, how
is your target going to react ?

>
>Overall cunning, superior firepower, and surprise will make a Pirate gang
>successful.

Having a secure base with repair and refit capability and a system of
protection against people coming after you and a way of getting rid of
captured cargoes will make you successful.

Amateurs talk tactics. Professionals talk logistics.

And the logistics of piracy are just horrific, particularily in a ruthless
interstellar bureaucracy like the Third Imperium.

Essentially, to make Piracy work, you need a Freeport in a friendly state.
In Traveller terms this means a Type B starport attached to a state that
doesnt mind really, really pissing off it\'s neighbours. In the Vargr
Extents or the Long Night or the Short Nap, sure. But around a strong,
stable Third Imperium ? No Way In Hell.

Give me an expected traffic level and a budget and I will design a System
Security force that will force the "minimum Pirate configuration" out of
sight.

   Actually I was geniunely puzzled by your remarks and wondered where
they were coming from.  Given that you are working in an environment
where people want things yesterday, I understand a little better.

   Sometimes yes, sometimes no.  While it is your personal preference,
many people still need to refer to the text during the design process.

   But by including the charts with the text at appropriate places, you
avoid the need to flip back and forth *and* the need for a seperate book
altogether.  To me, while this approach takes a bit more creativity, it
is worth it because the results are easier to use and speed the learning
process.

   I think perhaps it would work much better if the detail of the scenes
presented had something in them that *looked* Traveller.  Particularly
early on when the color art was literally recycled pieces that had been
previously published, there was nothing there that said "this is
Traveller".  In that respect it was too generic--Traveller art always
found someway to work in people, things, symbols (perhaps at times
symbol overkill) that screamed \'Solomani\' or \'Imperial\' or \'Zhodani\' or
\'Aslan\', etc. to the reader.

   My personal preference would probably go toward some really high
quality, Traveller related Anime-style pics.  There is some stuff out
there that is truly amazing.

   You\'d be surprised.  Sometimes people try to do the right thing but
can\'t (circumstances, lack of time, lack of funds, etc.)--there are also
times that they *can* but *won\'t*, and those are the times that they

Piracy work.  So, I figured I would look at a few Ideas of my own and see
what happens.

1) who needs a spaceport?  Jump ships do *not* have to jump to a star or
starport right?  why can\'t someone astrogate to a specified destination in
virgin space, and drop off a ship there.  Fill it up with a cargo of fuel,
spare parts and so forth. As Time goes on, more and more materials can be
broght there and made to work as a type B starport of sorts...

2) who needs to lie in wait to hit another trader?  Land in port with false
ID.  Get a fake cargo, or low value cargo.  Wait around until someone files
a flight plan for a location indicating time of departure and so forth.
Lift a few moments later than the "prey" and then "unmask" your weapons
when you decide you want them.

3) instead of #2, just have some sort of agent involved who can gather the
flight plan in advance, lift in a ship prior to prey lifting, and "laser
com" the real pirate ship with the particulars.  Put a shot across the bow,
and let the ship "squeal" about being attacked.  If you have time, maybe
place a mine ahead of the ship, and let them run into it if they attempt to
flee.  Otherwise, burn the hull and crew if they don\'t surrender.

 From what I have read about piracy, the thing that makes it work, if you
will, is the fact that merchants don\'t want to be sunk or worse.  Develope
a reputation for killing wayward merchants who fight or run, and be lenient
with merchants that co-operate.  If needed, strafe the homeworld of
merchant captains who don\'t surreneder (one false move, and your planet of
registry gets a midnight raid wise guy!).

  All in all, while not easy, Piracy doesn\'t have to be a matter of
hijacking, nor does it have to be a matter of waiting for a cargo of
opportunity.

  Simple solutions to piracy?  Convoy.  Multiple ships band together and
leave within minutes of each other.  The planetary navy escorts them to the
jump limits, and one by one, they jump.  Also, have "lanes" of exit and
entrance for ships that jump.  This way, the Government doesn\'t have to
patrol everywhere, just the "lanes".  Of course, this makes it easier for
pirates to spot the ships, but then again, with an escort awaiting the
ships...

They are a disussion as to the quality of IG\'s work. To the best of my
knowledge there is no indication that IG is going under; nor has anyone
presented any. Basically these are wild rumours and should be regarded
as such.

No, more than that ... this was discussed quite in depth when it was first
released. The "Race for the Flag" (or whatever its called) Scenario map has no
hex grid, rendering it useless. Many of the other maps have partially invisible
square grids, rendering them marginally useful. The premise of the Plague
scenario is ridiculous and anti-canon. And more.

The reason is obvious ... IG left out the Reindeer Propulsion Table in QSDS! How
much faster does a red nosed reindeer pull the sleigh than a standard one? You
see, without basic information like that you simply can\'t do a design ... yet
*another* example of IG\'s incompetence?

No, I think that you are missing the point. I simply said that I cannot agree
that it was a coherent system. It bent canon way out of shape without once
considering the consequences long, or even short, term, it turned (at the end)
TNE into "just a wargame", it had logical flaws all through it. So it was
*consistently* flawed ... but still flawed. And I think we *can* agree that
we\'ll have to disagree on this one.

No!  IG is not going under. The list has merely been taking certain 
business moves by IG and postulating about the possible significance 
these moves might mean.

My own .02Cr: 

1) There is no reason not to dump Citizens since since they weren\'t 
doing anything with it anyway. 

2) As for JTAS, I like JTAS and I\'d like to see it be a going 
concern. My question is this: where do you get advertising for the 
magazine? Advertising is the only way to make a JTAS a cost 
effective product. They have no cross products to pay for advertising 
space, so where do they go? competitor\'s products? Do you want to see 
Babylon 5 and Star Wars ads all through the magazine? Gurps would be 
ok, I guess, since they are going to come out with Traveller 
products, but that only goes so far, doesn\'t it?  So, you\'re left 
with only a couple of choices. Either go for really cheap production 
values so that subscription fees at least come close to covering 
costs, or dump the product. The first would most likely engender a 
storm of complaints since the readers would most likely expect the 
same sort of production values they get with comparable subscriptions 
that do have good advertising revenues. The latter is what happened.

I wish the best of luck to Marc and those he is working with in 
trying to revive JTAS. I\'d be a subscriber/reader in whatever form it 
might take.

Well, yeah. That\'s a no-win situation - either you use the official

Basically the stuff that *was* in it (and Challange, and the original JTAS): 
fiction, new equipment/vehicles, scenarios, planet write-ups, errata...but 
for god\'s sake make sure the editor knows Traveller this time (no more 
instant FTL communication thank you very much).

> If Citizens of the Imperium is revived what would you want out of it?

What we were promised - discount, magazine, also .maybe the Imperial 
title/land grant idea that was bounced around, or the chance to playtest 
future products.

   Sorry for the "me too", but as a participant in the business
practices discussion, I would like to restate categorically that
Imperium Games is not in any financial difficulties, that is to say that
there is no evidence at this time of any problems.

   Your $87.65 investment is safe until the end of the year, you have my
personal word on it.

   (here\'s hoping he doesn\'t realize there are only four days left in
the year...dohh)

   Seriously, with a new release of the game coming out soon, one that
will hopefully fix at least some of the problems, IG would have to be
loopy to shut down--so they are not.

Regards,

Harold

I don\'t have the book handy, but some races are described as being n times 
stronger than humans, or having greater endurance, or whatever, but the stats are 
still given as being 2d6, same as humans.

> As to the lack of homeworlds, I see this as a plus, I can dump them where

If I was running a game of Twilight:2000, I might decide to move Poland to the 
West of France. It\'s my campaign, I can do whatever I like, and to hell with 
confusing new players or compatibility with any future sourcebooks or adventures 
I might buy.

It\'s the old \'blank maps\' argument again: if you nail down locations for things, 
anybody who wants to move them can, and everbody else can just leave them where 
they\'re \'supposed\' to be. But if you don\'t say where they are, you force 
*everybody* to put them somewhere *different*, so any future books that give a 
location will annoy just about everybody.

I wouldn\'t call wiping out an entire Major Race minor! (Yes, you and I know what 
was really meant, but somebody who\'s new to Traveller is going to be seriously 
confused next time a Droyne pops up). And yes, this isn\'t the only problem with 
the book.

CT & MT used 1.5m/square. TNE used 2m. I don\'t think T4 has ever specified a 
standard. I\'ve *assumed* NAM uses 1.5m, but it doesn\'t say so (or even if all 
plans use the *same* scale).

Which is *still* mangled in Gateway. There are others as well.

Yep, I would be very interested. I\'m going away on holiday on Tuesday for
a week; but then if IG haven\'t at least bothered to respond to my email and
faxes I will start calling in the heavy stuff. One point is that in NZ
law what IG is doing is classified as fraud.

I\'d like to propose that Santa is actually Grandfather... this solves a lot of
questions regarding both figures. The Ancients were apparantly at the top of the
"naughty list", and were not actually given lumps of coal, but the coal symbolized
both the return to early industrial technology (as coal is a fuel source of that TL)
as well as of the charred near-c rocks that rained down upon the Ancients\'
civilizations. Those races which were "good" were rewarded with "new toys" in the
sense of further technological and evolutionary advancement.

You can bet Strephon left milk and cookies for Grandfather on at least one occasion.

For a dirigible, perhaps not, but if we presume that the gengineered reindeer are a
more efficient system than that, it\'s more feasable. As a fuel source, Mexican food
can certainly generate propulsion and power. The carbohydrates store an immense amount
of energy alone, to say nothing of the gasses released in digestion. The spices
involved are frequently experienced too much to be fully understood, although in
sufficient concentrations, they may be capable of generating a thermo-chemical
reaction along with the gasses to create organic HEPlaR drives. ;)

Lift is more a function of the external surface... someone ought to come up with a
Streamlined Reindeer Airframe and relevant construction data.

Isn\'t the "red nose" a form of active sensor and avionics system? Hmm. Perhaps the
other reindeer are also representative of specific ship\'s sub-systems (with their
names being mnemonics for function, perhaps).

This is possible. Doing it while attracting no notice (for eg by data
matching on filed flight plans for the subsector) will be more difficult.

How many ships a month would you need to take to pay for the operation ?

Would this attract attention ?

I also *strongly* disagree with such a makeshift facility being capable of
more than just refueling. No annual maintainence !

If your Target captain is that stupid, he deserves a career change.

Could also be embarressing if you get cross-checked and your records dont
match ("I\'m sorry Sir, according to our most recent records, that
transponder ID is registered to a flying bathtub on Vland.").

Also, how can you tell when a flight plan got filed ? Also, wouldnt flight
plans involve the route to outaside the jump limit, and wouldnt the
Planetary Authorities get ahhh interested if you deviated from your lodged
course ?

Of course, truly twisted IN operatives could set up a ring selling fake
transponder IDs, and then red-card all the numbers out to all starports six
months later, and have anybody using them arrested on sight and their ships
seized, then interrogate them at leisure for any other information they may
have.

How exactly does your man on the inside get at the comms equipment, which

No, the thing that makes it work is having a safe harbour.

BTW, think for a second on what the IN would do if you actually *tried*
that really really dumbshit stunt you mentioned last. I think we are, at
minimum, looking at a Sector Alert, and every damn cruiser available
scouring the space lanes.

Even making such a threat will probably get you shot by a crewmember.

An exceptionally cheap, effictive and simple countermeasure, adopted
throughout history.

Personally, I think Vilani worlds will always be doing this, even when it
is a thousand years or more since the Long Night.

I\'ll be posting a SDB optimised for convoy duties later today. It mounts a
600 megajoule laser, and costs an unbelievably small amount. As a
non-starship, it can be maintained at a class C starport.

Who needs flight plans?  The pirates won\'t be using filed plans to get to
their location, and any body can file a false flight plan, follow it, but
do only a .3 parsec jump instead of a full 1 parsec jump.

>
>How many ships a month would you need to take to pay for the operation ?

Hmmm, let\'s see.  1 ship worth 80 Megacredits (just pulling numbers out of
thin air), versus costs of maybe 200,000 per month... seems like it could
work well enough.  That isn\'t even mentioning the fact you get the cargo
for your own use, or perhaps to sell at a discounted value...


>Would this attract attention ?

Piracy would attract attention, no doubt about it.  Question is, if it is
successful, what can one do about it?  Start investigating - but that was
the whole point of a "protected" port concept, or a "hidden base" concept -
you have to find the pirates to persecute them.


>I also *strongly* disagree with such a makeshift facility being capable of
>more than just refueling. No annual maintainence !

Who needs maintenance?  Just dump the ship getting old, and use the one you
have just taken over.  Mount the weapons on it, and move on...  Kinda like
what the Pirates of Old Terra used to do.  If you got a better ship than
your own, take it, and dump your own.

If you deviated from your course, it is likely you are already in pursuit
of your prey.  What is the reaction time of the planetary forces?  Unless
they keep a ship hot and ready to launch, or have a ship on patrol - you
already have a major head start.  And a pirate should not be launching a
piracy attempt under circumstances that will lead to capture of his own ship.

So the pirates use their own fake codes.  Also, how difficult would it be
to set up a one time legit code via a "newly" purchased ship?  Use once,
and throw away...

I will attempt to ignore the sarcasm here and answer direct:  Mike Johnson,
commo tech at Ruie Space control, has been watching for a juicy cargo.  He
has a private tap into the database of ship flight plans.  Discovering that
a ship is about to leave for some planet within the next 24 hours, he then
sends word to a buddy of his, who then uses a tight beam laser comm unit to
contact a pirate ship with the particulars of the pending departure.  No
need for a 100,000 km laser commo unit - backpack style...

Two things make piracy work.  The first is having the prey give in without
a fight.  While it may work out that the prey ship is destroyed, it doesn\'t
help if the prey (assuming it is armed) manages to not only deprive you of
income via their ship, but also manages to hurt you severely enough that a
patrol ship can capture you later.  The second thing, as you mention, is
the need to be able to unload your cargo in a freeport.

YES!  Exactly!  Point is, if you pulled such a stunt, it will be remembered
for a LONG LONG time, as well as make you a very sought after man.  In real
life, this would amount to the same as the Pirate raid on Panama, or
Tortuga, etc...

>
>Even making such a threat will probably get you shot by a crewmember.

A crew that willingly participates in such an atrocity, is likely to care
less if you make such a threat.  A crew memember who is that squeamish is
likely to lose his own life.  Never underestimate the fear of
self-preservation.  In any case, we are dealing with "PIRATES", not law
abiding citizens.

Taking one ship alone, is a profit situation - assuming there is no damage.
 Even if you only got 1/10th the value of an 80 million credit ship, you
still make a profit of 8 million credits.

Here is a challange for you Ian.  Design your ships, figure out your costs
for running such a set up.  Then compare it with the GPP (Gross Planetary
Product) of the area you are involved with.  Factor in the training costs.
Factor in the wear and tear on the equipment.  Then, design the operations
of the space port authority.  Somewhere, I would be willing to bet you, the
following will occur:

1) you will leave a loop hole where a pirate could concievably wiggle through
2) make it so damned expensive, that commerce suffers, or the government
suffers


Scenario:

Convoy duty has 3 SDB escorting 8 ships about to reach the 50 planetary
diameter limit.  Ships recieve a mayday from a ship that Jumps in, claiming
a major emergency (Gasp - under attack by a pirate perhaps?).  Commander,
by law, must send out a ship.    Now we have two ships on escort duty.
Prior intelligence by the pirates at the starport, have a preplotted convoy
path.  Mines lie in wait - not in the path of the convoy, but to a tangent.
 Upon the convoy reaching the proper location.  A single pirate launches an
attack, attempting to draw off another ship.  Assuming that one ship is
drawn off in pursuit, that is when it runs into a minefield.  Kinda like
digging a pit trap and then waving a red flag just when the bull is on the
other side of the trap with the trap between you and the bull...

  In any case, as a final indignity, one or even two ships in the convoy,
are actually ringers, and upon discovering that there is only one escort -
fire upon that one escort.  One really nasty variable, might be to have a
fighter lying in wait...

  In other words, wolf pack tactics were designed to deal with convoy
escorts.  For any man patient enough to deal with the planning required,
and with the resources required - could conceivably make a pirate raid work.

  I am not saying that the life of a pirate would be easy, nor without
dangers.  There are counters to just about any defense that could be
thought up.  Planet based sensors could be destroyed prior to a raid.  HARM
missiles could be used.  A datanet could be compromised by hackers.  There
seems to be an awful lot of things that could happen to derail an attempt
to come to the rescue of a pirate attacked ship.

  In short, while the piracy has to be well thought out, and perhaps even a
bit lucky, the fact of the matter is, it isn\'t a cut and dried operation
either.

Question:  Suppose a ship has a commo and radar jammer on.  Ship hits prey.
 Prey ship is taken, and ship is launched on a balastic path at tangent to
the original path.  Pirate ship with Jammer then goes inert, and also
launches on balastic trajectory.  No transponders working, no active
powerplant emmisions, crews are in vacc suits.  Now what?

  Well, that is about all for now.

Oh, is this the how many times delayed product that was supposed to be released
for (IIRC) GENCON, or was it ORIGINS? Then for "pre-christmas" and now at some
unspecified future date? I wouldn\'t take all these delays as *necessarily*
meaning that someone at IG wants to a good job this time -- after all, their
track record would not seem to wholeheartedly support such a proposition, would
it now? It it is at least possible that the delays are caused by lack of money
(or the staff and time that lack of money represents().

No, there is no evidence to support this -- just like there\'s no evidence to
support the quaint idea that IG has suddenly got a clue from somewhere (probably
black market, if they have).

Or, to put it another way, believe the existence of T4.1 only when you have it

Well, a suggestion I made a *long* time ago was that a pirate group
could be started by an unscrupulous ship owner who had a misjump land
him near a second imperium deep space naval depot.

Sure, it\'d need repairs, and the tech level certainly is current. But
it could be gotten going again. And if you were careful, you might even
be able to buy the new gear by selling off the old gear to scholars!

You\'d just have to take your time and come up with a good cover story.
Say something about finding some derelist ships in an outer asteroid
belt of some system. That\'d explain the vacuum welding, and cold creep.

Admittedly, this is a "only happens *once*" type setup. But it\'ds be
great for explaining *how* the pirates in the subsectort your players
hang out in survive and get repairs.

> 
> Amateurs talk tactics. Professionals talk logistics.

	If I now take a look on common/canon Traveller settings, I allways
	see that the logistic problem was made solveable by the situation :

	CT : The spinward are frontier, the vargr not far and the sword
	worlders are known for one bussiness - wheeler. Imperial navy able
	to defend the main systems and to protect the main routes, has to
	bundle their assets. Any of the frontier wars started with a suprise
	win of the superior Zhodani. No naval officier wants to risk that
	anything smaller than a Ron moves. So most times systems are on
	their own, if they are wealthy they have a own SDB defense, if not
	" who cares " - the pirates do. A lot of backwater planets are
	willing to coorperate with them. They are called pirates elsewhere,
	but Sir Stoertebecker, a noble knight owner of the 2 SDBs defending
	the sytems from Vargs and Aslan and Zhos. He also owns 2 merchant
	vessels and a patrol cruiser for "escord" and is known for his
	allignment towards swordworlds, openly showing his Letter of Marque.
	Not to forget the continous "wars" between the megacooporations.
	Ai Morai deployed so called "Route Protectors" for their "trade
	war" in the Marches. Thouse are TL:15-3000dt ships.

	MT : In a revolutionary context there is only a small line between
	" fleet commandering of necessary supplies " and plundering. MT does
	even distinct between different kinds of piracy. StarMercs with a
	letter of Marque, Vikings (former Imperial fleets), Corsairs (those
	who have been before 1116, and know the tradition), Rippers (just
	kill and loot) and Lucans troops. Towards the end of MT (1128) only
	a few islands are save. Merchants left the outlands and wilds. Pirates
	have nothing to hunt than other pirates, and the "intelligent" one\'s
	group together to attack the last islands, to have a "stable base
	for repair".

	TNE: The whole plot is around pirates. Trying to distinct between
	the good pirates "Vikings" and the bad ones "Guild". "Smash and Grap"
	are the keywords for Viking operation, together with legal salvage
	and repairs in their save area, while raiding anything around.
	"Slavery", "Drugs", "Weapons" and of course dealing with the Awaken
	(the guild does\'nt have any real production or repair capacity) are
	the keywords for the Guild. Those who are between the chairs (players
	with a free trader attitude) have to arange with one of the sides,
	or can try to make their next overhaul at Promise.

	M4 : The Sylean Trade is just BEFORE its becoming the mighty empire.
	If I look in the basic rulebook, they not even know their entire
	subsector. I hope nobody will claim that they are able to protect
	anything beyond their borders. 1st survey showed that their are not
	even able to collect accurate political data. Anything is frontier
	and the hidden base of the well known pirate can be 5 parsecs away.
	I would expect that their systems are well defended, even Baranik
	would have an SDB (surplus revenue cutter to be more precise). But
	if you are going outside the save area, you will do it either in
	convoy or become called a greenhorn.

> And the logistics of piracy are just horrific, particularily in a ruthless

	Anytime somebody starts to calculate "system defense" based on
	the stable empire (DGP sectors - 2nd survey) he will come up
	that its IMPOSIBLE to be a lucrative pirate. Fortunately canon
	Traveller settings are allways in a frontier situation, because
	it makes more fun to solve the troubles there, than to fight
	the "bureaucracy".

   This would explain certain aspects of human history, however there is
the problem of uniform.  Santa is quite human, and has human clothing in
the form of a red suit and cap trimmed in white fur, black boots and a
matching belt (someone who all of our actions good and bad naturally can
accessorize).  Then there are those elves...

   Perhaps he is actually a remanent left over from the TL 21+ RoM.  :-)

   And perhaps one year he forgot, which triggered the Rebellion!  The

   It\'s been my experience that bad Mexican food gives one the feeling
of lift as the gases in the digestive system expand, however, those
gases are not enough to provide propulsion power (they do however
represent a definate biochemical hazard).  As for the thermo-chemical
spice reaction, typically bad Mexican food is produced for "American
tastes" rendering it about as spicy (and flavorful) as mush.

   No, to create the kind of reaction I believe you are looking for, you
would need to go with Cajun cuisine, preferably directly from New
Orleans.  Thai or Indian food will do as a substitute, but it must be
prepared by native-born cooks and be supplemented with bean paste to
create sufficent gas content.

   This would be true if the reindeer were designed using the aircraft
design sequence, however, I feel that the gravitic vehicle design
sequence is more appropriate in this case.

Do the numbers.

You will need (a) power plant, (b) accomodations, (c) mechanical and
electronic maintainence shops, (d) fuel tankage and (e) life support
(including food).

I\'m interested in them - such a facility has civilian uses as well (put it
in an asteroid belt, and use it as the seed from which a colony will grow).

Yes, but such a ship will be comparable to your prey. It wont be a 4-6G
heavily armed ship optimised for mugging 2G lightly armed merchants. It
will be a 2G lightly armed merchant.

During the Golden Age of piracy in the Caribbean, crew were a much more
major factor in ship costs than they are in Traveller. Check Andrews\'
"Elizabethan Privateering" for a short discussion of the ecomonics of
piracy - British Naval Documents, Postumus\' "History of Prices in Holland"
and whatsisname\'s "American Treasure and the Price Revolution in Spain"
will let you get more accurate figures. Basically, for a 80 ton barque (a
"typical" privateer) provisions for the crew for a 6 month voyage were
about 20% of the total cost (including buying the actual boat).

Because of this, merchant ships tended to be grossly under-crewed, and
therefore vulnerable to boarding and such.

However, in Traveller, it is hardware that costs, and crew are cheap.

*sigh* the convoy escort goes at the back, and everyone keeps turrets etc

Truly cautious escort commanders have a person on each bridge, who gets out

Well, I\'d say that it\'s pretty damn good. Keeping a fighter in the air is
the equivalent of a cop car on patrol - it\'s *assumed* dammit.

I mean, what the heck do the IN and Planetary Defense Forces do when there
isnt a war on, fer chrissake ? Look at the British patrols in the Arabian
Sea between the wars - it is useful training for war.

Your last sentence is the key - if by simple and cheap precautions we can
make piracy an awful risk, then it isnt going to happen, just like piracy
(as opposed to seaborne muggings) doesnt happen here and now.

Ruie is in the Spinward Marches, just near the Zhodani border, isnt it ?

As you pointed out, this cuts both ways. If you get hurt, then you will
have a short and unprofitable career as a pirate.

The Target crew also have the problem of how can they trust you when you
say "Your money or your life". As Hans pointed out a while ago, whilst it
is in the interest of pirates in general to let captured crews live (avoids
bad publicity and all that), it is in the interest of every individual
pirate to kill on capture (no witnesses).

The pirate concerned, on the other hand, would be very, very, very dead. An
old saw about old pirates and bold pirates, and an acute lack of old, bold
pirates comes to mind.

OK. It\'s following in the next post. Has a nuke damper, 5 cm of superdense
on the hull, a 600 megajoule laser and costs less than 30 megacredits.

Training costs are amortised through the crew costs. We\'ll pay crew Cr 50
000 a year each (Cr4000 a month - damn good money).

Wear and tear goes under standard military 10% maintainence costs. If we
are assuming a type D starport, then we ship them via freighter to a type C
starport, and get the maintainence done there (assume a 3 parsec trip
costing Cr3000 per displacement ton each way).

What a fair proportion of cargo costs to allocate to anti-pirate work ? 28
credits per displacement ton of cargo that passes through the starport (2
Cr per cubic meter of cargo) ?

Next issue is the cross-subsidy of the small worlds by the big, wealthy
ones. It is in the interests of the big, wealthy worlds to help the small
worlds protect traffic against pirates, because the ships pirated will
probably be owned by commercial interests based on the big worlds.

I think it is well worth slinging 0.1% of your defense budget to each
small, vulnerable world within your economic sphere.

No, we send a launch from the starport, and are requesting a full report on
exactly what sort of Mayday it is (starport launches have emergency low
berths and trained medics and stuff) while the launch is getting there (we
presumably have an hour or so).

Timing that jump in is goanna be tricky, too. My understanding is precise
time in jumpspace is random.

What sort of mines are these, that dont show up on active sensors or LADAR
? And 100 diameters is *well* within sensor range of the big chunky sensors
at the starport, so I dare say we would have noticed the minelayer.

LADARs also have a 50 kkm range. Det lasers at TL12 fire 15 kkm. Mines just
aint goanna cut it. 

Oh yeah, and "Follow the escort\'s motions" is the route the route the
merchant ships get told. The captain gets to follow his own inititive.

Why ? All three escorts will just fill the pirate with holes from range,
and then put out an APB for a damaged ship. Assuming the combat starts at
300 000 km range or so, there is no way a SDB can catch it before it jumps,
even if the SDBs pull 4Gs to the pirate\'s 2.

If the ship is out of combat range, we leave it alone until the convoy has
jumped, and *then* we go fill it with holes.

Oh yeah, and you have the merchants, each with one baby (1m3) sandcaster or
one baby (250 MJ) laser shooting at you too, using fire control solutions
provide by the escorts (hey, I work in Famile Spofulam. 250 megajoules *is*
a baby weapon. If you propose putting anything under 600 megajoules on a
ship, they paint yellow spiders on your workstation).

Look Hal, have you looked at the Traveller sensor distances ? Do you know
how impossible it is to hide in deep space, under the sensors given ? In a
gas giant, yes. On a moon, sure. Behind a big asteroid, no problem. In deep
space ? No way.

Look at the detection ranges on the *fighters* in the last THUDDD
competition. The X-1108 Firefly (44 MCr) has a PEMS that goes out to 5
million kilometers. And thats the cheap design.

It would also be embarressing for the SBD to make it\'s active sensor roll,
and have the fighter get hit by a nice chunky laser while it is still and
can\'t evade.

Civilian lasers also wont penetrate escort hulls. At least not when I\'m
building the escorts.

Forcing concentration against concentration increases the minimum cost of
the pirate\'s operation. You are talking four ships and maybe a fighter,
plus a number of people on the inside. Lots of people, lots of risks, lots
of things to go wrong. It\'s an investment in the MCr150 range, at least.

We send out a launch, detecting both ships via the launch\'s LADAR.

We also wanna know how you managed to stay undetected, or what the target
was doing outside the jump limit. Barratry is much simpler ... have the
crew arrange a rendezvous with the "pirate" and then claim that they had no
choice, and had to surrender. They have their cut paid into a bank account,
and pick it up after the debriefing.

Making piracy work in Traveller without the support of a nearby government
just requires too many assumptions, and too much incompetance on the side
of the counter-pirate forces. It\'s your campaign, but the numbers for the
pirates just dont stack up.

Re : Four Fours SDB

Employees,

It has come to my attention that Famile Spofulam Yards has a very low
market share in the lucrative Insystem Defense Craft market.

Therefore, I have made a company-wide determination that our next insystem
craft will fit the following criteria at minimum.

     (1) Four centimeters of Superdense armour.
     (2) Four gees acceleration.
     (3) Armament of four hundred megajoules output at forty thousand
kilometers.
     (4) Fourty four megacredits maximum price.

I hope to here from you with preliminary design specs now or sooner.

Marketing, come up with a slogan.

Re : Five fours

Uncie,

We couldnt do the five fours.

We managed a seven point five, a four pont eight, a six, and a three
hunnerd and a twenty-two.

We\'re sowwwwwy that we wrecked Maaaaaaarketing\'s nice slogan.

It\'s a one hunnerd dton sphere, with ten centimeters of Supa-wupa-dense
armour. It masses eighteen hunnery tons. 

It has a thrustie-wustie plate that mushes it at one point eight meters per
second square-square-squared acceleration, and and and a Heplar engine with
fuel for two hunnerd and sixty minutes that goes at a maximum-waximum of
four point one two gees.
Booooth engines will mush mush mush everything at four point three gees.

The main gunnie-wunnie is a six hunnerd magajoule laser-waser that fits in
the nosie-wosie as a spiiiinal mount. The laaaser beam has enough
weeeet-bix to go two hunnerd twenny five thousand kilometer-wometers, and
enough juice juice juiiiiiice in the battery-watteries to power the
laser-waser to go zappity zap zap zap every ten seconds for an hour.

An an an it has a twenny thousand kilometer nukie-wukie damper-wamper, an
an an three sandcasters that chuck big big big clouds of sand - three point
three seven fiiiiive cubic meters of sandie-wandie per try. The threeeeee
projectors have ten big cans each, for a tooootal of thirty cans.

Weeeeeeee reckon that between the armour, the nukie damper and the sand
sand sand saaaaaaaand it should be pwetty well pwotected aginst most
anything short of a cruiser-wuser-bwuser.

It has Active an Passive sensors and a Laaaaadar, an two laser comms.

The whole thing is powered by lots of battery-watteries, and and and a five
hunnerd megawatt fusie-wusie plusssss power plant. Weeeeee dont like that
Mr Zhunatsu, but they were cheeeeeap an small an we had enough surface
areas for the radiator-wadiators.

The crew of six  is protected-wotected by a threeeeee gee compensator, so
they shouldnt be tooooo uncomfortable.

An uncie-wunkie, the whoooooole thing costs twenny five point one megacwedits.

Your loving cousein,

	Not neccessarily.  Given enough bioengineering to get properly

bioengineered catalyst secretion) I\'m sure that you could get quite a lot
of thrust of of the methane generated by digesting bad mexican food.

it says nothing about bad taste.  I think that the Bad Mexican Food Drive
has loads of potential.

rocket-propelled flying pigs.

	Hey.  I have an excuse.  I was busy.  not only did we have the
Montreal branch of my girlfriend\'s family over (14 people), but I also
nearly managed to burn my face off cooking the turkey.

	The bird was so darn large (24 lbs) that it filled most of the
disposable aluminum roasting pan we put it in...  This left little extra
room fordrippings in the pan, which developed an annoying tendency to
overflow and fall to the bottom of the stove, causing little flareups.

	So what I did is I took a basting syringe and a saucepan, and
started transferring drippings into the saucepan via syringe in order to
lower the dripping levels.  It was working very well, and then the syringe
bulb suddenly sprung a rather large leak.  Post-incident investigations
revealed a 1-cm long split in the rubber.  Basically, the result was that
vacuum was lost, causing a full load from the basting syringe to drain in a
graceful arc directly onto the oven element, whereupon it erupted into a
Hiroshima-esque fireball, making a loud "whump" noise.

	Of course, I was bent over with my face in the oven at the time.

	Human reflexes are an amazing thing.  Before I realized what was
happening, I was standing back up and reopening my eyes, with Suzanne
looking at me with a horrified expression.  As it happens, I think that the
fireball missed most of my face.  I didn\'t get so much as a single
first-degree burn, and my eyebrows are mostly intact; I only had the hair
on the front and temples kinda singed.  If I brush my hair forwards it
probably won\'t even show.

	Hope your Xmases were as exciting.

Working as I do in biomedical research admin, I know of a simple and
entertaining device to stop this threat in its tracks:  the mouse
liquefiers.  It\'s a sort of souped-up blender that reduces lab mice to,
well, soup, in a fraction of the time it used to take to do it by hand.
They cost a fortune, of course, but they\'re extremely impressive in action.

Beware, O white wiggly-nosed one... They are watching you still.

Now in regard to Santa\'s Sleigh, don\'t you think you have overlooked the
most obvious  solution?  Santa must have a gold watch integrated on his
H.G.T. (Holiday Gift Transport).  Gold watch technology is quite ancient. 
Dating back to the days of Ancient Terra, it simply compresses the
time-field around the HGT.  If the time field were compressed by just a
factor of 5.94142381238, Santa would be able to do a years worth of work in
just one night.  Increase that by only a factor of 10.37348118178 and he
would be able to access the estimated 32000 worlds populated by humans. 
All in just one night.  Everyone knows that Santa\'s watch is one of the 25
hour varieties (you know, if you follow midnight around the globe, you gain
an hour).

Of course, I have noticed more than one Santa around, perhaps, he uses
duplicates (clones?) to lighten his work load, so he can still have time
with Mrs. Claus (if you know what I mean).  Or maybe he just uses the magic
of the season.  You know a little fairy dust for the reign deer a little
dust for Santa, a little more dust for Santa. ;-)  (and people wonder why

Finding pirates is not that hard - go where the traffic is.  You know they
have to get very close to a planet, because the merchants are.  Every
target they might want to grab is almost certainly within 100d of an
inhabited world.  Further, if there are enough customers to justify the
shipment of cargo, then there are enough to justify defending the vessels
that take it.

For large worlds, they are well defended, such that convoys are not needed.
 If someone is looking for a cargo to West Bumfuck, and you know their
defenses suck, you are going to be more careful.  Trips like this are when
convoys become useful.

Let me hit one point again - 100d limits, combined with the cheap cost of
military vs. civilian ships makes it a virtual certainty that there will be
enough ships to defend against the problem.  A 100d sphere is not that
large, given traveller weapons, and there will be a lot of ships.  Larger
limits, such as 2AU, or vastly inferior sensors to the ones available
today, will help a lot, but classic Traveller background and pricing makes
it very, very difficult to do.

You are still within a few hours of the planet, which means that you are
taking a substantial risk.  I will hit this again in a moment.

On the other hand, the effort expended by both sides tends to go up in
accordance with the amount of money involved.  Just imagine what kind of
work would be done to identify an 80MCr asset.  This represent the yearly
output of some 8,000-40,000 people!

Yes, a good forger might be able to do something that would survive a week,
especially on a backwater, but I would not want to bet on it.  The cost of
someone doing so is pretty high.  Without considering piracy at all, I
suspect there is a lot of effort put in place to prevent skipping - a
reasonable return on an 80MCr investment would give you 2.4 MCr a year, or
the rough income of 240 people, so skipping is going to be a real, credible
threat.  The ship\'s papers checks to prevent that are also going to catch
many a pirate.

Put a dozen defensive ships in orbit on patrol, and you are pretty safe.

Unless they have a designated jump point, in which case they can patrol it,
then you would be a bit surprised if anyone was within combat range of a
leaving ship, once you leave planetary defense range.  As I said before,
space is big, and you know they are going to have to rendez-vous with you,
thus they need to be a lot closer than they would have to be to shoot at
you.  (NB - Napoleonic age of sail instincts are a little off here -
weapons range was not that much greater than boarding range, while
Traveller weapons ranges are vastly greater than boarding range, and take
significant time to travel.)

Sensors let you see a LONG way in Traveller, because present day ones are
pretty good.  Weapons have tremendous engagement ranges as well.  I try to
design for 8 LS myself, for planetary defenses, which means that you can
reach out and touch someone far beyond the moon, and a significant fraction
of the way to the jump point.  That would rule it out for most piracy
purposes.  Clearly, therefore, piracy will happen near, but not at, the
jump limit.

Further, the merchant knows that his ship is likely worth more than his
cargo, so he will not trust that you are going to let him live - he is the
sole witness to a theft of 80 million credits, after all.  Therefore, you
must have a way of disabling him despite his resistance.  A merchant who
trusted a pirate to just take his cargo is likely a dead fool.

Let\'s sum up.

Defenses likely exist on important planets.

You would need to intercept, which takes lots of time, and is pretty
noticeable.

You need to disable, which also takes time.  The crew is unlikely to turn
over the vessel to you, because they do not want to die.

Once you have done so, you need to take the ship.  I would make it
difficult to do in less than an hour or two, were I the designer, just to
prevent this kind of thing in civilized space, but that is not canonical.

As a result, you are talking a very fast operation to get the ship taken.
You may have an hour, but I would bet that you should plan on a ten minute
engagement or less, once you count the long travel time, during which
interception is likely coming.

Here again, I am not saying it couldn\'t be done, just that it is likely not
very cost effective.  A cargo unloader that can strip a larger merchant in
ten minutes would be worth some cash at a port, I suspect.  The ships
represent a lot of capital lying around as well.

And the home planet is going to be defenseless?  I feel that this is an
inappropriate threat, unless you are in a battleship, and if you have that,
then pirate is not the right term.  Admiral is a better one.  :)

Actually, I disagree with you both in the Traveller universe, though you
are both quite spot on for the real world.  The maritime histories I have
read indicate to me that acts of piracy are not committed where they can be
seen.  Pirates need safe harbors, and they need to capture the prey easily,
but more important than anything else, they need to act where they will not
be spotted.  You are in worlds of hurt if the Navy comes knocking while you
are pillaging.

In an ocean, you can be days away from anyone, and can be out of sight by
the time they look, because an ocean is big, and ships spend a lot of time
vulnerable - a one month trip leads to a one month piracy window.

Space is also big, but it is empty, and most ships are found within 100d of
a world.  The resulting area to be patrolled is essentially empty, and
fairly easy to patrol, as a result.  You can spot most anything lurking in
it.  Further, a two week trip is out of range of the planet\'s defenses and
not in jump space for a very brief time - hours in many cases.  This window
can be closed with a relatively small number of patrollers.  (I am leaving
the question open as to whether these patrollers would exist.  That is
worth reading the old threads for.)

Consider, if the Navy can see you, then they can probably kill you, and
thus you may only commit acts of piracy where they are not.  A previous
debate settled pretty convincingly that the naval budgets could buy a lot
of escorts, tenders, and combat craft.  ISTR that you could put a dozen
destroyers on every system by using roughly 1% of the naval budget of the
three high pop worlds in 36.  It did not insure that they would buy them,
but I think the small investment for the large return of low insurance
rates would justify it fairly well.  YMMV, and you should probably look
over the old debate before tracking down that thread.

This is a fun experiment.  Note the vast resources which could be poured
into defending a relatively small area?

Military ships in Traveller are very, very inexpensive, compared to TRW,
such that there is a large supply.  Merchant ships are expensive, compared
to TRW, thus they will be defended.  Given that the navy reserves some
weapons to itself, one can bet that they are not going to let many
nuke-armed ships out there.  Anything less is going to be cut to cat food
if they come against a Naval ship, and there are a lot of Naval ships out
there.

Further, the GDPs of even a small planet are just enormous.  100k people,
IIRC, can support an SDB pretty easily.

I would move the entire convoy to within support range while my outrider
checked it out.  I would want to insure that the potential enemy was under
my guns until I knew what was up.  After all, the escort commander is there
to guard the convoy, and will not want to increase risk unduly.  Given that
the whole convoy does not have to stop, merely cease accelerating while the
faster escort ship gives it a look see, it is likely that the whole convoy
can stay in range long enough for a preliminary look.

Err - this is going to be a bit difficult to arrange - unless you mean a
det laser, and thus pirates with naval grade weapons.  You have to be
really close to hit a mine, so this is a fair bit of planning.  You did
this after they filed the flight plan, right, and it is out near the 100d
limit.  Assume for the moment that they have Naval-grade weapons, and a
ship that went out.

That ship better have jumped, or the escort commander is going to be rather
suspicious about why it is still there.

This strikes me as inappropriate tactics.  I would rather get a hull paint
on the villain, and tell the local SDBs who they are.  Pursue for half an
hour or so, and then return.  Also, that assumes that their guns range you
when yours range them.  (I am willing to give that, because guns are pretty
cheap, and pirates know what they are up against.)

>  Kinda like

Any Navy commander who goes haring out of conflict range of a convoy he is
escorting is a fool, and should be cashiered.  Haring out of immediate
contact is fine.

So, we now have five pirate ships committed (the mine layer, the decoy, the
attacker who also controls the mines, and the two chaps in the convoy), at
least two of which are hauling Naval weaponry.

Pretty impressive firepower, and well within the capabilities of an enemy
government trying to capture a vital cargo.  Unlikely, imho, for an
individual, given that the reward for this is going to be a ship costing a
fifth or less of what the very, very expensive fleet cost.

I would use this scenario, by the way, but would play it as an enemy
action.  Should shake up the players a bit.

True, enough resources could make anything work.  My complaint with this
thread is that the T4 rules as written make it terribly cost inefficient,
thus people are not doing it for profit, and have to megarich.

Watch who is accelerating.  Anyone with drives on is ordered to strike the
drives.  Anyone who does not is a hostile, and might be fired upon.

If the drives are not working, then the ships will both be close enough to
engage, so flip a coin, send a shuttle towards one ship filled with
Marines, and give the Marines time to ascertain the situation.  If they get
ambushed, then the other is probably a victim.  If not, go after the other
one.

Note - your jammer will make you pretty easy to see, so the Navy will be
poring over the records both ships left on planet to try and make a better
guess than a coin toss.  Even though it might take them an hour to get to
you, they still can have investigators working on planet.

Yes, you can defeat that, but you are talking a lot of conspirators, and
this group of people might get higher returns are mercenaries and
terrorists than pirates.

As I said above, piracy may not be totally impossible, but the combination
of the jump rules, the ship costs, the resources, and the known physics and
unknown weapons, it is very, very difficult, and thus likely unprofitable,
without the support of a large governmental body buying your ships and
training your crew.

I must admit... I have a fair amount of real-world data on domestic
reindeer lying around here and there.  I probably could come up with FF&S
numbers for the fuzzy wittle fings.  You gotta love any animal that thinks
human urine is the ultimate delicacy.

You realize, of course, that the Sayat (lacking pliable carnivores on their
homeworld) have bred special strains of attack reindeer... sort of like a
cross between Bambi and a Rottweiler.  Even the Solomani will be impressed!

The Imperial Battleship Coronation (Royal Class, tail number BB-216), is an
example of the Imperium\'s greatest naval asset.  This 90kton vessel, 345
meters in length, is the most visible symbol of the "iron fist" of the
Imperial Navy.

The Coronation is built around a 100,000-Mj Meson Weapon.  Capable of
destroying many vessels with a single barrage, the SM-173 system gives the
class a devastating primary battery in combat.  The weapon\'s effective
range of 340,000km is sufficient to engage many enemies before they can
enter their own effective weapons envelope.

Nine smaller (3500-Mj) Meson weapons are mounted in 100-ton bays.  These
weapons, firing in groups of three, allow the ship to engage several
targets with devastating fire.

To support the primary mounts, numerous secondary weapons arrays are
deployed.  Twenty missile bays can launch an impressive volley of 120
standard nuclear det-laser weapons, and keep this rate of fire up for many
hours.  Deadfall/Ground support ordinance can also be carried.

A wide variety of laser weapons are mounted.  One hundred 190-Mj turrets
optimized for close defense and anti-missile duties.  Fifty heavy laser
bays, organized into batteries of five weapons, provide a mid-range
offensive punch.  Lastly, 270 standard 95-Mj laser turrets add flexibility
against targets that might not require military levels of power.  All these
weapons are equipped with fire direction equipment for maximum accuracy
across their theoretical range.

For the Coronation\'s defense, first look to the 12.5cm superdense hull.
Thick enough to stop most beam weapons from penetrating, the hull is rated
for stresses far beyond what the ship\'s engines could produce as an extra
measure of safety.  The ship has a powerful suite of primary and back up
meson screens and nuclear dampers.  Finally, the fifty standard sandcaster
mounts add an additional level of protection should the Captain feel it
necessary.

An important part of a ship\'s defense is making it hard to hit, and for
such a large target, the Coronation does an impressive job of hiding.  With
a Military Black hull coating, IR suppression, and a full suite of jammers,
the class has a surprising low signature across the EM spectrum.

The ship is driven through normal space by a powerful thruster unit.
Sufficient force is generated to allow a constant acceleration of 1.1G.
Interstellar travel is achieved using a top of the line jump drive, giving
a three parsec range.  The vessel is powered by a standard fusion plant
producing just over 145,000 Megawatts.

Care has been taken with the ship\'s sensors.  Two separate 50mkm PEMS
suites have been installed, both operating as primary sets.  AEMS has a
most effective range of .16mkm.  A LIDAR system, distinct from the target
locking systems found on the weapon mounts, is used for specific target
interrogation.

The Coronation carries ten 95 ton shuttlecraft.  These are berthed two to a
bay.  The shuttles are used for most interface, since the ship is not
equipped for planetary landings.  Five hundred liferafts are set in
jettison bays.  Little more than a set of emergency low berths, a radio set
to broadcast a help message, and a HEPLaR engine designed to kick the raft
clear of the disabled ship and then leave it falling alongside for easy
location, the liferafts are considered important to crew morale.

The 395 officers and 2443 enlisted personnel aboard the Coronation live in
cramped but comfortable quarters.  Double occupancy is the rules for
ratings and junior officers, with only senior Petty Officers and O-3s and
up getting private rooms.  The Captain has a three room suite located
directly above the bridge; the ladder leading from the bridge to the
Captain\'s quarters is commonly referred to as the "Stairway to Heaven."
The crew has the use of several gymnasiums onboard, as well as numerous
entertainment programs in the ship\'s computer.  The Navy stresses
continuing education, so informal classes on any variety of subjects might
be held at any time.

The crew eats in either one of the ten large mess halls, or for the
officers, one of the five slightly better appointed wardrooms.  No matter
where you dine, the food is still Imperial Navy.. good, filling, and not
likely to win awards.

The 450 Marines onboard form a reinforced company under the command of a
Force Lieutenant (0-3).  The Marines provide shipboard security, act as
shore police, and are equipped to make combat drops from the Coronation\'s
ten drop rooms.

The Coronation was laid down in 34 at the Shallner Orbital Shipyard at
Sylea.  She left the yard in 38, and passed trials and was commissioned in
40.  Considered a "series III Royal," she contains many upgrades from the
earlier Royal class Battleships, most notably in electronics.  The
Coronation has a small Flag Bridge and accomodations for an Admiral and his
staff.

Royal class ships are named for the trappings of a monarchy.  Names of the
class include Throne, Crown, Scepter, Orb, Ascension, Monarch, Consort
(referred to in the fleet as "the Royal Bitch" due to a storied history of
troubles), and various historic and legendary monarchs.

Royal BBs are usually deployed in pairs, with extensive escorts and support
vessels.  A typical squadron might have the Coronation (BB-216) teamed with
the Palace (BB-189) at the center of a battlegroup along with 2-3 cruisers,
several destroyers and frigates, possibly a carrier, and a dedicated
intelligence ship.  Royal BatRons are always accompanied by several fleet
couriers.  Royal groups are the preferred escort for large Army convoys.


DESIGN NOTES

I admit it.  I have a thing for long, flared cylinders.  They just make
sense when your main mission is carrying a large spinal mount at TL12.

By redoing the design, I ended up with less than 1000m^3 of waste space.
Every nook and cranny on this puppy is packed.  I figured staterooms on one
small for each command crew, with everybody else sharing double
accommodations.

A few lessons.  Particle accelerators are not efficient.  Compared to the
meson weapons, they are power hungry and short ranged.  A good combo of
lasers and mesons makes the ship pretty hard to beat.

Careful shaving in some areas can save you immensely in others.  By cutting
the armor from the original 400 to 250, my drive efficiency went up, ,
allowing me to shrink the drives, save space on crew, and shrink the power
plant.

The ship costs 78 Billion credits (thousand million to our Brit friends).
These are not considered expendable by any reach.  Much like the Aircraft
Carriers early in the Pacific war, their combat potential might be reigned
in by the concerns of an officer who doesn\'t want to face the Board of
Inquiry on the loss of the Navy\'s most powerful ship.

Enjoy!

Went home for the holidays and dug up my old Gamma World
book, Top Secret rules, and Basic + Expert D&D Rules...
this stuff is like 15 years old...

Anyway, the introductory adventure to the D&D Expert rules
is the "Island of Dread", where the adventurers stumble
upon an account by "Rory Barbarosa" the swashbuckler, about
the hidden treasures and dangers stashed on a remote chain
of islands.

A low-tech adventure, this would be an interesting break
from the laser battles, as the adventurers (having had
their weapons and armor confiscated, left at the starport
due to law, or through loss of weaponry due to crash,
misunderstanding, robbery, etc) find themselves crewing
a large sailing ship into the unknown on a world which is
blowing its cities to bits.  Our heroes\' goal: to find a
lost spaceport in the hinterlands, out far away from
civilization, which just might have a ship they can cobble
back together, to get them off the planet.

This game could be played out over weeks, months, or even
years, altering the circumstances of world disaster to give
as much time as needed.  They could form a small pirate fleet,
raiding villages and/or uniting them under one flag (aka
The Postman), and finally exploring a wild island with mean
beasties to find passage back into space.

So, ja like it?  Eh?

I have it. Basically, the PC group gets convicted of a crime and sent to
Newcomb, a prison world. The adventure deals with the relationships
between the PCs and the other prisoners, the discovery of a few
mysteries, and, ultimately, the escape attempt. The adventure uses weeks
as the time frame, because things take a long time in prison.

I haven\'t run my group in it yet, but the minute they get convicted of
something, I\'ll be hauling it out. If anyone has run it and has any
tips, I\'d be interested in hearing about them!

It is truly heinous that the RPT was left out of both QSDS *and* FFS2.
However, your base assumption above is wrong.  A red-nosed reindeer is
simply an electronics-enhanced version of a standard reindeer, much like
the "wild weasel" variants of the F-111 and other fighter aircraft.  The
"red nose" is really a LVWTAS (Long-Visible-Wavelength Terrain Avoidance
System) which gives the RNR (red-nosed reindeer) its vaunted all-weather
capability.  As a side benefit, the RNR offers extensive ECM and
stealthing, handy to avoid being blown to vapor (or triggering an
unpleasant Christmas Eve exchange of ICBMs) when penetrating the DEW line
at low altitude and Mach 15.

Now, my brain doesn\'t always work as well as I\'d like, but I beg to differ.  I
could have sworn that Mr. Miller stated that the product has been delayed
because he doesn\'t want to release it until its ready?  I\'d rather have a late
product that was done right then an on-time product that was rushed to get to
the latest convention myself...

  I don\'t know what NZ or Canada are like on these two holiday weeks,
but asking an office-based (as opposed to a store-based) company to
do ANYTHING important on the weeks containing Christmas and New Years
is nearly futile. Same for most government offices in the US. For most
of the people you want to talk to, this coming Friday (Jan 2, 1998)
might not even be a work day. This Thursday certainly won\'t be.

 To Imperium Games I can only say one thing. In the computer retail
chain I work for we have a phrase that moves mountains at HQ. "Customer
Service Issue."  Among the members of this list IG has several Customer
Service Issues brewing and worsening as we speak. Do something about
them, and do it fast and without doubletalk. Learn how to avoid
further Customer Service Issues in the process, and IG will be a far
better company for the experience.

I agree; looks count. But content counts also and the two are not mutually
exclusive. Heavy Gear does do a good job; the art is consistent, relevant,
and pretty. Every character, gear, and spaceship is illustrated and the
illustrations actually match the descriptions given in the text.

>I\'d rather have useable stuff than art in my RPG-books!

I\'d rather have usable art than unusable text in my books. Non-technical
books in general, and games in particular, have this annoying tendency of
using graphics as some kind of \'filler\' for blank pages. This is endemic in
T4, with one exception. FF&S is especially bad; it introduces all kinds of
new objects like passive arrays, sockets, hardpoints, grapples, weapon
mounts, beam pointers, and on and on and on, all *without a single picture*
of any one of these things! My players are always asking me for what things
look like, and most rules give me no help in this regard. I have also never
seen a Traveller deck plan that is of any use in visualizing the appearance
of a ship.

The one exception I mentioned is Emperor\'s Arsenal. Every weapon in this
book is illustrated right beside its description, usually depicted in
normal operation with a person or vehicle nearby for scale. EA is the
best-designed Traveller book I have ever seen.

I have noticed that the Star Wars RPG has a high proportion of useful
illustrations. Perhaps this is because the game is based on a visual medium
and has lots of high-quality source material to draw on.

>That\'s actually one of the reasons i like gurps, because these text-
>wastelands are usually filled to the brim with useable gaming
>material. There is no "filler", just content. The pics aren\'t that
>important, the content is!

There is no direct text=useful, art=useless correlation. There are plenty
of RPG rules I have never used and consider a waste of printing. Proper
illustrations will improve a GM\'s understanding and players\' enjoyment
unmeasurably. Unfortunately, we don\'t get "proper illustrations", we get
irrelevant filler, and the game suffers for it. I have seen Traveller
campaigns where fire teams exchange ranged combat inside staterooms, drive
vehicles through starship corridors, carry bridge workstations around, and
hip-fire autocannons, all because the GM and players have no idea what
these things look like.

Look at a typical medical or engineering textbook; they are filled with
illustrations. In these cases the pics *are* the content, not some way of
padding the page count. As long as people keep thinking pictures aren\'t
important, we are going to keep getting useless illustrations.

........... Scientific Research  ....

Here are some guidelines for introducing scientific research and other
complex projects in your Traveller games. I lifted many ideas, concepts
and mechanics from the relevant portion of the Ringworld RPG ((C) 1984
Chaosium Inc.)

For convenience any complex task should be subdivided in a sequence of
smaller tasks which must be completed by the partecipants. The actual
subdivision should be decided by the Referee, but some input from the
players could be helpful.

The referee should prepare a list of the steps required to complete a
given project, noting how long they will take, the step type (see
below), task difficulty and any equipment required (if any).
Time to complete the task is described as an amount of hours dedicated
to the task. This is elapsed time, and will not vary with adding more
people to it (except through exceptional success, or during lab research
see below).
People who take part in the project must work on it for periods of no
less than 2 and no more then 10 hours in a given 24 hours period.
The time for each step will be secretly generated and recorded by the
referee. The referee may roll again and give the result to the players
as an extimate time for the task.

For each step in the project, the Referee will briefly describe what the
step requires and will ask a task roll for every character taking part
in the project.
If at least one of the partecipants obtains a success, the task is
successful and the step ends after the time originally defined.
If no one succeeds, the next step will not begin. The current step may
be repeated (the Referee will roll again to determine how long it will
take the next time).
If one or more of the partecipants roll a special success, the time
required is shortened by 10% or (at referee\'s discretion) the
difficulty, cost or other parameters of the following step(s) are reduced.
If one or more of the partecipants roll a special failure, the step is
invalidated and must be repeated (optionally with a different degree of
difficulty), time or cost is doubled, or the difficulty of the next step
is increased.
This way, is generally a bad idea to use a lot of poorly skilled
assistants, because you risk to obtain disastrous results (remember that
anyone taking part rolls, and *all* the effects are cumulative: your
chief researcher may roll a special success and reduce time to complete
the step and *then* a goofy assistant may invalidate the process by
rolling a special failure).

Different types of research.

Theoretical Research.
This represent the creation of new theories, formulation of laws or
corollaries, or the application of techniques and knowledge from another
branch of science.
Time to complete a step: 3d6 x 20 hours.
Prerequisite: none. A computer may reduce the time by 1d3 x 10%.
Task difficulty: Difficult to Impossible. For this kind of research
apply the rules for Uncertain Tasks.

Field Research.
Collection of first hand data on a given subject. This may vary from
interviewing subjects for sociological data to collecting samples from
soil or simple observation and recording of natural phenomenons.
If at all possible this kind of research should be played out in full,
allowing for chance encounters, low-key equipment failures and other
interesting scenes.
Time to complete a step: Depends on the type of data to collect. Varies
from 3d6 x 20 hours for simpler data collection or full time observation
up to 3d6 x 60 hours for biological or sociological sampling.
Prerequisites: minimal data collecting tools suitable for the task (i.e.
anything from pen and paper to cameras and/or probes or samplers). Access to
a computer may help organizing, indexing and classifying the results
and will result in a time reduction of 1d2 x 10%.
Task Difficulty: From Easy to Difficult.

Laboratory Research.
Either controlled experiments to prove a theory or extensive analysis of
some subject.
Time to complete a step: Varies a lot with the kind of experiments
involved. Routine analysis of a soil sample, for example, should require
no more then 1d6 hours, while cloning experiments could require 1d6
months while the clone develops. In less extreme cases use 3d6 x 20
hours as a general guideline.
Labs may be "used" for 20 hours in any 24 hours period (the rest of the
time is taken by general maintenance of the equipment), so more then a
group of people may work in shifts on the same problem.
Prerequisites: An appropriate lab for the experiments.
Task Difficulty: From Easy to Impossible.

Library Research.
Extraction of already existing knowledge from the body of works on a
given subject. In an extensively computerized environment time to find
relevant texts may be quite short, but you still need to read the
stuff which you consider vital for the task at hand.
Time to complete a step: With computer indexed stuff, 3d6 x 10 hours.
Libraries without electronical indexing systems will require double the
time.
Prerequisites: Access to an appropriate library; either a physical place
or an electronic reference for the problem at hand.
Task Difficulty: From Easy to Difficult.



Laboratories.
Labs cost 200000 cr plus 100000 cr per project that can be performed
over the first one, plus 50000 cr per researcher over the first one.
Each lab may be used for tasks requiring a skill from the Sciences or
Technical clusters. Any additional skill requires an additional cost of
20000 cr.
Example: Regina Janus wants to equip a new lab for Archeology and
Geology research. The lab will be able to host three independent batches
of experiments, each conducted by a different scientist. Cost:
200000(base) + 200000(two extra experiments) + 100000(2 extra
researchers) + 20000 (for the Geological tests). Final result: 520000.


Sample research project.

In the _Mercy Mission_ adventure (White Dwarf issue ...), a team of
scientists must discover the cause for an odd disease which has recently
struck a village of TL-2 primitives on a Red Zone planet.
Here is an example on how to organize the research according to the
guidelines given before.

(1) Field Research
General aerial recognition of the village and surrounding area.
Time: 4 hours. Roleplay it and require Average Air Raft and Sensor rolls from
the PCs.
(2) Field Research
Sampling of soil and biomass in areas distant from the village.
Time 3d6 x 2 hours. Average, Biology.
(3) Field Research
Sampling near the village. To be conducted at night, without the
primitives permission. Roleplay it.
(4) Lab Research.
Integration and extensive analysis of the samples.
Difficult. 3d6x6 hours. Biology and Chemistry.
(5) Theoretical Research.
Formulation of a theory about the disease. Impossible Medical or Biology
roll.

In the meantime another group of scientists can study the primitives in

I posted a message a few weeks ago regarding dealing with munchkin players
and a healthy thread enused. Thanks again to all who replied. The whole
discusssion was very helpful and really helped to get the juices flowing. I
now have the beginings of a campaign well under way. It is entitled
"Brothers behind the Claw" and is about a secret society operating within
the Psi Insts. The society is very militant and is based, in part, around
the idea of the Fascist Groups of the earlier part of this centuary. It\'s
okay people, they\'re the bad guys. The society is a shallow hierarchy made
up of "Eyes", "Seers", "High Seers" and a "Grand Seer". The "Eyes" are the
field agents, "Seers" are their commanders, "High Seers" are regional
organisers, while the "Grand Seer" is a Duke. There is also the functional
arm made up of seven "Lights".

The society has infiltrated the Imperial government within the Spinward
Marches. This all happens just before The Assassination and that event will
take place as a background. Archduke Norris will be a big player within the
campaign but will not actually communicate with the player party as he will
be rather busy dealing with the rebellion and the machinations of this
secret society (who naturally with take advantage of the chaos).

Early on the players come across a list of names that an agent (a Seer) has
hidden away. This is a hit list. The party have to warn, protect, rescue
etc. the members of this list. What I need now is useful names and
occupations for this list.

I\'m thinking military high-ups who think there\'s something going on but
don\'t know what; the demoted ploiceman who knows whats going on but can\'t
prove anything, the football player whose college buddy mentioned something
before dropping out, etc.

The format of the NPC data would be the standard UPP plus a little note
about what drives the guy/gal/git and where they would fit into the plot.

I\'m sure that there are many of the TMLers with large collections of NPC\'s
or even players who would be likely candidates.

Thanks in advance

The trouble with this is that using *any* power (including normal human
metabolism) means that you have to radiate extra heat. A natural body
is radiating exactly as much energy as it is receiving. But you are
producing *extra* energy, and it has to be radiated as well. 

The smaller your surface area, the bigger the problem. At 1 AU, natural
bodies are radiating (IIRC) 1kW/m^2. So to stay within 10% of this
you\'d have to have 10,000 m^2 of surface for every megawatt of power
generated. To stay within 1% (more likely for "stealth") you\'d need
100,000. And you\'d need 1 m^2 to 10 m^2 per crew member for the heat
*they* produce.

That sort of thing adds up *rapidly*.

There was a guy aboard a British battleship at the turn of the century who
died of eating Christmas pudding. Apparently he grabbed a bit as that
particular mess lined up for the Captain\'s inspection. With nothing else
for it, he swallowed his prize (which was still in the brandy & flames
stage) just as Mr Captain entered the mess. The unfortunate rating died of
burns to his innards a day or two later.

of mine needed a sort of paste made of mouse brains for an experiment one
time (I dunno why). He tells me that the \'spanner and yank\' method was too
slow for that preparation - the brains had to be very fresh. Apparently if
you swing the mouse by the tail and smack it in a hard bench, that\'s about
as quick as you can get for bulk mouse-murder. (A colleague then does the

I have a few extended system charts randomly generated using Metator (Rob
Prior\'s Fabulous Macintosh App found at Joe Heck\'s site;
http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/archive/software/ look for
"Metator").  If you have a Mac, get his program and I\'ll send you the data
files I have.  If not, I\'ll send you (and any other requestors) the output
in html of the system data only (which is the only thing that "exports"
successfully) via private email as an attachment, if you send a request to
the address below.  I have files for Nasemin, Junidy, Fenetmen, Rugbird,
and Aramanx.  I will be generating others as needed in the future.

If you are Java 3.0 capable you may want to contact Jo Grant via this list
for the program he is working on (still?) to do many of the same things,
plus allow intersystem navigation in the same app.

This is a good idea, but I don\'t think one can simply scale up the stats
proportionally. Because of the dreaded square-cube rule, larger grapples
will need to be exponentially larger than small grapples. The same is true
of starship hulls, or any load-bearing structure for that matter. This
seems to be handled in hull construction by the Structure Factor in the
Hull table from FF&S. Perhaps increasing the grapple stats by the structure
factor of the hull it is to grapple would work.

Agreed, there is a lot of high-quality anime-style art out there. However,
I do not think this would be a good style for Traveller to use. Anime is a
separate science fiction genre with its own technology and storylines. A
steriotypical anime storyline would include features like teenaged
motorcyclists and rock singers inside gigantic anthopomorphic robots
attacking fleets of variable-geometry alien spaceships at visual ranges
with guitar riffs and building-sized handguns, who respond with swarms of
zig-zagging contact-detonation missiles. An interesting genre, to be sure,
but not Traveller.

Moreover, there are already real anime-style RPGs on the market with this
kind of art and background. Frankly I think the games appeal to a different
market.

Actually, at best I\'m only an armchair reindeerologist.

Naturally.  And pointers and retrievers and all that, too.  The most
disturbing ones are those that were bred to chase rats into burrows.  No
antlers on those, of course.

Hm... I might actually try to write this up.

That\'s probably a non-US phenomenon; I don\'t recall Foss artwork being
a significant presence on SF covers here in the USA at the time.  There are
a lot of SF illustrators that, to me, have "Traveller" style, but Foss
isn\'t one of them.  Personally, if I\'d had to pick one artist and use his
off-the-shelf images to illustrate Traveller stuff, I would have called
Frank Kelly Freas first (and the art would be a lot more interesting to look 
at, too!).

My second choice would have been Michael Whelan, and Chris Foss would have
been somewhere underneath Darrel Sweet on my preference list.  I\'ve been
known to avoid buying books simply because they have Darrel Sweet covers.
On the flipside, I own several books that I\'ve purchased just because I
liked the Freas painting on the cover (and to date, I haven\'t been 
dissapointed with the stuff inside a Freas-illustrated book, either).

I suspect a font conversion problem as well, but I don\'t know how IG managed
to do it.  At the start of writing for FF&S, we gave IG a "test" Word
document 
with the equations produced in the Microsoft Equation Editor.  IG reported
"no 
problems" converting this file for printing, so we delivered the final
document in the same format (we used the "test" document as a Word template 
and wrote the rest of the book using it).

I don\'t know if this means they didn\'t actually do the test the first time,
or they managed to mess something up that worked properly the first time.

As an aside, FF&S was written with the tables and equations integrated
with the text, so that it would be possible to proceed through the design
sequences without having to flip pages.  Putting them all at the end of the
book was done in the final copy, at the request of IG ("to make it easier
to use"), by making two copies of the document, and deleting all the text
out of one, and deleting all the equations and tables out of the other.

I -- _we_ -- expect nothing less from the progenitor of Famille Spofulam.

There\'s a Mongolian dish... well, food construct, let\'s call it... called
"boodog", a sort of haggis.  It used to be boiled or thrown in the fire to
cook; nowadays, people just use blowtorches.  This is another example of
how and why we Solomani are going to kick Vilani butt in the next century.
We\'re not afraid of food OR technology.

Why not start out as an asteroid?  Asteroid hulls are nothing new (c.f.:

Why not use a contraption like the Spacesuit Option, Heat Absorber (SCS p
14)?  If such a device were scaled up and if we were to include Scale
Efficiency (FF&S + see the note below) we would have the ability to absorb
some serious Mw/turn of heat by pumping it into blocks of ice.  Adding
additional ice capacity would increase the time spans at each level of
reduced detectability, but not increase the amount of heat/turn that could
be absorbed.  The following table was made assuming that the unit described
in SCS was as small as they could be made.

Absorber Systems	
Cumet	Heat/turn
/Mass	Absorbed		Cost
000.005	00000.20 Mw	           3,000 cr.
000.050	00002.42 Mw	         30,000 cr.
000.500	00026.62 Mw	       300,000 cr.
005.000	00292.82 Mw	    3,000,000 cr.
050.000	03221.02 Mw	  30,000,000 cr.
500.000	35431.22 Mw	300,000,000 cr.

Hmmm, I wonder what the Pirates could make of a thing like this?  Let\'s say
you took a Mercenary Cruiser for example.  T4 p 102 has that as an 800 Td
unsreamlined vessel with a Power Plant Rating of 3.  That means it has a
power output of 4800 Mw.  The only unstreamlined 800 Td hull in the book
has a surface area of 2096 square meters, so it would absorb 2096 / 4 x 1
kW = .524 Mw of heat from sun light (assuming a perfect black body and that
Shadow\'s figures are correct).  And finally our proposed Pirate Cruiser has
a crew of up to 70 so that\'s another 70 x .005 Mw = .35 Mw.  That brings us
to a grand total of 4800.874 Mw of energy.  This will require 4800.874 /
3221.02 x 50 = 74.52412589801 cumet of volume.  If we round that up to
74.525, we will be able to hide the heat signatures of an additional 11.262
crew or prisoners, and everyone knows what prisoners can be worth!  Can
anyone say ransom? ;-)
 
The cost to mount such a cloaking device would be 30 x 74.525 / 50 = 
44.715 Mcr. a mere  15.67% of the original cost of the vessel.  OTOH
consider that while running passive sensors, this installation would make
your ship virtually invisible.  Even running at full blast.  And best of
all, you won\'t have to "uncloak" to fire your weapons.

  Speaking of Gamma World, has anyone here looked at (or even
SEEN) the Amazing Engine version, "Metamorphosis Alpha to Omega"?
I never saw this new, and only stumbled across a used one this
week. Something about a ship 20km long gets my attention :)

  Unlike most of the previous editions of TSRs "mutants" game,
this one is formatted to be as complete as possible in one volume
(given the nature of the Amazine Engine line), so it actually has
a fair amount of material on running campaings in the setting. It
also provides enough information for playing the Warden\'s endgame.

    'body' => 'Yes, that\'s four different subjects.  I\'m trying to do several
things at once; why shouldn\'t my email?

(1) Freelance Traveller redesign assistance.

I\'ve temporarily halted work on the posted Freelance Traveller; I
decided that it needs a new look, and possibly a new structure.
The problem I\'m having is that I can\'t decide exactly what I
want; therefore, I\'m looking for ideas from a bunch of very
creative and imaginative folks.  Stop looking around and behind
you; I\'m talking about _you_.  Many of you have visited FT; what
I\'d like now is for some serious constructive criticism - how can
I make the site better?  Please note that I have placed the
following technical restrictions on what I\'m willing to
incorporate:

(a) I\'d like to get away from the black background.  The problem
with black backgrounds is that it takes light text to be readable
- - and if someone decides to print the page to a color inkjet (the
most common type of printer in home use at present), it\'s going
to look disgusting at best, unreadable at worst.

(b) Much as I like some of the most recent technical innovations,
such as style sheets and DHTML, I can\'t in good conscience do
things that depend on them.  I tend to like to make pages that
can be viewed by as wide a range of browsers as possible; but
even if I limit myself to Netscape and Internet Explorer, there
are enough old versions of each to make it impractical to assume
that they all support the latest technologies.  I\'m willing to
limit my "market" to NS and IE, but that would have to be NS3 and
IE3 as acceptable minima, not 4.  That doesn\'t rule CSS or DHTML
out entirely; it just says that I expect to have the page look
acceptable in the older browsers, even if I use the newer
capabilities (which they will ignore).

(c) I would prefer to avoid being heavy on graphics or embedded
files, including Java applets.  My ISP\'s home page is
chock-a-block with graphics and animations and Java applets; the
damn thing takes an unconscionably long time to load over a 28.8
connection.  The whole world ain\'t on 56K or better, yet.  Again,
that doesn\'t mean that I\'m unwilling to use them, just that I
don\'t want to go overboard.  Glitz for the sake of glitz is sort
of against my religion.  Glitz that either increases the
informational content or increases the _professionalism_ of the
look is OK.

=46inally, I want to design a New Look - a new logo, banners,
navigation bars, and so on. I\'m at a loss, though.  If I can get
one that I like, I\'ll do it up as a Frontpage98 Theme and make it
available for download.  That ties in with my Team Traveller
topic, below.  C\'mon folks, share your ideas!

(2) FAQ update

I\'m mostly rewriting what used to be the Imperium Games FAQ, but
which on Freelance Traveller will be called the Traveller FAQ.
It\'s being expanded to cover FAQs on _all_ Traveller, not just
IG, hence the name change.  I have some questions that I need
answered; I\'d appreciate it if someone could answer these for me.

(a) Who/What is BITS?
(b) Who/What is CORE?
(c) What can you tell me about GURPS:Traveller?
(d) What other companies currently have Traveller licenses, and
what have they published?
(e) Who owns the rights to old Traveller material published by
[insert company other than GDW - DGP, FASA, and Seeker come
immediately to mind]?
(f) What Traveller-related mailing lists are out there, and how
do I join? (I have full info for TML and TravLang; I need the
rest.)
(g) At one point, there were people who acted as official
net-reps for IG, to whom questions would be directed, and from
whom answers would come.  Does this function still exist?  If so,
who are those people, and what part of the job is their
responsibility?
(h) How far in advance are the moderated IRC discussions
scheduled, and how far in advance do we know the topic?

(3) Traveller Promotion Ideas?

In spite of Many Things That We Need Not Name, Traveller is a
good system.  Other than simple word-of-mouth, how can we, the
dedicated core of Traveller enthusiasts, promote Traveller.  I\'m
not suggesting that we go out and buy advertising (though if
someone wants to do that, I\'m sure that there won\'t be many
objections), but I am thinking of "deliberate efforts", i.e.,
promotion of Traveller is our goal, and not just a side effect of
our enthusiasm.  This also ties in with "Team Traveller?", below.

(4) Team Traveller?

There\'s something nagging at the back of my skull that says that
this has been done already, but...

Proponents of many IBM products, such as OS/2 and PL/I, are
organized into "Teams", which act in coordinated manner to spread
the gospel, and to provide assistance to others, with respect to
their "team product".  Microsoft has something similar in their
MVP (Most Valued Professional) designation.  Is there something
similar that we can join or organize for the purpose of Traveller
support and promotion?  Can we increase the identification by
having our Traveller web pages have a consistent look-and-feel?
Should we?  Your thoughts are invited.

<snip>

It\'s the difference between "art" and "illustration" that\'s really at issue
here.  I don\'t want to start a long winded debate on "What is art?", but
IMO, there is a major difference between artistic graphics and illustrative
graphics.  The same sort of difference you\'ll find between technical and
creative writers.

Art is meant to *evoke* feelings and set a mood for the viewer.  An
artistic image might, or might not, look like the object it is supposed to
represent.  It might just be the artist\'s impression, or perception of the
object\'s "essence" and not look at all like the actual object. 

Illustration, OTOH, has the goal of making things clear.  Illustrations
should be clear, simple, and completely representative.  They should show
as much of the object\'s form and function as possible.  Simple pen and ink
images are good for this.  So are cut-aways and perspective views. 
Impressionism, expressionism, surrealism have NO place here.

Art on a cover and occasionally inside an RPG is very useful to evoke a
mood.  However, most inside graphics should be mostly *illustrative* in
nature.

And we are probably talking about two completely different people doing the
work here too.  ;->

Ok, ok, there can be accurate illustrations that evoke a mood, but that\'s
*much* harder to pull off..and why really good graphics artists are worth
their weight in gold.  For Traveller, better to keep the art and the
illustration separate...IMO.

Yes!  You want, and they need illustrations!  Clear visual images of
exactly what the device looks like and how it is used.  Pictures that show
scale in relation to human sized figures.  If IG had put that kind of
graphics in the books we wouldn\'t be having this discussion.

Am I making sense here?

Retorical questions..

Will we also need GURPS Space, Martial Arts, Ultra Tech I & II, and
Vehicles? Not to mention Copendium I and II!

Oh yes, will we all be switching to cubic yards, pounds and miles now?


You know, I *almost* like GURPS.  If it wasn\'t for it\'s point based *only*
chargen, overdependence on two attributes (IQ and DX), Minimaxer-prone
advantages and disadvantages, and lack of a *real* Task System I could
really get behind it.

So, oh great TML, how can GURPS be fixed?  Can we create a Traveller style
method of Chargen for GURPS?  Can we find a way to add a couple of
attributes (EDU and SOC at least!;-)?  Can we figure out how to tack an
"honest to god" Task System onto GURPS old-fashion Success System?  [The
Advantage/Disadvantage problem is something I figure I can handle on the GM
level. ;->]

Inquiring minds want to know!

Give me a simple plain white or gray background with no patterns or fancy

BTW, something almost nobody does, but I wish they would is to make the

Java applets and graphics have their place, an important one, but there\'s

Then it\'s not glitz, it\'s information.

It shouldn\'t be to hard to cobble together.  Remember you\'ve got two
different classes of Cylons.  Four are basically drones, whereas two are
more intelligent.    Some semi-decent armor, bigger and stronger than
humans, and Laser rifles.

The ship\'s though are rougher, they\'re non-jump capable I\'d say, but
Battlestar Galactica was always pretty vague about the ship specs, and
distances traveled.

I see a common mistake taking shape here, the problem is in that Dutch and
German are as similar as English and Dutch.  Originally, this name was
Donder.  Donder and Blitzen are paired components in the original.  Donder
and Donner both mean Thunder in their respective original languages.  You
can see how this bit of confusion can slip in.  It seems obvious to me that
Santa\'s HGT (Holiday Gift Transport) would not need (or have) ECM, but, a
sonic boom suppression system would be quite advantages.  After all you
don\'t want to wake the little tikes or their parents on Christmas Eve.

BTW, I note that Donner is duplicated in the listing above.  Anyone out
there know the name of the 8th Reindeer?

Why not use a contraption like the Spacesuit Option, Heat Absorber (SCS p
14)?  If such a device were scaled up and if we were to include Scale
Efficiency (FF&S + see the note below) we would have the ability to absorb
some serious Mw/turn of heat by pumping it into blocks of ice.  Adding
additional ice capacity would increase the time spans at each level of
reduced detectability, but not increase the amount of heat/turn that could
be absorbed.
<pins>

Just some free association on the idea....

ON ICE...
Why not just use L-Hyd inside the ship? I\'ve always envisioned the tanks to
be like on big thermos bottle (beware of the pressure). Or store unrefined
L-Hyd (water) in the tanks and supercool the water to form ice. Just need to
watch out for the ice expanding once it is frozen. And what if you need that
fuel quickly? You\'ll need to liquify it quickly. Hmmm, mayhap some sort of
frozen slurry?

ON STEALTH...
I\'ve understood stealth to be a property of a vehicle not reflecting active
sensors (ladar/radar) back to the sensor, done with special paints and
oblique surfaces to do the trick (correct me if and where I am lacking in
this understanding). How can you detect something if no signal is returning?
So sensors get refined & better with higher tech levels, but so does
stealth.
Understandably there still is the problem of IR signature.
Could this be lensed in a certain direction? Gravitically?
Or why couldn\'t heat be captured and reused as energy at a certain tech
level?

Run games in stores and at conventions.

Say nothing but good things about *all* versions in public (if you can\'t
say something good keep quiet), and take IG to the woodshed *in*private*
about their quality control.

Write secondary market publishers, asking when their Traveller suppliments
will be coming out.

Pray to your six sided dice that Marc will get T4.1 right, IG won\'t screw
it up in editing and the printers don\'t screw it up when it gets to them.

Team OS/2 and their famous pink shirts!

No, not that I\'ve heard of, but it\'s a good idea.  Can we have Black shirts
with Imperial Sunbursts?

Could, probably shouldn\'t. Individualism is important and good. 

OTOH, I think if you have a Traveller web page you should be on the
Traveller Web Ring, and you should promote the ring.  That\'s a *very*
useful linking mechanism that.  

I think the idea that <somebody> had of an index of who has what Traveller
stuff and where it is on the web was a good idea.  

And why are so few Traveller pages listed on Yahoo?  Is it because we have
to fill out a form and *we* don\'t?

British <mumble> Traveller <mumble>  

>(b) Who/What is CORE?

The folks that are behind most of the good Traveller suppliments. Oh, you

(and ?Suz?) Dollar, Joe Walsh and maybe one or two more folks who\'s names
have slipped my mind...like that\'s not hard to do. ;->

>(c) What can you tell me about GURPS:Traveller?

Out RSN. Loren is writing it. It\'s set in an Imperium where Dulinor wakes
up from a night of overindulgence to find Cleon stepping out of the shower
says, "Sire, what a *dream* I had last night!"   No, not really, but I
still think it would be a major hoot if Loran wrote it that way. ;->  And
from what I read on the GURPS list, it\'ll be a lot more GURPS than
Traveller.

>(d) What other companies currently have Traveller licenses, and what have

Don\'t know, and damn little!  Gold Rush Game *had* a licence and talked

    'body' => 'In light of the lack of manners from one specific member of the
"anti-piracy" camp, this will be my last post on the topic.
Unfortunately, I have better things to do with my time than to have
someone treat me with the attitude of "HOW CAN YOU BE SO DENSE".  Pity, I
thought the purpose of the mailing list was to enjoy it...

  In any case:

1) Criminals believe they won\'t get caught.  Unfortunately, there are a
few that don\'t get caught, as well as the fact that some crimes take a
while to catch up to the perps...  This is ultimately, a reason why piracy
would exist - the belief that "I/we won\'t get caught".

2) as with any defensive position having to wait for someone to launch an
attack, the enemy (pirates in this case) will pounce when the circumstance
for mounting a successful chance of piracy will include the factors that
make a successful defense difficult.  Factors involved with launching a
rapid response team to the area of difficulty include:

  A) planetary based ships need time to gather their crew, and launch.
Prelaunch checks need to be carried out prior to the launch.  Ordance must
be loaded, or if loaded, must be upgraded from stand down status to alert
status.

  B) orbital forces positioned in space, if on patrol status will be able
to respond, but only upon recieving the mayday, and will need to
accellerate from a relative zero velocity towards the victim.  On a size 7
world, it would take 1.1 hours for a 4g patrol ship to reach a ship that
is 90 diameters away...   ample enough time for a pirate to do his deed
and get underway.

  C) ships that are in space on patrol are likely to be pointing the wrong
direction, with a vector that needs to be modified.  Even if by distance
the naval ship is only 30 minutes away, it won\'t help if it needs 20
minutes to turn around and get underway towards the ship being pirated.

  Having said all this, there are countermeasures one can employ versus
sensors.  The common most is powering down and going balistic.  During
submarine warfare, all that needed to happen was for a torpedo to be
launched based on the prediction of the target\'s speed and heading not
changing in the time the torp was underway.  Likewise, a powered down
intercept could work out rather well in this respect.
  Another counter measure would be the use of Jammers.  A ship inside the
Jammer\'s umbrella, could make a course change while underway, and then
power down - and exiting the umbrella.  Chances of spotting a ship while
inside a powerful jammer\'s area of effect are a bit on the low side
(realistically speaking).  One simple concept that would work, is the use
of a small throwaway jammer, a jammer on the pirate ship, and time enough
to use both.  A simple freighter intercepted 90 Planetary diameters away,
is attacked and under jamming.  Merchant crew surrenders and is put on
lifeboats (or just left to drift in vacc suits with a radio transmitter!)
price crew then takes over, and changes course and accellerates at max
speed.  Prior to exiting the strongest part of the area being jammed, they
powerdown.  Pirate ship then takes off at full speed while jamming.  They
head towards a prepositioned throwaway jammer, and activate it upon
entering it.  They in turn change course and powerdown.  The defense
system now has three tasks: pick up the survivors, find the missing
freighter, and find the missing pirate ship.  If the pirates really wanted
to be nasty, they take the merchant crew on board, and then prior to
course change, they launch the crew in vacc suits.  They tell the
planetary patrol what they have done, and broadcast it in the loud so the
public can hear of it.  If the navy doesn\'t make some effort to rescue the
merchant crew, what will the outcry be?

  As stated, this is my last response on this issue.  Differences of
opinion are healthy on the list.  Bad manners is not.  The rest of this
list has my condolances that you have such people on this list who need
better training on how to interact in polite society...

   Respectfully yours,

I\'ll put my .02Cr in with Eris - you go!

Go for a #FFFFFF white background. That\'s probably the biggest mistake I
made in my pages, and I\'ve yet to go through and re-org them to a
different format. WHITE makes the pages look crisp and readable - like a
good paper publication, and FT especially is going for display of 
content (over style).

Pick a minimalistic look - the graphic at the header &/or footer - to
give the site a good "look & feel". Otherwise, pitch the graphics for the
masses. When it comes to a publication like FT, content is king.

That goes on to Eris\' point - new articles. I know exactly how hard it is
to get articles, but canvas for them. Ask specific people to write
specific things for FT.

Now I\'ll go into what I\'d like FT to be - it may not fit with what you\'re
looking for... I\'d like to see an online publication, updated on a
regular basis (every two months? monthly? quarterly?) with some good
articles and adventures. House rules are interesting, but I\'m usually not
interested. I\'m very interested in other people\'s adventures. It\'d also
be nice to see a regular column or two - maybe a column from the
GreaHeads with some new rules/designs, and a column or article
periodically from some of the writers around here (CORE folks?).
Interviews are always interesting reading, and there\'s a number of folks
around here to interview...

Finally - get a faster server or better access for FT to the Internet. 
The lag times coming out of FT are horrendous!

> (4) Team Traveller?

Team Traveller kinds of ideas are exactly what the game system needs to
increase people\'s awareness of it as a playable RPG, not just something
from \'77. The real benefit there is going to be hitting the Con\'s and
running games - increasing awareness completely _outside_ of the
Internet. The net folks who are doing traveller now have pretty much
already found the Traveller sites, and probably the TML. The continued
growth of Traveller requires folks doing the street-hitting routine.

IMHO - your milage may vary.

Why not!, GURPS has Robots, Psionics, Martial Arts, and many other very
useful books that Traveller will never see the light of publishing. 

The entire basic system is seamless unlike the current and prior editions
of Traveller. It has only one design system, with useful additions unlike
the 4 plus that T4 currently has.

I prefer a point based character generation system than the current T4 one.
As to the overdependence on two attributes  and Min/Maxing those are GM
issues not system issues. The current T4 does not have a *real* task system
either.

Unlike Traveller, GURPS does not need fixing, just errata for revision.

As you\'ve noticed, GURPS is fairly philosophically opposed to this.  Of
course, there\'s nothing to stop you from rolling a random career and then
designing a GURPS character to fit that history.  Or are you asking for a
completely random generation process all through?  (You could do such: the
outlines for a random sequence are already in the Basic Set, and you\'d
just need to add the career tables, etc., converted from CT or descendant).

> Can we find a way to add a couple of attributes (EDU and SOC at least!;-)?

GURPS treats these and many other details as "meta-attributes" -- you can
buy advantages or disadvantages to handle variances.  Social Standing is
fairly well-handled (IMHO) by the existing Status system (you can range
from -4 (serf or slave) to 8 (emperor-scale), which is as near in
resolution to the hexadecimal 0-15 range as makes little difference to me,
and allows for non-noble corporate status as well as grants of title. 
Education is largely subsumed into skills (Area Knowledge, the wider list
of available skills, and some "general knowledge" factored into the IQ
stat), but there are a few disads (Incompetence, etc.) to better simulate
the low end of the scale.  A specific "education" advantage would probably
be widely viewed as "un-GURPS-like."

> Can we figure out how to tack an "honest to god" Task System onto GURPS
> old-fashion Success System?

To vary difficulty, I usually just assess an on-the-fly skill penalty --
"There\'s not a lot left of the carvings.  Roll Archaeology minus 6 to
interpret them."  (I\'m fairly sure the Basic Set specifically suggests
this.)  And, again, if you want varied degrees of success (beyond the
existing Critical vs. Normal Success/Failure), just pay attention to how
much the roll was made by and adjust your descriptions as referee
accordingly.  For all its apparent complexity, GURPS relies a great deal,
I find, on a free-wheeling and story-telling GM. 

> Eris,
>     who really likes GURPS...really! ;->

Glad you think so.  :-)  GURPS _is_ open to min-maxing, as any detailed
system is (cf income tax, government procurement, or computer programming).
The books, SJG itself, and most of the experienced lot on the GURPS-Net
mailing list all repeatedly point out that with freedom comes responsibility:
the referee does have to make sure that the characters created match the
sort of game she and the players want to have, and be willing to ask for
justifications or revisions when PC\'s don\'t measure up.

One area which I\'m looking forward to in GURPS:Traveller is the ability to
describe aliens using GURPS racial templates, allowing more player
flexibility with better play balance.  I\'m happy to have seen my GURPS:
Traveller site mentioned several times in recent weeks here on TML, but
haven\'t heard any feedback on the racial packages I wrote up for the
species from Aliens Archive.  They _do_ point out some holes in GURPS
(Hresh extra arms are definitely in the realm of diminishing returns, and
shouldn\'t be so costly!), but I think are interesting overall.  I have a
few more to add, and hope to do so soon.

This might be a Retorical question, but I can\'t let it pass.  What makes
you _THINK_ that you will need these?  Personally I suspect GURPS Space
won\'t be that compatible, and I don\'t see why you would need Martial Arts,
or the Compendiums.  Vehicles might be a nice to have, I don\'t know, I\'m
still trying to get a copy.  Ultra Tech, and a few others I can think of
are nice to haves, but again not needed.

Basically there is NO reason to believe that you will HAVE to have anything
BUT the basic GURPS book, and GURPS Traveller.  That is the beauty of the
GURPS system, you can enhance it with other books, but all you need is the
Basic book.

Take a look at GURPS Lensman for example, it\'s a Space setting, but it
doen\'t need or even want GURPS Space.  It tosses the Space Ship
construction and combat from GURPS Space OUT THE WINDOW, and does things
it\'s own way.

As for EDU and SOC, do you really need atributes for this, isn\'t this in
reality an advantage or disadvantage?  OK, actually I guess it\'s a combo of
Attribute/Advantage/Disadvantage.

One thing I\'m really hoping for is that they keep our Tech Levels as the
GURPS Tech Levels seem a bit odd when talking about Traveller.

I\'d too would like to see the Metric system continued, but unfortunatly I
suspect it will end up with yards, pounds, etc.  This is one thing, that
isn\'t _really that important_ in the great scheme of things for Traveller,
but could really mess up even the Basic GURPS rules.

Face it, GURPS Traveller IS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD!  Give it a chance, it
might end up saving Traveller.  Let\'s be serious, T4 is keeping it on life
support, that\'s about it, and they\'ve not paid the electric bill so to
speak, so that life support is shaky at best!  I personally think the only
reason Imperium Games is still around is because a few crazy people such as
myself buy everything they put out, hoping it will get better, but knowing
that it probably won\'t.

With GURPS Traveller you have a setting that at least some of us think
should have been.  A setting that allows the basic materials to be used for
a Classic, Mega, or TNE game with basically no work and very little extra
needed.  Can T4 make that claim?  I think not!

  Right off, always make sure that there are no cameras in sight
before beating a fellow prisoner to death with a mining implement.
You also may need separate weapon stats for picks and shovels, to

I believe I read somewhere that when GDW folded the rights to ALL materials
developed for the system reverted to the originator of the concept (Marc
Miller).  I can\'t find a reference for that, but if you have CSC you will
note in the introduction (p. 4) that Greg Porter said he had been collating

Hello,
  Are you aware of any realistic chances of either re-releases of the old
Grenadier figures (or "old" RAFM figs) or a new Traveller miniatures line?
I\'m always looking for more, but was a bit disheartened to have to tell a
fellow customer at a recent sale to try the "Shadowrun" line for people
and GZG\'s products for resin vehicles.

  It may not be the biggest deal for T4 players, but for newer CT/MT players
the lack of aliens (particularly the canon Major Races) must be a nuisance.
AFAIK, there are only two different castings for most of them, Aslan being
the only non-human exception. I have a bit of a beef with this :)

  Given the overpricing of many lines, it could easily work out that the
old human Adventurers or Imperial Marines boxed sets could make good profits,
allowing for updating the retail to close to current levels.

  BTW, Denizen has some good Zhodani combat armour troop look a likes, although
the cat #\'s escape me.

        Yours truly,
                Steven Hudson

Me too!  (Sorry I just couldn\'t resist.)  One of the things that I have

From someone involved in the GURPS conversions, I learned that they will go
with the English system.  They think that it is very Travelleresque
(although how they came to this conclusion I\'ll never know).  The metric
system is much more intuitive, but I guess they feel that consistency with
other GURPS material is more important.  Maybe they are right! 
Inconsistency is the hobgoblin that has ruined more good RPG\'s than
anything else.

So is Gurps Traveller going to be based on the historical novel of the
same name about (and written from the first person perspective of)
Robert E Lee\'s horse of the same name ?

It is $24.95 for the 256 page Gurps Third Edition Revised [ie version
3.1] pb, and well worth it IMHO.  You may be thinking of the now long OP
Gurps Third Ed Hardcover which was $29.95.

Fair warning - I am a Gurps junkie.  I own 120+ Gurps products.  I boil
them (duplicate copies only of course) down.  I then take the resulting
fluid, out it in a hypodermic needle, and inject it directly into my
bloodstr

Oh, sorry I meant to use the other meaning of Gurps junkie.  I don\'t
thnk that the secret masters have cleared most of you to know about this
method.  I will refer any cognoscenti here to Gurps Fantasy II pg
100-102 [OP].

(Not to be confused with the forthcoming (when you know where freezes
over) GURPS Junkie which will be based on the works of William S
Burroughs and will be written by Hunter S Thompson :)

Need no, want yes.  A true GURPS Traveller referee will also need Gurps
Illuminati to reflect the truth about the illuminated Third Imperium,
its Templar inhabitants, and their secret master Cthul, er Grandfather.

Gurps Aliens, High Tech, Psionics, and Robots are also good.

Other items that might of some use include Gurps Bestiary, Religion,
Horror, Lensmen [for a starkly astonishing 3rd Imperium], The Prisoner
[OP], Space Bestiary [OP], Special Ops [OP], Supers 2nd Ed,
Swashbucklers 2nd Ed, Terradyne [OP], Uplift [OP] and a dozen or so more
: )

Some GURPS products have used non English systems in the past (although

The chart below is an approximate conversion between GURPS Soc and
Traveller Soc.  Note however that low Soc charecters in Traveller
may/will have Odious Personal Habbits, Social Stigmas, Bad Reputations,
etc in additon to or instead of a simple lowered Social level.

Advantages & disadvantages are one of my favorite parts of Gurps
charecter generation & are something I have always wanted to see in
Traveller.

So what is the difference between someone who "really likes

"likes GURPS...really" ?

Is this like the old Tom Lehrer line about the man who, while in
college, "Majored in Animal Husbandry, until they caught him at it." ?

I see the Gurps Traveller release as just a bacvkground release. Sure 
there will be new rules, to fit Gurps to Trav, but face it... those 
are only for those people who need a new rules system to go with the 
background. Those of us, who already use one or the other form of 
Traveller (be it CT, MT, TNE, T4, AD&T, etc...) will continue to use 
these rules. I will use my mishmash rules as before, unless Gurps 
Trav offers some neat new alternatives that fit my style of play 
better. Those new books, to me, will be a mine, where i can dig out 
background material!

   Ooops!  you\'re right.  I thought I got the list right--must have been a
little too much holiday cheer...

   Here\'s my list.  Unless otherwise noted, listed reindeer primarily
provides basic propulsion:

   Dasher - Controls basic maneuver.  Secretly in love with Vixen, but knows
that she would spurn him.  Troubled by the inclusion of Rudolph, since he
used to handle the navigation chores.  Was moody, angst-ridden, and listened
to too much Nirvana.  Prozac mixed into his feed by Santa has done him wonders.

   Dancer - Controls evasive maneuvers.  A bit nervous since that incident
over the Marne back in \'16.  Santa keeps a tight reign on him.

   Prancer - likes to dress up in female reindeer garb, other reindeer don\'t
like to talk about him too much.  Serves in-flight beverages.

   Vixen - Only female in crew.  Hired under affirmative action mandate.
Pulls own weight, loans reindeer clothes to Prancer on occasion.

   Comet - Cleanest of all the reindeer.  Bells always shined, hooves
trimmed, fur brushed.  Always early to work.  Handles commo when not pulling
sleigh.  Accused by other reindeer of sucking up too much to Santa.

   Cupid - When he\'s not playing "reindeer games" with the wives of some of
the other reindeer, pulls sleigh and check computer reads outs for Santa.
Once caught browsing the Penthouse Web site.

   Donner (or Donder) - Changed name after war to avoid prosecution on war
crimes charges.  Follows orders well.

   Blitzen - Responsible for ECM/ECCM.  Santa does not travel armed (which
makes Dancer even more nervous).  Once jinxed a Soviet missile back into the
launching aircraft.

   Rudolph - Handles navigation.  Won million dollar anti-discrimination
suit against Santa, Inc. back in \'47.  Hired by Santa as part of settlement.

Loren Wiseman is (now) a SJ Games employee and will be the product line
manager for GURPS Traveller (this implies that there will be a Traveller
product line from SJ Games, rather than just a single sourcebook).  He is
writing the first book of that product line.

The setting will be an official variant, set in the "Classic" Traveller era
(post-Fifth Frontier War, or somewhere around 1120) in which the rebellion
never happened (that is, Archduke Dulinor never assasinated Emperor Strephon
and his family*).  

* Old-timers may remember that our long-gone TML Historian, Mike Metlay,
  wanted to write this supplement and call it _We Have Always Been As We
  Are_, after the famous quotation from Queen Victoria.

Eris seems to have gotten his characters mixed up a little by the way: 
that\'d be Strephon stepping out of the shower.

I believe that DGP has folded or been sold, and the copyrights are now owned
by someone else.  FASA still exists, and would own the copyrights to their
material (or the rights may have reverted to the authors, the Keith
brothers).  I believe Seeker, Judges\' Guild, and Paranoia Press no longer
exist as such.

At one point, yes.  I was responsible for answering technical questions
(eg: how does a jump drive work and why can\'t a ship smaller than 1400 cubic
meters jump), under the direction of Joe.

Not that I\'m aware of.  Joe opted out of the program, and while I was
willing to continue to answer technical questions, I didn\'t have the time to
run the entire program.  I believe IG terminated the program at that point,
for lack of someone to run it.

I am willing to (try) to answer technical questions, subject to availability
of my time (remember, I\'m doing this on a volunteer basis).  Many other
folks on the TML will happily do the same for most polite questions.

reality.  The Russian Topaz reactor is quite small due to the use of direct
conversion using thermionic diodes.

4.    Photoelectric systems don\'t make any sense.  The Area column appears
to represent the radiator requirement, but how much collection (or surface
area) does the system take up per MW?  If it turns out that the Area column
represents the collection area per MW then a 1MW array would measure 3m long

Probably not, but there may be at least one equipment book for GT (this is
speculation, I know nothing for sure on this.) However, those books you
listed are all great reference works, and have info usable in other
settings as well.

There exists in Basic Set 3rd Edition, Revised a metric conversion table.
By the way, a displacement ton works out to 18 cubic yards

"Minmaxing" is not a problem in my GURPS games, because I have learned the
power of the magic word "NO!". It\'s amazing how well it works...

No game system is perfect, and a lot of this comes down to a matter of
taste.

Education is purely a function of how many skill points the character has
and what level certain skills are at. if he has an 18 in Biochem, then he
probably has a Master\'s in it. SOC is an Advantage called "Status". The
Emperor would be about Status 7 or 8, I believe.

This is SOLELY my opinion, but I absolutely hate random generation of
characters. I wouldn\'t mind seeing a background generation aide similar to
Fuzion\'s lifepath, that tells what the character did in his careers, and
maybe some important events, but I really think GURPS Traveller characters
should be built according to the player\'s wishes (with LOTS of GM input and
use of the Magic Word where appropriate). That\'s how we did it in the GURPS
Traveller (way unofficial Net version) that I ran, and everyone involved
loved their characters and had a great time. GURPS is not Traveller,
systemwise at least and it does not need to be. YMMV.

   And then there is more serious anime as well, some of which I could
easily see as being part of Traveller.  I was commenting on the *look* of
anime at any rate, not so much the "sterotypical storylines" that are pretty
much oriented at the under 21 crowd.  As far as the technology is concerned,
original, Traveller-oriented anime could easly be brought into line with
accepted canon (in whatever version of the game you use).

   From what I\'ve heard, none of them are very good (either they have
mechanical or plot flaws or both).  There is certainly some crossover
potential there if someone is willing to explore it.

I don\'t particularly like giant robots, either - so I avoid anime that
features them (I\'m currently watching Neon Genesis Evangelion _despite_ the
giant robot mecha, rather than because of them).

On the other hand, there is some anime that I think has "travelleresque"
elements.  Take a look at:

Mighty Space Miners
My Youth in Arcadia
Be Forever Yamato
Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind
Laputa: Castle in the Sky 
Super Atragon
Wings of Honnemaise 
Crusher Joe
Lensman
Starship Troopers (*)

* There was a Starship Troopers OVA (Original Video Animation) a number
  of years ago that is a _LOT_ closer to what Heinlien wrote than the
  recent US live-action flick.  The same cannot be said for _Lensman_,
  which could best be described as loosely inspired by Doc Smiths\' work.

Some of this stuff (Nausicaa, Laputa, Starship Troopers) is hard to impossible
to find in the US, and isn\'t available subtitled or dubbed.  Most of the rest
can be had relatively easily.

You\'re players are into Dirty Pair and the other \'battle bikini babes with
bug guns\' stuff, aren\'t they?

> And besides, I find it a bit...\'teen\', don\'t you?

That all depends on what anime you\'re watching.  Personally, I prefer some
of the \'classics\' of the genre, rather than the stuff that these kids who
think they\'ve discovered anime are pushing today (My Youth in Arcadia and
the Yamato stuff is definitely \'classic\' at this point).  Much anime
(including three of the titles I listed above) features teen protagonists,
however not all does.

I think this issue can neatly be circumvented by not publishing reviews, 
but publishing links to other traveller fan sites and/or review pages.

Maybe Freelance can put up a reviews section . . .  ;-)

IMHO the best layout is (very) minimal text and lotsa tables in a 
suitably intuitive order for the actual design sequence. Gloss text and 
tech explainations are in a separate chapter.

To me, the ideal design rulebook would have the following outline:

1. Tech summary and explanation chapter
2. Design sequence "checklist"
3. Design tables, in sequence order, with a brief explanation of table 
entries below each.
4. Design "evaluation" chapter.
5. Design examples

I guess my ideal design incorporates both points of view! ;-) The tables 
are kept separate from the "gloss" (how fusion works, what a jumpdrive 
is, etc.), but a short summary is included so that the designer can 
recall if the tonnage is per weapon, per volume, or whatever...

I thought Brilliant Lances\' Technical Booklet was pretty good (except for 
the Hull section, where critical calculations were buried in plain 
english in a long paragraph -- a short mathematical formula would have 
been better).

Saw a copy of it on my FLGS\' "buy it before we give it to Doug" shelf a few
months back.  sad, really.  They took one of the silliest games in history
and tried to make something coherent out of it.

Leafing through it did lead directly to our "Paranoia in Spaaaaccceeeee"

Not hardly.

I\'ve submitted my page to Yahoo *at least* two dozen times, but I never get
a response. It appears that they just ignore submissions unless they are
for the higher traffic areas.

Eris makes perfect sense here and in my opinion has summed up the

give a good sense of form and function, as well as the scale.  I really 
appreciate them.  More of this would be a big help.  Then, those item\'s 
illustrations can be included in "artwork" for the mood setting.

I don\'t have CSC, so I can\'t comment in detail on these heat absorbers,
but if they\'re what you imply (dumping heat into ice) they seem *way*
too effective (unless the "turn" is a 5-second combat turn, I suppose.)
5 tonnes of ice certainly won\'t absorb 300 megawatts for very long -
only a few seconds. 

FFS2 IR masking (and advanced and extreme masking) implicitly includes
a little bit of this sort of thing (big heat sinks) combined with
refrigeration in the hull and carefull arrangement of radiators; the
goal is to cool down almost all of the hull and radiate the waste heat
away in a narrow cone (at moderately unreasonable temperatures.) 
This, plus the Definitve Sensor Rules, are pretty realistic and give 
a good estimate of how far away you can hide. There was even some DSR
errata about pretending to be an asteroid...For almost all traveller
ships, as Shadow points out, internally generated heat completely
dominates over absorbed sunlight, to the point where absorbed
sunlight is neglected in the current draft of FFS2. (If you want to
include it, add 0.01 MW * surface area to all ship\'s generated power
for calculating signatures.) (It\'s 0.01 instead of 0.001 because
normal power plants are assumed (optimistically) to only lose 10% of
their power as waste heat.)

Why not!, GURPS has Robots, Psionics, Martial Arts, and many other very
useful books that Traveller will never see the light of publishing. 

The entire basic system is seamless unlike the current and prior editions
of Traveller. It has only one design system, with useful additions unlike
the 4 plus that T4 currently has.

But my spreadsheet can easily convert metric to English and back again.

I prefer a point based character generation system than the current T4 one.
As to the overdependence on two attributes  and Min/Maxing those are GM
issues not system issues. The current T4 does not have a *real* task system
either.

Unlike Traveller, GURPS does not need fixing, just errata for revision.

I agree. I try to observe this maxim as much as possible. Though the front
page of my web site includes a starry background, 31k logo and small
graphical buttons in a lefthand frame, I try to use white backgrounds as
much as possible. They look crisp and professional unlike the default gray
backgrounds that make it look like the author was just lazy.

The white pages also make your site look like a Traveller book. Place small
illustrations where necessary *or* make larger illustrations accessible via
a link rather than forcefeeding visitors your images. That way, if they\'re
interested, they can click the link to get the illustration by itself. If
not, they don\'t have to wait umpteen minutes while their 28.8 modem chugs
along trying to eke out the illo. I use this method with the Starport area
of my site. I have several fairly large starship illustrations and deck
plans accessible only via link.

All Joseph\'s ideas are excellent. Especially the regular publication
schedule. However, getting submissions is difficult, I\'m sure. The problem
is that your audience is web literate and most of them either have their
own web pages or they\'re planning on making one. Therefore, the chances of
them submitting their material to your site might not be good.

Perhaps you should contact IG and ask if they\'ll send you all the unused
JTAS submissions. I\'ll bet if you pumped some of them through an HTML
converter, you might get some great stuff.

I absolutely agree.  However, there is a countervailing effect, that
light-text-on-dark-background sometimes hits just the right \'mood\' (check
out print ads if you doubt this).  I faced this dilemma on my THUDDD site,
and finally decided to make the \'front\' page (used mostly for statement of
purpose and navigation) light-on-dark, while all the (extremely)
content-heavy competition pages are dark-on-light.  I sacrificed a unified
"look and feel" for the site, but in the end I decided it was the right
approach.

The one remaining big hunk o\' text on the front page is the rules...and
I\'m planning on moving them onto a separate dark-on-light page of their
own in the near future.

Of course, the beauty of style sheets is that browsers that don\'t know
about them ignore them -- so you should seldom need to take backward
compatibility into account.  The price, of course, is that your pages end
up looking *very* bland to SS-unaware browsers, as most of the "prettying
up" stuff is in the SS.

At the very least...

(a) Don\'t use *any* Java just for "gimmick value," and
(b) Put any useful Java apps on their own page with a descriptive link
    leading to them ("Beware of Java!").  That way those of us on slow
    links or with machines that routinely choke on unfamiliar Java can
    avoid the apps.

Amen, brother.  As a rough guide, 100 K is the absolute outside edge of
what a total page size should be, and that\'s *if* you\'ve given image
dimensions so all the text can render first.  50 K is a better routine
ceiling.

True on information content, false on \'professionalism\'.  A certain amount
of purely decorative material (logos, fancy separator bars, etc.) can add
to the user experience without conveying \'information\' per se (beyond a
McLuhanesque \'I am a spiffy site\'. :)).

I depends a bit.  I wrote my GURPS Traveller article with
just Basic and a little out of Space (which I could have
skipped).  One can play with just the article and Basic.
OTOH, Space, Vehicles, and UltraTech are handly if
you like supplements.

>You know, I *almost* like GURPS.  If it wasn\'t for it\'s point based *only*

Well, you could always have the PCs roll, off the top of
my head, 8+d6 for each stat.  Then you could assign
each skill and advantage to one or more services and
have the players roll (again off the top of my head)
for an attribute increase, advantage, or raising
a few skills a couple of levels.  (Or maybe have
them roll until they gain, say, 10 points in a
chosen catagory per term).

>Can we find a way to add a couple of
>attributes (EDU and SOC at least!;-)?

You can add whatever you want.  Telling people how they can
use systems went out with EGG.  Note: Status (the equivalent
of SOC) does exist in GURPS, it just exists as an advantage.
(you start at Status 0 and buy up or down).  You can easily
add an Education advantage (I did in my GURPS Traveller article)

It was based on the fact that CT did use miles some (hence the
planet size codes being what they were) and the fact that it
used such non-metric volume units as tons of displaced hydrogen.

Well, they\'re both bright red, after all. But one shouldn\'t leap to the
wrong conclusions: Santa\'s definitely no communist.  Look at all those elfs
in the offshore sweatshops he owns.  Hell, he\'s one of the leading
union-busting patriarchal petty-bourgeoise pigs, bloated with the
expropriated wealth of the working classes!

Not at all comparable with the Sayat children\'s fable about packs of little
flying prairie squid with glowing red eyes who, during the the darkest,
coldest night of the year, creep out to mischievously redistribute Junior
Miss Sniper Rifles (tm) and molecular biology textbooks more equally among
the children of Marhach.  That the kids leave out offerings of reindeer
milk and cigarettes is a pure coincidence.

    'body' => 'Hello Marc,
  First off, I would like to apologize for not responding sooner.  Part of
it had to do with the fact I was stricken with a flu like bug that lodged
in my intestines - causing some blood loss (Hemhorroids) that scared my
healthcare organization (subsequently scaring me!) plus a full month with
diareahh.  Consequently, I have not been "thinking" about programming much.
 Right now, I feel ashamed that I didn\'t respond to your cheerful
willingness to help with a thank you sooner than this, so, if it is not too
late to redeem myself in your eyes, I can at least rectifiy my ommision of
manners and let you know that I was taught better than that <grin>.
  In any case, I wish to mention as well, that I am very much looking
forward to GURPS TRAVELLER, and hope that it permits people to enjoy the
best of both your world system plus the background of the Imperium, along
with the GURPS world system.  I spoke with a gentleman on the list
privately, regarding the matter of the dice and half dice system, and was
told that you intended to clean up the "statistics" aspect of the dice with
regards to T4 (now to become T4.1), and I hope very much that you enjoy the
process.  If I have been overly critical in the past of the traveller
mechanism, it is with the understanding that what makes me happy doesn\'t
mean it is "universal" in that it should be how things are <god, I hope I
am not that arrogant!>.

  Ok, off the top of my head, I have the formula that Luminosity is
directly a function of comparison to the SOL\'s energy output.  If I recall
correctly, I have the formula (100^.2)^(4.85-absolute magnitude of target
star) with 4.85 being the absolute magnitude of the Sol.  Stellar Mass is
(if I recall correctly, since I am not sure where I put my notes, and right
now, the only set I know for sure is at work!) something to the effect of
luminosity^1/3.5.

  What I was hoping to do, is generate a variable eccentricity value for
planets in my random generation program, and then use the formula in WORLD
TAMERS HANDBOOK for calculating the temperature variances on a given planet
based on it\'s distance from the primary.  This would include the night time
temperature variances along with latitude variances as per the rules in
that book.

  Hmmm, what else can I recall off the top of my head?  Ah yes, in another
gaming suppliment from FGU (name eludes me at this point, but it was a
brown two book set) lists the ability of planets to be a Hydrogen based
atmosphere as being based on the planet\'s mass plus distance from primary
along with the primary\'s luminosity.  When I checked the formula for use
against the values listed in 2300 AD, not once did it fail to give me
values where the mass of the planet ect determined the retained molecular
weight as that of a Gas Giant in your tables.  It also gave me a system to
determine when a planet would be a Desert planet due to the fact that the
retained molecular value would not permit water vapor to exist.  Oddly
enough, it seems (I didn\'t check it as carefully as I did the Hydrogen
part) to agree with what your table in 2300 AD does...

  I finally (like real recently) discovered how to calculate the stellar
radius of stars based upon a ratio formula that takes into account Sol\'s
luminosity value, target star\'s luminosity value, plus a few other odds and
ends.  As you might guess, it is my hope that if I ever release the
"universe generator" over the net, that it have a wide range of
applications.  The first of which includes the ever fun "100 diameters"
limit for use with Traveller <grin>.

  A few thoughts from my end...

  One of the things I discovered while doing research for my program, is
that the spectral class M stars are not capable of radiating in the visible
light spectrum.  This precludes having planets in the M class systems with
photosysnthesis based oxyegen production.  I know it\'s too late to change
this from "canon" Traveller based products <grin>, but I would like to make
my program as "true" as possible to realism as I can generate.

  All in all, I want to take this moment to say to you that I enjoyed
Classical Traveller very much, and to this day, I still retain most of the
basic Classical stuff.  I retain the 3 black books, the High Guard,
Mercenary, Scouts, Merchants, along with some of the JTAS of the early
timeperiod.  I hunted until I could get my hands on STRIKER, and loved it
for what it was - on fine minitures system!  I also own a copy of the
basics for Megatraveller, along with FF&S and TNE.  I have since purchased
T4, Milleu Zero, as well as T4\'s version of FF&S.  I think two things,
actually 3 things has precluded my gaming group from using the T4 system.
The first off, is that we use GURPS for our main vehicle of choice for
roleplaying.  The second reason, is the way the T4 books came out (I bet
you are really tired of hearing that one, and I commiserate with you on
it).  The third reason is the mechanics of the skill systems were not as
well detailed as the GURPS, and that the progression of difficulty on a
statistical level didn\'t make sense.  While a novel concept, as a group
that used the T4 system for about 3 months, we discovered that it was
possible for characters with suffiently high enough stats (but not GODLY)
to be able to pull off successful "IMPOSSIBLE" stunts with alarming frequency.
  Those three things were mainly responsible for the T4 system to fall into
disfavor with our group.  However, once we heard that GURPS was licensed to
produce Traveller products, the group has since clamoured for a return
to... THE IMPERIUM (long may it live) <grin>.

  Well, I have bent your ear long enough.  Thanks for listening, and again,
I feel badly I have not written before this.  Take care, and I hope your
New Year is happy one.  My regards to you and your family...

      respectfully,

The basic idea was that people would be able to buy, or could win in 
competitions, or be granted \'for services to Traveller\', Imperial Noble 
titles.

eg
$50 might get you a knighthood
running a game at a con might get you the same

Most titles also come with some land (entire planets or even subsectors for 
higher titles), which become the official property of the player. The owners 
are encouraged to submit write-ups for publication. They can also interact 
with each other, in a kind of enormous PE game, with any important events 
being reported in JTAS.

A coordinator will be required to look after this.

Anime is a perfectly good art form, but I have never been able to work up much
of an interest in it (none at all, if you want the truth). GDW used several
artists who had clearly been influenced by anime styles (head too large on
proportion to the body, eyes too big for the face -- to name two), but some of
them improved over time.

That way you have a better idea of whether you *really* wan to join and you

Sheeze, Zane!  Don\'t get your trousers in a twist, I was only half
serious..if that. 

I\'ve always been of the opinion that you don\'t need *any* books to run a
rpg, but they can sure be useful.  Ok, I\'ll answer your objections as
seriously as I can on New Year\'s Eve. ;->

I think the GURPS Traveller book is going to be much more a setting book
than a supplement..from what I\'ve read, anyway.  The rules, equipment,
vehicles, and technology is going to be as much GURPS as possible.  I could
be wrong, and it doesn\'t matter either way. 

>Take a look at GURPS Lensman for example, it\'s a Space setting, but it
>doen\'t need or even want GURPS Space. 

Can\'t, it\'s out of print.  [Sorry, couldn\'t help myself] ;-> 

Hey, maybe I\'m wrong, but I don\'t expect SJG to port FFS (or even HG) over
to GURPS Traveller or put a new simplified system in the book.  I expect
they\'ll point the reader to Vehicles, Space and maybe FFS if you want
spaceships, other vehicles or equipment.  Don\'t you think SJG wants to sell
us all a copy of Space, Vehicles, and a few dozen more of their books? 
You, of course, don\'t *have* to buy them, but I think SJG really wants you
to desire them.  Not, that there\'s anything wrong with that!

>As for EDU and SOC, do you really need attributes for this, isn\'t this in

I\'d dump SOC as an attribute if I was designing any rpg.  Hum, well in a
class oriented society like the Imperium it *does* have its place, just not
as an attribute.  I don\'t like the way GURPS handles Advantages &
Disadvantages..like the concept, not the implementation, but that\'s a
different subject.

I disagree about dropping EDU, though.  We probably disagree on what EDU is
measuring.  I use it as the "scholarship" attribute in a group of four
mental attributes (REAsoning, EDUcation, CHArisma, WILl) that match up with
the four physical attributes (STRength, CONstitution, DEXterity, AGiLity). 
Remember, I\'m a heretic and I always do things my own way.  ;->

>One thing I\'m really hoping for is that they keep our Tech Levels as the
>GURPS Tech Levels seem a bit odd when talking about Traveller.

I don\'t like the implementation of either TL (surprise! surprise!).  Both
need to have more steps, spreading out the details...so there!

You know what?  I don\'t care very much either way, but I suspect our non-US
members may.  The yard/pound/gallon is great for human scale descriptions
(if you know the scale), but not for designing equipment or vehicles. 
[It\'s just that measuring a ship in cubic yards *feels* unnatural.] There
are conversions floating around to handle this anyway. One place everybody
is going to have to be careful is the usage of Ton, though, now we\'ll have
at least *four* different Tons..sigh!

>Face it, GURPS Traveller IS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD!  

Sheeze!  There you go again.  I *said* I liked GURPS..really! ;->

I know we\'re getting close to the millennium, but I don\'t think any SJG
product, even In Nomine, is going to bring about the end of the world. Nor
the end of Traveller, for that matter.

>Give it a chance, it might end up saving Traveller.  

Ah, a pox on all you doomsayers!  Traveller isn\'t in danger of
disappearing.  Even if it where completely out of publication, it would
live on as long as we talk about and play games we call Traveller.  I\'m not
going to stop that if IG goes out of business or even if SJG gets raided
again and the MIB run off with the only GURPS-Traveller manuscript (or it\'s
printed and bites big chunks -- as unlikely as *that* is)!  

Are you?  No?  So, lighten up and stop talking about Traveller like it\'s on
it\'s death bed.  I expect it to outlive us all.

IMO, YMMV, SOTR, GNMCWYA, and FNORD!

Now, go out and have a happy new year,

Hee!  Hee!  It\'s never been explained to my satisfaction either.  I was
named for my great Uncle Eris, one of several male Eris\' in the Gibson
family tree, going back at least 200 years.  How it got started, I have no
idea.  I rather suspect it has *nothing* to do with the Mother of Mars and
everything to do with a variant spelling of Eric.  I *do* use my name as an
excuse for my discordant nature..works great. ;->

The second most famous horse in American history.  I\'m sure Trigger comes
in first.

Yeah, but not until the next edition when the Templars, Hivers, and

Seriously, doubt it.  I hear the Imperial system will be used for the
Imperial setting.  

Say, why don\'t we just pretend that yards were extended by about 9%...now a
yard=meter, 36 inches=meter, and 4800yards=1mile?  A pound was reduced by
10%..now 2pounds=1kg, 16ounces=1kg, and 1ton=1ton. Liquid measures work out
pretty good too.

The thing I don\'t like about Ads/Disads is how they affect character points
during chargen.  I simply don\'t like "balanced characters" as a concept, I
prefer random ones.  That makes me different from your average GURPSian,
but so be it.  I *do* like the ad/disad concept to give character to
characters, though.

This is something I\'ve said over and over. I hate any kind of calculation
to be buried in the middle of text. When I need that calculation I want it
to stand out. Make the descriptions sidebars, and do the design sequences
inline with formula and tables.

That\'s Education, but only ONE way of looking at an EDU stat.  I\'ve already

And I really like the basic ideas behind the way Traveller generates

Not that they might not have "loved their characters and had a great time"
if their characters had been generated right out of CT, right? ;->  

I never said point-based design, the GURPS way, was wrong, bad, or evil. I
just said I would prefer there to be more than *one* way to generate the
characters, and that one of those ways was more similar to the Advanced CT
method.

>GURPS is not Traveller, systemwise at least and it does not need to be. YMMV.

Allen, Traveller isn\'t Traveller..unless you specify the version..for most
of us. So, how could GURPS be. ;->  You fellows don\'t seriously expect *me*
to play any game as written do you?  That would be..<shudder>..unnatural!

>(1) Freelance Traveller redesign assistance.

I can summarize all of my feelings with one organizational suggestion.

Your main page should have pretty basic HTML, preferably without frames, as
I find few people can do a frames-based page that comes across
successfully.  If Lynx can handle it well, then you have that section
architectured well.

Place all the DHTML, SCC, Java, Frames, and so on on a different page, in a
different tree.

If you are generating the HTML dynamically, then it shouldn\'t be too hard
to keep the two in sync.  If you are doing it by hand, this might be a
problem.

In either event, I strongly encourage all authors to note that there are
people who find IE4 and NS4 so terribly feature bloated that we use the old
versions by choice, and that we often want the goodies on your pages.
Also, I am quite capable of setting font choices in my browser, and if you
choose to use frames to force how I will see your page, then the font
choices I make for maximum reading comprehension will become
counterproductive.

(I like my monitor at a very high resolution with large font sizes, as I
have poor eyesight, but I like crisp graphics.  Programs where I can view
at 200%, or can change the default font, often work better.  Most browsers
are very good at this, unless frames are used to artificially limit the
size of some graphical elements.)

Juggernaut Press Acquires Traveller Play-by-Mail License

Development Begun on Traveller PBM: Emperors of the Flag

Juggernaut Press and SweetPea Entertainment have concluded a letter of intent
regarding the exclusive play-by-mail license for Traveller, Marc Millers
classic science-fiction role-playing game.
According to Bob McLain, owner of Juggernaut Press, work has begun on the
first Traveller PBM game, Emperors of the Flag, a strategic-level play-by-mail
game set in the Civil War era of the rich Traveller universe. The game is
expected to enter beta test in late summer 1998. The 15-20 players in each
computer-run game will vie for imperial power and notoriety using space and
ground forces, a network of characters, and intense politics. Among the main
features:
 a custom set-up process, almost a game in itself, where players will make
tough choices designing their own positions through the allocation of scarce
resources
 a starship construction system based on blueprints which allow players to
design unique ships or purchase existing models from a common registry
 a universe populated with useful, dangerous, and even strange characters,
each with unique talents and flaws, who can be hired or captured by players
 a non-linear path to victory giving equal opportunity for players who prefer
to pursue goals of conquest, economic growth, discovery, or adventure
 a combat system with wide scope for players to control both the strategic
and tactical aspects of battle in space and on the ground, and incorporating a
huge number of unit types
Traveller PBM will be available by post and by email. Turn reports will be
laser printed (or, in the case of email play, sent in .pdf format) and will
include narrative and statistical results, custom maps, and charts.
Juggernaut Press has established a mailing list where veteran PBM and
Traveller players can lend their expertise to the development of the game and
keep an eye on its progress. To join the list, send email to <traveller-list-
request@tightbeam.com> with the single word subscribe in the body of the
email.

The problem is this this: the current method for writing role-playing material
(Traveller, others) is to start at the beginning and follow a stream of
consciousness through to the end, much like writing a novel. That includes
ship design, which starts with the hull and then proceeds to the drives,
weaponry, and accomodations., etc.

As a player, I read the material once, and then turn to the charts when I need
to know answers. If I need detailed answers, I may reread the text.

What I want as a player is to be able to turn to the charts and understand
them and what is required of me. Read the T4.0 charts for space combat and
tell me you understand how to do the process. What does A P J mean (for one
example)?

Similarly, space combat pre-supposes the player knows how ships are built. And
ship building pre-supposes the player knows what equipment and weapons do.

The ideal format is a set of charts that walks the player through the process,
defining or explaining any items that need explaining. If combat ranges are
involved, the chart should be included, even if the data is already provided
elsewhere.

What this involves is the WRITER laying out the charts in final format, as
charts in two or three column format, and then playing with them to ensure
that they work. THEN, the WRITER needs to create the proper forms for
recording the material, and checklists that carry the player through the
process.

Conclusion. Charts should be separate. Some tables may need to be also in the
text to explain or elaborate on the text, but also in the chart set.

I use modules from other games as well--Space Opera, Gamma World, T2300.

I\'m using the Kafers in my campaign as well.  The big K\'s are being used by the
Zhodani in a prelude to the FFW.  I just had this huge encounter with the K\'s,
where the PC\'s are deputized by the local Marine detachment (4 guys, a doc, and a
commander) to investigate "unknown aliens" attacking a scientific research
station deep outsystem.

It was a blast (pardon the pun), and the PC\'s have had their first taste of this
game\'s Alien/Predator/Terminator type bad guys.

They couldn\'t believe what it took to take out one of these guys.  And, at the
end of the game, when they found out that the Kafers were "uplifted" from TL 0 to
their current TL by use of Zhodani psionic techiniques, everybody was agast.

They found out that, before the Zhodani found them, the Kafers were in a cave-man
like state (given their Int problems).  The Zhos used psionics to communicate
with them, gave them technology, taught them how to use it, and now they are a
Gem\'Hadar like force used by the Zhodani Consulate.

Better yet, the Imperium has never heard of them.  They come from somewhere
outside the Spinward Marches towards Zhodani space.

It was an encouter (actually several encounters) that we all had great fun with.

Following up on the praises on the recent B5 episode...

Great stuff: Loved the drama, loved the story, loved the space battles. 
Wish there had been more and I wish I could have seen this on a big 
screen (B5: The Next Generation Movie anyone?).

Anyhow--take a look at the "Lurkers Guide" B5 web page if you are 
interested in the show. Lots of news on the upcoming TBS made for TV 
movies (yes movies, two of them) as well a possible spinoff. And many 
hints on background, plot, questions, etc., etc., on shows seen and shows 
forthcoming...

On the gaming front my main supplier (Dragon\'s Trove) is stating that the 
board/space combat/miniatures game should be out soon. I\'ve got a massive 
order of minis on record, so any gamers in Central New Jersey are welcome 
to come and drool when they come in (of course, I will try to talk you 
into joining my upcoming Traveller game as well...).

The B5 minis have gotten some good advanced reviews, so I would urge 
those with no interest in B5 to check them out for use with Traveller. I 
would also suggest a gander (if you can find them) at some of the stuff 
that was done for FASA\'s now-gone Renegade Legion games. Some useable 
space fighters as well as ground stuff there...

Higher TL warheads will be triggered by something else than a standard
fission bomb.
Laser triggers, gravitic compression, super unstable isotopes in damper
fields etc. When they get rid of the fission trigger the warheads will get
increasingly smaller, right.

I wholeheartedly agree here. Just a quick flick through FS was enough
to indicate that something was seriously wrong. Corridor has no less than
7 worlds at TL 12 and one at TL 13, they just shouldn\'t be there (yes I do
know other people have noticed this :*). Two or three TL 12 worlds I
can believe, but not seven.

With EA (and CSC) I think its neccessary to be a bit \'easy\' with canon.
Greg Porter was trying to produce the suppliments in RPG mode so to
speak. These suppliments are presumably ment to be useable with more
than one milieu, so they have to include higher than M:0 tech; and it\'s
very hard to do that and stay in M:0 RPG mode. I think its best just to
regard the supposed experimental TL 14+ RoM stuff as theoretical
design studies.

As to relics, some real good fun can be had. Imagine your PC\'s as
the find a repairable TL 13 RoM computer; only to repair it and find
that a) it can\'t interface with anything they\'ve got and b) the software
on it is just the TL 13 equivilant of Claris Works and a whole load of
games. Or a laser rifle that won\'t accept standard Imperial power
couplings. The list could go on for quite awhile :*).

>Amen to your plea against overuse.

It was getting so that the code for an Ancient base was starport X :*) I\'d
hate to see that happen for the RoM (or anything).

My vote has to go with the old Classic Traveller system. I still use it, as
I like the choices it gives - do we go for staples (garanteed profit, but
not much) or go for the high risk, high return option?

Firstly the percentage of the fusion \'fuel\' that is \'fuzed\' does go down,
so the bomb becomes less efficient, but I don\'t think it drops fast enough
for there to be any real size limit for a fusion bomb. BTW the RL price of
a fusion bomb rises very slowly with yield, as the expensive bit is the
fission trigger.

On your second point - this isn\'t so, as research into sub-critical devices
shows that under sufficient pressure a normally sub-critical quantity of
Uranium or Plutonium can be made to undergo fission. Also onse the TL
advances to a point where fission triggers are no longer needed the size of
a bomb would be determined by yield and TL only, with no real lower limit.

Hydrogen-Grenade anyone?

Yeah, I re-read Milieu 0 for this info last night, and according to it,
Vland either: 

a) joined in -30 (p 48 "In Year -30 Vland, and the bulk of
the Vilani cultural region, agreed to join the Sylean Federation in
return for a promise not to interfere in the internal culture of the
Vilani People....One of the Chief negotiators for the Sylean side was
Cleon Zhunastu, then a member of the Grand senate")

b) joined immediately after the founding of the Third Imperium (p.77 "The
Vilani had been in secret negotiations with Cleon for some time, and
agreed to be the first sector to join the Imperium, immediately after its
founding...")

BreeEEEP breeEEEP All hands All hands we have a red alert...canon
explosion on the C deck ;-0

Vland sector changes some things drastically, making the 3I by far the
most populous high tech entity in known space..but I don\'t think that the
Vland sector made any great advances technologically during the long
night. In fact, the collapse was a perfect excuse for the Vilani to say
 "See where this dang new-fangled stuff gets you! We\'re going back to the
good ol\' days where men moved in 2 parsec jumps, and we had to load the
precious jump tapes by hand...and weeee LIKED it!"

So the 3I is still at a maximum of TL C, most of Vland is at TL A and B.
There should be no way that neighboring sectors have significant
populations at TL D and E. Numerical advantages will only go so far
against a technologically superior foe.

Then I had an thought...

Unless, of course, these high tech worlds don\'t view the 3I as a foe at
all, but a huge, expanding market for the goods that only they can
produce...;-) and \'free\' protection by the Naval fleets to boot. Nothing
like getting someone else to protect your profits, or do your dirty work.
Ain\'t whitewashing fences FUN? 

Perhaps this is where the mysterious disappearance of Zhunastu Industries

from Dagudashaag and Massilia...

No, it\'s clearly stated in FFS as bl = v/(100*tlm) and

The bore size is from the striker book 3 regarding the size of nukes, I use
it as reference for those who might want nukes of different TL\'s, also I
will be using it to figure out how many nukes will fit in the RAAMpage
Modules that will coming later.

As to why I did the nukes greater than the megaton range, well I was
curious, there is a article that describes a Imperial "Planet Killer"
warheads being mounted in starships to kill planets. Besides a 1 Gigaton
warhead could make for an interesting adventure/story. Say that the players
have to "disarm" the 1 Gigaton warhead under less than desirable
circumstances. If it goes boom well "Armor, Armor I don\'t need your
stinking Armor Values" <G>

One note however the damage/pen values are for detonations in empty space,
ie no atmosphere(s).

Just as and add on to the "engineering problems" mentioned above But the
ICF (Inertial Confinement Fusion) program at LLNL (Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory), (with which I was breifly associated with several
years ago) are working on a version of "hot" fusion which involves
imploding (a mixture of fusion fuels) in order to get the temperatures
and densities required. **It is a very different approach than the
magneticly confined "tokamack" fusion that is widely publicised and the
gavity confined fusion that we observe when we look up on that clear day
at noon.  They are very sure of there theory...They have tested it from
the high end....where more than enough energy is input... and the low
end where they have been doing more controled efforts with steadily
larger lasers to induce the implosion.  This low end was most recently
investigated there using the NOVA laser and according to predictions the
new laser facility (NIF--National Ignition Facility)--which they are
attempting to build--should provide a 1:1 reation.  That means they get
as much energy out as was put in to start the reaction in the first
place.  If this prediction is born out then, as someone pointed out
earlier on the list, then "we need more powerful lasers (paraphrased)".
When reactions with outputs greater than 1:1 we are on our way.  We will
still be a long ways away from a reactor that can reliably initiate
these reactions continuously for an extended period of time, but we\'ll
be on our way.

Just a little blurb from my own experience...I hope someone found it
useful.

I like Rob\'s system.  I want to be trading in "powdered Yarrow Root" not
"Carbohydrates".  Its a lot of work, but it makes trading really part of
the action.  Just stay away from shipping things like "assorted heavy
weapons".

Oh, and while we\'re on the subject, Jo Grant\'s 101 Cargos is simply a

The quote indicates to me that they *agreed to join* not that they 
did so publicly. This could have happened in the below noted secret 
negotiations, no?

So, immediately after the founding, they came forth and joined 
publicly.

This is true but contradicted by the text just above the formula which

You are using the Tech Level instead of the Tech Level Modifier.

Eric=92s table shows the Modifier decreasing for increasing TL

One way to get the barrel size down, although I don=92t know if this is

   Lb=3D(V / 100)TLm=20

I was presuming that the "databanks" (whatever they may actually be) would
be *comparable* in volume, mass, etc., to starship computers.  I was
further presuming that if I used the "databanks" comparable to "flight"
computers, I\'d have less storage capacity per computer than if I used the 
"databanks" comparable to "standard" (starship) computers, but by tacking
a huge number of these low-end "databanks" onboard, I could still have a
rspectable payload of data.  

(Remember that the Xboat is a far-future version of a *mail*truck*, with
the mail being measured in terms of mega-/giga-/terabytes, not in terms
of millions/billions/trillions of letters and magazines.)  

By the way, I was basing these presumptions on my real-world knowledge and
experience as a computer programmer in the US Air Force.  I wasn\'t an
electrician or a computer engineer, but I did talk with a few.  

For the purposes of my design, I was constructing a simile: the high-end 
"databanks" (the ones I presumed were similar to "Mod Std" computers) are
to current-day multi-gigabyte hard drives as the low-end "databanks" (the 
ones I presumed were similar to "Mod Flt" computers) are to current-day 
megabyte hard drives.  

Since Mr. Miller and GDW *never* published any data in any of the official 
products for constructing ships (and other items of future technology) to
cover this area, I was extrapolating from existing sources a *possible* 
solution.  

<aside>
Well, actually, in CT, Book 2 listed "CPU" capacity for various computer
models and required space for various programs.  However, their assertion
that a Library program, one containing the millions of millions of
*millions* of ... (you get the idea) ... of data that an *interstellar*
civilization would have would take only 1 or 2 "units" of storage space,
but an escape-and-evasion program could conceivably take 5+ such storage
spaces, was somewhat ludicrous to this computer professional.  
(No offense intended.)  
</aside>

I never stated that my suggestion was flawless, or even very good for that
matter.  I just offered it as *a* suggestion.  I\'d like to know how you
resolved the issue of "capacity-vs-expense" (11,000 worlds producing so
much "mail" vs. an Imperium that has to *affordably* move this mail
traffic).

OK, you cite 3 inventions in 800 years.  I\'ll also give you the Heavy plow
and use of horses instead of oxen.  The stuff borrowed doesn\'t count (it
actually makes my point if that is stuff that brought Europe out of the Dark
Ages) as in "The Long Night" there was no one to borrow from.  Let\'s see
when else do we see this level of advancement...hmmmm...how about stone age?
Rock as a tool (covers lots of inventions right there), fire (management and
benefits therefrom), farming (as opposed to gathering), paint (for the cave
paintings), and language.  None of these are small advances, but let\'s take
a close look at what you\'re saying about the dark ages.  The "technological"
jumps made in 800 years stack up pretty unfavorably against the 100,000
years of advances made by Neanderthals.  Granted the Neanderthals had more
time, but I think you\'d have to agree that any one of Neanderthal inventions
DRAMATICALLY altered their lifestyle whereas the inventions in the Dark Ages
PERPETUATED an existing life style.

Uhm, maybe one of the canon guys would want to correct me, but a 1700 year
loss of empire could reasonably be considered "falling apart."

Please pass on the references.  I searched the net as thouroughly as a
couple of hours would allow and the only reference I found to strong
technical achievements in medieval times was Ms. White.  The "big advances"
I\'ll argue, seem puny even within the scope of their times.  Shouldn\'t we
also count big negatives as a sense of the scope of the technology of the
times?  Shouldn\'t the polution of rivers negatively effect the technology
level of the Industrial Age and shouldn\'t the lack of hygene in big cities
(supported by the agricultural advances noted above) be counted against the
tech level of the "Dark Ages?"

Been to Egypt?  How about Babylon?  Mesepotamia?  No slam against these
countries, but the cultures that were originally there did stagnate for
hundreds of years until outside influences renewed them.  They weren\'t the
only ones either.  Given a sense of scale, it is not unreasonable to expect
that this could happen during the long night.

More importantly, how can "[t]he rate of progress be slow" in worlds which
have "died or sunk to barbarism?"  Seems to me that the rate of progress
would be negative and solidly negative at that.  Why is it reasonable to
expect that a world which once had high tech and lost it could return to
that tech level faster than a world which had never reached the high tech?
The trip from TL-9 (us right now, right?) to TL-13 is thought to take 4000
years in Traveller, right?  So if a world fell to barbarism (TL-0?) in one
generation (mighty fast, but give me latitude) from even TL-12, you would
expect that it would take 5-10,000 years to recover at best--still well past
the 1700 years available in the long night.  Maybe these folks would be TL-1
by now.  If it took 3-400 years to go to barbarism, maybe they are still TL-0!

The proposal on International Starship issues has made me think of the
question of Privateering in the early 3rd Imp.  I remember that back in MT
days, Pirates could get a "Letter of Marque" From a Sector Duke (or Faction
Leader as it was in MT) where they could only prey upon ships of an enemy
nation.

I don\'t remeber exactly, but I believe basicaly your govt gives you
missions, but if you\'re caught by the enemy, they don\'t even acknowledge
your existance (FNORD!)  You are then subject to the enemy\'s piracy laws.

Being an ex-privateer of the Domai...er...Terran Confed, I am interested in
how Cleon deals with piracy and privateering.  Perhaps the Privateer could
be considered a 4th class or extra-teritorial ship?
- ----

I imagine Letters of Marque are around in Mileu 0.  A Letter of Marque
entitled the bearer to seize or destroy the assets of an enemy, and granted
a certain legal immunity for those actions (immunity from the laws of the
government that GRANTED the Letter of Marque).  The advantage of this is
the granting nation gets a free naval asset (albeit not a Ship of the Line)
and is able to hurt an enemy state without expending resources.  If the
privateer is caught, the granting government can either repudiate the
Letter of Marque, or simply ignore the situation, or use the situation as
an act of provocation to declare war (you are holding our loyal servant
Commander X?  Prepare to feel the might of our fleet!).

As for Pirates (unMarqued privateers), I suspect Cleon would handle them
just like every other government in history has handled hostile pirates.
They would be declared wolves and hunted down, or if they were strong
enough the Imperium would attempt to co-opt them by making them Privateers.

I think in the Mileu 0 Imperium you have a couple of sources for Letters of
 Marque (or their equivalents)

1.  The Imperium.  It strikes me that when the Imperium grants an
exploitation charter for a company to effectively rule a world, the
Imperium is granting that company governmental powers and aauthority,
including the right to arm and maintain a military.  That is a kind of
Letter of Marque, in that the company could seize ships entering their
chartered territory with full legal authority.  The Imperium probably would
be hiring some more "traditional" privateers with Letters of Marque as
well, to disrupt the economies of rival Pocket Empires and to reduce the
piracy problems within the Imperium itself.  As for the Civil Disarmament
regulations, since these vessels would be sponsored by the Imperium or a
major noble, they would easily fit into the Class IV definition.

2.  Megacorporations.  OK, so the Megacorps are not governments, but they
have interests just like a government, and they have trans-national goals
and animosities just like a government.  If you have a corporation that\'s
big enough, they would occasionally find a need for a fighting starship
force, and they might just sponsor some privateers to keep such a fighting
force on retainer (and to make life uncomfortable for the competition).
This one is as much piracy as privateering.

3.  Lesser Nobles.  Based on the M:0 Sourcebook, it seems that some nobles
weild a goodly amount of clout and power, and have their own military
forces (or strongly influence portions of the Imperial military).  It might
be in these nobles\' best interests to have a privateer or two on retainer
to intimidate rivals, build a case for their own military buildup, or even
to discredit the Imperium.  This one would seem to be a VERY dangerous game
to get into; the privateers involved in things like this are really
pirates, and would probably be the worst of the bunch, and likely the
meanest as well.

I believe (I could be WRONG--anyone out there with more insight please
correct any misconceptions) I read somewhere--a long time ago..so take
this with a grain of salt--that critical mass it the mass needed at
"natural" densities.  If I remember correctly its more of a critical
mass for a given density (kind of makes sense it you spread out the
warhead over a volume the size of the moon you wouldn\'t expect it to go
off.)  So as your tech allows you to have better techniques of achieving
the mass/densities required the actual amount of mass required may go
down (at higher densities the "percieved" mass around any given atom of
the bulk would appear to be higher--core neutrons have a smaller chance
of escaping the core without collisions with other atoms).  (this is for
fission)

For fusion there is no critical mass and once the you have the right
ranges of temperature and density you get a reaction.

....Out on a limb....please correct mistakes

My point is that they were not flight computers, and using the rules for
such to create them wouldn\'t work.

As such your idea give a poor picture of the actual economics of how the
X-boat system works, as these things aren\'t computers, per se.

How I \'handled\' it was pretty much the same way I laid it out...the X-boat
\'databanks\' aren\'t computers, but whatever the TL-15 equivalent of very
large RAID (Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Drives for those not in the
acronym business) systems were, and the X-Boat tender itself contained
smaller versions of the same things, downloading the incoming data,
deleting it from the X-boat banks after, and then uploading the outgoing
data headed in the direction the X-boat was going.

These systems have never been well detailed, so I never tried to detail
them.

Data densities at TL-15 have got to be quite staggering, and since an
X-boat has tons and tons of displacement for these databanks, I suspect
that the X-boat network easily managed to stay within the \'bandwidth\'
required for the Imperium\'s traffic...if one Xboat is filled up, or a
route continually overloads, they\'ll throw more X-boats into the traffic
stream.

Think of it as a switched packet network with LOTS of space
between packets; you can ramp up packet density quite a bit before you
start seeing collisions. I wouldn\'t be surprised if the heavily traveled
interior lanes of the Imperium have _hundreds_ of X-Boats moving through
daily.

The switches are the X-boat tenders and their stations.

Remember, space is big, really, really mind-bogglingly big. An X-boat
might hold several megaterabytes of data (remember, it may be carrying
material meant for the farthest reaches of the imperium at any given time)
so even at the rate a TL-15 society generates data, I suspect data STORAGE
technology will keep up, and throwing another X-boat into the breach
will probably work for some time. 

(Today, storage available to the average PC user is three to four orders
of magnitude greater than it was ten years ago, and they show no real sign
of slowing down anytime soon...and if we could just eradicate Windows 95
we might even be able to use that space for something useful ;-) 

Also, the vast majority of canon has revolved around the Spinward Marches
which are the FRONTIER of the Imperium. A standard X-boat on the
Vland-Core route will probably be much larger than the X-Boats used on
frontier routes, too.

I suspect that the real bottleneck (other than jumpspace time) is dumping
these gargantuan amounts of data into the planetary networks. I suspect
that really BIG customers have dedicated X-boat tenders. and on some
routes, dedicated X-boats (Can you IMAGINE the traffic that say, Nassirka
generates to their headquarters and back out on a daily basis!!!???)

This already happens here on earth...Gateway Computer has their own, LARGE
UPS branch right there on their loading dock, and lots of places have UPS
and FedEx delivery people dedicated to single customers. The UA, here, is
its own zip code.

When that much traffic is cruising through an Imperium subsidized service,
we can see why X-boat rates are so low.

Computer technology throughout Traveller has been rather poorly detailed,
so I\'m leery of trying to use the rules that are in place for generating
general purpose systems, since all the rules are for specialized systems, 
such as flight computers.

OTOH, I never had a player who wanted to use an X-boat for anything,
either.

   Warheads typically use sub-critical masses, the more efficient the
design, the less mass you need to achieve criticality in the reaction.
Nukes work by artificially creating the conditions necessary to fission,
without necessarily needing critical mass. (Which is the mass needed for a
*spontaneous* reaction!)

   Also, consider that beyond TL12 that gravitic devices come into play to
increase the efficiency of (and dispense with the need for fission
triggers for) fusion weapons (H-bombs).

Incorrect.  The Glock is not "plastic coated".  The receiver, trigger,
and magazine are all made of their special polymer material.  There is
a steel spring in the magazine, though.

If left intact, an x-ray machine operator not trained to identify the
weapon will probably let it through.  A trained operator, OTOH,
catches it every time.  Problems arise when the weapon is disassembled
and stored in individual pieces (ie: the familiar shape of the
receiver will only show up under the newest x-ray machines).

!?!  As I stated above, the receiver (ie: frame) is polymer and is
designed to actually *absorb* some of the recoil (which surprised
many, considering lighter weapons normally have *more* felt recoil).
The slide and barrel are both metal, however, as is the ammunition.

The DH2 writers even had Bruce Willis\' character refer to the Glock as
a "ceramic gun".  All stirred up by reports of alleged sales of an
"undetectable" weapon to Libya in 1985 (no guns were ever shipped, but
it did not stop the media from jumping on the bandwagon and ignoring
simple facts).

Probably would have had a better chance smuggling a bow and a quiver
of arrows :)

Our group uses the rules as published in T4 - liberally sprinkled with
patrons, referee-decreed fudges (for encounters), etc. It generally works
pretty well (only 4 games\' worth so far, though...)

A brief, nonprogrammatic look at this seems to indicate that TL does not
vary dependent on any other variable (witness the number of XXX000
worlds with tech levels). This is not right, as many others
have said, and should be based on a combination of the population and the
conditions they need to live under. 

Maybe I should look at the relationships between the M0 and the M1100
data...

"In the Line of Fire"

No actually, he was reasonably clever in how he did it, stuck \'em in the
hollow base of his lucky rabbit\'s foot keychain..which went into the
little plastic dish that everyone\'s keys, loose change, etc gets dumped
into when you go through a metal detector.

The gun he made was essentially a plastic (not ceramic) zip gun. There was
a fairly detailed sequennce in the beginning where he was making the
thing, and he\'s quite clearly mixing polymer and hardener materials
together, pouring them into the mold, etc. 

With the right materials, you could probably make such a thing relatively
easily. With properly down-powered rounds, you could probably even stand a
good chance of shooting the thing a couple of times without blowing your
hand off.

Remember, this thing was designed to be shot from _feet_ away, so you
really don\'t need that high powered a round, especially if you use dum dum
rounds, exploding rounds or something like those \'talon\' things that there
was such a hooferaw about a couple of years ago. 

In Traveller terms, this would be very simple to make...they\'re called
body pistols ;-)

It was a good one. B5 should be of particular interest to Traveller fans
because, like Traveller, it makes an honest attempt at being realistic as
far as what the technology might be like.

The show pays homage to the realities of physics!

Not to mention that it has a rich background, several interesting alien
races and an epic plot just like our favorite game.

on colonization, military builds & actions, etc. 

What can they do?


Also, the authors and playtesters of PE doubtless
have some spreadsheets to aid play. I *strongly* 
recommend making the best of these available over 
the web. 

From what I\'ve seen so far, PE has a lot right with 
it, but the biggest thing wrong with it is organization.
Nearly every sequence has a table, but since all the
tables were moved to the back of the book there
is a tedious need to flip back and forth (ESPECIALLY
since most of the table roll MODIFIERS are in the TEXT
section, rather than grouped with the table itself).
The problem grows exponentially as the number of worlds 
increases, and a GM might be keeping track of a subsector
or two\'s worth of worlds.  Without electronic assistance
it can be quite time consuming (perhaps a little *TOO*
time consuming, wink wink, nudge nudge, get my drift?).

How \'bout it?

According to the World Builder\'s Handbook, the minimum diameter of a size 
S world is 160 km. Most shepherd moons are going to be smaller than that, 
so I\'d just assume the shepherd moons are present and just constitute the 
"biggest chunks" of ring material.

FYI, Using a diameter of 160 km as the lower limit for a size "S" world, 
and 800 the upper, in our solar system Jupiter has 2 (Amalthea and 
Himalia), Saturn has 5 (Janus, Mimas, Enceladus, Hyperion, and Phoebe), 
Uranus has 1 (Miranda), and Neptune 3 (Larissa, Proteus, and Nereid) with 
Galatea at a radius of 79 km just coming under the wire.

For the truly pedantic and retentive GM, may I suggest a new size digit, 
"P" for Planetesimal? This would encompass those natural satellites of 
diameter 8-160 km. That way, even Deimos and Phobos can get in on those 
navigation charts!

OK, lets add a few --

And that\'s just the obvious ones. It\'s generally unwise to make

Of course, when you add in advances in the arts and scientific

Now that you mention it, such "floating drydocks" have to exist, just
to allow repair/salvage of ships that lose their jump drive at a C or
lower system.

I\'d want to check the prices, but I suspect that either a "jump tug"
(much like a civilian version of a battlerider "core") or the jump
capable shipyard idea will be workable. Possibly *both* are workable at
some size ranges.

<snip>

I don\'t really have a problem with the TL D worlds.  In 1700+ years it
only makes sense that a few TL 11& 12 worlds would (after likely dropping
to TL 9 or 10) move up to 13.  I think it\'s naive to assume that the
Imperium won out due to higher technology alone.  They had better
organization, better planning, and they were actually trying to form an
empire and had been for hundreds of years (the Sylean Federation is
hundreds of years old).  As long as most of these TL D worlds are either
research bases or fairly isolated worlds with few designs for conquest or
expansion there is no problem.  Also, a number of these worlds may be
inhabited by non-humans whose technology is simply too odd or to difficult
to use to easily borrow. 

Also, the Syleans have Fusion+, and no one else does unless they buy it
from the Syleans.  This would make a major difference.  Everyone wants
Fusion+, since it is incredibly superior to batteries and fuel cells. The
Syleans have it and have too many ships for a single TL D world to safely
attack them.  End result: trade with the Syleans and join the new
Imperium. 

TL 14 does seem rather high for this era and those worlds should (IMHO) be
reduced to C or D (unless they are high tech ruins)

Why?  How about if the Imperium finds such a world around year 4.  OK,
well you now have a several sector wide Imperium meeting *1* world (with
maybe a few lower tech colonies).  The higher tech world joins the
Imperium, no the other way around.  The only problem arises if the higher
tech world has a large, expansionist, pocket empire.  (Also, I do agree
that TL E worlds in year 0 should be reduced to D, I see the TL D worlds
as much like the TL G worlds in 1117, a few exceptional worlds on the
absolute cutting edge of technology, TL E is too high for Year 0.

...I have to agree - excellent supplement.

Don\'t forget it has tables for who is shipping what to whom and why and

Tables for creating a Standard Shipping Code as well as Universal Hazard

DO NOT think that JTAS 25 did justice to this supplement by publishing 100
of the cargoes!

I\'m setting up a campaign and I\'d like to something offbeat for the ship 
the PCs will be using. I want to start them off with some capabilities, 
but not a perfect ship...one that needs maintenance and upgrading.

One thought was to give them a ship that has multi-jump capability, but 
is under a severe need for repairs so that it is limited to J1 (something 
like the one "push" used in The Traveller Adventure to limit the PCs to a 
certain route).

Another thought was to weapons capability. I thought of giving them some 
decent defensive capability (sandcasters and the like), but very limited 
offensive capability...my memory went back to...

Triplanetary, First (1973) Edition

Didn\'t this version have ships equipped with .50 caliber machine guns? 
Now I don\'t pretend to be a Traveller Gearhead (I leave that to other 
members of the TML group), but this might be a interesting (and for the 
players frustrating...think of the attempts to get ammo!) way of gunning 
the ship...until they can make enough money to buy a "real" weapon like a 
laser!

So, the question is: Do any of the ship experts on the list have any 
thoughts along these lines to help out a non-Gearhead? Would machine guns 
be worthwhile at all as a weapon (even in scaring off Evil Pirates 
because you are shooting the heck out of their antennas, etc.)? Any 
chance at all of penetrating windows, areas, screwing up engine nozzles, 
etc.., etc., etc.?

Any help at all would be appreciated (and credited...want to be the NPC 
that sells this ship to my PC group?)

Okay, now the heavy plow and improved yoke were inventions that radically
and permanently reshaped Northern European culture. Combined they rate on
a par with the wheel. They more than doubled food production by allowing two
crops per year and the cultivation of marginal land; they enabled the
dietary shift
to legumes with the attendant drop in infant mortality and increase in
female life
expecancy. These two inventions allowed the accumulation of wealth, and
delayed childrearing that characterise Northern European culture. The
introduction of accurate mechanical timekeeping enabled the great European
age of discovery (navigation would have been impossible without them). Just
look at the great cathedrals built during later half of this period. Add to
these
the pommelled saddle (vital for the charging heavy lance cavalry); the use
of clinker shipbuilding and then caravel shipbuilding, deep draught hulls, the
rudder, the chimney. Plus many of our philosophical and legal concepts date
from this era (such as ending subinfeudation 1198).

And incidentially, the stirrup and windmills appeared in Northern Europe
during late Roman times.

Could be considered to have fallen apart. Once you have stopped falling, you
go forwards again. I see the Long Night as very much like the Northern
European Dark Age; characterised mostly by a lack of administrative
competence rather than a lack technological competence. No empire emerged
because there was a lack of depth of administrative skills, you could have some
brilliant ephemerial Empires (such as the dark age North Sea and Carolingean
Empires), but these would be dependent on brilliant individuals, when their
creators are removed, they collapse.

Both Egypt and the fertile crecent stagnated not due to collapse but due to
a failure to adapt. They did not develop the mass literacy of the Europeans
and just slowly sunk (in the fertile crecent this was greatly assisted by a
singular act of vandalism by some asian horse nomads). Faced with
competition from Europe they did not develop, but rather retreated into
conservatism and infighting. Once sunk, they stayed sunk due to significant
external influences wanting them to stay sunk.

Technology is lost far faster than it is recovered (Russia took over 30 years
to recover the very moderate losses during 1917-21). But recovering lost
technology is faster than developing it. However there is a point at which
it becomes impossible to recover lost technology. When significant cultural
drift has occured, you lose the basic understanding of the mindset that
created the technology. Thus the \'Dark Ages\' Northern European
culture was unable to recover Roman technology as it was significantly
different from the Roman culture (you not only have to understand the
how, but also the why). This is what I think happened during the Long
Night. The former Vilani worlds absorbed significant Solomani culture
and in the process became divorced from both. Thus they were
unable to simply recover either Ziru Sirka or RoM tech as they had
lost their cultural connection to it.

For spaceship and starship combat, I wouldn\'t use any weapon with "muzzle"
speed lesser than 0.1c. Even with a laser it takes quite a long time to
reach it\'s target. Further more the sensor lock don\'t give the actual
position and heading but the one several secondes before. That\'s why it\'s
hard to hit a space ship even with a computer linked sensor/laser (called
MFD). This is the optimum weapon to hit a ship at a given range.

Now for slug weapon, don\'t even think about it.

I\'ve seen a fusion gun (quite havy fusion gun in fact) mounted on a ship
(Victrix class). The weapon wasn\'t used for space combat but for air and
ground combat, where the speeds and distances are much smaller. FFS stated
that Fusion muzzle speed was around 8000hm/h which is very very very far
from speed of light. May be at very close range. But even though, it\'s very
hard to match vectors in space (especially if the other ship doesn\'t want
you match its vector ;-).

So machine guns could only be used in air combat or ground strikes. So if
your ship isn\'t AF, it\'s not very usfull.

Well, first of all, a 50 cal machinegun will do some dammage to a ship, but 
only if its right on top of you. (0 hexes or within 30,000km)  This is how 
alot of The Point Defence
systems in EA work.  The Plasma weapon can do a heluva lot of dammage, but 
the enemy has to be on your doorstep before you can wail on them, and them 
plasma PD guns will vape almost anything!

My strategy when I was down to PD systems was to let the bastards think I\'m 
down, and preparing for boarders.  Then when they just about to dock, open 
up on \'em with the PD lasers, use the sandcasters like shotguns, and DAMN 
THE TORPEDES!....sorry, got a little carried away there! :-)  Needless to 
say, after that the enemy boarders had no sensors or working weapon systems, 
and the bridge didn\'t look to cool either! (Heh!)

My company does have a new PD system based on VRF Gauss Technology.  It is a 
10 barrel 8mm Gauss VRF gun designed to shred missiles and close combat 
craft (like fighters).  Origionaly the thing did 50 damage to ground targets 
and 2 to starships, but that was before the new chart was printed in EA. (I 
don\'t have EA in front of me, but could some kind soul on the TML please 
post the EA USD dammage equivalency?) I\'m still wondering what chart is the 
one to use, but it looks like its Porter\'s system for weapons like this. 
 Personaly I cant wait for  FF&S II to come out! :-)

Come down to Planet X (http://www.magicnet.net/~cmdrx/x.htm)
click on the "Promenade" button, then click "X-TEK Arms"
for our Starship Weaponry Catalog.

The weapon system you want is the "Stinger" Point Defence/Ground Assault VRF 
Gauss System.

And if you realy want wierd, check out the "Ice Caster"  It\'s just a high 
pressure water canon! (Water freezes quickly at 3 Kelvin, making shards of 
ice as hard as steel!)

Which is why IG should have made up its mind whether it was a Milieu 0
module or a General module. Both would have been useful and worthwhile.
A General module about tech sould have an overwiew of tech all the way
up to 16 (at least) with a single example of each type and few, if any,
illustrations; a Milieu X module about tech would have a broader selection
of stuff with several alternatives for each item and lots of \'period\'
illustrations. Trying to do both in one book was a mistake.

Not necessarily a contradiction. In -30 they agreed to join the Federation
and in 0, following secret negotiations, they supported Cleon for emperor.
Two quite different things, actually. Cleon obviously made good use of his
stint as a Federation negotiator to make friends on Vland.

I agree with your conclusion, but the premise is not quite sound. If the
difference in tech is "only" a few levels then numerical superiority _will_
allow you to defeat a technologically superior enemy. By High Guard rules
a TL 14 force will have about a 10:1 advantage over a TL 12 force. So the
Imperium "merely" has to outnumber the foe by more than 10:1 (or out-
general him). The problem is that IF the Imperium defeated a TL 14 foe
(or absorbed him peacefully, for that matter), then they\'d find out how to
build those TL 14 ships and weapons, in which case they\'d reach TL 13 a
lot sooner than 300 and TL 14 a lot sooner than 700. Likewise if RoM was
actually TL 14. The knowledge of a single planet may disappear in a
catastrophe, the way the Darrian knowledge did, but I find it hard to
accept that the knowledge of anything as widespread as the RoM could 
disappear completely.

The whole point of a Letter of Marque is that it gives a private man-of-war
legal protection against the _enemy_ if he is caught. The LoM informs the
opposing government that this is not a pirate, but an individual who,
albeit a private individual, is entitled to the same protection as
regular soldiers of that nation. As such, a LoM is only worth anything
if the enemy 1) treats captures soldiers better than pirates and b) accept 
the concept of Letters of Marque. So they are useless if the opposing sides
does not subscribe to some common code of conduct.

Historically some privateers sometimes succumbed to the temptation to
capture neutrals (or even friendlies!), which made them pirates and which
gave all privateers a bad reputation.

Pirates were hated by all ordinary sailors. It may not be true, but there 
are stories of enemy ships making temporary truces in order to hunt down 
pirates.

Possibly, but not necessarily, so. Historically governments have been very
reluctant to grant private companies that kind of power. There were plenty 
of company charters granted by European kings during the 16th and 17th
centuries, but the only one that ever recieved the right to raise regiments
and ships was the British East India Company (and they got revoked after
the Great Mutiny). Mostly the kings provided the companies with regular
soldiers to protect their trade stations.

One of the major factors in the expansion of Sylea may be the seemingly
simplest one - Sylea is the only major power around that is really
hunkerin\' to re-establish a total interstellar rule. So one else cares.
I mean, look at how things are today - why hasn\'t the US invaded Canada
and Mexico to establish a really huge power base? It could save them
a lot of hassles in the long run... Of course, we all know why - it\'s
expensive and there\'s simply no real motivation to do so. Now, with
NAFTA, et al, maybe Canada, US & Mexico are slowly moving to a situation
where there is so little room in terms of what you can do without violating
all these treaties, so that the countries are, in essence, a single
political entity.  Certainly, when it comes to trade, they pretty much
are already. Other internal matters are left up to the individual
countries... hm, sound familiar?

In terms of actual military action to force planets into the Imperium, 
again, after 1700 years of little or no interstellar traffic, I\'d
bet that most systems don\'t have anything that you could call a "space
navy". Maybe Sylea is the first "empire" to re-arm itself in a serious
way.

Finally, in spite of the RoM having reached borderline TL13 a looong
time ago, they didn\'t discover Fusion+. Sylea has discovered something
that everyone else has overlooked for a long time and it\'s probably
giving them some sort of economic if not a military edge. (You know, 
I wonder if those little Fusion+ powered fighters could really make
a big difference on the battlefie... *AAARGH* *SPLAT* as .3c rock

From the other set of data that was posted, it seems like all those
M0 high-tech worlds were very high tech worlds in 1100... it seems like
all that happened was that they went through 1100 data and did
new_tl=old_tl-2 or some such thing. Groan - this should probably
be written off as a bad mechanical conversion and fixed by hand.

The Vargr Pacification Campaigns dosen\'t start till 220 (and runs to 348).
That fits perfectly with my theory. Read what I wrote: "When the Imperium 
moved into these areas it attracted the Vargr from further coreward..."

The sequence of events as I envisage them is something like this: First the
Imperium moves into the largely empty areas in Corridor (or Eneri, if you
insist), Deneb, and the subsectors just coreward of that. Eventually the
Vargr discover all these yummy new targets and start moving in. They start
with the colonies closest to them, so traffic trough Eneri and Deneb is not
impeeded at first. Then the pressures grow bigger and the Imperium begin the
Vargr Campaigns. The Campaigns end with the Imperium abandoning any colonies
coreward of the Spinward Marches/Deneb/Corridor sector border (and with 
Eneri\'s name changed to Corridor).


And just to avoid misunderstandings: The above is not what I claim canon is,
it\'s what I think canon ought to be.

You\'re quite right. Given our own recent history it does seem implausible
that at least _some_ worlds would not advance tremendously in 1700 years.
The problem is that this is one of the places where the Traveller Universe
differs from the real universe. In the Traveller Universe it must be 
tremendously difficult to go up a TL on your own. The rapid advances of
the Terrans and the Darrians has to be freak occurences. Otherwise it is
impossible to explain why the 3rd Imperium, backed by the Industrial might
of scores of high-population planets, nevertheless dosen\'t reach TL 13 till
300 and TL 14 till 700 (Or why scorers of hundreds of planets regularily
stagnate at the same TL for centuries and millenia).

You do realize, don\'t you, that it would take about 100 planets like Sylea
to _match_ the might of one population B, TL 14 planet? (Population B is 
10 times population A and TL 14 ships outmatch TL 12 ships about 10:1
(Admittedly, this dosen\'t factor in the difference that Fusion+ would 
make)).

Assuming the planet is a sphere. The formula is:

A = 4*pi*r^2

where r is the radius of the planet

or

A = pi*d^2

where d is the diameter of the planet.

The surface area of a sphere is 4 x pi x r^2.

(Volume is 4/3 x pi x r^3)

153.9 million square miles roughly.  Sounds about right.

But don\'t forget that your planet may not have a diameter that is exactly
7000 miles and it may not be entirely spherical.  Though Traveller worlds
can be regarded as spheres to all intents and purposes.

   I don\'t think that there is any doubt that progress in the 5th-12th
   centuries was much slower than what we are used to today.  What may
   be a more interesting question is whether progress in that period was
   slower than in previous ages.  Did technology really regress from
   that of the Roman period?  Clearly, government regressed.  Less
   clearly, trade probably regressed too.  According to `theory,\' this
   implies that the rate of technological invention also dropped, but
   documents from this period are spotty, so an objective test of this
   theory is hard to make.

> Brett "It still sounds like \'Dark Ages\' to me" Fishburne

   They definitely are dark in the sense that we have little information
   about them.  But their technological advancement, compared to
   previous ages and other cultures, is still an open question.  The
   Dark Ages definitely did have a few bright spots, though. Among the
   more important of them not mentioned already:

   * `Books\' were invented (codices with spines and individual
   pages, as opposed to scrolls), making data retrieval much faster,
   easier and efficient, and making tables of contents, indices and
   page (or chapter) numbering possible.

   * Slavery was abolished (by degrees, apparently) and pretty much
   stayed abolished until the alleged Renaissance.

The formula for the surface area of a sphere is 4 * Pi * R^2
(Pi is approx. 3.1415927; "R" is the radius of the sphere).  

Using algebra, we can simplify this to Pi * D^2 ("D" is the diameter).  

Assuming you have just the UWP Size Code, and *not* a specific, actual
value for the planet\'s diameter, we can use algebra again to get the
following...  

(1,000 miles is approx. 1,600 kilometers.)

Surface Area = Pi * D^2
= 3.1415927 * (UWP Size Code * 1600)^2
= 3.1415927 * (UWP Size Code)^2 * 1600^2
= 3.1415927 * 1600^2 * (UWP Size Code)^2
= 3.1415927 * 2.56 * 10^6 * (UWP Size Code)^2
= 8.0424773 * 10^6 * (UWP Size Code)^2

Disgustingly simplified formula:

  As a member of the list who is employed as a historian of technology, I
really feal I have to jump in here.  While the neolithic revolution in
agriculture is one of the fundamental changes in the history of human
society (and some would argue that it is the only technological change
worth talking about, since all technical advance since can in some sense
be attributed to it), the Middle Ages are the most concentrated period of
human invention outside of the modern period (roughly from the early 19th
century to the present).  The people of the Middle Ages invented a wide
variety of concepts and technologies that are fundamental to modern
capitalist society.  The list above is not all inclusive - such
fundamental changes as the modern bank, the university, double-entry
book-keeping, and a host of others are legacies of the middle ages.

  Now, why do we call them the Dark Ages?  The Italian Humanists, that\'s
why, who looked to Greek and Rome as the models for all achievement.
After all, they could look about them and see the evidence - Roman walls
and Greek statues.  The reason that Roman structures were still about,
however, is that Roman engineers built everything with big honking safety
factors, since they did things by experience, not experiment.
Technologically, the Romans were just a Neolithic culture with
pretensions.

  That\'s Mr. White - helps to know the field.  You make the increasingly
common mistake that my students do - if it is not on the web it does not
exist.  I could go into a tirade here about how the web is basically full
of stuff that computer geeks want to look at, like porn and computer
stuff, but I will not.  What I will say is that much of the evidence that
supports (and contradicts) White has been until recently buried in obscure
journals with small circulations.  Fortunatly for us (and for my
students), there is a new book, the first review of which I saw only on
Monday.  It is by Frances and Joseph Gies, and is titled _Catherdral,
Forge, and Waterwheel:  Technology and Invention in the Middle Ages_
(Harper Perrenial, 1995).  You\'ll notice the book has been out for almost
two years - historians take a long time to get around to doing book
reviews. 

  Anyway, I strongly suggest you read the Gies book - I have not seen a
copy yet, but according to the reviewer (who I know personally and respect
as an expert in this field) it is the best available survey  in this area.
You will find the Middle Ages far from Dark, and actually a rather
intersting time rather different than that portrayed in popular myth.

Indeed, the EA book itself states that "Many descriptions are theoretical,
based on personal journals, fragmentary data logs, and known theoretical
work at the time...." So they anomalies with previous history can be explained
as experimental work, someone\'s doodlings/conjectures in a surviving 
journal, or maybe a manual describing possible weapons for a role playing
game that was still  being played during the ROM was found and
misinterpreted<G>.

   The formula is Size^2 * A * 10 for the total surface area, and
   Size^2 * A * (10-Hydro) for the land area.  Size is the UWP size
   factor, Hydro is the UWP hydrographics factor, and A = 314,000 sq.
   miles or 813,000 sq. kilometers.

   Example: Earth, E867977-7, has a land surface area of (8^2)*A*(10-7)
   = roughly 15.6 million square kilometers.  Obviously, the crude
   precission of the UWP will not yield answers to better than 10%
   accuracy, and usually not that good.  (I\'m not certain of the correct
   answer, but I believe it is closer to 14 million.)

   The percentage accuracy of your answer will be no better than
   (50%)*sqrt(4/Size^2 + 1/(10-Hydro)^2) for land area, and (100%)/Size
   for total area.  So the result for Earth is only good to about 42%.
   So you\'ll still have to wing it!

Earliest references I could find were to the design of the Notre Dame

As you can see, I haven\'t looked all of these up.  I\'m sure many of them do

looks:

0	572	9.681818		16	0

13	67	2.432836		3	2
14	12	1.916667		2	1

Again, these numbers are without Vland included, so these represent the
true function that was used to model the TL drop in generating the data. A
large number of worlds went to TL0, but the drop otherwise is remarkably
uniform. Here are the distributions at each era:

TL	M1100	M0	
0	3	572
1	15	40
2	27	84
3	42	179
4	100	326
5	190	459
6	277	521
7	389	598
8	500	600
9	582	560
10	584	405
11	576	343
12	570	202
13	405	67
14	300	12
15	341	0
16	66	0
17	1	0

Clearly, we just shifted the mean down, without changing the distribution
curve much.

If the technological superiority of the early 3I is to remain the driving
force behind the consolidation of known space, then something has to be
done...perhaps regenerate the sectors other than Core using a different
modifier for TL loss, or just by fiat, moving the TL 13-14 worlds to TL
11-12, and perhaps, the non-Core TL12 worlds down to 10 or 11. A few
oddball worlds can be retained here and there, but I wouldn\'t
have more than one TL14 world per sector, if that, and certainly not a
high poulation one.

The latter approach holds a fair amount of appeal to me, since that puts
the rest of known space close to, but not quite on par with the 3I, with
the widespread access to starflight that exists in the current M0, but the
3I has the TL12 edge over their competitors. This gives two benefits:

1)There is a reason for the outlying areas to want to join the 3I...access
to high technology, the carrot.

2)There is reason NOT to resist assimilation...the Imperial fleets are
superior technologically, the stick. This allows for much higher
populations in areas, and allows for a lot of pocket empires out there for
the Wars of Pacification to, well, pacify, and, to my view, giving a far
more rational picture of the political structure of the M0 known space
than a lame kludge like \'Maybe the 3I are the only ones who have the will
to have a large empire\'

This also gives a rational basis for the 3I taking so long to advance to
TL 13 and 14...they\'re really busy cranking out enough stuff to raise the
rest of the universe to their level, which will consume a lot of the
resources necessary for generally advancing tech beyond what they have.

Reddkneck Arms and Munitions (RAAM) is proud to announce a great line of
Kinetic Kill BB\'s "Bigshot tm" for those missiles. 

Are your local interstellar governments saying no to your request for equal
arms against those "evil" pirates and privateers. Are they saying that only
"they" can have the nukes for their missile warheads. 

Well we here a RAAM are present our new line of "non nuclear" kinetic kill
warheads. Guaranteed to have nary a stray rad of radiation, well almost
sure.<G>

Our Kinetic Kill BB\'s are made of only the finest quality Bonded Superdense
armor material available at any Tech Level. Making for a uniform projectile
of unsurpassed lethalness. But we go even further than that RAAM adds a
additional "secret" coating to insure maximum penetration and energy delivery.

Bighot tm is available in the standard RAAM page module sizes of .1m^3, 1
m^3 and 10 m^3. We will accept any customer custom sizes, and configurations.

Remember at Reddkneck Arms and Munitions (RAAM) if its a big battleship
RAAM it. 

Our motto is "Peace Through Superior Massive Overkill"

Reddkneck Arms and Munitions (RAAM) is located at Liberty Hall/Beyond, go
past the Spinward Marches, and just follow the glowing planets and cratered
starships. 

First time customers will receive a free whoopie cushion with the RAMM
logo, and purple and green Gimme hat with our Logo!!!

Example: a 12g missile traveling for 30 minutes before Bigshot releasing,
does damage/pen of 32 to any targets hit.

As to how many hits well that is something that will have to be worked on
for each system ie CT/MT/TNE/T4.

My idea right know is one hit per 100tons of hull displacement for a normal
success and two hits for every 100tons of hull displacement for outstanding
success.

What if the Old Earth Union is at TL13 at Year 0? Would that explain why
the Imperium stopped expansion towards Terra, and didn\'t integrate until
the 500s (IIRC)? They waited until they reached a similar TL? And it fits
with the ongoing progress discussion.

True, that\'s why I think that TL 14 should be reduced to TL 13, and also I
agree with the majority of folks here that Pop B worlds should be changed
to pop A.  Pop A/9 is 90 billion inhabitants, I can see that in one
system, but Pop B/9 is 900 billion people.  I don\'t like this, and it also
greatly conflicts with the data for 1100.  Eliminate Pop B and things look
a lot better.

Follow the link and get the full version of Marathon Infinity for $9.98.
It comes with the new map editor and manual. When I ordered it I expected a 
freebee version, just the CD-ROM. This looks like the retail version to me.

Now, If I could just get the time to work up a scenario using the Leviathan

Clearly?  In FFS (first printing) it\'s stated as Lb=V/100Tlm, which 
if calcualted in proper order from left to right, you get the 
appropriate barrel-length vs TL progression (note that the book uses 
a standard divide-by sign rather than the slash I used).  It could\'ve 
been more clearly stated, however.

there any doubt about what a character has or how much encumbrance 
should be applied to him, we just look at that section of the 
character\'s book and can see.

I also find that having these sheets helps characters envision their 
equipment better.  If you have a scanner, you can scan in pictures of 
the equipment in the space provided.

These sheets are all TNE format-for instance, if you have a gun, it\'s 
autofire adjustments for that character can be recorded in a special 
place on the back of the form.  No more figuring recoil for every 
shot!  Just do it once, and refer to the sheet.

These sheets will all be in Word v2.0.  Let me know if you want them. 
 I\'ll wait a week or so before I delete the ones I\'m going to.

You know, this looks *very* good to me.  In M 1110 the Imperium had a
maximum TL of 15, with a few TL 16 worlds.  In M 0 the Imperium (and
surrounding area) had a Maximum TL of 12 with a few TL 13 worlds.  This
makes sense to me.  By this logic, by M 300 around 300 worlds will be TL
13 and a few dozen will be TL 14, still sounds good. 

By this logic, the maximum TL of an era is defined by the maximum TL which
can be widely found in the Imperium.  In M 1110 this is 15, in M 0 this is
12. Worlds one TL higher exist, but they are very rare (1/6th as many TL D
worlds as TL C worlds in M0) and a number of these worlds are research
bases or experimental colonies. 

The TL 14 worlds in M0 do need to be reduced to TL 12 or 13, since 2 TLs
up is a bit much for this setting. 

Comments?

World Builder\'s Handbook gives:

G = M x (64/R^2)

where G = Gravity in standard gees (Terra=1)
     M = Planet\'s Mass
     R = UWP size digit (use 0.6 for S)



to get the Mass:

M = K x (R/8)^3

where:M = Mass in standard masses (Terra=1)
     K = Planet\'s Density
     R = UWP size digit (use 0.6 for S)




and to get the density you roll 3D on a table that ranges from 0.18 to
2.25.  (Terra =1)

A few alternatives:

Missile racks with high-explosive (ie TL7-8) missiles.
Large bore (short barrel) howitzers.
Mass drivers.
Machine gun arrays (sort of like flechette).

All of these weapons have the same problem - beyond very short range, hitting is basically impossible. Of 
course if you are more worried about the story than the physics, that shouldn\'t be too problematic. An 
"advantage" of the large bore howitzers and mass drivers is that they\'ll give the ship one hell of a kick when 
they fire.

The bullet from a .50 BMG round weighs around 50 grams (guess, based on
memory of the last time I handled one). At 3 km/sec it\'ll explode as if
it was a 50 gram charge of TNT. At 6 km/sec like a 200 gram charge, at
9 km/sec like a 450 gram charge. etc. Energy goes up with the square of
the velocity. 

So the trick is to be moving fast enough *towards* the other guy, fire
off a few hundred rounds (at several credits each!) and hope he runs
into them. The firing velocity is so low that you can ignore it. 

Given that 30 km/sec is not an uncommon relative velocity, that gives
the equivalent of a 5 kilo charge of TNT per hit. Of course you aren\'t
likely to get many.

It\'s reasonably easy to design a deployment method that will spread the
projectiles in a manner that approximates a flat disk. Assume equal
spacing at 1 BB per 100 sq m.

Narrow the spread and you increase the number of hits. But at 100 m^2
per BB, that\'s one in each 10x10 meter "square". That\'s gonna give
*more* than 1 hit per 100 dtons!

Having seen comments like this on several occasions, I\'d like to ask,
how many people have windows in starships in their games, and the
bridge in a vulnerable position?  Does it make a difference if the
ship is a military ship or a civilian ship?  What do your players
actually use the windows for?

Personally none of my ships have windows, and the bridge is located
right in the centre of the ship along with all the other important
sections.  As far as I\'m concerned, windows are just too delicate to
put on the hull of a ship.  The shuttle has already had a window
cracked due to a paint fleck in a retrograde orbit, how much damage
can you expect if a traveller ship encounters a speck of dust at roll
over on it\'s way between two planets.  Not to mention the liability
they are if it comes to hostile fire.  The only advantage I can see
for windows is the passengers actually get to look out a "real window"
and actually see the new planet, rather than just seeing it as a video
feed from a camera on the outside of the hull.

Is there anything I\'ve missed?  Am I wildly out on how much people are
going to be able to see through the windows?  Or have I missed the
point completely?

Data densities *now* are pretty amazing. Sure, we can\'t *practically*
use "1 atom = 1 bit" but we\'ve demonstrated that it is *possible*. My
*personal* "guess" for the max density is storing bits as spin states
in metallic hydrogen. That\'d give you 1/10th of Avogardo\'s Number per
cc.[1] Call it 2^200 bits per cc. That\'s a *lot* of storage.

Given likely data densities, I bet that they can just stuff more data
storage modules into the Xboat. Consider the bandwidth of a postal bag

What I want to know is just what they are using to *transmit* all this
data. Bandwidth starts getting *real* scarce at these data densities.
I\'d think it\'d be easier to tranship the data modules (remember that
postal bag?). And given privacyu concerns, I bet the link is
*physical*, say a few hundred optical fibers running at terabit rates.
that\'ll handle your "megaterabytes" in 9 hours or less. (assume 1
megaterabit of data, 1 terabit data rate, 256 parallel fibers, result
is 32768 seconds)

See above. At 9 *hours* to dump that one load over a cable,
broadcasting is right out.

If I can ever get data on the proposed HDTV standards I can work up
what the result would be as a type of "v-mail". Assuming 2048x2048x4
billion colors at 120 frames a second I get 848,000 *days* of such
video in 1 "megaterabit".

Assuming a 32-bit character set like unicode, each "frame" of that
video is around 800 pages of text. Assuming better than CD audio, I get
200,000 *days* of audio per frame.

No wonder mail is "free", and still pictures almost so.

If anybody has the CT Forms Supplement handy, give me the character
count for the message form and the pixel count for the "picture" form.
As well as the suggested prices.

Nope. A letter of marque and reprisal made you legal. As long as you
stuck to raiding vessels of the right nation, you got treated like a
navy ship would be. Officers imprisoned, possibly under parole, men
just imprisoned.

That\'s *why* letters of marque were so important. They kept you
(usually) from an appointment with the hangman.

They seem odd to us, but do recall that at the exact same time you
could outfit a regiment of troops and *purchase* a commision as a
colonel! So "privately owned warships" aren\'t so unusual.

During war, you\'d get tried for *violating* the letter of marque by
*either* side. So a smart man would be careful. Of course, he\'d also
staty away from anything he couldn\'t outfight (much easier in the days
of sail).

The enemy could ignore your letter of marque, but that risks two
things. First, they may have privateers out there and not want the same
done to them. Second, if they lose a fight to a warship and it\'s known
that they\'d hung privateers, they might at the very least get a lot
worse treatment than normal. 

In reality, you\'ll be "nice" to captured privateers in direct
proportion to the extent that you believe you or others on your side
could be hurt if you *weren\'t* "nice".

I\'m not  very clear with the Xboat network.

If those ship don\'t have maneuver drives, how can they land or approach
orbital startports to change crew, refuel or repair. I assume that the data
are transfered directly by communication devices at a range of nearly 100
diamerters. 

They jump in at 100 diameter with 0 speed, transfert data to a grounded or
orbital "post office" which will deliver mail after. Then wait that the
"post office" send new delivery, and store  all the data in their banks.
After the final acknoledge, the jumped to the next world.

Right?

Maybe there are other utility space ships which can refuel the Xboat or
change the crew or attached itseft to the xboat to carry it top the nearby
orbital station for repairing. 

But then, how can they be sure that they always be near 100 diameter of the
next world. How can they compensate the gravitationnal field which will
attracked them to every world. their speed will always increase toward
inside of 100 diameter. So when they\'ll be inside 100 diameter the jumps
would be much more dangerous.

Further more it\'s quite impossible to follow orbits (even far ones) when
you constantly change the G-field by jumping in another system.

Could anyone explain me why the Xboat don\'t have any maneuver drives even a
0.05G just to correct the low speed of the ship and stay on stable orbit?

  Just change that to "engineers" and we\'ll let you slide - scientists had
nothing to do with it.  Sorry if we came on a bit strong, but I\'m sure
you\'d react the same way if I told you that Basic was the standard
Imperial programming language (well, maybe for Vilani computers...).

  Sorry, sorry, sorry - I didn\'t mean to come across so strongly.  You
just happened to put one of my chains as far as research goes - as I said
my students are getting way guilty in terms of using computer searches,
esp. the Web, as their only resource.  

  Another list member mailed me privately to tell me about a student in
his department who failed her Ph.D. exams by using only the
computer-searchable part of Medline.  The committee fried her by bringing
up some key articles from the 1950s she had not heard of until that
moment, and could have found easily if she had used a more comprehensive
method to search.  I just wish your sceptical attitude toward the Web was
more widely shared. 

  Moreover, you are absolutely right about saying that you made clear that
you did not view your search as comprehensive - re-reading your posts made
that clear to me.  I really need to put the word "perhaps" in my posts
more often, as in "Perhaps you relied on the Web too much for your
information."

  I also agree the Web is a great resource for those who do not have a big
honking university library at close hand - I have become so used to that
by now that I forget how limited many local public libraries are.  I hope
the Web develops over the next few years into an even more comprehensive
source of information - it will do us all a world of good to have such a
potentially democratic source of information.

  That\'s one of the reasons I find this list so fascinating - I have a BA
in Mechanical Engineering, two years of college physics, a year of
chemistry, and no biology since the 9th grade.  The stuff that comes up
here, and the highly educated people who make things known to me in an
understandable way, are a real source of delight (not to mention things
like "foot-long prehensile clitoris," words I\'d never thought I\'d see on
the Traveller Mailing List), and have helped educate me about a variety of
things.

  I\'m sorry to hear that you have not had a chance to read any history of
technology - there are some interesting things out there, especially in
the field of computing.  Feel free to ask if there are any topics you are
interested in - I\'ll be happy to reccomend where to start (that goes for
anyone on this list, by the way).

I\'m looking at the forms but not certain whether you want the physcial

The off course you can buy marbles, leadballs or whatever at much less than

Well, I don\'t know if we need to exactly specify the mechanism, but 
it\'s sufficient to say that XBoats will probably have really, really
high data densities.

Hm, I suppose, but it\'s not exactly the kind of thing you\'d want
to run telnet over... now, the cool thing would be trying to design
a database replication strategy for this kind of setup (well, cool
if you\'re into database replication strategies I suppose).

Ah yes, classic networks course question... what\'s the bandwidth of

But you\'d still have to get the data to the XBoat tender...

Nicolas Lejeune asked why Xboats have no maneuver drives, even
for stationkeeping in orbit. It\'s because Xboats in the Sol system
(for example) never get closer than Saturn or Jupiter - they jump
into a piece of space more than 100 diameters away from anything,
then they jump back out once they\'ve done their work. There are 
large XBoat tender ships that hook up, refuel the Xboat, d/load
the incoming information, u/load the outgoing information, back
off and send the XBoat on its way. Being an Xboat pilot is 
probably not the funnest job in the world... (How about a new
career: Space Trucker?)

As for physical link versus transmitted link, given that they have to
hook up to pump fuel, a physical link is possible, but the alternative,
the mystical "meson communicator" may have higher bandwidth than
the sort of EM-based comms we use today.

Well, it probably takes a few hours to re-fuel the XBoat, so 9 hours
for data transfer is probably more than quick enough. LHyd 
bandwidth may be lower than OC-8bajillion bandwidth.

The real problem isn\'t so much getting the data on and off the XBoat,
it\'s getting it on and off the tender... the tender probably has
several tight-beam meson comms running 24/7 just to keep up with
the data load. Or maybe there\'s big data storage missles being fired
back and forth all day long... that might make XBoat tenders pretty
dangerous places! (Sir! 20 data missles incoming and the tractors 
are out!)

They probably charge a certain amount just to discourage

The funny thing is that the idea of XBoats pre-dates (IRL) the

I can subscribe to this argument - personally, I\'d put a little more
emphasis on some Vargr being present in Corridor, Deneb etc. but not as
many as I first argued for.

IMO it\'s a very valid interpretation of what canon should be... you\'ve won

Yeah, maybe a _very_ short range defense. But if a ship with is power plant
down uses guns to kill the boarding team, I were the captain of the
boarding ship I would blow them immediatly. For the boarded crew, it\'s way
much interesting to capture the boarding team (if they can!) to get hostages. 

I still wouldn\'t use MG or other slug weapons on starships except if I want
to have ground and cheap attack capacity. For example a pirate who want to
attack low TL areas. On every all cases (known to me) Lasers are much more
efficient

Hmm, I understand your opinion about the (un)need of windows and the risk
of them. In my personnal case I assume that there are some materials which
are sufficiently strong to be used as Hull plating. For example 1 cm of
Superdense would be equivalent to 5cm (or 10cm) or transparent material. 
As the usefulness of windows, I agree that they\'re not necessary especially
with the accurate sensors. Personnaly I use windows but small one (like
those on wet ships). This is more a question of comfort than need. During
combat there is a mecanical device which can obscured the window with an
plate of Hull plating.

The question is in Jump space. Personnaly, the window have to be closed, or
maybe it\'s more fun to have wierd lights and flashes. Hmmm, maybe I\'ll keep
the second solution, sound more sexy. than just dark and cold ;-)

Cleon II abdicated in 54 and went to play on the Frontier.
Artemsus ruled from 54 to 166.

Just checked TD18. There is a reference to the Easter Concord/Solomani Rim
joining the Imperium in 426, bringing it \'one step closer\' to Terra.
(Having been a client state since 305 S&A p24). This doesn\'t necessarily
mean the above is wrong. The Imperium would only recently have reached TL13
and so had not necessarily got the size or technology advantage (at that
point) to annexe Terra as it does in 588.

Now, S&A does mention the Terran Mercantile Community collapsing to a
smaller area and becoming the Old Earth Union in -1110 but it only mentions
the economic down turn. This doesn\'t mean that the technology development
stoppeded (IMO). It may only have slowed.

Now, whether Terra was forceably annexed or merged happily depends on the
source you are reading...

Which raises another question.  Unless I*ve just been eating too many of =
the Commander*s cookies, it looks like there*s there a pretty serious =
disconnect when it comes to converting EA armor values to starship armor =
values.  I*m not talking about the price discrepancy, I*m talking about =
the defensive value of the armor against weapons.

For example, using superdense (toughness 11), 20 cm thick armor gives a =
vehicle armor value of 30 (rounding up) which converts on the above table =
to a starship armor value of 4.  However, SSDS values the same 20 cm of =
armor at 10.  Similarly: 40 cm results in a VDS starship armor of 7 and a =
SSDS starship armor of 20; 80 cm results in a VDS starship armor of 9 and =
a SSDS starship armor of 30.

The problem becomes compounded by the fact that for different materials =
have the same armor values in SSDS, but different armor values in EA*s =
VDS.

EA is a great book and I realize the two are two different systems, but in =
EA Greg Porter specifically states that  *the above conversion can be used =
to get the starship equivalent rating of ground vehicles*.

Along a similar vein, we*re trying to figure out why a TL 15 10-ton =
fighter would mount a relatively weak laser from SSDS rather than a light =
plasma cannon from EA.  The above damage conversion table makes the plasma =
cannon much better=21

Any suggestions?

    'body' => 'Hey all. I just had an interesting idea, but I need some more info to
flesh it out.

	Here\'s the basic concept:

	The reciever in self loading small arms - gauss and otherwise - recoils
against a stiff spring to absorb some of the recoil force and return the
reciever to the firing position, loading a fresh round in the process.

	On heavier weapons, a recoil carriage is included, which uses hydraulic
cylinders to take more of the recoil force, so that it\'s effect on the
vehicle is negligible/managable.

	So, why not encase the reciever of small arms in a modified gauss
barrel? This will accelerate the reciever to the front of the weapon, in
effect acting as a set of brakes. The timing sequence could be worked
out so that it only decelerates the reciever, not accelerate it against
the barrel assembly.

	If recoil is only felt after the spring in a normal reciever has
collapsed / been compressed to a certain point, this could have a
drastic effect on felt recoil.

	Now for the hard part: how do we work this into a design sequence?

	My first inclination is to choose a compensator energy, take half the
mass of an autoloader for the projectile in question, work backwards
through the muzzle energy equation, and install an appropriate gauss
barrel and required accumulators, with weight multipliers for the chosen
ROF.

	Example: A 4mm gauss weapon is designed with a muzzle energy of 3000J
at TL12. A compensator is desired to compensate 2500J of that muzzle
energy. Since the gauss bullet masses 1.05 grams, the autoloader mass
would be 31.5 grams. Half of that is 15.75 grams. Working backward
through the muzzle energy equation, we get a velocity of 563.44 mps,
giving a gauss barrel length of 5.63cm. An accumulator for 5000J is
required, massing 0.5 kg. 

	The recoil would then be calculated based on the difference between the
actual muzzle energy and the compensated energy - in this case, 500J. 

	Now, I know this is munchkin. I can\'t help it - it\'s in my blood. I
just like really wicked designs and all. The question is, would this
work, and what limits are there on this type of compensation?

	One last thing: I don\'t think this will add any length to the weapon,
but battery power would be required to pwer the compensator as well.

They\'re called X-Boat tenders...sort of like SDB\'s in that they have big
maneuver drives, and no jump drives, but with lots of databanks similar to
what are on the X-boat itself, and big fuel tanks. They go out and meet an
X-boat when it pops into a system, down/upload data, refuel and resupply
the X-boat and ...blammo...the X-boat\'s off again. I suspect that there
are spare X-boats in heavily trafficked systems to provide spares if
necessary.

This vaguely recollected from CT Book 6(?) Scouts...I can re-read it when
I get home.

Uhhh, no...the fooundations for the Internet were laid in the 60\'s and
IIRC, the first ARPAnet was running by \'72. Then again, we hada telephone
network starting in the late 1800\'s and Telegraph networks in the MID
1800\'s.

And the X-boat network is far more analogous to mail trains and ships than
data networks. My reference to it being a \'packet\' network was said half
in jest...yes the \'63 station wagon full of DAT tape has got bandwidth
like you wouldn\'t believe...just a real slow transmission
rate...especially if you hit a coast ;-)

But this illustrates, on a level that many of us can start to understand,
just exactly HOW much like the 18th century the Trav universe is...when
there\'s weeks or months of lag time between sender and reciever, any even
remotely centralized system cannot function. Who knows, with the massive
decentralization of wide area enterprises mandated by this fundamental
limit of communication, there may well NOT be a whole lot of data to be
sent back and forth from the main to the branch offices.

Depends on the campaign.  In CT, I used \'em because I didn\'t know better,
tho\' towards the end I was designing them out.  In MT, generally I only
put in windows for specific reasons, none of the control spaces relied on
them.

In TNE, however, windows in control spaces became a design \'feature\'.
After Virus, who is going to depend totally on electronic feeds for
starship maneuvering.  A pilot may use the electronic information for all
his maneuvering data, but there at least with a window to eyeball confirm
what the instruments are telling him (or her or it), the pilot doesn\'t
have to worry about being guided into a mountain!

I have not really started to design for T4, so that is not yet an issue.

Use diamond sheets for your viewpanes.  If it can punch through that, it
will come through the hull anyway.  Maybe with armored panels (ala
\'Seaview\') to close in case of radiation hazards.

In convenient Traveller units, the formula is:

  G = d * S / 8

where

  G = surface gravity, Terra = 1
  d = planetary density, Terra = 1
  S = UPP size digit, Terra = 8

Terra\'s not really exactly 8,000 miles in diameter, but the error is less
than 10%.

Planetary densities for rocky worlds typically should run from around 0.7
to perhaps 1.2, with larger worlds probably tending to have higher
densities.

Well I had some players that had installed some custom options. The ship
that they owned had main corridor that did a 90 degree bend into a U shaped
section. This left one wall facing down the main corridor. That wall had a
very decorative wall art on it. Actually the wall art was a plastic
explosive base with metal and ceramic fletchettes set on top of it.
Translation a very large "claymore" mine with the direction "Face" down the
main corridor. They only had to use it once when "pirates" were boarding.
Net result no alive pirates on their ship. Flechettes make it very hard to
patch vacc suite holes in a vaccum. Also the all of the fixtures in the
main corridor were built to take the blast and fletchettes.

Yes and no.  There is a X-boat tender which picks up and services the
X-boats after they jump into the system.  The pilots are given time off to
recover before being sent on the next jump.

Which is why the Scouts used to be a popular way of getting rid of
charactors that the players were not satisfied with, but not tee of the GM

Actually, the explanation is pretty simple.

I can\'t say that "disapproved of" is the right term.  I think most people
on the TML would *like* to use 3D starmaps, all other things being equal.
Unfortunately, all other things aren\'t equal.  3D maps have two inherent
disadvantages:

(1) Moving to them now would invalidate 20 years of Traveller canon --
    this isn\'t a problem if you\'re creating your own background, of
    course.

(2) Creating and using 3D maps is very difficult.  Using flat maps, it\'s
    impossible to glance at a region and determine where star systems
    really are relative to one another.  Showing \'true\' relationships
    requires a computer display system a la VRML, or building a physical
    three-dimensional model.  Either is costly and inconvenient.

2300 AD and SPI\'s Star Force are the only (relatively) successful games I
know of which have attempted to portray 3D star relationships.  Both used
flat maps with numerical Z-axis information, with SF adding supplementary
color-coding.  Neither was especially easy to work with.  Trying to map
the much larger volume of Traveller known space in the same way would be
*very* difficult.

iJust a quick reminder - NOTHING in Start Trek
is remotely viable! The Enterprise had this great,
fancy holodeck, but did it have a REAR VIERW MIRROR??
NO!

The holotank idea is much, much better then the
"forward viewscreen". It allows the Captian and
crew to see the ship and it\'s surroundings in 
a full spherical field of view.

IIRC, there were actual Star Trek episodes where
the major plot element was that the Enterprise
couldn\'t see what was happening behind it! Sheesh!

SOM also uses the holotank idea, I believe.

	It will be possible at high tech levels (possibly as low as

would be just as hard as the rest of the hull.  One such Traveller
material might be Crystaliron.   In fact, in my games, starships made

My ships always have a least a few windows.. If they are designed for
rentry, the pilot at least needs to see where he\'s going, because the Mk 1
eyeball is always the sensor of last resort.  Airlocks will have viewports
in the inner and outer doors to allow spacers to inspect the next area for
any hazards before continuing to cycle through.  Passenger/crew cabins make
do with view screens.

The IISS maintains a fleet of 1000-ton tenders.

That\'s it.  They also send a message to the X-boat(s) waiting at the
100-diameter limit, so that they can jump almost immediately.  A tender
then comes out to refuel/resupply the X-boat, possibly replaceing the pilot.

Since the boats need to be tended before they can jump again, this isn\'t as
bad a problem as you might think.  Each boat contains the best in
navigation computers and the most recent updates from the IISS on
coordinates, so the chance of mis-jump is small.

This is summarised as much as possible and focussed to be relevant to the
M0 (0 to 400ish)

Antiquity (Corridor 0806 A223420-C): One of the best preserved Ancient
sites in existence. Discovered in 385, the site is unique in that many
parts of it are still operational.Note that this would be a good site for
the R(n) remark....

Khukish (1606) Vilani world, founded long before 3I, based on exploitation
of sea life, tech level F, pop 9 in 1120, described as \'old subsector
capital\'
Shishkala (1607) described as \'agricultural partner world\' to Khukish, so
may be colonised in FS.

Plunge (2405) settled underground caverns \'five centuries\' ago. Maybe a
little late for FS.

Kaasu (1209) - home of Corridor Chronicles (founded 183) reached TL 16 by
1120, settled by Vilani miners.Mentioned as sector capital until occupation
by Vargr in 1119.

Depot (1511) surveyed by HA Enders (maverick interstellar explorer) in
first century of Imperium and passed over in favour of more easily
developed worlds. Settled by navy to protect the Spinward expansion early
on. Star named after Enders.

Neghu Oug (2804) - settled by Vargr and has a large aquatic mammal native
called Ojehshodu. These are sentient, but didn\'t object to Vargr
occupation. In 972 it is suggested, but never proven, that they psionically
manipulate and control the Vargr govt.

Tarin Sink (1432) colonised in late 300s by nine extended families. Later
on Imperium placed research facility - eventually RS epsilon, clearing
house for unexplained phenomena. Isolated in Great Rift.

Sashrakusha (3131) site of nonhuman minor race Xapoqi who are very long
lived nd live off UV radiation, also nearly imobile. Only realised they are
sentient in 700s through use of NAS scanners. Initially surveyed in first
Imperium.

That\'s all the references I can find at the moment. Hope it helps...

How about a few more details Leonard and Sinbad;

At what range (from the target ship) does the warhead have to "deploy"?

Once a missile deploys, how easy at 2g can a ship get out of the
"footprint"?

How about 3g? 4g? 6g? 9g?

How easy is it to hit/destroy the carrying missile before deployment?

To what extent are ships armored against "debris" in space which closely
approximates the kinetic energy of a single BB?

Could the BBs be "stealthed" against standard PEMS and AEMS sensors?  If
so, what is the *maximum* range that the bbs could be deployed and keep
their "footprint"?

I remain (at this point) unconvinced after all the debate (a long time ago
now) about bb warheads that starships are susceptible to such warheads.
Then again, I don\'t think impact missiles should work either, but suspend 
disbelief in favor of game mechanics.

Convince me.

Actually, I believe the best source is Supplement 7: Traders and Gunboats. 
It gives a good description of the X-Boat procedures and has deckplans of 
the tenders.

Well, I\'m only partway into it, but I\'ll bite anyway.

#1 - This book is not in any way I have found or heard of, basically
flawed the way both Starships and First Survey turned out to be.

#2 - What I have read is well written, clear, and interesting.

#3 - ITS SOLO PLAYABLE!  What the book seems to contain (and I\'m only a
smidge into it, again) is an independent, background creating game with
the T4 task system and background as a basis.  The "players" are family
members of an individual empire which has an Economic, Military, and
Social identity that develops over time (in turns measured in years and
decades) and as planets are added to the empire.

A friend of mine ran a game once which was a turn based empire building
game.  We started with a certain group of planets which had a productive
value, a bunch of ships, and a few colorful generals and administrators.
This is (I think) just like that game.  In fact, it is similar to the game
"Stellar Conquest" except that the latter was played on a board with a few
other players involved.  I can see this being played the same way.

Since there are Traveller hulls with fields to strengthen the bonding

Which one?

Back to Traveller: in CT, the Far Trader has a bridge window.
There is also a window in the captain\'s cabin. Both, judging from
the deck plans, are treated as bulkheads.

Not likely. The Vilani _brought_ jump drive to the Vegans, so it is
unlikely they had an interstellar empire. There has never been mention of
sublight interstellar journeys by the Vegans either.

 THe formula for the surface area of a sphere (a close enough
 approximation to the shape of a planet) is 4 * pi * radius^2.

 pi is the famous constant, 3.1415926535+.

 radius (in miles) is (size-code * 1000)/2.

 4 is 2^2.

 So, given the size code, the surface area in square miles is
 1,000,000 * size-code * size-code * pi.

 Using Earth as an example (size 8), the surface area is roughly
 64,000,000 (8 * 8 * 1,000,000) * pi, or 201,061,930 square
 miles.

 Now, some of that is covered by water; you may want to adjust
 for that, so _land_area_ = surface area * (10 - hydro code) / 10.

 Again, using Earth as an example (hydro 7), the land area is
 200,000,000 * (10 - 7) / 10, or 200,000,000 * 0.3, or
 60,000,000 square miles.

 This could theoretically be refined by using more accurate
 figures for size and hydro (i.e., not just one digit), and also
 by adjusting for the area of the continental shelves, which
 should be easily if not trivially exploitable by the time a
 society has reached TL9 or A.  I don\'t know if there are any
 formulae or rules of thumb for figuring how much of the
 hydrosphere is really shelf space.  Eyeballing a couple of maps
 I have suggests that the shelf area is about half the land
 area, but my eyeball is notorious for screwing up those kinds
 of estimates.

qualifications here in the UK were changing in a way he didn\'t like -
shorter apprenticeships, less teaching on the \'why\' something works, and
more abstract testing.

(One of the examples he gave was in car maintenance - previously, to
qualify you had to reach a standard set by the course instructors, now it\'s
a central set test. (ForEx spray painting damage to a car. Now, spray a 1m
SQ flat panel perfectly. Then, spray and repair real damage and curves.)
Often with funding cutbacks the tests are all that is taught, so the
standards are slipping. I see it at work with the newly qualified
apprentices having to be retaught by the senior craftsmen.

At the same time, numbers of applicants to science and engineering are
falling, as students realise that they can get better pay doing an arts
course that is possibly easier (as an engineer I\'m biased) and certainly
less intensive (6-7 hours contact to 30-40 hours week). Many of the
remaining places are taken by overseas students (which I am not knocking at
all).

Technology becomes more of a black box, and people capable of handling it
are fewer and fewer in number.

Is this a slippery slope to stagnation, a dropping in understanding and
standards? Are we now becoming a culture not unlike the Vilani? I can
remember getting reactions not unlike those mentioned in reference to the
researcher class when I told some people I was doing engineering (proof
that I\'m strange to them!).

Just a black thought.

Why would this prevent the Vegans from having an interstellar empire in
M0?? This is, after all, over 2000 years after the Vegans had been freed
from the stifling hand of their Vilani overlords...(There, did I sound
enough like a Solomani Party member? ;-)

The Vegans, with their long lifespans, would even have an advantage when
it came to waiting out long declines like the Long Night. 

Though saying it like this really drives home how long it really
was...Cleon claiming to be the heir of the First Imperium is along the
lines of someone taking over Earth and claiming to be the new Caesar.

	Surely it follows that thousands of years in the future they will come up
with some compound that will allow windows on ships.

	Put it this way...I don\'t know when glass and then windows were invented,
but as of today we can produce bullet proof glass that can stop a lot of
stuff, I don\'t know to what degree. But if today\'s glass can stop almost
anything that was around when glass was first invented, then couldn\'t glass
in the future concievably stand up to all that is required of it too? And
who knows if transparent metal can\'t be invented by then too? Or maybe I\'m
just rambling!

	See ya...

This is another error to be corrected in FS. The only TL-H world in the Third 
Imperium was Sambiquys, a world controlled by Xenophobic TL-H robots. The 
Original inhabitants of the world had died out at the beginning of the expansion of 
the First Imperium, and the Robots were left to maintain the planet. Though they 
wern\'t innovative enough to keep developing their technological base, the nature of 
TL-H equipment meant that they were able to maintain themselves and their 
civilization up until (at least) the fall of the Third Imperium.

This system should be TL-H in year 0, but with a note explaining it\'s background.

Hmm, during design you could ensure that at least half your contra-grav 
units can be shut down for repairs while the other half allow the ship to 
stay at hover.  It could be set up so that the ship could be emptied of 
cargo or sub-craft in order for it to work.  A set of low power tractor 
beams could be used to hold the ship in place, or even good old fashioned 
cables tied off to a natural feature.  You could even use the ships weight
to drive big stakes into the ground if nothing else is available.

I could see starships docked to flying cities complete with gangplanks 
laid down.  The ships contra grav allows it to stay level with the city
docks and tractor beams hold it in place.  This could be much more
acceptable
to the city managers, since more ships could dock with the city due to 
the decreased power plant size needed to keep everything up in the air.

Just one of those fleeting thoughts.

    'body' => 'I have recently reread M0 and FS, and the data there are terribly
inconsistent.  (No reflection on the M0 authors - they had the data they
intended to use yanked out from under them.)  In order to make this all
work, I have come up with the following proposals for pocket empires in the
M0 era.  These pocket empires use the names in M0, and are thus going to
have to be agreed on, at least tacitly, by Marc and IG.

*  Interstellar war cannot easily take place if the vessels are too far
from maintenance and resupply.  The guideline in Pocket Empires indicates
that going more than three jumps from your border is a bad idea.  I am
willing to accept strategic staging bases, but they had best have a full
Naval base, a decent port, and decent tech levels to support a fleet of any
size, so no colonizing efforts beyond that.

*  Colonizing worlds is difficult to begin with, and having to jump far
makes it worse.  Colonies are far more likely on a world on a J1 main, with
a J2 hop on a main a distant second, and a jump off the main a far, far
distant third.  Crews do not like jumping to interstellar space.

*  The Sylean federation grew primarily with the Risk strategy of the
Crusty Marshmallow.  To expand in this way, first send a bunch of scouts
through an area.  They will find the physical stats of any world they see.
Then, colonize or coopt as you have to.  Since you cannot support anyone
more than a jump 9 away, you are not likely to have many colonies in such a
position.  The important exception to this is the jump 3 route to Vland,
which I am making more important due to the AAB branches common in Vland.
(I know they are common in Core too, but a few strokes of the pen can fix
that.)

*  In order to explain the long night, I am assuming that jump drives are
finicky, and very sensitive to dust, radiation, and other bad things in a
system.  If your ship does not have an accurate set of charts, or
scout-grade sensors, you are running a grave risk with each jump.  Thus,
the reason why many worlds did not start their own Pocket Empires was a
simple matter of economics - at a tech level below about 12, the scouts
needed to do the surveys to keep your system connected were very expensive.
 This also means that having a permanent presence in a system is really
important - this is where up to date charts are bought by non scouts.  As a
result, it is very easy for a culture to get to the point where it does not
have jump travel.

*  Jump 1 ships are common enough in Y0 that there will likely not be more
than one political entity with jump travel in a cluster of worlds.
Clusters are also important economically, as it makes trade easier, so PEs
often comprise one cluster, plus as many worlds along the surrounding mains
as the home world thinks it can defend.

*  Along a main, you might not go farther than one jump from the important
world of the entity, and military power beyond 3 jumps is unlikely, so
there will be a lot of PEs along mains, all based on high pop or high tech
worlds, and encompassing a single jump or perhaps one or two jumps to
either side of the important world.

*  No ruler in his right mind wants to have an enemy base within a single
jump of his seat of power.  This is a situation that cannot be allowed to
continue.  If such a thing is on the map, then we need a reason why.
Example, Sylea is just too close to both Shaak and Ase for them to remain
independent.  I explain this with Shudusham - were Sylea to move militarily
on them without a previous attack, Shududsham would have a hissy fit.
Diplomatic means, OTOH, are quite acceptable, and once the Imperium was
officially begun, Sylea lost many constraints on its behavior.

*  All worlds within one jump of a high tech, high pop world are going to
be under the direct or indirect control of that world.

*  Every world that is either high tech or high pop is going to be important.

What follows is a list of all the high tech or high pop worlds in core.
The sheer number is a bit disturbing.

Mark,

I have been to the url that you have listed, I get message saying that I
need to download a frame capable browser like MS Explorer 3.0. I use
Netscape 3.0, I have used frames on other url\'s successfully ,,,,,what\'s up?

Well that will depend upon the launching platforms(missile) closing speed,
the speed of the target, and the pattern size needed to insure optimal hit
chance.

Well ok lets keep it simple then, 
the missile is detected by the target ship at a range of 100,000km 
the target is unarmed so has to evade the missile/Bigshot pattern
Both the missile and the target ship have been travelling at max
acceleration for two turns(60 minutes)
the missiles max acceleration is 12 g\'s giving it a velocity of 1,555,200kph
the target ship has max acceleration of 2 g\'s giving it a velocity of
259,200kph.
the missile will close to you last detected position in 0.23 seconds in
that time the target ship will able to travel 16,671 meters. That means
that your ship could be inside of projected cone narrow end at the last
detected point, wide end at the end. All the missile has to do is fire a
pattern of say 1,814,953 Bigshots into 19,178 meter radius "flat disk\',
giving a Bigshot density of one shot every 2,000 square meters or one every
25.2 meters in a square. 
Will that hit the target ship if it is larger than 1000 tons yes, less
better than a 70 percent chance. If it hits is will have a damage/pen value
of 44 or a USP of 8.
 
>How about 3g? 4g? 6g? 9g?

The missile will have to adjust the pattern to cover the different
accelerations.

>How easy is it to hit/destroy the carrying missile before deployment?

Normal missiles very easy under normal rules/situations, but I don\'t make
"Normal" missiles, mine are armored against point defense fire.

>To what extent are ships armored against "debris" in space which closely
>approximates the kinetic energy of a single BB?

Most ships would not be armored against a 44/USP of 8.

>Could the BBs be "stealthed" against standard PEMS and AEMS sensors?  If

>their "footprint"?

Why there would be over 100,000+ Bigshots, each only 1 cm in diameter, what
is the minimum resolution of the scanning sensors? Bigshot pattern
dispersal rate is controlled at time of launch, what ever is needed can be
done. After launch shooting at the Bigshots with a laser would be
laughable. But using a nuclear warhead to blow a hole in the pattern would
work, if it can be delivered in time.

The Bigshots may not damage some ships but they will at least "scuff the
paint job", damaging heat radiators, sensors arrays, etc and making the
crews wet their vacc suites. A sensor blind or impaired starship is not a
threat to moving sensor equipped starships.

>Convince me.

Wait for RAAM\'s "Bubba" and "Little Bubba" missile/torpedo, coming soon,
available in "cannonite" and "herectic" versions.

    Please don\'t, this is a legitimate subject for Traveller discussion!  Most
certainly it has more application then .1 c rocks and the like. ;)

    I must admit I favor the contention that the Dark Ages were a time of
explosive technological growth.  The problem we ALL have is that the mindset of
the times in fairly Alien to all of us.  We dismiss the whole bit about numbers
of angels dancing on the head of a pin.  But that was as relevant in it\'s time
to those people as our understandings of Relativity, Cosmology and Quantum
physics are to us now.  Doubtless a thousand years from now there will be
scholars having a hard time getting into Our mindset on such subjects because
they are irrelevant to Their body of knowledge. ;)
    Mindset IS extremely important to technological advancement, as is NEED.
You don\'t try to figure out new ways of doing things unless you Need to.
Necessity IS the mother of invention after all.  And in the "Dark Ages" there
was a great many Needs driving them.  Just as the commercial necessities of our
times drives us to continue to advance.

    This all has a bearing on why it takes so frigging long to raise Tech
Levels in the Imperium you know.  My own pet theory is that it\'s a combination
of the conservative Vilani mindset (the vast majority of the Imperium
population is Vilani or Vilani influenced) the lure of the frontier/space (it\'s
harder to advance when your best and brightest minds are leaving University to
go off adventuring amongst the stars) Interstellar Trade (why try to reinvent
the wheel if someone else has already invented it and you can license their
version) the glacial slowness of communications (ever notice that the pace of
inovation and technological advancement increases as the speed of communication
does) and cultural inertia (the Imperium, in either Mileu 0 or 1100+ never
struck me as being a terribly inovative place.)
    All these things together mean that the Imperium, in whatever Mileu, is not
terribly concerned about developing new technology.  Now this makes sense from
a Governmental POV, new tech has this terribly side effect of undermining
governmental authority.  Look at the impact that broadcast and fax technology
had on the Soviet block, in China and elsewhere.  Look at the headaches
encryption technologies are causing law enforcement, or the internet for the
courts.  With examples like these is it any wonder that a government would be
neutral at best to explosive technological growth and advancement?
    But that just MY pet theory, I\'m certain other people have other theories,
let\'s hear them. ;)

You can use a pseudo perspective drawing of the stars with lines to the
"ground plane". This makes it fairly easy to see what stars are close to
others but as it is still hard for maps with lots of stars per map.

endure without changing structure.  Anyone else remember this?

How do I put this simply?

Buy this immediately.  Camp in front of your gamestore, if necessary.  This
is one of the best products for Traveller since The Traveller Adventure.
It\'s both a stand-alone game and an aid to Referees building their own M:0
universe.

This page refuses to believe that my copy of Netscape Navigator 3 is
frames-capable.  Did you test it with Netscape?  Or just MSIE?  To be
honest, I have neither the disk space or patience to wrestle with two

Yes, they got Jump from the Vilani, but during the first Imperium.
They formed a fairly decent interstellar empire (albeit a small one)
during the long night. The 3rd Imperiums policy of disallowing
multi-system governments eventually led to the forced breakup of
the Vegan empire into the "Vegan Autonomous District", or perhaps
that was after the Solomani Rim war... anyways, the Vegans had
a decent Empire, though I doubt they were much of a threat to the 
expanding 3I.

plentiful (compared to other starships).  As such, the RC came up with the 
Multi-Mission Scout (a modified Scout with a 20-ton module in its belly).  
However, the RC started phasing these out in favor of the Victrix-class 
Multi-Mission Sloops.  One might wonder what is to be done with these 
surplus Scouts...  

Using the TNE core rules as written, when a character or group of 
characters uses their ship DMs and gets a result of "-16" (16 value 
modifiers) or better, they are *guaranteed* a ship *free-and-clear* 
(i.e., *no* payments), specifically, a Scout ship.  Here\'s how...  

  1) One of the value modifiers is taken as the Wear Value, as all ships 
    have a Wear Value of 1+.  

  2) The other value modifiers are taken as "-DM" on the Ship Type Table, 
    resulting in a *very* negative number (a roll of 2D6-15, for example).  

  3) Results of "-2" or below on the Ship Type Table result in a "Scout" 
    or a "Modified Scout," depending on the column used.  

In _The_Guilded_Lilly_, the last page mentions that the RC will strongly 
consider the tactic of subsidized ship ownership as a means of generating 
interstellar commerce.  Based on my analysis above of the Starship Tables, 
an argument could be made that the RC *already* has such a policy...  

With this in mind, I\'d like to present my versions of the modified Scouts 
that are so readily available in the Reformation Coalition.  All of these 
Scouts have a Tech Level of "12/15."  This is because the TL-15 (bonded 
superdense) hull was emptied of its TL-15 components, and refilled with 
TL-12 components.  The salvagable TL-15 components were then used in more 
important RC Navy vessels.  

These three Scout variants are: 

  The _Tramp_-Class Scout/Trader 
    (received from the Trader column); 

  The _Alchemist_-Class Scout/Lab Ship 
    (received from the Lab Ship column); 

  And, the _Ronin_-Class Scout/Escort

all sneaky and went UP instead of left and right to defeat
2-D supergenius Khan. Much like that odd habit all Star Trek
ships have of all sharing the same magical "up vector", so
they\'re always facing each other straight & square on.

The specific episode I was thinking of was the one with the
giant space-fish or whatever they were... the Enterprise finds
dead, pregnant space fish, uses its phasers to perform a
quick C-section, releases the baby and says "Good! Well, we\'re off"
and goes on it\'s merry way. Mere moments later, the Enterprise
shakes and the whole crew goes "Woah - what was that??" not
realizing that the baby fish had snuck up and stuck itself
to the backside of the Enterprise.

That\'s some security system the Enterprise has got.

Anyways, oddly enough, the Enterprise, in one of the movies,
has a few windows, and they way they\'re set up is that there\'s 
a tiny little room with a pressure sealed door for each window...
they\'re like little viewing rooms out to space. (I think this was
the old Enterprise, not the Next Gen one, which obviously had
big windows just about everywhere). That\'s probably a not-too-bad
model for Trav ships - a sealed, small viewing area for those who 
need to focus their eyes on something very, very, very far away
for a little while.

PE is one of the better gaming products I\'ve bought in the last few years.
It works on many levels as a development tool for Traveller, a solo game,
and political intrigue game set in a single Empire, a game of expansion
among several PEs, and is perfect for PBM/PBEM.

This is a must buy.  It uis one of Traveller products that will enhance
your game no matter what Millieu or setting you play in.

As for Starports, PE does include rules for upgrading starports.  Costs are
in Resources Units (RU).

X to E  Free    1 year
E to D  1.2 RU  2 years
D to C  120 RU  10 years
C to B  600 RU  20 years
B to A  2400 RU 30 years

So you can see that building a lower class port is fairly cheap and easy,
but upgrades can be a bitch.

You\'ll probably find Vargr colonies established on the more Lair-like
worlds of Corridor/Eneri.  These would be independant, and most likely
balkanized.  Vargr Corsairs would wander from isolated colony to isolated
colony raiding and looting as they went.  This is what the Imperium would
find as it expands spinward.

The real problem would come when the rest of the extents hears of the new
pickings, and you get a Corsair Rush (similar to a Gold Rush)

There\'s an old WD article called Boarding stations that goes into some very
nasty traps like this. Written by Marcus Rowland IIRC. The really fun one
was the false airlock with a BFG in it - a large fusion gun or something
that could do lots of nasties by shooting through the docking tube into the
other ship through the airlock\'s hole in the armour...

   PE is an excellent sourcebook for people like me.  I am running a
   campaign wherein the players are fairly high level emissaries of
   Cleon who are working with extra-emperial worlds to help suppress
   piracy in the rimward regions of the Core subsector published in
   T4:Book1.  (Note that my campaign is not canonical. In year zero the
   Imperium consists of about 40 worlds almost entirely spinward of
   Sylea.  The bulk of Cleons efforts are directed at spinward
   expansion; his biggest problem is Vland.)

   The players have succeeded in drastically reducing piracy in the
   area, have brought new worlds into the Imperium, and are currently in
   the process of building scout bases, naval bases, and upgraded
   starports on these new worlds.  Their actions are dramatically
   altering the economies and cultures of many of these small,
   backwater, low-tech planets.  PE was a godsend to me, because it
   allowed me an objective standard by which to compare these effects.

   It cannot be compared to to FS and Starships; it is far better.  It
   is very well thought out, rather technical, and has many interesting,
   if somewhat specialized, applications to any campaign.  It can also
   be used as a boardgame, using sector maps as the board, and years as
   turns.  It appears to be moderately well playtested ---- more on that
   later.

   Yes, PE has rules (and costs) for building starports, upgrading them,
   and rules for the effect they have on the world\'s economy (and, if
   there is a colonization attempt going on, it\'s population).  There
   are rules for improving existing infrastructures as well as building
   new ones from scratch,  rules for research and developement to
   increase TL from scratch (Here\'s your chance to push your empire\'s TL
   higher than Cleon\'s pathetic 12!) along with a few optional rules for
   TL subcategories. There are rules for uplifting TL\'s using off-world
   training and industry, and rules for the effects that consumerism and
   pop culture have on the local economies.  There are rules for how
   much tax you can impose on a world before losing your popularity, and
   how much domestic spending you have to pay to maintain basic
   government services.  There are rules for using excess budget for
   doing neat things like building militaries and expanding industries,
   as well as rules for deficit spending and its negative implications.

   The reason you have not seen any reviews for it is that it is so
   complicated that I doubt anyone has played it thoroughly enough yet
   to make possible a complete review.  (It would definitely benifit
   from being put into a spreadsheet!)  But since I have played it (in a
   somewhat limited scope), I will offer up a (somewhat limited) review.

   PE is the most USEFUL supplement that T4 has produced so far.  Much
   of what has been published merely duplicated the work of previous
   incarnations of Trav. (AA being an intriguing exception, but one that
   I have yet to use extensively.)  PE is totally new; Trav has been
   needing something like it for a long time.  PE is to interstellar
   trade, commerce, and politics what TCS was to interstellar war.

   The rules governing the effects and interdependance of things like
   TL, industrial infrastructure, starports, culture, law level,
   government type, gross world product, interstellar trade, outsystem
   exploitation, local resourses and supply and demand are very well
   thought out, and mostly quite workable.  There are also rules, not
   yet used by me, for political problems like riots, rebellions,
   assasination attempts, coups, diplomacy, loyalty, etc.

   Now that I\'ve told you how great it is, I will go into my gripes. 
   These gripes should not keep you from buying PE, by any means.  They
   mostly concern broken rules for special situations that I need fixes
   for.  Any suggestions for fixes by the playtesters in general, and
   Hans in particular, would be greatly appreciated.

   Gripe 1: The rules for increasing the infrastructure score of the
   planet are independent of the planet\'s population, as far as I can
   see. While this may work fine averaged over an entire empire, it is
   definitely broken if one of your players runs a company starport for
   a corporate outpost of about 500 workers.  Small infrastructures
   should not be as expensive to upgrade as large ones.  Proposed fix: 
   multiply the upgrade factor by the GWP instead of by a flat 0.2 RU.
   (The RU, or resourse unit for you unitiated, is the PE unit of
   economic power.  In M:0, One RU costs 5 billion imperial credits; in
   M:1100, the credit is worth more, so 1RU = GCr4.)

   Gripe 2: As per gripe one, but for starports.  It seems like a small
   starport on a low-pop world should be cheaper to build and upgrade
   than the huge arrays of starports that must exist on high pop worlds. 
   No proposed fix as yet.

   Remark: It would appear that PE was not playtested for situations
   like upgrading poor little worlds on the fringes of an empire.  Using
   PE rules, it is hard to see how a world like Sturray, C8A6215-A,
   could even exist.  What company would expend the flat rate necessary
   to build a C-class starport for a tiny little world whose GWP is
   measured in micro-RU\'s?  These costs should be based on the GWP of
   the world, and not on some flat rate.  The starport rating would then
   indicate the average quality of a world\'s many, or few, starports. 
   This is, however, a complicated issue which has never been
   extensively addressed by canon.

   Quibbles:  Typos, though very rare, are especially troublesome in a
   book ladden with mathematical formulas.  These formulas should be
   arranged in a more coherent fashion, with more consistent notation. 
   A spreadsheet would be nice.

   Overall impressions:
   T4:        *** (****, if I modify tasks and don\'t use QSDS.)
   Starships: 0
   AA:        *** (I like it, but for some reason, I don\'t use it.)
   CSC:       ****
   M0:        *****
   FS:        0
   EA:        ?
   PE:        ***** (I have used it extensively for the two weeks I\'ve
                     owned it, and I forsee continual use in the
                     future. It could be better, but it\'s the best there
                     is. It is truly a groundbreaking supplement!)

	Yes, PE does have costs for starport development. They\'re listed in
terms of Resource Units, a sort of abstract measure of resource usage,
but there is a sidebar to figure out how many credits a Resource Unit is
worth on a particular world. It handles basically every phase of enpire
building, from the ground up; it even gives some really good
background/adventure ideas. I don\'t like all the tables being grouped at
the end (great fior reference later, but I like \'em in-line with the
text when I\'m first reading through). Other than that, I\'ve been pretty
satisfied.

	Hope you have the electronic version done by the time I\'m out of boot!

We\'re using different units.  Yours is g/cc, where d(water) = 1.  Mine is
a normalized scale, where d(earth) = 1.  Normalized units are often far
more convenient and intuitive -- that\'s why Gs for acceleration and
atmospheres for pressure are in such common use.

> As for GG, they are from 0.7 to 1.5 on average density.

Yes, with Saturn being the 0.7 g/cc case -- meaning that the whole planet
would float in water. :)

The size number.. this is the roman numeral after the K3 bit.  It runs from
Ia (bright supergiant) to VII (dwarf)  our sun is a G2v, V being the main
sequence.

Do yourself a favor and pick up _World-Building_ by Stephan L. Gillett.
(Writers Digest Books, 1996)  This book explains everything about building
realistic worlds, and addresses stellar age and components.  It also
struggles to justify some of the more popular SF cliches, like
silicon-based life and acidic seas.

reverse engineering the Xboat to see how much was spent on computers, to
determine it\'s capacity.

That won\'t work, the data is in \'databanks\' which are some form of on-line
storage, NOT computers. 

However, I was browsing through my stuff last night to see what there was
about the express boat system, and I came across the entry in the Imperial
Encyclopedia. In that entry, there are no \'X-boat tenders\'. An X-boat
jumps in system, beams it\'s data to an Xboat Station, which then beams the
data back out to another Xboat waiting to jump out. This process usually
takes under four hours, and has been recorded at a record of seven
minutes.

(WARNING WARNING I am working from possibly faulty memory here about the
rate at which data can be transmitted at a given frequency...I think it\'s
1/2 bit per cycle)

This gives us some numbers to work with. The frequency of a modulated beam
gives an upper limit to the amount of data that can be transmitted using
that beam (this is a basic restatement of Shannon\'s Law) at a bit density
of 1/2 bit per cycle. We\'ll use tight beam maser communications. Masers,
microwave lasers, operate in the frequency range of about 10^9 to 10^11
Hz. lets say 10^10 for ease of calculations.

By Shannon\'s law, we can transmit a maximum of 5 x 10^9 bits per second.
Using modern day standards, of 8 data 1 start 1 stop and no parity bits,
that\'s 5 x 10^8 bytes per second, a transmission rate of 500
megabytes/second.

Ok, we have the bandwidth, Now there are two ways that the xboat station
can handle the data.

1) they can accept all the data, then retransmit onnce it is done. This
gives us at a first approximation, 3.5 minutes of data transmission time,
or 105 Gigabytes of data.

2) They can stream the data to the reciever from the moment they start
recieving it from the incoming x-boat. This gives us the full seven
minutes of data, or 210 Gigabytes of data.

And this is for the fastest transfer on record...so I suspect it was with
a minimal data load. The IE article mentions that the usual turnaround
time is about four hours. Lets give that a 50% slop time, and say
they\'re only transferring data for 2 hours. 2 Hours at 500 Mb/second is
1.8 terabytes for an \'average\' Xboat load.

Without hardware compression ;-)

This analysis makes some restrictive assumptions, too, in using maser
communications. If laser communications are used, then the data
transmission rate goes up by almost 5 orders of magnitude.

We can get insane, and use a downpowered X-Ray laser. X-Rays inhabit the
range of 10^16 - 10^21 Hz. At 10^18 Hz you will get a rate of 5 x 10^17
bits/second, or a final data rate of roughly 500 PETAbytes /second.

this gives an Xboat an astonishing data capacity...

Discuss among yourselves...please, If I\'m wrong fix this now, because this
isn\'t only relevant to X-boat capacity but to all forms of communications
in Traveller...how much data goes out over those ship communicator pipes?

I like the rationale presented by someone a couple of years ago in an 
old tml message (before my time, but I\'ve been reading from the 
archives): the 2D maps are maps of jumpspace, which only has two 
dimensions even though realspace has three.  This also dodges the "real 
stars not where they should be" problem.

Hi All,

A while ago I assembled all the CT grav related equations. Here is a 
comparison of the CT rules to RL.

Gravity
*  Gravitational Law:  g = (G)*(M)/(r)^2
   Where G = 6.67E-11 Nm^2/kg^2
For Earth M = 5.98E24 kg, r = 6.37E6 m   This gives g = 9.81 m/s^2

How does traveller do it?
Way back in Book 2 I found three equations:

Equation              Units           Comments (what is it?)
(1)  M = K*(D/8)^3     [Earth Masses]  Planetary mass
(2)  Gs = K*D/8        [standard g]    Surface gravity
(3)  L = 64*(M/G)^0.5  [km]            Distance to reach given "gravity 
band"
Here, D is the Size UPP number, K is density ratio (compared to earth = 1)
Radius R = 8*D [1E2 km]

Eq (1) can be checked vs earth:
>  D = 8, K = 1, Therefore M = 1 (kind of obvious, isn\'t it?)

Eq (2) can be checked vs gravitational law for size A world:
>  D = 10, K = 1, r = 80E5 m, M = 5.98E24*1.953
>  Gs = 1*10/8 = 1.25 g
>  Grav Law gives g = (6.67E-11)*(5.98E24)*(1.953)/(80E5)^2 = 12.1716 m/s^2
>  When divided by 9.81 m/s^2
>  You get  Gs = 1.24 g            Not too bad

Eq (3) seemed to be mostly useless in given form. Rearranging it I got
the following
(3a)  G = 4096*(M)/(L^2)
Which will give you the percentage of surface gravity of a body experienced
at a distance L from the body\'s center.
Again, for size A world:
>  G = 4096*1.953/(80E2)^2 = 0.9999    Good enough

A combination of (2) and (3a) will give you actual gravity at that point
(4)   g = 512*(M)*(K)*(D)/(L^2)
So the g at the 10 diameter Jump point is
>  g = (512*1.953*1.0*10)/(10*2*80E2)^2 = 3.906E-7
>  Grav Law gives
>  g = (6.67E-11)*(5.98E24)*(1.953)/(10*2*80E5)^2 = 3.0429E-2 m/s^2

Craig, probably meant 0.7 to 1.2 times Earth\'s density. I think the
densities for rocky planets are expected to be in the range of 3 to
6g/cc. Stars, Iceballs (like Pluto) and Gas Giants would be around
1g/cc..sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less.

Yeah, Valkyrie is a good mag. Only problem is, it\'s not very regular at the

I\'ve wondered if it would be possible to contstruct a 3D setting that
retain the salient points.  If you assume that only high metalicity
stars are worth mapping you have a diskt that is 100 light years (if I
remember right) accross.  Thus the Imperium would still cover
the galactic plane from top to bottom.  However, to do so
and make sure that you weren\'t introducing problems would
be duanting task.

Actually, in ALL the movies the Enterprise has honking big windows;
espcially in the crew lounge/rec areas. In the Classic Trek series, however,
the only windows ever shown were in the observation corridor along the
Hanger deck in the Engineering Hull. You could look down on the hanger deck
or out into the space, either way, you were isolated at the back end of the
ship, in the section where all other non transporter enterance/exit was located.

Stars are classified by Spectral Type and Luminosity Class.

The sequence of Spectral Type classifications, from hottest to coldest is 
OBAFGKM (with RNS being special types).

The types are subdivided by a digit 0-9 following the letter code.

Following the Spectral Type are Roman numerals denoting the Luminosity 
Class of the star. Ia and Ib are supergiants, II are bright giants, III 
giants, IV Subgiants, V are main sequence stars (dwarfs) like our sun, VI 
are subdwarfs and VII (or D) are white dwarfs.

Traveller: Beyond The Pale.  Here\'s the post-game summary:

The Cast:

Amr "let\'s go hunt down a gang of thieves without arming ourselves first"
Santayema: a young, somewhat impetuous, and altogether too pacifistic
merchant, played by the TML\'s own Ross Coburn.

Lt Kehaaarl: Aslan ex-marine, played by a non-TML\'er.  Big, strong, and
whose frightening appearance is only surpassed by his frighteningly poor
command of Galanglic, employed as a body guard to...

...Sir Loreni Vilash: Vilani merchant from a poor family whose trading
acumen led him to a knighthood and the captaincy of a brand new free trader.

Dame Iliana Berek\'san: a prominent chanteuse; tall, pale, beautiful,
dressed in the cutting edge of Sylean fashion, with a blue & purple topknot
reaching down to her knees and coloured contacts to match, who\'s slumming
it in the company of...

...Perlis Dalal: a muscular female ex-scout, well-trained in the Alberto
Fujimori School of Terrorist Negotiations.  Played by the TML\'s Glenn Grant.

	This lovely bunch of coconuts is presently assembled, along with a
growingly large number of fortune-seekers and adventurers, on Mishegaan
III, a godforsaken LSP mining colony, waiting for an Imperial interdict to
lift on a nearby cluster of main-sequence stars with mucho prime real
estate orbiting them.  Last game they incorporated Quintana Speculative
Ventures LIC and bought up all three Jump-3 vessels on the planet.


The Story:

	If you recall, last week\'s session concluded with a ship getting
bombed on the starport tarmac and Sir Loreni\'s cargo of Fusion+ units being
stolen.  This unsurprisingly caused considerable emoi at Mishegaan
starport, and so Lebar Eerht, the Imperial Administrator in charge of the
starport and Vought Hendaar, called a joint captains\' conference.  Sir
Loreni attended this while Kehaaarl went off to liase with starport
security at the warehouse from which the Fusion+ units had been stolen.
After discussions in broken Galanglic with the security officers, he was
informed that they\'d discovered a set of bulk hauler tracks proceeding away
from the warehouse and over the crater rim (Mishegaan III\'s sole settlement
being built into a crater wall with the starport inside the crater).
Kehaaarl then proceeded to the bombing site to investigate further.

	Meanwhile, at the captains\' conference, held in a large boardroom
overlooking the starport, Lebar Eerht (a forty-something toughly competent
Imperial civil servant) and Vought Hendaar (visualize a fascistic-looking
version of the old geneticist in Jurassic Park) made a joint announcement
to the assembled merchants that yes, a ship had been blown up and a rather
daring theft had been committed.  They assured all present that they were
going to radically tighten security and increase patrols and would keep
everybody informed of future developments.  Questions came fast and furious
and were answered with smooth platitudes.  After the conference, Eerht took
Sir Loreni aside and escorted him into his office, where he informed him
that at present he was currently unable to spare any men to search for his
cargo, which in any case was on LSP\'s turf now.

	Sir Loreni then called Brougt Mingaan, Ling\'s Chief of Security on
the planet.  However,he only got a flunky wearing an impressive-looking
peaked cap who assured him he\'d pass the message on.  Rather upset, Sir
Loreni realized that he was going to have to go look for himself.  He
stormed down to the main concourse, heading for his ship.

	In the meantime, Kehaaarl arrived at the scene of the bombing.  He
liased with the security officer in charge of the bombing investigation,
who revealed, among other things, that in his opinion Ling\'s security
people were a bunch of incompetent brutal fascist bastards and
uncooperative to boot, and that the explosion was the result of a very
large shaped charge detonated beneath the vessel.  He stated that given the
fact that the planet was a mining colony, there were explosives, up to and
including (well-guarded) fission devices readily available.

	Meanwhile, Dame Iliana and her entourage had just landed on an
intrasystem shuttle, fresh from a concert on one of the outer planets in
the system.  They were met at the arrival gate by Onyas Sedducha, her
manager, who informed her that he\'d followed her instructions and bought
her into Quintana.  Spotting Sir Loreni stomping by in a foul mood, he
introduced the two.  After a brief discussion of the situation, Dame Iliana
decided that chasing after thieves would be highly entertaining and
insisted on tagging along with Sir Loreni.

	At first, they were going to take the (somewhat beat-up) LAV-10
that they\'d bought when they bought the ship it was on, but Amr had a
better idea; to take their Locust-class Frontier Trader (a profitable
airframe wedge J-3 300td 1G trader that Ross really should post to the list
as it\'s a great design) instead seeing as how it packed a sandcaster and a
95 Mj laser.  All parties met at the Locust and they began lifting off...
whereupon everybody simultaneously realized that they\'d forgotten to bring
guns.

	They quickly landed again.  Kehaaarl hurried off to his room at the
spaceport hotel, to collect his FSA 15mm cassette-fed gauss anti-tank
rifle.  Perlis ran and got her ACR-12, and Amr, recalling a discussion he\'d
had with one of the seedier-looking merchants on the concourse, paid far
too much for a single Spurt Gun (all hail Greg Porter, Author of the Divine
Book Emperor\'s Arsenal).  Meeting back at the ship, the somewhat
better-equipped party took off, with Dame Iliana recording the proceedings
on her HandyCam-12.

	Tracking the cargo hauler upon which their cargo had been loaded
was not difficult; using the landing cameras on the underside of the ship,
they followed the tracks in the regolith up and over the crater wall, and
into the boulder-strewn wilderness beyond.  Shortly after leaving starport
airspace, they were joined by two Ling Security G-Carriers, who insisted on
coming along to supervise.  They followed the cargo hauler\'s tracks to a
smallish (approx 1 km) crater about 40 km away from the spaceport, where
the cargo hauler was parked by the crater wall.

	Suddenly, one G-carrier disappeared in a fireball.  A split-second
thereafter, they spotted a missile contrail rising rapidly from the crater
wall; Amr took evasive action, but failed; there was a large bang as the
SAM detonated against the hull.  Down in the turret, Kehaaarl opened fire
with the ship\'s laser, and continued firing at the spot from which the
missile had been fired until Amr dived the ship into cover behind the
crater wall.  Seconds later, they lost radio contact with the second
G-Carrier.

	On board the ship, much discussion ensued.  Finally, negotiation
was the course of action decided upon.  Sir Loreni broadcast over the
public mainband "Uh, excuse me, about our cargo..." at which point Amr shut
down his mike, and switched over to Perlis, who started in with "listen,
assholes...".  In the meantime, Kehaaarl, determining the location from
which the second missile had been fired, commenced laser bombardment of
that area of the crater.

	Perlis\'s negotiating technique had better effect, as they recieved
a response to the effect that Ling was a bunch of "suppressive fascists"
and that they were fellow travellers for wanting to get their cargo back
when it could be used against Ling.  Sir Loreni then asked how Ling was
oppressive; the mysterious individual informed Sir Loreni that if he met
him at the center of the crater in 10 minutes he could show him some scars.
Perlis then threatened that if they didn\'t "cough up the cargo in ten",
they were "gonna get smoked!  Ten!"  and stopped counting.

	At this point, the individuals down in the crater began a
discussion as to which precise units of time she meant but since none of
the PC\'s were privy to it I didn\'t dwell on it.

	Not being complete imbeciles, the PC\'s did not fall for the
terrorist invitation to meet them in the crater center, and so Perlis and
Kehaaarl donned vac suits, locked and loaded, and jumped out an airlock.
Sneaking around the crater rim, staying under cover and so forth, took them
the better part of an hour; in the meantime, Sir Loreni\'s sensor scans of
the area revealed pretty well zero activity and that the hauler was in fact
parked next to a small cave.  Perlis and Kehaaarl arrived at the hauler (a
large tracked flatbed job).  Determining that the cave mouth was artificial
and of recent vintage, they then decided that the best thing to do was to
shine the cargo hauler\'s headlamps down the cave.  At about this point, Sir
Loreni recieved a call from Ling Security enquiring as to the whereabouts
of their G-Carriers.  On being informed that they were smoking debris, and
that Sir Loreni\'s crew were investigating, Ling Security went ballistic and
sent out large numbers of reinforcements.

	After some dithering over the possibility of boobytraps,  Kehaaarl
fired up the hauler and moved it around so that its headlamps sone into the
cave.  They revealed that after about 12 meters in, the cave, or rather
tunnel, sloped downwards.  Shutting off the headlamps, Perlis and Kehaaarl
entered the cave.  At the end of the downslope they found a largish,
clearly artificial cave with a wide, circular opening in the floor that
went a long way down.  After some discussion, Kehaaarl emulated Pippin the
Hobbit and dropped a rock down the well.  A few seconds thereafter he was
rewarded with a barrage of small arms fire and tracer.  Both of them hit
the dirt.

	They then decided to try contact again; turning the gain on her
suit radio way down (so that it couldn\'t transmit through the meters of
rock overhead and be recieved by Ling), Perlis somewhat more politely asked
about their cargo, mentioning that Ling Security was on their way.  After a
few seconds, she received a similarly low-gain reply to the effect that
they could forget about their cargo, that the sender was very happy Ling
was on the way, and if Perlis and Kehaaarl had any sense they\'d get out of
there very quickly.  At about this point, a fleet of 8 Ling G-Carriers
arrived in the crater.  They immediately demanded that Sir Loreni download
his sensor records for the entire incident to them; he complied.

	Perlis and Kehaaarl took the advice they\'d been given and left,
without informing Ling\'s troops, who began preparing for an assault on the
cave.  Sir Loreni and company departed without further ado.  Arriving back
at the spaceport, however, they recieved a call from their lawyer (and
Ling\'s CLO for Mishegaan system), Liontzel Huutzaa, enquiring as to what
was going on, and informing them that Ling had lost contact with the
expeditionary force out in the crater about five minutes previously.  He
then stated that he was going to move on board ship, as things were
beginning to look a little dicey in the mining colony.

	On final approach, the PC\'s noted that a new vessel, a suspiciously
unstreamlined and heavily armed one, had landed while they were gone.

	And we called it there.  More next week.

It is possible that stars that were once 1 parsec away from each other
will suddenly become 6 because of the new z axis of a 3d map. Though 3D
maps are more realistic, 2D maps are much easier to work with.

By the way, do any astronomer know how far away the Orion Constellation is
from Earth? Particularly the stars in the belt.

Some time ago I mentioned a book that is intended more as a
science-popularization work for the intelligent reader, as opposed to a
scholastic textbook, so it should help you out, at least in terms of how
the galaxy is structured:

_The Guide to the Galaxy_ by Nigel Henbest and Heather Couper (Cambridge,
1994). It\'s packed with gorgeous color astrophotography, and it has the
best, most detailed maps of various regions of the galaxy I\'ve ever seen.
An entertaining, in-depth description of the galaxy\'s structure as it is
currently understood. Highly recommended.

You might also try all the second-hand or remaindering bookshops you can
find, especially the ones near universities, and look for used astronomy
textbooks (easier on the wallet than new textbooks!). But remember that
this is a rapidly changing field of knowledge - get the most recent book
you can find. For instance, just in the last month the best estimates of
the age and size of the universe have undergone major revisions.

It\'s an excellant product. Having all the tables in the back can be a bit of
a pain
from time to time, but you can photcopy (or even dare I say rip them out) them
for easier play. I\'ve only found one error. The table to determine which alien
race colonised a world (if non-humans are indicated) is missing. Other than that
I\'d have to say its brilliant.

Yep, and by that we can see that it costs ca. 6,000 Sylean Megacredits to
improve a Class E starport to a Class D and MCr60,000 to improve that to a
C. At those prices it\'s a wonder that there are any starports in the
universe at all. 

The other parts of the book looks very good, but the planetary development
chapter is definitely broken. I did point out during playtest that a system
that makes it 10 times more expensive to improve the infrastructure of a
100 man outpost on a size 10 planet than it is to improve that of a size 1
planet with 10 billion inhabitants were perhaps a tad unrealistic, but
apparently the authors disagreed with me.

Take the example of infrastructure improvement that is given in the book.
Uurigger is "by far the most promising economy within the Empire outside
of Khuir itself. It has a population of 0.4 labor points, a TL of 8,
Resources of 7, and an infrastructure of 7. Culture isn\'t mentioned, so
let\'s assume it is 7. The present GWP of Uurigger is ((7*0.1*7)*0.4*7)/8
or 1.72. By improving the infrastructure it becomes ((7*0.1*7)*0.4*8)/8
or 1.96, an improvement of 0.24. To get this improvement Khuiir has had
to invest 51.2 RUs, which means it will take 213 years before the
investment has been paid off (and that\'s without charging any interest).
And if the repayment is to be used on Khuiir, the transportation costs 
impose another 50% loss.

OTOH, high-population worlds are incredibly good investmenst, of course.
Unless they are a few parsecs away, in which case transportation costs
will eat up any profits.

My suggestion for infrastructure improvement is that it costs RUs equal to
the TL of the planet for each labor point (100,000,000 people). 

Similarily, I recommend a cost of RUs equal to infrastructure per labor
point to uplift technology.

The cost of establishing a new colony should be Inf*TL per labor point.

The cost of moving people should be 10 RU per parsec per labor point.

Transportation costs should add 10% per parsec to foreign investments, not
50%.

Note that I haven\'t playtested this (except by doing a lot calculations), so
it\'s possible they are as badly broken as the present rules, but if my
calculations are correct, it will make the return of most investments 
reasonable (much will depend on the resources and culture of the planets, of 
course). If anyone does try it and runs into any problems, please let me know.

One thing that seems clear to me is that to the ruler of a pocket empire,
planets with less than a million inhabitants are completely insignificant
in an economic sense. That dosen\'t mean that they can\'t be tremendously
important in a political sense, of course.

Not that I would ever, in a million years, suggest that anyone should 
take apart their RPG products <G>, but if you have one of those thermal 
binding machines available, you can put the book in there, heat the spine 
up, then slip the pages out of one location and put them in another.  

I did that with Starships, moving the color plates to become the final 
pages in the book.  It worked fine for me that once...your mileage 
may vary.

Just in case anyone missed it the first time around (I noticed Dave 
Bullock hasn\'t put it on the IG website yet), here\'s that table again:

ALIEN RACE TABLE

 2-9  Minor human race.
10-11 Minor alien race.

Hmm...counting "intuition", this matches with mine except for CSC (which
I\'m not particularly interested in).  I bought AA straight away; looked
at M0 in the shop and bought it; didn\'t look at Starships or CSC; and
took one look at FS and thought, "I\'m not paying for that".  After
reading a description of PE, I reserved a copy straight away (it should
have arrived at the shop by now, but I haven\'t been there for a while).
So far, reading has confirmed my intuition (and your scores).

How would other people rate the T4 products so far?

That\'s just another form of "2 view" presentation, with the

producing their own maps (unless they are very skilled or someone

Which shows that the person who wrote it hadn\'t thought things thru.
The spread between 4 hours and 7 *minutes* makes little sense. Nobody
calls it a "record" if you transfer a much smaller than normal load in
a short time. More on this later...

Shannon\'s Law:

	C= W log2( 1 + S/N )

	C = throughput in bit per second
	W = bandwidth in hertz
	S/N = signal to noise ratio

5e9=1e10 * log2(1+S/N)

sqrt(2)=1+S/N

I rather suspect that the data channel is very noisy. So they have to
use error-correction code. The 7 minutes is essentially an error-free
transmission, the 4 hours is with a "normal" number of resent packets.
That\'s a ratio of about 34:1. Which is why I assume a very noisy
channel. I get a "normal" S/N ratio of .01 for the channel.

I draw the line at UV lasers for comm. Higher frequencies are just too
damn dangerous to work around.

	Simply by pointing out that I won\'t even buy from a game store that
shrink-wraps its books. This has nothing to do with the early IG products,
even. I\'ve never bought a book sight-unseen ... well, ok, ALMOST never. I
insist on flipping through it, checking out the visual appearance as well

	For the record, the one book I bought sight-unseen was the original FF&S.
But that was based on having seen some of the discussions on GEnie, and on
the quality of the original TNE book.

	Er, nope ... critical mass depends on how well you can compress and
contain the fissile material before the ensuing reaction tears it back
apart. If you take the "critical mass" from the original Hiroshima warhead,
and just dumped it in a pile in the middle of your living room, the
resulting "firecracker" reaction would scatter it all over your living room
... but not much more.

	No, the ability to initiate a reaction with a smaller amount of material
goes up. Not just compression and containment, either. There are other ways
to reduce the amount of fissile material necessary ...

	And all of that is just for fission warheads ... fusion warheads
(fission-triggered and otherwise) are a whole different ballpark.

I\'m having lots of fun playing Perlis. I\'ve given her a really down-market
pseudo-Australian accent -- she\'s from a prison colony, has a Social
Standing of 2, and didn\'t complete high school, let alone go to
university... Makes it lots of fun to shout things like, "Right, ya
bastards. Hand over the stolen cargo, or you\'re smoke!" (Not that it did us
any good, but at least I had fun!)

I hasten to point out that the basic data given for Kinuu/Vland are from
FS, embellished with a randomly generated LL and a cultural profile of my
own creation (with Derroch\'s approval). So very little of that part is
canonical.

Dalal\'s personal history was fleshed out by using a new system I\'ve worked
up for randomly generating a wide variety of events in a character\'s life
(love affairs, marriages, social conflicts, traumatic experiences, you name
it). If you\'re really nice I\'ll finish writing up the Life Events system

Perlis Alyeska Dalal

Personal history:

Parents: political exiles, members of a minor cultural movement censured by
their homeworld for gender discrimination. Father: Arkanin Dalal, once a
wealthy trader, deported to Kinuu with his three wives; two decades later,
third wife Pria gives birth of Perlis Alyeska.

Siblings: 1 sister, 2 brothers, 2 half-sisters, 4 half-brothers. Perlis is
the 7th-born of the 9 siblings.

Childhood: much time spent exploring and hiding in disused tunnels and
maintenance shafts; acting as spy and lookout for brothers\' gang, watching
out for enforcers. Considered an unmanageable tomboy by parents and
neighbours.

Age 12: assigned to Infrastructure Maintenance as apprentice mechanic,
under a program set up by Colonial Government to provide skills and
employment to the colony\'s neglected young women.

Age 14: endures a long-dreaded betrothal ceremony; learns that her father
has arranged for her to marry a 50-year-old ice miner.

Age 16: escapes Kinuu, and impending marriage, by lying about her age,
gaining working passage aboard a supply ship. Later lands a job as Third
Mechanic\'s Assistant aboard a 4000dt Imperial Colonization Service \'ice
liner\' (Low-Passage Personnel Transport).

Age 18: Joins Scouts. Impresses superiors in Basic Training; considered a
quick study, almost instantly competent at a variety of unfamiliar tasks.
Immediately assigned to an Exploration and Recontact ship in the Corridor
Sector.

Age 20: Trained in Melee Combat and Acting, in preparation for clandestine
landing party on pre-Contact Tech 2 world. Spends a long difficult year on
[classified]/Corridor with fellow Advance Contact Team member Tagir
Shimata. Discover they have much in common: both are from tiny,
conservative, backwater planetoids; escaped at a young age aboard a tramp
ship; enjoy acquiring new skills and exotic experiences. During a civil
uprising (possibly brought on by cultural influence from the Advance
Contact Team), Perlis is severely injured; without access to real medical
treatment, her broken jaw sets badly and scars remain.

Age 21: Upon their return to Forward Base, Tagir and Perlis move in
together. Perlis undergoes surgery to correct the damage to her jaw; also
takes the opportunity to have some minor cosmetic adjustments made to her
facial features.

Age 22: Enters into formal non-monogamous marriage contract with Tagir, so
that the ISS will at least attempt to station them together more often than
not.

Serves on three Exploration vessals over the following ten years.
Participates in many Recontact missions, as well as several more
clandestine pre-Contact assignments.

Various extramarital affairs, usually during long separations from Tagir
when he is posted to a remote Forward Base.

Age 30: Begins fourth term, living with Tagir at Forward Base [classified].
The base, constructed within a vast lava tube on a geologically dead
satellite, is nearly destroyed by an unexpected collapse (caused by a
world-wide \'settle-quake\'). Both survive, though many colleagues are
killed.

Age 33: Falls in love with a younger crewmember, Engineer Berrin
Viruzhtrii, and seriously considers him as a potential secondary husband.
But Berrin, too hidebound by Vilani traditions, refuses to share her with
Tagir. He soon takes a posting far to Coreward, just to escape from her.

Age 35: While assigned to survey the high-gravity, fast-spinning waterworld
[classified]/Corridor, Tagir\'s launch is caught in an F-6 hurricane.
Disabled by airborn regolith debris kicked up by the storm, the launch
spirals into the planetwide ocean\'s near-boiling maelstrom. Transponder
signal lost, not even the Vehicle Data Recorder is recovered. Perlis is
devastated by the loss, but decides not to quit the Service in mid-term.

Age 37: Grief-management therapy awakens an interest in Psychology; enrolls
in an ISS course. At this time, receives news from home that her father has
died of heart failure.

I\'m sure this is well known, but there is a couple of books about this, by
Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln: "The Holy Blood and the
Holy Grail", and "The Messianic Legacy".  It\'s classic grand conspiracy
theory; a mix of detailed, rigorous, research and wild leaps of faith.  The
basic idea is that there exists a thousand plus year old secret society,
the "Prieure de Sion", who were the creators and the guiding force for the
Knights Templar, as well as other important organisations, who have been
manipulating European history (at least) with the sole aim of restoring the
Merovingian dynasty to the throne of every European country, said dynasty
being the direct decendants of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdelene.

I\'m sure this isn\'t really relevant, but conspiracy theories like this are
a great source of plot inspiration.

This week I\'m stealing another idea from a conversation I had with a 
friend. After detailing a character for his PBeM game, he asked me if 
I was a DIP or DAS.  Turns out I\'m a DIP <g>, but at the time I was 
clueless as to what Eris meant. 

DIP stands for "Design in Play" and DAS stands for "Design at Start".
They refer to the method used for detailing a character for play in a 
game.  I tend to use broad brush-strokes on my characters and do the 
fine detailing as I go. Other people make up all the details about 
their characters and know *everything* about them before they start.

Which are you? Why do you prefer your method?

Thanks...I\'d been unable to find the exact equation...relying on nearly
40-year old neurons introduces an unacceptable s/n ratio in and of itself
;-)

I agree about your point of restricting comm lasers to UV and lower
frequencies.

I think, however, that the whole IDEA of \'beaming\' all this around is
relatively dumb, and the X-Boat tender concept is much, much sounder. I\'d
really prefer to have my mail under the carrier\'s physical control until
it\'s delivered...a beam can be tapped much easier than a hardware link,
and the bandwidth available to a hardware link is much greater.

Transit in from ~ 100 diameters out in to a planet at 6 or so gee is
pretty short (short compared to the week it took for the mail to get
here), and much more secure.

Defining the scale, I\'d say that--

0 stars = One of the worst, most useless products I\'ve ever seen.

1 star = A poor product, but not bad enough to be as described above.

2 stars = A fair product.  You could live with it or without it.  
Some of it interestes you, and some of it doesn\'t.

3 stars = A standard, good quality product.

4 stars = A very good product--one that you really, really like.

5 stars = One of the best products you\'ve ever seen for this game.


And, my ratings are:

T4:  ***  (Decent book, but with a little work, it could have been a 
              4 or 5)

Starships:  *  (I can actually use some of this book, but I almost 
                      rated it a 0)

CSC:  *** 1/2  (This product was almost a 4, but it needed better 
                       layout, pictures of equipment, and some other 
                       tweaks--info is great, though)

AA:  **  (I want to like this product, it is just that I don\'t use 
             it--and the book needed to offer more than it does)

M0:  **  (ditto as AA.  Done differently, I could really get into 
             this.  As is, it\'s just OK).

FS:  0  (100% pure crap--absolutely no usefulness at all)

EA:  *****  (100% pure Traveller.  Great book.)

PE:  ****  (I haven\'t written my review of this yet, but the more I 
              look at it, the more I like it).

JTAS#25:  **  (An OK gaming magazine)

JTAS#26:  ***  (It\'s getting better)

GM Screen:  ***  (It could really use code definitions for the UWP\'s. 
                           Other than that, it\'s a pretty good 
                           screen)

have had no joy so far. The only modes of gunfire described appear to be:

Single shot				T4 rules
Burst fire (3R or 5R depending on reference)	EA
Autofire (5R/target)			T4 rules
Suppressive fire (held autofire action)		T4 rules

I can remember CT having \'rapid fire\', which involved emptying the whole

into that context. EA hints at a beneficial DM.. Any ideas?

I\'m also assuming that the minimum damage limits are ignored for plasma and
laser weapons, but there doesn\'t seem to be reference to this either, aside
from plasma weapons having explosive damage in addition to the direct fire
damage. Is this what my fellow TMLrs are doing?

This would work well, but I still just like the idea of windows in the
sides of
my ships. My Guppy design has nice, BIG windows arranged around the 
passenger areas, it gives the passengers something to do during flight (my
version of jump space has psychedelic swirls and blobs and lights and such
that until anyone brings back a real photo of jump space will remain in my
game <g>), and damn it, they just FEEL right. Like someone previously
mentioned, the Mercury astronauts had a conniption until they put a window
in the side of the capsule. We want to be able to look out, and I picture a
big
passenger liner pulling into the Upstation dock like the old passenger liners
of the turn of the century, the passengers at the windows waving out at the
people waiting for the ship to arrive, and the family and friends standing
in the
big observation areas along the sides of the spacedock waving back and
trying to spot which window has their loved one waving back. Something
that one way sensors can\'t simulate.

In addition, I agree with the earlier assertions that 3000 years from now we
will certainly have something transparent that will be just as solid and safe 
as the hull itself; perhaps it will be the hull itself. Didn\'t one of the
later, 
Protestant <g> versions of Traveller speak of the hull material as being made
of a chameleon substance that could change its colors, design, camo, etc. 
pretty much at will? Someone will have to help me here, as I\'m an old 
Catholic Traveller man myself, and unfortunately don\'t even have all of 
those materials. (So, is anyone ever going to reproduce all the old stuff on
a CD or something? Please?)

Yes, I\'ve been tinkerin\', again.

Let\'s take a look at initiative.  In Book 1, it\'s pretty basic--even 
if you use (like I do) the individual initiative throw listed on page 
52.

What is basic initiative as listed?

Init = 1 D6 throw for higher dice.
DM:  Leadership skill

Let\'s say you\'ve got two characters going at it.  Neither has a 
leadership skill to benefit from, and neither has a leader close by.

What\'s the roll?  1 D6 for higher dice.

But, what if one of the characters is Dex 10 and the other is Dex 5?  
Doesn\'t this matter?  Doesn\'t personal quickness matter?

Well, I\'ve stumbled across a rule for CT that can fix all of this in 
a neat way.  

I\'ve been looking at Snapshot for my T4 game.  It\'s pretty simple to 
convert--actually no conversion is needed.  You just use the Snapshot 
tactical action points, and when you need to throw to hits--use the 
T4 rules instead of the CT ones.

Simple as pie.

They use the action point total in that game to decide who goes 
first.  The lower the action point total goes first, but characters 
with higher AP totals can pre-empt them.  AP for a character is 
determined by a calculation (Dex + End).

In going over these rules, I started thinking about TNE does 
initiative.  That was a pretty neat system for init.  Every character 
has a base init, and military characters usually have a higher base 
because they have been trained to think quick and perform action 
before the other guy kills them.

Combining these two ideas, I think I\'ve come up with a pretty neat 
idea for T4 initiative.  I\'m not exactly sure yet if I\'m going to use 
it permanently, but I plan on throwing this in on my next game 
session to see how it goes.

Here\'s the thought--

Initiative in T4 is changed from 
                    1 D6 for higher dice
to
                     1 D6 + Base Initiative


The Base Init. for a character is (like in Snapshot)
                        Dex + End


I like this idea in that it allows some weight in the who goes first 
decision for characters who are naturally quick.  

If you didn\'t want to throw End in there, you could just use Dex in 
your calculation
                    1 D6 + Dex

Here\'s how my current group would fair under this system

Name        Dex    End    Base    Base (Dex Only)
=====       ===    ===    ====     =============
Praygor     5        5        10         5
Gvoudzon 8        8        16         8
Frank        10       7        17         10
Glynn        7        6         13         7
Too           12      5         17         12
Gyr           6        5         11         6
Daeus       8       10        18        8



I can see pros and cons to using End in the throw (Dex is a given), 
and I\'m not quite sure which route I\'m going with yet.

But, let me cover the other topic--the DMs.

Currently, the only DM T4 allows is for Leadership, and I can see 
this.  I think that TNE had a point in giving military characters an 
advantage.

I\'ve come up with two ways to add DMs to the Initiative roll based on 
a character\'s career.  I like the second choice, but it is a bit more 
detailed (yet, I like detail in my game--you can probably tell from 
the forms I\'ve been sending out).

Option #1

+1 DM for military characters.  This is strictly defined and will 
only be allowed for characters from the Army, Marines, or Navy.


Option #2 (the one I like)

+2 DM for military characters.  This is strictly defined and will 
only be allowed for characters who were in the Army, Marines, or Navy 
AND had a front-line combat position.  If they were reserve, 
artillery, medics, engineers, or something like that, they don\'t get 
this bonus.

+1 DM for military characters.  This is defined as characters in the 
military who had rear or non-combat positions--clerks, 
administrators, medics--etc.

+1 DM for pseudo-military characters.  This is for characters who\'ve 
seen more action than the common citizen, but are not fully trained 
soldiers.  Examples would be some Scouts, Police, Rouges (criminals), 
etc.

+0 DM for common citizens.  You know--nobles, buracrats, scientists, 
and other civilian types.  No bonus for them.

So, what do you think of all this.  I\'d like your input.

Right now (and this idea is still in the germination stage), I\'m 
thinking of useing this system:

Initiative--
    1 D6 + Base

    Base defined as Dex + End

    DMs: +  Leadership skill
             +1 or +2 for military background--depending on type.
             +1 for pseudo-military background


Now, that seems to add some detail to the initiative throw without 
makeing it unplayable and encumbered with die throws and 
modifications.

Another thing I like about this is that a character\'s base initiative 
will be decreased as he takes damage.  If you take a hit to your Dex 
or End, you can\'t move as quick as you did the round before.

If weak characters see a badass whose wounded, they can go take 
advantage of the situation.

OK, that\'s it.  What do you guys think?

I like. It also doubles for a communication device, like they do on Star

Rapid fire (and very rapid fire) are descriptive terms for weapons. Rapid
fire refers to an autofire weapon capable of firing more than 20 rounds
per turn (ROF > 1200rpm), very rapid fire refers to a weapon capable
of firing more than 50 rounds per turn (ROF > 3000rpm). Rapid fire
weapons get a +2DM on autfire and Very Rapid Fire a +3DM. IIRC
these figures are not spelt out anywhere except in G3G, but you can
extrapolate them from EA.

That was \'Panic fire\' it enable a player to make up to 3 attacks in a single
round at a negative DM and expended all the rounds in the magazine.

Hmmm. I think I would have to go:

  T4:        **** (if I use KBv2)
  Starships: **
  AA:        **
  CSC:       ****
  M0:        *****
  FS:        * 1/2
  EA:        *****
  PE:        ****

Some of you may have gone "what, is he mad" for giving Starships and FS
scores higher than 0. But you have to remember that not everyone owns all
the CT/MT products ever released. I own a few TNE things, but mostly T4 is
the only version of Traveller I own. Hence Starships is fairly useful to
get an idea of ship stats (the deck plans don\'t do much for me though), and
FS is useful to know what is where (even if the information on each planet
is broken). M0 is a brilliant source of background (I wish it was longer
though ... say about 32 pages longer => ). EA is good for expanding the
weapons available past the limited selection in the main rule book, and PE
is very interesting reading (I don\'t know if I\'ll ever use it to a great
degree, but it is still interesting). AA is probably the least used and
looked at suppliment I own, not because of any fault with it, but just
because I\'m not that interested in it. However, it is still interesting to
read.

Anyone else want to give a score?

Just thought of one possible race to use windows in a starship...and it 
is not (despite the title of my message) the Vargr!

Think on it: The Vilani!

Vilani are very conservative. Long ago Vilani pilots dimmed their ships 
power useage before jump to give the jump drive that extra added omph to 
get over the brink of hyperspace. Long after more efficient 
engines/batteries/whatever made this unnecessary (see DGP\'s Starship 
Operators Manual One), tradition dictated that this still be done.

So in my great tradition of looking for a "Traveller" reason to explain 
stuff in the game (e.g., my reasons for why Traveller Computers are 
Stupide Big Iron Machines, etc.), here\'s my latest:

Starships of Vilani design have windows, including windows in the control 
area. The reason for this is tradition. The holographic viewing systems 
might fail, also, they would shut down during the dimming of power 
systems prior to jump. (Paranoid) Vilani pilots needed to see out, so 
windows were left in the control areas long after the need for them 
passed.

Works for me...

On what you see in hyperspace...I\'ve changed this over the years. 
Initially I went with a variant of Larry Niven\'s Hyperspace Blindspot: 
Your eye really can\'t accept hyperspace, so it tends to make the windows 
vanish...driving some folks crazy. Then I went with a version of 
hyperspace that kind of looked like a combination of the Stargate 
Sequence from 2001: A Space Odyssey and the hyperspace effects in Star 
Wars: A New Hope (of course at that point all of the folks in my group 
had seen Star Wars for the first time that year, and even our 
ship--called The Millenium Pigeon--had a passing resemblance to a certain 
other ship!).

I more recently adopted the description found in DGP\'s Starship Operators 
Manual.

In passenger cabins, crew quarters, I\'ve generally assumed that they have 
windows (exterior cabins) or holotanks (interior cabins)...

is superior to Traveller\'s; as opposed to just one mental attribute, it has
three; Perception, Intelligence, and Wits.  Initiative rolls are simply
opposed rolls of each character\'s Wits+Alertness.  Each character rolls
(Wits+ALertness)d10\'s, and he with the most successes wins.

     TRANSPARENT METAL DISCOVERED
     (Source: DISCOVER MAGAZINE, 7/96)
     
     It\'s not quite the "transparent aluminum" of Star Trek IV, but
     Dutch scientists think they have discovered a metal that you can
     see through under certain conditions. Normally a thin sheet of
     yttrium covered with palladium behaves like most metals,
displaying
     a shiny mirror-like surface; however, seconds after the metals
are
     exposed to hydrogen, something totally unexpected happens - they
     turn transparent. Evacuate the hydrogen, the metals turn shiny
and
     metallic again, unlike normal chemical reactions which can only
go
     one way. The value of such a discovery is not clear, but already
     Philips has bought the rights to the material. (JG)
     
     ----
 
	This isn\'t exactly what I was talking about originally but it
does point out to the fact that thin sheets of metals or
semiconductors can be made transparent and maybe someday thick slices
can be made transparent (at will) too... 
 
	The article I saw in the Economist talked about making
certain metals transparent to thinks like x-rays or other and their
transparency was seet during manufacture.  No mention of thickness
limits afaIcr...  I\'ll keep looking. :)

Two words:  Ceramic Steel

You know how they talk about transparisteel windows in Star Wars (Gasp!),
well such things may not be far from becoming reality.  I know of at least
two types of transparent metals that can be made in small quantities. 
Both iron and aluminum have been used to create transparent metal ceramics.

I know that you are all thinking that I\'ve been watching too many 
Star Trek movies, but I honestly read about this in science magazine 
sometime within the last three years.

The only catch is that apparently the stuff is very difficult to 
manufacture and has only been used so far in a few specialized 
areas. I\'ll try to find out more about it.

In any case, who is to say that the super high density materials 
used in Traveller don\'t have transparent ceramic types as well?

Thanks <blush>.

Generating the trade table isn\'t a lot of work.  At least, it\'s no harder
than an animal encounter table.  Metator (for the Macintosh) does it

There are lots of skills (at least technical skills) which are Tech level

</excerpt>

	I\'d say that many improvements in TL are down to things like efficiency,
smaller size, more powerful; basically, they work the same, except that
they\'re better.


	If someone trains to learn how to drive a car in 1965, they could
probably still drive many cars from today after having just seen them for
the first time. This would represent a jump in TL from 6 to 9, three
changes. The basics won\'t have changed, only the luxuries, but they are
usually so user-friendly in cars I\'d discount them as being too difficult
for a 1965 person to cope with.

	

	But could you and I drive a car three TL\'s in advance of today? And not
everything has changed as little since 1965 as cars have, computers being
a prime example. Someone from then may have a slight chance with a PC or
Mac, but there I would increase their task difficulty by half or one die
maybe. But, I wouldn\'t punish a 1965 guy for using a 1997 car too much.
But again, what about reverse TL, i.e. could I drive a car from a 100
years ago? Sheesh, I think you\'d have to wing it a little, unless someone
came up with some tables!


	I\'d hazard that increases in task difficulties would possibly depend on
the type of skill being used, and obviously the amount of difference in
TL. Or if you want a _very_ rough working model, maybe, one increase in
task difficulty for every two levels of TL\'s above the character\'s own
level of expertise.


	e.g. TL 7 man can play with a TL 8 computer, but has the task difficulty
modified by one against him / her for a TL 9, no more for TL A, then 2
for TL B etc...


	And an extra difficulty modifier in the other direction for every four
or five TL\'s below the character\'s level of expertise, except for
character\'s with, say, a skill level of 3 or more as they would possibly
know a little about the history of that task.


	e.g. TL 9 man tries to drive a TL 5 car, and has to roll at an extra
difficulty level, but irrelevant at TL 1, no cars, just horse and cart,
so you\'d have to use equestrian maybe, don\'t know, have to think about
this bit a little more!


	Someone who has a high skill level would possibly be deemed slightly
obsessive about that skill, so maybe only give them no negative DM if
they have a reasonably high education charateristic.


	So you could wing it, use this as a possible idea, or draw up tables for
each skill, for forward and backward level of skill against TL.

through with an Imperial Noble family going to establish a pocket empire in
a subsector of my own creation.  However, the rules aren\'t clearly stated,
or, at least, I can\'t find where it tells me how to take control of a

empire, if someone could explain it to me more clearly.

Whoa there....modern autos are _NOT_ TL9, no way. At _best_ modern autos
incorporate some TL-7-8-ish advances in materials technology, but the
basic design and operation of the automobile hasn\'t changed much since
the widespread introduction of the automatic transmission in the early
50\'s got rid of the clutch.

If you want to subject someone to the kinds of changes you\'re talking
about, over three tech levels, plop a WWI pilot into an F-16, and let him
try to fly it.

The problem with things like this is that, paradoxically, untrained people
will do better than people trained at lower tech levels...they haven\'t got
anything to unlearn.

However, this kind of adjustment is so task and situation dependent that
it\'s hard to pin down. I\'d make it 1 DM harder for two TL\'s, 2 for three,
but after that it\'ll probably become progressively easier, due to the
\'ease of use\' features that come into play.

	An easier way to go about it is layer several pieces of this stuff,
with slight gaps in between - pass gas <G> between them when you want to
see out. The gaps don\'t have to be very wide either - just enough to let
the hydrogen flow through.

	This sort of thing would allow you to armor sensor antenna/reciever

I think a character who was educated at TL 12 should be able to work on TL
14 stuff; just not very well. On the other hand a TL 14-educated character
should be able to work on TL 12 equipment, but not as well as the TL
12-educated one because of their lack of familiarity.

The only situation I have had with skills at different tech levels has been
characters trying to operate equipment or perform tasks on lower-tech
planets. I handled all of these on a case-by-case basis, but I will try to
put together my basic reasoning. First of all, I agree that characters
should perform tasks outside their experience less well, whether because of
cultural or technological differences. Secondly I want to avoid putting
tech level or cultural specifiers on every skill, both because it\'s too
unwieldly and because it rewards munchkins who choose the "right" planets
and skills. Third, it should be possible to generalize the method to deal
with situations like technical, training, or cultural differences.

The method I use is to first decide on the character\'s basic familiarity
with the technology, equipment, or culture the task is based on. Then I
decide on the "degree of separation" between an ordinary task and the task
to be completed. This is necessarily rather subjective and depends on the
exact nature of the task, but I will give a few examples later. Once this
is understood the rule I use is simple. Depending on the character\'s
familiarity, add the degree of separation as a DM or difficulty scale. The
basic progression is:

	Discoverer	Add DoS to DM
	Familiar	No change
	Unfamiliar	Subtract DoS from DM
	Experimental	Increase task difficulty by DoS times
	Inconceivable	Requires DoS "Impossible" task rolls

"Discoverer" means the character actually discovered the equipment or
technique being used, in this case the degree of separation corresponds to
how specific the equipment or technique is to the discoverer. A Familiar
task is one the character has trained for or has encountered many times
before. An Unfamiliar task is one the character has no personal experience
with, but has heard of or seen before, even if only on TV (or whatever). An
Experimental task is one the character has no training for or knowledge of,
but which is based on principles or equipment the character does
understand. An Inconceivable task is one the character does not even
understand the basics of, let alone have training for. Through years of
experience Experimental tasks will become merely Unfamiliar and Unfamiliar
tasks Familiar, but Inconceivable tasks will always remain so until the
character gains a fundamental understanding of the task.

The Degree of Separation of a task is how many conceptual steps the task is
different from tasks the character is familar with. For equipment of
different tech levels this could be the difference in tech levels. For
processes using different training or operation it is the number of
"evolutionary stages" between the operations. This is necessarily a fuzzy
concept, but think of trying to change one operation into the other through
a series of small changes. A few example should give you the idea:

A TL 12 character is trying to repair a TL 14 jump drive. The GM determines
this to be a Difficult task. However, the character has never repaired a
jump drive of this technology before, though the drive operates on the same
jump theory as other drives the character has worked on. The GM decides
this is an Experimental task, and the 2 tech levels difference counts as 2
degrees of separation. So the task becomes 2 ratings higher, or Staggering.
It would still take dozens of successes for the character to become
knowledgeable enough of the TL 14 drive even to make it Unfamiliar.

Suppose a TL 14 character tries to repair a TL 12 jump drive. Now in my
campaign, a TL 14 engineer would have seen enough TL 12 ships at the
starport to make the task a Familiar one, so there would be no task
modification. However, lets assume the character has been locked in a drive
design plant on a planet with no foreign ships and has never seen a TL 12
drive before in her life. Even so, she would know that TL 12 drives once
existed, even from history class, so the task counts as an Unfamiliar one.
The 2 tech levels difference would count as 2 degrees of separation, so the
task gets a -2 DM.

An electronics technicial has built a bunch of customized devices for
monitoring electronic signals. The technology is standard, but the devices
use techniques and circuits the technicial invented himself. The technician
gets a +1 DM to any Intrusion task with these devices, while other
characters would get a -1 DM to use or circumvent the devices since they
are Unfamiliar with this specific technique. Note that I would give no DM
if the devices were merely scratch built and did not have an innovative
design.

Here\'s a tougher one; a TL 4 native gets his hands on a TL 12 laser pistol.
Now the TL 4 character has no concept of what a laser is so you may think
the task should be Inconceivable, however the concept the character uses is
"how do I point this thing at my enemy and kill him" and not "how do I
generate a coherent beam of electromagnetic energy". Therefore, I would
rule the task is Experimental, since the character has experience with
firearms even though this particular one is new. Also, I would not use tech
level as the degree of separation, since the character is trying to
understand its operation and not its technology. I reason this way: the
laser pistol is like his shotgun except it is one handed, does not fire
shells, and has no recoil. I count this as 3 degrees of separation, so an
attack at short range is increased 3 levels of difficulty to Impossible. In
this case I would let a few days of target practice make the character
merely Unfamiliar with the operation of the weapon, so he would only get a
- -3 DM to the normal task difficulty. Trying to repair or recharge the
weapon, on the other hand, requires understanding of TL 12 technology, so
this would count as an Inconceivable task requiring 8 Impossible
engineering or Physics rolls, one for each tech level difference.

Got the idea? Here\'s one for you: Some TL 12 characters want to break into
a TL 7 computer system and recover some secret data.

Nope, base-2 logarithm.  x = log2(y) if 2^x = y.

    'body' => 'Ive started laying out a set of deck plans for a 200 std yaght. I used
the SSDS Design Templates for Excel to determine the volume for the
various components, and to add some custom touches. While laying out the
design I noticed that the fusion power plant I used to power the ship
used only 125 M3 for fuell for a year and was capable of powerring the
ship, including a 1G thruster drive, which needed no seperate fuel.
However the 1J jump drive demands 280 M3 for fuel space for 1 jump. Now
maybey one of the gearhead types could explain why I can build a ship
that needs only a minimuim of fuel for a YEAR to move around inside a
system, but can\'t jump without more than five times as much LIQUID fuel?
Does the J-drive burn the fuel, or is it pushed through the power plant
to increase it\'s output just before jump? And what about accumulators?
Could I replace the liquid fuel with accumulators to store power over
time for the jump? If accumulators are used how can I determine what
size PP to install for what lenth charge rate? I\'m sure someone has
already discussed this and I just missed it. If anyone has worked out
alternate rules along this line please let me know, or at least let me
know if the fuel is burned in the j-drive so I can note the fuel piping
to the proper place.
Thanks for the help

Chameleon paint doesn\'t make the hull material different - just the surface
of it. If you paint your house red does the wood turn into red paint all
through?
"Lets paint our superdense material with transperant paint" idea sound both
childish and Nivenish to me but as not to irk somebody too much this is my
personal opinion and does not reflect upon the holders of such ideas - just
the ideas themselves ;)

...There...that should be enough!

In the BITS publication (soon to be IG publication, but in two parts) of 
The Long Way Home the playing group encounters a hyperspace (hand wave ! 
hand wave!) tunnel that catapults them into the Gamma Sector (whoops!, 
sorry! wrong universe!)..errr...another sector of space.

Much of the adventure is set around trying to find the Way Back, 
including looking for another such hyperspace tunnel.

To the authors of this fine adventure (and to the list in general): Is 
this a new innovation, or has it been cited in previous "canonical" 
sources?

Thanks!

CSC and EA are down-rated for serious violations of the CT/MT

history for a change rather than my very out-of-date physics and biology
knowledge. 

  I must point out that the Vilani culture explanation for the lack of
Imperial progress works for the single case, but how then do we explain
what is going on in other cultures?  After all, the other major races seem
to have a similar pattern of technological development.  Is it a
requirement for a large interstellar society that it be conservative when
it comes to technology?  I\'m not sure, but unless you make that
assumption, it become hard to explain why the other major races don\'t
advance any faster than the Imperium (unless Grandfather is putting
something in the water...). 

  As for the idea that necessity is the mother of invention, well, the
consensus among historians of technology is that it is not.  When one
thinks of the extraordinary proliferation of designs of things, and the
huge numbers of ways one can accomplish any given task, it is clearly
inadequete to say that some sort of necessity drives the invention
process.

  The exact mechanism behind technological change is still open to debate,
but my particular favorite centers around an evolutionary model.  Machines
are never true inventions, but are combinations of previous design
elements of other machines, merely arranged in new ways.  These new
assemblies of ideas then become the models for further development.  The
ultimate ancestors of all machines are copies from the natural world,
which provides the initial models humans copy and expand upon.  If you
find this idea interesting, you\'ll want to read George Basalla\'s _The
Evolution of Technology_, a popular and influential book (it has been
translated into more than 15 languages, last time I talked to the author).
