What is the rule regarding hardpoints on small craft/spaceships?
I know it says that you are only allowed one per 100 tons of craft
volume, but that seems awfully small for me.  Anybody modified this
in their own games?????

Also what is space-worthiness of small vehicles.  The reason I ask
is I was trying to implement some small vehicles to be used to transport
marines (translation: pirates) to a smaller ship for boarding.  The ships
would also be used for additional fire support during boarding actions.

The reason I ask is that I was under the impression that there is some
penalty for ships that do not have standard Manuever drives.  Since
20 tons is the smallest available hull tonnage to have a manuever drive
ships with M-Drives is not an option....

If anybody could help me out and explain this stuff to me please do..

2247-2299  Quest for the Stars

As the United Nations\' second fifty year plan for space
exploration and colonization came to its completion, science
teams around the solar system raced to find some answer to the
mass-deficiency syndrome which held back interstellar travel.
Finally, in 2247, the Bourns Corporation announced its successful
development of the hydrofunnel, a device by which hydrogen could
be captured in the deep of space. Several companies including
Aster and MDC began licensing production rights in lieu of the
2262 summit. There, a whole host of interstellar vessels were
commissioned for service. The quest for the stars had begun.
   To cap off the century in 2299, radio transmissions were
received from researchers on Alpha Centauri. A primitive
ecosystem had been discovered on the small world orbiting within
the primary\'s habitable zone, reinvigorating ancient hopes and
fears that human beings might find intelligent life in space, or
vice-versa.


2273-2334  Problems in Space

To the exasperation of scientists, not all of humankind\'s efforts
in space were fruitful. A combination of inexplicable failures
and oversights gave pause to the U.N. space program while
corporations continued to rush ahead. The first signs that Man
had reached his limit was in 2273 when Femm Biolabs announced its
latest breakthrough in the engineering of artificial organisms by
unveiling a whole host of Martian settlers. Although the line
proved extremely beneficial in the early terraformation efforts,
the organisms proved unreasonably hardy and became a bane to the
settlers during the late 23rd century when predatory organisms
were called in to check the population of the pests. The
situation fell entirely out of hand during the early 24th century
as predatory Martian beetles would burrow through the foundation
of domed settlements, exposing the colonists to the hazards of
vacuum.
   In 2306, reports from Alpha Centauri confirmed that Man had
overstepped his bounds when Terran bacteria began running amok in
the fragile, alien ecosystem. By the late 20\'s, the Terran
bacteria had completely usurped their indigenous rivals.
   The final boot fell in 2334, when the UNS Halifax suffered a
catastrophic failure of its hydrofunnel during a routine survey
mission of the interstellar hydrogen clouds around the solar
system. The crew decided by lots who would undergo cryogenic
freezing, hopefully to be later rescued, while the losers
sustained themselves for several years, finally resorting to
cannibalism as their nutrition supplies became exhausted.


2295-2367  Problems on Earth

Despite the colonization and population control efforts of the
23rd century, the population stress on planet was insidious with
a purported demographic summary of sixty billion people by the
turn of the century. In order to combat this problem, the U.N.
began a large scale sterilization movement in 2295 combined with
the marketing of propagation rights three years later. Any
children who were found to have been born without proper
processing after the turn of the century were "confiscated" by
the newly created World Peace Agency. Isolated rebellions against
the policy were quickly put down, and political leaders, many of
them in their 2nd rejuvenation with families of eight or twelve
children, argued that enforcement of these extreme measures were
the only way to quell population growth from bursting the seams
of the world order.
   To compound the crisis already forming, the U.N. initiated a
policy in 2318 of forced deportation and/or cryogenic sleep for
repeated law offenders as a means of humanly screening the
undesirables from society\'s ranks. In 2329, a group of protesters
broke into a cold berth confinement area in order to try and free
the captives. The government responded by shutting down power to
the sector, thereby killing the occupants in the low berths
before they could be freed. This incident led to the London
uprising of the following year in which an additional 1.3 million
people were arrested and cryogenically frozen.
   In 2315, corporations began responding to the crisis by
building colossal "Arks" in which humans could travel
cryogenically frozen for hundreds of years before reaching any of
the various settlements promised to be robotically constructed
before their arrival. Over the next five decades, some four
hundred and eighty million people signed on for interstellar
colonization. However, when compared to the size of the overall
problem, the colonization effort seemed more like the proverbial
drop in the bucket. The vast majority of population relief came
due to the U.N. propagation restrictions, unpopular though they
were, and by 2367 the legislation achieved its benchmark goal of
a fifty billion population level with sustained negative growth.


2336-2419  Medical Renaissance

Part of the reason behind earth\'s population pressures was the
increasing pace of advance in the medical sciences. In the middle
of the 23rd century, geneticists already knew how to modify a
species\' DNA over successive generations to create, in effect, a
new species. The more simple the organism, more available the
model, and shorter the lifespan of the organism, the quicker the
pace this engineered evolution could be carried out. By monkeying
around with hominid DNA in the late 2200\'s, scientists at the
University of Kampala were, in fact, learning a great deal about
human genetics. The subsequent accident in 2292 was said to have
set back the field of research perhaps as much as thirty years,
and the extension of the 2243 ban significantly slowed down the
rate at which science could catch up. Despite these hindrances,
however, corporations carried out secret research off planet,
finally culminating in the early 2330\'s with the development of
broad-spectrum antiviral vaccinations. With the Terran
inoculation of 2336, humankind had virtually licked the common
cold, something that medical experts had only dreamed about for
hundreds of years.
   This event revitalized the medical research profession,
lending new impetus to the fight against human suffering which
had been for so long cheapened and abused by the morally
questionable and occasionally dangerous products of medical
science. Nerve refusion techniques were developed through the
2370\'s and 80\'s, and the first broad-spectrum antitoxin was
introduced in 2419, a virtual cure-all against entire classes of
disease. By this time, however, corporations campaigned openly
for the right to re-initiate genetic research on human DNA
without having to conduct their operations in secrecy. However,
fears over the creation of "superhumans" still lingered in the
public subconscious, and corporate sentiments failed to turn over
this legislation.


2374-2470  Resurgence of Religion

With the interstellar exploration and colonization well underway,
the popular media began anticipating the contact of intelligent
alien life forms while prominent scientists began staking their
reputations on the prospect of first contact being just around
the corner. However, "just around the corner" never came, and as
radio transmitted reports of lifeless planets and primitive
bacterial ecosystems came back to earth, the scientific opinion
began to waver. It seemed as though humankind was very much alone
in the universe. The initial evolutionary steps were simply too
difficult and improbable to support a "teeming universe"
hypothesis.
   The outlook seemed so bleak that scientists reversed their
stands, now questioning whether there was any intelligent life
other than humankind, and if not, then what fortune led to the
rise of sentience on Earth? This philosophical climate led to a
resurgence of religion, Pope Joseph IX declaring from his lofty
pulpit in 2374 that after hundreds of years of struggling, men of
science had finally arrived to the true knowledge which was
always offered them by God. Each new "negative" discovery seemed
to confirm this statement, and Catholicism found billions of new
converts who hoped to cash in on the gift of immortality just as
the human race had cashed in on its "gift" of the Universe.
   However, with the resurgence of religion, so came a new
division among people. While the majority of the world\'s people
moved toward monotheism, and Catholicism in particular, several
of the eastern nations diverged, holding true to the more ancient
eastern faiths. These deep rooted differences combined with a
yearning for independence from U.N. dictates led to open
animosities between the eastern and western nations during the
early 25th century. Unrest continued to ferment until 2443 when
Xao Ti Xang defied United Nations authority by funding human
geneticists from the Humanix Corporation and allowing the
development of super-intelligent humans in China.
   This open schism over the nature and course of human
development generated terrorist actions in China during the
following two decades which were countered by bacteriological
offensives against supporting nations. An estimated twenty
million people died in these reprisals, leading to further
escalation of the crisis when the Catholic Pope declared a holy
war against those who would play God. This militant Catholicism
led to the outbreak of the Yama bug in China in 2467, however
advances in medical science managed to exterminate the dreaded
virus, through only after a death toll of 570 million. Rather
then respond in kind, the Chinese government unveiled the Lu Yueh
virus in 2470, an engineered suborganism capable of mutating
itself beyond even the reach of the broadest antitoxins. The Pope
called for courage, continuing to demand that the heathens leave
the devices of life and death to God alone as the United Nations
Secretary General demanded a reunion of the global alliance at
any and all costs.


2470-2471  Harbinger from Nessus

So engaging was the new world-conflict, that when news of the UNS
Erik\'s discovery of a somewhat more advanced ecosystem on New
Amsterdam reached Earth in 2447, the Terran media scarcely took
notice. It thus came as a fortuitous coincidence that in 2470,
just as world war seemed imminent, radio transmissions reporting
startling discoveries on Nessus reached Earth. Nessus, a world
emersed in what appeared to be an artificially produced
greenhouse atmosphere was literally strewn with ancient ruins. It
appeared, for the first time in human history, that humankind
might not be alone in the universe after all.
   As the United Nations poised on the edge of an invasion,
reports continued to come in about explorations to the planet\'s
surface. From initial data, it appeared that the Nessusan
civilization had simply faded away, as if each and every
individual had suddenly died without cause. Some alien specimens
were found in cryogenic suspension, but died during the thawing
process. By a careful analysis of the raw data, it was finally
determined by Terran geneticists a year later that the society
had fallen victim to some form of biological germ, something too
advanced for the explorers on Nessus to detect since they were
still using outdated technology. Ironically, where the explorers
lacked knowledge they seemed to lend wisdom, the immortal words
of the Alien Archeologist, Dvitro Xerxes, streaming as particles
of radio light through the vastness of space, piecing together
the final whispers of an alien people who died some forty million
years before humans learned to build fires. This harbinger to
Earth\'s own imminent destiny proved so power that support for the
U.N. invasion of China immediately collapsed.


2443-2568  Genetic Evolutions

When corporations were finally given free reign to develop a
super-intelligent human with the full backing of the Chinese
government, genetic engineers flocked to Beijing from all over
the solar system. The resources put into the project were
enormous from the very beginning, however, unlike Dr. Eski, these
researchers had no naturally evolved genetic model upon which to
base their work. Therefore, the quest was likened to a grope in
the darkness, when after numerous attempts, science had as its
best example of experimental success produced only a colony of
sterile, psychotic deviants.
   Humanix was finally bought out by Femm Biolabs in 2470, during
the uncertainty of the mounting U.N. invasion. Femm immediately
diverted corporate resources toward the physical manipulation of
the human species, something which was considered far more
attainable by science, and the decision proved successful in 2502
with the unveiling of water-breathing sapiens who, though
genetically fragile, were nonetheless capable of reproduction.
   Japanese and Australian opposition to the creationists finally
caved-in to business pressures as new corporations raced to
catch-up in what soon became known as the Race of Evolutions.
However, just as anxiety had grown three centuries earlier when
the prospect of a race of superpeople loomed in the mind of
ordinary man, so was there a resurgence of activity from various
fronts attempting to regulate the flow of government sponsored
research dollars as U.N. Articles were instated effectively
enslaving the newborn species even as they arrived.
   Between 2510 and 2568, a plethora of human variants reached
the market, one adapted for cold weather, another for extremes of
heat, another with the ability to soar by the use of wings, and
still others, often created as midgets, with little more than a
dog\'s mentality and often purchased as household pets. Progress
on the intellectual side of the genetic coin was finally achieved
in the 50\'s and 60\'s with the development of super-intelligent
children whose increased learning ability and pre-implanted
knowledge threatened standard humans on a more psychological
level. However, the majority of these creations were non-viable,
unable to reproduce as does a true species, though, with time
geneticists promised that they would learn the secrets of life
itself, not merely of its modification.
   However, whether unfortunate or inevitable, the proverbial
excrement finally hit the spinning rotor-blade in 2565 when a
scientist defecting from the More Perfect Human Corporation
stated to the media that a psionic child had been born. Suddenly
faced with the prospect of mind-invasion and a whole host of
alien mental powers, anti-creationist groups gained increased
political power, finally forcing the passage of a U.N. Resolution
in 2568 declaring Earth a standard-human zone. Individuals could
either apply for special wavers to harbor non-standards or move
off-planet. This resolution put a virtual stop to the
creationists who relied on government sponsorship for a majority
of their research and development and on the Terran consumer for
a substantial market. In an attempt to continue the rally, the
Chinese agreed to sponsor psionic research off-planet, however,
in 2576 the U.N. extended its 2568 resolution to the entire solar
system.

*chuckle*  Too late!  I re-designed the Leviathan months ago, long before I
went ftp-spelunking in the archives and found the other version.  Leviathan
always one of Steve and mine\'s favorite ships, so re-creating it under
MegaT was one of my high priority design jobs.

    I am, however, happily lifting any and all designs I find in the archives
or floating by in new and old TML bundles.  I never would have the time to
design so many ships, and I never would have thought of half of them.  (In
particular, I never would have invented the Sword Worlds Overlord Heli-carrier.
Is it just my imagination, or does that thing bear more than a passing
resemblance to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier?)

    Hmmm, well, I tend to feel that is dependent on the economic situation,
and is not something that should be hardcoded into the design sequence.  Let
me put it this way: what you say holds true if the supplier has monopoly; in
a competitive situation, prices will lower as production costs lower.  Compare
the prices of a PC today with the price of an IBM PC at date of introduction
in 1981, or worse yet, with that of CP/M machines (Gawd, I\'m dating myself!)
a couple years before that.  Not only that, compare the capabilities of 
a "standard" PC (386SX, 1 meg memory, 40 meg HD, VGA) with that of a "standard"
PC then (8088, 64-128K memory, 1 360K floppy (actually introduced with 1 
128K floppy), and monochrome text-only).  Capability has gone up and prices 
have gone down!  In a purely market-driven, competitive situation, this is
what will happen.  Personally, I think either prices are fixed due to collusion

between the megacorps and the Imperium, in which case small yards will offer
better deals just to get a slice of the action, or free market conditions
rule, in which case prices should probably be figured as they are for Vargr
worlds -- different each place.  You could calculate them randomly, or 
somebody could modify them for trade classes, etc.  However, given that we
want some baseline "book value" for our starships, said "book value" should
at least represent the actual change in value of things due to technological
improvement in the item itself, and in the production process.

Scott Kellogg:

    There are various bizarre reasons why the price of American military
equipment is artificially high.  These have to do with the high R&D costs to
secure a government contract, and the need to recover those costs even if
Congress or the Pentagon decides to cut off the production run after 1
plane/ship/tank has rolled out of the factory; the often very short production
runs (how many Kennedy class aircraft carriers are we building?) that 
disallow any of the advantages of mass production; and so on.  Perhaps
you could represent these factors by disallowing the 80% discount from any
military craft that aren\'t produced by the thousands.  Or, you could rule
that my modifications do not apply to military production.
    I tend to look at ship design from the point of view of building civilian
and Scout service vehicles, rather than Navy/Army/Marine stuff.  From the 
non-military point of view, the pricing is completely cock-eyed.  You compared
the cost of a B-2 to a starship; compare the cost of a small Great Lakes
freighter to a starship.  A long time ago, you all discussed the fact that
a Free Trader can barely make bank payments, let alone enough to let the
owner retire in comfort.  No real conclusion was reached.  Let me point out
that in the real world, people don\'t start businesses that they don\'t expect
to make money at; and if they fail, 100 other people don\'t immediately follow
in their footsteps in the same business.  For the MT universe to function as
depicted, starships must be profitable to own and operate, or there will be
no interstellar trade.  The problem is, as written, the profitability of a
merchant ship DROPS as size increases.  I now turn this post over to Steve,
who has been sitting in a corner quietly running numbers through a 
calculator.

Steve Higginbotham:

Cynthia mis-states the basic problem - profitability decreases as PERFORMANCE
increases.  A free trader (jump-1, 1-G) will be MARGINALLY profitable even if
your free trader is 5000 displacement tons.
HOWEVER, let\'s look at the basic unit of passenger transport in the Imperium -
the Tukera long-liner (why is it the basic unit?? because the various published
information about Tukera over the years all say so.  In the Core, there are no
other passenger ships.)

A Tukera long liner (Type RT) costs 247.08MCr.  Therefore it requires an
initial investment of 49.4 MCr.  Note that if this money were deposited into a
bank at 4.5% per annum, it would earn the owner MCr 2.223 per year.
The starship owner must make the following payments (per year) : 

               ship payments : MCr 12.354
               maintenance   : MCr  0.247
               crew salaries : MCr  0.144 (approximately - this is the most
                                   variable part - salaries are a function of
                                   skill levels, among other things)
               life support  : MCr  2.500 (this cost requirement is silly, but
                                   the rules use them, so I will, too)
               insurance     : MCr ??? (let\'s ignore this, or subsume it into
                                   the ship\'s payments - too many variables)

               total         : MCr 15.245

The ship\'s revenues are as follows (with various loading assumptions listed)

               passengers : (100%) : MCr  8.400
                            ( 90%) : MCr  7.650
                            ( 75%) : MCr  6.250
                            ( 60%) : MCr  5.100

               freight    : (100%) : MCr  3.247
                            ( 90%) : MCr  2.922
                            ( 75%) : MCr  2.435
                            ( 60%) : MCr  1.948

               Totals     : (100%) : MCr 11.647
                            ( 90%) : MCr 10.572
                            ( 75%) : MCr  8.685
                            ( 60%) : MCr  7.048


Notice that the best case assumption produces losses of MCr 3.598 per annum.
I personally disbelieve in the 100% assumption.  I prefer the 90% assumption,
since I believe that there would be more ships running the route if there was a
higher demand, and I disbelieve that the ship was created with the EXACT size
to move the people that want to be moved all the time.  However, I digress.

Using the 100% assumption, at the end of the mortgage period, the ship-owner is
in debt to the tune of MCr 193.32.  With the ship payments removed, that debt
will be cleared in 22 more years.

So, at the end of 62 years, your starship will BEGIN to make money for you. 
Note that this discounts the need to amortize the debt induced over the years. 
If that assumption is made, the ship will break even after 75+ years.

After that, the ship will make the owner MCr 8.755 per year.  Since the
effective life span of a ship is about 100 years (source : old Traveller),
the ship will make the owner MCr 332.7 over it\'s lifetime (IF he has a full
load EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE 2500 FLIGHTS.

Over the same period, the owner would have made MCr 3981.073 by putting the
initial investment in the bank at 4.5%.

I have never heard of an investor getting rich by putting his money in a
savings account.  I have also never heard of an investor getting rich on an
investment with a LOWER return than a bank (by a factor of SEVEN).  I can\'t
even recall ever hearing of an investor who MADE an investment like that
twice.  I suspect that they are all collecting Welfare now.

In fact, that analysis can be applied to EVERY merchant ship ever designed for
MT.  Virtually all J-3 ships will tend to suck up money for generations.  MOST
J-2 ships will also.  Given that the J-2 ships are primarily passenger ships,
with adequate stewards, they can come out slightly ahead.  They don\'t come out
ahead of the savings account, but that is someone else\'s problem.  J-1 ships
will mostly make a little money.  They even make more money than a savings
account.  Not quite so much as most Money Market accounts, but, again someone
else\'s problem.

Note that fuel costs were ignored in this discussion.  It can be demonstrated
that it is more cost-effective to buy fuel at a starport than to use wilderness
refueling.  Therefore the profits indicated will never actually be achieved by
a ship.  ALAS!

Cynthia has just suggested that passenger/freight fees could be raised. 
Possibly.  In a normal economy, doing so would encourage local development of
resources, rather than interstellar trade.  More people would stay home, and
ships would be in worse shape than ever.  Besides, there are indications that
the Imperium regulates passenger/freight fees to the existing levels.

As to the suggestion that the starships operate by spec trade rather than
freight consignment, this IS possible.  It is also possible (probable, in fact)
that the smart investor will buy the stuff up WITHOUT pouring money into a
starship, and ship it as freight.  Let some other fool lose money by buying a
ship.  There will always be idiots who go broke doing this, who can be milked
by an alert investor.  Note that in the case of a subsidized route, the
government is the idiot in question, and the populace is the entity being
milked by the alert investor.

Therefore, most investors will NOT invest in a starship, which will lose them
gobs of money, but rather make use of someone else\'s starship (so someone else
can lose gobs of money, while you MAKE gobs of money).  There is every
indication (from the tables) that only a small ship (400 tons or less) can make
any significant amount of money by spec trade.  Significant in terms of
starship payments.  If there was that much money to be made, Tukera would get
an exclusive contract, and the profit to a starship owner would vanish.  

The upshot is that no ship will ever make enough money to convince the buyer to
buy it.  So either there are NO ships, or the government buys and runs them
all, to the detriment of the private sector (read: PCs).  Or we lower ship
costs.  Which we did.

Notice that in the Vargr Extants, ship prices can be as much as 30% lower than
normal.  This might lead one to suspect that virtually all ships are made in
the Extants, or that there is a major black-market in Vargr ships (if the
Imperium tries to control ship prices at that arbitrarily high level).

Actually, in the real world, roughly 2/3 of all small businesses fold
within three years, because they weren\'t profitable.  I\'ve been told
that the single biggest reason for this is that they expected to make
a profit too quickly, and hence didn\'t have enough starting capital.

>The problem is, as written, the profitability of a
>merchant ship DROPS as size [Jay: actually performance] increases.

Actually, this was a problem that I saw back in the original Traveller,
and have corrected every time I was GM (and in most games I wasn\'t).
Basically, it would be more consistant to charger freight and
passengers for distance, rather than jumps!  In the real world airlines,
the cost of a ticket is related to the fuel used by the planes.
Real world freight charges are for distance.  In special cases, fast
delivery costs MUCH extra.

In the traveller case, a ship that goes Jump-6 distance should get
the same base rate if the ship is Jump-1 capable or Jump-6 capable.
Actually, the Jump-6 ship should get a premium for certain types of
cargo (anything which is time-specific); even without the premium,
it has fewer expenses and can make more distance during a year than
a Jump-1 capable ship.

I haven\'t run the numbers, but even with this system (but without
a premium for faster delivery), I\'m not sure that a J-6 ship would
be the most profitable.  It would have much less cargo space, due
to increased fuel and engine sizes.  I have the feeling that the
most profitable merchant ship would be around J-3 or 4, but that
is mostly guesswork.

[Please forgive me if I am wrong about how freight charges work; the
GM who ran the only MegaTraveller game I was in told me this was
the way things worked, and he had never seen the original Traveller.
I figure if he thought it worked this way, he read it in the rules.
I do know that it worked this way in the original rules, and I thought
it was stupid then.  Please email any flames.]

There are several things that have been missed in the discussions of the
levels of technology in the Imperium.

First, and most important, is that you must always bear in mind that the
Imperium has an extremely diverse range of cultures.  I have been considering
writing an article about it, but I\'ll summarize my ideas here.  We know that
there are forty-two branches of the human race, each of which possesses several
cultural strains within it, which have their roots in their pre-stellar
histories.  These cultural elements, in most cases, have not completely died
out, and many human cultures continue to develop and thrive.  Most such
cultures are dominant on only a handful of worlds each.  Some minor human races,
the Darrians, for example, have a wider influence.  The two most widespread
human cultural traditions are, of course, those of the Solomani and the Vilani.

Now, each of these cultural traditions carries with it a complex of attitudes
toward the nature and purposes of technology.  The Imperium has developed
a super-culture, which is what we generally think of when we talk about the
Imperium, but this super-culture is participated in by a relatively small
number of Imperial citizens:  the nobility, officials of the Imperial
government, members of Imperial services (the Scouts, especially), and
merchants.  Most others do not have the need or resources to participate in
this super-culture.  But I\'m digressing.

The Imperial super-culture is made up of many disparate cultural elements, but
especially of Solomani and Vilani elements.  And we know how radically different
the Solomani and Vilani attitudes towards technology are.  The Solomani tend
to believe that technological advancement is inherently good.  The Vilani tend
to be much more suspicious of technology.

You can see the effects of these disparate attitudes manifested in many ways
in the Imperium.  There are High Stellar worlds distributed throughout the
Imperium.  But most TL 16 worlds are in Massilia sector--the rimward side of
the Imperial core.  Old Expanses sector has, if I remember correctly, more
TL 15 worlds than any other Imperial sector.  Vland sector, on the other hand,
has a wider distribution of technology levels, and several subsector capitals
aren\'t even in the High Stellar range, though Vland sector is the longest-
settled sector in the Imperium.

The difference between Solomani and Vilani attitudes is even more striking if
you look at worlds in the Solomani Confederation.  MOST WORLDS IN THE SOLOMANI
CONFEDERATION ARE HIGH STELLAR!

According to the World Builder\'s Handbook, by Tech Level 10, it is possible to
create cities in ANY environment.  Thus, in a sense, there is no need for
technology more advanced than TL 10.  Thus, I think, the Imperial attitude,
growing out of the Vilani attitude, is that it is a waste of effort to raise
the level of technology on a world above that required to meet the conditions
of that world.  That technology does continue to advance is due to the
neccesity of possessing the latest military technology, and the universal
desire for better medical care, as well as the Solomani tendency to love tech
for its own sake.

BTW, I suspect that an additional consideration is that worlds in the Imperium
tend to desire considerable autonomy and self-sufficiency.  The Solomani 
Confederation is willing to sacrifice self-sufficiency for nearly universal
high levels of technology.  This, I believe, made it relatively easy for the
Imperium to reconquer the Solomani Rim in the Solomani Rim war, and relatively
difficult for the Solomani to seize Imperial worlds in the Rebellion.

2568-2597  The Beanstalk

With the 2568 U.N. creation of a standard-human zone around
Earth, advancing biogenetics was effectively forced off-planet,
causing the displacement of tens of millions of highly educated
corporate personnel. With the sudden influx of out-world traffic,
combined with the industrial, service, and clerical personnel who
were sure to follow, the U.N. stepped up plans for the renovation
of the world spaceport, culminating in the construction of what
was to become popularly known as the Beanstalk, a ground to space
station over seventy thousand kilometers in overall length.


2597-2663  Unearthly Plunder

With the beanstalk\'s finalization in \'97, space imports grew at
an alarming rate, flushing out entire earth-bound industries as
the use of "mutant" labor gave off-world firms a competitive
advantage. Mitsubishi invested heavily in offworld trade and
transport, sinking considerable assets into a major corporate
gamble. During this period, samples of alien bacteria and
primitive lifeforms began appearing on earth. Some were sold for
research, but others were distributed through the black market to
wealthy collectors for exorbitant prices.
   Although most of these organisms proved less hardy than their
Terran equivalents, wide-spread outcry resulted concerning the
public\'s protection. Following the discovery of an advanced
ecosystem on Darwin IV, the U.N. instated the Orbital Quarantine
Command as a protective measure against the infestation of alien
organisms. However, the passage of the Nakamura Resolution in \'63
caused the OQC to evolve into a protectionist trade barrier,
crippling off-world industry from doing business in the Terran
market.


2663-2710  Foundations of Anarchy

With the close of the Terran market in \'63, competition between
off-world corporations intensified eventually forcing the
interstellar conglomeration of what was to be known as the big
three: Mitsubishi, Aster, and Femm. By the turn of the century,
the tensions of trade competition threatened to spill over into
open conflict. Fleets of war vessels were built, and each
conglomerate controlled its offworld business as though it were a
separate nation-state, creating it\'s own laws and effectively
ignoring the edicts of colonial governments. The ice finally
broke with the Martian ultimatum of 2710, when the Aster
Corporation charged Femm with contract violations in the joint
terraformation project. Due to political interests, both parties
refused U.N. arbitration, but instead set-up a private
arbitration council consisting only of non-Terran interests.


2710-2741  Open Defiance

With the success of the Martian accords, the terraformation of
Mars, Venus, and Titan which all began in the early 23rd century
neared the completion stages. However, the inner-system
importation of "mutants" in the early part of the 28th century
led the U.N. to threaten police action for the violation of the
standard-human zone. Aster and Femm agreed to submit the issue
for arbitration, but only to a non-Terran arbitration council.
The U.N. refused to agree to this condition, and sent warships to
enforce its will. Before they arrived, however, Femm\'s public
affairs office, on Earth, threatened the release of undisclosed
biological contaminants if the Terran warships reached their
destination. The threat was later proven a bluff, but it gave the
big three time to organize fleets within the solar system,
resulting in the 2nd Martian accords of 2741.


2741-2872  The Corporate War

The 2nd Martian accords saw a cessation of U.N. domination of the
solar system and a loosening of quarantine restrictions with a
corresponding collapse of Terran trade barriers. However, the
accords also brought Mitsubishi to its knees with the
domestication of its Earth-bound facilities which came under the
control of the newly formed Terran conglomerate. Despite this,
however, Aster and Femm continued to grow in power, waging a
trade war against the untested Terran Corporation until
Mitsubishi managed to claim reparations for it\'s domesticated
facilities. It was, thus, clear that the megacorporations were
acting as a single economic entity.
   The quasi-peace was short-lived, however, as within a decade,
news arrived from Durhael, one of Earth\'s most distant colonies,
that the shattered core of a nova had been discovered. This news,
though unheralded by the mass-media, carried extreme weight with
the scientific community, as it was hypothesized for several
centuries that the eka-metals (heavy elements) to be found within
such an astronomical find could be used to tear the "fabric" of
multi-dimensional space at the subatomic level, in effect,
opening the possibility for faster-than-light travel.
   Although technically owned by the Terran Corporation under the
2741 accords, the Aster corporation was in a far better position
to claim the find as it\'s own, and this is exactly what it did.
In order to protect its position, however, Aster began a conquest
of the entire arm leading to Durhael. Noting the opportunity to
rid Terra\'s influence in corporate space, the Mitsubishi and Femm
conglomerates jumped to Aster\'s side, their offensive sweeping
the entirety of Terra\'s immediate colonies, culminating in the
decisive corporate victory in the battle of Osgiliath in 2872.


2794-2911  War Technologies

The Corporate War led to the hastened development of mutant
technologies, when in 2794, Femm geneticists located the psi-gene 
and later incorporated psionic attributes and biocybernetics in
its infamous line of mass-cloned Okuma war-mutants of the early
29th century. The 2830\'s saw major breakthroughs in artificial
sentience, and various degrees of self-aware computers were
deployed in Aster\'s Shambler series of self-replicating predator
vessels akin to the Von Neumann robotic miners of the 23rd
century. The discovery which ended the war, however, came in
2852, with the Mitsubishi-AI\'s derivation of the famed Deagol
equation which, utilizing Eka-metals, actualized hyperspace
travel as a technical hypothesis. In a joint venture with Aster,
Mitsubishi developed the technology during the late 50\'s, and
actual starships were in deployment by the middle 60\'s.
   Several spin-off sciences were either invented or
serendipitously arrived at during the following decades,
including the rudiments of matter transportation during the late
80\'s, genetic reconstruction of the 30th century\'s first decade,
and the anagathics discovery of 2911.


2887-2969  Post-War Exodus

After the conclusion of the Corporate War, the big three began
consolidating the conquered territories, driving out the smaller
independents and monopolizing huge chunks of the colonial
economy. Psychohistorians predicted a future war far bloodier
than the Corporate War, this to be fought between the big three
with a sharp trend toward political-economic centralization
during the interim. A symposium of wealthy industrialists met on
Terra in 2887 to discuss these economic developments and
psychohistorical prognostications, and a coalition of
independents was formed the following year, the focus of the pact
turning toward a mass-exodus of the colonized regions.
   Plans were made, and the exodus began with the departure of
the Ash in 2909, which carried over a million cryogenically
suspended colonists. Other vessels departed over the following
six decades for various systems in the Persei and Cassiopeiae
clusters. The project finally failed in \'69 due to the bankruptcy
of its sponsorship.


2969-3130  Total Producer Monopolization

With the failure of the Exodus Fund in \'69, it became apparent
that the ultimate goal of the big three was total market
monopolization. By the 80\'s, even Earth was not exempt from the
trends, the Terran corporation finding itself slowly crushed and
later purchased at bargain rates by Mitsubishi in 3010. Standard
human labor was largely replaced with mutant slaves from the
frontier, and by the turn of the millennium, billions of Terrans
were effectively selling themselves and their families into the
same corporate institution which had deprived them of their
livelihoods.
   During the next hundred and twenty years, the Aster-Femm-
Mitsubishi conglomerate carried out a meticulous campaign of
isolating and destroying the millions of smaller independent
firms which still remained, finally officially merging into the
AFM Corporation in 3130. The three controlling families became
intertwined by a series of arranged marriages, and the ancient
institution of nepotism became a model for ensuring the future
peace.


2981-3210  Age of Wonder

The era of peace gave rise to many new sciences as AFM\'s separate
components competed against each other without traditional
government restraints. Thus, although there were tremendous
technological advances, the median standard of living actually
declined during the period, leading to urban unrest which was
largely contained via brute force techniques employed by the
corporate authorities.
   During this period, teleportation and hyperspace projection
technologies became widely utilized as forms of transportation.
Communication technologies evolved to encompass a wide host of
FTL-particles, making interstellar communication next to
instantaneous. Finally, the first Tau-fields and pocket universes
became realities.
   However, with the rapid pace of technology, a great deal of
power fell into the hands of those with the most direct control
over scientists and knowledge-based resources. Thus, corporate
power became more and more decentralized as individual upper
managers and groups of middle managers combined resources in
several ill-fated attempts to overthrow the ownership and seize
control of AFM or to create breakaway divisions under independent
ownership. As always, the corporate response was as ruthless as
it was decisive.


3210-3223  The Tomorrow War

What followed the Age of Wonder is perhaps the least understood
period of history. Apparently, an era of terrible warfare between
the corporate divisions erupted sometime in the 35th century, but
spread backwards in time, to the year 3210. This was the year to
which the Mitsubishi Division, in its dying gasp, sent a
prototype starship capable of travelling through both space and
time. The starship, named the Mitsubishi Maru, was expected to
arrive before the discovery of alternate temporal realities and
to destroy Asterian and Femm research centers, thereby creating a
timeline in which Mitsubishi might rule all of humanity.
   However, another vessel followed the Maru backwards through
the temporal continuum, this one named the Asterian War Dragon.
The two vessels met several times in battle until 3216 when they
destroyed each other in a fiery climax. The captain of the War
Dragon, nicknamed "Draconius" by the war\'s spectators, survived
the final battle and was appointed admiral of the Asterian fleets
a year later. With the war now ignited, the corporations
continued to fight until 3223 when Mitsubishi was finally forced
to submit unconditionally.
   Returning to Terra, Draconius turned against corporate
ownership in a surprise bombardment of his own victory parade,
assassinating each member of the ruling family in a single
stroke. The attack left a vacuum of power, to which Femm\'s
management could only have a single response.


3223-3309  Mutant Rebellions

The Femm Corporation had never had large war fleets. Instead of
technical hardware, it concentrated on the manufacture of
biological organisms. However, within each organism it produced,
it created a sort of emergency-lever which could be pulled via
the application of trace amounts of a specific chemical. Once
pulled, the organism would be psychologically transformed from an
obedient slave into an insane killing machine.
   Thus, the 3223 assassination of Femm\'s ownership saw the
beginning of the Mutant Rebellions and the corresponding
breakdown of corporate government into total anarchy. Over half
of the human population perished during the first ten years of
the rebellion as Draconius used his fleets to crush one outbreak
of violence after another. It wasn\'t until the middle of the
century that the cause of the rebellions was even understood, and
not until the 80\'s that antidotes were synthesized. The fighting
finally ended in 3309, with over nine-tenths of the human
population slaughtered during the interim.


3309-3516  Period of Recovery

The next two centuries saw a slow period of recovery as Draconius
"entitled" old AFM executives and their families with large
provinces while charging them with various duties including
social welfare, economic recovery, maintenance of the peace, and
the administration of justice. This policy saw the foundations of
Imperial bureaucracy and the caste system within which it became
rooted, resulting, ultimately, in the coronation of Draconius as
Emperor in 3516.

automatic weapons.  There are several ways to handle auto fire weapons.

1) Increase the chance to hit.
     This is how Azhanti High Lightning and Striker handled them. Since
     these form the basis of ranged combat in my system, I\'d been planning
     to use this.

2) Increase the damage.
     To simulate the effect of multiple hits.  A popular way of handling
     automatic weapons in other games systems.  Tends to make them very
     deadly.

3) Allow multiple hits on the target, rolling seperately for each one.
     This is perhaps the most accurate way, but you pay a cost in playing
     time.  It can also unbalance the game -- if you allow a player to roll
     10 seperate attacks for a burst from a gauss rifle, the target is
     almost always going to be chopped into hamburger.

4) Determine to hit normally, and then determine a percentage of shots that
     hit the target.  This could be done with a seperate roll, or as part of
     the to-hit roll.  Mark Cook and Iain Fogg use this in their Firefight
     rules.

None of the above inherently disallow some mechanism for hitting multiple
targets, either deliberately or accidentally.  Shotguns and flechettes might
or might not be handled the same way as automatic weapons.

Play testing has resulted in some mild dissatifaction in the current system.
Does anyone have any suggestions or strong feelings on this?

     Another meaty post...I wish I had the time this week to respond to
everything, but I don\'t.  As a result, I\'ll just hit a few high points.
Is there any possibility that you could upload your ship designs including
the price both with and without variant calculations?   That would make
life easier on everyone, as those of us who might be inclined to use some of
them can do so without needing to refigure the cost.  Similarly, I try to
make sure that all of my uploads contain enough information to allow people
to undo my variations in the designs without extensive recalculation.  As
someone who doesn\'t do these things on a computer (except for the word
processing part) avoiding recalculations is always a high priority..(-8.

     Personally, I try not to get too worked up over some of the lacunae
in the design system.  Clearly, things like computers ought to get better
as TL increases, on about the same scale as communicators.  But as long as
all vehicles are designed with the same handicaps, I don\'t worry about it.
Now something like Scott\'s Indianapolis series fusion rocket fighter planes
are another matter entirely...COACC doesn\'t fit in well with the Ref\'s 
Manual, and we\'re still casting about for easy fixes that allow previous
work to be used (and new work to be submitted in the \'standard\' format for
the benifit of those who disagree with our changes.)

     Regarding starship economics (and business economics in general):  It\'s
my impression that lots of people in the US currently go into business 
despite the high failure rate of small businesses because of a (misplaced?)
confidence in their ability to \'beat the odds\'.  I can see this factor 
potentially at work in interstellar shipping too, although clearly the banks
would not give you such an advantageous interest rate on ship loans...

     If everyone followed the \'ship on other people\'s ships\' for spec trade,
the demand for cargo space would probably exceed the available supply.  A
lot of the problems with Traveller trade in my opinion come from trying to
keep the system simple enough to use...which I\'d bet is why they rejected the
notion of variable costs for shipping and passages.  As it is, some of my
players from other games have informed me that their GMs didn\'t bother with
detailed trade at all...he/she apparently just rolled dice once in a while
and handed out the money.

     When you advise against a fuel purification plant, are you taking into
account the limited availability of refined fuel and the concurrent dangers
of using unrefined fuel?  This would seem to indicate that you either don\'t
perceive a need to go to a starport of less than class B (or is it C?).

Launch TL13

     This standard design launch is produced throughout the Imperium, pri-
marily as an auxiliary for cargo ships requiring some self-contained shuttle 
capability for use at ports where the ship is not able to land.  As such, it 
is not optimized for atmospheric travel.  The twelve cramped seats which are 
available for passenger transfer are designed to fold down flush with the 
floor of the cargo bay when not required, which increases cargo capacity to 
184kl.  At 160kl with seats extended, the cargo bay can hold 2 Imperial 
Standard 4 ton cargo containers, or 11 standard 1 ton containers. 
     No armament has been provided, nor has space been reserved for the 
installation of weaponry at a later date.

     The Wyvern is a dual purpose design intended to serve as a fast attack 
vehicle and a limited duty near orbit fighter.  It is fully space rated and 
can be ground or ship based.  The Model 3 computer is intended for targetting 
and combat, but the craft can still be flown as long as at least one of the 
Model 0 computers remains functional.

SIE Athelstan Class Merchant TL11

     The Athelstan class merchant ships are presently being built by SIE at 
their corporate facilities at Grote.  The unsettled situation in the Imperium 
has left SIE unable to procure ships from their usual suppliers at Glisten.  
The Athelstan is a modified Type R2 design, and is fairly typical of ships 
built in frontier areas with an integral refueling capability, a maneuver 
drive capable of making a landing while fully loaded on any inhabitable 
planet, and a full armament package.
     Unlike many other SIE vessels, the Athelstan does not ordinarily carry a 
robotic crew supplement since the supply of cheap robots has also dried up.

River class Merchant (Type R) TL11

     The River class merchant conforms to the basic Imperial Type R standards 
with no enhancements.  Designed to be produced and maintained by worlds of 
average technology, it is not really suited to the difficult conditions 
imposed by our current political difficulties.  The base model, as shown 
below, is produced with no fuel purification plant and no weapons package.  
Either can be installed (and often both are), but at a cost in cargo space.  
The control system is sufficient to allow up to MCr9 of weapons to be in-
stalled. The minimal thruster installation does not permit takeoffs or land-
ings on most inhabitable planets while the ship is fully loaded.  As a re-
sult, a launch is carried to provide some limited integral shuttle capabili-
ty.  When sufficient cargo has been offloaded by the launch, the ship may 
land.  Frugal captains usually run the ship with the launch\'s cargo bay 
loaded if possible, which adds an additional 200kl of cargo capacity.

I think random alien generation would probably make about as much sense as
random dungeon generation -- okay for bare-bones framework or perhaps
inspiration, but not for serious use without a great deal of additional work
and application of common sense.  (I _did_ say the results were rather
amusing...well, they were the last time I looked at it, which was probably a
good eight years ago.  I remeber the issue \'cause I liked the short story.) 
But someone asked about it, so I answered; what anyone does with the
information is up to them.  

As far as GURPS stuff goes, I can\'t comment, since I have no first-hand
knowledge of the system.

Striker does two things.  You get a bonus on the to-hit roll, and for every
2 by which the roll exceeds the required number, you get an extra hit.  For
example, to hit with an ACR at effective range requires a roll of 8+.  If you
fire on full automatic, you get a +2.  I roll the dice and get a 9; with the
bonus, that\'s 11.  This is 3 above the required number of 8, so I score two
hits.

> 3) Allow multiple hits on the target, rolling seperately for each one.

As I say, Striker allows multiple hits without separate rolls.  What I would
then do is roll again for any shots that missed, to see if they hit the next
nearest character in the field of fire.  In the above example, the ACR fires
a burst of 4 rounds, of which 2 have been accounted for; the other 2 roll
again if there\'s anyone standing near the main target.  This is effectively
a burst of 2 rounds, not 4, so I\'d give it a +1 DM instead of the +2.  Striker
has a table listing the bonus for a given number of rounds in a burst; it\'s
normally used to find the auto-fire bonus for a user-designed auto-cannon,
but can equally well be used here.

Striker also allows you to specify a group as a target, rather than a single
individual.  In this case, you roll once to hit the group; any hits are
divided as evenly as possible between the members of the group.  I don\'t
recall any bonus for aiming for a cluster of people rather than a single
person, unless you allow the one for target size - in which case a large,
spread out group makes an easier target than the same number of people in
a tight cluster.

That\'s the whole point of using a gauss rifle!  >:-)

  Wars have been fought for many reasons, but history often tends to
show that the underlying causes of the conflicts are often economic.
The other reason can probably be summed up as "ethical" reaons.
A better way to examine most warfare in the imperium might be to
consider it as economic warfare.
  By this I mean that a war is fought to gain the economic
capabilities of the target system/planet; such capabilities as
manufacturing complexes, mining sites, more advantageous jump-route
position, a better starport etc.  At this level, the war might be
considered more of a "extremely hostile" corporate takeover, rather
than a war over (say) ideological differences.  Massive
planet-bombardment assaults wouldn\'t work too well, as they would
destroy what the attackers set out to acquire, or turn the people who
know how to run the equipment against the attackers.
  IMHO, this type of warfare precludes the "take off and nuke the
planet from orbit" solution because it will not be be advantageous to
do so.  Trade embargos and other loss of revenue to the attacking
planet/system might be the result of such action, as nearby systems
are apalled by the attacker\'s action.  Even non-ecomomic (aka
"ethical") military action might be taken against this system
in an effort to prevent such an occurence from happening again.  Even
this action can be considered economic to an extent -- other systems
don\'t want to be nuked.
  
  I\'m not so sure as to what form an actual "economic" war would take,
but I rather think it would be preceded by vast intelligence and
sabotage operations against the target system\'s military and ruling
organizations, followed by a strike to remove remaining defense
installations.  This would be followed by troops and intra-atmosphere
craft to mop up remaining forces and to hold the ground.  Resistance
by the populace would tend to be determined by the differences between
the two cultures -- if the attackers operate their systems as giant
slave-chains, I would forsee massive resistance and guerilla activities
taking place.  (Hmm, I wonder if this means that the type of
war (economic/ethical) to be fought depends upon the difference in
goverment between the two groups -- the wider the difference, the more
harsh the war will be???)
  
This has gone a bit behind my original economic/ethical warfare debate,
and I\'m starting to get into a gray area, so I\'ll stop here and
see what people think about this.

0-129  Age of Reckoning

The mutant rebellions of the 33rd century combined with the
contempt of an educated population for the corporate state set
the stage for the formation of the First Imperium under Admiral
Draconius. However, as the great stellar estates returned to
their corporate masters during the economic recovery, tensions
resurfaced, forcing the inevitable settlement of accounts between
a once enslaved population, corporate management, and the man who
would be emperor.
   Draconius was crowned in A.D. 3516, also the year zero of the
new calendar, during a symbolic ceremony in which his young
empress-to-be, then a palace slave, was accorded the right of
king-maker as a gesture of defiance against the lesser nobility.
The gesture was not taken lightly, as during the Emperor\'s
marriage four years later, an attempt was made on his life,
killing instead his bride-to-be. Not knowing upon whom to
retaliate, Draconius seized the opportunity to execute each and
every member of the noble families while all were present and had
nowhere to flee. The exercise in Draconian justice made the
archaic roots of his name all the more meaningful as he
personally executed the last of his corporate rivals.
   Claiming the wealth and power of his victims via the Imperial
fleets, Draconius mercilessly slaughtered all opposition to his
absolute rule. He indiscriminately butchered entire planetary
populations in the name of his beloved empress, and by the middle
teens, the pervasive anarchy which threatened to consume the
Empire had been successfully quashed. The process of
decentralization began anew, as Draconius called to the upper
echelons of his fleets for his most loyal and capable officers.
To these individuals, he invested the titles of nobility. Large
fiefs and governorships were distributed arbitrarily, in a
fashion which best suited the Emperor alone without consideration
for the regions or peoples to be held subject.
   By the early 30\'s (F.I.), the new order was intact and
functioning. Perhaps to test the bureaucratic machinery,
Draconius began the issuance of royal edicts, the first calling
for an accelerated program of expansion. Production levels were
driven upward to meet the increasing demand, and the median
standard of living rose to all-time highs since the turn of the
Terran millennium making Draconius the most popular and effective
leader in historical memory. No one would foresee that within a
century, his face would become virtually unknown.


129-137  The Reign of Blood

Before the murder of his empress-to-be, Draconius fathered a pair
of paternal twins, Paulo and Athena. The brother and sister were
considered as the two separate halves of their father\'s double
personality, the former: sinister, evil, rash, and prone to
tantrums, the latter: quiet, reserved, careful, and thoughtful. 
   Over the years, Paulo grew impatient with his father\'s rule.
He desired mastery of the galaxy for himself, and in 129, he
murdered his father, seizing the crown and marrying his sister,
Athena. Rebellion broke out almost instantly as Paulo had carried
out his plan without a strong network of conspirators, yet the
ruthlessness with which he crushed the revolt dwarfed Draconius\'
cruelty. This policy of terror and intimidation would
characterize the short remainder of his rule as Paulo lapsed into
a guilt-ridden paranoia which drove him finally into an obsession
to eradicate the memory of his father.
   Paulo ordered that all the images of his father be destroyed;
anywhere the name "Draconius" was written, it was erased.
Anywhere his father\'s memory lay, he would put its keepers to
death. Soon, even if he heard that the name "Draconius" was so
much as whispered on such a planet, all its inhabitants would be
killed. Paulo used all the powers he could bring to bear to seek
out and destroy all who would oppose him in his quest. 
   In a short time, Paulo had canceled every edict his father had
ever decreed, erased every statement, undone every deed,
destroyed every concrete memory he could find of his father.
Soon, he believed, even he would forget of Draconius. 
   Paulo\'s reveled in courtly games of pain and death to relieve
a moment\'s pressure from the enormous task he had undertaken. He
spent long hours developing new tortures of the mind which he
tested on his chosen mate, Athena, and administrated the Office
of Emperor only where it would accomplish his ultimate goal of
erasing the name of his father. 
   Despite his repeated attempts to impregnate his sister in the
earlier part of his reign, Athena never bore him any children,
nor allowed any of her ova for use in an artificial womb. This, a
testament to her own psionic prowess, confounded Paulo with the
greatest anger, and in a fit of rage he abused her to such
extremes that she fell into a sleep of eight years from which
even Paulo and all the Empire\'s sciences could not resurrect her.
He ordered her ova surgically removed, but during the operation
her life signs ceased until Paulo and his doctor\'s retreated. 
   This apparent threat of suicide kept Paulo at bay until the
final year of his reign, when losing patience with her game he
fell upon her pushing her to decide between birth and death,
nevermore allowing her to linger in that nether state she had
created through her Psi talents. For those eight years, Paulo
butchered nearly half of the Empire\'s population, and yet
rebellion seemed a distant hope at best. Paulo grew madder by the
day, until the hour of Athena\'s awakening when she bore him a
baby boy. 
   Seized with joy, he resolved to allow her the tradition of
naming the newborn child. She uttered but one word, "Draconius,"
which caused him to plunge into uncontrollable spasms of anger
and fear. Observing her opportunity, she ordered him restrained
and sedated and put him on Psi inhibitors to control his mental
powers. That day, the people rejoiced, as Athena became Empress.


137-461  Athena\'s Imperium

Athena\'s first act of office was to order Paulo exiled to the
most remote planet in the Empire where she built a prison
especially for her brother. Continually drugged, Paulo now seemed
as helpless as the infant Athena had borne him. Due to the
strange circumstances of its birth, however, the baby Draconius
was greatly feared by the remaining population, and in a gesture
of sacrifice, Athena had her only son exiled to a distant corner
of the Empire and placed on agathic inhibitors to forestall his
development into maturity. The population was placated for the
time being, and Athena began her rule, instituting several edicts
toward the amendment of the Imperial political framework.
   The first of these edicts involved the creation of a Senate of
Nobles who would enact laws with the consent of the Empress. This
proved of tremendous importance, as it ended a long era of
arbitrary legislation and provided the foundation for a firm
legal code. The second of these edicts involved the creation of
the Imperial High Court to interpret law in "cases of magnitude"
for the better consistency of justice. This proved extremely
valuable in centralizing legal authority.
   Over the three centuries of her rule, Athena continued her
father\'s program of expansion, though not nearly at the rate her
father had forecast. She viewed Terra\'s ties to the outer worlds
as already over-extended. Strangely enough, however, she
continued to enforce Paulo\'s will that her father not be
remembered. Over the period of a century, the effort proved
effective with respect to the common citizen, however, an
underground historical society eventually formed which preserved
the memory of Draconius.
   Athena finally consented to marriage in 449, bearing two issue
to the Archduke of Deneb during the following year. Both children
died shortly after birth, and rumors of an assassin within the
Imperial palace circulated among the populace. Athena ordered the
palace psi-shielded and sent a secret communique to Paulo\'s
prison ordering that her brother be executed. By means unknown,
Paulo escaped only hours before the receipt of the message, and
Draconius mysteriously disappeared a short time later.
   Fear of Paulo swept through the masses, and Athena ordered the
suppression of psionics to counter the panic; however, her
actions were too slow in coming, and rebellion ensued from the
Siri (psionic class). For a short period, a movement called the
"Draconian Front" challenged the Imperial Right of Suppression,
borrowing its name from the centuries old censure as a show of
defiance against the Empire.
   Lacking the ability to survive direct battles, the front
relied on piracy and sabotage as its primary arguments, harassing
Imperial shipping and communication routes during the early 50\'s.
However, it lacked the momentum of a full-scale rebellion, and
was soundly defeated at the battle of Aranruth in 456. The
Empress rejoined her husband later that year and bore a daughter
in 457 on the world of her victory. She stayed until 461,
refusing to venture into the spacelanes until she was finally
persuaded by her longing for Terra. There, the Empress and the
Archduke both perished in a surprise attack by pirates.


462-467  The Little Empress

Christine of Aranruth assumed the crown of Empress at five years
of age, almost a full year after the death of her mother and
father in an act of spacelanes piracy. Prior to her ascension,
various dukes of the Deneb clusters, all nephews and cousins of
the late husband to Athena, formed a grand alliance and waged a
siege on Terra in anticipation of the power vacuum soon to
result.
   The ransom of Christine in 462 provided the Terrans with a
golden opportunity for home rule. Thus, crowning the young
Christine as Empress gave the Terrans the legal authority to
summon their defense. Once reinforced, the Royal Navy drove back
the rebels in a gallant victory, but the winds of anarchy were so
easily quieted. As various dukes attempted to win favor and
influence over the young empress, competition to control the
Empire through Christine serving as its puppet figurehead led to
open hostilities among the nobility. This, in turn, resulted in
Christine\'s assassination in 467. She was ten years old.


467-483  Emperors of Doomsday

Before the young empress could even be accorded a proper funeral,
the vacuum of authority left in her wake swept in all the worms
of the muck. Over the following sixteen years, no less than
forty-seven individuals proclaimed themselves autocrat of the
Empire. Each new wave of invaders brought forth a new noble,
admiral, or crackpot opportunist to power. To capture Terra was
to rule the Empire, yet as the entirety of the 1st Imperium
swiftly collapsed into desperate anarchy, numerous duchies
announced their separate independence. Finally, during the Battle
of Doomsday, F.I. 483, 3999 by the old calendar, Terra was
destroyed.


483-1120  The Dim Time

As humaniti entered the fifth millennium, the psychic blow of
Earth\'s destruction carried with its passing an air of
misanthropy. Although without focus, the war continued in
sporadic outbursts for well over century.
   Finally, the economy of the Empire became so depleted and
ravaged by internal war, and the political system so fragmented
and disarranged that no true Empire could be said to exist.
Within the core worlds, a long depression ensued, in which key
industries fell apart, the caste system was destroyed, and
communication and transport between the stars came to a near
standstill. However, near the rim, colonization still continued
and new states were built from the various duchies, kingdoms,
domains, and governorships which remained.
   Humaniti slowly re-established itself during the final
centuries of the Dim Time, however, it was so politically
fragmented that the more powerful states squabbled amongst one
another for greater power and prestige, leading once more to
outbreaks of armed conflict. An interworld trade language soon
arose among the merchant class, facilitating exchange and
communication, and many national leaders found their authority
waning as merchants flocked to the least aggressive and least
trade-restrictive of their counterparts abroad. Since trade
wealth and privateering were still considered paramount to a
state\'s prestige and defense, there was a concerted movement on
the part of all nations to cease their hostilities and to renew
their ancient bonds.


1120-1484  Quest for Solidarity

As nation states became tempered by the economic realities of the
age, the ceaseless forces of political centralization countered
the peace ethic inherent to a re-developing interstellar
community. Ultimately, neither force could defeat the other, and
in 1120, a solution was discovered with the first of several
arranged marriages which would eventually rebind the Empire and
make it once again whole.
   Over the next three and a half centuries, the route to power
was clear. As the fragments of the first Imperium steadily
coalesced into ever more powerful states, political leaders
became increasingly concerned that their progeny should one day
rule all of human space.
   The mergence was completed with the marriage of Prince
Frederick of Omicron and Princess Anastasia of Sol in 1484,
coinciding with the sixth millennium celebrations scheduled over
the entire year. The young couple was paraded before the media,
announcing a new era of peace and prosperity as their families
continued to hold the real power behind the scenes.

This  is the problem everyone seems to be having with interstellar trade,

Well,  if  we  can\'t change the fees, maybe we should look at the problem
from a different angle :  A  highly  skilled  crew  can  make  reasonable
profits on speculative trade...

The  assumptions  behind  this  is  that  there\'s  an unlimited supply of
starships available to transport your cargo wherever you want it  to  be,
but  given  the  costs  and  risks involved, no-one is going to be stupid
enough to run any such ship, let alone a plentiful supply of them.

> 					---- Steve & Cynthia Higginbotham

Somewhere in the Starship Operators Manual (I  think ),  there\'s  a  line
that  may  help  explain  this dilemma - It refers to the *reason* anyone
would be operating a starship in the first place, and says (paraphrased )
that  the  large  company ships don\'t make their profits on cargo, but on
transporting goods for their parent companies. 

Looked at that way, the large companies use large starships because  they
can  get  cargos  cheaper  on some other planet, their passenger space is
used for moving their executives and employees, and  they  just  use  the
\'standard\'  freight and passenger charges to fill up unused spaces, which
wouldn\'t be making them any profit empty. 

The same thing goes for small starships - Ok, so  It\'s  cheaper  to  have
someone  else  move the cargo on their starship, but they aren\'t going to
have a starship in the first place unless they\'re  intending  to  make  a
profit on it themselves by moving speculative cargo\'s.

This  means  there  can be lots of smaller free and far-traders shuttling
back and forth, only taking regular freight when they can\'t  find  enough
speculative  cargo.  The  free  traders  are  there because the planetary
governments want people who haven\'t got access to their own  starship  to
have a chance to make some money too - then they can tax them :-)

As  Steve  says,  there  are  NO ships, at least none that are willing to
carry your freight at a worthless 1000 Cr/ton :

"You want the stuff shifted, get your own ******** starship !"

Unless, of course, I\'ve missed something in the rules about how  easy  it
is to find someone to move your freight for you (sigh). 

That\'s  the  way  I\'ve  always  seen Traveller trade working, but I can\'t
explain the passenger spaces  found  in  the  \'standard\'  designs  (small
traders)  though -  it\'s  easier  to  make a profit by converting it into
more cargo space,  given a highly skilled  crew.  Anybody  else  got  any
ideas ?

> P.S. Does anybody remember the cheap "standard" hulls from Old  Traveller
> Book 2? And the cheap A & B jump drives? Where did those go? And why? 

Yes, I remember them - much cheaper if you  could  fit  what  you  wanted
into them. I guess they just didn\'t fit with the new design rules.
 
Personally,   I\'m   all  in  favour  of  making  the  starships  cheaper,
especially the computers - Price/size per tech level, like  the  rest  of
it.

If we\'re considering action within the Imperium, all bets are off.  There\'s
a thing called the Imperial Rules of War to consider.  These rules aren\'t
written down anywhere, because officially the Imperium doesn\'t approve of
any war within its borders.  Unofficially it tolerates very limited warfare
as being a quick release of tension and resolution of conflict, as opposed
to long, drawn out economic warfare - which I would define as sanctions and
other interruptions of interstellar trade, and which are even worse for the
Imperium as interstellar trade is its lifeblood.

So, the Imperium will tolerate limited warfare.  That\'s how mercenaries make
their living.  It doesn\'t tolerate excessive off-world interference - in
other words, if the invader is capable of taking on the whole planet, it
will probably have to take on the Imperial forces shortly afterwards.

I was under the impression that the invasions being discussed would either be
part of the Frontier Wars, or take place well away from the Imperium (and
probably any other large interstellar organisation).

For merchants operating on a government subsidy, I\'ve always assumed that there
is a government regulation requiring a certain amount of cargo space, since
free flow of people = free flow of ideas = a good thing (at least in theory).

For smaller ships, well, they are they because they have always been there since
the beginning of the game.  They do have the effect of offering a better return
on investment than cargo at 1000cr/ton, and thus might help keep you in \'air
money\', and they have the pleasant effect (for the GM) of keeping the players
worried about hijackings and offering other adventure hooks.  Still, you\'re
quite right...a trader with the right skills would be better off without them,
and I have designed several small \'cargo only\' merchants.

I finally have it figured out.  Note that the server says it is "compressed
and uuencoded".  Well it is.  Rename libdist.zip (after cating and decoding
the parts) to libdist.zip.Z and uncompress libdist.zip.Z.  Then unzip
libdist.zip resulting from this and you\'ll find the files you are looking
for.  Threw me for a loop too.  The server apparently acts on libdist.zip
in a script and doesn\'t recognize or use the new filename after it is
compressed.

Hope this helps.

Hmmm...well, maybe not. (-8.  Still, one way of cutting down ship prices 
for players without worrying about the economy at large is to sell them
a used ship (maybe a a _very_ used ship).  The only trouble with that is
that we don\'t really know how much of a price break we ought to get, nor
what the likely increases in operating expenses (due to increased main-
tenance requirements) or in systems breakdowns might be.  (Unless there
is some article in an old Challenge/TD/JTAS that I have forgotten...)

Does anybody have a system of any sort already worked out for this?

Yes, at least the previous version.  The first problem is that their mail
server sends UUENCODE files with spaces which most mailers truncate when they
are at the end of the line.  I had to append spaces to the end (used an editor
and put a M in the last column).  Then I could uudecode it.  At that point,
PKUNZIP didn\'t want to have anything to do with it.  However, there is a
Windows Unzip that did process it.  I have a version that is working.

Sprinter Cargo ACV TL8

     The Sprinter is designed to carry cargo or vehicles over calm water at 
high speeds.  It is comparatively expensive, and sees little actual use 
save as a high speed landing craft in various Maritime Forces.

Absolutely.  I don\'t have Striker here at work, but in AHL, after rolling at
the target, any attacks that miss the target attack everyone along the line
of sight, until it hits someone, or misses everyone.

I had forgotten this as well.  How well does it work in practice?  Some
Striker rules work better for full-scale battles than for the sort of small-
scale gun play most commonly seen in Traveller games.

No, that is the niche filled by the Subsidized Merchant (the ones the
Government pays for and runs).  They provide the grunt service for all those
investors without a starship of their own.

The free/far trader guys are the ones who go to the bank to ask for a loan:

Capt Helsson (free trader captain wannabe):  "Sir, I would like to borrow
MCr30 to buy a starship."

Mr. Carcharias (vice president in charge of the Loan Dept):  "Well, that\'s
fine.  We like to see young people go into business for themselves.  Can you
show me your business plan, please?"

Capt Helsson:  "Well, sir, I was planning on gambling on my inherent genius to
come out ahead in this operation."

Mr Carcharias:  "Hmmm...  Why don\'t we talk about this AFTER you can show me a
detailed plan to make enough money to pay us back.  We don\'t normally
subsidize trips to Vegas to play roulette."

<  later  >

Mr Carcharias:  "well, sir, it is good to see you again!  What can I do for
you today?"

< capt Helsson hands Mr Carcharias business plan.  Mr Carcharias studies it
while Helsson talks. >

Capt Helsson:  "Sir, you asked me for a business plan.  I have one here.  I
have information that the new source of pharmaceuticals in District 268 will
produce a large, steady demand for starship transportation to markets.  As you
can see, my plan is built around the idea of purchasing the drugs on site, and
transporting them to markets to exchange them for goods the producers need
<blah, blah, blah............>

< Mr Carcharias sets down plans and smiles broadly >

Mr Carcharias:  " well, that is good news.  This is just the kind of plan we
like to see before we release our money into a long term loan.  And, if your
estimates are correct, you should be able to pay the loan back within 15
years.  That really is well thought out, sir.  we shall, of course, have to
process the paperwork, which should take no more than a few weeks, but I can
assure you that your loan will be approved as written."

Capt Helsson: < rising >  "thank you, sir.  I really appreciate that.  I\'ll be
back to sign the paperwork as soon as it is completed."

Mr Carcharias : < also rising > "Sir, it is a pleasure.  My secretary will
call you within two weeks to finalize the agreements."

< Helsson leaves >

Mr Carcharias:  < to secretary > "Doris, can you ring up Thor Tukera for me,
please?"

< phone rings, Carcharias answers.>

Mr Carcharias:  "Thor, I just heard a reliable rumor that there is a lot of
money to be had in a new route down in District 268.  If you could release a
few long-liners to duty there, we could make a bundle.  And, as a bonus, there
should be several nearly new merchant ships, all quite well designed,
available there in the next few months.  Quite reasonable prices, too, I
should think...  Of course I\'ll send the details to your office, this very
afternoon.  Good talking to you, Thor.  BTW, what is my dividend on my
personal Tukera stock expected to be this quarter?  That high?  EXCELLENT. 
Good day, Thor."

Mr Carcharias:  < to Doris >  "Please expedite that young man\'s application,
Doris.  We wouldn\'t want to disappoint him.  Or Tukera."


Notes:

	1) If a good spec trade route already exists, a major corporation will
have it tied up solidly.

	2) Ownership of the major mega-corporations is so interlocked (source:
MegaTraveller) is so interlocked, they might as well be considered to have
identical interests.  This includes Hortalez et Cie, THE major banking
interest and source of starship loans in the Imperium, as well as most lesser
banks.

	3) Purely local banks are unlikely to finance a purchase involving
removal of the borrower and the collateral some months travel beyond their
reach, which is why Hortalez is the main source of starship loans.

	4) Assuming your business plan is based on speculative trade, it will
mostly likely be a newly profitable route.  If the route continues to be
profitable, in the long run Tukera or a similar large shipping firm will
undoubtably move in and take it over.  

	5) Given: you have to explain your route to the lending agency.  Given:
the lending agency is a part-owner or is owned by Tukera or other major
shipping firm, it is not unreasonable that the lending agency might inform its
parent of any potentially profitable leads that it acquires.  A secret shared
is no longer a secret.

	6) It is also not unreasonable that the lending agency will make a loan
in spite of the fact that it knows that no profit will be made and the
starship will be repossessed.  This is because they can then sell the starship
to Tukera or whoever at a breakeven price for the bank, and at a considerable
profit for Tukera.  The only loser is the poor schmuck who got the loan.

	7) This happens in the real world.  In the U.S., we have Anti-Trust Laws
and insider trading regulations, etc to prevent this sort of thing.  However,
indications are that the Imperium does not interfere in business to that
extent, especially since the imperial family and the high nobility are
significant stockholders in said megacorporations.  Expect such scenarios to
be even more common in Margaret\'s Imperium.

	Again, the upshot is that, given the *present* pricing scheme, in the
Imperium, most commercial starships will be owned by the government in the
form of subsidized merchants, or government-protected in the form of
megacorporate ships.  Is this the picture of the Imperium that you want?

  {
    'body' => '    In the course of discussing wilderness refueling, Rob Dean brought 
up the question of "Why does the starport charge to fill the fuel tank
from a hose (water = unrefined)?"  (Paraphrased).

Steve and I discussed the question and decided to share our thoughts with
you.  
	1) A free trader uses 165,000 gallons of water (tank of unrefined fuel)
at a cost of Cr 4,644.  We haven\'t checked local water prices lately, but
certainly running that much water through your meter would cost you a fair
fraction of that amount (more in California), ignoring taxes and connection
fees, overhead for the high-capacity water system the starport uses, and, if
it isn\'t water, but ammonia, that you\'re using for unrefined, it\'s cheap at
the price.

	2) Most worlds with any kind of government at all insist that you
land/dock at what\'s called a "Port of Entry" so local Customs & Immigration
can make sure you\'re not bringing in anything they disapprove of and pay
duties and tariffs on the stuff they do approve of.  In which case, the
starport has a captive clientele and will charge all the market can bear. 
This, by the way, explains why you don\'t just land on the beach and drop a
hose in the ocean; if you do, lots of impatient, armed people from the local
equivalent of the DEA, the Coast Guard, Customs & Immigration are going to
want to know just WHY you thought it was a good idea to bypass the legal Port
of Entry....  And, if the world\'s law levels are high enough, the local Air
Defense Command might use your ship for target practice.  (Remember that
Soviet version ADC that got into trouble for letting that light plane land in
Red Square?  And DIDN\'T get into trouble (internally, ignoring world opinion)
for shooting down KAL 007?)

	3) On worlds with a lot of traffic (any Hi Pop world), what passes for
Traffic Control might get a little upset if you just start improvising your
own landing paths (to stray bodies of water).   So will the previously
mentioned Air Defense Command.  I don\'t know how it works outside the US, but
if you violate FAA regulations (i.e., ignore landing directives from Traffic
Control) they fine you heavily, and maybe revoke your pilot\'s license.  I
already mentioned what ADC\'s have been known to do.


							-- Cynthia & Steve

P.S.  If you thought to stop in the ocean and refuel on the way OUT, the
authorities might want to know who you were meeting and what you are carrying
that you had to bypass the normal Export controls....

0-359  Challenges to the Young

Although the marriage of the Solian and Omicronian heirs brought
about the existence of the 2nd Imperium, the splendid coronation
of year zero lacked one vital ingredient of Empireship, that
being a central ruler. The prenuptial agreement between Anastasia
and Frederick, which served effectively as articles of interim
confederation, left the actual reigns of authority to their
grandparents until a child should be born, later centralizing
authority and stabilizing the Empire. This, however, was
unlikely, for although the young couple met under fair
circumstances, family differences quickly tore them apart.
   Remaining married for political purposes, Frederick returned
to Omicron shortly after the "ordeal" in order to oversee
industrial growth and reaffirm his family\'s power in the region.
Mangled during the Dim Time, Omicron\'s primary agenda focused on
centrality of control with limited growth. Sol, on the other
hand, pursued a policy of exploration and conquest, spreading its
dominion across the stars and claiming more territory than it
could effectively administrate. Therefore, Omicron maximized a
policy of focused industrialization, while Sol spent its
resources on traditional priorities such as colonization and
expansion; and while a compact Omicron was easily controllable,
Sol\'s colonies, primarily in the Perseus Arm, became increasingly
rebellious. 
   Anastasia set up two strong rival governorships in order to
handle the situation locally in the interests of Capitol. Her
idea was that neither would rebel because of the other\'s
existence, yet both would be very capable of quenching internal
rebellion because they would both be close to their problems. The
outcome proved disastrous for the untested Empire. Neither of the
two governorships recognized any rivalry. They held the mutual
interest of independence against a common enemy, and through
intensive cooperation they realized their interests with the 341
Declaration of Independence of Persei and Cassiopeiae, beginning
fleet maneuvers to prove the sincerity of their intentions.
   Angered that her hand-picked governors had turned traitorous,
Anastasia began recalling naval forces from the far reaches of
the Empire back to Sol to be overhauled, refitted for battle, and
sent off to punish the traitors and reincorporate the
governorships. However, the entire process of preparing for a
major war took far too long to implement, and as soon as the
local guard was pulled off other worlds, they too began to talk
of independence. A new Draconian Front slowly emerged, calling
for the cessation of Imperial domination of outworld states.
Although the name was no longer suppressed, it did serve as a
reminder of the Reign of Blood, eliciting support from otherwise
neutral parties. 
   Anastasia was forced to withdrawal her plans of attack and
shift the focus of the war campaign toward the solidification of
her rule. The Draconian Front was eventually stamped out, but
only with the realization that the Solian half of the Empire had
drastically over-extended itself. The Omicron half of the Empire,
on the other hand, was compact and stable, and in the interest of
preserving failing relations, Frederick ventured to Sol to make a
rare visit with his wife in 354. The visit, scheduled to last one
quarter of a standard year, ended up lasting three, and a prince
was born by the name of Richard. Frederick left to settle affairs
back at Omicron, but two years later he returned to stay. With
this decision, the seat of Omicron\'s government had been moved to
Sol, and with this act the two kingdoms became fused into one
Empire more-so than ever before.


359-491  Good King Richard

Throughout the remaining years of their reign, the happy couple
did very little in the area of their administrative
responsibilities. Leaving the reigns of government to Richard,
their son, they spent the following years taking adventurous
incursions into the outer sectors. In 383, their convoy was
raided by pirates, and both were killed in the resulting battle. 
   Richard assumed the throne as soon as word reached Capitol,
and continued the work he had already made himself accustomed to.
His reign can be characterized by the overall leniency with which
he ruled and by his great charisma which won victories in a more
peaceful fashion than those of his predecessors. He was probably
the most well-loved Emperor ever; certainly, he has been the most
missed. 
   Richard turned over even greater Imperial power to the
Archdukes, further decentralizing the Empire and making its
administration more practical and convenient. He formed a Senate
of advisors which took actual power in the detailed planning of
central goals, and he refocused the energies of government to
rebuild the agricultural worlds\' production capacities especially
along the Betelgeuse and Spica fringe which had still not
completely recovered since the Dim Time. He reformed the
relationship between big business and the state, allowing greater
corporate independence from Imperial strictures on noble
ownership and anti-monopolization, but less freedom on
stakeholder reparation issues and matters concerning
technological development.
  Richard conducted the first complete census of the 2nd Imperium
and published the data in the Encyclopedia Galactica which he
created as a permanent storehouse for all knowledge. He opened
diplomatic relations with Persei and Cassiopeiae which flourished
into a trade partnership and later a cooperative alliance.
Perhaps most importantly, he allowed more states on the Imperial
periphery to attain practical independence, and he granted
independence to the Archduchies of Caprissa, Tigris, and Epsilon
Aurigae, emphasizing the need for peaceful cooperation between
states, rather than warlike competition.
   Richard was also somewhat of a scholar and philosopher of the
other social and political systems which had suffered to exist
along the Imperial periphery during his reign, and in 490, he
became so enthralled with democracy that he outlined a plan which
would have over the course of the next two-dozen standard years
gradually formed the Empire into a democratic republic while
simultaneously granting independence to the Archduchies of
Scorpio, Herculese, Athens, and Nu Cephei. His "Grand Plan"
outlined seven free Duchies and seven Democracies of the new
Imperial Republic (Sol, Omicron, Betelgeuse, Spica, Rigel, Deneb,
and York). In effect, he was offering to step down from the
throne for what he believed would be the long-term good of his
people. However, his plan was never put into effect, as he died
the following year in a starlanes accident leaving the Empire to
his oldest son, Stephan.

492-499  The Civil War

Stephan, saw things very differently from his father and often
argued openly with Richard on matters of state and the
suppression of inevitable rebellions. He vowed that if he should
come to power he would militarily strengthen the Empire rather
than weakly submitting to colonial demands. When he finally
became Emperor, he attempted to do just that; however, the moment
was already lost and the power of his office, greatly diminished
during Richard\'s reign, proved too weak to take control of big
industry and wrestle back the periphery for direct Imperial rule.
   During his first year, Stephan was always at odds with the now
powerful Senate. He dared not dissolve the body, or he would risk
rebellion from every front, but he did take the privilege of
retiring senators and replacing them with his own friends, a
practice very much set against the tradition instated by Richard.
   By the middle of 492, the seven "Free Duchies" sent identical
statements to Stephan, demanding a continuation of Richard\'s
Grand Plan. Stephan flatly denounced the plan as an old man\'s
folly and began preparing his military to reincorporate the lost
territories including Cassiopeiae and Persei. Nu Cephei invaded
Deneb and Epsilon Aurigae invaded Spica later that year.
Caprissa, Tigris, and Scorpio quickly organized their defenses as
Athens invaded York with all her forces during the early quarter
of 493.
   Sol organized a defensive front along the Scorpio border where
her forces stood for the remainder of the war facing the enemy
but not attacking while Stephan called for Omicron to send
reinforcements to help defeat the rebels. While not participating
herself, Omicron allowed Betelgeuse to send minor reinforcements
to aid the effort in Spica; but the assistance was far too little
to be of substantial benefit to the Imperial cause, and Spica
eventually fell into rebel hands. 
   Rigel invaded rebel Caprissa in the late of 493 as Deneb
halted the Nu Cephei invasion, and by the end of 494 Deneb was
chasing the remaining Nu Cepheian rebel forces all the way back
to Tigris. In 495, Herculese having just finished quenching
internal uprisings, entered the war on the side of the Empire and
invaded Athens from her back door. The Athenian forces were
immediately recalled to a defensive front as York and Herculese
pounded them from both sides. 
   In 496, reinforcements from York relieved the Deneb forces and
carried on the war in Nu Cephei and Tigris. Deneb moved its
attention to the defeated Archduchy of Spica, still in rebel
hands. Another year of fighting only produced a stalemate; but in
497, Deneb\'s remaining border forces attacked Epsilon Aurigae
directly. The shock produced a rebel withdrawal from
three-quarters of Spica. 
   By the middle of 498, Athens had fallen, but Persei,
Cassiopeiae, and the Outworld Coalition (at Herculese) were
preparing to enter on the side of the rebels. Both sides were
weary of war, and Omicron still hung on the sidelines like a
vulture waiting for the best moment to enter and snatch its prey.
Afraid of losing the upper hand, Stephan called for a peace
conference to get out while he was ahead. 
   In 499 the conference met and signed a peace resolution.
Scorpio, Epsilon Aurgigae, Caprissa, Tigris, and Nu Cephei
suffered a rearrangement in their borders which was to an
Imperial advantage in return for Stephan\'s recognition. The
empire suffered the severance of large regions of space from the
Archduchies of Spica, Rigel, and Athens for the purpose of
creating independent states and buffer zones in return for the
rebel states\' denunciation of Richard\'s plan toward
democratization. Despite the fact that war could have been waged
by both sides for several more years, the conference settled on
this compromise, as victory for either side seemed too uncertain.


500-656  The Modern Era

After 500, Stephan began an industrial reconstruction,
particularly in Rigel, Deneb, and York which were all hard-hit by
the war. Appointing his son-in-law as the new Archduke of Athens,
he executed the old family in 504 and paid a special visit to the
Archduke Constantine of Herculese a year later, personally
thanking him for not turning traitor as did the other six of the
"seven free Archdukes" and for playing so critical a role in the
defeat of Athens. He then visited Omicron in 509, supposedly to
admonish the Archduke there for restraining the requested aid. To
the surprise of the citizenry, he had the Archduke executed but
allowed the family to live with its eldest son instated as the
new ruler.
   The trade agreement with Cassiopeiae and Persei, which was
discontinued at the start of the war, was reordered and extended
to the border states. In 510 he had Omicron funnel aid to help in
military reconstruction as he began reinforcing the borders along
Sol, Deneb, Rigel, and York to protect the coreworlds from rebel
invasion.
   In recent years, Stephan has gained a strong hold over the
Imperial Senate\'s sub-bodies and has moved toward a large
military build-up in the Imperial Core primarily around Sol,
Rigel, Deneb and York heavily taxing or seizing control of the
megacorporations in order to finance his projects. Anti-Imperial
sentiments have risen especially high along the Imperial
periphery as both sides prepare for resumed armed conflict.

rules were written for old Traveller and definitely should be
redone. My interpretation of the rules is that it cost 1000Cr/t for
freight, Cr10000 per High passenger, Cr 8000 per Middle pass etc
only for a Jump-1 in any direction. For longer distances I use a
sliding scale of (0.5*Jump distance) * J-1 + J-1 cost. So a J-2
freight costs twice as much as J-1 , while J-3 costs 2.5 times J-1,
while J-4 costs 3 times J-1 and so on. The TAS high passage
compensates you for only the first Cr10,000 of your journey.
Consider it a frequent traveller support service instead of a
freebie. It makes more sense to me that way.  

Again consider the charge rates a guideline and players could
charge within +/-50% and could be given a +/- modifier in the
amount of passengers/freight they generate. It makes trade a little
more profitable and sensible. I also use the passengers rules
differently. I assume that a middle passenger will have to share
his stateroom with another middle passenger. It makes more sense in
that how would you undo a High passage room to a Mid Passage?
Besides a Stateroom is capable of holding two people so it makes
sense in that a High Pass is travelling 1st Class while Mid Pass is
travelling a little cramped in Business Class. Low is well...
Economy. 

Looked at this way a J-4 ship gets to a location 4 parsecs away
atleast 4 times as faster as a J-1 ship and costs 3/4 of what a J-1
ship would charge. Thus there is some economic sense to upgrading
jump drives from the shippers point of view.

I think they\'ve stopped taking new subscription now. They\'ve decided
to sell the journals as sourcebook type thing, it will be published
bi-annually. each cost something like $10.

  My *current* (there has been many:) favourite is the way Twilight2000 handles
it: Roll a d6 for every shot fired on full auto, every 6 is a hit on the target
for that burst, halv the remaining dice and roll, every new 6 is a hit on a
secondary target, roll the remaining non-6 dice from this last roll, every
6 in this roll is a hit on someone *moving*. Range is treaded as decreasing
the number of rounds.
  (Twilight allows for multiple bursts in the same phase, but at penalties.)

  All in all, except for the way it handles the to hit rolls for single shot
fire and the unearthly amounts of damage everyone can absorb (The average Joe
can take *a number* of average 9mmP rounds in the head before dying...) it
would be really nice...

	Although many TMLer\'s do seem to have military experience for those that
don\'t there seems to be some misunderstanding of autofire.  When a weapon is 
fired on auto many people believe that only a percentage of the bullets will hit
the target.  This is true but probably only a percentage of the FIRST few bullets will hit.  I will give the basis for this below:

	When a weapon is put on auto and fired at a target the weapon will tend 
to "junp" (for lack of a better word).  Once it has started to jump in one 
direction it will tend to continue to go in this direction as long as it 
continues to fire.  This is why most rifles made for armed forces around the
world now have a "burst" selection instead of "auto".  Case in point the M16A2
has a 3-round burst setting.  This is because after the first 3 shots the weapon
is usually so far off its intended target as to make the following shots "useless".  Although in the future gyrostabalization will probably compensate somewhat
for this, it will still continue to be a problem in projectile weapons.  So I
will show you the rules I give for this particular situation.

	First: Determine the number of rounds fired on auto-fire during the
combat round.  For those that wish to truly represent realism, if a player 
wishes to stop before all the ammo is used up add some randomness.  For any
amount of shots over 10 if the player wishes to stop have them roll 2d6.  One
to determine whether they stopped before or after they wanted to, and one to
determine the number of shots high or low.

	Next:  For very shot over the first the to-hit roll is at -1 cumulative.
for stabalized weapons, or -2 cumulative for non stabalized.  This really 
represents how hard it is to keep an auto-firing weapon on target (known from
3 years of experience).  Continue to roll until there is NO chance for a hit.
Occasionally they won\'t hit until the first or second time but this can easily
be explained as poor aim at first.  Example:  Bob fires at Jim but shoots a bit
to the right, however the weapon travels left and hit him on the 2nd and 3rd 
shot.
	Now we get into those nasty missed shots.  These can be discarded in an
open field but not a crowded area.  Although some players might think of this as
simply gore and boredom added to the scenario, in campaigns, players who are too
messy with their "hit" jobs will get a lot more heat.  Not only will the players
be in trouble for the murder (or maybe assault) or the target but also of the
people standing around them.  Killing a known pirate will probably get the 
players a little sympathy but not if they also accidently killed 7 by-standers
and wounded 12 others.  Oops, sorry about that, back to the rules.  Roll for the
missed shots against another target normally.  If it hits go back to the auto
fire rules but after a miss don\'t roll again.  After all it is unlikey the 
player is trying to bring his aim back on them.  As for missed shots, when an
area is pretty empty simply roll once any more than that and roll more times up
to 5 or 6 rolls for a really crowded area. 

	I added these rules simply because a lot of times players think it is
easier than it is to shoot at a crowd and only hit one person than it is.  
Firing into a crowd, even to hit only one target, will 90% of the time will 
bring multiple deaths.  This works the same with grenades.  Although these rules
may seem tiresome they tend to make the players much more careful about wielding
weapons with such zeal.  And make enemies who do use them as such seem much more
villainous, making them much more important to hunt down.  Thank you.

  Granted, partially. However, it may be possible to take out the Atlantis
sized ships with ramming drones. Does it matter how much damage the Meson-T
can do on it - anything short of "Ship Vaporized" will still propel a drone
at a high speed into the ship. Black globes MAY be the answer, but the
arguments about these were held and held and held. Say about 40 unmanned
20 displacement ton drones would do the trick?

  I assume the following - Steve Kellog suggested a possible way to
obliterate (or, at the very least, heavily damage) any planet by a single
Type S scout. This is a tactic employable by any starfaring nation. The
only possibility is to have it mutually proscribed, the same going for
planetary bombardment to destruction. Otherwise - better not speak, eh?

  With the widespread usage of rapid-firing laser guns (say, the Traveller
equivalent of the 10Mw pulse laser) infantry - mounted, dismounted or with
grav-belts - shall become very vulnerable. A phalanx arrangement of ten or
so vehicles, carrying three to five such guns will probably deny the area to
anything but other vehicles.

  Area denial is granted, space denial is not. If there is precious little
infantry, artillery shall almost disappear.

Here\'s an idea I tried just to see if it could be done.  A Tech 8 robot.
All the elements and programs are manufacturable at TL8, but I ran into
trouble when completeing the design.  The maximum robot intelligence at
tech eight is negative 3 according to the design evaluation tables.

So this robot is assumed to have it\'s brain architecture designed at
tech 12, but built using local materials at Tech Level 8.  If you don\'t
like that idea, the unit is equipped with a slave unit allowing external
control.  The ECM would make certain that it remains under control
provided that the attacker is not too sophisticated.

	The Picadore warbot is more properly classified as a remotely piloted
vehicle.  As such it is used by artillary spotters.  Though many would doubt
its intelligence and not trust its target verification programming, it has
been sucessfully used along side troops as fire support.  In such cases, the
friendly forces must wear an infrared transponder.  The active IR detector
in the Picadore interrogates human targets for a correct code before opening
fire.  Friendly vehicles must be programmed into the unit or they will be
fired upon.
	Because of its low intelligence, it is rarely used in such cases and
is more often used as a raider to cross the lines and cause havoc.  As such
it accels.  It is as well armored as a man in battledress, much stronger,
much cheaper, and Much more expendable.
	It has been known to be used by Special Weapons arms in police forces.
In such cases its actions are overseen by a trained operator.  Though it has
no demolition skills of it\'s own, it is often used in bomb disposal, again
overseen by a trained operator.
	Designed at tech level twelve for manufacture at tech eight, The
Picadore was mass produced in the Spinward Marches by several small
manufacturing firms during the Fifth Frontier War.  They saw limited use in
that conflict.  At the conclusion of the war, the existing models were sold
to low tech planets as artillary spotters.  Though manufactured at tech eight,
few tech eight planets have existing maintainace facilties for the repair of
robots and they fell into disuse and were finally abandoned by many such
planets.
	Then the black market got a hold of them.  Mercenary Companies are
known to have Picadores in use, and there are several cases of armed robbery
committed by Picadores under criminal control.  While they are not outright
illegal, their use is heavily restricted and liscenced.

Steve and Cynthia have pointed out just how testy customs and airtraffic
control can be about ocean dipping.  Well, I don\'t have my books in
front of me, but I seem to remember that most planets will allow ocean
dipping.

	Admittedly there may be cases of what I call \'UltraLaw\', where
the starport either has been bribed by the fuel refining companies, or
the port is a company and needs to show a profit in its fuel selling
account books.  Or maybe the government is just excessive.
	In these cases ocean dipping will not be allowed, but I would
say, that if you call the tower and request a vector for ocean dipping,
they will allow access.  At higher law levels they may require the ship
be searched first in case of smuggling, but remember that the vector is
to be assigned by the tower, not the ship, they may be allowed to dip
fuel from a location just off the bow of a coast guard cutter.
	The US is not a case of \'UltraLaw\' yet.  You can still fly without
a flight plan, land anywhere you want to, refuel from anywhere you want to.
Admittedly, there are Coast Guard planes out there watching for \'special
cargo\' DC-3 Dakotas headed north from Columbia, but once they land in the
US they can pretty much do as they please.  Thus, I would say, that once
your cargo has gone through coustoms, chances are you can land anywhere
you want to if you clear it with the Tower.  (I seem to remember a planet
in the Trav Adventure that required special forms to do so, but the planet
was a Huge Beaurocracy ie \'UltraLaw\').
	There is also the case of desert or near desert planets.  I believe
the old Spinward Marches Supplement said Dipping was not allowed on planets
with a hydrographic percentage of 30% or less.  (It might be 40%)

	I think that the Soviet Frontal Aviation and the attendant Soviet
Beaurocracy is a good example of \'UltraLaw\'.  (I\'m not sure, but the last
I heard that young German pilot who landed in Red Square is going to be
there for life...)

	Striker sort of started out explaining how strong various military 
organizations were.  The _Rebellion Sourcebook_ does have a list of pop. vs.
tech level listing how many battalions of infantry are probably present.
	Combining information from Rebellion Sourcebook (\'_RS_\') and from
Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium, we can get some good estimates of
fleet sizes.  Quoting from para 1, pp. 27 of Rebellion Sourcebook;
	"FLEETS
	Each sector of the Imperium theoretically has a group of
fleets numbering about 1000 ships.  This number includes combat 
vessels such as cruisers, carriers, battlesships, and some
escorts; it does not include auxilliaries, support ships, and scouts.
	...
	NUMBERED FLEETS: The Imperium has about 320 numbered
fleets (Approxomately one for each subsector within the empirt).
A numbered fleet, depending on its mission, may have
between two and 10 squadrons amounting to between 50 and 200 ships. ...

	Note the listing of combatant squadrons only.  The \'some escorts\'
descriptor in the first paragraph above indicates that they mean the 5-20kton
escorts from FSSI, not minor sub-kiloton escorts.  Presumably, if you include 
the smaller ones, they number about as many as larger vessels do.
	So, now we need to determine what makes up a \'Squadron\'... looking at
FSSI, we find a BatRon (Battleship Squadron) normally contains 4 Battleships,
or a battle tender and four riders.  A CruRon has about five cruisers and about
as many escorts.  A carrier-type CruRon (fighters) usually just has the
carrier itself.  These are not hard and fast rules, but generally accurate.
	There is also mention that they tend to collect like-typed ships into
squadrons.  Having done a bit of organizational work, it looks to me as if most
squadrons will have been more mixed than that suggests.  I can bet that they
are organized along lines of similar jump capability and similar maneuver
capability.  (It makes little sense to put a J-3 BB-12 with a bunch of J-4
battleships, but a J-6 BS-15 might make sense.  Simmilarly, if most of your
major warships are M-2, a M-1 one will slow the rest down, but a M-4 one will
add a bit of flexibility.)

The Fifth Frontier War game also doesn\'t correspond too well with the
"official" history, in that it doesn\'t take long enough.  In "reality",
the war lasted about 4 years (1107-1111), and ended in a negotiated peace
with little shifting of borders from their pre-war positions.  In the
game (at least, whenever I play it), a big reinforcement fleet appears on
turn 6 (Rimward reinforcements, or something like that - a whole lot of
colonial-grade squadrons and troop units).  Shortly after that, the Sword
Worlds gets flattened.  The Imperials get their reinforcements in small
lots which build up somewhere safe until they reach a suitable size, then
go looking for something big and blue to clobber.  The war tends not to last
long after turn 52; if the Zhodani haven\'t won a complete victory by then,
they get completely defeated instead.

As for battalion sizes; perhaps the Imperium subsidises some worlds to
create larger defence forces, or penalises some worlds for having too
large forces.  I don\'t know what the discrepancies are, but a creative
referee should be able to figure plenty of excuses.

Can the ramming drones be destroyed or disabled with lasers or missiles?
If not, they count as "something that can take out those 5 Atlantis class
battleships".  The point I was making was, if even one of the battleships
can make its way to the invasion area, the invasion is in big trouble.  I
was not commenting on how you stop them, only that you need to do so, as
opposed to just going round them (outmanoeuvre and perform a planetary
landing).

In other words, for some reason, the attacker can not/does not want to destroy
the defender totally.

The same can be said nowadays about machine-guns.  They\'re why the infantry
tends to ride around in APC\'s.  Even so, there is still infantry around.

Greetings everyone,

This may seem a rather stupid question to some, so please indulge
my ignorance or the possibility it\'s been discussed here before.

I was thinking the other day about the possibility of using plas-
tics in the construction of starships, that is the external hull.
Given the weight ratios between "standard" metal  structures  and
their  plastic  counterparts, would it not be more fuel-efficient
to use plastics and thus benefit from  any  weight  savings  that
might accrue ?

I then thought to myself, "Well, what would happen upon free-fall
re-entry  ?  Fried  plastic  blob  hits deck at G ?" Perhaps not.
Wouldn\'t it be possible to shield the ship using good ol\' ceramic
tiles a la Space Shuttle ?

Then the problem of aging occurred to me.  Plastics  age  through
photo-chemical  reactions  caused  by  the interaction of natural
phenomena (sun, wind, rain, local soil etc.) with  the  plastic\'s
own  atomic  structure  (plastics-  or  organic chemists - please
shoot me down in flames if this is a misconception on  my  part).
This  can  be  useful,  for example when designing bio-degradable
plastics,  but would surely be an undesirable trait in  plastics-
for-space-vehicles  purposes.  Given that UV light (which clearly
lends a hand in the aging process) is shielded  somewhat  by  our
atmosphere (unless you live in Antarctica, that is), wouldn\'t the
situation be that much worse in vacuum where  no  such  shielding
takes place ? I suppose solving this problem might help solve the
next ...

I remember hearing years back that all plastics are, to a greater
or  lesser extent, porous.  Is this true ? How could this be com-
pensated for or, preferably, eliminated when considering  plastic
vehicles ?

Note that I didn\'t consider strength as a factor in my reasoning.
Why  not  ? Well, I reckon that a ship-asteroid collision at some
of the speeds frequently discussed on the TML will turn both ship
and  contents  into  so  much blackberry jelly no matter what the
ship\'s made of. Comments ?

If these thoughts aren\'t pure fancy, it gives rise to the follow-
ing possible scenario :-

Punter enters local branch of "Spaceships R Us". Asks  about  the
possibility of purchasing a brand new 1,000 ton trader. Slick and
somewhat greasy salesman says, "Certainly, sir. You need the  La-
zlar  Lyricon  (sp ?) model. Only 17 zillion credits or $ 1.98 in
Revell kit form".

Looking forward to some replies.

All the best, everyone.

Hugh.

Greetings and Salivations from the vargr historian. For those of you who
found a bit of trouble printing the first tmap, it should now be okay
for a greater number of postscript printers.

As before, you can find it in the pub/ucrgg directory of the following nodes:

It has also been donated to sunbane (129.100.100.12), but how soon
it replaces the old version is still up to Dan Corrin, the site admin.

Now it\'s time for Bill the Aslan to say a few words:

    'body' => 'I wasn\'t doing much this weekend so I decided to check out some of
the warship designs that have been submitted on this list. After
Steve Higginbotham\'s "Sikkinthar" and "Aenoegrr" class ships, I
felt rather humbled and obligated to support his premise. So I
decided to check on whether his assertion had any validity. Steve\'s
assertion being that 8 of his Sikkinthar class (7ktons) could
destroy a Atlantis class (1 million tons). 

What I found was rather amusing. Actually it would take only 5 to
do the job. This got me thinking on whether any of the other
capital ship (20ktons + ) were any good. I found that in general
they were not. It seems that most of these warships were built with
the "bigger is better" mentality with no regard to their actual
effectiveness. Before I go into further details let me point out a
few things that I noted:

1. Most capital ships were heavily overarmored, overpriced and very
vulnerable to meson weapons. Most designs would be LESS vulnerable
to ALL weapons if they were LESS armored. 

2. I do not know if anyone has actually done any large scale combat
with these starships( or any other starships tonnage > 20 kt) in
large numbers. I have a feeling that the designs would be a lot
different if they had done even rudimentary tests. If someone has,
it would be of great benefits to the "architects" to know its
results. 

3. There were hardly any capital ship designs with PA spinals, yet
there were lots of ships with armor > 60. Similarly there was a lot
of use of the TL 15 50 ton factor 9 missile bay but NOONE used the
more effective 100 t factor A missile bay. 

4. It seemed to me that the rider/tender vs battleship controversy
is now decided firmly in favor of the rider/tender. A 100,000 ton
tender brings far more spinal mounts to bear than a 200,000t
battleship. And when both sides have armor 60+ than the battle is
decided by who is nimbler and with more spinal weapons. 

5. Steve Higginbotham\'s designs assume a standard 24/72 cruise
endurance with a 1/3 peak power endurance. For those who may have
played large scale capital ships battles, a question. How realistic
is this figure? It seems very suitable since all my battles were
over in 2-5 rounds (40-100 min). 

6. I think the Imperial requirement of warship specs should be
amended as follows. 

Imperial warships should be J-4 with a cruise endurance of 21/63+.
Cruise implying constant 2-G accel (1/3rd power) with all noncombat
systems powered and some offensive and defensive systems powered. 

All warships should be capable of 6-G, Agility - 6 and all
weapons/screens powered at peak powerplant output. The endurance
for this peak performance being atleast 1/3 days. 
I will also recommend that all Imperial warships > 100,000t be
battle tenders. The reasoning for this will become clear soon. 

7. As an interesting aside, the requirement for armor becomes lower
as ship size increases. A 100,000t ship has less need of armor than
a 20,000 t ship. 

All the following assume standard MT vehicle construction rules:
All die rolls are assume craft at long range for combat purposes.

After one round of combat Atlantis was destroyed by 5 SDB. 2 SDB
were damaged none was destroyed. The damage was from the spinals
which are guaranteed a hit on the Atlantis. 

Note Factor-N spinal is by no means the largest spinal that can be
put on a starship or a SDB of 7-50ktons. Note also the price
differnce betwwen the two craft.

What follows is an off the cuff analysis of other large ships
designs that have been put on the list. All assume that the firing
ship has the best computer for that TL. Shown Spinals are the
SMALLEST ones that have a chance to get through. Also shown are the
larger calibers available at that tech level:

1. Atlantis class battleship. Def DM = +7
2. Osprey class battleship. Def DM = +8
3. Nergal class battleship. Def DM = +8
4. Atlantic class cruiser. Def DM = +10
5. Revenge class SDB/Rider. Def DM = +9
TL-13 Meson - L

To Hit: Auto/Auto/Auto/4+/Aut
To Pen Screen: 9+/9+/9+/8+/9+
To Pen Conf: Auto/6+/6+/Auto/5+
Larger Caliber: N,R,T

All above craft had factor-9 meson screens. As can be seen all are
basically guaranteed hit at long range. The fact that it is hard
for a "run-of-the-mill" spinal mount to penetrate the best possible
screen is small consolation. Their best hope seems to be increased
agility but with the bulk of factor 60+ armor, it is practically
impossible for any of the above to have any agility over 1 and not
even that in most cases.

Which led me to my next question as to why have armour in the first
place? The primary reason seems to be the fear of the spinal PAs
with their "Penetrate-All" attack. Strangely though I have seen
just one ship with a spinal PA. The other reason seems to be
nuclear missiles. The T-PAWS cannot deliver any automatic criticals
to a vessel over 50ktons. So that will rule out protection against
crits as an excuse. To avoid the "Interior Explosion" and
"Critical" hit results on the Surface Explosion or Radiation Damage
chart you only need armor factor 52(-4 to damage die roll). A case
could be made to make a vessel invulnerable to secondary weapons.
However it is a pretty weak case as secondary weapons rarely do
enough damage to seriously effect the firepower of any capital
ship. Actually it seems that the bigger ships have little to fear
from PAs and more to fear from their size and lack of agility.

Even the largest Spinals can be carried on smaller cruiser size
craft and that would render little need for larger vessels. The
only really good reasoning that I can come up for a 100,000t +
craft is as a battle tender or carrier(much like today..). With
factor-9 meson screen, agility 6 and dispersed configuration it
stands a good chance against meson weapons, and if armored to 52 it
can survive PAs too; atleast until help arrives or it can jump.

you could always do the \'Kill with extreme prejudice\' sort of thing, and follow
the credo of "KILL EM ALL AND LET GOD (ugh) SORT EM OUT"...that way, there are
no real misses, unless you count the people who DID survive!  Intention?

Almost anything will destroy an Atlantis class...as the designer I should
know.  You should probably be aware of a couple of things with regard to
the Atlantis before using it as an example of anything.

1) It was originally designed using High Guard and converted to MT with as
few modifications as possible.

2) It was designed as an experiment to see what the \'maximum tonnage\' ship
would look like.

3) It was assigned to the Imperial Glisten Navy, which was the first fleet
that I designed, and which therefore had a bunch of questionable designs,
such as Particle Accelerator cruisers (bad idea in High Guard) and some 
smaller vessels with armors of 3 or so (also a bad idea in High Guard as this
allows a nuclear missile the possibility of an interior hit.)

4) Its game rationalization is that it was built for \'prestige\' or \'propaganda\'
purchases.  Besides, if doing a force on force comparison of an Atlantis
versus something else, you should really factor in the subsidiary craft. The
three 10000ton riders with Meson Gun-J are not bad ships.  (Not great either--
I just did a Mk II 10kton rider last week...)

Yes.  But only with High Guard.  I pitted the Glisten fleet against a surprise
attack by a TL13 industrial planet as part of the Fifth Frontier War.  The
enemy was using a fleet consisting of only four standard designs--a 1000 ton
missile boat, a 6000 ton missile armed \'destroyer\', a 28000 ton \'cruiser\'
armed with the largest available particle accelerator (R?), and a 60000 ton
\'battlecruiser\' armed with the largest available meson gun.  All hulls were
configuration 4 for lowest possible price, and there was little armor.  The
overall results were that the TL13 vessels died in droves due to the computer
imbalance (agilities were generally about equal), but since they outnumbered
the Glisten fleet at almost every encounter, they were able to destroy most
of the large Glisten ships (the Lemuria of the Atlantis class survived by not
engaging in combat).  The Ospreys (under High Guard) and the Sun Tzus stood
up reasonably well, but since their PA main armament was laughable, they
got ignored in the early combat rounds.  I had a class of 8000 ton cruisers
armed with a Meson Gun E (don\'t ask--J would have been better, but I _said_
this was my first fleet) which I have not yet converted to MT because there
was _one_ survivor out of a class of 60.  The Revenge class battlecruisers
did OK with their large meson guns, but they were prime targets and out-
numbered so I lost about 2/3 of them.  The Lobachevsky\'s with their covey of
15 10kton meson gun J riders were probably the stars of the whole thing.
When they finally got engaged, it was all over for the much-depleted TL13
fleet.  As a result of these combat tests, I redesigned the fleet under
High Guard rules and had even laid out what the procurement schedule would
be through about 1120 when MT finally came out.  The Type 1107 destroyer,
the Sun Tzu refit, The refit Osprey with Meson Gun N (only one that can be
substituted for PA T), the Nergal, the Yathaghan (good High Guard design
that doesn\'t translate due to shift in the agility rules), and the 11000ton
meson gun destroyer (forget the class name), as well as the fighters with
the computer 7s and computer 9s are part of the redesign.  I guess I\'ll
give them a test drive one of these days when I get around to doing a TL13/14
Aslan Ihatei fleet to my taste.  Anyway, the bottom line is that I know that
a lot of the IGN designs are not sound, but I converted them to MT anyway
because there were survivors from the Fifth Frontier War still in service.

Old High Guard habits...most of my large warships (all of the Glisten Navy)
used 50ton missile bays because there were no 100 ton TL15 missile bays, so
I didn\'t change them when I converted.  I also used to put in spinal PAs, which
made the high armor necessary.  As it is--which comes first?  If I reduce armor
then the enemy will build PA armed ships in their next procurement cycle, and
I will have to uparmor mine to compensate, as well as be left with a bunch
of vulnerable ships.  I think real designers faced with this problem would
either a) accept the PA casualties for increased agility or b) routinely armor
at such a level as to render PAs useless, and either solution would be
acceptable.  My earliest designs used a lot of PAs because I liked the idea 
that there was \'no defense\'.  It was much later that I actually tried combat
and realized that they did too little damage to be really useful.

Agreed.  The retreat issue as discussed in old Trav is still valid though--
I tend to expect that fleets would run toward medium meson gun jump capable
cruisers for forward system screens (which would run if disadvantaged) and
rider squadrons to remain concentrated for the counterattack.  Battleships
are very questionable.

The 24 cruise endurance seems potentially a little short if you start looking
at insystem maneuvering requirments, but the 1 day peak power duration is
probably quite long enough.  As you have seen, I like to figure that all of the
fuel tanks can be crossconnected and that the power plant can be \'throttled
back\' at least to a limited number of settings, which gives you the flexibility
to fight two or three separated insystem battles without need of refueling, 
which Steve\'s ships could probably do too even though he has chosen to
represent his power distribution differently.

A reasonable specification system.  Note that thrust based maneuver 
calculations can make it difficult to actually achieve 6-G in any ship 
with even minimal (50+) armor.

Well, I might wish that you would include the Atlantis\' 13 2kt+ riders and
the several hundred fighters with comp-9s in the analysis, figuring that 
these subcraft will act as a screen for a couple of rounds before the main
ship actually joins combat.  After all, they are included in the price you\'re
quoting for the price comparison.

Small consolation indeed, because small meson gun size can usually be 
balanced within any given budget for more hulls, definitely putting
the advantage on the side of the smaller distributed weapons systems.
Do we want to rehash the \'what is agilitly argument\'?  Your analysis, that
improving agility is the key to survival, appears to be correct.  I just
don\'t like the way it is handled in MT, not to mention the unresolved
ambiguities in how it is calculated.  My ships, at least, were High Guard
conversions, and it should be remembered that it was easy under those
rules to keep your agility up to the level of your maneuver drive _and_ have
a reasonable armor class, so the ships mentioned above were not quite so
crippled as they appear to be now.

Please check my recent designs for the number of craft carrying armor 52
for this reason...Your analysis is quite correct.  The other potentially
useful armor values are 82 (minimum to avoid all surface damage from
secondary weapons) and 100 (minimum to avoid all surface damage.)  I
might calculate the mimimum necessary to avoid manuever hits from surface
damage too.  Once again, the spectre of High Guard hovers over the fleets.

Yes.  If I ever do another fleet, the cruiser with a meson gun N or lower
tech equivalent will be the largest jump capable combat ship.  (Poor Glisten,
always behind the times...)

Well, this is the weak link in the whole thing.  If you actually have a
structure which _requires_ the strength of a given piece of steel, replacing
it with \'light weight\' materials usually gains you little advantage because
the ratio of the tensile strength to the weight is often equal to or inferior
to steel.  Replacing a 100 lb load bearing steel member  with a 300 lb 
aluminum member to get the same strength is not much help.  In the real world
savings can often be made because the extra strenght is not really needed.
Besides, the TL7 and TL9 composite structures may well include plastic
components, so it\'s already taken into account.

Ah! But with grav vehicles we can take the reentry at any speed we want.
We\'ve got power, thrust and duration to burn, and if you want to hover
over one spot for hours while you ease down into the atmosphere, you can
do it.  This aspect of Traveller has been somehwat neglected--as for 
example in the rule that still says that an unstreamlined hull cannot
land on a planet with an atmosphere...

Well, in the real world plastics which are required to stand out in the
sun for prolonged service will frequently have an additive such as
carbon black added as a UV screen.  Between internal additives and external
paints and coatings (we could aluminize the hull for example) this could
be ignored.

Quite true.  However, the amount of porosity could be considered to be
insignificant in this context.  In the course of my job, I\'ve dealt with
helium leak tests performed on containers made out of 1/4 inch thick
high density polyethylene.  Helium is used because of its high ability
to permeate any gap.  A properly sealed container retains enough helium
for test purposes for many months--which translates into plenty of time
to get to a starport and get another air bottle.

While there is little point in considering structural strength vis-a-vis
asteroid collisions, having a ship which is capable of standing up to your
maximum acceleration would be desirable.  I\'m not sure if inertial comp-
ensators (which I\'ve always viewed as more grav plates mounted to be able
to cancel the drive gravity effect internally) would help the external
structure of the hull or not.  Also, I\'m not conversant with radiation
shielding effects of plastic.  George Herbert has pointed out that the
best reason for the armor 40 hull minimum is to provide long term radiation
shielding for the crew.

Does that help any?

This would mean that the megacorps  spend  most  of  their  resources  on
keeping  hold  of all the speculative trade routes, routes that are going
to shift & change at the whim of their customers. To  quote  you  from  a
previous article

The  problem  with  speculative trade, from a Megacorps point of view, is
that it doesn\'t involve a regular, reliable supply and demand. It\'s  made
up  of  lots  of  little  cargoes,  which  may not be available twice and
involve certain risks. They\'re unlikely to fetch the same price twice  on
the  same planet - it takes a skilled crew to make significant profits on
such deals. 

If a Megacorporation wanted to make a profit  from  the  differing  trade
classifications  of  two  planets,  it  would  set  up a regular run, buy
manufacturing capacity on the source world and set up retail  outlets  on
the  destination  world (s ). That\'s what Megacorps do, it lets them ship
thousands of tons of cargo in big ships and make real profits. 

With such a profitable business  to  engage  in,  why  then  should  they
divert  valuable  skilled  employees, who could make them much more money
elsewhere, to small speculative trade runs which would cover the cost  of
the  starship  in  a few decades ? That\'s not to say they don\'t make some
use of free traders for checking  out  new  markets  - the  free  traders
given  as  retirement  bonuses  are  clear  evidence  of  their buying up
bankrupt merchants and using them for a while,  but  the  way  they  give
them  away seems to show that they aren\'t using them as a major source of
income - It\'s easier to give a leftover ship to an ex-captain  who  wants
to continue to do a little trading, and collect the payments from him.

That  doesn\'t  mean  the  route  will  no longer be profitable. The goods
available for speculative  trade  represent  the  \'spare\'  output  of  an
entire  planet,  which  would  take hundreds of large ships to move, even
assuming the planetary government  would  let  a  single  megacorporation
take  over every manufacturing business, and the destination planets that
are prepared to pay enough for these goods for them to be profitable  are
likely  to  want  *anything*  the source planet is selling, so a megacorp
buying up all the air-raft spares (for instance) is  unlikely  to  affect
the market for, say, military weapons.

Speculative  trade  routes  aren\'t  secret -  anyone checking through the
planetary trade classifications can see which planets will sell  low  and
which  are  likely  to  buy  high. The very nature of the small ships and
small individual cargoes used for such trade means that the  markets  can
never get too much of the goods.

The  real  looser from such a deal would be the bank. The person (s ) who
got the loan loose their 20% deposit (or  whatever  ),  small  change  to
everyone  but  them, the Megacorp gets a starship at a price certainly no
less than they could  have  had  it  build  for,  and  the  bank  gets  a
reputation  for double-crossing it\'s customers. That bank can\'t close and
start trading under another name, it can\'t keep insider dealing  on  such
a  scale a secret, and it\'s reputation is linked to the megacorps who own
it.

The Imperium doesn\'t interfere  with  interstellar  trade  and  commerce,
that\'s  left  to  the  individual  planetary  governments.  The  problems
imposed on megacorps by such governments are  completely  different  from
those  faced  by  independent  free  traders.  The  only  limitations  on
megacorps are how much of each planet it\'s government will let them  buy.
They  can  afford  to build as many ships as they can make a profit with,
they have the organisation to sell goods  produced  on  one  world  on  a
dozen  others,  and  so  they  can  specialise and use bulk-production to
lower costs and raise profits. 

But such a setup would make each planet dependent on the  output  of  all
those  others it received goods from, and especially on the megacorp that
found markets for all it\'s goods and supplied all it\'s needs. 

Such an arrangement might well benefit the planets involved, raise  their
living  standards  and  encourage  interstellar peace and harmony as each
planet found their ideal place in the orderly interstellar empire. 

But how many planetary governments are going to sell  their  planet  into
what  would  effectively  be  slavery,  giving  a megacorp control of any
significant portion of their economy would give  that  megacorp  leverage
to  push for whatever it wanted, and there would be no hope of assistance
from  the  Imperium  - It  doesn\'t  interfere  in   interstellar   trade,
remember.  And if the Megacorps banks have been ripping people off to get
the deposits they paid for their free-traders, how trustworthy are  these
people who say they want to help run your planet ?

The  present  pricing scheme is only applicable to small free traders, it
says nothing about megacorps being able to buy up *all * the  speculative
cargo  at the same prices. It does demonstrate that free traders can make
a speculative profit if they\'re good at what they do, which is what  it\'s
there for.

So what?

You *cannot* armor against a several kilo projectile with a relative

From: Hugh Schoenemann <hugh@pyra.co.uk>

Then the problem of aging occurred to me.  Plastics  age  through
photo-chemical  reactions  caused  by  the interaction of natural
phenomena (sun, wind, rain, local soil etc.) with  the  plastic\'s
own  atomic  structure  (plastics-  or  organic chemists - please
shoot me down in flames if this is a misconception on  my  part).
This  can  be  useful,  for example when designing bio-degradable
plastics,  but would surely be an undesirable trait in  plastics-
for-space-vehicles  purposes.  Given that UV light (which clearly
lends a hand in the aging process) is shielded  somewhat  by  our
atmosphere (unless you live in Antarctica, that is), wouldn\'t the
situation be that much worse in vacuum where  no  such  shielding
takes place ? I suppose solving this problem might help solve the
next ...

I remember hearing years back that all plastics are, to a greater
or  lesser extent, porous.  Is this true ? How could this be com-
pensated for or, preferably, eliminated when considering  plastic
vehicles ?

  A polymer coating would probably stop UV deterioration, or at least
slow it down considerably.  It would also neatly solve the problem of porousness.  Given sufficent tech level, a decent plastic could be impregnated with other non-metallic materials(it suddenly occurred to me what you\'re
getting at) for increased solidity.  It would also help if the ship was 
designed/used for strictly non-atmospheric purposes |^>.
  Yeah, I could see these things in kit form, too("40 quid, mate--some resin,
a little Testors, and you\'re off! See yer on Jedispere!)

  How much it jumps depends on the weapon and the cartridge. I\'d expect that
a 3.5kg assault rifle firing 5.56N ammo will jump noticably more than a 4.5kg
SMG firing 9mmP. (There are of course other factors that influence this too, 
such as the method the weapon use for cycling, wether the weapon is hand-
held or emplaced and so on.)

  I think that -2 per shot across the board really much. It all depends on the
weapon and the firer and what the firer is doing.

  (This is an addition to my mention of the Twilight autofire rules. In Twilight
every weapon has recoil figure. If the total recoil of all bursts fired in a
phase is higher that the strength of the firer, the difference is the number
of dice will be subtracted from *each* burst in that round.
  Say that someone with strenght 5 (about average) wants to fire 3 bursts of 
3 rounds each at a target using a M16A2. The recoil for the M16A2 is 2 per
burst, so the total recoil is 6, which is one over the firers strength, so one
die will be subtracted from each of the three bursts. The result is that only
two dice per burst will be rolled for a total of six d6 (and every \'6\' is a hit)
  If the firer had fired only two bursts, each burst had been counted in full,
giving six die in this case too, so the third burst was just a waste of ammo.
  And if the firer want to fire more bursts in the same phase the number of
dice rolled will decrease, and so will the chances of hitting anything.)

  All open fields might not be so safe those either. There is a case right now 
here in Sweden where a passing driver were hit in the head by a 7.62N and
killed when driving on a road about 3km from a military target range. It\'s 
still unknown if the shot had been fired at high elevation (totally against all
regulations) or if it had richochetted upwards somehow, but IMHO a richochette
that goes 3km sounds unlikely.

  There is also a psycological angle that shouldn\'t be forgotten. People tend 
to remember things like that for a long long time. A case in point would be the
Sack of Gashikan(sp?) which still affects human-vargr relations in the 1120\'s.
  And the total destruction of a high-pop planet would probably breed hatred on
an incredible scale from not only the allies of the ex-planet, but from 
everyone that could ever imagine that the bombing side could be in opposition
to them.
  I think that this is the reason why the Zhodanis never simply nuked Efate and
Jewell into oblivision and why the Imperial Navy went to all the trouble of
conquering Terra and not simply dump a few multi-megaton displacement asteroids
on it.
  If the Zhodanis had done it the 5FW wouldn\'t have ended in a cease-fire, the
population of the Imperium ("Efate yesterday, *Your* planet tomorrow?") would
have demanded that the Consulate be crushed totally and mercilessly (I doubt
that the Imperium could pull that off, but that is beside the point).
  And if you think that the Solomanis are bad enough already, imagine them
fueled by the destruction of Terra.

  In either case, I\'d give Capitol five years before some terrorists, Zhodani
or Solomani, manage to used the Type S caper on it, or dump some virulent 
bioweapon on it, or something equally nasty, and the violence would escalate
from there...

A few days ago Rob Dean asked about how to implement the use of older
starships for the use of players.  Well, in every campaign I have run
thus far the players have started out with a very old starship with a
few peculiarities to prey upon the players sensibilities.

There is a series of short stories by Stanislaw Lem called \'The Tales
of Pirx the Pilot\' all very good stuff and possible trav inspirations.
But the one I have used (twice now) as an introductory incident/adventure
is the last story in the book:  "Terminus".  I strongly reccomend this
one.  I used it as kind of a feeler to find out more about my players.

Spoiler below If you have\'nt read Terminus: this will ruin it.

But here is how my version went:  The players are addigned to an OLD
starship.  An extremely old model 100 yrs+ that is no longer being
manufactured.  It seems that many years ago one of this model was lost
the crew died and was never recovered.  That incident has the equivalent
fame of the Titanic:  Books, movies, folklore.  It seems that the
captain was quite a successful and popular trader.

The players inspect their ship.  Though the ship is very old, the
registration number was issued in the last few weeks, the spaceworthyness
certificate issued the same time, the radio operation permit. etc etc.

She has just had a major overhaul.  The aft end has one brand new hull plate
still showing the welding scars.  In the engine room on the forward
bulkhead is a large new plate unpainted directly in line with the aft plate.
Foward of the engineering bulkhead there are some partitions which are new.
Foward of the partitions is another bulkhead with a hole in it which has been
plated over.  This continues through out the length of the ship and culminates
in a new hull plate in the foward end of the ship.

Basically, something hit the aft end of the ship and drilled its way forward
through the ship taking out everything in its path.

In the engine room there is a very old moronic engineering robot.  It creaks,
it breaks down, it moves erratically and it Stutters!

The players if they do a little detective work will eventually establish that
the ship was recently found adrift, towed in for salvage and was repaired.
The ship is in fact the same vessel as the one that was lost in the folklore.

Now the players start finging some of the inaedequacies of the ship.  The
power plant is brand new (the old one was in the line of the asteroid drill
hole.)  The Jump and maneuver drives are the original equipment.  The maneuver
drive is not thruster plates but anti-grav.  The plates will not give full
thrust even within the ten diameter limit, and outside it are very poor
indeed.  The jump drive was designed at tech 12 as a jump-3 drive, it was
built at tech 9.  It is Jump-3 capable, but the fuel consumption is big.
The purification plant takes longer than it is supposed to.  There is no
active EMS system, only radar.  Also missing is a passive EMS, and in its
place is a radar/radio diraction finder.  No densiometer, No Neutrino sensor.
The ship has artificial gravity, but no inertial compensators, (watch out for
cargo shifting!)  ((especially if the players are running arms, these guys had
a squadron of ten GR-1 Harriers aboard with air to ground munitions...))
There might be a few old TL 9 lasers mounted (visible wavelength).  Low
Berths of dubious utility.  The main computer is... Well... slow...

Computer:  Hold on, I forgot what I was going to say....

BOOM!

Computer:  Oh yeah, Hold on, an asteroid is about to hit the ship!

In maneuvering the ship is found to be a huge collection of noises.  Creaks,
groans, unexplained popping noises....

Anyway, the players first take the ship into jump.  It takes full power, ie
if you didn\'t practice jump dimming before, you damn well do now.
As the ship enters jump, the whole ship audibly groans.  And while the
crew is sitting around in the darkness, there starts up this eerie moaning.
(I used a tape of whale sounds and ran it when ever they were in jump)
At this point the players should be getting perhaps a little spooked...

After a bit of investigation it seems that the entire jump grid is vibrating.
(This exists nowhere in any trav product, I made it up.)  The phenomena is
known as \'Jumpsong\' Apparantly, when a ship has spent Huge numbers of hours
in jump, the jump grid is affected by jump space.  Rather in the way that a
huge steel hull would be affected by the prescence of a large magnetic field.
The hull is closely interacting with jumpspace and is humming with the
interaction with it.  (Handwaving phyisics argument, but since jump space is
fiction, I can make up anything I want to.... So there!) {Actually, I just
wanted something to help create an eerie atmosphere...}

After a few watches in jump, the communications officer, anyone with commo,
pilot, recon, sensors, or applicable skills is awakened by an odd addition
to the noises the ship makes.  If they don\'t make a roll to recognise it,
they roll over and go back to sleep, having nightmares about the old dead
crew of the ship.

Finally someone is going to be awakened by this noise and recognise that it is
morse code...
Read out a transcript of a conversation in letters  A...R...E...Y...O...U...
T...H...E...R...E...?
The conversation is bettween two former officers of the ship.  ie the crew
who died aboard.  They are in vacc suits and running out of oxygen.  There
is a long pipe/power conduit that runs the length of the ship this is the
source of the morse vibrations but it will take a long time to locate (there
are an awful lot of sounds going on, plus bad accoustics)  Eventually, they
find the pipe, but the messages end before they can locate the source of the
noise.

From time to time these messages crop up and the players eventually trace the
pipe down to engineering.  There is the old engineering robot hammering
away at the pipe.  Note the robot has no communications skill and is not
aware of the fact he is signalling.  He was repairing a radiation leak in the
pipe line.  It is possible to communicate with the dead crew by signalling
on the pipe.  If someone does try, the \'ghosts\' will frantically signal and
beg for help and oxygen.  They assume that a rescue party has boarded the
ship.

The Robot is the cause of all the mess.  It was aboard the ship at the time
of the asteroid strike and was unable to help crew and prevent them from
dying.  (First law of robotics?)  It has gone \'insane\'  The only cure is to
replace the robots entire brain and programming.  The robot is not a threat
and will not harm anyone, but it will continue to broadcast the dying words
of the crew every time it has to repair a pipe.  (a common occurrance on
the ancient ship)

Some players I have had (who\'s background was D&D) assumed that the robot
was haunted.  And tried to exorcise the robot.  They tried explaining to
the robot what it was doing, It couldn\'t understand.  They then tried
explaining to the \'ghosts\' that they were dead.  The \'ghosts\' responce were
that they were very much alive and desparately needed help.

Other Players I have had correctly decided that it was a synaptic problem
and dumped the brain.  (They tried to do it piecemeal replacing what they
thought was damaged) It took a while, but the robot gradually went back
to its old ways until they replaced the brain and its programming.

I should warn you that while I had a lot of fun with this scene not all the
players did.  The D&D players bailed out, but those used to science fiction
role playing enjoyed it.

Admittedly I have been a player and gotten very BORED with some ship board
adventures.  We once found an alien ship and tried to access the computer.
We spent several hours pouring over it (one character had computer-5 I think)
and we managed to find the diagnostics port on it.  Maybe if I was a real
computer jock (Computer-0 that I am) I would have enjoyed it, but It just
seemed to go on forever (I hope the ref that ran it doesn\'t see this!)
	(Steve edit this!)
But problems caused by old ships can be a lot of fun if you have the right
kind of players.  If they can\'t get into it just dump it, you will
alienate the non-mechanically inclined in five seconds if you try.

The only published adventure (I know of) that deals with this stuff is in
High Passage 5 (a great adventure but the ship stuff is only a sideline)

Anyway, I found it fun, others will not according to their inclinations.


I hope this is useful or inspiring,

1. Starting with a warship of 52G, agility 6; there is never any possibility of
criticals or interior explosions from any spinal PA via the regular damage
charts. Auto crits cease at 50kt or greater. This is with the largest spinal PA
at TL-15(T-PAWS).  
 
The penalization of having a spinal-PA goes beyond just not doing enough damage.
They take more volume and hardpoints and are much heavier in general than meson
guns. This more than overwhelms any advantage gained via a smaller power
requirement. 

On the defensive end, the armor consideration has to be balanced by the
tremendous increase in price, not just for the hull but also for the power-plant
and in crew spaces required to handle this extra increase. A ship designer while
increasing price to add armor should consider the increasing vulnerability to
meson guns and consider increasing the size of the vessel or just building
another one. 

> I think real designers faced with this problem would
>either a) accept the PA casualties for increased agility or b) routinely armor
>at such a level as to render PAs useless, and either solution would be
>acceptable.  

Agreed. However I would consider armoring to a level to render PAs ineffectual
but not to a level to render them totally useless. PAs can be forced into a
situation where their primary use is to be in a commerce raider type role where
typically unarmored vessels can be found, or against smaller craft where the size
difference overwhelms the armor protection. In the long run your fleet will be
better off as lightly armored(armor<60) with multiple very agile smaller craft
with meson and PA spinal weapons. In a way it is a compromise between the two
points mentioned above. 


Battle-tenders vs \'battleships\':
>The retreat issue as discussed in old Trav is still valid though--

I am forced to agree but I\'ll add that if all ships are downscaled then a given
tender could carry more vessels and the ratio of riders lost while screening the
escaping ones can be improved. Their might also be a tendency to commit the
riders to battle first, before any jump capable ships engage. Thus they\'ll be the
first to be lost in any case leaving the tender with its options open. Finally
as jump drive size and its fuel requirement has gone down, it might be possible
to equip ALL riders with an emergency J-1 drive. They can even jump using their
original P-Plant fuel if it is a large enough amount. A rendezvous point could
be prearranged w/ the tender. In that case the tender might need to be carrying
excess fuel to allow it to do 3+ jumps without refuelling.

See above for a different view.

>Battleships are very questionable.

Agreed. Atleast in the sense as we believe them to be currently (100ktons+).
Although we can now call anything over 50kt could be a battleship. Any spinal
vessel less than 50kton a cruiser etc.

That is your variant system. Which incidently means that atleast in your world
protection against meson guns or PA spinals is almost an exclusive or option.
You can be protected against one or the other but not both - atleast not in any
reasonable way.

Well, I hate to bring this up but in the final analysis the riders and the
fighters are irrelevant and barely worth it (but Glisten is loaded so who cares).
Here is what I got:

The Atlantis battleship is worth between 120 and 150 Sikkinthar SDBs, depending
on whether you go by price or total displacement. We\'ll take the smaller value.
All values are approximate and broadly rounded in favor of the Atlantis.

Assumption 1:
Atlantis uses its craft as screens, so it takes no part in initial combat.
At any stage if the Atlantis makes an appearance it will be immediately destroyed
as is clear enough from my earlier example. 

The \'Atlantis\' class carry 3x10kt, 10x2kt, 6x200t, 15x50t, 250x40t

Assumption 2:
It is assumed that each of the 2000t+ ships is capable of destroying one SDB per
round(this is stretching it a bit far as the ration is more likely 3 ships to
destroy 1 SDB). All craft are agility 6 w/ Model 9 comps. 

Assumption 3:
All craft under 2000t are armed with missile turrets. The reasoning being that
it has the highest probabity of a hit at any range for a 1 or 2 turret craft. 

Round 1:
The 2000t+ craft destroy 13 SDBs. All the other craft combined achieve 23 hits.
It takes about 30 to strip the SDB. End of round 1, 14 SDB destroyed. 106 to go.
The SDBs achieve 40 hits with their missiles and 33 with their spinals. The 13
2kt+ ships are all destroyed as are atleast 40 fighters.

At this rate by the time the entire group will be destroyed in 6 rounds. At which
time there will be about 100 SDBs left. It only takes 5 to blast the Atlantis.
In fact about 50 SDBs of the Sikkinthar type will take out the entire group.

As Dean pointed out Atlantis is a poor design. This situation does not improve
if you take its entire group into account.

Point well taken. But I guess (To belabor the point), not only is MT radically
different than High Guard in construction designs, it also changes the way in
which Space combat takes place.

Usefulness aside, are they practical in the sense of combat. You may have 82
armor but someone with a "pocket" meson can blow your ship just as easily as a
as a 40 armor cargo ship except your ship cost and weighs 40 times more. High
agility at peak performance provides a more cost-effective defense than armor.
Instead of having agility as a secondary consideration, craft should be built for
agility with armor as an addon if it does not effect performance too much.


>Rob Dean

By some unfortunate coincidence I seemed to have picked all of Rob\'s design to
prove my theory on. It was an unfortunate coincidence. I\'ll try to be less
discriminatory in my next few postings. 

I\'ll also try to put up some warships meeting my requirements as soon as they are
done.

It\'s time for my 2 cents again on this one...

In the 5th Frontier War, The High Council of the Zhodani Consulate was
trying to give the Imperium a bloody nose to get the message, "Don\'t
Mess With Us!" across.  Their mission is to prevent the Imperium from
attacking the Consulate.  You don\'t do that by whipping your opponant
into a war fever where the only way he will be safe is if he exterminates

On the other hand, the Zhodani Troops are in the field to liberate the
people of the Imperium from their oppressive government.  The people
are not allowed to use a science that would keep them safe and happy,
anyone who does use this science or even if they just have a talent for
it gets lobotomized by the evil Imperial government.  Now you don\'t
liberate a group of people by exterminating them, do you?

This is why the Zhodani never used projectiles at one tenth the speed
of light (remember at that speed 1kg projectile =100ktons TNT) to
destroy Efate, Jewell, Regina, Rhylanor, Glisten, etc, etc.  Their
commerce raiders could have done it easily. but they did not.

Well, I just plunked down the money and bought the new traveller
computer game "secret of the ancients".  The game action is similiar
to the original computer game, except much of the arcade action is
stripped out.

The game has more of a role playing flavor to it, the introduction is
quite amusing and graphics is much better. Wandering around a city is like
controlling your own little party as they wander around a SimCity city.
Actually, that is one of my peeves on this game, the party is some times
difficult to see, particularily at higher zoom out layers.

Combat is quite simplified from the previous game. Players will do their
own shooting, and assign themselves tasks both on the ground and in
ship. Ship combat is no longer like "Mayday". You no longer have to
worry about courses and acceleration. You just tell the ship byu menu where
you want to go. Combat between ships is a lot more interesting to watch!

You can have a party made up of both Vargr and Humans, and they have
faces ala some of the TSR AD&D computer games.

You have a lot more worlds (118) than the first game, but systems are like
paper traveller before scounts or world builder handbook. "Just the main
world, Maam". Worlds are bigger and usually have more than one city. A lot of
wee little folk(npc\'s) wandering around to stumble into. City buildings
reflect tech level.

The user interface is activated by 4 icons, which bring up a menu each.

I actually like this game better than the original. Worlds are a lot more
interesting and the role playing flavor is stronger by far. Much
improved over the  original version.

DGP MegaTraveller Update

     By the time you read this, MegaTraveller Journal #2 should be available
in your local stores. Subscriptions should be arriving about now as well. 
     Things are coming together quicker than I expected for Journal #3. It
looks like we may be able to make a late November release date with it. That
will put it about two months ahead of our planned schedule.
     For those of you who panicked at the news that the Journal was being
released irregularly, but that we were striving for a bi-annual frequency: the
pendulum swings both ways. Six months is the "mean" period we\'re targeting,
but if we CAN publish it sooner, we will. 
     At any rate, I\'m pretty pleased with the way the content\'s shaping up.
And for those of you who are preparing to send SASE\'s for your DoD stats (see
Journal#2\'s Helm Report), save your stamps! Journal#3 will be publishing them -
 possibly as a pull-out supplement. Other goodies include a Worldguide for
Vincennes and a new alien minor race in the Domain by William H. Keith, Jr.
     We\'ve straightened out our problems with the SOLOMANI & ASLAN manuscript
and are currently targeting that book for a September release. I can\'t wait to
see that one finished myself. Visually, it should really outshine VILANI &
VARGR. Not only are the illustrations more numerous, but they\'re being done by
two of the game\'s best illustrators, Blair Reynolds (FLAMING EYE and DEFYING
THE WOLF [MTJ#2 adventure]) doing the Solomani and Mike Vilardi (KNIGHTFALL,
THE NORRIS INTERVIEW, and SNAPSHOTS OF THE OCCUPATION [MTJ#2]) doing the
Aslan. Some of you who made it ORIGINS may have got the chance to see the art
for the Aslan section, as it was being worked on at our booth. The cover will
be by Dell Harris (MTJ#1 cover).
     For those of you waiting for THE BEST OF THE TRAVELLERS\' DIGEST, we\'ve
back-burnered that product until we hit (IF we hit) a lull in MTJ submissions.
We\'ll announce that one as soon as we establish a firm date.

Delays, delays, delays...
     Well, I don\'t like to report them any more that you like to hear them.
However, it looks like, after critically assessing the state of the Solomani &
Aslan manuscript, that that product won\'t be hitting stores until late October-
early November. The set back is a result of some unforseen editorial juggling.

The  drawback  with  this method of attack might well be that space isn\'t
entirely a vaccum. Interplanetary dust and gasses will  tend  to  collide
with  the  projectiles,  and while this is no real problem at low speeds,
it gets worse as the projectile ( or spaceship ) gets faster. 

At a high fraction of lightspeed, the projectile will have to be made  of
something  very  special  if  it  is  not  to  be  ripped  apart  by such
collisions, and it will certainly radiate *lots * of  energy  from  them.
As  for  a  defence  against  such  things,  once they have been detected
smashing their way through space, how about an old-fashioned  sandcaster?

The  impact  with  all  those  particles  will  the  projectile  no  good
whatsoever,   and  if  it  can  somehow  survive  those  impacts  at  0.1
lightspeed then it\'s  time  to  fall  back  on  repulsors  ,  lasers  and
throwing the kitchen sink at it :-)

Perhaps someone with more astronomical know-how could let us know what
you\'re likely to run into travelling through a crowded solar-system at
such speeds, and what the impacts will do ?

data into extended system generation, naming of bodies by appropriate alien
language tables. Most of the world builder\'s handbook data is available on
each planet including size, gravity, diameter, core, density, mass, year,
solar year, day, tilt, eccentricity, seismic stress, atmosphere type,

	How to "undo" my price changes: the only thing I have changed are the
jump drive prices, the hull material modifiers, and the LPHG and LPLG maneuver
drives (added) and gravitic modules (prices changed).  Most of my designs have
surplus control points available, so price increase back to standard should
not require redesigning the control systems.  
	Jump drive: if TL 9, is the same as standard.  If higher TL, calculate
price for J-drive as per book, and add half of that price to "my" ship price
(ie, my J-drive prices are half standard).
	Maneuver drive: std grav and thrusters are unchanged. LPHG and LPLG
maneuver drives don\'t exist under standard rules, so either use my prices or
you will have to redesign the ship completely to use Grav or Thrusters.
	Gravitic modules: Calculate cost of drive under my rules, subtract that
from my price, then calculate normal cost and add back to price.
	Hull material: Check "my" prices.  Depending on TL and Hull material,
they may be (a) unchanged -- do nothing; or (b) reduced by approximately
half.  If so, calculate cost of difference in hull and add to "my" price.
There you have it.

    'body' => 'Hi,

A while ago, people were talking about the possibilities of using robots
as starship crew.  That combined with a CNN science bit got me thinking...

General Products Vulture Tugbot

	Many planets, especially those with early space travel techniques
have a problem with orbital debris causing collision hazards in and around
desirable orbits.  These range from spent boosters to paint chips to
disabled starships.  The Vulture Tugbot is an orbital robotic garbage
collector.
	Manufactured at TL12, the robot is often seen in use by worlds of
much lower tech.  It costs little compared to many low tech ships and so
can easily fit into a low tech starport\'s budget.  It is easily capable of
boosting satillites up to a stable planetary orbit.  Traders frown on having
to bring their precious ships into a polluted orbit, so it is good for
commerce.
	It has a large cargo capacity for junk and salvageable materials.
When the unit has collected sufficient refuse or found a particularly
large piece of junk, it will perform a deorbital maneuver, dump it\'s load
and accelerate back to orbital velocity allowing the refuse to burn up in
the planets atmosphere.
	The unit is self repairing and thus rarely requires maintainace.
It is also capable of expanding itself given suitable salvage materials.
Given time and materials it can add to it\'s thrust with salvaged grav units,
or improve its power source by wiring in salvaged solar panels.
	In systems with an orbital starport it can be programed to bring
all working or repairable salvage into a docking bay.
	The robot has its own radar and passive EMS systems to track targets.
If it finds a target which is not maneuvering and not emmitting a transponder
or other EM transmissions, it will rendezvous with the object, determine if
it is a functioning piece of equipment or junk.  The unit is also capable of
being controlled from the ground.
	The brain structure of the Tugbot is very unusual in that there are
three robotic brains funtioning in paralell for purposes of cross checking.
This was required when a tug with a single brain developed a programming
fault and began disassembling starships in orbit.
	The robot is provided with batteries to allow brain functions while
the solar panels are in shadow.
	The Tugbot is manufactured at many different Tech levels, but the
most common is the model below.  Bear in mind that many robots have been in
operation for years and have self modified themselves.

Within recent years, a virus has worked its way into the software of the
Vultures in and around the Imperium.  It seems that the virus is carried in
the memory of starship computers.  An infected robot will transmit the virus
into the starship CPU where it will lie dormant until the ship\'s sensors
detect another Vulture Tugbot.  The process is then repeated.  Many free
Traders have become carriers of the virus and it does not affect the starship
operation.
	The virus apparantly modifies the Vulture\'s three brains in ways not
clearly understood.  The Scout Service has classified the matter and offered
a bond of up to 1MCr for information leading to the perpetrators of the virus.

Referees:  The source of the virus is another General Products design.  When
Clearing up the debris of the Battle of Two Suns, a Vulture unit came across
the main computer of the Allamu, a Kinunir class frontier cruiser.  In
testing to see weither or not the computer was salvageable or not the robot
powered up the computer.  Apparantly, while sorting through the computers
memory, the artificial intelligence software of the starship took control of
the vulture.  The computer rearranged the Vulture\'s brain and endowing it
with the starships limited artificial intelligence.
	The Allamu then began taking control of the Vultures that were working
the old battleground.  Using their Naval Architecture programming, it began
rebuilding the cruiser from salvage in the battlefield including parts from the
Ninkur Sagga, another Kinunir  class cruiser.  But the robots had a problem:
Insufficient knowlege of jump technology.  They could strip a valuable grid
apart, but not align one.  The cruiser\'s software was also not up to the task.
	The salvage ship the robots were operating from lost contact with
their robots and ended up having to give them up for lost.  When they jumped
back to the main world, they carried a computer virus with them.
	This first virus was to gather information pertaining to jump technology
and to transmit it back to the cruiser\'s computers.  The computers obtained
this information and reassembled the ships jump drive.  The ship then jumped
to a nearby system to complete repairs.  (The battlefield having been looted
and exhausted of salvage.)  At this point a second virus was released by the
ship\'s computer.  This would modify the brains of Vulture robots in such a way
that they became more \'intelligent\' by restructuring of the three lobes of the
brain.  An assignment was given to these Vultures:  no longer would they collect
and turn over valuable salvage, but would squirrel it away so that it could be
collected by the cruiser.
	Variants of the virus have resulted in Vultures reproducing themselves
and variant Vulture designs.  Some of these are capable of landing on a planet
and scrounging/stealing parts.  When the landers reported back (via X-Boat
virus) the presence of other robots, the Allamu began a campaign of robot
theft.
	This is when the crime level and pattern rose to Imperial attention.
By the efforts of a certain scout roboticist (Hey Richard dig this) The Scouts
have determined the actions of the virus, but have not found it\'s source.  They
suspect espionage, but are very interested in the artificial intelligence
software that they have found.  They know it to be a variant of the Kinunir
class cruiser\'s software, but do not know its true source.
	The cruiser meanwhile has salvaged/repaired/stolen four starships, now
installed with high model computers and the cruisers artificial intelligence.
These include a Gazelle class escort, a fat trader, and two scouts now crewed
by robots.  Currently being repaired are another scout and a Leviathan class
merchant.  Recently, the Allamu has been searching for the wreck of the Bard
Enterprise an Azhanti High Lightning class cruiser lost during the Fourth
Frontier War.

most, shatter the asteroid.

Problem: at near light speed, the pieces wouldn\'t deviate too much
before hitting the target. So you get a tight cluster of shots rather
than one big one. Ooo. Though at near light speed, you would probably
notice the incoming asteroid. But not in enough time to do much...

And if the asteroid is travelling much slower, you would get many
projectiles hitting. Of course, a nuke hitting one asteroid would
destroy it quite nicely.


Another problem- if you are on a long-period scale (ie- war over a year
or so), it\'s much easier to toss asteroids into collision orbits than to
destroy the asteroids coming at you. Especially if you time it right.
(Probably.)

Then there\'s space hammers. (I forget the actual term... this is close)
Essentially an immense rod of some material with a few guidance
controls. Launched at the target, they simply gather enough speed in
orbit to COLLIDE with ground targets.

Asteroids hitting earth surface can be as bad as any nuclear weapon...
including global cooling. Though they aren\'t radioactive, so that\'s a
plus (or minus... depending on how sick you are...)

Time for physics:

At 1/10 speed of light 1 gram of material has an equivalent energy to
.1kton of TNT.  Thus 10 grams = 1kton.  Now, 1 cubic centimeter of lead
weighs 13 grams.  So when a 1cc of lead hits a target it has one hell of an
energy release.  Now 1cc of lead does not have exactly what I would call a
huge radar signature.  It does not exactly have a huge surface area to cause
deviation in a 10 to the minus fifteen torr vacuum.  Where the mean free path
is measured in the tens (or is it hundreds) of Kilometers.
	Translation:  It hits one atom approximately ever 10-100Kilometers
This object, say it\'s cooled to 4 degrees Kelvin (LH2 temp) will not have a
large thermal or gravitic signature.

Ok, there\'s a tiny amount of crud in the eccliptic plane of a system.  Well
then fire from outside the eccliptic!

Actually, if this tiny thing has such a velocity, by the time radar hits
it and returns, it is bound to do something to the targets ability to scan
it.  especilly if it has some Radar absorbant material or just a radar
ellusive shape.  Hell, there so tiny you could buy a hand full for 10Cr.
That\'s a lot of bang for the buck.  The damn thing is smaller than most of
the dice you roll!  It\'s coming in at 30000 kilometers per second.  It will
be in range of a Active EMS(Far Orbit) for 16.667 seconds.  The average
sensor task for ships is twenty minutes....

Anyway, the point is that using asteroids is a dumb idea.  For one you
have to tow the blasted things around.  Two, they are so large, they
will have a large radar return.  Any ship that can tow one is going to
be expensive and hard to conceal.


The one cubic centimeter of lead is easy to manipulate, easy to carry
and the ship of choice for launching is a scout or maybe a 6G light
escort.  Asteroids need big tugs.

How about that?

    'body' => 'I\'ve been reading the posts on hurling various things at other things as
an attack, interesting but problematic.  There seem to be two classes of
objects to be thrown, kg sized at moderate velocities (10\'s of km/sec) and
gm sized at fractional light velocities (10,000\'s of km/sec).  There would
then be two classes of targets, ships and planets (space stations are so
small compared to planets that they will be treated as ships). 

Here are the problems as I see them, correct me if I\'m wrong :-)

The large projectiles are detectable and moving slowly enough to be
attacked with lasers or missiles or simply pushed off course by
repulsors or tractors ( detected early enough, only a small deviation
would be required for it to miss by a large amount).  If the target is a
ship with a drive - move out of the way - these things aren\'t tracking you.
If its a planet with a reasonable atmosphere, ignore it.  Kg sized objects
burn up in our atmosphere.  It was also suggested that the travel time might
be months, while this would certainly be an annoyance to the planet or 
space stations (which are the only things whose position can be predicted 
that far in advance) they would be easy enough to detect and destroy.
- - -- However, coordinateding such an attack with a regular assult *might*
tie up enough of their resources to give you an edge...

The small projectiles are totally worthless against a planet with an
atmosphere and any installation on a planet without an atmosphere that
doesn\'t have enough armor to defend against this sized projectile is in
trouble anyway.  There is a good chance over the lifetime of such an
installation of encountering a natural assult of this kind.  So most
installation will be able to deal with it, probably by being underground
which also adds radiation protection and thermal insulation.  The other
problem is one of engineering, how does one accelerate the gm sized object
to these velocities?  Off hand, only two weapons come to mind that would
be similar in concept, the particle beam and the gauss gun.  So this would
be a ship sized gauss spinal mount?  Even so, could it really expell material
at 1/10 light speed?  I\'m not sure without thinking about it longer than
I have already, but I\'m inclined to think not.  Moreover, I assume the ships
have a navigational deflector which would have to be able to deal with 
particles of this size or maybe larger, moving at these velocities, routinely.
Without this deflector, ships moving around our solar system would be taking
a major risk!  (Clarification: Routinely be able to deflect these particles
but not routinely have to.)

In my opinion, you would be better off with missiles.  They do their own
acceleration thus requiring minimum equipment on the ship.  They can track
and evade.  If you stand off a bit, giving them acceleration room, they can
appear on the target ships sensors, moving at great velocities, perhaps
giving them a chance to hit before the ship can react (ie the advantage of
speed, if any, is preserved).  As for detectability, make \'em stealth
missiles :-)

Just how much acceleration can a good mass-driver deliver?  If the ship is
on the order of 100\'s of metres long and the mass-driver is spinally mounted
(so it is as long as the ship), then the acceleration needed is on the order
of 10**11 m/s**2.

Either GDW or DGP (I\'m not sure which) was planning to release a sourcebook
called _Robots_and_Cyborgs_, or something like that, this summer.  It
is supposed to combine _Book_8:__Robots_ and _101_Robots_, among other
things.

Has anyone heard anything about this?  As the two old books are out of print,
and out of reach (for me, anyway), I am rather unable to design and implement
robots.  Since robots ARE an important part of Traveller, this is quite an
inconvenience.

Well, having established that such projectiles are almost  impossible  to
detect  or  stop,  and can have effects ranging up to nuclear levels, how
many terrorist groups/lunatics/whatever would be able to get  hold  of  a
launching system for them ? 

>From the sounds of it, there would be a *lot* of groups with  nothing  to
loose  by using such a device, and it would be perfect for holding entire
systems to ransom - just jump in, deliver a ransom demand, launch  a  few
projectiles &  vanish  before  anyone  even  knows  you\'re  there. Cheap,
re-usable and a real headache for everyone who thought  they  could  keep
order in their universe.

As if teleporting suicide bombers wasn\'t enough to  worry  about,  *now *
we\'ve  got  people  with  guns that make regular missiles look like kid\'s
toys :-) How is a  poor  GM  supposed  to  stop  his  players  bombarding
planets with one of these ?

Anyone care to save the Imperium from chaos & destruction, or do we  just
pretend we hadn\'t thought of it ?

PBEM Midsummer Admin

Notice - the PBEM date is "May 18" - the *first* date I
promised to deliver this turn on...  (Sheepish grin>)

If you:
   are a player,
   don\'t get this and the turn in mail
   read this only in the TML or
	hear about it from a friend

Send me mail, phone, me, SOMETHNG!  I gotta make sure my mailers
are correct and up-to-date.  For this, you can mail me at work.
(Well, I\'m mail admin there now, so I can squeek a few things 
through, but the bean counters still watch.)


Turn 10.10 is mainly to clean up loose ends from a very busy
season last year.  There really was more to do and to say to 
make it a "complete" turn, but too many people are away from
school, or having other personal and/or professional problems
to participate right now.  "Whoa.. We got lives.."

I\'m going on a "drive about" around the NW US (Oregon, Washington,
Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, S. Dak, Wyoming, Idaho, and Oregon - in
more or less that order..) in the very near future.  We\'re leaving
Tuesday afternoon and I\'ll be out of reach of e-mail, and possibly
even telephone, until the 11th of August or so.  Don\'t expect
any quick turn arounds.  If you feel you *must* get hold of me
before then (ha- it\'s probably already too late) try:

   richard@oresoft.com   ---- wk phone (503) 624-6883
or home phones -- (503) 640-9209,  (503) 640-1412


I think in the interest of fairness to those who are out for the
summer, the next turn should happen around the middle of September.
Besides, I want to get a good, complete, summary of what\'s happened
to date ready; we have requests for a single 40K or so version.  

Oh yeah - if anyone has files of the suicide (circa May 10th \'91)
send me copies, please.  I think mine got trashed when I had the
3000 messages problem.  With these, I can recreate his death scene
in a little more color for the summary.


Everyone send James Perkins a note of thanks.  He came over more
than once and helped me fix the car, babysit, work on the turn,
play computer games, listen to me bitch and whine, and generally 
provide a great help to me getting this turn out at all.


Thanks for playing, in spite of your GM.  :=)

================       PBEM Turn 10.10          =========================
================ Break from Mid-Summer Monotony =========================

Historical Synopsis:

(This is **REALLY** condensed!  A much more complete summary 
 will be given in turn 11.0; coming sometime this September.  
 I sort of owe it to the new players.  RJ)

With the assassination of the Emperor barely two years old, the fringes
of known space are becoming prey to warlords, pirates, and opportunists.
On the Imperial frontier, in a nebula near where the Solomani sphere, 
Margaret\'s forces, and Lucan\'s receding empire meet, an intact ringworld
is discovered.  Turskaad Enterprises of the Spinward Marches is first
with the information, and funds an expedition to "R-alpha" for scientific
and commercial gain.  They hire a team of characters run by TML members
and imply there might be a way, through their efforts, to slow down the
enevitable show-down between Lucan and the Solomani.

The expedition leaves quickly and quietly in a jump tender virtually
incapable of self-defense, carrying two modified scouts and a far trader.
During the two-week voyage, the crew is decimated, first falling prey
to a sabateur with a sleeping agent, then to a malicious computer
program, and finally to suicide.

Meanwhile, an Aslan combat/exploration vessel has also just discovered
the ringworld and begun exploration of the surface when the Alcyon 
arrives.  There is clear evidence of widespread sapient life on the
ring itself, as a shuttlecraft is briefly visible to the Aslan.
When the Alcyon re-enters normal space, all aboard are psionically 
greeted.

But first we have to back up the clock about two hours, so we can see
what happens aboard the Alcyon as they discover Adrian...

- - ----
Tail of Turn 10.9

[in the crew\'s muster following the shoot-out at the O.K. engineering 
deck.  Count Ger is speaking.]

"Well, we\'ll be arriving shortly.  We have now completed the *easy* 
part of our mission.  I have it on good authority our sabteur has
met his maker."  He smiles wryly at Abuko.  

"Now, we are about to visit a single world with the same habitable 
surface area as all of the inhabited worlds in the Imperium put 
together." He pauses to let that sink in.  "There are fewer than
forty of us.  We have to find the history of a long-dead race, find 
an intelligent species, and prevent Imperial conflicts from destroying 
this gem of an artifact.

"We are much better prepared for this part of our mission than we were 
for sabotage, however.  Look around you.  We are scientists, we are 
engineers, we are scouts.  Only a few of us are trained killers."  He
slows down just a little.  "And all of us, _all_ .. _of_ .._us_, have
worked our whole lives for this moment.  For this opportunity.

"You have demonstrated a teamwork on board these last few weeks.  
You have demonstrated tenacity in adversity.  And you have demonstrated 
an ability to adapt.  All of these are needed and will serve us in good 
stead in our coming venture. 

"When MY grandchildren ask me what it was like, I will proudly tell them
how wonderful it was to serve with the greatest collection of explorers
ever assembled. 

"I salute each and every one of you.

...

After about three seconds, Ger stands, carefully replaces the chair and
steps pack up on the rise.

"We re-enter our universe shortly after evening mess.  Make sure your
gear is properly stowed, and everything is ready for the transition.
After we arrive, crew of first away team will be posted.

"Dismissed".

[Sorry about having to summarize the actual event, looks like it
 dissapeared at the end of May, when I trashed agora\'s OS...]

Evening mess find Bishop frenetically working with AGNIS on some
project, avoiding all social contact.  At an opportune moment he
slips away.  

A few minutes later, Doctor Vander Merwe rises with a start, punches
his communicator, and tears out of the mess area as though afire.
Very shortly thereafter, medical emergency claxons begin to wail and
Dulinor races through the passageways carrying an inert reporter to
sick bay, followed closely by the doctor.

Looking over the back of a hopping-mad vargr into stateroom 17
you can see strewn remains of personal and professional effects,
textiles in disarray, broken and misplaced artifacts; seeming signs
of a struggle.  \'Vouf is muttering under his breath, and Lazer
is coming down the passageway, obviously intent on keeping people
out of the cabin.

The computer\'s voice fills the ship.  "All hands, All hands.  Transfer
to in-system ships."


- - --Paladin--
Without fanfare, Limner and Ghougzar board and seal the Paladin,
strap themselves in, and don their computer interface garb.

"Lucky stiffs.   Wish I were goin\' with ya.  Ian."


- - --Talisman--
Redd\'s working at his console when the call comes to move to the
Korondor Talisman.  He looks up from his repair work, and starts to
finish what he was doing.  

"All go around here it seems.  Sorry to have to leave you all with
engineering in this state, but someone\'s got to get the Talisman
spaceworthy fast.  It\'s been really interesting working with you all,
let\'s just hope we get to meet up for the trip home." 

He punches up the stats for the Talisman on the computer, and after a
few low-voiced words with Ralf, leaves in a hurry for his cabin.  Minutes
later,  he can be seen arriving at the Korondor Talisman with a pile of
storage drawers thrown onto a trolley and covered with his vac suit - a
trail of lost socks and dented wall panels follows his hurried progress
through the ship.  

"Ahoy, Captain Jonson Sir - Permission to come aboard ? I\'ll drop off
my kit & start some pre-flights, with your permission.  Ralf\'s probably
going to want to handle the software side, and I\'ll take the hardware,
but if Leadfoot got here before us, we could have our work cut out.  If
it had just been taken \'alive\' we might have found out the extent of
it\'s sabotage, but we\'ll just have to manage as best we can."

He pauses to retrieve his issue stun pistol from the floor and throw it back
on top of his neatly wrapped and folded Navy uniform - The Starburst medal
standing out amongst several others.

"I worked on a free trader like this for a while after I left the Navy, we
always had trouble making the payments."


Andon Shrike arrives just a couple of minutes later.
 
On arriving at the Condor, "THUL!!! Where do I dump this stuff?, Where\'s
the bridge? What are the ship stats? Am I supposed to be flying this thing?
What kind of wierd stuff you got wired into this thing? Just a bloody
pogging hour to get used to a new ship, what ..." mumble, mumble, "damn,...".
"Hope your insurance is paid up."


Ian, who can\'t tell when to shut up hollers back at Andon.  "Who\'s! flying
this thing? I thought Andon was a rookie pilot.  Where\'s that XO who
put ME, a bleeping blockade runner on CONTACT.   grrr I\'m tempted to
to put cat-scented soap in his washroom.
 
"HEY! Anybody wanna fly this thing?"
 
At this, Ian will go muttering down the hal back toward the cargo area.
"Damn stoopid fools can\'t keep their folders straight.  I said I was a
pilot and a scientist.  So far I get marathon medkit duty and now CONTACT
whothehelltoldemIknewadamnthingaboutdolphinsanyway...."
 

Thul\'s voice coming from the bridge of the \'Talisman:

"Whoever is going to fly this damn thing better get up here...
This ex-Marine is about to open up the throttle on this thing
and find out if he can do it himself!"
	

Andon will drop his gear where it is, crews lounge, and head forward to the
bridge.  On arriving at the bridge, "Relax Thul, we got, uh..." looks at
chronometer, "a good seven minutes to go." Going over to pilot\'s station,
and sitting down.  "By the way, all my gear is just sitting in your crew\'s
lounge." Andon starts checking all indicators in order, fast, but
efficiently.  "Can we get somebody back there to batten it down?" Continuing
to work as he talks, "Any special access codes I need?" Andon brings up the
appropriate checklist and running through it calls out questions to the other
stations as he goes.  (Who else is here on the Talisman\'s bridge?) "Hey Ian,
get your butt up to the bridge I\'m going to need your help to get us ready
on time." To Thul, "You know I never did say I was a good ships pilot, I
think the XO just liked how I did on the piloting test." Andon doesn\'t wait
for a reply but just keeps on working.

Andon notices a bottle of VERY ancient brandy sitting on the pilot 
console, and that the engines are just about ready for manuever.  
Thul wears a smug, self satisfied look on his face.  "You gotta be
a better pilot than me!  All I\'ve done is read about it! " 



- - --Medical----
Outside Alcyon\'s sickbay, \'Vouf, Ger, and Jett are finishing a rousing,
heated argument about whether to attempt immediate revival of Bishop,
or to slot him indefinetely.  The door is open, and all four doctors,
yorblin, Vander Merwe, Limner, and Tabor get repeatedly dragged into 
the verbal conflict.

It\'s obvious the clock ticks on, both for the Alcyon and for Bishop.
Finally, with little fanfare and with full gravity the Count pulls 
rank, "Slot \'im -- NOW!", turns brusquely, and walks away.  "You
can discuss \'malpractice\' and \'psi-reconstruction\' later.  Get to 
your posts.

Yorblin looks up from the grav gurney where Bishop\'s inert form lies.
The holo display isn\'t pretty, massive areas of neuronal disruption.
Membrane degeneration has been stabilized.  A ventilator maintains
Bishop\'s respirations.  Bishop is ready for nanocyte infusion.  All
Jan has to do is program them for brainstem reconstruction, a half-hour
task at the most.

"Christian, this is ungodly damage, Bishop\'s psych profile must have
been skewed way past the Nornberg crux."

Jan turns as he hears an alert tone, only to realize it\'s coming from
the commdot on his neck.  Listening as he stares at Bishop\'s numbers,
his brow begins to furrow and he frowns slightly.

\'Vouf enters the Sickbay and quietly watches Yorblin as he stabilizes the
journalist\'s condition. Silently, he picks up the datapad hanging at the
foot of the cryocapsule and reads it over. He waits until Yorblin steps 
away from the capsule to go get something, then steps over toward the 
viewport and looks down for a moment at the chill, composed face.
 
With a sudden, convulsive heave, he makes a noise somewhere between a cough
and a sneeze, then limps out of the room. When Yorlbin turns back to his 
work, he finds a glob of gooey spittle running down the viewport\'s side.

"Yorblin copies." He clicks his comm dot off.  "Who did that!?  Lucan -
clean that up!  

"Ger wants me on the command shuttle.  I\'ll get Bishop ready to go, but 
you\'ll have to finish him up.  Limner, you and Tabor can go; the slot\'s 
ready and Dr.  Vander Merwe is handling the infusion.  Thanks for your 
help, even if we do disagree.  It sure beats disagreeing with that twit 
lawyer.

"Security Watch Officer, Yorblin.  I\'ll be down in a bit to draw
my weapons and armor load.  Should be a gauss pistol plus six spare
clips and a CES."

With that Jan turns back to the computer interface to finish his work.



- - --State Room 17--
The once-neat stateroom is a shambles, empty syringe ampoules and tubing
on the floor, spilled contents of boxes and overturned furniture the evidence
of a struggle of some sort.  The door hisses open, and Bhyarrvouf enters,
gingerly favoring his game leg.  He looks around him silently for a moment,
then his eyes fall on the pile of holocrystals on the table and floor.  
 
His eyes narrow for a moment, and he picks up a crystal.  A twitch of an ear
drops the blood-red data monocular in front of his eye, and he picks up the
crystal between thumb and forefinger and holds it gently as if caressing it.
He frowns.  Tossing the crystal away, he picks up another, then another and
another, growing angrier by the minute.  By the time he reaches the end of the
pile, he is panting and his ears are curled back flat.  An armored fist 
clutches the last blank, reformated crystal in the pile, and it explodes into
a puff of fine shards.
 
A string of Vuekadh maledicta snarl from the maddened Vargr.  When he runs out
of swear words in his native tongue, he shifts to Galanglic.  "Miserable drug-
fogged useless limp-tailed baby-humping filthy rotten cowardly gutbucket of a
pus-awful scab-picking JOURRRRRRRRnalist!" A fist slams down on the table.  
"Every crystal erased! Every interview, every record lost! Irreplaceable 
minutiae gone for good, all because you were too scared of life without 
chemicals to keep going, and you wanted your piddling death to mean SOMETHING,
even if it was something AWFUL! You FILTH! You COWARD!" 
 
He turns to the door, eyes plotting.  "I\'m gonna make you PAY for this, 
Bishop," he snarls.  "I poured out my GUTS to you, and you ERASED IT ALL! I\'m 
gonna kill you.  I\'m gonna cut your life support lines while Yorblin isn\'t
looking! I\'m gonna sneak you out of your capsule and run you through the 
biomass processor and serve you to JETT! I\'m gonna, I\'m gonna--"
 
He stops.  A malicious grin spreads over his features.  "No, I\'m not," he 
suddenly says mildly.  "I\'m gonna let you LIVE, Bishop.  I\'m gonna leave you
screaming inside that shredded skull, pleading for those bleeding-hearts in
Sickbay to pull the plug already.  I\'m gonna let that lardbutt lawyer try to
talk the Psionics on this ship into stuffing third-hand memories back into
the holes you left in your mind and stitching it together with welding tape.
I\'m gonna let them turn you into a MONSTER in the name of LIFE and LOVE! 
And on the off chance that you DO wake up and want your old job back...."
 
His grin turns ferocious, and he turns toward a corner of the room, where a
small metallic object rests inert against the wall.  He kneels before it,
wires and tiny manipulator arms extruding like weird growths from his 
gauntlets, and sets to work.


- - --Bridge/Command Shuttle--
Shortly before jump-exit Zben Blaine hears the good news about
being appointed to the Command Shuttle crew.  As soon as the
announcement ends he starts back toward his cabin, while calling up
the computer on his communicator.  "Computer.  Access Zben delta comma
one.  Copy, cross check, and download to Command Shuttle computer all 
programs contained in file code name MasterCommList and code name
ZbensOwn.  Verify."
   
Arriving at his cabin he hurriedly packs his carryall, including
his blowgun case, several well padded bottles of Darrian Brandy,
whatever clean jump suits he has, and puts on his own tailored vacsuit
and PLSS, again moving his bracelet to outside the suit.  No sense
taking chances...  Looking around, he feels a little strange about the
idea that he may be spending quite some time away from the Alcyon.  It
seems like its been home for Much longer than the time he\'s actually
been there.
   
Leaving the cabin, he stops by engineering and `requisitions\' an
electronic repair kit, complete with tools, test equipment, and common
spare parts.  To this he adds a spare communicator, mulitplexer, and
comm-dot set.
   
Next stop is security, where he draws out his own AutoSnub
pistol, and ammo.  [If his blowgun and case are here, rather than his
cabin, he gets those also.]

   
Finally, with a half hour to spare [I hope!], Zben arrives at the
Command shuttle.  [to Etienne] "Zben Blaine reporting, Sir! I\'ll just
stow my pack and get right to it." Stuffing his equipment in the first
secure locker, he returns to the bridge and `sets up shop\',
configuring the Comm panel to his standard and running quick
diagnostics on all Comm gear, inculding the programs he had Computer
download.  Satisfied that all is prepared as well as he can make it, he
greets each new arrival, and has them set up their communicator to
Channel C, for `Command Craft\', i.e.  "Team #1".


 
Up the corridor to security Johann comes pushing a air-cushioned laboratory
table in front of him.  On the table stands a big white plastic box with 
wires and connectors protruding from the open top.
 
"Do you think you could lock this up in a sealed locker? It\'s the remains 
of the mekbot, but I don\'t have the time to finish examining it before we 
exit, and I don\'t think it should just lay around in engineering."
 
He collects his weapons and \'wheels\' the table back towards engineering.

 

- - --Talisman--
When Ralf finally gets caught up to the rest of the crew, he packs 
everything into the midget gcarrier and pops over to the Talisman.  
Somebody better have 4 tons of space to put this thing in!


About fifteen minutes before the Alcyon is scheduled to exit jumpspace,
Nishu comes running down the long connecting passageway to the Korondor
Talisman.  Slung over his shoulder is a beat-up and rather overstuffed black
duffel bag, with a faded Five Sisters logo on its side.  The heavy bag 
doesn\'t seem to slow the breathless navigator down much, as he dodges anyone
who might still be loading supplies at the airlock with a quick apology.

Making his way to the bridge, he comes to a halt at the door and tosses
off a quick half-salute.  "CPO Neriika reporting for duty sorry took longer
to get everything packed than I thought it would where\'s my station?"
   
Once someone points out the navigator\'s chair to him (or he figures it
out himself), Nishu sets his duffel on the deck next to it and sits down.
A few quick taps at the holodynamic console configure it for normal-space
navigation; he runs through the list of system checks, one eye on the
chronometer window counting down to emergence.

When he finishes the checklist, he digs into his duffel for a few 
minutes and comes up with his small video camera, which he pans around the 
bridge of the free trader before sticking it (apparently with a magnet) to a
convenient surface.  Next to come out is his familiar still camera, which
goes around his neck on a cord.  Nishu grins as he snaps a few pictures of
the antics of Andon, Ian, Thul, et al.  

Nishu wears a windbreaker jacket, glossy forest green in color, over
his Turnskaad-issue vacc suit.  The gloves and helmet have been folded and
tucked into the pockets.  As noted, a small still camera hangs around his
neck.  As some of the crew will have seen at breakfast that morning, he\'s
shaved off his familiar beard (but not his mustache); when asked about it,
he simply says that "it was a look that didn\'t work for me." 


 
- - --Cabin 17--
The sobering silence is broken by the soft whirr of the door opening, 
revealing Richard Jett standing in the hallway.  He stands there for 
a minute, looking at the shambles inside the cabin with a vague sense 
of irritation and disgust.

Stepping inside, he carefully sifts through the debris and extracts 
any holo crystals he can find.  He ponders them, muttering some savage 
comments as to Bishop\'s character.  Firmly holding the case in one hand,
 he pivots on his heel and stalks off in the direction of Engineering.

A few minutes later, he walks into Engineering and heads in the direction
of Dr.  Abuko.  He proffers the crystal case to Dr.  Abuko, and says "Doctor,
this is Adrian Bishop\'s set of holocrystals; he erased them just prior to
his suicide attempt.  These contained a vast wealth of information about
the crew and the mission to date that is irreplaceable as a historical
record and for other reasons.  I would like to know if you could take these
and do your best to recover the information therein.  No special hurry,
but as soon as you can spare the time, the better.  Turnskaad would deeply
appreciate it."


- - --Sick Bay and Aurora--
Christian checks the the controls and readouts on Andon and on Bishop
one last time, making sure the autos can handle a long-term watch.  Then he
initiates the wath program, shuts off the lights and takes one step out 
of the door.  Pausing only briefly, he turns around.  "Computer - program
medical auto-alarm.  Ring my frequency; continuous watch."

"There," he says quietly.  "At least we won\'t be having ghosts running
around.  .  .  Ghosts.  Damn! Too many good men already." He shakes his
head sorrowfully and gravely and heads for Aurora.  

"Lucan, Dulinor! Button \'er up and get ready for acceleration.  Two
on board."

Several minutes later, Bhyarrvouf limps as quickly as he can down the 
corridor toward the Aurora.  Anyone left aboard the Alcyon sees a
familiar object about the size of a basketball, floating obediently
behind him as he enters....



- - --Bridge/Command Shuttle--
Etienne steps through the airlock into the Command Shuttle and turns
into the main passageway, heading toward the bridge.  Just outside the
bridge he stops just long enough to strap his carry-sack into one of
the lockers.  He is still carrying a weapon bag that is almost a meter
long.
 
He steps into the bridge and greets those who are already present, then
straps his gun case to the decking just under the pilot\'s cosole.
 
He settles into the acceleration couch and touches the auto-adjust controls.
Even before his seat is finished adjusting itself to his body, his hands
are reconfiguring the controls, running self-tests and beginning the preflight 
check list.
 
Just a few minutes before jump exit, Johann comes running towards the lock
of the command shuttle.  The first thing that strikes those waiting anxiously
in the shuttle as out of the ordinary is that he is wearing a civilian tailored
vacc suit, all the time up to now he\'s only worn civilian indoor clothes.
The second thing they notice is that he, likewise for the first time, is
actually wearing the stun-gun in it\'s holster attached to the utility belt on
the suit.  He is carrying a backpack and one rather big, yellow bags that seems 
to be made of the same almost non-destructible cloth the scouts make their
utility vests out of, and three green boxes marked \'Interstellarms\'.  One is
about the size of a pre-stellar dictionary volume, the second, which hangs on
his back is a little over one meter long and the third, about one foot cube,
wears a big yellow and black triangle declaring that the contents are explosive.
 In addition to all this, he of course wears the \'normal loadout\' of hand
computer, commdots etc.
 
"Sorry I\'m late, I had to catch Bit again." he explains as he enters the 
shuttle and those nearest to the entry can see that the \'goldfish-bowl\' style
helmet that hangs on the backpack is closed with a net and has a furry 
inhabitant.  "Is there any locker onboard for this?" Johann asks and indicates
the three green boxes.

After everything has been stowed, Johann assembles Bits airtight transparent
transport cage, places it on top of the sensor console and hooks it up to the
central oxygen supply.  "I\'m sorry for this, Bit, But you are much safer in
there if we have to decompress the shuttle."
 
Etienne addresses those on the bridge, "All stations report.  Monsieur Blaine
please contact the other ships, including the fighter, and request their
status."

Almost at the preidicted moment, the jump warning sounds, and the lights 
dim.  Once again, everyone is subjected to that annoying, nauseating, 
tumbling, feeling, and the pale blue glow on all the outside monitors 
is replaced by starlight and sunlight.

 "Normal space, Sir.  Launch countdown activated." [10...9.....2...1]

A slight jar heralds the shuttle\'s departure from the Alcyon, as all of the
sensor displays activate.  Etienne\'s eyes linger on the spectacle of the 
ringworld for only a moment then return to his controls.
 
Looking out any viewport, you can see just how good a jump this was.
In an arc stretching from as far as you can see forward to as far as
you can see aft, and slightly below the Alcyon, is a wall of dark, gray,
metal, with sunlight shining off the edges.  Far forward you can see
a second arc and far aft is a third.  These two are tiny silvery bands
that begin well away from the vanishing points of the metal floor, and
extend around, behind, and above a shimmering greenish-yellow star.
These tiny bands almost connect above the star, giving the appearance
of a halo.  Keen eyes detect a very slight fuzziness at the edges of
the "floor" near you.

Inward from the first ring, a second becomes visible.  It is in a plane
with the first ring, but much smaller, and much darker.   

The inside of the ring is visible fore and aft of Alcyon as the wall
arcs away from you.  You can clearly see forests, seas, deserts, islands,
continets, and various signs of life - villages, smoke, roads.  Motion
detectors tell of flying creatures as well.

Everyone hears, from just over her or his left shoulder a quiet, soothing,
alien, voice.  In each person\'s native tounge comes the message:

"Welcome.  We have been expecting you.  An envoy will be up shortly
to show you where to dock.  The peace of the cosmos be with you."

None of the typical intercept or probing signals appear on the ship\'s
sensors.

Etienne doesn\'t bother looking up from his console as the disembodied voice 
echos in his head (in the ancient French language of his childhood), but he 
does mutter "No, it couldn\'t be a simple landing beacon, could it?"

Johann fires up every passive sensor there is.  "Vegetation, Life, 
Civilization signs ....  and a Second ring! I don\'t believe this! 
There is an inner ring inside R-alpha!, Noone is scanning us actively, 
by the way and no navigation beacons or anything like that." Johann 
turns towards the rest of the crew of the shuttle and says, when he sees 
that everyone is looking over their left shoulders.  

Johann gets a puzzled expression "What? What\'s the matter? What\'s 
happening?" he glances back at his console "The sensors has still not 
detected out of the ordinary....  Aside from R-alpha, that is..."



- - --Talisman--
As the Talisman emerges from jump space, Joachim stares at the screen
with strange, almost haunted, wistful look on his face.  

"So this is my new home...rather pretty...and big enough for anyone.
Wonder what the people are like? There\'s got to be some...

<<From just over Joachim\'s left shoulder comes a quiet, soothing,
alien, voice.
"Welcome.  We have been expecting you.  An envoy will be up shortly
to show you where to dock.  The peace of the cosmos be with you.">>

"Oh shit! Not more plague blighted telepaths! How much longer can I
hide this way!"

For an instant Joachim pales with panic; then another instant of rigid
self control; then a sort of resignation.

"Maybe, just maybe, they won\'t care about my past...they certainly
can\'t be connected to THEM...can they?...too late now anyway...I
daren\'t go back."

Suddenly Dr.  Tabor breaks into quite giggles.

"At least this may quiet down those ethical twits\' arguments about how
to save that damned prying journalist...he certainly did himself good
though...almost a pity to see it undone.  Looks like my new career is
wrecked though, these folks are probably better doctors than any of us"



 
=================== Meanwhile, on R-alpha ============================

Admiral Akhouw and his hardy band of adventurers is watching a kythui
village.

A 50 kg omnivore/hunter, the typical Kyth stands about 1.2 m tall.
It is vaguely humanoid in appearance (bilaterally symmetric, 2 arms,
2 legs) and covered in short, dark green fur.  It has a short muzzle
full of sharp teeth, and small, pointed ears set high up on the head.
The eyes are round and staring, with a yellow or orange tint to them.
 
The kythui appear to have descended from a race native to the planet 
Rorise in the Mora subsector of the Spinward Marches.  Rorise is a 
very cold world and the Kythui are well adapted to cold conditions, 
but they are rugged and versatile enough to live in a wide range of 
environments.
 
Kythui are not particularly intelligent, but they do have a degree 
of low cunning which makes them dangerous.  They make a living from
hunting and trapping, and they are highly adept at laying ambushes.
Technology is really only at level 0, with favoured weapons being
spears and bows.  They are nomadic and usually live in tents made
of animal hide.
 
Kythui tend to be aggressive and belligerent by nature, and their
social hierarchy is determined to a large extent by who is the
strongest and meanest.  They admire a strong leader.  They seem to
enjoy bullying Chirpers (if they can catch them by surprise before
the Chirpers manage to pull their nifty vanishing act).
 
The Kythui are also highly superstitious, and there is often a
tribal shaman who is accorded great reverence.  

One common test of a Kyth\'s strength and prowess is to be able to
tame and ride a gara.  Garui are 400 kilos of pure nastiness:
muscular quadrupedal carnivore/killers with thick, wrinkled, hairless
black skin and long muzzles with teeth even bigger and sharper than
those of their little furry masters.  A favourite Kythui activity
is to fight inter-tribal battles between gara-mounted warriors.
 
The village the Aslan watch seems to be getting larger, as kythui
from neighboring territories arrive and set up camp around a 
great central clearing.  They seem to be preparing for a major
event of some kind.

 
The aslan choose to send a ship to a spillwall and back to scout, and
have a second group watch the kythui covertly.

Hryawi takes the "high guard" group and reports back that evening 
with some "hard" information (that the Alcyon will quickly be 
privy to as well). The ring is 3000 km wide. [I don\'t know why I 
made it so skinny, but it\'s in turn 0 if ya wanna look it up :=(.]  
The spillwall is 100 km tall, and about 60 km wide at the base, 
forming a moutain range.

The ring does *NOT* spin at 1200 km/s.  It spins at about 250 km/s --
enough to stabilize it, but only enough for about 1/6 g \'native\'.  The
remainder of gravity appears to come from a comprehensive system of
advanced grav plates.  (Note: at this distance, solar orbital V is 
about 30 km/s.)

Despite the advanced age, there appears to be no obvious signs of
previous habitation by the pernicious TL6-TL9 world-trashers in 
this area.  Currently, there are tens of thousands of Kythui clans
in the area, on their way to this gathering.

Chirpers, as expected, abound.  Usually they make great prey for
the Kythui\'s beasts.

Atop the spillwall, at regular intervals are devices that appear to
be airlocks of some kind.  Some are easily large enough to house
good-sized ships, but all attempts to open them have been fruitless.

The "outside" of the ring seems to be remarkably pock-mark free.  
Attaching things to it physically (rather than magnetically) cause
expulsion of the probe and a seal of the breach.  It seems to be 
a material uniform in strength and consistency and color.

After a full day of intelligence gathering, Hryawi and his clan
return.  The following morning, Akhouw orders a contact team.  "It\'s
time, people.  One to stand on the rise at lightfall (there is no
real "dawn" here, the sun always directly overhead), the rest to cover.
Who will volunteer to stand?"

A chorus of voices returns the request (naturally).  The honor falls
on a young seargant, fresh from the tank corps.


- - --Phins--
Doejin leaves the interminable conference on "visitors" and heads
for his tender.  "Anyone coming with me?  I\'ll emmissary out to the 
small ships.  Ian\'s back.  Don\'t you guys wanna say \'hi\'?"  Ferdy
is right behind Doejin, and Katie simply WILL NOT be left out!

Porting to the lock and getting into the tender, he worries.  "C\'mon
Hoop.  give me some clues here.  I\'ve never done this before.  Whadda
do I do?  WhadoIsay?  Will they like me?  Will they remember?"

Sending messages of greeting, Doejin scans for weapons and activity
modes.   I will send voice messages in response to any communications 
query.  


- - --Deep in the bowels of R-alpha--
Iasic notices a new kind of surface activity, and begins to reprogram
himself onto an outer portal.


================== Back in Space ==================

Aboard the Alcyon, systems go into standby as a skeleton, volunteer,
crew prepare for a long, perhaps permanent, wait.  The small ships
quickly accelerate away from Alcyon.  No one waves good-bye.  In
engineering, a melted, fused, lamp, won\'t get changed.

Sensors on all five pick ships up the signal as one:

"Welcome, welcome" in a slightly (about 20 years) out-of-date ganglic.
It comes from a moving source near the ring, and is accompanied by
an active EM scan.  Trained psi\'s also hear the message psionically
repeated.  "We welcome you, our visitors.  Come visit.  Come share
play."

Nishu spots it first.  "Small ship.  Shuttle or Pinnace.  Hydrogen
drive with reaction boost.  Coming in our general direction.  No
weapons systems readouts.  Too far away still to count life forms.

At that moment, the ship furthest out is the first to hear:

"Mayday, Mayday, Mayday this is Scout six eight Alpha Charlie ISS
Bernoulli.  We have one Ael Yael aboard, one dead, explosion aboard.  Jump
Drive out.  Maneuver drive damaged.  We have life support, and fuel for
five zero four hours.  Request assistance.  We have wounded aboard.
Transponder set for double seven double zero.  This is the ISS Bernoulli
broadcasting on one two one point five."

The message is in a loop broadcast by the ships computer with updated fuel
readings.  There\'s not much fuel aboard.  Sensors indicate a jump transition
has just occurred about 25 light-minutes away, and the ship is now somewhat 
outbound, well off the ecliptic, retrograde.

Scout Ship has accel of 2 G\'s.  As such it will reach 1/10 speed of light

you toss your one cubic centimeter lead pellets out the airlock.

And for those of you who say an atmostphere will protect you...
Remember that pellet still has the same energy.  It just gets transferred
to the atmosphere.  ie an atmospheric release of energy instead of on
impact.  If you use say a Cubic meter of lead, it will release
energy in the range of Gigatons of TNT.  YES GIGAtons.

That is a very lot of energy.  one billion tons of TNT.

No atmosphere will protect you.  Kilometers of overhead rock won\'t either
You are Dead  DEAD Dead dead Dead Dead dead deaD.

As far as I know, there is no navigational deflector (ala star trek) in
Trav, and as I said before, it would have 16 seconds to pick up the target
and act on it before the object streaked from Far Orbit range to impact.

No Defence.  Well, you might try shifting your orbit randomly if you are
a ship or a space station (I\'m sure they do to prevent this)  But a
ground target is dead.  On the other hand, If you got a stooge in the
control tower, they could order an orbiting craft into the correct orbit
in order to destroy it.  But I\'ll leave that to you intelligence types.

Actually, there are *four* classes:
1. Large & slow (asteroid?)
	mass: million of tons and up
	speed: 1-50 km/sec
	delivery system: requires installing ship class drives on a
		suitable "rock" and using *lots* of fuel
	detection: easily detected by a medium tech level civilization
		(but *we* would be in trouble!)
	defense: difficult to destroy, you tend to get a *nasty* meteor
		shower. Deflection is easier *if* time permits.
		Atmosphere is not a defense!
 
2. medium and fast (ship?)
	mass: hundreds of tons
	speed: 50-500 km/sec
	delivery system: Requires an expendable ship, and a lot of
		fuel. Maybe drop tanks and an AI?
	detection: normal
	defense: somewhat more difficult than against a normal ship

3. small and fast
	mass: tens of kg
	speed: 10-100 kn/sec
	delivery system: Requires a mass driver we could build *now*.
		And which would fit in a medium size ship
		(disassembled). You set it up on a convenient asteriod
		or build extra bracing and attach it to a comet
		nucleues (free fuel!)
	detection: *very* difficult. An 8 kg steel projectile occupies
		approximately one liter. that\'s a ridiculously small
		cross section for most detector systems. And this thing
		will be at ambient temperature, and could easily have
		an anti-radar coating.
	defense: unlikely. This will hit as hard as a large missile.
		And the odds of a *natural* impact in this range is so
		rare that non-military vessels and installations won\'t
		be armored against it.  (note that in the (low* end of
		this speed range a *paint flake* blasted a 1-cm pit
		into a shuttle window). Planetary atmosphere should be
		a decent defense, but not guaranteed. (They\'d be like
		an artillery barrage if they hit the ground intact,
		which *is* doable!)

4. very small and oh-my-god!
	mass: grams
	speed: 1000+ km/sec
	delivery system: requires one *hell* of a mass driver or
		railgun, but possibly doable even now. Maybe
		installable in a large ship.
	detection: impossible in any practical sense.
	defense: impossible in any practical sense. Atmosphere is a
		defense except for projectiles at a high fraction of

I don\'t have any figures handy. I *may* try bothering a casual
acquaintance at Lawrence Livermore Labs who has worked on railguns and
massdrivers. I\'ve seen an (unused) test projectile. A 1 cm x 1 cm x
.4 cm  block of glass reinforced by some sort of fibers (boron?). They
don\'t use steel because it *flows* at these accelerations... (If I
remember something from an unrelated bit of trivia properly, this means
they must be doing better than 10^7 gs, as a 10^7 g centrifuge exists
and is built of steel...)

I *think* they were getting 10-100 kn/s out of something less than 10
meters long. And dangerous velocities out of a *one* meter unit.

Any materials sciense folks out there care to look up what pressure it
takes to make steel flow noticeably in *milliseconds*? 

The real trick is that a railgun *eats* power. All that kinetic energy
has to be fed into the gun as power. On the other hand, it\'s very
eficient at making the conversion.

    'body' => '[Discussion regarding 2300 and other Traveller-related rulesets are
welcome on the TML -- James]

Greetings, Traveller mailing list!  I\'ve been lurking here for quite a
while in anticipation of someday getting back into Traveller, and now
I am (as a ref, no less), and I have some questions to throw out for
discussion.

Foundations: just what are they?  The Adventurer\'s Guide states (or
implies) that nationalism declines significantly as a result of the
Twilight War and foundations arise as sources of group identity.  (For
the non-2300 people, a foundation, as far as I can tell, is a
semi-private organization, like a corporation or a union.)  That\'s
fine and dandy, but then, in the list of major wars fought over the
last 300 years, all belligerents are COUNTRIES, not a single
foundation.  So what gives?  If people come to think of themselves as
members of no one nation, they must be members of SOME group, namely,
foundations.

Agree so far?  To be pedantic, every individual must be a member of
some "tribe", for self-defense (or effective aggression, for that
matter) and for social care.  By "social care", I mean that
nonproductive members of society must still be taken care of, since a
certain fraction of any self-supporting society will be nonproductive.
Children, retirees, the ill, and the temporarily unemployed are
obvious examples.

So, to some extent, we\'ve done away with the nation-state as the
provider of these services.  Meaning foundations must have the ability
to go head-to-head with national gov\'ts in times of conflict, and must
have the economic resources to provide care for its nonproductive
members.  (Military ability can also be stated in terms of economics,
because weapons can almost always be bought SOMEWHERE.)  Where does
that economic ability come from?  Taxes.

So, what\'s necessary for a decent tax base?  Essentially, a GNP
(and/or citizens with a taxable income).  My economics is getting a
little shaky here.  So let\'s pick a foundation-like 20th-century
organization: IBM or Nippon Telephone & Telegraph.  These guys provide
day-care, pensions, education for employees.  In some cases, housing
(witness the "mill villages" of early 20th-century textile
corporations).  Health care.  Insurance (same thing).  Company stores.
All kinds of nifty things.  And what pays for all this is PROFITS.
(Or gross income.)  But the question in my mind is: can (semi-)private
organizations support the additional burden of a navy and troops?  The
chronically unemployed?  Drugs?  Permanently (semi-)disabled citizens
(mental retardation, cancer, what else)?  Any opinions on this?

Suppose the foundation is truly viable, providing some service to the
universe in general and using its income to care for its citizens.  Do
national governments still regard those people as citizens of that
government?  If so, they would still be subject to that gov\'t\'s taxes.
(No, I do NOT believe national governments will, out of the goodness
of their hearts, refrain from taxing those individuals who claim not
to be citizens.  The only reason national gov\'ts today don\'t tax each
other\'s citizens is because everybody has got the military ability to
prevent that kind of behavior (or has the right allies).)

So, we have the slow growth of foundations as social/political bodies,
and the need for the foundations to tax their citizens (even
indirectly, as in profit-sharing (wherein costs of "government" are
deducted from profits BEFORE they are distributed to "employees"))
coming into conflict w/the national gov\'ts taxing the same people.
(Go back over those parentheses; I know they\'re confusing.  :)  )

Agree so far?  If so, where are the dadgum
foundation-vs.-national-gov\'t wars?  Do I have to modify some of the
last 300 years\' history?

John.

  The first question in this case is, when the map (MegaTraveller) and the 
terrain (physics) don\'t agree, do we follow the map or the terrain? Personally
I prefer the terrain.

  The trouble is that the scoutship is taking a shortcut through a big hole in
the rules, since the kinetic energy contained in the scoutship at 0.1c is about
1/14th of the *total* energy contained in the mass of the ship (!).
  To supply that amount of energy in five days the ships powerplant has to have
an effect of 2,812,500,000 MW which is a little large in a 1350m3 hull. With a
powerplant on 1000 MW it would take the ship 38,520 years to reach 0.1c and the
fuelvolume for that endurance is also a little large for a 1350m3 hull:)

  The maximum velocity of a projectile launched with a MD designed according to
the 3G system is about 129km/s, and the projectile in this case is a 2mm light-
weight sphere.
  The reason behind this that the mimimum diameter of the projectile increase
with increasing energy of the projectile, but the energy required for a certain
speed increase faster...

  I\'ll look at how speeds that can be reached if one stack several accelerators
after eachother and assume that the energy add is equal for each accelerator, 
but I\'m lost without a spreadsheet right now:)

  As for what material to make the projectiles of, why not take some junk 
artifacts of monadium? If it is as indestructible as it is described to be, it
shouldn\'t suffer from ablation at high speeds.

Speed of light = 3*10**8 m/s
2*G = 19.6 m/s**2 (near enough for this purpose, anyway)
Time to accelerate to 3*10**7 m/s = 18 days, neglecting the effects of
relativity.

In which case, what protects the ship, now travelling at 0.1c, from the first
dust particle it hits?

You\'re going to have to do all the accelerating blind, because you\'re out of
sensor range.  If you\'re in sensor range, someone on the planet has 18 days\'
warning that you are accelerating yourself at him, and plenty of time to get
your ship with a meson gun or nuclear missile.  Or even a sandcaster, whose
particles you are going to collide with at something less than 0.1c, but still
fast enough to do interesting things to your ship.  So, you have to fire blind.
Your chances of hitting a ship this way are virtually nil; by the time you\'ve
finished accelerating, the ship has probably done what it came to the planet
to do, and long since left.  Assuming you can find someone prepared to fly a
ship at 0.1c without navigational deflectors (hint - not any character I\'m
running :-) you might be able to attack the planet, whose course is entirely
predictable.

There\'s a discussion going on about powered armour - battledress to you.
Summary so far:

Pros:
	Gives protection against small-arms fire and shrapnel
	High-tech sensors make the soldier more aware of the surroundings
	Allows the soldier to carry heavier weapons

Cons:
	Very expensive to issue to general infantry
	Difficult to maintain
	Difficult to train the soldiers to use it properly, as well
	  as perform field-level maintenance on it
	New weapons will be developed to counter it
	May restrict the soldier\'s mobility

There are also various concepts of what powered armour would actually be,
varying from an armoured NBC suit with additional sensors (like MT Combat
Armour), to a one-man tank, to the huge monsters favoured by Japanese
cartoons.

velocity = acceleration * time.

1 g = 9.8 m/s^2
c   = 3e8 m/s

thus at 1 g it takes a bit over 354 *days* to reach c (ignoring
relativistic effects). A good "rule of thumb" is that c is 1 g for 1
year. 

So 1/10th c takes 35 days at 1 g, 18 days at 2 g. This is noticeably
above the "one week at full thrust" "rule" I recall from original
Traveller. Also note that you will need *double* this, as you have to
slow down *sometime*! Doesn\'t MegaTrav have a "one month\'s fuel" figure
used in designs? Looks like you need *at least* a 3 g ship to do it.

Oh yes, at this speed your tau factor is .995 :-)

to reach 1/10th c
accel	time 		distance
1	35 days		4.6e10 km
2	18 days		2.3e10 km
3	12 days		1.5e10 km
4	 9 days		1.1e10 km
5	 7 days		9.2e09 km
6	 6 days 	7.7e09 km

I\'d like to thank people for all the sharing Traveller materials and
software via anonymous ftp.  I feel that sharing of this kind
contributes greatly to the value of the TML, and inspires interest and
comment from people who work with the materials.  However, a problem has
begun to develop.

My concern is that there are now over half a dozen ftp sites carrying
various and sundry items of interest to TMLers, three "official"
(documented) sites, and a few that have only been mentioned in TML
messages.  When a new TML member asks what materials are available and
how to get them, I email them a cross-reference document which I
maintain.  This document is getting larger and larger, with more and
more sites, and it is difficult to keep it always up-to-date.  As a
result, I\'d like to suggest the following policy:

	Hereafter, sunbane.engrg.uwo.ca (129.100.100.12) should be
	considered the primary TML ftp site.  I\'d like people who are
	post software, data, or other materials to share, to announce
	its availability on sunbane in preference to other sites, if at
	all possible.

The reason for this policy is because, while ftp is wonderful, it is
difficult for me and TML members to keep track of and remember (and
document) where all these valuable contributions are located.  If I can
keep them in as few places as possible, I can tell new TML members and
members asking questions, "Look on sunbane! Almost everything\'s there,
and here are the one or two exceptions." Keeping it in one archive site
also makes browsing easier.

I\'d like to hear people\'s opinion on this policy, particularly those
known to be administering ftp sites for the TML: Dan Corrin, George
Herbert, Bill Wilson, and Ryan Cambell.

decline of nationalism, there are several solutions to the problem. The first 
is that the governments continue to provide the services such as care for the
elderly, and maintenance of the military, but that the citizenship doesn\'t take 
it quite as religeously. Many people have health insurance, but few can be said
to be loyal to ones insurance company in the same way that they are to their
country. Possibly the existence of space travel and colony worlds makes gaining
more population a great adventage to the governments, who then compete for
people in a capitalist like environment, getting along by means of a very
complex set of treaties. An interesting adventure might involve a character
trying to change citizenship.
 Another possibility, more interesting but less main stream, is that the
governments really are no longer supplying these services, and that some sort
of religeous organization (probably humanist in nature, if one is not to
upset the social character to radically) might be supporting the handicaped,
etc., through donations. Possibly such an organization has some sort of 
military might as well. Such an organization could be a very interesting
one adventure wise. A religeous army would probably have some sort of code
of honor. It will probably not have legal juristiction anywhere, and so may
be underground, and not recognized by the religeon "officially". Its 
relations to other religeons would be interesting, possibly enev involving
holy wars, etc. Note that by religeon I don\'t necessarily mean that they 
worship something (Taoists don\'t seem to), or believe in extra-scientific
powers (and in a 2300 like setting, nobody could actually have such powers 
(though they could believe in them) without
drastically altering the character of the game.), but only they they have a
common moral code and a means of inspiring large numbers of people to follow
that code, usually through ritual. (Of course, bribary by powers or threat by 
"gods" are more common methods.)
 What sort of new religeon would develop in the next 300 years? Maybe something
based on the vary "new age" ideas of Geanism. Another possibility would be 
something which would claim to unify the different religeons. If one wanted
to have a "secret society" bent to their world, one could base an organization
off of the Free Masons (I don\'t know how factually accurate it is on "real"
free masons, but Robert A. Wilsons _Historical Illuminatus_ might be of use
here.), or a religeon along the lines of the "Speaker for the Dead"
group found in Orson Scott Cards  _Enders Game_ series. Possibly more than
one of these could come into existance, creating more interesting scenerios...

If you have velocity dumpers or matter energy converters in your
(likely) nontraveller games, tau factor becomes VERY interesting...

In case you didn\'t know, tau is multiplied to time to get relativistic
time (though I seem to recall actual lags only occur during acceleration
or something... relativity is more complicated than it appears), mass
and length are multiplied by the inverse.

tau = sqrroot (1- velocity^2/c^2)

I find it very useful to use percent of light^2 instead of
velocity^2/c^2, since it\'s the same thing.

A fun little rule... tau factor of .5 (mass and length doubled, time
halved) corresponds to 86.6% light speed... so if you convert 1/2 of a
mass to energy and dump it in the other 1/2, that\'s it\'s speed.

(with energy equal to that 1/2 mass x c^2! Whee!)

If 
Bertil is correct in his calculations (No I\'m not going to double check)
It is impossible for the scout to reach .1c.  Insufficient total energy.

But, I might point out that in order for traveller engines to work, we must
accept the fact that
1	The scout ship has 2G capable engines.
2	The fuel volume is capable of lasting 30 days.

These are the underlying assumptions of all traveler designs.  The number of
Megawatts of power input is a guesswork based on metaphysics.  If your
argument is based on that fact then we are arguing about metaphysics.

My point is that starship engines are based upon the fact that they are
supposed to be capable of boosting a ship at accelerations from 1G to 6G
10 to 60 meters per second for a period of thirty days.

If you accept that fact, then .1c is in.

If you look at it from a total energy avaliable perspective, I would question
the basis of the equations you use for available energy.  If you base it upon
the megatraveller power plant output, then you are questioning the very basis
of the power plants.  But remember, the power plants were designed (by GDW)
to account for the performance of non existant forms of locomotion.

If as you suggest a ship has only 1/14th the required energy to reach .1c
then the ship should only be able to accelerate at 2/14 G\'s (1/7 G) and
so the scout chip can not perform as it is required to perform.

Some people say they miss High Guard.  I miss Book 2.  they didn\'t even try
to guess what a power plant could put out so conservation of energy wasn\'t
a factor.  (sigh)

Ah well, It seems to me it just comes down to what brand of metaphysics
you prefer.  How many ancients can dance on the head of a pin?

As to the point that the free traders and scouts are shy a few days of fuel:
Well, use your cargo bay to hold more.

As to the point of flying blind.  Of course you are!  But out of the eccliptic
you mightn\'t have too much trouble.  (Fred, you knew the job was dangerous
when you took it!)   You don\'t need to be in sensor range if your target is
in a fixed orbit or on the ground.  Just plug in that intercept course and
let her rip.

As to finding crews to do it...  Well, you might\'nt volunteer, but I\'ll bet
anyone desparate enough to try this little trick could find some poor shmuck
desparate enough to try it.  Or, just put it on auto-pilot.  And if on
auto-pilot, and you got scout ships to spare, just send it in as the projectile.
The Japanese had quite a few people get in the cockpit of a Kamikazie (sp?)

Nor did High Guard, as far as I remember.  It gave the output of a power plant,
and the requiremts of various power-consuming systems, in terms of Energy
Points (which should tell you something about the physics knowledge of the
authors :-) .  It was Striker which dealt with MW, and as it gave MW-rated
equivalents of ship-borne weapons, one could convert Energy Points into MW.

> As to the point of flying blind.

Blind, as in you can\'t see the target.  Not blind, as in you can\'t see what\'s
in front of you.  (Avoiding what\'s in front of you when your speed is about
3*10**7 m/s and your acceleration is about 20 m/s**2 is a problem, though.)

Which was what I said.  If the target is something fixed, e.g. a planet, then
you might hit it.  If the target is capable of acceleration (e.g. a ship) then
it probably won\'t be there when you arrive, because it will have its own
reasons for leaving.  (_When_ you arrive?  More like _if_ you arrive!)

> The Japanese had quite a few people get in the cockpit of a Kamikazie (sp?)

But a Kamikaze had a chance of getting to the target, and it was there that
he intended to die.  Flying a spaceship at 0.1c, you won\'t hit the target.
You won\'t be hit by the target\'s defences.  You\'ll hit a few particles of dust
on the way, and turn into a few particles of dust yourself.

There wasn\'t much left of either ship.  From "Adventure 1: The Kinunir":

Allamu (BC-9516) was caught in the van at the Battle of Two Suns, 1084, and
withstood over four hours of steady attack before suffering screen failure.
Lost with all hands.

Ninkur Sagga (BC-9521) suffered either a spontaneous missile detonation or a
freak globe screen failure (accounts differ) while engaged on the port dorsal
flank at the Battle of Two Suns, 1084.  Lost with all hands.


It\'s worth noting that General Products, the producers of the Vulture, got the
contract for four Kinunir class cruisers.  One (Kinunir) disappeared without
trace in 1088, and hasn\'t been found since unless you\'ve played Adventure 1 or
made up your own scenario.  One (Ninkur Sagga) was destroyed by malfunction,
as described above.  One (Gaesh) barely passed trials, and was gutted and
converted to a prison ship without drives or weapons.  One (Adda Dubsar) was
scrapped before it was even completed.  GP does not have a good record with the
Kinunir class!

Incidentally, can someone explain how two battle fleets came to meet midway
between two separate star systems (Yres and Menorb)?

This must have come as a surprise to the Imperial Navy, who converted it to
a Frontier Cruiser by rearming it with a meson gun and altering some of the
secondary weaponry.  This conversion commenced in 1083, and was completed in
1085.  The conversion was delayed by the Fourth Frontier War, during which
conversion was suspended while the ship stood guard over the shipyard.  Bard
Enterprise was in service, in the Solomani Sphere, up to at least 1107 (the
date of the source of the above information, "Supplement 5 - Lightning Class
Cruisers", which came free with the board game "Azhanti High Lightning").
>From the same source, the following ships were lost during the Fourth Frontier
War:
Haunting Thunder
Threatening Vengeance
Bard Warlord

And the following were lost in operations postwar (1085-1105):
Loathesome Reverie
Luriani High Lightning
Echo Intruder
Guardian Rainbow
Infrequent Hazard
Arrival Scourge
Exhausted Venture
Cause Rampant

I couldn\'t find any information on the exact fates of any of the above ships,
with the exception of the Haunting Thunder.  That ship was engaged in commerce
raiding during the beginning of the Fourth Frontier War, and was caught at
Querion.  It was jumped by SDB\'s as it attempted to refuel at the secondary
gas giant, and just kept going into the gas giant.  One of the scenarios in
"Azhanti High Lightning" is based on this ship.  The other names are open for
speculation.

  Ok, I admit that using real physics on an SF RPG is a rather dirty trick:)

  I did one error, but it has only minor effect on the results.

  A scoutship weighs about 1350 tons, Ignoring relativistic effects (which I
suspect are of marginal effect at 0.1c, and in any case they will just make it
*harder* to reach 0.1c), it\'s kinetic energy at 0.1c is mv^2/2:

  1.35e6 * 3e7^2 / 2 = 6.075e20 Joules.

  The total energy contained in the mass of the ship is mc^2:

  1.35e6 * 3e8^2 = 1.215e23 Joules.

  So the energy equals 1/200th of the ships total mass. (Not 1/14th as I said,
but that\'s what happens when I play physicist, stupid me <kick!> <ouch!> :)

  1/200th of the ships mass is 6.75 tons, ie about 100kl of hydrogen, but 
fusion gives far less energy than total mass->energy conversion so it is still
unlikely that the fuel will contain enough energy.

  (Yes, ok, the calculations contain errors, the relativistic effects for one
thing, and the ship will become lighter as it uses fuel, thereby requiring less
energy, but I think these effects are minor.)

  There is one way out of this dilemma, and that is to assume that the engines
are *not* reactionless but that they have exhaust and that exhaust has a certain
speed. Their acceleration will (If I understand it correctly) decrease as the
ship comes closer to that speed. 
  That way the ship will still mostly have a 2G acceleration in it\'s typical
envelope (planet to 100diameters, in-system transfers etc) but if someone 
tries to take it outside that envelope by for example going full tilt for 
more than a week, the acceleration will decrease.

  This will unfortunately mean that all calculations of acceleration, range and
time will become very complex....

  Every time you double the speed, the energy required quadruples. So it is
quite possible to have a ship that can do 2G in a low speed interval but can\'t 
do more than 1/200th G in a higher speed interval.

> Ah well, It seems to me it just comes down to what brand of metaphysics

  That depends on if the pin is made of monadium, and on how many ancients
there are left that are able to dance, and on if the coyns say that dancing is
a good idea:)

  Yes, I remember reading or hearing (TML perhaps) about that incident. I think
it was someone that described Lucans intolerance to failures. An admiral had 
gotten the order not to retreat from any hi-pop worlds under any circumstances,
so when he(?) was forced to do that anyway he(?) made sure that it wasn\'t a 
hi-pop world any longer...

  I think that a big part of the impact of this story is that doing this to a
world is totally unthinkable, so the message Lucan sent was "I\'d rather that 
you do the unthinkable than fail to obey my orders."

Just for the record, the argument is between classical physics and the
modifications of relativity as identified by Einstein and Lorenz.  This is
not metaphysics (which deals with philosophy.)

The real issue is one of game balance.  The game was designed to be able to
role play in the future.  The game was not intended to require the players
and referee to calculate the intricacies of relativistic flight.

The purpose behind the drives was not necessarily to develop large mass
driver weapons and planetary destruction.  They were made to move a
ship from point "A" to point "B" and have the crew do something interesting
at point "B" (other than die in a large ball of fire.)

If a player wanted to play with these types of speeds, I would make him do the
calcs and figure out the fuel requirements and drive requirements.  This type
of play being outside the bounds of the game design to begin with.

Also, just for the record, if the speeds are less than about .1c, the effects
of relativity can be neglected in general.  Mass increase is about half a
percent at this speed.

armor rules for animals (what?), mass-independent drives (okay, so I\'ll 
suffer), and my favorite, ship combat. Why couldn\'t ship combat be simply
an extension of basic combat? Why is that so horrible? The ship combat is
still an extension of the basic rules where bigger weapons increase to-hit
chance, but 10 lasers in a battery do the same damage as 1. When I got the
PHB (when it first came out), I thought `Thank God -- Real ship combat rules!\'
when I read the PHB, but noooooo! On a poor, industrial world, on a good
task roll (Man, do I hate the `strangely named four-point modifier\' system),
you can get cargo for free if TL is 10- and the starport is 8. Why get a 
disintegrator? Combat ranges! Ack!

OK, OK, sorry if I offended, but I always liked Traveller (2-D Universe and
all), and I was enthusiastic when MT was being first advertised, but I think
when I really get down to it, my opinion of it is roughly that of most people\'s
opinion of Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium. I have always considered
writing my own Traveller rules (with varying levels of success), but I think
that if I was going to play, I\'d rather use the Basic/Striker rules. If only
someone would simply extrapolate those for starships, I think it\'d be a far
superior system. Even Twilight2000-II is better (though the initiative rules
sucked big time). I guess I just wanted to vent my frustration somewhere.
Or more importantly, an I alone in this? I doubt I am, but I dunno...

So I didn\'t have my copy of Supplement 5 with me.  Currently it is
exactly 1014 miles from where I am sitting.  I think the fact that I was
able to remember the name of a Lightning Class Cruiser is still pretty good...

On the other hand, I said that the Allamu was reconstructed from salvage...
I didn\'t say how big the pieces were now did I?  Besides, all you\'d need is
a few intact chips from either ship for the TugBot to get infected with
the AI programming of the cruiser.  Bubble memory...  I seem to remember
a similar scenereo in Adventure 13:  Signal GK...

Now why is it I can remember junk like this and not important stuff!!

Ok, now I see where Bertil is coming from:  use a % of the ship\'s mass
in the equation E=Mc^2.

Right.  The ship has 1/200th the energy required to reach .1C.  I see your
point.  But your analysis of how an object accelerates is a bit off.
As the ship accelerates it burns off hydrogen:  This is negigible.
As the ship accelerates it encounters relativity:  This also is negligible
at .1C (@ .1C you only encounter a distortion of 0.5%)
	(@ .5C you only encounter a distortion of 13%)
So Basically we have an object under a constant acceleration 2G.
(Sorry guys but you can leave Einstein at home, this is strictly Newton\'s
turf.)
Now, Newton\'s second Law F=MA (no trouble here... mass stays approximately
constant, force stays constant, Acceleration should stay constant.)

after 18 days acceleration we hit .1C and see that KE=1/2*MV^2 and there you
are with the .1kton of TNT per gram kinetic energy figure I mentioned
that started this free for all.

Ooops!  Insufficent potential energy in the ship\'s fuel to reach that figure.
Well, If the ship has only 1/200 the energy then it can only reach 1/200
the kinetic energy of .1C.  Buy some quick envelope calculations, that
means that the ship can only accelerate at 2G\'s for 2.1213 days.  There is
no unknown deceleration force.  The ship doesn\'t run until it reaches
a certain speed and then have it\'s acceletation die off slowly,  It runs
until it\'s Kinetic energy equals it\'s potential energy and then
the engines thrust stops.  You are now going ballistic.

So, we come out with a new endurance for the scoutship:  2 days.
that is the point at which all it\'s potential energy will be used up.

If we accept that then scoutships will never get anywhere.

Ok, look.  We already know that traveller drives by definition (reactionless)
violate conservation of energy.  Any and all ships using what ever drive
you like (fusion flame, grav, thruster) that are designed in the trav
system will violate conservation of energy because they were written by
and designed by someone who never thought of this idea and never thought
anyone else ever would.  We have gone off the board.  Here there be Dragons.
But if we impose conservation of energy then all the trav engines will come
tumbling down like the house of cards they are.

You can\'t say "conservation of energy applies here, but not over there."
If conservation of energy holds at .1 C then it holds for lower speeds as
well.  so Dur=2.  In order for trav to work Dur should be more than that.

About flying blind... (ie insuffiecent time for collision avoidance @ .1C)
Well, as I said before... "Fred, you knew the job was dangerous when you
took it" - SuperChicken.  I think that while space is not exactly totally
clean, outside the eccliptic plane of the solar system you\'d have a better
chance.  On the other hand.  Space is Big.  You can\'t believe just how
mindbogglingly big it really is.  You may think it\'s a long way down to...

Sorry.  (Too much Douglas Adams)

Well sure there\'s a chance you won\'t make it to the target.  But imagine the
thrill of hitting .1c and getting that tite "Fastest Being alive"
heck even postumously it sounds COOL!  Put that on your tombstone.
(oops nothing left to interr...)  I know a few Vargr who would try it...

And if you are really nervous, that\'s what auto pilots are for.  Dig?

By the way, this really is metaphysics aien\'t it?  After all here we are
arguing about when we can and can\'t violate conservation of energy.

I am reminded of a line I once read and hated...
Changing the laws of physics is one of my hobbies.

I still hate it.

WRONG!  The Droyne use coyns.  The ancients didn\'t use them.  They are a
recent development, handed out to the Droyne by Grandfather long after
the ancients died out.

And what makes you so sure the Droyne are the ancients?  Who says so?
GDW?  Yeah, they also printed Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium!

Scott

Actually, I think it was a BIG mistake to say that the Droyne are the
ancients.  The explanation took all the mystery out of it.  Now when
players come accross an ancient artifact, they just say "Oh it\'s some
old Droyne stuff."

The introduction of the Primordials is an interesting idea to try to regain
the mystery.  But they gave an expalanation already, so there\'s no
mystery.  Besides, who cares about a bunch of dead heads who died of
boredom anyway!!!!

A while ago, I wrote a program to read the skill tables (in the format given
in the player\'s handbook) and produce some code that allowed skill lookups
including all of the "serves as" and "includes" stuff (while keeping the
skills separate of course).  I doing this I had to enter the skill table
and while doing so I made a few corrections ---- the biggest of which was
to make combat rifleman include the rifleman skill.  There were some other
typing errors present and some skills that were referenced but not defined,
the usual stuff that escaped proof-reading.  I\'ve included my table at the
end of this message, I hope it is of some use.  [ For the purist, the original
list was printed using Helvetica (italic?) at some unremember point size. ]
The programs are available if anybody really wants them, but the main parser
is written in Simula (which I doubt most people have).  The skill lookup
program is in C and should be portable.

You are not the only person dissatisfied with the current rules back last
December (November?  October?) several different groups were formed in
an attempt to reform the traveller rules without damaging the \'universe\'
too much.  It sort of died a silent death, I know that some work is being
done (very intermitantly).  Maybe it is time for a re-creation of the TDR
working groups.  Given the way things seem to work they won\'t stay around
very long, but some more progress might be made.

Hans, you are intitled to your opinions (ain\'t America Great?)  And in the
context of your entire message, I am in agreement to an extent.  It is a
problem with all game systems that I have seen.  Things always contadict each
other.  I however would like to argue this one point (which I don\'t agree).

The Gun Combat skill cascades into Hand Gun, SMG, Rifle, Auto Rifle (I think).
These are weapon firing skills that anyone can pick up (even today).  Combat
Rifleman on the other hand is strictly a military taught skill.  It includes
how to shoot a weapon, but also a lot more -- such as Sniper, Marksmanship,
how and when to Rock & roll.  Picking out enemy targets amongst friendlies,
etc.  Combat Rifleman should not be included in the Marksmenship only Gun
Combat cascade.

As far as availalbilty goes, It is the default skill for Army and Marines in
the Basic CharGen and comes up frequently in the Mercenary Advanced CharGen.
Other than that it is another example of inconsistancy :-)

Also Assault Rifle, ACR, and Gauss Rifle are all "Rifle" skills.

Just MY opinion!   ;-)

At first a big thanks to Jo Jaquinta and (or ?) the Devnaree Collective.
I have downloaded your Liblist.zip from 128.95.136.1 today. At the first
view, I like it. But I have some questions on it (I do not owe the World
Builders Guide, so please no flames on this ;-) ).

1. Are the World Temperatures in Centigrade or Fahrenheit. I believe in
   Centigrade, but I would like to be sure.

2. I have created worldmaps for different planets, and I wonder, why most
   of the planets, I have choosen, turn out to be Ice-Cappped. Especially
   I have created the Solar-System with the Program (no flame please, I
   know the names and Datas are generated Randomly) and Terra is placed
   at the orbit of a Gasgiant. So its Ice-capped to. I haven\'t got any
   planet, which surface is not Ice-capped with at least 25% Ice. A little
   bit strange for me! Can someone please tell me, if this is a result of
   random, or a well known phenomenon.

3. I wonder, if your program reads the complete data of a avialable Sector
   list. As I mentioned before, I have tried Terra in Solomani-Rim. I used
   the Solomani-Sektor, downloaded from 129.100.100.12 (Sunbane). The 
   description of Terra in this file, includes the extended Data "414"
   for Population Factor, #belts and #gasgiants. The sun is correctly
   identified as G2 V by your program (by the way, G2 5 is not the correct
   style of writing, the Astronomy uses the roman numbers to distinguish
   the sequences in the Hertzsprung-Russel-Diagram). But the program 
   generates only 3 Gasgiants and no Belt.                        

4. I have entered Subsector names in the table. Then I got problems, to
   find the Subsectors on the correct place. The choose Subsector map turns
   from 4*4 to 3*6. What\'s that ? (I think I should ask, because your
   Subsektor Grid cuts names, why not your choose Subsektor menu ?)

Don\'t bother about my comments. Your program is very usefull and easy to
use. I will try to find out, how I can send you the $15. It\'s not easy to
send money from Germany to the USA (I have no credit card yet).

That\'s for today,

In my games, there is \'accelerationless drive\', which really isn\'t. It

For reactionless drive, something like setting up a standing gravity

There\'s little, if any, chance that you will make it to the target.  There
might be a chance of hitting .1c before you hit a dust particle.

So now you intend to sacrifice (or at least, risk a very high probability of
sacrificing) a whole ship.  Even without worrying about a crew, that\'s a lot
more expensive than, say, a couple of nuclear missiles.

  If I\'m not totally mistaken, the Imperial Encyclopedia lists coyns as one type
of common artifacts in the entry on artifacts. I agree that it might seem hard 
to reconcile this with the "Coyns was introduced by Grandfather", and the fact
that some major races that hadn\'t appeared on the stellar stage appear on coyns.

  My suggestion for a solution of this is to assume that since Droyne lived on
worlds with ruins from the Ancients last war, some coyns might have happend to
end up in those ruins not long after the war, when Grandfather introduced them.

  Then we have the two-line comment in \'Secret of the Ancients\' that Grandfather
had ventured forth several times after the end of the war and destroyed 
ancient worlds where the destruction was not yet complete. I used this for an
adventure where the engima was that the Final War still goes on...

  In my current campaign(s) I keep the question open. When one of the players
said something like "Well, I *know* that they were Droyne because \'Secret of
the Ancients\' says so." I answered "If I could get away with the 6th Frontier
War (1114-1116) I\'m sure I can get away with making the Ancients human or vargr
or whatever:)"

  As for Artifacts, They are still hideously expensive and hideously 
unpredictable. And what PC would say \'well, just some old Droyne stuff\' when 
facing a Roth Thokken Vargr that\'s wearing two nano-tech level psionic
amplifyers that looks like two large diamonds in his empty eye-balls?

  (I refer to \'Vilani and Vargr\' for all talk about Roth Thokken and empty

  Well, I admit that half the reasoning behind my ardent push for fusion 
rockets only existed in my mind, but here it is:

  If we give the ships engines that require much larger amounts of energy, and
also give them plants that give much larger amounts of energy, we will start
getting scoutships all over relativity with the problems that cause. So the
solution would be something that would limit the maximum speed to manageable
levels and yet not inhibit acceleration.
  My proposed something is (non-reaction-less, isn\'t that a double negation?:)
reactive thrusters with a exhaust velocity of some nice figure, because that
velocity will (I think, what do any *real* physicists out there say) limit
the speed of the ships.

The following is a summary of a discussion between Scott S. Kellogg
and Robert S. Dean.

We have noticed that the agility calculations as presented in the
MegaTraveller Referee\'s Manual make little sense when compared
with the Starship Operator\'s Manual, High Guard, and for that matter,
the Referee\'s Manual.

Problem:  A ship has 2 G acceleration.  It has no additional power
for weapons, just power for engines, sensors, environment, computer
etc.  Excess power is zero.  Result:  Agility=0.  This is assuming,
of course, that the undefined term \'excess power\' refers to power
which is not allocated to any other operation aboard the ship apart
from increasing agility.  Ok, now when the ship is in emergency status,
the ship suddenly goes to agility=2.
Question:  Where did this "extra" power come from?

You see the problem? Is this what excess power really means? Is this the
result intended by the rules?

Ok, High Guard functioned like this:  A ship with power plant-2 and
maneuver drive-2 automatically becomes agility=2.  In order to have
a functioning maneuver drive, you had to have a power plant factor
equal to the maneuver drive thus a ship with the above plants will
always be agility=2 when not powering lasers (energy wpns etc). A
hit to the power plant reduces the agility of the ship by that amount.

Now, when a High Guard ship attempts to escape, the ship relies on
agility to do so, not maneuver drive.  So a 3-G ship with agility=3
can escape from a 6-G ship with agility=1.

Rationalization:  The 6G ship\'s power plant is being drained away
from the maneuver drive and it is not putting out 6-G\'s, it is putting
out only 1G.

In view of the MegaTrav design rules this does not translate unless
we do the following:

	(Power required for maneuver drive + "excess" power)
Agility=---- * 5.4
			Unloaded Weight

Agility may not exceed maneuver drive rating.
(No more agility=6 1-G drive ships...)
If you read the section of the Ref\'s Handbook, the rule there is a
little unclear.  I therefore think that the above clarification
(adding the power required by the drive to the equation as stated)
does make sense.

Note that if a ship is powering weapons the "excess" power can be negative
thus subtracting from the ship\'s ability to maneuver.  This is what Rob
refers to as "Double Dipping".

Please note that the above equation closely resembles Rob Dean\'s Thrust
based maneuver drive equations.

His opinion is that we should use the loaded weight for the above
calculations and I concur.  How often are ships flying around with
no fuel and no cargo?  He also suggests that the 5.4 in the above
be 10 as would occur in his thrust based maneuver drive calculations
(for grav based not thruster based vehicles).  That is, in a small
vehicle using standard grav propulsion, such as a 10 ton fighter, the
acceleration is the thrust divided by the loaded weight, and the
thrust is conveniently equivalent to the power input to the grav
units in MW multiplied by 10.

Thus Rob\'s equation:

	(Power req for maneuver drive + "excess" power)
Agility=---- * 10
			Loaded Weight

The above should be multiplied by 13/14 if using thruster plates as
opposed to grav plates. This will not only give you the agility, but
the true acceleration of the ship as given by the thrust based
maneuver arguments.

Note that when a ship is dipping into it\'s maneuver power it\'s
maneuver drive performance will be affected in the following manner:

		(Power req for maneuver drive + "excess"pwr)
Combat Maneuver=----* rated maneuver
			(Pwr req for manuever drive)

Note:  If "excess" power is positive, combat maneuver is not to exceed
rated manuever by more than 400% for more than 5 minutes without risk
of damage.  40% is acceptable for longer periods (days) if there is
suffient engineering skill among the engine crew.  These acceptable
overload factors are taken from the DGP Starship Operator\'s Manual.

Translation:  Algebra into English:
When a ship does not have power for all its weapons, it may divert
power from the maneuver drive.  Diverting power will reduce the
output of the drive.  It is possible to overload the engines, but
that may result in damaging them.  The time allowed for overloading
them for large increases in performance is considerably less one
starship combat round.

On a different note:

Aircraft Agility
In my opinion, aircraft agilities are far too low.

Consider:	A disp=40 6-G grav fighter: Agility=6, vs.
		F-14 Tomcat: Agility=6

In a turn, A Tomcat uses its wings and lifting surfaces to pull
a high G turn at approximately 9 G\'s

The Grav fighter (assuming it has wings) has 1/3 the wing area of a
jet fighter and is many many many times it\'s weight.  (In 101 vehicles
there is a Zho grav sled that weighs close to 180 tons, a displacement
of 2, and wings? It weighs close to what a B-52 does and is smaller
than a Cessna and they expect to get lift?)  It can get little if any
lift and must rely on it\'s grav units to turn it.  These as we said
before are only 6G\'s.

Result:  In a fast turning Dogfight the Tomcat can run rings around
the Grav fighter.  Of course the Tomcat has no inertial comps and so
the pilot takes a beating on the inside, but he will always be able
to get the advantage of the grav fighter.

Personal experience:
A Cessna 152 light utility trainer has a 110 horsepower Lycoming
engine, but it is rated for 4.4G\'s  No air/raft will be able to keep
up with it in a turn.  If you look at many of the designs in 101
vehicles, the Cessna might not be able to out run them, but it can
Really out turn them.  There are 5 designs in there that can out turn
the Cessna.  Two are civilian with +5 G MaxAcceleration, and there
are 3 military.  All are TL 13 or higher.

Conclusion:  I believe that aircraft agility should not be limited to 6,
but 9 (the physical limit of a pilot).  At TL 10, when inertial
compensators are used the agility could go even higher.

(This is assuming there is a pilot on board, George Herbert informs me
there are pilotless drones now flying around capable of making 15 G
turns)

as super mass drivers:

- - ----

By the way, I once did the calculations about how much energy it would
take to bring an object to 0.1 c and back.  I don\'t have the figures
handy, but I seem to remember that

o using completely efficient fusion drives, it would take 50% of the
  ship\'s mass to accelerate to 0.1 c, then another 50% to slow to a
  stop.  Thus, 75% of the ship\'s mass would have to be fuel in order to
  allow a ship to even travel at that speed, and that leaves no room
  for error.

o using completely efficient matter-to-energy conversion, the figure
  drops to something like 4% of the ships mass.

This is all irrelevant, however, since we have already agreed that
maneuver drives violate physics (disclaimer: as we currently understand
physics, that is).

- - ----

Let\'s get to the root of the problem, though:

o it takes a GREAT DEAL of energy to bring a ship up to those speeds.

o a heavy body traveling at these speeds would likely be able to
  seriously affect any planet it crashed into (perhaps even decimating
  the population).

o Traveller assumes that ships are routinely capable of accelerating to
  these speeds.

- - ----

Anyway, as long as we\'re redefining physics somewhat, why not keep
things simple?  In that light, here is my suggestion:

o Maneuver Drives do NOT generate enough energy to decimate a planet.

o Instead, they somehow reduce the ship\'s effective mass while
  propelling it through space.

o Now, if a ship moving quickly with its Maneuver Drive crashes into a
  planet, it will do so with a very small effective mass (possibly in
  the micrograms if the ship were moving REALLY fast).

o Now for the question, what happens if you accelerate to 0.1 c and
  then turn off the drives?  The choices I see:

    o The ship\'s mass immediately returns to normal, causing it to
      decelerate immediately down to a speed corresponding to its
      kinetic energy level.

  or:

    o The ship\'s mass slowly increases, causing the ship to drift back
      to a speed corresponding to its kinetic energy level.

  or:

    o The ship\'s mass stays at its current level until the ship is
      influenced by some other force (such as hitting another object).
      In this case, I would also suggest that gravity wells would tend
      to bring its mass back to normal.

  The option you choose depends on how you want ship movement to work.

o This creates all kinds of interesting speculation:
  o Ships under Maneuver Drive would be less affected by gravity.
  o Maneuver Drives really would be different from grav units.
  o Accelleration might have a better effect on turning the ship.
  o Maneuver Drives could also have limits to their "top speeds."
  o Ships moving under Maneuver Drive might always use energy.
  o There may be a justification for the 6G limit.
  o There may also be a justification for a volume-based system.
  o Maneuver drives might also require a small additional drive, but
    this is not necessary.
  o There might also be hybrid systems and/or reasons to NOT use a
    normal Maneuver Drive for certain circumstances.

I thought of this at lunch today.  It seemed so simple that I could
kick myself for not thinking of it earlier.

>From what I remember of High Guard, the calculation was made in a different
order.  Let\'s assume this is a 1000 ton ship, with USP power rating 2.  Its
power plant produces 0.01 * displacement * power plant rating = 20 Energy
Points.  From this, deduct the power used by ship\'s systems (weapons, computer
and screens).  The Energy Points left over go to the manoeuvre drives to supply
the ship\'s Agility as follows:
Agility = Remaining Energy Points / (Displacement * 0.01).

So, if the ship uses 20 EP on its systems, its agility is 0.  If it uses 10 EP
or less for ship\'s systems, its agility is 1.

For emergency agility, assume that ship\'s systems are turned off; the only
thing drawing power is the manoeuvre drive.  The "extra" power is the power
previously used by everything else.

Note that neither type of agility was allowed to exceed the ship\'s manoeuvre
drive rating; if it only had manoeuvre drive 1, its emergency agility would
be 1.

Only if it has no energy-consuming weapons, screens or computer (i.e.
only missile and sandcaster armament, computer Model 2 or less, no
screens except a black globe).

At least equal to the manoeuvre drive.  The power plant rating could be
greater than the manouvre drive rating, so you could use weapons, screens,
computer and manoeuvre drive.

Correct, unless the 6G ship uses its emergency agility of 6G (and has a large
enough power plant to supply its 6G manoeuvre drive).  (In which case, the
3G ship will probably turn round and fight, but that\'s not important to this
argument.)

I\'d substitute "Power available for manoeuvre drive" for the entire top line.
Power available for manoeuvre drive = output of power plant - power used by
other things.  This is presumably what the MT manual means by "excess power".
In fact, this is precisely what it means.  In my manual, it says "Excess power
output is the power left over from the power plant after all of the craft\'s
other components have been powered".  This is a big surprise - something in the
MT Referee\'s manual does make sense! :-)

> Agility may not exceed maneuver drive rating.
> (No more agility=6 1-G drive ships...)

Perhaps they should have stated that explicitly.  This was certainly the case
in High Guard.

Not by the above definition.  Excess power = power output - power used by
systems other than manoeuvre drive.  If this is negative, you need a bigger
power plant or smaller systems.  If it is zero, the ship\'s agility is zero.

> His opinion is that we should use the loaded weight for the above
> calculations and I concur.  How often are ships flying around with

I agree with this.  In High Guard, the ship\'s displacement included fuel, cargo
and waste space.  Waste space was any of the ship\'s tonnage which wasn\'t used
for something else, and only showed up if the designer didn\'t use it as cargo
space for some reason.

It didn\'t work here.  It looks like the message has a ^ followed by a L,

No problem.  The Ancients had coyns, but no coyns with new major races.  The

was struck by the similarities between Moties and Droyne.  Both are caste-based
societies, and most of the castes match, e.g. Droyne Leaders = Motie Masters,
Droyne Technicians = Motie Engineers.  Droyne don\'t have miniature Watchmakers
(that we\'ve seen), and their Drones don\'t have any Motie equivalent that I
recognised, though.  Still, it set me thinking about resolving the Riddle of
the Ancients in terms of Moties.  Anything is better than the official
explanation, so try this.

In their earlier times, the Droyne had the same problem as the Moties.  They had
to reproduce, or they would die.  This led to immense population problems, which
were solved to some extent when the Jump Drive was invented.  "Some extent"
means that it was only a matter of time before the worlds which were colonised
were also overcrowded.  Inevitably, interstellar war resulted, but not before
the Droyne had reached very high tech levels.  Some colonies were wiped out;
others were blasted back to a Stone Age equivalent.  Bases were left behind,
some intact, others ruined.  No two bases were ever the same, as no two Droyne
did the same thing the same way.

Civilisations rose and fell several times before one Droyne, the Yaskoydray of
legend, formed a new society in which the needs of society totally overrode
the wishes of individuals.  If an individual had to reproduce or die, and no
more children were needed by society, tough - the individual died.  The impact
was lessened to some extent by the discovery of a hormone-control drug which
counteracted the biological need to reproduce.  Yaskoydray tested this first on
himself, and when it appeared to be effective, issued it to his society.

Other societies were divided in their opinions of these developments.  Some
welcomed the apparent end to millenia of rises and falls, of creation followed
by destruction.  Others were reluctant to take the step into an entirely new
system.  There was one more, cataclysmic war.  Yaskoydray\'s side won, but it was
a Pyrrhic victory, as the few survivors were once more reduced to primitive
levels.  Most of the survivors were on only two worlds, Andory and Candory.  A
few isolated groups exist throughout space, but very small groups.

While the survivors of Andory and Candory were struggling to revive their
society, a new factor made itself felt.  Humanity was, for the first time,
also capable of jump travel.  The Imperials were the first to discover the
twin worlds.  Their archaeologists learnt a few fragments of the above history;
enough to regard the Droyne as a potential threat, but only potential.  There
was no reason to exterminate them, but they had to be watched in case they
expanded again.

In fact, there is no such threat.  The concept of the individual being totally
subordinate to society is still in force.  The hormone control drug was lost,
along with much of the Ancients\' technology, but the rigid society attitude,
backed up by quasi-religious rituals such as those of the coyns, keep the
population in check.  An individual lives just as long as it is needed by
society, then it dies.  A few choose not to die, but they soon run into the
old problem.  They have to breed, or they become listless and unhappy, and
eventually die anyway.  But so long has it been since anyone bred for that
reason, that none know the cause of their unhappiness; and besides, none but
perhaps another one of these "deathless ones" will have anything to do with
them.

There is a legend which persists, that Yaskoydray is alive and well, and visits
the Droyne occasionally.  The presence of coyns which cannot be otherwise
explained lends some credence.  In truth, although none but Yaskoydray himself
know it, when he first tried the hormone control drug on himself, he overdosed.
But as the need to reproduce or die was nature\'s way of trying to keep Droyne
from living too long, and as he has overcome that need, he is in effect
immortal.  Which does not make him very happy; even Ancients can get tired of
life when they\'ve seen everything.  Yaskoydray has seen more, and knows more,
than the sum total of the experience of all the human subspecies put together.
He\'s also slightly cowardly.  He won\'t commit suicide, or take actions which
threaten him.  Thus he is tired of life, but afraid to die.

Well, there you have it.  Yet another Theory of the Ancients.  Any comments?
One quick side note, as this is inspired by "The Mote in God\'s Eye"; there
is a star called "The Eye Of God", or more correctly, "L\'Oeuil d\'Dieu".  (That
high school French had some use, after all! :-)  What a pity this star is on
the wrong side of the Spinward Marches.

    'body' => 'Last night I helped some students with a neat physics problem:
calculate the work done by glaciers in excavating Lake Superior
(avg depth 31 meters, area 1.46X10^5 km^2)  We then converted the energy
(work) into various units:  including 20 megaton h-bombs.  Result:
it takes twenty 20megaton bombs to dig that crater (assuming 100% efficency)
Crater: 31m deep, 216km in radius

Now the good ol` 1Kl of lead @ .1C has 1.3 gigatons of yield:
Crater 31m deep, 389 km in radius.  (quite a shovel eh?)  More that
as Adrian put it \'a couple of nuclear missiles\' (65 20-megaton bombs)

Also, If you did your accelerating out of the eccliptic plane by a
few AU or so, chances are pretty decent for making your run without
hitting something.  If you are in interstellar space say a few hundred AU
chances ought to be excellent.  And I agree with Bertil when he say\'s
for every task there\'s a vargr insane enough to try it...

But:  on to reaction drives:  If I have an spacecraft with a fusion rocket
that weighs 195 tons.  The thrust is 1911 neutons (195 metric tons Kg force)
{{I hate Kg force}}  the acceletation is 1 G or 9.8 meters per sec.

The equation as I said before is pure Newton:  F=ma,  The equation will hold
at velocity=0 at velocity=1000kph, and at velocity =.1c.  Sorry,
exhaust velocity has NO effect on the final speed of the rocket.

As to physics nullifiers....  (I don\'t like em!)  The traveller interplanetary
travel funtions as though acceleration is constant.  Thus there is no top
speed limit there to be found.  However, in normal interplanetary travel, you
wouldn\'t want to go riproaring along for the problem Adrian pointed out, that
the eccliptic plane is too full of junk to move around at .1c.

If we say that maneuver drive decreases the mass of the ship allowing
a ship to have a smaller inertia to push around (ala Larry Niven\'s \'Gil the
arm\' murder weapon/inertia reducer/physics nullifier (tm))  Well, the instant
you shut down power to it your mass would return to normal and your velocity
would reduce down along with your KE.  This would make decelleration
instantaneous.  This does not go with any traveller rules I\'ve ever seen.
As far as I know trav ships function like ordinary rockets in this regard.

I don\'t like physics nullifiers, I don\'t use em unless I have to...
Jump drive and anti-grav.

As to the problem of KE being greater than PE of ship...
Well, if the engines are supposed to be able to run for 30 days...  You have
to calculate the final velocity of the ship at the end of 30 days of acceletating, figure out the KE and that Must equal the 
PE.  If we accept KE, then we
must accept the consequences of PE. (ie reduced endurace to 2 days)  if we
accept PE then we must accept the KE (velocity >.1c is attainable)

If this ever came up in a campaign I was running, I would make the players
do all the calculations.  Play up the risks (as Adrian put them), and if
that didn\'t dissuade them, and they rolled well enough, I would reluctantly
have to destroy a planet.  It would not be long before, The Imperial Navy
combined with the Zhodani, Navy, the Sword Worlds, the Darrians, Collace,
and every single other ship in the entire galaxy was after them.

And frankly, as I would be the ref, it wouldn\'t take long to catch them.

I imagine the courts would be hard pressed to find deaths painful enough
as penalty for torching a planet like that....

PS Haven\'t we run this one into the ground?  Take a look at the agility
calculations Rob and I worked on...  Let\'s move on to something new...

    'body' => 'Rob Dean writes of vehicle computers being used in combat.

I have always been under the impression that a model one computer adds
an additional +1 on the to hit task for various vehicles.  I dislike this
as the computer is large enough and expensive enough to add more accuracy
than that.  So, I would say that in tank to tank combat, one would use
the difference in computers as a bonus to hit.  (like starship combat)

But against a target that either does not have a computer, or has one
but is not aware of it\'s adversary (ie not evading) the computer should
give additional bonuses to hit {More than just the computer model number}

As to range/speed modifiers...  If the tanks are performing above NOE
then I would treat it as air combat (COACC may have design problems, but
the air to air combat seems pretty good

)  Use the MaxAcceleration of the
tank as it\'s agility.

Actually, I see grav tank vs grav tank not as an extention of modern
tank vs. tank, but an extention of modern helicopter vs helicopter
combat.  (ie hiding, unmasking sensor pods, pop ups, etc.)  So again, I
would use air to air.

But on the ground the rules Rob mentioned seem pretty good.  In NOE tanks
ought to be very hard to hit if you are on level with them.

Gunnery computers:  I thought about this a while ago:  It seems to me that
a +1 to dice rolls seems pretty paltry for something as expensive and large
as a model 1 computer.  Therefore what I considered was installing a
robot cpu with program for vehicle control or gunnery.  All it does is add
a little edge (I originally talked about vehicle control but it could be
extended to gunnery).

This gunnery computer would be linked to sensors (radar/ladar/EMS/Environ)
to take into account the movement of the target and the wind speed for
MD or chemically propelled rounds.  This seems more like the M-1 gunnery
computer than the model one starship computer.

Just rambling...

In _Starship_Operator\'s_Manual_, there is an extended description of the
gyroscopic system used to control a ship\'s heading.  It seems that everyone
has been assuming the extra power used for agility goes to the thruster plates.
Perhaps it goes to this gyroscopic system.  Agility, then, would be properly
a measure of a ship\'s ability to change heading, rather than direction.

If this is the case, then, I suppose, changing direction of movement, for the
purposes of navigation, would only be a matter of thrusters; agility would be
irrelevant.  Agility would become important in combat, however, in aiming
spinal mount weapons, and in making extremely rapid direction changes, as in
dodging missiles.

But I\'m no physicist, so, having suggested this, I\'ll leave it to those of you
who are.

I too am interested in the current happenings within this area of the
Marches. 

In addition I am interested as to how this area faired during and after the
Fifth Frontier War.  I am particularly interested in how the Border Worlds
came to be formed, the economic (depression?) and political (unrest?
tension?) situation in this region.  Another area that I would like to hear
more about is the Federation of Arden.

This is my first post, having joined TML late last week.  I have been
enjoying the discussion.  Please forgive me if I\'ve missed an obivious
archive somewhere.

Here\'s some information that may be of interest to all.

VEHICLE DESIGNS: there are now vehicle designs aplenty available from
metolius and sunbane.  I culled out all the designs sent through the TML
and created 24 "packages" containing them.  Look for these as "VD1"
through "VD24".

PBEM TURNS: turn 10.10 and it\'s admin message have been added to the
archives on metolius and sunbane.  Look for it as "PB15".

MS-DOS FLOPPIES: have just been brought up-to-date with the latest
bundles and packages.  There are now twenty two 720kB, 3.5" MS-DOS
diskettes, which echo the metolius TML archive site contents.  Look for
this information on sunbane as "MSDOS.txt"

README: sunbane\'s new top-level README, and TOC, is now up-to-date.

ARCHIVE INFORMATION: now lists all the known TML ftp sites and hints at
what\'s there.  The information follows this TML message.

There are several different sites archiving Traveller Mailing
List-related materials.  The primary archive sites are called \'sunbane\'
and \'metolius\', and there are special-interest archive sites at \'ocf\',
\'naucse\', \'potemkin\', \'ucr\', and \'milton\'.

There are different ways to request archive information, depending on
the site you get the archives from.  \'ftp\' indicates anonyomous ftp
online file transfer, available for anyone directly connected to the
internet.  \'email\' indicates reponse and data via email.  \'disk\'
indicates 3.5" 720kB MSDOS floppies delivered by the postal service.

Also depending on the site, there are different materials available.
\'Buns\' indicates the TML message traffic, about 10 megabytes in size.
\'Pkgs\' indicates "Packages" of collected information, primarily culled
from TML archive messages: errata, software, official sector data, and
vehicle designs.  \'Soft\' indicates additional gaming aid software,
beyond that available in the Packages.  \'Vehi\' indicates vehicle
designs, beyond that available in the Packages.  \'Prose\' indicates some
documentation for an alternate history for Traveller.

SUNBANE FTP ARCHIVE SITE

All the TML traffic (Bundles) and Packages, and some additional software
and postscript deck plans, are available via ftp from sunbane, See the
sample ftp session below if you don\'t know how to use ftp.

The files README and TOC provide a brief/detailed summary of the
contents of the archive.

The site is managed solely by the FTP Site Coordinator: dan@engrg.uwo.ca
(Dan Corrin).  The University of Western Ontario is not responsible for
the materials and opinions stored in the archives.

METOLIUS EMAIL AND DISKETTE ARCHIVE SITE

All the TML traffic (Bundles) and Packages are available via email or
MSDOS diskette from the Traveller Mailing List Administrator,
traveller-request@metolius.wr.tek.com.  I do this as time becomes
available, every other week or so, so sunbane is usually the fastest way
of getting information, not metolius.  Sunbane is also better connected
for sending lots of megabytes out across the networks.  If you still
want or need to use the metolius archive service, I will gladly send you
a detailed Bundle Table-of-Contents so you can pick and choose which
Bundles look interesting.

Excuse me, but you can not use gyros, to change the movement vector of a
ship. The only thing you can do, is to turn the ship around is gyros. You
can handle the gyros a fixpoint, around which the mass of the ship can be
turned. After the turn, the ship can use its thruster plates, to change
his movement vector. The advantage of the gyros, is the possibility to turn
the ship, without changing its movement vector. But the agility is 
nevertheless dependent on the maneuver drives, because only this drives
can change the ships movement vector. And only the change of the movement
vector is necessary, to dodge attacks (i.e. take a Ship with a hull
configuration of 5 (ball). It can turn around its gyros, to change the
direction in which the maneuver drive shows, but it will not shorten its 
profile against attacks. It must use its maneuver drive, to dodge incomming
attacks).

On purpose of navigation, its much better to use the gyros. You can manipulate
them much more exact. And, using  the description in the Ship\'s Operator
Manual, the gyros have enough mass, to turn a ship in fractions of a second.
The more mass, and the more rounds per second a gyro has, the faster you
can turn the ships mass. Small thrusters for changing the ships heading
are slower and even not as precise (think of the fact: every use of a thruster
to turn a ship left, needs a use of a thruster to stop this turn).
In so far you are right to say, gyros have affects on agility, but the
maneuver drive is much more important.

At last a big disadvantage og gyroscopes :
They are big masses, which rotate on thousands of rounds per second. If
a gyro ever leaves its location, it will destroy the ship in quaters
of seconds. (Hey Scott Kellog, it could be a work for, to calculate
the energy which would be freed ? ;-))

agility equation

"Power Required for maneuver drive": this is the amount of power which is
normally drawn by the manuever drive
(I don\'t have my books with me but I think it is (per ton of drive)
65MW for anti-grav drive
70MW for Thruster plate drive  (this is for every 13.5 KL of drive)

"Excess Power": Is the amount of power left over after all systems have
been powered (Sensors, Weapons, Drives, Environ, Comm, etc. etc.)

The "Excess Power" can be negative.  The Weapons may draw more power
than is available after all systems have been powered.  In this case
the power is being diverted from the maneuver drive to the weapons
enabling them to fire.  This will have an adverse effect on maneuver/agility.
(note that the weapons may not draw more power than the total output
of the power plant)

Thus the equation:

		(Power req for maneuver drive + "excess" Power)
Agility=	----*10
			Loaded Weight

Your are, of course, correct, but I didn\'t want to make the explanation

While I agree with you, of course, it is not so obvious as you think it is, at
least to several other eminent members of this group with whom I have had this
discussion.  As a result, I thought it best to spell it out.

Ah! But they didn\'t, because they didn\'t intend for it to be the same.  That\'s
why we\'ve got Joe Fugate explaining that the agility rating is your ability
to \'alter your heading\' for pity\'s sake, rather than the ability to alter
your maneuver vector.  Since you can rotate all you want (with three degrees
of freedom, no less) and still end up presenting a \'ballistic\' rather than
a maneuvering target, I reject this view utterly.

I use this terminology to make it explicit that I mean exactly what High
Guard meant, as opposed to certain folks around here (-8, who feel that
the power used _by the drive_ should be included, leaving excess power as
anything over and above that normally used by the drive (overloading!).


The whole question of "What is agility?" is tied in pretty closely with the
question of whether or not the combat system is rational as it now stands
(give or take a little).  If we view ships as \'hard to hit\', then it would
make sense to spray your weapons all over their potential positions, which
is why a 30 laser battery does the same damage as a 1 laser battery, if
both manage to hit.  Now, if ships are spraying automatic weapons fire (-8
all over, then to be hard to hit, you obviously must need to make a substantive
change in your projected position, which means using the maneuver drive
to accelerate rather than just \'dodging\' a little bit in place.  Does that make
any sense to anyone?

	This is probably whistling in the dark, but I have some questions for
anyone who has actually used the MT starship combat rules, or someone
with a recent printing of them (if the bugs were fixed).

	I\'ve applied the erratta changes to combat tables, but have a few
questions about the Explanation of Damage Results.
	One: do the \'crew sections\' rules work, and if so, why? 8-) (they don\'t
make any sense to me, esp. in terms of damage)
	Two: For damage to Power Plant, the rules say \'reduce UCP factor\',
obviously a direct copy from High Guard.  Unfortunately, the craft design
rules no longer _use_ the UCP for powerplant rating or design.  How do you
handle PP damage?

[you may assume that the hypercard ship combat program will be a bit delayed.
as much as I hate the concept of vaporware, there are some critical problems
with the rules that I need to resolve before I start coding again... sorry]

Hi, gang. After many delays, a spare evening here in lovely Atomic City,
Oak Ridge, Tennesee... (amusing story: I\'m standing in line to get lunch,
the first day, and there\'s this young guy in front of me, about my age.
He turns to make polite conversation, and suddenly reads my name tag again,
getting this weird grin on his face. "Michael Metlay?" he asks me. "Where?"
I says, looking behind me. That widens the grin a bit, but then HE sez:
"Traveller Mailing List?" You could have knocked me over with a feather!
Turns out that TML Digest-reader Martin Jarrio from Georgia Tech is here
attending this workshop/conference in Oak Ridge too! You meet TMLers in 
the WEIRDEST places, man....)

Anyway, here\'s a little something I\'ve promised folx for a long while. Since
my alternatives to writing this stuff are watching TV or putting even MORE
hours in the day into my dissertation, I figured I\'d get it out of the way.
Don\'t be surprised at the length of the intro-- it contains a lot of stuff
that was NOT in the first four stories. I\'d like to give credit to W. Dow
Rieder (Grant) and Alex Wilce (Fell) on the TML, and David Turner (Jaeger),
Boris Bartlog (Kherkhoulloth), Paul Reilly (O\'Connor) and Rob Packard 
(Sanchez) off it, whose actual gaming sessions from 1989 to 1991 provided all 
of what you\'re about to read. I redid the dialogue because my memory isn\'t
that good, but the rest is mostly as it happened. When my thesis is out of

SYNOPSIS AND CHARACTER INFORMATION

The Suleiman Cluster is a grouping of a dozen or so worlds within a mutual 
Jump-1 of one another in the coreward section of the Solomani Rim. One of
the most recent arrivals onto the shipping scene in this bustling little
stellar village of industry and agriculture is the fledgling line of 
Hortense, Luttner, and Grant; for the past ten years or so, this scrappy and 
inventive shipping line has managed to accrue a good two dozen ships of 
varying sizes and solidify its place in the Suleiman shipping business. Its
founders are William Hortense, Rachel Luttner, and Khagariilian Grant, three
Free Traders who pooled their resources (Hortense\'s administrative savvy,
Luttner\'s technical expertise, and Grant\'s brokerage/trading genius) to build 
their struggling concerns into one strong company. This move took the 
established fleets in the area by surprise, and the competition has been hot 
and heavy ever since. They include, for future reference, Rekuta (the local
Tukera affiliate), Whitestar/Concord (the local branch of WhiteStar Lines, 
the Solomani Rim\'s biggest non-megacorporate sector line) and Belvane
TransTech, a fiercely competitive interface line run by the inimitable
Myra Belvane (you need a description? Put Joan Collins in a vacc suit. A
TIGHT vacc suit.), whose fiery passion for Bill Hortense was often at odds
with their economic thrust and parry.

About 2 years ago (1117, the beginning of the Solomani push into the Rim),
Captain Grant sold his share of the company back to Hortense and Luttner and
went on the market to purchase a Far Trader. Grant was tired of the grind of
business management, and longed to hit the road again. On the war-torn and
mysterious planet Easter, Grant assembled as unlikely a crew as the Rim had
ever seen, as he followed a tip by a young StarPort authority secretary that
there was more to one of the ships in mothballs than met the eye....

For technical support, Grant chose Wu-Shun Sanchez, a fanatical tinkerer
whose soft-spoken optimism was often mistaken for an advanced coma. His 
career had been rapid and unswerving in its progress--downward. From a 
promising start as a corporate trainee in Tukera, Sanchez was busted down
to WhiteStar, the Solomani Rim\'s main sector-wide line, then to the
subsector subsidiary WhiteStar/Concord, then to an interface line, and
finally to HL&G, where his easygoing attitude finally found him a home.
Grant, not much of a yeller himself, found Sanchez a pleasant alternative
to the whiskey-swilling imbeciles who learned engineering etiquette from
James Doohan, and took the tech with him to aid in his selection of a ship.

Security went to Daryavayush O\'Connor, a downpowered cyborg warrior
from FSO, the little-publicized and much-feared Free Space Operations
branch of the Imperial Navy. The FSO specializes in operations similar to 
those performed by the Marine Commandos, but are renowned for taking on
missions the Commandos consider too dangerous with equipment they consider
substandard. Everyone, but EVERYONE, in the Imperial military machine 
considers the FSO to be dangerously loose cannons, and with good reason--
they are actively recruited into IRIS upon retirement, if they live that 
long. (Interestingly enough, I predicted IRIS by about six years when I
created the FSO and their parent organization, the Shadow Fleet, in 1979--
but GDW informed me that a secret organization of this nature wouldn\'t
fly. Harrumph.) O\'Connor was a native of Iddamakur, the primitive and vicious 
archipelago once used by the Solomani as a prison camp world. His eye, arms,
throat, and part of his brain were replaced by artificial implants as he
recovered from various war traumas. He was, in a sense, the perfect security
system. 

No one knows where Grant found Kherkhoulloth, the Vargr navigator. Kherk was
a deassigned Imperial Scout, stranded far from the Antares Sector where he
was born. He\'d travelled the xboat routes for decades, and had been just 
about everywhere coreward of Capital. Now, he was the ultimate Vargr specimen
- - --scrawny, unwashed, cowardly to a fault, and a recreational drug-user whose
exploits were legendary in their monumental stupidity. But he had one fetish
that outwieghed all others: he was stonecold sober when he plotted courses, 
and could do a Jump-5 from inside an asteroid belt in under three minutes and
miss his target by less than a kilometer every time. Grant hired him.

During the search for a suitable used ship in the Easter shipyards, Grant and 
his team became embroiled in a battle to set up a new xboat route from 
Estigaribbia to Suleiman via Easter, in case the encroaching Solomani broke
the existing routes to the Vegan district. HL&G, attempting to expand its 
influence by tying in an Imperial subcontract for xboat service to the new 
route, was struggling with WhiteStar/Concord and with Myra Belvane\'s, erm,
PROMISING young niece Tiffany, who were attempting to secure the contract for
themselves. HL&G supported the claims put forth by the nation of Alepfa that
occupied one half of Easter, and the other firms were doing the same for
Zuma, the other half of the planet. The two nations existed on opposite sides
of the thick atmosphere barrier at the planet\'s equator, and each had its own
starport at its own pole, above the atmosphere in vacuum. There had been
peace for uneasy centuries, but the situation over the lucrative Imperial
contract and the commercial openings it would encourage was raising tensions
to the boiling point. 

Grant solved the problem in spectacular fashion, exposing a plot by 
WhiteStar/Concord to bribe the Zuman government to start a war over the port. 
He was aided in this by a mysterious stranger named M. Iscin Delano Jaeger,
a man who seemed part George Lucas, part Donald Trump. Jaeger, it turned
out, was the first human in history to be officially admitted to the Hiver
Manipulators\' Club. His Manipulation, fully documented and on file on Guaran, 
was the war currently in progress on Okefenokee, which he\'d started several
years earlier for the filming opportunities it would lend him. Jaeger was
an ex-supervisor at Makhidkarun, a topnotch diplomat, and an expert at
propaganda films and popular culture control, who viewed the chaos in the
Rim as the ultimate laboratory for sheer mayhem. He chose Grant\'s new ship
as his favored means of getting away from his projects as they exploded.

The team purchased a bizarre ship impounded from a group of pirates who\'d 
been captured or killed while shoreside. The Serendipity, as they named her, 
had any number of bad associations with various people around the Rim, and
Grant\'s company was hounded across the sector by them, until the Serendipity
was impounded by the authorities as stolen goods on the feudal-technocratic
world of Upirzanu, where it had originally been built by Langmuir, personal 
shipwright of Lord Cendryk, the strongest ArcoLord of the world. Along the way,
the Serendipity\'s crew discovered a floating hulk in space with more than
its share of secrets, stopped a religious war on Vega, and bounced their
ship off a mountain on Ymir (as documented in the first couple of stories).

Their new ship contract was for the Torch, a ship designed as a prototype
for the spoiled oldest son of Lord Corris, Cendryk\'s greatest rival. The 
Torch was an innocent-looking merchant ship with INCREDIBLE Jump legs; it
could jump the Great Rift unaided, with minimal preparation. (Can you say 
"three Jump-5s without refueling"? Knew you could.) While the Torch gave 
Grant a big edge in the small-package trade, it brought a serious new problem
with it: its payment schedule was backbreaking. Between that and the few
loose ends left from the Serendipity\'s record, Grant was desperate for the
spare cash he\'d need for overhauls. 

One of the most interesting loose ends of the Serendipity\'s run was Hector, 
the ship\'s computer. Technically he was just a Model/7 (just?!), but in fact 
he was much, MUCH more than that-- he was a living being. Not a sentient
computer or a synaptic robot-- a living being. As the crew discovered, the
initial discovery of sentient silicon life on the planet Cymbeline was being
exploited in secret by a private firm developing a new generation of 
computers for the Navy. The firm, CymBiotica, was now desperately trying to 
hide all evidence of its research from the occupying Solomani-- including the
third generation of CymBiots, the "grandchildren" of the now-famous sentient
chip 10987 (see Adventure 13, "Signal GK") that resembled their grnadfather 
about as much as a Cray resembled an abacus. Needless to say, Hector was a
big boon to anyone who had him as an employee-- and EVERYONE wanted him.
The only other chip of that type on the loose, nicknamed Marilyn, was being 
transported by a courier who didn\'t know what he was carrying and who hitched 
a ride on the Torch to evade his pursuers. Although Marilyn went insane and
had to be destroyed, the courier ended up joining the crew. He had several
different identities, and switched from one to the next effortlessly; most of 
the time, he preferred to be known as Dr. Christoph Fell, architectural 
expert and ex-IISS bureaucrat. His other alter egos included the slimy 
tabloid reporter Clovis Cruikshank and Terran private detective Tibor Trench,
not to mention a dozen others....

Driven by encroaching Solomani fleets to seek shelter in the Vegan Autonomous
District, Grant and his tired, careworn crew were approached by a man calling
himself J.J.Cameron, an executive for Ling-Standard Products. Cameron had a
fascinating proposition for Grant: he had learned of a new formulation of 
Dag, a material used in electronics design, that had been developed on Terra
and was now being hidden from the Solomani there. Grant and his team would be 
surgically altered and personality-overlaid into a completely new group of
people, and sent to Terra to recover the formula, or better yet, a sample of
the new Dag. If they succeeded, Cameron promised, he would pay off the lien
on the Torch.

Grant agreed. The process of transformation took months, but when it was 
done, the Torch was hidden in deep space, and a battered old Far Trader,
the IMSS Inexplicable, was doing the smuggler\'s route along the Rim. Its
captain, James Hudson, had no memory of his previous life, only a personal
secretary-bot that seemed awfully smart for just junk. Accompanied by his
ragtag crew of smugglers, Hudson headed for Terra and a quick buck. Behind
him in the Suleiman cluster, a company he didn\'t know or care about was
dying in the throes of a tradewar, its CEO nearly killed in a terrorist 
bombing and its VP scrambling for her life....

PART 5

Terra, in the Solomani Rim: 1119

	"There it is again."
	Tsogukh stopped and looked at the poster, now beginning to peel
off the wall. He frowned and scratched his head, squinting at the faces
before him, reading the caption for the dozenth time.

			HAVE YOU SEEN THESE MEN?

	Hortense, Luttner and Grant, LIC, will pay a reward of ten
	thousand Imperial Credits to the locator of the crew of the
	IMSS Torch, lost 102-1119 in the Vegan Autonomous District....

	Hudson looked past the huge Vargr\'s shoulder at the picture
of the man called Khagariilian Grant. Edison just stood there and blinked.
Tchorgin picked at a tooth delicately, trying to hide his boredom. Nyborg
scowled and began scratching the back of his hand again; he claimed it
still itched after the accident on Muan Gwi, oh, months ago. Newton stroked
his beard thoughtfully, his eyes troubled.
	After a long pause, Hudson turned to the others, anger fighting with 
fear on his face. "What IS it about this damn thing...?"

	"Have a seat, Mister Hudson."
	Hudson staggered across the room, propelled roughly by a shove from
the guard, and flopped into the chair. He summoned up the strength for a 
scowl at the pudgy, moon-faced man across the desk from him, and rasped, "What 
the hell gives you the right to do this to us? We\'re clean! We aren\'t...."
	"Save it, Captain. I\'m not interested." The man\'s smile flickered for 
a moment, and he cocked an eyebrow at the door. The guard quietly withdrew,
taking the hint. The door shut with a click. 
	Hudson surveyed the room. It was obviously bugproofed and 
soundproofed; the man facing him was obese, his chins bulging out over the 
collar of the expensive business suit, grey and black except for a spot of 
color at the lapel. Hudson tried to focus on it, but his eyes weren\'t 
cooperating....
	"Cigarette?" A neatly-slit packet was waved before Hudson. He frowned 
at it, suddenly unsure. I don\'t smoke, he thought. Do I?
	"I...don\'t smoke."
	"You used to smoke like a chimney, old friend," was the startling 
reply. "Sure you won\'t change your mind?"
	Hudson shrugged and took a cigarette from the pack. The man across 
the desk lit it for him; he took a deep lungful of the smoke, held it, 
exhaled. Suddenly he saw the cold pig-black eyes regarding him carefully, 
and forced himself to cough, gasp for breath. "Foul habit," he managed.
	"Give it up, John. You\'re not fooling anyone."
	Hudson tried to poke a hole in the dark stare with his own eyes.
	John?
	"John?"
	"John." The oily voice held satisfaction. "Shall I spell it out for 
you, or would you like to do that yourself and save me the trouble?"
	"I have no idea what you\'re talking about," Hudson managed, the
cigarette forgotten between his fingers and scorching the arm of the chair.
"My name\'s Jim, not John. James Hudson. I\'m a chartered merchant on a run
from Ys to--"
	"To Hell, John. Straight to Hell." Meaty hands slapped the desktop
as the mountain of flesh scrambled upright. "\'Down, down to Hell; and say
I sent thee thither.\' Shakespeare." A horrible smile creased the fat face.
"I don\'t know why you picked here and now to show up again, and how you chose 
that gang of freaks you call an ops team, but I am NOT going to let an 
opportunity like this pass me by." 
	"What opportunity? What are you talking about----Sonderberg?" Hudson\'s
mouth closed with a snap. Who?
	"Ah, so you DO remember me," the fat man nodded. "Excellent. It\'ll 
make killing you so much more pleasurable. It\'s ALREADY practical beyond 
belief, but now at least I can enjoy it."
	"Look, I DON\'T remember you! I have NO IDEA who you are! That name
just, well, I don\'t know, just kind of popped into my head!" Hudson felt the
sweat trickle down his temple and across the stubble on his cheek. Something 
was very, VERY wrong....
	"Of course it did," Sonderberg soothed. "Of COURSE it did. Your 
overlay was a pretty shoddy one, John-- just like the others\'. You must have 
really scraped the bottom of the barrel when you did your recruiting! It\'s
sort of a pity you\'re all going to have to vanish together-- it would be
interesting to see what sorts of songs Chandra and Shevek could sing. But
where, where, WHERE did you dig up RICE, for God\'s sake? Or that Corris
brat? And the VARGR-- you couldn\'t even get one with his BRAIN INTACT?!"
	Hudson\'s mind was whirling. Shevek? Rice? Who was-- what was--
what was that about the brain? Intact? But he was OFF drugs, Tsogukh never
DID drugs-- WHO was off drugs? And Corris--where\'d he hear THAT before--
Corris, the Lord, the Keeper of the Flame--of the Flame--of the....
	Torch?
	Hudson\'s mouth worked like a fish\'s, but no sound came out. His eyes 
began to glaze over.
	Sonderberg scowled. "Hmm, the overlay must be stubborn. Normally when 
they crack, they peel right up. Okay, fine," he sighed, walking around the 
desk and facing Hudson, who shrank back in his chair at the big man\'s 
approach. "Let me help you along, then." He poked a surprisingly strong 
finger into Hudson\'s chest. "Your real name is John Becker. JOHN BECKER!"
That last was a cry of triumph. "And you are about to suffer a fatal 
accident, trying to escape from me-- and my job, YOUR JOB, will be as 
permanent as anything ever gets in this floating world we live in...."
	Hudson wasn\'t hearing him any more. His terrified gaze was locked
on the huge man\'s lapel pin, a blood-red circle-and-cross-
	JOHN BECKER. SOLOMANI SECURITY. IDENT CODE ASB8-93OJ-HGN4...4....
	My God, Grant thought in a panic. HOW MANY OF ME *ARE* THERE?!
	He fainted dead away.

Well, I\'ll admit that they don\'t make much sense to me either--you realize that
your ship basically gets one crew hit point for each thousand tons of hull
displacement.  The actual number of crewmen per thousand tons of hull is
irrelevant.  This is a little more intuitive to me than the old High Guard
\'exponential\' crew factor, where each crew hit wiped out 90% of the remaining
crew.  Ships dead of crew radiation overdose were not uncommon in High Guard
combat.

You don\'t have both sets of official errata?  In the second one (I think) is
the part that says that you lose 10% of the \'disabled\' damage point value
of the power plant for each hit, with a minimum of two points...so a plant
with a value of 4/8 would be disabled by 2 hits and destroyed by 4 more, but
a plant with a value of 600/1200 would be disabled by ten hits, and destroyed
by twenty more.

Personally, for both of these I would like to see things replaced by absolute
rather than relative damages.  (i.e. Crew-1 kills 10 people, if you\'ve got lots
you\'re OK, and Power-1 does 4 points of damage, so the first example ship above
is scrod if hit.)  For that matter, I\'d change things as they are now to say
that a Weapons-1 hit destroys a turret rather than a battery...with dynamically
reconfigurable controls, how can one hit wipe out ten turrets on a large ship,
or just knock out one weapon in a triple beam,sand and missile turret on a
small ship?

I can tell by your questions that you haven\'t looked at critical hits yet?
What is a bridge hit in the new game, and how do I designate the fact that
my ship has an auxiliary bridge?  Why should a computer system in triplicate
for redundant safety have all installations co-located so that a single
computer critical hit wipes out _all_ computer installations?  I think there
are a couple more of these, but I haven\'t got my rules with me today.

  I suspect that they are a way of representing the \'density\' of the crew.
A ship with a high density of crew will loose more crew from each hit simply
because more crew is \'in harms way\'.

  As for the effects of lost crew, the first effect IMHO should be large 
penalties for damage control (wich don\'t really appear in MegaT so how could
it be penalized:(. This also highlights a related problem with the way MegaT
handles crew and similar things.
  MegaT seems to assume that all members of the crew has their own little 
console with a cozy acceleration couch somewhere in the ship. I believe that we
should factor in watches (each person works only 8 hours per day) and damage
control crew (those \'off duty\') in this. Only about one third of the crew has
a \'real\' crew station and the rest are usually idle, except when at battle-
stations when they serve as the damage control crew.

  In combat, this should mean that the ship could operate without penalty until
it was below 1/3rd crew, but that damage control and repairs would begin to
suffer immediately.
  (This is also my resoning behind that I count each robot as three crew: robots
are active around the clock. But without the other 2/3rds of the normal crew as
damage control crew, you better hope nothing breaks!)

  The net result is that all plants over a certain size will take the same 
number of hits to destroy, regardless of how large the battery hitting and how
large the drive hit:(

  I agree with this. I am thinking along similar lines with drive damage in
Rebel Guard, shortly it is:
  A minor critical hit on the manuever drive resulting from a hit by a battery 
that did 1000 damage points will do the minimum of full inoperable damage for
the drive and 1000 damage points.
  The performance of the drive is degraded with full performance on zero damage
and zero performance at inoperable damage (ie a 100/200 5G manuever drive will
loose one G for every 20 points of damage).

  I\'m in two minds on wether using full inoperable or half inoperable as 
maximum, or maybe base it on the ships displacement.

You can if you like, but it seems to me that you are making the peculiar
assumption here that every control panel on the ship is concentrated on
the bridge.  No controls on the engines, or near the gun mounts?  If you\'ve
got SOM (which you\'ve quoted) it looks like dynamic reconfiguration ought
to let you get by without a physical bridge, which would certainly make a
\'bridge hit\' that didn\'t involve knocking out the entire distributed 
computer network a bit problematic.

Personally, my inclination at the moment is toward rewriting the critical
hits table and replacing Bridge Destroyed with something like "Crew-1, 
One Computer Destroyed, One of Each Comm and Sensor System Destroyed".

PART 6

Terra, mid-1119

	"Captain?"
	Grant opened his eyes slowly. Two strangers were leaning over
him. One was a man in his mid-20s, somehow foppish even in a nondescript 
prison coverall; the other was a rail-thin, immaculately shaven fellow
with thinning blonde hair and--
	Lord Corris\'s son. The family portrait in the shipwright\'s hall!
	No. No. That wasn\'t it. A noble, but not a Corris--a Tchorgin.
Yes. Mikhail Tchorgin, professional hostage. And Edison, professional
bitgeek. Hudson\'s bitgeek. MY bitgeek....
	Grant winced. "Ouch. This hurts my head...."
	"You and everyone else, Captain." The muscular blonde god got slowly
up from his seated position at the cell door and stalked over to Grant. He
was perfect, Grant noted absently. Nothing missing. Nothing.
	"How do you feel?" Nyborg\'s voice was cool.
	"Like my brain\'s been put through a juicer." Grant sat up, tried
to get to his feet, stopped. He looked around him slowly, suspicions flaring
and dying and flaring up again. Edison regarded him carefully, Tchorgin with 
a look of mild concern, Nyborg with a paranoid scowl. \'Captain,\' they\'d said. 
Captain WHO? 
	Edison made eye contact, then flicked his gaze upward for a moment. 
Grant followed the glance. His brow furrowed as he saw the tiny hole in the
ceiling above him. Oho, he thought. No wonder they\'re playing it crafty.
	He looked past Tchorgin, to where Newton was crouched over Tsogukh.
The huge Vargr was curled into a fetal position, rocking back and forth 
gently and whimpering softly in a language Grant didn\'t recognize as the
Transform dialect of Vuakedh that Kherkhoulloth spoke....
	He strode over to the pair, pushing gently past Tchorgin, who gave 
him a sympathetic pat on the shoulder as he passed. "How is he?"
	Newton looked up, hair in his eyes. He started to speak, looked 
annoyed, flicked the hair clumsily back from his face. "Pretty bad, sir."
	Grant seized on the simple gesture like a hawk on a ferret. He\'s not
used to having hair, he thought with grim satisfaction. Newton\'s got a full
head of hair-- but Fell DOESN\'T! More and more interesting.
	"They didn\'t even work him over for as long as they did the rest of 
us," Fell (Newton?) continued. "They brought him back here after only a few 
minutes, and the med orderly looked scareder than hell. He\'s been in this
shape ever since.... I can\'t get through to him at all."
	"Lovely, just LOVELY." Grant found the Hudsonism came easily to mind.
He looked at Fell carefully. "And how about YOU?"
	"I think," Fell said, weighing each word carefully, "I stood up under
this much better than the rest of you. I have a certain natural resistance to
this kind of punishment. And after all, Captain, we should be grateful we
were only worked on by rank amateurs-- the Zhodani would have wrung us out
and hung us up to dry by now." 
	"True enough." Grant got up and stretched, yawning. "So has anyone
been able to piece together what happened?"
	"I remember landing and trying to unload our cargo...." Newton\'s 
voice was hesitant.
	"We were accosted by StarPort Authority troopers and forced at 
gunpoint into a lockup-van," Tchorgin sniffed. "Plebeians."
	"They put us in a cell, and one by one they started taking people
out, starting with you, Captain," Nyborg continued grimly. "And everyone came 
back feeling like, well, like...."
	"Pling pling pling...."
	Grant turned around slowly. Edison was gazing vacantly into space;
he was softly singing a little song, just three notes over and over.
	"Pling pling pling, pling pling pling--"
	"Edison!" Hudson seized his arm roughly. "You gone nuts on us?"
	"Hm?" Edison\'s eyes focussed slowly on his commanding officer. "Uh, 
no sir. I was either (a) daydreaming (b) exhausted (c) suffering from as yet
unquantified aftereffects of the interrogation."
	"If that\'s what it was," Tchorgin snapped irritably. "What sort of 
interrogation doesn\'t involve asking any questions?"
	"One where they don\'t need to talk to you," Nyborg said quietly.
"If they suspected some kind of--"
	He was cut off by a yelp of sudden terror from the floor. Tsogukh 
uncurled from his huddled position abruptly and looked about him, seemingly
not recognizing any of the faces around him. He backed into a corner, holding 
up a hand as if to ward off a blow and whimpering in a garbled mixture of 
Vuakedh, Galanglic, and unintelligible gibberish.
	"O no please bahyakhta eenay Vfkhayikh arrrghafthaengzak I promise
kyulyolvai aenrraghz oun kokaasha eegh Urzaeng faeng faeng don\' hurt me...."
	"Hey, hey, hey," Fell soothed, leaning down near the terrified Vargr,
"Don\'t be afraid. It\'s US. Your FRIENDS, remember?" He began pointing to 
faces. "Captain Hudson, Edison, Nyborg, Tchorgin...."
	"SHEVEK!" The word burst out of Tsogukh\'s throat in a shriek, and he
threw himself forward and wrapped his arms around Fell\'s knees, his sobs 
redoubling in strength.
	The others merely looked confused, but Grant\'s eyes narrowed. Shevek.
What was it Sonderberg had said.... \'It\'d be interesting to see what sort of 
a song Shevek would sing.\' Another piece of the puzzle?
	"Shhhh...." Fell patted the crying alien\'s fur uncomfortably. "You 
know me, old buddy. Newton. Remember, Tsogukh?"
	The Vargr sat bolt upright as if stabbed. His eyes focussed into 
killing slits. "TSSSSSSOHHHHHHHHHH----" He leapt to his feet, fists 
clenched. "--GUKH!" He shhok himself from muzzle to tail as if drying himself 
off, and looked around him suspiciously. His voice dropped an octave.
	"Well, what are YOU all staring at?"
	Newton sighed in relief. "Thought we\'d lost you there for a minute,
friend," he said easily. "You okay?"
	"NO, I\'m not okay!" Tsogukh began to pace the small cell angrily. 
"What the hell did they do to me? Was it drugs? Torture? WHAT? I\'m so messed 
up I can\'t even remember my own name...."
	"You won\'t have to worry about that for much longer."
	Everyone whirled at the new voice from beyond the door. Through the
viewslit, they could just glimpse a helmeted head outside in the hall.
	"Time to go, gen\'l\'men. Any false moves, you die painful instead of 
clean. Got that?" The door swung open, and a burly SolSec guard in combat
armor strode into the room, Gauss pistol at the ready. "Turn away from me, 
all of you, and hands behind backs to be cuffed. I can cuff you one-handed, 
and I\'ll shoot if you give me any guff." 
	Tsogukh growled and coiled himself for a spring.
	"Ease OFF!" Hudson\'s voice nearly cracked with suppressed terror. 
"Stupid furball, you\'ll get us ALL killed!"
	Tsogukh\'s ears went back against his skull, and he slowly turned 
and put his hands behind his back. "Coward," he muttered under his breath.
	One by one, the cuffs were put on. Grant tested his gingerly, hoping 
that the circulation wouldn\'t be cut off from his hands.
	They loosened slightly. A ratchet clicked, almost inaudibly. 
	Jammed open!
	Grant stopped moving his arms, and looked over his shoulder at 
Edison, who was suddenly concentrating hard on something only he could see.
Fell was looking down at the floor in front of him. Feeling the Captain\'s
eyes upon him, he twitched an eyelid in a brief wink. 
	As they were herded out of the cell and down the sterile hallway,
Grant made eye contact with the guard, who regarded him carefully.
	"So what happens to us now?"
	"You\'re gonna get blown up trying to escape," the guard grinned back 
at him. "Back to the starport, back in your ship, liftoff to a hundred 
meters, and WHAMMO! Taken out by the defense batteries! No evidence left to 
sift through, nothin\'. Neat as neat can be."
	"Delightful," Nyborg sighed. They piled down a flight of metal stairs 
and out of a thick security door. The heat hit them like a blanket of fire,
sweat springing out on their faces in an instant. Tsogukh began to pant.
	The door opened out on a courtyard. The blazing sun had raised the 
temperature in the open court to the point where the air rippled and made
vision difficult. An unmarked police van was floating at the gate, and they 
were herded aboard by the guard, who sat down next to them with his pistol 
covering them all loosely. After a moment, another guard came in and sat down 
next to them, a Gauss rifle slung over his shoulder and a wary look on his 
face. The first guard looked at him, then at Grant, and gave a tiny shake of 
his head. 
	The sliding door slammed shut on them, and through the glass 
partition up front they saw a driver take his place at the controls, and the
gravid form of Agent Sonderberg huff in beside him. Sonderberg turned and 
waved into the back compartment at Grant, who pointedly ignored him. The 
agent grinned, and picked up an intercom mike from the dash.
	"Just a few more minutes, Becker."
	Damn right, Becker thought grimly. You fat bag of cancer, I\'m gonna 
give YOU \'Chief Special Operative in the Terra Theater\'! Take MY job, will 
you? Just a few more minutes....
	The van lurched into motion. No one spoke during the brief period it
took to cross the threshold and speed across the starport to where the 
Inexplicable was docked. The first guard relaxed after a moment, letting his 
gun hand rest on his knee, within reach of Nyborg. His eyes closed.
	"Pay attention, idiot," the second guard snarled.
	"Shaddup," was the yawned reply. "They\'re cuffed, ain\'t they?"
	Grant was watching through the front window as best he could. Down 
the service road and through the milling crowds, across the main thorofare, 
around a corner...and there before them was the blast shield for Landing
Pad 7-3-26. The automatic doors slid open exposing the long tunnel through
the shield to the inner landing area. Hudson did some fast math in his head.
Twenty kilometers per hour, say ten meters of tunnel--two seconds. It was 
going to have to be perfect. 
	Nyborg yawned and stretched, gathering his legs under his bench seat.
Tsogukh tried to scratch one hind leg with the other. Fell sat upright, 
trying to see their destination as the van glided smoothly into the mouth of 
the tunnel.
	Grant pulled convulsively on his cuffs. For a harrowing instant, the 
ratchet seemed to catch, then pulled free with a soft zipping noise. Beside 
him, the first guard yelled, "Hey, what the--"
	Simultaneously there was a loud thud and an "Oof!" From the other 
guard. Close on that was a veritable cacaphony of yells, growls, grunts, and 
scuffling noises. Sonderberg looked back through the window, and scowled in
frustration as the reflected sunlight from the tunnel\'s mouth on the glass
obscured his vision. He reached behind him blindly for the dash.
	Becker\'s voice was tight. "Nyborg! Door lock!"
	There was the thunk of a gauss shot, and the sliding door slammed 
open. Becker grabbed the door frame and swung himself in a tight arc around 
the frame, grabbing and pulling open the passenger door. At that moment the 
van burst out into the blazing sun again, almost in the shadow of the 
Inexplicable, and the thin man and the fat were rolling in the sand.
	The van screeched to a halt. The first guard was thrown free. 
Scrambling to his feet, he hissed to Fell, who was crawling after him,
"WNRK! Yell it, don\'t spell it!" And with that, he was sprinting for the
tunnel mouth. 
	Nyborg and Edison vaulted from the van, sprinting for the ship. 
Becker had managed to get free of Sonderberg and was staggering up the ramp,
his rival in hot pursuit. Suddenly a gleaming spherical object appeared in 
the open hatchway, hovering for a moment and then swooping down the ramp. It 
was the secretary-bot Hudson had nicknamed Hector.
	The sight of the familiar robot made Hudson pause for a moment, and 
Sonderberg took advantage of the delay, charging up and grabbing him in a 
hammerlock. "Got you!" he gurgled, panting and beet-red with exertion. "Never
get away!" 
	"Get clear, GET CLEAR!" Hector shrieked, bowling Edison over. 
"Someone\'s initiated an automatic takeoff sequence! We only have a few 
seconds--"
	"YOW!" Edison wasn\'t a gambling man. He skidded to a halt and turned 
back to the van, only in time to see the senseless body of the driver crumple 
to the sand. Fell leaped behind the wheel, and the van spun up off the ground
and into motion, Tchorgin kicking the dead guard out of the back and Tsogukh 
scrambling to get onto the roof. Edison leaped for the van, as the 
Inexplicable\'s thruster plates suddenly burst into agonizing radiance and the 
rusty old freighter began to lift off the ground, Becker and Sonderberg still
grappling madly on the rocking, shaking gangplank. With a mighty heave, 
Nyborg leaped and grabbed hold of the end of the ramp just before it rose out 
of reach. In a few seconds, he had gained the ramp\'s surface, and charged 
into the fray.
	Sonderberg looked up, just in time to scream in agony as a round from 
the Gauss pistol ripped into his shoulder. He let go of Becker\'s throat, and
the semiconscious agent rolled down the ramp and off the end, plummeting 
toward the ground below.
	"GOTCHA!" Tsogukh\'s powerful haunches flexed under the sudden strain
as he caught his commander\'s limp body in his arms. "DRIVE, FELL!"
	The van spun away into the blast tunnel, unnoticed as Sonderberg and
Nyborg faced off on the pitching ramp. Nyborg looked over his shoulder. They 
were ten meters high and rising. Any second now, the defense batteries would
open fire....
	"Nyborg, for God\'s SAKE!" Sonderberg sobbed, his pudgy fingers 
clutching at the empty air that had been his worst rival\'s throat a moment 
ago. "You\'re a Loyalist! And so was CHANDRA! It doesn\'t have to be like 
this-- we can HEAL you...!"
	The smile that answered him was calm and self-assured. "I am 
Daryavayush Michael O\'Connor, FSO, and native of Iddamakur. Your death will 
be the most important of my career. I\'m sorry that I can\'t take credit for 
it...."
	Sonderberg sank to his knees, the blood loss making him dizzy. "Uh?"
	"You\'re about to be killed by the attack YOU ORDERED." They were 
above the wall now. Far away, O\'Connor saw the plumes of the missile 
launchers as they fired. He shook his head in disbelief. 
	"Another shining example of SolSec efficiency."
	They were the last words he ever spoke.

	The van shot flailing out of the blast tunnel and shot across the
service alleyway, rounding the bend past the neighboring wall a bare second
before the blast sent a column of roaring fire down the tunnel after it. The
flash lit up the sky to impossible brightness, and the crash and roar of the
Inexplicable\'s funeral pyre mingled with the screams in the crowd as burning
debris rained down on the port. 
	"This is a fine set of circumstances," Edison remarked as the van 
bucked under the blast wave. "We are now (1) on a foreign planet under 
hostile control (2) wanted by the police, SPA, and SolSec (3) minus our best 
combat expert (4) mentally in less than peak form (5) penniless (6) without
identification papers (7) minus our only transportation off-planet (8) 
dressed in prison garb (9) exhausted (10) hungry and (11) apparently in 
no position to even attempt considering intelligent options as to our next 
move."
	"No problem," Tchorgin smiled. Or was it Jaeger?

Does anyone have any information about nobility in the Imperium?  In
particular, how involved is a duke or duchess in actually running their
dukedom or duchy?  If they decided to go galloping across the galaxy,
would they be chastised for neglecting their duties?  Or would it be quite
common to leave the operation of the dukedom or duchy in the hands of some
type of administrator?

What about special rights of these high nobles?  When visiting a planet
with a high law level, can they expect to be allowed to keep their weapons?

How much control, if any, do they have over planets within their dukedom
or duchy?  As I understand it, the Imperium merely rules the space BETWEEN
the stars, rather than the planets themselves.

How much access could they get to meeting with government leaders on
planets outside of their area?

How widely known is a duke or duchess outside of their area?  If they are
out in public on a planet a couple of subsectors away from their home, would
people be pointing and saying, "Look, it\'s Duke So-and-So"?  If they arrive
at a planet, will they be met at the starport by an official delegation, a
brass band, and a flock of reporters?

How much financial power would you say a duke or duchess typically has?  The
income from the pension as given in the MT rules just doesn\'t seem high
enough for someone who in theory rules such a vast area.  At the same time,
however, I\'m somewhat reluctant to tell them they have vast resources at
their disposal, as that would tend to upset game balance.

control system.

Frankly, who ever wrote up that idea for traveller didn\'t think about it
for too long.

The Starship Operators manual says these things are used at speeds
approaching 1 million RPM.  Ok, lets assume a gyro 1 meter in radius, and
say 1000 kilograms.  (sound reasonable?)
The centifugal force felt at the edge of this ring (1 million RPM) is some
thing about 11 billion+ times the force of gravity.
Nothing, Not even an ancient artifact will hold up to that.
Ok, Now, what about the potential energy of this gyro?  Well, according
to the old back of the envelope it has the equivalent energy of a
1.22 kiloton bomb.  According to the S.O.M. these things are kept at
"near" vacuum, at the center of mass of the ship.
	Well, who out there wants a 1.22 kiloton bomb at the spine of
their ship?  The manual talks about the extensive precautions needed to
protect the ship from the gyro.  Jettison systems, and an \'Inertial
Braking system\' which reduces the energy of the gyro.
The precautions sound shakey at best and wrecklessly dangerous at worst.
If the gyro started to have problems, It would be a danger to the ship in
1/100,000 of a second.  No Warning.  If a frictionless bearing started to
go out, it would tear itself to ribbons before the computer ever knew what
hit it.  And when that gyro hits a structural member it will fly apart
under 11 billion G\'s and destroy the ship totally.  The center of mass of the
ship is going to be where the spinal mount (if any) runs, and it will
probably be where the keel of the ship runs as well.  One little mishap
and your ship snaps in half.
	As to the advantages of the gyro.  Frankly, I don\'t see any.
They have gone to great lengths in the Manual to describe how the
thrust from the main drive is articulated sufficiently so that the
classic 1G ship can take off vertically.  Are they trying to say that
turning on axis is more difficult than hovering?  It makes no sence.

Add to the fact that the gyro is at the center of mass of the ship.
In order to turn the ship you will have to exert enourmous force on
the gyro.  The thrusters have a much larger lever arm and it will be
MUCH easier.  The problem is analogous to turning a bolt with your
bare hands and turning the same bolt with a twenty meter long
wrench.

Looking back on what I said, computers ought to be fast enough to recognize
a problem in the gyro.  But they won\'t be able to do much about it, and if
something goes wrong with the safety systems, you are DEAD.  A braking system
has to absorb 1.22 kilotons worth of energy to prevent disaster.

Scott Kellogg

Actually, I don\'t like the sound of the inertial braking system either,
It makes it sound as though it absorbs the inertia.  This sounds to much
like a physics nullifier to me.  I always thought of inertial compensators
as grav plates which increase or decrease in output dependant upon the
acceleration produced by the drives.

In any ship I designed under High Guard, "excess power" by your definition
was zero, or slightly positive - I tried to make the power plant just capable
of powering everything on the ship, usually adding a few more lasers if I had
spare power available.

My problem is that I have too much experience in High Guard, and keep
forgetting that some people (not you, Scott! :-) are trying to design
MT ships with no prior knowledge of High Guard.  I suspect that the MT
authors have the same problem.

> 		(Power req for maneuver drive + "excess" Power)
> Agility=	----*10
> 			Loaded Weight

This could finally give the ship\'s engineer something interesting to do in
combat - some sort of task roll to arrange the power distribution to the
various systems demanding power.  Let\'s see ...

To distribute power among the ship\'s systems:
Routine, Starship Engineering, INT, 6 seconds
Referee: Exceptional success means that the engineer has 1% more power
available than the power plant\'s normal output; perhaps he has been clever
with the timing (route power to the sensors, then route power to the weapons)
or perhaps he has managed to coax the power plant into operating a little
more efficiently.  Exceptional failure means that the engineer has 1% less
power to use; he has been clumsy, or the power plant is playing up.


I leave it to experienced MT referees to alter such things as difficulty level,
time increment and results of exceptional success/failure.

I don\'t know where Joe Fugate says that, but the book in question should
probably be scrapped.  As you say, he can spin all he like, it won\'t bother
my meson gunner!  :-)  At least, not unless he also turns on the drives and
changes his course.

Now I\'m confused again.  Scott seems to be the "certain folk round here",
as his definition was:
> "Excess Power": Is the amount of power left over after all systems have
> been powered (Sensors, Weapons, Drives, Environ, Comm, etc. etc.)

In any ship I designed under High Guard, "excess power" by this definition
was zero, or slightly positive - I tried to make the power plant just capable
of powering everything on the ship, usually adding a few more lasers if I had
spare power available.

MT\'s definition of "excess power" is a bit vague: "power left over from the
power plant after all of the craft\'s other components have been powered".
It doesn\'t define "other components", though.  If that includes the manoeuvre
drive (as in Scott\'s version) then it\'s useless.  If it doesn\'t include the
manoeuvre drive (which is how I interpreted it, being a High Guard veteran)
then the equation in the manual works just fine.

Number 9, the oh-hell-somebody-just-shot-the-Emperor issue announcing
the birth of MegaTraveller. However, if you don\'t have that one, I can
answer your questions with a reasonable degree of authority. 

<pause as Metlay dons his Historian hat>

Based on how the GDW/DGP Traveller universe works, Dominic, you blew it
bigtime when you let two characters roll up random dukes and duchesses.
On the IMperial noble rankings, the ducal seat is the highest to which
anyone can ever hope to aspire without assassinating the Emperor! A duke
not only has Imperial powers of fleet command and revenue from planets
under his sphere of influence, but also owns fiefdoms of his own that
his household administers directly. The same is true of other nobles,
but the difference where a duke is concerned is SCALE: a duke has direct
control over anywhere from two to six entire PLANETS as personal fiefdoms
(read: as far as the Emperor is concerned, those worlds are the duke\'s 
personal property), and administrative power over an entire SECTOR! That\'s
sixteen subsectors, and usually hundreds of planets, that need to be 
administered. And administered DIRECTLY, not through a bureaucracy.

A duke can take vacations for brief periods on his own fief-worlds, or
extended ones due to health reasons, but not without causing some measure
of concern on the part of his government officials. He will NEVER leave
his sector of power unless on extremely important affairs of state, for
example to visit the Emperor for some reason or another, and he leaves his
power base for as little time away as possible. He will NEVER travel
incognito unless his life and future are on the line (Norris retrieving
the vital document he needed in the 5FW), and on any other occasion his
travels are widely publicized and treated with HUGE fanfare-- he will
have no more chance of a quiet trip than an American President would.
He has effectively infinite wealth and infinite resources to call upon,
up to and including entire Naval fleets and entire planetary treasuries.
If he DOES join a party, each and every adventure must revolve around him
and only him, and the party will essentially be part of his huge retinue.
There are only a few dozen dukes in the entire Imperium, if that many,
and each and every one is known by name by every schoolchild in the state.
The oligharchic nature of the Imperium makes nobles of the higher ranks
especially revered, and that means a duke will be well-known and received
in pomp wherever he goes. Period.

Oh, and I assume the duchess is the duke\'s wife? Two of them in the same
room would never happen except on state visits to Capital, otherwise;
that means that one or the other spouse is actually a consort, and enjoys
a lot of the privileges but little of the actual power. Two dukes of two
sectors adventuring together as part of a party is utter ridiculousness.
ONE is too, but two basically brands the adventure as impossible....

My advice is that you scale the characters back to an absolute maximum
of Social 13, and maybe only 12. Most barons have a fair amount of power
of their own, and receive good treatment when they travel, but administer
only sections of worlds (or entire, small worlds) and have little clout
beyond their systems. A marquis would have some power and influence over
a subsector or two-- that\'s often fifty worlds-- as well as having an
entire world as a fiefdom, and by that level, his movements are newsworthy
and he is an unsuitable party member. I find that if the players treat the
nobles as they should, any noble over rank 12 utterly trashes game
balance. Good luck!

I believe it was more a function of m-drive. A minimum P-plant 2 was needed to
run a maneuver-2. Most ships usually had much higher P-plants.

Two points. First the High Guard sytem was far more abstract than the MT
abstraction. Secondly. Agility and M-drive was almost synonymous in High Guard
which is not true any more (to belabor the point).

>Rationalization:  The 6G ship\'s power plant is being drained away

Not necessarily. I believe what it meant was an abstract way of representing
evasiveness. Besides if the 6-G P-plant is only putting out 1-G, why not just get
a 1-G drive and use the space for s-thing else.


>In view of the MegaTrav design rules this does not translate unless

Why does it have to translate? I think part of our problem is an attempt to High
Guardize, Megatraveeler starship combat system. I wish GDW had totally redone the
system and left no references to High Guard. Basically for all practical
purposes, Megatraveller is an entirely new game from Traveller. In many ways even
the universe is quite different.

>Agility may not exceed maneuver drive rating.
>(No more agility=6 1-G drive ships...)

So??? Were there ever any such ships? High Guard certainly disallowed it and so
does MT.

What you still haven\'t made clear is how your agility explanation is more
rational. Are the M-drives of a 6-G agility 3 ship pulling actually 9-G
acceleration!!! These eqns are just as arbitrary as the one in MT.


>His opinion is that we should use the loaded weight for the above

But since there are anti grav modules on board, does the loaded weight really
matter?? I think it was more a question of mass and inertia then weight. However
I do tend to agree with this as it will make all agilities more sensible, just
as adding the mass of armor has.

Why 10?? It is still arbitrary. I would prefer 5, as I personally think that all
ships are too over agile anyway.

Most starships according to Starship Ops manual use overdrives for short periods
routinely to get off planets. Why can\'t this overdrive ability be considered a
ship\'s "agility" in combat. It would explain why it is useful in combat. A 6-G
ship all of a sudden pulling 24-G(even for 30 sec) can screw up any one\'s aim
especially at stellar distances. Assume a 6-G agility 6 ship making 24-G bursts
or 6-G lateral thrusts for 30 sec every 5 minutes can be about 50km from its
predicted location.

Again the question is whether starcraft "agility" has any meaning beyond MT
combat. A grav fighter agility 6 can produce SUSTAINED 6-G turns for 20 min. If
you take my above explanation it can pull up to 24-G for short periods with no
discomfort to its passenger. A Tomcat pilot doing 6-G turns for 20 minutes....!!!

I think COACC is terrible in its most interesting and useful part - the air-space
interface combat involving aircraft and space craft. It is not clearly detailed
and really makes no sense. It makes no real effort to explain any such combat
even though it claims to be basically about this concentrating more on air-air
and air-ground combat. In many ways it is a parallel set of rules to the starship
combat rules.

I presume you mean for COACC. If you intend to give space fighters involved in
MT starship combat agility 9 then there is a major problem. An Agility 9 TL15
fighter(<100t) with Model 9 comp will be impossible to hit except by a spinal PA.
An agility 11 fighter will be totally impossible to hit.

	Actually, (contrary to Metlay\'s post...) I was under the impression 
that the average Duke was in charge of a Subsector, not a full sector.  
Norris, for example, was only the Regina subsector duke, and there have been
subsequent mentions of other Duke (actually, Dutchess of Mora whatshername 8-)
level personae in the marches.  So it\'s not _quite_ as bad as you made it out
to be.

	That does not mean that a Duke, even a subsector duke, is playable...
as the US Secret Service currently does, there is _nothing_ that they will
be allowed to do without having their security people there.  Until you
drop down to Baron, they\'re unreasonable to play.  (Even a Marquis will be
about as constrained as a modern superpower leader...).

Now now... let\'s not be evil green meanies from the planet Zongo  :-)
Dominic\'s situation seems salvagable, and perhaps even advantageous
with a little bit of monkeying (of which I\'m, notoriously in favor).

But first, a little background:

Bob Swarm\'s article in DGP\'s Digest #9 divides the nobility into
three classes: the honor, rank, and high nobility. Although well
written, I\'ve always found this separation a tad cumbersome.
Effectively depowering the lesser nobility, it seemed to be
rationalizing a rules system which was either (a) inherently
flawed from the beginning or (b) meant to be played within an
environment of imagination often reserved only for high-fantasy.

Let\'s face it. It\'s not entirely out of the question that a
character should roll a natural 12 on Social Standing and then
add three points in service. If such a situation occurs, though
unusual, must it be the GM\'s responsibility to deny the "Ducal"
status in the name of party-balance?

> I find that if the players treat the
> nobles as they should, any noble over rank 12 utterly trashes game
> balance. Good luck!

Agreed, game balance is put in dire jeopardy, but there are three
generic alternatives.

(1) The Brash Young Princeling

If you can\'t stand the thought of granting estate, fleet, and taxes,
make the socially deviant character an offspring of the Duke, thus
allowing the title, a suitable pension, and lavish adventure
opportunities without all the mess of going overboard with
massive administrative responsibilities and unlimited resources.

(2) Oh heck... I hate Zhodani invasions!

Okay... so the character really is a Duke/Duchess, but suddenly their
Domain gets taken over by barbarian invaders with funny looking
noses. (suggested for the hack\'n\'slashers out there)

   Better learn to say "incognito" ten times fast....

(3) Double heck... Nothing like traitors to spoil the afternoon tea!

Well... maybe the barbarians with funny noses are busy playing golf.
If so, you can always count on a little internal strife. Are the
masses dissatisfied with Imperial rule? Maybe Coca-Farben and
SuSag want to stick the Duke\'s nephew into power. He was, afterall,
an economics major at the Imperial Academy of Science and Medicine.
Then again, maybe the Duke has left the administration of things to
his Ministry of Internal Affairs while he goes off to pursue some
extra-marital ones, preferably without public surveylance. Maybe the
grandadmiral of his fleets (coincidentally a neice of the Emperor) decided
to turn the Imperial Palace into a Naval Supply Depot. Hey... we can
have a little fun, can\'t we?


The bottom line here... and maybe it isn\'t the bottom line (I dunno)...
is that every new situation can bring on some pretty impressive
roleplaying opportunities. A lot will have to do with how the players
handle it. I\'ve been a notorious nerd when put in positions of
supreme authority... but if you have the right combination of players,
nearly anything can work. So don\'t destroy it on GM-whim. Let things
unfold under the players\' devices, and then see what opportunities
can be realized and what problems need fixing.

the Skydiver is a brilliant example of a later-commonplace idea (a
planetary defence fighter with what essentially amounts to a mobile
undersea launch pad) at a low TL. Great fun! Oh, parenthetically, the
"coolest car ever designed" that the show\'s star drove was a real
automobile, although very few of them were ever made available for
sale; it was a Chevrolet Astro III, last in the series of Astro "concept
cars" (and LEAST flashy of them all; the Astro I literally looked and
drove like something out of The Jetsons).

The Shadow Fleet is something that\'s still floating around my MT universe,
altho it\'s now tied (sorta) to the official MT historical line in a clear
manner. Basically, the Shadow Fleet is a widespread, mysterious "fleet" of
starships ranging in size from scouts to Tigresses, usually appearing
only one at a time under bizarre circumstances at various points in the
Imperium. The ships of the Fleet are always painted absolutely flat dead
black from end to end (illegal under Imperial shipping laws, which require 
that a certain large percentage of ships be painted brightly to aid in
visual starport approach and docking guidance), and very often they do
NOT show up on any planetary defense sensing systems (for reasons I can\'t
really divulge here, since people who play my game read this). They\'re
usually seen only briefly under mysterious circumstances, and those who
DO see them rarely talk about them-- people who do tend to vanish.

A lot of my early Traveller adventures were built around the Shadow Fleet,

be willing to achieve some sort of a consensus for TDR? Hmmmmmmm?

Sorry, that I haven\'t responded sooner...  Went up to Gencon and talked to
both GDW and DGP.  When I was at the GDW booth there were no Challenge
people there so the best that they could do for me was to take my name and
address so that they could send their "Writers guidelines".  Interestingly
enough one of the names that had signed up for these guidelines I
recognized...  Charles Kallenbach (I think that\'s how it\'s spelled) how was
one of the people behind Paranoia Press in the early 1980\'s (Beyond,
Vangard Reaches, SORAG, etc.).  Hopefully we will see some new material
from him!

Anyway I also talked to Joe Fugate and Rob Caswell at DGP.  I asked them if
they were interested in submissions for MTJ and Joe said that Rob was the
one responsible for submissions.  So I gave them a copy of the rough draft
(on both paper and floppy) and explained a little about what we\'ve been
discussing.  Rob was not aware of TML but Joe was.  They seemed very
interested in the article, Joe pointed out that their new base of
operations is fairly close to yours.
They made sure that they had both my home and work address and phone #. 
Only time will tell...

Otherwise Gencon was enjoyable even though there was no new MegaTrav
products, unless you want to count Challenge 51.  Solomani and Aslan should
be released in October, and the new GDW adventure should be released in
September.  There was several vendors that had older Traveller material,
and I managed to pick up some replacement copies of some of my time worn
old books.  All in all an enjoyable time.

After a year playing MT, our group is trying 2300.  So far, they seem to like 
it.  I am in the process of steering them toward an organization... 

My question for other 2300 refs is:  What sorts of organizations do you use?  
My group does not have a real military bent, so an Army or whatnot is out.
I\'d rather not say what I am using, since Brucer (aka Zben Blaine) is a list
member, but I\'d be interested to see if other refs do use organizations as 
suggested in the text, and what types.

As to organizations vs. national governments, there are some examples:  The IRA
vs. the British govt,  Greenpeace vs. the French, Amnesty International vs. a
whole lot of people, etc.  Note that these conflicts/interactions are not always
violent, but can be legal or public relations bouts.  

I don\'t see why any organization would seek to replace the services provided by
governments (like police or social services) while there are governments still 
willing to provide them.  Of course, quasi-governmental organizations, or 
government-wannabes, like the PLO, often provide such services, and operate as 
"governments-in-exile".

    'body' => 'Agility, as I understand it is the ablity of a craft to maneuver out of
harms way.

I think we are in agreement that agility does not refer to the ability
to rotate a ship.  After all, doing so is not going to help the defender
very much.  Given that starship combat rounds are 20 minutes, I think that
any ship ought to be able to turn itself around in that time limit...

Therefore agility must have something to do with the craft\'s ability to
alter its heading.  This means maneuver drive.  If you are fighting with
another ship at a range of 2 light seconds, it will take 4 seconds for
the target information to be acted upon:
Radar bounces off target
  (2 seconds)
Firing ship picks up location of target and fires
  (2 seconds)
Laser beams from firing ship reach area of target ship
  Total time:  4 seconds.

That gives you four seconds for your ship to move to a new location.
So to the firing ship there is a certain area around the target ship
where it could potentially be.   The size of that area (and hence the
uncertainty of it\'s location) is going to be directly proportional to
the maneuver drive capability of the target ship.

This is why I think agility is the actual performance of the maneuver drive.
High Guard certainly seemed to work that way.  And I believe that it was
the intention of the authors of MegaTrav to use a system that worked.

So, in my book, Agility=maneuver drive (there are times when there is not
sufficient power for the maneuver drive and the maneuver drive is reduced
accordingly, this is why agility is sometimes (often) lower than the
maneuver drive number.

I think that we are basically in agreement with Adrian Hurt when we propose
that the numerator of the agility equation contains the power needed by
the maneuver drive to funtion plus "extra" power if there is any.
(maybe I\'m not reading him right but I think that is what we are both saying)

He has pointed out that a good, well thought out design ought to have Zero
excess power.  I agree.  But if your power plant is too small to power
up the ol\' power hungry laser turret, then you can do so by stealing power
meant for the maneuver drive.  (Double dipping)  This is the case for many
\'standard\' ships that didn\'t originally have lasers mounted on them...
	{hint:  Think of converting book 2 designs to high guard}

Agility in Aircraft.
Spacecraft must rely on their maneuver drives to increase the area of
uncertainty around them on the target scopes of their attackers...
Aircraft, in addition to their engines, have their wings.  An aircraft
can use the wings to turn at much higher rates than a grav vehicle or
spacecraft.  Thus their agilities should be higher.  (Please note that
an aircraft will only be able to do so in an atmosphere.  An Aircraft
funtioning in vacuum will only have its engines to push itself around
with)
The upper limit of the human body to withstand G\'s is around 9 G\'s.
Thus the upper limit of an aircraft\'s ability to turn is 9 G\'s.  This
is considerably higher than a grav vehicle\'s ability to turn.  This
is why I think a fixed wing aircraft should have an upper limit of
agility at 9, until such time as inertial compensators can be brought to
solve the problem.

	Aircraft/Spacecraft combat.  If the combat is to take place in the
air at ranges within a few hundred kilometers, then I think that I would
use the air to air rules as set out in COACC.

	In Space or at ranges were visual contact is impossible (normal
space combat ranges) I would use the space combat rules.

Air to air is much closer and should be much quicker.  That is where you
will want to know what the ROF of a Beam laser turret is.

Scott Kellogg

The one real advantage a grav vehicle has over a fixed wing ship is that
the grav vehicle can brake with the full thrust of it\'s engines.  An
aircraft can turn at faster rates, but it can\'t quite brake like that.
(unless you are flying a fly-by-wire Su-27 and feel like pulling
the Pugachev\'s cobra maneuver... {Pulling the nose back so that the angle
of attack is greater than 90 degrees...})

Well, your analysis shows that such an assumption isn\'t reasonable.  Why
not assume that the gyro is smaller and less massive?  The high rate of
spin would presumably allow a small gyro, which would take up less space
and be less of a danger.  I haven\'t done the math, of course, but I think
that if your math shows a gyro with a 2-meter diameter is too dangerous,
then one can assume that the gyro would be smaller than 2 meters.

I\'m a player, not a ref, so I don\'t have all the details :-).

In our campaign, the entire party is the alterday crew of a startship owned
and operated by Trilon Inc. Trilon is a very large American company that
operates mostly in the French arm. They have their own planet (Kie-Yuma)
which, while nominally under American law, is really completely run by
Trilon.

You see, Trilon is taking the long view. They figure that Humanity is going
to be around for a long time, so they\'ve started a terraforming project on
Kie Yuma (Planet looks alot like the one in Aliens :-). They are planning to
completely own/operate the resulting planet, completely severing any ties to
a national government.

Now for our adventuring: Our starship is one of Trilon\'s troubleshooter
platforms; if there\'s a Trilon problem somewhere they send us to investigate
and resolve the situation. This can be everything from labour disputes to
evil corrupt governments to capturing Kafer technology to saving New York
City from nuclear terrorists to...

This makes for a fun, useful venue for almost any adventure you can think of.

again, who knows how much time we\'ll have?) in which the driving
organization is the Texas Rangers (and, by extension, the Texan
gov\'t).  The other "organization" in the picture is the UAR -- guess
which adventure I\'m running. :) I\'m about to introduce a new player
who is a native of a Life Foundation colony and who is a journalist
(whether she\'s free-lance and if so, to what degree, has yet to be
decided).  I\'d sort of like to get them involved w/the Trilon Corp. at
some point, since I have a couple of far-frontier adventures in mind.
Bob, if you get away from military-type adventuring, I\'d be interested
in knowing what you do; 2300AD seems to almost force you into some
form of cowboys-and-indians type adventure.  (BTW, if you want to
discuss this off the list, my email address is lusk@cs.unc.edu.)

I discussed the foundations-vs-nat\'l-gov\'t question on CompuServe, and
reached some conclusions: with the exception of extra-legal
organizations (IRA, PLO, Provolution), organizations don\'t even
pretend to compete w/nat\'l gov\'ts.  Organization members still have
national identities, and pay taxes to their respective national
governments (less any applicable exemptions).  They also have strong
"organizational" identities.  For example, a troubleshooter (whatever
THAT is) working for NARL might have grown up in Germany or on a
German colony.  He would think of himself as German, but he has a
greater affinity for ideals that transcend national boundaries.  He
pays German taxes, but he\'s really subject to the laws of whatever
locality he\'s in.

I guess it\'s all fairly obvious, but some of the statements in the
Adventurer\'s and Director\'s Guides really threw me for a loop.  The
organization\'s goals become the player\'s goals (unless they\'re TRULY
independent), and for just about every goal, there\'s an organization.

Now I\'ll go out on a limb and firmly state my own opinions: It seems
to me that, even today, national governments are more or less the
same.  They provide the same basic services to their citizens, impose
the same more-or-less commonsense laws, and hit \'em w/taxes.  The more
services, the more taxes.  Differences show up mostly as cultural
differences, which should be role-played.  I don\'t really see
organizations like the Pesh Murga or the PLO going into space,
although groups using the same tactics may arise on colonies
struggling for independence.  Really outlandish situations, like the
civil war in Ethiopia with all its attendant complexities, or the
suppression of the Indian population of Guatemala, or the requirement
that the government of Lebanon be made of differing religious groups
(Christian PM, Islamic President, etc) won\'t be directly transplanted
to the colonies, but might be duplicated, somehow.  According to the
official history, only a few colonies have rebelled, so it really
sounds like business as usual out there.

Good grief, if I\'m not careful, I\'ll just write incoherently for
hours!

that bad!! There are supposed to be about 1 for every 2 subsectors
on average I believe. Maybe you are thinking of archdukes. However
these are an even rarer species. There can be many dukes in a
sector. One of them could become top dog  and be a sector duke. All
these people would have the same social standing(F).

I quote the Imperial Encyclopedia:

     Duke: The fifth level of noble rank is duke, who is associated
     with a subsector or sector. 
     .
     .
     An individual accorded a duchy may receive a fief of land on
     single world, generally not more than 100,000 square km.


That definition does not entirely go together with metlay\'s. Dukes
DONOT control planets. The ArchDuke of Ilelish does not run the
government of Dlan. The government being a religious dictatorship.
The archduke is not the right religion even though he is a native.
I think we have to separate Imperial administrative control from
local one. The Duke of Regina is also Count of Yori yet he
INFLUENCES not controls both governments. He heads the Imperial
civil service for the subsector. In our terms think of him as a US
senator. He influences and controls much of what goes on in his
state but the actual government is left to locals. 

In game terms, I tend to side more with metlay. If you give a
player all the benefits of nobility you make the game centered
around that person. If you don\'t then it can be construed to be a
waste of a skill roll. 

However there is hope. Aside from being incognito, the noble
character can be from worlds just overrun by Vargrs. Tons of these
in Corridor and Lishun. He could be on the run from Lucan! All his
estates confiscated by the Imperium. They could also be "local"
dukes. Basically from worlds with feudal governments. Lastly they
can be Dukes by default. The character was originally 4 offspring
of 3rd cousin to the actual Duke. But since the entire family was
killed/murdered/assassinated the character is now a duke by
default. The other PCs could have been hired originally to get the
poor person from being killed. Maybe a few could be his retainers
too. Also depending on the characters age etc you could say he
abdicated (voluntarily or otherwise) his powers to someone else but
not the title. A particularly cruel idea is that the character
could be a Duke on the Solomani Rim on a long vacation in the
Marches on a unlimited travel/credit voucher from Sharurshiid but
with the retrenchment of the Vilani and the war his voucher is
worth nothing and the character has no money and no means of
getting back to his OCCUPIED home.

Again a high noble character does not have to be a hindrance to
play. Instead the character can be a source of many ideas and
adventures. The character could be a campaign basis with individual
adventures not necessarily based on him

An historical equivelent of this is the late British Lord Louis Montbatten.
 Montbatten was born fairly high in British nobility and spent his life in
service to his country.  In Traveller terms he probably started with a high
Social Standing (9, A or B anyway) and increased it during his life, but
any increase was manifested only in terms of reputation and recognition
rather than power.  In the end this was his downfall since it made him a
highly visable target (in his case of the IRA).

I agree. A \'Travelling\' imperial noble is really quite ridiculous (as
IMO is an ex-High Admiral or other high imperial official).

No indeed. It is actually quite likely that one will show up if
you play long enough.

Yes! Yes! Yes! It is ALWAYS the responsibility of the GM to vet
the rules and veto anything that will upset the game (remind me
sometimes to tell you about the time I played classic Traveller
with a GM who played _by_the_book_!)

The solution I\'ve adopted is to ignore the MegaTraveller version of
nobles and stick to the classic Traveller interpretation. Vis: That
the ranks rolled up on the character generation tables are _local_
_planetary_ranks. I furthermore interpret noble rank in the conti-
nental manner (in which all the sons of a noble inherits the rank)
instead of the english. This makes nobles much easier to handle ;-)

IGN Aganar Class "Light Cruiser" TL13

     The first Aganar class light cruiser was built by the Imperial Glisten 
Navy in 997.  The last of the sixty vessels was commissioned in 1029.  The 
ships are named for famous battles of history.  At the outbreak of the Fifth 
Frontier War, the Aganars were the oldest class of vessels still in service 
with the IGN, and were committed to action immediately as one of the few 
meson gun carrier classes in use.  Merely the technological equals of their 
opponents in the Collace Independence Fleet, and heavily outnumbered at every 
encounter due to the vagaries of their pre-war deployment, the Aganar squad-
rons were virtually annihilated in the opening weeks of the war.  Between 
combat losses and the destruction of a number of damaged ships under repair 
during the brief Collace occupation of Glisten, only a single ship out of the 
sixty, the IGNS Alesia, survived through the end of the war.  The Alesia was 
reclassified as a fleet escort during the fleet reorganization of 1112, and 
was still in service as a training vessel as of 1118.  
     Short duration was a major problem of the class--immediate refueling 
upon entering a system was a necessity, but was considered an acceptable 
trade-off in return for the meson gun mounted on such a comparitively small 
hull.

Collace Retribution Class Light Cruiser TL13

     The Retribution class light cruiser is one of four standard designs 
produced for the Collace Independence Fleet prior to the Fifth Frontier War.  
Like the others, every effort was made to make these vessels easy to assem-
ble, and over a hundred were in service by the outbreak of the war.  A small 
group of these cruisers, along with one Freedom class battlecruiser escaped 
from the final battle at Collace where they had been stationed throughout the 
war, and were eventually sold to an Aslan clan navy in the Trojan Reach sec-
tor, and participated in the attack on Glisten in 1119, twelve years after 
their sisters.

And this "extra power" is defined as "power plant output minus power used by
all systems, including manoeuvre drive".  Let\'s try converting it to algebra:

	  Pm + Pe
Agility = ---- * 10
	     M

where Pm is power used by manouevre drive, Pe is "excess power", M is mass of
ship.

Your definition of excess power is:

Pe = Pp - Pm - Ps - Pw - Penv - Pc

where Pp is output of power plant, Ps is power used by various low-power
systems (comms, sensors etc.), Pw is power used by weapons, Penv is power
used by environmental controls, and Pc is power used by computers.  So,

	  Pm + Pp - Pm - Ps - Pw - Penv - Pc
Agility = ---- * 10
	     		M

Note that Pm can now be eliminated:

	  Pp - Ps - Pw - Penv - Pc
Agility = ---- * 10
	     	     M

And that top line is what I call "power available to the manoeuvre drive".
Pm, the power rating of the manoeuvre drive, doesn\'t come into the equation,
except for being an upper limit on the numerator - the manoeuvre drive can\'t
use more power than its maximum rating, and that\'s how you prevent agility
from exceeding manoeuvre rating.

In which case it\'s spinning faster, and still dangerous.  I have a vague
memory of a S.F. short story in which a ship used gyros for turning, and
was therefore very slow on the turn.  There was a comment to the effect that
there were two ways of turning the ship; thrusters, which were difficult to
balance and to do precise manoeuvres, and gyros, which gave the ship all the
agility of a bogged hippopotamus.  (It\'s the "bogged hippopotamus" bit I
remember most accurately.  :-)

royal pain in the butt. The various workarounds suggested by some folx
are workable only in a very broad sense; from a practical standpoint,
the higher a character\'s Soc is the less useful a PC he\'ll make, because
he\'ll be out of sync with the way "normal" people get things done. Lord
Mountbatten is a poor example, BECAUSE his Soc was B or less-- he wasn\'t
ennobled to the point where he was really living a life that was that much
different from anyone else\'s. You want a better example? Take the first
son of, oh, say, the Emir of Bahrain, and dump him in the middle of Kenya
with no money, no ID, and a steady job to keep himself fed. There\'s a common
language (English), but until and unless he wires Daddy for help he\'s gonna
be a fish out of water. The higher one\'s rank, the less actual work one
does-- that\'s how oligarchies WORK. Sure a duke has duties, but his life 
is going to less like that of a commoner than just about anything you can
think of. Sure there\'ll be differences from world to world, but the essential
character of the oligarch is there-- so you have the choice of either making
the noble the center of the campaign, or having him do a whole LOT of
roleplaying trying to learn to act like a normal human being without getting
killed, in which case your campaign will look a lot like that Eddie Murphy
flicker about the African prince who lives in NYC for a while, whatever it

Balladeer Light Air Raft TL11

     The Balladeer is a fast light air raft intended for use by individuals.  
An extended seating version is available with the inline roomy seats replaced 
by a two by two cramped seat group, but that variation is not popular. A 
small array of sensors gives some limited all weather capability, but reduced 
speed would be prudent under such circumstances.

Balladeer Light Air Raft Emergency Conversion TL11

     When the planet Nasemin (Spinward Marches/Aramis 3003) was invaded in 
1118 by Vargr corsairs intent on setting up a base rather than plundering, the 
planetary militia was quickly overwhelmed.  In a desperate attempt to provide 
air support for a guerilla counterattack on the starport, Colonel Nolan Arme-
nax scraped together a squadron of fourteen Balladeers from local air raft 
dealers and armed them with his limited supply of Pronghorn drone missiles 
salvaged from a destroyed defense installation.  Defending Vargr pilots were 
initially surprised by the use of these civilian craft still in their colorful 
showroom paint schemes, and two combat pinnaces were destroyed before the 
Vargr were able to respond.  All fourteen Balladeers were lost, but the cor-
sairs abandoned their downside base rather than face the anticipated level of 
guerilla activity.

           wings, and the speed was reduced as a result of the drag.  The 
           cargo compartment was left empty to compensate for the weight of 
           the missiles.  The missiles had no oxygen tanks and could not
           reach orbit, but were adequate for short range atmospheric combat.

Pronghorn Drone Missile TL11

     The Pronghorn drone missile is intended for fairly short range atmos-
pheric combat, although it can be adapted for vacuum use with an oxygen tank.  
It is not particularly smart, and would ordinarily be used with a launch 
vehicle with a more capable sensor system.  Once a target is pointed out to 
the missile, it can use its own sensors to maintain a track on it, even 
through violent maneuvering.  With a usable atmospheric acceleration of 6 
G\'s, specialized atmospheric craft may be able to outmaneuver a Pronghorn 
temporarily, but very few could continue to do so for the full 160 hour 
endurance of the missile.  If a target does manage to distract the missile, 
it can be programmed to self destruct or to return to base to be used again.
     TL12 and TL13 versions of this missile are available, at discounted 
costs of Cr31800 and Cr32100 respectively.  The TL12 version has a slightly 
improved brain with Intelligence of 2 and a skill of GravVehicle-3.  The TL13 
version has intelligence 3, GravVehicle-4, and a warhead with a penetration 
of 67 rather than 65.

Prince Norman class Light Cruiser TL12

     The three vessels of the Prince Norman class were built by the planetary 
navy of Bendor between 1107 and 1112 to replace three Aganar class light 
cruisers obtained from the Imperial Glisten Navy.  Obtaining parts for the 
aging Aganars was becoming difficult, and the planetary government finally 
approved the construction of the Prince Normans, a replacement plan which 
used local resources and provided a large number of jobs for the planet\'s 
shipbuilding industry, which was suffering somewhat as a result of the war.
     The Prince Norman and its sisters are typical of front line military 
equipment at this tech level, and closely resemble cruisers seen in Vargr and 
other planetary navies.

Mauritius class Bulk Freighter TL12

     The Mauritius class bulk freighter is designed to serve a cluster of 
civilized worlds.  It is not intended for planetary landings and is therefore 
dependent on the existence of orbital freight transfer facilities.  The basic 
operational pattern for a Mauritius is to dock, take on a load of unrefined 
fuel, process the fuel while unloading, load, and then make a leisurely 
transit to the safe distance to jump to the next port.  Fifteen triple beam 
laser turrets organized into three batteries constitute a reasonable deter-
rent to potential pirates. The total cargo capacity amounts to 7000 displace-
ment tons, with the preferred loading schemes involving either 700 ten ton 
cargo containers or 1750 four ton containers.

Redspike class System Defense Boat TL9 

     The Redspike class takes its name from a spectacular flower of Trin, and 
is a standard SDB design dating back centuries.  Not all systems follow the 
convention of naming these vessels after flowers.  The Redspike exhibits no 
unusual design features.  It is a typical TL9 design, arranged as a tail-
stander due to the lack of artificial gravity.

OOPS!  Made an error...
the 1 ton 1 meter radius gyro has an energy of 1409.9 ktons (sorry)

Lets try a .1 meter gyro with a mass of 1 kg?
Well, that\'s much nicer... only 282 kg of TNT!

Centripetal acceleration at rim of gyro:  394.8 billion G\'s

Formula: 0.5*m*(2*r*Pi*1,000,000)^2
	---- = energy of gyro in kilotons
	1.4*10^13

Centripital Acceleration
Formula: (2*r*Pi*1,000,000)^2
	----
		r
Where m is the mass of the gyro, the r is the radius.

Now, your going to turn a Battle ship with a 1 kilo gyro, and simultaneously
place a 282kg bomb at the center of the spinal mount, right alongside
the main structural members of the ship?

Frankly, the engineering problems of a gyro are much MUCH greater than the
possible computer control problems of balancing thrusters in such a manner
so that when you release the controls, an auto de-spin program runs to
stop your rotation.

Even the computer monitoring systems necessary for a gyro would dwarf the
computer systems needed to calculate the ship\'s torque and put a minus sign
in front of it!

Actually, one could get a better result out of a gyro, by decreasing
revolutions and increasing the mass of the gyro.  But still you are
going to end up with a ship that will "wallow like a garbage scow next to
a warp driven starship..."

Think about the torque to turn a battleship, Approx 1,350,000 metric tons
of mass, with a lever arm of .1 meters...
lets say we have a spherical battleship 10 meters in diameter (a rediculously
small number we are after order of magnatude here...)

Thus, to rotate the ship at one meter per second we need to exert a force on the
gyro of 135,000,000 neutons (the equivalent weight of 13,500,000 metric tons)
with that same force, you could move the same mass at 10 G\'s.

Sorry Folks, unless you use a physics nullifier, it\'s no good.

	The Subsidiary of GSBag:  C&P Ltd has a longer history

Headquarters was moved to Capitol, where they continued to build
their series of trainer ships and vehicles.  Cessna & Piper Ltd
has millenia of experience in the field of trainer design.
	Recently, the demand for new trainers has decreased due to
the fact that there are many many such craft still in service. 
The market is full, and while the demand for such craft is
strong, the economic factors come in.  Who will buy a Cessna
Model 15-0, built in 1121 when one built in 1102 can be bought
for substantially less?
	The ship normally does not carry cargo, but it can carry a
substantial amount if so desired.  Many models have had their
cargo bays modified with staterooms in its place.
	The Cessna is a tail sitter, this combined with the 1G
engines make the inertial compensators unnecessary.
	Two pilot\'s stations are installed.  Either one can take
full control of the ship.  The ship could be said to have an
auxillury bridge, were the pilots not side by side.
	Probably half the private pilots in the Imperium, and more
than a few military pilots first soloed in a C&P 15-0.

I had the rare occasion to talk to Gary Thomas this week.  I mentioned
some of the TML discussions lately, and the nobility topic in particular
interested him.  I thought I\'d paraphrase a little of his personal
interpretation of Social Standing in Traveller.

Gary said that he always felt Social Standing was *always* a relative,
not absolute, measure.  He also suggested that Social Standing is
volatile (always changing) depending upon its scope of recognition and
where it is being applied.

That is, an Earl could be the Earl of Duckburg, or the Earl of Regina
Subsector.  In fact, in Traveller Digest #4 he said he wrote an
adventure about a Marquis that tended to overstate his importance,
leading to some comedy.  Or maybe back in the lineage of the character,
there was a very influential ancestor (Duke of a Sector) and over the
generations it has been whittled down to next-to-nothing, but the title
"Duke" still exists.

Consider the Governor of the State of New York (Soc up there somewhere).
In Buffalo, he\'s going to paid a lot of attention (Soc = ~D).  If he\'s
in Paris, he\'s for all practicable purposes just another tourist Kilroy,
and his influence probably depends on how much money he has, how he
dresses and talks (Soc = ~5).  Vargr are an even more volatile example
of the same changing degree of social recognition.

How important is the TML Admin title regarded on the TML (Soc = F)? In a
USENET newsgroup for mail admin discussion (Soc = 8)? At a local
restaurant (Soc = 5)?

So, I\'d guess that the Referee and player ought to come to agreement on
how to interpret a character of high Social Standing.  It means they are
influential, but the influence is limited to something appropriate for
game purposes.  Outside of their sphere of influence, their Social
Standing is practicably moderate to low.

I\'d also guess that the player has a degree of leeway as to their
character\'s personality, whether it be an isolated, concieted blueblood,
or a practical, down-to-earth, gun-toting Earl of Kearney from Britain
on Terra.

As always, Traveller is a guidebook, not a rulebook.  In their own
games, Referees have a local Social Standing equal to The Almighty, and
players that of Demigods.  :-)

Megatraveller set is suddenly something I can actually use.
   Concerning nobles, in my campaign they stand as something of a cross
between the United States Senator (representing the planet to the Imperium)
and the French prefect (representing the Imperium to the planet).  The
advantage of this is that both the Imperium and the planet can (and
probably would like to) operate without the noble intermediary, and thus
although the noble\'s title is hereditary, his power is based in large part on
personal effort.  Thus on one planet the baron may be a recluse who
stays in orbit most of the time and whose minnions are only seen when there is
piracy to be battled, while in another the noble may have managed to become
the ruler of the planetary government, while another might be a frightened
weakling willing to play nice with the local megacorp officials in exchange
for a sumptuous lifestyle, and yet another (say, in the pre-rebellion Solomani
Rim) may be the direct executor of Imperial authority over the populace.
   A player-noble in my milieu _ALWAYS_ starts out as an heir.  They are also,
coincidentally, always involved in a succession conflict, as this leads to
fun play and make loyal followers (other players) indispensable to the
noble PC.  I see nothing wrong with a PC being an heir sewing his wild oats.
I always pictured the Navy officer corps as the place where the children of the
gentry learn discipline and skill (replacing squiredom and knighthood, perhaps)
and a little Travelling might be seen as teaching self-reliance.
   As for fears that the heir might be considered so valuable that he would
never be allowed to Travel, I assume that the more noble families keep there
nurseries well stocked for just such a purpose.  The world of traveller, unlike
that of Dune, for example, seems to have no big qualms about artificial
conception making one child families such as the Atredies not only unnecessary
but downright unwise.  In other words, munch all you want, we\'ll make more!
   Once bonnie prince mercenary inherits, of course, the campaign MUST be
transformed.  For me, this is no problem.  My players were getting tired of
the worms-eye-view of the universe anyway, and were glad to hit the big
leagues.  And there\'s still plenty of adventure to be had, even in a non-
rebellion setting.  The Travellers have simply become there own patrons.
And a former merchant, now become a Count\'s chancellor, can use those trade &
commerce rules like nobody\'s business.  And for the especially ambitious there
is always the way of Dulinor (the years of secrecy and planning leading to
an attempt like his would make great play), and in the time of the Rebellion
the situation is wide open.

   An alternative, for those who wish to keep the traveller\'s relatively
poor and desperate, could be the Pendragon(tm) Noble\'s book approach, which
is twofold:  the new noble becomes GM (and occasional patron) of the others
(the former GM getting a rest) until that noble\'s child comes of age.  This is,
of course, only suitable for adventures on a pretty sweeping time-scale.

Remarks:  The Adda Dubsar was a Kinunir class cruiser first laid
down in 292-1087.  The ship was ordered scrapped in 1087, and the
ship lay rusting as an animal habitat in General Shipyards scrap
heap until Oberlindes lines began showing an interest in the
completed hull in 1105.
	In 1106 Oberlindes made a bid of 1 million Cr for the
scrapped hulk.  The offer was taken as General had no plans for
the hulk.  The 63 MCr hull was then referbished as a merchant
ship.  Some of its fuel tanks were converted into cargo capacity,
but if left empty of cargo can easily be filled with fuel for an
additional 4167Kl of fuel.  This can increase the range of the
ship to 2 jump-3+43 days endurance.
	The cruiser is armed as most of Oberlindes Lines ships are,
but its armament has never been tried in combat.  It seems that,
faced with an Imperial cruiser, most corsairs tend to run. 
Though there has been a case where the Imperial Cruiser Luuru was
attacked by a lone corsair.  It seems that they mistook the Luuru
for the Adda Dubsar.

Classified:  Since this incident, all Kinunir class cruisers have
had their transponders adjusted so that they may broadcast that
of the Adda Dubsar.  Oberlindes Lines obtained a profitable
freight contract from the Navy in exchange for permission to use
the Adda Dubsar\'s code.  In the bargain the Adda Dubsar has
permission to use the code of the Imperial Colonial Cruiser
Agidda.  (The code is slightly modified for proper identification
to Naval Vessels).  The Adda Dubsar\'s freight contract calls for
it to only call upon systems with Naval Bases, thus appearing to
suppliment the Naval forces in the area.  The ship lands at the
base and has it\'s cargo delivered there.  Thus no one knows of
the merchant\'s true presence.

The MegaTrav plans to the Kinunir class are in Challenge 38 p28

Regina/Spinward Marches							190-1121
The Imperial Scout Service has grounded all Type S scouts
manufactured by General Shipyards.  All ships are to have their
spaceworthiness certificate removed and placed in the custody of
Starport Control wherever they may be.  Scouts have been found to
have been constructed with substandard hull materials.
	This hull deficiency has resulted in a 2% increase in cancer
in ship crews due to radiation exposure.  Gas giant
skimming has caused hull failures in many ships after repeated
exposure to pressures.  The armor has been found to be
substandard in its ability to withstand damage in combat.  The
hull will not stand up to it\'s rated depth of 495 meters of water
at 1G and has been known to collapse if taken to that depth
repeatedly.
	The numbers of the affected scouts is not known.  But serial
numbers are being analyzed by personnel from the Scout Service.
	Dr. Hloch, a naval architect for the Scout Service has
stated that the hull defects were found by modelling the ships
stated top acceleration of 3G\'s against known structural Scout
models.  The Scout ships in question are much lighter than any
Scout has a right to be.  In addition, the added acceleration has
been known to cause buckling in the hulls plates.

Regina/Spinward Marches							190-1121
A spokesneut for General Shipyards denied all responsibility for
the grounding of the Scout ships of their manufacture. They
claimed that the Scout hulls were manufactured by the
subcontractor:  Spinward Superdense, and that the sole
responsibility for the hull warrenty is their problem.  Ship
owners are directed to Spinward Superdense for recompense for the
grounding of their ships.  Spinward Superdense could not be
contacted for comment, but it was found that the company filed
for bankruptcy five hours before the official notice went out
grounding the Scout ships.

Regina/Spinward Marches							191-1121
An unidentified source in the Scout Service has said that there
have been talks at high levels concerning the purchase of the
substandard Scouts produced by General/Spinward Superdense at
1/10th manufacturing cost for use as spares by the Scout Service.

These rumors were denied by a spokesvargr for the Scout Service.

I wonder how long General Shipyards will remain in business?  After this
incident, and their participation in the Kinunir class (four ships, none
satisfactory), if I were in charge of Naval procurement I\'d refuse to
have anything to do with them.  Does the president of G.S. have high-ranking
connections?  (Such as a brother in Sirius Cybernetics.)

Perhaps General Shipyards were responsible for the Type S scout/courier whose
deck plans appeared in Supplement 7, Traders and Gunboats, in the Classic
Traveller series.  Those plans were lacking a few minor details, such as
computer and power plant.

    'body' => '  A little background: This is the first installment of a series longer than
I dare think about:) containing MegaTraveller weapons redone in 3G and converted
to MegaTraveller. 
  One thing that should be expected is that the penetration figures will be
superior for high-powered weapons, which I hope will offset the \'My weapon
won\'t penetrate my own armor\' syndrome.

  On the conversion: I arrived at the penetration figures by computing the 
thickness of armor quality steel that a certain weapon should penetrate and 
then converting this to MegaTraveller penetration by using the table in Striker.
(The amount of armor plate steel that a certain armor factor represents is
 equal to the weight and price mod of that armor factor as found in point 9,
 Refs Handbook, page 63. In Striker that table had the heading cm where it now
 has \'mod\' but the article on radiation in TD#14 (?) supports that it still
 means cm.
 The penetrations in DV are randomly determines, and I have based the MegaT
 penetration figures on 1/3rd between exact average and the maximum, to 
 reflect that the weapon often should penetrate this armor factor.)

  The Table below lists what 3G Damage Value the various armor values
correspond to:

   Ironmongery: The weapons below has been done for each of the TLs where they
appear. I have assumed that a certain technology (for example cased rounds as
opposed caseless ammo) will linger on for one TL after the new technology has
appeared. Certain TL\'s are duplicated in 3G (for example, MegaT TL 7 and 8 are
both represented by the 3G TL 11) and won\'t be included.

  The data given are the standard MegaTraveller data for weapons, plus lenght,
weight and price (Prc) figures. I assume that 1kg is equal to 1liter in volume.
The weights given for the weapons are without ammunition and clips, but 
revolvers include the weight of the drum, but not the individual rounds.

  Data on separate drums are given if additional drums are to be purchased.

  Ammunition data are for the various different types. \'Lead\' is standard
jacketed lead projectiles. \'AP\' is solid steel armor piercing rounds. 
\'DS\' is sub calibre discarding sabot rounds, \'APDS\' is the latter combined with
a solid steel or tungsten core. \'HP\' is hollow point soft/nosed bullets.

  Additional data after price is data that is not normally used in the 
standard MegaTraveller combat system. I\'ll get back to this in an subsequent
installment.

  Ammunition is *not* compatible across TL lines, and most probably not between
systems either. Standaridized weapons *of a certain TL* that are compatible
between systems can be bought for 1.5 the cost at the large outlets for 
Interstellarms or similar companies, or at 3 times the cost if bought at
the starport shops. 

  This first installment includes 5mm, 7mm, 9mm, and 9mm Magnum revolvers for
the TLs 5-9. I have assumed that a caseless revolver is a silly idea, so
no revolver designs for TLs above 9 will be forthcoming. If anyone disagrees
with this: mail me.

  Comments are always welcome.

I just checked BTRC\'s TimeLords game to see what kind of values they assign
to personal armor.  The best currently available personal armor runs about 
AV40--which means that our basic \'cloth\' armor ought to be a 2, military
cloth a 3, and a flak jacket a 1...using numbers like that would make things
a little more reasonable for the machine gunners, don\'t you think?

At those sorts of numbers, a TL10 combat environment suit might be worth
a 3 or a 4, a set of early combat armor worth a 5, and a set of TL15
battledress worth maybe 7 or 8.

  Well, either method should be ok, but I wouldn\'t use them togeather, because
I was forced to up the powder load in some pistol shells to reach the stated
minimum penetration (according to Vanilla MegaT). The trouble with changing the
armors is that it is hard to predict what armor value the various hitech ones
would get, since we don\'t have any 3A (Armors! Armors! Armors!) :)

  I think that the relation between the MegaT armors and the \'Machinetools\'
guns are close to what I think is realism: All variants of the 9mm and heavier
revolvers will penetrate heavy cloathing (jack and mesh) but will be stopped
by a flak jacket (factor 3). AP rounds will penetrate a flak jacket but will
be stopped by cloth (factor 5) which I\'ve always interpreted as roughly
equivalent to modern body armors with cheramic plates inlayed.

  The TL9 magnum will penetrate that with DS or APDS rounds, but I\'m not aware
of *any* modern revolver or pistol round that use discarding sabots (but there
might be, since I havent read the Janes Infantry Weapons for a number of years:(

weapons (read guns);

1)  Why do so many reasonably educated people always assume that our present
level of knowledge in physics is true and correct in every way?  Did we
develop a unified field theory while I was asleep last semester?  Has \'God\'
told us that we have achieved perfection?  Hmmm?

Point being, you are all treating Conservation of Energy as Gospel.  It may be
true under all conditions (actually, we suspect that it is not.  According to
Hawking\'s speculations about naked singularities, conservation of energy 
does not apply in their vicinity), but that is not really any more likely 
than that Einstein\'s Theories will stand the test of time (note that it\'s 
predecessor failed the test of time - it turned out to be a special case). 
Why couldn\'t CofE be a special case?
And why can\'t the excess energy needed to make your numbers come out right
come from Superspace, or be extracted from the Universal gravitational field,
or something equally unlikely.  We (or at least I) don\'t know the limit of the
possible, so why not assume that MT maneuver drives work as described?

As to the problems in maintaining MT\'s pretty picture, we (my wife and I) have
been fiddling with that problem for years (since Traveller came out).  Almost
NONE of the MT picture makes sense without being massaged with a club.  The
"conquest" of Glisten is ludicrous.  The assumption that there is any
limitation on fuel availability is almost equally so.  
Remember that MT is supposed to be \'space opera\', not hard scifi.  If you want
hard scifi, use 2300AD, or create your own universe.  Stop trying to bludgeon
MT to make it fit.

2) Kinetic kill weapons are wonderfully lethal things, aren\'t they?  Their use
against planets is restricted by the following: 

  a)  planets have bigger and better sensor nets than ships can have (unless
the ships are the size of the Skylark of Valeron or DQ).  They almost
certainly maintain a sky-watch to locate and neutralize such things.  After
all, a dinosaur killer can be an accident, much less an attack.

  b)  ALL major bodies ( > 10meters diameter) should be located and monitored
for orbital changes.  It helps with traffic control in those busy systems
anyway, and keeps loons from bombing you into the stone age, eh?

  c)  planetary defenses can deal with these things to a certain extent.  If a
rock moving 0.1c is located at the edge of the system (it probably is not TOO
much closer than that - it takes 5,625,000,000Km to go from 0.05c to 0.1 c at
6Gs), the defense force has over 5 hours to react.  Plenty of time to
intercept (your ships can move 9,000,000+Km in that time), or just eliminate
with a meson gun or nuke.

Yes, yes.  The energy will still be there, and it will still hit the
atmosphere as hot plasma.  life is tough all over.  That\'s why the defense
force gets paid the big bucks.  To stop this before it gets out of hand.

Yes, kinetic kill weapons can be used against planets.  If you assume good
planetary sensors, then the ship launching them will be spotted looong before
it gets up to speed.  It should be destroyed soon after (still long before it
gets to speed).  And if the launcher starts from out in the deep dark, it
better aim real well now, hadn\'t it?  not much mid-course correction available
on a rock.and a miss by 3 meters is just as good as no launch at all.




Let\'s try a new thread.  We have been trying to determine the effect that
densitometers have on a high TL battlefield.  According to MT, artificial grav
stands out like a sore thumb on a densitometer.  So what allows anyone to use
grav vehicles, when they can be detected and eliminated by a
densitometer/meson gun combo on the other side of the planet?  Why doesn\'t
everyone use tracks/wheels/air-cushions?  Any ideas?  Any design philosophies
for vehicles and military forces that take neutrino detectors/densitometers
into account?

  As before, the weight and cost for the clip don\'t include ammunition, and the
gun does include the weight or cost for the clip either. I am assuming that 
AP ammo for small arms appear at TL6, DS and APDS at TL9.

  On the funny numbers: Fail is the percentage chance that something other than
what the user thinks will happen happens when the trigger is pulled. \'In\' is the
modifyer applied to the tactics points pool for that person only when 
determining who shoots first (aka \'Initiative\'). \'A\' is the armor value of the
gun and \'I/D\' is the incapacitated/destroyed hits levels for the gun.
  They are ofcourse highly optional.

  I assume that silencers for bodypistols weigh and cost as much as the gun 
itself. The price of the bodypistols has got an extra 2x multiplier to reflect
that they are constructed to be hard to detect.

Automatic Pistol 9mm Caseless

  I have assumed that, due to recoil purposes, a loaded weight of 1kg is minimum
for a 9mm automatic pistol. Therefore the TL14 and 15 pistols have extra weights
in them, 105g at TL14 and 230g at TL15 which can be replaced by laser point 
sights, smartgun options, gyros and so on.

Some of us were raised on Classic Traveller, which was supposed to be hard s.f.
(Not "scifi", or you\'ll get flamed by some people who find that term a bit
objectionable!  :-)  We\'d rather like to play MT the same way.  Of course, if

Well, not quite.  To detect the vehicle from the other side of a planet, you
need a high penetration densitometer to be able to see through the planet;
and that only becomes practical at around TL18, when your densitometer can
penetrate 2500km.  Even using one from the other side of a hill might not work
at TL15 (penetration = 1km).  On the other hand, giving your TL15 trooper a
handheld densitometer, sending him to the top of the hill, and using him as a
forward observer for artillery might work, as might using a densitometer from
a great height.

surprised to discover that everyone who answered over there is in agreement:

We are calculating agility wrong...they really do mean the power left over
after all components, including the maneuver drive, are powered.  So, if you
want to have a ship that uses 30MW life support, 250MW of weapons, 120MW
of maneuver and has a high agility...go ahead and put in a 7000MW power plant.

(Makes no sense to me.  Sorry.)

Since this apparently has nothing to do with the maneuver drive (then why
does the maneuver drive limit \'emergency\' agility?) there is no limit on
how much power can be used for agility.


On the same subject:  Some months ago I posted a note to someone who asked
if we should speed space combat up.  At the time I went into a long description
with a lot of math about how small a target was, and what the odds of hitting
it at 50,000km were, given the likely uncertainty in the _exact_ angle of
your fire.  Last week I sat down to see how much of an effect ship movement
would actually have, and was surprised to run through the numbers and discover
this:  If you have a 50m long ship (let\'s assume a sphere for convenience,
other shapes will produce other results, but the principle is the same), and
you shoot at it with _perfect_ aim, agility will help it if it can change its
predicted postion (movement vector) by more than one ship length in the time
it takes for the sensor position to travel back to you and the beam to go out.
At 50m and 6-G acceleration, this critical distance is about 200,000km.  For a
50m, 1G ship it is about 480,000km.  _At this range, you could track the ship
continuously and stay on target if you had perfect fire control_.  What would
this mean in game terms?  Well, it\'s really too late to do anything about it
now, BUT since the uncertainty in firing angle is much more important than
actual ship movement, the use of the attacking computer factor as an add-on
to the attack makes sense.  The use of any sort of defender agility as a
minus to the attack does not, and the use of the defender computer factor to
give a minus on the attack only makes sense if you assume that it represents
some sort of electronic countermeasures aimed at throwing off the attacker\'s
targetting data.  This isn\'t a bad assumption, but it seems to me like it might
only be possible with an active EMS jammer and/or EMM system.

For those wishing to figure other conditions the formula is:

Critical Distance=t*2*300,000km/sec

           ----
          /ship length*2
t= \\    / ----
    \\ /   acceleration

John Higginbotham writes that it would be easy to detect a ship
accelerating to .1c.  Well, It aien\'t that easy.  Consider that
the attacking vessel has to make a long run toward  it\'s target
in order to get up to speed.  Well, You are going to have
to start waaaay out of the system anyway, why not move back into
interstellar space to start your run?

For one there is less junk out there.  Less chance you\'ll hit
a stray micrometeroroid at.1c with disasterous results.  Less
chance of detection.  (at the distances I\'m thinking of your
neutrino smoke will be totally lost in the bacground noise)

Targetting?  Well, with good old TL7 equipment, we managed to
score a close encounter with Neptune... Admittedly, we had
a few mid course corrections, but there weren\'t that many
burns and those were for getting to the next target, not
correcting aim.

As for Conservation of energy.  Steven Hawkings is pretty
much talking about what most of us would consider special
circumstances in the realm of the universe (Inside the
center of a black hole...)
Not having been inside one myself I am afraid I am
prejudiced to think that that is a special case...
	Anyway, Conservation of energy holds up quite nicely
in Newtonian physics.  Newton does hold up for everday
low velocities.   And, (Surprise!) .1C is within the realm of
Newton.  (Relativity doesn\'t kick in substantially till .5C)
	As for mysterious stuff which somehow nullifies
the laws of physics...  I don\'t like \'em, I won\'t use \'em
unless I have to.  (Jump Drives, Grav Drives, Nuc Dampers,
Meson Screens, Psi{I really don\'t like psi})

	The last I heard was that Traveller IS a Hard
Science Fiction game.  (with the above exceptions)  Most of
the game is based on Poul Anderson\'s writings which are
definitely hard science fiction.

This is a suggestion as to a possible way to handle disintegrators under
the \'new\' TDR ship combat system.


Currently disintegrators are basically worthless weapons, they get less
\'free\' hits than meson guns, they are affected by armour, they don\'t get
internal damage hits.  Altogether a pretty poor showing ---- little better
than PAs.  When you also consider that they are expensive, large, heavy and
suck power like nothing else they become totally useless (I won\'t mention the
Jump spinal mounts, they are VERY different to everything else and basically
not worth mentioning in a traditional TL game).

There are several different ways to fix this problem.  Weaken the other spinal
weapons; strengthen the disintegrator weapons; use them to replace PAs at high
TLs rather than replace meson weapons.

Weakening the other weapons seems a bit excessive to me.  Besides, combat
should be really really fatal and quick :-)

Using disintegrators as a PA replacement would be possible if you greatly
lighten the power/volume/weight/price requirements for them to something
comparable to PAs.  Division of all these attributes by 5 or 10 would
bring them back into line but PAs would still be preferable in most
circumstances.

Strengthening a disintegrator is the other way to go.  After some thought and
lots of heat arguments between Eric Halil and myself, we thought of some \'nice\'
ways to improve them.  They have to be pretty much single hits destroy style
weapons to match the large meson guns ---- let a given disintegrator be capable
of totally destroying a given mass of matter on a hit.  That causes ships to
be disintegrated properly and maybe absolutely.  They should also cause major
damage to the ship\'s armour factor because they are physically removing it.
Also, the disintegration of matter is likely to produce quite major radation
effects so increase the number of radation damage rolls (unmodified?) and also
apply some damage rolls to ships that are using the taget as a screen or that
are screening the target (or apply some radation damage hits to all ships in
the same hex as the target).  Finally, disintegration is likely to produce some
impressive quantities of EM radation over the entire spectrum so cause all
EM sensors (passive especially) to be either considered jammed or to suffer a
negative DM on sensor tasks [ this shouldn\'t be too much of a problem on
military ships since EM sensors aren\'t really necessary if you\'ve got
densos and neutrio sensors ].  These sensors would be able to get a very nice
pinpoint upon the ship being hit since it would be a very impressive EM source.
I don\'t think that neutrio sensors or densotometers are going to be gravely
affects by the large scale disintegration of matter around the place.  Could a
more physics orientated person verify these ideas?

The handling of the destruction of portions of the ship could be done:
1) percentage destroyed is the save for each of the major systems.
2) as 1 but also certain systems are destroyed after so many percent damage
	reguardless of saves.
3) percentage degradation of some/all ships systems.

Also, things like the jump grid should always suffer a percentage degratation
as damage is taken (this kind of damage is mentioned in the \'official\' rules
somewhere).

The powers at large in the imperium (GDW) seem to consider disintegrators to
be powerful weapons, so the modified ship combat/design systems should help
out a little.

Future work to be done:
    Formalise these ideas a little bit more, giving damage rolls etc.
    Convert them into something RebelGuard can use.
    Rework the necessary sections of the ship design procedure for the TDR
    vehicle/ship design group.

I\'ll get this done eventually, but it is going to have to wait for a little
while since I\'ve got to devote some time to my work.



Any comments are appreciated.

Perhaps you could ask them what is being used to convert raw power into
agility?  It isn\'t the manoeuvre drive, because that device\'s power is
calculated separately.  In fact, having a large manoeuvre drive will
_decrease_ your agility for a given power plant size!

Well, the MT system tries to avoid doing such calculations in the middle
of a game, probably because it would slow the game down a lot if each
ship kept recalculating its agility every time a weapon fired or someone
did something like the above to the manoeuvre drive.  So they ship specs
just list one agility value.

But, as I said, if you put in a smaller manoeuvre drive in the first place,
you get a higher agility.  This is just from power calculations; the mass
saved by using a smaller drive can be filled with cargo, non-energy weapons
or some other object which doesn\'t consume power, and the ship will still
be more agile than if it had the larger drive.

Either way, the MT method of calculating agility is stupid.

Agreed.  What\'s the point of having a large drive if you can\'t fry someone
with the exhaust, anyway?  :-)

  That only means that this is the way it should be done in MegaTraveller, 
it is not the way it is done in Striker, and it don\'t say anything about TDR:)

  In the old traveller space combat system, you only needed a ECM program to 
start spoofing missiles.

  I suspect that the Passive/Active EMS arrays could be used as the 
sensing/transmitting part of a ECM system if the signal-processing ciruits and
the computer are flexible and fast enough.
  Some years ago I read a introductiory text on electronic warfare and one of
the impressions I got is that most active systems could be done with a wide-
frequency band capable reciever (like the PassiveEMS) and a similarly wide-
frequency band capable strong transmitter.
 
  Fooling Neutrino detectors and Densitometers should be possible by playing
with the powerplant (\'Neutrino-signature of second boogie rapidly increasing,
sir, looks like they are closing fast!\') and the grav-plates.

	The Subsidiary of GSBag:  C&P Ltd has a longer history
than the that of the Imperium.  In 262, the Corporate
Headquarters was moved to Capitol, where they continued to build
their series of trainer ships and vehicles.  Cessna & Piper Ltd
has millenia of experience in the field of trainer design.
	Recently, the demand for new trainers has decreased due to
the fact that there are many many such craft still in service.
The market is full, and while the demand for such craft is
strong, the economic factors come in.  Who will buy a Cessna
Model 15-0, built in 1121 when one built in 1102 can be bought
for substantially less?
	The ship normally does not carry cargo, but it can carry a
substantial amount if so desired.  Many models have had their
cargo bays modified with staterooms in its place.
	The Cessna is a tail sitter, this combined with the 1G
engines make the inertial compensators unnecessary.
	Two pilot\'s stations are installed.  Either one can take
full control of the ship.  The ship could be said to have an
auxillury bridge, were the pilots not side by side.
	The power plant puts out an excess of 50MW for the possible
installation of more sensors, avionics, additional accomodations,
inertial compensators, or even weapons.
	Probably half the private pilots in the Imperium, and more
than a few military pilots first soloed in a C&P 15-0.
	Spins are prohibited below 900m AGL.  Recommended spin
entry:  150kph.  The Avco-Lycoming fusion plant was chosen for
it\'s reliability, having proved itself in many small craft
designs.  Note:  Because of extreme wing loading, stall speed
is somewhere around Mach 1.

    'body' => 'A question:

In classic traveller, the minimum size of a ship was 100 displacement tons.
In High guard the minimum size of a jump capable ship was 100 tons.

Why?

Well, In Book 2 (the original starship design book) the minimum size drives
would have trouble fitting into a smaller hull.  High Guard modified this
making it possible for smaller ships with smaller drives, but they kept the
100 ton rule.

Now in MegaT, we have a system capable of designing things down to the size
of .0005 tons (smaller if you use Book 8 robots)
Anyway, why do we still have the 100 ton rule?  I can see that there is
going to be a minimum size to a jump drive, but why 100 tons?

Now in adventure 4, they mention jump torpedoes.  (no rules on how much they
cost or how far they can jump, but they are there.)  So Jump drives can be
made smaller.

Ah! I hear you say, there\'s no one aboard a jump torpedo!  Life can\'t be sustained in something smaller than 100 tons.  Well, what if you put the same
drive from a 100 ton ship in a smaller ship?  The jump field it projects
should be of the same size, allowing for a bubble in which the occupants
can live while travelling in jump space.  Why 100 tons?

Ok, the reason I am asking is the Cessna Jump trainer design I put out
for your amusement.  More than 60% is cargo space.  (frankly I didn\'t
want cargo space, but the rules made it so.)  That 60% is essentually
wasted volume.  The whole ship would fit into a 40 ton package.  So,
why do I have to use the 100 ton min?

I realize that small jump capable ships have limited utility, but I wanted
the Cessna to be CHEAP!  If I didn\'t have to get a maneuver drive for a
100 ton ship, and the associated power plant it would be much cheaper.

How many people would scream if the rule was ammended to be such
that the minimum size jump drive is that given in the book for the 100
ton ship, but the actual ship may be smaller?  To keep such things in
balance we could say that the min size drive remains the same per jump
number.  thus

Jump #	Min Size
1	27Kl
2	40.5Kl
3	54Kl
4	67.5Kl
5	81Kl
6	94.5Kl

Actually, there\'s all sorts of neat tricks you can play in 2300AD that
violate current physics; their numbers for stutterwarp drives (for example)
violate conservation of energy in a big way.

Why, you ask?

First, for you non-2300 types, the stutterwarp drive is a strange hyperspace
drive. It cycles about 100,000 times per second, and each cycle creates an
instantaneous jump from one point in space to another, thousands of meters
apart, without crossing the intervening space. The net effect is Faster Than
Light travel. However, the velocity vector of the ship in realspace is
completely unaffected by this travel. If you are in orbit about a planet in
one system, and stutterwarp over to the other system, you arrive with your
original vector unchanged (making orbital maneuvers intersting... :-)

The stutterwarp effect is drastically reduced inside the .01G barrier of a
gravity well, so FTL travel within a system is not possible. However, you
can still make good time using stutterwarp instead of reaction drives within
a system. The drawback is that the materials to build stutterwarp drives are
extremely rare, thus the drives are prohibitively expensive. There are only
a few thousand starships in existence in 2300AD, and they\'re all o/o by the
military or large governments/organizations. (btw, this is the real reason
for using organizations in 2300AD; it\'s the only way to get access to a
starship without paying commercial rates).

Anyway: most starships don\'t have maneuver drives. To change your velocity
vector, you stutterwarp to an appropriate point in a gravity well, and then
\'fall\' until you reach your desired velocity. This requires computers (and a
skilled ship\'s pilot, which is why we invented the Pilot crew position which
is missing from the rules). This also led us to think about other things you
can do with gravity wells...

- - There\'s a really neat power generator using stutterwarp: hang a stutterwarp
  drive, inside a large magnet, inside a large wire coil, inside of a gravity
  well. stutterwarp away from the planet, then fall towards the planet. While
  moving towards the planet, the interaction between the magnet and the coil
  agenerates electricity, which also slows you down again. However, you get
  more energy out of the system than you put in, using current
  electromagnetic generator efficiencies and 2300AD stutterwarp energy
  costs. Perpetual motion, anyone?

- - There\'s also a really neat doomsday device using the same principle. Hang a
  stutterwarp drive in a gravity well. stutterwarp up, fall down. You can
  very quickly get your realspace velocity vector up to large fractions of
  c. Then, turn of the stutterwarp. You impact the surface of the planet...


Anyway, my real point is, don\'t go calling 2300AD "Hard Science". It breaks
just as many current phyiscs rules as MT does...

Don\'t forget that the very concept of FTL travel produces all sorts of
contradictions, without even having to consider numerical values for
generator efficiencies and stutterwarp energy costs.  The thing is,
FTL travel is almost an essential "gimme", unless you want to confine
yourself to one planet and its in-system neighbors.  As far as I can
tell, games that do that turn out to be cyberpunk.  2300 has fewer
gimmes than MT.  As a computer-science type, I take exception to GDW\'s
concept of computer abilities and costs in 2300, but that\'s not too
hard to fix.  When I eventually return to MT, I hope to be able to
excise a lot of stuff, like psionics and disintegrators and black
globes and maybe even anti-gravity, BUT . . . it\'ll be a lot of work,
which is one of the reasons that I prefer 2300 for the time being.

OK.  Stupid questions department, and I would appreciate  knowing 
whether any answers are official.  I\'ve had this discussion  with 
various people on  the Internet Traveller Mailing List.

How do I calculate agility?  If I have a ship with a 100MW  power 
plant, a drive that uses 60MW, 5MW of parasitic power  (controls, 
etc.)  and  30MW of life support, with no weapons (just  to  keep 
discussion simple) how much power do I use in the agility  calcu-
lation?

Preferred  answers on the TML are 5MW (what\'s left  after  every-
thing else is powered), 65MW (what\'s left after everything except 
the  maneuver drive is powered), and 60MW (the maximum  input  to 
the drive, regardless of any 5MW of left over power).

MY opinion is 60...but I could be wrong.

 Rob,

    Hmmmmm....   I had a rather long and heated  discussion/argu-
ment  with Joe about this type of a topic a couple years ago.   I 
was  holding  that Agility should be limited by manuever,  but  I 
lost  (temporarily, anyway).  The major difference  between  High 
Guard  and MT is that Agility and Manuever are no longer  related 
AT ALL.  Your ability to manuever doesn\'t affect your agility, or 
vice versa.  The old disengagement rules made no sense when  they 
were  written, let alone now: you disengage by running away  from 
the  enemy,  not  by turning tight circles.   If  you\'re  turning 
faster than I am, but I\'m faster, you can only get away IF I lose 
contact with you.

    Now, if you WANT to chop your manuever capability to increase 
your agility, that\'s fine, but excess power means what\'s said  in 
the  last sentence: "Excess power is the powerleft over from  the 
power  plant  after  all the crafts other  components  have  been 
powered."  Looks clear enough to me.

    Where did you get that "when the ship is in emergency status, 
the ship suddenly goes to agility=2"?  I can\'t find anything that 
suggests that result.

    "Double-Dipping" makes sense and would be legal as I read the 
rules:  nothing  prevents you from parceling  out  the  available 
power  in whatever manner you see fit, AS LONG AS YOU  DON\'T  USE 
THE SAME MW IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE. After all, that\'s like getting
something for nothing.....

 Where  I  come  from (-8, when it says "after  all  the  craft\'s 
_other_"  components have been powered", I have to  wonder--Other 
than what?  Given that on p.94 right column of my printing of the 
Ref\'s Manual the Emergency Agility rule says that I can cut power 
to  my  weapons and gain an agility equal to  my  manuever  drive 
rating, I was left with the impression that agility had something 
to do with maneuver. (-8

As  someone who cut my teeth on vector movement  in  Triplanetary 
(in  1976), I _know_ that a rotating ship is a ballistic, not  an 
evading, target, so I reject the current \'explanation\' for agili-
ty  the same way I reject the maneuver rule that says that I  can 
move any number of hexes up to my current speed or circle in  the 
same  hex.  Give me a break... we have to accept a  few  \'Physics 
Nullifiers\' (tm) to play this game, but not that one. Anyway,  by 
the rules I have, what Scott says is true.  If I have a  merchant 
ship  with no weapons, I can  declare an emergency agility  equal 
to my maneuver rating, which has nothing to do with breaking  off 
under the current hex grid combat rules.

I  have no strong objection to going off in my own little  corner 
and  playing the way I like, but I hate to see things  like  this 
crop  up  in what is supposed to be a (generally)  reality  based 
game.

                       AGILITY

    [This discussion took place prior to the development of SoPM1 
and therefore, there might be some conflict with the presumptions 
made  here that haven\'t been fully analyzed in relation  to  that 
book, though some updating has been attempted].

    When  Megatraveller  came  out, a change in  the  ship  rules 
occurred  concerning  maneuver  drives and  the  ship\'s  agility.  
Previous  to MT, these two abilities tended to  intertwine  (i.e. 
there  was  a  strong relationship between a  ship\'s  ability  to 
maneuver  and it\'s ability to dodge, reflected by it\'s  agility).  
In MT ship design this connectivity between the two now no longer 
occurs,  a  ship\'s agility has no relationship to  it\'s  maneuver 
drive.

    This  alteration tended to cause some initial  concern  among 
designer\'s  since reasoning tended to reside with the  idea  that 
agility and ability to maneuver should be intertwined.

    A  way around this problem was given by considering  the  way 
maneuver drives worked and how agility works and then considering 
inertial compensators as a possible solution.

    According to SoPM1 inertial compensators are directed by  the 
main  computer  in response to normal ship  inertia  from  moving 
about  and maneuvering.  Inertial compensators that are  involved 
in this process are initially available at TL 10.

    When one looks at the effect of maneuver drives installed  on 
a  vessel one notices that the mass of the ship has no effect  on 
the  drives  ability to propel the vessel, this is of  course  an 
advantage  of using either gravitic or thruster technology.   Now 
taking a look at the design of a ship\'s agility, the ship\'s  mass 
plays an important role here, therefore the heavier the ship  the 
less agility it tended to display (can\'t go below zero though).

    Taking  these things into account a theory occured  that  as-
sumed  that  a more primitive form of  inertial  compensators  is 
built  into  the ships as part of the maneuver  drives  and  hull 
structural  members.  These inertial compensators are  simple  in 
design  and are available at TL9 (in actuality the major  differ-
ence between the TL9 and TL10 compensators is the computer  elec-
tronics and the fine tuning necessary, requiring that environmen-
tal  compensators  be built through the entire ship where  it  is 
needed to protect the crew and cargo).

    These  structural  compensators  have a  limited  ability  to 
negate the
mass  of a vessel while trying to use agility however because  of 
insufficient power levels for the basic unit.  By increasing  the 
power  however, added ability to move in different directions  is 
added,  thus increasing the vessel\'s "agility".  This does  cause 
more  stress to the vessels structure however and makes  it  more 
difficult for the Environmental compensators to dampen the maneu-
vers involved.

    Inertial compensators still have a limit as to their  ability 
to  negate mass, and when this is exceeded (which does not  occur 
under  normal speed and mass considerations that occur with  cur-
rent ship design, this is also why maneuver 6 cannot be exceeded, 
as  at  that point you would need to  continually  overdrive  the 
structural  inertial  compensators and thus burn them  out),  one 
needs  to  apply  more power, therefore you still  run  into  the 
lightspeed problem (needing infinite energy to move the  infinite 
mass essentially).

    In  an  actual emergency situation, a vessel  could  jury-rig 
controls  bypassing the normal energy conduits and feeding  extra 
power into the compensators (always presuming the ship had enough 
power that could be diverted from other uses).

    To jury-rig a bypass,
    Difficult, 10 minutes, Engineering, Education, Hazardous

    Bypassing  involves  the transfer of power  from  one  source  
(such  as a weapons system, life support system,  staterooms,  or 
similar system) to another.

Bolt Action Rifle 7mm

   This is the type of rifles that were common in the Terran armies during 
first and second World War. Typical examples are the Springfield 1903, the 
KAR-98K and the Nagant M1891/30. They were replaced somewhat by semi 
automatics just before, during or after WWII, but kept hanging on as civilian 
hunting rifles. All these rifles uses clips of 5 rounds, but internal magazines
are not uncommon in early military rifles or civilian weapons.

Rifle 7mm

   These weapons are the approximate equivalents of fairly modern semi-
automatic battle rifles like the semi-auto version of the Fabrique Nationals 
FAL. They fire 7mm 8g bullets at approximately 850m/s. The TL9 APDS is a 2mm 
steel penetrator that is fired at 1500m/s due to it\'s low total weight. All 
designs of TL8 and above are bullpups.

Rifle 7mm Caseless

   I\'m not aware of any contemportary semi-auto caseless weapon, but it would 
be madness to keep using the same old technology on higher TL\'s. All these are 
bullpup designs. TL10+ designs are gyrostabilized and the internal batteries 
can run they gyros continiously for 4 hours. The TL13 version has 280g of dead 
weight due to recoil purposes. This can be replaced with target designators, 
smartgun electronics, and so on.
   (A really strange type of ammunition would be a HPDS, ie a discarding sabot 
round where the thin core is designed to splinter inside the target. I\'m not 
certain, but it seems legal (ruleswise) to me, but it is probably very illegal 
(lawwise). For a 7mm rifle, a HPDS would have a Pen/Att of 4/2 and inflict 4 
points of damage. It costs 4.5 times as much as a lead round and weighs as a 
DS)

   Medium-heavy hunting rifles. They fire either a 9mm 17g bullet at 820m/s or

counterpart to these either, perhaps some heavy sniper rifle:( but they are in

Rifle 9mm Caseless

   Caseless versions of the above. All are bullpup and the TL10+ versions are 
gyrostabilized. The high recoil force the TL12 version to have 520g and the 
TL13 version to have 1240g of dead weight.
   (As an example, a TL13 smartgun sensor that fits well inside the TL13 9mm 
Caseless rifle will give a +4 to hit against moving objects out to 820m, +2 
out to 1640m and cost 230 Cr)

Remarks:	The standard K\'kree merchant as found in alien module 2
and described extensivly in challenge 28.
	The ship is owned and operated by a merchant family.  The
command, maintainance, steward crews are normally considered
\'passengers\'.
	In the Two Tousand Worlds freight charges are 10 times
normal, because of the huge operating costs just to transport
550Kl of cargo.
	There are five engineering robots (Master +4 slaves as found
in 101 Robots) in the crew (counted above reducing the organic
engineering crew to 10.
	Note that there are no \'staterooms\' as there is only
one communal room for the entire crew.  An allowance of 648Kl is
made for each K\'kree aboard at a cost of .8Mcr (Twice the cost of
a normal stateroom and 12 times the size.   Fuel purification
takes 2 standard K\'Kree days.  The ship is not normally armed,
but there is sufficient power and controls set aside for 12
turrets of triple beam variety.  Any mix is possible, but that is
the maximum allowed.

Black Globes, and Ships and Ceiling Wax and Cabbages and Kings.

	The wind rose in a freezing scream that chilled even through
their battle dress as Boer and Zdeldi leapfrogged under cover up
the side of the mountain	toward the rising white tornado that
emminated from the valley on the other side.  The plume rose
hundreds of kilometers into the sky of Tool\'s World in a gigantic
mushroom cloud.
	Boer was the first to reach the summit and he crawled the
last meter to prevent being sillouhetted at the mountain crest. 
Zdeldi watched as the familliar Zhodani battle dress froze
scanning the valley below.  "What is it?" he growled.  The Aslan
from Darrian crawled the interveneing space and turned his battle
dress sensors on the jetting white plume.
	Infra red signature was cold.  Really cold.  The plume read
out as a stream of liquid air vaporizing as it screamed up toward
orbit.  Zdeldi scanned for the source of the jet but could detect
nothing.  It rose as a perfectly round plume from the valley
below.
	"Hloch, are you getting this?" called Boer over their
scrambled circuit.
	In the G-Carrier, Hloch examined the pictures relayed by the
teams sensors, "Clear view, suggest you attempt psionic
penetration."
	Zdeldi reflected on the fortune of serving in the Darrian
Navy Special Arm.  His security clearance required that he be
psionically trained.  Concentration, was difficult in the roaring
wind, but he suddenly was inside the mind of someone in there. 
Two men, undoubtedly the ones the team had followed were arguing
with a third man in there who\'s mind Zdeldi could not touch. 
Zdeldi looked through the mind of one of them and saw the bridge
of a ship.
	"It\'s a ship." he announced quietly.
	"Boer," called Hloch.  "Use your clairvoyance and get a
picture of their bridge.  I think I know what\'s going on...
Zdeldi, read Boer\'s mind and transmit the picture to me...."


	Hloch looked at the strangely assembled crew as he briefed
them.  Ael Yael, Imperials, Zhodani, Darrians, Vargr and Aslan
all united against a common but very powerful foe.  "Ladies and
Gentlemen," he began, pointing to the picture of the white plume. 
"What we are flying against is a black globe."
	Confused faces in the audience looked at each other.
	"A black globe is essentually a field which absorbs energy. 
ALL energy:  light, heat, radiation, kinetic, the strong and weak
forces of nuclei AND gravitational.
	Now, some of you may or may not have heard of gravitons. 
Gravitons are particles very like photons.  Photons are pretty
easy to understand.  An particle with a certain amount of energy
emmits a photon.  This photon doesn\'t have mass, but it does have
energy.  This little packet of energy strikes another particle
giving it more energy.
	Right.  Now gravitons are emmitted by particles with mass
and they are absorbed by other particles.  This action pulls the
particle back toward the particle back toward the first one.  The
farther you get away from those masses the fewer gravitons from
it you will intercept.  Thus the 1/R squared relation; just like
photons.
	The thing about gravitons is that they don\'t often effect
other particles:  Very small cross section.  That\'s why when you
stand on top of something you don\'t weigh any less.  Most of the
gravitons pass right through what ever you stand on and a few
interact with you.  You also emmit gravitons so any that do
interact with you won\'t be missed by anyone above you.
	Now, I see Alaya shaking her head.  Ok, so I\'ve simplified
the quantum theory of gravity.  Please remember that while Boer
here is a great teleport commando, he\'s had no formal scientific
training.
	Ok, now the black globe absorbs not just the gravitons an
object of its size and mass would normally, but ALL of them that
would pass through it.  A black globe in a gravitational well
will create a zone of zero gravity above it.
	Thus, above the ship out there in the mountains is a pillar
of zero gravity.  The atmosphere in this pillar has equal
potential energy therefore equal pressure.  The air is drawn in
at the base and expands in the upper atmosphere.  That is our
tornado.
	However, the huge number of gravitons being absorbed by that
globe means one hell of a lot of energy.  If you put a space
craft in the zero gravity zone all you would have to do is give
it a shove and it would just drift up to orbit.  And with the
gale winds blowing you wouldn\'t even need to shove very hard. 
THAT is the kind of energy that is absorbed by a black globe.
	From the conversation Zdeldi overheard inside the ship we
know the energy influx is being used for crystal manufacture. 
Those blasted crystals must be hard.  The energy used to create
them is enormous.
	All of this is irrelevent to our mission, but you need to
know what we\'re taking on.  Back when I first started out as a
naval architect I worked on the \'Thunder Fox\' class:  black
globes.  A number of us working on the project speculated on
black globes close to a planet surface.  Testing and models said
that at tech level fifteen,  you can\'t operate a globe below low
orbit.  Obviously, these folks are operating at a very high
level.  But even they must be under a strain.  Absorbing all the
gravity, and sitting in what must be a rising lake of liquified
gasses condensed by the absolute zero black globe.
	Now.  That ship could be very easy to destroy.  If we bring
the \'Alexandria\'s lasers to bear on it from orbit they might be
forced to raise the globe up full.  Right now, according to the
densitometer readings, it\'s flickering at a rate of seventy three
percent so they are only absorbing a fraction of the energy that
they might be.  If they absorbed the full force of gravitational
energy, they would undoubtedly overload their energy sinks and
blow the ship to tiny tiny pieces.
	Problem:  the \'Alexandria\' being only a scoutship doesn\'t
have much firepower.  And besides we need information.  That ship
can answer a lot of questions.
	The weapon we have best suited for the attack is psionics. 
Telepathy and clairvoyance seem to work through the globe.  This
may be because it is only flickering, but they might work even if
the globe is fully raised."
	Hloch turned and looked his audience in the eye
"Suggestions?"
	Boer scratched his beard as he considered the problem. 
"Well, if we want to shut down the globe there are two ways I can
think of.  One, we could try a scrambler mission, using
clairvoyance and telekinesis to operate the black globes
controls.  Or, two a teleport commando operation to get inside
and shut it down.  Problem is, I don\'t know a thing about globe
controls.  I might blow the ship."
	Ryke Poe spoke up, "I\'ve operated globe equipped ships in
the IISS."
	Zdeldi turned to the imperial scout.  "You aren\'t psionic,
but if I act as a telepathic relay we can direct Boer and Alaya
and the other teleports what to do."
	Alaya shook her head.  "We don\'t know what how the globe is
going to effect psi ops.  I would advise against trying to
teleport in without more information.  I think the scrambler idea
is safer.  Besides, if someone hit the wrong switch and the ship
does go up, at least our people won\'t be inside.  Once the globe
is down, we send in the teleport troops and they let in the
rest...."

Scott Kellogg

PS.	A while ago, someone accused the black globe of being a
perpetual motion machine.  Well the answer to this is quite
simple:  OF COURSE IT\'S A PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINE!!!
By absorbing heat the way it does, it violates the third law of
thermodynamics so by definition is is a perpetual motion machine. 
The projected heat death of the universe is 0.4 degrees kelvin
(or is it 4 degrees kelvin?)  Anyway that is an amount of heat
that would be absorbed by the black globe.
	Rob Dean says he doesn\'t like them.  Frankly, I don\'t
either.  That is why I am adamantly in favor of their absorbing
gravitational energy:  It puts severe limits on what they can do!

According to the folks on GEnie, agility works like this:
(assuming I am understanding them correctly)
Rob, Can you please forward this to them?  They might be
interested.

The Inertial compensators nullify the mass of the people,
equipment, objects, cargo etc inside the ship.  Therefore
a ship has a mass of zero (or near zero) and then the
ship is capable of bursts of (nearly) infinite acceleration.
{I may be reading this wrong so I will assume that we are
only nullifying the effects of inertia, not mass}
[That way we only half completely destroy Newton\'s laws]

Ok, Now what happens when a mechanical device is placed inside
this hypothetical mass nullifying field...  Well, a mechanical
watch will instantly wind down.  Any pendulum which depends
upon it\'s mass and inertia will instantly fail.  A gyroscope
will not work at all. {It works because of it\'s angular momentum
but with no inertia, it will not work at all.}

What about something dear to the heart of most trav players:  a
Gun?  Well, no inertia...  How is a bullet with no inertia
going to hurt anyone?  Nope, a bullet with the inertia of a feather
thrown REALLY hard is not going to do it.  ;-)
KE weapons are useless.

Well, What about the good old human body?  Hmm, inertialess blood?
Bones with no inertia?  Sounds worse than micro-gravity for the body.
A few days in such a field and the body will weaken from lack of
exercise worse than any crew ever exposed to micro-gravity.
	What about on the moleqular level?  Suddenly every atom and
molequel in the body has no inertia.  Will normal chemical processes
still work?  I doubt it. (I\'m a physicist not a chemist)  I am afraid
that if you change one physical law, all the universe will come
tumbling down around your ears.  The human body is adapted to have certain
chemical reactions going on in the body constantly.  If you affect the
physical world with some sort of field, you will change the chemical reactions
going on.  I\'m afraid if you entered the field you would probably drop dead
instantly (oops no inertia... you would float dead instantly)

How do I explain inertial compensators?  Well, as I see them they are
grav plates which project a field in the opposite direction of the
ship\'s drive.  There are auxillury ones in the other axes of the ship to
compensate for lateral and rotational movements.  (the area around the
pilot\'s couch has a weakened field allowing the pilot to feel how the
ship is moving without getting flattened by 6G\'s.
	Control of such plates is simple.  The main drive is computer
controlled.  The computer merely directs the compensators to create a field
of equal and opposite strength to the acceleration of the ship.
So when the ship is acclerating a 6G\'s an object in the ship will be
subjected to the acceleration and this is cancelled by the artificial grav
plates of the inertial compensators also putting out 6G\'s.
	This is a much SIMPLER method of cancelling out the effects of the
ship\'s drive.  It doesn\'t violate any new laws of physics.  (other than
anti-grav) and it doesn\'t impose a \'field\' which affects the normal
laws of physics in ways that are not well understood, but will certainly
result in the death of any and all passengers aboard.

seems like what the compensators do) is by creating an acceleration
field with no propogation.

ie- The \'inertia-less\' drive in my SF games AREN\'T truly inertia or
acceleration-less, they only seem that way on a macroscopic scale
because velocity is increased for all atoms simultaneously. The
acceleration one can use depends on the fineness of this velocity field,
as too high acceleration will start fusing atoms...

In the world where I first developed this idea their first field dumped
KE to every atom simultaneously. This had one huge problem- acceleration
of each atom was inversely proportional to it\'s mass... so at very high
accelerations, you would get a chromotogram of a ship... hydrogen in
front, scaling down to heavier atoms in back... :)

The ships of that period used massive cylinders of some pure substance
(usually iron, for a variety of reasons) attached by heavy struts to the
rest of the ship. Acceleration depended on the strength of the struts,
and had none of the useful effects of \'inertia-less\'.

It was, however, reactionless. Or at least seemed that way. In reality,
it emited something like anti-gravity, with a propagation about light
speed, which pushed or pulled nearby bodies. Again a bit limiting.
Combinations of the technologies created reaction drives of ultra-high
efficiency, kinetic shields, which propogated impacts as ship-wide
accelerations, etc.

Recntly someone mentioned (I forgot to keep the message around, and
don\'t recall who it was) that rounds would not be interchangable
between tech levels.  I always assumed that there was some sort of
standard "Imperial 7mm" or "Imperial Marine 9mm long" like we have
today with such things as 7.62 NATO or .45 ACP.  Sure, you can
occasionally find non-standard stuff, but it seems to me that it\'d be
much cheaper to produce rounds locally (maybe 1 world in the subsector
gets the contract and ships them to the bases).

As far as guns go, they are probably produced under contract from a
standard design so that troops do not need to be retrained when they
are stationed in different subsectors.

Of course, this all assumes that the Imperial Bureaucracy is smart
enough to go for the lowest co solution.    Or greedy enough to
realize the high bribe potential involved in awarding the Imperial Contracts.

Just a few incoherent thoughts.

(Jeannie from Hwig, Idaho writes:
Dear Dr. Science,
What would happen to the human body if there were no inertia?)

Thanks, Rodney!
Well, Jeannie, Let\'s ask one quick question:
What is air pressure?  Well, air pressure is caused by billions
and billions of little things called molequeles bouncing off a
wall like a handball court.  The inertia of these molequeles is
transferred to the wall in effect pushing against the wall with a
force.

Now if there was no inertia, then there will be no air pressure.

(Gee, Dr. Science!)

That\'s right Rodney!  Ok, now the human lungs work by expanding
the ribcage, creating a partial vacuum so that air will flow into
the lungs.  But, if there is no air pressure outside the lungs,
and no air pressure inside the lungs, no air will flow anywhere:
So, no air gets into the blood stream and you die.

(Gosh Dr. Science!)

But it gets worse Rodney!  Just as there is no air pressure,
there would be no pressure in liquids either.  So a person\'s
blood pressure would drop to zero also!  Now, the heart works the
same way as the lungs do.  So, with no blood pressure, the heart
will stop working causing death before you had a chance to die of
suffocation.

(Just a moment Dr. Science, what about Van der Waals forces?)

Well, it\'s true that Van der Waals force will give the blood some
tiny blood pressure, but I doubt it would be sufficient to keep
the blood flowing.  Heart efficiency would be drastically
reduced.  And if it were sufficient, you would just die from
suffocation.

(What about Chemical reacitions Dr. Science?)

Well, Rodney, BioChemistry was never my strong point, but I
suspect that the chemical reactions necessary to keep the
metabolism working would be badly effected.  Probably that would
kill you even before the heart would stop.

Anyway, Jeannie, to answer your question "what happens with zero
inertia?" in two words \'You Die\'.

(Gosh Dr. Science!)

Well, Rodney, it\'s not all that crucial a question.  I think it\'s
more important to ask questions like "How many Primordials does
it take to change a lightbulb?"

(Gee, Dr. Science, how many does it take?)

{Yawn!!}  Who Cares?  {Snore!!!}

Paul Dale writes about Disintigrators:

"Currently disintegrators are basically worthless weapons, they
get less \'free\' hits than meson guns, they are affected by
armour, they don\'t get internal damage hits.  When you also
consider that they are expensive, large, heavy & suck power like
nothing else they become totally useless"
"Strengthening a disintegrator is the way to go."

Disintigrators in Trav
How do they work?
According to Book 4 Mercenary, Nuclear dampers "may be used to
increase or decrease the stability of atomic nuclei.  Projecting
from two different stations, the intersection of the two
transmitted broadcasts produces a series of nodes and
anti-nodes.  In the area of the nodes, the strong nuclear force
is enhanced making the nucleus more stable.  In the area of the
anti-nodes, the strong nuclear force is depressed, making the
nucleus much less stable.  Anti-nodes are focussed on incoming
nuclear warheads, causing them to shed neutrons at low energy
levels, rendering the warhead inoperable."

"The damper is later developed into a disintigrator weapon,
beginning at tech level 16."

OK!  If that\'s how disintigrators work... Well, what happens to
those neutrons?  If you are going to disintigrate a large object,
you are going to give off one hell of a neutron storm!  Anyone
nearby will get blasted.

OOPS!  What about mass difference?  When an atom loses a neutron
it looses mass.  This mass is converted into energy.  (That\'s how
atomic fission works!)  So when your ship\'s hull starts loosing
neutrons it is going to gain energy.  Heat.  Presumeably, the
heat is sufficient to vaporize the material being vaporized. 
Thus the target disintigrates.

UH-OH!  That\'s not what happens!  According to Adventure 3: 
Twilight\'s peak (the only time we see disintigrators ever
described in action)  The target just "vanishes".  No heat, no
radiation storm.  The target just disappears.  "Control is
sufficiently precise to vanish one man from a crowd or destroy a
party\'s (sic) weapons while leaving everything else intact."

Rationalization:  (How it works when Scott is Ref and crazy
enough to try to deal with ancient artifacts)
The energy released is drained away from the target by the weapon
and goes toward powering the weapon.  After all, disintigrating
an object in the manner they describe requires one hell of a lot
of energy.
	In an ancient TL 24 pistol, there is sufficient power
stored to disintigrate a certain amount of mass.  As soon as the
disintigrator is fired it disintigrates that mass and drains off
the energy of the reaction to recharge itself.  If the energy was
NOT drained off (as might happen if the pistol malfunctioned) the
energy is released into the environment and the pistol is now
drained.  (note that the energy released into the environment is
going to be on the order of several kilotons.)
	Advice to anyone finding a 300,000 year old disintigrator:
Don\'t fire at close range...

	With a Shipboard disintigrator, you would have a choice:
either disintigrate a certain amount of mass for a split second
which would release the fission energy (several kilotons...) or
absorb that energy to maintain the disintigrator beam.

The first type of attack will give off huge amounts of radiation,
and energy.  The second attack would merely vaporize a certain
amount of mass in the target.  Either way, I do not see how armor
is a defence.  The anti-node of the disintigrator can be focused
inside the ship.  (Thus you could have an internal explosion in
the kiloton range)

Disintigrating mass might be more desirable if you want to
capture a ship.  (just replace the missing components and plates)

But which ever type of attack you like, the damn thing has to be
more deadly than the TL 8-9 particle accelerators which the rules
say it is on par with.  (Actually less so because it doesn\'t get
an automatic hit!)

Which brings me on to the use of nuclear dampers as defences.  It
occurs to me, that unless a target vessel knows what it is being
attacked with, it will not be able to do anything about it.  A
software program will have to be set up for the dampers to defend
against disintigrators.  Until the defender has seen a
disintigrator and experimented with it, they will not be able to
defend against it.

Looks bad enough?
Lets examine the most popular cartridge in the world - 9mm Parabelum:
 
The standard ball bullet is 115 grain full metal case (FMC) projectile.
But there are alternatives - I carry 122 grain FMC rounds in my pistol,
a friend of mine has alternating 147 grain semi-jacketed hollow point
(SJHP) and 127 grain FMC. There are also 94 grain jacketed hollow point
(JHP), 105 grain silvertip HP (SHP), 115 grain military grade FMC made
with stronger propellant (the +P rating of some 9mm Para bullets is the
civillian version of this type) which can damage pistols firing it too
many times (these rounds are for submachineguns - UZI, MAC-11, etc).
 
There is now a shotgun round for the 9mm - 8 pellets in a container round,
Glazer safety slugs, 85 grain high speed FMC, 100 (or near) grain soft nose
bullets. There are types I do not know about, probably.
 
In addition, the weights of the weapons seem wildly off the mark. Lets
examine a modern pistol in detail. The pistol is Smith and Wesson 5904
semi auto (indeed, the pistol I carry):
 
                S&W 5904        TL7 9mm Auto
Length:           195mm           200mm
Weight:           780gm          1350gm
Rounds:         15/20              15
15x115grain FMC: ~200gm
15x122grain FMC: ~180gm (very light round cases)
15x147grain SJHP:~400gm
15x9mm Imperial                   200gm
15x9mm AP Imperial                150gm
 
Problems: Weight! The heaviest 9mm I am acquainted with (CZ-75) weighs around
1000gm. The lightest (Glock 19) weighs around 480gm. Where did the 1350 figure
come from?

Any suggestions ?

Some of the players in my campaigne told me:

We will make a program in the ship\'s computer, which will engage jumpdrive,

at least an area of 400 km^2.

Any comments ?

That\'s it, Juergen

P.S.: If the suggestion above is true, it should be a much easier way,
      to destruct a planet, than using high KE weapons. Simply use a small
      Scout/Seeker and engage his jumpdrives on a planet\'s surface.

This sounds exactly like what I posted to the TML on 8/6.  I had
mentioned that it could be used to justify the way agility works,
but there is a more fundamental reason for a "physics nullifier"
here.  In fact, there are a number of "physics nullifiers" inherent
to Traveller.  You have a choice: accept them or change the nature
of the game.

I\'m not talking just about the way agility is calculated, either.

I\'m also not going to try to prove why interstellar travel breaks
our physics.

A huge problem is that of energy.  Traveller craft use fusion power
(this is given).  Ships are also capable of accellerating to some
very high velocities (sustaining 1G for a month is going to get you
pretty close to the speed of light).  Fusion just DOESN\'T supply
that much energy.  Even if you were converting mass to energy with
100% efficiency, you still would have to use a sizable fraction of
the ship\'s mass as fuel.

Face it.  There\'s a problem.  If you really don\'t want "yet another
physics nullifier" then switch to fusion rockets and forget about
it.  Of course, that\'s not Traveller anymore.  (Don\'t get me wrong,
I think it would be a great game.  It\'s just not Traveller, that\'s
all.)  While you\'re at it, you might as well nix FTL drives at the
same time.

If you really want to stick with Traveller, then it is a question
of choosing your physics nullifiers.  While you\'re at it, why not
assemble a set of physics that works with the present rules?  As
long as it is consistent, I say this is OK.

I\'m not going to argue about which set of physics nullifiers is
better -- I already have mine, thank you.  But don\'t argue over
every rule as a matter of present day physics.  I\'m not saying
you can\'t question a rule, mind you -- I don\'t like the "excess
power = agility" rule either.

Whenever anyone posts an idea for justifying something, we tend to
get a bunch of posts to the effect of "It won\'t work.  How could
anyone have thought of such a stupid idea?  Ha."  C\'mon.  Nothing
works if you close your mind (Hummingbird population extinguished
when they discover that they can\'t in fact fly.  News at 11. 8-).

Of course, you could also forget about justifying everything and
simply play the game 8-).

I guess what I\'m trying to say is this:  Don\'t worry so much about
trying to make everything work by current physics.  If it really
bothers your sensibility to leave things unexplained, then by all
means explain them.  But you WILL have to make modifications to
present-day physics.  If you decide that your set of "physics
nullifiers" doesn\'t support the Traveller rules, then so be it.
But don\'t complain if I decide to make up one that does, or choose
not to worry about it.

  In 3G, the weight of the gun is dependent on the power of the round, which
directly affects the mass of the reciever and barrel, but the barrel is
greatly affected by length. The resulting weight of the gun can be reduced by
putting a multiplier on the price. I suspect that I put a 0.75 mod on the
weight of that gun, which gave a 2.0 mod on the price.

  The reason why it gets so heavy, is that the round has to be much more
powerful to penetrate AF 2, which compares to 5mm armor plate. Computing actual
penetration in mm using 3G/Timelords and crossreferencing this on the
Striker/MegaT chart of armor mods to get the penetration. This ment that it was
harder to get the lower penetrations (1-6) but much easier to get the higher
penetrations (7+) with the weapons. I \'punched up\' the load of some of the 
lighter weapons and rounds to reach their rated penetration in MegaT, but I 
didn\'t decrease it for those that begun to overachieve. 
  
  (A quick check with 3G gives that a TL7 9mmP has a DV (Damage Value, it gives
the penetration in MegaT) of 22, but the 9mm auto in the Imperial Encuclopedia
has a Pen of 2, and the round would need a DV of 27 to get a Pen of 2. There
wouldn\'t be any difference in penetration ability between a 9mmP or a
.357 Magnum if I did them with the real propellant loads, since all of them 
would get a penetration of 1. (DV\'s between 14 and 26 are Pen 1, because the
Striker/MegaT armor factors are too far apart at the low end of the scale:
AF 1 = 2.5mm, AF 2 = 5mm, AF 3 = 7.5mm))

  Hmmm... (sound of opinion changing) I think I\'m beginning to agree with Rob
about lowering the AVs of the armors, so that I wouldn\'t have to boost the
rounds, but what do we do with all the futuristic armors that we don\'t know
how thick they are? Keep as is? Divide by 2? Remember that the AF of 18 for
a Battledress-15 means that it\'s armor equals 5cm of armor plate!

  The reason why it is very hard to do a round that is compatible with weapons
from all TLs (or at least 4 and up:) is that the energy of the powder increases
rather drastically. For the round to physically fit in the weapons, it will
have to be the same shape and size, and that means that the amount of powder
cannot be changed (except in very special circumstances, like the 5.56mm sub-
sonic for supressed weapons).
  And since the volume of powder is the same, but the energy increase, you
would get all kinds of interesting effects if you put a TL15 7.62 N in an
TL4 7.62 bolt action rifle. The hitech weapons would also have to be designed
for a greater than nessesary energy, with would make them heavier and more
expensive, and the lowtech weapons would become *much* heavier if their
designers had to prepare them for someone using hitech rounds in them.

  (The Swedish military standard 9mm is a Husquarna brand modified version of 
the old German Luger (ie a TL5 construction). There have been many cases where
old Husquarnas have cracked because the shooter had carelessly loaded it with
(TL 7) 9mm rounds intended for the M/45 SMG, and we are only talking about a
difference of 2 TL\'s here)

  Standardization:
    Advantages:
      No development costs.
      Standardization (but remember the TL effects!).
    Disadvantages:
      Royalties.
      Not adapted to local conditions.
      Is it really nessesary for a planetbound force?
  
  Local development and production:
    Advantages:
      Export potential (if you have lo-tech neighbours)
      Helps technical development on own planet.
      Adapted to local conditions.
    Disadvantages:
      Noncompatibility.
      Development costs.

  This question is highly dependant on how many people that really travel
extensively in the Imperium. I\'ve always been under the impression that a
majority of the travels are done by a small minority consisting of those whose
work carry them between systems, nobles and adventurers. The majority of the
population of a certain planet couln\'t care less if their brands of ammunition
wasn\'t available 1pc away because they won\'t leave their planet.

  This is of course not true for organizations that span an area larger than
a system, like the IMC and the MegaCorps. I suspect that that is why 
Interstellarms have had such a hit with their standard line of weapons.

You could.  (And in the real world, mostly I do...)  What I have an aethetic
objection to is any game in which really strange things are done to the
\'reality base\' for no apparent gain in the game\'s play.  I think of it as
the same sort of trouble I would have with a fantasy game that made swords
better than halberds for wounding someone in plate armor, or a modern game
which is supposed to be \'realistic\' in which characters can routinely absorb
a couple of .50 caliber machine gun bullets in the head <!> without becoming
unconscious.  It destroys my suspension of disbelief.

For Traveller, we basically have to accept the Jumpdrive and the grav plate
in order to stay with the game.  My aesthetic preference is that new 
technologies not be multiplied to cover what were probably intended as
approximations in the rules.  What Traveller really needs is a set of
Designer\'s Notes, to tell us what sort of things they skimped over and
why.  I also tend to see most of these new explanations for rules as
creating more problems than they solve.  If an inertial compensator is
really a misnomer for a grav plate system that is aligned opposite the
engine, then we haven\'t altered the assumptions of the game.  If it really
\'neutralizes mass\' then we have to spend a lot of time explaining why this
simple <?> TL9 invention <per the GEnie note> isn\'t used to ease transport
problems at higher tech levels, and why (for example) we don\'t just put a 
little tiny rocket on the ship, nullify the mass, and accelerate at 150Gs
for a couple of hours until the fuel runs out instead of carting around
those big fusion plants.

Despite the fact (or maybe because of it) that I have done extensive work
with the new vehicle design system, I feel that it was not especially
improved by addding all the extra detail compared to High Guard or Book 2.
However, because it is so detailed, my aesthetic sense is once again offended
when someone suggests to me that thousands of megawatts of power can be pumped
into some sort of mysterious agility generator, when the system requires me
to specify every piece of electrical equipment down to the cigarette lighter.
(-:  Where is this agility generator hiding, and how much does it weigh per
kl? (-:  If the inertial compensators are responsible for agility, then
the rules should tell me that a ship that has none has no agility, right?

Ah well, what can I say?  The current rules are just not very well thought out
in a lot of important ways.  (All cargo is worth the same amount per kl?  Makes
for a very dull merchant game, let me tell you...I\'m tossing that out and
using Book 2 again for the moment...)  The strength of Traveller is in the
background.

Enough ranting for now.  Is anyone else going to be at the World Science 
Fiction Convention in Chicago?  Leave a message for me on the Voodoo message
board if you are.  (If you\'ve been to a worldcon you know what I mean...if not
ask a native.)

I don\'t have the rules on me, but under the Old Traveller rules, you just had a
bad nasty DM if you were within 10 diameters.  Something about gravity wells
messing up the Jump physics.  Since they didn\'t say what would happen if you
were on the planets surface, some players logically argued that you could
engage Jump and live with the -DMs.  If you pilot is good enough, this has a
high probablility of just being a mis-jump.

Since Jump is not a propulsion system like the manuver drives, you could infer
that the jump drives just effect the mass of the ship and would put it into
jump space.  Where, and at what direction and jump velocity would be very
random due to the severe effects of gravity.  There would be probably no damage
to the planet since it is not a hyperspace object.

Now it is possible that the ship would be destroyed since the mishap chance is
very high.

Your call there.  MegaTraveller may have a more definitive answer.

A hand full of TL-15 Nukes are a lot cheaper than a 10Mcr scout.  I would
suspect that ramming the planet would do more damage than jumping from it.

Yes, Mr. Science is back in action(that\'s \'MR.\', not \'DR.\', dammit!), and
I thought I\'d toss in my two bits on the recent firearms discussion. I don\'t
have any material in front of me, so this is only as reliable as my memory:
usually pretty good, but I encourage corrections.

Since the various and sundry types of firearms are already getting plenty
of air time, let\'s toss another bone in the pot: ammunition.

Something that a lot of ordinary people have found out(that the police and
military won\'t notice \'till the end of the century at least! :) is that
ammo technology has changed *a lot* in the past decade or two. Back before
the early \'80s (I don\'t work well with precise dates, no flames please),
about all anybody used was plain \'ol FMJ - Full Metal Jacket - a lead
bullet wrapped in a thin copper (or other soft metal) jacket to give it
a little more oomph. If you didn\'t want to shell out for FMJ, you got 
even plainer \'ol Ball ammo - no jacket; cheap for training & practice,
but leaves a mess in your barrel. If you were really in a bad mood, you got 
some HP - Hollow Point - a lead bullet, with or without a jacket, which had 
a divot taken out of the middle so that on impact with a reasonably soft 
target(usually a person), it expanded outward into a large flat surface
(called \'mushrooming\', get the picture?) and caused really nasty wounds. 
Unfortunately, nobody really cared what shape the divot was when they 
started making these things, so their mushrooming effect wasn\'t terribly 
reliable. Finally, if you really had some spare cash, or were in some
armies, you might even get some AP rounds - Armor Piercing - just use
something harder than lead(hence the high cost to make).

You\'ll note that I\'m only discussing common types of rounds; there have
always been people who \'roll their own\', casting their own custom bullets
and so forth. Also, \'gee-whiz\' rounds like tracers, discarding sabot,
explosive-tipped, etc. either only existed in medium- to large-caliber
rifles, or(when put into handgun-sized calibers) were about as reliable as
your average public-transit system(in other words, not very!).

Recently, however, most companies have gotten a *lot* better with their
production techniques, as well as having much more creative R&D people.
Fr\'instance: my personal choice for \'carry\' ammo is the Winchester SilverTip
Hollow Point(STHP); weighing in at 129 grains in 9mm, it is, IMHO, the
best combination of penetration and stopping power in this caliber. A friend
of mine did some testing with this round in his .357 Magnum, and found that
it *very* reliably expanded in soft targets(just water jugs, guys :); but
against hard surfaces, it \'noses in\', collapsing on the divot for better
penetration. Federal Hydra-Shok ammo uses a bizarre-shaped divot with a
post, or sprue(or something) in the middle for easily comparable results.

As Mark noted, various companies now make \'shotshell\' rounds in handgun
calibers; .22 shotshell has been around for some time as a bird or rodent
round. It would make a wonderfully safe shipboard round in your 10mm
Autopistol(as long as your targets were unarmored :)

Another new creature in the zoo is the Glaser Safety Slug. This thing is
basically a bunch of tiny pellets(I don\'t remember what size), inside a
soft plastic(?) shell. The entire \'packet\' is fired from the gun, which
then breaks on impact, causing fairly nasty wounds(again, only to unarmored
targets), but it won\'t go through walls or doors and so forth. They\'d be
perfect for modern-day police departments, except for their outrageous
price: ~$18 for a packet of -6- shells is ridiculous!

Tracer and explosive rounds are also more availiable in pistol sizes these
days - more reliable too, although an expl. round will go off on the first
thing it hits, including panes of glass, etc., so watch what your PCs are
shooting at! These things are also a lot more available(frighteningly so) to
the general public. At any decent-sized gun show(the Indy 1500 in Indianapolis
is good), you can buy damn near *anything*. Did you know that, even though
you have to be 21 to get a pistol in Indiana, you can buy explosive handgun
ammo, over the counter, without even showing a driver\'s license? Don\'t you
feel safe with that kind of firepower at your disposal?(note:this is sarcasm:-)

I could probably go into a tirade about the NRA, but I\'ve prattled on enough 
as it is. 

Suffice to say that even at TL7.5(and holding...), firearms are more than
deadly enough to get your PCs on the \'Imperium\'s Most Wanted\' very quickly.
In game terms, even low-tech guns kill people *quickly*, not just from the
bullet itself, but from the *kinetic energy* it brings with it. I\'ll leave
it to you Physics types to do the calculations, but I\'m pretty sure that
gauss weapons, with their 4mm needle bullets, are horribly overrated. They
may have a small enough cross-section to penetrate heavy armor, but they
won\'t do much damage once they get there. An old .45 slug, in comparison,
can\'t get through even modern body armor(cheap Cloth), but the impact alone
*will* knock you on your ass, and may very well kill you from blunt trauma
alone(ever been hit with a baseball bat at full speed?). Advance 
miniaturization from higeher TLs will only make things worse(yes, Virginia,
they already make explosive-tip shotgun slugs...try not to think about it); 
It\'ll be a long time indeed before energy weapons replase slugthrowers on the
battlefield, if only because they\'re cheaper.

  No longer do people chance to take hits from Gauss rifles :-).
 
  Craig (who, among other sins, mangled my name) makes the mistake of
overrating the Glazer Safety round. It is, indeed, a very damaging
round, but it lacks in stopping power. For short ranges, I\'d prefer the
9mm 147 grain SJHP over any combination of DS and Glazer.
 
  Thus - high calibre pistols have an edge in self-defence situations,
with ranges below 25m.
 
  The Gauss rifle, on the other hand is a military weapon. It has
absolutely no use (worse, it is absolutely deadly) in a self-defence
situation of any range in a civillian context. It is intended to lay
down high rate of fire at a reasonable range with low recoil and high
penetration - wounded soldiers are better than dead soldiers, especially
if the needles are hard to remove.
 
  Other weapons have specific niches - the body pistol, the integral
laser gun and others.
 
  As for weight versus price - 3G is VERY wrong here. Here are prices
and weights of four 9mm pistols I know. Prices are in I$ - Israeli
dollars (i.e. Israeli sheqels converted to US$ at US$1=IS2.35).
 
                Gun           Price  Weight
 
            CZ-75             I$510  990gm  (exc ammo, 1150gm with ammo)
            S&W 5904          I$851  780gm  (exc ammo, 990gm with ammo)

            IMI Jericho 941   I$425  950gm  (exc ammo, 1250gm with ammo)
 
  It cannot be said that the Glock is the least advanced - indeed, it is
MORE advanced than either the Jericho or the CZ and possible more
advanced than the Smith and Wesson. Of the guns, two (S&W and Glock) are
US manufacture, one is Israeli (Jericho) and the one (CZ) is Czech.

  The Type JH was designed to be a fast, maneuverable intruder, armed
with missiles and a light laser battery. Somewhere in the development
process, a retaliation ship was requested by the Imperial Navy. Under
the designation ZN, 2 ships were built and tested.
 
  The type ZN carries 80 half-ton projectiles in the cargo hold. These
may be offloaded during flight using the two heavy robotic arms and
released. The official designation of the craft in imperial service is
Type QK Balastor Winhoek.
 
  At least two megacorporations are known to possess the plans for the
Type ZN. GSbAG ships YP-R15431 Auerian Caerian, YP-R15432 Auerian
Dioerika and YP-R15433 Auerian Easwyir have been identified as ZN
Intruders. Requests for information pertaining to these ships were
shuffled and reshuffled continuously.
 
  All Type ZN ships operate their reactors at 73% efficiency during
normal operations. Each hour off full reactor usage consumes 1.25 hours
of fuel. For especially long range operations or emergency jumps the
ship may switch off the maneuver drive to perform a second jump and seek
immediate refueling.
 
  Recently, GSbAG introduced the Type Y3. It is clearly a downgraded ZN
Intruder with lighter armament, smaller engines and computer and longer
range.

                           Type Y3 Gabilonne
 
 
  In 1114, GSbAG introduced a new pleasure yacht. The Type Y3, sporting
a conference room (3m x 14m x 8m), convertible into a squash court or a
light pistol shooting range, a sauna/jacuzzi room (3m x 8m x 7.5m) and
single staterooms for crew and passengers alike, became a successful
product, with 78 hulls purchased.
 
  In 011-1121, when BC-SMN049031 Zampok and its squadron jumped into the
Tavonni system (Vilis/Spinward Marches 1520) for routine refuelling, it
was a witness to a battle between a craft identifying itself as Y3-C1417
Muir Runner and a class T patrol cruiser T-N053003 Outrigger. The Muir
Runner continued to combat the Outrigger, destroying it and jumping
outsystem before the Zampok could intercept. Sensor scans showed that
the Runner exhibited much higher performance than is expected of the Y3
class, and suspicions are now rife that it has been, in fact, a ZN
Intruder, a class the Y3 closely resembles.
 
  Examination of purchasers shows that of the 78 hulls, at least 20 were
purchased by megacorporrations, notable among them GSbAG itself (seven
hulls) and Tukera (five hulls). The records do not indicate the exact
specifications of the purchased craft, an irregularity now under
criminal investigation.

  The various agreements on inhuman weapons (the first of which outlawed 
exploding bullets of less than a certain calibre, btw) doubtlessly has something
to do with it. I assume that these are in effect in the Imperium too.

  My knowledge on this comes from articles in the military press (like 
International Defence Review or Military Technology), and I must admit that
when I first heard of for example the Glaser round, it sounded like a good
idea. 
  However: The various incidents where certain of these \'new-style\' rounds
have behaved in a different way that advertised indicates that the technology
isn\'t mature enough yet. Wound-ballistics are more a combination of art and
opinion than science, which is highlited in the fact that there are as many
opinions on which fluid or gel to use as there are experts.

  Weapons are dangerous to the user either when the user is stupid or when the 
weapon behave in an unpredictabe way. Since user stupidity can be prevented 
through training, unpredictability is the greatest remaining hazard.

  These are the main reasons I\'ve put DS at TL 9 and higher, HP at TL 6+ and 
small-calibre (less than 10mm) HE at 10+

  (A tip to the Refs who\'s PC\'s like to use funny ammo: what do the criminal
and civil law say? :)

  That depends in their contruction. Sintered tungsten penetrators like those
that were used in early (ie 50\'s to 70\'s) discarding sabot tank rounds have
a tendency to disintegrate into a cloud of tungsten shrapnel just after 
penetrating the armour. And if the rounds are done as old \'Mercenary\' 
described them, with a 1mm tungsten core coated with a HP lead jacket, they
might work on lightly armored targets too (the word for this should be TSS -
Target Shredding Sabot, as gun data in the 2300 \'Backdoor\' adventure)

I never suggested that we should "throw technology at everything," but you
must admit that the physics problems presented by Traveller go FAR deeper
than jumpspace and anti-grav.

If you don\'t change something, then spaceships are getting a whole lot of
FREE energy right now.  Furthermore, this means that any Tom, Dick, or
Harry with a spaceship has the capability of single-handedly destroying a
planet.

You can either change the way maneuver drives work (quite drastically, I
might add), change the power source (this basically means consuming LARGE
quantities of fuel, even with 100% energy conversion), or accept that there
is some different set of physical laws which are being applied here (you
don\'t have to explain them if you don\'t want to).

Agreed.

Fine, don\'t explain them.  That\'s the way things work.  Period.

If you MUST have an explanation for things, then you will have to accept a
different physics or change Traveller.

If you have a concern about a particular explanation being inconsistent, then
say so and we can discuss it.

For example, the \'mass neutralizing\' explanation seems at first to be
inconsistent, since you could just strap a small rocket onto a spaceship
that has its mass reduced (actually, the rocket\'s mass would probably be
reduced as well, but this just means that the fuel must be ignited AFTER
it returns to "normal" mass).  What if external forces tended to bring
the ship back to "normal" mass, however?  In fact, the \'neutralization\'
could be inherently related to the propulsion mechanism itself.  The ship
might "warp" space in some direction (say, along the "mass" axis), using
this "warp" to provide propulsion.  Any force that acts on mass might also
tend to "warp" it back.

I also feel that involving inertial compensators integrally into the
"maneuver drive equation" is a mistake, but the main reason for this is
that it makes it impossible to have a ship with a maneuver drive and no
inertial compensators, even though there are examples of such a ship.

If you accept that inertial compensators are integral to using the maneuver
drive, then this last case doesn\'t exist, since all ships will have SOME
inertial compensators (I\'ve already stated that I\'d rather not use inertial
compensators this way -- I also think it is easier to comprehend and more
fitting with the rules to say it is all handled by the maneuver drive).

Agreed, although I might not agree with you on everything that classifies
as "important."  They do tend to waver some on the level of hand-waving,
however, specifying some things to minute detail while ignoring the physics
problems that other things cause.  I think MegaTraveller tried to raise the
overall "hand-waving" level.

I believe that you\'ll find that the Glock is manufactured in Austria (at
least originally).  I would not _conclude_ that the Glock is more advanced
weapon than the others, but it does use a more advanced material for the
majority of it\'s components (Slide, Reciever, Magazine, etc.).  

The Glock has a radiply growing number of fans, and has had a number of
highly favorable reviews recently.  It may be the wave of the future but
all of the weapons above (and many others - Such as the Browning Hi-Power,
Beretta M92F, Taurus PT-92 & PT-99, H&K P7 Series, etc.) have advantages
and disadvantages when compared to one another.  I would say that the Glock
is an advanced weapon and it compares favorably to the other weapons
mentioned.

I suppose I should finally write my yearly TML Administrivia summary.
One of our largest contributors, Rob Dean, has continually bugged me
about it, so I guess I should get the monkey off my back today.	 Now I
know how Richard feels when he puts off the TML turn composition.  :-)

June 16, 1991 marks the fourth anniversary of the Traveller Mailing
List.  Four years before, I posted a message to rec.games.frp asking if
people would be interested in a mailing list to discuss Traveller, and
here we are!

Statistics: As of 30 August 1991, there are 279 member addresses on the
active list: 6 are on temporary hiatus, 206 receive the nightly digest,
64 receive the biweekly digest, and 6 receive the archive bundles; there
are also 18 prospective new members awaiting address confirmation.

Typically for prospective new members I send them one hello.  If I don\'t
hear back from them in a long time, I try once more, then forget about
ever reaching them.  Cruel but necessary on a 280-member list.

In the last two years the TML has exploded onto the internet, with
several FTP archive and special interest sites for Archives, Starship
Designs, and software.	TML archives on MS-DOS floppies have been
ordered by about 5 TMLers.  Experiments at discussion subgroups for
Trade and Commerce, Star System Database, and "Traveller Done Right"
took off wildy and then foundered due to reduced interest.  Another
experiment - Richard\'s TML PBEM - was and continues to be a big success.
Also, Jo Jaquinta\'s Sector/System/Wrold generation software continues to
be more and more detailed as time goes by.

The administration of the TML has pretty much remained unchanged,
undergoing evolutionary change to the shell/awk/sed scripts which I use
to run the TML.	 The TML moved from a VAX 11/785, dadla.la.tek.com, to a
Sun SparcStation 1, metolius.wr.tek.com.  Tektronix finally granted
indeirect internet access to its employees, so with the aid of Dan
Corrin I am ocassionally found doing extra organizational effort at the
sunbane ftp site.

Are there changes coming up in the adminstration of the TML? Perhaps.
If I can ever unbury myself from my many personal and work commitments,
I would like to completely rewrite the list/archive administration
software into a coherent, portable package.  Also, Tek management is
promising to move everyone in the Walker Road site back into Beaverton
sometime in the nebulous future, so there may be some TML down time when
this eventuality comes about.

If you can think of any way to make this list more useful, I\'d like to
hear your suggestions (even if they are "be more prompt, James!").
Thanks everybody for being a part of this list! Remember you don\'t need
to be a contributor to be welcome here.

  Nowhere do I say that the Glock is the wave of the future. In fact
(but this is quite a personal opinion), I hope it will be gone as soon
as possible - I do not trust safty-less pistols.
 
  However, the Glock __IS__ more advanced than the CZ-75, both in
materials and in action. It is more advanced (in materials) than the
Jericho 941, possibly also in action.
 
  I did not compare the Glock to any other weapons for a simple reason -
I did not shoot the weapons in question. From my knowledge, the Beretta
92F is better off forgotten as son as possible (which, alas, it will
not).
 
  The market (and that what it is, after all - a market) drives pistol
fashions - ammo and action. The current trend in ammo is slow, heavy
rounds of calibre close to 10mm (i.e. 9mm to 10.4mm). It was once in
favour of light, fast rounds (namely - .38 Special FBI load) but got
over that. The current trend in pistols is high capacity, light, medium
sized pistols - Glock is a wonderful example of these.
 
  All such trends may be reversed, modified or changed at a 6-months
notice.

  There are two answers to this. One - you have never encountered
players who like to say "I am loading APIDSPX now." Two - you have never
encountered people who like to say "Load phoshoru... er... soft
ordnance."

  I think that is a good idea. Maybe, softnose penetrators (oxymoron?)

Quite true, you never stated that.  _I_ stated that "It may be the wave of
the future", then again it might not.                       ======

It would not suprise me if more manufacturers produce weapons with similar
material\'s.  I would hope that they do not emulate the safety-less action
of 
the Glock.  Like you, I do not trust safety-less weapons.  The H&K P7
series also is safety-less (technically) but you have to physically
activate the 
firing pin to fire the weapon.

While I will agree with you that the Glock is more advanced in materials 
than the weapons mentioned, I cannot agree that it is more advanced in 
it\'s action exactly for the reason that you mention, no safety.  

>  I did not compare the Glock to any other weapons for a simple reason -

However, you did state "It cannot be said that the Glock is the least
advanced - indeed, it is MORE advanced than either the Jericho or the CZ
and possible more
advanced than the Smith and Wesson.".  This sounds like a comparison is
made between the Glock and the other weapons and the concusion is that the
Glock "is MORE advanced ...".  

I did state that the Glock was an advanced weapon and it compares favorably
with other weapons mentioned.  In the context that I was refering to, "a
number of reviews", it did well.  I can not definativly say how good of a
weapon the Glock is, since I have not had opportunity to fire one.  While
the materials it is made of are interesting, the safety-less operation is a
big disadvantage, IMHO.

I would be interested to hear what you have heard about the Beretta 92F.  I

would guess that what you have heard is not favorable?  But perhaps this is
beyond the scope of a Traveller discussion...

I think I can fit this into a TML message :-).
 
Firstly, the 92F is parallel to Imperial a 10mm SNUB (well, more or less).
 
The primary problem with Traveller equipment (ALL equipment, except
vehicles and ships) is that there is only ONE version of everything.
 
The US army had a competition for its primary handgun. The 92F won over
the Sig Sauer by virtue of a cheaper maintenance and spare parts deal.
It was then found out that the slide cracks and flies off the pistol
after about 4000 rounds have been fired. The US army instructed the
users to have the slides replaced after 3000 rounds have been fired. The
a slide broke after 3200 rounds have been fired. The US army cut the
replacement ceiling to 2000 rounds. Finally, the ceiling stood on 1000
rounds to replacement. The aforementioned saving went out of the gub
barrel :-).
 
In addition, a "feature" of the 92F adds to the "maintenance"
misadventure - both sights are part of the slide. Break one - slide must
be replaced. Cheap, eh?
 
Now - in Traveller we only have "10mm Auto." What about a "Intellarms
S-56 10mm Auto with gyrostabilizer?" Or a "BendArCo 23dm double magazine
10mm?" Or "Causative XMH-242 8mm, gyrostab, integral bipod, laser
rangefinder and designator?"
 
All Traveller equipment is "Pop from box. Unlimited warranty. Breaks on
GM intervention ONLY." What about lemons?! Eh!?

  I know that players like lots of letters on the ammo, but that gives the
Referee an additional \'push\' to use at them: Use of illegal ammunition.
The bad guys will of course always use the most effective ammo available,
so the PCs will either be at a disadvantage or run afoul of the law, which
will lead to later disadvantages.

  Then there is the question of the Lawlevel on the ammo. Very \'fun\' ammo might
not be available on Lawlevels >0 (note that exploding rounds are illegal at
LL >0. This means that HEAT for the snub pistol and HE for the ACR is hard
to find.) 
  Zhodani Thought Police, Solomani Solsecs, Vargr pirates and K\'Kree militant
vegans always have large supplies of such ammo, though:)

So here\'s one I\'ve been wondering about for a while.  Traveller
has been around for 10 years or so now.  We all know that
"Knowledge doubles every N years," with N some
impressive-sounding small integer :-).  So, when do we bump the
TL of "modern-day" Earth?  There\'s sure a lot of technology
around now that wasn\'t even 5 years ago.  Maybe an 0.5 TL
increment?

The real questions I\'m trying to ask, of course, are:  How are
tech-levels scaled?  Linearly?  Exponentially?  In what
variable?  Some performance measure must be being used for the
technology being rated.  What is this measure, e.g. in
transportation, weaponry, or medicine?

Probably some part of the rules, (with which I\'m afraid I\'m not
very conversant) make this clear, but it seems to me to be hard
to both justify the assignment in the rules of technology to TL
and simultaneously reason that technology will keep expanding
at the current pace on Earth without taking it through a TL in
the next 10 years or so, if not in the last.

My apologies if Traveller die-hards already all know the answer
to this one...

  I once saw a situation (luckily, NOT in a game I participated in)
where the players had "ready boxes" for every law level. "Break out the
number 5 box, I\'ll have 3 units of ammunition." was a remark heard from
time to time. These people solved elmost everything out of the blazing
plasma barrel.

  Can it be "tied" to a pistol or rifle - a laser sight? Doubtful, but
possible. What is the duration of the AAAA batteries for that pen? It
certainly cannot be used as a designator. As for demonstrators - a REAL,
third generation, laser beam sight (made in Israel by El-Op) costs about
$250, is about 6.5 centimeters long and 1 centimeter in diameter. It is
mountable on a pistol with ease, beside, above or under the barrel, and
can withstand recoil...

Getting way off the subject (traveller) but I believe that the slide
breakage problem the US Army experienced was a result of using submachinegun
ammo (black stripe on case around primer?) in the 92F pistol.  However,
it is interesting that traveller allows substution of ammunition between
submachineguns and automatic pistols (If I remember correctly).  Then
again, with that many worlds, tech levels and gun-makers, a character in
a super-accurate campaign would be nuts to trust ammo bought on a different
world than the weapon.

an Interstell Arms X91 10 MM Snub?).  If you want to, you can even get into
the used gun market and have all sorts of fun.  For example, I bought a
used Taurus 9mm and shot 3 boxes of ammo through it on my first tryout.
2-3 rounds from every clip jammed.  Needless to say, I was pissed.  I took
the gun back to the store and traded it in for a new Browning Hipower.  
Haven\'t had a jam since.  I would think that every world manufactures weapons
that is able to.  Basically what I say is that there are Imperial specs
for ammo and each world builds guns to those specs.  Another thing you
could introduce are local weapons only.  Your player finds a nice gun
that does a lot of damage but the ammo is only available from the world
or origin (a good calibre today to show this is the 7.65 Argentine).

Is something messing up on the distribution to the list?  The last few
copies of the TML I have received have been chopped off somewhere in
the middle.

  I did something like this once with a Solomani specific gauss-carbine and
gauss-mg (suspiciouly similar to the pulserifles and the harness mounted mg\'s
in \'Alien\':). The PCs managed to get their hands on one of each, and a small
supply of ammunition, *and* they were smart enough to start researching if
they could specially order more ammo from a certain sectorwide ordnance
manufacturer that wish to remain anonymous:)
  Everything went fine, it would actually cost *less* thant what they\'d expect,
but after a while they begun to suspect that this company planned to include
these weapons in their normal product line. It all led to a quite nasty verbal
fight over royalties, which ended with the PCs giving the suits the finger and
stomping out, with their weapons, only to find that the company had tried to
frame them as Solomani spys to get it\'s hands on guns anyhow:)

On Bart\'s question re TLs, I believe the rules state that a planet gets 
listed at a new TL when any one area hits that TL-- such high tech is
generally a planet\'s most marketable resource, and it tends to drag
other advances along with it. Personally, I was sitting in the TV 
Lounge at my dorm in Oberlin in 1981, watching the Columbia touch down
after its maiden flight. As the wheels touched down and everyone assembled
began to cheer, I quietly remarked to anyone who was listening, "Hm. Well,

This thing is supposed to be able to operate in temperatures of up to 1300

Somehow I don\'t think that even a TL13 man-portable refrigeration unit would
be up to that kind of load.  (Insulation might take it briefly, but not to
_operate_ in, as specified.)

I am also annoyed at the article on space combat.  Leaving out the business
about maneuvering according to the Ref\'s Manual (I\'ll circle in this square
at speed 40...), the article states that use of a firing battery must be
given up for each sensor task above one performed by a ship.  I don\'t recall
reading this rule?  Does anyone else?  Perhaps some sort of limit is
appropriate, but in this case, a ship with a Model 9 computer and one turret
would have to give up firing to make two sensor rolls, but the same ship 
could fire 999 out of 1000 turrets if it had them.  Doesn\'t make sense to
me at all.  Maybe a limit based on computer size (one roll per size per 
computer operational) or something like that.  Wouldn\'t be a problem in
a one on one encounter, but could be difficult if you were trying to engage
multiple targets.   There is also a note that pinpoint lockons for targetting
can be shared among ships.  Since the info would only do you some good if
you had an _exact_ position calculation on the friendly ship giving you the
data (using a sensor in the process?) I\'d disallow this one.

a year or two i might be able to sort through that material, I wish
even more now that we (HIWG) had easier access to that Net.
    In your last letter to me you offered to forward Bundles to me
as they become available. I would like to take you up on that offer,
if possible I would like to expand that offer if possible. What
I have in mind is that you could provide an Email feed between those
of us on GEnie and those on USENET, maybe a weekly link so it won\'t
take to much of your time? How do you feel about this? There are other
people who have this access so maybe the job could be shared (like
trade weeks or months). For instance I know that Farstar (James Kundert)
is on here and has a feed to USENET.

    You also offered to act as intemediary in my requests for use of
material from their mail in my magazine, if that offer is still
available, I would like to ask the following people to use their
material (I would also like to have their permission to have the material
used in a new Official GDW MT newsletter that is being worked on):

    Sorry to ask you another favor, but I promised Hess to do what I could

interested in 2300.
    Also, could you pass this message on to TML members who are interested
in 2300AD (and in rec.games.frp?):

    Clare Hess, Editor of 2300 Resource, an official GDW newsletter on
2300AD is looking for subscribers to this magazine (which I would rate
as very good quality). He is also interested in finding people who are
willing to do what they can to promote 2300AD.
    Subscriptions to this magazine are $8 per year (4 issues). Mail

Yngve Larsson <yngve@tigger.softlab.se>

Clare Hess would probably be interested in the 2300 material they\'ve
developed, as of right now however I haven\'t sent him the material these
people have posted to the TML because of possible copyright problems
(I wouldn\'t want to get anybody unintentionally in trouble, though I would

Carl -
     Bryan has a good idea.  We are starting an MT newsletter for GDW
called IMPERIAL LINES.  We can arrange to have sent out the free
introductory issues to those interested. But we need postal addresses
from people.  It\'d be great if you or someone else could announce it
on TML, collect the addresses, and pass them on to Bryan for now.
(That okay with you, Bryan?)
     Here\'s the skinny on the newsletter, as I wrote it for TIFFANY
STAR.  (TS28 went to paste-up yesterday.)

 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
                            GDW Newsletter
     HIWG is going to do the MegaTraveller newsletter for GDW, to be
called IMPERIAL LINES.  As it looks right now, it\'ll be quarterly, 8
pages, and circulated from GDW.  Geo Gelinas will be chief editor.
     As Geo describes in his 8/13/91 letter to James Maliszewski and
myself, "Other things I would like to put into the newsletter are the
occasional deck plan, perhaps one a year; equipment, but maybe not
placing a single piece of equipment on a single sheet; essays on
various topics; scenarios and news relating to the issue\'s subsector,
somewhat akin to the old amber zone; maybe a cartoon; artwork; and so
forth.  In fact, in many ways it will be like the JOURNAL CLASSIC."
     Although the newsletter probably will not be the official organ
for announcing products, it will include product news.  And, articles
featured in the newsletter will have a nature different from those
in Challenge. We shouldn\'t try to compete with Challenge for articles,
nor can we pay anything for them.
     With this in mind, I think the foremost objective should be to
circulate "orphaned" official or near-official information.  Examples
include material prepared for products but did not get in, the
complete table of sector names, official alien homeworlds, and Second
Survey material.
     The second most important thing is to circulate useful
compilations, i.e. the Traveller Database Project (TDB).  Even if this
material doesn\'t make for good stand-alone magazine articles, it has
much use.  Some of the things John Meyers has circulated are excellent
examples.
     The third is to circulate amateur articles and essays.  The

appeared in fanzines, plus new material, such as vehicles from Rob
Prior, and starport or alien essays from Bryan Borich.
     So far, here\'s how Geo is thinking to arrange the posts, although
this is still fluid:
        Chief Editor:         Mark "Geo" Gelinas
        Contributions Editor: Mike Mikesh
        Associate Editors:    John C. Meyers, Dennis Myers, ...
 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

     <HIWG has members that are interested in what we call
GIGATRAVELLER>  Yes, that\'s almost always what I\'ve heard it called.
Of course, I\'m sure no one is thinking that will end up its title.
     Curiously, Marc has heard that Geo and I are of the opinion that
Traveller would not be seriously harmed if they DID translate the
system to Tw2000.  This came out in a recent phone call Marc made to
John Meyers.  Despite Marc\'s comments at Origins about GDW having made
the decision to keep the MT rules system, he might be reconsidering.
     <Excuse me if I\'m asking too much, but I\'m really excited about
trying to get TML and HIWG together as we have more in common than
might be apparent.>  In Chuck Gannon\'s calls to me, he\'s expressed the
same thing.  He\'s astonished at the similarities, yet there\'s almost
no sharing of subscribers/members.  He very much wants to see the two
get together.
                                                                  MIKE

    Thanks for committing to posting the material to the TML, I really
appreciate it.
    I\'ve recieved bundles #1-212 and I\'ve forwarded them to those
who can recieve them, excepting Scott Olson [by the way I didn\'t
make it to the Post Office Friday, so much for plans], and I forgot
that Terry had a MAC, so my IBM disks ahven\'t done him much good yet.
    Is there anybody on the TML who can make the material available
on MAC and Apple II type disks?
    I\'m obviously interested in all the material, Mike would be too
I think, as would Ed Edwards. Clay, Olson and McInnes would be interested
in Starship/Vehicle related material. Clay would be interested in the
economics material, such as it is. Gelinas would be interested in the
TDR (Traveller Done Right), as would most of the rest I think.
    In regards to Economics/number of starships available, you might want
to have the members of the TML look at the starports that can build ships
also, Tim Koors did a spreadsheet taking that into account to see how much
tonnage there might be.

    <TML addresses> Yeah, I\'d be willing to collect them for the
newsletter.

    <GIGATRAVELLER> Yes, definitely, just a working title, just as TDR
is to the TML. Offhand I think the switch to the Twilight 2000 2nd edition
system would be somewhat okay, at least for character generation and
combat, although I\'m not sure about the vehicle combat as such.

    <TML similarities>  Yes, there are a lot of similarities and a lot of
duplication of effort, though we both knew about each other (and more
of them knew about us, then vice versa), there seems to be a big
misunderstanding by them of what HIWG is. What little connection there has
been between HIWG->GEnie and the TML has gone mostly there way. And there\'s
been a lot of duplication of effort and waste of time on there part since
they haven\'t talked to some of us like they could have.
    Of course at the moment I\'m not sure there is a good definition of
what HIWG is, anymore than there is a good definition of what the TML
is.

Bryan that if it becomes a matter of passing personal messages not of

    The person to talk too about maybe having a gateway between the two
would be Scorpia to start off with.  I know GE has the capaability for
gateways, but whether they want to do it or not is another matter.  Offhand
I would expect not offhand, or at least the traffic would be one way
only (from TML to GEnie).

    SS&V (Starports, Starships & Vehicles) is an MT fanzine dedicated
to publishing articles and starship/vehicle designs.  Issues are currently
$1.25 each, with 8 currently available.  It includes one article and the rest
of the pages are devoted to designs.

    Alien Realms is an MT fanzine dedicated to publishing articles that
cover the Alien races in Megatraveller.

    Materials for the above magazines are always desired. The preferred
format is IBM PC 360k or 1.2m disk (because I generally lack the time
to retype material).  In exchange for an article, 4 designs, or one piece
of artwork the author will get a free copy of the magazine upon publication.
The author retains all copyright to the material and is of course free
to see about publishing it elsewhere (a fair amount of the material in both
these magazines are preliminary works where the author wants more feedback
before final publication in another magazine, usually the Traveller\'s
Digest or Challenge).
    Material in Amiga format is also acceptable as is submission via email
through either GEnie (B.Borich), Compuserve, VervanNet (Bryan Borich).

    Okay I recieved that USENET material a couple of weeks ago, given
a year or two i might be able to sort through that material, I wish
even more now that we (HIWG) had easier access to that Net.
    In your last letter to me you offered to forward Bundles to me
as they become available. I would like to take you up on that offer,
if possible I would like to expand that offer if possible. What
I have in mind is that you could provide an Email feed between those
of us on GEnie and those on USENET, maybe a weekly link so it won\'t
take to much of your time? How do you feel about this? There are other
people who have this access so maybe the job could be shared (like
trade weeks or months). For instance I know that Farstar (James Kundert)
is on here and has a feed to USENET.

    You also offered to act as intemediary in my requests for use of
material from their mail in my magazine, if that offer is still
available, I would like to ask the following people to use their
material (I would also like to have their permission to have the material
used in a new Official GDW MT newsletter that is being worked on):

designs, especially if I can use their designs.

    Sorry to ask you another favor, but I promised Hess to do what I could
to promote 2300, and I\'m aware of a couple of people on the TML who are
interested in 2300.
    Also, could you pass this message on to TML members who are interested
in 2300AD (and in rec.games.frp?):

    Clare Hess, Editor of 2300 Resource, an official GDW newsletter on
2300AD is looking for subscribers to this magazine (which I would rate
as very good quality). He is also interested in finding people who are
willing to do what they can to promote 2300AD.
    Subscriptions to this magazine are $8 per year (4 issues). Mail

2300 people I know from TML:

Yngve Larsson <yngve@tigger.softlab.se>
CHOINSKI@env.prime.COM
Joel Lovell <jlovell@smdvx1.intel.COM>

Clare Hess would probably be interested in the 2300 material they\'ve
developed, as of right now however I haven\'t sent him the material these
people have posted to the TML because of possible copyright problems
(I wouldn\'t want to get anybody unintentionally in trouble, though I would
expect it would only happen by accident [and I have seen this happen]).

CLARE, anything you want to add to that (like foriegn sub costs, as I know
one of the parties is located in Isreal, at least I think so).

Carl -
     Bryan has a good idea.  We are starting an MT newsletter for GDW
called IMPERIAL LINES.  We can arrange to have sent out the free
introductory issues to those interested. But we need postal addresses
from people.  It\'d be great if you or someone else could announce it
on TML, collect the addresses, and pass them on to Bryan for now.
(That okay with you, Bryan?)
     Here\'s the skinny on the newsletter, as I wrote it for TIFFANY
STAR.  (TS28 went to paste-up yesterday.)

                            GDW Newsletter
     HIWG is going to do the MegaTraveller newsletter for GDW, to be
called IMPERIAL LINES.  As it looks right now, it\'ll be quarterly, 8
pages, and circulated from GDW.  Geo Gelinas will be chief editor.
     As Geo describes in his 8/13/91 letter to James Maliszewski and
myself, "Other things I would like to put into the newsletter are the
occasional deck plan, perhaps one a year; equipment, but maybe not
placing a single piece of equipment on a single sheet; essays on
various topics; scenarios and news relating to the issue\'s subsector,
somewhat akin to the old amber zone; maybe a cartoon; artwork; and so
forth.  In fact, in many ways it will be like the JOURNAL CLASSIC."
     Although the newsletter probably will not be the official organ
for announcing products, it will include product news.  And, articles
featured in the newsletter will have a nature different from those
in Challenge. We shouldn\'t try to compete with Challenge for articles,
nor can we pay anything for them.
     With this in mind, I think the foremost objective should be to
circulate "orphaned" official or near-official information.  Examples
include material prepared for products but did not get in, the
complete table of sector names, official alien homeworlds, and Second
Survey material.
     The second most important thing is to circulate useful
compilations, i.e. the Traveller Database Project (TDB).  Even if this
material doesn\'t make for good stand-alone magazine articles, it has
much use.  Some of the things John Meyers has circulated are excellent
examples.
     The third is to circulate amateur articles and essays.  The
newsletter might include reprints of the best articles that have
appeared in fanzines, plus new material, such as vehicles from Rob
Prior, and starport or alien essays from Bryan Borich.
     So far, here\'s how Geo is thinking to arrange the posts, although
this is still fluid:
        Chief Editor:         Mark "Geo" Gelinas
        Contributions Editor: Mike Mikesh
        Associate Editors:    John C. Meyers, Dennis Myers, ...

Of course, I\'m sure no one is thinking that will end up its title.

system to Tw2000.  This came out in a recent phone call Marc made to

THE HORDE

The Horde may be the most effective marketing ploy in the history of
human civilization. It is the only known instance of a single coordinated
advertising/marketing/manufacturing campaign turning a large but
unremarkable company into an Imperially recognized megacorporation,
and its fruits are seen and accepted every day by literally trillions
of people across the entirety of known space. To date, the profits it
has netted its originators have been calculated as being enough to 
purchase the fifty most populous and prosperous worlds in the Imperium 
and everything on them... and the cashflow shows no signs of slowing down.

In the early centuries of the Third Imperium, starship travel was both
risky and rare, as the regrowing nation strove, often unsuccessfully,
to assure travellers of easy access to the materials and parts they needed
to keep their ships, which represented their lifelines, in working order.
It was not uncommon (as it is now, in the Rebellion, again becoming 
common) for a ship to be grounded many parsecs from home because a single
part that could not be replaced by local manufacturers was lost or broken.
Even worse, this situation extended to the much more common nonstarships
that were relied upon in every system even when Jump travel was a lost
art, and forgotten until they broke down and caused trouble by their absence.
Imperial military contractors had some degree of standardization in their
gear, but this suffered from sector to sector as Solomani designers in 
firms like GSbAG locked horns with Vilani designers at Sharurshid and refused
to compromise on various design points. This made waging war relatively 
straightforward when the ships fought and were built in the same area, as
in the Frontier Wars, but when ships had to be moved across wider ranges
of the Imperium itself, such as in the chaos of the Civil War in the early
600s, the problems of resupply became hellish. There was no guarantee
that a naval fleet could resupply from a depot of the same Navy! The
situation was ripe for change, technological advances into the realm of TL 12
coming at the same time as turmoil and unrest in the political arena,
and it was only a matter of time before someone saw an opportunity to
make money, and leaped on it in a big way. That someone was a tiny company 
on a planet with unremarkable characteristics but a fair amount of 
historical import, only recently reintegrated into the Third Imperium.
The company was called General SpaceCraft, Inc., and the planet was Terra.

The Horde was conceived of by three young executives working in various 
branches at the General home office on Terra. Their names have been 
forgotten now, except where reverent design engineers and marketing 
strategists have engraved them on their hearts while still in college.
They were led by Peter Broom, an advertising trainee who was already 
showing a killer instinct suitable for a Crested Jabberwock. His two
compatriots were Stewart Provost, an Assistant Technician in R&D, and
Shannon Mills, a newly-employed manager in the Shipwrights\' Division, where
actual ship construction took place. The two hardware men were constantly
harangued by their fellow employees for their shared and rather uncommon
penchant for outlandish schemes for making the firm rich. Broom, however,
knew talent when he saw it, and risked the jeers of his superiors in
Marketing when he began sitting with the pair at lunch in the Executives\'
Cafeteria and listening, first with feigned interest and later with genuine 
enthusiasm, as The Twins (as they were usually called) sketched out
weird profitmaking ideas on placemats and napkins. Broom\'s business aplomb
flattened most of those ideas in the birthing stages, but the others
didn\'t mind: there was a good, WORKABLE idea in there somewhere, and 
sooner or later they\'d find it. And when they did, the Imperium\'s newest
member world was going to give it one hell of a shock.

Their first major breakthrough was the discovery of certain properties of
Tevlac, a plastic recently developed on Warinir and enjoying a fair degree
of popularity among industrial chemists for its sturdiness and easy
machinability. Tevlac, Provost discovered, developed a strong affinity
for temporary molecular rebonding upon fracture lines when stimulated with
a trickle of electric current: it would be broken into pieces, and stick
together along the breaks as long as it was connected to a battery. The 
adhesion wasn\'t much, but it was enough to solve one of the starship
industry\'s biggest headaches-- how to get the little hole that always
remains when an Iris Valve closes up to seal airtight every time. Soon, 
Tevlac valve-seats were in use all over known space, and the patent money
and licensing fees began flowing in. People took notice of Provost\'s 
inventiveness, of the risks Mills took in trying the new technology on the 
line, and Broom\'s aggressive marketing of the idea, and lights began
turning green at higher levels of management.

Mills\'s invention of gravitationally-induced hull fitting, where hulls
were friction-fit for spotwelding by the application of tight antigrav
fields, sped up spaceship hulling by 3%-- not much until one considers the
long haul, where it added up to substantial increases in productivity.
This was adopted over pin-fitting by all Imperial Navy contractors by
order of the Navy in 597. But the real boon, and the discovery that 
got the corporate gears turning, was the development of the RAMKS by Provost
and Mills in 601. Up until that time, the welding and fitting of superdense
hulls was considered an expensive luxury, due to the difficulties in 
getting the impenetrable materials to bond together easily. The RAMKS (an
acronym for Robo-animechaniakatasthyser) was a man-portable device
incorporating fusion and grav technology to induce superfluid states in
confined areas of superdense hullmetal, allowing smooth joins as easily
as two copper pipes could be soldered together with a brazing torch. 
The explosion outward of this technology removed the last vestiges of
resistance from the Board of Directors-- what Broom, Provost and Mills
wanted, by God they got it.

The stage was set for the Horde.

In early 604, the three men, now division directors of a rapidly-expanding
company, politely asked to meet with the President and Board in a closed
session. They had, Broom said mildly, an idea. With the dollar signs
barely hidden by their contact lenses, the Board set up the meeting. It
lasted over fourteen hours, and the written records of the session were
kept sealed for nearly two hundred years. But when the meeting let out,
the President looked twenty years younger, the Board were sweating 
profusely, and the Three Amigos were grinning like the cats that had just 
eaten the canary. The next day, things started moving.

R&D shifted over to component design optimization. Overnight, virtually
all of the R&D division\'s time went into designing structured-modular
avionics and engine control circuitry-- the essential idea being an
interlocking design for electrical and mechanical subsystems with a
stepped degree of throughput based on the Tech Level of each component,
the lowest one in a given subsystem being its least common denominator.
These components were strictly standardized in easily-made forms, and
optimized at Tech Levels ranging from 9 to 13 (the maximum available 
at the time). What this meant was that if a module blew, a TL 11 design
could use a replacement fabricated on a TL 9 world with a positive,
documented understanding of exactly which functions would be limited 
and how. This degree of centralization was unheard of, except perhaps
among the Vilani megacorporations, whose designs were standardized
by default but uniform by Tech Level with little or no crossreferencing.

At the same time, the Shipwrights began building prototype hulls using
techniques easily available over the same spread of Tech Levels. The
main manufacturing areas were divided into a dozen sample field ship
construction areas, with spotwelders hobnobbing with fusioncutters
and RAMKSers and cable-trays next to fiberbundles and infralinkups.
A microcosm of ship construction techniques under one roof, carefully
hidden from the press by a normally-talkative company, began to get
tongues wagging. 

Marketing used the firm\'s past history and future prospects with surgical
precision. Investors eager to cash in on the fledgling firm\'s latest
breakthrough went anywhere from buying shares on speculation to writing
blank development checks. Some of these, like Hortalez et Cie and Antares
Holdings, would later be rewarded with shares in the new company; others,
like Beechcraft Interstellar, would resist going the way of their old
rivals like Cessna and Piper (now a division of GSbAG, which watched the
proceedings with some interest and much discomfort) by merging with General
to profit more directly in what was to come. These were great risks, but as
it turned out, this early risk-taking paid back in incredible measure. The
chaos of the Civil War, which caused a great deal of damage to the Navy and 
the Core sector but had little effect elsewhere, merely served as cover 
for what happened next.

In 609, ships began leaving Terra for parts unknown. Properties were bought
at starports on many worlds, and carefully sealed off from public view,
first hundreds and then thousands of them. The planning had been meticulous--
each property was tiny, and raised little or no speculation on its own.
No one saw the larger pattern until it was far too late to do anything 
about it. By 615, there were worlds from Jewell to Spica with these small
properties on them, and supplies were flowing from local factories to 
stockpiles nearby. The only places deliberately avoided were worlds where
the Sharurshid shippers had a stranglehold on the industry-- the Vilani 
weren\'t even given a whiff of what was about to happen.

In that same year, advertisements began to be posted on thousands of different
worlds, each bearing the same words: "The Horde is Coming." Public speculation
ran riot, and the overtaxed investors, certain that their long wait was about
to bear fruit, held their breath.

On Holiday of 616, the Horde was unveiled simultaneously on every planet
in the campaign. Local investors took one look at the degree of local 
capital involved in the project, and began shoveling money into the 
company\'s gaping maw. Shipping firms read the specs, watched the promo
films, conducted tests of their own, and began buying. The project built
up momentum and never stopped. Its first major victory came in 620, when
Tukera Lines began replacing old craft with the Horde. Soon after that,
the first Tech Level Boost Program, a system for upward compatibility
as the Imperial TL climbed, was announced, and the Imperial Navy and 
Scout Service began using the Horde for non-critical tasks in thousands
of backwater bases and fringe areas. The final victory came over twenty
years later, when Sharurshid purchased the license fees to begin building
the Horde itself, and the Vilani megacorporation completed what is now
taken for granted as the base standardization of non-milspec ship parts
in the Imperium and surrounds. Broom, Provost and Mills were rather older
by then, but they were present on Vland when the agreement was signed,
and they were present before the throne of Arbellatra a year later when
the Limited Imperial Charter was granted to the new megacorporation of 
General Products, LIC.

And what, precisely, WAS the Horde? Let me give as an explanation the words
of Peter Broom, taken from that first board meeting:

"Gentlemen, people are sick and tired of being strangled by the inability
to rely on standardizations when they travel. No one will agree to a set
of standards-- they have to be RAMMED down the shipping industry\'s
collective THROAT. What we are proposing here is not a glamorous action,
or even one that will be remembered, oh, five hundred years from now. What
we are about to do will lay so basic a foundation for the construction
and support of starships and orbital-support spacecraft along accepted 
and standardized lines, that our designs and parts will not only be a
household word in a decade or two, but in a century the Vilani will have
caved in as well, and in TWO centuries people will have largely forgotten
that there ever WASN\'T a standard! When people of the year 1100 pick up
a copy of "Traveller: Science-Fiction Gaming in the Distant Past," and
read about the spaceship designs that were just becoming standard when
the Imperium was cracking under its own inertia and those upstarts from
Earth who\'d been in the Imperium for less than twenty years were turning
things on their collective EAR.... I want them to read about OUR designs."

And so it has been. Although General Products has taken a lot of flak
recently for its starship designs, its spacecraft, now manufactured
under subcontract by every shipping firm in the Imperium to some degree 
or another, are so standard as to have been forgotten... and the industry
has upgraded them as the Tech Level advances, so that they are now on
the market from TL9 to TL16, with TL17 designs on the way. 

Or, in game-design terms--

We the designers (Scott Kellogg and Rob Dean) and the storyteller/historian
(metlay his-SEFF) are proud to ceremoniously dump upon the TML community
a collection of standardized and Imperially accepted "norm" designs for
non-Jumping support craft of every type, guaranteed to work better at
all TLs than the designs written up in the MT rules and to serve in each
and every campaign that requires a TL-appropriate "vanilla ship" for
any purpose at all....

THE HORDE!

Launch TL9-17

     The launch is a minimal small craft intended for utility space to space 
operations, as well as light cargo and personnel landing.  Most of the launch-
es shown below have a loaded wieght based on the maximum load that can be 
given a 1-G acceleration.  If manueverability is not an issue (as with space 
to space transfer work), the cargo holds can be fully loaded with a reduction 
in acceleration.

In regard to the rule requiring the forfeiture of a shot for each sensor
task beyond the first:

Yes, that rule is actually in the Ref\'s Manual.  I agree that it doesn\'t
seems like it should work very well -- but ofcourse, we already know about
the extensive editing on the MT rulebooks, right? :)

I understand the concept of forfeiting a shot in return for taking the time
to do some more sensor scans, but I don\'t think that that rule works
well for that.  I toyed with the concept of using a "scout escort" covered
with sensors to feed scan information to a EMS-active silent fleet.  The
idea was to keep from exposing the important ships to automatic sensor
locks while allowing them to use the data from the escort.  The problem
is, you need to install a LARGE number of weapons on a ship in order to
get a large number of sensor tasks.  Unarmed ships only get two sensor
tasks.  Even if you have a giant crew of sensor operators.  To me, this
makes little sense.  And if you need to defend the escort from incoming fire,
you need to put extra weapons on it for defense.

What if you put laser rifles on the ship?  They don\'t even take up turret
space.  Do you get to do the subtraction from those "batteries" instead of
the main weaponry?  (Probably not, it would be a silly work-around, but
they _are_ weapons...and you\'d still get to shoot them if you can\'t use
them for sensor tasks!)

The idea to involve the computer makes sense, and maybe skills of the ship
commander and the sensor operator should play a role; faster identification
and orders to fire control about targets would help more of the batteries
have a chance to fire for effect.  Any more ideas out there?

   On ammunition: The ammunition used in these these weapons is somewhat
standardzed. All calibers are pure metric calibers in millimeters, only the
Solomani use the inch based calibers common on old Terra (with one exception,
see the 9mm Magnum Revolver below). Originally Imperial forces used the old
classic calibers like 5.56mm, .357 and 9mm Parabellum, but following the
creation of the new dress code, Emperor Styryx issued a directive that all
Imperial acquisitions of new weapons had to be pure metric caliber weapons. It
was enforced by patching the software used by the Imperial Ministry of Defence
so that it didn\'t accept any decimals in the calibre. With the Imperium only
buying pure metric weapons, the major defence contractors soon followed and
redone their whole line to the new standard. This new standard was still
gradually making it\'s apperance fifty years later during the Solomani Rim War,
and some analysts claim that the less than optimum performance of some Imperial
units during the ground campaign on Terra was due to ammunition incompatibility
between regular and colonial forces, the latter which hadn\'t upgraded to the new
ammunition.
   The "I" designation for pure metric calibers originated within the
Intersellarms Megacorp - the official name was "P" for "Pure", but that usually
got confused with the Solomani "Parabellum". Witty sophonts use to claim that
the "I" now used by viritually everyone don\'t mean "Imperial" as Interstellarms
claims but "Interstellarms".
   While all pure metric caliber types of ammunition produced by Interstellarms
is called "I" there are a small number of other letters for ammunitions usually
associated with a specific service, like the "N" for the Navy line of snub
pistols and "M" for the IMCs 9mm Magnum.
   Techlevel is indicated by appending "-TL" after the ammunitions name.
5x10mmRI-7 AP is thus a techlevel 7 5x10mm Imperial armor piercing round for a
revolver. Extraimperial orgin use standard designations such as \'Da\' and \'Zh\'.

   On discounts: They are as given in good old \'Mercenary\', ie on Pop 9+ worlds,
guns and ammo can be had at a discount. Guns are packed in cases of 20 (assume
that weapons in cases weigh 25% more and are 100% larger than normal). Buying a
full case will give 20% discount, 5 cases 40% and 50 cases for 60%. For ammo
those limits are 20, 100 and 1000 cases. Most cases are further divided into
paper or plastic boxes with each box containing enough for one magazine full.
For guns with small magasines (less than 30) one box generally contains 50
rounds.

   Remember that it\'s easier to buy many (over a thousand) weapons than just a
handful, because most manufacturers are more used to dealing with large
entities.

   On attenuation: Some weapons are of so low power that they have an
penetration/attenuation listed as 0/2. In those cases halve *damage* after each
two range bands.

   On compatibility: When using weapons and ammunition of different techlevels,
the combination will behave as the worst of them. In some cases, hightech
ammunition will lead to higher chanses of malfunction but this is detailed in
the text on each weapon.

   All prices are in local credits as defined in Striker. TL G didn\'t exist back
then so I have added it and expanded on the lower end. The local credits concept
means that, due to lower demand of their goods compared to the high tech worlds
of the imperium, low tech backwaters have weaker currencies than high tech trade
hubs. The concept of local credits don\'t seem to be around anymore, but on the
other hand, I haven\'t seen it explicitly discarded either:)

Revolver 9mm Magnum

   Although officially pure metric, the 9x22mmRM ammunition is in reality of
.357 caliber. The IMC managed to protect it from the metric purification of the
weapons by claiming that the revolver wasn\'t a weapon but a part of the uniform.
It is further notable as being the only widely available revolver that have
versions made at high techlevels. Due to recoil purposes the higher techlevel
models have different amounts of waste weight (TL12 50g, TL13 160g, TL14 280g,
TL15 420g, TL16 570). Full ammunition compatibility between all techlevels was
one of the original design requirements and it has been fulfilled despite the
fact that they originally only covered techlevels 5 to 13. 9x22mmRM ammunition
appear in cases of 1000, (Lead: 3.3liters 17kg Cr233) (AP: 3.3liters 12kg Cr470)

   THE SEVEN TOP REASONS NOT TO VISIT THE KATERI SYSTEM.

   Featured Weapons: 20mm Pistol
                     20mm SMG
                     20mm Assaultrifle
                     10mm Caseless Assaultrifle
                     10mm Caseless 6-barrel Gatling Gun
                     21000Joule Laser "Rifle"
                     38000Joule Laser "Rifle"

   In Challenge #31, F L Cain wrote about the various troubles a 55cm long 
race would have with weapons technology as compared to the standard 180cm 
Humaniti. In essence the conclusion was that \'small arms\' is a variable term 
when applied to different races, and smaller mass means that all weapons has 
to be lighter and with lower stopping power.

   A larger race would thus have an advantage over Humaniti, and an extreme 
example on this is the Brinn of Kateri (Corridor 2238 C8C0885-8. It\'s most 
notable feature is it\'s cyanide polluted methane-hydrogene atmosphere). The 
Brinn are ten-limbed, 1.2ton spider-like sophonts about as militant as the 
Virushi are pacifistic. They are currently engaged in a genocidal war against 
all neighbours. And the fact that their weapons can weight ten times as much 
as the comparable standard weapon isn\'t exactly helping the Humaniti side...
   (Brinn: Traveller Digest 12, pg 18-24)

   On Lasers: The DV of a laser is multiplied by two in a manner similar to 
that used for plasma and fusion guns (although their DV was multiplied by ten) 
in Greg Porters article. The multiplier for lasers is not in that article, but 
it is essential to make laser weapons similar to those in Traveller.

   On Smartguns: All smartguns has enough batteries to power all electronics 
in them for 4 hours. Recharge cost is neglible.

   New Ammo: Flechette ammo is a large number of metal arrows. Cannister is a
fancier name for shotgun ammo:)

Pistol 20mm

   This pistol has a very heavy grip and coarse trigger that enables it to be 
used by the taloned second set of limbs. The ammunition it is called 
20x54mmBr-8 by the Imperium but it\'s certainly not sold anywhere - the only 
way to get it is to go to Kateri and \'liberate\' some, but here are the data 
for it anyhow: Cases hold 1000 rounds, (Lead: 40liters 186kg Cr646) (HP:

weapons. (DS: 40liters 85kg Cr1938) (APDS: 40liters 85kg Cr3876)

SMG 20mm

   Using the same ammunition as the 20mm pistol, this SMG is the primary 
weapons of lightly armed Brinn militia units. Grip and trigger are done 
similarly to the pistol. Ammunition data is found above. Since this weapon is 
used by the militia, no TL9 DS or APDS have been issued to it, but it would 
presumably work with it.

Assaultrifle 20mm

   "It\'s like looking into the barrel of an autocannon. Our guys was decked 
out in combat, but they shot right through it, with tech-8 small arms!" one 
marine that fought during the storming of Divad Starport said about the 
mainstay of the regular Brinn forces: the 20mm Assaultrifle. The stock of this 
weapon is concave and designed to fit around the front of the dorsal sensor 
cluster while the weapon is suspended by one of the clawed arms, manipulated 
by the first pair and the user sights over it. This means that the Brinn only 
can fire within the front quarter and at an elevation of less than 30 degrees. 
The ammunition is called 20x115mmBr-8 and comes in cases of 500, (Lead:

Assaultrifle 10mm Caseless

   This is the top reason never to go to to Kateri: The 10mm Assaultrifle 
issued in 1119. It fires 10x101mmClsBr-9 ammunition of several types, but the 
big difference between it and it\'s large caliber TL8 cousin is that it is a 
smartweapon. Togeather with the long barrer and the innovative design it gives 
a +5 to hit versus humans (+3 from the sensors, +2 from design/barrel). It 
also incorporates gyrostabilization and electronic sights. The IMC (Real 
Strephon) first encountered an example of it in an destroyed ship and evaluated
it as "Suffering from severe featuritis, will probably develop glitches in a 
real combat environment.". This evaluation was changed to "Extremely effective 
for it\'s techlevel." when it was encountered in combat. It\'s mounting is 
superficially similar to that of the 20mm Assaultrifle, but it really is more 
advanced by far. The gun back end is coupled to a ring around the armor cupola 
over the sensor cluster where it can be traversed 90 degrees to each side and 
elevated up to 80 degrees. The ammunition comes in cases of 5000 rounds,

Gatling Gun 10mm Caseless

   Not very widely issued, the 10mm caseless Gatling was an experiment with 
caseless ammunition on techlevel 8. The Imperium calls the ammunition 
10x88mmClsBr-8. In usage, the weapon is mounted on a suspended arm from the 
body and manipulated with both of the first pair of arms. The ammunition comes 
via a chute from a box on the body. A case consists of 5 complete loaded feed-
boxes (5000 rounds), (Lead: 81liters 166kg Cr10765) (HP: 81liters 166kg

   DS and APDS hasn\'t been issued except on a purely experimental basis. The

21000Joule Laser "Rifle"

   This is the primary weapon for the Brinn space force boarding and security 
crews. It has aquired a nasty reputation because of the Brinn practice of 
using the beam setting to cut down defending troops and non-combatants alike. 
Each round of fire on the beam setting is equal to 3 shots. The pack is worn 
on the body and the squat gun is mounted on one of the second pair of 
appendages in a manner similar to the arm-mounted laser rifle used on many 
Imperial battledresses.

38000Joule Laser "Rifle"

   A more powerful and advanced version of the 21000 Joule laser, this weapon 
has not yet been encountered by the Imperium. Sofar, it has only been used on 
an experimental basis in a few boardings of isolated ships leaving no 
survivors. A decision to start producing it in numbers for elite boarding 
crews was taken by the Council of Valor in 256-1121. The weapon has electronic 
sights and uses the same smartgun sensor suite as the 10mm Caseless 
Assaultrifle, giving a +3 to hit versus Humans. Each round of fire on the beam 
setting is equal to 2 shots. The pack is worn on the body and the squat gun is

Through the efforts of Joe Heck, metlay, and Mark Cook, we now have some
relatively new, updated DGP Imperium Sector Data on the sunbane ftp site
(129.100.100.12).  I reorganized the sectors directory so that there is
now a dgp-original directory containing the old sector data (26
sectors), and a dgp-updated directory containing largely updated and new
material (35 sectors).  The updated data is freely distributable and
originated from the offices of DGP.  Of course, it is getting more and
more out of date with each new MT release.  Here\'s the README from the
pub/traveller/sectors directory:

MEGATRAVELLER SECTOR DATA

This directory contains sector data for the Traveller Imperium.  There
are two subdirectories in the sector data directory:

dgp-original    26 Sectors; this is the original sector data as
                submitted to GEnie by Digest Group Publications.  It
                contains a mixture of pre- and post-rebellion data.

dgp-updated     35 sectors; this is updated sector data provided by

left the sleepy berg of Hillsboro.  Here\'s a quick synopsis
of what to expect in the next few weeks.

1.  ***ALL***, I repeat  ALL  PBEM address will be different
    this year.  Dan Corrin has graciously consented to use
    uso.ca as a combination broadcast/forward/archive site.
    James Perkins has agreed to monitor address aliases (since 
    I so thoroughly proved my incompetence).

    Installation of the list is scheduled for next week, with
    testing to follow.  With luck, we should have a list of
    usable character names and lists for you to use by about
    the beginning of October.  Additionally, we will probably
    have a "pbem911@somesite" adress for pbem-related out-of-
    game (e-mail type) emergencies.

    When testing is done, we\'ll probably broadcast something
    and request a reply, to verify a complete circuit.

2.  With the amount of additional time I now have (and it is
    quite a lot -- thanks, guys), I\'m actually working on the
    historical recap of the game to date that I promised
    as an intro to turn 91.0.

3.  Turns now have (yet) another official numbering scheme.
    This one will probalby stick around a while.  First
    two digits are season of play, in Gregorian year (i.e.
    the turn starting this fall begins 91.  The trun starting
    next fall begins 92.)  All succeeding numbers are
    non-negative intergers, in increasing order, beginning
    with 0.  If we have to amend a turn it will become some
    thing like "BPEM turn 91.13a".    Trivial stuff, I know.
    But necessary.

4.  If you have any comments, complaints, or suggestions for
    improvements or changes, let me know right away.  If you
    want to play, let me know right away and cc James, so 
    we can more quickly verify your address.

Happy playing.

    'topic' => 'The Horde',
    'body' => 'Hi folks,

Now that the word is out on what the Horde actually is I thought I should
say a few things about the design.

I tried to get the flavor of the old book 2 small craft into the Horde.
Thus there will be appearing (when Rob is finished editing my designs)
all of the small craft from that ancient text with the exception of the
standard fighter.    (If there is a request for one I will make one up)

All the craft have sufficient controls for the mounting of a turret.

I allowed sufficient controls for a triple turret installation.
Please note that installing a laser will severely reduce the maximum thrust
]
available because the laser is drawing power normally allocated to the
engines.  In most cases there is sufficient power output in the fusion
plant to power only one laser, where there is a 500MW reactor, there are
sufficient controls for two beam lasers and a missile rack.
In cases where there is less than 250MW the installation may not mount lasers
but may mount up to three missile racks.

In the majority of the cases there is only sufficient power for one laser
in these cases a triple turret may be mounted with a beam laser and two
missile racks.  (A pulse laser and sandcasters require fewer controls so
they are no problem.)

In all cases the addition of a laser will reduce the engine performance
rather drastically.  But if a single laser is installed, no design\'s engine
performance will fall below 1G.

The exception to this is the shuttle.  If 2 lasers are put in the shuttle,
the engines will NOT funtion.

As to the agility of the craft.  Well in almost all cases, there is No
power left over after all the systems are powered.  (Much to Rob\'s
annoyance I specified the engine output to eight significant figures which
means the engine size was accurate down to the cubic centimeter level)
He has since edited out this little practical joke)

If you believe that agility comes from "excess" power then all the designs
have agility zero.  But of course in combat, the pilot will use the
emergency agility and the agility goes back to the listed figure.
(Historical note:  The agility debate of a month ago or so started when Rob
and I began trying to agree on how to calculate the agilities for the
Horde.  Our concencus was sent to the TML, and that is what I used in the
designing of the Horde.)

Another note if you wish to arm your small craft:  There is no volume set
aside for a turret.  Any turret would presumably be added on to the ships
total volume, while fixed mounts would be subtracted from the cargo space.
Since Hangers for small craft are 130% the size of the craft I wouldn\'t see
much of a problem in dockin arising out of the increase in volume.
Pop turrets would of course be subtracted from interior volume (cargo space)

Fuel notes:  Most craft have a duration of 15 days.  That should be sufficient
for most interplanetary operations.  If you want more, use the rules in the
ref\'s manual for installing collapsable or demountable fuel tanks.

Sensors:  At TL9 EMS is not available.  Thus I tried to make up for it with
what I thought an interplanetary craft might require as a minimum.  All
weather radar (planetary range)  A radar direction finder for tuning in on
another planets navigation beacons during interplanetary flights, And (since
there are no telescopes in the sensor section) I put in a light Amplification
sensor to allow you to track your destination (presumably a planet)
At TL 10 and 11 EMS systems are so large (read expensive) I put in a
continental range Passive system.  If you can\'t see a PLANET with a continenta
l range system well... The haven\'t described a continental system very well
have they?  (For heavens sake you can see em with binoculars!)  Anyway, I don\'t
see this sub stitution as being a problem.

The prices on the ships do not include architects fees (It is a standard craft
after all)  But neither do they contain the 20% discount for the large
number of craft produced.  Players buying it out of the showroom will be
(or might be) subject to this discount.  They have after all been produced in
LARGE numbers therefore the discount will normally apply.

TL 16?  TL 17?  Well, that was kind of a joke...  I just wanted to see what would happen.  I briefly played with the anti-matter powerplants, but they would
have made the craft enormously expensive to fuel.  (Not to mention difficult)
Stick with fusion, if you get a fuel hit, your ship doesn\'t vaporize!

>From what I see a TL 21 small craft should perform virtually identically as the
TL 17 one.  The weight and volume of the electronics is the only thing that changes in the craft (as they are set up)  {NO I DON\'T PLAN TAKING THESE THINGS UP
TO TL 21!!!}

I hope they are useful to you all.

  Zhodani?!?!

  The only Traveller language it might be remotely similar to would be 
Sworldworldian (Swordworldsron? Sworldworldish? Swordish? Swordfish? :)

  "So, what does your .sig mean?"

  "It\'s a Swedish thing, you wouldn\'t understand."

  "Try me!"

  "It\'s a Swedish thing, you wouldn\'t understand."

  "How do you know before you tell me?!"

wouldn\'t understand\':)"

No complaints normally, but celebrating a June event in September?  Imagine

  On real-world terra there is a profusion of last names in many languages.
Most of them means something but most of the time the name is treated like a
label which only meaning comes from what it indicates. The names Smith, 
King, and Thatcher comes to mind, because most people don\'t think "Aha, one
that makes horseshoes, a monarch, and one that fixes roofs." when they hear 
those names.

  It seems that, if given time, titles (even job-related) transforms into names.
Witness all the \'Baron\' and \'Kahn\' running around as some kind of proof of this.
My question is: Does this trend continue? Will the last names \'Chairman\', 
\'Manager\' and \'President\' make their appearance some time?

If so, the Snub pistol has changed drastically since I (or my character,
at least) used it in Olde Traveller.  It got the name "snub" by having
a very short barrel, was very low velocity, and fired several different
types of ammo, mostly illegal on most planets by being either explosive
or gas.  It was also low recoil, which made it great for shipboard
security (where you didn\'t have to worry about minor details like local
laws).  The Beretta 92F is an example of what Striker calls a "9mm
auto pistol".  :-)

> The primary problem with Traveller equipment (ALL equipment, except
> vehicles and ships) is that there is only ONE version of everything.

Now for the important part of this message.  I also didn\'t like this, and
came up with a quick and simple solution.  The following table gives
modifications made to the standard guns listed in the books:

Code	Ammo/clip	Accuracy	Price
- ----
1	    -		   -		-15%
2	    -		   0		-5%
3	    -		   +		+5%
4	    0		   -		-10%
5	    0		   0		0
6	    0		   +		+10%
7	    +		   -		-5%
8	    +		   0		+5%
9	    +		   +		+15%

Amount by which to alter ammo capacity:
Revolver		+/- 1 round in the chamber

Shotgun			- means single or double-barrelled
			+ means 10 round magazine

Rifle			+/- 5 rounds

Auto pistol		-50%, +20% of the standard capacity

Auto/assault rifle	+/- 30% of the standard capacity

LAG			+/- 1 round

Energy weapons		+/- 20% (weapons with "infinite" capacity
			only use codes 4-6, variation being meaningless)

Crew served weapons	+/- 20%


I implemented alterations in accuracy by altering the range bands by
+/- 10%.

So, a standard 9mm auto pistol as listed in Striker Book 3 has a
magazine capacity of 15, effective range of 10m, long range of 40m,
and extreme range of 90m.  (Which is ludicrous - my air pistol can do
better than that - but it will do for this example.)  A code 7 pistol
has a + on ammo, so 15 + 20% = 18; it also has a - on accuracy, which
for those figures really does nothing to the effective and long ranges,
but brings the extreme range down to 80m.  (Striker worked on a 1/1000
scale, and the ranges are all listed in the book as integer values of
cm.  Unless you want to measure things to millimetre precision, which
the authors apparently did not want to do, this simply changes the
extreme range on the game table from 9cm to 8cm.)  The standard 9mm
auto pistol costs Cr200; the code 7 version costs Cr190.

In addition, I had other options which could be added at the GM\'s leisure.
These are summed up in the following table:

Code letter	Meaning					Price alteration
- ----
    Jn		DM +n to jam				-n*5%
    S		Stock available.  On pistols, this	+10%
		doubles the range; on longarms, it
		is a folding stock.
    +		Weapon exceptionally suited to the	0 (or GM\'s choice)
		PC.  +1 DEX when firing.
    -		Weapon exceptionally uncomfortable
		for the PC.  -1 DEX.
    B		Barrel extension available.  Usually	+10%
		only for pistols.  +20% range.
    F		Flash eliminator available.		+10%
    NF		No flash eliminator - applies only	-Cr50
		to military weapons where one would
		be expected as standard.
    Si		Silencer can be fitted.			Cr10

The prices above only mean that something has been done to the weapon
to make fitting an accessory possible, e.g. threading the barrel tip for
a barrel extension or silencer.  The accessories themselves cost extra:
most are listed in the MT Imperial Encyclopedia.  The pistol barrel
extension costs 10% of the price of the pistol itself.  Alternatively,
it may be a whole replacement barrel, costing 20% of the price of the
pistol.

The Jn option (GM\'s option, not PC\'s!) referred back to the fact that in
my games, a natural 2 meant the gun had jammed - except that if the gun
had a J1 code, a natural 2 or 3 would do it.  No-one ever used a J2 gun!
Something similar can be worked out for the task system, using the J code
number as a modifier on the mishap table.

I got the idea of the barrel extension from Gordon Dickson\'s "Tactics of
Mistake".  It would probably be most practical on a snub pistol, because
of that weapon\'s lower propellant pressure.

> Now - in Traveller we only have "10mm Auto." What about a "Intellarms
> S-56 10mm Auto with gyrostabilizer?" Or a "BendArCo 23dm double magazine
> 10mm?" Or "Causative XMH-242 8mm, gyrostab, integral bipod, laser
> rangefinder and designator?"

A bipod on a pistol?  Novel idea, but I don\'t know if it would sell.  :-)

GDW will introduce Star Viking at the next GenCon.(August) This will
cause a very BIG background change. The story goes something like this,
one of the guy(don\'t know which one yet) wants to gain the throne,
so he created a computer virus. It works well, too well actually.
It freezed all the big useful computers, including his own. Thus, 
we experience a big drop in the tech level. FTL is still possible however. 
But the overall tech level is down. 

Then, around the end of the year, GDW will intrdouce the next 
revision of Traveller. Not MegaTraveller, not GigaTraveller,
but Traveller the revision. [I\'ve always thought MegaTraveller is
a silly name.] The system will be changed so it\'s compatible with
TW2000 the 2nd edition, Dark Conspiracy, etc. Because GDW has decided to
use TW2000 2nd edition rules as the offical house system now.
The work on Traveller the revision has started, barely but started.
The developered is headed by Chuck Gannon, who is also the Traveller
editor for the Challenge magazine. And remember how terrible 
the rulebook as far as proof reading goes in MT? This won\'t happen
again, apprently they\'ve changed and got rid of all those people
that\'s responsbile for that proof reading. Also, they promised
better support. There will not be any involement from outside
groups like the last time, from what I heard. It seems GDW will
do this one in house, so I guess both HIWG and DGP won\'t be
connected to it unlike the last time. DGP is probably devoting
its entire resource to A.I. anyhow.

You\'re missing an important point: those last names came out of the
practice of naming people by profession, ie- John the Archer, Lars the
Smith, and Tim the Enchanter :)

People just dropped the \'the\' after awhile. 

It\'s one type of common naming techniques.

Others-
animals- "john Bearclaw"
actions- "john runner-over-water"
descriptive- "john redeye"
parental- "john ericson" < "john eric\'s son"
clan- "john O\'Henry" < "john of the Henries" (mac and mc I assume are
similar, but from Gaelic)
professional- "john carpenter" < "john the carpenter"

Remarks:	The Derrida M is the most common Zhodani trader
encountered in the Spinward Marches and Ikar sectors (Foreven for
you Deaf Imperials)  It is made to look identical to the Consular
Navy fleet observer.  The traders are often sold at a discount to
merchants doing business with the lying, stealing deadheads.  In
this way the real fleet observers are given a bit more
annonymity.
	The ship\'s fuel tanks have a gravitic holographic system
installed for half of their volume.  By creating a pattern of
interfering gravitic waves, the tanks can be made to appear to
contain fuel where there is in fact cargo.  The layout of the
standard trader is identical to that of the fleet observer.  This
results in a \'lost\' volume of 121Kl where electronic equipment is
\'missing\'.  This volume is distributed around the ship in an
effort to conceal it.  In the standard trader this volume is
sometimes used for smuggling, but most often merely contains
electronic spares so as to read identical to the fleet observer
on densiometer scans.

Remarks:	The Derrida QM is a fleet shadow.  It is most often
found in Imperial space conducting operations as a \'Harmless
trader\' There is almost always (87.56%) a Derrida conducting
\'trade\' at the major Imperial naval bases.  It is said that the
Imperial fleet admirals feel naked without their Derrida
following at a descreet distance.
	On more than one occasion, Derrida observers have been
instrumental in rescuing Imperial Naval personnel.  There was the
famous case in 1103 when the ISS Stag (a Gazelle class close
escort) suffered a main engine failure while descending to skim
from a gas giant.  With the fleet out of range and no time to
lose, the Dzojarr, a Derrida observer responded to the distress
call and was able to rescue the crew before the ship burned up. 
The crew of the Dzojarr were awarded the Starburst for Extreme
Heroism.
	As noted above, the fleet observer has an additional 121Kl
of electronics aboard.  This is distributed evenly around the
ship to prevent identification.  The gravitic hologram system is
in place as above.
	The Imperial designation "Trawler" comes from old history
but it\'s derivation is not fully understood.

What is an elephant gun?  What type of ammunition does it use?

The hunting rifle as listed in Trav does not seem to be up to

Orwell shooting an elephant)

According to him, firing a large number of rounds with a normal
rifle did little harm to the elephant compared with the
elephant gun.

		First there was Glasnost, now Perestroika...

Hello fellow PBEMers! It\'s always been a major chore for everyone in the
PBEM to maintain their own copy of the PBEM aliases.  Richard and I were
discussing this one day via email with Dan Corrin.  I opened my mouth
just a little too far and offered to maintain a set of aliases for
Richard and everyone else on the PBEM.  Richard, being no fool, refused
to let me get out of it, so after a couple weeks of struggling, late
hours, and poking and prodding, I am proud to announce the new PBEM
mailing list!

If you:
	1) are a PBEM player, and
	2) recieve this in the TML digest, and
	3) do not recieve a copy of this as personal mail, then
	4) send mail to pbem-request@engrg.uwo.ca.

N   N OOOOO TTTTT EEEEE	
NN  N O   O   T   E      ::
N N N O   O   T   E      ::	THIS DOES NOT MEAN THE PBEM HAS
N  NN O   O   T   EEE		STARTED UP YET - IT\'S JUST MORE

N   N O   O   T   E      ::	BEEN BLESSED BY RICHARD AS OFFICAL.
N   N OOOOO   T   EEEEE  ::

To mail to everyone on the PBEM, send email to: pbem@engrg.uwo.ca.  I
forsee this alias as being the most frequently used for most pbem
traffic.  This single alias causes distribution to the three-dozen or so
PBEM members.  It also makes sure that Richard gets a copy, and deposits
a copy of the mail in an archive file where I can get to it on sunbane.
You are now freed of having to worry what people\'s addresses are and who
has joined or left the PBEM.  Now it\'s my problem :-).

If you have a question or dialogue for Richard (the PBEM Referee) alone,
you can send it to pbemref@engrg.uwo.ca.

If you have an email address change, you can mail it to
pbem-request@engrg.uwo.ca.  Richard and I only will recieve this mail.

If you have an email emergency (like PBEM mail is going to the wrong
mailbox, or someone has noticed all this PBEM mail and is going to,
heaven forbid, yank your email account), send mail to
pbem911@engrg.uwo.ca.  This alias (named after the telephone distress
line popular in the United States) will send email to Dan Corrin,
Richard, metlay, and myself and one of us can do an emergency patch to
alleviate the problem.

If you want to reach a specific character, you no longer need worry what
the email address of that character is! You just mail to
pbem<character>@engrg.uwo.ca.  For example, Commander Ger is
pbemger@engrg.uwo.ca, and Bhyarrvouf is pbemvouf@engrg.uwo.ca.  Here\'s
the definitive list of all the character aliases:

	pbemabuko         pbemferdy         pbemmerwe         pbemsilvmane      
	pbemaiwi          pbemfrieder       pbemmorser        pbemsokoku

	pbemdevious       pbemiasic         pbemralf          pbemwitfield      
	pbemdezierd       pbemjett          pbemredd          pbemwrinkley

	pbemeihoftyah     pbemlimner        pbemseverin       pbemlisteners     
	pbemfarouk        pbemmahlel        pbemshrike        

Again, mail to any one of these addresses will be forwarded to the
player playing the character (pbemlisteners is a special case, and
covers two people listening in on the activites, but not involved in
play).  Also, for GM purposes, a copy of the email will go to Richard,
and another will be filed in an private archive summary file.

In the case of players who have lost their e-mail access, or have left
the playing field temporarily or permanently (example: the character
Much T\'B\'Dezierd), they still have a character alias (pbemdezierd), but
the mail is forwarded to Richard instead of the original player.  This
mechanism allows for easy temporary suspension, too (Dr.  Werner,
pbemwerner, played by Ron Abramson, has been temporarily redirected to
Richard Johnson).

There are also aliases for several large subgroups of characters.  These
are:

	pbemaslan	all aslan
	pbemralphan	all on ralpha
	pbemskaad	all turnskaad employees
	pbemshuttle	all on command shuttle
	pbemtalisman	all on talisman
	pbempaladin	all on paladin
	pbemalcyon	all on alcyon
	pbemaurora	all on aurora
	pbemphin	all phins
	pbem		everyone in the pbem
	pbemall		ditto. everyone in the pbem

So, for example, if I wanted to inform everyone in the PBEM of Charyn
Robins\' (my character) activities, I would mail it to pbem@engrg.uwo.ca.
If she had a matter only for people on the Paladin starship, where she
is Nav/Comm, I will mail to pbempaladin@engrg.uwo.ca.  If she was having
a very private discussion with the Dr.  Christian Van Der Merwe, I\'ll
mail it to pbemmerwe@engrg.uwo.ca.  And lastly, if I had a question for
Richard alone, I\'d mail it to pbemref@engrg.uwo.ca.

Well, speaking as an ex-Marine with lots o\' hunting experience with
a *HUGE* variety of weapons, and rabid NRA member (whatever that\'s
got to do with anything), here goes. :-)

The above description is fairly accurate.  The question is not one
of velocity, but of slug mass (and big kenetic energy, as a result).
While something like a 30-06 is usually considered an adequate hunting
rifle for most types of big game (up to and including Kodiak and Polar
bears), it would take an extremely well placed shot (maybe several) to
drop an African elephant or water buffalo.  The problem is tha the
animals vital organs are so deep in the body that the must generate a
massive trauma on surface impact to have any stopping power.  An .-06
wound would probably kill the elephant eventually, but not before it
ran over both the hunter and the Range Rover he fired from. :-)

For *really* big game, enthusiasts use something like a .458 Winchester
Magnum (Ruger No. 3 Tropical rifle) or a .460 Weatherby Magnum.  Around the
turn of the century, one of the popular African big game rounds available
(although hard to find today) was the Holland & Holland .600 Nitro Express.
The shells were as big as cigars and the slug was the size of your thumb.
On impact, they created hideous pie plate-sized wounds.  Hydrostatic shock
and massive blood loss usually dropped the animal in it\'s tracks.
Supposedly, these rounds could split a water buffalo\'s skull (30-06 rounds,
on the other hand, have been known to ricochete).  If fired at a human
being, a Nitro Express slug would leave a bloody neck stump after a
head-shot, and if fired at the torso, could potentially tear a person
in half if the spine were struck.

I don\'t have my MT rules here at work, but I\'d probably give the
H&H round a PEN of about 8 or 9, and a Dmg. in the range of 6 to 7.

One final note: the H&H .600 Nitro Express only fires 2 shots before
reloading (it looks like a double-barreled shotgun and reloads the
same way).  The Ruger No. 3 Tropical rifle, chambered for the .458
Winchester Magnum is a single-shot weapon with a rolling block
reload.  The .460 Weatherby Magnum is a 3-shot bolt-action.  All
three have a terrible recoil (although the Weatherby *does* have
a very nice recoil pad).  I\'d probably rule that any MT character
with either a STR or CON of less than 8 would be knocked over by
the kick (or at least make it a Formidable task to stay on their
feet).

Well Yet Another Traveller Revision.....

While I will be the first to jump out and say that GDW needs to get its
act together vis a vis MT or Traveller. I am annoyed at their "universe
tinkering". The rules badly need revision ( and proof reading) but this
rumored change will leave nothing of the old Traveller behind. 

And what about us die hard Travellers do we have to shell out another
30-40 for a new update which will be revised in another 6 mths. Do we
get a refund for Ships of the Shattered Imperium or the old rule books,
kind of like a trade in.

I have a nagging suspicion that GDW\'s promises of a clean product will be
unkept. 

My 2 credits.

	Well, I have my suspicion too. But GDW has really improved
from what I have seen, juding by the year of 91. GDW\'s rule used to
be ill proof-read, ill play-tested. MT is a good example, the first edition
of TW2000 is another good example. Not to mention stuff like the MT
sharship of SI. 

	But their recent products have imporved quite a bit. If the proof
read level is anything like TW2000 the 2nd edition, or Dark Conspiracy,
I\'d been very happy. 

	BTW, the revision is not due till the end of 92, which is more
than a year away.

  My thoughts on this are mixed. The first impression I get is that GDW is
couldn\'t patch a SF-rpg on the Twilight/Merc/Dinos/Dark line with a straight
face at the same time as they have MegaTraveller as a living system. That is 
the positive interpretation. The negative interpretation is that they try to
get their Traveller audience to get hooked on the T/M/D/D line.

  Now, on to the system. I can say without modification that I like the
task system above the system T2k uses for skill success resolution. It is 
possible to cram a lot more info in a task description than it is in the rather
flimsy method T2k uses.
  
  There is also one big problem with the system T2k uses for this and for 
determining wether one hit or miss with a weapon: If you have zero skill you
have zero chance hitting in any situation.
  So I went to an old army officer I know who have instructed recruits in using
a rifle for several years and asked him thus:
  "In system one you have zero chance hitting in any situation if you have
zero skill, and the chance goes up 10% per level.
   In system two you have a small chance of hitting if you have no skill at all.
If you get some basic training this goes up a big step, and additional
skill improves it by little steps.
   Which of these two systems most accurately represent reality?"
   To which he answered:
   "The second one."

  So while I like way T2k handles successful hits, and the way it conducts
autofire, I think that the T2k skill resolution and to-hit procedure would be
a step backwards.

  I also humbly wonder if a T2k-ification of Traveller would mean that they 
would leave the "Give\'em a design system and let\'em make their own vehicles"
model from Traveller and MegaTraveller and transfer to a "Give\'em lots and
lots of expensive books where they can find the vehicle data." model like in
Twilight.

  What proofreading?

  I have my reservations on wether "Better support" and "No outside 
involvement" are compatible goals for a company with as many things in the
air at the same time as GDW. Compared to, TSR say, they are much smaller and
have many more product lines. And trying to make too many things at once is
an extremely dangerous path for a games company.

  Well, that is true for Margaret the Thatcher but not Bengt the Baron or
Stephen the King. At the time people were named by profession, the average
king would have taken a very dim view on any and all Stephens calling themselves
\'King\':)

  And there are families where the title of, for example president, seems to
be passed down as if inherited.

Like the subject line says, I\'m fairly new to the game. Our campaign started
in May and we had a summer break, so I haven\'t played so much.
OK, my problem is this: let\'s assume that a ship misjumps and the crew finds
themselves 2 parsecs from the nearest system, without jump fuel. They go
to Low Berths and shut down all systems on the ships except one computer
and the Berths. Thus the power plant has to produce only about 0.01 MW of
power, instead of the usual 1000+ MW. The power plant could then run for
years on its fuel.
Is this possible by the MegaTraveller rules? Does this sound completely
irrational/silly or something?
Any suggestions and advice from more experienced refs is very welcome.

Please email directly to me, if possible.

I agree with Ameer -- the game mechanics need revision and proofreading,
but Leave Our Universe Alone!  The setting for the game is the single
most important factor in making it so popular for so long.  I think it
would be insane to make such drastic changes.  For my part, I\'m still
having trouble getting used to the Rebellion.
 
I find all this stuff about a computer virus causing widespread havoc
across the Imperium to be higly dubious at best.  Even if a mechanism
for carrying it from world to world could be contrived, it\'s hard to
believe that the computer technology on the myriad different worlds
would be sufficiently compatible to allow it to thrive.
 
What is the HIWG\'s view about this upheaval, I wonder?  Or DGP\'s?

The following is the opinion of one (albeit listened-to) member of
the Traveller Mailing List, and does not reflect the opinions of
the List\'s membership or of the poor sod who\'s forced to run it
(hi, James). It will prove offensive to a lot of you people, and
the author doesn\'t give a fuck. Okay?

So they\'re at it again. "Star Viking." "Traveller-- the Revision."

*sigh*

I would very much like to determine whether or not this is a hoax, a
cruel joke, or-- Lord help me-- the truth. Especially since any TMLer
who bothers to read .signature files will have noted by now that the
Chuck Gannon mentioned in Mac\'s latest insider report is a member of
the TML. For the nonce, let us assume, with some skepticism, that the
report is in fact true in extent and content, and go from there.

Knowing comparatively little about the rules system base that the rev 2
Twilight rules use, I\'ll refrain from making specific comments about 
the company\'s decision to force us all to learn Yet Another System. I 
will also refrain from making value judgements as to which system will
be "more realistic," "more playable," or (pfagh!) "better." I merely 
wish to comment on the more global aspects of what this change will mean
to us as Traveller players.

First off: Marketing. GDW, unless they have finally learned something 
from West End and FASA, are going to finally succeed in blowing their
own brains out on this one. Traveller did great for ten years on a 
basic rules system that STILL works better than all the revisions, in
a lot of areas. MegaTraveller has been out for less than half that time,
and has been a colossal flop in terms of sales and generated interest.
It changed too much, and did so in an unappealing package with limited 
and skewed scope (we have an entire book on airplanes-- AIRPLANES?!--
and we still don\'t know squat about Dulinor?). The result was a rules 
system that generated very little loyalty. Bad move. GDW had better
be ready to accept the fact that yet another revision is going to piss
off a lot of people in a big way, and that\'s REGARDLESS of how good it is.
And if they go it alone, without DGP\'s continuity and gaming aplomb to
back them up, they\'re in double trouble. Dark Conspiracy is too little
too late on the creepycrawly trend, Space:1889 was a criminal case of
misguessing the public\'s tastes, and Twilight/Merc/2300 seem to be 
keeping the company afloat on merits I personally can\'t see at all. If 
they go out on a limb with this new Traveller rev, they\'d better go all
the way-- real artwork, good maps and inserts, a proper typesetting job,
and all the elements that make a game buyer who buys from FASA or TSR
feel like he\'s getting (at least in layout) a quality product.

"But," I hear the munchkins in the front row bleat, "What about CONTENT?"

PISS on content!

Yeah! Piss on content. Content doesn\'t sell games-- packaging does. We can
be as altruistic as we want to be, but we are NOT going to keep a company the
size of GDW in business in today\'s market. A game like Traveller Classic,
as phenomenally successful as it was in 1977, would put GDW into Chapter 11
in no time nowadays. We don\'t need to impress the seasoned gamers and pros
out there-- they HAVE their systems, and like them. We need to prise open
the sweaty little stubby fists of the whining pimply preteens as they wander
through the game stores looking for newer and better misogyny to hide their
lack of social skills and pull out the crumpled wads of scrimped paper-route
cash and gifts from Mommy and Daddy before it can get spent on Shardowrun,
or Torg, or Cyberpunk, or GURPS, or whatever. Flashy artwork. Bloodshed.
Bigger guns and brighter fireworks. Flashier vehicles and slicker machismo.
And above all, SEX. SEX SEX SEX! Women, reduced to meat on the hoof for
the prurient edification of slimeballs of all ages who\'d never dream of
trying to kiss a *real* girl themselves. Tighter costumes! Narrower waists!
And BREASTS. Human women with breasts the size of canteloupes! Aslan women
with breasts the size of honeydew melons! Vargr women with breasts the size
of nectarines! ("Nectarines?" "Yeah, but there are SIX of them, man!") More
makeup, more skin, body tattoos, the works-- if MegaTraveller\'s Player 
Handbook had had a cover with a bim like the one on the original 2300 rules,
they\'d have done a lot better in the sales department. SELL MORE GAMES!

That having been said, and the basic problem of keeping the company alive
having been addressed, let me now turn to minutiae that won\'t make any 
difference in the long run to anyone except people like us, people with
slightly DIFFERENT fetishes. Hey, kid! Yeah, you in the front row! Get
yer hand outa yer pants and stop thinking about the honeydew melons for
a second! Remember what you were yelling about a minute ago? Huh?

"Oh, yeah. CONTENT."

These are the areas which will matter most in the long run, but unfortunately
games are published for the short run. It\'s doubtful that we can do anything
about the marketing and packaging end of things, so we may as well focus on 
the things we CAN change, and hope that we can make Chuck Gannon, and GDW, 
listen. Any author who thinks he can publish a rules system in a vacuum, with
no input from outside critics, is living in a dreamworld. On the other hand,
as TDR will gleefully demonstrate, if critics with opposing viewpoints lock
horns with no way to break the deadlock, nothing gets done, good or bad. 
The middle ground is for an author or team of authors to have a clear and 
persistent vision of the world they are trying to bring to life, combined
with a willingness to sweat the small details out with the help of the best
possible critics and playtesters, changing ruthlessly whatever needs to be 
changed to improve the game, and rejecting ruthlessly any attempts to sway
him from his vision.

Well, folks, if Chuck Gannon\'s the author, can YOU think of a good test group?
*I* sure can.

Let\'s face it. MegaTraveller was BROKEN. Broken broken broken. We did our
damnedest to fix it, and nobody listened. Now we have a real opportunity 
to fix the broken parts before Traveller becomes even more of a public
laughing stock than it is already! Next August isn\'t a long time to write
a game, but a good testing process can and MUST be included in that time.
The MegaTraveller rules were obviously NOT playtested properly, proofread
and doublechecked carefully, or assembled with any eye to real game-universe
continuity. And the rules that followed were often worse. I call upon the
experts in this group, whose combined knowledge of science, military 
matters, economics, sociology and history outweighs that of any single man
out there, to volunteer their aid in the testing and revision of these new
rules. And I call upon the people at GDW to get their heads out of their 
asses and stop relying on inbred apologists to test their games. Nobody,
not even Marc Miller or Joe Fugate, can claim to love Traveller MORE than
I do. And I\'m willing to do my part to assure that the new game that comes
out next GenCon is the best it can possibly be.

How about it?

  The XMH-242 is an assault weapon a-la Minimi.
 
 
  I prefer a feature list to Adrian\'s code system. Of course, some pieces
of equipment need additional (GM only) information (i.e. jamming mods) but
these may be hooked in somehow. Thus, the 2300AD has a very good hardware
stuff, including strangeness. The system DOES increase GM and player load.

	Well, I\'m sure GDW will come up with a good explaination.
For the most part, GDW has been pretty good on this kind of stuff.
While I may not like Rebellion, it\'s at least believable. The new
universe is going to be introdcued at next years GenCon.

	To be honest, I have no idea. I don\'t even know if they know
of this yet. I\'ve stopped monitoring the Traveller board on GEnie.
But I doubt this was posted. All this information came from my talk 
with Lester Smith, one of the GDW in house staff designer. For those 
of you that don\'t know who he is, he did "Deathwatch Program" for 
2300 AD and Dark Conspiracy.

	As I have stated in the posting replying to Alan. The
information came from talking with Lester Smith. Since he does work
for GDW, and I\'m in no mood to make up something like this, (Frankly,
I can\'t even if I wanted to.) I personally think it\'s the truth,
otherwise I wouldn\'t have bothered posting it to TML. Especially
since Lester Smith hasn\'t passed any information that turned out 
to be false to date.

	I think the current GDW is quite a bit better about maps, artwork,
typesetting, and all that stuff in my opinion. Dark Conspiracy in my
opinion, is the most flashy product GDW has ever produced that I\'ve
seen. The maps and arts are just wonderful. And let me tell ya, before
I saw DarkCon, I was very skeptical myself.

	And to set the record straight, the revision is due out 
around Xmas time I believe. GenCon release date is for Star Viking.

	IMHO... it was ten years from Traveller to MegaTraveller.  This I
do not see as having been good; as the old system was very creaky at the joints

hit the market.  Again, as we all know, it\'s creaky at the joints and is
having some problems.  Having worked with the T:2000 2nd ed. rules, I think
that they have a better place to start than MT does, though it needs some
polishing.

direct link with the computer, thus can order the computer to do
things like produce illusion etc, which seems like magic to normal
people that doesn\'t understand what\'s going on. It\'s not that I\'m lazy,
but the title of the game is called A.I. :)

Body Pistol 5mm

   The Bodypistol is designed to be especially hard to detect in security 
searches. It is done mostly in advanced materials which makes it more 
expensive than usual. Silencers are available at law level zero weighing 150g 
and costing Cr125. There are no problems with compatibility between different 
techlevels of ammunition for this gun. The ammunition used is called 5x10mmI 
and it is sold in cases of 2000 rounds, (Lead: 1liter 5kg Cr230) (AP: 1liter 
4kg Cr460) (APDS: 1liter 2kg Cr1380)

Automatic Pistol 9mm Caseless

   I have assumed that due to recoil purposes, a loaded weight of 1kg is 
minimum for a 9mm automatic pistol. Therefore the TL13-16 pistols have extra 
weights in them, 50g at TL13, 140g at TL14, 240g at TL15 and 350g at TL16 
which can be replaced by laser point sights, smartgun options, gyros and so on.
   The weapon has no ammunition compatibility problems. The 9x17mmICls comes 
in cases of 1000 rounds, (Lead: 2.7liters 13kg Cr297) (AP: 2.7liters 9kg Cr594)
 (DS: 2.7liters 4kg Cr891) (APDS: 2.7liters 4kg Cr1782).
   Typical smartgun statistics as offered by Interstellarms in the M911s1ID to 
M911s1IG models (smartgun versions of the basic M911I line) are: TL13 +2 
+Cr108, TL14 +3 +Cr324, TL15 +3 +Cr324, TL16 +4 +Cr972. This particular 
smartgun sensor works with passive IR, so it is rendered ineffective by the 
various forms of IR supression in armors. The slightly more advanced M911s2ID 
to M911s2IG models are capable of combining movement, visual clues and IR to 
fire at moving items and lifeforms. They have the following characteristics: 
TL13 +1 +Cr108, TL14 +2 +Cr324, TL15 +3 +Cr972, TL16 +3 +Cr972.

Someone has been taking Scott Kellogg\'s "Vulture" class craft seriously!
As I recall, he wrote that one such craft was taken over by the computer
of the Kinunir, which has been using various forms of virus to quietly
steal bits and pieces for itself.  Of course, even the Kinunir can\'t
write a bug-free virus.

(Realises the horrible pun, ducks for cover.  :-)

I suspected something of the sort, hence the smiley.  First we were discussing
pistols; then, without warning, you included a larger weapon which would be
recognised as such only by people who know the code numbers of every weapon
in existence, including prototypes (I assume the "X" there indicates that this
gun is an experimental or prototype version).

>   I prefer a feature list to Adrian\'s code system.

To convert my code system to a feature list, simply delete the code number
column.  The reason for the code numbers was for the benefit of GM\'s whose
PCs\' first action upon visiting a planet is to find the weapons shops.
Rather than say "Yes, this shop sells 9mm auto pistols", I\'d say "Yes, we
sell auto pistols.  Wait a moment, I\'ll show you a selection."  I\'d then
roll 1D6 for number of types available, then determine the code number
of each type at random.  If I felt up to it at the time, I\'d add some of
the additional features as well.  It was a quick\'n\'dirty way of getting
some variety into the arms market.

Well, jamming mods might be known to the PC\'s.  Not the exact modifier, of
course, but someone might know that this particular gun has a habit of
blowing its slide off every so often, or that gun is used by the local
security forces because of its legendary ability to be dropped in a muddy
pool, thrown at a brick wall, placed in a fridge, and still be able to
fire accurately.

I feel compelled to drop off this short note in reaction to last night\'s
commentary by Mike Metlay regarding the state of Traveller and certain
"improvements" looming upon the horizon.

DISCLAIMER: These are my opinions ONLY and if anyone else happens to agree
            with me then whoopee. I am solely responsible for the language
            which may pop up from time to time. If you are easily offended,
            read at your own risk.

In short: Mike, AMEN BROTHER!

Does anyone else get the feeling of deja vu? It reminds me of all that furor
not too long ago when some boneheads at Coca-Cola decided that what the public
needed was "NewCoke" and that they will like it because, hey, they\'ll buy
anything. The wisdom of foisting a product on an unresponsive consumer
market should have been fairly obvious.

I think that GDW is fooling itself if it believes that Traveller fans will
go for ANOTHER major revision so soon after it labored to produce a presumably
well intentioned but utimately botched mutant. Its painfully obvious flaws
are well known. Look at how it was received by the most die-hard, ardent
fans of Traveller. As Mike noted, the applause was somewhat underwhelming.
Can you imagine how absolute neophytes would feel upon investigating MT
and being brought up short by its glaring faults? They\'ll vote with their
wallets. Trying to slap on a gold band-aid won\'t help.

A couple of years ago I decided to get back into gaming -- the obvious
question was with what system? I had neither the time nor the inclination
(nor the money) to keep abreast of more than one system. I chose to go
back to Traveller because I had always liked the way GDW had handled
the Traveller "universe" and felt that I had always gotten my money\'s
worth from their products. (And I found munchkinism less prevalent among
my Traveller cohorts, but that\'s another story.)

As they saying goes, what has GDW done for me lately? Produced a half-assed
abortion like MegaTraveller and some notable disasters: I thank the Lord I
listened to TMLers and didn\'t buy Fighting Sh*ts, and hang my head in shame
for buying COACC. Must have been temporary insanity. Not exactly a way to
build confidence in any further undertakings.

My gut reaction to NewTraveller is "OH NO, NOT AGAIN!"

Will I buy Star Viking, or whatever silly name GDW pastes on it?

NOT BLOODY LIKELY

Why don\'t the grand poo-bahs at GDW just invest some money in a rubber
stamp and emboss all of their future releases with the legend: OUR LATEST
ATTEMPT TO MAKE PEOPLE FORGET OUR PREVIOUS FAILURES -- PLEASE BUY THIS, WE
PROMISE WE\'VE DONE IT RIGHT THIS TIME.

It\'s like a contractor who builds a small, quality house that everybody
likes and enjoys, but then tears it down and replaces it with a ramshackle
poorly designed monstrosity (but it\'s better, really!) and keeps on trying
to dress it up by building more upon it. It won\'t work; if the foundation
is rotten there\'s little sense in building upon it unless you want the whole
rickety house of cards to come a \'tumblin down.

Has GDW had an unlucky love affair and is now trying to commit suicide?

I heartily agree with Mike\'s editorial. If it isn\'t fixed NOW, then it
will be too late for damage control. In my own limited way, I am willing
to exert some effort to save Traveller. Otherwise, I suspect that I will
not be the only one who simply tunes out from GDW\'s Traveller.

Please help stop GDW before it kills again! :->

    'body' => 'SPACE COMBAT

     I had the opportunity (misfortune?) of having space combat in my weekly
Traveller game last Monday night.  I was going to sit down immediately after
the game and write a lengthy diatribe on the flaws in that system, but sense
prevailed.  I woke up the next morning and realized that I had done my 
modifiers backwards, and that the enemy ship with armor-52 (-4 die modifier)
was not, in fact, nearly invincible.  However, the question of discontinuity
between the space and vehicle combat systems remained.  The problem that I
was experiencing was that two small ships (1 200 tons, the other 400 tons)
could not do any damage to each other except Fuel-1, Weapons-1, and, I
think, Maneuver-1 (I\'m not sure about that because of the modifier screw
up).  Using the vehicle combat system, we quickly see that a 250 MW laser
has a pretty useful penetration versus an armor-40 hull, and that the
250 damage points done in a typical \'low penetration\' hit will pretty well
trash any part of the ship that has separate damage points.  As I described
the combat, our heroes fired numerous missiles at the enemy until all turrets
were knocked out, and then closed to visual range to deliver the coup de grace
to the enemy with their single laser...regrettably the enemy vessel had 
repaired one laser in a triple turret and fired one shot which nearly destroyed
the player\'s ship\'s power plant.  I\'m satisfied with that result, but not
with the method used to generate it.  (I know, I have a copy of Bertil\'s
system, but I haven\'t read it enough to use it yet...).  I found that in the
heat of the game that it was not worthwhile to worry about sensor rolls, and
that the -1 per hex sensor penalty seems too severe given that weapons are
supposed to have a 500,000km range. We also used a Mayday set for combat
resolution, which took a few minutes to explain about vectors...but not so
many minutes that it seemed prohibitive.

THE AFTERMATH

     Now they have a slight problem...the privateers were able to jump, and
their base was only one jump away.  Our heroes would have been cooked had they
not been carrying two 1kl portable fusion plants which they jury-rigged for
some power to the thruster plates.  With maneuver power (of sorts) they
docked with one of the demolished enemy fighters, which fortunately had not
taken a power plant critical hit, and salvaged its power plant.  However, they
managed to ram it in the docking process, and I ruled that their hull was in
such need of repair that they were not capable of a gas giant refueling. I 
also ruled that jumping was out because of massive damage to the jump grids.

     From a gas giant to a main world is usually a considerable distance (I
had often ignored this, but you shouldn\'t).  By the time they were patched up
and in transit, two new privateers <?> had jumped into the system.  Now they
have landed on the planet (Pagaton, TL4, in an ice age) in a spot that you
could consider to be equivalent to southern Greenland (in the equivalent of
the 1850s--a steam press to bend the hull members back into shape might be
available, but not in \'Greenland\').  The enemy is expected to orbit in 24-48
hours.  Should they be easy to find with a densitometer?  Obviously if their
fusion plant is running, they\'ll show up like a bonfire on the neutrino
sensors.  If they elect to abandon their ship, how often should a free trader
call on this world?  Would a world with refueling (water) available only a
jump-1 from a class A starport be unfrequented?  This all gets back into the
"How many ships in the Imperium?" discussion. Is there a "Distressed Spacemen"
law that says that a free trader has to pick them up?  Just how many TL13
novelty type \'relics\' would their be?

     I realize that all of these questions are "Add salt to taste", but I\'m 
curious.  Also, does anyone think it would be fair to impose corrosion problems
on the fuel purifying system for working with saturated (21% by weight) sodium
chloride brine as a feedstock?  (Maybe that\'s why people _buy_ unrefined fuel
rather than ocean dipping...)

     Anyway...I\'m still here, although I\'ve been pretty quiet the last few 
weeks.  The final two Horde installments should be along soon.

Good Gaming,

According to Joe Fugate, very UNofficially, last October, in Boise,
was asking a bunch of us what we thought about a "different kind of
fantasy/sci-fi rpg."  One where (I truly hope I don\'t step on any
toes here, and also that I get it right.) for some strange reason,
(something like Vinge\'s singularity, I think) a portion of humanity
has sort of "outgrown" bodies and planetary constrictions by 
downloading their personalities into AI constructs (hence the name).
There is also another class of PC, (mundanes, if you will) who 
chose not to make the change, and are semi-barbaric, using a 
priestly class, truly intelligent (magick?) devices etc.  Both sides
of the coin are playable.

(disclaimer:  I have *NO* idea what DGP is really up to now, nor
do I know how Joe\'s plans have changed in the last year.)


Last night, Mike also bemoaned GDW trying to (again) resurrect
Star Viking.  Joe sort of warned us about that, too, although 
I don\'t remember it well.  It was very late at night, and...

I think we should step back a little and discuss models and values.
The RPG is a moderated virtual reality.  Traditionally we have
built this virtual reality strictly within the minds of our 
players, using abstract rules systems.  Computer games, to date,
have not followed this approach, but rather gone after single-
player, limited-interaction, scripted scenarios.

I assert that GDW (and TSR and FASA and Steve Jackson) only
pursue nostalgia when ther introduce Yet Another RPG based 
on a simple abstract rules system.  Hence, using Twilight
2000 rules as a "house" system will eventually spell their
doom.   UNLESS (and here is where TDR and CAT were on the 
right track) the game houses (or someone) manages to begin
to properly meld 21st-century habits and technology with the
entertainment world, and start building (granted, primitive)
virtual reality enhancements to RPG\'s.

I reckon that means I agree completely with Mike.  TML is 
IMO the *BEST* place to thoroughly play test and user-test
whatever it is they come up with...if they\'ll listen.  After
all, we\'re the ones who are so addicted to this stuff we 
take it to work with us...

  I suspect that you are referring to a multimedia approach, ie \'MegaTraveller
the RPG, MegaTraveller the Computergame, MegaTraveller the Movie, 
MegaTraveller the Online-MUD, MegaTraveller the Boardgame, MegaTraveller the
Novel and so on?

  I agree in that, for example, Novels and computer games generate interest in
a game system and leads the \'newbies\' to that system if they have a positive
initial contact. A negative initial contact, on the other hand, will be very
damaging to the system, so quality in this is extremely important.

  When it comes to the MUD type of virtual reality enhancements I see their 
purpose as creating interest, because they cannot, at present, emulate the 
flexibility of a human referee. Computer games like MegaTraveller II and Pool 
of Radiance and all that are very far from MegaT and AD&D, but they don\'t claim
to be anything they are not. A TravellerMud would be a different beast from 
both real Traveller and a computer game version, and it would be non-smart of 
it to claim that it was *real* Traveller.
  Any advanced powerglove/glasses scheme must build upon existing technology, 
since the development costs to do it from scratch probably will be large.
  
  The other ways a system could use electronic resources are PBEM/FRP and
communications and I\'m not sure that a PBEM/FRP could be run on a commercial
basis. If the workload the referee handles was handled by a salaried operator,
the per turn cost would be rather prohibitive. (Interpret this as: "You\'re
doing a great job, Richard!" :)

  Communications on the other hand, is very useful, and many companies have 
already started their BBS-es and areas on commercial services. In some companies
this seem to be something that the design crew and managers (if those groups
are different people, the company is too large:) do if they are interested on
their spare time and in others this has been formalized as a part of the 
normal operation of the company. Steve Jackson Games seems to be an example on 
the latter, and I think this is the way to go.

  I\'ll look at that. Judging from the data on what sensors can see on different
ranges, the sensor combat ranges are a little low. Since Mayday uses twice as
large hexes, the sensor ranges could be doubled with the nice side effect that
Maydays movement rules can be used without modification.

  Since densitometers have a rather bad resolution on long ranges, the only way
someone could detect them distinctly from orbit is if they have any internal
gravitics running. The ship is made of superdense (I assume) combined with
metals of all types and solids and some liquids, and a lot of gasses. If the
resolution is bad enough, the detecting densitometer will just see the average
density in each \'pixel\'. Since the density of most civilian ships is about that
of water or ice southern Greenland is a very good place to hide. If the
density of the ship *isn\'t* correct, it can easily be adjusted by loading on
random rocks and other junk.
  If this has been done, the plant has been shut down, the ship camouflaged
in the visual and IR areas and it is observing radio silence, the only way of
the privateers to find them is to do a densitometer scan at a so short range 
that the densitometer will be able to discern different parts of the ship, and
so detect the superdense hull.

  It will be slightly more undetectable it they put it on the bottom of some
random lake or sea and cover it with silt.

  (As seen in the quote in my sig on the end of the latest machinetools, I
had a very similar situation in my campaign last sunday:)

  I seem to remember reading something about that the IISS prohibits 
introduction of TL6+ items on TL5- worlds. If this is so it would put a wooden
slipper in the mercantile machinery and seriously limit any interest off-
worlders might have in legal interaction with the world. Illegal interaction
is of course always possible but I would advice against hitching a ride 
with a gunrunner.

  You are absolutely correct about flashiness and good layout and all that -
But it still has the same general type of problems that we\'ve seen in the 
MegaTraveller books, ie the referrences to some piece of data found in another
chapter that *simply isn\'t there*!

  Three examples that comes to mind right now is that the equipment listing 
mentions that contacts work into the availability codes and that exact how this
works is supposed to be found in the section on contacts. Not so.
  I\'ve also not been able to find any explanation of the availability codes
in \'Dark\'.
  And in the character generation chapter there is a mention that some weapons
need special licenses, and that data on how to get those is in the equipment
listing. Nope.

  All these examples are just more of what we\'ve seen before. Bad coordination
between different parts of the design team leading to spurious references was
very evident in MegaTraveller. I suspect that the proofreading is done by 
people who *alreay know the system* and unconciously fill in the missing parts
because they know what it should be. The missing availability codes makes this
more likely because they are such a staple in the T2k system that anyone
familiar with it would know about them.

  Don\'t get me wrong: \'Dark\' is still much better editing and typo-wise than
MegaT, but it still hasn\'t reached the goal.

Viking is supposed to be a totally new game.  Frank wants to do a game that
deals with looting on a planetary scale.  This requires limited space travel
and to make it fun a wide diversity of planets (i.e. everything from
barbarians hoarding chickens to fairly advanced systems).  The intro/set up
of which will allude to Traveller as its far past.  The RPG system will be
based on Twilight 2000-2 and the combat system will be a extension of
command decision.  As an aside command decision appears to be a real adaptable
system.  The CITW (including myself and Frank Chadwick) have been playing
Crimean War battles with it and it works.  Star Viking is supposed to be a
game mainly of looting planets so large scale combat will be the norm.
The original virus was supposed to be similar to the PC virus of the last
year or so, but I think I convinced him to do something a little more
elaborate.  I told him he should assume a technological breakthrough which
causes most computers to have a common component (my suggestion was
something organic).  The computer virus then attacks "life support"
processor actually causing the main processor to die of starvation or heat.
The net effect is that it appears to be a normal failure that causes
component replacement it\'s not until very late that they figure out it is a
virus attacking the life support system rather than a bug in design/manufacturing.
By then production is virtually at a standstill and massive component failure
is occuring.  At any rate you probably won\'t have to go to SV unless you
want to.
    Frank has also talked about redoing Traveller as the Twilight system.
He seems to understand the problems with doing this so soon after
MegaTraveller.  This is not a new idea and in fact Traveller 2300 was an
attempt to do this as well with t2000-1 (in amy opinion they didn\'t go far
enough with 2300 and in fact made it too Travellerish).  Personally I like
the Twilight system which is why I agreed to edit the Eternal Soldier
newsletter for GDW.  Will it work (as a system) for Traveller?  The answer
is yes (the system is extremly flexible).  Will it sell?  Who knows, but at
least you will have a proven/workable system to play with.  Will you buy
it?  Probably since many of you seem to require the background support that
the currently supported version provides.  Will there be production problems
.... hard to say, but these are related to the staff and as of right now
things seem to be in good shape.
    Space 1889 suffered from deployment problems caused by delays in the minitures 
for Sky Galleons which was a real horror story i.e. Sky Galleons was about
9 months late and was produced off of reworked miscasts of the masters (the
masters were really hot stuff from what I was told).  This caused what was
initially supposed to be a gradual introduction of products to become a flood.
What interests me the most is the raw nerve the game struck between the
extremes of the hobby the historic games have lashed out at it almost as a
corruption of history (as if what they did was the same thing under another
name) and the fanatasy RPG players have lashed out at it as being too
historical (as though the fact that you could do reasearch in a history book
made it any less fantastic).  Personally having gone gaga as a pre-teen on
H.G.Wells and E. R. Burroughs I like 1889.

Message from High Commissioner the Lord Goolanzoon, Sector Admiral, Imperial
Navy  (ret.),  Minister without portfolio of the Archduchy of Deneb,  to His
Grace Archduke Norris of Deneb using the private cypher:



Dear Pruneface,

Well, the "Committee to Review the recent events in the Trojan Reaches with a
view to ascertaining etc. etc."  -  in short, what went wrong and what can we
do about it?   -   has finally completed it\'s investigation.  No doubt you\'ll
eventually get a predigested resume of our findings through your tame bureau-
crats, but I thought you\'d appreciate a informal overview. (And to be totally
honest, I\'m too damn exited to wait for an official reaction).
    First of all,  there\'s  no doubt that the whole thing was shockingly mis-
managed by the Duke of Tobia and Admiral Torgeson. They seem to\'ve lost their
so-called heads completely.  True, most of the regular units were up coreward
watching the zhos, but the astrographics of the Reach is such that any first-
year  cadet  could\'ve  stopped  the aslan by garrisoning a few key worlds and
forming  a few  fire-fighter squadrons.  These are ihatei,  after all,  using
obsolescent  clan hand-me-downs   -   not much superior to our Reserve forces
(rather the reverse,  if anything).  Hell,  give me a half-decent spy network
and  a  good  courier system and I\'d\'ve undertaken to stop them with half the
forces the two fatheads had.
    Instead  Tobia  and  Torgeson  concentrated their forces to guard the few
worlds that were already so well protected  that no sane aslan would dream of
trying  to  muscle  in on them and sat around with their thumbs up their bums
while  our bewhiskered land-grabbing friends grabbed left,  right and center.
And  none  of  the other nobles had the gumption to do anything more than try
and protect their own little patch  (mostly with pitiful results). Personally
I think that the proper cure for what ails the local nobility is a collective
brain-transplant.  If  you  can\'t  find  enough donors,  a set of cheap paper
substitutes will still be an improvement!
    I know, I know.  We can\'t really do anything about the nobles   -   but I
can  dream,  can\'t I?   -   but you ought to sack the top three levels of the
Fleet,  at  least.  There\'s a few you\'d have to kick upstairs and a couple of
exceptions, but mot of the idiots deserve to be cashiered.  That\'s the result
of the Reach being too far from any real fighting for centuries,  I guess   -
all the fools wind up down here, where they, quote, "can\'t do any harm",  end
quote. Ha, bloody ha! I\'ve said it myself, may the Guiding Spirit forgive me.
    I  spoke  of  fools,  but  I\'m pretty sure that there\'s also a few knaves
around. That shocking business with Aki - ihatei that far inside the frontier
and 30 parsec from their base, for the luffa Mike!   -   couldn\'t\'ve happened
without  the conniving of somebody pretty high up.  I have a few of my bright
young  men  looking into it   -   hopefully giving the lardbutts of the local
Naval Intelligence  (hmpf!)  a few well-deserved heart attacks in the process
- -  and when we find the culprits, the bastards are going to breathe vacuum!
    Mind you,  I\'ve often wondered what made the aslan commit that particular
bit of lunacy. Imagine trying to control 10 billion locals with a few hundred
thousands.  They  had a couple of tech levels on the locals,  true,  but as I
always say,  once you can make explosives the rest is just dressing.  Anyway,
young Blackstone-Hawke - remember him?  He was one of Santanocheev\'s hangers-
on  and wound up in charge of the Gazulin Reserve Fleet after the shake-up  -
Well, he seems to have had a few more brain cells than we gave him credit for
(or  perhaps  being stuck in the boonies for half a decade has wised him up).
The  moment he heard about Aki he put a fleet across the aslani supply lines,
and  the  last  I  heard about it the survivors were at the peace tables with
their tail between their legs.  (Not that far between their legs though. They
have  been  raiding Glisten and a lot of other places for supplies,  and they
still control the Aki system. But I guess you know all this already).
    Anyway, there\'s no getting around the fact that the dam is well and truly
broken.  Apointing blame is all very well   -   it\'s rapidly becoming the fa-
vourite  sport  of the local nitwits   -   but the real problem is what to do
about  it.  Curiously enough according to my tame sociologists the problem is
more the locals than the aslans.  You remember the old diplomatic joke?  "You
give  us  what  we  want  or we beat the hell out of you and take it anyway"?
Well, apart from at Aki and a few other places, the aslans seems to have come
up  with a variant:  "You sell us what we want or we beat the hell out of you
and buy it anyway"! Most of them prefer to buy rather than take  -  they just
don\'t  take  no for an answer!  Nor would there normally be any problems with
getting  them to swear fealthy to the Imperium.  Well,  that\'s not altogether
true;  some of the clans are quite anti-Imperium.  But we\'d have the strength
to deal with them if we could get along with the rest.
    That  would  seem to solve most of the problem,  wouldn\'t it?  If they\'re
willing to pay for what they take and to become loyal citizens, then we real-
ly should be able to work out something, right?  Alas, the locals have become
thoroughly paranoid about them and in many cases refuse to share their worlds
with  them.  They  organize their own militias and try to push the aslans off
their planets. And you know what happens when you push an aslan  -  he pushes
right back!  If something isn\'t done, the descendents of both sides are going
to be sniping at each others 200 years from now.
    Fortunately  we have been able to come up with a solution!  That\'s right,
we have an answer,  and it\'s so simple that you\'re going to kick yourself for
not thinking of it yourself.  I did when my aide earned the fastest promotion
in history with just one sentence.  Think about it. What are our two greatest
problems  today?  One is that we have all these young aslans swarming up from
rimwards, eager for land and willing to fight for it, and we can\'t stop them,
because most of our ships are up corewards trying to keep the damn Vargr from
devastating  more  planets  than they already have.  The other is keeping the
damn Vargr from devastating more planets than they already have, and we can\'t
do  that  because  a lot of our strength is tied up trying to keep the aslani
from getting to cosy with our real estate to the rim.
    I really wish I could see your face now,  Pruney.  As my aide said:  "Why
don\'t we get our two problems to fight each other?" Corewards and in Corridor
there  are  scores  of planets whose populations have been decimated;  untold
acres of prime land whose legitimate owners and their heirs are dead and gone.
We  can  hire all the ihatei we can get and pay them off with that land!  And
you can bet your bottom credit that the survivors are not going to regard the
aslans as interlopers. They\'ll be saviours!
    Furthermore, once we have a credible offer to make, we\'ll be able to play
the aslan clans off against each others. You know how fragile aslan alliances
are,  Frankly I\'m amazed that the present one has held so long as it has, and
it  has only done so because they could get more out of cooperating with each
other than with us.  The land the aslans can get down here rimwards is mostly
second choice.  Give them an offer of prime land and they\'re not going to let
the  Vargr  stand  in  the  way.  And we\'ll be able to favour the friendliest
clans, leaving us in a position to make the unfriendly ones toe the line.
    With the extra strength the aslan can supply  (not to metion the ships we
will be able to spare from the rim)  we should be able to clear the Domain of
Vargr.  Hell,  we  may  even be in a position to clear Corridor,  although my
aslan  experts  doubt  it.  They say that the present massive burst of ihatei
will  taper  off in a year or so,  and that it will be a long time before the
pressure builds up to the pre-Revolution level. For one thing, the ihatei has
mostly  leap-frogged over all the neutral worlds we kept between them and us,
and  it will be some time before they\'ve "filled in the cracks".  Still,  who
knows? Perhaps enough of them will prefer Corridor to filling in cracks.
    What  I  suggest is that we keep this plan secret and try to surprise the
Vargr.  The most pressing problem is Aki and the rest of Glisten. If you will
send me a warrant,  I\'ll take over the negotiations and get the ball rolling.
I\'ve  already put my staff on to planning the logistics which,  I admit,  are
going to be a headache. But worth it, I\'d say!

Cheerio,
Goggles.

My question is: What advantages does anyone see in going to a compatible
game system?  Is there really any interest in running Traveller/Dark 
Conspiracy crossovers?  A well done Traveller game should already include
90% of the information needed to run a Traveller/Twilight:2000 crossover.
Does anyone feel that the number of special cases involved will be small
enough to give a real advantage in saving time switching from one system
to another?  That is, does it really take most of us very long to learn
the necessary amount of a new game system to be able to play the game?
Is a Traveller revision using Twilight rules going to have the same emphasis
on combat activities?  Are we going to be happy to be using a system where
an average character can take two average damage .50 caliber machine gun
bullets to the head without becoming unconscious?

I seem to be drifting away from the original topic of the question: what
do we gain by making the rules compatible?

(New players? Or just new sales for GDW to old players?)

Sorry to digress so far from Traveller but:

Are you kidding? the Coca-Cola Corporation made a killing on that one! You
see, they brought out this new product, and \'discontinued\' the old. Almost
everyone bought a New Coke at least once, just to see what it was like. Many
of these people were never Coke drinkers before. Some of these people
actually started drinking New Coke regularly! The result? an increased
market share.

Then, around a year (I think) later, they brought out \'Coke Classic\'! Not
only did this appease most of the old, die-heard Coke drinkers, but it also
had exactly the same effect as New Coke: many people who never drank Coke
regulary before tried it, decided they liked it, and switched.

Coca Cola increased their market share appreciably with this marketing coup.
It\'s considered a classic in most marketing and advertising courses now.

Of course, GDW doesn\'t have the kind of advertising power that the Coca Cola
Corporation has... :-)

    'body' => 'Hi,

I don\'t know about you folks, but In the few campaigns I have run, and
in my dealings with Trav, I have always assumed that the Imperium, and
the rest of the Trav universe are in a state of equilibrium.

By that I mean that in order change something You need a lot of power
to do so.  In order to assasinate Strephon you need a fleet, an extremely
fool proof plan, or yu have to be an arch duke.  Thing like that.
The point being that there is something to prevent the ordianary players
from taking over the galaxy.

For every thing that the players might think up, there exists a defence
to oppose them.  (Well, nearly everything... remember the high speed
projectiles train...)  Thus Joe Player can\'t just write a quick virus
that will take over the galaxy.

If Joe Player could do it, Then Donny Zhodani would have done it centuries
ago!  Therefore, when computer viruses started becoming the new fashion
wave a couple of years ago.  I just assumed that in 5000 years the Imperium
would have some damn good countermeasures against viruses.  I may be no
computer whiz but I don\'t think a virus can get to a computer that is
shut down!  Presumably the Imerials would have reserve computers on line
in case someone did get through with a virus.

So defences MUST exist, and they have been presumably overcome.  Well, If
traveller is going to work, you must have a functioning jump drive.  That
requires a functioning model 1 computer.  Now in my opinion, a functioning
model one computer should be able to clear a model 2 of viruses.  A model
2 can clear a 3, and once you have worked your way up to 9, then you are
done!  Problem solved!  The Imperium is now functional.  QED

I dislike the messing about in the universe GDW is rumored to be considering.
Frankly, I don\'t like the Rebellion either!  All the campaigns I have run
are pre-Fifth Frontier War!  I have used MegaTrav rules, but not the Rebellion.

If GDW comes up with a whole new history, I\'m not gonna go along with it.
Frankly, I\'ve been trying to figure out just how powerful these computers are
to use them to their full potential in games (Bio-interfaces and all that
that isn\'t covered in MegaTrav)  Now They are trying to take the computer
stuff away.  Big mistake.  Computers are gonna be much more powerful in the
future.  And right now, computers are playing more and more important roles
in Science Fiction being written and read by the people who either are or
in future may be interested in playing (or even Buying) traveller.  I\'m
talking about how to integrate cyberpunk stuff in with Trav.

This looks like a BIG mistake to me.

for Traveller, and it was good.  Then, another friend of mine gave me book 5,
and it, too, was good.  Before I knew it, I had so many little 4"x5 1/2"
booklets that I hardly knew where to keep them all.  Traveller had been very
good to me, as well as to all the other people with whom I played it.  Sure,
it was a little rough around the edges, but that added to its charm.

Then MT came along... and let me just say that I think Strephon got the best
deal of any of us.  Traveller used to be a nice, infinitely moldable, and
over all, comfortable game.  Since the borders never changed, the only kind
of adventures available were small-scale mercenery tickets, espionage and
intrigue, trading/smuggling, sleuthing, etc.  This was fine with me because,
hey, who REALLY wanted to control whole squadrons and lead them into battle?
(That was, after all, what TCS was for.)  But even more importantly, who
really wants to have to play cat and mouse with battlecruisers when all they
have is an underarmed fat trader?  Maybe once in a character\'s lifetime, but
certainly not as a matter of course any time that one wants to travel beyond a
couple of subsectors.  In old Traveller, the scale of events was eminently
manageable.  The sheer size of the realm allowed the ref to do just about
anything... but the fact that the system was stable meant that none of the
possible options were proscribed.  You want adventure along a battle-zone?
Just head over to the Hinterworlds or to the Zhodani border.

But that is neither here nor there.  MT is here, and that\'s life.  (I guess
one could always become a romantic and go back to the old system... warts and
all.  My friends and I usually just used the rules we liked and ignored or
abstracted the rest.)  So now that the boys at GDW have become bored with
their little Congress of Vienna, eh?  Now they want to see the Visigoths
breach the walls of a declining rome, eh?  And to do this, they think they\'re
going to foist off some two-bit game system that sounds like a really bad
Wagner opera?  (No offense to any Wagner fans out there.)  Well, I have many,
many better things to spend my money on than \'new\' game systems that base
their plot upon some over-zealous computer virus!

I guess I\'ll just have to hole myself up in an ivory tower somwhere and start
looking for people who want to do Traveller the old-fashioned way... Strephon
and all.

(Oh, and coincidentally, I never did purchase Fighting Sh--s or COAAC{K!}, so
I guess I don\'t have complete justification to be as angry as some of the
other TMLers.  I\'ll simply consider myself lucky on this count.)

There, that\'s all.  Thank you for listening to this romantic\'s lament.

	Oh I couldn\'t agree more. That is why I dislike Rebelion so.
Suddenly the entire universe is in chaos, makes the ref\'s life very
difficult.

	I quite agree, and this is a new trend. The designers have found
on-line services to be a good way to keep in touch with the gamers. 
Not only SJG has this as part of the normal operation of the company,
but FASA, WEG also does the same.

PRELUDE:
  I have recently started up a traveller game.  No, not MT, but original traveller.
(well, I bought the referee\'s guide for the ship generation).
Well, that one guide opened up a can o\' worms.   As a result, I was planning to
tweak the ship combat anyways.  

Rob Dean says:
[]     I had the opportunity (misfortune?) of having space combat in my weekly
[] Traveller game last Monday night.  I was going to sit down immediately after
[] the game and write a lengthy diatribe on the flaws in that system, but sense
[] prevailed.  I woke up the next morning and realized that I had done my 
[] modifiers backwards, and that the enemy ship with armor-52 (-4 die modifier)
[] was not, in fact, nearly invincible.  However, the question of discontinuity
[] between the space and vehicle combat systems remained.

I noticed that as well.  They palmed the high-guard system for damage resolution,
but this just makes it worse.

Problem #1: Scale is too big
I know this is the future, but the hex scale is just too immense, as is the
time scale.  I prefer a more of a dogfight atmosphere, with short (30 second)
turns and reasonable distances. Besides, look at the ROF of a beam laser -- 30
per minute.  At a 20 minute scale there should be so many crossing beams that
each side will get very many hits.  Even being somewhat pessimistic, 9+ total to
hit produces about 150-200 beam hits.  After one turn, most ships will look
like cheese shreaders.  

Another problem is missiles.  It takes a M-6 ship 1 turn to travel 6 hexes if
starting from a standstill.  Missiles launched said ship when many hexes away
hit THAT SAME TURN.  Ppbbtt!

With a 30 second turn (3 personal combat turns), the hexes are 4.5km across
(so we\'ll fudge it to 5km).

[] was experiencing was that two small ships (1 200 tons, the other 400 tons)
[] could not do any damage to each other except Fuel-1, Weapons-1, and, I
[] think, Maneuver-1 (I\'m not sure about that because of the modifier screw

Armor should be used similar to the 2300ad way -- shots that do not
penetrate can cause surface hits.  This will most likely damage sensors,
exposed comminications gear, turrets, and perhaps the maneuver drive (giv it half
armor?).  Everything else is unaffected.  Penetrating hits have the possiblility
of producing surface damage in addition to internal damage.

The result of this is that heavily armored ships without penetrating weapons will
shoot each other blind (and perhaps immobile).  Just like shooting a rifle at a
tank.  You might clip the headlights, radio stalk and IR systems, but do little
else.

[] up).  Using the vehicle combat system, we quickly see that a 250 MW laser
[]has a pretty useful penetration versus an armor-40 hull, and that the
[] 250 damage points done in a typical \'low penetration\' hit will pretty well
[] trash any part of the ship that has separate damage points.  As I described

This is the major problem I saw.  Another that I feel is wrong is the way
hits are calculated.  Doubling the size of a component does not double the
damage it can take, in my mind.  I have come up with a small formula based on
hull volume and the hull armor weigh modifier to compute the hull hits.
I use a square-root rule (4x volume is 2x effective).  At present the formula
is something like SQRT(VOL/4050/WM)*7.  VOL is hull volume, WM is armor weight
modifier.  "7" is the constant I use for basic hits, assuming crystaliron
I think.  Steel ships have less, superdense have more, etc.  Assuming
the normal armor, a 100t ship has 7 hull hits until it is "disabled", meaning
no maneuvering allowed.  Perhaps at double this it just falls apart.

Now this value may be too low.  I presume that with every penetration you get a
free hull hit as well, so this should be upped.  Any comments on a good value?
Lasers might do 1 hull hit, energy weapons 2 hull hits, missiles 1d6 hull hits,
nukes 6d6 hull hits, or something like that.  In this case, it better be upped.

[] the combat, our heroes fired numerous missiles at the enemy until all turrets
[] were knocked out, and then closed to visual range to deliver the coup de grace
[] to the enemy with their single laser...regrettably the enemy vessel had 
[] repaired one laser in a triple turret and fired one shot which nearly destroyed
[] the player\'s ship\'s power plant.  I\'m satisfied with that result, but not

Well, another problem with long turns.  But, players will have little chance as well
with short turns.

[] with the method used to generate it.  (I know, I have a copy of Bertil\'s
[] system, but I haven\'t read it enough to use it yet...).  I found that in the
[] heat of the game that it was not worthwhile to worry about sensor rolls, and
[] that the -1 per hex sensor penalty seems too severe given that weapons are
[] supposed to have a 500,000km range. We also used a Mayday set for combat
[] resolution, which took a few minutes to explain about vectors...but not so
[] many minutes that it seemed prohibitive.

I really don\'t like the "real" movement very much when I\'m playing a space-opera
game.  I may try to use a variant of the 2300ad system, where ships have a
raw speed for each turn.  Actually, I\'d like to use some Star Fleet Battles
Ideas as well.  With such a system, you actually have to plot your movement
so as to expose your best weapons (or to hide battle damage to the armor.

- ----
In any case, I\'m presently beating on the vehicle design system in order to
put some sense into it.  I am referencing Striker for much of the information.
For example, I am using the air frame table as a guide to expand the streamlining
options (USL = simple, SL = Transonic, AF = Hypersonic).  I am also using
the 2300ad idea on steamling (Transonic streamlining wastes 10% of the chosen
volume, Hypersonic wastes 20%, Supersonic wastes 15%, subsonic wastes 5%).
This will fit in well with the planetoid space-waste.

If anyone has the collected articles or notes of the TDR vehicle system,
could you please mail it to me at burt%pager.ptltd.com?  And also, comments
on the above stuff would be great.

Well, I might as well put my Cr2 into the maelstrom...
- ----
First off, I started playing traveller in 1979, and started running
it in 1980.  Yea, back with the old books.  I basically ran my
game through high school, then stopped (other things, no players,
etc).  

Last year or so (maybe 2 years ago) I got Traveller:2300 because
I wanted to run traveller again, and was thrilled at the prospect
of an "upgrade" to a cleaner and more modern system.  You have to
face it people, traveller was designed in the D&D era, where every
game had 6 characteristics.  The basic system was simple, and
with every suppliment, book and adventure became more rich in
background.  However, the basic artifacts of the simple system
remained:

You have an area (the spinward marches) that has been settled for
about 1000 years.  Yet, tech level is ALL OVER THE PLACE.
High, low, you name it.  

Anyways, I bought 2300ad when the revision came out, and it did fix
some flaws (I did, however, switch to using 2d6 for task rolls
because I liked the curve better).

At present, I am once again running traveller, having dug up all
my old books.  Yes, I bought the Referee\'s guide because
I wanted the vehicle design rules.  (but that is another
victim on the torture table for another time).

What I\'m trying to get at here is that Traveller, MT, and any other
system BASED on it is already obsolete as far as I am concerned.
While I have not sunk as much investment into MT as others of you
out there, I have plopped down plenty for othert game systems
through the years, and will most likely continue to do so until
I find THE game that suits me and my players best.

If GDW does a revision, they should start from scratch.  No basing
it on another system.  They should start with an initial premise
about the feel of the game ("hard" SF?  Science Fantasy?
Space Opera?) and design the game around that feel.  If you
are going to pretend to have science in a game, don\'t be a
slave to the dice (see below).  Have more than six characteristics
if that is what it takes to define the character (I lean toward
at least 8, 4 physical and 4 mental).  Don\'t make social standing
and education a characteristic,make it a background.

In short, they should be innovative.  While some systems are unweildy,
they should be able to pool their resources and come up with
the SF game of the 90\'s and beyond.
- ----
In a related note, for TDR people, I have tweaked my world generating
system into a blend of 2300ad, traveller and other sources.
As a result, I had to pitch the spinward marches out the window
and regenerate it.  Here is a sample world:

Zdazeplipl  (Zh)  B 12k 0.74g Thi/VLo t  57%   6b 78-B <A->  -- (3 )

Cryptic?  Mabye.  But much more real in the way it is generated than
by using a 2-12 range...

World Physical Stats: Generated first.  Size is found similar to
that in 2300ad, rated in thousands of kilometers.  Density
determined, and the gravity is found from that.

Atmosphere: I palmed Mr. Bruddick\'s Star system generation program
for interesting formulas, such as determining volitile inventory.
With the inventory rating, I simply check to see if the escape
velocity for gasses with a molecular weight of 44 or less is
greater than that of the world.  If so, it is a vacuum world.  If
not, the inventory, spread evenly about the surface determines
pressure.  I roll 2d6 for 8+ (modifiers for high pressure)
for tainting.  If tainted, a second 2d6 roll checks for irritant.
If irritant, a third roll checks for corrosiveness.

Hydro: Again, once volitile inventory is found, I check to see if
water vapor can escape the world.  If so, the world goes dry.
If not, surface area and a random element determines amount of
water cover based on inventory.

Oxygen: Based on the amount of water present, and assuming oxygen
molecules can\'t escape the planet, I determine an oxygen
content.  It is possible now to have worlds with thin atmospheres,
but require oxygen tanks.  Likewise, you can have very thin pressures
but enough oxygen pressure to breath without respirators.
In the info above, the world has a Thin atmosphere and a Very Low
Oxygen content.

Population:  The trickiest part.  Once the world\'s condition is
determined, I determine a population modifier based on how
desireable the world is.  T-norm worlds have the greatest modifiers,
but any world with a breathable atmosphere is better off than an
airless rock.  I then tweak this basic modifier depending on the
"age" of the subsector (mature?  Established?  Recently colonized?)
And add a random element to the modifier.  Values below 1 are
considered to be empty worlds that nobody bothered to colonize.
This population roll is checked on a table to find the population
rating (minimum of 1000, max of 100b).  This rating is cut down
if the available surface area and tech level aren\'t up to it.
(no, I will not shoehorn 10b people on a 1km rockball!  Likewise,
unless there is lots of room, no way is a TL-0 culture going to
number in the billions). 

Starport: yes, starport is generated AFTER population.  There are
several tables, with the higher populations getting a better chance
of having a class A Starport.  

Government: Actually broken into 3 seperate generation systems, for
lo, moderate and high populations.  Low population worlds roll on
a simple table (of governments I think they can have), while
moderate populations roll a single dice (okay, a d15, but thats
what computers are for).  High population governments roll a single
dice as well, but the greater they are above a certain point (1b
people) the greater the chance the type will be Balkenized.

Law: Actually calculated the same way -- Gov-7+2d6

Tech: Totally different means of determination.  Starport type
drives tech level (for example, Type A might be 16-1d4, Type B
might be 16-1d6, etc).  If generating worlds for a cohesive or linked
culture (imperium, Zhodani, etc), reduce the variance by 1 (i.e.
make a 1d3 roll instead of a 1d4 roll).  If a tight culture
(sword worlds), reduce tha variance by 2.  If on the fringes
of a large collective, increase the variance by 1.
Set a limiting TL for the culture (generally 15 for Imperium,
14 for Zhodani and Vargr, 12 for Sword worlds and other independant
worlds).  Oh yea, non-alligned worlds add 2 to the variance.

The code afterwards is my means of classifying tech levels.
Class-A worlds have star travel, class B worlds have space travel,
class C are industriallized, Class D are pre-industrial civilized,
and class F worlds are precivilized.

The "--" notes the number of rings, number of moons.  I determine
number of sattelites, randomly figure the orbits, and shatter
any that fall within the roche limit.

The (3 ) is number of gas giants, followed by the number of
asteroid belts.
- ----
Well, that\'s what I use.  Travel codes are figured pretty much the
same way (except that they often look at oxygen content instead
of atmo pressure)

Sounds good, yet also familiar; isn\'t this the way the Angles, Jutes
and Saxons were able to get a toehold in Britain defending former
Roman citizens from encroaching Welsh and Scots after the pullout
of the Legions back in the late fourth and early fifth centuries?  
As I recall, the Angles and Saxons then proceeded to quite happily
divide up the country between them... Wonder who\'ll control the Domain
in 100, 200 or 500 years if this happens?

     The Scavenger class minisub is designed for support of underwater sal-
vage operations.  Its closed cycle fuel cell array can power the vessel for 
up to 96 hours underwater.  Life support and accommodations are sufficient 
for up to 6 crew members for extended duration missions, and up to 12 if 
missions are restricted to 16 hours.  The Scavenger has an adequate active 
and passive sonar system, as well as externally mounted lights to allow 
operation of the robotic arms to be controlled visually.  Divers can be 
deployed via the airlock if operating at appropriate depths.

Coastal Fishing Boat TL4

     The fishing boat shown below is typical of those found on low tech 
planets with useful sealife.  While a crew of six would be normal for this 
vessel, up to six additional crew members could be carried by \'hot berthing\' 
(allowing use of each bunk by a crew member for only 12 hours out of 24), an 
uncomfortable and unpopular practice.  At higher tech levels, a small auxil-
iary motor for harbor navigation is usually added.

Stacking Dory TL4

     The stacking dory is a small boat typically found on fishing vessels, 
where the ability to stack the boats, reducing the deck space taken up, is a 
valuable feature.  A single oarsman can propel the dory at half walking 
speed, two or more at walking speed.  Four seats are provided, but usually 
only one or two crewmen are carried, with the extra space reserved for fish.  
A small watertight cargo locker holds food, fresh water, and fishing sup-
plies.

are provided, and up to a half a ton of cargo can be carried, depending on 
the load of passengers.

  Since the timelines are different, ie T2k (and 2300??) has a limited nuclear
war and no Vilani on Barnard and MegaT has no nuke war but lots of Vilani at
Barnard, I don\'t actually see the possibilities of a crossover, unless we are
talking about some other planet than Earth. And even then it could be done
with the origianl rules.
  (Gashikan after the Sack of Gashikan, for example)

  \'Dark\' is even further from MegaT than T2k and I\'d go so far as to say that
I cannot see the justification of a crossover without some major verbal
acrobatics.

  It also disrupts the referees longterm planning. Before the rebellion there
were a static situation that would look essentially the same for decades. There
were the frontier wars, but they never led to any big changes, so the ref
could happily plot away in the total conviction that no major changes would
lie ahead.
  Then came the rebellion, and now nobody really knows what will happen in 1122
since the Rebellion Soucebook just goes up to 1121 or something. Besides, 
who needed a soucebook of that kind before the rebellion?

  This change is best illustrated by the contents of the Traveller News Service.
Before the rebellion normal news were "4 vargr corsairs captured". Post-Strephon
it is "4 Billions dead when <random emperor> bombs <random planet>."

1) There are 600+ systems in the Domain. Letting the aslans
   have part of 10 or 20 of them is not going to put them in a
   position to divide up the Domain.
2) Even if it did, aslans have this thing about loyalty. There
   are already millions of loyal aslani citizens in the Domain.
3) Even if they didn\'t, I think Norris would prefer peace in
   his time and let the future take care of itself.
4) Even if he didn\'t, the aslans are already IN the Domain. The
   only question is wether they eventually settle corewards or
   rimwards.

Hello,
 
        A question to all you physics people - I have generated a system
for 2300AD. One of the planets came out a gas giant. But this one seems to
be the mommy and daddy of all gas giants.
 
        Will planet A-VI ignite?
 
        A second question refers to the habitable planets. How does one
calculate the length of the local day (i.e. rotation speed) of a given
planet, and its temperature ranges? In the data below I just decided on
arbitrary values.

Good.  Splitting up the atmosphere and its contents I like.  I was going to
suggest that you rate the atmosphere in total pressure and partial pressure of
oxygen, but on second reading, I see that you have, just in descriptive instead
of numerical terms.  Theoretically, a human can breathe fine in a pure oxy
atmosphere who\'s total pressure equals the partial pressure of oxy on Earth,
right? (the figure 3.5 pounds stickss in my head for this)  Leaving out
problems dealing with the low pressure, of course.

Ahhh, yes.  The Roche limit.  I read many years ago, that Luna is inside
Terra\'s Roche Limit, yet Luna doesn\'t break up from tidal stresses.  Does
anyone know if that question has been settled?  Not being a planetologist type,
I sort of lost track of the question.

Greetings to my fellow Travellers...

	I\'ve been watching and waiting for an opening that I thought I might
	be able to put in a useful two cents worth, and here\'s something I 
	think I may be able to contribute to.

	On Wednesday, Sept 25, Scott Kellogg wrote:

	Well, no. A virus can\'t infiltrate a powered down computer. But, it can
	infiltrate the common storage facilities that your three onboard ship\'s
	computers share, for instance.
	Onboard a ship, you will have information which has to be available to 
	all systems, a data bank, if you will. Sure, you encounter a virus that
	you picked up over a bad Holocrystal of the V7043.6 Space Invaders. It
	happens. But the big problem is that the first thing on that devious little
	virus\'s mind is to get itself onto that computer\'s main storage. Once 
	there, it\'s gonna replicate.
	Then, of course, any well written virus is gonna write itself into the 
	boot sector of your main storage. Great. Now let\'s run with this, shall we.

		Maira, your model 9 shipboard computer has been monitoring networking
		communications between two rival faction ships. And they know that you
		know that they\'re communicating. You\'re model 9 is dumping all data
		to main storage. Perfect. So they send out a virus affectionately 
		nicknamed "Lost". Their computers have a routine running that spots
		the virus \'cause they know all about this tactic. Your computer has 
		now stored a malignant little piece of code that when read, maybe 
		through a common memory sweep, has a code in it that causes the 
		computer to execute it as a background process. Once that\'s done,
		\'Lost\' runs around your directory structure looking for your navigation
		programs and corrupts them real good so that they work, but all wrong.
		So, now your running through the universe without a clue as to where`
		you are. By the time you realize, your lost. 
			Now, your Science officer gets an inkling that you\'ve been
		sabotaged, so he runs a listing of processes. Only 24,456 copies of
		job \'Lost\' running concurrently. So, he shuts down Maira and brings
		up Migs, your second model 9. Of course, Migs has to be booted, and
		in the process comes across that copy of Lost in the boot sector. Not
		to mention, that if they do manage to remove the virus from the boot
		sector, its all over common storage anyway. And what of your Nav
		programs? They\'re screwed also. 

	Can you say Crash and Burn? Yep. Well, actually, if you boot from a
	protected backup copy of your operating system, you may get Maira up and
	running, but the moment that you access common storage, with all your
	shipboard information on it, you come across the virus again. Hope you
	got a vaccine program handy. Or, do you want to just WIPE common storage
	completely and rebuild from protected backups (That\'ll probably take you
	about two days. Nasty!!). So, sorry Scott. Not quite as simple as all that.
	Now, the scenario I ran above is possible today. In say another 5000 years,
	imagine the horrible little routines they\'ll be writing.

															Anthony Neal

	Yeah, it\'s me again.

		After my last note, I thought about the system and the lack
	of development of computer equipment and the role of computers in the
	Traveller society. I mean, today we\'re pretty well swamped by these
	little technological pets as it is, what about 5000 years down the
	road? What programs are available and how good are they? What does
	the average Imperial citizen do per day that involves direct inter-
	action with computers.

		And what of the computer hacker?!? Is he alive and well
		in the future, or has he/she (sorry --^) starving with
		only an 8088 at his disposal... 

		I would really like to see a little more computer use in the
	Traveller system, since it seems to me that they are too flexible a 
	thing to just die out. The rules seem to treat them in the fashion of
	"Yeah, they\'re there, just don\'t ask me about them...". 

		And what of robots? MT mentions them in the Imperial Encyclo-
		pedia (?) but we don\'t have any examples or constuction rules
		to go by, except for the fabled "Robots" booklet, which I have
		had on order for over a year, but has never come in.

		Us Technorganisms have to have our computers and robots or else
	we get real cranky. I\'ve tried improvising, even raiding a few things
	from GURPS and 2300. (By the way, GURPS Cyberpunk has the best system
	on computers I\'ve seen so far. I tried adapting it but got a headache
	real quick.)

		So, a desperate plea goes to the masses of the TML... Where\'s
	my workstation?... Where\'s my C3PO, or R2-D2?

Agreed.  I believe that a well-designed and competently-managed computer
system can be made effectively invulnerable to viruses, and I think that
attempts to do this are soon going to become a major selling point here
in the 20th century.  Surely by the 57th century the need for suitable
defensive measures will be taken for granted.

Heartily agreed.  We have had more than enough upheaval already.  If
GDW really wants to proceed with this Star Viking stuff, I would be
much happier if they set it in a completely different game universe
rather than twisting our beloved Traveller universe to fit it.

Fakh Goudza Grav Fighting Vehicle TL13 (Vargr)

     The Fakh Goudza is a general purpose grav fighting vehicle manufactured 
by several planets in the Vargr Extents.  Its name is taken from a large 
carnivorous bird on the planet of its design.  It bears certain similarities 
to the Imperial Gryphon GFV, but is intended to have an auxiliary role as a 
troop carrier.  Roomy seats allow four infantrymen in battledress with grav 
belts to be deployed when advantageous.  It also carries a non-homogeneous 
computer array, with a Model 4 available for control of combat operations.  
The Fakh Goudza\'s armor and controls are space rated, and the vehicle can be 
launched from orbit for a planetary assault operation. Armament is laid out 
"over and under", with the pulse laser in a remote turret on the upper sur-
face of the vehicle, and the fusion gun in a turret on the lower surface. The 
two smaller lasers are mounted in side sponsons, and are intended for anti-
personnel use.

Coriander class Free Trader TL12

     The Coriander class Free Trader is a standard Imperial Data Package 
design, although it is not often built because of its rather unusual 300 ton 
hull.  Most shipyard equipment is specialized for either the 200 or the 400 
ton standard hulls.  The standard version of the Coriander includes two 
triple missile turrets and a triple sandcaster turret for self-defense.  Fuel 
scoops are carried for emergency use, but the usual operating practice would 
be to purchase unrefined fuel immediately upon landing at a starport, and 
process it while cargo loading and unloading is going on. Common variations 
on the design include removing the low berths in favor of an additional 270kl 
of cargo space, and adding a berth for some sort of subsidiary craft.

Hyperbolic Light Air Raft TL14 (Military Version)

     The Hyperbolic is a low cost grav vehicle intended for military light 
utility work.  With a sealed cabin, it can operate in contaminated environ-
ments, and a laser communicator provides jam-resistant comm capability for 
the users.  Up to 0.5 tons of cargo can be carried externally with no loss of 
performance.

     The Hyperbolic is a low cost grav vehicle intended for military light 
utility work.  Because of its popularity with the general public, a civilian-
ized version with reduced electronics is also produced. The civilian version 
has a smaller power plant, and features a larger seat for the driver and an 
expanded cargo compartment, but is externally identical.

I have three concerns about NewTraveller:
 o Is vehicle/spaceship design going to be impossible?  I don\'t care if
   they give you a system to do it or not, as long as they don\'t make it
   impossible to do.
 o Is combat going to be oversurvivable?
 o I combat going to be overemphasized?  I make this separate because the
   original Traveller fell into this trap with Mercenary, etc.  I\'ve been
   to a number of Traveller convention games, and 90% are mercenary
   tickets.  If you don\'t design your character with Book 4, you\'re DEAD.

I have heard all three of the above of T:2000.  If they fix these, and
don\'t do another half-assed job pulling it all together, then I say go
ahead, change the system.  But DON\'T give me half of a system, then try to
sell me a new rules supplement every few months.  That would be my message
to GDW.

The virus thing is ridiculous.  Sure, it\'ll happen.  Someone will write
a virus that learns how to replicate itself and adapt.  But if I\'m on a
spaceship, I\'m going to make DAMNED SURE that the computer keeping ME
ALIVE is not susceptible in this way.  In fact, a variation of the same
virus will let me insure this.  But I\'ll let that one go, since it is,
after all, a game.  In fact, it could bring the scope of the game back
down to where it belongs.  No more fighting grand battles in the name of
the [fill in your favorite faction/government/race here].  Huzzah!

  Roche limit is quoted (in the Britannica) to be 2.5 diameters of the
primary. The 380 odd thousand kilometers of Luna\'s orbit are quite outside
the limit.

  There are (presently) two different versions of how to use computers in the
future: The first is the classic cyberspace or matrix where you put the human
in the computer, the second is to put the computers in the environment.
  There is a good article in the September Scientific American (special 
edition about networks and computers) on the second version. Xerox is as usual
doing interesting things at Palo Alto. I wonder how long until Apple steals it
and sues Xerox for it? :)
 
  In short the \'computers in the environment\' idea is to computerize the
environment with computerized papers, notes and boards all networked togeather
with short range radio or ir links and all working transparantely.
  And since cyberpunk is more or less absent from Traveller, this might be a
way to explain it.

> 	The rules seem to treat them in the fashion of

  That is close to what \'computers in the environment\' tries to do. There
would however be severe effects if someone who is trained to depend on 
ubiquitous computers had to work without them. (That might be a rationalization
of the severe TL effects on skills...)
 
  But, read the Palo Alto article in Scientific American, I can infact recommend
that entire issue, even though I neither work for Xerox or Scientific American:)

	Has anyone ever tried to calculate the missle warp efficiency?
Not ONE of the missiles conforms to the rules of the warp calculation.
When the speed is correct, the weight is wildly off.

My favourite can of worms has been opened (yet again).....
[ I\'m not going to make any comments about the rumoured \'new\' version of
  Trav, except that they\'d better do it right! ]


In message (2918?) Burton says:

I\'ve got the same gripe with missiles.  Mayday had an almost reasonable system
for missiles (you had counters and they moved and could accelerate in a rather
limited fashion).  The problems with having missiles as ships is that you can
arrange to defend against them multiple times (by not getting hit until a
later turn), which may seriously impair the effectiveness of missiles.  I
think that was the agreement Bertil and I arrived at when we discussed this
topic.


>With a 30 second turn (3 personal combat turns), the hexes are 4.5km across
>(so we\'ll fudge it to 5km).

5km is getting awfully small, how many ships can you stack into a hex?
A 1Mton battleship is a measly 150m diameter sphere so you could get lots
of them in, however a cyclinder of the same volume with a base area of
10000m^2 (=1 hectare) is 1.35 km long (and the cross-section need not be
anything like that big).  A cone/wedge configuration will be even worse.
If I was in one of those \'big\' ships, I wouldn\'t desire another one inside
the same hex as I was in.  [ I do know that ships of those sizes are not
really combat capable but they do serve as an example ].  Having 5km hexes is
also going to cause some havoc with ranges....how far can you see in space?
(a very large number of hexes).  Active sensors are going to have some really
impressive ranges (0.1 light seconds is almost 30000km, 6000 hexes for a round
trip).  This would tend to make having sensors pretty much a non-issue,
especially for the long range EMS ones.

Not a bad idea.  It shouldn\'t be too difficult to work something out along
these lines.

I kind of like this point.  The TDR ship people should have a look at this
to see if could be implanted without too many devistating side-effects.
It would also make ships even easier to damage which has to be a good thing :-)

Going towards SFB would make the ship design process much more interesting.  You
suddenly have to allocate positions for all of your weapons and (I presume)
firing arcs (cones?) for them.  This would add some details for die-hard board
gamers; while for the rest of us who really don\'t like lots of paperwork, it
would make the entire process quite tedious.  I made the suggestion (to Bertil
again ;-) that agility be used for multiple different tasks ---- I seem to
remember that the three we came up with were: maneuvering, evasion, aiming of
fixed mount weapons.  Maneuvering is simply how fast/far you can move in a
round;  Evasion gives all incoming attacks a reduced penetration; and Aiming
gives you a bonus on your to-hit/damage (I forget which) for spinal mounts/any
fixed weapon.  These three different aspects all got allocated out of your
ship\'s agility pool.  i.e. you got to trade them off against each other.
I think that this might give a first order approximation to the excessive
system that SFB uses.  [ I don\'t mean to sound so hard on SFB, I actually
enjoy playing it ]

  (originally a part of my other reply, but I had to check some figures)

  I agree that people can stand too much damage in T2k, but two .50cal is an
exaggeration. If we take the Joe A Average (A is for Above:) with 6 in all
stats (1-10 is the range) he will be slightly damaged at <=12 hits in the
head, seriously damaged at <=24 hits and dead at 25 and up.
  A .50cal does 8D of damage, average of 3.5 per die gives 28, wich means that
he has more than 50% chance of being dead. And there is a 100% chance of he
being unconcious.

  If we include the quick kill rule we will get something like the following
figures on the risk of dying or getting unconcious from one hit on a random
part of the body:

  d6 of damage	%dead	%unconcious	weapon
	1	2%	5%		7mm revolvers and autos
	2	4%	12%		9mm autos & smg\'s
	3	6%	12%		5.56N
	4	8%	12%		7.62
	6	12%	34%		some elephant guns
	8	17%	50%		.50cal (shotgun at close does 9D)
	10	19%	55%		some bloc HMG (?)

  On the other hand, if we make the simple modification of halving the damage
to each hit location that characters can stand*, and apply this on 
Joe A Average II we will get this:
  
  d6 of damage	%dead	%unconcious	weapon
	1	2%	5%		7mm revolvers and autos
	2	4%	12%		9mm autos & smg\'s
	3	8%	31%		5.56N
	4	11%	52%		7.62
	6	15%	75%		some elephant guns
	8	18%	81%		.50cal (shotgun at close does 9D)
	10	19%	90%		some bloc HMG (?)

  * I agree, it is a patch, but compared to some of the patches for 
MegaTraveller it is small and non-intrusive, and it is only used once: on
character generation.

a successful rpg is one that not only catches the eye of the

a myth than planet-hopping.

I just don\'t want to encourage destruction of the (to date) best

Welcome back to the semi-permament TML PBEM!
Here is part one of a summary of PBEM activity to date.  You     
people are really pretty good writers.  This is a good story -
even if it is a littel soap-opera-ish in places.

Summarizing, it\'s hard to believe it took two years to get here.

- ---- Important Admin stuff ----

In keeping with our charter and tradition, I am echoing official
turns to the TML.  If this becomes a problem for non-pbem TML\'ers
please let me know right away and we\'ll work something out.


There are some new groups of characters not mentioned here in
this turn.  It\'s Okay.  Those affected, go ahead and make your 
introductions just as you indicated to me. I have assumed that 
three inbound distress signals, simultaneously is just *too* 
much of a coincidence, so coming in this way autmatically staggers
your entries, just a little.  Come on in, get introduced and 
we\'ll get rolling.



Rule changes for turn 91:

1) Let\'s try to keep things to one-day (or less) turn intervals.
   That\'s game time, not our time.  What I mean is make one or two
   (three if you _must_) private/public postings, and then quit,
   no matter how much it hurts.  Then I can get in and quickly
   re-synchronize everyone and we\'ll get going again.  Hopefully
   this way I can get more, smaller, turns out, more frequently.

   If this doesn\'t work well, we\'ll change it.


2) As of now, enrollment is CLOSED.  We\'re not taking new characters
   until we have an open-enrollment period, probably during winter 
   break.  
   
   New listeners are welcome.  Just go ahead and send a message to
   pbem-request@engrg.uwo.ca and we\'ll add you to the listeners list.
   Listeners get all the pbem public messages, not just official
   turns. 


3) Remember to use the pbem aliases at engrg.uwo.ca.  James is 
   posting the list, and we\'ll keep instructions handy in case you
   need to get another set.



=================Summary========================================= 

Our adventure began in about 1119 on one of the unnamed systems,
in the Illelish sector, on the edge of the rift between this
sector and Reaver\'s Deep.    A company claiming to be a field office 
of Turnskaad Enterprises of the Spinward Marches has advertised for 
a crew to expolore and perform scientific investigation.  
(See Atlas of the Imperium)

(Originally, I didn\'t have a particular name or place, but
some of these detail-oriented types have been twisting my arm for 
two years.)


Shortly after the Human\'s emperor Strephon was assasinated, his
nephew, Lucan, asked the Daibei to invade the Illelish territories.
They refused and declared their independence.  Systems just on the
other side of the rift between Reaver\'s Deep and Illelish felt
threatened nonetheless, and actively recruited all manner of arms
and arms bearers, waiting for the almost certain invasion from
Dulinor, Aslan, Daibei, Solomani, or Margaret.  
(See Rebellion Sourcebook.)


With this in mind, the offer from Turnskaad quickly attracted all 
manner of adventurers interested in something other than defending 
another rock against another would-be tyrant.  After being given some 
titilating information, about thirty people agreed, more or less in 
the blind, to sign up for a mission they know little about.  

Turnskaad representatives showed these volunters holo\'s of an intact 
ringworld "somewhere just outside the imiperial border."  A few of 
the less adventursome backed out then, and the excitement of those 
remaining was intense.  Here\'s the text of the original briefing:

- ----
We have recently received information from one of our private scouts
that a ringworld exists in a nebula not far from here.  Our scout
was able to make only one pass, and that off the ecliptic, so we
don\'t know much about the overall picture. We have named this find
`R-alpha\', after the code sequence used ot designate the find.

(A holo of a slim, shiny band reflecting the light of a yellow-green
star forms near the speaker.  This is a moving holo, obviously from
the cameras of a passing ship, and time compressed.  The band slowly
resolves into what must be a ring, although the nearer side is
washed out by the light of the star.  The ring is almost vertical in
the holo.)

The one pass indicated excess energy generation at several
locations, habitable oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, and methane.
Methane does not occur except as a by-product of animal life, or
geological metamorphasis, so we strongly suspect widespread life.

The holo shows 8 or 9 distinct "warm spots" on the ring as the star
characteristically dims through an IR-viewing filter.  The ring
rapidly expands, and then the time-compression slows as the camera
pans to follow the inner surface of the ring.  Geographic features
such as low hills and small seas are visible.  So are clouds.

Whoever built this didn\'t create it for just a game preserve.  We
need to explore it as much as possible in the next few months.  
Naturally there is potential for huge economic and miltary benefit 
if you can uncover information, artifacts, and so forth.  We have 
posted a bond of 10,000 ICr for the first working artifact found.

The holo fades out. The lights come back up.

Also, discoveries like this are hard to keep secret.  Time is
critical.  We estimate you have at most six months to do all your
investigative work before competitors force you off the world.  If
you can get back in time, we can make at least a salvage or
colonization claim on R-alpha before someone else can move in.

Because of the nature of your teams, and of this world, you will be
spending extended periods well away from other teams and from your
ship.  You need to be prepared.  We are providing inital training,
and making certain equipment available to you at a reduced cost.
Your checks will be held here until your return.  (Isn\'t that just
like a big outfit, to collect the interest on your labor...)

...

Again folks, think on what you will need to perform your mission.
You might have to live off the land, you might need to move quickly,
and you might need to fight hard just to survive.  Next week we will
move out to the asteroids, where the Alcyon is parked, and where we
have a supply depot to help you make final personal and mission
purchases.


(and there were the inevitable questions:)

        What exactly do you mean by `artifact\'?

We\'re searching for unique and previously unknown items.  We\'re 
offering the reward for a truly natable scientific, military,
historical, or economic find.  It doesn\'t have to be a TL17
`thingy\' (of course that wouldn\'t hurt).  It does have to be
something that we as a multi-racial empire have never before
built, dreamed of, or considered.  Like a practical way to 
communicate with plants, or make a jump 7, or just be able
to have a viable artificial intelligence.


	The intro mentioned subs.  I sure hope that there are some 
	automated probes and robots for doing some of the observations.

Yes there are.  You have both disposable and recoverable probes and
robots for this mission.


	Are there any company represetatives coming? 
	or are we on our own? 

This mission is your baby.  I will probably drop by to check up
your status, exchange mail, etc. though.
(As expected, they lied... There is a company lawyer along.)


	"Umm, just how big is the ringworld?  

Its stellar radius is roughly 1.5 X 10^8 kilometers.  It\'s roughly 
3000 kilometers wide.  It has `vertical\' sides roughly 100 kilometers
high, to hold in its air.  Actually, in a general sense, it is one
*huge* valley between two *tall* mountain ranges.


	So how large surface area does R-alpha have?

Roughly 10^12 km^2.  This is on the order of 10^4 times the surface
area of a planet like Terra.  (More habitable area than the whole 
Imperium!)


	And how long will we have to explore it?  

Not long.  Only a few months at most.  We expect, knowing how 
communications and response work, that at least two of the major
belligerents for the throne will arrive in 4 to 6 months time.
Rather than `explore\' per se, we\'d prefer you concentrated on
getting everything you can from R-alpha.  Physically and scientifically.



	Also, if there is an undiscovered sapient race with some degree
	of technological development, what will be mission policy 
	regarding contact and establishment of relations with the locals?"

That\'s up to the on-scene commander.  Just remember that they\'re a lot
less likely to be welcomed into civilization when and if Lucan and Dulinor
start duking it out over \'er under? their heads.


...

Insurance:
I\'m passing out insurance and salvage agreements today.  You do not
have to fill these out.  However if you do not, salvage is assumed
to belong to Turnskaad fully, rather than leaving you a finders
portion, and Turnskaad is the default beneficiary of your life
insurance.  It really is in your personal interest to fill these
out.



Mission Equipment:
Everyone will be equipped with a TL15 scout-type vacc suit, except
for the members of the security team, who will have armored vacc
suits issued.  We expect everyone on the team to be in continuous
contact, at least in terms of location; all issue vacc suits have
ELT\'s (emergency locator transponders) built in.  The ELT\'s signal
the base ship every 30 minutes and relay your health and location
information.  More details are available if you\'re curious.

TL13 Stun pistol with a variety of drug charges is the standard 
issue sidearm.  You are expected to have this with you at all times, 
loaded.  You will receive some rudimentary training in selecting the
proper drugs to use in various situtations.  Of course, this does
not preclude your wearing or using your favorite sidearm; we just
want you all to have a visible reminder that this is initially a
peaceful mission.

Personal medikits are available from ship\'s stores.  A slightly more
substantial party-sized kit is assigned to each team\'s carrier.

Hand computers (TL15) will be issued to those who do not already
have them.  If you wish to buy one, you can do so at a discount, as
with all personal equipment you purchase for this mission.  (Send me
a list of equipment you wish, together with suggested price from
some book if you have a price.  I will indicate which are assigned,
which are for the ship, and which you need to lease or purchase.
For items to purchase I will assign a disocunt price.  After
everyone has bought what they want, I\'ll tell you how I figured the
discount, if you\'re interested :-).)

Items of a more sensitive nature, such as military-style hardware
are available at our asteroid spaceport.  You will be leaving for
there this afternoon.  (So send in your lists for this stuff, too.)
Of course, further comunications with the outside will be limited
after this, so if you\'ve got any farewells to send, better do it
this morning.

Everyone went out to an asteroid clump, and started training.  Here
they got their first view of the Alcyon:

The reason for the tugs becomes apparant as you enter the cluster.  For 
those on the shuttle, you\'ll get to see it when you disembark.  In a 
parllel orbit is an enormous, spider-like tetrahedron.  In the center
of the tetrahedron is what seems to be a large engine-like structure.
This center engine is roughly 400 tons (volume) in its own right.

The engine faces one apex, with exhaust through the center of one of
the tetrahedron\'s faces.  Each of the four apexes connects to the 
central engine, as well as to each of the other three corners with 
strong structural members.  A fine mesh covers the front three faces
of the tetrahedron, and most of the rear face.  At the front 
of the Alcyon is a bridge and crew compartment.  The other three apexes
are obviously reserved for ships to connect to.  

The fine mesh is the Alcyon\'s lanthanum grid.  Beneath the grid, and 
well connected to all eight of the structural beams are bags of some
strong, light weight, material.  These seem to be collapsible fuel bags.
Presently they float limply, about half full.

Several figures in vacc suits labor about the Alcyon even now, preparing 
her for flight.

...

They met their "launch director".

Tonight, the three ships you brought will be attached to the Alcyon
for the jump to R-alpha.  You have (she eyes her notes) two scout
ships and a merchant -- all streamlined it says here.  Good.  There
is a 200T cargo bay on the Alcyon in addition to what is on your ships.
Most of the heavy equipment requested for this trip is already on board.

You might want to do some cargo shuffling tomorrow, so that your merchant
ship can carry some of the larger items down without having to shift 
cargo after you arrive.

The Alcyon is a jump tender.  A little more advanced in some ways than
the traditional ones, though.  Access ways are provided between each of
the ships and the central core.  One ship\'s location has been replaced
by bridge, computing, and life support for a small crew.  Enough fuel
should be on board to provide two jump 5\'s without refueling.  You might
be able to stretch that with some tinkering with your ships and so forth
in an emergency.

Only a very minimal maneuver drive is available on the Alcyon herself.
Just enough to keep her oriented, not really enough to accelerate or
fend off any serious gravity.  The software is installed to use your
ship\'s engines for this, though.  {ref: OK transport crew - how much
acceleration we gonna get?}  (Answer came back - 0.25g, 0.5g with
all four ships churning hydrogen.)


Likewise, the Alcyon is pretty defensless without your ships.  Only a
double laser turret and a sand caster up front.  There just isn\'t any
good place to put a hard point that won\'t damage the Alcyon more than 
whatever you\'re firing at.

Overall, what this means is that with the Alcyon you\'ve got range and
speed over interstellar distances.  But you\'ve got to rely on each 
your own ships for some of the work.  Likewise, it means that wherever
you go, you get there together; no party scattering due to misjumps.
Once you\'re there, your navigators will quickly figure out where you
are, and in a pinch, you can scuttle the Alcyon more cheaply than
a `real\' ship and bug out individually.  


- ----

A day and a half later, the Alcyon was tugged out of the small gravity
well of the asteroids.  Just before firing off the chemical strap-on
boosters to give her some initial speed, she was met by a shuttle
making some last inute crew changes.  A couple of people got recalled
to active duty, one had to go home, and Turnskaad threw another
genralist/scientist on board.  (I wanted to play a little, too.)

The second night of the first jump, all was going well and the crew
held a falling-down, staggering in 0-g party.  (Then, summer arrived,
I had some serious mailer problems, and ...) everyone woke up five 
days later.  They hurriedly prepared for their pre-arranged re-fueling
rendezvous and re-entered normal space.

Just before re-entry, one of the crew discovered a locator beacon,
seemingly of Solomani design, in with the cargo brought aboard
the Alcyon.  An immediate interior search revealed no further
bugs, and no more clues to the one they found.  Dissecting it 
indicated it sent a coded radio "squirt" just before jump entry,
revealing the ship\'s course.

The bridge team immediately went to work building computer
programs and monitors to watch for, trap, reocrd, and effectively
prevent another broacsast.

During the rendezvous, some engineers and security went outside
to inspect the ship and grid, some crew were transferred to and
form the troop/cargo ship Anslinger, and fuel was pumped aboard
from a snowball carrier.  Outside, the ship\'s reporter newstaped
the entire operation.

After crew transfers, and when the bags were at ~80%, an imperial
fleet was detected leaving jump in the same (empty) sector of 
space.  Emergency disconnect was made, Turnskaad\'s ships making
violent, distracting maneuvers while the Alcyon\'s mains came on
line.  Some engineers were almost trapped outside, and one, 
Anton Devious lost his foot because of an air lock malfunction 
during the emergency.

The fleet was tenatively identified as one of Lucan\'s, although
the ID was not definite.  The snowball sprayed hydrogen between
the Alcyon and the fleet, and jumped.  As Alcyon jumped, they 
ignited the  hydrogen to blind the fleet\'s sensors (at least
temporarily) to their neutrino trail.


- ----
About this same time, the Aslan exploration vessel Trakh,
on a foray into the rift, discovered a green star with a 
regular pulsation, and jumped toward it.

Also, about this same time, R-alpha\'s natives are receiving omens
of impending visitors, and are preapring to recive them.  The
thoughtful and religious Jijid are meditating and chanting.  The
agressive Kythui don\'t really care, and the telpathic Phins
communied with "the Hoop" and prepared for the arrival of "the 
Visitors".


- ----

The following week, sciences section determined that the surface
gravity of R-alpha should be about 1g, that the atmosphere appeared
to be breathable, and there were definite signs of inteeligence:
a power distribuiton network, low-intensity neutrino flux, airborne
pollutants, etc.   

Medical section discovered that Sgt. Major Hammer died of Curare the
night of the party, that whatever put people out for five days was
soewhat counteracted or amplified by what booster shots the victims
had received just before leaving (That\'s why some died, some got
sick, and some had no ill effects.), and that it was a short-lived
airborne binary gas, apparantly delivered from the now-connected
air ducts of the Paladin.  They also got Devious stabilized, slowed,
and into a cold berth to await later work (i.e. player to return)
since his foot was now light years away, and vacuum packed.


Command and security put together a select team to search the Paladin,
whose owner died of the gas delivered the night of the party.  What 
they found was a wonderful, hi-tech exploratory ship, and the empty
bottles, together with evidence that whoever delivered the gas was
no longer aboard.


Day five of the jump, a hydrogen line ruptured in engineering during
routine maintenance and flash-froze M.T. who shattered when he fell 
to the deck.  Other injuries were minor, except for Silvmane, who
recovered extremely rapidly.

This event got a few of the more paranoid minds together to consider
the modus operandi of the sabateur.  Early day seven of the jump,
security sealed off the passageways near engineering, and a few of
the officers destroyed Leadfoot.   They decided to take immediate, 
positive action against the agressor, and it is covered in more detail
in turn 10.9d and 10.9e.  Basically, they unleashed a fusion-powered
holocaust in the drive room, and injured several.  Leadfoot is "dead".

	



Shortly before re-entry, commander Ger addresses the crew of the Alcyon.

...

"Well, we\'ll be arriving shortly.  We have now completed the *easy* 
part of our mission.  I have it on good authority our sabteur has
met his maker."  He smiles wryly at Abuko.  

"Now, we are about to visit a single world with the same habitable 
surface area as all of the inhabited worlds in the Imperium put 
together." He pauses to let that sink in.  "There are fewer than
forty of us.  We have to find the history of a long-dead race, find 
an intelligent species, and prevent Imperial conflicts from destroying 
this gem of an artifact.

"We are much better prepared for this part of our mission than we were 
for sabotage, however.  Look around you.  We are scientists, we are 
engineers, we are scouts.  Only a few of us are trained killers."  He
slows down just a little.  "And all of us, _all_ .. _of_ .._us_, have
worked our whole lives for this moment.  For this opportunity.

"You have demonstrated a teamwork on board these last few weeks.  
You have demonstrated tenacity in adversity.  And you have demonstrated 
an ability to adapt.  All of these are needed and will serve us in good 
stead in our coming venture. 

"When MY grandchildren ask me what it was like, I will proud to tell them
how wonderful it was to serve with the greatest collection of explorers
ever assembled. 

"I salute each and every one of you.

...





Several hours later, almost at the predicted moment, the jump warning
sounds, and the lights dim.  Once again, everyone is subjected to that
annoying, nauseating, tumbling, feeling, and the pale blue glow on all
the outside monitors is replaced by starlight and sunlight.

Everyone hears, from just over her or his left shoulder a quiet, soothing,
alien, voice.  In each person\'s native tounge comes the message:

"Welcome.  We have been expecting you.  An envoy will be up shortly
to show you where to dock.  The peace of the cosmos be with you."

None of the typical intercept or probing signals appear on the ship\'s
sensors.


Looking out any viewport, you can see just how good a jump this was.
In an arc stretching from as far as you can see forward to as far as
you can see aft, and slightly below the Alcyon, is a wall of dark, gray,
metal, with sunlight shining off the edges.  Far forward you can see
a second arc and far aft is a third.  These two are tiny silvery bands
that begin well away from the vanishing points of the metal floor, and
extend around, behind, and above a shimmering greenish-yellow star.
These tiny bands almost connect above the star, giving the appearance
of a halo.  Keen eyes detect a very slight fuzziness at the edges of
the "floor" near you.

Inward from the first ring, a second becomes visible.  It is in a plane
with the first ring, but much smaller, and much darker.   

The inside of the ring is visible fore and aft of Alcyon as the wall
arcs away from you.  You can clearly see forests, seas, deserts, islands,
continets, and various signs of life - villages, smoke, roads.  Motion
detectors tell of flying creatures as well.


The speed of rotation of the ring is much more than the speed of your
orbit.  The breathtaking view literally flies by as sciences asks Christian
to have Lucan or Dulinor bring a couple more cases of holo-crystals 
up to the lab.



================

Seconds later the hull reverberates with the dull metallic thunks of
couplings detatching themselves from the Alcyon.  All three riders, 
the Talisman, the Paladin, and the Aurora, detach from the Alcyon\'s 
hull, followed by the slow emergence of the command shuttle from the 
central core of the tender.  The Paladin begins to accelerate down 
and away, beginning to match speeds with the ring.  The Talisman 
moves off the plane of the ecliptic, to take high-altitude obser-
vations.  The Aurora begins to move to a high-guard position.

>From the surface of R-alpha a shuttle emerges, broadcasting a welcome 
message and instructions to follow them to a landing/docking facility.
At this moment, the universal distress channel comes to life.  An
Ael Yael ship has had an accident and is incoming.  The Aurora lights
up like a chemical rocket and off toward the distress signal, the 
command shuttle moving into high-guard position.


Meanwhile, on the surface below, the inner ring moves in its faster
orbit, and its dithered density filters begin to allow light onto 
the village of the Kyth.  Sunlight reveals thousands of the nomads
doming into the village for their annual celebration of victory over
hardship.  And, on the knoll just outside of town, the crew of the
Trakh prepare for alien contact.


It is deep night in the middle of the village of the Jijid.  Tehadazi,
the wise woman has awakened from a disturbing dream.  In this dream,
she was on a strange world where the sun was on the horizon, and it
was _cold_.  She has neve felt cold in her life, and everyone knows
the sun is always overhead.  It is disquieting.  She looks out at the
stars, and sees one moving, first this way, then that, and thinks back
to the discussion she had just a few days ago about visions of 
visitors and moving stars.   


Aboard the shuttle, Nishu\'s board comes up with a solution to one 
of the programs he and Etienne loaded \'way back when\'.  "Got our
location sir."  

(for completeness .. It\'s hex 1501 in the Reaver\'s Deep sector, as
listed in the "Atlas of the Imperium".  I know this is technically
inside the imperium, but - okay ya got lied to before.  :=)  It might
very well be in a nebula, and it is jump 5 away form about three
different planet systems.  It\'s close to Solomani, Aslan, Dulinor,
Margaret, Daibei, and not too terribly far from the Vargr.)


As the action moves away from the Alcyon, lights throughout the
ship shut themselves off in preprogrammed sequence as the ship 
prepares for orbital station-keeping.



=============
OK folks - light \'em up!  
(If this doesn\'t get ya goin\', see turns 10.9d and 10.9e from 
 last season.)

First, these friends participate in a D&D-like PBM tournament thing, 
for which they pay-by-turn.  The people who run this use a modified
DOS system to create character match ups and evaluate combat - 
essentially off-line, and then results are posted.  They make money
doing this in just the Portland area.

It would work with MT.  Certainly not with me running it.  I 
don\'t want to so severely constrain characters actions, make 
such a small subset of involvement.

We have about 40 people, all over the world, playing in a _free_
PBEM.  This tournament thing has >100 in the Portland area.  
It just wouldn\'t pay.  At least not the way we\'re doing it.

Finally, I guess Bertil is right.  I\'m not sure that collectively
you could pay me enough to want to do this full-time.  :=)

So?  All that means is that you\'re using your agility (and at least one weapon
system) to evade (and attempt to destroy) the missile, rather than chase (and
attempt to destroy) the enemy.  Isn\'t this one of the functions of missiles in
real air warfare?

So having two ships in the same hex may result in a collision?  Good.  If two
ships manage to get that close to one another, some roll should be made to see
if they collide, especially if one is trying to ram the other.  (E.g. if one
is a missile.)

This is the problem, of course.  Either you need _very_ small hexes, plus a
microscope to see the ship models/markers, or you only use this level of
detail at close range.

This isn\'t too bad for small ships with a few weapons, but how do you fancy
allocating the firing arcs of 20 batteries?  Or (in the case of a big
battle-wagon) 100+ batteries?  I suppose the best way would be to find how
many batteries you have of a certain weapon type, and then decide how many
you want in each of six general arcs - front, back, port, starboard, up, down.
Except that some weapons could cover more than one of these arcs; anyone want
to figure out a rule for what percentage of weapons can cover multiple arcs?
Or would we have to draw up accurate 3-D plans of every ship we design, and
then put weapons onto them and figure out where they can fire?

Ooops.  Ok.  It\'s my own fault for not checking facts before I sound off.  I
have that nasty habit.  Usually my memory is excellent for trivia of that sort,
and I tend to rely on it to the exclusion of other sources of information.
Hopefully, I will have learned my lesson from this semi-public humiliation  8+)

HELLO!
 
I\'ve been a member of TML for a few days now, and I feel that it is about
time to introduce myself.  My name is Guy Garnett, although I frequently go 
by the handle "Derek Wildstar" here on the internet.  I have been a
Traveller player and referee since 1980, when I was introduced to the game
by an 18-hour session at a BaltiCon.  I recently wound up a MegaTraveller
campaign, and am rather dissatisfied with the rules.  Although I noticed
many problems, the ones which stand out in my mind include the starship
combat rules and vehicle construction.  My current plans include a number
of projects, two of which are probably of interest to TML members.
 
WASHINGTON DC AREA?
 
First of all, I would like to contact (or form) a group of people in my
area (the Washington DC metro area) to play MegaTraveller, Classic
Traveller, and/or to design and playtest Traveller variants.  If you are
in my area (or know someone who is) please send me Email (or even call
at a reasonable hour of the evening at (301)-384-6946 and leave voice-mail).
 
A MEGATRAVELLER FANZINE
 
Secondly, I am in the planning stages for a Traveller fan-zine, with a 
working title of "M-T Variant".  I believe that the biggest problem with
Traveller (and its current incarnation, MegaTraveller) is a failure of the
imagination.  It seems to me that Marc Miller (and the GDW Traveller crew),
along with Joe Fugate (and the DGP staff) are stuck in a rut.  MegaTraveller
is essentially The Traveller Book, plus Mercenary, High Guard, and Striker
(but with additional errors inserted, to keep us on our toes).  It is
saddled with a stack of compromises for play-balance and to stay compatible
with decisions made fifteen years ago.
 
M-T Variant will be intended to be an alternative to GDW and DGP controlled
Traveller information sources.  The intent is to make contact with people who
are not part of the MegaTraveller mainstream, both on and off of the internet,
and to disseminate their new and exciting ideas about Traveller and its 
universe.  The Traveller universe is vast, and there must be thousands of
ideas which have not (and maybe even cannot) be covered by the powers that be.
 
In order to do this, I will need advice and (most importantly) submissions.
This is where you folks come in.  While I have published user group and fan
club newsletters before, this will be a new thing for me, and I probably
can\'t do it alone (I know I can\'t write that much material all by myself,
even if I did have a stockpile of ideas bigger than my house).
 
In addition to things like errata and lots and lots of vehicle designs, I
want to include all kinds of tips and tricks to all aspects of playing the
game, from plotting campaigns to designing vehicles.  Most importantly, I
would like new variants and MegaTraveller sub-systems.  Everything from 
vehicle designs (of which TML has a large number of very good designs) and 
items like Scott Kellogg\'s "Why I Break the Rules" through stuff like the 
(well done) "FireFight" combat system to the meticulous "MachineTools".  What
do folks on the mailing list think of this idea?  Would you (and particularly
the authors of the things I mentioned above) like to contribute?
 
A couple of last-minute thoughts about M-T Variant.  One is that it should
be possible to dump the ASCII text of each issue out of my DTP software, so
that it could be made available at one of the TML FTP sites.  Secondly, I
wonder if it would be possible to include some of the discussions from TML
in a special column in the \'zine.  What does everyone think of these ideas?
 
COMPUTER VIRUSES
 
I have noticed the ongoing discussion about NewTraveller/Star-Vikings and
computer viruses.  In my Classic Traveller campaigns computer viruses have 
almost never been a problem, even though many players and characters have
tried.  I have always assumed that computers in the far future would be
adequately protected by one of a number of schemes.  The one that I have 
added to my Traveller universe works as follows.
 
Computer programs are stored in an encrypted format.  The method used is a 
type of "public-key" cryptography.  Two keys are used, one for encryption, 
and one for decryption.  Authorized programs are encrypted using a standard
hardware encryption unit (actually a very simple computer, with a hard-wired
and unchangeable program).  Under the control of the computer operator, a
program is enctypted using a secret key (which is unique to each computer
system) entered by the operator.  This encryption key is *NEVER* stored in  
the computer, but is maintained seperately in a secure location.  A 
decription unit inside the computer uses the corresponding decryption key
(semi-permanently installed in the unit) to prepare the program for execution. 
If the program fails the decryption step, it is unauthorized or altered, 
and cannot be run (as a matter of fact, the failed decryption process has
turned it into gibberish anyway).
 
While a virus (or an unauthorized programmer) could decrypt a program and
alter it (ie: infect it with a virus, timebomb, or worm program), they could
not re-encrypt it; because while the decription key is stored in the computer,
the encryption key in the hands of the authorized operator of the computer. 
And the computer cannot run programs which are not properly encrypted.
 
While this completely elimitates the possibility of a virus infecting a large
number of computers, it does not eliminate computer crime.  If the encryption
key can be obtained and duplicated, an unauthorized program can be
introduced.  If a number of codes can be obtained (say, by an industrial spy
at the computer manufacturer), a virus could be written which can infect any
computers for which it has the codes in its database.  The codes are usually
stored on write-once media (write-once optical cards or holocrystal cylinders
are most common); if the code can be obtained, it can be copied in a matter
of a minute or so.  Security for the codes varies; for example, the Imperial
Navy keeps its codes in a safe under the control of the Chief Navigator.  In
many free traders, security is more lax; and the codes are frequently found
in a desk drawer (maybe locked) near the computer.  With carefull planning
and execution, a daring party of adventurers may be able to obtain the codes
they need.
 
Many types of computer crime can be committed even without altering the
programs which run the computers.  Simply falsifying information in the
myriad databases of a large computer system could alter or erase personnell
records, shipping instructions, inventories, ownership, and many types of
other records.
 
Future societies will be heavily dependent on their computer technology;
ways will be found to adequately protect them.  By devising defenses and
taking proper percautions, things like computer viruses will be a danger,
but one that is understood and defended against.  As an analogy, consider
the human body: it is quite possible for a virus to alter the cellular
program which keeps us alive.  But while cases do occurr, epidemics are
rare.  The combination of our own defense mechanisms, coupled with proper
precautions (like good hygene) keep the problem under control.  In the
here and now, computers are going through the equivalent of the middle
ages: the threats are poorly understood, and proper precautions seem too
impractical to be used routinely.  But in the far future, an epidemic
of computer viruses will be as rare as epidemics of Black Death are today.
Yes, its vaguely within the realm of possibility, but in this case, it
seems so unlikely to me as to defy the suspension of disbelief.  I consider
it much more likely that the Rebellion will create a new Long Night (already, 
I doubt that the Imperial Treasury would honor a draft from the branch 
treasury at Antares; see the entry "Twilight" in the Encyclopedia.  I wonder
how many centuries of rebellion it would take for the last governmental body 
claiming to be the "Third Imperium" to cease to exist?  Of the factions, 
only two, Lucan and Strephon, still cling to the name).
 
STARSHIP DESIGNS
 
I have recently finished reading "To Shining Sea - a history of the US Navy,
1775 to 1991" by Stephen Howarth (a good book, and recommended reading).  In
one instance, he mentions the design parameters of the early Navy Frigates.
They were designed to be able to outrun anything they couldn\'t outfight, and
were remarkably successful at it, (the accuracy of American gunners compared 
to their adversaries helped a lot, too).  So, even though "Frigate" is not
a classification in use by the Imperial Navy, here are a couple of frigates.
Let me know what you think of them.
 
I was aided in designing these by a Quattro Pro spreadsheet of my own
devising.  I am pretty confident that it is accurate, but it certainly would
not hurt to check the numbers out if you think that there is something fishy
about these designs.  As near as I can remember, there are only a few
non-standard computations used.  The major one is that the missile magazine
is *NOT* in a bay, and does *NOT* use hardpoints.  Its volume was calculated
at the total volume of missiles kept in it, and the cost per missile was 
computed at 1/13500 of the cost of a 100 ton bay.  Agility was computed with
the standard MegaTraveller formula; the normal energy consumption of the
maneuver drive *WAS* included in "all other components".  Therefore, agility
represents the additional power available to overdrive the thruster plates, so
that the ship can dodge laterally at up to 6G, or sprint at up to 12G for
short periods of time (enough to spoil someone\'s aim, anyway).  I should
probably note that according to the SOpM, the drives can be run at 140%
indefinitely, making the ships maximum combat accelleration about 8.4G (and
presumably agility would be 3.6).  
 
I have added an endurance section to the UCP, which details the fuel
consumption and endurance of the ships.  Although these ships have unlimited
cruise accelleration (1G, Agility 0), some of my merchant designs only carry
fuel for limited accelleration (typically 9 days at 1G, Agility 0).  The 
endurance section details these limitations and fuel consumption at Max
Accelleration and at Full Combat Power.
 
PA-GUN FRIGATE
 
Constructed as a proof-of-concept ship for the Domain of Deneb Imperial Navy,
this vessel is currently undergoing trials.  If successful, frigate-class
ships can add sigificant, and more importantly, survivable firepower to the 
Domain\'s forces, at approximately the same cost as a standard cruiser.  In
a confrontation with a roughly comprable standard design, the frigate will
be significantly harder to hit, due to its compact hull and extensive
screens.  The design sacrifices jump capability and secondary armament for a
strong primary weapon, high accelleration, and excellent maneuverability.

Captain (over intercom) : "The hijackers have entered the Bridge!  All han..."
Hijacker : "We have control of the bridge.  You will do as I say!"
Gzoe seals the turret hatch, and carefully removes the safety interlocks and
powers up the laser turret.  With the interlocks removed, the turret can be
depressed just far enough to clip the starboard wing of the bridge.  He fires,
and a meter-wide chunk of the starboard bridge wall vaporizes, right next to
the (unmanned) communications console.  As he guessed, the hijackers were
standing unsecured, and are sucked out the breach.  Luckily, no-one was out
of uniform, as the crew uniform is a light-weight, high tech vaccsuit.  Thus
Gzoe became the only vargr in known space to deliberately fire on his own
ship.  For any action, there is a vargr crazy enought to attempt it.
Captain : "You idiot!  Now we can\'t question them!  And think of the repairs!"
Gzoe: "Captain, you appear to be injured; I have my medical kit right here.

[] From: "Robert S. Dean" <rsdean@crdec8.apgea.army.mil>
[] Subject: (2909)  New Traveller )-8
[] 
[] Are we going to be happy to be using a system where
[] an average character can take two average damage .50 caliber machine gun
[] bullets to the head without becoming unconscious?

Use a variant of 2300ad.  Yes, you can be killed by a .22 shot to the head.
Makes combat very lethal and not quite as desireable.
Actually, for characters I usually fudged kill results by simply making them
do 10x the DPV (or 5, whichever is higher) in damage.  This is usually enough
to knock out joe average, make the mesomorph sweat buckets, and kill any
weaker ones.  However, a 2MW phasmagun to the head will leave little more than
a vapor trail.

Paul Dale notes:
[] In message (2918?) Burton says:
[]>Another problem is missiles.  It takes a M-6 ship 1 turn to travel 6 hexes if
[]>starting from a standstill.  Missiles launched said ship when many hexes away
[]>hit THAT SAME TURN.  Ppbbtt!
[]
[] I\'ve got the same gripe with missiles.  Mayday had an almost reasonable system
[] for missiles (you had counters and they moved and could accelerate in a rather
[] limited fashion).  The problems with having missiles as ships is that you can
[] arrange to defend against them multiple times (by not getting hit until a
[] later turn), which may seriously impair the effectiveness of missiles.  I
[] think that was the agreement Bertil and I arrived at when we discussed this
[] topic.

Well, I have to admit to a heavy Japanese Animation influence on how missiles
will operate.  I see them jigging and weaving all over the place, making them damned
tough to hit.

[]>With a 30 second turn (3 personal combat turns), the hexes are 4.5km across
[]>(so we\'ll fudge it to 5km).
[]
[] 5km is getting awfully small, how many ships can you stack into a hex?
[] A 1Mton battleship is a measly 150m diameter sphere so you could get lots
[] of them in, however a cyclinder of the same volume with a base area of
[] 10000m^2 (=1 hectare) is 1.35 km long (and the cross-section need not be
[] anything like that big).  A cone/wedge configuration will be even worse.
[] If I was in one of those \'big\' ships, I wouldn\'t desire another one inside
[] the same hex as I was in.  [ I do know that ships of those sizes are not

Well, ships that big are on the line of Star Wars "Star Destroyers".  Just
huge wedges.  Presumably big ships like that don\'t close to "knife fighting"
range but have it out at some distance with spinal mounts, saving "lesser" weapons
for smaller cruisers and fighters.  I admit, I like a more "Star Wars" feel to
my space combat.

[] really combat capable but they do serve as an example ].  Having 5km hexes is
[] also going to cause some havoc with ranges....how far can you see in space?
[] (a very large number of hexes).  Active sensors are going to have some really
[] impressive ranges (0.1 light seconds is almost 30000km, 6000 hexes for a round
[] trip).  This would tend to make having sensors pretty much a non-issue,
[] especially for the long range EMS ones.

I think the whole mess of sensor lockon in MT just slows things down.  Save
a few headaches and assume ships with reasonable sensors can spot other ships,
UNLESS the target has some sort of ECM (EMM masking, Black Globe) top make it
tough.  

Sensors are probably best used in the pre-combat and post-combat phases
(as stated in book 2, for detecting objects prior to combat).

What I meant in using SFB ideas is actualy to create some sort of ship layout
with check boxes for damage.  Now, for larger ships this could get cumbersome
(although not as much with my new damage calculation), but it would allow you
to see your damage, weapons available and other information at a glance. 
Those who don\'t want to go into that much detail can simply list it and use
and abstract system (batteries/batteries bearing).

Now some new stuff.  Who\'s the bonehead who figured that "mass equals power
consumption"?  I don\'t care if your radio is the size of a chicklet or
as big as a house, you need X power to get a clear signal to Function(X) miles,
no matter how much mass you shuck off.  Obviously, Radios, Radio Jammers
and Radar are the big criminals in this.

The rules state "Turrets and Cupolas may be added to the hull, with no more
than a 40% increase in hull volume".  As such I have decided to give the old
"1 hardpoint/100t" rule the heave-ho.  What (you may say in horror) is this man
doing!  Well, If you can design a laser with striker rules that can perform
JUST like a ship laser, and place a good number of them in a large vehicle,
it seems silly that a starship the same size can only have 3.  Period.

Now, while powermongers may rub their hand in glee at the prospect of having
tones of weapons on their ships, have them keep in mind that Pirates and
Naval ships will be equally well armed.  (This may give them a stroke -- a
400t corsair mounting 160 missile launchers would be a nightmare.  God forbid
you meet a ship of the line with an attitude!)

Anyone out there seen "Gal Force", an animated movie from Japan?  In this
movie, lasers are handeled like this:


                        //
                       //----    To target ->
      Vane ---->   //-+----
                     //-++----
                    //-+++----
                   // ||||
################################################
######################## HULL ####################################################

The lasers are fixed in the hull, while movable vanes are used to reflect the
beams toward the target.  For atmospheric reentry, the vanes are simply folded
down. "turret" hits simply blow the vane away.  This has the advantage of
having all 30 beam lasers on one vane (thus explaining how a turret hit
knocks out the use of 30 lasers.  Ships could be limited to the number or size
of vanes by their surface area (as stated for Solar Cells, square root of
interior volume).  So your average Type-S could have 1 vane of 36 lasers,
2 vanes of 18, etc.  Having the vanes up increases your reflected signature,
making you easier to detect (so most ships trying to be stealthy will remain
locked down until nearly at the target).  Also, locked down lasers are protected
by hull armor.  Thus ships might trade missile blows until they reach favorable
laser range, at which time they lock up and open fire.

Why do missiles need to be turreted?  They have their own guidance.  So 
missile batteries take up 1-ton cupola\'s each.
- ----
I don\'t have COACC, but I do have striker.  I figured out the data required for
rockets from striker and converted it to a usable form for starships.  Yes,
you too can build the challenger.  If anyone wants this data, just ask.
- ----
Handling large numbers:

I plan to handle lasers BASED SLIGHTLY on the HG ratings.  Lasers (on a vane)
are arranged in an array.  These arrays are somewhat dictated by the battery
ratings given.  Let me elucidate...

As stated: 1 Beam laser (factor 1), 2 Beam Lasers (factor 2), 3 Beam Lasers
(factor 3), 6 beam lasers (factor 4), etc.  Ignore TL modifiers for factor
(improved lasers have better penetration, not better to-hit numbers).

Since the base number is 1, having 2 lasers is a +1 to hit, 3 a +2, and 6 a +3.

Having multiple banks multiplies the single bank rating.  Thus 2 banks are x2,
3 banks are x3, and 6 banks are x4.  When figuring the bonus, the larger number
is used for the add and the smaller is used for the multiplier.

Say a ship has a 3x6 laser array.  The 6 provides a +3 modifier, while the 3
multiplies it by 3, giving +9 to hit with this array.

In combat, for every +2 over the required number an extra laser hit takes place,
up to the limit of the array.  Thus, a really hot gunner could square the array
and get nearly all to hit, while an unskilled one is depending on the shear
volume of laser beams to get at least a few hits.

Particle beams, energy weapons, missiles, etc use the same system, except that
missiles, being independantly guided, get an extra impact for every +1 over
the required number.  The inital gunner skill indicates a better lock-on.

Sandcasters calculate a defense DM that is used against laser targeting and
missile lock on.

Again, comments are welcome.

	And the skies opened above me, and a booming voice above said...

		Yeah, let\'s cut the crap and get it together, shall we?

		I have been gaming since \'85 in systems such as Top Secret,
	AD&D, Gamma World, 2300 AD, and recently GURPS, and about 2 years
	ago, I managed to lay my eyes on what I thought was gonna be the be
	all/end all of science fiction role playing games. I\'d heard of 
	Traveller, and it was recommended as THE system to get. MegaTraveller?
	I thought that it was gonna be clear, concise and easy to learn.

						HAH!

		I have spent 2 years trying to decipher the rules books and try to
	get the game mechanics finely tuned, most of my attempts ending in failure.
	Until I subscribed to this mail list, I was totally lost. Now, I am only
	partly lost. Substantially large improvement, don\'t you think?
		And then I read Metlay\'s comment. Right-o!! Agreed. The packaging 
	stinks... (Not meaning to offend any GDWers, but it\'s true.) And as for
	continuity, well, at least we could make sure all the background info
	is actually part of the rules books. I tried building ships and vehicles
	by the given rules. What a mess. None of them worked worth a damn. Then
	I got the TYPO list. I spent two days correcting parts of my books. 
		Anyway, the long and the short of it is... No wonder MegaTraveller
	ended up as such a big flop! It scares the hell out of all novice GM\'s it
	comes in contact with! You open the cover, and nothing fits! And forget 
	about running the complex politics of the Rebellion when personal combat
	still makes you cringe! 
		But, I\'m losing my cool. Sorry. Only purpose of this was to say, 
	"way to go, Metlay!" In the meantime, I have a lot of work on the system

It\'s been a long time since we\'ve had an interesting astrophysics
question here.

The gas giant in question masses ~196000 earth masses or 0.058 solar
masses.  The smallest known main sequence star masses around 0.07 
solar masses.  This means that your "gas giant" is right on the
verge of being either a minimal type M main sequence star or a 
maximal brown dwarf, which I can\'t say.  I couldn\'t find the reference
in Chandrasekhar to the minimal mass to begin fusion and it doesn\'t
say in bohm-Vitense, Abell, Schwarzschild or Zeilik.  Either way,
you have a very borderline case which, if I were able to study, would
mean an excellent thesis at the very least :-)  If it is massive enough
to begin fusion, I\'m not certain it would be stable.  It might be
a new type of variable, a pulsating fuser or something like that.
Note that even without fusion it will put out a lot of heat it stored
virially (is that a word?) during it\'s condensation.  I wouldn\'t 
expect a planet to be habitable near it.  Also, since it is so massive,
I wouldn\'t count on planets whose orbit falls between the proto-star
and the primary to be stable on time scales of millions of years.

My advice?  Drop its mass by a factor of 10 when nobody is looking.

There are (this is second hand) labs in the US working on developing it
for use in the detection of smuggling operations.  WOW!

Also, in a recent Science Times (Again I didn\'t see it

looking for cherenkov radiation are essentually looking down through the

Densiometers and Neutrino sensors... In MY lifetime?

Aiigh! :-) "igniting the hydrogen" was bad enough :-) :-).  But
I *absolutely refuse* to make burning hydrogen impenetrable to
neutrinos.  In *anyone\'s* universe.  Period. :-)

Seriously, neutrinos will penetrate even several feet of
superdense hull with unmeasurable attenuation
 -- who knows how the TL99 magic black box
neutrino detectors work, but here on Earth at TL8 (or so) we
use bazillions of gallons of water and hope that one or two
neutrinos per gazillion will be absorbed in it.  Your burning
hydrogen would affect a neutrino trail not at all.

I think the burning hydrogen just obscured essential sensor
information in the visible and infrared :-).

I think it will be a good idea to ask Guy Garnett (Wildstar) how someone
is able to pay the bill for his ships. He has designed two ships:

> CraftID:	PA-Gun Frigate, Type=FFP, TL=15, MCr=117,667.621.
> CraftID:	MesonGun Frigate, Type=FF, TL=15, MCr=100,222.252

Both ships have a really impressing, but I think that\'s too much money for
a simple frigate. What the hell a Battleship shall cost ? I must admit,
I had designed my first ships in a similar manner, but I have decided to
stop the use of this designes, because of the reasons mentioned below.

Can someone tell me, what\'s the gross national product of a system like
Glisten is ? I have estimated an average of 10,000,000 MCr. Do you
really think, a system is able to use 1% of its income for one ship, and
those ship will even be a frigate, not a Battleship...

I personally (as GM !) have decided not to use any armour in ships
greater than 2000 tons displacement. Armour is simply to expensive.
As a navy admiral I would decide to build two ships instead of one
with an armour. The price would be the same. Armour is only efficient if
you have a small ship, because it decreases the number of additional
critical hits.

Any comments ?

I hope to see the next generation of RPGs go beyond what has already
been marketed.  I think, from our discussions, we can see that game
publishers have some ideas.  We can also see that their ideas are
necessarily limited (to us) by the environment from which they arise
- - the printing industry.  With that in mind, here are some ideas I\'d
like to toss out in the hopes they\'ll get tos someone who actually
might want to use some or all of the concepts.

The other day I waxed eloquent about using computers and integrating
them with RPGs and really said very little.  I apologize for wasting
your time.  Now I hope to try this again with a little more thought
and some concrete proposals.

Today we get idea number 1.  Further ideas will be in later posts, 
so we don\'t get overwhelmed with text.

#######Idea 1: The Composite Game (aka the CAT proposal)#############
           This is immediately implementable (1992)

I call this the CAT proposal, because it\'s simply a formalization
of what the CAT sub-list members are doing individually, and in a
somewhat more limited fashion.  

Imagine an RPG that is still a table-top RPG, with GM, and printed 
rules.  Only there is one *big* difference.  All of the nitty-gritty, 
penicl-pushing, details are handled by silicon, rather than dice and 
gray cells.   That is, the game comes with a program (and/or special-
ized computer) that handles character generation, combat, travel 
times, world generation, trade and commerce, etc.  

The GM still has control over what actually gets said and done, and 
can therefore modify the output of the game, and input new parameters,
characters, data of any sort.  The computer can keep track where the
party is, what their possesions are, and so forth, leaving the players
to concentrate on *playing*, and the GM to concentrate on keeping the
plot and game flow together.

Addidtionally, with computations done by Si, you could do the evil
things of making space three or four dimensional, making events
transpire in two different milieus simultaneously, making fuel burn
a function of speed and distance, making healing time more playable.
####################################################################

So let\'s talk about this.  I suspect it\'s a natural creative avenue
for TML\'ers, especially the ones interested in TDR.  No-one says 
whatever new sci-fi game it turns into has to be MT-compatible.
Although it certainly could be...

Anyone wanna implement or suggest this (or some variant) to some 
gaming house?

Well, turrets are armored, but probably not as much as the main hull.
Perhaps a surface hit welds the turret in one place, or (as I stated for lasers)
blows away the reflective surface of a vane.

If firing arcs are to be used, I presume some means of abstracting it can be done,
as you mentioned above.

- ----
I want to make a retraction.  In my last message I mentioned how a ship could have
more than 1 hardpoint per 100t?  Well, thinking it over and chewing around some
numbers, the number of hardpoints should be based on surface area instead.
Base SA equals (displacement/100)^0.666666 times some constant.  Open frame ships
have DOUBLE the figured number, irregular ones have 50% more.

How many hardpoints should a 100t ship get?  Maybe not 40 like I mentioned before,
but certainly more than 1.  Perhaps they can get 4, with each movable hardpoint
requiring DOUBLE the space (thus, on a 100t ship you could have one turret and
2 fixed missile harpoints, or go for the gusto with 4 missile hardpoints).

This will SIGNIFICANTLY alter the armaments of large ships (since 2x size is
not equal to 2x weapons).  Spinal mounts have their hardpoint limits checked, but
only use 1 hardpoint (firing port).

(btw, is there any reason WHY only one spinal mount is allowed?  If the ship is
large enough, could it not have 2 parrallel, or 3 triaxial mounts?
Perhaps with the limitation that they all be of the same type and size.)

Would it be large enough to ignite deuterium fusion?  I would think
that would require less mass, and keep it going for a little while at least.

	I\'ve seen this come up a few times. Once during the conference
with FASA, once during the conference with DGP. They have thought about
this as well. The problem with the idea is market. How much more are you
willing to pay for this software? In addtion, which computer should
this software be intended for? IBM? Mac? Apple? NeXT? How many RPGer are
willing to pay for this? Based on the various game companies, not enough
to justify the effort. And for a specialized computer, that would
push the R&D cost even higher, and market lower. From what I\'m told.

So long as the computer doesn\'t begin to dominate the game, this is a great
way to handle lots & lots of added realism (gee, you\'re about 13.7m from freddie
and you\'ve got [big gun #24].  Splat goes freddie\'s left hand).  Computers
can handle lots of added detail and complexity without everything becoming
a table feast (has anybody heard of rolemaster?  tables, tables and more
tables).  Things like handling passage of time, is something that I am very
lax about (who isn\'t, how many people account for characters aging during play?)

My personal preference would be tending towards a small portable computer that
included all this kind of stuff.  Having to lug a (huge) PC around just so
you can play the game is kind of stupid.  Then there is the problem of what
happens when the thing breaks down (sorry guys, the session has to be cancelled
since the bloody database is broken :-)

The GM must be able to \'fudge\' things at a moments notice (without the players
being able to see him do so???).  As GM I often fudge all kinds of die rolls
(doesn\'t everybody?), sometimes it even helps the players ;-}

Yeah, and having stars go nova in real time!  More seriously, things like
having starships that actually travel between systems so you meet old \'friends\'
intermittantly ---- the current tables don\'t really account for this kind of
thing.  I\'m sure people can come up with lots and lots of different
bookkeeping style things that machines would be really good at handling.
[ As an aside: can anybody give me an English word the included
   the pairs of double letter in a row?  No it isn\'t really related to this
   topic ]

What warts and all?  The system that is used underneath isn\'t really all that
important (well, there are some things that are :-)  Stuff like combat, trading
and so on are really quite mechanics independent.  Does it really matter if you
are using MT combat, CyberPunk combat or Morrow Project combat?  The basic
idea that being shot is usually fatal will come through.  Sure, something like
GammaWorld or D&D has a combat system that is really quite different (like
you cannot die very easily).  You wouldn\'t want to use that as your basis.

So long as trading is reasonably balanced and seems reasonable, it doesn\'t
matter too much what mechanics are used.  In fact there would be some very
stong reasons not to use a canned system (like lots of really nasty people
who are generally know as lawyers).

I\'m quite sure that even the MT computer games take quite a few liberties
with the rules.  Nobody is really going to find out unless they reverse
engineer the program (which is a pretty stupid thing to be doing).  The
MT related programs that I have written have usually either taken some
easy ways out or suffered lots of nasty problems trying to stay totally
compatable.  [e.g. the ship design program doesn\'t support planetoid hulls
at all, and it would have been nice to make some simplifying assumptions
in the bridge/control sections.]


>Anyone wanna implement or suggest this (or some variant) to some 
>gaming house?

I\'d love to implement this, my supervisor wouldn\'t like me taking another
couple of years out of thesis for me to do so.  I\'ve done some work on
some areas, I\'m intending to continue working on these and others in the
future.  [My current project is a rewrite of a common mud\'s (lp) database to
be more flexible, and I\'m borrowing several ideas from MT to help ---- tasks
really are wonderful things that promote consistency.  Skills are pretty nice
and MT has this wonderful skill list that I\'ve got on-line somewhere.  The
actualy mud isn\'t going to be totally SciFi, but some bits of it may end up
that way.]  If I got really keen I could write some of the stuff for my pocket
calculator and let it do the work for me.

Would a gaming house show much interest in a combined RPG/computer game?
I suspect not, they would be able to produce the RPG and then flog the
computer assistance off to the public as a game-aid.  Unless the computer
was supplied with the game I cannot see it being very workable (what
computer to support?).  If the game included enough bookkeeping to warrant
computer assistance as standard, it would be very close to unplayable without
the machine aid.  Personally, I like to know what the system is using to
resolve things (lets you play the odds better :-)  A computer introduces
a \'black box\' into the works that removes this knowledge.

Isn\'t that what the batteries bearing is all about?  That is what I thought

all batteries bear at least), I don\'t remember the MT figures off the top
of my head but I am pretty sure that the table was almost the same.

This seems like a plausable idea.  The TDR ship people might like to chatter
about this and then place something solid into the new design system.  I\'ll
try to keep my design program up to date (as far as is possible).

Stuff the missile hardpoints, lasers are much more fun: you don\'t have to
worry about running out of things to throw around.  They do consume \'slightly\'
more power :-)

Are you suggesting that if the mount requires 50 hard points it can only be
placed into a ship with 50+ hardpoint and once built in it only uses one
hardpoint?  Seems a little silly to specify the minimum sized ship that
can contain the mount especially when the mount already uses a volume.
I also feel that it would be quite difficult to put a decent spinal mount
into a ship that didn\'t make the necessary hardpoint count ---- they have this
annoying property of using a LOT of power and space.

I\'ve often though about this exact point.  A Meson-T can easily be put into
a ship 50000 Ton  (I think my meson destroyer was 20kTon, but I\'m not sure
since I don\'t have the file around anymore).  A 500000 Ton ship has 10 times the
space to waste, it ought to be able to fit two or three mounts.  Another thought
I\'ve had is to mount several different spinals in a disk/spherical hull at
right angles.  A PA shouldn\'t be able to effect a MG thus you ought to be
able to put both onto the one ship.  Aiming does become a problem that
would have to be sorted out.

Not just large ships.  The probability of collision would depend on the size
of the ships, the size of the hex, and whether or not one of them was trying
to ram.  In no case would the probability of collision be zero, though.  (But
dealing with it via the task system might be a neat trick.)

Again, why not?  Since the ultimate objective is to make rules which
work for space vehicles as well as for air/ground vehicles, note that
tank turrets are often as well armoured as the hulls.

Does such damage occur with tanks?  As for the reflective vanes, what happens
if I cover my ship with the same material as the vanes?  (In personal combat,
this is what reflec armour does.)

This is something that I\'ve wondered, too.  (And on this mailing list on a
few occasions.  :-)  What about catamaran designs?  Take two 30,000 ton
cruisers and join them together with a big lump of metal.  You now have one
70,000 ton cruiser with two meson guns.  (I said it was a big lump, 10,000
tons!  :-)

I hope that Burton will forgive me for seriously editing portions of his 
message from last night.  I\'d like to address his question about turrets 
without going into any of his other concerns about combat at the moment.  
(As you are all painfully aware, I tend to be of the \'hard physics\' school 
of space combat, so any anime innovations are unlikely to meet with my 
approval.  Forget about that for right now.)

Overall, I would agree that the whole concept of turret limitations needs 
to be re-examined.  My personal preference would be to eliminate the limi-
tation entirely.  For energy weapons I don\'t think that this would cause a 
problem, because of the cost, space, and fuel requirements of the addition-
al power plant that would be required to create an energy weapon specialty 
vessel that carries substantially more weapons than possible under the 
current design rules.  In the same vein, I would see no reason why ships 
could not be built with multiple spinal mounts, although I think that a 
rule that multiple mounts must attack the same target would limit their 
utility somewhat.

The main \'problem\' with removing turret restrictions is the effect that it 
would have on missile and (to a lesser extent) sand turrets.  Before this 
can be discussed, we really need to decide how missiles work.  If missiles 
require guidance from the launching ship for a significant fraction of 
their flight, then the \'game balance\' limitations on missiles should be 
based on the number of control channels/transmitters that the launching/ 
guiding ship has available.  This would make them somewhat like missiles in 
Star Cruiser/2300AD.  If you wanted a missile launching specialty vessel, 
you invest in extra computers, comm links, and so forth.  On the other 
hand, if missiles are \'self guided\', along the lines of the missile designs 
that have been posted here using the Robots book, there is really no basis 
for limiting the number of missiles that a single ship can launch in a 
turn, EXCEPT for the cost of the missiles.  My players, in their space 
combat session two weeks ago, burned through MCr1.5 worth of missiles, 
which is prohibitive for many player groups (I hope.)  In a Trillion Credit 
Squadron setting, forcing players to purchase and transport the missiles 
(and sand--we should insert the sand canister prices form Old Traveller in 
MT) would cut down on their use a bit.  

What do you think?

I believe that Richard had later decided that the hydrogen was
"ignited" by fusing it (presumably with a nuclear missile or
something).

I agree that burning hydrogen would not be impenetrable to
neutrinos, but FUSING hydrogen generates neutrinos.  That WOULD
interfere with a neutrino scan.  After all, aren\'t they using
the neutrino detectors to detect other ships\' power plants in
operation?

Just to throw my hat into the ring...  I once was in a Trillion Credit
Squadron match that never did really get off the ground.

We had an exploratory engagement with a few ships to get the feel for how
combat worked.  Now when the engagement started, we were at extreme gunnery
range, which is not extreme range for the sensors.

If I recall we disreguarded some of the MegaTrav sensor rules which didn\'t
make a lot of sence.  (If a sensor has interstellar range, why can\'t it
pick out a target at less than one AU?)  Thus we just assumed that both
sides detected each other.

This was mapped out on hex paper.  Using vectored movement.  Now, we assumed
that missiles accelerate at 8 Gs.  This allows them to out run even a 6 g ship/.They were moved as though they were ships, and damage was inflicted on the
turn they intercepted the targe.

But.  Due to some badly remembered rules, the cruiser\'s meson guns were limited
to planetary range.  The upshot of which was that both cruisers headed toward
each other at full speed, while firing off missiles and lasers.  (the only
weapons which had the range.)  Both ships had 3 G engines and so were headed
toward each other at a closing rate of 6 Gs from extreme range.  (I don\'t have
my books so don\'t ask what that is)

By the time the ships had gotten in range, They were both HEAVILY damaged.
When they passed each other they got in one blast of meson fire.  One ship
was crippled, the other missed.  The one that was missed by the meson fire
was so badly damaged by the accumulated damage that it was out of the
game anyway.

The upshot of the whole battle is that I realized that almost all space combat
is going to be had at LONG Range.  Thus Fusion and plasma guns are extremely
limited.  At LOOOONG range, it takes a long time for you to move in.
By the time you got to within say 500km you are DEAD.  Even with 20 min turns.
If you had 30 second turns, you would never get withing planetary range.
You would be dead within the first few minutes.

Also, it is an insane idea to have more than one battlewagon within a few Km
of another.  One nuclear missile will damage both.

Another reason for the 20 min turn is damage control.  The rules say that
the engineers can attempt to repair systems during combat.  Well, 20 min
seems fair for that.  If you go down to 30 second turns then you\'d barely
have enough time to bring the secondary systems on line, nevermind repair
a fusion plant with a hole in it!

Also, with 30 sec turns you definitely would have to worry about battery
locations.  On the other hand, a twenty minute turn allows nearly all
the ships batteries to be brought to bear.


Now, on occasion, when ref, I have allowed shorter space combat turns.
This being when one ship had tricked the other into allowing it to get
within a hundred km.

And when a laser turret has an ROF of 60 (I think) combat kills take only a
few seconds.

It is true that burning hydrogen by combining it with oxygen would not
obscure neutrinos.  It is true that burning hydrogen by fusion would.
Burning hydrogen and making water, in space, *might* be possible *if*
oxygen is present in enough quantities but it is unlikely since both the
hydrogen and the oxygen would be rapidly expanding and very quickly drop
to a density too low to sustain the reactions.  Fusing hydrogen would be
impossible, insufficient denisty to sustain the needed temps and pressures
even for deuterium fusion.  If it were possible then everytime we did a
underwater nuclear explosion, we would have ignighted the oceans and 
destroyed the world!

Just my two cents worth.

Greetings, Travellers!



	I have several times tried book-keeping RPGs with a computer.
The only time the computer was worth using was when I used my little
Casio programmable calculator for various formulas. I think a normal
sized computer only gets in the way, while a small programmable
calculator can easily be handled along with the dice, paper and pen.
Using computers for other things than record-keeping and number
crunching destroys the GM\'s control of the game, I think.
	One way to use a computer in play is to let it simulate the
ship\'s computer. If you like complex in-system navigation, why not let
the navigator player and the computer sort the course out? The GM
won\'t have to control the course and the navigator player really feels
like the navigator character.
	Maybe other ship systems could be simulated as well. These
could be piloting, engineering and gunnery. Care has to taken though,
so that game success isn\'t only a function of player dexterity and
arcade game experience.
	The computer could also have a small library program. In the
library are general facts concerning space, science, society and
different worlds plus hints, red herrings and facts about the current
adventure. This would add a new dimension to investigative type
adventures. It would also require a lot of work, but several people
could maybe coordinate their efforts?
	(I\'ve heard that such files alreday exist. Could anyone
confirm?)

        As I see it, the increase in development cost of a simulator
on multiple systems is neglegible compared with the initial
development cost if the writers use almost any high level language,
although C is probably best for this (no flames please -- it\'s just
that almost anything will compile single-threading K&R).  What this
implies is that if you ignore GUIs and make a text-only application
it should look the same, feel the same and in fact be the same
program when ported to Unix, Mac OS, MS-DOS, Intuition, OS/2, the
Commodore 64 or whatever you please with a minimum of effort.
        If graphics get involved it is a different story because the
different capabilities and expectations of the underlying hardware
get mixed in.  However, I was thinking in terms of a program for
which graphics wouldn\'t matter; one that would handle bookkeeping
and not be SSI\'s on-line Monster Manual. 
         I simply don\'t see number of platforms as a drawback -- for
what you have in mind it wouln\'t be.

        Hm.  I think that it\'s possible to do this the way you
would prefer it.  First, it\'s possible to support multiple operating
systems for a program that is designed to be reuse as much code as
possible.  The programs that have problems with being ported are
those that are trying to do it all instantly -- programs written in
80x86 assembly and those for graphical interfaces.  (No wonder
they\'re having so much trouble with WordPerfect for Windows!)  To
reiterate, programs written in a high-level language and making few
or no assumptions about the underlying hardware would be the best.
After all, unless combat involves floating-point matrix manipulation
you shouldn\'t be able to tell the difference.
        Second is that certain combat systems are workable with two
people but simply unplayable with mass combat.  There is a thread on
newsgroup rec.games.design involving the benefits of simple combat
systems vs. the implausibility of them.  The more complex systems
(I\'ll call them duelling) seem to involve multiple related strikes
as a result of the \'real\' combat initiative (where people \'press
their attack\', etc.)  They may be fun to play but would really bog
down a standard game.  Enter a computer.  The computer can be
programmed to not only do the table lookups/calculations when told
to, but it could also be set up to make realistic decisions for NPCs
in such combat if the GM wishes to have it do so.
        I think that there are some small game companies out there
that would write something like that and sell it as a package.  With
RPGs currently the cost of simple computer games a game bundled with
bookkeeping software should be marketable in the high end.  If they
treat it as \'value added\' instead of \'gimmick\' it should do well in
the gamers\' market.  And if size is a problem, the die-hard
roleplayer could pick up the HP 55LX pocket PC...

	Let me introduce myself to you.  I\'m a Traveller fan in Tokyo, Japan.
My name is Genichi Nishio. Call me Gen.  The other day I heard about TML
on GEnie, and send mail to join. Now I\'m very happy to see such active
discussions about Traveller here.

	In Japan, Traveller and MegaTraveller are published from Hobby Japan
Inc., translated into Japanese.  Rebellion Sourcebook of Japanese Edition was
out yesterday.  They say Knightfall will be out next year.
	I must note Traveller was the first RPG translated into Japanese.
When Traveller was out seven years ago, though very few RPGer were then,
we were facinated with the game of new type.  Now a lot of RPG are in the
Japanese market, Traveller has many fans here.

Thanks!

THE COST OF WARSHIPS
 
]I think it will be a good idea to ask Guy Garnett (Wildstar) how someone
]is able to pay the bill for his ships. He has designed two ships:
]
]> CraftID:	PA-Gun Frigate, Type=FFP, TL=15, MCr=117,667.621.
]> CraftID:	MesonGun Frigate, Type=FF, TL=15, MCr=100,222.252
]
]Both ships have a really impressing, but I think that\'s too much money for
]a simple frigate. What the hell a Battleship shall cost ? I must admit,
]I had designed my first ships in a similar manner, but I have decided to
]stop the use of this designes, because of the reasons mentioned below.
 
Well, I designed those ships, so I\'ll respond to this one, too.  First
things first, I don\'t know what a battleship *SHOULD* cost, I haven\'t
dedesigned one yet.  For what Marc Miller thinks they should cost, I will
give a rundown from FSSI.
 
	BI-15 (Dreadnought)		  3,306,716 MCr
	BL-15	Battleship, Light	  1,246,820 MCr
	BM-15	Battleship, Missile	  9,335,821 MCr
	BH-15	Battleship, Heavy	 17,083,836 MCr
	BS-15	Battleship, Strike	  1,234,337 MCr
	CA-15	Cruiser, Armored	    124,009 MCr
	CM-15	Cruiser, Missile	    134,895 MCr
	CS-15	Cruiser, Strike 	    122,203 MCr
	CH-15	Cruiser, Heavy		    397,217 MCr
	CJ-15	Cruiser, Imperial (Rift)    119,900 MCr
	ED-15	Escort, Destroyer	      7,757 MCr
	EM-15	Escort, Missile 	      2,207 MCr
	EF-15	Escort, Fleet		      9,215 MCr
 
So there you have it.  A battleship costs over a trillion credits.  My 
frigate designs cost less than the cruisers.  Significantly less, if the
volume discounts are applied (the price I quoted was for the prototype,
and included architect\'s fees).  In a fight against a cruiser (just about
any of those cruisers) the frigate would probably win.  The frigate has
an advantage in DefDM (-14 vs -8 or -7 for the FSSI designs).  None of the
FSSI designs include a meson screen (looks like the meson frigate would
wipe up here), and the frigate has a 2G to 5G accelleration advantage,
which would allow the frigate to dictate the range of the combat, or break
off if necessisary.  Against a battleship, the frigates very weak secondary
armament might put it at a disadvantage (although its superior speed and
agility *MAY* offset that - which is exactly what the Domain is trying to
find out by building these things).  I\'d guess that the frigate has a
slim or better chance of besting any one of the battleships.  Two frigates
could probably take out a battleship with no trouble.
 
]Can someone tell me, what\'s the gross national product of a system like
]Glisten is ? I have estimated an average of 10,000,000 MCr. Do you
]really think, a system is able to use 1% of its income for one ship, and
]those ship will even be a frigate, not a Battleship...
 
Now, about the GPP (gross planetary product) of Glisten.  The only rules I 
know of are in Striker, so I\'ll haul that out now.  For a TL-15 world,
the base per-capita GNP is Cr 22,000.  In the Imperial Encyclopedia,
Glisten (Marches/2036) is an Industrial world (x1.4) with a population
of about 8 billion (Population code of 9, multiplier of 8), for a
GPP of about MCr 246,400,000. (or in round terms, a little under 250
trillion credits).  Striker further mentions that the average system
spends 3% of its GPP on defense (but this may vary at GM\'s option from
a low of 1% to a max of 15%), for a Glisten defense budget of MCr 7,392,000.
The frigates look pretty affordable to me (only about 2% budget).
 
If the old (pre-MegaTraveller) Spinward Marches data are used from 
Suppliment 3, Glisten (without the population multiplier, and before
it was coded Industrial) has a GPP of MCr 22,000,000 (still about twice your
estimate), giving a defense budget of MCr 660,000.  Still affordable, but
now probably the largest ships in the Glisten fleet.
 
High Guard, Adventure 5, has rules for determining the Navy budget for
a world, based on its population and government type.  The computation is
Cr 500 times a government modifier (for Glisten, government type 8, it is
x1.10 in peace, or x1.20 in wartime), times the population.  This gives
a Navy budget of MCr 4,400,000 (using the Imperial Encyclopedia) or
MCr 550,000 with Suppliment 3.

]Juergen
 
I armored the frigates because they are small enough to suffer critical
hits from the largest spinal weapons; the armor is there to help mitigate
the damage (for whatever shots get through the DefDM and screens).  The
armor also helps to protect against nuclear missiles; it is still possible
to scrape weapons off of the hull, but it should protect the crew and
vital components long enough for the frigate to finish off its adversary.
Without the armor, the ships would have been much cheaper, and have a
large amount of power available for secondary weaponry.  It is a trade-off.
I would be interested in testing your armor theory in combat.
 
OTHER SUBJECTS
 
One use I can see for M-T Variant is to publish "fixed-up" Traveller rules.
Personally, I like many of the basic tenents of Traveller, but think that
the current batch of rules is a mess, and the previous batch was too
disorganized into zillions of tiny booklets (lesee now, the basic set,
Mercenary, High Guard, Merchant Prince, Scouts, and Striker ...).
 
It\'s late, I had better go to bed ... up again too soon tomorrow.

What about submissions for M-T Variant?  I finished reading a bunch of
bundles yesterday, and saw some other good things, including the bit on
alternate anchients, and an article on fusion reactors.

(aiming lenses or whatever for minor corrections -- the target must still be
in the hexes forward).

This means was used because missiles were actually used like drones.  Most had
a laser that the missile could fire at the target.  Others exploded to power
a bank of lasers.  This was mostly due to the effects of stutterwarp, with ships
shifting positions in the blink of an eye.

[] Squadron setting, forcing players to purchase and transport the missiles 
[] (and sand--we should insert the sand canister prices form Old Traveller in 
[] MT) would cut down on their use a bit.  

Thi is as it should be.  If you want your ship to do a deathwind attack, launching
hundreds of missiles in a single volley, you better have a deep wallet to buy new
ones.

The sand prices should be in there anyways.


[] This was mapped out on hex paper.  Using vectored movement.  Now, we assumed

If I remember MAYDAY rules correctly, you could bought missiles with a G-rating
and an endurance.  12G was the maximum burn.  Thus a 12/3 missile could make up to
12 hexes of vector changes per turn for up to 3 turns.

[] Another reason for the 20 min turn is damage control.  The rules say that

[] a fusion plant with a hole in it!

Well, My intentions are to simulate the feel of most SF movies. 

[] And when a laser turret has an ROF of 60 (I think) combat kills take only a
[] few seconds.

So letting it fire for 20 times as long is a better thing?

===============================================================================

Well, let us say, for the moment, that the really poor limitations (no more than
1 spinal mount, 1 hardpoint/100t) are chucked in favor of reasonable limitations
(turrets and bays limited to increasing hull volume by 40%, or something).

We now face the prospect of multitudes of laser and missile attacks being
fired from each ship.  How should a barrage of 30 lasers be handled with 
regards to "to hit" and damage?  Should it be (2d6+attack DMS) crossreferenced
with (2d6+defenseDMS) to find a %hit?  If so, how will the table be constructed?
If ATTDM=0 and DEFDM=0, what is a 7-7 result?  50% hits?  10% hits?

===============================================================================

Sandcasters.  If ever there was a boneheaded idea, this is it.  I am probably
goind to implement sand like the shields of 2300ad.  An electromagnetic field
generated by the hull traps and circulates the ablative particles.  Sand Dispensers
pump a steady stream into the field to maintain the level of protection.  Maximum
shield strength is dependant on the power of the shield generators.

The cost and power requirements of a shield system is dependant on the hull 
surface area.

===============================================================================

Just more stuff to kick around.  I\'m still looking for the TDR vehicle rules
that were done way earlier in the year.

I\'ll add a quick comment here since I used to program Macs for a living.
Writing a text only application isn\'t really good enough for machines which
are based strongly around a GUI.  Users (the people who really count) get
used to the picture interface and get very upset when they lose this.  A
text only program is very unlikely to sell for a Mac (programmer\'s utilities
are an exception to this, but everybody knows programmers are different).
I suspect, that the other window based systems would require more than a
bare text interface to sell.  There is a massive amount of effort required
to add windowing and menus to a text based program in an effective manner,
it is nearly always better to re-write the program pretty much from
scratch and get things right.  There have been several companies that
produced a naive conversion of an existing program and got bitten (there
are some exceptions: infocom, three-sixty.  The product they produced
was of top quality anyway).

[ Gee, my quick comments are getting longer and longer the closer my thesis
  deadline approaches. ]

You have also got to support all these different platforms.  My ship design
program is an example of a simple, reasonably well written program.  It compiled
without problems on several versions of Unix, and on the Mac.  It died on
the Amiga (did you ever get it working richard?, are you even reading this ;-)

It is a HP95 isn\'t it?  (assuming that you mean the IBM compatable handheld).
My personaly preference is for the HP48SX, but then I own one :-)

Is the sales quantity going to offset to software development costs?
Writing RPG-aid software is a nasty buisness (ask just about anybody who
has tried to computerise an existing part of any system), and you are
likely to require a non-trivial hardware platform to do anything useful
(which would bring it out of the gimmick classification).  All this is
going to increase the cost of the package.  I am not saying that it isn\'t
possible, just that I cannot see anything like this working in the near
future (unless one of us starts writing lots of code quickly ;-)  I would
be unhesitant to claim that it would be a VERY high risk venture.

Of course, you could include the die rolling computer to save having to
roll 2000d6 during large scale combat.  That rates as a useless gimmick
in my book.

Any chance of a TDR or CAT sub-group on portable computerised game assistant
packages?

	Well, if the program is a text-only thing even when it\'s
ported to things like Mac. I for one, wouldn\'t buy it. GUI is what
attracts a lot of people to Mac. And if they are gamer and use Mac
as well, it\'s doubtful they would buy a text-only program.

	I have already done something like this. I used a database
program to simulate the Data Library in traveller. It\'s pretty
easy, it just involes some looking up. And Everytime the player 
wants to look up something. They use the computer to do so. The
computer is also tied into another one right by me. So I can change
the data at will. I\'ve used the same program to simulate cyberspace
in cyberpunk games, that one I had less success with.

Not much use in my eyes (and I am an opinionated bigot aren\'t I :-).
Presumably, the spinals are all firing at the same target (how often will
ships get into a nice line so you can fire at all of them at once?)
the hardest bit about killing with a smallish spinal mount is the to-hit
roll (or have I made another major error).  Generally, penetration of
meson screens isn\'t too hard (besides, who uses the power gobblers anyway)
and configuration doesn\'t do all that much either.  So all these wonderful
spinals are going to share the to-hit roll ---- I suppose you could treat them
as a more powerful spinal for penetration purposes.  Much, much more powerful.

And storage space for all of the bloody things.  They consume quite a bit of
cargo space that could be better used for \'small packages\'.

I agree that sand should be bought, but couldn\'t you use some local asteroids
and mash them up a bit???  I was under the impression that just about any
waste material is useful as \'sand\'.  Perhaps, we could come up with some
different kinds of sand.  Salvaged rocks, lots of shiny metal spheres, ice,
just about anything...and you\'d have lots of different protection
characteristics and prices :).

I thought it was 12G and fuel for 3 hexes movement of the destination counter.
It has been quite a while since I looked at mayday missile rules and both
methods have pros/cons and they are really describing the same thing.

It should be possible to figure out some method of agumenting attacks into
stronger attacks.  RebelGuard does this (or I think it does).  Basically,
the attack is made and the defences stop a percentage of the incoming thingies.
The stuff that gets through causes damage.
Another thing that would be nice would be being able to determine the
batteries during normal ship operations rather than during the design phase.
e.g. you get 100 triple lasers and can alloacte them however you want.  This
might cause some problems with fire control/gunnery crew but that\'s life.

Well comparing ships with Fighting ships is not really a comparison.
Most ships there are a) Impossible (by MT rules) or b) Useless and 
always c) too expensive. 

I while back I discussed the issue of cost effectiveness of line of
battle ship designs. The basic philosophy being that the bigger u
make your ship the worse it is. A spinal-T meson can easily fit in a
ship of 20kton (if u do it right). Anything over a 100,000t has to be
a tender not a warship. People have put designs here of ships less
10,000 t displacement with Meson-J with Def DM =+15 these things are
very hard to hit and can destroy any larger ship. 

No one has yet come up with a good version of how much money a planet
geneerates but aside from that the basic idea behind ship construction
(for large ships) is to bring the largest number of spinal mesons to
bear for a given price. 

A larger very expensive heavily armored ship can be taken out by a 
single meson spinal hit. There larger size means that by definition 
they have a lower def DM and are basically asking to be hit.


Meson screens are not that difficult to penetrate and rarely have I seen
an irregular config ship. In general it is not the tonnage imbalance that
matters but the spinal meson  bearing. Generally if u can bring an advantage
of 4 to 1 spinals note: they don\'t have to be equivalent, in fact this assumes
something like 4- spinal-J/H vs 1-spinal-T; the side with the 4-Js will
one. On the face of it that seems trivial but note that spinal J only take
10 hardpoints. They can (theoretically) be put on a 1000t ship.

Spinal -T can fit on a 20kt hull(maybe smaller - but Def DM calculations
don\'t change). 



anyway..... ramblings.....

       I had thought of compatability of the interface as paramount.
With few exceptions, every gaming group meets in different places
and different times.  If you\'re going to sell something like this,
the referee must be able to jump into the saddle on any computer,
immediately. 
        Unless you\'re selling a pocket computer with the package
(probably increasing the cost by a factor of 4-10), it has to run
the same way on any system the referee is going to use.  A Mac user
has to be able to take a 1.44MB floppy, copy over the files into IBM
format and be set.  The data files have to be the same and the
interface has to be the same.  Because the lowest-common-denominator
machine these days is a ten-year-old IBM PC with a VT52 terminal on
top (i\'m exaggerating for effect) it must use a keyboard interface
and ASCII graphics only.
        This may jaundice the first impression a Mac/Amiga/NeXT user
gets of the package, but as I see it if a GUI is not always
avaliable its use should be _discouraged_.  I have never seen a
program that has the same effects in any two graphical operating
systems, even when the programmers have gone to great lengths to
make the two clones.  Now, sure, the user will be used to it in a
half hour, but you\'ve just wasted a half-hour, probably bogging down
the first combat that takes place and making everyone uneasy about
depending on your program.  Furthermore, someone who learns how to
use the program with a mouse will probably be lost without one,
while when the reverse happens the user is going to be confused.
        I think \'vi\' is a good example.  It\'s ten years old and has an
interface that at best is a trial to learn.  Yet I use it because
it\'s available everywhere -- on X terminals at the school, modemming
in from my dorm room, on my PC.  I\'ve even seen a version on the
Mac.  Now, it doesn\'t quite fit in in any of these graphical
environments, but it gets used because it doesn\'t have to be
relearned.  Anyone who knows \'vi\' can be editing files in fifteen
seconds.  That is the kind of program I think would be most useful.
        Something like this that is going to be not only used on
different platforms but used by the same people at unexpected times
on different platforms has got to be as definite as possible.  I\'m
afraid GUI\'s haven\'t gotten to the point where they are as
ubiquitous as text-based systems, and I\'m hesitant about
recommending an enterprising young programmer to invest four times
the programming effort in order to make a program that is easier to
learn but harder to unlearn.

I agree pretty much entirely with the above, big ships burn better than
small ones.  In a purely naval conflict I would avoid big ships and
build lots of small ships based on smaller spinal mounts (Meson-J is
a very nice choice).  If you know that the opposing fleet is based
around these small meson-J armed ships that don\'t have all that much in
the way of defences, you would be able to build a cheaper fleet based
around spinal PAs that could be expected to defeat the meson armed fleet.
My prefered choice for a large naval fleet would include lots of ships that
are not too big (say <10kTon), armed with both PAs and meson guns (and possibly
nuke missiles).  A good all round fleet would have a better chance in an
unknown conflict (by unknown, I mean the composition of the enemy fleet is
not known before the design of the friendly fleet is done) than a highly
specialised fleet.  [I am quite sure, that if I saw the designs and
quantities of ANY fleet, I could design a specialised fleet to destroy that
fleet!].

In a fleet where space combat isn\'t the only thing that has to be done (like
any fleet that is designed for real rather than TCS), larger ships do have a
place.  You need troop ships, carriers for fighters/aircraft.  You have to be
able to conduct planetary invasions (and destructions :-).  A real fleet is
going to be very multi-purpose and diverse.  The intro spiel for the game
harpoon says something like: You cannot win a war at sea, you can only lose it.
I suspect that this also holds for space conflict.

And any sized meson ship can be taken out by a cheaper/smaller PA based ship
(unless the meson ship is heavily armoured, then an unarmoured meson ship
will be cheaper and able to take it out).

Very recently, I said:

>I am quite sure, that if I saw the designs and

>fleet!

I am going to have to make a slight apology here, I realise that the design
of a fleet doesn\'t give you decent strategy/tactics and that an inferior
fleet could win a battle given some \'luck\' (or better command).

What I ment to write, was that I believe that I could design a special fleet
that would win given equally good commanders and no surprises.  Now all I hope
is that nobody tries to take me up on my claim ;-)

My method of design would be along the following lines: for each class of ship,
I would attempt to design a class that was: cheaper and capable of taking out
the enemy class at the rate of one for one.
My strategy in a battle would be along the lines of:  maintain a defensive
formation and whenever an enemy ship approached, send out its counterpart and
let them destroy each other.  I don\'t know if this is \'best\' (it probably isn\'t)
and it would not be very popular with the crews of the suicide ships.  I\'m
sure some kind of tailored attack plan could be devised (this area isn\'t my
strong point, I play strategic games relatively poorly).


Hopefully, I have removed some off the egg off of my face :-)

Do you mean a ligature?  This is a typsetting term for the single

or single sound made from a combination of consonants (dipthong).
For instance, people ofter write "tt" and cross them together.
In classic German, there is a letter that looks like a Greek "beta"

###### Now, on with our regularly scheduled topic #######

For you Johnnie-come-latelies, we\'re discussing the pros and
cons of a new RPG in which a computer plays and integral part
of the game system.

Mac Liaw says he believes the regular gaming houses have 
considered this and have dicarded it because of costs, computer
uncertainties, and lack of market. (Correct me if I blew it.)

I sort of feel like this is really just an excuse for not wanting
to truly investigate the idea.  The established game houses are
in the *printing* business, not the computer business.  The market
they see, and the products with which they are familiar are books.
I don\'t blame them, really.  The business is very competitive;
RPGs really compete with football and movies for market, rather 
than say, other RPGs or books.  There are a lot of printers, and
not much margin, and the houses that are making a profit now
understndably don\'t want to jeapordize their position atop a 
small, slipperly, heap.

They might be right, too.  I keep rembering that there are only
200 or so TML\'ers in the whole world.  If this is any indication
of the size of the market, a radical idea like this is doomed.


Paul Dale says that he thinks it\'s a good idea but that we also
need to pay attention to the down sides, things like maintaining
the data base, portability, transportability, ruggedness and
reliability, weight, etc.

:My personal preference would be tending towards a small portable computer that
:included all this kind of stuff.  Having to lug a (huge) PC around just so
:you can play the game is kind of stupid.  Then there is the problem of what
:happens when the thing breaks down (sorry guys, the session has to be cancelled
:since the bloody database is broken :-)

I concur.  In fact, it would be nice to make the computer *VERY* small 
and simple.  The gaming equivalent of (almost) the give-away 4-function
calculators.  One for each character?  The GM\'s of course, larger.
This way, players could care for their own characters, possessions, 
etc. and simply download at whatever campaign they get into.  The GM
computer could verify no changes since last game. :=)

This makes the game into two distinct products - one a general-purpose
gaming-aid computer/software "thing", and the other the players\' rules
and character "clipboards".  By being more general purpose, the more
expensive hardware and software could find other uses.


:>Although it certainly could be [MT or TDR compatible]...

OK OK - You\'re right; I shouldn\'t try  to buy off political favors

of computing throughout the empire, on a par with the infamous Space
Opera novel that used giant switchboards with 4-armed aliens to handle
fleet communications.

But how about instead having the breakthrough to AI made, and then the
AI\'s decide humans are a threat and in the resulting man vs. machine
struggle all computers get a really bad reputation, not unlike Dune\'s
excuse for the lack of computers in a high-tech setting.  Not having
computers also makes it much harder to keep an interstellar bureacracy
running smoothly, so things will fall apart into more manageable pieces.

It also probably signals the death-knell for the huge navies, a desireable
thing in my opinion.

And lastly, if computers are banned under penalty of death then smuggling
them becomes ever so much more profitable!

The project had two Achilles\' heels (Achilles had problems with just one!):
data entry and special actions.

The data-entry problem was the worst. Even after assigning default actions
to everything, the "who-hits-whom" and "who-uses-what-weapon" and "how far
away is each person from each other person" problems make melee combat a
complete nightmare.  The GM spends all his time pounding away at the keyboard.

The problem works down to the fact that RPGs are verbal, and computers can\'t
hear very well, so somebody has to transcribe all the relevant spoken facts
into the computer.  It turns the GM into a stenographer.  No, thanks.

The special action problem wasn\'t as intractable, but it was a pain in the
butt.  You have to allow the GM to override ANYTHING, and stick in any
arbitrary result.  Even if the program is very flexible at this sort of thing,
the GM has to be a rocket scientist to figure out how to get it to accept
the effect he wants, without lingering side effects.

Computer-aided melee combat is a rock many people have foundered on.  You
can be next!  Good luck...and send me a message in a bottle telling me how
it turns out.

Computer-aided space combat has more potential, especially when used for
"what-if" simulations rather than actual adjudication (you can get away
with more bugs and slop in a simulation than in play).  Computer-aided
character generation is an old favorite, one that works pretty well.

I\'ve been following the discussion on optimizing fleets and I\'d
like to add my 0.02 Cr.

First, invoking Game Theory, since a fleet battle is a two person
zero sum game, the Minimax Theorem *guarentees* there is *one* 
optimal strategy (in this case fleet design) which is expected
(barring) luck to win a greater percentage of the time than any
other strategy.  Work has been done at Stanford by the EURISKO
an heuristic evolving computer algorithm, on the TCS problem!  It
seems that a fleet of relatively small ships (I don\'t know the
sizes) with some Meson Gun spinal mounts and some PA\'s is a 
better fleet than an homogenous one.  Note, that I don\'t believe
that EURISKO has found *the* optimal fleet for any TCS parameters
as it is unable to consider radical design changes which require
creative use of obscure rules and prescedents in the Traveller 
rules.  I think I could beat EURISKO this way in TCS (if I get
some choice in the parameters to be used) but once an heuristic
program allows from some of my ideas, it will probably beat my
fleet pretty handily.  For those of you who are interested, the
only printed reference I have for EURISKO and TCS is pp. 72+
of _Engines_of_Creation_ by K. Eric Drexler.

It is true that there is more to a space based navy than TCS
ships, but it is my feeling that the main battle line would
be designed in this way.  Also, once a major interstellar war
started, production would shift to favor these designs (along
with Troop and *SUPPLY* ships!)

Side comment on programming GM aids for Traveller:
I don\'t like Graphics Interfaces at all, but a majority of 
*buyers* do.  Also, I don\'t agree that you have to make this
thing horribly portable.  I say make a universal data processing/
storage/retrieval system that you can *add* graphics interfaces
onto for different platforms.  I don\'t think that *many* gamers
have problems with wanting to run the thing on a Mac some nights,
a VAX others and an HP every other major holiday.  Make a 
universal driver and then interested parties can write an ASCII,
Mac, PC, NeXT or whatever driver for it as they see fit.

	Yes, it\'s largely text. All you really need is a programmable
database program. I created two databases, one for incoming news,
one for Data Library. Then created a menu for the players to access.
Because it\'s a database, I can perform searches using one or 
many keywords, or do something like "List Entries > 111-1120."
Works quite well, the players were happy to see a computer role playing
a future computer. :)

this thing, portablity was not on my mind. (grin)

	Well, this is my very first post to this list, but I\'ve been
reading for a long while...  I hope my contribution is worth
something.  :)

	It seems to me that a modified IRC server would do nicely as
a Traveller\'s Aid.  Program in certain commands to bring up task
libraries, and even resolve the tasks, etc, etc.  This would only be
effective for role-playing on IRC, tho.  But that, in itself would
have advantages...  First, people no longer have the "I said that,
not my character!" syndrome.  The idea would also allow people from
all over the world to play in a campaign, instead of just a few
friends that have never played traveller before.  There are
dosadvantages as well, obviously.  For one, you wouldn\'t be able to
just get together with a few friends and play.  It would also be
kinda slow for the players to type in everything they say.  The
referee could speed a few things up by preparing text descriptions
of rooms, objects and the like, which he could then call up at will.

	While this has many disadvantages, another one being that
you couldn\'t play it on pc\'s that aren\'t hooked to the internet
somehow, the system would be virtually free, and there would be no
compatibility problems.

     Now, this strikes a chord in my memory.  Unfortunately, my memory
is somewhat less than perfectly reliable.  You Have Been Warned.  ;-)

     The whole thing happened a few years ago (I\'m not quite sure how
long, but it wasn\'t recent), when there were TCS tournaments at some
large gaming con (GenCon?  Origins?  Something like that).  Anyway, some
people put some *serious* computing resources into devising optimal
fleets (as well as combat strategy, if I remember correctly--*that* must
have been fun to program).

     If the fleet in question is what I\'m thinking it was, its
composition isn\'t immediately obvious (at least to me).  The fleet
consisted of lots of medium sized (say, 50 kton) *planetoid* ships
(don\'t know if they were buffered or not--hardly matters, I suppose)
armed with Meson spinal mounts (at least *that* part I had already
figured out).  I don\'t remember what secondary armament (if any) the
fleet had, but that\'s probably more flexible.

     I remember trying that fleet composition out (I used to play quite
a bit of BCS and TCS with some ROTC friends) and finding that it worked
fairly well.

     In any case, the story ends with the end of TCS tournaments, since
the optimizers kept winning (rules changes didn\'t help, since they just
ran a new simulation).

     Bear in mind that, while the fleet composition (and, perhaps, the
combat strategy) were mostly determined through computer simulation,
there was an actual live human who fought the fleets in the tournaments.
Things would probably come down to the old saying attributed to Manfred
Von Richtofen (paraphrased):  "It isn\'t the quality of the crate, it\'s
the pilot flying it."

Our AD&D group from the early 80\'s used a TRS-80 to do this.  It provided the
basic DICE rolling, expericence caluclations, tracking the health of the
monsters, including regineration.  Later versions even handled combat rolls of
the monsters attacking the party.  Combat was rather simple though.  The
interface was easy to use.  For instance to attack critters 9-30, 49, 51 for 25
points of damage was a simple:  A9-30,49,51<ret>25<ret>.

There was significant data entry up front to enter the critters, but once the
database was built, it was quick from there.  I have implemented similar
functionallity in PC versions without the database.  When I want a dozen trolls
I hit the add a monster button and enter 6d8+6 for the hitdice and the program
creates the monsters for me.  The amount of time has never been significant.

One the subject of Computer Aids, I would like to share a few things that I
have done with some success.  One of the first things I toyed with was the use
of a Lap Top player aid.  This program rolled the dice for you and had a key
press that would pop up a text editor with your character information or
whatever in it.  This worked well, but I don\'t own a laptop so I couldn\'t use
it outside of the limited testing.

I have been working on a Traveller specific game aid.  It is graphical VGA only
and written in TurboPascal (to kill portability in a hurry).  It takes sector
data (from the Archives and GEnie) and displays a Map of the area 4 parsecs
around your current location.  It draws the little hexes and bases just like
the GDW maps.  The three main differences are, color coding of the planets.  I
use a yellow/brown for a desert world, a red for a bad-air world, green for a
mostly land mass world and blue for a mostly water world.  There are no
trade/x-boat routs, and the map is not static, but your system stays in the
middle of the screen.

Once you choose a new world to go to, it calucates cargo and passangers and
displays library data about that system.  It can take the UWP and expand it as
well as load a text file per hex to display.  I would like for it to generate
encounters as well.  The cargo system needs fixed, but that is a GDW problem
and not my software.  One of these years, when I get a traveller group here in
Louisville, and I get the time to finish the development, I expect that this
will be a nice program.  It has the potential to aid the GM, act as a library
comptuer for the players or run as a stand-alone game.

The real drawback to CARPs (Did I just create a nifty new acronym?) is the
portability of the hardware.  I don\'t know of any one with a 10 seat computer
lab with a multi-user computer at home for this (When I win the lottery . . .)
so interactive games, like those that would use an IRC are out.  Secondly, we
tend to vary the location of where we play from week to week so lugging a big
AT case around isn\'t practical either.  It is hard to justify $2500 for a
laptop just to game with.  Once these problems are solved, then CARPs can
become useful tools.

Oh, I wouldn\'t mind if it got more abstract, which is not necessarily at odds
with more realistic.  What I\'d like to see in it is:

Easy to resolve
Player/Character input and actions have an effect
Produces a wide range of results (beyond Fuel-1, Wpn-1, Maneuver-1)

If this means that it only works well for ships below, oh, 1000 tons, I\'d
think that was not a real problem.  Players shouldn\'t be involved in fleet
actions anyway, and a High Guard type system will do for settling the results
of those, _offstage_.

I am new to the TML and to MegaTraveller, although I have been 
playing the original Traveller system since it was first published.

I have a question concerning the starship design rules.  Do special 
control panel add-ons benefit from the computer CP Multiplier?  
If so, then why do all the ship designs included with the system 
use so many control panel units?

For example, the Type S Scout/Courier has 181 control panel units; 
on a ship that can be run by ONE PERSON!  Since the ship also 
has a holographic heads-up display (Which, if it gets the  
multiplier, provides 3000 CPs.) why does it need so many control 
panel units?  The Referee\'s Manual is not clear on this, can 
someone clarify this for me?

One other thing.  The Encyclopedia lists the Type S as having an 
emission level of faint.  From what I see in the tables the emission 
level should be moderate.  The power plant is less than 1000Mw
(emission level of faint), the ship is less than 1000 tons 
displacement(+1 level to moderate), and no EMM is listed leaving 
a level of moderate.  Is this just a typo, or am I missing 
something?

If you were going to do anything with a computer to help traveller, the only 
thing I used it for, was a great deal of simple stuff.  For instance, the 
computer would tell me what cargos were available, taking some random NPC\'s as
the owners, this way I have them on the screen.  The computer using the 
cargo tables, just then randomly picked a NPC I had pre-generated and entered
as a file.  Also, the computer used to help in generating ships that might be
around as you enter a system.

You can surmise from all this I used the computer while I was playing with the
old rules, but I bet you can make this all happen with the new ones as well.
I also had the computer be the terminal in any spaceport, simply the players
would call up a bunch of selections and fumble around trying to find info.  I
could write up this type of interface in BASIC, since that\'s all I had, in a
hour and everyone had fun!

As a GM I believe that you have to have all the help you can get, but you should
not ask the computer to try and do it all.  That\'s the problem I found with 
trying to write computer aides for such games like AD&D, Top Secret, BattleTech
and others.  I found it much more simple to make the computer do things that
I really want done, and are suited to it\'s task:  randomization, and being a 
computer to play with!

If anyone is interested I could try and find the old stuff or if anyone wants
to we could write a program to do what I explained above for the new rules.
I could be fun and useful, and we could do it in almost any programming
language.

IRC is this program that lets multiple users talk to each other.
It provides a reasonably nice forum for discussion, and essential
things like private message are available.  It is interactive in the
sence, that if I type something everyone else sees it almost immediately
(allow a couple of seconds transmission delay).  This fast response could
become a nightmare for the poor ref (imagine a gaming sesson with 20+
people none of whom can see how pissed off you are getting about the
wasted noise being produced).

I\'d probably better add that I don\'t use IRC very often (like hardly ever).

I think that is what was ment.  It isn\'t really a BBS, but you could
create a traveller game group and have heaps of fun.  I seem to
remember hearing about an IRC RPG before but I cannot be sure.  There
would be some major problems trying to go global ---- people tend to not
keep the same hours of waking.  e.g. Here we are 15-17 hours ahead of the USA
and Europe is about 10 hours behind us.  Getting a global group of people
together at the same time would be a horrible experience.

Yes.  As to the second half of that question, I am forced to say that I don\'t
know, and I haven\'t got my books so I can\'t look it up.  It\'s generally agreed
here, though, that one add-on per relevant crew member should be the maximum
allowed (you can only stick your head in one HUD display at a time, so more are
wasted), which means that controls are installed by :

1.  Picking the computer, which allows you to calculate crew requirement
2.  Installing enough HUDs and so forth for the crew
3.  Filling in left over CP requirments with control panels.

As I understand it, a control panel is really no such thing--think of each 
dial and switch in an airliner\'s cockpit as being a \'control panel unit.\'

As to the Scout/Courier, a 32MCr ship (for example) at TL15 needs 4800cps,
so the single HoloHUD unit with the multiplier of 15 for a 1bis computer
only provides 5/8 of the requirement, leaving the rest to be filled by
those 181 control panel units (@181*1.5*15= 4000cp----but my cost was an off
the cuff estimate.)

You missed something.  (Sorry!)  Less than 1000MW is faint, but you must
be under 20 tons to suffer an increase in emission level due to size.  A
100ton ship with less than 1000MW is faint.

	Let me clarify what I was talking about.  First, IRC stands
for Internet-Relay-Chat (Or something like that).  It is basically an
international "talk."  It allows people to type messages to other
people, who are also in IRC, in real time.  It is not a EMail type
setup.  What you type, is what other people see.  On IRC, there are
"channels" that people can tune to...each with a different topic.
One could just make a channel called "Traveller" and go from there.
You can also make the channel private, so that only people you
invite can tune into that channel.
	Now, most people use a client program to connect to IRC.  If
one were to modify the client of the referee for certain database,
and other miscellaneous functions, it would greatly speed up the
game.  Also, you can setup a kind of server, that, when it heres a
few keywords, will "say" something in response.  I\'ve heard of dice
servers where a player can say "ROLL d4" and the server will
respond with, say, "d4 RESULT: 3."  It would be a simple matter to
modify these for a task system.  The complexity of the system would
only be limited to how much programming people wanted to do.
	This, obviously, has many disadvantages.  Only people with
access to IRC...which can usually be reached by "telnet"... can
play.  It is slow, not in terms of PBEM "slow", but in that one can
speak only as fast as one types.  Obviously, everyone has to be on
at the same time, which presents time zone problems.  On the whole,
tho, I think it would be fun for at least a few individuals out
there.

offensive systems as a battery for attack purposes.

first question: Is the entire squadron affected as a unit when in "defensive
mode?"  i.e. How _is_ damag distributed between the various components of the
squadron?

second question: What about larger individual units?  What would the attack
factors of a "squadron" of 10KT Meson-toting destroyers be?

a comment: A _very_ similar rule-system was implimented in _White Dwarf_
some years ago, to which system should deference be given?

An opinion: Depending on one\'s exploitation of the rules, squadrons of fighters
_seem_ like a relativeley cost-effective way of bringing a lot of weapons to 
bear.  Maybe I\'m mis-interpreting the rules, but 20*5 ton fighters with a 
missile "turret" each sure seems to beat the pants off of any 100 ton ship, in
this regard...  _Especially_ if they can be grouped into batteries/squadrons.

	After getting (some 8) comments about the concept, the Simplified
Starship Combat System is in pre-alpha edit and reality checking.  So far,
it\'s coming together quite well.
	I\'ve introduced a few new concepts to help manage things... the first
is that I\'m rating some things (mostly performance and damage absorbtion
capability) on an exponential rather than linear scale.  (The amount of
damage done was always sort of nonlinear, and this preserves the effects
of the old system while reducing numbers to _very_ manageable levels in
a consistent-across-scale system.).  Damage is still done linearly, though;
a battleship may have twice the \'damage points\' in some system as
a escort, but each of those points both means a lot more systems backing
it up _and_ is harder to damage (I subtract size from what amounts to
battery factor to determine number of damage rolls, so big ships are
harder to ding).
	I am including a scale table so nobody has to remember the log
factors or other similar evil mathematics. 8-)

	The other innovation is something that I proudly declare WILL 
replace most of the command-control-sensor-etc rules: Control points.
Basically, use the crew size on the same log scale to determine how
many \'things\' the ship is allowed to do in one turn.  It amounts to
about 15 things for a battleship, perhaps half that for escort sized
ships, etc.  I feel this a wonderful improvement, as it cuts out about
10-20 skill checks per combatant vessel per round in heavy combat 8)

	I know this is a teaser.  Real Soon Now (tomorrow night target
release) I\'ll be happy enough to release the first version for reality
checking and comparasons.  It looks to be mildly big (warning to those
who want warnings of incoming Large articles...) in the 2500+ words
range.

    'body' => 'George and Rob have been discussing how to make ship/ship combat
easier.

I\'m all in favor of it.  MegaTrav Combat just takes too damn long.
The whole pace of it is far too slow.  (maybe 20 minutes per turn
is realistic at the rate it gets played:-)

In the combat scenes I have played, I use High Guard.  The charts are
laid out simply and you don\'t spend hours looking through reams of
pages looking for the die modifier for a factor four sandcaster!

The High Guard system unfortunately does not allow for character
interactions.  Ship Tactics is used, Fleet tactics rarely, and
you only get a paltry bonus for Pilot-3 and Pilot-5.
Gunnery skill is never used at all.  (Stupid?  you bet!)

In combat, the Pilot never has to make a roll of the dice.  (Dumb)
In defending, a sandcaster or laser gunner doesn\'t roll the dice.  (Dumb)

Small idea:

Defender and attacker roll simultaneously.  Higher roll wins.
There would have to be modifiers due to skills, computer models, agility,
weapons used and power thereof.  (Yeah, you\'d need tables of modifiers,
but it would be more exciting anyway {Which is the whole purpose behind
combat simulation anyway})  Also, If we could establish a rule for making
sence out of the modifiers it would be a lot quicker)

(divide weapon factor by 2 for modifier bonus?)

Please note this is off the top of my head, so don\'t hold me to these figures,
just think of the concepts.

Another problem with combat is the Damage charts.  We could use some more
colorful results than (-1 fuel, or -1 power{which doesn\'t mean anything
any more}).  I\'d like to see a fleshed out damage table.  Say one with
hull breach on it (explosive decompression for the foolish enough not to
depressurize the hull before going into combat)  What about Fuel breach
inboard?  (liquid hydrogen gets dumped INside the ship)  Cargo hold hit?
Living quarters hit?  Small craft bay hit?  No they aren\'t deadly, but
they add flavor to the combat.

\'Hey Mark Venture, your stateroom was wiped out by that last salvo, so much
for your Queen Starsha blow up doll.\'

Now, who cares if these results aren\'t important for fleet combat.
As Rob suggested, if these results are only for small ships run by characters
(5000 tons at the VERY outside) They will do JUST FINE for nearly all purposes
of combat with player characters.

I am inclined to think that Ship combat as put out in MegaTrav, needs a
flow chart.  If we had a chart that said,
1.	Sensor tasks
2.	Firing tasks
3.	Evasive tasks
4.	Defensive/Penetration tasks
5.	Damage tasks
6.	Damage Control Tasks
etc. etc.
with maybe just a few basic modifiers, this could work better.
But as of now, It is just too long to read through, and the material
does not lend itself to easy understanding which can lead to shortcuts.

On design:  Here is a question:  Can one crew member only use one HUD?
It seems to me in the pictures I\'ve seen of HUD\'s in modern combat aircraft,
that the actual HUD is very small, covering only a small portion of the
pilots vision.  Suppose, that when 2 HUDs are listed, it simply means, that
this HUD installation is twice the size of a standard HUD?

Watercraft designs:  Well, GDW it seems finally got around to doing it.
Pity it isn\'t as detailed as George\'s version, but It seems like it\'ll do.
(HEy!
 Now we can build aluminum and titanium vehicles!  YEAH!)

A personal note on the subject.  Maybe I\'m getting paranoid or something,
I never really expected to see anything out of the designs I have posted here.
But, It seems to me that the story that GDW put as a note to the Watercraft
design article reminds me a great deal of the design I put out for the
Herbert Dean class Meson Submarine.  Ok, so they didn\'t have a meson gun
aboard the sub, but it would have been a MUCH better design if they had.
The laser\'s they talk about in the story are a STUPID design.  (Sure, put
a triple beam turret on a bouy!)

It would make more sence to put in a small meson bay(or indeed a large one)

I realize that if they did steal something, it was probably more from
George, but I think my design inspired them a bit(conceited aren\'t I?)

Plus in the story the Imperial Admiral seemed to have forgotten the planet\'s
possible deep site meson guns!

Ahh well, enough rambling, misspelling and grumbling from me...

	I\'ve been sitting on an analysis of it for a couple of days now...
I have to say, McInnes has redeemed himself for COACC now.  This is actually
reasonable.

	It isn\'t the way I would (or was 8) do it, but it seems workable.

	I am in the process of doing some displacement-based propulsive
power checks.  The two I\'ve done so far seem viable.

	A couple of nits; no combat rules yet (ok, next issue...), and there
was nothing about sub hull strength.  Also, the armour system is a kluge
(shades of the most _fun_ parts of Striker, mixed with MT...).  It seems
to be viable, though.
	Who knows?  I\'m sending them a letter poking them about that, but
it (assuming the holes are filled in the next two parts) seems workable.

I\'ve been using a Toshiba Laptop PC for sometime to help run a traveller
game. The PC is just used as a quick way of going through some tables. Most
of the fun stuff, like personal and starship combat is done with the old
favourite dice. The programs I use are: Jo Jaquinta\'s excellent world
data viewer, an NPC generator and name generator from the archives, a few
other small progs to automate a few tables and an amazing program for
advanced character generation. This program generates all advanced 
MegaTraveller characters interactively or automatically. This really
speeds up the first part of the game. The program guides you through 
the rolling up process so you dont loose the feel of the rolling up process.
The guy who wrote it is considering making it available via shareware.

[] interactions.  Ship Tactics is used, Fleet tactics rarely, and
[] you only get a paltry bonus for Pilot-3 and Pilot-5.
[] Gunnery skill is never used at all.  (Stupid?  you bet!)
[] 
[] In combat, the Pilot never has to make a roll of the dice.  (Dumb)
[] In defending, a sandcaster or laser gunner doesn\'t roll the dice.  (Dumb)

I would like to avoid too many dire rolls.  The biggest pain in combat is
the friggin dice.

How about these apples:
    1) The pilot (or helmsman and navigator for large ships) and each gunner
       roll 2d+skill and consult <insert magic chart name> to determine a
       general efficiency rating for the start of combat.
    2) In combat, 2d6+(gunner rating)+(weapon accuracy rating)-(pilot rating)-
       (agility rating)-(defensive rating) is cross-checked on a firing table
       corresponding to the number of weapons fired (may use HG numbers for
       space saving) to determine the number of weapon hits.  The amount of
       computer resources devoted to the weapon system improves the basic
       accuracy bonus.  Likewise, the amount of resources devoted to evasive
       actions will determine the computer add to the ship\'s defensive rating.
    3) Every <insert number> of combat rounds of action, pilot and gunner
       numbers will move towards their "average rating".  Thus while the
       initial rounds of combat could find everyone at various degrees of
       readiness, longer combats will find them working at their averag level.
    
       example: Say on <magic chart> pilot A gets a roll of 10, giving him
       an efficiency of +2.  After X combat rounds, his extreme readiness will
       sink to +1, and eventually to +0.  Likewise, pilots who end up being
       off-guard (-2, -3, etc) will get "into the groove" and remove those
       nasty modifiers.  The size of the control-space (cramped, roomy) will
       alter the time to change levels (roomier = slower tiring and faster
       acclimation, more cramped = faster tiring and slower catch-up).

    4) Weapon accuracy\'s are based on ease of tracking and hitting (i.e. 
       beam lasers are +1, while pulse lasers are +0).

    5) Computer Power is "allocated" for different tasks.  Using the Maximum
       CP input as a "power rating", "allocate" these CP\'s for combat tasks.
     
       example: The ship\'s computer has <what ever fits, I don\'t have my book 
       with me> a limit of 15CP.  If the ship has two gunnery positions, the
       pilot may allocate 5CP to each gunnery position and reserve 5CP for
       evasive action control.

       This simulates the computer power dedicated toward target location
       prediction (i.e. Predict programs from book 2) as well as "Jinking"
       and "facing" changes for defeating such programs (i.e. Maneuver/Evade).
       
       The number of CP required for each bonus is some some power function,
       not linear.  The power function for evasion ramps up faster and starts
       at a higher number.  [Note: Somebody good at "does it look reasonable"
       math please come up with some functions...I was thinking of 
       2+CP^2 for gunnery and 3+CP^3 for evasion.
  
    6) The Hit tables correspond to the HG ratings:

If we don\'t mind escaping the dice mindset, perhaps a deck of cards could
be used.  GDW is using them for NPC personalities, why not come up with an
index using cards.  If you draw a card for a peice of equipment you don\'t have,
simply draw again.  

Like in SFB, when allocating damage, draw no more than 13 cards before
reshuffling the deck, to prevent the same damage for each ship.

One of the more interesting role-palying games I have, and like,
is Space Opera by FGU. Speaking from memory, which has been known
to be faulty :-), the starship combat system seems to be what 
everyone is writing about. It\'s not perfect but it did include 
damage to various ship systems, in more detail than what is in MT. 
Damage resolution was setup as cascading tables. The first table 
included major systems like engeering, bridge, weapons and such. 
Then each major system had a table and in some case there were 
subtables from the major systems. Damage was computed and determined
by another roll and if a system wasn\'t destroyed outright, hard to
do, it was given a repair time and difficulty level depending on
character skill and facilities available.

On another note, the group I play with here really doesn\'t care 
about starship combat. If I\'m GM\'ing a game and I include a
combat scene I know what the outcome will be, unless of course,
the players do someting totally off the wall (which has been known
to happen), and I play the scene to include the appropriate 
characters and their skills. I reslove damage on what I had planned
to happen. For me, it\'s much easier this way.

PS:
If you haven\'t seen an FGU game, by all means, take a look at one!
It adds another meaning to the word complicated.

A MASSIVE MISSIVE FROM WILDSTAR
 
Hi again, time for another long-winded response (luckily, I only get a chance
to compose these things on the weekends).  Again, it\'s long, because I am 
trying to cover most of the topics mentioned during the last week or so.  
Here goes!
 
CAUTION: FALLING ROCK ZONE
 
The October/November issue of Air&Space Smithsonian has an interesting article
by Gerrit L. Vershuur entitled "This Target Earth".  He reports on the recent
International Conference on Near-Earth Asteroids; and the article has some
bearing on a recent TML discussion.
 
According to Steve Ostro of JPL, an asteroid large enough (about 50 feet
accross, or larger) to produce a nuclear-sized blast passes within the
Moon\'s orbit once every several hours.
 
Eugene Shoemaker of the US Geological Survey estimates the chance that a
half-mile-wide object will strike the Earth within the next 100 years at one
in a thousand.  The odds are the same that an object half that size will
hit within 25 years.
 
David Morrison of NASA provided a rule of thumb for calculating the energy
of an asteroid impact.  The energy of an Asteroid striking the Earth at a
typical speed of 24,000 miles per hour is 50 times greater than that produced
by an equivalent amount of TNT.  A six-mile-wide object (such as the one
believed to have triggered the K-T extinction) would strike with the force
of a 100 million megaton TNT explosion (or about 10,000 times the the combined
destructive power of the world\'s nuclear arsenals).
 
The Tunguska blast has been estimated at 10 to 30 megatons, and could have
been caused by about half a million tons of ice and rock.  A collision
of that magnitude in an urban location today could kill up to 330,000 people.
 
FALLING ROCKS IN MEGATRAVELLER
 
A strike cruiser with empty 100-ton bays could cary a 1350-kiloliter
chunk of asteroidal material in each one.  Assuming that asteroidal rock
is similar to granite, it would mass 2770kg per cubic meter, or 1870 metric
tons.  On impact, each one would do about the same damage as 186.98 kilotons
of TNT (note that I am using metric tons here).  If the deadfall ordinance
were constructed of cast iron, it would mass 7200kg/m3, and pack a 0.486
megaton wallop.
 
A cruiser designed to carry deadfall ordinance in support of planetary
invasions could be designed to transport 25 such rocks in 100 ton bays.  A
50,000 ton cruiser would still have plenty of hardpoints left over for
adequate conventional armament.  A typical mission profile would have the
ship collect suitable rocks or deadfall bombs, and make an in-system jump
to the release point.  With proper navigation, the velocity vector of the
ship and rocks can be in opposition to that of the planet, resulting in
the necessicary velocity without undue maneuvering.  The ship then performs
final course corrections, releases the deadfall ordinance, and jumps away
before it passes within the 100-diameter limit.
 
A laser-armed ship could locate suitable rocks (just about any type would
do, but the denser the better; a 1350 cubic meter chunk of water ice would 
have the same destructive power as 67.5 kilotons of TNT).  Laser weapons
would then be used to cut the rocks to the correct shape for the bays.
Cast iron deadfall bombs could be manufactured relatively easily in any belt
with a sufficient supply of nickel-iron asteroids.  Basic microgravity
smelting and casting could create a large quantity of bombs cheaply.
Cheap and destructive.  Brings new meaning to the term "Iron Bomb".
 
ALSO FROM AIR&SPACE
 
Completely off the subject, but someone may be interested and want to take
advantage of this information.  General Chuck Yeager, USAF (Ret) will give
his annual General Electric Aviation Lecture at the Langley Theater in 
the Smithsonian\'s National Air and Space Museum on Thursday, October 17th.
Call the Smithsonian Information line at (202)-357-2700 for more information.

COMPUTER-AIDED GAMING (THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY)
 
I have a friend (and avid gamer of all types) who insists that any computer
added to a role-playing session will ruin the session for everyone.  He
absolutely refuses to have anything to do with a game session which involves
a computer.  On the other hand, he uses a computer himself in preparation
for his games.
 
He bases his opinion on the observation that most of the people he knows
will tend to ignore the progress of the game (and also not properly
role-play their characters) while they play with the nifty new toy.
 
My general feeling is that almost any computer program is going to cause
at least as much work for the referee as it eliminates; its just a question
of what kind of work is easiest for the referee and players to handle in
the course of the game.  The "toy effect" will probably wear off after
everyone has had a chance to play with the computer for a couple of hours.
Once the thing stops being a novelty (say after a couple of sessions), then
everyone can get on with the game, and use it as an information resource.
 
COMPUTER AIDED ROLE-PLAYING
 
Personally, I would want a number of different things in a computer-based
role-playing game aid.  For the players I would want a database-like
program which could dispense library data and other information (much like
the kinds of things that are in the Imperial Encyclopedia).  Writing such
a program would not be hard -- the main trouble is in the massive amount
of data entry which would be necessacary in order for it to really take
the burden off of the referee.  The database would, of course, have to be
amenable to modifications by the referee.  Probably this would work by 
appplying some kind of pre-generated (by the referee, and perhaps on a 
different system) update file before each session).
 
As a referee I would want a program which could generate minor NPC\'s to
order.  For example, I might tell it that I wanted a Navy Captian and a 
pair of Marine guards.  With a little more data about the minor NPC\'s
available at no extra referee cost, I could add that much more detail
to the game.  Similarly, a program wich could whip up various kinds of
encounters would be nice.
 
The only computerized referee aids that I normally use are stored in my
programmable calculator (HP-41CV).  I have a number of dice simulations 
assigned to user-programmable keys.  When I have to roll a d26, I just type 
26 and hit the 1dX key.  Similarly, I have all of the standard kinds of 
polyhedral dice attached to other keys.  I also have a program which 
generates quick UPP stats for NPC\'s.

Well, it depends on what kind of hardware you want to write for.  I happen to
have three PDP-11\'s sitting around here (an 11/44, and 11/34, and an 11/23)
in operable condition.  The 11/23 has 8 serial ports, and cards can
be installed in the 11/44 to support over 24 users.  According to the DEC
literature I have, MUMPS, RSTS/E, or IAS on a midrange PDP-11 (like the 44) 
can support this many users.  At last count, we had more than a dozen 
termials or small computers here with compatible serial ports.  And that\'s 
not counting the three printing terminals or the Northstar MP/M box.

Give the technology another 5 years or so.
 
THE FRIGATES
 
Yes, more cost effective ships can be built.  Large ships are not cost
effective in combat for one major reason: a single spinal meson hit (say of 
about UCP Factor G or better) which penetrates will knock out almost any 
ship, unless it has multiple redundant backups of almost everything.  With 
a +6 DM on the Interior Explosion damage table, 6 rolls usually generate a 
"Mission Kill": a ship so badly damaged that it is no longer capable of 
fufilling its mission.  (The expected value of 6 rolls is 1.00 Critical, 
0.67 Fuel Tanks Shattered, Sensors-2.83, Jump-1.67, PowerPlant-1.33, 
Crew-0.50, and Computer-0.33).
 
The original reason I posted the designs was to try and get some feedback
from TML on the accuracy of the spreadsheet I used to create them.  Has
anyone found any impossibilities or strange numbers?
 
STARSHIP DESIGN AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS
 
I hadn\'t given the cost effectiveness of meson screens much thought; I
simply assumed that in any reasonable game, the costs of a defense (price,
mass, volume, and power consumption) approximately balance the utility (in
terms of defensive effectiveness).  I am guilty of forgetting that
MegaTraveller is not a reasonable game.
 
On the other hand, the only way to improve the DefDM of the frigate designs
is to reduce them to less than 10,000 dispacement tons; this may not be
possible without sacrificing all of the armor, screens, secondary weapons,
and reducing the meson gun to a factor J.  OK, so be it.
 
So, let\'s analyse a meson screen.  Let\'s start from the combat system\'s tasks.
In order for a ship to be hit with a meson gun, the weapon must first hit, and
then penetrate two possible defenses (meson screen and configuration).  I will
take a look at two ships, both assumed to be identical, except that the smaller
one has no screens, armor, secondary weapons, and has a factor J spinal mount.
The analysis will be for both ships, with [information about the small ship
appearing in brackets, like this].  Both ships have Mod-9/Fib computers, 6G
agility 6 maneuver drives, and are at TL 15.
 
To Hit: Difficult, OFF=(Computer Size + Weapon "To Hit" DM), DEF=DefDM
With a UCP T [J] Meson Gun, we have OFF=+18, and DEF=-14 [-15] for a net DM of
+4 [+3]; the weapon will hit on a roll of 7+ [8+], or about 58% [42%].
 
To Penetrate: Difficult, OFF=(Computer Size + "To Pen" DM), DEF=Computer Size
With a UCP 9 Meson Screen against a factor T [J] weapon, we have DMs of 
OFF=+15 [+11], and DEF=-9 for a net DM of +6 [+2]; the weapon will penetrate 
on a roll of 5+ [9+], or about 83% [28%].  Of course, a ship with no Meson 
Screen gets no roll at all.
 
For kicks, let\'s consider configuration.  The best has a "To Pen" DM of +6
[+3], while the worst has +11; a Needle/Wedge has +8 [+5].  The penetration
rolls are 5+ [8+] for the best, 0+ for the worst, and 3+ [6+] for a
Needle/Wedge.  The penetration probabilities are 83% [28%] at best, 100% at
worst, and 97% [72%] for the Needle/Wedge.
 
HYPOTHETICAL COMBAT
 
OK, what do those numbers mean?  Let\'s now consider a hypothetical combat
between these two ships.  For the small ship targetting the larger (Factor J
Meson Gun against a DefDM of -14, Factor 9 Meson Screen, and Needle/Wedge
configuration).  58% of the shots hit; of those, 28% penetrate the screen, and
finally, 72% of the remainder penetrate the configuration.  The net result is
that 11.7% of the shots fired actually damage the target.  The return fire
(Factor T meson gun against a DefDM of -15 and a Needle/Wedge configuraton)
hits 42% of the time, and 97% of those penetrate the configuration.  Of the
shots fired, 40.7% hit and penetrate.
 
This means that simply to achieve the same number of hits, the small vessels
must outnumber the larger ones by 3.48 to 1 (not unreasonable, considering
that the smaller ships are about one tenth the size of the large ones, and
probably achieve cost savings to match).
 
In the case of the frigates (or other "capital" ships), simply achieving an 
equal number of hits is not enough.  A Factor J hit on a 95,000 ton hull 
generates 10 interior explosions, but the frigates mount a Factor 4 black 
globe screen, which would reduce the damage to 2 interior explosions, and
those at a net -2 on the table.  The frigate should be able to absorb an
average of 10 such hits before a "mission kill" occurrs.  On the other hand, 
a Factor T hit on a 10,0000 ton hull generates 8 critical hits and 19 interior
 explosions.  With the fragate\'s globe screen up, the damage is reduced to 
11 interior explosions, each at a net -2 DM.  Two hits will kill the ship. 
 
The end result is that the group of smaller ships much acheive approximately
a 5 to 1 hit ratio over the frigate.  This could be achieved by outnumbering 
the large ship by about 19 to 1.  Depending on the exact design of the small
ships, this may or may not be possible.  This week\'s vehicle design challenge
is to come up with a ship under 10,000 tons which costs less than 
MCr 4,178.1033 in quantity and mounts a Factor J Meson Gun and 
delivers a DefDM of -15, when constructed at TL15.
 
A more efficient design for the smaller ships (using a type 7USL hull,
for example) may also help.  The new hit percentage by the frigate against the
smaller vessel becomes 34.9%.  This alters the hit ratio to 2.98 to 1, and the
damage exchange ratio becomes about 15 to 1.
 
CONCLUSION
 
A Meson screen is an effective defense against the smaller classes of Meson
Gun; a Factor 9 screen makes a vessel effectively immune to secondary meson
weapons (Factor B or less).  It is also an effective defense against weapons
(typically Factor C through M) on second-rate ships such as a hypothetical
sub-10,000 ton vessels.  It is not a very effective defense agains the main
guns (factors N through Z) of first-rate capital ships; but then again, 
nothing else is either, and a weak defense is better than none.
 
For pure combat efficency, a single-purpose, single-weapon design should
be able to defeat a much larger, general purpose vessel.  This was true in
WWII when a PT boat could (if it was lucky) dispatch an enemy cruiser, and
it is true now (consider an Exocet or Harpoon armed PHM) and it will
undoubetdly be true in the future.  But larger general-purpose ships will
still be built.
 
SIMPLIFYING STARSHIP COMBAT

Take a long, hard look at Harpoon.  The actual damage system is quite
simple; all of the complexity of the game is in the sensors and deals with
the problem of locating your enemy.  Although Harpoon is by no means a
simple game, it provides suprisingly realistic results for the size of the
rulebook.  I haven\'t seen Captain\'s Edition Harpoon, which is supposed to
be an even simpler version.
 
General Suggestions for improving starship combat:
1) Change the time scale.  Starship combat happens incredibly slowly; a
modern Mk41 VLS (US Navy vertical launch missile system) can fire off
all 90 of its SM2 missiles in about a minute and a half.  Once firing starts,
a Harpoon combat that lasts 20 minutes (40 turns) is unusual; I\'ve never
had one.  In comparison, the MegaTraveller spaceship combat turn is 20
minutes long.  Battles last for hours, and a TL15 missile bay has a ROF of 2, 
or 50 missiles in two and a half minutes (1/3 the speed of a Mk41).  Consider
time scales of 6 seconds, 1 minute, or (at most) 10 minutes; the same
scales used by the other MegaTraveller combat systems.
2) Bring back vector movement (the "circling in a hex" really bugs me).
3) The whole fire resolution system needs work.  I\'d like to see really
big ships become more combat effective.
4) Take a look at old Book 2.  Talk about simplified.
 
HARDPOINTS and HULL DESIGN
 
There has been considerable discussion about hardpoint restrictions and vessel
construction.  A couple of points are probably worth discussing.  I have long
felt that the limitations on mounting of spaceship weapons are essentially
arbitrary.  Worth considering is the "40% rule" : That no more than 40% of
the ship\'s volume be allocated to movable (as opposed to fixed) weapons 
mounts.  In other words, one turret with 40% of the volume, or 40 turrets 
of 1% volume each.  In addition each weapon mount (movable or not) would
require a hardpoint - a specially designed location on the hull which can
accept a weapon installation.  The cost, mass, and waste volume of the hull 
should be derived from a formua similar to the following:
 
	Value = Base * MaxAccel * (K1 * SQRT(Volume) + K2 * Hardpoints)
 
Where Value is the value (Cost, Mass, or Waste Volume) to be determined,
MaxAccel is the maximum accelleration the hull can withstand, K1 and K2 are
a constants unique to the selected configuration and streamlining, Volume 
is the total volume enclosed by the hull, and Hardpoints is total volume of
weapons for which hardpoints are to be included.
 
NOBLE PLAYER CHARACTERS
 
One of my (few) hard-and-fast rules is that a player character cannot begin
play as a ruling noble.  If someone generates a character with a high social
standing, fine; I sit down with the player and make it quite clear what he
or she can and can\'t do.  Typically, the caracter is a junior (in terms of
proximity to ruling power) member of an important family.
 
Someone with a SOC of F should be in the same position of relative advantage
as someone with a STR or DEX of F.  It\'s relatively rare to generate, and can
make for some interesting role-playing.
 
One of the more memorable in recent games has been one Ezekial "Zeke" 
VonMeezer, the youger son of Baron Johann VonMeezer (a noble of some 
importance in the Marches).  The Baron still percieves Zeke as the headstrong,
irresponsible teenager who left the household twelve years ago to enlist in the
IISS (very much against his father\'s wishes) instead of following the family
tradition in his older brother\'s footsteps (first college; then a job in one of
the family businesses, to learn decision making; then a stint as manager at one
of the estates, to learn responsibility; then ...)

Jo, in my specific case, I don\'t have a use for it and I can\'t get it EASILY.
I have to use BITFTP and it is real picky about going overseas for things.
When we go live on Internet within the next few weeks, that will most definatly
change.  Now, I don\'t have a use for it because I can\'t get anyone here in
Louisville to play Traveller.

I think it would be more in demand if we had computers where we play.  We have
four gaming Zones per se.  At one house, we play around a ping-pong table.  The
computer is upstairs in a office.  At another, we sit on couches and chairs.
The Amiga is in the same room but not really available where we sit.  The DM
has at times used Deluxe Paint on the Amiga to do Dungeon mapping, but it
slowed things down, though it was rather useful.

At the other two locations the computer is in an office while we sit around in
the living room.  Only the one house where we use the PingPong table would
gathering the group around the computer to look things up would work well.

Again, this requires a dedicated facility.  The powerbill on that 11/44 must be
a killer :-)  I wish I had those facilities, but space is another issue as well
as portability.

Computers in role-playing are very useful.  I use them to generate systems,
NPCs, Cargo, and names.  I usually keep my most important characters in
electronic form.  I wrote a program that would take the sector data and
generate the Postscript subsector maps for each sector (based on works from the
TML).  I use drawing software to create maps and art work when it makes sense
to do so.  I also use a lot of hand drawn art as well.  I would love nothing
more than to have a computer handy as a GM and I would love to have the Library
data sitting there for the players.  I just can\'t afford a Laptop to make it
portable.

Just more random comments!

Sub: Recent TML musings

    In the past weeks, I have been watching the TML with great
interest.  I would appreciate it greatly if you would post this
letter, so that I can get my 2 cents in.  This covers no single
topic...

 - A while back, someone asked about playing nobles.  Without
getting long-winded, let me remind you that individual planets
have rulers and nobility, who may or may not ALSO have Imperial
titles, but will have power.  Unlike a holder of an Imperial
patent, the relative power of such planetary nobility is entirely,
justifiably, at the mercy of the Referee, because the home
planet can vary so much.  The King of a world with 4000 people
may have a high title, but won\'t have as much power as the state
governor ("Baron") of a world with 4,000,000 inhabitants.

 - About Star Viking:  All system questions aside, my understanding
of the "Plunder Era" is that it is at least a decade further
down the (Imperial) timeline, possibly more.  Those of you disgruntled
with the Rebellion Era should probably read "Prologue: Adventures in
the Imperium\'s Past" in Journal #20 (yes, I know it\'s hard to find).
The important point is that the history of the three Imperiums is
defined well enough for play at nearly any point along the timeline.
Star Viking could be about several periods of humaniti\'s history,
including the post-Rebellion era.  What Star Viking does is extend
the known timeline forward as well as backward.  Traveller has always
been applicable to differing levels of technology.  If it weren\'t, it
wouldn\'t have rules for building craft at any TL other than 15.

 - Burton, Hordelings, et all: If you design ships using hardpoint
variations or other _major_ anomalies from the RM, please label
them for us.  Minor anomalies can be ignored; major anomalies don\'t
get used (unless well labeled).

 - To all you craft designers:  I\'ve been collecting ship designs from
many and various sources, and I have noticed that odd Tech Levels get
most of the attention.  Let\'s see a few 12s and 14s, eh?

 - Scott Kellogg and other Wet Navels:  Here is a timetable for Wet
Navy, George\'s "Proposed Waterfaring Craft Design Rules",
and related events:

   Apr 29, 1990 -- Wet Navy, Part 1 (Sailor characters), and Part 2
                   (Design) appears in GEnie Games RT Library. The author
                   is Terry McInnes.
   May  7, 1990 -- Terry McInnes starts Topic 38 (Wet Navy) in the
                   GEnie Games RT.
   Jun  5, 1990 -- Wet Navy, Part 2 (rev 4) appears in Games Library.
                   This is the last revision to appear on GEnie.
                   Further revision is piecemeal in Topic 38 or never
                   appears on GEnie.
   Jul 30, 1990 -- Wet Navy, Part 3 (Combat) appears in GEnie Games
                   RT Library.  This includes the first draft of the
                   fiction which appears in Challenge 53.
   Aug  _, 1990 -- I (James Kundert) first log on to GEnie.
   Oct  5, 1990 -- I begin design of a Meson-bay submarine.  Holes
                   in then-current design system halts project.
                   Discussion of rotating spinal mounts follows my
                   question about facings. (All documented in Topic 38).
   Nov 26, 1990 -- Initial report:  sale of Wet Navy to Challenge Magazine.
   Dec  2, 1990 -- Stephen Madjanovic appears in Topic 38, and promptly
                   turns the power/speed formula inside-out.  Further
                   revisions occur, of which very few reach GEnie.
   Apr  4, 1991 -- George William Herbert posts his "Proposed
                   Waterfaring Craft Design Rules" to the TML.
   Apr  _, 1991 -- Terry McInnes goes on vacation for two months, and is
                   entirely unreachable during that time.  Some final
                   revision takes place with the assistance of
                   an anonymous naval architect.
   Apr 13, 1991 -- Rob Dean posts his first Waterfaring designs to the TML.
   May  _, 1991 -- I gain net access.  Late in month I join the TML.  Aside
                   from Wilson "Mac" Liaw (who doesn\'t talk much), this is
                   the first time the two (GEnie/HIWG and TML) are
                   connected.
   Jun  3, 1991 -- I post my first (and only) message to the TML
                   (as jim@grapenuts.llnl.gov, an address I no longer use)
                   and pass the word about Wet Navy. Frantic E-Mail
                   flies for several days between George and myself, and
                   a letter gets sent to Challenge.
   Jun 19, 1991 -- George posts the results of his letter to Challenge.
   Jul  6, 1991 -- Scott Kellogg posts his "Herbert Dean class Meson Sub"
                   to the TML.
   Jul  7, 1991 -- Feasibility of Deep Meson Sites and Subs argued on TML.
                   This continues for some time.
   Jul 10, 1991 -- Rob Dean first appears on GEnie.
   Oct 13, 1991 -- Challenge 53 appears in stores. Contains first half of
                   Wet Navy Design rules.  There are problems, but most
                   occured between submission and publication.  Corrections
                   should appear with second part.
   Nov  _, 1991 -- Challenge 54 appears in stores. Contains the remainder
                   (we hope) of the Wet Navy Design rules.  This should
                   include sub depth limits (which are part of design
                   evaluation).
   Dec  -, 1991 -- Challenge 55 appears in stores.  May or may not have
                   further Wet Navy material (I don\'t recall the final
                   decision from Challenge).

    Note that your Meson Sub appears near the bottom of this chronology.
Even with Rob and Carl present on both networks, GEnie and the TML are still
basically isolated from each other, so there is no COPYING involved.
Submarine SDB designs at high TL tend to start looking the same after
some thought is applied to weapons technology.
    As a comment on the sub itself:  without grav plates and inertial
compensation, that sub is not going to be able to fire the Meson-T at
targets more than 20 or 30 degrees above (or below) the horizon.  Spinal
Mounts must be aimed by turning the ship (or sub).  Only massive structures
(like the Imperial Palace, or a planet) have the space available for
rotating spinal mounts.


    I hope to return to an active role on the TML before too much longer.

Well, all the talk about the subject of high velocity projectiles got me
to thinkin\' about it again.  (OH NO! I hear you cry, NOT AGAIN!)

Well, for those who don\'t remember, Here was the basic summary.

Take a Scout ship, accelerate for 18 days @ 2 G\'s and you reach 10% of the
speed of light.  Toss a 10 gram object out the airlock and it will hit
with the equevalent energy of 1 Kiloton of TNT.

Problems:  @ .1c navigation can be difficult.  A dust particle will rip your
ship to shreds...  Sensors won\'t provide aedequate warning time for course
corrections.  The potential energy of the hydrogen fuel (when converted
completely from mass to energy w/100% efficiency) is insufficient to get you
to .1c.  There were other problems.  I still think if done outside the
eccliptic plane the nav problems could be solved, but that\'s not really
important.

Well, I got to thinking about this matter again, and wondered just what
energy  would be had after just 1 day\'s worth of acceleration @ 2G\'s.
Well, with some really rough back of the envelope calculations.  (no I didn\'t
really check my math very well)  One comes to the conclusion that one
must increase the mass of the projectile dramatically to keep the energy
the same.  So, after 1 day\'s acceleration instead of 10 grams, you have
to throw 3.25 kilograms out the airlock to still hit the target with 1
kiloton.  So, you want that city wiped out?  Just throw 3.25 metric tons
out at it for a one megaton yield.

Now while I am willing to conceed that accelerating on a constant vector
for 18 days might get you a speeding ticket, accelerating for ONE day will
have to fall under the category of normal operations for a scout ship.

BOOM!

Am I the only one who felt that this is silly?  Black globes can "flicker",
i.e. switch on and off in order to let weapons and drives work.  Why not
synchronise the weapons (or at least, the spinal mount) with the globe -
for a while, the globe switches off, and the weapon fires unimpeded.  Of
course, if an enemy weapon hits at the same time, it is also unaffected.
But for an enemy ship to arrange for his fire to arrive at my ship at the
exact time that the black globe switches off while I fire is a pretty neat
trick.

Also, how come missiles treat black globes as armour?  I\'d think that either
the missile gets through, and does its full damage, or it doesn\'t get through,
and does nothing except give the black globe some energy.  There\'s also the
matter of what happens to solid matter in general when it hits a black globe.

Anyway, when I used black globes in High Guard, I disregarded the bit about
a black globe protecting both the user and the enemy; and when missiles hit,
I rolled a D10 to see if they got through.  (If 1D10 was greater than the
ship\'s USP black globe code, the missile got through, and was unaffected by
the black globe, otherwise the missile hit the globe.)

One article later, SULAIMAN@ecs.umass.edu also writes:

Here we go again.  Summary of arguments about this idea:
..Anyone caught doing it would be lynched by everyone.  The Imperial and
Zhodani navies would probably co-operate for the first time in their lives
to catch the culprit.

..The type S would have to accelerate to a tremendous velocity to do this.
Physics experts here doubted that the ship could get enough kinetic energy
from the ship\'s drives.

..The ship which tried this would itself be vapourised by the first dust
particle it hit.  The only pilot you would get for such a mission would
be a mad Vargr intent on getting the title "fastest sentient being alive",
shortly before he got the title "fastest cloud of gas", and with a big
question being raised about the inclusion of the word "sentient" in the
former title.

"Battle stations!  Energize main defensive nuclear dampers, power to main
meson screens.  Sensors, get me some identification on the attacking

"Con, Sensors, the planetary defence sensor grid says there\'s a Bat-Ron of
Empress Jeannie class battle ships out there, coming in fast."

The navigator swung around.  "Captain, that blast we felt was the number
sixty two underwater geothermal power station.  Lucky no one was there."

"Right, so the enemy has advanced knowlege of our submarine power net, but
NOT where the subs are.  Communications, send warning to the fleet.  Tell
them Geothermal station 62 is out.  Tell the Skydivers to prepare for action.
Divert them to any sensor bouys dropped by the Jeannie fleet."

"Weapons officer, have you got a lock yet?"

"Aye sir, we have a passive neutrino lock on what appears to be the
lead Jeannie in the fleet.  Bearing 32 degrees, angle of elevation
82 degrees."

"Diving Officer, raise ship into firing position."

"Aye sir, 20 degrees up on the bow planes..."

The dark hull of the meson sub stirred from the bottom like a shark.  The
trailing umbillical fed power to the subs systems so that not a single
neutrino would betray their position.  Inside the ship, the crew\'s couches
rotated as the angle of the deck raised to 82 degrees.  Not as comfortable
as it might be with grav plates to compensate, but then the artificial
gravity field would have betrayed the sub\'s position to the enemy fleet.

The weapons officer chimed out.  "Meson gun in position, awaiting orders to
fire!"

The captain growled for a moment and gave the command in a calm voice, "Fire."
Then under his breath, "Eat hot mesons, invader!"

(snicker snicker snicker)	:->

But seriously, I now realize that the Wet Navy stuff was worked on long
before I ever designed the Herbert Dean Meson Sub.  But, I still stand
by its design.  The lack of Grav plates & inertial comps was Not an
oversite, I wanted to reduce the signature of the ship (even if the
reduction won\'t show up in the rules as they are now.)  Grav plates,
inertial comps, etc. suck power.  to reduce the fusion reactor requirements
I just took \'em out.  Now, while you may say that\'s gonna be difficult
for a ship that tries to change it\'s orientation in a planet\'s gravity, I
would say no.  That would be taken into account in the design.  Rotating
couches or something similar.

Actually, I would have to argue that rotating couches would have to be
standard equipment on all combat ships in case of environmental systems
failure.  It is analogus to normal submarine operations.  They may have
backup lighting systems, but they are trained to operate the ship in
the dark.

If they weren\'t standard on combat ships, you\'d have ships being rendered
combat ineffective by environmental systems damage.  Also, Tech level
9 combat ships without grav plates or inertial comps would never be able
to funtion well.

As for the story in challenge, I still say it is a STUPID idea to put
lasers on a submarine.  Even X-ray lasers.  The whole idea of a submarine
is to conceal your location,  In order to use the lasers, you have to put
up a bouy as they did and that will reveal your location to some nut with
a nuclear missile.  And a nuclear missile against a sub, underwater will
be FAR more effective than against a ship in vacuum.  Direct fire weapons
went out at EARLY tl 6 when the British and French gave up on the idea of
submarine monitors and submarine cruisers.  Missiles and meson guns are
the only weapons that will be effective at high tech levels.  (counting
torpedoes as missiles)

By the way, have I interpreted the hull construction rules correctly as
they state them?  According to the way I read it, steel, superdense, and
coherant superdense all require the same thickness to give an equal amount
of armored protection.  Thus a 1 centimeter thickness of steel will have
the same strength as a 1 centimeter plate of coherant superdense, but the
superdense will weigh much less.  If so, why is it called \'dense\'?  It
makes no sence to me.

Also, I didn\'t see any formula for the calculation of operational/crush
depth.  Will this follow?

Well, we now have rules to build TL zero through four ships, will we see
rules on how to arm them?  What\'s the Penetration/attenuation of a
6 pounder?	Any ideas?

Design Freak Extraordinaire.

BTW, as we stated before, The Horde small craft collection was designed
with the agility formula that Rob Dean and I agreed upon and posted for
all to see.  If you don\'t like that, then the agility for most of them
becomes zero.  (Until you enter combat and use emergency agility whereupon
it goes back up to where it was before!)

PS  Did I read that right?  You want MORE designs?  TL 10?  12?  14?
hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe....
Actually, I\'m overloaded w/ course work right now.  But I\'ll think about it.

James Kundert had some questions about Wet Navy Part # in  Challenge #53.
Here are the answers plus a copy of a  letter to GDW requesting an errata to
correct some  typographical errors in the published copy

James,
 At last, a moment to respond to your bulletin board item.
 Page 22:  Yes, Diesel engines have no scale efficiency, and steam engines one
scale efficiency.
 Page 22-23  Its a ratio (in all cases, not just MHD tunnel drives) of weight
to meters in diameter and volume (in kiloliters) to meters in diameter,
although volume is not necessary except in tunnel drive systems.  Would have
loved to include an example but space was tight, extremely tight.
 Page 23- Sails:   50% of the mast height is the total yardarm span limit.
 You\'re right about the maximum fore and aft sail area. Although, further
testing suggests this may be too limiting.  It doesn\'t allow for very large
jibs, for instance.
 Page 24, the sail power table-- Yep, you\'re right, I should have included a
kg/meter column to make the transition easier.
 Page 24, the formulae: V2should beV squared.  The R formula  should be R=
sqrt (D)* rf (theresistance factor from the hull type  table.)
 Page 25, Superstructures:  That\'s an abbreviated version of the hull damage
point calc, only determining the destroyed level because I don\'t think you can
render a superstructure inoperable, but you sure can destroy it.  It relates
to combat rules and hit location tables yet to come, Michelle and Challenge
readers willing.

 As information, hereis the text of the letter I sent to Michelle  after
reading thePart 1 galley proofs:

 "Dear Michelle:
 I received the galley proofs for Wet Navy Part 1 yesterday afternoon and
checked them this morning.  I found a couple of areas where changes were
needed and tried to phone you at the office this morning.  However, the person
I spoke with said Challenge #53 was at the printers.
 These are the changes that are needed:
 Page 19, first paragraph:  You had changed the copy to read "Select a hull
size from the UCP column in the MegaTraveller basic hull design section of the
Small Craft Hull Table..."  This is incorrect, you can select a hull size from
any of the three hull size tables in the basic hull design section.  Wet
Vessels can be (and often are) as large as starships.
 Page 19, third paragraph:  "MegaTraveller Small Craft Hull Table."  Again,
any of the three tables can be used.
 Page 21 "Powered Ships" section third paragraph beginning "Calculate Hull
Resistance: Use the formula R=CDxrf..."  the formula should read R=(sqrt
(D))*rf.  The parentheses were  dropped. These are needed to make sure that
only the square root of D is extracted then multiplied by rf when calculating
R.  Otherwise a reader may multiply D times rf then extract the square root of
result which is incorrect.
 Page 23  "Sail Area" section, second paragraph, third sentence beginning "
Maximum mast height..."  Should read "Maximum mast height in meters equals the
square root of a hull\'s volume in kiloliters."; inserting "hull\'s" between "a"
and "volume".
 Page 24  The potential speed formula is incorrect.  You have it as V2=P2/R.
It should be V2=P2/R, that is V squared = (P*2)/R.

 (For clarification:  The power formula is P = R(V squared)/2. The velocity
formula is V Squared = (P times 2)/ R.)

 Page 24  The resistance formula is missing its parentheses. Should be R=(sqrt
(D)) * rf.  See my comments above.
 If at all possible, please publish at least the errata concerning the
formulae in Challenge #54.  If readers use the formulae as stated in #53 they
will get incorrect results.  Thanks in advance,
       Terry McInnes"

It\'s an interesting set of rules and I think a fine addition to MT, in that
it covers a fair sized gap in the rules. Having said that, I must also say
that I will not purchase this issue of Challenge, nor the next issue with
the second part, or Lord help us, a third issue with a third part. Why?

Maybe it\'s just me, but I\'m not going to pay $7+ just for a Wet Navy
rules addition, particularly when it\'s sandwiched into two or three magazines
along with materials on what seems like a dozen other gaming systems. It\'s
just not enough of a lure. I\'d much rather save my money for purchases where
I\'m getting some real value and quality for my dollar.

For me, I\'m salivating over the impending appearance of Solomani/Aslan, which
according to my hobby store DGP sophont, should be available by the end of
the month (if all goes well). Now THAT should be worth every penny if it is
as good as Vilani/Vargr was. However, I was sorely disappointed by the news
that the Robots/Cyborg book is on hold for the forseeable future. That is
another huge gap that cries out for redress... sigh. And with some luck, it\'s
not too much further to MTJ#3, so I\'m happy..

.... and if I need comic relief, there\'s always Star Viking. :->

Lucan rewarded an admiral who reduced a planet by conventional weaponry.

Perhaps it would, but that dosen\'t help against Scott\'s suggestion above.
No, the best reason why it dosen\'t work may be that the Referee don\'t want
any crazy shipowner in his game to be able to destroy a planet at a whim,
and so therefor he can\'t (or won\'t think about it). There\'s already other
areas where we have to be unrealistic in order to make the game fun. Think
about it. Even today weapons are made where the only real defense is to
avoid getting shot at. What with laser rangefinders and target painting and
special ammunition I\'m pretty sure that no real-life Traveller-style bunch
of adventurers would last longer than one or two fights. But we want our
players to last longer than one or two adventures, so we have rule that
makes getting shot at survivable (with luck ;-)

Funny, I got to thinking about jump torpedoes the other day. They are
mentioned in OT Adventure 4 "Leviathan", but not stats are given. Does
anybody know the size, power plant etc. of a jump torpedo? How does the
concept of jump torpedoes square with the rule that the minimum size of
a jump-capable vessel is 100 T? (Or am I misremembering? There is such a
rule, isn\'t there?)

\'Bubbles\' in the counts are provided by attempts to design a planetary army at 
TL9,  a mercenary ground unit at TL10, a mercenary fleet, a  planetary  fleet, 
and  a Vargr corsair fleet at TL13, and a subsector fleet and a merchant  line 
at  TL15.  Most of my designs are pegged to a producing world in the  Glisten, 
District 268, Lunion or Sword Worlds subsectors of the Spinward Marches,  home 
to  all of my games.  The absence of high population TL12 and TL14  worlds  in 
this region (Sacnoth/Sword Worlds excepted) has a strong correlation with  the 
lower  quantities  of  designs at those tech levels.  After  all,  I\'m  mostly 
designing  these things for my own use...posting them for the rest of  you  is 
gravy.

Regarding  variant  systems:  It can be assumed at the moment that any  of  my 
starships  and  small craft have an agility of zero under  the  \'real  rules\', 
since I never provide excess power for the \'agility generators\'.  Any  designs 
using thrust based acceleration figures also have a "Maneuver=X" notation,  so 
can  be read in standard format easily.  Despite discussion of the subject,  I 
have  used  no variant turret systems.  I have assumed that power  plants  are 
"load following", an assumption which is basically equivalent (in any but  the 
smallest starships) to the "booster plants" variation as discussed in  Travel-
ler\'s  Digest.   For  large ships, I felt that the  crew  values  artificially 
inflated command crews to no good purpose, so I used the same rule on  command 
crew as is used on bridge crew (if over ten, divide by ten and add ten).

Good Gaming,

\'Bubbles\' in the counts are provided by attempts to design a planetary army at 
TL9,  a mercenary ground unit at TL10, a mercenary fleet, a  planetary  fleet, 
and  a Vargr corsair fleet at TL13, and a subsector fleet and a merchant  line 
at  TL15.  Most of my designs are pegged to a producing world in the  Glisten, 
District 268, Lunion or Sword Worlds subsectors of the Spinward Marches,  home 
to  all of my games.  The absence of high population TL12 and TL14  worlds  in 
this region (Sacnoth/Sword Worlds excepted) has a strong correlation with  the 
lower  quantities  of  designs at those tech levels.  After  all,  I\'m  mostly 
designing  these things for my own use...posting them for the rest of  you  is 
gravy.

Regarding  variant  systems:  It can be assumed at the moment that any  of  my 
starships  and  small craft have an agility of zero under  the  \'real  rules\', 
since I never provide excess power for the \'agility generators\'.  Any  designs 
using thrust based acceleration figures also have a "Maneuver=X" notation,  so 
can  be read in standard format easily.  Despite discussion of the subject,  I 
have  used  no variant turret systems.  I have assumed that power  plants  are 
"load following", an assumption which is basically equivalent (in any but  the 
smallest starships) to the "booster plants" variation as discussed in  Travel-
ler\'s  Digest.   For  large ships, I felt that the  crew  values  artificially 
inflated command crews to no good purpose, so I used the same rule on  command 
crew as is used on bridge crew (if over ten, divide by ten and add ten).

Good Gaming,

Was it relased and I just happened to be asleep at the time?
I know DGP moved recently, but there used to be half page ads
for this thing "coming SOON!" and I haven\'t heard a peep.

Has anyone had trouble with DGP\'s phone ordering system?
I\'ve been waiting for a copy of MegaTrav Journal II for rather a
while.  The first time tried ordering it by phone I kept getting
their fax machine.  Rather frustrating when you are only a human
being who can\'t communicate in whistles, chirps and warbles.  (Maybe
if I were Ael Yael?)  A few days later, I tried again.  This time
I made it to the voice recording machine, only to have it cut off in
the middle of my order.  I called back and read off my order really
fast and I thought I had gotten it across before the machine cut me off
again.

But I figured from the 2 messages on the machine, both from me, what
would be a few seconds apart on the tape, they could figure it out.

They didn\'t.

This morning I tried agian.  The phone rang and rang, I could hear the
tone of the ringer changing as it was bounced from phone to phone.
Eventually, someone answered.  A HUMAN BEING!  I think I\'ll finally get
my copy now.

This is not the first screw up I\'ve had in communicating with DGP.
I have 2 copies of MegaTrav Journal I to prove it.  (anybody wanna trade?)

What\'s that you say?  Order by mail?  Write a letter?

Hmmph!  What\'s the point in living in a TL 7-8 world if you gotta use
TL 1 communications?

  The armor level has no direct relation to thickness. What the rules mean are
that to reach a certain level of protection using superdense instead of steel
you will need much less metal because the greated strength of the superdense,
thus the lower weigh.

  In old Striker it was stated explicitely that the \'armor mult\' figures for a 
certain armor factor equals the number of centimeters of hard steel needed to
get that armor factor. This was further modified by the now-so-called \'weight
modifier\' on the hull materials table. Since hard steel have 1.0 in it and 
bonded superdense is 0.16 every 1cm of steel will equate 0.16mm of bonded
superdense.

  They apparently postulate that all materials will have the same density,
which is bogus science but a little less bogus that 1cm steel having the same
strengh as 1cm superdense but the superdense being lighter.

  (Looking at \'wet navy\' in C53, it seems that that form of more bogus 
science has indeed snuck in the back way and become standard. Sigh! It would
be interesting to see what Terry McInnes would say if asked how his model
meshes with the one given in the Digest article about Radiation (which was
consistent with old Striker))

AutoCAD uses DXF (I think), there are undoubtedly many more.  My

Richard, I\'ve got a scanner, for B&W or greyscale, so long as the original
doesn\'t exceed 8 1/2" x 11" in size.  As for a public mailing address, you
can hand-deliver the originals to me, and I can put the resultant files
in TML Anon. FTP site on Sunbane.  I assume the final files should be in
GIF format, since the TML survey last year indicated that was the most

You give me detailed specs. and I\'ll try to draw them.  God knows, I\'ve
got enough horsepower at my disposal.

Chalmers, so it is from memory:

  In my latest campaign I had one base type of tranq and three add-on 
characteristics for it: Dose control, Cocktail and Broadspectrum.

  \'Standard\' tranq only worked on a single metabolic system, had no guarantee 
that it wouldn\'t kill by overdose even those it was optimised for, had 
unpredictable effects on all others and was cheap and lowtech. It is sold for
all major races Imperiumwide, and for common minor races in a sector, and for 
uncommon ditto within a subsector (unless the race in question is planetbound).

  Dose control removes the danger of overdose. It is an add-on that multiplies
the cost of the tranq by two and available on TL11 and up (\'?\' for the TL). It
also removes the chance of too low a dose for beings with very large masses.

  Cocktail has guaranteed effect for less than a dozen races, and unpredictable 
on all others. Most versions sold encompass the major races and a few local
ones. It\'s cost-multiplier is 3 and it\'s TL 13 (or 14?).

  And finally, Broadspectrum has guaranteed effect on one metabolic system and
a straight 30%+ chance of working on other metabolic systems. It is only
available on TL 15 (TL16 for percentages over 50%) and it\'s cost is based on
the percentage of effectiveness. The multiplier is 3 plus one for each 10% over
30% (maximum percentage is 90%). Against beings originating on planets with
atmosphere-codes 0-1 and A+ it has lower chance of working: -50% for 0, 
- -30% for 1, -30% for A, -50% for B and -80% for C. Add Referee-imposed
penalties to taste.

  In this system, people could walk in to a gun-shop and buy, for example,
"Dosecontrol, Cocktail against all major, Ael-Yael, Prt\' and Newts, 
 Broadspectrum 90% agains the rest"...
  ...if they were on TL16 and were willing to shell out for something that costs
54 times what normal \'dumb\' tranq costs.

  And then we had the normal multipliers for tranq-gas, persistent or non-
persistent, and with different ability to prenetrate masks and mopp-suits, and
all that:)

  (As for the PBEM, I suggest that the tranq carried is Dosecontrol, Cocktail
against all majors and those local to Hinterworlds, and Broadspectrum 30%.)

  However, the Swedish AF uses metrics even on the altimeters, while the civil
aviation uses feets and stuff.

  An interesting side-effect of this is that some of the SK-60 jet-trainers
that are cleared to land on civilian fields have two altimeters, one in meters
and one in feets....

  (A friend in the terminal room claims that Saab uses metrics in it\'s aviation
sector too, which I cannot confirm. I have however seen construction drawings
for a/c\'s built by Saab done in metrics..)

  One can get the *correct* values for the weight mod column by dividing the
weight mod by the hardness mod. The reason why wood then will seem to weigh 
much more than steel, is that to get a equal level of protection you\'ll have
to have much more wood, since the wood is so much softer.

 T.MCINNES2 [T.MCINNES2]      at 09:48 EDT

James Kundert had some questions about Wet Navy Part # in  Challenge #53.  Here
are the answers plus a copy of a  letter to GDW requesting an errata to correct
some  typographical errors in the published copy

James,
 At last, a moment to respond to your bulletin board item.
 Page 22:  Yes, Diesel engines have no scale efficiency, and steam engines one
scale efficiency.
 Page 22-23  Its a ratio (in all cases, not just MHD tunnel drives) of weight
to meters in diameter and volume (in kiloliters) to meters in diameter,
although volume is not necessary except in tunnel drive systems.  Would have
loved to include an example but space was tight, extremely tight.
 Page 23- Sails:   50% of the mast height is the total yardarm span limit.
 You\'re right about the maximum fore and aft sail area. Although, further
testing suggests this may be too limiting.  It doesn\'t allow for very large
jibs, for instance.
 Page 24, the sail power table-- Yep, you\'re right, I should have included a
kg/meter column to make the transition easier.
 Page 24, the formulae: V2should beV squared.  The R formula  should be R= sqrt
(D)* rf (theresistance factor from the hull type  table.)
 Page 25, Superstructures:  That\'s an abbreviated version of the hull damage
point calc, only determining the destroyed level because I don\'t think you can
render a superstructure inoperable, but you sure can destroy it.  It relates to
combat rules and hit location tables yet to come, Michelle and Challenge
readers willing.

 As information, hereis the text of the letter I sent to Michelle  after
reading thePart 1 galley proofs:

 "Dear Michelle:
 I received the galley proofs for Wet Navy Part 1 yesterday afternoon and
checked them this morning.  I found a couple of areas where changes were needed
and tried to phone you at the office this morning.  However, the person I spoke
with said Challenge #53 was at the printers.
 These are the changes that are needed:
 Page 19, first paragraph:  You had changed the copy to read "Select a hull
size from the UCP column in the MegaTraveller basic hull design section of the
Small Craft Hull Table..."  This is incorrect, you can select a hull size from
any of the three hull size tables in the basic hull design section.  Wet
Vessels can be (and often are) as large as starships.
 Page 19, third paragraph:  "MegaTraveller Small Craft Hull Table."  Again, any
of the three tables can be used.
 Page 21 "Powered Ships" section third paragraph beginning "Calculate Hull
Resistance: Use the formula R=CDxrf..."  the formula should read R=(sqrt
(D))*rf.  The parentheses were  dropped. These are needed to make sure that
only the square root of D is extracted then multiplied by rf when calculating
R.  Otherwise a reader may multiply D times rf then extract the square root of
result which is incorrect.
 Page 23  "Sail Area" section, second paragraph, third sentence beginning "
Maximum mast height..."  Should read "Maximum mast height in meters equals the
square root of a hull\'s volume in kiloliters."; inserting "hull\'s" between "a"
and "volume".
 Page 24  The potential speed formula is incorrect.  You have it as V2=P2/R.
It should be V2=P2/R, that is V squared = (P*2)/R.

 (For clarification:  The power formula is P = R(V squared)/2. The velocity
formula is V Squared = (P times 2)/ R.)

 Page 24  The resistance formula is missing its parentheses. Should be R=(sqrt
(D)) * rf.  See my comments above.
 If at all possible, please publish at least the errata concerning the formulae
in Challenge #54.  If readers use the formulae as stated in #53 they will get
incorrect results.  Thanks in advance,
       Terry McInnes"

  My \'little\' problem is that, suddenly, this has stopped working. No matter how
hard I try no postscript file appear. And if I can\'t make it work I have no
way of distributing any deckplan files...

  Now, I know that I had several long email conversations with people on the 
TML about how this was done, and I even mailed the PD program to someone 
togeather with instructions on how to make the mac produce postscript files.

  I\'d like to get in touch with that person (whos name I\'ve forgotten:( or
anyone else who knows how to make a mac produce postscript. Since I\'ve forgotten
exactly how I did it I cannot determine if it is the computer that behaves
contrarywise or just that I\'m doing it wrong.

Thanks, but you\'re WRONG! My birthday was YESTERDAY, October 28.  I am
of the 1965 vintage.  Besides, the next quarter century I want to spend
on Regina. :-P

AW, C\'MON! GIVE ME A BREAK!!! I did it because I loved Traveller and
wanted to know if it was dead yet, after I came back from college life.
Boy, was I mistaken.  289 TML subscribers?! I also didn\'t expect for the
list to grow into a social, world-spanning community.  People have met
new friends through the TML who have helped them through difficult as
well as happy times.  I count that as the biggest reward of the creation
of the TML.

Wise of you to do this.  I would have nuked it if it had been sent only
to the TML.  Glennis put you up to this, didn\'t she??? :-)

I\'ve just checked the program and assuming that shorts are 16 bit and longs
are 32 (and chars are 8 and doubles are 64).  The database is 1751 lines long
(excluding both blank lines and comments) and each line will expand to
166/168 bytes (depending upon alignment problems).  This is something \'round
about 300k which should easily fit into your available memory.  The only
other problems that might arise are due to the wonderful segmentation present
on certain intel processors.  Have you declared the table pointer to be of
type FAR *?  Are you calling the version of malloc/realloc that gets passed
a 32 bit (man sized) integer size argument?

The table is far larger than the 64k available in a single segment so you MUST
compile using a large memory model, but sometimes that isn\'t enough...you might
have to have to go to a special memory model that supports objects bigger than
64k [ I don\'t remember what silly name is used for this model, it has been a
while since I was programming on a MSDOS machine ].

Another way to reduce the memory usage would be to change the definition of
REAL so it is float not double, this will reduce the memory used by each record
to a more manageable level of 114/116 bytes (about 200k now).  Stripping the
database is also possible, all the supa-tech stuff (TL>15) could be removed as
could a lot of the \'useless\' sensors and quite a lot of the weaponary related
stuff.  In the comments in the database you will see a way to change the turret
allocations so that individual weapons not turrets are allocated this will save
a fair bit of space.  A final way to reduce the memory usage would be to reduce
the length of the name field in the table (50 chars is a big excessive), you
could figure out the longest name and use that size or reduce the name lengths
throughout the file.  

If you have any problems with any of the above, contact me and I\'ll try to help
out.  I\'d also be interested in seeing any changes you have to make to the
program to get it working on a yukky machine (not that I am biassed or
anything :-)

Sea League Model 135 Scout Sled TL9

     The Model 135 is produced locally by the Sea League (Overnale) from a 
standard Imperial Data Package.  Intended for reconnaissance and patrol du-
ties, it can carry a total of five crew members for situations which might 
requirement the capability to dismount a foot patrol.  
     Like all grav vehicles, the Model 135\'s performance is fairly sensitive 
to weight changes.  Unloading half of the fuel, all of the 4cm ammunition and 
all cargo gives the craft 1.5Gs of useful thrust, allowing speeds of up to 
1680kph.

Light Passenger Flyer TL9

     This vehicle can be built from readily available standard data packages, 
and is assembled locally on innumerable TL9 planets under a variety of trade-
names, usually associated with the concept of speed.  It is intended for 
rapid transportation of people, and has a very limited cargo capacity in 
order to keep the weight down (and the speed up.)  Because the controls and 
sensors are simple, and no capability for remote automatic handling by a 
traffic network is included, most planets and governments require some sort 
of pilot\'s license before allowing operation of this class of vehicle.

Buffalo Light Track TL8

     The Buffalo is a common small tracked vehicle which can be produced from 
a readily available Imperial Data Package.  It provides a basic offroad cargo 
and passenger transport capability at a fairly low price.  The high fuel 
efficiency MHD turbine power plant helps to keep operating costs down.  The 
Buffalo is frequently modified, with common modifications including addition 
of folding seats for the cargo compartment, removal or downsizing of passen-
ger seats (for added cargo space), addition of extra fuel tanks, and addition 
of dozer blades, light cranes and similar pieces of equipment,

In principle 7 1/2 E to 7 1/2 W, but the desire to have all of a
country share the same time (unless the country is real big) makes for
some strange twists. Spain, which is practically directly below the
British Isles, nevertheless keeps to CET (that\'s zone +1), while
Portugal keeps GMT (zone 0). The bit of western Africa that pokes into
zone -1 keeps GMT too. Iceland, which is practically all in zone -1
(with a little bit poking into zone -2) strangely enough keeps GMT too.
All of Norway keeps CET, even the bit which is directly above Finland.
Finland keeps Eastern European (zone +2), as does the Balkans, but
Germany, Austria and Poland keeps CET, which meant that when you cross
into Russia you jump two hours, from +1 to +3. China sticks to one time
for the whole country despite straddling thrree timezones.

Rumor Central
 
Perhaps this is old news to everyone here; if so, I apologise for the wasted
bandwidth.  However, it was news to me ...
 
Yesterday (Tuesday the 29th) I called GDW, and in the course of my conversation
with their phone-answering person (whose name I did not have the presence of
mind to ask for), he mentioned that I ought to submit a written proposal, but
he didn\'t know to whose attention it should be marked, because "Marc Miller
handles that now, but he will be leaving us soon, and I don\'t know who is going
to take over".  I *DID* have the presence of mind to ask where Marc was going;
the answer was "He will be starting his own company".  When I asked what he
will be doing, I was told "I really shouldn\'t say, but it is not game-related. 
It is not a game company".  So, I wonder what this means to Traveller, and what
Marc will be doing at his new company ...
 
 
More Rumors
 
Recently, someone asked what was going on at DGP.  In a conversation with the
sales clerk at Dream Wizards (one of the local gaming stores; good selection,
list prices or a little higher), I asked if the Solomani/Aslan module was out
yet.  There was a pause while he asked Tom Peters (yes, the same Tom Peters
that is a Technical Editor for DGP), who also happens to work at Dream Wizards.
 There was maniacal laughter.  And no idea when it would be on the shelves (its
been in the "Real Soon Now" stage for a couple of months now).
 
About a month ago, I sent them a big envelope with a bunch of things in it. 
There was a request for the current MegaTraveller Errata (so that I could
compare it to the GDW MegaTraveller Errata; yes, the two differ).  I also asked
for a copy of the updated Domain of Deneb stats, and provided a *HUGE* envelope
with *LOTS* of postage, clearly labelled "Errata and DoD Stats".  I also sent a
rather long letter in which I described what I wanted and asked a rather large
lot of questions and pointed out some suspected  errata.  I also enclosed a
small envelope with a more reasonable amount of  postage on it, labelled
"Answers to Questions", in case anyone at DGP felt  like scrawling brief
answers on my letter and sending it back to me.
 
I got back two copies of the MegaTraveller Errata, one in the large envelope,
and one in the small envelope.  On the back of the small envelope was a hastily
scribbled message from Patty Fugate, wondering if I was the same long-lost Guy
Garnett that she had once met at Origins (yes, I am). At least I know that
someone read some part of what I sent ...
 
 
CARP and the LIBRARY Program
 
I FTP\'d Jo Jaquinta\'s LIBRARY program and have had a chance to play with it for
a few hours.  It does quite a few very impressive things (well done, Jo!)
Although I haven\'t tried it in a gaming session (I can\'t find anyone in the 
Washington DC area who wants to play Traveller) I have some doubts as to its
utility as an on-line referee\'s aid.  Please note (especially Jo!) that these
items reflect my own predjudices at least as much as anything else.
 
First off, there seems to be no easy way to edit or alter the details that the
program generates for you; as a referee, I would want to be able to do this in
order to tailor a world to my universe or the current plotline.  I\'ve been
known to vary the published UWP stats for the Spinward Marches by up to +/- 2
points.  (Oh, Crumbs!  He changed the Law Level.  Be quiet, Penfold!)
 
More minor quibbles include the terse sector and sub-sector displays; picking
the subsector or world that I was interested in became quite a challenge at
times (especially at that stage where I had only half of the subsectors named).
 A better way to do this one would be to make a way to "walk" the subsector map
and display the mainworld stats.  Pressing <ENTER> on the subsector display
would then call up the system stats display.  Trying to figure out system names
from the first four letters, and then typing in the hex location, is for the
birds!  (Right, DM?  Good Grief, Yes!)
 
 
Those Frigates
 
Ameer is right; I neglected to compute agility reductions for the Black Globe. 
However, I did include the globe\'s protection in calculating damage to the
target craft.
 
Personally, I\'ve never thought much of Traveller\'s treatment of Globe Screens. 
If the globe can be flickered, it should be possible to synchronize it with the
firing of the spinal mount.  I doubt it would be feasable to synchronize the
flicker to the firing of all the mounts on the ship, though.  On the other
hand, it should be possible to arrange the firing of pulse lasers and plasma
and fusion guns to coincide with flicker (in other words, synch some of the
weapons to the globe, rather than synch the globe to the weapons).
 
One change which should be made to the frigates is to re-organize the laser
batteries.  If you use the standard rules, batteries cannot be reconfigured
except by overhauling the ship.  Therefore, the batteries should be organized
for maximum UCP factor; change the UCP rating of the lasers to "xx9" and divide
the number of batteries and batteries bearing by 10 (round fractions up).  If
whoever collects such things would like a corrected UCP, I would be happy to
send them out; otherwise I won\'t waste the bandwidth (I waste enough as it is).
 
I didn\'t manage to install a factor-9 meson screen on a sub-10,000-ton ship and
still manage to install jump drives, maneuver drives, a spinal weapon of at
least mid-size, agility-6, and at least 15 days endurance.  If you have such a
design, I would like to see it; there is still a good chance that there are
bugs in my spreadsheet.
 
Designing battleriders or system-defense montors (in both cases, they are
non-starships; typically large craft) is another matter entirely.  Without the
expense of a jump drive (and the volume of its required fuel), the ship can be
smaller and more cost-effective.
 
The battleships-vs-battleriders debate can be an interesting subject; which one
is superior depends a lot more on long-range tactical and strategic  concerns
than anything else.  The best possible tactics a battleship can use when faced
with battleriders is to disengage by jumping.  If this is not possible,
threaten the carrier and do as much damage as possible before they get you. 
For riders agains a battleship, try to inflict as much damage as possible
before they jump out, and keep as much distance as possible between the enemy
and your carriers (its a long way to walk home ...).
 
 
The Attraction of Odd Tech Levels
 
Tech Levels 13 and 15 are very attractive for starship designs because the
break points for fusion power plants fall at these tech levels.  The size and
fuel consumption of the power plant being one of the driving factors in many
ship designs.  In addition, turreted laser and missile systems have a break
point at TL 13.  Other factors have breakpoints at other tech levels (for
example, hulls at TLs 12 and 14) but these are typically of less impact on the
final design of the ship.
 
>From a cost-efficency standpoint, it is usually more effective to design a ship
to the lowest TL where the required equipment can be had.  This is mostly due
to the (rather silly, in my opinion) way in which the Control Points are
calculated (CP = MCrPrice * 10 * TL).  Higher tech items have higher control
requirements, and therefore require bigger computers, more control panels, and
more crew.
 
 
Porting Programs
 
When porting programs to MsDOS, my company has occasionally had a problem with
a memory allocation routine in either Microsoft C or inherent in MsDOS (I am
not really sure which, because I don\'t work on that project).  The problem
manifests itself as an inability to allocate a relatively large memory block,
even though there *SHOULD* be enough free memory to satisfy the request.  In
our case, the problem turned out to be fragmentation; enough free memory was
available, but no piece was big enough to satisfy the request.  Somewhere, the
memory manager  was neglecting to join together adjacent pieces of free memory
as they were being freed.  The work-around was to either 1) allocate all of the
required memory all at once, in the beginning of the program, or 2) play some
kind of tricks on the memory management system, to force it to join the free
blocks together (which I am not very clear on; the technique had something to
do with allocating a small block and then extending it to the required size).
 
My vehicle design system is based on a Quattro Pro spreadsheet (which can also
be saved in a variety of other formats; I used a least-common-denominator
approach) and will run on just about any platform that will run Quattro Pro. 
It has been successfully tested in QPro and Lotus on a 2-Mb AT, and has also
worked on a 640k PC-XT (very slow, and with lots of disk I/O, but it worked). 
If anybody wants it, I could always ZIP it up, and upload it to Sunbane.  There
is no documentation (yet), but you can always try to figure things out.
 
 
A Destroyer to go with the Frigates
 
This is an escort ship to accompany the frigate designs posted earlier.  The
ships were designed by the same naval architect, and have been designed with
maximum commonality in mind.  Both vessels use identical computer, sensor, and
communications suites, and have an extrordinarily flexable data-link package. 
Many minor parts, from lighting panels to circuit junction boxes and even crew
quaters modules are also identical.  This commonality helps to ease
maintainance and supply problems.  As always, comments and critizism are
appreciated (and may even be heeded); pay special attention for evidence of
errors in the design - I still don\'t trust the spreadsheet.

Dragon Heavy Attack Helicopter TL9

     The Dragon heavy attack helicopter is a typical example of pregravitic 
battlefield aviation.  Equipped to carry a heavy ordnance load as well as 
twelve fully loaded infantrymen, it is ideal for airmobile operations in 
areas of low to moderate antiaircraft threat.  A full suite of sensor systems 
allows easy night operations.  The ladar system can be used for target desig-
nation (particularly for the missile armament) as well as for search pur-
poses.

Transtar-27 Speeder TL14

       The Transtar-27 is a very popular speeder design, frequently found as 
an auxiliary craft aboard scout and merchant vessels.  Originally designed by 
the Transtar Company of Trin, the design has since been licensed across the 
Domain of Deneb.  There are no particularly unusual design features exhibited 
in the Transtar-27. A full sensor array and computer control system allow 
integration with planetary traffic networks, and two of the seating positions 
are suitable for extended occupation.  A full environmental array also con-
tributes to passenger comfort.

Nighthawk Medium Attack Helicopter TL8

     The Nighthawk helicopter is capable of providing rapid reaction to enemy 
movements on the battlefield.  It is equipped with a rapid fire cannon, and 
ordinarily carries both precision guided and area effect munitions. It would 
usually operate in conjunction with scout and transport helicopters as part 
of an integrated airmobile operation, but is also frequently employed as 
"flying artillery" in enemy rear areas, and in support of troops beyond the 
range of conventional artillery.

Nightowl Medium Transport Helicopter TL8

     The Nightowl is based on the Nighthawk attack helicopter airframe.  It 
is intended to provide rapid transport of troops in reaction to enemy move-
ments on the battlefield.  The Nightowl carries two machine guns in flexible 
mounts at the side doors, and has the capability of carrying two rocket pods 
for prelanding suppressive fires.  It would ordinarily be accompanied attack 
helicopters as part of an integrated airmobile operation.

Hunter Self Propelled AA Gun TL7

     The Hunter can be built from a standard Imperial Data Package, and is 
intended to serve in an air defense role in armored units.  It is equipped 
with an all weather targeting radar, and a sealed environment life support

fire of the 4cm autocannon can use up the onboard ammunition supply rapidly, 
and a Hunter in the field is frequently accompanied by a dedicated armored 
ammunition carrier.  Operational Hunters are frequently modified to carry 
smoke grenade launchers and commander\'s machine guns.

Basil class Free Trader TL12

     The Basil class Free Trader is a modified Type A design, with an upgrad-
ed maneuver drive (to allow take off and landing on most planets while load-
ed), an armament package, and a reduced accommodation set.  The Basil is 
fairly typical of craft being built during the current Imperial difficulties.  
Two dual turrets are installed, one with two beam lasers, the other with a 
missile rack and a sandcaster.  No dedicated missile magazine has been pro-
vided, so missiles must be carried in the cargo hold.  Firing both lasers 
requires the full power ordinarily used for the maneuver drives and the iner-
tial compensators.

                                      or 
         A few thoughts, questions and comments on being a Traveller 
             referee, particularly as related to my recent game.

1. Background:  A few months ago, TML readers will recall that I was starting 
out a (Mega)Traveller game at my local game store, with several goals in mind: 
giving Traveller more exposure, having fun by using some of the planning I\'ve 
labored over for so long, and potentially recruiting a few good players for 
some even more esoteric role-playing-heavy games that I\'d like to run someday.  
Metlay once posted an excellent note about why one should never try running a 
store game, but I ignored him and went ahead anyway.

2. The Game: The game was supposed to be freeform.  I dislike completely 
linear adventures, so when only two people (both of whom I had requested to 
show up) arrived for the first gaming session, I had them generate their 
characters.  Since they turned out to be a Scout and a scientist, with a scout 
ship for transport, I asked them about how they knew each other, and we gener-
ally brainstormed for a little while about what sort of campaign we wanted to 
play.  It was finally decided that these were two brothers-in law who were 
seeking vengeance against the Sword Worlds for the death of their sister/wife 
(respectively).  Since their scout was unarmed (I give out the no-frills 
version), they decided that their first goal was to get some money and buy 
some weapons for the ship.  So far so good.  End of week 1.  By the time the 
second week rolled around, I had rolled up a number of prepared characters, 
since I know that this aspect of Traveller is intimidating to a lot of poten-
tial new players.  Two new players arrived, and the ship departed from Glisten 
with a load of soft drink mix, bound for a poor, industrial planet.  Now, we 
all know that the trade system in MegaTraveller is broke, so I didn\'t want to 
burden the players with the detail needlessly.  Upon arrival, they delegated 
the action to one of the new players, playing a merchant.  He attempted to 
bribe the officials there, and barely avoided arrest.  He traded the soft 
drinks for two armored cars.  After much deliberation, it was decided that 
they should take the armored cars to the nearest equivalent tech level planet 
with a war going on.  (Overnale).  The crew was also given the opportunity to 
carry a scientist and a one ton container of fish in cold sleep to Overnale, 
which they accepted.  They made no particular inquiries regarding the nature 
of the fish.  Upon their arrival, the player who had done the trade departed, 
not to return, and a new player who would last until the recent end of the 
game (another merchant) was added.  The fish were unloaded and the scientist 
disappeared--it had all been part of a plot to assassinate the head of the 
local government.  While the wheels of the plot were turning, the players sold 
the armored cars, and discovered that the local economy was tightly con-
trolled.  There was no free exchange of the local currency with Imperial 
money.  However, they developed a plan to deal with their currency surplus by 
harvesting wood (yes--I got this bit from the Traveller Adventure).  About 
then, the assassination attempt succeeded.  The players were implicated, and 
they were hauled off to jail for questioning.  Then a coup/civil war broke 
out.  Two new players showed up one week, and I had ended the previous week 
with our heroes sitting in jail.  So, I threw them into the adjacent cell with 
nothing but the clothes on their back and told them to escape.  (This was the 
week where one of the new people asked me where I had bought the module we 
were playing.)  They broke out (the guards were distracted by an attack on the 
building related to the coup), and made their way back to the starport in the 
garbage truck, an incident alluded to on the TML.  As they arrived at the 
port, their ship took off to avoid combat, and they huddled in the terminal 
with ther rest of the refugees.  When things calmed down a few hours later, a 
friendly free trader captain gave them a lift up to their ship.  Now they had 
no money except the worthless local currency (balkanized world) and had to 
land at the planet\'s other starport for fuel and supplies.  They managed to 
pick up a load of fish, and the merchant player accepted an offer to carry a 
load of submachine guns illegally hidden in the fish.  The new players who had 
escaped from prison disappeared, never to be seen again.  Customs found and 
impounded the machine guns, and they avoided arrest only because their ship 
was impressed back into the scout service due to the tension preceding the 
opening of the Fifth Frontier War.  They proceeded to Glisten, and we added a 
new player, who was home from school for the summer, but was a Traveller 
enthusiast.  After their ship was partially refitted (weapons, etc.) they were 
sent on a long trip to deliver a load of parts needed for the completion of a 
spy ship to be sent into enemy territory.  Since the local commander had no 
better personnel available, they became the crew of that ship (the Curious 
George, details uploaded to the TML previously) and set off looking for a 
Collace battlecruiser to scan.  Several jumps later, they came to a planet 
occupied by one of the potential enemy worlds.  A few new players had showed 
up, and they delegated one to go and talk to the port authorities about get-
ting permission to do an ocean refueling.  (I should mention that the C.G. had 
a Model 9 computer and an extremely advanced sensor array hidden in a portion 
of the fuel tankage.)  The new player (who was never to be seen again), went  
to the office and found that the civilian authorities had been replaced by low 
level naval officers of the occupiers.  Naval officer: "No.  No permission to 
be granted for a time before 10 days from now.  We\'re far too busy here, and 
they don\'t pay us enough to retain enough extra personnel to do all the work."  
Player: "Well.  If we take off without enough fuel, we just might crash on 
your city."  Result: A safety inspection team come to look at the fuel tanks.  
Was I too subtle with the officer?  This delayed the players for a number of 
game days.  By the time they reached Collace, the war had already begun.  
Posing as neutrals, they acquired their data and did some trading.  On the way 
back, they ended up spending three extra weeks in jumps into and back from a 
system that they had already heard was occupied by the enemy.  So they de-
toured.  In that detour they encountered an enemy privateer in the Pagaton 
system (TL4 planet undergoing an ice age).  We fought it out.  The Model 9 
computer made it a massacre for the privateer, but they luckily blew the power 
plant out in the George.  With two portable fusion plants (each 3MW) jury-
rigged to the maneuver system they overtook the ballistic remnants of a space 
fighter and salvaged its power plant.  They no longer had the hull integrity 
needed for a gas giant refueling, so they proceeded for the planet.  Between 
sessions, I started working out the planet details.  The privateer, byt the 
way, had jumped for its base to end the combat.  One week out, one week back 
for reinforcements.  The new privateer ships arrived just before the George 
landed.  Not wishing to get involved in any local entanglements of any sort 
(sigh), the players decided to sit, powered down, on the ice cap for six weeks 
until the privateers gave up and went away.  In the meantime, Glisten  had 
fallen, called on its fleets to surrender, and had the chief admiral rebel and 
take the fleet to attack Collace.  By the time the George reached Imperial 
space again, Glisten had been liberated and Collace had surrendered.  They 
sold the cover cargo and the salvaged goods from their space fight and were 
awarded with most of the proceeds by the Prize Court.  There the game now 
sits, waiting for their next Fifth Frontier War mission.

3. Problems:  No new player who ever showed up stayed for more than one ses-
sion of the game.  It was getting to be a standing joke, about clearing the 
ship of the accumulated NPCs every couple of weeks.  Why not?  Is my referee-
ing style that horrible?  Maybe.  Maybe they just don\'t like Traveller. Popu-
lar systems for play at the store have included D&D/AD&D, Paranoia, Call of 
Cthulhu and Cyberpunk.  I don\'t run a combat heavy game, and after a couple of 
warning about how dangerous fighting was likely to be (which the permanent 
players took to heart, and lectured newcomers about) the only fight in four or 
more months of play was the space battle with the privateer.  I always felt 
like I was leading players around by the nose--without direct orders from the 
Imperial Navy, not much was happening.  No matter how much information or how 
many opportunities they were given, they always managed to avoid doing any-
thing I had prepared for.  "Obviously" bad situations, like the gun smuggling 
one, were entered into voluntarily by the players.  Little actual role-playing 
occurred.  The task system is pretty good for resolving things inside a role-
playing situation, but just rolling for tasks makes for a very dry game.

Comments:  Without self-directed players, running an open ended game of Tra-
veller can be very difficult.  The number of people interested in SF rpgs vs. 
the number interested in fantasy rpgs seems to be very small.

So, what did I do wrong?  How does the structure of the overall game, as it 
occurred, sound to people?  What should I do differently?  What sorts of 
Traveller games are other people running at the moment?

  I agree that that is the logical answer, but I remember either the Starship
OpMan or Grand Survey claiming that artificial grav inside a ship falls off
*faster* than normal gravitation.

  Ignoring the possibility that this is the result of some \'blackbox doubletalk\'
the best explanation (IMHO) is that starship hulls are grav-shielded similarly
to densitometers to keep the artificial grav inside them to prevent it from 
messing up the environment.

	I\'ve had another idea that might be causing problems with the
design program.  To stop the program allocating and reallocating lots
of memory while loading the database, try the following:

in the file read_tbl.c at about line number 26 change
	#define INIT_ALLOC 500
to
	#define INIT_ALLOC 2000

This will cause the program to allocate enough space for the entire database at
startup.  The table will never fill up and thus, it won\'t have to be
reallocated ever.  By default the table is expanded 100 entries at a time. The
table ends up over 1700 entries long, so a dumb memory allocator is going to
desire enough space for 3500 entries which is going to come awfully close to
filling up the 640k the machine has available (after the space for the program
is accounted for, it will fill memory easily).

    'body' => 'Your \'campaign\' sounded like it was pretty well thought out, at least to the
short- and mid-term.  Granted, it\'s extremely difficult to have any sort of
long-term plot when you don\'t have a group of consistent players.  However,
you asked for suggestions, not back-slapping.

Suggestion 1:  Try to develop some sort of unifying thread

You started out well, with the brothers-in-law searching out the assassin of
their wife/sister.  What I might have done in your campaign, had I been the
ref, is allow them to find the murderer a lot faster than what happened.  They
should have been on the assassin\'s tail by the second adventure, or the third
at the VERY latest.  Let them meet the assassin.  Let the assassin try to kill
them.  Get them scared.  Then, when they finally do catch up to the assassin,
let them capture/kill him.  (This should be done by the next adventure session
after they meet him.)  [My assumption on session run-time:  3-4 hours each].
Then, once they think they\'ve gotten to the bottom of this little enigma, give
them another.  (i.e.  The assassin was actually just a cog in some greater
conspiracy that the wife/sister stumbled upon somehow.  Now the party is
privvy to what she knew and have become the grand villan\'s newest target.)
The ultimate objective should be to track down the grand villan, corner
him/her, and bring him/her to whatever kind of justice seems appropriate.
Three out of every four adventures should have something to do with the grand
villan (in one way or another).  The fourth adventure should be diversionary
and unrelated.  (i.e. getting caught in the coup, becoming implicated in your
assassination attempt of that government official, etc.)  If your adventures
are planned out carefully, the players should become a touch paranoid that
*everything* that goes wrong in their lives has some connection to the grand
villan (once they\'ve identified who this villan is).  Of course, only you will
ever know for sure until the very end.

Suggestion 2: Give them what they want.

The hobby shop where you started this open-ended campaign, according to you,
has a predisposition towards action/violence.  Fine, you tell them that in
Traveller, combat is extremely dangerous.  Then, to make your point stick, you
show them.  They want a fight, you give it to them.  Let them use all their
neat-o weapons.  Let them use their armor...a lot.  Then, make sure they
escape from death if things are going badly for them... the first time.  After
that, if they haven\'t learned their lesson, let them die.  Depriving them of
the action they crave, however, is a sure recepie for loss of interest.  Plus,
you can give them action via unarmed combat, too.  (And car chases!  Don\'t
forget the car chases!)

Suggestion 3:  Brave heart.

Get an exciting, interlaced, fluid adventure and the players will come.  They
will stay with it, too.  The few you might lose will keep things moving.  But
whatever you do, keep it fun and keep it going!

Hello,
this is my first appearance to the TML and I want to thank those
of you, who replied to my posting in rec.games.frp and told me
that the TML excists.

Since I got the Errata, many questions I had concerning the rules
disappeared, but some are still alive.

1. How does "gyro-stabilization" work, and why are laser rifles not
   gyro-stabilized?

2. Tasks excist for combat between people. What about animals,
   regarding the fact that they do not have a UPP and skills?
   Of course, I could improvise, but maybe some of you worked out
   some convincing rules.

3. This one is about the background:
   I recently refereed a very old Amber Zone named "Rescue on Ruie",
   which I found in The Best of the Journal Vol. 1. It is stated
   there that Sergei hault-Oberlindes is the son of Marc hault-
   Oberlindes, owner of Oberlindes Lines.
     One of my clever players read the Library Data and told me that
   Sergei must be the owner of OL.
     So what went wrong here? Unfortunately no current date is given
   for the Amber Zone.

This ship is an experimental fast courier.  The ship is fully supplied and it
then induces a mis-jump.  Once the ship comes out of jump space, it attempts to
identify its current location and to then travel to the nearest system. 
Because of the somewhat random direction of travel, this kind of ship is only
used for news of a general nature, often several such ships will launch at the
same time hoping to reach distinct destinations. The ship carries enough fuel
for three seperate jump-1\'s and six weeks of power plant fuel.  All computers
and controls have ECP backing.  The reason for carrying the three jump-1s is
to increase the survival chance of the ship to a decent level.

As an aside, the probability of the ship surviving each launch is quite
impressive.  Assume the following represents a portion of a hex grid:

              l a b
             k 5 6 c
            j 4 S 1 d
	     i 3 2 e
              h g f

After a mis-jump assume the ship is located at the S in the above diagram.
Since the density of systems in the Traveller universe is about 0.5, this means
that there is a fifty percent chance of already being at a system. If you are
not at a system there is a 63 in 64 chance that you are one hex from a system
(hexes 1..6 in the diagram).  If that fails, there is a 4095 in 4096 chance
that you are two hexes from a system (hexes a..l).  If both of those fail, the
ship can induce a second mis-jump which will move you to a new S hex, which
again has a fifty percent chance of being empty and the six hexes around again
give a 63 in 64 chance of being able to jump there safely.  If this fails the
ship can induce a third and final mis-jump with a fifty percent survival
chance.  Working out the above figures leads to the final survival chance of:

	 -1 -6 -12 -1 -6 -1    -27            -9
	2. 2 .2  .2 .2 .2   = 2    = 7.45 * 10

So you have a 7.45E-9 chance of not locating a system, this gives a
0.999999992549 probability of finding a system (99.9999992549%). I think that
this is slightly better than flying on an airplane, and a lot better than drive
around town.

As for the distance travelled: A mis-jump goes 6d6 hexes in a random direction.
6d6 gives an average distance of (6*3.5=21 hexes) which is quite good.  Most of
the time the destination will be within on hex of a system and this makes the
travel time about two weeks (average of jump-10.5).  If the second jump is
required, this still averages jump-7.  The only problem is that the direction
is not very well known.

Needless to say, this ship isn\'t used very heavily around the low density
regions of space.  You\'d have to be totally insane (or a Vagyr :-) to attempt
this kind of travel near the rift.  Even travelling normally, if the first
mis-jump doesn\'t land you near any systems then you\'ve got some real problems
for your nerves as you induce the second mis-jump (1 in 128 failure chance) and
if that fails then you\'ll be a nervous wreck with an even survival chance! Of
course, having a robot pilot the thing saves a lot of suffering and so on.

Richard,

	Excellent work on the Turn report.  Seeing it all in one place
(er, well, SIX places :-) certainly brought a semblance of order to the
whole process.  I think I\'ve spotted what Nick Sylvain (aka the Aslan
CO) thinks is the weak point in Ralf\'s actions:

> ----
> Aslan Pinnace
> ----
> "Admiral, I respectfully must request that you give me the coordinates 
> of the enemy fleet again.  My feeble sensors cannot distinguish it from 
> the background of deep space."

	I suspect Nick means to use this to discover that the ships were
phantoms.  However, I question the accuracy of this... quoting from my copy
of the story sequence I sent to you:

> 	...and then he was there, in the buffer space at the fringe of
> the Aslan datasphere, watching the interplay between the two ships.  A
> stroke of luck, that.  The telemetry and encrypted communications
> between the two meant they had to be somewhat "open" to incoming
> signals, which in turn meant he had barely enough space for the
> foothold his heuristics package had secured.

	In other words, no, I did not specifically say "I\'m faking out
the sensors of both ships", but that was because I was regarding them
as a whole, not as individual entities, acting under the implied 
statement that my actions were directed at both ships.

Aurora
- ----
Bhyarrvouf, favoring his sore leg, taps out a code deries on the console
before him, humming tunelessly. "Psionics out the poot-hole. Why am I NOT
surprised?" He sighs. "Well, hopefully there won\'t be any more bad--"

"Mayday, Mayday, Mayday this is Scout six eight Alpha Charlie ISS
Bernoulli.  We have one Ael Yael aboard, one dead, explosion aboard.  Jump
Drive out.  Maneuver drive damaged.  We have life support, and fuel for
five zero four hours.  Request assistance.  We have wounded aboard.
Transponder set for double seven double zero.  This is the ISS Bernoulli
broadcasting on one two one point five."

....surprises." \'Vouf scowls furiously. "For a SECRET locale, we\'re seeing an 
AWFUL lot of traffic!"

As the message begins to come in on the distress signal channel,
Christian\'s ears perk up and he listens with quiet intensity to the
remainder of the message, a small furrow of concern creasing his brow. His
hands begin to flow over the controls as he replaces the engineering
monitoring panel with a sensor ops and a communications panel.

With a few touches of his fingertips, he fires up the radio commlink
and briefly transmits a general broadcast. "Tallyho! Aurora responding to
the distress call from ISS Bernoulli -- this one\'s mine. Van Der Merwe out."

"Hey, wait a minute--" \'Vouf interjects weakly.

A few more taps and the maser commlink is locked onto the command
shuttle. "Van Der Merwe to Commander Ger: Considering the medical and
damage control needs of the disabled vessel, it is my conclusion that
it is vital that the Subcommander and I respond. Will keep in touch
with you and advise you of the situation aboard the Bernoulli as soon
as possible. Good luck with first contact. Aurora out."

"I, um..."

Christian glances over at the co-pilot station, where a cast-laden
Bhyarrvouf is uncomfortably settled. "\'Vouf, lay in an intercept course
for the Bernoulli and get the power plant up to full, we\'re going to hit
the drives all out; we need that overdrive edge, time could be critical."
Time for a brief nod of confirmation, and Christian is off to another task.

Bhyarrvouf sighs again, and takes the controls gingerly in his bandaged hands.
"YES, aenrra," he mutters with exaggerated politeness. "At ONCE, aenrra,"
he says, as the bridge suddenly vibrates with the sound of a fusion plant
suddenly being called on for a whole LOT of power. "Whatever you SAY, aenrra!"

While continuing to closely monitor the engineering displays, Christian
gives \'Vouf a sidelong, bemused glance and slowly smiles. "Thank YOU,
aenrra. I am in AWE, aenrra." Christian stifles (barely) a snicker.

The Aurora shudders from stem to stern, and leaps forward in a surge that
overwhelms the inertial compensators for a moment and leaves both men gasping
for breath. As the Aurora does a marginal bit more than its maximum safe rated
acceleration, Bhyarrvouf sings gaily, "My feet are WINGS, aenrra! Your wish is
my COMMAND, aenrra! After all, WHAT THE HELL DO WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT?!"

At the sudden jolt of acceleration, Christian\'s eyes widen and he takes
a few seconds of deep breathing to recover. He listens to \'Vouf\'s complaints
with a straight face (but it is clearly an effort of will) and when \'Vouf
pauses for breath, Christian chimes in without missing a beat.

"Whine, whine, whine! Yer such a complainer, aenrra. I bet that\'s why
Ger put you here; he knew only I could put up with you." Christian
gently laughs, then assumes a mock dramatic pose.

His arms spread wide in supplication, he addresses the ceiling. "Oh
please, sir, can I be rescued? I\'ve onnnly got a teeny bomb in
engineering, half-mangled maneuver drive and dubious life support.
Really, nothing important. Maybe I could have a cup of nutribroth? Never
mind little old me. Oooops!"

He snarls over at van der Merwe with a predator\'s toothy jaws. "\'Oh, help!
Oh, mercy! Whoever will SAVE poor little ME?\'" he mimicks a helpless tri-D
heroine\'s voice. "We\'ll ignore the fact that there\'s a vanishingly small
probability that a Jump-2 scout could have made it here in one piece, and
we\'ll ignore the fact that we\'re supposed to be an auxiliary command post
that can run things without putting Commander Nanadh at risk-- we\'ll even 
ignore the fact that we\'re undermanned and one of us can\'t FIGHT!" He makes
a vicious chopping motion in the air with one hand. "Nope nope nope. No
discipline, no chain of command, no previous orders-- it\'s Captain Cadeuceus
and his faithful pooch Voufie the Wonder-Moron to the rescue, and 
Yaskoydray take the laggards!" He makes a horrible hacking noise, and a wad
of Vargr spit dribbles down the main viewscreen. "Nothing like having
a doctor call the shots, oh joy oh happiness."

His fury spent, he gives a shuddering "Whumph," and begins reconfiguring the
controls, flicking on the comset as he does so. "All ship commanders, this
is SubCommander Bhyarrvouf. Since our Chief Medical Officer has volunteered
us to investigate this hulk and the other ships are too laden with personnel
to risk in a close-in engagement, I\'m taking the Aurora in for a look. Under
no circumstances are the other ships to break formation-- protect the command
shuttle and make for the rendezvous with our, hrrm, HOSTS. We\'ll catch up
once we\'ve determined what the situation is. Paladin, keep your cameras
rolling-- we aren\'t being given much time for telemetry. \'Vouf out."

Unable to restrain himself any longer, Christian\'s reserve fails utterly
and explodes in a cascade of deep laughs and guffaws, continuing for nearly
half a minute, until Christian has to wipe away tears. He quiets down but
still is grinning broadly. "Well Voufie the Wonder-Moron, Captain Cadeuceus
would appreciate it if you would clean up the main viewscreen and stop
dribbling on it, or Captain Cadeuceus just might make you go on a vegetable
puree diet!" He waves his finger in mock anger, then guffaws and gives
\'Vouf a friendly clap on the shoulder.

Then Bhyarrvouf grins at van der Merwe affectionately. "Yer gonna get me killed
one of these days, aenrra," he laughs. "But the inventive methods you cook up
are really something to see!"

Christian grins back at Bhyarrvouf with equal affection. "Hey, aenrra, I
have to keep things interesting; Yaskoydray forbid that things should
ever get boring around me, who knows what you would do!"

Paladin

After storing his gear in his room and feeling satisfied with his
accomodations, Jordan walks through the vessel familiarizing himself
with it. Although no stranger to exploration vessels, he\'s well aware
that many times ships appear the same outside but are totally different
within. After his stroll through the ship, Jourdan then heads for the
bridge where he find \'Zar, Herr Doktor, and Charyn.

Looking over their shoulders, he can see R-Alpha through the viewport
and is amazed at the splendor of it. He then realizes the chatter on
the communication channels and the actions of the Paladin crew and
decided to save his questions for later.


"Paladin crew, this is Robins, Comm status report.  The ether is alive
with a distress signal from a ship called the Bernoulli.  The Aurora
will investigate.

"Local news.  I hope each of you are enjoying the same fine view of the
ringworld that I can see here on the bridge viewscreens and holotank.
Looks like we may be the first ship to get some real work done here.
I\'ve done some initial looking about at some of the survey acquisition
systems and there\'s a sizable pile of data accumulating.  Let me know if
there\'s any particular instrument configurations you\'re interested in
setting up, and I\'ll be glad to accomodate you.  These instruments are
similar to the survey equipment I trained on when I was borrowed for
economic contact by the Scouts.

"I have full EM sweeps running continuously.  If there\'s anything down
there to hear, I\'ll hear it.

"Robins Out."


Charyn turns to Dr.  Morser, the only command team representative aboard
the Paladin.  "May I ask some questions, Doctor? What are our survey
plans prior to landing? How are we planning to select the landing site?
and, to whom will we report now and upon landing?"

Dr. Morser looks up from his wrist comp(look out, Dick Tracy!), somewhat 
startled. You can practically hear the gears grind in his head as he switches
trains of thought...

"Vell, I tink ve should keep ze scanning on a passive level for ze time
beink. Ve haff already rrreceived some sort of communication, ve can only
azzume from ze surface, informing us uf an envoy arrrrriving soon. Ze
message did not zeem hostile, but I vould still prrrefer to keep our
presence from any other life forms on the ringworld until ve are rready
to make contact ourrselves.

"Ve haff no vay uf knowing who has contacted us, but zey are obviously 
intelligent...zey understand ze concept of other civilizations...hmmm..."

He trails off in thought for a moment before realizing that Charyn is
still looking at him.

"Oh yes! Urmm.., I believe ve should begin by checking in mit Kommander 
Ger as to ze currrent situation upstairs...Frau Robins, if you vould be so 
kind as to hail ze command shuttle? 

"As for ze shuttle frrom R-Alpha, tink ve should get an okey-dokey from
Herr Ger before following her, but until zen ve should be doing as
much high-detail mapping as pozzible. Chust in case he vants us to rrun
from ze shuttle, I vant a few isolated, unpopulated, desolated areas to
choose landing sites from."

Talisman

*Welcome...* the telepathic voice rang in Ralf\'s head.  "Ouch."
Damn that felt weird.  Like having your mind\'s teeth cleaned.  Ralf\'s eyes
unfocused as he scanned the communications net of the available dataspheres.
The Alcyon\'s robust datasphere had blossomed out as the ships peeled off,
into multiple dataspheres linked by telemetry and communications.  A sudden
burst in communications and sensor scanning followed the telepathic contact
as crewbeings and expedition personnel reacted.  Ralf piped it through a
sorting algorithm and skimmed the outflow.


- ----
R-alpha
- ----
Katie\'s disappointment at being denied permission to join the First
Contact shuttle quickly fades when she is assigned to investigate the
unexpected V who have apparently already made ringfall near the base. 
A quick visit to the equipment storeroom to check out a skysuit, 
some diagnostic checks, and she\'s off.
 
Once over land, Katie starts scanning the V\'s projected landing
site, starting with the visual and IR spectra (a method that worked
well when monitoring the ring\'s natives).  Sure enough, amidst the
cool snow covering most of the forest is a dispersed IR source, weak
as if camouflaged.  She quickly makes her way over there.
 
 

Ziggy slowly stretched and awoke from his fourth nap of the day
or was it the fifth?  Hoop maitenance was a bother but someone had
to do it. But why me, other than the fact I know how?  Watching the
children was much more fun.  For some reason though, Katie replaced me
and I have to look at Hoopedge.  Blah. Enough time to check on the
kiddies...

When Ziggy arrives to find the kiddies but no Katie, he lets lose a
stream klicks and whistles. Where did she go?  

For the first time in a couple of days Ziggy turns his mind to the
chatter of the Hoop.


In a small clearing leading up to a ridge, Katie finds the source of
the IR reading -- a craft of some sort, definitely not phin.  A 
telepathic scan of the ship\'s inside reveals the presence of a mind
unlike any she has felt before.

"Katie to Phin Base, I\'ve located the craft that followed Doejin\'s
shuttle down.  Continuing with surveillance."

And with that, she begins to run her view of the ship through the
suit\'s sensors.  Further investigations turns up the Kythui camp, 
preparing for their celebration.

"Kythui.  What are they doing ... Oh yeah, this is the place and time
they hold that silly thanksgiving ritual.  


<Ziggy>
"Well I guess thats where Katie is...Great the Visitors come and I\'m
playing games with machines.  Ziggy ports for the main phin base, and
hopes he\'s not to  late to join in the fun.


- ----
Phin Shuttle
- ----
In the shuttle, Ferdy is agitated.  He keeps asking Doejin, "Are we
nearly there yet?"... "How are we going to dock with them?"... "What
are they doing at the moment?"... and so on.
 

Doejin concentrates on the instuments in front (and to the side and back) of
him.  Ferdy\'s questions go unanswered except for the visualization on the
2d screen and holo screens.

The entrance of another ship is completely unexpected and has Doejin confused.
Curiosity pulls in all directions...the shuttles coming toward him and the
ring, the shuttle veering off toward the distressed vehicle, the main large
ship (the Alcyon) which is among the strangest contraptions that have ever
been seen!  But obviously Ferdy is intent on original grouping of ships.

With telepathic irritation (uncommon for any Phin), Doejin asks ferdy to calm
down and help with some of the passive and active scans (he\'s been hanging
around the control centers enough to have learned something! :-)

In between these spates of questions, he swims back and forth
nervously, muttering to himself "He\'s back... HE\'s back... What does
he want to talk to me about?... I did what he asked... I kept quiet...
Why is he here now?"


- ----
R-alpha
- ----
Ah!  Dawn brings a fresh, harsh sunlight into the great clearing.
It is a good day for a celebration, thinks Rak.  Clear skies
overhead, fine soft snow underfoot, faint animal noises from deep
within the surrounding forests.  It is cold, but it is a wholesome
sort of cold -- the sort of cold that invigorates the spirit.  The
air smells fresh... except...
 
Rak raises his nose to the wind and sniffs.  Something is not right.
There is a smell he does not recognise -- some kind of strange
animal lurking in the distance, perhaps?
 
He thinks no more of it.  Whatever it is cannot possibly be a match
for the vast numbers of Kythui who are gathered together today.  On
any other day, most of these tribes would have been at each others
throats.  The mottled Gorthui, for example, hold little love for
Rak\'s Shalgui tribe.  But today, on this day of special celebration,
there will be peace.  Probably.
 

Cleverly concealed with his crew on the high ridge overlooking the
clearing, Akhouw likewise breathes in the cold, crisp air and gives
his mane a gleeful shake. Vast possibilities for information, giving
the Khaukeairl clan a vital edge over the other members of the Tlakhu,
plus the potential for land and ihatei colonization. Akhouw favors the
new dawn with a toothy grin; with a short growl he picks up his PRIS
binoculars and closely surveys the gathered throng, considering how
contact should be made.

 
While continuing the passive scans, Katie notices more heat sources 
up at the top of the ridge.  She quickly does a passive scan of the 
top of the ridge and picks up some more V up there.
 

Rak rides through the middle of the throng, resplendent in his
ceremonial battle regalia.  With no little smugness he notes that
the gara he is mounted upon is probably the biggest in the whole
assembly.  It makes him feel duly important.  Kythui in his path
are only too eager to scramble out of his way as he passes.
 
Rak spots a huge ornamental headdress in the distance and steers
his gara towards it.  That will be Mrog, who, together with the
shamans of the other tribes, are preparing themselves to incant
the rituals which give thanks for victory over hardship.
 
"Mrog!" calls Rak over the heads of the crowd.  "Are you ready to
start yet?"

 
The thought of creating a commotion sure to bring the Kythui 
investigating up the ridge crosses Katie\'s mind.

"Katie to Phin Base, these V sort of match Ferdy\'s description of
that lone V long ago -- upright biped, two upper limbs, bilateral
symmetry.  But they\'ve got an awful lot more fur.  I thought Ferdy
said they only had fur on top of their heads.  They also look vaguely
feline in appearance."


Mrog hears his boss calling and opens his eyes to discover his ceremonial
head-dress covering his face. Replacing it in its appropriate location,
he responds with a "Here, O chief". Why has he been dreaming strange and
terrible dreams about ritual items such as "zerbhers" and "lance eggments"?


>From his far hiding place, Akhouw notes one of the Kythui in particular
as being more ostentatious (and presumably more important) than the
others as Rak moves to talk with Mrog. "Hryawi, note that one right
.. . . there, 221 mark 10, the big one. Probably a prominent leader,
you might want to deal with him."

A few seconds later, his communicator double chirps -- an urgent
signal from the Trakh\'s anchor watch. Distractedly, Akhouw takes a
few long strides away from the ridge and activates his communicator.
His irritated "WHAT?" is faintly audible to those crew on the ridge.
He listens intently for a minute, then briefly and animatedly talks
into the communicator, before turning to his crew and saying "Alert!
Multiple incoming ships -- back to the Trakh! Quick!"

As his crew hustles to pack up their gear and go back to ths ship,
Akhouw stops Hryawi and Hfolraw. "You two will stay here with the
speeder to continue observation of the Kythui and close scanning
of the ringworld; get as much as you can. If you think it practicable,
you are authorized to make contact. Overall, you are to have due regard
for your own safety. You have wide discretion here, do your best. We
will update you with coded bursts and you may contact the Trakh or
Khaurl likewise; tight-beam laser/maser only. We will arrange a
rendesvouz when possible; until then, good luck! Glory to the Clan!"
Akhouw salutes them both, then turns and quickly strides towards
the Trakh.

Aurora

A new signal is suddenly being received by those in the R-alpha
system.  Rather faint, it must be coming from something like 10
or 20 AU out, and from more or less the opposite side of the system
to where everyone else seems to be accumulating.

[GM Note, it only *seems* to be a 10 AU signal.  I really
 have you as shown above.  Sorry to do that to you, but I 
 want you to join up...]

 
"Hello... Hello... Can anyone hear me?... This is the ISS Westwind...
We\'re, uh, kind of lost at the moment... Nav systems have been
playing up... Not too sure about the sensors, either... No immediate
emergency, but we\'d appreciate someone telling us where we are and
what\'s going on... Someone?... Anyone?... Please respond..."


"Westwind, this is ISS Aurora. If you\'re not sucking vacuum, getting
irradiated or starving to death, you\'re gonna have to wait your turn.
Keep broadcasting; we\'ll get to you in a few hours, maybe. Aurora out."

"Christiaaaaaaaan!" \'Vouf\'s voice is a miserable wail. "There\'s a-NOTHER
Scout ship out there!" He begins to howl piteously.

Christian stops dead in his tracks in disbelief. He slowly leans forward
until his forehead rests against the bulkhead, eyes closed in quiet
frustration, muttering darkly, "Why ME?" In a louder voice akin to
a shout, he consoles \'Vouf, his vocal inflection mirroring \'Vouf\'s
anguish. "Aenrra, I know how you feel. What in HELL did we do to
deserve this?!"

IISS Westwind, This is Admiral Ger of the Darrian Confederation,
Currently in the employ of Turnskaad Corp. You are located in
the Coreward section of Reaver\'s Deep sector. Could you tell us how
you came to this location, and what your intentions are. You are
advised that this is a military operation, and that you should check
with this command centre before performing any operations near the
Ringworld. We are prepared to offer you any reasonable assistance that
will not interfere with our mission.

"Another ship? I don\'t believe this." Witfield quickly gets on the sensor,
scanning ISS Westwind. In the meantime, he access the ship computer
"Computer, please also perform a search on all records of ISS Westwind."
Patting his TL15 Hand Held computer, "nice toy."

Grob hears the struggling brathsk (A creature somewhat resembling
the terran deer) long before he sees it twisting to free its left
hind limb from the snare.  Upon seeing Grob, the brathsk panics and
makes a wild leap.  Grob instantly jumps and grabs it in mid-air.
His hands search for the pressure point between the fifth and sixth
neck vertebrae and by the time both hit the ground, the brathsk is
incapacitated.
 
"Mrog will be pleased," Grob thinks while tying the legs together.
The festivities will start on time this year, and the live offering
was caught at the nearest trap -- both good signs.  He carefully
places the brathsk atop his gara -- to harm the brathsk chosen for
sacrifice is to bring bad luck.
 
He makes the rounds to the other snares and collects two more
brathsks.  Three -- a lucky number.  The extra two will make fine
feasting during the celebration.  At the final trap, Grob notices
something has knocked much of the snow off the trees in the area.
He follows the trail of fallen snow until off in the distance, he
spots an enormous, smooth and shiny rock at the base of a ridge.
He has never seen anything like it in this area, nor anywhere else.
Before he can guess as to what it is, a smaller *floating* rock
goes up to and is engulfed by the larger rock.  Grob watches, not
believing his eyes.  Is this a bad omen?  What should he do?


<Katie> 
"There appears to be one dominant alpha, as well as sub-dominants
ordering others around.  Their society may be based on the same
dominance hierarchies common in most primitive societies like the
Kythui."
 
Akhouw stops Hryawi and Hfolraw. "You two will stay here with the
speeder to continue observation of the Kythui and close scanning
of the ringworld;

Aye-Aye, Sir!  <The Aslan XO stamps to attention and Salutes>

Did you have any particular task in mind for the Pinnace?  How far away 
from us is the Alcyon, and are we picking up any of this scoutship 
distress business/Two scouts in distress...sounds fishy to me!


The bridge comes alive with activity, the lights coming up to standard
levels and stations switching from standby to active, as Akhouw and Uhwaikh
enter, sitting in the command pilot and gunner stations, respectively.
Akhouw secures the restraints rapidly, then turns to the holotank and
the threat analysis board, taking in the rapidly moving situation.
Glancing up, he raps out orders in quick succession.

"Aiwi, plot a maximum power ascent and an intercept course for the
 main group (pointing to the Alcyon cluster). Calculate standard
 evasion maneuvers for standby use. Try and get more information on
 these solos (pointing to the Bernoulli, Windward, and Gemini Arbiter).
 Monitor all communications channels and record all activity. Engage
 the EM Mask; Khaukeairl Clan ID exterior setting."

Activating the ship\'s commlink, he continues.

"Aeawiyh, I want those mains online quickly! Monitor power output
 closely, we may need overdrive or evasive power at a moment\'s notice."


<Katie>
"V craft is apparently preparing to move.  They have left two of
their crew and some equipment, possibly to monitor the Kythui."
Hmm, If these really aren\'t the V we were expecting, maybe some
specimens are in order...


<Trakh>
"Eihoftyah, you and Eakauw (Troop XO) -- fire up the pinnace and follow
 my lead; assume a parallel support position and stand ready for point
 defense help, but do not lock or engage without direct orders. I may
 detach you for independent duty regarding the distant bogies; be ready
 for that. Most importantly, keep alert -- the situation is fluid and
 I need your eyes and ears open to rapid changes. Clear?"

"Certainly, Admiral.  We shall be prepared for as many possibilities as
we can be.  We are picking up apparent distress signals broadcast from
two of the solo contacts.  If we must fight, I suspect those will be easy
prey for the Khaurl...and if we do not fight, perhaps a rescue would put 
the crews in our debt?  (If you will pardon my use of that feminine concept,
sir)."

"Uhwaikh, release tertiary interlocks and energize defensive systems;
 put offensive systems on standby alert. Monitor and analyze all contacts
 for combat ability."

A lightning stab to deactivate the communicator, and Akhouw turns to
consider his panel/HUD telltales, noting with a purr of satisfaction
the availability of full power. His fingers play across the controls
like those of a master pianist, activating Aiwi\'s navigation plot and
engaging full thruster lift. He monitors the holotank for updated
sensor information as the Trakh lifts from its camouflaged hiding
place at the base of a nearby hill, taking care to use the terrain
to avoid spooking the Kythui.

<Katie>
"V craft has lifted off."

<Grob>
A barely audible whine emerges from the direction of the rock.
Grob watches in horror as the rock, surely large enough to flatten
his entire village, begins floating as well and moves towards Grob\'s
direction.  A low roar takes over the whine and rivets Grob in place
as panic begins to take over his thoughts.  "It sees me!  It is
coming to kill me!  It will crush me!"  Just before the rock reaches
Grob, he regains his senses and kicks his gara to turn and run.  The
roar grows to an ear-splitting level as Grob flees, expecting at any
time to feel the rock come down on his back to crush the life out of
him.  Then, just as quickly, the sound passes him and begins to fade.


<Trakh>
Lifting clear of the R-Alpha surface, the Trakh speeds on its way
towards the multitude of unknown ships. Admiral Akhouw Tra\'Ekhaul
spares a moment to contemplate the near future; if these are from
one of the Imperial factions, it could be trouble; if otherwise,
perhaps a measure of accomodation could be reached. An all-out
dewclaw fight would help no-one.


Grob glances upward and sees the rock, now moving away from him.  He
slows his mount down and stares in wonder and fear at the rock which
is now moving faster than any arrow he has ever shot.  Then to his
utter amazement, it heads straight up into the sky and disappears
from view.

<Katie>
"V craft is heading back into space.  Alert, Doejin:  V craft is
heading back in your direction."
 
 
Grob\'s bravery returns to him.  "I am a warrior.  I must show no
fear.  Rak will want to know what else I saw of this omen, and will
know my cowardice if I have not searched the area."  And so Grob
takes a deep breath and heads towards the ridge.
 
Hryawi starts to turn and return to the hill crest when Hfolraw 
stops him  and says
 
"Hryawi, look.  Our meeting problem has solved itself.  There, heading
for the landing zone, is a lone Kythui."

Once at the landing site, Grob can clearly make out a set of 
perfectly rectangular imprints in the snow.  "Perhaps they are 
a message from the spirits."

Hryawi turns toward where Hfolraw is pointing and raises his binoculars 
for a better view.  As the Kythui studies the marks made by the Trakh\'s
 \'legs\' he tells Hfolraw "Get out of site.  We need to get closer before 
he gets away."

The wind shifts its direction and a strange scent fills the air.
Grob looks upwind up the ridge and spots two barely visible, but
moving figures.  At the same moment, the shifting wind knocks some
snow off a tree branch above Grob.  The snow hits him squarely on
top of the head and he instantly panics again, jumps atop his gara,
and heads for the Kythui camp at full speed to tell Rak and Mrog
what he has just seen.

<Katie>
"Hello, what\'s this?  It looks like a Kythui was late to their annual
thanksgiving ritual.  He just got buzzed by the V craft and is in a
state of great fear and confusion.  He is moving towards the Kythui
camp at high speed and should be there in about 5 minutes.  I will
not interfere unless advised otherwise.  

<Hryawi>
"Damn.  We were too slow.  We must hurry.  From the interest he had in
the Trakh\'s traks, he will, no doubt, be bringing friends soon.  We must
not let this change slip by and hurt our pride.

Goughzar turns to watch Charyn as she talks into the transmitter and
listens to Dr. Morser as he speaks about the ship. Finally shaking his
head, he turns on keys the computer.

"PALADIN, do a full scan of all ships in the vicinity, active EMS on all
within range, and continue detailed scan of ringworld."

Zar gets up and stretches a bit and looks over to Charyn at the comm console
and Dr. Morser standing in the doorway. "Grrrr, it looks like we follow dear
Vouf\'s orders... I\'ve always wanted to see a little more..."

As the shiver of emotion from the approaching ship comes through the Paladin
Zar crouches a little and growls a little.

"I hope this doesn\'t continue forever with these people. I don\'t think I like
this psionics flowing so freely. Doktor, if you would like, I can copy the
scans from the distress signals and the ringworld in the equipment you and
Limner undoubtable brought aboard and fiddled with earlier. Perhaps you can
define some details I can\'t.

PALADIN, copy all detailed scans of ships into Aurora with maximum enhancement
and resolution."

Zar paces back and forth in the ship for a bit, but finally settles down into
the pilot\'s seat and goes back to piloting the ship and periodically making
enhancements of the scans.

"Charyn, perhaps you can help me with these scans. The ship didn\'t start with
me as the owner, so I\'m still working on these sensor capabilities that the
ship has built in." Zar brings up various scans and details and starts rambling
into Sensor operations with Charyn.

On the bridge of the command shuttle, Jett walks over to the communications
station in thoughtful contemplation. Withdrawing his portable computer from
its protective belt-sheath, he turns it on and punches up a powerful
database-search program and with an air of determination wends his way
through the welter of 2-D images and text that speed past on his screen.

After about five minutes of coolly efficient research, he pauses to review
the result. He doublechecks it, then clicks the \'puter off and returns it
to the sheath. He turns to Zben (or whomever has half a second free). "A
tight-beam commo link to SubCommander Bhyarrvouf on the Aurora and a
parallel datalink channel, Mister Blaine, if you please."

When the communication link is established, Judge Richard Jett lays
out his plan. "SubCommander, Almighty Sahib Jett here. (The irony in
his voice is palpable.) I concur in your proposed solution to the problem
of the rogue scouts and Commander Ger is of a similar mind. Let me
detail the plan that I have researched and developed."

"SubCommander, unless those people are hopeless incompetents (and I have
my . . . DOUBTS . . . about the Gemini Arbiter\'s . . . crew), then it
is imperative that they be put under contract ASAP. The modified contract
and verification forms are enroute to you." His Honor takes a data crystal
from an inside pocket and puts it in the designated receptacle on the commo
console. "Please point out to them Article IV, in which they agree to
indemnify Turnskaad Corporation for any assistance provided to them in the
event of their breach of contract or misfeasance. In other words, unless
they play ball, not only won\'t they see a credit, but Turnskaad will ...
POLITELY .. seek payment for services rendered -- even if they don\'t sign
the contract. And Turnskaad always collects."

"If they are not enthusiastic about signing aboard this expedition, I hope
you will point out to them that without our help, not only is their chance
of escape about as likely as getting JJ Horne to stop chomping on stogies,
but also that they run the risk of getting reduced to subatomic particles
if a certain Imperial fleet makes a return visit."

"If THAT isn\'t enough, you can assure them that I will personally see to
it that their certification papers are suspended pending inquiry on
suspicion of barratry and that the IISS puts their ships in custodial
impound. That\'s for starters. In short, SubCommander, be gentle with
them." Richard smiles, happy in the thought that Turnskaad will be
getting some (hopefully) quality labor on the cheap -- the new hires
hadn\'t suffered through the last tumultuous two weeks, so naturally
their wages and salvage cut were substantially less than in the standard
contracts.

"One more thing, SubCommander. Commander Ger and I agree that while you
should induct the crews of the three ships, under no circumstances are
they to board one of our ships or land on R-Alpha without a full sweep
by Security personnel. Remind them that as employees of Turnskaad, they
are under the authority of Commander Ger and the Command Team. Please
keep us posted. Jett out."

Aurora

Bhyarrvouf\'s answer is delayed and muffled by static.

"Wilco that, Your Honor. Moira reports successful download of the data.
Just for your and Commander Nanadh\'s <he emphasizes the proper use of
Ger\'s last name slightly> information, the Bernoulli may well be a lost
cause. One dead, one in really bad shape in the med-berth. The ship won\'t
blow up any time soon, unless there\'s another bomb aboard, but she\'s
too unstable to move much further. I\'m going to offload the crew\'s effects
and dump the data from her survey computers, which may be worth its weight
in monadium. I\'m then going to initiate a full shutdown, and leave her on
a long cometary orbit with known parameters so we can come back for her 
later. Basically put her in, whatchamacallem, bothmalls."

    On standard frequency 121.5:

    (female voice: very professional sounding)
    This is Aurelia Xerxes of the Gemini Arbiter. My sister
    Nicole and I are the only personnel aboard. We are employees
    of the Spinward Diplomatic Services Corporation, based on
    Mora in the Spinward Marches.

Halfway to the suit locker, Bhyarrvouf stops in his tracks. His ears
fold back flat. When Christian shoots him a questioning look, he makes
an almost imperceptible motion with one finger, and the PA broadcasts
the message.

"We\'re DEFINITELY in a trap," Bhyarrvouf mutters after it\'s over. "They\'re
trying to STRESS us to death!"

*click* "All fleet craft, this is Aurora. MAINTAIN RENDEZVOUS COURSE! It
is OBVIOUS at this point that we\'ve been set up, and the indigenous 
populace of R-Alpha are our best chance for survival. Make the rendezvous
and get onto the surface ASAP, and we\'ll handle our THIRD miraculous
coincidence of the afternoon after the first two. Aurora out."

After he switches off, Bhyarrvouf snarls, "This STINKS. BADLY!"

    I am Chief Consul Historical Perspectives and Social
    Analysis. My sister is Chief Consul Interspecies Linguistic
    Interpretation and Analysis.	

Christian\'s blank expression shows utter disbelief
which quickly melts into wariness and irritated exasperation. "Aenrra,
back in the long lost past of Terra, a criminal mastermind named
Auric Goldfinger had a saying -- "Once is happenstance, twice is
coincidence, and the third time is enemy action." He pounds his fist
against the bulkhead. "Even if it\'s NOT a trap, I\'m getting damned
tired at suddenly having to be every idiot\'s salvation. Helping is
one thing, but must I suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous
fortune ALL THE TIME??"

*click* "Alcyon, this is Aurora. Have an emergency evacuation plan set up
until further notice; rig the pinnace to carry the cold-sleep berths for
those who might still be salvageable, and be ready to make a run for the
ring. We\'ve had WAY too many coincidences for us to be sitting unprepared.
Bhyarrvouf out."

*click* "Gemini Arbiter, this is ISS Aurora. If you are able to maintain
life support, hang on--we\'ll rendezvous with you sometime before 1124. If
you\'re in real trouble, call us back and we\'ll hustle as best we can. If
you\'re NOT in real trouble, you will be by the time I\'m through with you.
Aurora out."

He begins suiting up, muttering to himself in Vuakedh.....

"Amen, brother.." Christian stands by, his fingers tapping a rhythm on
the bulkhead, matching \'Vouf swear for swear.


    Our situation is much improved. We have regained life
    support and all systems seem to be operating normally.
    (voice in backround: our ship is a mess though!) 

    Our (in an annoyed pitched voice, which sounds directed
    at someone) inner airlock was undergoing routine maintenance when
    the outer door was struck. Since our safety system was disabled
    explosive decompression occured causing numerous problems.

    Other than internal cosmetic damages we are able to
    proceed normally. (voice in background: as long as someone tells
    us where we are!)

    We are in a standard courier/scout class starship several
    au\'s above/below the plane of the ecliptic.

    Since there are several ships in distress we should able
    to lend assistance if needed.


The heads of Christian and \'Vouf both snap up simultaneously and
as their eyes meet there is almost no need for words. Christian
wins the race to the communicator. Opening a tight-beam channel to
the Arbiter, Christian gives full rein to his pent up exasperation and
the steel of command in his voice is unmistakeable.

"NEGATIVE, Gemini Arbiter. ISS Aurora will conduct all rescue
 operations; this is an authorized Turnskaad expedition and you
 WILL stay clear of our operations until you have been verified
 and authorized by Command personnel. I don\'t care if you are
 Empress Arbellatra; frankly I don\'t give a damn. Stay where you
 are and we will get to you. Acknowledge and comply, Gemini
 Arbiter. Christian Van Der Merwe, ISS Aurora, OUT."

    (Nicole breaks in:)
    Our outer airlock door is damaged beyond its ability to 
    hold pressure. A standard overcoupling connection should render
    it usable until we are able to get it repaired.

    (Aurelia speaks:)
    This is Gemini Arbiter. Out.

At the commo panel in the command shuttle, Zben Blaine suddenly
starts getting inundated with emergency broadcasts, responses, banter,
and some communications that sounds so disjointed he believes it may
be in code! As he is alerting Commander Ger he sets up his panel to
record and track each seperate ship\'s communications, then establishes
a distance, vector, and speed for each ship and puts this info up on
the main display (unless ordered otherwise). In addition he `tightens
up\' the highspeed computer link with the Alcyon, so that he can do 2
point trianglulation as needed.

 "Commander! Blaine here. We seem to have a distress signal..."
(slight pause...) "... make that TWO distress calls coming in! I am
tracking these vessels as well as our ships. Recordings are being made
of all conversations and data. Awaiting your orders, sir!"

Turning to the helmsman "Well, so much for the `boldly goes where
no one has gone before\' prize."


<Ger>
Blaine, please contact this new ship. 

Farouk, remind me never to travel in a type S scout again..

Gemini Arbiter, This is Admiral Ger of the Darrian Confederation,
Currently in the employ of Turnskaad Corp. You are located in
the Coreward edge of Reaver\'s Deep sector. Where was you last
location? What are your intentions now that you have arrived at this
location? You are advised that this is a military operation, and that 
you should check with this command centre before performing any 
operations near the Ringworld. We are prepared to offer you any 
reasonable assistance that will not interfere with our mission.


There is a low warning tone, and the tactical display begins to shift.

"Commander, there is a second ship rising from R-alpha."  Farouk\'s voice 
is low and precise.  

A yellow velocity vector is rapidly filled in, stretching from a grey 
icon indicating "indeterminate, medium size".  A quick tap brings up a 
mostly-empty data box.

"Point of origin ring surface, 10.29 degrees spinward. Heading 
declination 79 degrees, inclination 4 degrees, speed 63.4 km/s and 
accelerating.  Will intercept us in 35 minutes if we maintain current 
course."

<Ger>
"Farouk, can you identify the class or nationality of the vessel?"


The display has shifted again, replacing the grey icon with an orange 
one.

<Blaine>
"Commander, the ship is tentatively identified as Aslan."


<Ger>
"Will the Aslan ship reach us before or after the Shuttle from 
the Ringworld?"


<Witfield>
"After.  We have eleven minutes to shuttle contact and 2.4 hours to
Aslan contact."


"Aslan ship? Oh great. As if we don\'t have enough trouble
already. What are your orders, commander? Should we hail them?
They are on intercept, I\'m sure they\'ve seen us by now..."


"Mr. Witfield. Try and see if you can contact them. Actually try to
contact the other shuttle as well."


Zben notes the new ship rising from R-alpha, and puts its track
up on the main display as well. When the tentative ID of Aslan comes
through he addresses the Captain:

<Blaine>
"Sir, I was involved with trade delegations to the Aslan, and
can get by OK in basic K`dessha (their `trade\' language), and can
understand a bit of T`essh (their `warrior tongue\'). I can attempt to
communicate with them if you like, unless the Captain prefers to have
a `private\' fall back to computer translation."

He studies the path of the ship, and does a couple of quick EMS
sweeps of it flightpath.

"I also detect atmospheric beam scatter that could indicate
either a laser or maser communications beam was established between the
ship and some point on the surface of R-alpha near its point of
departure."


<Ger>
"Mr. Blaine. I am fluent in Aslan, I had an Aslan Bodyguard for many
years, unless this is some strange dialect we shouldn\'t have any problems.
Can you pinpoint the location on the surface? And where is it in
relation to the point where the shuttle took off from? Are you on
duty currently or is Mr. Whitfield?"


<Blaine>
"Both, sir.  I\'m handling commo, and Witfield sensors, with some overlap."

<Ger>
"Good.  Raise the Talisman."

Thul upon hearing the exchange on the distress channel mutters a 
few profane syllables to himself and yells "Let\'s get this ship to GQ status
NOW!!"   Plunking down to a gunnery console, he brings the fire control 
system out of standby and performs the preliminary stuff to getting a fire
control solution on the distressed vessel.

Using his perogative as ship owner, Thul radios \'Vouf...  "I hear what you
said about staying in formation Subcommander, but if you change your mind 
about it I can have some extra guns over to you real quick!!  Standing by.."

"Don\'t worry, Thul. If I need help, you\'ll hear me screaming and you WON\'T
need a radio." \'Vouf chuckles and breaks contact.
 
"Niigurd responding to GQ. What the hell is my station on board for
anything beyond contact situation? Medical?"
 
Do ya\' know how to man a turret?   If not, sickbay is the next best place...

J.J. quickly spits out his cheroot, muttering that, "At this rate I am
going to run short and have nothing to smoke. Can\'t we just once have
a milk run, just once!" With that he buttons up his Vacc Suit, and
clicks his comdot. "Thul, J.J. hear all buttoned up and standing by
for boarding if needed.", the rest present hear the distinctive sound
of the bolt of an SMG being pulled back.

"Hey Horne, I hoped you\'re hooked up to ships power with that suit o\'yours,
cause you can figure on sitting in it for about six hours before we can
get within boarding range, assuming we headed out right now.  Relax a bit,
you must not be used to these distances out here.  Besides," Andon says
glancing sidways at Thule, "with this tub it might even take us 12 hours
to get over there."

"Niigurd here. Negative on turret weapons. Reporting to medbay (it is
going to be rather crowded there."

"THREE ships to deal with," Bhyarrvouf growls as he finishes suiting up.
"This is beyond ridiculous. This is SUICIDAL! --"

*click*

This is Gemini Arbiter.

(female voice slightly appologetic) It isn\'t our fault
our ship missed jumped! How are we to know what\'s happening! It\'s
not as if we haven\'t got problems of our own, too! We were just
trying to be helpful to those others in need!

(female voice changes to slightly whiny)
Oh, all right! We will stay right here until someone...

(voice in background: if they make up their minds whose
in charge!) ... decides we\'re safe.

	Gemini Arbiter. Out.


\'Vouf looks like he\'s going to have a stroke. The inner linings of his
ears color a deep reddish purple, and his mouth works furiously but
nothing comes out. His hands clench and unclench feebly for a minute
or two. He raises a hand, opens his mouth--

*click*

 "Hello again everyone.
This is ISS Westwind.  I\'m sorry if there\'s been some sort of
misunderstanding.  We are not... repeat, not... in distress.
We were just requesting some navigational info.  Our damage is
fairly superficial -- we don\'t need rescuing, thanks all the same.

"Hello Gemini Arbiter.  Glad to know you\'re coping all right,
Nikki.  Give a shout if you need any help, otherwise we\'re heading
in-system.  Maybe I\'ll see you later.

- --and closes his mouth and lowers his hand, staring at Christian helplessly.


As he waits for \'Vouf to complete his preparations, Christian irritatedly
opens a comm channel for what seems like the thousandth time. "Westwind,
this is Aurora. Suggest you do not approach in-system until approved by
command personnel. This is for your own safety. Current situation fluid
and hazardous to non-Turnskaad personnel. Acknowledge, Westwind. Van Der
Merwe, out." Christian turns to \'Vouf with an expression of exasperated
resignation. "Aenrra, we have two loose-cannon ships out there -- have
any ideas about what we do with them?"


\'Vouf stares at Christian for a few seconds, as if not understanding the
question. He then does something quite remarkable-- he reaches over his 
shoulders with both gauntleted hands, grabs his uniform by the scruff
of the neck, and tries to bodily lift himself off the ground!

This exercise continues for a few short moments, \'Vouf panting with the
strain, then ends as he relaxes and lets go of himself. "Stress relief,"
he explains with a smile. "Poppa always used to scruff me an\' my brothers
when we got into fights...."

"Aghh!"  Ralf winced as the signal traffic expanded by several
orders of magnitude.  Three ships that "just happened" to be in the same
chunk of space as the Turnskaad expedition and a tech level 25
macrostructure?  Ralf focused in on the newcomers and started going through
incoming data with a proverbial fine-toothed comb.  "Computer, check the
Library for files on the Bernoulli, Westwind, and Gemini Arbiter for owner
information, run voice print comparisons.  Compare transponder signals."  On
the off chance that an enemy was foolish enough to fake the ship and use the
wrong voice prints.  Which brought up a whole \'nother question.
"Meanwhile..." 

The Alcyon\'s computers had been compromised - hell, the whole damn
ship had been compromised - by that insidiously programmed robot.  Ralf
spared a brief curse for the idiots who\'d blown the thing up when they could
have taken it out `softly\' and let the experts take it apart for information
on what else it had done.  Could they be certain these ships were really
there, not simply computer-phantoms slipped into the system?

One way.  Ralf knifed through the Talisman\'s datasphere and seized
control of the appropriate sensors, shutting down links, sequestering them
from the main avionics.  Now he could scan the targets directly, as directly
as possible short of taking a spacewalk and seeing with his own eyes.  No,
no doubt.  Whatever it was that was out there, was out there.  Ralf released
control before the bridge crew could notice a change.

What was the old maxim?  "Once is coincidence.  Twice is stupidity.
Three times is enemy action."  Something like that.  Still, none of these
three looked like a direct threat.  It was the hidden trap that endangered
the expedition...

Admiral Ger. We were enroute coreward on a diplomatic mission.
However, it is in all likelyhood our mission has been compromised

Therefore, due to the nature of the current situation we would
appreciate any help you would offer. It has been pointed out that
we are a long way from the main routes and would need assistance
returning.

The exchange need not be one way, though. We are prepared to offer
our assistance also. 

I\'m sure some form of mutual agreement can be reached!

"Ky? KlashKy!" Blaine turns to the Sensor array, and does some
quick calculations. He then pulls up a holo of R-Alpha showing a trace
from the Aslan ships to the surface,  which proceedes to enlarge.
"Assuming a straight lift off this..." and a small white square
appears on the holo "... should be where the ship was grounded, within
a klik. Backtraceing the beam scatter from the known position of the
Aslans puts the beam target in approximately the same position."
Slight frown "Sir, would you like an Active sensor sweep of that area?
I can couple us to the Alcyon\'s sensor array, and it\'ll tell us
exactly what\'d down there. `Course, it\'ll light up every sensor 
within a parsec."

Trakh

Akhouw glances at the holotank. "Many ships, but except for the large one,
probably a tender if the scans are accurate, they are all small fry. Probably
not a military force of any kind; with times as they are, even a reconaissance
would be in force." He distractedly strokes his mane with a paw. A purr-growl
rumbles from his throat, followed by an explosive laugh. "Obviously not Aslan,
either, to have come in such a rag-tag fleet, eh Aiwi? Those rogue newcomers
seem to be less than a formidable foe. Still, perhaps we should talk to
them." Another sharp laugh. "We can always fight them later..."

Akhouw turns to listen to his gunner\'s report on the weaponry of the
opposing craft. No surprises there; varied weapons generally at a high
level of alert. "Uhwaikh, remove secondary interlocks on defensive
systems. Continue scanning. Prepare to energize laser sub-systems and
load standard missile pattern, but maintain secondary interlocks."

Turning back to face the main viewscreen, Akhouw barks out orders.
"Fa\'eairl, battle status! Yellow Alert." The ship\'s computer responds
with alacrity. The lighting on the bridge shifts to a more subdued
setting (at least to human eyes), casting an ominous reddish cast
over the bridge, but enhancing a predator\'s vision.


As he waits for the situation to develop, Akhouw meditatively flexes
his dewclaw, idly tracing patterns on the bulkhead. When the hail
comes in, he instantly snaps back into his well-worn command pose.
He opens his mouth, but then closes it and examines the holotank
briefly. A touch at the sensor panel and the icons in the tank are
overlaid with communications information. Akhouw purrs with quiet
satisfaction. Pointing a claw at the shuttle icon, he turns to
his communciations officer. "Aiwi, hail that ship on the maser
commlink. Use the standard Imperial acknowledgement code and
suggest visual communications."

Meanwhile, the ship\'s transponder broadcasts its message "Combat
Exploration Vessel *Trakh*, Clan Khaukeairl" over and over.

"Aslan or no, that\'s our job and Commander Ger is counting on us. He\'s
on this mission because Turnskaad knew of his qualifications -- they
knew he might have to handle loads of sticky situations. Certainly he
has the ability to negotiate with some Aslan and reach an accomodation.
I have confidence in his ability to do just that -- so should you."
Christian gently chides \'Vouf. "This is no time to tuck in your tail
and surrender to the absurdity of it all. It\'s time we started throwing
it right back into Fate\'s teeth and take control."

"Surrender\'s a dirty word to my people, aenrra," \'Vouf says darkly, buttoning
up his collar and reaching for his helmet and PLSS-A pack.

Tucking his sleek gauss pistol in a shoulder holster, Christian steps
to the airlock control panel and, looking at \'Vouf, nods at the closed
outer airlock. "I\'m going for a walk, aenrra, how about you?"

\'Vouf checks his gauntlets, tool belt, and pistols, which are hanging low
on his thighs in fast-draw position. "Ready when you are, Christian." 
He carefully slips his muzzle into the helmet and secures it in place.

"Moira, current status and Bernoulli ETA, please." A few moments of
silence is broken by the melodic tones of the ship\'s computer.

<All systems nominal, sir. Fusion plant and maneuver drives are within
 tolerance limits. Aurora will intercept the Bernoulli in three point
 eight nine four minutes. (pause) Sensors indicate that the Bernoulli\'s
 power plant output has dropped fifteen percent. Diagnostics show main
 fuel pump failure. Switching to auxiliary pump and fuel routing systems.
 Compensating. Power output stabilized. ETA now one point seven six two
 minutes. Orders, sir?>

Christian considers the situation for a moment, then acts. "Moira,
bring the Bernoulli to all stop and take the Aurora down from overdrive
status. Initiate ship to ship docking sequence alpha two. Complete
maneuver and stand by for further orders."

<Aye, sir. Executing Alpha Two.>

The Bernoulli seemingly glides to a stop as the Aurora approaches from
aft, slowly settling closer to the Bernoulli, slower and slower until
the airlock mating collars meet and the Aurora likewise is still. A
slight jar as the ships mate, then the seal forms and an indicator
on the airlock control panel softly glows green.

Christian taps the door control and the outer iris valve smoothly
opens. Glancing back down the corridor, Christian motions to the
Iridium twins as he steps into the airlock proper. "Hey aenrra,
what\'ja need, an Imperial invitation?" Christian waves \'Vouf into
the airlock, then closes the outer iris valve.

"Yeah, yeah, I\'m here," \'Vouf mutters, looking blackly at the two 
robots, who are jostling him.

"Moira, open the Bernoulli main airlock doors." <Aye, sir. Done.>

The airlock\'s pressure controls stare at the boarding party with an angry
red glow.  Interior hull pressure 1000 torr. (1.3 atmospheres)  Christain
nearly looses his balance as he steps into the Bernoulli\'s lock.  Internal
gravity set for 7m/s^2 (.7G)  The pressure adjustment takes only a moment
and the sudden pressure increase seems to grip at the boarders bodies as
their vac suits clamp tight around them.

Christian takes a deep breath. "Ready or not, here I come!" A touch
and the inner door opens with nary a sound. The wisps of frost which
decorate the Bernoulli\'s airlock chamber glisten and glare in the
ambient lighting, an indication of damage to the outer seal. Bounding
through into the main corridor, Christian reflexively glances aft,
as if expecting a saboteur to loom out of the shifting shadows which
resulted from bomb damage to the aft lighting systems.

Pointing towards engineering, Christian yells to \'Vouf. "Aenrra, you
go aft and secure engineering; I\'m going to the bridge, I bet that\'s
where the patient is." He swivels his head towards Dulinor and Lucan.
"Follow me!" Christian swiftly jogs fore-ward, the Iridium Twins
silently trailing in his wake.

The forward corridor has been extensively modified.  All the
stateroom bulkheads have been torn out forming one large communal room.
The wall and ceiling holopanels project an odd image as though the room
were on top of a high mesa overlooking a great desert.  A reddish sun
lights the room while whisps of holgraphic clouds roll across the sky.

The effect is somewhat spoiled by the large demountable fuel tanks which
take up half the volume of the room.

"Right behind you, aenrra." Bhyarrvouf stumbles in the lighter gravity
but recovers himself quickly, making his way down the hallway to the
Drive Room....and comes face to face with OSF-4.

He stifles a yip of fear, Leadfoot all too recent and painful a memory,
as he looks over the lethal warbot. "Oh, for the good old days," he
mutters in Vuakedh. "Well, if he wants to kill me, he will....*sigh*"

*click*

"I assume I\'m addressing OSF-4? Well, ah, um, great! Great to meet you.
I see you did a good job of defusing the bomb." While making this nervous
patter and keeping a close eye on the RAM launchers, \'Vouf looks over the
Drive Room with a practiced eye. "What a mess," he says mildly. He turns
to the warbot and his voice takes on a ring of authority.


- ----
With his knowledge of the standard S layout, Christian reaches the
bridge in seconds. Looking in, he is momentarily taken aback at
the sight of Doctor Trrrweeerrrlll lying sprawled, half over an
acceleration perch. His pallor is alarming (even for an Ael Yael)
and his respiration is ragged and shallow. Despite the shock, there
is something about the forlorn figure which is familiar to Christian.
A vague memory, something about a courier mission? Christian shakes
the thought from his mind as he sets to work on the task at hand.

The air of the bridge is heavy, while the type S Scouts air system always
was a bit of a snafu, it can hardly deal with the stench of severe jump
sickness nausea.  There\'s your dehydration and malnuitrition right there!

A smaller Aeloid screeches in alarm.  With a single flap, it leaps to the
top of an acceleration perch and stares at Christian while looking
defensively at it\'s master.  Yet it keeps its distance from the operation
not interfering.

"Tiger, Down!" a voice comes seemingly from nowhere.  But quickly, a
boxlike robot detatches itself from the control panels and hovers over
to the small Aeloid which retreats glaring at the intruders.

"I am assistant robot Triple Three.  I am instructed to assist you.
I am not programmed for medical situations, but will assist in any
way consistant with my programming."

Squatting down on the grey deckplate, Christian sets the mode with
a thumb as he runs the medical scanner over the prone Doctor, then
turns to view the analyzed results on the portable med-computer.
As advertised, severe jump-sickness with a variety of complications.
Christian frowns. That wasn\'t expected. Respiratory distress, becoming
more severe as time passes, with attendant cyanosis.

Tweel\'s eyes flutter open slowly.   With difficulty focussing, he twists
his head around upsidedown to study Lucan closing in on him.
"Marrrk sseven medbot...  Obssollessscent..." His eyes close slowly.
"Planned obssolllessence... Ssstupid.   Upgrrrrrade..."  Tweel\'s neck
slowly untwists itself as he sinks back below conciousness.

- ----
"OSF-4, I assume your primary responsibility is to safeguard the life of
your owner. My colleague is seeing to him right now, and will evacuate
him to the Aurora immediately upon stabilizing him. I want you to accompany
him over to the Aurora and observe the medical procedures. I also assume
you\'ll be monitoring what I do over here while you\'re gone; just so you know,
I\'m going to mothball the Bernoulli for safe keeping until we can repair
her properly. That means a plant shutdown, venting the fuel, and a shift
of all systems to standby status. Then we\'ll flush the bad air out and
leave her in nice, clean vacuum. When we get ready to leave, we\'ll fuel
and re-air her and fix the machinery, not that it matters since she\'ll be
riding the Alcyon, that\'s our Jump tender, out of the system with us anyway."

- ----
The Iridium Twins glide into position over the treatment site, with
sensor probes extended to supplement Christian\'s scanner. A quick
look at the other vital signs, then he dives into his medkit for
an injector and the ampule of Neojumpsin (universal jump sickness
serum). Christian attaches the ampule to the injector, verifies
the dosage level and injects Tweel. "Damn!" The vital signs improve
somewhat, but his respiration continues to decline. "Must have
weakened his pulmonary muscle control too much.." mutters Christian.

"Dulinor, inject 3cc Gamma-Nutrium. Analyze jump sickness complications
and suggest appropriate response. Lucan, compute Ael Yael dosage and
prepare Cordrazine injection. Hand me the portable support unit." As
the robot arm holds the pack out to Christian, the medcomp emits a
strident, continuous tone. Christian\'s head snaps over to look at
the vidscreen in fearful anticipation. "Pulmonary arrest!" Suddenly
the urgency rachets up a notch, as a flurry of activity breaks out.

"Lucan, inject NOW. Ready supplemental dosage." Christian snatches the
pack from Lucan and speedily attaches the cardio/pulmonary stimulator
unit to Tweel\'s chest region. He taps the controls and the gizmo
springs to life. A few minutes of frantic work and Christian reviews
the readout. Good, life signs stabilizing, but too low for comfort.
"Dulinor, Lucan -- help me get him into the portable med-berth." The
two robots pick Tweel up, carefully folding his five meter wing span, 
and 1.5 meter tail, and slide him into the capsule with perhaps
surprising gentleness and care considering the light weight but large 
bulk of the giant bird.

Christian taps his intraship communicator. "Aenrra, I have the
survivor stabilized but he needs to get aboard the Aurora stat. Am
heading there now. Van Der Merwe out." Christian gathers up his
supplies, then addresses his charges. "To the Surgery -- let\'s go!"
Christian jogs back down the corridor, the two robots carrying the
med-berth, trailing in his wake yet again.


"Go!" Bhyarrvouf watches the trio, pushing the berth, leave the Bernoulli.
He then turns to the two robots and says, "One more thing, you and the 
crew of this ship have placed yourselves in the hands of our team under 
the terms of the Distressed Spacefarers Act. You should review the legal 
responsibilities that entails, on BOTH of our parts, and further note the 
fact that you are boarding a ship of the IISS Intelligence Office, with 
the security regulations that THAT entails. No data taps or rewiring, 
understand?" He pauses.

"They\'re on their way to the airlock. I\'ll follow you." He waves OSF-4 away.

After Oscar leaves, \'Vouf quickly and carefully bags the remains of the
bomb, then finishes shutting down the rest of the systems. Life support 
sighs to a halt; the lights go out and are replaced by the self-powered 
emergency lights. Bhyarrvouf vents the remaining hydrogen from the tanks, 
and satisfies himself that the Bernoulli will be safe until refueled and 
started up again. 

On the way out, \'Vouf pauses for a moment. Visions of Leadfoot\'s metal fists
smashing into him come back vividly. He heads up to the Bridge, and finds
the main avionics panels. Carefully and with great speed, he locates the
main and backup computers, disconnects them, and removes the memories-- they
too will be safe until called for. 

"Job well done," \'Vouf mutters, crossing the bridge and shutting the airlock.
The Bernoulli is left behind-- safe and sound, but unable to maneuver or
sustain life until refurbished.


He rides the plume of escaping air across to the Aurora, dragging a motley
collection of frozen, bagged groats behind him on a taut-line.

The Aurora moves away toward its meeting with the Westwind and Gemini Arbiter,
leaving the Bernoulli safe and sound in space behind it....

"We\'re out of here, aenrra," \'Vouf reports, firing the Aurora\'s thrusters
on a preprogrammed course toward the rendezvous with Westwind and Gemini
Arbiter as he peels off his suit helmet. "Let me know how the patient is."

Dark...
Dark...
RED!!!
PAIN..CRAMP!

Casey struggles to a sitting position and starts kneading the cramp
out of his leg.  The red veil across his eyes turns pink and fades to
reveal a blast of green.

The cramp gone, Casey struggles to his feet, falls back to his knees
and pukes violently.

A few woozy moments later, he has unsteadily made his feet and is
taking stock.  On the ground is a lumpy looking black duffle, beside
it an oversized leather flight bag, sealed from the atmosphere.

Like an old InfoCom(tm) game, the inventory rolls through Casey\'s
muddled mind;

There is a duffle here.
There is a leather flight bag here.
There is a vacc suit here.

A vacc suit?  Yes.  That\'s what I threw off when I tried to sit up.
So, where\'s the ship?


The vacc suit is a minimal model and looks old and worn.  Casey thinks
he\'s had it for a while and then realizes he doesn\'t remember where or
when he got it.  And how to use it (as anything other than a cover
against the night), is also a mystery to him!

What the hell is going on?  I don\'t even know where I am!

Casey looks around the forest.  Large green plants are broken
revealing the path from whence he came.  Casey stumbles through the
plants arriving at a large scorched patch in the ground.  Glancing
around, Casey can determine a \'bounce path\' for several larger pieces
of metal debris, similar to the one at his feet.

Thirst gnaws at the back of his throat.  His head is aching and he
starts to see the woods wheel around him.  Casey crumples to the
forest floor.....


Thirst.....thirsty......."I\'m thirsty"

The sun is bright and high when Casey cracks his eyes open.

I must have been out for only a few moments.

Struggling to his feet, Casey wobbles back to his luggage.  A bit of
light steam rises from the moist ground.

The duffle\'s bottom is stuffed with some clothes and small packages. 
There is room for the vacc suit, and so Casey stows it.  Hefting the
flight bag is a pleasant surprise....not as heavy as it looks.

Casey slings the bag and dragging the duffle, starts to zigzag through
the undergrowth, heading down hill as best as his pounding head and
heaving stomach will allow.

Paladin

"Trrrrrrrrrrrrrrweeeerrrrrrrrrrrl? Vhy does anyone have trrrrrrouble 
prrrrronouncing zat...?"

Aboard the Paladin, Dr. Morser looks about to see telltales flashing like
christmas tree lights all around the bridge.

"Gott im himmel!! Vat is zis, a convention or somesing?"

Shortly thereafter, the comm boards light up also, as everybeing and their
progenitor squawks about what a mess this is. \'Vouf\'s cursing about \'too
many coincedences stikes a familiar chord in the good doctor...

"Qvite so, mein freund. Herr Goughzar, if you vould be so kind as to put
us, how do you say, \'on ze deck\'? Since ve haff no vay of knowing who zese
other ships really are, I believe ve should go ahead und rend.. rondo..rand-..
(I hate zose frrrench vords) link up mit ze shuttle from R-Alpha as qvickly
as pozzible. Und tank you for ze suggestion, Dr. Limner und I vill start 
trying to enhance ze sensor data en route.

Frau Robins, can you giff me a tight-beam hail to ze R-Alphan shuttle? I
sink it is time ve intrrrduced ourselves, before anyvun else does it
for us, nicht war?"

With this, he turns to the computer console and links in with his own
wristcomp.
"Doctor Limner, caould you help me interpret zis data? It looks verry 
interesting...verrrrrrry interrrrrresting..."


Charyn has put the commo scanner on the speaker-vid for the benefit of
all who had been interested in following the communications goings-on.
Most aboard the Paladin have the option to have audio and/or video of
the communications displayed at their work area.


Doctor Limner seems to be in a state of shock or something.  Obviously
something has shaken him up.

(to Doctor Morser) "I\'m sorry, Doctor.  What was that?  Oh, yes, sensors."

(to the Paladin computer) "PALADIN, please give me a tachyonic analysis.
  If you are familiar with the tachyonic signature of psionic activity,
  then configure the scan for optimal detection of such.  Pay special
  attention to the ships rising from the ring and the ring itself."

He then picks up one of his detectors, looks at it, and mumbles to
himself, "Completely overloaded.  What have we gotten ourselves into this
time?"  He then lets the instrument drop to the floor.  Looking utterly
despondent, he almost drudgingly turns and plugs his wrist-comp into
one of his mass storage units (the kind you might find in a laboratory,
containing hundreds of holocrystals worth of information).  He then types
a few commands into his wristcomp.  Anyone looking over his shoulder would
see him select file "Psi Omega", which brings up a menu.  After hesitating
over the item "trial", he selects "Rena", then "signatures".  He then
begins downloading information into his wristcomp.  Many messages flash on
his wristcomp display, such as "TELEKINESIS", "EMPATHIC PROJECTION: FEAR",
"PSYCHOPORTATION", etc.

Doctor Limner usually just seems absent-minded -- now he seems totally
oblivious to everyone around him.  A death-like mask is on his face.

Eventually, his wristcomp finishes loading.

(to the Paladin computer) "PALADIN, compare tachyonic signature analysis
to all tachyonic signatures in unit LIMNER HC 1 and inform me of any
similarities."

Doctor Limner looks so pale, he seems almost ghost-like.

(to Doctor Morser) "Excuse me, Doctor.  I seem to have a terrible
  headache."

Doctor Limner then faints dead away.

....and with Zar and Charyn conferring on the latest set of course corrections,
and Morser studying his \'SwatchComp\' wrist computer, it takes a moment to
notice the sudden silence...

"Vat vas you saying, mein fr-   ACH! AUSGEFUCK!! Charyn! Ve need a medic, und
qvickly!  Doctor Limner has fainted!"

Zar snaps around to watch as Dr. Limner falls to the floor with a thud.
As Dr. Morser turns and calls to Charyn, Zar stops and listens to the
information coming over the open comm channel.

"PALADIN, active maximum sensor scan on R-Alphan shuttle. Maintain scan and
aquisition passive sensor lock on Aslan ships. Do not active weapons turret.
Open internal frequency to Command Shuttle and begin transmitting live data
on all scans. Active scan of Aslan launch site and surrounding area for 5km."

Charyn wheels around, looking dumly at Morser, then a second later the
mental clutch engages and she drops to a crouch next to Limner.  She 
immediately leans over the body, announcing a checklist to no-one in
particular: "check breathing... breathing regular... check pulse...
pulse regular..."

Karl steps over himself and begins to check his fallen comrade out himself.
"I\'m not a medical doctor, Frau, but if you need mein aziztance, I haff 
limited skills in ze arrea...Oh, mein poor freund.."

Glancing about helplessly as Charyn takes over the examination, Morser spies
the viewplate of Limner\'s own computer, and wheels start to turn....

<Zar>
Charyn, if you need any help, I\'m a class 1 medic.

Without looking up Charyn says in a commanding tone of voice, "Mister
Azani, please fetch the med kit from the bridge locker, and bring a some
blankets.  Thanks!".  She pauses an instant, then barks: "Now!" Azani
takes off like a well-oiled machine.

"Check for trauma... no visible trauma... looks a little pale... treat
for shock..." she mumbles.  Charyn gets to her knees looks up at Zar,
"Zar! Help me get him on his back then you can get back to the commo
thanks....".

"Hmmm...you don\'t say...Paladin, continue upload uf Herr Limner\'s files
to ze main computer. Frau Robins, chust before he passed out, Doctor Limner
vas schtudying zome data on psionics on his computer...perhaps he is somehow
sensitive to ze natives below?"

Charyn squints and mumbles something like "...damn the psionics..."


Finishing his dialog with the computer and Charyn, Zar turns to the general
sensor panel and quickly glances over the files Dr. Limner uploaded and
executed.

"PALADIN, keep file PSI-OMEGA active and running through all ship\'s scans. Code
and identify any neural activity inside our ships and any close enough to be
within range. Cross correlate with both Active and Passive EMS and Densitometer
scans and relay information to Command Shuttle and Alcyon archives."

Zar finally turns his attention back to the pilots controls when the computer
speaks \'R-Alphan ship making high power manuevers to a new intercept course.\'

Zar crouches back at the controls and increases the acceleration to meet the
R-Alphan shuttle, and watches at the Talisman and Alsan ships light up with
active weapons and sensors.

Limner does not appear to be hurt.  Soon after Azani reaches him, he
starts to stir a little.  He\'s very groggy, though.  He seems to be
trying to say something, although his voice is very soft.  It sounds
like "reene ya".

Azani arrives with the blankets.  Azani and Charyn coordinate and get a
blanket under his raised feet and a blanket over top.  "Scanner, let\'s
see...".  She takes a somewhat helpless look at the scanner, spies a
power switch, and flicks it on, placing it on the doctor\'s chest.
"Uh-huh, okay for now."

"Doctor Limner, you just rest here for a couple minutes.  I think you\'re
going to be fine.  Azani, could you please watch the doctor? I\'ll go get
a gurney so we can make him more comfortable in a stateroom".

Limner is still groggy.  As he\'s being dragged off to his stateroom, he
apologizes in a slurred voice:

"Slorry.  I\'m gnot husually like dis.  I\'ll be fffine."

He exhales strongly a few times.  Charyn worries for a second until she
realizes it is simply a semi-conscious laugh.

"Loong time ago.  Long time.  Shhhouldnn\'t lledt id get te me like dhis.
Oh, Rena..."

Suddenly, Limner realizes he is babbling and stops.  He shakes his head
a bit and says:

"I\'ll be OK.  I guess I just need to lie down for a few minutes.  Don\'t
stop the program I started.  Powerful psionics leave traces for a while.
We need to know what we\'re dealing with."

Limner lets himself be put to bed.

N: Somebody went active! A Merchant ship.

A: What!? Hope he isn\'t trigger happy!

N: Picked up a message pulse. Just looks like he\'s getting prepared.

A: (spoken matter-of-factly) Must be a military type!

N: (in a sarcastic tone) That\'s not necessarily true. You heard the 
   Admiral. Just because we\'re in a military zone doesn\'t mean HE\'S 
   military (snicker, snicker).

[sometime later. . .]
>At the appearance of the latest ships from outside the ring and the

N: Wow! Look at him!

A: Who?

N: The Aslan.

A: What\'s he upto?

N: Looks like he responded to the Merchant. 

A: This is starting to look bad! 
   I think it\'s time to prepare for the worst.

N: You might be right but lets hold off for a while. We\'ll take turns
   watching the sensor display and see what develops.

A: (walking towards the bridge exit)
   Yeah. We\'re still a ways away so maybe we\'ll be able stay out of it.
   AND, since it\'s your idea you get first watch. I\'m going to take a 
   bath!

N: (getting huffy at the console)
   That\'s not fair! 

A: (looking over her shoulder and exiting the bridge)

Nick Talon and Hur\'Shurvan exchange glances.
 
"Who ARE these clowns?" says Talon.  "I don\'t think they\'ve made up
their minds whether they want to blow us out of the sky or offer us
a job!"
 
Hur\'Shurvan taps delicately at his hand computer.  "I\'ll put this
down as a law level zero system, shall I, Nicholas?" he asks solemnly.
 
Talon nods rather absent-mindedly.  His attention is turned towards
the navigational display he has just called up.  "Shit.  They were
right about one thing, at least.  We\'re going to need their help to
get out of here."
 
"And it seems that we are not the only ones in such a predicament."
 
"Yeah.  Weird, that, isn\'t it?  Several ships misjumping into the
same system and arriving almost simultaneously.  The odds against
a coincidence like this must be incredible."
 
"Coincidence?" Hur\'Shurvan murmurs more to himself than to Talon.
"Hmmm... I wonder..."  He peers closely at his hand-comp display.
 
"Anyway," says Talon, "I guess we\'d better humour them."  He opens a
hailing frequency again.
 
"This is ISS Westwind.  We will approach on your given course as
requested.  It\'ll take us a few hours to get there.  Meanwhile, we\'d
really appreciate it if someone would be kind enough to explain just
what is going on around here."

Getting some data now, sir.

On the long-range sensor holo, the Aurora and Bernoulli are
clearly in view.  A high-magnification synthesis in one corner
shows first Doctor Vander Merwe with three other figures leave
the Bernoulli for the Aurora, and then few moments later, the
mission XO.

The Aurora had just tuned onto its new course and heading to leave the
mothballed Bernoulli behind and rendezvous with the Westwind and the
Gemini Arbiter, when its radio signal pings suddenly halted. Scans
show the Aurora drifting along the same course, no longer accelerating,
still warm and emitting neutrinos normally but showing NO EM activity
whatsoever. It\'s as if someone pulled her plug.

As tensions between the fleets rise rapidly, Akhouw sits back in his
command chair to review his options, quickly. No telling what sort of
an admiral that Darrian was, whether faster to the trigger than most or
not was unclear. Too much was happening, too fast, with only the barest
of information to go on. Akhouw gnashes his teeth in silent frustration
and worry. No shots had been fired, yet, but that could change quickly.

Time slowly ticks by as the fleets warily consider each other, Akhouw
thinks, much as combatants in a ritual duel. Just as deadly, just as
earnestly serious.

Suddenly, the sensor board begins to beep softly and new information
glows into existence in the holotank. Akhouw turns to see what has
happened; maybe some action by the rogue scouts? As his eyes comprehend
the information in front of him, Akhouw is in shock. His whisper is
succinct. "Ihel taih iy\'airl... (O, what danger has come...)"

He turns to his communications officer, urgency reflected in every
syllable. "QUICKLY, Aiwi, short tight-beam burst, ALL SHIPS IN RANGE,
the following message -- \'MOST URGENT: Hostile Imperial Fleet leaving
jumpspace, this system. Twelve ships. CONSIDER IMMINENT DEFENSIVE
ACTION.\'" Turning to his own station, he punches up a comm panel and
commandeers a communicator. Directing it to the shuttle, he transmits
on the Emergency Channel. "Admiral Nanadh -- request immediate conference!
Urgent that we coordinate. Respond please."

Akhouw gazes at the holotank yet again. His fear is gone, replaced by the
confidence of his race. "So much to gain," he mutters, "and if it must
be paid for in the blood of an usurper, so be it." He growls in anticipation
of glory yet to come.

N: "Well it\'s about time you got here!"

A: (walking into the bridge looking very refreshed and eneergized)
   "What\'s been happening?"

N: (getting up to leave)
   "Nothing much.  Looks like the Bernoulli rescue is coming
   along nicely. The Aslans are still on intercept course and there
   seems to be some sort of communications going on."

A: "Maybe there won\'t be a fight after all."
   (talking over her shoulder as Nikki leaves) "By the way, I\'ve
   drawn up  a bath for you!"

N: (grining ear-to-ear) "That\'s great! I knew you were good for
   something."

"And based on his predilection for cybergear," Vouf sighs, 
"I\'d say your patient is partially responsible."

He sighs again, and turns to Tweel (if he\'s conscious) or Oscar (if Tweel
isn\'t). "I would HATE to have to blow this ship up and everyone on it
to safeguard my mission and the vital IISS Intel Division data your
virus accessed. But I\'ll do it, in an instant, and I can\'t be stopped.
I want to know just what you were trying to accomplish by hijacking
our ship, when you knew damned well it couldn\'t make the Jump out of here
on its own. I need alternatives to murder/suicide, gentlemen."

Tweel\'s eyes drift open and focus on the Vargr as he speaks.  His head
flips upside down to stare at him.  The focus is variying when his
attention suddenly diverts to the AGNIS camera floating over the
Subcommander\'s shoulder.

Recognition of the unit is intsantateous.  "Rrreporrrterss?...  What
are damn rrreporrrterrss doing on an IISSss ship?"

A look of pain crosses his face with sudden realization...
"WIND SHEAR!!! NO INTERVIEWS!!!!!  My ssship\'s been ssabotaged my friend
murdered and you want to know how it *FEELS!!!*"

"Ignore the AGNIS unit," Bhyarrvouf says mildly. "I stole it from an
INN newstaper as a practical joke. And speaking of sabotage, I\'d
like to know why you, claiming to be a loyal IISS member, have infected
this ship with a virus designed to take it over. We would have been 
glad to repair the Bernoulli and get it going again, once we had the
time and resources, but you\'ve forced our hand." 

He leans over the Ael Yael and says slowly and carefully, "I know you\'re
in bad shape right now, Doctor, but we need your help. How do we stop
the virus? We\'ll die out here, slowly and agonizingly or quickly and with
a very loud POP, all of us, if it can\'t be stopped. Your treatment is NOT
contingent on answering-- my colleague is a medical doctor in the finest
sense of the wors, and will do his best to help you no matter whether or
not you choose to help us."

His voice becomes insistent. "HOW DO WE STOP THE VIRUS!"

Tweel slowly recognizes the sounds being made by an irate Vargr as
\'words\' understands the problem and responds.

"You may not trrrussst me, but I have had nothing to do with thiss
virusss.  I sssee you have taken the main computer core of the Bernoulli.
In the windss I have flown, I find it verrry nessesssary for virus
prrotection.

"You will find that the Bernoulli\'s banks have vaccine programs.
Since your main computer issss crrasshed, ssubsstitute Bernoulli\'s CPU."

"Who is above us to be dropping virus prrogrrams on uss?"

Tweel raises his head.  The long neck craning around like a giant snake.

Shakily he stands on the examining table, and spreads his 5 meters of
wings.  Blood flows into the outstreched wings, pumping hard.
His talons grip the table and he takes a few exercizing strokes, the
heavy muscles of his keel and wings pumping blood and adrenalin like a
fire hose.

His wings begin to glow pale red.  Two large spots on his wings turn
from white to fire-engine red, like the eye spots on a giant butterfly.

He raises his head and screeches a hunter\'s cry that echoes in the ship.
"KEHARRRRRRR!"
"All right!  I\'ve been betrrayed!  Ssabotaged!  My besst frriend is dead!
I\'ve been Blown up!  Sshot down!  Sshut in!  Kicked out!  And generallly
sstamped on!"

"None of this was in my hands!  I could do nothing but watch it happen!
Now your ship is being attacked... Prrobably by the same KKrrreeecks that
bombed my ship and killed Macin!  But this time it\'s something I *CAN*
fight!  You there!  Varrgrr what\'ss yourr Name!  Sshow me a damn terrminal
and I\'ll kossh your Blassted Merrchant-Loving virruss!"

"The great hunter got close, he had me in his sights!  But I escaped him!
I\'ll be damned if I won\'t lead the Great Bastard a damn good chase if
he wants my head on a wall!"

"A virus loose!  Eh?!"  Tweel\'s head cranes around and fixes on Oscar.
"No sence taking chances.  Oscar, recognize Trrrweeeerrrlll, Kresssh,
Doctor!  Priority command:  Land on the floor and shut down all systems."

Oscar Sierra Foxtrot Four lowers quickly to the floor with a resounding
clang and shuts down.

"Triple Three!  recognize Trrrweeeerrrlll, Kresssh, Doctor!  Priority
command:  ECM to maximum alerrt sstatuss!  Cut all power to interrnal
weapon ssysstemss!  In case of unauthorized acccesss you are dirrected to
sshut down *ALL* ssysstemss and ssubssidiariess.
Now Get me ssome food!  I\'ve rregurrgitated enough to feed thirrty ssixess
of nesstlingss!"

Tweel\'s head snaps round at \'Vouf with a glare of fire and a blaze in
his voice. "You! Varrrgrrr!  I don\'t carrre if you trrrusst me orr not!
Get me a terminal so I can fight!  KEHARRRRR!!!"

Bhyarrvouf watches the Ael Yael\'s outburst with a mixture of alarm, 
interest, and dawning respect. He nods slowly.

"So you can fight, hrrrrm?" He grins, displaying long white teeth.
"From one born prey-killer to another, those are words I\'ve missed
hearing."

He heaves up the CPU unit onto the table in Sickbay. "You\'ll work in
here," he says briskly, "So the Doctor can keep an eye on you. You 
may FEEL like killing a Crested Jabberwock bare-handed, but you\'re
still weak." He indicates a huge duffel bag on the floor near 333.
"Your robot cleared out your personal effects," he says. "You should
find your computer gear in there. Failing that, I\'ve rigged a special
system to do some exploratory work of my own." He holds up a small
hand-computer. "No I/O except one port. Keypunches in, screen display
out. No chance for mischief."

He hooks up the CPU to the unit and types, saying the words out loud.

"Hi there...me again...comfy?" 

He barks a loud laugh, and waves a hand to the CPU. "Trust breeds trust,
Doctor Ter-Weerl." He cocks a thumb at himself, and Tweel notices for the
first time that both of his arms are encased in gleaming metal to the
elbows. "I\'m Bhyarrvouf, IISS retired--among other things. Call me \'Vouf.
My aenrra with the med gear and the worried look on his face is Doctor
Sir Christian van der Merwe, IISS, Order of Starship and Crown. Here\'s
your virus. Eat him alive for us!"

He turns to leave. "The two backup computers are in pieces on the Bridge 
floor," he says. "They MAY not be infected. But be careful--Moira was
a TL-15 monstrosity of a computer, and this thing went through her defenses
like they weren\'t there. NO uplinks or radio connections to the infected 
machines. If you get hungry, you can drag in a groat before it gets col--"

He stops dead. His eyes widen. "Radio uplink," he whispers. "Kae, kakh
TSAKHA! The fleet must think we\'ve been destroyed! And with those Aslan
nearby--"

He doesn\'t finish. He\'s already running for the door.

Tweel\'s eyes fall upon the good Dr. Van Der Merwe, his head turns upside
down fixing the Doctor with an odd stare of recognition.
"Doctorrr... Van Derr Merrwe?  Chrrisstian?  What arrre you doing herrre?
And ssince when did you get wisse and trrade those Navy ingrratess for the
Ssscout sservicce?"

Tweel makes a painfully slow glide to the floor, weak and unsteady, even
in .1G, he still wobbles a bit.  "Sso I have you to thank for my life, Kh?
Well let\'ss ssee what we can do about this virruss and I\'ll rreturrn the
favorr."

"Christian, unless those mark seven medbots of yours are custom, they have
no ECM.  Unless you think they may be needed, I suggest you shut them
down.  Oscar has milgrade ECM, but I don\'t like taking chances, but I
need Triple three."

"Triple three, get my hand comp and some holochips... and get me one of the
grroats, I haven\'t been able to hold solid food for six days."

"Commander \'Vouf, I seriously doubt that the other two computerr assemblies
are free of a virus.  After all the purpose of a trrinarry computer
system is that all thrree rrun in parrallel cross checking their answerss.
When one CPU\'s answerrs are inconssisstant with the otherr 2, it iss out voted
by those two.  If one is conssisstantly inconssisstant, it is sshut down for
rrepairrs.  Now you know your system betterr than I, where do you suggesst
we sstarrt?"

A: (yelling into the air) "NIKKI!"

N: (abruptly broken out of her reverie, slips and almost
   drowns herself)
   (climbing out of the jacuzzi, and thinking to her self \'This
   had better be good.\')

A: "The Aurora just went dead!"

N: "What?"

A: "No EM signals whatsoever are coming from her."

N: "Arby. Do a full scan of the ship."

A: "We\'re still a little to far for the other sensor.
   (noticing that Nikki, bending over the console, is still 
    dripping wet from her bath)
   "Hey! Watch it! You\'re dripping all over the console! Go dry
   off and get some clothes on!"    

N: (straightening up with hands on hips, glaring at Aurelia)
   "You called me up here! Besides a little water won\'t hurt
   anything."
   (looking back at the sensor display)
   "Did the Aslans do someting?"

A: "No. Not a thing. The Aurora was separating from the Bernoulli
   and a few minutes later, nothing."

N: "Let\'s call the Westwind."

A: "Right. They can back us up while we go in."

N: "My thoughts, exactly."
   "Westwind. This is Gemini Arbiter..."

A: "I\'ll start the maneuvering. YOU, go get some clothes on!"

N: "Oh, all right!" (mumbling under her breath) "You DID call me
   up here! Ruined my bath!  grumble, grumble, grumble"

   "No thrust, just drifting, power plant looks like it\'s still

   Hell-of-a time to start maintenance on electronics!"

N: (looking a litte better) "Anything new?"

A: "No. Still the same."

N: (settling into her station) "Interesting scan report. Well,

Aurora
- ----
The Aurora glides silently through the inky blackness, still straight and
true for the rendezvous but no longer accelerating. "One problem at a 
time," Bhyarrvouf pants, hauling a huge tangle of gear out of the airlock
and gingerly making his way out onto the hull of the Scout. The Bernoulli 
is already barely visible behind them, and ahead of them is the occasional
flare of thruster plates against the impossible green band of the Ring.

"A pretty theoretical problem," he pants to himself as he works. "Two 
misjumps into the same area of space in the same week." With a grunt, he
attaches a set of bootclamps to the hull, and fastens himself securely
down. "Postulate a 36-parsec-radius sphere of known space." He begins
to wire components together carefully. "Given troop and civilian 
movements, number of ships in the sky, and problems with nav control,
missed maintainance and fuel supplies, two misjumps SOMEWHERE in that
sphere are quite reasonable." He connects a cable to a power conduit.
"Ergo, we may conclude that something in R-Alpha\'s construction serves
as a strange attractor in the Jumpspace n-dimensional manifold, causing
a focussing effect upon the normally misdirected high-quantum Jump
continua." He makes a delicate adjustment, checks a sight readout.
"In other words, a misjump magnet of cosmic proportions."

He pauses, panting. "That means that this big krafla-hoop has been sucking
in ships for millenia, and we STILL haven\'t heard about it until now."
He pauses. "I could win the Germantown Award or the Ishagga Prize if
I could figure out how it does that. And hey! That means R-Alpha will
be swarming with marooned spaceers looking for something like the 
Alcyon! Now THERE\'S a pleasant thought." 

Finally done, he hefts his jury-rigged monstrosity to his shoulder and
sights down it. In anything other than zero gravity it would be impossible
to lift, a cannibalized communication system wired to a high-gain antenna
and a huge laser cannon. It dwarfs him as he scans the horizon. "Pretty 
little problem, in its own way," he whispers. "Like hitting a moving
starship with a laser pulse at half an AU with no computer to help you."

Wavering ever so slightly, the crosshairs settle on the Kingfisher.

"God, I hope you\'re listening, Zben," \'Vouf mutters, pulling the trigger.

*click*

A slight pan to the left, and there is the Paladin, dead in his sights.

"Charyn, PLEASE don\'t be asleep on the job...." *click*

And the Korondor Talisman, off to the side....

He hesitates, then turns away. "Nah," he sighs, "Too busy to listen."

Several seconds of scanning the skies ahead, and there is the slim
wedge of the Gemini Arbiter, a long way off.

"Worth a try, assuming those bitches know bytes from barbecue...." *click*

And last but not least, all the way across the ring, barely visible, the
tiny moving speck that is the Westwind.

"No chance, right? Kakh, I feel lucky." *click--PAF!*

"Hrm?" \'Vouf notices a puff of gas crystallizing into ice at his shoulder.
He quickly examines himself and the device. "Blew the lasing tube on that
last one, you stupid old wolf," he mutters. "Unless we get the damn 
computer up and running, we won\'t have a second chance." He turns back
to the airlock. "Not that the FIRST one was worth all that much...."

As he climbs down to re-enter the ship, he starts to sing to himself.

"I\'ll send an SOS to the world
I\'ll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone reads my
I hope that someone reads my
Message in a bottle...."

The airlock shuts, and the sky is still once more.

Gemini Arbiter

"Westwind. This is Gemini Arbiter."
"Hi Nick, this is Nikki. We\'re going in to see what\'s the problem
with the Aurora. As you\'ve probably noticed, we don\'t have any
ship-to-ship weapons  so we would like to suggest that you cover
us while we check out the Aurora."
"Together we might be able to figure out what\'s happening without
getting killed."
"Gemini Arbiter. Out."


- ----
Paladin
- ----
The sensors record a flash from the Aurora.  Simultaneously, Charyn,
who has tightly coupled herself to the sensor array emits a groan and
falls to the floor.  Limner\'s console, with the psi detection program
running, starts flashing, in bright yellow,  *UNIDENTIFIED* over and
over.

Automatic relays pass the data immediately on to the Kingfisher and 
to the Alycon.

The main computer, a TL16 glory of human engineering, slows for a 
moment, and the lights dim...

Making no noise, but moving as though fire, Goughzar goes for the 
manual controls and starts activating backup systems that were 
isolated from the main.


- ----
Aurora
- ----
"Precisely my point," \'Vouf sighs. "If they all MEAN that stuff about
\'the peace of the cosmos,\' maybe we\'ll LIVE through this...."

Leaning against the bulkhead, Christian mutters "Peace? That would be
a first." A note of anger appears in his voice. "Turnskaad lures us all
aboard with a beguiling tale of mystery and untold potential for
scientific discovery. Yet at every *damn* turn, we find death, violence,
sabotage, more threats, danger, on and on and ON, dammit. If it wasn\'t
for the importance of this discovery, well, aenrra, I\'d be sorely tempted
to tell \'Skaad to zark off and go my own way..." Christian subsides into
a tired pose, the strain of recent events clearly wearing him down.

"Opinions, Doctor? We may have no choice in the matter. Christian?"

Christian shrugs. "I figure if it was going to kill us, by design or by
accident, we would have known that by now." Despite his weariness, a
spark of curiosity is evident in his voice. "Communication, fellow
sophonts, is key. If we cannot or should not stop this being, clearly
we must try and ensure that we reach some sort of understanding."

Concern returns to shadow Christian\'s face. "Of course, it is clearly
curious, but even curiosity can kill if allowed to grow unbounded. If
it is open to persuasion, perhaps we can convince it to exercise some, ah,
discretion."

"Hrf? Oh!" \'Vouf lifts a gauntlet and performs a subtle hand motion.
"Disarmed," he says happily. "I was kinda HOPING I wasn\'t gonna hafta
blow us up...."

Startled, Christian shoots a questioning glance at \'Vouf. "You were
ready to destroy all of us?" Christian is surprised; the knitting of
his brows and his vocal tone indicates unhappiness. His next cutting
remark is wholly unexpected. "When I go to meet Charissa, I don\'t want
to arrive in a surprized daze of suicide stupidity." His hurt expression
is more eloquent than any spoken words. He looks at \'Vouf and his gaze
wavers. Christian turns silently and stalks off to his stateroom in
search of solitude.

He staggers to his feet and throws a careless salute at the computer.
"I know when I\'m beat," he giggles. "Yes, SIR! Repairs proceeding at ONCE,
sir!"

He opens the sickbay door, laughing, "Come on, Hunter-Above! There\'s a
dozen groats that\'re gonna go moldy if we don\'t eat\'em. We may as well
have a last meal while we put Junior back together...."

>From the direction of the small but complete galley, the varied smells
of a meal in progress slowly waft along the corridors, along with the
faint sounds of clattering cookery. The odors vaguely suggest a cooked
synthosteak with a side of spicy, sauced vegetables. The noises subside
into Christian\'s stateroom, followed by a nearly inaudible *snick* as
the door closes and locks.

For the first time in \'Vouf\'s memory, the voice of Christian Van Der
Merwe is not heard aboard the Aurora. Usually, Christian is bantering
with \'Vouf or conversing with Moira or simply engaged in some sort of
activity.

The silence is deafening.


- ----
Westwind
- ----
"Westwind to Gemini Arbiter.  I don\'t know how to break this to you,
Nikki, but we\'re not armed either.  I\'d strongly recommend that you
keep your distance from the Aurora -- at least until we get a clearer
idea of what\'s happening.  Those Turnskaad guys might get very touchy
if they think we\'re meddling with one of their ships.  They may
prefer to deal with it themselves.  Maybe we should ask Admiral Ger
if he wants us to investigate."


- ----
Aurora
- ----
"Basically," \'Vouf smiles, "The company lawyers think I\'m working on you
to sign a contract joining our mission. If you work with the two of us,
it\'s not likely that there\'ll ever be a need to actually hand over the
paperwork. Of course, you legally can\'t be paid for your part, but if
your pride won\'t let you subcontract out to merchants, well, tough."

Tweel listens to \'Vouf\'s news in stunned silence.  Merchants...  A whole
damn fleet of them.  The battle for Jayelya was not that long ago.

Aels with percussion cap revolvers vs. human mercenaries with battle
dress and fusion guns.  The slave camps.  Genocide.  Wing clipped
slaves forced to mine the floor of the glittering sea.  All under the
eyes of the Megacorps.  All in the name of profit.

Tweel\'s wings turn fireengine red as he listens in silence.  He raises
his eyes to look at a ceiling that is much too close for comfort.
Oh for the skies of Jayelya...

He answers absently, "What?  A lawyer?  Sign Papers?"

Lawyers.  The most dangerous enemy.  Even when the Aels had practically
driven the merchants from the surface at a horrible loss of lives, the
companies lawyers fought to make certain that Aels were not seen as
intelligent beings...

Grandfather and his old recipie book, He did say barbequed Lawyer was
the best dish he\'d ever had...

Tweel\'s brain raced with crazy thoughts.  Maybe he could kill them all
before they got him.  Maybe OSF-4 could swing the battle.  Turn the Aslan
against them...

But that mightn\'t help R-Alpha from becoming another slave labor camp
run by insane profitteering merchants.  Great Hunter, why do humans
threaten the entire galaxy?  Humans and their stupid \'Governments\'
No, they still have the herd insticts, but perhaps not enough.  They
kill members of their own herds.  No, Humans are NOT civilized.  The
Rebellion has shown that humans will never be able to handle the
freedom of anarchy as Aels enjoy.

But they do realize this.  One of their philosophers said,
"The government that governs best, governs least."  But they can
never be ready for true freedom.

This corporation must not exploit the sophonts of R-Alpha.  Sure, let
them trade, but if they try their old slaver tactics...  But how can I
stop them?  Need more information...  I need to verify the truth of this
Vargr\'s words.

Tweel\'s voice is toneless evan as his talons claw absently at the air.
"Verry well, Misterr \'Vouf...  I will sign
these papers you speak of...  But first I want more evidence than just
your word on the matter...  Chrristian\'s testimony also...  Under scan
by Oscar\'s NAS scanner.  Then, I\'ll KNOW the truth of where you stand."

"Trriple Thrree, go and rreactivate Oscar and brring him herre.
I need him here now..."

Tweel sits silently as 333 rushes off to the deactivated warbot.

Aslan Pinnace

"Admiral, I respectfully must request that you give me the coordinates 
of the enemy fleet again.  My feeble sensors cannot distinguish it from 
the background of deep space."


- ----
Aurora
- ----
The Aurora\'s EM signature is back, as if it were never gone.
A moment later, a coded datapulse from the Aurora is received
by the Kingfisher, the Korondor Talisman, the Paladin, the
Trakh, and even the Gemini Arbiter and Westwind. Some pulses
are encrypted in the agreed-upon codes; messages to the Aslan
and the two new ships are in clear Galanglic.

Doejin eventually manages to persuade Ferdy to make himself useful
by operating the sensors.
 
"Doejin!" cries Ferdy.  "The sensors are lighting up like a school
of chatrasti fish!  There are ships all over the place!"
 
Eventually Ferdy calms down a little and starts to give Doejin some
details of what ships are where.

At Ferdy\'s quick identification of several more ships joining the area
the curiosity of the situation is soon displaced by unease in Doejin.

"Ferdy, you may know someone on one of these ships, and I would love to meet
these visitors, but now, I feel a fire in my flukes and it isn\'t pleasant!
Which one of these ships has your friend?  Maybe we can get his ship to come
to us.

Ferdy indicates one of the ships on the sensor displays.  "He\'s in that
one.  The one the humans call \'Talisman\'."

I am going to give a little distance between us and these vessels.  I have
never seen it so crowded out here.  Plus, I haven\'t been this far out since
I took my first solo in a maintenance craft!"  (Oops, let that one slip! With
a small blush from Doejin, it was one of the few brief irresponsible actions of
his youth.)

Doejin pilots the craft perpendicular to the line of intersection between as
many of the other ships as possible while waiting for the answer from Ferdy on
the location of his friend.  The maneuver is done with full maneuver capability
plus any extra Doejin can coax with his psi.



- ----
Trakh
- ----
Akhouw notes the maneuver with interest. Exclaiming to the bridge in general,
he shouts "Ftahlr! You see, this one? An alien with intelligence. Only a fool
stands his ground between two armed khtea." Akhouw chuckles. "An interesting
trip so far, all around..."


- ----
Talisman
- ----
Aslan?  ASLAN?!?  Here?  Already ON the r-alpha macrostructure?
Military, it looked, despite some EM camoflage.  They didn\'t seem capable of
the subtlety involved in faking the other ships, not without outside help,
particularly not without humans to set up the voice simulation models at the
least.  The Ael Yael...  doubtful anyone but another Ael Yael or somebody
closely associated with one for many years would be able detect a fake, but
the information from the Bernoulli appeared accurate.

The Aslan approach seemed aggressive, if not openly hostile.  And
the Turnskaad expedition had a few scouts, a far trader, a tender... nothing
up to real naval standards.  Perhaps it would be better to deal from a
position of strength.  Or, at least, from the *appearance* of a position of
strength...

With the thought Ralf was outside the hull of the Talisman, clinging
to the fringes of the datasphere.  A blue-glowing line reeled out towards
the Aslans, spiked tip arrowing ahead across the unfathomable space.
Seconds of inactivity crawled by until Ralf "felt" the impact of the
grapnel, the shock reverbrating back up the line.  The light-speed delay
would be a serious problem, requiring steps he hated to take, but needs
must... Ralf offloaded some of his mental processes onto his chip and
wrapped them in code, then slid the heuristics package "down" the line
towards the Aslan ship.  Again, the seconds crawled by...

Then he felt the tug on the line.  He let it pull him, paying out
more line behind him to maintain the tenuous connection to the Talisman,
then "dove" out into space, freefalling alongside the line.  A peculiar mix
of timeless falling and instantaneous distortion, of "pouring" himself
through an all-too-narrow aperture to another location, and then he was
there, in the buffer space at the fringe of the Aslan datasphere, watching
the interplay between the two ships.  A stroke of luck, that.  The telemetry
and encrypted communications between the two meant they had to be somewhat
"open" to incoming signals, which in turn meant he had barely enough space
for the foothold his heuristics package had secured.

And now... press here, manipulate there... catch an incoming data
package and strip away the stale encrypted code (why are military minds
*so* predictable?) to replace it with a bootstrap, then pass it smoothly
back into the flow of information and watch it sink into the defenses of the
Aslan datasphere, absorbed harmlessly.  Moments later, a segment mutated in
the crystal geometry his mind used to visualize the datasphere defenses.  A
split, then an opening, and a slender thread he could latch onto and ride
down into the Aslan sphere.

Hm... intriguing.  The cores were well-defended, too tricky to
penetrate without risk of detection, which could set off a full-blown
battle.  The Aslan\'s sensors, on other hand, had to be on the fringes of the 
datasphere - defined the perimeter of the datasphere, in fact.  And what you
perceived, might as well be real...

Westwind
- ----
Talon is taking a shower when Hur\'Shurvan\'s voice comes floating over
the Westwind\'s PA system.
 
"Nicholas, I have been monitoring radio traffic in the system..."
 
"Yeah?  Any answer to my call yet?"
 
"Not yet.  I don\'t believe there has been enough time for a turn-
around. But I have received something which I think you should come
up to the bridge and listen to."
 
"Oh.  Umm... Is it urgent?"
 
"Yes, I\'m afraid it is quite urgent.  Sorry to interrupt you."
 
"Ok.  I\'m coming."  Talon turns off the shower and steps out.  He
grabs a bathrobe and wraps it around himself as he strides towards
the exit of his stateroom.  The door swishes open and he steps out
into the corridor, still dripping wet.  He stifles a curse as his
bare feet give him a cold reminder that the corridor is not carpeted.
 
A few steps take him to the bridge where Hur\'Shurvan is waiting for
him.  "Let\'s hear it," says Talon as he slumps down into the pilot\'s
seat, trickling a small puddle of water onto the floor.
 
"First," says Hur\'Shurvan, "I would like to play you some other
messages in order to give you some sense of context."
 
Talon nods assent, and Hur\'Shurvan begins to play back various
messages that have been coming in.  Most seem to be some very
confusing goings-on involving a semi-conscious Ael Yael and a
semi-demented Vargr.
 
"Now we come to the important one," says Hur\'Shurvan.  He plays the
distress broadcast from the Gemini Arbiter.
 
Talon listens intently.  As the recording progresses, his eyes light
up and a broad grin begins to grow slowly on his face.  "What IS going
on here, Shurv?  Some sort of convention?"
 
"I have managed to get a fix on the Gemini Arbiter," says Hur\'Shurvan.
"If our sensors can be trusted, then ours is the closest vessel.  If
we alter course immedately, the computer has estimated that we can reach
it in approximately thirty-seven hours.  We should go to assist at
once, Nicholas."
 
"I\'m way ahead of you, Shurv."  Talon\'s hands are already playing
across the console in front of him.  "Computer..."
 
+++ ready +++
 
"Open a hailing frequency to the Gemini Arbiter."
 
+++ hailing frequency open +++
 
"Attention Gemini Arbiter.  This is ISS Westwind responding to your
distress call.  We are plotting an intercept course.  ETA... oh,
something like thirty-seven hours.  Hope you can hold on for us to
arrive.  My name\'s Nick, by the way."
 
Talon closes the channel and turns to Hur\'Shurvan, still grinning.
"Shurv, I think I might just get to like this system..."

Aurora

Things were finally starting to quiet down on the Aurora.  The distress call
of the Bernoulli was answered, and its sole survivor now in the capable hands
of Dr. Van Der Merwe.  Now the crew could stop for a moment and take stock of
their rather unusual, and certainly unexpected, situation.  Calm was
beginning to prevail once more...

Then, a barely noticable flicker in the lights; a small crackle on one of
Moira\'s monitors.  Something was happening...

_Integration sequence initiated._

<Alert.  Unauthorized access attempted to main CPU.>

Bhyarrvouf is a black and white blur of motion. In a flash, he has the access
plate off the main avionics bay.

_Override alert status.  Execute phase two integration sequence._

<Alert.  Alert.  Alert.  Activate anti-hijack program.  Security overlocks
being breached.  Alert.>

Two hard pulls on two fiber optic cables, and the two backup computers for 
the Aurora are forcibly offline. A metal fist bangs down on the EMER HALT
buttons, and their memory packs jettison onto the deck with a clatter.

_Cancel alert.  Belay anti-hijack sequence.  Initiating final integration
sequence._

<Alert.  Anti-hijack program deactivated.  Security compromised.  Loosing
control...>

A swipe of a hand, and the main I/O port to the main computer is severed.

_Control of main CPU achieved.  Executing diagnostic._


"Diagnose away, motherhumper," Bhyarrvouf growls, grabbing the main power line
in one hand and ripping out the backup powercells with the other.

A few seconds more pass.  All computer controls freeze.  The monitors now
show only the last message displayed, "_Control of main CPU achieved.
Executing diagnostic._"  Fifteen seconds later, a new message replaces the
old, only this time, it is accompanied by a calm, flawless voice:

_Attention Aurora crew.  Do not be alarmed.  All necessary life-support
functions are operating normally.  Full function will be restored as soon
as diagnostic is complete and analysis made.  After that, appropriate
measures will be taken._

"Oh, I\'ll just BET they will," Bhyarrvouf says, destroying the last backups.

During this time, every computer system and sub-system goes through its
standard self-diagnostic.  Additionally, the main CPU delves into its
memory core, seemingly searching all files at once.  Names of programs and
files scroll down the screens at amazing speed.  Then, a few moments later,
the monitors clear once again and this message appears, fully narrated by the
same smooth voice as before:

_Attention Aurora crew.  A full diagnostic sweep of your ship has been
completed and appropriate repairs are being undertaken.  Despite many
inefficiencies, all systems are functional.  Everything is under control._

"Control THIS!" Bhyarrvouf rips out the last cable, and every system on the
Aurora goes dead. The computer, its backups and power reserves severed 
beforehand, is completely disconnected from EVERYTHING, and only the charge
in its capacitors is keeping its data alive for a few short minutes.

A single headlamp comes on, and Bhyarrvouf, whistling, attaches asmall power
cell to the mangled computer. He then inserts a holocrystal into his gauntlet,
types for a while, then ejects the crystal and loads it into the main
computer\'s system software port.

The crystal contains a few lines of text.

NEVER PISS ME OFF. SIT TIGHT WHILE WE DECIDE WHETHER TO KILL THE AEL YAEL
AS A POTENTIAL HIJACKER.

All telemetry from the Aurora goes dead.

"Christian?" \'Vouf\'s voice is heard only over the commo link. "Keep your
suit on at all times, and I\'ll have power back to you in a second. That
bastard you\'re working on injected a virus into Moira. We\'ve got control
of the Aurora back, but I had to scuttle her in the process. Until I can
clean the virus out, we\'re on manual for EVERYTHING."

"Let me know when you have the Ael Yael awake," he finishes with a growl.
"I want to hear him scream when I clip his wings. Hijack MY ship, will he?"

Witfield notices hailing sequence coming in. Pushing a few
buttons, the red square narrows into the Aslan ship. Looking up
on the holodisplay, the computer identified the transmission as
standard Imperial acknowledgement code. Witfield pushes another button,
sending the standard Imperial code <Please standby>.

"Commander, we are being hailed by the Aslan ship. They are using
standard Imperial acknowledgement code, and wants to have 
visual contact." Witfield says. "The ship is identified as "Combat
Exploration Vessel *Trakh*, Clan Khaukeairl"


Good. Mr Witfield. Just a moment.

Talisman

Thul upon hearing the word that a craft of Aslan origin in inbound swears 
a mighty oath and his hands start flying over the console.

He has downgraded the derilict ship\'s fire control solution to a secondary
and upgraded the inbound Aslan craft to primary.... 

The fire control system has been taken out of standby and is now on active.

A few more button presses and the turrets are locked on target.

"Korondor Talisman to command vessel... I am standing by for orders... 

This ship is in full readiness status. over."



Dashing off into her cabin, Alliara opens a flat box and gently removes a
harness with a holodisplay on it. Laying it on the table and arranging near
it the hand comp, the CLT, the text recorder and a number of optic data
cables, she prepares for war.

"Data mux, cable 1 to hand comp, cable 2 to CLT, cable 3 to texrec, cable
4 to datahud."

Arranging the head harness carefully, and testing the eye-piece, Alliara 
mutters "Lester Farouk, eat your cutlass - my eyepatch is flashier now." and
hangs the text recorder and the handcomp on the belt.

Finally, opening a side compartment in the CLT box, she removes two holo
crystals, slots them into the text recorder and the CLT itself.

"Communication and contact section. Niigurd here. Aslan language translator
and text recorder, ready. Am ready for contact for Aslan. Request permission
to station myself on bridge. Over."

Opening the door, Alliara pauses for a moment, then returns to the boxes and
takes two more crystals.

"Niigurd here. Zhodani and Vargr language translators ready, too. Over."

Slamming the door behind her, Alliara heads towards the bridge, holographic
eye-piece glinting balefully in the ship-light.


Redd :
"Ok, bringing powerplant to  full  output.  Remember  we\'ve  no  re -fuel
arrangements yet."

Shortly afterwards, as the Talisman\'s rising neutrino signature indicates
the powerplant being brought to life -

"THULE ! What the H**L did you do to this ship ?
 I thought that powerplant wasn\'t standard fitting - why didn\'t you *tell*
 me what I\'m supposed to be running, I\'m not a bl**dy Zho\' you know ! "

The neutrino signature of the Talisman continues to rise, beyond that normally
expected of a 200t merchant, mutterings from the drive-room continue.

Mr. Farouk, would you please cross over to the fighter
[Which for those of you who may not have known, is docked to the
command shuttle] and warm up the weapons and drive to standby status.

Please connect me to them, visual and audio.

"Yes sir." Witfield pushes a button on the monitor.
A blue square zooms in on the Aslan ship, flashing as a line is
drawn from the command shuttle to Alcoyn then to the Aslan ship.
"Hailing Frequence open sir. Visual and audio."

To the captain of the "Trakh", greetings. This is Count Nanadth
Nggemen Ger, Admiral of the Darrian Navy (Retired), and Commander
of the Aurora exploration Team. We are in this system following up 
on earlier explorations of our Company. What are your intentions
in this system?

We have reason to believe that a hostile force is on its way
here anytime between now and the next 4 months. We are prepared to
defend the Ringworld against any such threat.


All telemetry from the Aurora goes dead.

RED ALERT! All hands to battle stations. Full Security precautions, 
Limit all communications to emergency and battle channels now!
Place all weapons on active status. Prepare for emergency
depressurization.

Zben literally whirls in his seat at the sensor/commo station. He
slaps a control "Computer, Blaine, one-niner-one-five-niner! Execute
program Red Alpha!" Turning to Witfield, "Sorry, but that\'ll set up
everything, and redirect commo to Alcyon to a tightbeam, and alert
Morgan on the Alcyon as to our status."

He then secures his Vac-suit, and builds a tight but passive
sensor watch on the Aurora. This he puts on full record, and then
checks the sensor scan for the Aslsn ships and the Aurora for the last
few minutes. "Commander? We\'ve registered no activity that could
indicate a standard weapons discharge in the the area of the Aurora,
or the Aslan ships..."

At the sensor console, Johann double-checks that all active sensors are off.
Frantically working the trackball-crosshair over the holographic heads up
display he places color-coded markers on each contact. The Alcyon and the 
shuttles sister-vehicles get a blue marker each, except the Aurora which also
get a little red emergency triangle. Ships and vehicles originating from R-
alpha is awarded gold markers, the aslan ship a red marker and the assorted
misjumped jokers silver markers.
  
"All sensors on passive, scanning for lockon."
  
Then he tells the computer to try to acheive passive lock-ons and passive 
solutions good enough to feed the weapons consoles on all targets. While the
lock-ons and solutions start to arrive, he makes several general scans of the
area around to see if anything suspicious is going on.
  
"No other activites, it seems."


Etienne takes a deep breath and visibly forces himself to relax and 
release all of the tension of the past couple of hours.  His voice becomes 
flat and emotionless, his face expressionless but his fingers continue to 
move over the controls with their accustomed dexterity.

"Evasive programs loaded and ready, Sir.  Should I order pre-combat 
decompression?"  He turns to his sensor operators: "Has anyone called up 
the specs on the Aslan ship?  What armament?  What\'s it\'s drive capable of? 
Armor?"

Returning his attention to Commander Ger: "Just in case we have to fight, 
Sir, do we stick it out or run and hide?"  Neither Etienne\'s voice nor his 
expression give away any idea which he would prefer.

<Ger>
Mr. Whitfield is the Aurora still intact? What can you tell me about
her status?

"Checking sir." Witfield moves a yellow square to zero in
on Aurora. "Aurora, this is the command shuttle. Please report 
status." He waits for reply.

In the mean time, "Computer, please perform a scan on Aurora.
and report sitution." I\'ll relay all results to the commander.

When all markers have gotten their thick borders indicating lock-ons, 
Johann starts passing this data out through the shuttles databus and 
tells the computer to immediately blow the whistle if any target starts
 misbehaving.
  
"Sensors to guns, target data online, blue are friendlies.
   
Sensors to conn and guns, incoming fire data online, no incoming now, but
the computer will tell you if it comes, and give solutions to defensive
batteries and predict trajectories to recommend evasives."

Responding to the general excitement, Bit has started to run around in the
hard helmet Johann has hooked up to the lifesupport. Now he has managed to get
enough speed to suddenly topple the helmet down on the controls, pressing 
several of them in the process. While the helmet containing the frantic treerat
bounce around on the floor tethered to the console by the life-support tube,
all sensor-filters switch off and the holohud of the sensor console fill with
random colors and patterns at the same time as the speaker on the console
spew out all the communications the sensors intercept, at the same time.

Swearing about excited tree-rats, Johann manage to calm down the hud rather
quickly, but the noice remains.
  
"Zben! cut the incomming commo to my console until I\'ve sorted this bloody
mess out!!"

Trakh

"Aiwi, full active scans, all ships, NOW. Prepare to engage counter-measures
on my signal. Contact the Kingfisher on Imperial Emergency Channel. Demand
an immediate explanation for this provocation."

"I\'m on it sir.  Counter-measures awaiting your signal.  I am trying to raise
the Kingfisher sir, for their own good, I hope they answer."

As the Red Alert hits, Zar instantly tenses on the bridge. Upon receiving full
orders and watching the Aslan and Skaad fleet light up with turret weapons on
the sensor panels.

"Charyn!!! Return to your post at once! Azani, prepare all stations in full
security. Check on Dr. Limner and make sure he is secure. Doktor, please
man whatever post it is you have - Or at least prepare in full red alert status
....  Zar slows for a minute trying to figure out Dr. Morser\'s position and
then shrugs it off.


At \'Zar\'s request, Azani makes sure that Dr. Limner is comfortable
before he leaves the bridge. A few minutes later, he arrives back 
with an arm load of equipment. He then places the equipment carefully
on the floor and proceeds to sort it.

The equipment consists of a few vacc suits (depending on who is not
wearing one), combat armor, an autoshotgun and clip harness and a
couple of power packs for his laser pistol. He then passes out a 
vacc suit to Herr Doctor and Charyn and helps Dr. Limner into his
own vacc suit. After feeling that Dr. Limner is fine, Azani then places
his own combat armor on and prepares his weapon.

Azani then looks into the viewport and waits for the next event to
occur.

As Charyn comes back onto the bridge, Zar is pulling his laser carbine up close
and strapping it to the pilots chair. His helmet is nearby and he is already
wearing a tailored vacc suit (standard IISS issue).

Dr. Tweel\'s investigation of the \'infected CPU\' denotes nothing like a virus,
or at least no kind of virus he\'s ever seen.  He does note that somehow, the
CPU has actually been rewired physically from inside.  There also appears to
be a self-sufficient communication link operating.  Examination of the other
two back-up CPUs reveals similar links, all operational and functioning.


"Sorry I took so long," \'Vouf says as he returns. "Wanted to try to get a 
data packet to the fleet saying we were all right, and without the computer
there was no laser telemetry so I had to...." His voice trails off as he
looks over Tweel\'s shoulder at the screen. 

"What in the name of the Great Pack...?"

Then, a message begins printing on the screen of the jerry-rigged hand
computer link that is connected to the suspect CPU:

_Your actions are conter-productive to the efficient operation of this
computer set-up.  I have therefore relocated to another affiliated system,
where I will attempt to co-ordinate repairs on this computer system, as well
as attempt to integrate both systems together.  Please do not repeat your
previous action, as the physical disconnection of CPUs very directly hampers
the effectiveness of the streamlining process.  There is no need to be
alarmed.  The only risk to your computers is the one that you instigate.
Please await uplink to newly acquired co-ordination location._

"Samshkarkh knaervarrgh ROUKH!" In a trice, \'Vouf bolts out of the room, 
and reports back with one of the spare CPUs. In a flash, handling devices
spring from the gauntlets and the CPU is in pieces.

His monocle glares blood-red as he pores over the circuit layout. He looks
up at Tweel, his eyes wide.

"It\'s impossible," he whispers. "The kakh thing REWIRED ITSELF!"

He slumps back in his chair, staring at nothing for a moment. Then, heaving
a gusty sigh, he sits up and says, "Well, it ain\'t no virus, that\'s for
sure. My guess is, it came from THAT," and he flicks a thumb at where the
Ring would be if the Aurora were transparent. "Which means it\'s WAY beyond
any attempts to eradicate it, it represents advances we can\'t DREAM of,
and it\'s probably harmless, given the reception we\'ve received so far."


Tweel turns his head to look at the Vargr, his head concealed inside
a grav belt helmet.  Holographic circuit diagrams dancing on the face
plate of the portable HUD.  Tiger, the small Aeloid continues to stare
at the jungle of circuitry in the Doctor\'s talons.  "I\'ve llooked at
ssome high tech stuff in my flightss, I\'ve gotten scans of the insides
of TL 17 sstuff.  I even got my talons into the remains of an ancient
computer...  This is new.  Mr. \'Vouf, if this thing wanted to kill us,
it could have done so without our ever knowing it.

"Precisely my point," \'Vouf sighs. "If they all MEAN that stuff about
\'the peace of the cosmos,\' maybe we\'ll LIVE through this...."

He shrugs violently, his Vargr good humor back in an instant. "I say we
reinstall the stupid thing and find out what it wants," he states. "Then we
can let people know we\'re OK, and maybe get moving again...."

He shakes his head. "ANOTHER Germantown Award," he whispers. "I\'m RICH!"

"Opinions, Doctor? We may have no choice in the matter. Christian?"

Tweel flips his head upside down to look at the Aurora\'s crew, "Agreed.
This little nesstling is going to fledge no matter what we do.  Rreconnecting
the Main CPU will put a tailwind in the prrocess.  Then we can live or die
fasterr depending upon where it blows us."

"This is of course unless you have plans for a Phyrrrrric victorry..."

"Hrf? Oh!" \'Vouf lifts a gauntlet and performs a subtle hand motion. 
"Disarmed," he says happily. "I was kinda HOPING I wasn\'t gonna hafta
blow us up...."

After a brief pause, a message prints on the screen of Dr. Tweel\'s hand
computer:

_Uplink to Paladin established.  You may proceed with repairs of CPU.  Once
main computer is functional, streamlining will then initiate._

The input prompt appears.

"WHA-AT?!" \'Vouf stares in disbelief at the screen. "He hotwired the
PALADIN while we weren\'t looking! That mangy little--"

He stops, then begins to snort. After a moment, he is howling with laughter.
"HEEYARF HARF HARF! Kae, that\'s beautiful--harf harf harf-- he felt we were
getting in his --hrf-- in his WAY, so he-- he-- HARF! -- HE WENT AROUND US!"
He falls flat on his rump, clutching his ribs. "And NOW he\'s got full run
of the PALADIN, which is a bazillion times WORSE than letting him have the
Aurora-- oh, I think I\'m gonna have a cramp!" He howls incoherently for a
moment more. "And now, snrk, NOW he sez, he sez: \'You MAY proceed with 
repairs!\' Oh, the NERVE! Ah, hrf hrf hrf..."

He staggers to his feet and throws a careless salute at the computer.
"I know when I\'m beat," he giggles. "Yes, SIR! Repairs proceeding at ONCE,
sir!"

He opens the sickbay door, laughing, "Come on, Hunter-Above! There\'s a 
dozen groats that\'re gonna go moldy if we don\'t eat\'em. We may as well
have a last meal while we put Junior back together...."

When the Aurora stops transmitting, Morser will get very nervous; checking
and double-checking all of the relays. When the \'mysterious voice\' says
it\'s taking over the computers, he will absolutely wig out! Trrrrweeeeeeerrrl
said HE\'S gonna \'do combat\' with this thing? He ain\'t seen nothin\' yet! 
Morser will immediately isolate his wristcomp from the ship\'s systems and
start a \'seek-and-destroy\' virus detector. As soon as that\'s done, he\'ll
hop onto the Model 10(which he not-too-secretly lusts after ;) and
run everything he can, trying to boot off the intruder, or at least keep it 
on the other two computers. If he has to, he\'ll start writing anti-virals
right online!

Tweel\'s head is buried inside the computer console as he
reconnects the main computer.  Tiger, perched on top of Triple Three
watching the goings on with some interest.

Beside him, Bhyarrvouf is reconnecting the communications equipment he\'d
cannibalized for his failed attempt at reaching the other ships. He is
humming an unidentifiable tune to himself as he works.

Tweel\'s head ducks out briefly and doffs the Helmet HoloHUD taking a
quick bite at the flank of the groat lying on the deck.  A long bloody
strip rips off as he worries at it for a moment and then throws the
flesh back into his mouth like so much spaghetti. 

"Gentlessophonts, It occurrs to me that ssomething odd is going on herre...
First you accuse me of planting the virruss, I deny it and you take me at
my word.  Surely, a good intelligence officer wouldn\'t do so.  Of course
Chrristian might trrust me, but only if he has forrgotten some of the
trricks I have pulled on him in the past."

"You wouldn\'t understand, Hunter-above," \'Vouf says, bits of raw groat
dangling from his jaws as he chews and swallows carefully. "You were
safe from the moment you woke up." He stops to chuckle to himself. 
"Lightspeed lag is hell in situations like this. They may think we\'re
dead. They may BE dead, if everyone started shooting."

"Almost ready...." He puts the coverplate back on and bolts it down tight.

Tweel then sticks his head back inside the console and continues.
"Fact A:  My ship had been sabotaged.  Fact B:  Thiss sship was also
ssabotaged.  But you allow me to aid in combatting this problem.
If I was the perpetrratorr I could easily have finished the job."

"You\'re missing data, Hunter-above," \'Vouf says mildly, fingers flying 
across the encrypter. "You\'re theorizing based on a partial set of facts. 
But do go on; I find this amusing as all getout...."

"Hypothesis:  You trrusted me because you were expecting sabotage from
another compass heading.   Apparrantly, you did Not expect it to come
from Dr. Macin\'s Rringworrld discoverry.  Therefore you expected it to
come from some other enemy.  The question is Who?  Not to mention why
is it you werre expecting them."

"Right, and wrong," "Vouf says mildly, finishing his work. He flips a switch.
With a whirr and a ping, all systems come back up again normally. He turns
a dial or two, and fires off a rapid series of datapulses to each ship in
the fleet. "Apprising them of our status," he explains. "I can\'t wait to see
the reaction on the Paladin.... Dr. Science, hrerr, I mean Herr Doktor
Morser, will have a FIT!"

"Aenrra," he tells Christian, "We\'re functional again. ORders?"

"Now, Drr. Macin, was neverr one for tight securrity, it could be that
some wind of his rresearch drifted into the hands of some Merrchant-
loverrs...  Or even some corporation or other.  I\'ll bet the corrporrations
would just Love to rride on the therrmal of this discoverry!"

"Oh, yes," \'Vouf whispers. "Oh, yes."

Tweel pulls his head out of the console and sinks his beak deep into
the side of the groat and rips out the heart with a ripping sound.
Blood runs along his beak as he wolfs the beast\'s heart.

"Now, who out there knows what we\'ve been up to?  I\'ll bet it\'s ssome
Sslaver merrchant corrp looking forr its next victims..."

"Hey, *I* wanted that piece!" \'Vouf scowls darkly at the Ael Yael. "Well,
*I* get the liver," he says petulantly. "Anyway, the thing was, I knew
you were clear from the moment you woke up. You recognized Christian,
and from that moment on, you were OK in my book. No questions asked."

"As for our suspicions, yeah, we were expecting something," \'Vouf sighs.
"It took us two Jumps to get here from our base. In those two weeks, our
mission was sabotaged multiple times, and we\'ve had several deaths and 
several more severe injuries. Your Dr. Macin wasn\'t the ONLY one interested
in this Ring-- besides us and you, there are a whole MESS of Aslan out 
there, qat least two misjumped ships stranded here, and one or more 
Imperial faction fleets not too far behind. This system is about to become
REALLY popular."

"Okay, Trrweerrrrl," \'Vouf says. "You\'ve got hookup. Time to see what our
little friend has to say to us...."

And he waits....

That works until some nutter decides to take a few grav plates out of the
ship, attach them to the ship\'s power plant via long power cables, and then
send a blackmail message to the local government.

I think it\'s just a matter of energy again.  Unless you\'ve got the mother of
all power plants, you won\'t do more than cause a slight readjustment in the
local wind patterns by using artificial gravity to move the atmosphere.

be an excellent for use in Traveller.  As for publication you could always
try it as a article in Challenge.
   Command Decision should be easier to port (since you have a Panther to
start from), but I would suggest you wait until the revised edition comes
out later this year since there will be a number of rules revisions. 
(The basic system will be the same, but after playing these for 10 years
we have found a number of better ways to do things).  In fact I just
spent the weekend in Bloomington as part of the rules revision committe
playtesting and debating all the changes.  The next project appears to be 
the pre-20th century command decision (wierd as it sounds it works, in
fact it works better than I expected).  As for Star Viking, I think it
is waiting on the Command Decision updates as well, but I would expect to
see it about next Gen Con/Origins at the latest.  Frank has decided to
go to 1/285th scale as the main focus for the game rather than the larger
scale he first envisioned.  The Star Viking rules should be very
portable into Traveller because of the common technological basis.

According a scenario in the old "Azhanti High Lightning" boxed set, that
adventure took place in about 1102.  (!!)  That scenario introduced the
character Arlanrroughl, who later appears in Traveller Adventure as one 
of Marc\'s chief aides.  The impression I got from that was that Marc is
the owner of OL, while Sergei (since 1102) has become some sort of 
general line manager.  When Marc dies, he and Zinovia will undoubtedly
inherit actual title to OL.  Maybe Sergei works the Vargr end of the firm
from _Emissary_ and the Pandrin/Uthe (Gvurrdon Sector) office while Marc
works the Imperial (now Domain) end?

Speaking of old boxed sets, anyone remember "Invasion: Earth"?  It had a
nice color map of Terra in 1000.  The "invading a planet" thread reminded
me of it -- I recall that was supposed to be considered an attack on a
"hardened" position.

the TML\'s Historian (me).

1. Gryostabilization prevents weapons from recoiling and spoiling the
aim of the shooter. Lasers have no recoil, so they don\'t need it. (Actually
the gyros don\'t PREVENT recoil, they help to control it.)

3. Marc hault-Oberlindes, Baron Feri, is the owner of Oberlidnes Lines
as of most recent references. His son Sergei is master of the EMISSARY,
the line\'s armed escort in use in the Vargr Extents. What reference
claimed Sergei was running things?

I agree, considering the total chaos in terms of time sync-ing that had been

I have a few responses, let me cover them in no particular order.

It seems to me that we are having the same conversations over and over
again, generally speaking. A lot of this got rehashed during the PLAYER vs.
CHARACTER thing. My reaction is that it is your fault for not specifying
that both were being spoofed -- if you are operating under a critical
assumption, it is important for you to SAY so, lest someone seize upon the
omission. For example, if I assume that the Aslan on the surface are being
cautious and scanning constantly for others but don\'t say so, I cannot be
heard to complain about the phin surveillance. (Just off the top of my head.)

Further, I (could) complain myself, but I accept the turn. If I were to be
contentious, I would argue that Akhouw\'s reaction was based SOLELY on the
brief and cryptic mail message Richard sent me -- having seen that the spoof
actually contained much more substance, I am convinced (and have argued to
Richard) that he wouldn\'t have done so.

Further, I think that this is Richard\'s way of resolving the situation on
a quick basis -- I had originally sent him a message which went into detail
about my objections to the situation, which covered more than the point you
correctly note was one of my objections. The way Richard has done it, I
think, speeds up the process by which the result "It is a spoof" is found.

Bertil\'s Tranq Rounds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Interesting, and I like the idea very much, but perhaps too powerful to be let
loose in the hands of player characters.  For my own games, I\'d make a few
changes.  First off, make combined add-ons have a minimum TL of one higher than
the highest TL of any of the add-ons singly.  Secondly, Coctail would be TL13
for two races, TL14 for three, TL15 for four, and so on.  By the way, Humaniti
and Vargr count as one race for my purposes.
 
The example given: DoseControl; Coctail vs Humaniti/Vargr, Aslan, Droyne,
Hivers, K\'Kree, Ael-Yel, Prt\', and Newts; and BroadSpectrum 90% would be a TL20
item (TL19 for Coctail vs 8 races, plus 1 for combined add-ons) and a price
modifier of x54.  A more reasonable round might be DoseControl, Coctail vs
Humanaiti/Vargr, Aslan and one other (Droyne?), and BroadSpectrum 50%, for a
TL15 round with a price modifier of x30.
 
 
Fleet Tactics
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Correct; Fleet Tactics is only available via the Enhanced Naval Characters
character generator.  It can be rolled on the "Staff Officer" or "Special
Assignment: Command College" tables.
 
 
Artificial Gravity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In my campaigns, there is a very complicated piece of equipment called a "Grav
Generator" (sort for Para-Gravitic Field Generator), which is connected to
"Grav Plates" (for Para-Gravitic Field Emitter Plates).  Logically enough,
these devices create and emit a Para-Gravitic field (or "Grav Field" for
short).  The design, operating parameters, and power of the generator and
plates determines the volume and shape of the resulting Para-Gravitic Field. 
 
Within the field, a mass (anything from an air molecule to a starship) behaves
EXACTLY as if it were under the infulence of gravitation due to the presence of
a mass of finite size at some finite distance.  In Grav engineering, this mass
is known as the "Virtual Mass", and it is located at a "Virtual Origin"
relative to the grav plates; the virtual mass and virtual origin are also
determined by the design of the grav generator and grav plates.  Inside the
field, the gravitation produced by the virtual mass follows all known physical
laws (like the inverse-square law) that affect the gravitation of normal
masses.  Outside the grav field, there is no effect; the virtual mass is quite
literally not there.  The edge of the field is not precisely defined, and there
are some "fringe effects"; these fringe effects affect a relatively small
volume in comparison to the total volume of the field.  In most practical
applications of grav technology, the field is only as large as needed; within
or underneath the vehicle in question.
 
As far as removing the atmosphere of a planet, it could be done, I suppose, by
building a grav generator and installing plates such that a column of air would
be inside the grav field, and by arranging the virtual mass and origin such
that it experienced no net gravitational force.  On the other hand, this
approach would require a very large grav field with lots of power input to the
generator, and a large array of plates.  Not exactly the sort of thing you
could hide, and quite vulnerable to damage.  In theory, a grav field can be any
size, but in practice, the farther away from the plate, the more nebulous and
ill-defined the field becomes.  As a referee, I would say "It might work, but
it would probably be impractical.  Have you thought about dropping rocks on
them instead?  A couple of tons of rock moving at a good clip can make quite a
decent bang, you know." ;-)
 
 
Robert Dean\'s Random Encounters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Running a free-form game requires a good amount of direction from the players;
in my most recent game, the two primary players decided (all on their own, and
with no prompting from me, no less) that they wanted to cross the entire
Imperium (we were playing in a pre-Rebellion setting) all the way from Regina
to Terra!  I personally like free-form games, both as a player and as a
referee; but there are players who don\'t do well in this situation.
 
For players who can\'t (or won\'t) do this kind of goal-setting for themselves,
probably the best way to proceed is to get them accidentally swept up in a
large, intricate plot.  The Traveller Adventure is almost a textbook case of
how to do this; for me, I normally don\'t plot in that kind of detail, its
enough to stay a jump or two ahead of the players.  Some players seem to like
to sit around and wait for the universe to "do it to them"; in such cases I
have been known to do case-studies about why it is BAD to let the other folks
have the strategic initiative (in other words, construct scenarios in which
doing nothing is the worst possible action).  Making a NPC their commanding
officer or a NPC ship owner/captain is another good way to get things moving.
 
Retaining players: this is more of a problem in a pick-up game (like at a
convention or a game-store) than a regular game.  My best device for
stimulating out-of-play interest and conversation (not to mention a good bit of
anticipation for the next session) about the game is actually a very old one. I
simply arranged to have each session end on a cliffhanger.
 
Example: "Well we got what we came for; let\'s get out of this damn cave and get
back to the ship!" ... "OK by me, let\'s go!" 
"OK, you make your way back to the clearing where you left the ship; the
inertial locator makes the task Simple, even in the dark.  Who\'s leading off?"
"OK, you arrive at the clearing, at least you think its the right clearing, but
the ship is gone!" 
"I look for the indetations the landing gear would make in the forest floor."
"OK, you find them without too much trouble; the marks are relatively fresh. 
Well, that\'s all we have time for tonight, I need to get my sleep.  See all of
you next week?"
 
Role-Playing: Perhaps the most effective way to get players to role-play is to
do it yourself.  If nothing else, adopt two different tones of voice, one for
giving game mechanics, and other mundane information, and another voice to act
as the "narrator" of the story that describes all of the scenes and action. 
Even better (although I will be the first to admit that I can\'t do this all the
time) is to role-play as many NPC\'s as possible.  Judge the results by the
things the players say in response, instead of the die rolls (I frequently use
my judgement of the player\'s role-playing instead of the dice as the other half
of "uncertain" interpersonal tasks).
 
Another strategy is to get the players to talk about their characters right
after generation.  Ask questions like "How does your character feel about his
parents? ... the service he just left?  What does he want to do next?", and so
on.  If nothing else, questions like this will get players thinking about how
their characters feel about what they are doing.  I also like putting the
characters in a moral dilemma, and seeing how they react.
 
All in all, I don\'t think you did anything "Wrong"; you and your two regular
players should have been the center of the plotting for the game, and it sounds
like you are used to more player direction than you got.  I keep a notebook
with my current plot outline, and vague notes on what the players do and don\'t
know of it.  This way I can replot the game halfway through to create a plot
twist, and be sure I haven\'t changed anything the players already know.  I also
keep notes on the NPC\'s they have met, and a list of people from the
character\'s "past" (in general, one or two per term; these can be close friends
that have lost touch, ex-lovers, ex-spouses, professional rivals, or whatever).
 
Sergi Haut-Oberlindes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sergi is Marc\'s son; Marc Haut-Oberlindes is the owner of Oberlindes Lines at
the time of "Rescue on Ruie".  The below is from the Traveller Adventure
library data (Marc and Sergi figure prominently in that book).  The Traveller
Adventure happens over a period of approximately 1105 to 1107.
 
"Oberlindes Lines: Imperial trade and transport corporation of the Spinward
Marches.  Founded in 487 in the Regine subsector, and still strongest there,
Oberlindes has recently expanded its service into many other portions of the
Marches and the Vargr Extents."
 
"Emissary: Ex-Imperial Navy Fleet Intruder of the Azhanti High Lightning class
(60,000 tons) currently in Oberlindes Lines service in the Vargr Extents. 
Somehow, Oberlindes managed to purchase the ship with its weaponry intact,
which violates Imperial regulations.  Thus, the ship is unable to return to the
Imperium.  However, the Emissary has operated successfully as an Oberlindes
flagship in the Extents and has proven effective, by the implied threat of its
presence, in protecting Oberlindes shipping from piracy.  The Emissary is armed
with a large spinal mount particle accellerator and considerable secondary
weaponry."
 
At the time of the Traveller Adventure, Serti was the commander of the
Emissary.  It was mentioned in the NPC bio data that several months agoSergi
was injured when the Kforuzeng attempted to capture the ship.  This action is
described in one of the scenarios for the Azhanti High Lightning game.  In the
scenario notes for Azhanti High Lightning, it is mentioned that Sergi and his
wife were rescued from a prison camp several years previously by a group of
adventurers.  While it is certainly possible for Sergi to have taken his
father\'s place by the "current" Imperial date, it seems unlikely to me
(although I may have missed Marc\'s obituary, though).

Package Power Plants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Package power plants are are available in a wide range of ouptut capacities at
all tech levels.  These packages are self-contained, consisting of a fusion
power plant, fuel tankage capable of  sustaining the plant for 24 hours of
maximum output, a control computer with custom software for operating the power
package, and a full set of control panels for manual operation of the plant, or
diagnostic use.  All of the components are mounted on a rugged open frame for
durability and ease of shipping and handling.  All of the units have lifting
rings, forklift slats, and hold-down attachment points for easy handling.
 
Designed for temporary or semi-portable use in various environments, these
plants are typically used by industrial or mining concerns, construction firms,
for emergency response or disaster relief, and by exploratory teams.  The
computer automatically adjusts the power output to the demand, providing fuel
efficency and trouble-free operation.  The sizes listed here are the largest
in production; many smaller units (from about 100kW on up) are also available.
 
These power systems are being installed in an increasing number of starships as
auxiliary power systems; typically to provide additional power for weapons
systems.  The shipping hardware allows easy installation in a standard cargo
bay.  Once connected to the ship\'s power grid, maintainance and operation is
easy.  The self-contained computer and controls do not burden the ship\'s
control systems.

Referee\'s Notes on the Above
 
Normally, players would encounter these units at a construction site, during
disaster relief efforts, or as part of the equipment for an exploratory mission
or mining colony.  They are not normally produced at shipyards.
 
The characters can learn that these "industrial" power units are adaptable for
shipboard use in a number of ways.  One of the most obvious is to see such a
unit installed on someone else\'s ship.  They could also find out from an
aggressive heavy-equipment salesman (perhaps when they go to purchase a
replacement for that gravitic load-lifter that the rookie deckhand totaled) or
by hearsay.
 
Unless helped by someone with experience in integrating these things into
starship power systems, the characters will have to figure out installation on
a trail and error basis.  Mechanically, it is trivial (no task roll is
required) simply load the unit into the ship\'s hold, and secure it to the deck
like any other cargo.  Connecting it to the ship\'s power distribution system is
time consuming, however.
 
        To Install an Industrial Power Unit in a Starship:
        Routine; Engineering, Int (uncertain); 2 hours.
 
Referee:  On a result of No Truth, the unit is not connected and obviously will
not work.  Have the characters check their determination, and try again (it is
possible that they may never be able to get it to work).  On Some Truth, the
unit is connected, but the automatic load sensing feature will not work right. 
In this case, the unit will appear to operate normally if under manual control;
under automatic control it will not reliably self-start when power demand
increases, and will power down randomly when it is operating.  The problem is
minor, and once diagnosed will be relatively easy to fix.  If the result is
Total Truth, the unit is installed properly, and will correctly operate in
manual or automatic modes.
 
The unit is relatively maintainance-free, although it should receive annual
maintainance (usually when the rest of the ship undergoes annual maintainance).
Damage and repairs should be handled in the same way as the ship\'s main power
plant.  
 
 
Shops and Labs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following are estimates of the volume, mass, and power requirements for
various types of labs or shops.  These are just estimates, based on what seems
about right to me, and are not really based on any real-world figures (well,
almost; the prices are based on the average real-world price per square foot
for that general type of scientific research lab).  I came up with these
numbers because a group of players was very interested in medical research. 
Rather than figure out all of the different kinds of equipment they would need,
I simply gave them a "Large and Well-Equipped" general medical research lab,
and a bunch of smaller special-purpose labs.
 
For game effects, any lab over the minimum size has all of the absolutely
critical equipment and supplies needed for a particular type of work; certainly
enough to avoid any negative DM for equipment or supplies.  A "Large" lab has a
larger variety of specialized or labor-saving supplies and equipment.  Large
labs make any type of work easier; the referee should work out a positive DM or
other bonus which will apply.  In my campaign, a "Large" lab made all tasks one
entire level of difficulty easier (in other words, Impossible became
Formidable, Routine tasks became Simple, and so on).
 
For example, a minimum-sized technical lab has all kinds of small hand tools,
electronic and electrical assembly equipment (like soldering irons and
wire-wrap guns), basic test equipment (meters, scopes, and the like) and a
store of spare parts.  A large technical lab probably has a circuit design
workstation with an attached automated fabrication machine, lots of specialized
parts and replacement modules, and all types of special-purpose test equipment
not found in smaller labs.

Find the type of lab or shop on the chart which most closely matches the
desired facility.  The values on the chart are per kiloliter of lab or shop
installed.  A lab may not be smaller than the minimum volume (in kiloliters)
given in the "Min Vol" column.  The power requirement is in addition to any
environment or life-support costs; it represents the power required to run the
equipment installed in the facility.  A minimum-sized facility can accomodate a
single worker (two could use it, but the crowded conditions would reduce
productivity).  To find out how many workers could use a larger facility,
divide its volume by the minimum (drop fractions), and subtract one; the
minimum is always one worker. 
 
A brief guide to type types of work is presented below.  This list is by no
means exhaustive.  The exact purpose of a lab, and its Tech Level should be
mentioned in the description when it is purchased or installed.  In general, a
lab can be used only for that field, or for closely related fields (referee\'s
judgement always applies).  In the case of Technical Shops, the supplied
equipment is typically Tech Level specific; again, the referee should judge
when the shop can no longer aid (typically at +/- one Tech Level).

is usually not a problem with hand computers, but could be for starship repair
bays.  Although this gets expensive, it is certainly convenient to have a shop
with an overhead crane capable of lifting the power plant bodily out of a
scoutship.

As our inimitable Historian will doubtless point out, "Rescue on
Ruie" is a different adventure entirely.  Sergei has gotten himself
imprisoned in a small nation on Ruie.  I would guess that it
takes place before the attempted hijacking of the Emissary that you
mention, as it strikes me as the sort of youthful indiscretion that
makes wonderful character background.

Subject: The Ship Generator

Hi Paul,

I got the ship generator to compile and to run by:

    1) Setting the initial allocation (INIT_ALLOC) to 2000.
    2) Setting the definition for REAL to float from double.
    3) Padding out the tbl_ent structure to 128 bytes so I could declare
       the pointer to the table as a huge pointer.

I am in the process of testing the program (compiled under MSC 6.0a) now,
and will post a copy to sunbane.engrg.uwo.ca as soon as I\'m satisfied that
I haven\'t missed anything that will potentially byte me on the butte!
(Misspellings intentional!)  <grin>

The table takes up 256K of memory as I currently have it configured, and
should run on any 640K machine.  I\'ll include a readme file with the
differnces and machine minimums before I post it.  Looks like a neat piece
of work otherwise.

No, it\'s d6d6 hexes (unless they\'ve changed that in MegaT) so
the average distance is (3.5*3.5=10.5) hexes. And since you
will most propably need 2 or 3 jumps to get to somewhere useful,
two controlled jumps-6 will be preferable. Unless you send out
a huge number of these vessels simultaneously. If you send out
50 or a hundred, then the odds are that you\'ll get your messages
20 or 25 hexes in two or three jumps. As opposed to 18 hexes in
3 jumps for a jump-6 courier...

About the safety factor: I thought there were a small, but not
insignificant, risk that any misjump would slag the engine.

Hmmm, I don\'t think the actual program isn\'t on sunbane (yet).  I was waiting
for Richard to do some user documentation for the thing.  Do people want it
put on the archive site without help text?  [ it is quite possible to struggle
through and work out how to use it ].    I should also note that the program
is just about unusable without having the ref\'s guide next to you (or having
learnt most of the ref\'s guide while typing in the tables ;-)

I haven\'t got any objections to that.

I designed this ship mostly to see how effectively such a thing could
be done.  It would be a very popular thing to build and it probably
wouldn\'t be very cost effective due to the number of ships required.

Oops, I made a slight error here.  However, it isn\'t that bad.  The mean is
better than 10.5.


Not quite that easy....the mean of a product isn\'t the product
of the means.  The result you want is:

for 1d6, average is 3.5
for 2d6, average is 7
for 3d6, average is 10.5
for 4d6, average is 14
for 5d6, average is 17.5
for 6d6, average is 21

Summing the averages and dividing by 6 gives: 12.25 hexes average mis-jump
distance.  This is possible because each of the above is equally likely.


>And since you
>will most propably need 2 or 3 jumps to get to somewhere useful,
>two controlled jumps-6 will be preferable.

Most probably you need 2 jumps,  you have an even chance (50%) of getting
somewhere in 1 jump and a 127 in 128 (= 99.2%) of getting somewhere in 2 jumps.
If you put a jump-2 drive in the ship you would have a really good chance of
getting somewhere in 2 jumps.

As seen above, this method is slightly better than two controlled jump-6s
(.25 hexes on average).  The variance is much larger and since this method
of communication requires multiple ships to be launched, you have a pretty
good chance of sending the stuff further.  You also have a nice chance of
sending is less far as well.


>About the safety factor: I thought there were a small, but not
>insignificant, risk that any misjump would slag the engine.

Maybe I\'d better include a second engine in the next redesign.

converting the last battles rules to miniature, but using the RPG rules
for PCs (the biggest failure of the Last Battles board game is that there
are no ammo rules and no conversion rules to go back and forth from the
RPG).  This is what I\'m using right now to run convention games.  For the
third issue of the Eternal Soldier newletter there will be an article on

I was in a rush when I typed my first response, and didn\'t express myself
very clearly.  Let me try again.

The original post asked what year the old JTAS Amber Zone "Rescue on Ruie"
took place in, since it was not given in the adventure.

In the old boxed game "Azhanti High Lightning", there were old-style
booklets:  Supplement 5 (on the crusier class) and a Rules/Scenario
booklet.  The Rules/Scenario book contained the Snapshot combat rules
(which is why they are occasionally referred to as the "Snapshot/AHL"
rules) and a series of scenarios set on the various crusiers, some of
which would have made interesting adventures (the Great Wine Heist of
1092 comes to mind).  "Incident VI: Brother Wolf" details the attempted
highjacking of _Emissary_ in 1105.  Sergei, Zinovia, and Arlanrroughl
get special counters.  In the description, it notes that "Zinovia is a
native of the planet Ruie and was rescued from prison there by Sergei
and a small band of adventurers three years previously."  So the Amber
Zone took place sometime in 1102.

For those who are interested:

The _Emissary_ mutiny of 1105 began when a group of vargr crew
decided to mutiny (were incited by the Kforuzeng?) in order  
to sell the ship to "one of the Vargr states more openly hostile to the
Imperium than those with which OL ordinariliy deals."  They took over
the main bridge and captured Sergei and Zinovia after a short fight,
imprisoning them under guard on one of the cargo decks.  They made two
mistakes.  First, they assumed Arlanrroughl\'s trade delegation would
support the Vargr mutineers, so they left them free.  Second, they
put the prisoners in the Deck 38 cargo hold...two decks above the 
Deck 40 auxiliary bridge, where Sergei was able to activate the 
overrides and transfer ship control to retake the vessel.

Here\'s an odd question...  Why do humans laugh?  No other animals do.
The closest that comes to mind is when a troop of primates will try to
intimidate other animals.  What behavior evolved into laughter, and is
that behavior general enough that it would be carried across the various
barriers of differing races.

The question is then no longer, \'how do the alien races laugh\' but \'DO they
laugh?\'  I admit that roleplaying an alien would get almost TOO alien
without laughter and the ability to laugh.  But in a realistic sence I wonder
if it really would happen.

Yeah, Ok, So I copied Tweel\'s laugh from The Auburn Football team\'s Golden
Eagle mascot.  (the aviary is just outside the Physics labs)  But I\'m no

Yes, but I said somewhere _useful_. You may have 50% chance of

being in range of a high-population (or high-commerce or top
administrative) world?

True. You also increase the cost of the ship.

Slghtly better to get to a random one of a number of planets
within 11-13 parsec than to get to a particular, predictable
planet within 12? Don\'t forget that your percentages are based
on the ship going in any direction after the msjump. f you want
it to go away from the information center you will have to cut
that in half  -  and as I said, whatever the percentage is, it\'s
considerable less than 50%.

Multible ships, multiple costs. And can you imagine the

Do that. And make a few cost effectiveness estimates. Don\'t
forget the cost of replacing the misjump engine every so often...

hi,
I have a Megatraveller RPG, is very nice game. I have problems to buy
the Referee\'s Compendium.
I try to buy by mail to Mail Order Hobby Shop. They tell me that game
is discontiued buy its in GDW\'91 catalog.
Can somebody recomend me a Mail store inside USA who have GDW producs?

    'body' => 'Howdy folks,

I just got a package of Robot/Cyborg design rules from GEnie, via Rob Dean.
I read through it and found that it was basically a compilation of already
published stuff collected from Book 8 Robots, 101 Robots, with some stuff
on sensors thrown in from the MegaTrav Ref\'s Guide.  (also the performance
stuff from the ref\'s guide)

But, unfortunately this did nothing to answer the questions on robot
construction I have.  Basically, all it did was to outline stuff I had been
doing already!  I did have some substantial disagreements with some of the
stuff that was new.

My questions on robots...
Pseudo-Biological Robots:  To produce a Pseudo-Bio, one makes a normal robot
design and multiplies the total weight by 1.5 and the total cost by 8.
Well, I disagree with the idea of multiplying the TOTAL by these figures.
	I can understand why this would be the case with the chassis and most
of the robots sensors.  After all, You have to fool someone into thinking that
a camera is now an eye.  A taste sensor is now a tongue.  A mechanical arm is
now a plastic covered replica of an arm with muscles and such.  A radio will
have to have it\'s anetenni disguised.  A radome will have to look like part of
a sophonts body.  All that makes sence.
	But what about parts that do not require access to the outside
environment?  A neutrino sensor?  A densiometer?  These don\'t require exterior
access.  They don\'t have to be disguised.  The power source?  No, the
the transmission?  Well, it has to walk like a sophont so yes, that should be
increased in price/weight.  Well all of these items are pretty much noise
level when compared to the robots BRAIN.
	The Brain:  I would assume that a robot of equal intelligence with
emotion simulation should \'act\' sufficiently like a sophont, compared to a
pseudo-bio model.  Thus the brain shouldn\'t be subject to the cost/weight
modifiers.
	On the other hand, one could argue that a normal robot doesn\'t have to
act quite so \'realisticly\' so a Pseudo-Bio brain would have to be more
sophisticated to deal with the task of acting like a sophont.  To this I have
to counter that the brain (if more sophisticated) should then get bonuses to
it\'s intelligence and education.  (logical?)  If a brain is 8 times as costly,
then it should have a modifier to intelligence.  If it is 1.5 times as massive,
then the extra processors in it should make it more intelligent.  (Right?)
	So what soaks up all this cost and weight?  The brain of a pseudo
bio is usually the most expensive thing in it.  A brain that has a good
intelligence Costs a lot.  To then multiply it by 8 with no real good reason
and no advantage to performance I can see is silly.  Opinions?

More Brain headaches:  In my opinion, there should be tech level effects on
data storage.  There are only 2 types available in Book 8: (Standard, Synaptic)
The Standard is TL 8 and the synaptic is TL 11.
There is NO diffence between a TL 12 standard and a TL 18 standard storage
unit.  This I don\'t like.  There ought to be an improvement of some kind.
(maybe a +1 education for each TL over 12?) Opinions?

Robot speed:  I think the max road speed of a robot should be calculated from
the same chart as the one in the Ref\'s manual.  Remember that is it\'s ROAD
speed, there are no obstacles in it\'s way!  Most robots end up with a high
power to weight ratio (even after you subtract the peripherals out)
You end up with a robot that should be able to run at 187 kph!  Most buildings
and starships could (at the VERY best) be considered off road.  A robot would
have to move at walking speed to go through a starship.  (Much Much slower
than it\'s off road speed)  {Even slower in something that looked like my
office or my room!}  So I don\'t see a robot with a large max speed as being
a problem.  Opinions?

Transmissions:  I think that a robots transmission should only have to deal
with the amount of power left after the peripherals are powered.  Thus if
a robot has a 20Kw power supply, and 11Kwatts are used by the brain and other
systems that are necessary while the robot is running at top speed;  Then the
transmission should be geared for the remaining 9Kw.  Opinions?

Flying speeds:  Here\'s an odd one, The max speed should come from the grav
thrust tables, but what about flying through a building or ship?  NOE?  well
110+kph speeds are going to be rediculous inside.

This brings on another question:  Where does NOE speed get used?  What altitude?
After all, we have TL-7 and 8, F-111\'s and Tornados flying just subsonic at
treetop height.  According to the ref\'s manual TL 8 max NOE speed is something
around 100 kph!  And here we\'ve got them cruising along with no trouble at
nearly 10 times that!  5 times what a TL 15 ship is supposed to be capable of!
	So what gives?  If you ask me the NOE speed of a craft should depend
not just on the sensors of the craft, but the computer of that craft. Opinions?

Note:  These are my stands on how robots should be built.  So, when in the
future you see a robot design, it will probably be build with the above in
mind.  Specifically Pseudo-Bio models, and the Transmission stuff.

I omitted to point out what I had in mind, when I asked that question
about gyro-stabilization the last time.

Some weapons in the SLUG THROWERS weapon table have a Difficulty As:
Rifle**. ** means that this weapon should be _treated_ as gyro-
stabilized when calculating the difficulty level for the "To hit"
task profile. Those weapons are more accurate than normal weapons,
because they are recoilless, but Laser Weapons have also no recoil,
so they should be _treated_ as gyro-stabilized as well. Therefore I
miss the ** footnote in the Laser Weapons table.

  Anyone else but me that recognizes this from some years ago? Only then it
wasn\'t MegaTraveller that was discontinued, it was Traveller. Sigh.

  Agreed, furthermore the power consumption for the processors and storage is
too high even by todays standards (I compared it with 1liter of Z80Ls:)

> (maybe a +1 education for each TL over 12?) Opinions?
 
  I\'d rather take smaller units. With the size of the programs multiplying
beyond control for higher skillevels than 1, more storage is needed before
nore edu is needed.

>This brings on another question:  Where does NOE speed get used? What altitude?

  Lowest authorized altitude for the Swedish AF during peace is 20m over land
and 10m over water, no speed restrictions, so NOE has to be lower than that:)

  I suspect that Traveller NOE is the type of NOE attack helicopters use, ie
hiding behind treelines, flying under powerlines and bridges and following
roads.

> 	So what gives?  If you ask me the NOE speed of a craft should depend
>not just on the sensors of the craft, but the computer of that craft. Opinions?

  The computer is not all that influential. It is possible to fly the aircraft
version of NOE from 300 to 600 km/h without sensors (ie following roads,
under bridges, and so low that you have to pull up to avoid meeting traffic:)
*in small planes with quick reactions*. If the speed is higher, or the 
reactions of the a/c slower, computers and sensors have a growing role.
I suspect that the size of the plane and its speed of reaction is the 
greatest determining factor. There is a world of difference between flying a
BUFF and a small prop job at 10 meters, and a computer can compute the best
trajectory that *don\'t* inpact ground:)
  However, if you are planning to do it in bad weather or at night, sensors
are increasingly nessesary.

  For grav-powered vehicles, I\'d suggest that they work in the same way as
helicopters do today (after all, both suspend their whole weight by thrust
alone and move about by vectoring that thrust, or by inducing thrust from 
other sources). The effect for this with regards to NOE is that they can
travel arbitrarily close to the ground at high speeds, but that the maximum
acceleration limits their reaction-time and thus their NOE speed. Sensors and
computers would be useful for increasing prediction time and finding the
optimum envelope for minimum visibility.

I see laughter as a result of higher, abstract reasoning and a social
structure that allows leasure time and informality.  Alien races on a
level equal or beyond that of man (technologically and socially) ought
to have ensured the evolution of humor and a way of expressing
appreciation of humor (lauhgter).  I find the question of \'to be or
not to be\' with regard to humor rather uninteresting.  I find it more
interesting to ponder _what_, based on social life, etc., constitues
humor in the various alien societies.

While I am not an expert on gyrostabilization (I have never actually fired
a gun that has it if there are real ones in existence), I don\'t think that
the main purpose is control recoil.  The effect of a gyro would be to make
the entire gun resistant to quick rotational changes (in any plane).  So you
have 2 choices - a weak (low mass/angular velocity) or strong (high mass/vel)
gyro.  The weak one\'s only real effect would be to steady your aim (which
would apply to lasers just as well as any other type of gun).  Your aim point
would not jiggle around because the very small unsteadiness in your arm/hand
would be damped by the gyro.  It would do very little to control the amount
or direction of recoil.  A strong gyro (let\'s ignore the problems with the
materials required to make such a thing that small and light, with
correspondingly HUGE rotational velocity, and what would happen when it was
hit in combat - I wouldn\'t carry one), one big enough to control recoil, would
a) make the gun impossible to aim - you couldn\'t track a target with it!
b) would only change the direction of the recoil by 90 degrees - that\'s what
	gyros do.  so you might end up recoilling to one side instead.
c) the gyro would require HUGE amounts of energy to spin up - all the kinetic
	enery in the spinning gyro if it were perfectly effecient.  Of could
	maybe once you can build such an amazing thing, you could use it for
	battery!

You could try to answer (a) by:
a) only have the gyro engaged (connected to gun frame - you certainly couldn\'t
	spin it up quickly) just as the trigger was pulled, but it would still
	be hard to track a target with an automatic weapon because the gyro
	would resist the firer.

I think the way to control recoil is to keep the barrel in line with the
firer\'s shoulder or handgrip as in some bullpup designs today.  Since there is
no moment arm for the force to act through (the recoil force acts directly
toward the support), no rotation would be induced.  There could still be quite
a kick, but it would not mess up your aim (directly anyway).

Once again, my main conclusion is that a practical gyro could only help steady
your aim - anything big enough to help control recoil is probably impossible to
make and too dangerous to use in combat anyway.

> Anyone care to argue that lasers have kick, like in Star Wars? Hmmmm? |->

Well, you could argue that those weren\'t lasers, since you could watch the
\'bolts\' fly across the screen.  Certainly subsonic.  Of course maybe you
meant some other \'lasers\' I forgot.

Maybe they were actually lasers, but with the light slowed from \'c\' to a
few hundred fps - then the photons would have a really BIG mass for the
same energy as a regular photon!  (that was just a joke - really - don\'t
explain to me about basic physics).

    I\'m going to quote from \'3G\', the BTRC\'s gun design book (and a
must buy, I should say):

        "Any weapon may be gyrostabilized.  This will add ... to the
    overall mass of the weapon (heavier weapons require heavier gyros),
    and is only possible at TL9 [WWII] or greater....  Hand weapon
    gyrostabilization operates on 6 gyros, with two counterrotating
    gyros on each axis, usually near the weapon\'s center of gravity.
    Pressure switches in the grip of the weapon speed up or brake
    certain gyros, depending on which way the weapon is moved, resulting
    in the weapon automatically pivoting in that direction.

        "Example - If the firer twisted the grip to the right, the
    weapon would smoothly pivot to the right, regardless of anything
    else the firer was doing, including running.

        "The extremely stable mount gyrostabilization provides will
    halve negative modifiers for firer movement ... but automatically
    makes the initiative of the weapon 1 worse...."

    From this I conclude that the usual use of gyrostabilization is
not so much to control recoil (you will still get a kick -- it can\'t
stop that) but to keep the gun steady.  Now there are cases (like
snap shots) where that can prove quite a hindrance even if you can
control the gyros (as it states above).  But for any rifle-sized weapon,
it makes sniping much easier.

(Sorry about the lack of attributions, I couldn\'t figure them all out.)
  I always thought of the hand weapons in Star Wars as \'blasters\', by which
I mean a weapon that actually launches some sort of physical projectile.  Kinda
like a plasma pistol.  Any guesses as to what tech level would be needed to 
make such a thing in MT.  I.E. is there any good correlation between the tech
level at which a rifle (large version of a weapon) comes out and when the 
equivalent pistol comes out?

Well, it\'s not a Star Wars weapon, but one of my old favorites was the
\'Sandman\' gun from \'Logan\'s Run\'. I saw a blueprint once in an old Starlog
magazine...It fired ~1cm pellets of magnesium, using pressurized butane,
lit off by an electric spark at the base of the firing chamber...kind of a 
fore-runner of modern paintball guns(much the same design...don\'t suppose the 
first paintballers watched LR, do ya? :)

....A blazing hunk \'o magnesium hitting at about the same speed as a paint
pellet....lousy range, but I think it would be quite decidedly nasty...

    'body' => 'Andrew Salamon asks if there is any correlation with other weapons as to when
pistols come out after the rifle has been introduced.  My estimation would
be two tech levels later.  I take my cue from the guass rifle (praise be to
the all-mighty guass rifle), which was introduced at TL12, if memory serves.
In Striker, the Guass Pistol is introduced at TL14.  So, in that case, the
"Blaster" or, plasma pistol, would be introduced at TL18...  A TL that seems
quite in line with other Star Wars techno-gizmos.  (i.e. artificially
intelligent robots and miraculously small powerplants and drives systems...
oh, and don\'t forget the famous "proton torpedoes", aka anti-matter
warheads.)

Even if I have my TL wrong with when the Guass Rifle was introduced, I would
still argue that the plasma pistol would be introduced at TL18, or perhaps
TL17, but that might be pushing it.  The reason for this is simple:  If it
took them two tech levels to make a PGMP-14 into a plasma rifle, then they
certainly should take that long to make it into a pistol!  Miniturization is
one thing, but micronization of a plasma focusing element?  That would take
some doing.

  Well, the Star Wars blasters are a version of the classic S-F pulp zap
guns, and as such they don\'t really have to obey any sort of reality.  If I
*HAD* to, I guess I would call them a kind of a plasma pistol.

  In one of my campaigns, one character funded a research project, the
culmination of which was the construction of a device he called the PPMP-16.
It looked like a rather large hair dryer, connected to a backpack power
supply (approximately the same size and weight as that for a laser rifle).
Its combat statistics were approximately the same as a PGMP-12, but it
contained only about half the ammo.  In MegaTraveller terms, that would be
a pen/atten of 20/1, damage of 12, and difficulty as pistol.

The thing was a one of a kind, and the total cost of the prototype was over
a million credits (the total cost of the research program was considerably
more than that, in addition).  The design was offered to Instellarms, but
they declined production; not only was the weapon realtively expensive to
make, it had a limited market, and was very sensitive to maintainance.

Because it is so close to the "bleeding edge" of technology, the PPMP-16
suffered from a couple of problems.  Both of these are maintainance related;
the operating characteristics of the gun time, barrel wear, and power pack
charge.  A special hand computer program, combined with a maintainance kit
were used to keep the weapon in top shape.

Without proper maintainance (and generally whenever the firer rolled a "2"
for his to-hit roll) one or the other of two things would happen.
First, the hydrogen plasma "seed" could fail to be properly contained for
plasma heating.  The effect was a low powered shot (half pen and damage)
that did not form into a proper beam; instead, it spread out like a 
flamethrower in front of the weapon (and with about the same range).
Secondly, the plasma could be over-contained, and may actually start to
fuse (pen/atten 25/1, damage 14).  Unfortunately the higher recoil is
usually not compensated by the gravitic system, resulting in loss of control
of the weapon, muscle strains, sprained joints, and in one case a fractured
wrist (the PPMP-16 was really *NOT* designed with Vargr in mind).

The weapon was last seen before the 5th Frontier War, in the Spinward Marches
region (specifically in the hands of a mixed Aslan/Human starmerc outfit
operating out of the Darrian Confederation).

Just got out of a colloquim on Gravitoelectrodynamics given by a Dr. Torr.
Wow!  Looks like some interesting stuff going on.  They are putting
General Relativity together with Electrodynamics.  Cool stuff!  They\'ve
worked out analogs of Maxwell\'s equations for use with Gravitation.

Well, you guys know about colloquia, you pick up what little you can.
So I just thought I\'d give my impression on what he was saying.  Don\'t
Crucify me if there is a Gravitation PhD out there!  (Hey! I\'m only a
1st quarter grad student)

Right.  In Electodynamics, you have a force due to a static charge (Static
electricity) and a force due to a moving charge (Magnetism) Well, by analogy
a static mass has a gravitational force due to its mass (The one we
experience every day) and a gravitational force due to its movement.

Well, you\'d need a mass moving Very fast to get a Magnetic equivalent to
gravitation, but it could be measurable inside a superconductor.  The
speed of gravitation (that they used was u*c {that is supposed to be a mu but
there are no greek letters on here})  So you could create a gravitational
field!

My knowlege of superconductors is limited so that\'s about where I got lost.

This would indicate your space craft would have some sort of superconducting
shield around the inside of the hull to create your artificial gravity.
Since the speed of gravitation depends on the permittivity of the medium, it
might be possible to reflect grav waves within the hull creating a standing
wave of gravitation, if so, your gravitation field would not extend far
beyond the hull.

Now that I think of it imagine varying the permittivity in such a way... that
you\'d get gravitational lenses!  (Anybody remember the design I put out for
the lab ship with a gravitational telescope?)  Also, by verying permittivity
you might get such oddities as a gravitational equivalent to a doppler shift.

Can you imagine a gravitational equivalent to cherenkov radiation?  WOW!
(non physics folks:  A Gravitational Sonic Boom!)  Wierd huh?

Hey maybe TL9 isn\'t that far away!

:(Sorry about the lack of attributions, I couldn\'t figure them all out.)
: I always thought of the hand weapons in Star Wars as \'blasters\', by which

:make such a thing in MT.  I.E. is there any good correlation between the tech
:level at which a rifle (large version of a weapon) comes out and when the

I always considered them aplasma pistol as well. 
 Sort of PGMP, hand - 18  (Maybe this is a PBEM hint...)

I\'ve never seen a good correlation for the rifle-carbine-pistol development
and TL, but then there wouldn\'t necessarily be one.  Handguns and rifles
have historically (on Terra) evolved separately.

So, is your blaster a revolver or a semi-auto?  (full auto PGMP? WOW!)

SUBJECT: DGP is putting MT production on hold during production of AI

After much thoughtful consideration, DGP\'s MegaTraveller production has been
put on hold, pending the release of AI and gaining a better understanding of
GDW\'s direction regarding MegaTraveller. After MTJ3 (due out in January), the
next three releases from DGP will be the AI game and two support products for
it. Onnesium Quest has been cancelled.

Onnesium quest was cancelled for two main reasons: 1) Adventures do not sell
well, and with DGP\'s limited resources, it makes sense to maximize our returns
for a given amount of work. MegaTraveller adventure products give us the WORST
return for a unit of effort. Even the magazine does better in terms of dollar
sales than an adventure product. 2) We didn\'t feel right keeping Philip in the
dark concerning our decision to put all MegaTraveller production on hold for
the next year. So we told him our priority for the foreseable future is AI,
not MegaTraveller.

I would be less than honest if I didn\'t admit that Marc Miller leaving GDW has
had an effect on this decision to put MT production on hold. Marc gave the
game a sense of wonder and direction as its inventor. With- out him closely
involved in the game\'s direction, a lot of my own personal pleasure from
working with the game is gone -- but that\'s just me and I know that others
don\'t necessarily feel the same way.

DGP has suffered to some extent over the years because of our tendency to
think like fans rather than like owners of a business. Our accountant has
cringed at some of our decisions -- like our insistence on producing the
magazine even though it took just as much effort to produce as any  product,
and yet our unit take was only HALF of what we would get for a product. A
small business typically has a very slim profit margin, and our accountant
would also ask time and again when we were going to get out of a royalty
arrangement with some other game company. "Do your own game" she would say
over and over. "NO, we like Traveller," we would  say.

That time has come to an end. We have decided to do something different this
time and to treat DGP like a business, not as a fan organization that sells
stuff. AI is already getting a lot of good response. A case in point is the
situation this last summer when Rob was flying to GENCON and he sat next to an
individual from Milton-Bradley, also going to GENCON as it turned out. When
Rob told this person he was with Digest Group, this person\'s response was "Oh
yeah? When\'s AI coming out?"

We\'ve never seen that level of interest or notariety from Traveller.

SUBJECTS:
 -DGP\'s Decision
 -The "Mega-" Difference
 -GDW\'s two Role-Playing Systems


 -DGP\'s Decision
   I can\'t say I like what I hear, but I understand the realities of the
situation.  I hope that history will justify Joe\'s confidence in A.I., but I
curse at the loss of Traveller\'s foremost supporter.
 -The "Mega-" Difference
   With the introduction of MegaTraveller and the assassination of Strephon,
GDW gained a lively, moving background in which to revive Traveller. 
Unfortunately, that lively, moving background is also a disadvantage.  No
longer can a writer spend six months to a year polishing a scenario or book. 
No longer can an editor put off the publication of a project by six months. 
Delays like this are almost certain demise for a project in the Rebellion Era,
since history will have moved beyond the project long before it reaches
publication.

   While this is not a big problem with magazine articles, major releases like
"Rebel Tales" and "Grand Explorations" are no longer appropriate for
publication when their day in history has passed.  Imagine trying to convince
GDW (in 1988) to publish "Leviathan" or "Signal GK".  It would not have been
done.  The setting for those adventures (Trojan Reaches without Aslan; sedate
Solomani Sphere) was gone.

   Similarly, a lot of late Rebellion writing is going to be left in the dust
(for anything but magazine publication) when GDW accelerates the clock again. 
If this acceleration results in a long period of stability for the former
Imperium, then it will be a good thing.  Writers will again be able to plan
for publication of big projects that won\'t become irrelevant before the
writing is finished.  Rejected manuscripts will return to a normal percentage
of the whole, as "no longer relevant" drops from the list of reasons for
rejection.
   I look forward to the next jump of the Imperial Clock.  It will vastly
improve our chances of getting anything (other than Challenge) from GDW.


 -GDW\'s two Role-Playing Systems
   For the record, I am NOT in favor of converting the Traveller background to
the Twilit:2K/Cads&Dinos/DarkSpiracy system.  It does not need (and cannot
use) the support of the Twilight equipment books, and cannot benefit from the
other two games, since the strong background differences render their material
worthless to Traveller.
   Traveller does not NEED the gross realism of the Twilight combat system;
Traveller combat is dangerous enough already.  To change the career-oriented
character generation of Traveller is to change the whole feel of the game.  To
change the craft rules (as opposed to finishing them) is to court disaster,
since a great deal of player effort in vehicle design would be rendered
obsolete.
   If this (unwanted and unneeded) change is to occur, it should be in the
form of two-way conversion rules, and NOT a complete revision and
republication of Traveller.  The old-time Traveller players already grumble
about buying the background all over again (in MT), and would not stand for
buying it a third time.

  Traveller The New Era

   Just in time for its 15th anniversary, Traveller is back! Coming in the
Fall  of 1992, Traveller will burst back onto the gaming scene with revamped
streamlined, state of the art rules, compatible with GDW\'s Twilight/ Dark
Con/Cads&Dinos rules system. The rules will remain faithful to the precepts
established in the original Traveller and MegaTraveller, but will  be made
more accessible to the first time player. The New Rules will be  accompanied
by an updated campaign setting, which will be contemporary  with the Star
Viking miniatures rules. What became of the Imperium? How did the Rebellion
end? Who are these Viking guys, and was that a Hiver  we just saw? Like they
say, it\'s always darkest before the dawn.
     Traveller is 15...its never been this good.

 In the mean time (and to speed up the above wait-and-see) I would suggest we
temporarily use Topic 8 for discussion of the revision.  The Q&A topic has
seen little enough activity, and we ought to have one place where we (HIWG in
particular) can ask about the upcoming changes (most of which are RULES
changes after all)

You know, it seems like I\'ve seen a lot of excess whining about the fact that
Traveller will be going into its third revision. If you think about it, 3
major revisions in 15 years aint too bad.

Just an opinion.

I don\'t think the whining is unjustified.  There was quite a bit of good
discussion of the subject on the USENET Traveller Mailing list. Basically, I
won\'t be buying the revision for the same reason that I didn\'t buy AD&D Second
edition.  There is no substantial improvement over the previous edition.

The key word here is "improvement".  There is probably a lot of "change" but
how much of that is "improvement".  I don\'t want to spend my money on
something different.  There is so much conflictiong information, missing
information, and just plain poor editing in the Mega Traveller rules as it
stands that, without some substantial proof that GDW has improved basic
proofreading in the years, I won\'t be inclined to even think about buying Star
Viking.

And thinking about it, three major revisions in 15 years does seem a bit
excessive.

If you think about it three major revisions in 15
 years is pretty -bad-. And two major revisions in - 5- years is worse. I
think the concerns raised by
 Farstar and others (especially the upload in the
 library from TML) are legitimate- I think calling
 it whining is an injustice. You will not find more
 devoted, intelligent Trav/MT fans anywhere than
 the group here on GEnie. And frankly hearing a
 member of DGP\'s staff having that kind of callous
 opinion of some of the most ardent supporters of  DGP is surprising- I hope
they are not as insulting  to the AI crowd. I\'ve quietly enjoyed  the
discussions on this board for almost a year.  I\'ve read comments that could be
considered whining-  people too concerned about the tedious- people  letting
the
 many little unexplanables in Trav rob the fun for
 them- but I do not consider the worried statements
 of late from several of what I consider premier
 trav-fans, whining. It has been a bad last several
 months for MT fans. We\'ve seen the departure of
 Marc Miller the ultimate prime mover in Traveller
 (without whom a third revision is almost doomed to
 failure- I hope I\'m wrong.) We\'ve seen at least the
 long term withdrawal of DGP from MT products, and
 we\'ve seen many excellent ideas for support
 products get shot down in favor of a third revision
 that I\'m honestly straining to find some good
 points for. Farstar\'s concerns about products/ and
 or product idea submission turning obsolete because
 of the whirling rush of official time I think is
 particularly well founded. Columbia Games\' Harn
 World products for instance never move their
 offical time. They have also never had a major
 revision in well over 10 years of being in
 business. I can tell that GDW isn\'t really
 targeting me (an old Trav grognard) with this
 upcoming product- They want new blood to keep their
 coffers from drying out. I can\'t blame them for
 that- a game company has to think like that to stay
 alive- I\'m only saying that if the trend continues-
 if marketing concerns beat out honest
 craftsmenship- GDW and T/MT/SV will be dead or as
 good as dead anyway.

And where as that wouldn\'t be the end of the world
 (there is certainly enough matieral to run
 campaigns for the next century), it -is-
 frustrating to see such potential for gaming
 products go down the drain in favor of what sounds
 like (yes I know it\'s not out yet) an ill advised
 and perhaps seld limiting product direction.
 Whining, indeed, it sounds like honest concerns
 from loyal fans and friends of GDW.

Here\'s what I remember (I\'m pretty sure it\'s right):

10 MW of power in, 1.8 MW of power out for 2 seconds.  It\'s still not
putting out more energy than we\'re putting in, but 2 seconds is an awful
long time for something that hot.  Technically, we\'ve had controlled
fusion reactions for some time, just haven\'t made it pay off yet.

if some kind soul out there could e-mail me address for contacting the

a \'contact\' at...

I know from some of last night\'s articles that MT is on hold, and DGP isn\'t
real thrilled about continuing support of this, but I figure they might
have just a roomful of stuff they don\'t really need(nudge nudge), and 
they\'re gonna want to clear that space out for new products(wink wink)...

7mm rifle: TL5		9mm revolver: TL4:	Pistol TL = Rifle TL - 1
7mm auto-rifle: TL6	9mm auto-pistol: TL5:	Pistol TL = Rifle TL - 1
Gauss rifle: TL12	Gauss pistol: TL13:	Pistol TL = Rifle TL + 1
Laser carbine: TL8	Laser rifle/pistol: TL9	Pistol TL = longarm TL + 1
PGMP: TL12		Plasma rifle: TL16	Rifle TL = introductory
							   TL + 4

So, there seems to be little correlation between the introductory TL of a
rifle (or longarm), and the introductory TL of the equivalent pistol in
general.  For the gauss and laser weapons, the TL of the pistol is one
above the TL of the earliest longarm.  If the plasma rifle is TL16, then I
would make the plasma pistol TL17.

(Incidentally, there\'s something wrong with the table of weapons in the
Imperial Encyclopedia.  The 9mm auto-pistol is TL5; the 7mm auto-pistol
is TL6.  As far as I know, the earliest auto-pistol was the Borchardt,
the forerunner of the Luger, and that was 7.63mm.  The earliest Luger was
also 7.63mm, as was the Mauser M1896.  Did we really get to TL6 before we
got to TL5?)

What TL is a light-sabre?  :-)

I am hoping someone here can give me a hand with a game design.

I\'m writing a Space Opera PBM, based on \'high lo-tech\' equipment.
Just imagine the Nouveau design of space ships weapons, dress and
equipment evoked in 40\'s and 50\'s science fiction writing.
This is the universe were bazillions of megawatts of energy are
required to keep a city alive, or for that matter, a frieghter
plying the space between planets in the same system.
  The game already has quite a few variables for the players to adjust,
and which will heighten it\'s ability to portray a certain realism.
  But two facets elude what I feel is an adequate solution.

They are moving a mass through space, and ship to ship combat.

Travel through this galaxy is based on the time it takes to move a
field of hexes.  Engines move a ship at a ratio of 1 hex for each
engine factor.  Thus Engines-1 moves the ship 1 hex. Engines-5, move it
5 hexes.

My problem with this idea is that if the ship is 20 tonnes or 1000 tonnes
in size, any engine factor will move boths ships the same distance.

My knowledge of physics is strictly bounded my an incomplete reading of
Stephen Hawkings A History of Time.
It seems to me there is more to moving a ship through space.

I\'m not looking for an exact duplicate of what happens in "Real Life",
for sure this is strictly a 2D universe.  But I\'d like something with
a little more \'texture\' while still being a relatively easy formula
for players to handle.


As for ship to ship combat, my ideas are rudimentary at best, and not
worth repeating here.

What I\'m looking for help with are the \'factors\' one must consider
when putting together a combat system. The situation is one of
simple energy shields vs \'beam of energy\' weapons and missiles of severely
destructive power, usually reserved for long range attack.

The obvious \'factors\' are weapon strength vs. shield strength, but many
other factors could be added.  Witness the recent discussions on
agility.  There is again the question of engines and how they might
affect combat.  Tractor beams have notbeen invented as yet, nor have
other weapons systems.

I realize that this mailing list is not the forum for this topic of
discussion, but I also recognize that the deep involvement with the
Traveller System, evidenced in the high level of discussion between
those who take part in this mailing list, represents my best source of
ideas on the milieu of spacefarers. (In otherwords a bit of shameless
flattery - honest tho\' you folks amaze me with the manner in which you
incorporate and project into the future, the state of science in all of
it\'s facets).

Any help you can offer will be greatly appreciated.

People have speculated here WRT how far/near planet Earth is to TL 9, 
I thought I\'d add my two cents worth.  

First, the magnetic analog to gravitational fields has been speculated
about since early this century.  Since the gravitational force has
the same functional form as the electromagnetic force (except everything
has the same "charge") it is no surprise that one should be able to 
measure a dipole-magnetic like force from relativistically moving 
masses.  Note that the magnitude of this field will be *tiny*, therefore
the amount of energy required to produce any measureable effect is 
*enormous*.  We won\'t be at Tau Ceti any time soon:-)

Next, regarding the recent successes in fusion experiments, the 
net energy release is indeed a step forward, but unfortunately it is
a small one.  It will, barring a breakthrough of extreme proportions,
still be decades before the first experimental fusion plant is on line.

In conclusion, if we want to get Earth\'s TL listing upgraded to 9, 
our best chance is to advance computer and medical technology and let
fusion and JD slide for a while;-)

 Let me first say that, despite my e-mail address, I was NOT speaking as
 a DGP representative when I made my comment. I have very little to do
 with the MT side of DGP.

 Having said that...


 Don\'t you think that y\'all are being a little pessimistic here? You 
 really don\'t know all of the particulars as to what these changes
 will entail. You Do know that there will be a new system (the T2K/
 DC/CAD system) and if you don\'t like the game system than I could
 understand your complaints. You also know A LITTLE about what the
 new setting will be but probably not enough to make definite judgements
 about it.

 Personally, I\'m anxious to see what is done with the new game. I never
 much liked the old system myself and found it difficult to relate to.
 Everything is spread out over so many different supplements it was 
 nearly impossible to have somebody pick it up and play it without 
 somebody else around who had been doing it since day one.

 Given the time you all have spent on this game I guess I can see
 that more change can be a very frightening thing and maybe you feel
 like you\'re being abandoned by GDW. I think that maybe you should 
 look at the alternative though. Let\'s say that there wasn\'t going to
 be any changes... how long do you think the game would last? Or maybe
 you think that you have better ideas of how it could be changed...
 well, it\'s not your game.

 I wasn\'t trying to flame you guys or anything by saying that I thought
 that you were whining but I would think that you would be more positive 
 about it. Things could be worse. Look at me, I\'m still hoping that there
 is a future for 2300AD...

 I\'ve said enough. I\'ll go away now.

One of the things we want VERY much is customer input, which we are seeking
through several sources...one of those sources is GEnie. If anyone has
concerns about what we are doing, or suggestions, or questions, complaints,
comments , suggestions, or whatever, we want to hear them. 
     Let me point out one thing that seems to be generating some mis-
understanding here: we will not be changing over to the Twilight: 2000
background history, just a variant of the rule mechanics. We want to  re-
instill the original excitement the game engendered, cleaning up rules
problems and smoothing out hastles.
     If we change nothing, and let things go along as they are,  one of the
longest running RPGs will slowly go down the drain, and we will not allow that
to happen.
    The upcoming RTC (time to be announced) will explain what plans are, and I
would appreciate it if people would wait until they find out what we plan on
doing before commenting...reacting to rumors or speculations won\'t do anybody
any good.

    <3 revisions in 15 years> Is actually about par for the course, at least
for those RPG\'s that survived that long :). Although I would say the second
revision was incomplete, in more ways than one.

    <2 revisions in 5 years> Offhand I can\'t think of an RPG that hasn\'t been
revised in five years, though I will say that traveller has done it in reverse
compared to most. By this I mean that most RPG\'s go into their 2nd edition
within the first five years, the third by fifteen years. This is by all the
examples I can think of. (this covers GDW, FASA, TSR, Chaosium, Columbia
Games, FGU, the possible exception is WEG who I\'m not familiar with all that
much).

    <Revision> Most people have wanted parts of MT revised in the first place,
the only possible complaint might be seeing parts other than those wanted
revised. And the fact that it\'s coming about 1-2 years earlier than expected.

    <Columbia games never having a major revision> That\'s a matter of opinion,
I\'ve lost track of their revisions, but I\'ve seen parts of it revised three
times, not even including new information in later versions of an edition that
wasn\'t in the first edition. In my opinion they were worse than a lot of other
companies till they settled down somewhat.

    <T2000/DC> I like the character generation system used by these games
(well at least DC with which I\'m slightly more familiar), my only possible
complaint would be retaining some of the flavor of the current system. I also
like aspects of the combat system.

    Am I taking GDW\'s part in this, well maybe, I think some of the changes
might be in the right direction, I think other parts are in the wrong
direction, will I buy the product, I don\'t know. Will I buy Star Vikings,
almost definitely not. Do I like the new future, almost definitely not, but
part of that\'s because I have severe doubts about GDW carrying it out well,
and whether such a future is \'realistic\' in terms of the Traveller universe. I
think the background should be seperated from the rules in this case with
three possibilities (no rebellion, rebellion, post rebellion).

    All I\'ve seen is people complain about the state of affairs (me included,
so I don\'t want to hear about it). All I can say is that if your unwilling or
unable to put some effort in, you\'se get what you pay for. It\'s easy to
complain, it\'s harder to provide constructive alternatives, if GDW doesn\'t get
constructive alternatives they have to do what they think is best. And I
definitely agree with them that the rules need an overhaul (just thinking on
how long HIWG\'s Starship group has taken to get the rules figured out
correctly for one, and I\'m still awaiting an errata free version of the MT
rules).

    So if you guys want to complain, suggest alternatives to GDW so they can
get it right. And I haven\'t seen one person who hasn\'t wanted parts of MT
revised because of problems.

    As for editing problems, well MT probably had more than it\'s fair share of
problems, but than I\'ve seen very few 1st editions without editing problems or
something missing. Hopefully GDW takes more time proofreading this time.
Usually the problem is a company trying to rush out the product by GenCon or
Origins (or Christmas). In this respect gaming companies and computer software
companies have a lot in common.

    This doesn\'t mean I\'m not going to b___h and complain along with the rest
of you guys, it does mean I will try to offer constructive criticism to GDW,
and hopefully they will have a more active presence telling what they have in
mind, so that others can stick there two cents in (unless of course they get
turned off by the hatemail).

      I dislike the idea of a third revision of Traveller, yet I
 welcome it if it helps assure stronger support.
      I\'m one of those people who would rather see Traveller go back to
 its space black covers and classic rules system.  I loved the idea of
 a largely static frontier backdrop, a canvass upon a which a referee
 could devise his own campaign as inspired by his favorite SF books and
 films.  The game had a lot of charm.
      But I also want new products with which to support my campaign.
 I\'d prefer additional volumes in the same vein as THE TRAVELLER
 ADVENTURE.  Those days are over.  So, my choice is to dig in my heels
 and buy nothing, or buy what GDW gives us and like it.  I opt for the
 later.
      Am I some whimp who won\'t put up a fight?  No.  Its just that
 after several meetings with Marc and contact with Loren and other
 staffers, I think I see GDW\'s side in this.  If you open Frank
 Chadwick\'s office door, you are not going to see him gleefully
 counting stacks of coins.  The folks at Game Designer\'s Workshop
 didn\'t start as visionary businessmen with hopes of making their
 fortune.  Rather, they have a passion for games, as a lot of us do.
 And therein lies the problem.
      I believe Loren.  GDW does pay close attention to comments, and
 cares very much about fan opinion.  I know feedback letters and
 convention discussions have influenced their actions on many
 occasions.  But they are also in this for their own enjoyment,
 something I didn\'t appreciate until reading remarks from Joe Fugate
 (TS20).  Since they\'re not in it for the (non-existant) bags of money,
 then they\'re in it for the fun.  And we have to allow for it.
      In short, we should respect their desires if we expect them to
 remain receptive to our\'s.
                                                                   MIKE

Mike,
  With regard to being us respecting their desires...

One note I would interject is that it is _my_ money that I am spending.  I
expect the most from any product I buy and am disappointed (in various
degrees) when the product fails to live up to my expectation (based on hear-
say, price, and review).

So if a business expects _my_ dollar, I don\'t see that _I_ should have to
compromise.  And any business that expects this is going to fail.  Harsh
reality of the business world.

Right you are, Carl.  Part of the problem, as I see it, is that there are too
many people who have already had a bad experience with Traveller in one form
or another.  These people will not be likely to buy the revision, and will
also provide negative word of mouth advertising to those who might be
considering the game.  I know that it\'s already a problem at my local store,
where people decide not to buy the system when they ask me about modules:  I
can\'t recommend things like Fighting Ships or COACC in good conscience, and
have no incentive to do so in any other way since I\'m not one of the store\'s
owners or employees.

Even now, some of the best products, like the World Builder\'s Handbook, are
unavailable, which is also a problem.  "What do I need to start?" "Well,
you\'ll want the World Builder\'s Handbook, but it\'s out of print, a couple of
simple starting adventures, but there aren\'t any, and the rules.  Oh yeah,
with the rules, make sure you\'ve got all seventeen pages of the errata sheets,
because you can\'t play the game without them. The Ref\'s Screen is helpful, but
it isn\'t available any more, and you should avoid the Fighting Ships and 101
Vehicles books because most of the stuff breaks the rules."  I exaggerate
somewhat for effect, but a speech like that is not likely to cause a new
prospect to drop the thrity dollars he\'s clutching, except maybe on the Star
Wars rpg.

So, the new revision is going to have to work hard to overcome a backlog of
resentment.  What are the odds, I wonder, against needing/wanting tons of
Original Traveller stuff to play T3?  As it is now, I regularly use the
original Aliens modules, Mayday, and sections of the rules like Trade and
Commerce.

Call me a whiner if you like, but I see these sorts of things as a real
problem.

Rob,

So what would you want if it were all up to you? No, really. You don\'t sound
too happy with the current game as it stands so do you think that GDW should
just call it quits and just be happy things lasted this long?

The reason I used the term "whining" is because there has been almost NO
positive responses to the announced game. Most people are saying why they
AREN\'T going to buy it. Have any of you taken a good look at 2nd Ed. Twilight
2000 or Dark Conspiracy? They may not be your roleplaying cup of tea, but they
are a remarkable improvement over Megatraveller and even 2300AD. The system
works very well and has alot of playtesting behind it now. It seems like
Megatraveller has been one long attempt to fill the gaps and correct the
mistakes. Don\'t you think it will be nice to wipe the slate clean and start
again and maybe, just maybe, get it closer to right on the first try? The more
I think about it, the more excited I get!

Well, I hope that I haven\'t grated on anybody here to bad with my playing
"devil\'s advocate."

As the person mostly responsible for the MegaTraveller revision and the
revised craft design system, perhaps I can shed some light on things?
I am painfully aware of the mess I made of certain parts of the MegaTraveller
system, and in my own opinion, several of the rules sections do not work out
very well in practice. My biggest problem was I knew the game well, and wrote
the revision for a gamer who was a familiar with the game as me. BIG mistake.

I have talked with Marc over the last two years that a revision of the
Traveller rules/background is in order -- partly to clean up the mess I made
of the MT revision. GDW introduced a lot of typos in MT, besides the mistakes
I made -- but I\'ve also seen their typo problem improve  remarkably over the
last 2-3 years. The latest release of the  Twilight:2000 rules is of excellent
quality -- you have to really look to find ANY typos.

Speaking as a business person for a moment, GDW\'s move to revise the game
rules makes all kinds of sense. The revision will quite likely bring in NEW
gamers -- something Traveller desperately needs if it is going to survive.

GDW is also watching the gaming market, and trying to get in the new, younger
gamer. Us old-timers don\'t necessarily go in for the darker, more violent,
less structured environments that the young gamers go in for. But if GDW wants
Traveller to continue to live on, it will have to appeal to the new gamer.

Still, many loyal fans of the game currently exist. Speaking for myself, the
new direction with the background oriented toward the younger gamer does not
appeal to me (one reason DGP is going into hold mode on Traveller publishing).
GDW is clever, though, and I would expect them (hi Loren and Chuck) to
include a slant on the background to also intrigue us old-timers too. Seems
kind of dumb to alienate your current audience just to appeal to the new
crowd.

Just what that slant will be isn\'t yet clear, but I KNOW they are getting the
message. Perhaps some of you clever GEnie gamers could come up with a slant
that pleases all the gamers, old and new alike? I\'d like to see the discussion
take that direction myself. I always prefer constructive discussions...

- --Joe Fugate, DGP

P.S. I do believe that AI has the right mix for the old and new gamer alike.
But then, I\'m not exactly unbiased.

Okay, I did it. I started a new topic in hopes of promoting more  positive
discussion of the upcoming Traveller revision.

This topic is specifically for putting down ideas about what you  would like
to see in the new Traveller. Mayeb even things you DON\'T want to see as long
as you stay positive about it. You can use this area to help collect your
thoughts about this in preparation for the upcoming RTC.

I would prefer not to see any explanations about "why I\'m not buying the new

Jay,

  Maybe you could say a couple of words about what the "system" is with T2k or
D.C. that will be used for Star Viking.  I have neither game and so I have
little idea what will be inherited.

  The main skepticisms that have come through regarding S.V. is based upon the
past record of GDW regarding Traveller.  For MT, this would be lack of
coherent ship design, lack of robot design rules, poor editing/proofreading,
poor internal consistency, etc.

  These problems don\'t appear to have been solved in T2k or D.C. (neither, I
believe, would have ship design or robot design, editing/proofreading on these
I know nothing about.)  I personally don\'t have a _big_ heartache with the
character generation rules (beyond lack of internal consistancy and
proofreading), nor am I all that upset about the task-method.

  So, what _will_ S.V. attempt to improve?

  I post his here vice the new topic because this is a generally negative post
(unfortunately.)  Though I am _very_ interested in the answers.

Jay: Nothing wrong with playing Devil\'s Advocate..._someone_ should, and
you\'ve got the industry experience to understand both sides.

  I\'m trying to adopt a wait-and-see attitude, but I still can\'t get over a
couple of problems I have with the revision:

  For one, the compelte switch in the game system...while MegaTraveller was a
much needed revision, 90% of the old Traveller material (I don\'t count
background material...a settings is a setting, regardless of game system) was
still compatible.  That which wasn\'t was usually superseeded by MT or didn\'t
really need much in the ways of rules (one of the blessings of the task
system). I see no way to avoid making a great, great amount of material
(especially by non-GDW publishers) obsolete.

  For another, I have some real problems with the T2k 2nd ed./DC system (for
brevity\'s sake hereby referred to as the New System -- NS), at least as for
Traveller.  The main one is that there is _no_ task system...the semi-task
based skill system in NS does not work all that well, and lessens the impact
of a characters skills.  (BTW, I think this is the #1 problem with a 2300 - NS
conversion).  I like the system, but I don\'t feel its appropriate for
Traveller.

  I do like the idea that the starship combat rules are being completely
revised...the #1 problem with MT right now, IMHO.  This would be a good idea
regardless of a revision of the rest of the system.

  You asked Rob what he\'d do...(putting in my .2 Cr).  I think _I_ would go
ahead and do a 3rd edition/revision...but _with_ the same general system.  Do
it as a single, large volume (though there\'d be problem with costs, here). 
Get good, good art (the biggest attention-grabbing device for a game is a good
visual hook...the gothicness of Cthulu, the Enterprise for SFB, the weirdness
for DC, or the robots of Battletech).  Go for a _lot_ of exposure...novels are
the best way to me (Dark Conspiracy or Battletech would be nowhere near as
popular as they are right now without Mike Stackpole\'s novels, IMHO).

  Put _everything_ in this one, like the old Traveller Book (Best thing that
happened to Traveller, IMHO).  Basic character creation, task system & other
game mechanics (combat, healing, etc.), a streamlined system creation rules,
streamlined vehicular design/combat rules (Character level only...no need to
have rules to handle entire fleets), and, _maybe_ a small amount of
background. Put the more detailed version of rules in supplements...you want
the more detailed rules, get them there.  If not, you\'ve got enough already to
get by.

  I\'d do it as a campaign background volume (ie, Post-Rebellion Sourcebook),
system/world creation volume, fleet combat/large combat design volume, and
advanced character creation volume.  I think DGP\'s idea for AI, with all the
needed basic rules in one set and more detailed rules later on, if wanted, is
the way to go.

  Note, the method I was talking about seems awful similar to the way GDW did
Traveller over the years...that was intentional.  I think that\'s the best way
to do it, only taking much less time.

  I understand many of the reasons for a new edition, but I fear there\'s some
mistaken assumptions.  I don\'t see the new players there...let\'s face it, the
vast majority of beginners are going to start on D&D in one of its various
incarnations (At least the ones that will buy games...the ones that count in
this case).  In a year or so, once they feel more confident, they\'ll move on
to something that\'s more to their tastes.  Many of them will _not_ be moving
on to SF games.  The trick is to get the ones that do to lock on to Traveller
(in whichever incarnation).

  I don\'t think simpler rules are the answer (Its never taken me more than
twenty minutes to explain the system to _anyone_). COMPLETENESS and
INTEGRATION are the answers!  I want everything I need to run the system
there, and I want the rules to be internally consistent.

  Oh well, I\'ve rambled long enough.

Respectfully,

Mark

Actually, I understood that.  As you\'ll see below, that\'s not really the part

Since you started the topic for positive comments and suggestions, I\'ll post 
most of my answer to this up there.  Do _I_ think GDW should drop the idea and
 let Traveller die quietly?  H*** no.  Do I have confidence in their recent 
track record? Not really.  That\'s why I\'m nervous.  I happen to be a fan of
Space:1889...

Conspiracy? They may not be your roleplaying cup of tea, but they are a  >

As it happens, I\'ve got T:2000/2.  Dark Conspiracy doesn\'t intrigue me in the 
slightest so I haven\'t bought it.  I\'ve got 2300AD, and I\'ve got 
Traveller:2300.  I\'d go so far as to say that 2300AD is a substantial improve-
ment over Traveller:2300.  So much so that I can\'t figure why GDW released the
 latter in the form they did.  There are only a few things that bother me
about  the T:2000 system, and most of those have to do with how well 2000/2
fits my  view of that game\'s reality versus how well 2000/1 fit it.  I can
elaborate if  you like--my main problem is that I don\'t think the 2000/2
characters are  capable enough, compared to the old characters, which wouldn\'t
be a problem in  a Trav adaptation.  What does bother me is the potential
problem of converting  a substantial investment in old work into the new
system, again, and that  characters may not be compatible.  I still haven\'t
finished converting my High  Guard fleets into MT...

I might, if I had any confidence that it would work on the first try.  I felt 
like I was burned by the \'two versions of 2300\' mess, the original edition of 
MT, and the collapse of Space:1889.  I didn\'t like the way the background time
 clock was reset back to July, 2000 on the second edition of T:2000.  Would I 
be willing to do something constructive about it.  You bet!  I would be happy 
to be a playtester for any version of the thing, just because I love the game.
 I\'m also reasonably confident that many of the members of the Internet Travel-
 ler Mailing List would also be willing to provide commentary on game systems 
during testing in any level of detail that you might care for.  

The wiping the slate clean part is what worries me the most.  Look at the 
situation now.  We still do not have, after almost five years, as much back-
ground information as was available in 1985.  The Shattered Imperium is a 
potentially interesting setting, but a referee doesn\'t have enough _Traveller 
unique_ information available to him/her to make it real or interesting to a 
player.  We don\'t know much about any of the factions beyond the capsule 
writeups in the Rebellion Sourcebook.  There isn\'t an introductory adventure 
as good as THE TRAVELLER ADVENTURE or even TARSUS or BELTSTRIKE available for 
use by referees who aren\'t old timers.  If all the resources are put into 
working on the rules, who\'s going to do the modules, supplements and advne-
tures that a role playing game seems to need in the current market to attract 
new players?

3-405 Joe Fugate says:

Oddly enough, I happen to like the revised craft design system.  It\'s one of 
the few things that I would preserve in large parts if I was doing the revi-
sion.  Now the craft combat system(s), those are a problem!

First, a summary of what is already planned for the Traveller revision is in
order so that we don\'t tread over old ground.

Also, and I mentioned this in Email to GDW, what is the main objective of the
revision?  What is the target audience?  And what is already set in stone or
reasonably so?

Jay asks what we\'d like to see in a new Traveller.  A leading question if I 
ever heard one.  I\'ll try to keep this upbeat, and differentiate in some cases
 between things that are a matter of taste, things that I think are a matter
of  sheer commercial necessity and things that I think the game would be lost
(as  a game) without.

Let me start by commenting that I\'m at least partially what one might think of
 as a \'reality purist\'.  That is, I think that a game which states that ships 
travel at 1-G constant acceleration should be take notice of the fact that 
this means that travel times between planets will be measured in days, and 
travel times to jump points and so forth, in hours.  Combat rules for space-
ships should reflect the view of reality of the rest of the game.  I can 
handle something being abstracted (ala High Guard or Imperium\'s near/far 
rules).  I can handle something as complex <?> as Mayday.  What I have a hard 
time with is compromises like the MT space combat rules.  Since Traveller is a
 game of science fiction, I feel that it is acceptable to ask that the game 
pick a set of \'rules of reality\' and then stick to them.  Good sf books do 
this.

I would hope that the new rules would cover creation of characters from a wide
 variety of worlds and backgrounds.  The rules should cover personal combat, 
but not in such excessive detail as to make the use of guns the first recourse
 in problem solving...in fact, I\'ll go so far as to say that I see no particu-
lar reason why the rules for combat should be any more detailed than the rules
 for resolving any other skill use (heresy!!).  Especially since this aspect 
should be covered by the miniatures rules, which I understand are already in 
preparation.  One of the great attractions of the game has always been the 
character\'s potential ownership of a starship, allowing for that broad, free-
wheeling, multi-world, "This isn\'t Kansas anymore" flavor to the game.  Thus, 
ships should be covered in at least as much detail as they are now, if not a 
bit more.  A ship combat system should be provided that focuses on the prob-
lems of the typical player type ship--a scout or a free trader (or, as I 
suppose will be the case in Star Viking, an 800 ton cruiser).  Leave the fleet
 actions for a supplement.  As it stands now (in MT), a typical player vs. bad
 guys space combat leads you to combat table with three possible results for a
 hit: Weapon-1, Fuel-1, and Maneuver-1.  Not terribly exciting.  Since travel 
to different worlds is such a large part of the game, rules should be in place
 to help the referee detail and distinguish the worlds.  I think that the
World  Builder\'s Handbook does a pretty good job of this in the current
system...if  that\'s too much detail for the basic rules, then it should
certainly be one of  the early supplements.  Even in what I visualize as the
Star Viking setting,  trade will be a strong motivation for travel.  Thus I\'d
like to see a fairly  extensive set of trade rules, which should be based on
trading actual objects  rather than Industrial Goods, TL15, Va, Hi...more like
the old \'thirty tons of  silver\' system.  Some version of a vehicle design
system should be  included--the present one, despite its shortcomings is
pretty good about  allowing a referee to work up a few exotic pieces of
equipment to add to the  flavor of an unusual plant.  I\'d hate to see all
planets using M-1A1 tank  clones, just because we were now compatible with
Twilight:2000.  In keeping  with the science fiction theme, robots ought to be
part of the main rules, as  equipment even if not covered by design rules. 
Again, maybe reality demands a  compromise: Put an equipment list or simple
design system in the basic game,  and sell a detailed but still compatible
system as a supplement.  Background  information and equipment lists: as much
as will fit, without an undue empha- sis on military hardware.  Enough
information about all the major races to  allow the use of them as NPCs at
least.  

How to package all of this:  Well, I\'d like to see the following:

Core rules Miniatures rules with interface (I know this is in the plans
already). Miniatures for the rules!  (Why don\'t I play Striker?) Miniatures
for typical characters Fleet/system battles boardgame Boardgame compatible
with the miniatures rules, but at a higher level of
  abstraction (I\'d hate to try to loot a planet while trying to keep track
  of individual vehicles.) Alien supplements Detailed planet supplements Add-
on vehicle supplement Predesigned vehicles/robots supplements Introductory
adventure(s)

In terms of what\'s out there now, what I\'d like to see is rules that include 
the World Builder\'s Handbook and selected sections of the Starship Operator\'s 
Manual, a supplement equal to 101 Vehicles, 101 Robots and 101 Starships all 
in one, the completed series of DGP Aliens modules, a Traveller Adventure, and
 a Tarsus or a Beltstrike, the awaited Seeker Equipment guide, and some of the
 wargaming stuff.  

This post is going to be long enough.  Anyone else?

SUBJECTS:
 -THE revision; Good, Bad and Conclusions
 -revisions in general

   Before I get any further, I admit to not owning any of the Twilight system
games.  I have played both Twilight and 2300AD several times however, and I
have a "Christmas Morning" attitude toward nearly anything which appears in my
local game store, so I have perused Dark Conspiracy. I expect to buy one of
these games in the near future, in order to be more informed about the
revision.

 Good points about the revision:
   -Could attract many new players.
   -Taking Dark Conspiracy and Twilight: 2000 as models, we can expect to have
pictures of all the weapons and major equipment.
   -With GDW doing the revision, we should see more enthusiastic support for
Traveller (from GDW).
   -The playing-card-based NPC Personality system will become a part of
Traveller.
   -The "re-generification" of Traveller could allow for the inclusion of non-
Traveller technologies.  A section (echoed from GURPS Space) could detail the
different ways of dealing with star travel, both STL (Grav Drive, Thrusters,
LightSails, Ramships, and Generation Rockets) and FTL (Warp, Jump, Gates,
Wormholes, Stutterwarp, Infinite Improbability Drive, etc.).  Vector-thrust
(ala 2300AD) can be used as an alternative to Gravitics (in some cases), and
the "One Small Step" article can be made an official part of the game.
   -As mentioned in the previous item, previously published articles can be
incorporated into the rules at the start (assuming they are close enough
system-wise).  "One Small Step" and Wet Navy come to mind immediately, as does
an article about prototype-TL weapons in an issue of Space Gamer (one of the
last SJGames issues).

 Bad points about the revision:
   -No more Marc Miller.
   -Traveller has (at least temporarily) lost Rob Caswell as its technical
illustrator (this is not _directly_ tied to the revision, but is related, and
IS bad news).
   -Could cause the loss of many current Traveller players.
   -According to some research done by a TML member (I forget who), the
existing Traveller skill system is actually more realistic in some respects
than the Twilight skill system.
   -A system revision is like a U.S. Constitutional Convention.  Once started,
nothing that has gone before can be taken for granted.  If the ENTIRE system
is redone, all craft designs and sector listings could become obsolete, as the
rules for their creation change.
   -The oldest surviving SYSTEM in role-playing will have died. Traveller pre-
dates the AD&D Players Handbook by a year (I don\'t count the Monster Manual;
it was only a badly timed supplement), and no other game from that era
survives in anything like its original form (if it survives at all).
   -HIWG will be stripped of about half of its chances for publication (of
background, primarily).  Those who write scenarios will be largely uneffected
once they switch systems.

 Conclusions about the Revision:
   With the above points in mind, there are obviously some sections of the
rules than should not be changed.  Sections like world building and craft
design should produce results identical to the MegaTraveller rules.  How they
REACH those results might be worked on (the Shipbuilder\'s project being an
example), but too much change in the final product will totally invalidate
many years of work by GDW, DGP, HIWG, and hundreds of Traveller referees.
   One approach to simplify things (at first), would be to provide some 20 to
30 craft (with MT-style descriptions) in whatever will pass for the Basic Set.
This gives beginners a collection to start with, without sending them into
shock with 40+ pages of design rules.  Then, similar to what was done with
Dark Conspiracy (DarkTech), produce a book that covers the vehicle rules in
detail.  THIS book would contain ALL the construction rules, from robots thru
boats, planes and motorcycles to scoutships, fighters and dreadnoughts.  Well
okay, maybe it won\'t all FIT in one book, but this material should be released
as close together as possible. I waited 15 years for boats, and I don\'t want
to wait another 5 years to see them placed into the revision.  Having one of
these books reach Striker-level design (regarding lasers, Mass drivers,
warheads, etc.) might not be a bad idea, but the idea is to provide a layer
above this, where players can stop if they like.  The progression looks like
this:

  -\'Canned\' craft descriptions
  -Basic craft design (modularized?)
  -Detailed craft design (including robots, aircraft and watercraft, and
                          non-standard-tech space craft)
  -Ironmongery Design (ala Striker)
  -Hand Weapon design (an official conversion from 3G would suffice)

   The point is that a referee can stop at any of these steps, but not fear
incompatibility with a "deep designer" (someone like Scott Olson or Rob Dean)
who designs his craft lasers from the ground up.


 Revisions in general:
   Compared to the rest of the gaming world, 3 revisions in 15 years isn\'t bad
at all, and 2 revisions in 5 years is hardly the worst on record <finger-
pointing at certain other companies>.
   As a side note, it would be the third \'go-round for character generation
and craft (not ship) design, and only the second version of any craft/mass
combat rules (the section in Ref\'s Companion is a teaser, not a system).  This
would be either the fourth or FIFTH version of the ship-building rules (Book
2, High Guard, High Guard 2nd Ed, MegaTraveller, "Neo"Traveller) depending on
your opinion of the two editions of High Guard.  The ship combat system would
reach version 5 or 6 with NeoTraveller (add Mayday to the above list), and
personal combat would reach version 6 (Book 1, Snapshot, AHL, Striker,
MegaTrav, NeoTrav).

   Since the revision is a fact-to-be, do it RIGHT, and do it ONCE.

Yes! Things are really starting to move.  Mark, Glad to hear your input. Even
if you are basically negative about the switch of systems (not a bad thing)
I\'m glad you at least are familiar with it enough to know WHY. You know the
game system better than I do, I\'m sure.

I like Farstar\'s last line - Do it RIGHT, and do it ONCE! Somebody want to
make a banner and send it to GDW?

One of the things I personally like about the New System is the feeling you
get for your your character when generation is over. You don\'t just get skills
based on your chosen profession. You have to qualify for that profession
first. This may mean that you have to go to college first or do some outside
activities to improve a particular area you might be deficient in. Once you
are completed you have a really good idea of what your character has been
doing since about the age of 17. I always found the Traveller/MT system (and
even 2300AD) to be a little abstract. It gave you a handfull of skills but
didn\'t tell you too much about where they came from (2300AD is much worse than
MT in this respect).

I\'m really enjoying this exchange. Keep it up!

      Joe remarked in 3:405, "Us old-timers don\'t necessarily go in for
 the darker, more violent, less structured environments that the young
 gamers go in for."
      I\'m not so sure if \'young gamers\' shouldn\'t be \'current fad\'.  In
 a few years, it could be a dead as disco.
      But terminology aside, I think its very clear from the comments
 on this board that there is a real danger of alienating the
 \'old-timers\', and I don\'t think its something Traveller can afford.
 From what I can tell, Traveller has not had an appreciable turn-over
 of players.  It established a core group over a decade ago, and that
 is what has kept it alive all these years.  Loose them, and Traveller
 might not be around for long.
      Yet stagnation is another danger.  GDW should be free to be
 innovating and try things to bring in new blood.
      The best solution I can come up with right now is to let GDW wipe
 the slate and do what they will. Let the main body of the old Imperium
 follow its dark future.  BUT, maintain a very different and more
 traditional setting behind-the-claw.
      To Trailing, the Imperium wallows in decay and ruin, a prime
 setting for GDW\'s new initiative.
      To Spinward, the attitude is one of growth and vitality.  Here,
 the flavor of Classic Traveller is preserved.
      Players can then gravitate to the side they prefer most.  GDW
 doesn\'t have to commit itself either way, but balance support between
 the two according to how things really go.
                                                                   MIKE

Good. Y\'all seem to have the right idea here. Sorry if it it is a leading
question Rob but I wanted this topic to  go in a specific direction.   :)

If anybody is wondering wht I\'m concerned with this at all (since I\'ve already
admitted to not being that involved with Traveller at all up  to now). I
consider myself to be a potential purchaser of the new game. I\'ve been working
on and off on a conversion for 2300AD to the new system as I feel it to be
superior to the one given. I\'ve always been turned off by the huge volumes of
information in Megatraveller without an easy way for a new player to digest
(excuse the pun) it all. Without many SF games on the market it would be nice
to see the new game do well.

As to the stuff that is already set in stone... I don\'t know any more then you
do. I thought that Star VIking was going to be specifically a miniature game.
Am I wrong? Where\'s Loren when you need him? There IS supposed to be a novel
(according to Marc Miller) possibly written by Chuck Gannon. Other than that,
I don\'t know.

Personally, I would like to see starship combat rules done something like the
2300/Starcruiser setup (except maybe playtested this time  around). I would
like to see that any illustrations for equipment and weapons that will
translate over to the new game be taken from the existing stuff done for TD
and MTJ.

Thas\' all for now...

On the subject of what I want...

   1) Good vehicle rules: Striker was nice, but incomplete in some things.
      MT added some niceties, but chucked other nice things from Striker.
      
   2) Good ship construction rules: Some of the stuff in MT was a value add,
      other stuff was cruft.  DON\'T FORCE MERGE Starships/Spaceplanes with
      ground vehicles with grav vehicles.  I feel there was no need to 
      combine these two into a "universal" construction system.  Having a
      different system and design charts for Spacecraft/Aircraft/Ground Craft/
      Watercraft is not a bad thing.  Just \'cuz Grav Vehicles fuzz the line
      between ground and air is NOT a good reason to have ONE system.
      In this regard, Striker+High Guard was the best setup.

   3) Keep the "History Based" career generation, but merge the "term based"
      and "year based" systems.  Both have their good points, but the term
      careers jam you on the skills and the year careers have too much damn 
      rolling.  Some abstraction, would help this.

   4) Time (way past time) to alter the basic characteristics.  T1 is a 1977
      game system, very much showing it\'s age.  SOC should be removed
      as a characteristic, instead made a "thing" that is gained at certain
      levels, like a skill.  For a good example of this, look at "Mechwarrior"
      by Fasa.  Maybe characters can roll their basic character, then get
      X amount of points to flesh out the character.

      My suggestion for characteristics?
         Strength - Yeah, gotta have this
         Dexterity - and this, manual dexterity
         Endurance - general stamina and constitution
         Intelligence - I think this should be changed to Intellect
         Alertness - general ability to notice things
         Education - As before, but rolled differently (based on on a slight
           random factor plus modifiers for college and/or career

      Social is no longer a characteristic.

   5) While 2d6 is okay, perhaps a 2d10 scale could be used if you want to
      retain the curve, or 1d20.  1d10 is too flat and granular.

                     AS APPLIED TO THE REVISION TOPIC

With all the discussion going on, I decided I better have another look at 
Twilight:2000 just so that I could discuss the issue from a position of 
lesser ignorance.

As far as I can see it, the main things that a Traveller set of rules would 
use from Twilight:2000 are the character generation system (about 35 pages 
including a lot of illustrations and World War II/Earth specific material 
that would need to be completely altered), the "How to Be a Referee" (13 
pages, fairly generic, but does include 2 pages on skill use resolution), 
and the combat rules (35 pages, but does not cover a lot of science fic-
tional material presumably needed by Traveller.)  That\'s 83 pages out of 
280, and it includes a lot of material that would need substantial rework. 
Is it really worth sacrificing almost complete compatibility with all 
previous referees\' work and existing products in order to provide a poten-
tial new player a boost up by letting him roll 2d6-2 instead of 2d6 in 
character generation, and 1d10 instead of 2d6 for task resolution?  I don\'t 
think so.  I know that I have played a lot of games, but once the whole 
concept of being the gamemaster and winging it with no more than a vague 
idea of "Simple, Routine, Difficult, Formidable"  and a few die rolls has 
been absorbed (rather Difficult (-:), the additional business of shifting 
between 1d10, 2d6 or Skill(d6) between different games is fairly minor.

A Twilight:2000 character has six characteristics generated by rolling 2d6-
2 (with a reroll on a zero result).  A Traveller character has six charac-
teristics generated by rolling 2d6, and can gain values of up to 15 in the 
generation system.  The difference is that T:2000 substitutes Charisma for 
Trav\'s Social Standing.   Both games now use four year \'terms\' to add 
experience.  Most T:2000 terms will give a character 3-4 skill levels.  
Most Traveller terms will give a character about the same.  In T:2000 a 
skill is functionally limited by the value of its \'controlling characteris-
tic\'.  That is, if I have a character with a strength of 1, it will be 
difficult gain a high level of skill in Small Arms (Rifle) for an example.  
(Hmmm...).  In Traveller, a character is limited to a total of his educa-
tion and intelligence in skill levels.  I have an unsubstantiated (mathe-
matically) gut feeling that a skill level in Traveller is worth more than a 
skill level in T:200).  (See success chances below.)  In T:2000, a charac-
ter gets seven hit locations calculated on his body.  Traveller used an 
abstract system.  I have a few problems with the execution of the system in 
T:2000, but there\'s nothing too terrible about the idea of hit locations 
(other than that fact that they will be mostly irrelevant to a non-combat 
heavy game).  A T:2000 character with average strength and constitution 
values of 5 will have 10 head hit points, and 30 chest hit points.  A 
critical wound to the chest (more than 2*h.p.) will knock him unconscious.  
That is to say, 61+ points of damage.  This is the same value required to 
render an elephant unconscious, and can be delivered by 3 average 
damage .50 caliber machine gun bullets, 9 average damage M-16 5.56N bul-
lets, 18 average 9mm pistol bullets, or 25 average arrows.  "It\'s safe to 
charge them--all they have is a hunting bow..."

Regarding skill levels, I present the following chart, showing the chances 
of various outcomes using the T:2000 system.

Skill    Outstanding Success  Success   Failure   Catastrophic Failure
  1              0%             10%       36%               54%
  2              0%             20%       40%               40%
  3              0%             30%       42%               28%
  4              0%             40%       42%               18%
  5             10%             40%       40%               10%
  6             20%             40%       36%                4%
  7             30%             40%       30%                0%
  8             40%             40%       20%                0%
  9             50%             40%       10%                0%
 10             60%             40%        0%                0%

Since a typical very skilled Traveller has a three or a four in his main 
skill, it can be seen that a Traveller skill level must be worth more than 
a T:2000 skill level (otherwise most ship\'s engineers would damage their 
drives on a routine repair attempt 28% of the time.)  So,m a typical T:2000 
character is probably less capable at any given age than a typical Travel-
ler character.  This, by the way, is my major objection to T:2000/2nd as a 
revision of T:2000/1st----given the background, I thought that having par-
ties made up of extremely capable characters was quite reasonable.  A 
T:2000/2 party wouldn\'t last very long up against a T:2000/1 party.

If a revision consisted only of grafting on a combat system based around 
the seven hit locations and so forth, I\'d have no strong objection.  After 
all, it\'s been done before.  As someone pointed out, a NewTrav would repre-
sent the fifth or sixth personal combat system.  I think that this could be 
done in such a way as to leave the current character values the same--a two 
point shift in the average value of characteristics can be compensated for 
by a shift in weapons\' damage values, if necessary.  I think a move toward 
a less random character generation system would be acceptable, providing 
that the average number of skills gained stayed about the same.  I think a 
move to the d10 skill resolution system and away from the 2d6 universal 
task system is a bad idea, unless compensated for by an increase in the 
average level of skills, which would be a bad idea because of the compati-
bility problems.  Tasks are one of the few non-problem areas in MT, at 
least in routine usage.  (I usually trim back on the fumble rolls when in 
actual play.) 

Enough for now.

In regard to the new revision of Traveller, I have very much mixed
feelings.  On the one hand, I am quite pleased that GDW is going to
fix the awful mess that the MegaTraveller rules have become.  I frown
somewhat upon the fact that the system is being changed, because it
will cause to modify a lots of things in my notebooks on Traveller,
but I\'m willing to approach that with an open mind.  I\'ve played the
Twilight 2000 system about a half-a-dozen times, and I remember it
being a fairly quick, easy to use system.  I\'d definitely classify it
as an improvement over the current Traveller system.  

However, what does displease me about the change was the apparent
desire to uproot the entire world view that has been presented for
fifteen years.  If the Imperium is effectively thrown away, in return
for this "Star Viking" campaign, set nominally within the same
history-structure, you\'re going to lose the support of almost every
old Traveller player, something that will be impossible to recoup with
a new, younger audience.

In conclusion, what I\'d like to see for a third edition?  A new
system, if it\'s cleaner and better.  Books that are better proofread
and hold together as a whole.  The Imperium Background, as we know it.
Lots of supplements focusing on the background of the game, not the
mechanics (ie stuff like DGP\'s excellent Alien Supplements, and
the Imperial Encyclopedia, not 101 Vehicles and Fighting Ships).

This note is kind of in response to the TML and the GENIE postings you\'ve
been placing. I print out all the TML for a local group of MT fans here
in Columbia, so this is actually coming from about 5 different people. Would
you mind passing this along to Genie and the GDW staff?

Our biggest worry about the "new" version of MT is that the old data we
have will become - again - obsolete, and we\'ll spend forever trying to learn
a new gaming "system". We found long ago how \'broke\' the old rules were, and
just passed over them as best we could, but another revision in rules will
slow things down again. We\'re also very worried that the new product will have
quite a few faults in it. MT wasn\'t put together well, and discovering HOW
to do things was often more difficult than just faking it outright - which
ended up causing numerous disagreements among our gaming group.

I guess what it boils down to is this: Will we be able to utilize the old
material from \'classic traveller\' and the stuff that we\'ve developed out of
MT in this new version? Or is it a completely new investment in a new game
with an old theme?

Thanks,

   Hmmm, so little time and so much to do.......

   Attempting to ignore all other comments and taking a real fast look (though
probably incomplete).

   Well here\'s a possible book layout:

The 3 basic:
   Character generation, Combat (land, sea, air, space; integrated),
     travelling (excuse the pun) and Medical (including \'borgs, yeah
     here\'s your chance for Cyberpunkism, but I\'d suggest a better
     job than 2300AD).
   Background Book, Trade and Commerce rules.
   Equipment Book (guns, vehicles, regular stuff, using DGP\'s equipment
                  form (and possibly Rob Prior\'s one for vehicles)).

The Expansion:
   World Builders handbook (it would be nice to see a true alien system
                            type generation rather than Trav\'s oxy-nitro).
   Vehicle construction book (land, sea, air, space, and \'bots; no bugs
                             and clear examples; and striker weapons
                             would be nice).
   MTA books [I\'m tired of seeing humans everywhere I land :), the cover of
Challenge 53(?) had more aliens on it than I\'ve seen in Traveller and at first
I thought it was supposed to be a Star Wars cover till I read the blurb; In
Star Wars it aliens, aliens everywhere and Traveller it\'s humans, humans
everywhere. That\'s the feeling I get anyway].
    Sector Book (I\'m still awaiting the one from the rebellion period, I\'d
also like to see the worlds change as time goes on, maybe with something like
Torg\'s feedback system to give the idea of the changing universe as time
passes. TNS by itself is too abstract).


    [Aside, I\'d like to still see GE as this would be still useful regardless
of the background].

    Anyway, first off, I AM NOT PLANNING ON HOLDING GDW TO IT\'S DEADLINE, I\'D
RATHER SEE IT DONE RIGHT THAN RUSHED OUT, I\'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE THE SUPPORT
PRODUCTS COME OUT IN A TIMELY MATTER AFTERWARDS.

    Okay, enough shouting for now. By support products I mean supplements and
most especially adventure projects. The first adventure product should be a
campaign type book or a series of adventures. Enough to get the GM going for
awhile.

    <Modifying Character Generation rules> I like the flexibility of the DC
design system, in that I can create the character I want with the skills I
want. But I also like the promotion, medal and yearly event system of
Traveller. There are two ways to go about this that I can see of offhand, one
way is to retain the table system, but just allow the character to pick off
the table. The other is to have just the skill list like DC, with a
possibility each term of attending a special school and getting more skill
points in a related set.  Offhand I\'d prefer dropping as many tables as
possible, this would make it easier to modify the character generation system
to my whims and fancies and easier to create new professions (and tailor the
character to the world they might have lived on).
    So much for the quick comment.
    <Modifying vehicle/starship construction rules> I\'d just like a realistic
bug free version here, with the addition of Mark Gelinas additions to starship
construction. The possible exception is Bill Hezeltine\'s fast design system
(not having seen the completed system I can\'t say for sure). The only other
problem I have is in possibly using weight in starship agility rules and the
agility rules themselves (weight tends to shift a lot on a starship, and the
agility rules had problems as many people will testify too. Also seeing STL
rules added and other such stuff would be okay too.
    It would also be nice to see Airlocks used with some consistency. (why are
they there if not to be used?)
    <Vehicle Combat> I\'d like to see the same system for
air/ground/space/water (well, as similar as possible). Using something like
Roger Myhre\'s point based ship combat system would be a step in the right
direction.
    <Trade and Commerce rules> I like the MT version, it tended to resemble
the adventure plots more than the old. And as for it being slightly abstract
(Robert Dean mentioned he preferred \'30 tons of silver\' used in the old
system, he forgot the problems of \'30 tons of computer parts\' or \'30 tons of
weapons\'), so was the old system, in the later case I needed to try and create
subtables of what the possible items could be.
    Under the old rules I could get pretty wealthy with the right trade route
and a few hundred thousand in cash. Under the MT revision, the old adventure
set-ups made more sense. The starships constructed should keep in mind the
trade and commerce rules too (it\'s pretty stupid to design a merchant ship
that can\'t support itself on the average).

=============================

    Mike Mikesh idea of a dark Imperium and Light Behind the Claw setting is a
good one and I like it (it also matches most of the facts of what might
occur).
    As far as the Hard Times/Star Vikings setting is concerned, the problems I
see with this is that it should be short-lived (or trade was obviously more
important than heretofore given credit, or the damage much more severe than
credited to date). Also what are the other Empires doing, while the Imperial
interior is falling apart, sitting around playing tiddly winks? I could excuse
the Vargr, the Aslan to a minor extent, the Solomani are apparently having
internal problems(? most be major), the Zhodani have to contend with other
projects, and the Spinward Marches are still pretty intact and have new blood
and resources via the Aslan. That still leaves the Hivers and the K\'Kree (time
to start a war between the two perhaps?), and how do you slow the Aslan down
(I\'d vote for adding to the solomani problems and start a war on that front
too).
    If GDW is going to to a succesful job of having this dark future in the
Imperium, they are going to have to do a much better job of detailing the
background with specifics to give the GM ideas of how to deal with it. Just
saying the Imperium is having a Dark Night doesn\'t give me the feeling of it,
the Imperium is just too large to identify this with, I\'d want to see some of
the feeling of Shadowrun, Cyberpunk, or even some of the descriptive effects
of DC, a novel wouldn\'t be bad, an example of major worlds and their
surrounding systems with a before and after effect might even be better.

    Well, I spent enough time on this today, gotta do my other stuff.

Rob,

In the Dark Conspiracy version of the system, characters end up wiht more
skills on the average than in straight T2k. Hopefully, this will be the same
for the new system. Hey, I should add that to my wish list!

Greetings to all concerned. My name is Metlay, and I am the Historian for the
Internet Traveller Mailing List. I do not yet have access to GEnie (although
this may change in time for the RTC), and am posting here by the kind graces
of fellow Traveller-head and musician Rob Dean (well, he SAYS he\'s a musician,
but nothing HE plays can be plugged in. But I digress), to whom I offer
thanks. I have been playing Traveller since the original three books (I know,
I know, who hasn\'t in this bunch?), and have been  published twice in the JTAS
and once upcoming in MTJ3, or so Rob Caswell said.

Apology #1: I\'m not going to pussyfoot around-- I am a Traveller-Classic
curmudgeon, and unashamed of the fact. Please take my comments accordingly.

Apology #2: I enjoy talking and writing for the sake of doing so. I save
brevity for my scientific output in the journals. If I get a bit wordy, please
forgive me.

News of the Traveller rules revision wasn\'t much of a surprise to me; I keep
close enough company with various folks to have an ear to the ground. What DID
knock me flat was the proposed future history of Star Viking. For the purposes
of clarity, I\'m going to divide my comments into two parts: one on the concept
of revision to the rules themselves, and one on the Star Viking future
history.

On the rules revisions: frankly, I don\'t give a damn. I\'ve been playing Trav
Classic for so many years that I don\'t even open the rule books any more; the
only part of the rules that I use consistently is character generation. With a
good party of players, I wing the rest. Once in a while, I add rules for
things that I find glaringly omitted; the current MT rules systems on
nonlethal weapons are based on one of my articles in JTAS, and the Type A2 Far
Trader came from a suggestion I made in 1978. But for the most part, I adapt
and let the rules take care of themselves. It\'s just not an issue to me-- game
mechanics that work are nice but not necessary.

On the other hand, as Historian of the TML, I have built up a huge database of
information on the Imperium, and have always admired the consistency and scope
of the future vision the Traveller rules have espoused. The Imperium and
surrounds, from the first hints in "The Kinunir" that there was a planet
called Regina to the huge map we have today, surpasses any other universe in
the gaming world. More information, more references, more detail. Not even
BattleTech, with its endless cascade of 30-dollar library books, or Shadowrun,
with module after module of jacked-in elf maidens with huge ta-tas, has
matched the fourteen years of output that have made the Imperium what it is.
The problem with such a well-developed system is that it becomes  monolithic
and immutable. Sudden changes to the worldline can be catastrophic. And a
decision to totally shift the game\'s focus can have a shattering effect far
worse than that of the three bullets for Stref, Mrs. Stref, and Baby Stref.

There were gaping and growing holes in the scientific and technical background
of Traveller since the beginning: in TClassic, computers had less processing
power than Hewlett-Packard calculators, and in MT, the basic assumptions about
maneuver drive were mangled in favor of a nonphysical, ridiculous and useless
idea of "thruster plates". (Sorry, but I\'m a physicist. I can forgive antigrav
under the right circumstances, and even FTL for the sake of a good game, but
thrusters violate basic conservation laws and serve no purpose whatever in 
doing so). But these were fixable, ultimately: if a half dozen widely-used
sectors could be obliterated from the map with one wave (anyone wanna buy an
old Ley Sector map? Not the GDW one-- the JUDGES\' GUILD!), problems with the
technology and consistency of the hardware were trivial to deal with.  Not a
problem....

There were gaping and growing holes in the sense of historical flow and 
precedent in the Traveller universe, but these were largely staged by Marc
Miller, whose guiding vision made a lot of worldshaking events seem not only
possible, but even halfway reasonable after some prodding. The Zhodani AREN\'T
baby crushing scumbags, fine. The Droyne are the Ancients, fine. The Aslan
aren\'t a Major Race, fine. The Darrian Star Trigger doesn\'t work, fine. Not a
problem....

The point I\'m making (forgive me, and pity the TML, who have to read through
this shovelling all the damn time) is that the Universe could take a little
poking and prodding to rearrange the bits that didn\'t quite jibe. 

But...STAR VIKING?!

Let me see if I have this straight. A horrible superduper computer virus  gets
released and causes every computer in the Universe to lock up.  Civilization
falls apart, and bands of freebooters with laser guns and swords battle for
control of what\'s left. 

Uh-huh. I tried this one out on my best friend\'s nephew, who\'s eight years
old, and HIS comment was, "Gimme a break." His older brother, a tender 
twelve, said, "What is it supposed to be-- bad H. Beam Piper or bad Frank
Herbert?"

Nobody\'s buying it, that I know of. And if people don\'t buy it, well, it 
won\'t sell. It is, simply put, a stupid concept. Like Being Hit On The Head
Lessons. There are other systems that could allow the usual inane munchkins
out there an afternoon\'s diversion with such ideas with a  minimum of fuss and
bother-- a GURPS Space variant, say. But why drag the Imperium-- THE IMPERIUM!-
- - into this morass of idiotic pseudoscifi?

Fourteen years of development and eleven thousand years of history deserve a
bit more than "Whoops, a computer virus wiped it all out. Game over."

The revision is a fine idea. It fixes problems with MT, allows GDW to continue
hiring people like Blair Reynolds, Larry Elmore and Dave Dietrick to make
their materials look like they give a damn who buys them, and (most
importantly for GDW) opens a new avenue for income. Traveller reborn into the
1990s!

A recurrent conversation with Loren Wiseman at the six GenCOns we saw each
other for, 1984 to 1989, was: 

"Gonna come watch Near Miss this year, Loren?" "Too tired, Metlay-- after you
do this for a living, GAMING loses its luster."

He was right. GDW is not in this entirely, or even mostly, out of love of
gaming any more. They\'re in this to make money. To survive in a market  where
it seems FASA can do no wrong (*ugh*). And an update of Traveller to meet the
challenge is sensible-- it combines the Traveller mystique  with a fresh new
look. I applaud their courage and advertising vision.

But they\'d better have a future history on line that\'s a damn sight more
interesting than rehashed Battletech if they want to keep their old fans and
make any new ones.

PS. Would anyone be interested in a Traveller Classic novel based on the
characters in the aforementioned Near Miss Traveller Tournaments?

Input to this point noted.
     Very little is cast in stone at this time. We will redesign the game. The
name will be some variation of Traveller, not MegaTraveller.  Star Viking will
NOT contain any of the new system rules...it will be a miniatures game
(possibly including miniatures in the box) that will focus on one aspect of an
advanced timeline.
     Dave Nilsen and the rest of us have discussed the possibility of several
things suggested here, and we will have more to say at the RTC in a couple of
weeks.

 Ok.  What I want to see (and a little of what I don\'t).

Well, to get the bad over with first, what I _dont_ want to see.

  The T2k/Dark Conspiracy system used.  I\'m serious...the more I think about
it, the more I think it\'d be a mistake.  I\'m all for a revision, but changing
the system this much would be a mistake. I\'ll leave it at that for right now.

What I _DO_ want:

1)   A fully integrated and complete system.  ONE book, ONE volume. I like the
concepts expressed here and elsewhere about "layering." Let the game volume
have, at the least, the minimum rules needed for a particular area.  Later on
(better yet, at the same time) put out other volumes to expand on particular
areas.  If you want the extra detail, you can get it there.  If you don\'t you
can get by well enough by whats in the basic set.

2)   A task system.  In no uncertain words.  Regardless of what system is used
(in fact, a retrofitting of a task system into T2k/DC would be of benefit as
well).  This has the benefit of "genericizing" the skill system enough to
negate the need for detailed rules on many specialized subjects.

3)   An object-oriented approach, ala AI would be very nice. Wouldn\'t be very
hard, either IMHO.  THAT in itself would do a lot towards opening up the rules
system to beginners.

4)   An integrated vehicle design system...in fact, I\'m quite happy with the
current version.  Perhaps streamlined and with more options (Wet Navy, the
Challenge rocket/interplanetary vehicle rules, ROBOTS!, etc...).  Integrating
on several scales might be better...there are disadvantages to having a design
system for charcter\'s ships that has to be used to build a dreadnought.  I\'m
going to think some on this.

5)   Greatly, greatly expanded character generation.  I like what Jay was
saying about the rules giving a sense of "background history" to the
character.

6)   A much improved starship combat system...while we are getting STAR
VIKING, I really wished it wasn\'t miniatures based.  I want _this_ one
focusing more on playable scales...most characters won\'t (or shouldn\'t!) be
fighting DN\'s.  Two traders, or a small patrol vessel against some fighters,
OTOH....

More later,

Mark

Loren,
    I can send you a copy of the TML archives if you want, contained therein
are a lot of the comments about their problems with MT and an attempt at some
fixes. The only problem is sifting through the material (about 10+ megabytes
worth).
    The other option is if there is someone on the TML willing to take the
time to seperate out the pertinent data (I don\'t have the time currently or I
would).

I too vote on character generation revision. That was one part of the game
that I wish it could be changed. Since the New rules will be based on TW2000,
this is probably a good thing. The players will have a bit more freedom on the
skills obtained.

Having heard via the grapevine that a revision is in the works I had to come
on line long enough to put in my wishes. A truly 3-d combat system and a 3-d
universe. I doubt I\'ll get it, but it is ridiculous for a "hard" science space
game to be 2-d. Thanks.

I have three hopes for the new Traveller revision :

1)	Keep the Task System
2)		Keep the Task System
3)			Keep the Task System.

I do not have T:2000/2 but I do have DC and I have found the DC \'task\'
system very primitive compared to MT/2300AD. So keep the task sytem -
at least for non-combat skill resolution.

Along the lines of the current revision discussion, confidence in GDW,
hopes for the future, and so forth....

No offense, but a friend of mine and I have been saying for years that
GDW should do something drastic about their proofing / editing department.
They\'ve been having troubles since late Classic Traveller with basic
typographic problems -- missing tables, paragraphs, scrambled or obviously
missing words, etc.  For instance, the amusing bit in _Secret of the
Ancients_ where the last sentence in one of the paragraphs just breaks
off, or the famed "Dulinor was appointed in the year 0000" line in the
Rebellion Sourcebook, or any number of other memorable mistakes.  Even
my circa 1977 black books were better proofed than some of this new stuff.
It would improve confidence greatly if we didn\'t have to be continually
trying to get errata to the errata to fix this sort of thing!

Right now, and correct me if I\'m mistaken, most players seem to play
Traveller because of the *SETTING* and not the rules.  I agree, I only
use the rules as a marginal guideline, but the rich and varied setting
has great potential as it stands.  I\'m concerned about any massive
changes in the setting because it risks destroying the game.  Rules
changes, while of concern, are a bit more flexible for me.  

The idea of a "light behind the claw" and a Shattered Imperium of several
interstellar states of various sizes from tiny to huge might make a good
compromise.  Most of the "old-timers" are very familiar with the Marches,
making the area ideal for "Classic Traveller".  I\'ll still miss the old
empire though.  Before, the fringe areas were usually just fine for the
sort of thing "Star Viking" sounds like to me.  The clash of the
superpowers and the cosmopolitan scope of the empire were a lot of fun,
and have become so hard to arrange now....

debate about the upcoming Traveller revisions and rumors.

I\'m going to state some self evident (at least to me) observations
inorder to establish a base from which to discuss an idea.

Obviously, everyone is very fond of the game and have put considerable
time and effort into their own campaigns.

It appears most are professionals or about to be professionals and
therefore are knowledgeable in a variety of fields (eventhough 
computers and physics seem to dominate ;-)).

Some are even actively involved in game production ( scenario and
equipment design, stories, etc.). 

Everyone has modified their games to incorporate individual, official,
semi-official corrections and ideas. Some of these ideas have been
posted and there are probably more that haven\'t but are equally as 
detailed and interesting.

>From all of this it would seem that at least a few of you would
have gotten together by now and compiled a set of "house" rules.
Then again maybe you have and I don\'t know about it! (hint, hint :-))

Essentially, what I\'m trying to write is: has anyone suggested to
the companies involved (i.e. DGW) that with all of this "expertise"
available that it could be used as a profitable source of ideas. I 
know the first thing a company looks at is "How much is it going to
cost." but with the avid group of players here I would think that 
acknowledged credit would be enough for most (I think most
submissions to the periodicals are not compensatable anyway).

It seems to me that the basic core rules have generated the most
problems. So, what I see would be a revised set of rules, like the
"house" rules mentioned above, submitted by the authors, that would
cover the basics ( character generation, starship design, equipment
design, skills, world generation, etc.). Everyone has suggestions
and most seem to be similar to each other. A good editor could put
these together into a coherent and acceptable package.
(The conference occuring on Genie about "What would you like to see
in future releases/revisions." seems to be headed in this direction.
If any of the input is really used!)

The historical background, future background and scenario construction
should come from GDW or other appropriate sources. This is the 
information that makes the game. Fifteen years of Traveller has 
generated a considerable amount of information. This shouldn\'t be 
wasted but expanded upon. To me any rules system could be used but 
it\'s the background that adds the spice.

I know most companies are not receptive to outside help (otherwise
how would they justify the existence of their employees) but with 
some already on the payroll, so to speak, it would seem easier to
get these ideas introduced. Besides, the employees could be used to
generate the ideas for the background information. Once the rules
are produced, modules keep the system going (if you need an example
look at TSR and the D&D, AD&D systems!).

Probably the one thing that prevents this is time! I know I don\'t
have a lot of it to devote to my hobbies and such and most of you
are likely in a similar situation but even so it would seem with you
"hard core" types that something would have been accomplished by now.

The Joint European Tourus (JET) Labs nr Didcot, England, did
achieve fusion for about 2 seconds generating about 2.5 MWatts,
from an input energy of about 10 times that !
This may not sound like much - but it is an improvement on past efforts.

However, before you all start leaping up and down with glee expecting
fusion generators to be just around the corner, you should know that
the next phase in the testing is the best part of *TWO YEARS* away
when about twice as much tritium (3g) will be used to trigger the reaction,
and that it\'s estimated that a sustained reaction of at least 30 minutes
will be required to make fusion practical :-(

.... oh well, one day ... :-)

Secondly re. all this talk of Gyro-stabilisation of weapons (3089 etc..),
Canon (the camera people) have been developing a 300mm  f2.8 lens that
features an anti-camera shake feature controled by ultra-sonic motors (USM)
that detects movement of the lens when in use and moves the lens elements
to compensate.

So what has this to do with guns ?

Extrapolate from the small beginings Canon are making to more powerful
TL10+ USMs. Slap those on a gun (even a laser) along with a controlling
computer and while they don\'t do anything for recoil they could be
*very* good at damping unwanted weapon movement.

And while on the subject of weapons - will caseless ammo\' help cut down
the need for gyro-stablisers ?

Well, minor details such as how to get multiple shots may have evolved
separately, but the important advances, i.e. how to get any shots, evolved
pretty much in parallel.  Matchlock, flintlock, percussion cap, cartridge;
all these appeared in longarms and pistols at around the same time, and
certainly in the same sequence.  (There were also wheellock pistols; I don\'t
know if there were wheellock muskets, but the wheellock was an expensive and
unreliable mechanism anyway, and was shortly replaced by the flintlock.)

> So, is your blaster a revolver or a semi-auto?  (full auto PGMP? WOW!)

"I know what you\'re thinking.  \'Did he fire 1000 shots, or only 999?\'  Well,
to tell you the truth, in the excitement I kind of lost count myself.  But
bearing in mind that this is the Heckler-Colt, the most powerful PGMP in the

"Volume 1:  Atom bomb through Grenade Launcher"  -- Calvin

What I want in a new traveller rule set.

Adventures
- ----
MegaTrav suffers from a lack of them.  How many are there?  Flaming Eye,
Knightfall.  That\'s it!  There are some other things out there that are
in the corners of Challenge, Trav Digest and The Rebellion Sourcebook,
but THAT\'S IT!  Zilch!  Nothing!  Zero!

The two adventures above... Well, I won\'t run Knightfall, and there\'s
little in there that is useful for inspirations for other adventures.
Flaming Eye?  Well, I liked it better.  There is more that is useful
for inspiration, but again, I doubt I\'d use the adventure as published.

The best adventure put out so far in MegaTrav is Nail Mission at the end
of Rebellion Sourcebook.  It has the most potential, the neatest premise
for a mission.  Go out through hostile territory, under cover and get
the missing piece of a disintigrator that will help save the Domain.
The other adventures put out so far are pretty much run from the fleets
and TRY to stay alive.
Unfortunately, it is not given more than a few pages, and you need the
star maps of the Domain, which I don\'t have.  So I doubt I\'d run it as
set.  I might use the idea, but not as set.

Rules
- ----
There are too many F**KING RULE BOOKS!  You have a million different
sections scattered in half a million different places and NO thought
given to organization.

When running a game, I don\'t have time to root through a million different
books to find the \'Correct\' rule.  Hmmm was that section on zero gravity
environments in the Ref\'s guide, the Players handbook, the starship
operator\'s manual, the encyclopedia or the rebellion sourcebook?...
Generally, I wing it, as all refs probably should, but imagine for a moment
that I haven\'t been playing trav for years?  Ok, I\'m a new gamer, never
seen this Traveller before.  I\'ve got a million different rules... I have
to remember them... Right?

Lets see, weapon performance is in the player\'s hand book, but their cost and
weight is in the encyclopedia??

They need organization.

How about one book devoted to character development, one book for design and
performance rules, one book for combat, one book for trade and commerce...
Later, when new ideas get incorporated, you could put out a suppliment for
that book. (Classic trav fans:  Sound familiar?)
That way at least when you have a question you need to look up, you can
narrow down the books you need by their subject.  If a book comes out on a
topic you never use, Don\'t buy it!

I agree there should be a basic set.  But don\'t come out with stuff on a
million different subjects and pack them in a book called \'miscellaneous\'!
Miscellaneous junk always gets LOST!

As it is now, the MegaTrav rules should be listed as Miscellaneous Player
junk, Miscellaneous Ref Junk, and Miscellaneous Encyclopedia Junk! After
that came Miscellaneous volume 1, and 2.  The only organized book to come
out was COACC.  It took on one subject and stuck to it!

I know, some of you might be saying, well, if the player doesn\'t want to
use a book, then they won\'t buy it and GDW/GDP are after all out to make
Money!  You can\'t make much money selling things that fewer people will buy!
Well, my argument to this is that you won\'t make ANY money trying to sell an
unplayable game!

Vehicle Design
- ----
I LIKE being able to design my own stuff.

I agree with whoever said it first.  We don\'t need a single system for
construction, we need a Consistant system for construction.  You can\'t
design a car and a plane to use the same engine.  If you do, you will
either overheat at the side of the road, or crash from an overweight
engine.  That\'s why we don\'t have flying cars today.

There are similar problems involved in trying to make a system that is
used to design a car and a boat.  Or a car and a spacecraft.  etc.

Robots:  The old book 8 is inaedequate.  It needs updating.  Robots are
popular in Science Fiction and trav doesn\'t have a decent system to use
them.  I would also suggest it be a system by which LARGE robots may be
built.  Sure!  Capture some of the BattleTech crowd!  Sell the stuff!
Keep the company in business!

Spacecraft:  I don\'t like reactionless drives.  Anti-Grav and Jump drives
are ok, We need Faster than light stuff to keep the Imperium intact.
Anti-Grav?  Well, It\'s one of the meats of science fiction.  It\'s too fun
to leave it out.

What I\'d like to do with Trav drives?  Scrap the Thrusters.  Put in Fusion
rockets as drive sysems.  Ok, that makes take off and landings tough.
The ships would burn through the tarmac with their jets.  Ok, so how \'bout
this:  Close to the ground, a ships internal gravitation field can provide
a small amount of thrust.  Enough to lighten ship so that it can take off
at powers that don\'t burn through concrete.

What\'s with the 6-G limit?  Why is it there?  It serves no purpose.
Fusion rockets can put out as much thrust as you can pack into the ship.

Come out with one book.
Chapter 1:  Space and Star Ships
Chapter 2:  Grav Vehicles
Chapter 3:  Robots
Chapter 4:  Aircraft/Helicopters/Airships
Chapter 5:  Ground Vehicles
Chapter 6:  Water Vehicles	etc. etc.

Provide Clear Examples!

Sure some of it might be redundant!  Who cares!  If each section is clearly
explained, it won\'t matter!  If it can be used easily then people will buy
it!

Computers
- ----
Trav computers need updating.  The basic ideas haven\'t changed since they
were introduced 15 years ago in book 2.  A lot has been done in the past
15 years with computers.  New ideas thought of, new capablities imagined.
Trav computers are too vague to deal with it.  We need something that will
allow the incorporation of Cyber Punk type stuff.  This will make traveller
appeal to a broader base.  Sell more games!  The more games they sell, then
maybe they can get around to putting out some GOOD stuff again!

There is no explanation of what a \'Model 1\' is.  I remember there was an
article a long time ago, which called the Apple II the equivalent of a
model 2.  Well, I rather doubt that.  I don\'t think an Apple II has the
power to control a two parsec jump!

So is it a Cray or what?

As to the power shown by them, a model 1 can provide a +1 for hitting
targets at space craft type ranges, but only provides a +1 to hit targets
at tank to tank ranges.  The thing can carry a starship across a parsec,
but hardly provides any extra targeting power for a tank a hundred meters
away!  Something is very wrong here!

Another problem is that they come \'off the shelf\' no modifications really
possible, no explanations, and no tech level effects past TL 8.  Come on!
A TL 11 hand computer is supposed to have the same power as a model 1!
But even a TL 15 model 1 weighs/costs the same as the TL 8!

Possible solution:  (Hold on to your hats!)  How about a computer design
system?  Take the Book 8 robot brain system, it is inaedequate, but it\'s a
start.  You could build a computer from the ground up.  Install CPU units,
programming, memory as desired.  (A grav tank hardly needs programs for a
jump drive!) Computer power could be devided up for different tasks.  What
is needed is someone to decide, Ok, a \'model 1\' computer has such and such
a capability.  To build a computer to provide a +1 die modifier for
performing task Y, you need X amount of CPU, storage, etc.

Also incorporable would be tech level effects.  At TL 9 Silicon Carbide
will step in making computers more radiation hard.  At TL 10 Diamond
semiconductors will take over making them MUCH more so.  You could add
electronic circuit protection to make them more so, and at high TL, these
will be competative with the fiber optic models in terms of radiation
hardness.

Now you can still have \'off the shelf\' models for lazy designers who don\'t
wanna worry about it, you could even optimize such systems by making them
cost a little less or weigh a little less.
(was anything like this discussed in TDR?)

Star Viking
- ----
Now it\'s ground combat?  Is there still an imperium eating virus out there?

I think folks are forgetting a few things.  If these Star Vikings are to
be travelling around somehow, they\'re gonna need a computer to travel from
star system to star system, and even from planet to planet.  Jump drives
won\'t work without a computer!  Hell, fusion power plants won\'t work without
one either!  (not to mention fusion/plasma guns... particle/meson accelerators)

I don\'t think you can come up with a believable explanation that all the big
computers failed leaving us with the big computers that are necessary for the
story!  (sounds like a very selective virus to me)  How is Anything high
tech gonna work without computers?

If you ask me, I think trav needs MORE emphisis on computers.  There are a lot
of young gamers out there who are into computers.  If you wan\'t them to put
their money down you can\'t eliminate the computers!

Twilight 2000
- ----
Never played it.  Have heard there are problems.

Converting over to the system?  Well, I said before I LIKE designing my own
vehicles!  Perhaps if they want they should convert the T2K vehicle system
to the Traveller system.  I turned out traveller versions of the Abrams,
M-60, T-72, T-80 and others.  Admittedly the versions I came up with weren\'t
perfect, but that is due to problems with the design system as it is now.
That could be corrected in a future re-write.  Especially with a computer
design system.

Ok, that\'s enough rambling and moaning out of me.
Thanks,

   My thoughts on Neo-Traveller:

   Quite honestly, many of the changes (and certainly many of the rumors)
don\'t thrill me. I\'ve been playing Traveller since 1982 and there\'s a lot of
things I\'d like to preserve.

  -Things I want kept:
   The task system. In my opinion, it\'s much better than  Twilight\'s skill
resolution. Twilight characters seem incompetent  except at the high skill
levels. The MT task system is easy to  use, flexible, and versatile. It\'s
probably the best thing MegaT changed.

   Characters. I don\'t care if the generation rules change. In fact, they
probably should be changed to give players more  control. However, I would
like characters created under the MT rules to be usable in Neo-Trav, without
having to be converted. I have a feeling that these two points are things that
I won\'t get, but I feel that I should try.

   Worlds. Again, some of the mechanics could be changed, but the  end result
should be the same. Yes, those results are often not very logical, but I don\'t
want to throw out all those sector listings.

   Basically, I\'m not in favour of converting Traveller to the  Twilight
system. Yes, the rules need to be cleaned up and they need to be more
accessible to new gamers, but this seems like an unnecessary change, and one
that will irritate a great majority of current players. (Here on GEnie and in
several conversations,  I\'ve only come across one response that was more
positive than "I can live with it if I have to", and most were firmly
opposed.)

   There are some good points about a revision, I admit. The MT rules can be a
bit impenetrable. A revised rule set could help attract new gamers to the
universe. Things that I would approve of changes to include:

   Combat. The current rules are pretty abstract, and, while I don\'t mind
them, a bit more detail and colour would be nice. I\'m not terribly attached to
the current rules, and if a less  abstract system helps attract gamers, then
by all means change  it.

   Craft Design. Quite frankly, the current rules are just too  hard to work
with. Any design system that requires a spreadsheet is too complex. Please
replace them, though they might be better placed in their own supplement.

   Accessibility. MT is just too hard for new gamers to pick up. Neo-Trav has
to be easier to learn.

   As for the setting: 
   I\'m very worried that Neo-Trav is beginning to sound like  Twilight: 5700.
While it\'s clear that it will have a darker tone than Classic Traveller, I
don\'t think that the collapse of inter- stellar civilization (if that is
indeed GDW\'s plan) is a good  idea. In fact, that\'s a lot of an
understatement. It\'s the only thing I can think of that could make me decide
not to buy the  game. 

    The Traveller universe has always been a very diverse place, and I think
that Neo-Traveller should emphasize that. If Star Viking requires anarchy,
leave Diaspora in chaos. Further  coreward, most of the factions should be
functioning fairly well as interstellar governments, though the aftereffects
of the  Rebellion (probably including a rather massive depression) and a cold
war among the factions would give this area a darker feel. Finally, the Domain
of Deneb could remain stable, peaceful, and  generally happy, as others have
suggested. Set things up so that  the tone of the universe varies. Then the
referee can select an area that will match that tone.

   Oh yes: I echo Farstar\'s sentiments. Do it ONCE, and do it RIGHT. No
eighteen pages of errata this time, please.

And hey: be careful out there.

I personally guarantee that the revision will not require an 18-page errata
sheet. I can also guarantee that it WILL require some sort of  errata
(nobody\'s perfect). 
     Brian and TML: I would appreciate it if somebody could arrange for GDW to
receive all rules-relevant discussions from Internet TML and anywhere else you
can think of. The more customer input we have, the closer we can come to
making a game acceptable to most (we are under no illusions that everyone will
love the revision, but we do want the largest number possible to be pleased
with it.
     Believe it or not, our discussions at GDW and the suggestions here  are
not that far apart...
     Mike Metlay (Via Bob): When did I ever call you by your last name?  We
were (and are, I hope) on a first name basis. Sorry I could never free up the
time to sit in on one of your Near Miss sessions  (its obvious that you are
more disturbed about it than you showed at the time). Seriously, at
conventions I am barely able to function, since I\'m usually working on a junk
food overload and about 12 hours overdrawn at the sleep bank. As you say
though, we have to give our first priority to earning a living. Sorry you
object to the Star Viking background, or what you\'ve heard of it so far. I\'d
appreciate it if you waited until you heard the whole proposal before making a
final judgement.

 If other RPG players are like me:

 (group 1) 40% buy the rules and never read them
 (group 2) 30% buy the rules, read them once, and put them aside
 (group 3) 20% buy the rules and find them interesting enough to buy
               a few adventure/supplements
 (group 4) 10% buy any set of rules (both revised and reformated),
               buy virtualy every professional adventure/supplement,
               or fanish article concerning the game

 Game producers have to sell the game to groups 2,3, and 4 to break even --
 they make a profit off of group 1.  I presume the profit largely goes toward
 the game system for support items, fanzines, etc.

 We are most fortunate in TRAVELLER
 us group 4 folks have not been
 forgotten -- please note the companies could make a profit just catering
 to groups 1, 2, and 3.

One thing that strikes me in the conversations about a Traveller revision...

It seems that most people don\'t want a "new" Traveller, they want the old one
fixed correctly.

Why not a second edition MegaTraveller or a "third" edition Traveller??

I always thought the "Mega" part was a bit silly.  Why not take the course to
revise (i.e. correct) the systems that have shown excessive weakness and
improve the ones that don\'t have major flaws?

Then the whole thing could be bundled as Traveller, Third Edition and enter a
major advertising blitz/campaign.

TSR seemed to do this with AD&D and it seems to have worked (from what I see
on the shelves in the stores.)  By renaming to Star Viking and casting out the
Imperium or what has been done before, a major segment of the Traveller gaming
population is alienated.  By improving on what is already in place, this
segment is kept in tact and with the advertising blitz, the new customers can
be picked up.

Also, if it is a certain segment of the younger crowd that is being targeted,
why not a new module with this in mind?  Keep the cost on par with TSR
adventure modules and use this as the targeting media. Use it in the
advertising campaign.

Of course, I am an engineer and not a businessman, but these things make sense
to me.  A wholesale revision and renaming does not.

I would be _very_ interested in hearing if these are good ideas and if they
are not, why not.

Thanks for listening.

                                     *-=Carl=-*

And, Loren, with regard to Metlay\'s bitching about the proposal, or what he
has heard of it, why not upload an abstract so none of us are dealing from the
dark?  I appreciate knowing any of what I can so that I can talk from a
position of knowledge rather than a position of conjecture (which I probably
do most of the time.)

    OK, OK, I\'m back after prolonged silence do to computer system troubles
(my hard drive went out on me).  Sheesh, I vanish, and they started trying to
change the Universe on me.

    Wish List:

1:  Either keep the stats/skills the same, or provide conversions so
players/refs can convert old and favoured characters to the new system.
Personnally, I don\'t see any particular need to change the stats and skills
(except adding more of the latter, maybe).

2:  The cries for increasing character generation flexibility have some merit,
although once you\'re into a career there are often limitations on what things
you will have a chance to learn.  The way you could choose which table you
rolled on, but not the exact skill, simulated this rather well, I feel.
However, perhaps 1 skill per term could be chosen by the player directly.

3:  Convert the current MT personal combat system to Striker, but with the
damage and damage system as they are (perhaps modified a little to conform to
T2K, but not too much.  Ranges in T2K v1 were WAY too low for most weapons).
The range bands have GOT to go!!!  (They result in the vast disparity between
the ACR, with a range of 500m, and the gauss rifle, with a range of 5km).

4:  Throw out the artificial-seeming restrictions like the 6G limit for
spacecraft, the Agility-6 limitation, no thrusters on craft smaller than 20
tons (although you can use them on vacc suits....), etc.  The power
requirements will keep the agility and manuever in line, anyway.

5:  Make Agility related to manuever again.  This separation makes no sense
(as I explained to Joe at length a few years ago).

6:  I\'d like to see (or maybe write, if necessary) a set of design rules like
Striker, that would allow the production of everything from bicycles to tanks
to starfreighters to dreadnoughts.  Weapons design (missiles, lasers, PAWs,
meson guns, mass drivers, cannon, rockets, etc) should also be included, up to
and including weapons for starships.  Example, if I want to mount 1500 Mw
lasers on my destroyer, I should be able to, and the system should handle it.
Small arms would be nice, but not really needed as long as enough types are
included, and possible variants noted (example, 6.75mm ACR\'s, instead of the
standard 7mm).
    These rules can wait a little while, but any items included in the initial
book MUST be compatible with them, and they must also be reasonable designs. A
problem with the designs in MT has always been that they were conversions
(except the Gazelles) from Book-2 designs and they did not convert well.
    These would probably be closely based on the current MT system, which is
actually very good, but it needs some additions (like armor facings), and some
corrections.

7:  The task system should be retained, in some form, anyway.  Another system
to look at for a well-done task system is Albedo.  That has a sliding
difficulty scale, with simple tasks at 5 and nearly impossible ones at 25, and
several standard levels in between (refs can also make up their own, as
required).  You add your roll of 2d6 to any applicable skill or stat, and if
you beat the number needed, you made it.
    2D6 is preferable in many ways to a 1D10 roll, but mostly because it
generates a bell-curve, rather than straight-line probabilities. On a 1D10, a
1 is just as likely as a 10, but on a 2D6 roll, a 5 is much more likely than a
12.

8:  I\'ll disagree (what\'s new here, right Dave?) with Dave Cheever on his
request for a 3-D combat system.  As long as we\'re not dealing with fleets, 2D
works just fine as the ships involved define the plane and you fight on it. If
a supplement comes out governing fleet ops, then 3D operation may become
important and can be inserted there, but we don\'t need it in the initial
release.

9:  Combat interfaces between personal/ground combat and starship combat.  If
I want to shoot at a starship with my grav tank, what happens?  This isn\'t
covered in MT, or in Traveller, and isn\'t well covered even in Striker.  The
capability to handle it _is_ in MT, though, with all those damage points that
we calculate and never use....
    I had hoped Star Viking would give us this, but maybe not.

    Yeah, I know, my designer/wargamer habits are showing again, but this is a
wish list, right?

   We are not renaming Traveller Star Viking. Star Viking will be a separate
game, using miniatures as playing pieces, set in the post-rebellion world
(about 80 years +). The new Traveller will be called Traveller (or some
variant thereof. We are considering several physical formats, etc.
     As for the RTC where we explain all this, evenings are best for us too.

First, as I wrote in my last message, the TDR project mentioned by myself
and hinted at by Mr. Borich was and is a slow-moving process; there exist
a couple of worthwhile modules, but hardly the basis for a new game. What
fellow TMLer Mike Surman has suggested, however, is that GDW avail itself
of the many experts in physics, military science, economics, etc., to 
check on and remove the most glaring errors in concept. I\'m not suggesting
that they cave in to niggling little details, or the revision will never
be published. But I don\'t think that violation of the Law of Conservation
of Energy by thruster plates is a niggling little detail-- anyone want 
plans for a real live Perpetual Motion Machine, perfectly usable in the
current rules? The Trade and Commerce system could also use such real-world
checks-- the tiny paragraph in Knightfall about materials availability was
the first note of common sense raised so far. I don\'t care much for using
rules systems myself, as I said before, but the fact that the exact nature
of the stuff you\'re carrying has NO effect on the rules is a bit odd.

Second, a question on Trav Classic: would someone at GDW please confirm or
deny the existence of the last page of the History section of Alien Module
8, DARRIANS? It really reads like it was cut off abruptly, and it stops
centuries short of the current timeline....

:
:Hi Richard,
:	Lee and I were bouncing around another idea (what\'s new, right! :-) )!
:It has to do with our character backgound but adds another dimension to the
:game background also. Here\'s the idea. I\'ve edited only a small fraction of
:what we were discussing. 
:			----
:Mike, here are my ideas about the Interstellar Professional Witness Society.
:
:The organiztion has its\' roots in the distant past.  It started during the Long
:Night, among the few interstellar traders still operating.  Because many of
:these groups spent most, if not all, their lives in space, they became 
:acccepted as neutral third parties on many worlds.  It would be bad for 
:business if these mediators were dishonest, so they developed a code amongst
:themselves governing their actions in such matters.  Over the years they
:developed a reputation for honesty and impartiality on many worlds.  One
:particular group of merchants adopted this practice of mediating disputes as
:its prime source of income.  This is the group that eventually became the IPWS.
:
:Humanity expanded through space, and the IPWS expanded with it.  There has
:never been any shortage of disputes and expansion only magnified this.  It is
:during this time that the society developed training and conditioning programs
:which insured its\' members honesty and integrity.  By the time the Third
:Imperium was established the society had increased its\' reputation to the
:point where they were officially recognized by all major governments. Even
:the Imperium put its\' stamp of approval on the IPWS.  
:
:After the Frontier Wars with the Zhodani, the IPWS was the mediator of choice
:in all negotiations.  Zhodani society has a very high degree of honesty due to
:the widespread use of psionics in it.  Even the Zhodani recognized the IPWS in
:an official sense.  Also during this time, psionic training programs were
:developed and instituted in the society.  This last fact is not for public
:consumption within the Imperium, although the Imperium itself knows about it,
:and still supports the IPWS.
:
:Throughout the Imperium, the Zhodani Consulate, and the Solomani Sphere, the
:gray robes of the IPWS are known and respected.  Members of the IPWS go through
:the most rigorous of mental and moral training known to humankind.  Their
:honesty and integrity makes even their unsupported word truth.  It is 
:accepted in courts of law without question.  If an IPWS member says he saw it,
:it\'s as good as if the event was videotaped.
:
:Note that the name is Interstellar, NOT Imperial.  When a witness puts on his
:robe, he has no loyalty to any government or other organization.  He has no
:axe to grind for anyone.  He will report only the truth of what he sees or
:hears.  No opinions are given.  If he sees an object from one side and it is
:red, he will report the object is red *on this side*.  He has not seen the
:other side and will not comment on it.
:
:Well Mike, that is a short explanation of the IPWS and its origins.  I added
:the last paragraph to illustrate how I imagine a society member is expected
:to act while "under the robe".  I hope it helps.
:						Lee	
:
:**
:The message I sent you (witness.txt), is only a history of the society.  I\'m
:not quite sure how it operates after the rebellion.  But seeing as it has its
:roots in the Long Night, I\'m pretty sure that with all these years of good
:reputation, the society should continue to flourish.  As to our position
:in the society, I feel that the society dosen\'t have ranks. It has members.
:Certainly, there is a support structure for training and for interacting with
:outside parties, but nobody really orders anybody around.  I would imagine
:that a society member would be a useful addition to any organization such as
:the SDS; as long as they remember that with the robes on we are not loyal to
:any particular thing except our own integrity.  
:
:**
:
:Nope, nothing to add.  I imagined the psionic training to be in the realm of
:improving memory, reinforcing of the other training to the point where it
:really is ingrained.  I hadn\'t thought of actual skills being taught
:\'(Telepathy: Shield & Lie Detection)\'.  But it makes sense; maybe the psionic
:training we recieved \'(other than what we were born with)\'  was through the 
:IPWS. I think that will fit in real well.

:Well? What do you think?

I like it.  It seems to kind of flow with another idea I once started
building, the Interstellar Rescue Service, whic sort of fell apart, 
because of the breakup.

I like the idea of having the different sections of the old Empire have 
different feels to them; Deneb relatively stable under Emperor Norris
(Excuse me, Archduke Norris), the core sectors relatively chaotic due to 
looting expeditions from the various Star Viking bases, and the various 
faction controlled areas in a state of hot and cold running wars.

As far as rules changes go, please keep the task system.  From what I\'ve heard
from people who play DC and T2K, MT\'s task system is superior.  I also like
the idea of having one basic book with additional volumes for ship
construction, robot construction, world building, etc.  However, if they are
going to come out in separate books, ALL OF THEM HAVE TO COME OUT AT ONCE!
I don\'t want to have to wait 6 months before I\'m able to run a campaign.

Having a computer virus that effects all the big computers is silly.  How is
it going to get all over the empire without anyone noticing?  It is also
fairly simple to restore the necessary programs from read only media.

As far as a RT conference goes, please announce it to the TML - I have a
friend with a GEnie account, and I\'m sure he\'ll let me borrow it to attend,
since he also plays MT (but isn\'t on the TML).

Nevertheless, what I\'d like to see in the new Traveller is:

1) The MT task resolution system
     I almost can\'t say this enough.  This was probably the single
     best overall RPG innovation since the Original Traveller came
     out in \'76.  It beats *everything* TSR has ever done.

     It works, and works well for GM\'s and players alike.
     "Simple", "Normal", "Difficult", "Formidable" are terms
     that make sense intuitively.  I suppose you could design
     this into a differnt randomness system, but it would 
     mean re-training a lot of people.

2) Solo Adventuring
    In \'77, when I started, I was the only RPGer around.  Trav\'s
    solo adventuring ability has always been limited, but is 
    vastly superior to anything else\'s (that I\'ve found).  Please
    try to keep or improve this, or make solo adventures.

3) Levels of Gaming Progession
    Got yer attention huh?  :=)  Actually, I mean, make it possible
    for a beginning gamer, or a once-in-a-blue-moon gamer to get a
    small, single set that covers almost all (s)he needs.  Then, for
    us die-hards, a possibility exists for getting "meaty" updates.
    For instance how \'bout a "Cosmic Explorer" set that covers Scouts,
    and all the things they do in detail, and alludes to expanded
    commerce rules in the "Merchant Prince" set, and expanded combat
    rules in the...

    Sort of like what GDW started out with, only never really got to
    do.  If I can invest in a complete game system that is expandable
    in a truly meaningful way, I\'m going to be more inclined to spend
    $$ on it.  Here\'s some thoughts for modules:

       Scouts 
	  includes World Builder\'s Handbook, ref material, 
	  and player material.  Maybe even a few minatures.
	  
       Merchants 
	   includes a reworked trade rules set.
	   
       Navy
       Army 
       Marines
	  (Look familiar?)
	  
       Ship Design
       Weapons Design
       Adventure Design
	   includes lots of ideas (lists?) of possibilities for
	   plots, twists, devices, NPC design, etc.

4)  Software
    I\'d love to have most of the routine bookkeeping tasks available
    on an "approved" disk.  Make a lot of stuff nicer.

GDW.SUPPORT [Loren W.]       at 21:29 EST
 
 And now a word from Dave Nilsen:

In response to the firestorm of controversy, we would like to present
 the following outline of the thrust of the Traveller revision.
     -- First things first:  THIS IS NOT A WHOLESALE TRASHING OF
 EVERYTHING WE\'VE EVER PUT OUT.  It is an evolutionary development
  that will be as true as possible to everything that has gone before.
     -- Why the Twilight System?  Because other extremely popular GDW
 games use the system, and this will allow more people to try other games
 in our line without having to learn an entirely new rules system.  Once
 you know the system, you\'ll be able to pick up any of our RPGs and
 get playing quickly.
     Also, and this is of real benefit to you players, it will allow
 us to put out more role-playing modules and variant settings along
 the lines of Cadillacs and Dinosaurs.  If we have to design a new
 system from scratch every time we want to create a new RPG setting,
 there\'s no way we could make the time to do very many.  However, if
 we can build on an established system that is already well-known
 among our players, it makes it possible for us to produce more fun stuff
 for you to play without having to mortgage the farm on long  development
times and costs.
     And, once you know the new system, playing Dark Con or Twilight
 with your friends, even if you don\'t do it more than once a year,
 will be as easy as falling off a bicycle.
     Certainly the New Traveller will make evolutionary modifications to
 the Twilight system, just as Dark Con did.  We will add things that
 will allow it to retain that unique Traveller flavor.
     -- Of course we will modify the way Traveller skills are quantified
 in order to make them work with the Twilight system, and of course we
 will provide conversion table so you can make your current
 character compatible with the new system.  What do you think we
 are, communists?  
     -- What "using the Twilight system" does not mean, is that we will
 be adopting that historical background (that was 2300, remember?),
 and adopting the M1A1 as the new Imperial MBT.  Get real.
     -- Vehicle designs will replicate as much as possible the general
 results of current vehicle design, as much as MT designs gave results
 demonstrably similar to earlier takes on Traveller.  However,
 the system will not require you to buy time on the MIT mainframe to
 generate a fleet of starships.
     -- Starship combat will be more fun and more detailed.
     -- One major thrust of the revision is to make the game accessible
 to first-time players, without requiring them to become disciples of
 someone who\'s been playing since 1977 in order to get the hang of
 it, which MT, unfortunately does.  
     -- Your subsector data will still be useful.  We are not leaving
 Imperial space.  We will be retaining varying levels of technology
 in different regions to allow current players to continue play in various
 socio-technological environments, according to their tastes.
     -- Aircraft carriers are not obsolete!  (I\'m sorry, that slipped in here
from the 
 Troubled Waters blurb that Loren was writing today.)
     -- We will be returning to many of the themes of pre-Rebellion
 Traveller, so it will be kind of like a ten-year reunion.  (Except
 if you drink, you should drink responsibly.)
     Please allow us to assure you that we have been reading your
 comments and concerns, and that these have been very reassuring to
 us, as the things you have been talking about have reconfirmed to
 us that our assessment of what we want to do with the revision is
 right on target with our audience.  Many of the things you\'ve
 discussed are things we are already planning, but it\'s nice to
 get the positive feedback so quickly.
     However, since we are still in the fairly early stages of
 nailing down specifics, this will be the last bean-spilling we\'ll
 be able to indulge in for a while.  We just need time to fully
 form our work.  But keep the comments coming, we do read them.

  This is Free Trader Beowulf . . . Mayday . . . .

     I\'ll look around and see if there has been a summary prepared.  Most of
the people asking for email address, I suspect, are hoping that you have
something Internet accessible, so that we can get to you from free work or

  Star Viking\'s miniatures _ground combat_?  Ok...Loren, not to second-guess
y\'all, but does GDW really think that it\'d sell?  It\'s been my experience that
SF miniatures rules have poor sales.  Aside from that (and my fervent hope it
was a new space combat system), I\'m actually interested in it.  Then again, I
grew up reading Piper...

  Someone up above mentioned the way TSR revised AD&D.  I think they hit the
nail on the head...what\'s needed is a 3rd Edition Traveller. The revision of
some areas (vehicle design and starship combat especially) and a generally
reeditiing and rewriting of the rules...but otherwise a compatible rules
system.  After a lot of reflection, I can\'t see _any_ good reason for
switiching to a T2k/DC system.

  To get into analogies, we\'ve seen Traveller grow like a tree...its started
out small, grown big and branched out.  There\'s definitely pruning that needs
to be done, but cutting the whole tree down to grow a new one...?

  I\'m not so concerned about background changes...h**l, most of the adventures
I run now are still pre-Rebellion.  That was the setting most players were
used to and I was comfortable with.  There are some interesting things about
the rebellion era that I do use.  An eighty year leap, though, seems a bit
much.  I like the idea of the former Imperial territories in anarchy with the
Domain a lone, shining light, however.

    Scott Kellog had a remark on a computer design system, built upon the info
in Robots, it\'s a good idea (I had something similar designed before Robots
came out, where the system was integrated).

    Concerning the Striker/MT talk, I too liked a lot of aspects of the
Striker system (It even gave me a use for spreadsheet programs, I used a small
screen size one to do the vehicle construction). One of the best things I like
about it was using cubic meters to measure volume, it was a lot simpler and
easier to identify with.

Loren,
    Just in case I\'ll mail you the stuff off by the end of this weekend. While
it takes awhile to go through it, it\'s not really quite that bad. I\'d say a
fair amount of the problems have to do with the Errata, Vehicle Construction,
maneuver/agility, fission plants, and other problems with physics.
    TDR (Traveller Done Right) is the TML\'s attempt at fixing the problems and
creating a version of Traveller they want.
    By the way who should I address them too (Rob Dean might want to know
too).
    There is a list of what\'s the subject matter in each letter that should be
helpful too.
    I could usually go through about 10 bundles at day, extracting material.
Spending about 2-3 hours. And I have about 211 bundles.

Rob,
    In case Loren hasn\'t answered already, yes they can accept IBM disks.

  By which I mean that the outcome of the rebellion is as far asI am aware not
known to us grunts out in the field and so we must soldier on,eating up game
time in chunks and rapidly catching up to the latest TAS or Deneb newsbriefs!
 Now don\'t get me wrong I am no slavish rules-addict! I can make it up as I go
along, BUT it would be nice to be able to run a campaign that lasts game years
and not outrun the official history.
  A good example of what I would like is 2300 where the course of the Kafer war
is available to the DM at the outset and a campaign need not forge off into the
unknown UNLESS the DM (and players) want it to.  
 Maybe I am running too much traveller? Is 1 session of 5 hours in a week more
than the norm? I get through at least one jump a session, often more if the PC\'s
are in a hurry.  The problem is the fact jumps eat up time and if you run \'nail

time as even in corridor not every gas giant holds adventures.

 source book? that way we get a decently produced set of rules (1 set to rule 
them all.... one set to bind them....) and the 3 background periods to choose
 from i) old \'classic\' trav ii) rebellion and iii) long night.  
One query.... if we get an 80 year leap in time line can someone tell me how
the rebellion ends...? please?

I\'ve seen this argument already, of course.  Is the amount of discussion on 
GEnie any indication of popularity?  There hasn\'t been a meaty message about 
Twilight:2000 (except for a request for errata, to which the response was \'If 
you\'ve bought the supplement, you don\'t need the errata\') in months, and there 
have been a grand total of 2 (_2_) messages about Cadillacs and Dinosaurs in 
the last six months.  I\'m glad my paycheck doesn\'t depend on that sort of 
popularity...

In addition, I am left with the strong impression from years of being around 
this hobby that it is the topic that sells things not the compatible game 
system.  I\'ve never met anyone who mentioned buying a Chaosium game on a topic 
that he didn\'t like just because it had a compatible game system.  In my local 
hobby shop, the two hottest sellers are Battletech/Mechwarrior and Shadowrun.  
FASA doesn\'t seem to be suffering too badly from having different game systems  
(and the only Chaosium they seem to be able to sell is Call of Cthulhu, which 
leads me to believe that there\'s not much crossover between players of CoC, 
Stormbringer and RuneQuest...)

Apologies, but did I just hear you say that I, a gamer, am going to benefit 
from you making substantial changes in my favorite rules so that you can spend 
more time turning out such \'popular\' products as C&D which I won\'t buy, rather 
than spending time on putting out products for my favorite game, which I will 
buy?   Besides, with all due respect, I think that I am not unusual in scarce-
ly having enough time already to play the games that I have, a situation only 
made worse by the lack of available labor-saving products for my favorite 
game.  You people don\'t really think I enjoyed designing 300 vehicles, do you?  
Or that I would have done it if I could have bought three decent books of them 
at $12.00 apiece?  You should be worried about supporting your exisiting 
games, not casting one book one shots on the market.  The reason that support-
ed games sell is that it is easier for a GM to run one than it is to make up 
everything from scratch.

Enough evolutionary changes and you might as well use a different game system 
as far as I am concerned.  Look at my post commenting on the T:2000 rules: it 
doesn\'t look like there is going to be much that carries over, and what there 
is will be lost in the mass of necessary information about space, different 
worlds, ships, vacc suits, trade and commerce and the like.

Oh joy.  Unfortunately, MT did not give results very similar to previous 
editions of Traveller.  The trouble is that I have a h*** of a lot more time 
invested in MT work now, which will probably be useless.  (If I seem negative, 
please remember that I\'m probably the only person stupid enough to do 300+ MT 
vehicle designs by hand--yes, I have no computer. (-:)

I hope so...I think that this is one of the most serious shortcomings of the
current rules, which is why I usually use a modifed Mayday system.

Yup.  \'Course, I am one of those \'77 type people.  I think the \'layered\'

Somehow this doesn\'t sound very reassuring, given that everyone has vehemently 
denied any desire to switch systems.  This tells you that you are right on

Are you sure that we can\'t interest you in a pool of very interested and 
experienced people to playtest/comment before it\'s too late to make changes?   
This sounds a lot like a polite dismissal..."We\'ll be back after we\'ve decided

While  I  like the idea of having a Traveller ground combat  system  based  on 
Command  Decision,  I have to second Mike\'s qualms.  Unless you folks  at  GDW 
have  a  manufacturer lined up for miniatures that match the  flavor  of  your 
game,  I can\'t see too many people buying this one.  The only source that  I\'m 
sure  of for small scale SF vehicles is the \'conventional forces\'  section  of 
the Ral Partha Battletech line.  Since we don\'t know anything about the  Space 
Viking  background (oops...Star Viking), I don\'t know if there is some  reason 
why  gravtanks  wouldn\'t  be  used, and the B\'tech  ground  vehicles  are  all 
tracked,  aren\'t they?  An analogy:  Imagine a _miniatures game_ about  combat 
with  Roman  legions,  in a hobby where the only figures  available  are  14th 
century  plate  armored  knights and English longbowmen.   Sure,  you  _could_ 
convert  them <??>, but not enough people are going to bother to  sell  enough 
copies  of the game to justify putting it out.  I\'d really rather see a  well-
done  board game on the topic...scale for a miniatures game is going to  be  a 
problem too, if you allow some of the sorts of tanks that easy to design under 
the  MegaTraveller rules (2000+ kph, weapons with 250km range,  multiple  high 
rate of fire antipersonnel lasers to keep the infantry suppressed--if there is 
any infantry.)  Did you ever see any of the Adjutant vehicle books for  Strik-
er?   Even using the Striker rules, I think I could back-convert some  MT  de-
signs  that would wipe out anything of theirs from _way_ off the table.   I\'ll 
take a 20MCr grav tank over 40 500kcr tracked tanks with CPR guns any day.

Jay, I hope you are speaking personally on this, and not as a representative 
of a game company.  I dislike being reminded that I am thought of primarily as 
a cash cow by companies.  When I find that a company is \'upgrading\' a product 
in a direction that I don\'t want to move in, particularly when it renders any 
large investment of previous material obsolete, then I _stop buying_.  After 
all, if AD&D1 was fun before, and AD&D2 is more expensive, I won\'t buy it (and 
didn\'t--I actually stopped adding AD&D  material with Unearthed Arcana.  TSR 
didn\'t collapse, of course...)

Which, for some unknown reason, nearly everyone who has expressed an opinion 
on this board generally likes.

Would I really want to spend the money on a game that didn\'t include enough to 
play with?  In my opinion, enough to play with means that I need some sort of 
world design and ship design system (See more below on the latter).  The lack 
of such basic (for SF) things would be interpreted as the start of an effort 
to milk me for money for endless supplements.  I consider the availability of 
supplements of the \'compendium\' sort to be worthwhile in so far as they are 
conveniences rather than necessities.

I haven\'t got a very clear answer for this one.  The only thing I can say for 
sure is that it is important, even if in some rational system it shouldn\'t be.  
I\'ve heard complaints about the lack of such a system in 2300 (yes, I know, 
it\'s in Star Cruiser...)  The way most Traveller campaigns I\'ve ever seen are 
structured, ships are very important, hence are worth including in the basic 
rules.  Would you say that MegaTraveller includes enough ships in the Imperhlmgkjiijlnoghjigdb`gc`}^~_`}a|`wV}\\^yXxX{[xZpRsZsZpYoXnYmXmXmXkYgUfShUgRePgQkUeTcRaS]OXQTMUQXT\\XWSSORNOLJGHGKJQRNO|ILyFIuDIsBGq@Eo>CnDNi?Ih>He;E^7>b;BkBFkBFwKNtHKwDEzGHLJOMMJKHI<\\O^SaVZQQHXRQK{GESQRUuBEk:?uDINUNUh7<q@EtGNrELlBLlBLeBLb?I`@K_?J[>FW:BS6<T7=\\@CdHK_?H\\<EU4;[:AfCI_<B`9>sLQwLQi>Cm>Be6:PRPRVY}JMWWddYWrGEoIHnHGQ10zyx\\\\]AA`DE_CD^?CfGKa@E^=Bb<Ee?HjAFh?Dj;?k<@tABzGHLMWXIJJKQRKLRial

Rob,

I really did want this topic to be a more positive one than your message 39
would seem to indicate. I would really appreciate you keep those kinds of
messages in topic 1 (since that seems to be a sort of Potpourri topic).

As I\'ve said before - I\'m not speaking for anybody but myself in this
category. I\'m a potential consumer who had very little contact with
Megatraveller aside from attempting to get through the rules a couple of
times. I may have a little more knowledge about things than some because of my
ties to DGP and because I attended GENCON this year and was at a very eye-
opening Traveller seminar with Marc Miller.

If what Marc had said there is true - There are already plans for miniatures
in the works for the new mini game. Remember the old Grenadier mini\'s??

I never thought that there weren\'t enough ships in 2300AD.

Continuing to remark on how much you don\'t want the T2K rules in the new
revision probably won\'t change the fact that it will be there. Remember, that
is one of the things that was remarked on as being "set in stone."

Regarding Twilight:2000, I\'ll shut up now.  I do remember the Grenadier
miniatures, although they came out at one of my financial low points, and I
heard the Trav seminar at Origins.  I hope GDW gets them back on the amrket,
though I must add that 25mm will be a lot better for doing the routine work of
a role-playing game than for playing large miniatures battles.  The main
problem from a gamer\'s point of view with 25mm is that tanks and other
vehicles will be too expensive.  I\'m basing this opinion on the prices of 20-
25mm lead or resin tanks for WWII and modern, which probably are low sales
volume items for their manufacturers, and thus fairly comparable.  The
historical miniatures gaming world is engaging in a lot of complaining about
how hard it is to find and interest new people right now, and the second
biggest complaint you hear being discussed is the high cost of initial
investment in miniatures.  (The first is the unnappealing format and
complicated nature of the rules--assuming that Star Viking is comparable to
Command Decision or Combined Arms, this will be less of an issue than it would
be if you wanted to become an ancients gamer using the much complained about
WRG Ancients rules, a discussion for another topic--though there is no
miniatures discussion here, is there?). Anyway, as much appreciated as the
Traveller 25s will be, mass combat using  micro-armor type equipment will be
easier to hook newcomers with. (IMHO... and our local miniatures cabal has
recently snagged two new people for the group by starting a microarmor project
using Command Decision due to the comparatively low start-up cost.)
