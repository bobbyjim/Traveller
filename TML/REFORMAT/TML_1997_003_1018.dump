FOr David Smart and other MT fans:

Separate armour facings can be roughly figured in MT by the following

each of the 6 facings is 1/9 the mass of a whole armour of the sides AV

with an AV equal to the highest mounted AV.

Elegant, not too far off, and fairly well ballanced.

I did the math with excell, and found out the relationship to surface area
and Hull Price/Wt.

I was one of the people dissing Mr. Bearden\'s task system when he
originally proposed it. I didn\'t like the use of 1/2 dice, felt it did not
make stats important enough, and was harder to calculate. However, after
actually trying it out in my campaign, I\'m now a believer. When I objected
to it I used examples with skills of 5 or 6, but as Kenneth points out most
characters\' skills are in the 1 to 3 range. Trying out his system with real
characters showed it to stand up admirably in a variety of situations with
both high and low target numbers, which only need to be calculated once and
written down. Well done, Mr. Bearden. Now would you mind taking a look at
the experience system?

Almost the same system I started out with a couple of yers ago.
On a natural 12 on 2D6 you roll 1D6 on 5+ add one to your total and reroll.
Continue until you fail the 5+ on 1D6.
On a natural 2 roll 1D6, on 2- subtract 1 and reroll until you fail the 5+
on 1D6.

Why I use this instead of add 1D6 and reroll if 6 is that I wanted
"continuous derivative" on the propability distribution or simply that the
odds of rolling 12+ instead of 11 is 3x harder and so should rolling 13+
instead of 12 be.

My tasklvls are:
Very easy 1+, Easy 4+, Average 7+, Hard 10+ and very hard 13+.
My skill system doesn\'t use skills rated in points instead I use:
Unskilled -4
Inexperienced -2
Normal =B10
Experienced +2
Expert +4
Master +6

My names for skill levels are chosen so I can use the actual skill level in
normal conversation. "Have you talked to Fred, he\'s an Experienced Pilot
but his Astrogation skills are quite Bad. The Normal level can be omitted
so if a character is a Pilot then he\'s by default a Normal Pilot. The
philosophy behind it is that the most common tasks shouldn\'t have die
modifiers at all and that characteristics/skills should be utterable to
people that doesn\'t know the system.

My task results are:
Very bad/total failure/total miss: Miss by 4 or more
Bad/failure/miss: Miss.
=46air: Succeed by 0-2
Good: Succeed by 3-5
Very good: Succeed by 6+

This means for instance:
"My #%#& Inexperienced Pilot easy landing attempt failed totally and
wrecked my ship."

Actually, I said no such thing, I simply said that T4 characters get more
skills than CT or MT characters. 

There is another obvious answer to skills being less powerful.  T4
characters could simply be more powerful and more versatile than CT or MT
characters. I think this is true and I applaud this change.

One suggestion (so far) for M0--other than the items like lack of 
subsector names here and in First Survey (groan) that others have found.

Each Mileu book ought to have a subtitle. So M0 would be Mileu Zero: The 
Founding of the Third Imperium. Then, inside somewhere should be a small 
introduction that shows all the intended Mileu\'s...I think this would 
give a potential buyer the sense of this is part of a much larger 
series--something that you\'ll get years of play from, as supplements keep 
coming and expanding the universe.

Aie, THE THREAD THAT WOULD NOT DIE!

*grin*

I share your mystification/horror at Lt. Duschenko\'s actions.  Perhaps
  Ross is the sort of player who hates to lose/be humiliated, and took
  it out on the Dame and her party after they caught him flat-footed?

Ross, may I suggest that you and Xyroli switch to decaf?  Or to TNE,
  where acts of senseless violence are encouraged by the Powers That
  Be?  (ObDig at TNE dungeon-crawl syndrome)


I hope that you\'re able to find a way to continue/restart your game.
  When you do, might I suggest that you ask the players what kind of
  campaign they want to play?  Given your description so far, it
  sounds like many of them are interested in shooting things, 
  including each other...

While characters with active, even lethal grudges toward each other
 can provide lots of roleplaying, it also places a lot of strain on
  the GM to keep them pointed in one direction and not at each other\'s
  throats.  Traveller, with its usual band of ex-military PCs with
  shady backgrounds thrown together by circumstance, can be 
  particularly bad this way (though not as much as, say, CYBERPUNK).

Good luck to you all.

	Very good idea!

	While I was in the army, we had a nice deck of vehicle cards
	used in guerilla actions training. The cards showed a photo
	of a vehicle, some technical data, and an overhead drawing
	which showed the areas where the personnel inside the vehicle
	could see and the areas where the weapons could fire.

	For example, "T72 MBT"-card showed that the tank has nice blind
	spots as long as the tank commander does not come out from
	the turret hatch, and "BMP-2 IFV"-card showed that it is hard
	to approach the vehicle without being seen, and the firing port
	weapons may cover all directions.

> Speed1Max
> Speed1Cruise
> Speed1Min

	I just hope that the vehicle speed would shown in some "normal"
	units, for example "km/h" or "m/s". It jut bugs me when some
	games present the vehicle speeds in "kilometers traveled in 4
	hour period", "combat system distance units per combat system
	turn" or in some other "furlongs per fortnight" units.

	Vehicle data could also include the maximum acceleration value.

        If the grid is thicker at the external grapple, this will
pressumably make the field extend more far away from the hull where the
external grapple is, covering the attached auxiliary craft. Yes. But, then,
it would produce exactly the same effect whether the auxiliary craft is
there or NOT (the only important thing is the volume inside the field), so
there will be few reasons for external grapples. An alternative would be
that, under the external grapple, the gird is not more thick, but more
*dense*. For example, several simple grips superimposed, so that you can
activate only the basic pattern for a jump without auxiliary craft, or the
more dense one (two or more superimposed basic grids) for a jump *with*
auxiliary craft.
        And so, nobody told the players who did not contract an astrogator
to activate de more dense pattern and they lost the launch... ;-)

This is a very good suggestion -- cheap, easy to do, and with a clear
benefit for the marketability of the game.

I have to admit, even being familiar with the Traveller universe, until I
signed onto the TML I thought "Milieu 0" was a standard techno-geek way of
referring to the first one (you know, start counting with 0, not 1).  I had
no idea it referred to the Imperial Year.  This seems like an easy
misconception for unfamiliar or potential players to make, and an easy one
to fix as described above.

        I suggest an alternative: Edu points acquired in college cannot be
directly added to UPP Edu. Each increase in Edu has to be bought at a
certain cost in Edu points, e.g. linearly increasing like this:

        From    To      Cost in points  Bell curve prob of the (to)
        4       5       1               - (4/36)
        5       6       1               - (5/36)
        6       7       1               - (6/36)
        7       8       1               5/36
        8       9       2               4/36
        9       10      3               3/36
        10      11      4               2/36
        11      12      5               1/36
        12      13      6               -
        13      14      7               -
        14      15      8               -
        And so on, unless we take 15 as a maximum.

        So, if a PC enters college with Edu 4, OK, he exits with Edu 8. But,
if a PC enters college with Edu 8, he gets Edu 9 + two Edu points, so if he
is a honors graduate he will get Edu 10. What would he do with the remnant
points? Keep track of them and add them to the Edu points get in Grad School
or others. And, when Character generation is finishes, if there are remnant
points, I see two alternatives:
        1) Roll 2- with a DM (T4 style) equal to the number of remnant
points to achieve the next Edu level anyway.
        2) Keep track of this Edu points, if the referee is using "adventure
tallies", MT-style.

        The effect, e.g. of College without Honors will be

        Edu when entering       Edu when no honors        Edu when honors
                                +Remnant Edu points     +Remnant Edu points
                4                       8 +0                    8 +1
                5                       8 +1                    9 +0
                6                       9 +0                    9 +1
                7                       9 +1                    9 +2
                8                       9 +2                   10 +0
                9                      10 +1                   10 +2
               10                      11 +0                   11 +1
               11                      11 +4                   12 +0
               12                      12 +4                   12 +5
               13                      13 +4                   13 +5

        So, College does not make much for your Edu (in principle) if you
are already very well Educated, which makes sense. But, still, if you enter
college with Edu 14 and graduate with honors, you have 5 Edu points. If you
attend now grad school and also graduate with honors, you have now exactly 8
Edu points and so you can reach Edu 15.

        Comments? Flames? I have been thinking in some point-based system
from the minute I saw the +4 Edu in College...

Way cool idea! This would be even better than an illustration of the

Any chance you could find and scan in an example or two of those cards?

To complete the answer; 

Sweetpea entertainment now has the rights to license any games based on
Traveller (with, I bet, Marc Miller\'s artistic approval) and I would be
suprised if they didn\'t already have something lined up in that regard.

I can see this turning into a cool tall-tale contest.  "Yeah?  Well,
jumpin\' from inside a hangar\'s a chancey thing, me lad, but let me tell ya
about the time me and me buckos jumped from the bottom of a mineshaft..."

And you *never* should have made it, of course.  I must\'ve been feeling
particularly generous right then.

Well, when the GM likes space combat, for some odd reason a whole lot of
space combat seems to happen.  Funny thing, isn\'t it? :)

Did they jump at one *diameter* (one planetary radius *above* the

The former. Surviving a jump from the surface would require an

Properly maintained, ships, aircraft, vehicles, etc can remain in service for 
at least 50 years. Since they spend most of their time in a non-corosive 
environment and have few moving parts, a starship should last at least 2 or 3 
times that. Frequent atmospheric re-entry and/or skimming will reduce this.

        A similar question applied in MT for Vargr characters, who could
also change careers, but there rank was not so important. For T4, I am
handling it this way (warning: possibly heretical house rules):

        Do M.O. separately for each career. Apply Rank bonuses counting the
number of promotions in the career. In your example:
        Roll 4 times on army tables (2 terms + 2 for O3), 2 times on marine 
tables (1 term +1 for 1 promotion, equivalent to O1) and 2 times on the law
enforcement table (1 term +1 for 1 promotion, equivalent to O1) for a total
of 8 rolls.
        This guy still obtains some more skills than an individual with 4
terms on the same career and rank O5 (5 promotions) (that would be 7 rolls),
but the guy with rank O5 gets a +1 on the Benefits Table.
        I think this is more "fair" that the method sketched in the T4 book.
There, it says "receive 2 more skills if the character has received rank O3
in the service", which is not the same that having received three
promotions... Following this strictly will lead to 10 rolls for the
character above.

The jump net surrounding a starship is simply not covered in the design,
combat or, for that matter, anywhere in \'canon\' rules.  The only place
where it is decently treated is in SOH, by DPG.  There are mentions of the
importance of Lanthium to Jump technology in some old CT modules, but I
really cannot think of anywhere else it is covered.

In my campaign, I handle external craft/drop tanks in one of the following
ways:

1)  Field amplifiers - increases the volume of the jump field w/out
extending the Lanthium grid.  (not very stable so it cannot be used in an
area intended for Life Support)

2)  Jump Nets - much like boat covers on \'wet\' Navy ships, the support
crew will cover the external craft/whatever with a flexible \'mesh\' that
has Lanthium field wires woven into it.  The mesh is tied into the main
jump net at prepared points to extend the field as required.

3) Recessed bays - while still external to the hull, the docking point is
actually recessed into the hull, allowing the primary field to form over
the craft, without additional material or handling.

4) Lanthium grid on the external craft which is automatically tied into
the primary field.

Hope this helps!

50 watts is not a usable weapon. 50 *kilowatts* is pretty wimpy for a laser.

        IIRC, it has already been done. I remember something called HPPE
about Hiperspace Psionic something Entities appearing in Challenge, and also
some references about receiving transmissions from a missing ship while in
Jumpspace, related to the Abyss Rift in the Spinward Marches. This was also
in Challenge. I think there was even a whole adventure where the PCs docked
with another ship while in Jumpspace (with a Zhodani passenger). I\'ll check
the references this weekend.
        Jumpspace is a very strange place. And maybe not all the ships that
disappear misjump. And, when a ship misjumps and takes 1000 years to
re-appear, it has to be somewhere in Jumpspace during all that time, right?

        He, he, he. My players learned the first, and then I as a referee
learned the second. But there are easier ways to put some fun on these
yawning Jumpspace weeks. Among the ones that I have used: Hijacking
attempts, computer failures, medical emergencies, problems with passengers,
and even a timebomb on the cargo hold.

Take a good look at the difference between what\'s *possible* now and
what we actually let computers *do* in aircraft and ships. The computer
isn\'t allowed to "make decisions". It supplies info, which the pilot
has to make decisions about. And it carries out orders.

So while the computer can report hazards (*if* you have told it to do
so), it isn\'t allowed to take action based on their existence. For
example, it can report that you are "too close" to another plane or the
ground, but it isn\'t allowed to force you farther away. The *human* has
the final control, both practically and legally.

This is why a few aircraft control systems (*mostly* "fly-by-wire", but
also some "conventional" ones) are rather controversial. They are
designed to not *let* the pilot do certain things. Trouble is,
"exceeding design parameters" may bend (or even break) parts of the
plane, but sometimes the alternative is crashing.

The computer won\'t be *allowed* to change course that way. Why? Because
the difference between a collision course, a fast intercept, and a
rendezvous is all in when you do the final braking. So expect the
computer to warn you (loudly!) but not be able to do anything other
than log the warning if you ignore it.

        Something else has occurred to me... the T4 system doesn\'t really
provide for dealing with low-down sneaky underhandedness, whereas
StoryTeller does.  I\'m seriously tempted, once we get underway again, to
simply resurrect my 10-siders and play Trav using StoryTeller.  Using
StoryTeller, I doubt that Isaac would have survived that first shot :), and
there would have been some chance for all involved to make Manipulation +
Subterfuge rolls to see through each other\'s evil plans.

        And Isaac might have not been blinded by the cheesecake, as it
were.  Actually, come to think about it, I\'m _amazed_ that you fell for
that one.  Forgotten London already, have we?


        I think that it\'d adapt pretty darn easy; double the damage dice
for all the weapons and you\'re laughing...

        Whadday think?  Storyteller for tasks & combat, and T4 for
everything else?

        Well, again, \'twasn\'t Ross\'s character that was committing the
senseless and counterproductive acts of mass murder on defenseless
shipwreck survivors; Ross\'s character was the one committing senseless acts
of genocide with a 95 mj laser against a bunch of harmless TL-0 cute mutant

        Maybe Xyroli was just phobic about rats.  Really phobic; didn\'t
even fire a warning shot.  Who knows :).

        Well, that\'s exactly what I\'m planning.  I have to take a couple of
weeks break from gaming (indeed, most of the things that make life
worthwhile) in order to get some work done, but in the interim I\'ve
instructed the group to confer and come up with some suggestions.  In the
meantime, I\'ll pick up M0 and start bashing some ideas around

        Well, actually, in this respect, the carnage was a case of what
goes around comes around; Xyroli, and Ross\'s character in the last campaign
I ran, was basically concieved of as a vehicle for revenge...  You see,
some time ago I was playing this character in this Vampire campaign he was
running, and I think I managed to scar him permanently.  He\'s been
whingeing about a certain train ride to Boston ever since :).

Just for the record, I checked the skill description and Astrogation
covers both N-space navigation and J-space computions.

I don\'t see why everyone is coming down on the astrogator, they do more
real work than 90% of the pilots would do.  Lets look at, realistically,
what a pilot does.

Take off from a class \'A\' or \'B\' starport: File flight plan (prepared by
astrogator), check ship status (maintained by engineers), ensure
passengers aboard and prepped for take-off (done by Stewards), communicate
with ground and air traffic control, lock flight plan into computer and
authorize liftoff (facilitated by ATC computer), establish orbit (IAW
course prepared by the astrogator), communicate with Orbital Traffic
Control and/or System Defense Command, break orbit and manuever to jump
point (IAW course prepared by the astrogator), ensure J-Drive is ready for
engagement (done by engineers), authorize jump (actually performed by nav
computer IAW jump plot prepared by astrogator).  So let\'s see, the pilot
signs off on the flight plan, _perhaps_ touches a control during liftoff,
talks to a bunch of people, and tells the computer that it\'s ok to jump.

I think for a standard merchant, I\'d rather have an astrogator with a
pilot\'s license, rather than a Pilot who can astrogate...

Now, I know there are people who are going to say "Wait!  We have that
Pilot-7 for emergencies, like combat"  Well, if you are going to pay the
big bucks for a pilot that good, then why are you whimpering over the
money required to give him the support staff needed to allow him to
concentrate on flying at that level?  

BTW - remember if you do have a pilot-7, he is probably going to get bored
with standard flying real quick - we have a PC Pilot in my campaign who
\'forgets\' to engage the flight computers on a regular basis, just to keep
his edge.  It certainly makes the trips to orbit a bit more challenging!

    'body' => 'Request for Proposal

    ImpBu has decided there is a need for a military auxiliary vessel that
has the capability to insert a small number of troops into varied
environments. Minimum requirements include the capability to carry at least
three squads, plus their support personnel into varied situations, including
hostile landings (however drop tubes as a fixed feature are not allowed as
not
all troops will be trained to use them). Provide Command and Control
capabilities for them. Be able to provide fire support to the troops. Be
capable of at least two month\'s sustained engagement and provide medical care
for the troops. Capable of providing some sort of mechanized transport for
the troops.
    Additional points will be given for flexibility of mission design.
Ability to provide close support for the vessel and the troops. Designs
that qualify for these additional points will be granted a 10%-20% discount
when compared against other submitted vessels.
    As usual a low maintenance cost is desired.


(The original Broadsword Mercenary cruiser was created and subsidized by the
Imperial bureaucracy to provide additional protection and order by mercenary
troops in instances where regular troops aren\'t available. It is also used as
an auxiliary military vessel in the Imperial Navy.
     It was created somewhere after year 988 (modular cutters weren\'t
in production till 988).
     It could carry two modular cutters and 4 modules, plus one air/raft.
It had the capability to carry 4 fighters (6-ton), an ATV, a weapons pod, a
passenger module, fuel skimming module, an assualt boat module, a pressurized
shelter and a cargo module.
     It had a sickbay.
     There were many varied designs, some armed, some not. Some with more
armor.

     Some suggestions that come to mind for the new version include CBM
missiles if the ship is equipped with missile turrets. Anti-personnel/
Anti-vehicle weapons on auxiliary vessels if used to ferry troops or
provide support to troops. If main vessel is to be landed, it should
probably also have similar weapons.
     Melieu Zero vessels are most probably corporate (through various
parties) or military owned. I wouldn\'t expect too many unaffiliated mercenary
companies around, yet.

True. But on some worlds, the troops have a relatively low value. Or they
could be BIG people (as opposed to humans).

It\'s not that one is better than the other.  It\'s that there
is not reason to use both...

A system where you roll against a constant number
(like skill) with a constant number of dice is fine with
variable modifiers if fine.  Rolling variable dice without
modifiers is easy enough too.  But roll variable dice _and_
using modifiers is two different things handling the same
thing (task difficulty) and so is more complicated than
it neeeds to be.

BTW, Sweetpea is going with a live action show for Traveller, which brings me to 2 points
1. Good, I would like to see Traveller as a show
2. Bad, they never even got back to me re: my idea of a Traveller Cartoon (I work for an 
animation studio). I don\'t mind being snubbed, but I do mind being left hanging

I\'ve received several questions recently which I was unable to answer 
immediately.  I spoke with Tim Brown today, and he provided some answers:

Q.  When is Emperor\'s Arsenal going to be released?

A.  Emperor\'s Arsenal has been written and edited, and is now in the 
typsetting process.  Tim expects to have it off to the printer next week, 
and then begin shipping them by the end of the following week (the first 
week of March).  Let\'s hope all goes well!


Q.  When is the Referee Screen going to be released?

A.  It will go to the printer at the same time as Emperor\'s Arsenal, and 
Tim expects it to ship at the same time (again, the first week of March).


Q.  When, and in what product, will the Vargr be covered?

A.  Although this year\'s schedule has yet to be finalized, the current 
plan is to produce a series of hardback books, each with two major alien 
races detailed within.  The first would be Aslan and Vargr, and Tim hopes 
to release it sometime in August.  Subsequent volumes would follow.


Q.  When will the forms (subsector map, subsector data, etc.) be 
available?  What product will they be in?

A.  Tim hopes to receive permission to put them on the web site.  Marc 
plans to also put all the forms in the Deluxe T4 book.


Q.  Will there be four-color sector maps available, like the old Spinward 
Marches map?

A.  Currently, there are no plans for four-color, poster-sized maps.

Well, I\'ll try and give you as many sources as I can remember and dredge 
up in my collection... Something I\'ve been thinking about for some time 
is compiling an "encyclopaedia" of Traveller aliens, listing a brief 
description of each; homeworld, if known; and references in Traveller 
materials.

Anyone with Traveller Alien info and biographies are welcome to email me, 
for possible inclusion on a website...

Under my system, a target number of 17 has a 48.71% chance.  Hmm, 
50-50, I\'d say that it is realistic.

OTOH, a target number of 9 only has a 1.62% chance--that is 
definitely not realistic.

How can you say he\'s a clutz?  He\'s got a Dex of 6.  When 7 is normal 
human Dexterity, a 6 is by no means clutzy.

And, although I think that natural ability should count for a lot in 
the target number, it is not more important than a person\'s skill.

I may have a natural ability to throw darts, but learning technique 
(how to hold the dart, how to control and stop a bounce, where to 
place the dart, not to mention strategy) is more important.

Natural, raw talent can only get you so far.

I don\'t roll up characters that way.  I give my players one shot, and 
one shot only.

I say, "Strength", and the player rolls 2 D6.  Whatever the outcome 
is his starting STR.  Then I say, "Dex", and again, whatever is 
rolled is his starting STR.

If he rolls really lousy, then he\'s going to have to give up a skill 
and try for an attribute on the Physical table.

Exactly.  The attributes are contributing to much to the target 
number.  This is why, under my system, that I double the skill level 
and halve the stat to get the target number.  It puts both components 
of the target number on more level ground.

Personally, I don\'t think that anything is wrong with the MT system.  
It is a good system.

But, you have to continue to convert T4 stuff to MT stuff.  Also, 
thinking of the second modifier all the time lead to some debate in 
my games.  You know--"Should I use my EDU or INT on this throw as a 
modifer with that particular skill?"

T4 makes all this easy.  Another thing--T4 gives you full benefit 
from your ability.  In MT, you could only get 1 or 2 points, in most 
cases, added to your throw.  There isn\'t much difference, task system 
wise, in haveing a 5 DEX or a 9 DEX, eventhough that is quite a 
spread.  In T4, as written, you get the full 4 points, and in my 
system, the difference is 2 points.

I know that this is a simple comparasion, because one system only 
uses two dice AND gives you a target number to beat whereas in T4 
your target number is composed entirely by your ablity and skill 
level.

I think T4 is a sleeker system that makes more sense, but hey, if you 
like MT and don\'t mind the conversion things that you have to do, 
then more power to you.  I certainly don\'t think that MT is broken.

Thanks, Richard.  I do believe in my fix, and I\'m glad it is working 
for you.  

The xp system is on my list for a fix.  I just need to sit down and 
do it.

Thanks, again.

Kenneth.

PS  I write the target numbers on my character sheets too, but I also 
re-calculate if the character is wounded.  I don\'t find it a problem 
to double something and add it to half of something during the game.  
You might try it that way--the T4 system is designed to lower the 
target number, and thus your character\'s ability to succeed at tasks, 
when he is wounded.

This is the case in T4 too.  You get damaged, your stats go down, and 
down goes your target number.

Granted, but you are missing the point.  I just used "to hit" as an 
example.  My point was, no matter what you are doing, you get more 
benefit by your attributes in T4 because each and every point (or 
every other point) increases your target number.  In MT, in order to 
get a benefit, your attributes must go up by 5--that only leaves 1, 2 
or 3 points of benefit.

Hmm.  3:1 in favor of stats?  I can\'t agree with that.  Natural 
ability is important, but experience and trainging are more important 
to anything you do.

Why else would Olympic skaters practice all the time?  They\'ve got 
the natural ability, but they need to increase their skill level.

Put a skater with great natural ability against a skater who has 
trained all her life, but only has so-so natural ability, and my 
money will always be on the one who is trained.

I\'d like IG to take a look at this fix.  It simple enough and close 
to the original rules enough to be put into one of the supplements as

Well, I can\'t remember what exactly was said in the post I was 
replying to, but I think that it was  said that the T4 college 
system was more powerful than the college system they had in CT.

Or, maybe it was that it was said that college is a real benefit in 
T4, thus making the argument that the T4 characters were much more 
powerful than any of the CT characters generated in the 1 year 
method.

My response to both of those, whichever it was, is that you should 
use the T4 college system as a pre-generation option before moving 
into one of the CT systems.  Just because you use the T4 college 
system doesn\'t mean that you HAVE to use T4 character generation.
Mix and match--I do.

Another thing occurrs to me.  This is something that I\'m already 
doing, but I haven\'t mentioned before.

If you want to use your old CT generation stuff (I mean the 4 year 
method systems in Book 1, or in Citizens of the Imperium, or even the 
4 year careers in MT) then just simply give the characters a skill 
once per year than onece per term.

Waaalaaa, problem solved.

Here\'s a quickie that I\'d like to see,  and I\'m sure 
the whole TML would print and keep the answer if you can relay it.  

My request has to do with armor values.

My campaign is set in the 1100\'s, and I\'m trying to use the armor of 
that time--Combat Armor, high tech B-Dress, Cloth, etc.

What would be the Armor values of the CT/MT/TNE  armors in T4?

At first, I compared TNE and MT AVs to the AVs in T4.  MT was way 
too high (TL14 B Dress AV 18) and TNE was a little low (TL14 B Dress 
AV 8), but I\'ve been using the TNE AVs since they were closer (Greg 
stated in CSC that TL14 B Dress would be AV10--I\'m using this as a 
comparison).  

The errata for the main book states that Mesh armor would have a 
flexible armor rating of 2--which is exactly what MT gives it.  But, 
as I said, TNE seems to be closer, yet TL 14 Combat Armor only has an 
AV 4.  That seems way too low, especially since TL9 Flex from the CSC 
has the same AV 4.

My request is this--could you:

	1) list all of the armors in the CT/MT/TNE books (sounds like a lot, 
	but they are mostly the same armors listed in each system) with the 
	appropriate T4 AV

	-OR-

	2) provide me with a fix to convert to T4 values--say based on one 
	of the other systems (like always take 8 points away from MT armor, 
	or divide it by 2, or whatever).

I, and I\'m sure many others, would greatly appreciate this.

Thanks,

Kenneth.

Both of these options are then valid. And neither are, as I can see
them, superior to the other as it does not have any effect of the jump

    'body' => 'Thanks for posting the synopses from your adventure "A long day\'s
journey...", Roderick. You had some good ideas and dramatic encounters; if
you don\'t mind I may swipe a few ideas for my campaign. The ending was
rather anticlimactic, but "... and then everybody dies" is somewhat a
Traveller tradition ;-).

I may have handled some things differently, but monday-morning
quarterbacking is seldom productive. There is one point which I do want to
comment on, however. This is an issue I have argued with another GM about,
and I saw an example of it in your adventure. The following small quote
illustrates what I mean:

>... files, reinstall the anti-hijack program and activate it, setting it on
>lethal; it handily slaughtered all non-crew-members on board ...

I have seen similar scenarios in other Traveller campaigns. My question has
always been... HOW? The anti-hijack program is a piece of computer
software, how exactly is it supposed to kill people? Switching off life
support? This will take a while to have effect, is ineffective against
vac-suited characters, and will likely have rather severe collateral
damage. Crank the ship gravity past 30Gs? Ineffective against grav-belted
hijackers and again has bad secondary effects; assuming ship gravity is
even variable to that extent. Radiation or gravitic effects from ship
engines? Once again; hard to target, ineffective against prepared
attackers, and high probability of wasting innocent bystanders. Denaturing
their hemoglobin by subspace modulation of their RNA? This is Traveller,
not Star Trek. Poison gas? Antipersonnel mines? Robotic pillboxes or laser
beams sweeping the corridors? Look, the anti-hijack program is a bunch of
bits in a computer; it has no equipment or hardware outside that what is
already installed in the ship. I don\'t recall seeing equipment costs for
laser weapons or poison delivery systems in every inhabitable area of a
ship in the design sequences.

Look at how the anti-hijack program is defined in the rules. The rules say
the anti-hijack program "helps prevent hijacking". Not "counterattacks once
a hijacking attempt has started". It is a fairly small, cheap, and simple
program. A program which can analyse unique conflict situations, identify
and attack dozens of targets simultaneously under non-programmed mission
objectives would be a couple dozen breakthroughs in AI. It would be no more
difficult to have such a program also pilot starships, survey planets, and
conduct space combat; making players, other programs, and probably the
entire game unnecessary. A program with those capabilities would at least
be considerably larger and more expensive than the anti-hijack program in
the rules.

Even if such a program was technically possible, I don\'t think it would be
desirable. Filling the ship with lethal weaponry will provide a free
arsenal for hijackers. Attackers would simply remove this weaponry to use
against the crew or hack into it to take over the ship by remote control;
since control conduits for it would by necessity be all over the ship,
anyone anywhere would have access to it. If it\'s connected to the
communications functions this could be done from another ship. You might as
well install "press button to kill crew" boxes all over the ship (hmm,
maybe Virus isn\'t so implausible after all)! It is also extremely unlikely
that societies which restrict use of lethal weapons by individuals even for
self-defense would allow automated weaponry capable of mass slaughter to
operate without human intervention in public places merely to deter theft.

If this isn\'t bad enough, I feel rulings like \'the anti-hijack program
kills hijackers\' harm playability. It becomes a shortcut to playing the
game through die-rolling. Why bother to actually design safeguards against
hijacking, plan an attack, or even play one out if we can just roll a task
against the anti-hijack program? Why? Because designing, planning, and
playing is the whole point of the game. Look at the description of the
\'combat\' with the anti-hijack program: "setting it on lethal; it handily
slaughtered all non-crew-members". I don\'t mean to pick on Roderick, I\'ve
seen the same thing in other campaigns. Tell me, what was the anti-hijack
program\'s initiative roll? Its action status? How many turns did the combat
last? There\'s no way to tell, the entire action is so vague it becomes
trivial and undramatic. Imagine if starship combat was handled this way;
starships had a single Combat program and the entire battle is decided by
one task roll. This would make starship combat (one of the most dramatic
things in Traveller, IMHO) boring and insignificant, and it does the same
thing to hijackings. I haven\'t had a hijacking in my campaign yet, but when
I do it will be a real fight for control between the players and the
hijackers/crew, with the anti-hijack program providing a useful but not
dominant role; the character\'s actions will be the deciding factor.

After all this you may suppose I have pretty specific ideas about what the
anti-hijack program does. Well, I don\'t. I do have a few ideas; it will
have database, communications, and encryption features. It will not be able
to physically harm anyone and hacking it will not let you take over the
ship. I welcome other traveller\'s ideas and, if anyone wants them, I will
post my ideas.

	Well, here\'s some ideas I\'ve put into my ships at different times:

   Security Systems (provided by Paranoid Protections, Inc.)


	* RF Detector/Direction Finder--any unusual / unauthorized radio signals
in / near protected area triggers alarm
	* Security Remote--override alarms, card locks, etc. at a distance
	* "Cheesecutter"--monomolecular wire mesh
	* Powered hatches can be overridden from bridge (or other authorized
terminal)
	* Sticky or fast-hardening foam
	* Inertial compensation can be turned off in sections
	* Claymore-type mines
	* Blinding flares
	* Corridors or compartments can be evacuated to space or flooded with
cryogenic fuel
	* Gas--tranquilizer, regurgitants, tear, nerve, blister, laughing,
psychotropic, etc. Or just flood compartment with 100% nitrogen =97 no=
 oxygen
	* Retinal scanners--scanning laser can be overridden, fired at higher
power (enough to blind temporarily or permanently)
	* Psionic locks, ID scanners, etc.
	* ID chip imbedded in bone for authorized crew members
	* bar code tattooed on body, etc. (in invisible UV ink) for authorized
crew members
	* Lasers or projectile weapons (tranq or HE) covering important doors, etc.
	* "Laser Gates" concealed in corridors--grid of low power beams until
interrupted, fires pulse, checks again
	* Video, sound, IR, ultrasonic, psionic detectors, neural activity
sensors, biosniffers
	* Electrify floor panels/ controls/ doors/ etc.
	* Infra/ultrasonic projectors
	* Cargo modules rigged to be jettisoned and destroyed, to produce sensor
cloud and/or convince pursuers ship has been destroyed
	* Weapons sensors concealed in critical hatches
	* Heat/Weight/Video (IR/V/UV)/Audio/Neural Activity sensors in critical
sections and approaches
	* Artificial Gravity can be varied by section (random oscillations ("Grav
Pong"), reversed, extremely high, grav shelf, etc.)

	Always a threat with ANYTHING. Even if there\'s no "anti-hijack" program
running, for example, there\'s a chance (however small) somebody could hack
the life support system. And since your crew doesn\'t spend all their time
in Vacc Suits, that\'s a very significant threat.

	Agreed. Which is why my referee made me actually describe precautions
against hijacking (unfortunately, he wouldn\'t let me have everything on the
list!). And then when the time came to use them, we roleplayed that.

	Hmmm. Whether the "anti-hijack" program itself takes action or not, there
are things that can be done under computer control on ANY ship. For
example, one way of dealing with a completely out-of-control fire is
evacuate the compartment. OK, so now I hack in and do it without needing a
fire. Likewise, overriding locks or hatch safety interlocks (chop-crewey).

	Agreed, the computer won\'t take these actions on its own. Just like it
(theoretically) can\'t fire the weapons on its own. But the capability is
there, and it\'s only limited by the players\' ingenuity and the referee\'s
flexibility.

...and at last we have a connection to Traveller -- Athena

Much of the charcoal-sketch are in the CT Zhodani aliens
module used other art or photos as a model, then was altered
to "Zhodanify" it. One was taken from Ralph McQarrie\'s pre-
production work for The Empire Strikes Back. 

Another peice was taken from a BG publicity photo of 
Maren Jensen in her Athena togs. The sketch copies the
photo exactly, from boot buckles to collar insignia --
except for the Zhodani helmet she\'s wearing.

So don\'t sell Starbuck short -- he\'s just better at 
spotting those mindrippers than you are. Sleep tight!

Considering that in TNE many of the ships are over 100 years old, this
seems reasonable.

I\'m sure that M0 analogs of HMS _Victory_ or USS _Constitution_ exist,

I looked it up last night and it was there. It took it a long while to
download the cover, but it\'s a big picture, so that wasn\'t unexpected. It

I got it this week. It\'s got some very good fiction in it this week, plus a
little more of Harold\'s TNE Earth setting, including the errata he posted on
the TML. He mentioned it the other day, if I recall. Good stuff. Anyone that
doesn\'t have a subscription should definitely pick it up.

        Well, my take is a little "Disco Ball From Hell", packing agauss
weapon and gas dispensers, drops out of the ceiling.  Sensors identify crew
members vs. non-crewmembers, scan Imperial ID\'s, determine level of hostile
activity (voice levels, body temperature, weapons holstered, aimed, or
firing, etc), run it through the civil liability avoidance algorithms, and
then decide whether to tell everyone to behave, gas everybody, or start
shooting non-crewmembers...

        Well, you see, this is a Famille Spofulam Defense Subsystems
antihijack system, you see...  The Legal Department had to convince
Marketing to convince Design to use gauss instead of napalm and frag
grenades :).

        And as far as technical feasibility, well, according to SOM, they
can identify crewmembers; at TL-12, body heat and voice analysis shouldn\'t
be a problem, let alone detecting weapons being present or being fired, or
querying Imperial IDs...

        Well, if you recall, back in the first episode, I had hijackers do
precisely this; of course, they were working for the same company and still
had to call Covert Ops to call Motor Pool and get the owner\'s passcodes,
but yeah, this is feasible, although not easy and I imagine that there
would be some pretty heavy security around it...

        Ah, but this is actually on board a private, high-security vessel;
on the shuttle up to the Sylean high port I would agree 100%, but given the
Imperium\'s generally lax attitude towards PCs toting weapons of mass
destruction about I see no problem with a corporate courier (or a private
yacht) having a nastier than usual system...

        Well, in this case, a single, rather psychopathic individual up on
the bridge pinned down everyone else using the artificial gravity and then
(with a very high int and 3 in Computer) bypassed the anti-civil liability
algorithms...  Had he not pulled the dodge with the gravity, I would have
allowed return fire and so forth...

        As Ross said to me earlier, it never pays to have PCs that are
wierder than the monsters.  In this case, it seems, 6\' mutant intelligent
killer lab rats from hell didn\'t quite make the grade :).

(Please forgive my humble ability to speak/write galanglic, but I come from  
the outer rims of the galaxis ... <g>)

I own these old black books for years now, but I never actually played (or  
mastered) a campaign (although I\'m not a inexperienced roleplaying gamer).
I even read this mailing list (and xboat which doesn\'t seems to exist today)  
from 1994 to early 1996.

But now it is the first time I can write to this list and it\'s also the  
first time I\'m actually going to play traveller - the classic one. And there  
are some questions of course, some more general, some more detailed.

1. Because of some inconsistencies in the three black books (that\'s the main  
reason for my questions) I wonder if it wouldn\'t be better to buy a newer  
edition (MT oder TNE or even T4). What is the general opinion to that?

2. As far as I know there are classic fans out there, still playing CT  
because ... what? Do you people have added special rules from MT, TNE, TN4  
to CT like type of ship sensors, gaining experience and so on?


3. In CT exist two rules for combat, spaceship combat and for spaceship  
building (book one and book two). I prefer the newer ones, but it\'s partly  
depending from the situation which one you has to use, isn\'t it? (the newer  
space combat rule applies only when many ships are involved because the  
individual abilities like piloting, gunnery, tactic are unimportant in these  
rules). But what about these two combat rules? Practical all rules depends  
on a kind of hit points meaning the sum of strength, agility and endurance  
(robot rules from the 3rd book, animal rules from the 1st book), but the  
combat rules from the 2nd book use a 2d6 table to determine the result of a  
hit (no effect to death). I do like this one, but how do you switch from one  
rule to the other?

That\'s not all, but I want to know first if my mail will be send correctly -  
and I\'ll collect my questions now.

I\'m using T4--but my campaign is set in the CT 1100\'s era.  And, I 
still use a lot of CT items--rules and background.  

T4 is very compatible with CT.  In fact, T4 is just a modernization 
of CT, the same way MT was a modernization of the original game.  
TNE, of course, was almost an entirely new system.

I find it easier to use T4 as my core rules set, but I don\'t hesitate 
to use CT or MT when I have a particular topic not yet covered in T4 
rules.  

Example--there is no Shotgun group hits rule in the T4 basic rules, 
so I\'m using the one from CT.  

Keep in mind that T4 is in its infancy.  The main book is meant to be 
a basic book.  Other supplements will add more detail to the rules 
system as the game grows just like Book 4 (and others) did to the 
first three books of CT.

As for my Shotgun rule, Greg Porter told me that a Shotgun rule would 
be covered in the Emperor\'s Arsenal due out in a month or so.

So, there it is.  The game grows.

My suggestion?  Change the title of your post to:

That should be 3 attribute=1skilllevel; where you chose 2=1, TNE and T4
official use 1=1, and MT uses 5att=1sk. We\'re in agreement that training is
more valuable than raw talent; just in disagreement about HOW MUCH moreso.

	The activities which characters in Traveller adventures undertake are called
tasks. The use of tasks allows specific activities to be resolved
consistently based on defined levels of difficulty and through the use of
appropriate skills, characteristics, and other modifiers. Players can analyze
tasks and decide on the appropriate character to undertake each, based on who
is best suited to the task.

 ROLLING TASKS
	When a task becomes necessary, the referee tells the group the task, its
required skill and characteristic, and the difficulty level. The players in
the group discuss among themselves who will attempt the task. The player
running the character selected identifies the skill and characteristic levels
and determines the target number.  He or she then personally rolls the dice
and compares it with the target number. Low rolls are best. If the die roll
result is equal to or less than the target number, the task is successful.
	For example, Eneri Dinsha (ABC789 Mechanic-3) faces the following task:

	To repair a groundcar engine (2 hours).
	(Edu + Mechanic) + Tools (required) < Difficult (3D)

	The target number for the task is (8 + 3 = ) 11, which Eneri must roll or
less on 3D. He rolls 6, which means he succeeds in accomplishing the task.

EXPRESSING TASKS
	Tasks can be expressed in a variety of ways, depending on the important
elements of the specific situation. The basic expression consists of a task
phrase, a task statement, and any task comments. A typical task should be
stated as with these three elements on three succeeding lines.
Task Phrase:
	To accomplish an important activity (time).

Task Statement:
	(characteristic + skill) +/- modifiers < difficulty (nD)

Task Comments:
	appropriate comments about the task.

	The Task Phrase: The Task Phrase states the specific purpose of the task. It
is stated as an infinitive verb phrase (i.e. "To" followed by a verb and any
modifying words). It effectively states what the character wants to do.
	If a task phrase requires more than one line, it is probably too complex and
should be broken into two or more separate tasks.
	The Task Phrase may contain (in parentheses) the time the task generally
takes to accomplish. This information is optional, and may often be ignored.
	The Task Statement: The Task Statement shows the specific information which
is required to resolve the task. Task resolution is based on a skill and its
associated characteristic, applicable modifiers, and a difficulty level.
The sum of the characteristic and skill and all applicable modifiers to the
left of the < is the target number. The player must roll equal to or less
than the target number to succeed at the task.
	The Task Comments: The Task Comments include any supplementary information
about the task. It states if the task is Cooperative, Uncertain, or Opposed.
It includes any modifiers which did not fit in the Task Statement. It
includes any additional information which may help in understanding the
activity and its resolution.
	Task Difficulties: The Task Difficulty Table shows the levels of difficulty
possible and the associated required die rolls. 

DEFAULT SKILLS
	Sometimes characters need to accomplish tasks for which they do not have the
required skill. Any character may attempt a task which specifies a Default
Skill, even if the character himself does not have that skill.
	If using a Default Skill, the skill level used is 0 (zero) and the
associated characteristic is halved (round fractions up).
	For example, Eneri Dinsha (ABC789 Mechanic-3), while road testing the
groundcar he has repaired, hits a patch of slippery road. 

	To avoid an accident
	(Dex + Ground Craft) < Average (3D)

	Eneri has no specific skill in Ground Craft, but it is a Default Skill. He
can attempt the task with Dex B halved to 6 + 0). He must roll 6 or less on
2D.
	On the other hand, Eneri finds a bomb planted in the ground car. Demolitions
is not a Default Skill; Eneri cannot even attempt to defuse it.

SPECIAL TYPES OF TASKS
	Some tasks reflect special situations which require non-standard methods of
resolution. These include Cooperative, Opposed, and Uncertain tasks, and
Actions.
	Cooperative Tasks. More than one character may actively cooperate in
performing a single Cooperative task. Each individual cooperating contributes
his (or her) skill level, which one character contributes his (or her)
characteristic. 
	The Task Comment will say Cooperative (N Skill) indicating how many
characters may participate (N equals the numbers of characters) and that the
skill from each will be counted. A Task Comment may instead say Cooperative
(N Characteristic) indicating how many characters may participate (N equals
the numbers of characters) and that the characteristic from each will be
counted. If the task is successful, all participants succeed; if it fails,
all participants fail.

	To camouflage a vehicle from searching police.
	(Int + Camouflage) < Difficult (3D)
	Cooperative (3 Camouflage).

	Up to three participants may add their skill levels together in the
resolution of this task. The character with the highest Int would contribute
that characteristic.

	To lift a large log off a vehicle
	(Str) < Difficult (3D)
	Cooperative (5 Str)

	This task requires strength alone (no skill). Up to 5 characters can
participate.
	Opposed Tasks. Characters in direct opposition may jointly participate in an
Opposed task, with the result determining who succeeds (and who fails). Each
participant rolls to resolve the task, with the highest result succeeding. 
	The Task Comment will say Opposed (N) indicating how many characters may
participate (N equals the numbers of characters). The highest result is
successful, provided that result is a success result; all other participants
fail (regardless of the quality of their results).

	To win a brawl.
	(Str + Brawling) < Difficult (3D)
	Opposed (4)

	Uncertain Tasks. Characters undertaking tasks for which the results are not
immediately clear may participate in an Uncertain task. The referee rolls
some of the dice secretly and determines whether the task is successful. The
result is only revealed when required by events. 
	The Task Comment will say Uncertain (ND), when N is the number of dice the
referee rolls. The remaining dice are rolled by the player. There may be
instances where the die roll result is high enough for the player to
understand that the task was successful, or is low enough to understand that
the task was a failure. In some instances, however, the results will remain
uncertain.

	To bluff past a guard into a nuclear power plant.
	(Int + Fast Talk) +1 Fake ID < Difficult (3D)
	Uncertain (1D)

	The player would roll 2D and the referee would secretly roll 2D. Assuming
Int 7 and Fast Talk-3 and he has the Fake ID, the required roll must be 11 or
less on 3D. If the player rolls 3, he knows he must have succeeded (since
even if the hidden die roll is 6, the task would succeed); if the player
rolls 10, he knows he must have failed (since even if the hidden die roll is
only 1, the task would fail). But if he rolls between 6 and 9, he cannot know
if he succeeded or failed until the referee indicates the results of the
third die.
	Actions. Activities which do not depend on character skills or
characteristics are called Actions instead of Tasks. An action is expressed
like a task, but the Task Statement is more free form. It indicates the
information which will be compared against the difficulty level.
	An action is identified by the word Action in the Task Comment.

	To determine initiative in space combat
	(number of ships + sensor rating) < Difficult (3D)
	Action. Opposed (2)

This action is used in space combat.

SPECTACULAR RESULTS
	The results of some tasks may be spectacular in either a positive or a
negative sense.
	Spectacular Success. A task result may be almost perfect. If the actual dice
roll is the minimum possible roll (that is, 2 on 2D, 3 on 3D, 4 on 4D, etc),
the result is spectacularly successful. For example, a computer search not
only succeeds, it also stumbles on the master system password.
	Spectacular Failure. A task result may be terribly bad. If the actual dice
roll is the maximum possible roll (that is, 12 on 2D, 18 on 3D, 24 on 4D,
etc), the result is a spectacular failure. For example, a computer search not
only fails, it also sets off security alarms.

CREATING TASKS.
	The referee in Traveller is often called upon to create tasks as situations
arise. The process for creating tasks is simple and straightforward.
	1. Express the Task Phrase. State specifically and clearly the action that
the players want to perform. The phrase should be no more than one line, and
should encompass one specific action.
	If time is important, the time required to attempt the task should be
stated. This may be no time at all, or may be irrelevant (in which case, time
is ignored), or it may range from 10 minutes to several hours. Typically, one
task will take no more than a day.
	2. Express the Task Statement. Determine the skill required to perform the
task, and state the characteristic associated with that skill in this form:
(characteristic + skill).
	Determine any modifiers which may apply to the task (such as darkness,
weather, computer model). Positive modifiers increase the chances of success;
negative numbers decrease the chance of success. It is possible for both
positive and negative modifiers to be stated. If a significant number of
modifiers are to be stated, shift them to the Task Comments.
	Determine the difficulty level of the task. Using the Task Difficulty Table,
state the difficulty level of the task. Be sure to include the number of dice
to be thrown in parentheses.
Any additional information about the task should be placed in the comments.
State if the task is Cooperative, Opposed, or Uncertain. Include any
additional modifiers which did not fit in the Task Statement.
	3. Express The Task Comments. Indicate if the task is Cooperative, Opposed,
or Uncertain. Indicate if the task is an Action. Indicate any additional
modifiers which did not fit on the Task Statement line.

I\'ve based the sophistication of the anti-hijack program on the TL and
any equipment tied into it. At TL10, for instance, the program could
monitor the status of iris valves (open, closed, locked) and allow
remote control from the bridge. At TL15, it would be much more
effective, actually being able to take limited action based on pre-
established rules. For instance, it could use metabolic scanners, say,
to differentiate between crew and passengers and automatically secure
areas against passengers while reporting any tampering, illegal
substances passing within range (like certain explosives), etc.

If a PC crew wants to spend the time and CrImps putting together their
own shipboard system, I have them write up all the rules of their system
and then *I* run it according to their rules. So far, a really complex
system with onboard auto-turret weaponry has never been cost effective
and has been sometimes down right dangerous to the crew.

   Actually, you\'re wrong about that ratio.  Since KBv1.1 both halfs 
attributes AND doubles skills, the ratio is 4:1; even higher than your
suggested 3:1.  That\'s one of the reasons I like this system so well, \'cause 
it allows different values of stats to have more effect while still remaining
close to the MT stat:skill ratios.  I think this is good for two reasons: 
1) it maintains a greater "consistency of feel" between editions; and 2) it 
helps to alleviate the problem that stat increases are worth so much more than 
skill increases during char-gen.

Trent Smith

P.S.  For anyone who finds it odd that I so adamantly defend Kenneth\'s task
system, it\'s not because he\'s paying me or anything, but because I
independently came up with a fix that was almost exactly the same (except for 
a small difference in number of dice, where he convinced me his way was 
better).

P.P.S.  I seem to recall that KBv1.1 was suggested to IG a few months back as
a possible "optional rule" only to be dismissed with a "we like our current
task system fine," but since the company\'s under different (and much more
reasonable) management now, perhaps it would be worthwhile to re-suggest it?

The problem with this is it still makes attributes more important than skills. You get the 
AD&D syndrome wherein having straight 18\'s is the definition of a good character, rather 
than having a particular skill. Too often someopne has lousy stats but managed to get a high 
skill level (5-6 say) but has a stat of 5-6. Along come Mr."I\'ve got 10+ in all attributes" and 
a major whack of skills of 1-2. One of the things that made CT so great was the fact that 
skills were the end all and be all of the game. Now, it seems that all that matters is high 
attributes. IMO, I would like both attributes and skills to matter, with the benefit of the 
doubt going to skills

The first part is fine IMO. You should have less of a chance to spectacularly succeed on 
really difficult rolls, but the second part makes a bone headed maneuver less likely the more 
dangerous a task you take. Thus your chance of a right royal screw up is 3.6% on an 
average task, 0.46% on difficult, 0.08% on formidable..well, you get the picture (who

I know this isn\'t specifically Traveller, but thought it would be of

I went to see Empire Strikes Back on friday night (great, loved it!) and on
the previews was a preivew for, Starship Troopers (presumably based on
Heinlein\'s book).

Anyhow, the scene shown was of marine-like troops on some kind of desertish
world\'s fortress fighting these pretty cool looking computer generated
aliens, which appeared to look like insects of some sort (yellow and black
colour I think).

That\'s all the preview showed, but I thought it looked pretty cool.

Not sure of how it releates to the novel, as, though I have it, I haven\'t
gottne around to reading it as yet.

Boy, I\'ve been down this road a few time in the last four months or 
so.

If you do some statistical analysis on this difficutly system, you 
will find that it works well for high target numbers, but it just 
kills the lower and mid-range target numbers.  

Since most of a character\'s skills are in the 1-3 range, characters 
will fail much more often than succeed.  The curve on the 
1D-2D-3D-4D-5D-6D system is just too steep.

You should consider using my task system fix to the T4 basic system.  
It will do two things.  It will make skill levels and attributes 
equally important to success at the task throw (because just adding 
skill and attribute weighs the calculation too far in the direction 
of the attributes).  And it will make it harder to achieve success at 
the higher difficutly categories (Staggering and Impossible).

This fix literally fixes all the woes of the T4 task system as 
written in the main book.

There are just two steps that you have to do to implement my task 
system fix, KBv1.1, and that is:

	1)  Calculate target numbers using this method--

		(Skill x 2) + (Attribute / 2)			round up

	2) Change the difficulty dice code for Staggering and Impossible 
	tasks to--

		Staggering 4D
		Impossible 5D

Many here on the TML have adopted this system.  It\'s easy and it 
works.  I\'ve play tested it myself and continue to use it.  I\'d 
like to see it as an Official Optional Rule in one of the upcoming 
supplements.  

I wrote a long post the day before yesterday citing the problems this 
system fixes, and why I went to it.  I even listed the probabilites 
of each target number possible with this system.  If you didn\'t catch 
that, then e-mail me.  I\'ll be glad to re-post it or send it to you.

It is a good idea to kill the half die, but this is harder to do than 
you might expect.  

I tried to get rid of the half die when I was designing my T4 fix, 
KBv1.1.  In doing so, I realized why the original designers of the 
system put them in--they flatten out the curve.

You straight 1-6 system, although it sounds good, is not practical 
unless we find a way to boost the target numbers on the low end.

Actually, I\'ve never sent it, but I think that Joe Walsh said 
something to them and got the response to which you referr.  

And, I\'m sure that many people from IG have seen it on the TML since 
this is the second time it has popped up for discussion in four 
months.

Since Marc is looking at the task system (which I deduce from his 
task post), maybe he\'ll consider making KBv1.1 an Offical Optional

    'body' => 'Ya, know, you really don\'t really know the value of a product until 
you actually use it for play.

A new product comes out for T4, and we all scramble to the stores to 
get it.  Then we flip through it once or twice before hitting the key 
board to either complain about how dissappointed we are or bask in 
the glory of a product that makes us remember why we are so devoted 
to this game in the first place.

When CSC first hit the shelves, I felt the book was mediocre but a 
vast improvement over Starships.  All in all, I was happy with it, 
but I still wanted more from IG.

But now I\'ve got to admit, the more I use CSC, the more I like it.  I 
actually like the product more now than when I first purchased it.

There is so much neat stuff hidden in the pages that it was hard to 
see at first.  There\'s lots of little rules, which I like, covering 
the book.

And I like how it was written.  It is not the usual equipment guide 
that we\'re used to seeing for Traveller.  It is not just a dry plain 
Jane listing of equipment like we\'ve seen in the Imperial 
encyclopedia, the TNE equipment book, and the equipment listings 
in the various CT products.  

The CSC has CHARACTER!  You get the feeling that you are shopping a 
real list of equipment!

For example, check out the entry for Flex-9.  In old Traveller style, 
you would have been told what the armor was made of and given some 
game-mechanic  information.  Although the entry for Flex gives this 
too, it also tells you that the full body version of the  armor was 
originally designed for disposal of explosive or fragmentation 
weapons.

Greg Porter is not just telling us what the stuff is, he\'s telling us 
WHY.

That is just great in my book.  Greg\'s really conveying a "feel" for 
the stuff--and I love his little comments throughout like the few 
paragraphs he wrote on personal armor.  Lots of neat insight here.

As far as I\'m concerned, this is what Traveller needed.  I\'m getting 
excited about this product, and I can\'t wait to see his Emperor\'s 
Arsenal.  Judging by the CSC, we\'re in for a treat.

Good things are happening.

Kenneth.

PS  To Greg--thanks for giving me something a product that allowed me 
to bask instead of bitch.  You did good work.  Keep it up--we\'re 
counting on you.

Only once (well, twice). The PCs had been paid to use their ship as
a sensor platform for some scientists who wanted to perform some
experiments with the event horizon of a traveling black hole
discovered in Reft Sector. The navigator/backup pilot got a little
careless (blew *three* rolls badly) while showing off for the one
scientist who just happened to be stunningly beautiful (ah, the
hormones of youth) and got the ship grazed by some of the gravity
pulses off the BH, thereby tumbling the ship toward it. After
realizing a slingshot maneuver to break free would require more fuel
than they had, the captain gave the order for an emergency jump.

They ended up coming out of Jumpspace travelling away from another
blackhole in the Solomani sphere where they had some fun with SolSec
in the adventure "Signal GK".

The second time this kind of trip happened was when they tried to get
back to the Reft Sector the same way (they had alot of balls if not much
brains). This time the navigator wanted to see my task rolls because he 
felt I had fudged them the first time, which I had...in his favor. Since
he had been whining ever since the first trip, I made the rolls in
front of him using his dice.

He died, the girl died, *everybody* died.

	I\'ve always wanted to try something like David Brin in his "Uplift"

more ... dangerous than others. It\'d be a pain in the ass to try and
balance them all properly so they each have pluses and minuses, though.

1.  Vacuum suits are ruptured by attacks with penetration >= 3.  What,
actually, does this mean?  

Does penetration equal the number of damage dice the weapon uses, regardless
of the target\'s armor rating?

Or... does penetration equal the number of damage dice not negated by the
defender\'s armor rating, e.g., a weapon with 4 damage dice vs. a vac suit
(flexible armor rating = 2) gives a penetration of 2?

Or... have I missed the boat entirely - is penetration equal to something else?

2.  Hand grenades cost Cr250.  Considering that pistols of various types are
available for around twice that, does Cr250 seem reasonable?  This is NOT a
whine about the price (I can change it with a wink of the eye) - I\'m curious
about how the price was arrived at...

3.  Paint/Smoke grenades in a vacuum.  A player came up with this.  The idea
is that the grenade goes off, filling the corridor, room, etc., with
droplets of paint or dust, in order to obscure sight. Paint would have the
possible advantage of smearing visors, etc., while dust of some sort would
have the possible advantage of endurance (because it\'d not stick to the
first surface with which it came into contact).

Would this work?  Why/why not?

Any comments are appreciated! - Bill

I thought that the "P" stood for Population Multiplier, since that is what
it always has before. In the "old days", you took the UWP digit for
Population and multipied the amount given there by the Pop Mult to get the
actual population (or close) of the world. For example , Pop UWP A means
"tens of billions"; a Pop 
Multiplier of 5 would mean there are approximately 50 billion people on the
world. Has this been altered?

I would define it as damage remaining after armor, myself. 

Penetration is what\'s called damage in the T4 rulebook, and evidently is
Something That Will Be Changed in the Bug-stomped version.

Hmmm.. the grenades I design ususally come in about Cr30 or so..

This should work fine.. not however that the smoke will spread out faster,
and thin faster than in an atmosphere.  Using paint grenades, while messy,
could disable boarders.  Cans of spray-paint could also work.

Read it.  Immediately.

As for the movie; it\'s so bad that Virginia Heinlein (Robert\'s widow) is
considering a lawsuit to get his name removed from the project.  How bad is
it?  No power armor, none of the scenes where the morality of being a
soldier is discussed (the heart of the book!), OCS has been cut, and the
entire plot has been changed.

Hear hear!  Isaac would certainly agree!  Having not once, but twice (or
more?) been the victim of malicious attacks against his person by said
defective FSY junk, he is pleased to announce that the felons responsible
have had appropriate justice meted out to them.

	Without an atmosphere, I would expect off the top of my head that the
smoke and paint particles will settle out MUCH faster, i.e. as fast as a
dropped rock.

	Nope. As you\'ve no doubt already seen, my fingers fired off before my

Joe Walsh has mentioned the errata and that he will try to get it up on

I won\'t go into the interior art, except to say I look forward to IG

It is full of color and will be one of the more heavily used Traveller

I much prefer this to the current system in T4.  I dislike 1/2 dice and
regard the increase in difficulty of tasks as a good thing.  However, I
still dislike the way target numbers are calculated.  With the straight
stat+skill system currently in use, high stats make high skill levels
irrelevant.  I urge you to adopt the system developed by Ken Bearden where
the calculation is: 

        1)  Calculate target numbers using this method--
                (Skill x 2) + (Attribute / 2)          (round up)

  You could have a look at my Java starship generation software, try
http://www.spirit.com.au/~jamesd/Trav/SSDS/SAL.html for it. If you are
interested I also have some Amiga software, but given that you didn\'t
mention a computer type I assume you mean for PC.

        Wait, you say... the winning design had an overall rating of 6.37?
Suffice to say that some people were marking very, very harshly.  As well,
I noted that there was massive divergence in opinion; in some cases,
designs were getting marks of 2 and 10 in the same categories from
different people.  So without further ado, here is a beautiful
commemorative ASCII biscuit with the X-TEK logo hastily done up to replace
the original one that I accidentally lost when deleting back digests (sorry
Commander!):

SPECTACULAR RESULTS (NEW)
	The results of some tasks may be spectacular in either a positive or a
negative sense.
	Spectacular Success. A task result may be almost perfect. If the actual dice
roll includes 3 ones (not possible on 2D, obviously) the result is
spectacularly successful. For example, a computer search not only succeeds,
it also stumbles on the master system password.
	Spectacular Failure. A task result may be terribly bad. If the actual dice
roll includes 3 sixes (not possible on 2D, obviously), the result is a
spectacular failure. For example, a computer search not only fails, it also
sets off security alarms.

This gives 0.46% chance of spectacular failure and an equal chance of
spectacular success (and is independent of difficulty), but avoids giving a
spectacular for average or less difficulty.

So I took four typical people and looked at how they would fare under your
system:

Dullard has stat-4 and skill-1. Typical has stat-7 and skill-3. Expert has
stat-12 and skill-7. Superman has stat-15 and skill-12.

Dullard\'s target number is 2+2= 4 (as now it would be 5).
Typical\'s target number is 3 1/2 + 6 = 10. (As now it would be 7+3 = 10)
Expert\'s target number is 6 + 14 = 20. (as now it would be 12+7= 19)
Superman\'s target number is 7 1/2 + 24 = 32. (as now it would be 15+12= 27)

The results aren\'t that much different that we see for the system as now.
Results using Default skills would be lower than now, since 0 doubled is
still zero.

The system does seem to make a difference when someone has a low stat and a
high skill.

I think you have it backwards.  Isn\'t he saying (Attribute/3 + Skill)?  I
think you\'d agree this is superior to the old MT
(Att/5+Skill) method.

One of my problems with MT\'s (and your method too for that matter) is the
need to keep recaluating the Att factor during the game.  As you are hurt
your Attributes go down and consequently so do your target numbers.  Having
to redivide, whether by 2, 3, or 5, is still additional math during the
game, and *that\'s* what slows things down for me.  I\'d rather do as much of
the math as possible before play.  This is one reason why I prefer raising
the Skill more than you do (on average) and not dividing the Attribute at
all.

major overhaul. Thus, in addition to the basic book, or "Marc Miller\'s
Traveller Without Marc Miller" (MMT4w/oMM), we\'ll soon have the new
improved "Marc Miller\'s Traveller Deluxe Edition WITH Marc Miller"
(MMT4DEWMM)!

Anyway...

As the Task System Fix thread seems to have cropped up again, I might as
well repost my 2D Task System (with a few revisions), for those who missed
it the first time around. While it sounds to me like Kenneth\'s fix is
pretty good (it deviates as little as possible from the published rules,
and has by now been carefully adjusted), unfortunately it still uses those
pesky half dice, and IMO too many dice are used in general. I like my game
system streamlined, so my task system that only uses two dice for all
difficulty levels.

I would like to hear from anyone out there who has play-tested this system
- - how did it work? Any problems? I haven\'t had much chance to try it in a
real game - I\'m still working up my campaign, while playing in Roderick\'s.

In Rod\'s game, we used straight T4, and definitely found that Impossible
tasks were too \'easy\' for PCs with high characteristics. At one point, my
character (Dr. Dinaskir) single-handedly repaired many of the major systems
of an utterly trashed yacht (the Massilia) with an Engineering skill of
merely 1 ...and an EDU of F. (Sure, he\'s a bit of an Indiana Jones, and -
as an archaelogist studying the Rule of Man - he\'d have to know at least
something about Engineering, but there are limits...)

Also, I\'ve decided to change the chargen rules in my game so that EDU
benefits don\'t pile up quite so quickly. I think College should give you +1
EDU, graduating with Honours another +1, a Masters gives you +1 and a
Doctorate +1.  

Anyway, here\'s the 2D Task System. The benefits:
  * only two dice are rolled for all tasks,
  * no half-dice,
  * skill levels count for more than stat points,
  * target numbers can be calculated before play begins,
  * characters with high stats and/or skills are not super-powerful,
  * characters with low stats and/or skills are not too weak,
  * similar to a percentile system, hence more intuitive,
  * no pesky bell curve,
  * each increase in difficulty represents an equal decrease in probability,
  * each increase in skill or stat represents an equal increase in probability,
  * easily modified to suit situation, taste, style of game.

Recent changes:
  * Base Target Numbers for 0-level Default Skill tests are now *2*
Difficulty Levels lower than regular BTNs (instead of 1 level as in
previous versions).
  * The statistical percentages table should be a bit more accurate now.

             The 2D Task System
                    v1.5
          A simple task roll system
   compatible with Marc Miller\'s Traveller (T4)

The task roll is always two dice; one for a \'tens\' digit and one for a
\'ones\' digit, for a result between 11 and 66. As in T4, the task is
successful if the player rolls the target number or less.

        Target Number = BTN + (skill*2) + (characteristic-7)

So, to determine the target number for a task:

1. Determine the Base Target Number (BTN):

   Difficulty Level       BTN
      Impossible           06
      Staggering           16
      Formidable           26
      Difficult            36
      Average              46
      Easy                 56

2. Modify the BTN by the PC\'s skill and by the corresponding characteristic.

   2a: +2 for each skill level. 
   2b: +1 for each characteristic point above 7; -1 for each point below 7.
        
NOTE, however, that these modifiers are not added in base-10. The modifiers
are counted as steps up or down the 11-66 matrix:

     <----down        up---->
01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,
31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56,
61, 62, 63, 64, 64, 66

Example: a character with Skill 3 and Stat 9 is attempting a Difficult
task. The BTN is 26. He adds 6 for the skill (3*2=6) + 2 for the
above-average stat (9-7=2), for a total modifier of +8. The result is not
34, as it would be in base-10, because 34 doesn\'t exist on the this matrix.
Instead, he counts 8 steps up the matrix; so the actual target number is
42.

To save time, Difficult-task TNs for all skills can be pre-calculated by
the players before play begins. Adjusting for other Difficulty Levels is a
simple matter of altering the first digit of the target number.

For tests of 0-level Default Skills, don\'t halve the characteristic (as in
T4). Instead, increase the Difficulty by two levels (by simply subtracting
2 from the first digit of the base target number).

As always, a roll of two sixes is a spectacular failure, and two ones is a
spectacular success - even if the target number is below 11. 

Here\'s a chart to showing the resulting targets for an average stat
(ignoring for the moment the Spectacular Result rules)...

Stat = 7                      Skill
              0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7 
Easy         36    62    64    66   Auto  Auto  Auto  Auto
Average      26    52    54    56    62    64   Auto  Auto  
Difficult    16    42    44    46    52    54    56    62
Formidable   06    32    34    36    42    44    46    52
Staggering  -16    22    24    26    32    34    36    42
Impossible  -26    12    14    16    22    24    26    32 

For each stat point above 7, add 1 to these Target Numbers.
For each stat point below 7, subtract 1.

Probabilities:

Stat = 7                        Skill
               0     1     2     3     4     5     6    7  
Easy         48.6  89.6  95.2 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0  %
Average      32.4  72.8  78.4  84.0  89.6  95.2 100.0 100.0  %
Difficult    16.2  56.0  59.4  67.2  72.8  78.4  84.0  89.6  %
Formidable    0.0  39.2  44.8  50.4  56.0  59.4  67.2  72.8  %
Staggering    --   22.4  28.0  33.6  39.2  44.8  50.4  56.0  %
Impossible    --    5.6  11.2  16.8  22.4  28.0  33.6  39.2  %

Chance of Spectacular Success or Failure is always 2.8%.

NOTE: The T4 Multiple Actions rule will not work in this system. A new rule
is needed: when attempting multiple actions, do not divide the
characteristic. Instead, increase the difficulty two levels for each extra
action (-2 to the first digit of the target number). Thus, for a character
with stat of 7 and skill of 6, the target number for a single Difficult
action is 56-; for two such actions, 36-; for three, 16-. (Obviously, this
rule does not allow characters to perform as many extra actions as the
original rule.) [I would be interested to hear suggestions for a better
formulation of this rule.]

I agree about the half dice.  I personally still use them for difficulty
modifiers, but not for regular difficulty levels.  I support the 
1/2/3/4/5/6 die idea.

Yep, they do that.  They also keep the top end lower unless you go to a
non-symetrical increase like your 1.5/2/2.5/3/4/5 method.  I don\'t like
non-symetrical..too hard to remember in the heat of play. Ultimately, the
way to handle this is to increase the skill points for low-end players.

Right!  Try adding 2 for each skill gain rather than 1.  I guess everyody
*knows* I like a random (1d3) increase + aptitude, so I won\'t detail that
again. <g>

Here\'s some more ideas, I don\'t necesserily subscribe to them, but..

Ageism Theory:  as people age their rate of increase in knowledge declines,
ie. a 20 year old will increase in skill/knowledge faster than a 40 year
old, who will increase faster than a 60 year old during a given period of
time.

    Game Effect:  Characters get 2 skill rolls per year up to age
    30; 1 roll per year from 30 to 40; and 1 roll every other year
    after 40.

New Skill Theory:  people develop basic competence in a new skill fairly
quickly, but it takes years to become a master.

    Game Effect: Characters get 2 skill points for each increase up
    a 4.  After that they increase at a rate of 1 skill point per
    increase.
    
..and my own. <g>

Aptitude Theory:  people have more or less aptitude for each skill or
knowledge they want to develop.  This means they will increase at a varying
rate for different skills.

    Game Effect:  Simplist - Roll 1d3 the first time a skill is
    selected noting it on the character sheet.  Increase skill
    points for that skill by that number of points on each
    subsequent selection.

One more thing!  Change the name of the IMPOSSIBLE task to something else. 
It\'s really giving some of our more literal GM\'s and players a problem.  I
can live with it, but I\'d prefer impossible to mean exactly that...call it
ICREDIBLE or something.

	The way that I see penetration is that you determine the number of damage
dice that a weapon inflicts, subtract the armor value, and if you have any
damage dice left that do full damage (not absorbed by the armor) then your
armor has been breached.  With flexible armor the dice that are reduced to
one point represent bruise damage, while full damage dice have penetrated
the armor and gone internal so to speak.

	You can reduce the cost if you want however I see the high price as what
it costs non-military personell to get a hold of (local law level providing
of course).  I would hate to see what kind of carnage a group of
bloodthirsty characters could do with indiscriminate use of frag grenades.
There really should be differrent cost for differrent types of grenades.  I
would think that a grenade used for signalling purposes should be cheaper
and easier to aquired than military frag and anti-vehicle grenades IMHO.

	This would be an effective means of providing cover against laser weapon
attacks if you also cut the gravity.  Its atmospheric density that allows
the dust to remain airborne.  In a vacuum the dust would collect more
quickly towards the center of a gravity well.  Is there any reason why a
grenade constructed using dust particles of the same polarity as the
starship grav plates wouldn\'t be able to remain airborne for use during
boarding actions?  I would think that the dust particles would be repelled
by the grav plates and if you could adjust the gravity (which if I
understand correctly is based on electromagnetic principles) then you could
achieve a point where the dust would neither move towards or away from the
gravity source.

The return of the MT task!  this looks good to me so far.

>Task Phrase:

I\'m really happy to see time return to the task statement.  IMHO this was
one of the things that was sadly lacking from T4.  Might I suggest including
rules for hasty and careful attempts?  For example, Eneri might be in a
terrible hurry to repair the engine, and only take 1 hour, but at an
increased level of difficulty.  Eneri could also be very careful and
methodical, and take 4 hours and a lowered difficulty level.  a rule of
thumb would be:

+1 level of difficulty for each halving of time, -1 level of difficulty for
spending 2x time.

Good way of helping novice referees there.  Also stops the players who say
"I want to leap to the chandelier, swing across the room, shoot the Sword
Worlder Colonel on my way out the window, and land running.  What\'s my roll?"

>	The Task Phrase may contain (in parentheses) the time the task generally

I\'d still like to see most tasks include this information just in case it\'s
needed.. I still have my MT task library somewhere, and all the tasks there
have times.

I think I prefer the old way where the referee and the player both roll the
task.  This system seems a little clunky.

Nice to have this difference noted in the rules.

Others have argued that this system still favors high characteristc PCs to
much, but in my experience T4 characters tend to spread out their skills,
dulling the effect of high characteristics.  

A quick poll of my players found no real problem with the 1/2 die; perhaps
they could be used as intermediary levels between the full die ones?

All in all, this looks like what I expected to see in the first place.

Marc,

I\'m not going to argue *for* Ken\'s plan..he can do that without my help.
<g>

However, I\'d like to point out that many of us prefer skills to have a
greater impact on target numbers than they currently do.  Ken\'s system
doubles skills, and keeps the numbers balanced by halving attributes.  My
system simply doubles (on average) the values of the skills and depends on
larger numbers of dice to balance the
difficulty.  Yes, I like the 1/2/3/4/5/6 dice, that\'s what I\'ve been using
for sometime. <g>

Either way, though, I think most of the folks discussing tasks on the list
would like to see the the balance in target numbers shift from mostly
Characteristics to more Skills..and less
Characteristics.

Kenneth has a good fix, but the prob with 0.5D6 is player honesty, the problem being what

2) how is economic assesment overenthusiastic?

4) the steward is also a medic, if need be

The most awesome relic/plot device that I\'ve played in was Mark Cook\'s
PBEM.  The adventurers of the Elissa returned to their uncharted

past the excitement of a "welcoming committee"  we found ourselves in "The

were instantaneous.  Openings back into real-space, in varying size,
occur at random intervals, durations, and locations in the Wire.  They
don\'t match up to any predictable systems either.  You look outside and
you take your chances...  It pre-dated the Ancients, and the laws of
physics fall apart near the ends (ie bad there).

The occupants of The Wire, is another story...

But the salient question is what is more important, skill or stat? In this
case, Marc, I think your example is flawed, and might be more instructive as
follows:

Dullard has stat 7, skill 1
Typical has stat 7, skill 3
Expert has stat 7, skill 7 
Superman has stat 7, skill 12

The numbers are then: Dullard 8 (T4), 6 (KBv1.1), Typical 10 (T4) 10
(KBv1.1); Expert 14 (T4), 18 (KBv1.1); and Superman 19 (T4), 28 (KBv1.1).

The task systems then are radically different in what the emphasis is on.
Under the T4 system, it is near impossible to have a highly trained and
skilled character with a low stat beat a duffer with a good stat. It also
means that *some* training is better than *nothing*. In my own personal GM
philosophy, I\'d rather reward the skill than the stat. Under the KB system,
skill is primary, and training (enough of it) can overcome a low stat.
Personally, I like that. However, with such emphasis being placed on the
skill, perhaps capping the maximum skill level is called for. For instance,
if a skill level cap of 10 was imposed (ie 10 is the maximum score in any
skill) you could make a statement about what level is the normal
professional level (say 4-5). So a docor is liscensed at 4, say. A normal
doctor\'s target number is 12, meaning that for simple tasks he has almost no
chance of failing, and any failure would be something catastrophically dumb.
A highly trained and motivated (but still stat 7) doctor would have skill 8,
making hs target number 20, maybe a touch high, but workable. A stat 7
doctor with skill 10 would have a target number of 24, which is damned near
godlike, but then again it could be argued that it *should* be.

It just doesn\'t make sense that a bright person (Int C) with Medical 1
should be a better diagnostician than an average (Int 7) liscensed doctor
(Medical 3). Under T4\'s standard system, that is exactly what happens. With
a good stat you can take a couple of levels of JoT and have better target
numbers than low stats and lots of training. To me that is a big problem.

A possible further modification of the KB task system would be to double the
skill only to 5, then add any additional skill singly. For example, a stat 7
doctor with skill 10 under KBv1.1 has a target number of 24. If instead you
doubled only to skill 5 (ie 1/2 stat (4) plus double skill to 5 (10) plus 5
extra levels in Medical) the target number is 19. This might curb the
godliness of extremely highly skilled characters. Alternatively you could
just add more dice to the Impossible and Very Difficult task slots, but I
don\'t have the statistics to work out how often a 19 fails against 5D versus
how often a 24 will, so I am not so sure about how how many more dice to add.

I think you are right, but if you turned the grav-plates off before
deploying it, even in a vacuum you\'d have a sphereoid cloud of non-dispersed
paint/smoke particles. That would be really great stopping beam weapon fire...

I spent some time today (before putting up molding in a room we have been 
working on for the past six weekends!) looking up subsector names for the 
sectors in Milieu Zero and First Survey. I was able to get names for 
Corridor, Vland, Lishun, Core and Massilia. So far I have not been able 
to find names for the subsectors in Antares, Gushemege, Dagudashaag, 
Fornast (even though this is a "ref\'s sector", I\'d like to get the old 
"official" names), Ilelish, Zarushagar, Delphi (same as Fornast, still 
would like to get the names).

If anybody needs them as well, here are the names I\'ve collected. I 
figure on sticking this in both M0 and FS until the official printups are 
available. Sources are mostly DGP\'s Traveller Digest issues...

harshly against overly expensive vessels, this will take overpriced vessels
out of the running.

2) Ship must be capable of accomodating and transporting a mercenary
company and its equipment and vehicles.  Take 40 troops as a very flexible
baseline.  As well, assume that the company in question are not going to be
an armoured frontline elite shock force.

3) Ship must be capable of landing said troops on planet, either via small
craft or by landing itself.

4) Ship must be capable of providing fire support, either locally or from orbit.

5) Ship must be capable of ship-to-ship combat.

6) Ship must have command and communications facilities suited to the
operations it will be undertaking.

Generally Procedural-Like Guidelines (GPLG\'s) and Vaguely Rule-Like
Thingies That Must Be Adhered To Unless You Don\'t Feel Like It
(VRLTTMBATUYDFLI\'s).  Cut these out and paste them over your monitor.  Or
your forehead.


Statement of purpose:

        The THUDDD\'s purpose is a) to provide a variety of innovative and
different designs for use in our Traveller gaming, b) to foster discussion
about the design sequences and to improve our skills and understanding of
the rules and perhaps debug the rules themselves, and c) to have some
friendly, competitive, fun.

GPLG\'s

1) Coordinator (me so far but if anyone wants the job, hint hint) announces
THUDDD open by calling vote.  Where the vote for the previous THUDDD was
very close, he may skip this step and choose the runner-up ship, vehicle,
or weapon class immediately.

2) After the voting period announced is over, Coordinator tallies up votes
and announces winner (ties are resolved by having the Coordinator\'s
significant other choose).  Coordinator then invites comment on design
specifications.

3) After it becomes clear to the Coordinator that everybody\'s provided all
the input they\'re going to, the Coordinator launches the design phase.

4) After the design phase has ended, Coordinator assembles the entries and
posts them to the TML.  Voting takes place over the course of one week from
the date of this posting.

5) After voting phase ends, Coordinator tallies up the votes, declares a
winner and awards the ASCII award donated by prominent TML\'er character,
posts the ratings and comments, and takes a break.


VRLTTMBATUYDFLI\'s

1) The Coordinator may modify, ignore, skip, bugger with, add to, or waive
any or all of the VRLTTMBATUYDFLI\'s and GPLG\'s as needed to make things run
smoothly or fairly.

2) Unless waived, a deadline is a deadline; late submissions and votes will
be ignored.

3) All entries and votes are to be sent via email to the current
Coordinator (who is currently yours truly at <rellio@po-box.mcgill.ca>).

4) Entries may be posted to the list by their designers before the end of
the design phase if their designers don\'t mind helping their competition.

5) One entry per participant.  Subsequent entries by the same participant
will supersede previous entries.  Where you\'ve got multiple designs that
you think rock the free planet, choose one, and one only.

6) Votes may be integral numbers only, arglebarg!

7) Participants may not vote upon their own designs.

8) Ballots are not to be posted to the list; comments may be made but short
is good.

9) Designers MUST use Wildstar\'s improved USD (see Appendix 1: Wildstar\'s
New&Improved USD Format That Must Be Followed (WN&IUSDFTMBF)).  Voters are
encouraged to deal harshly (like they need any encouragement anyhow) with
transgressors.

10) Entries are to follow this outline:  USD first, then descriptive blurb,
then design sequence numbers (this latter is optional).

11) Sticking to the mission requirements is somewhat encouraged.  Harshly
rating designs that stray too far from the mission requirements is also
encouraged.

12) 12 VRLTTMBATUYDFLI\'s are quite enough.  If more are needed Coordinator
may apply VRLTTMBATUYDFLI 1), above and make THUDDD Diktats, Updates, etc
in the course of the THUDDD.

Yep..<g>..I thought about that too.  Of course, you can have
successes and failures on the same attempt.  Here\'s how I\'d handle that: 
1. the roll is less or equal to the target number.."You found the data on
the computer, and as luck would have it, the control codes for the doors
too, but you also set off the security alarms."; 2. the roll is more than
the target number.."You were able to get the control codes, but not the
data you were looking for, AND you set off the security alarms."

Frankly, I still like my SF technique.  The GM picks up any sixes rolled
and rolls them again.  Any sixes on the second roll are increasing levels
of failure.  Yes, these levels are GM determined, and I like it that way.

	Imperial embassies should have some sort of evacuation plan for  important
dignitaries.  Of course there is no reason that the vehicle couldn\'t be
sabotaged or even shot down and forced to land in an even more precarious
situation.  Possibly with the characters on board <G>.

   No offense to Kenneth, but it just has to be said....

   I\'ve seen a number of people here propose any number of fixes to the
T4 system, and I have come to a conclusion: most Traveller players and
referees are totally fixated on using D6 (and its bastard cousin, D3). 
So much so, they would rather come up with complicated formulas, native
ritual dances, or semi-mystical chant spells so that they can use D6s
instead of some other form of dice.

   Why?  Is there something inherantly evil about D10s and D20s that
I\'ve been blinded to because of some spell cast on me by TSR during a
visit to GenCon?  Is it that D10s and D20s are only available here in
Ohio, and the rumors of their availability elsewhere are part of a
diabolical TSR plot?

   I\'m sorry, I just don\'t get it.  I mean really, I can\'t understand
why so many people are going to so much trouble, when going to a D10 or
D20 based system would make life so much damn easier.  Can someone
please explain it to me?

Regards,

Harold

Well, that\'s as may be, but it doesn\'t speak for me! (I realize you said
"most"). I think this comes down to a stylistic debate (LOTS of games these
days have attributes having a greater effect on overall changce of success),
and of course that old stand-by "We want our old Traveller back". I like the
balance of attribute and skill the way it is.

As for task systems, I don\'t mean to personally slam Ken, as he\'s a good guy
and I enjoy reading his posts. But I see absolutlely no inherent value in
using his system over the one Marc has proposed. The target numbers are not
different enough to make any difference, and all that\'s added is another
calculation when making a character (albeit a simple one, especially for
those of us who actually USE Fire, Fusion and Steel...), and the one thing
my players say over and over again is that they like T4 because it\'s SIMPLE!
Realism gets sacrificed for simplicity and playability; thus it was in the
olden days (say 1977) and thus it shall be today.
        IMAGINATION can fill in where realism stops.

There\'s an easy solution; buy some d3\'s! I have three of them and plan to
get more. They are available through most distributors. Wargames West
carries them if nothing else.

if player honesty is that much of a problem, I say employ the PARANOIA

itself were always unsatisfactory as calculating the Alderson Pts. relies
upon lines of equal thermonuclear flux(luminosity).  I eventually settled on
the formula: Alderson Pt(A) in au = sqrt((Luminosity of Star B/Luminosity of
Star A)times ((2d6-1)^2).  Alderson Pt(B) is simply the the previous (2D6-1)
in au distance.  To avoid any unusually large distances I mandated that Star
A will always be the star with greatest luminosity between the pair.  This
convention allows the occurence of the intrastellar Alderson Pts. that were
introduced in "The Mote in God\'s Eye" and "The Gripping Hand" by L. Niven and
J. Pournelle.  I allowed travel time to be instantaneous.
       I enjoyed the strategic implications of the Drive; bottlenecking star
traffic at these unique points with a significant fleet allowed total control
of important trade routes, but I found that game play was not at all
enhanced.
      Note: to limit the power of this system I established a "cap" on the

asks
draft. Here\'s a revision of the draft relecting some of what you have sai=
d.

Tasks
	The activities which characters in Traveller adventures undertake are ca=
lled
tasks. The use of tasks allows specific activities to be resolved
consistently based on defined levels of difficulty and through the use of
appropriate skills, characteristics, and other modifiers. Players can ana=
lyze
tasks and decide on the appropriate character to undertake each, based on=
 who
is best suited to the task.
	Many potential tasks can be skipped over because their resolution would =
slow
down the situation without providing any additional drama. The game refer=
ee
is responsible for determining which situations actually call for resolut=
ion
and which can be assumed completed without difficulty or mishap.
	Dice: Tasks, like all die rolls in Traveller, are resolved using six-sid=
ed
dice. In some cases, a half-dice is called for. A half-die is a standard
six-sided die which has been color coded to distinguish it.=20

 ROLLING TASKS
	When a task becomes necessary, the referee tells the group the task, its
required skill and characteristic, and the difficulty level. The players =
in
the group discuss among themselves who will attempt the task. The player
running the character selected identifies the skill and characteristic le=
vels
and determines the target number.  He or she then personally rolls the di=
ce
and compares it with the target number. Low rolls are best. If the die ro=
ll
result is equal to or less than the target number, the task is successful.
	For example, Eneri Dinsha (ABC789 Mechanic-3) faces the following task:

	To repair a groundcar engine (2 hours).
	(Edu + Mechanic) + Tools (required) < Difficult (3D)

	The target number for the task is (8 + 3 =3D ) 11, which Eneri must roll=
 or
less on 3D. He rolls 6, which means he succeeds in accomplishing the task.

EXPRESSING TASKS
	Tasks can be expressed in a variety of ways, depending on the important
elements of the specific situation. The basic expression consists of a ta=
sk
phrase, a task statement, and any task comments. A typical task should be
stated as with these three elements on three succeeding lines.
Task Phrase:
	To accomplish an important activity (duration).

Task Statement:
	(characteristic + skill) +/- modifiers < difficulty (nD)

Task Comments:
	appropriate comments about the task.

	The Task Phrase: The Task Phrase states the specific purpose of the task=
. It
is stated as an infinitive verb phrase (i.e. "To" followed by a verb and =
any
modifying words). It effectively states what the character wants to do.
	If a task phrase requires more than one line, it is probably too complex=
 and
should be broken into two or more separate tasks.
	The Task Phrase may contain (in parentheses) the time the task generally
takes to accomplish. This information is optional, and may often be ignor=
ed.
	The Task Statement: The Task Statement shows the specific information wh=
ich
is required to resolve the task. Task resolution is based on a skill and =
its
associated characteristic, applicable modifiers, and a difficulty level.
The sum of the characteristic and skill and all applicable modifiers to t=
he
left of the < is the target number. The player must roll equal to or less
than the target number to succeed at the task.
	The Task Comments: The Task Comments include any supplementary informati=
on
about the task. It states if the task is Cooperative, Uncertain, or Oppos=
ed.
It includes any modifiers which did not fit in the Task Statement. It
includes any additional information which may help in understanding the
activity and its resolution.
	Task Difficulties: The Task Difficulty Table shows the levels of difficu=
lty
possible and the associated required die rolls.
	Half Dice. Difficult tasks call for throwing 2=BD dice. While specially =
marked
half dice are available (they have two sides marked 1, two sides marked 2=
,
and 2 sides marked 3). For an alternative, select a six-sided die of a
distinctive color and designate it as the "half die." Divide any result o=
n
that die by two, rounding up: a 1 or a 2 is a 1; a 3 or a 4 is a 2; a 5 o=
r 6
is 3.

DEFAULT SKILLS
	Sometimes characters need to accomplish tasks for which they do not have=
 the
required skill. Any character may attempt a task which specifies a Defaul=
t
Skill, even if the character himself does not have that skill.
	If using a Default Skill, the skill level used is 0 (zero) and the
associated characteristic is halved (round fractions up).
	For example, Eneri Dinsha (ABC789 Mechanic-3), while road testing the
groundcar he has repaired, hits a patch of slippery road.=20

	To avoid an accident
	(Dex + Ground Craft) < Average (3D)

	Eneri has no specific skill in Ground Craft, but it is a Default Skill. =
He
can attempt the task with Dex B halved to 6 + 0). He must roll 6 or less =
on
2D.
	On the other hand, Eneri finds a bomb planted in the ground car. Demolit=
ions
is not a Default Skill; Eneri cannot even attempt to defuse it.

SPECIAL TYPES OF TASKS
	Some tasks reflect special situations which require non-standard methods=
 of
resolution. These include Cooperative, Opposed, and Uncertain tasks, and
Actions.
	Cooperative Tasks. More than one character may actively cooperate in
performing a single Cooperative task. Each individual cooperating contrib=
utes
his (or her) skill level, while one character contributes his (or her)
characteristic.=20
	The Task Comment will say Cooperative (N Skill) indicating how many
characters may participate (N equals the numbers of characters) and that =
the
skill from each will be counted. A Task Comment may instead say Cooperati=
ve
(N Characteristic) indicating how many characters may participate (N equa=
ls
the numbers of characters) and that the characteristic from each will be
counted. If the task is successful, all participants succeed; if it fails=
,
all participants fail.

	To camouflage a vehicle from searching police.
	(Int + Camouflage) < Difficult (3D)
	Cooperative (3 Camouflage).

	Up to three participants may add their skill levels together in the
resolution of this task. The character with the highest Int would contrib=
ute
that characteristic.

	To lift a large log off a vehicle
	(Str) < Difficult (3D)
	Cooperative (5 Str)

	This task requires strength alone (no skill). Up to 5 characters can
participate.
	Opposed Tasks. Characters in direct opposition may jointly participate i=
n an
Opposed task, with the result determining who succeeds (and who fails). E=
ach
participant rolls to resolve the task, with the highest result succeeding=
.=20
	The Task Comment will say Opposed (N) indicating how many characters may
participate (N equals the numbers of characters). The highest result is
successful, provided that result is a success result; all other participa=
nts
fail (regardless of the quality of their results).

	To win a brawl.
	(Str + Brawling) < Difficult (3D)
	Opposed (4)

	Uncertain Tasks. Characters undertaking tasks for which the results are =
not
immediately clear may participate in an Uncertain task. The referee rolls
some of the dice secretly and determines whether the task is successful. =
The
result is only revealed when required by events.=20
	The Task Comment will say Uncertain (ND), when N is the number of dice t=
he
referee rolls. The remaining dice are rolled by the player. There may be
instances where the die roll result is high enough for the player to
understand that the task was successful, or is low enough to understand t=
hat
the task was a failure. In some instances, however, the results will rema=
in
uncertain.

	To bluff past a guard into a nuclear power plant.
	(Int + Fast Talk) +1 Fake ID < Difficult (3D)
	Uncertain (1D)

	The player would roll 2D and the referee would secretly roll 2D. Assumin=
g
Int 7 and Fast Talk-3 and he has the Fake ID, the required roll must be 1=
1 or
less on 3D. If the player rolls 3, he knows he must have succeeded (since
even if the hidden die roll is 6, the task would succeed); if the player
rolls 10, he knows he must have failed (since even if the hidden die roll=
 is
only 1, the task would fail). But if he rolls between 6 and 9, he cannot =
know
if he succeeded or failed until the referee indicates the results of the
third die.
	Actions. Activities which do not depend on character skills or
characteristics are called Actions instead of Tasks. An action is express=
ed
like a task, but the Task Statement is more free form. It indicates the
information which will be compared against the difficulty level.
	An action is identified by the word Action in the Task Comment.

	To determine initiative in space combat
	(number of ships + sensor rating) < Difficult (3D)
	Action. Opposed (2)

This action is used in space combat.

SPECTACULAR RESULTS
	The results of some tasks may be spectacular in either a positive or a
negative sense.
	Spectacular Success. A task result may be almost perfect. If the actual =
dice
roll includes 3 ones (not possible on 2D, obviously) the result is
spectacularly successful. For example, a computer search not only succeed=
s,
it also stumbles on the master system password.
	Spectacular Failure. A task result may be terribly bad. If the actual di=
ce
roll includes 3 sixes (not possible on 2D, obviously), the result is a
spectacular failure. For example, a computer search not only fails, it al=
so
sets off security alarms.

DURATION
	Tasks take time.
	Ignoring Duration: In many cases, the amount of time that a task takes i=
s of
no consequence and is ignored. The referee can decide that the task will =
take
a reasonable amount of time, and that dealing with duration will only slo=
w
down the action.
	Including Duration: When duration is important, the task should state ho=
w
long it will take to attempt the task (even if it is unsuccessful).
	Hasty Tasks: If the players feel that they need to accomplish a task mor=
e
quickly than normal, they can specify that they are being hasty. The time=
 to
complete the task is halved. The difficulty of the task is increased one
level (Average becomes Difficult, etc.).
	Cautious: If the players feel that they need to accomplish a task more
carefully than normal, they can specify that they are being cautious. The
time to complete the task is doubled. The difficulty of the task is decre=
ased
one level (Difficult becomes Average, etc.).
	A referee may allow a task to be declared cautious in order to decrease =
its
difficulty.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
	Several aspects of tasks necessitate special attention.
	Jack of All Trades: One special skill confers on a character the ability
attempt almost any task. A person with Jack of All Trades can use that sk=
ill
in place of any other skill. The skill level used is two less than the sk=
ill
level held (but never less than 0). When Jack of All Trades is used with =
an
effective level of 0, the process is the same as for a Default skill (tha=
t
is, the associated characteristics is halved, rounded up).
	Reactions: Tasks do not take place in a vacuum without regard to the
reactions of other people. The Reaction Table shows initial and subsequen=
t
reactions that individuals may have to tasks directed at them.=20

WORKING WITH TASKS
	When working with tasks, remember the following points:
	Don=92t overdo pre-defined tasks. Published tasks are suggestions which =
may
need to be modified for specific situations. The goal is always to keep t=
he
game moving; don=92t be a slave to the rules.
	The Role Of The Referee: The referee retains (and must always be aware o=
f) a
responsibility to administer the task system in a way that produces reali=
stic
resolutions. The referee can impose results and modifiers, bring in or ap=
ply
other skills or characteristics, or change difficulty levels in order to =
make
the resolution of tasks.=20

CREATING TASKS.
	The referee in Traveller is often called upon to create tasks as situati=
ons
arise. The process for creating tasks is simple and straightforward.
	1. Express the Task Phrase. State specifically and clearly the action th=
at
the players want to perform. The phrase should be no more than one line, =
and
should encompass one specific action.
	If time is important, the time required to attempt the task should be
stated. This may be no time at all, or may be irrelevant (in which case, =
time
is ignored), or it may range from 10 minutes to several hours. Typically,=
 one
task will take no more than a day.
	2. Express the Task Statement. Determine the skill required to perform t=
he
task, and state the characteristic associated with that skill in this for=
m:
(characteristic + skill).
	Determine any modifiers which may apply to the task (such as darkness,
weather, computer model). Positive modifiers increase the chances of succ=
ess;
negative numbers decrease the chance of success. It is possible for both
positive and negative modifiers to be stated. If a significant number of
modifiers are to be stated, shift them to the Task Comments.
	Determine the difficulty level of the task. Using the Task Difficulty Ta=
ble,
state the difficulty level of the task. Be sure to include the number of =
dice
to be thrown in parentheses.
Any additional information about the task should be placed in the comment=
s.
State if the task is Cooperative, Opposed, or Uncertain. Include any
additional modifiers which did not fit in the Task Statement.
	3. Express The Task Comments. Indicate if the task is Cooperative, Oppos=
ed,
or Uncertain. Indicate if the task is an Action. Indicate any additional
modifiers which did not fit on the Task Statement line.

>       Top Ten Reasons Why the Star Wars Characters
>       Would Kick Butt in the Star Trek Universe

   Oh yeah?  Well here are the Top Ten Reasons Why the Star Trek
Characters Would Kick Butt in the Star Wars Universe

10) Stormtroopers have a worse aim than Starfleet Security personnel,
and die in larger quanities.

9)  The Enterprise can time travel back to the era when Darth Vader and
the Emperor were nobodies, kill them, and avoid this whole evil Galactic
Empire business in the first place.

8)  Wesley Crusher, boy genius. \'Nough said.

7)  It only takes one missile in Star Trek to cause a star to nova and
wipe out an entire solar system, but the Galactic Empire has to hire a
crew of thousands and build a weapons platform the size of a moon to
blow up one measley little planet.

6)  Captain Kirk might sleep with almost everything wearing a skirt, but
at least he doesn\'t almost commit incest with his sister.

5)  Bat\'telhs are more fun than lightsabers--the blood of your enemies
gleams on the blade while you observe the firelight of your enemies\'
burning homes.

4)  You call R2-D2 and C-3PO droids?  Ha!  Any one of the female robots
in classic Trek would make a better traveling companion, and for the
females in the crowd, Data can out perform any Star Wars robots, both in
and out of bed.

3)  Jem \'Hedar warriors would not be defeated by a bunch of teddy bears
with rocks and spears.

2)  So maybe Han Solo out flies Captain Picard, but at least Picard can
find the homeworld of Humanity on a map.

1)  T\'Pau could kick the Emperor\'s butt in a best of three falls iron
cage grudge match.

Harold

That\'s simple!

If you GOT the targetnumber or less, this will be a spectacular success.
If you have MORE than the TN, then it\'s a spectacular failure.

Do you consider this ok?

Unfortunately these characters are not all that "typical"; their attributes
and skills all increase in tandem. True, in such a case the attribute +
skill method and (attribute/2) + (skill*2) method will give similar
results, but since this is not the situation where the existing task system
is broken they should give similar results. The trouble is that, using the
published character generation rules, characters will typically have at
least 1 low and 1 high attribute, a few high skills, and lots of skills at
1 or 2. This is the typical case, and this is where the attribute + skill
method breaks down. Lets look at a few characters who really are more
typical, given the existing character generation sequence:

               Attr.  Skill    T4   KB
Hot shot rookie   12      1    13    8
Aging master       6      6    12   15
Typical Employee   7      2     9    8

T4 is the target number using the T4 task system, KB is using Ken
Bearden\'s. The hot shot has twice as much \'natural talent\' as the old
master, but the master has *six times* the experience. In my mind there
should be no contest, the master should wipe the floor with the young punk.
But the T4 system overvalues attributes so much, it says the kid is better.
This is because the attribute and skill systems work on different scales;
an attribute of 7 is average and a skill of 1 is average (the most common
skill level of my players\' is 1, and it\'s enough to get you hired for
starship crew). Simply adding the two overvalues attributes far out of
proportion; the (attribute/2) + (skill*2) method effectively normalizes the
two scales.

Moreover, in T4 the hot shot is a hot shot in EVERYTHING. Since there are
fewer attributes which get applied to lots of skills, characters become
defined by their attributes and not their skills. Is it obvious that an
expert (for example) Historian will also be the best astrogator and
electronics technician? Yet this is how the T4 task system works. In the
KBv1.1 system attributes and skills are more balanced; being good in one
Int-based skill does not automatically make you good in another (though it
helps). The first thing I noticed when I used the KB system in my campaign
was that the characters were a lot more individual; they could specialize
in what they did best. For example, one of my players rolled a 4 Dex but
got Pilot-5 skill. With the T4 task system this character was essentially
useless, other characters with Pilot-1 had higher target numbers. But with
Kenneth\'s task system this character was suddenly the best pilot. He was
still bad in other tasks but at least he had one defining characteristic
that made him useful and fun to play. The player loved this and so did I;
with the T4 task system the high-attribute characters were demigods who
could do anything and everyone else was superfluous. With the KB system
everyone could be a hero in their own specialties, the high-attribute
characters just had more specialties. This effect was not evident until I
actually played using the KB system and is the most important reason I
switched to it. That\'s why I encourage people to actually try and variant
in real play settings before they decide.

Since attributues and skills work on different scales it\'s just not
reasonable to simply add them together. The KBv1.1 system has much more
variety; a character can be expert in one skill and bad in another one
based on the same attribute. This is much more realistic and fun to play.
Whatever task system you decide on should have the same feature, and I felt
Kenneth\'s required the fewest changes to the rules.

	This is better than the previous proposal but is not yet right.
The Spectacular Failure System seems about right however the Spectacular
Success System is broken.  As you roll more dice the odds of getting 3
ones goes up.  Therefore under this system you would have a greater
chance of a Spectacular Success at an Impossible Task than you would at
a Difficult Task, and this is _wrong_.  I am not sure how to fix this
however.

	I would also like to suggest the adoption, or at least the optional
adoption of the 2X Skill and 0.5 x Attribute System for Task Rolls.  I
think that T4\'s current task system (like TNE\'s) is _wrong_ because
training is more important than natural talent and not the reverse.

couple observations:
     1) With the new (KB-ized) difficulty levels, most of the example task
difficulties are now wrong!
     2) It\'s possible to succeed at some of the harder-difficulty tasks
(Form= 18; Stag= 23,24; Imp= 28,29,30) while also achieving a Spectacular
Failure.  How should such tasks be handled?  Does the SpecFail take precedence
over the Success?  (this seems reasonable, and ensures there is no "Sure Thing"
on such tasks).  This should be stated explicity one way or the other.

Comments of my own:
     While Kenneth has obviously succeeded in convincing MM, as well as me, of
the statistical superiority of his dice progression, I\'m still sorry to see
that half-die on the table, especially since (as the example tasks showed)
Difficult is by far the most commonly-assigned task difficulty.  Is there
REALLY no way to stick to whole-dice, remain relatively close to the current
system, and get a desirable probability spread?
     As for the other step of KBv1.1, it seems that for the present MM is
sticking with the original T4 system, which I can easily understand, since the
added math step of the KB system seems like an unnecessary hassle, but the more
I think about it, the more I become convinced that having skills outweigh
attributes on a point-for-point basis is not only a matter of taste, but is
actually essential to the feel and balance of the game.  At very least I think
this should be included in a parenthetical note as an Optional Rule-- don\'t
require the extra step for refs who don\'t care, but allow it for those who do.
     Aside from that I think the new system is a very good thing and if
(important if!) it is applied consistently to tasks throughout the rest of the
rulebook, it will go a long way towards making T4.1 actually BE the game that a
lot of us were hoping and expecting that T4 would be.

Smoke and paint droplets in vacuum would behave as freemoving particles.
Each droplet/particle would move in a straight line and then bounce or
cling. I\'d say it woyld be useless except to aim at somebody like a
spraycan. Look at the dust kicked up by NASA guys fooling around on the
moon, the dust settles extremely fast onto the ground despite the 1/6 G.
This is because each dust particle follows is free flying without air drag.

Dust/paint with atmos in 0-G on the other hand seems a very good idea.

You can probably find all of the subsector names for known space at Peter
Keel\'s site at

http://www.lugs.ch/~killer/traveller/

which has the best library of sector and subsector names I\'ve found, but
not all the subsectors have UWPs.

For the archive of old sectors (which will have subsector names as well)
which includes UWPs try Joe Heck\'s site at:

http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/

and go into the \'Missouri Archives\' in the \'General\' folder.  You could
spend days scrabbling round in that musty archive!  It only covers \'Atlas
of the Imperium\' (c1100) though...

 OK, this wasn\'t exactly clear. Apologies.

 Your annual cost total neglected to take the monthly payments into
account, which ment that your annual profit was overestimated by about
2750 KCr. Not that this mattered much - I assessed commercial viability on
"real" economic performance, and since this vessel actually made a profit

pretty well.

 Yes, for "routine operations". Is carrying passangers a "routine
operation", or does the Imperial Ministry of Commerce demand more than a
skeleton crew when people\'s lives are on the line?

> 4) the steward is also a medic, if need be

 Yes. But it would have been nice if your blurb had said so, and better if
it had included a full crew manifest in addition to its "recommended"
levels.

 In retrospect, my comments may have been a little harsh sometimes. OTOH,
looking at the averages, it seems I was one of the more merciful voters.

Depends what it\'s hooked up to: IIRC CT Adventure 1 (Kinunir) had a laser
built into each hatch which could cut intruders to pieces?

And in my game the players tend to rig up a few Claymore mines, sleep gas
and (for the finale) the power plant overload circuit, to the anti-hijack
system. Nothing\'s gone wrong... yet. Just waiting for that little
short-circuit or logic fault in the computer. :-)

Sure, there are cases where the two system are not different.  There are
also many cases where the results are very different.  Limiting skills to
1-6 and stats to 1-12 (the normal range for most PCs) we can easily have
both character A (Stat-6 Skill-5) and character B (Stat-11 Skill-1) in the
same game.  Currently A has a TN of 11 & B has a TN of 12.  This is IMHO
wrong.  A skill level of 5 should mean more than this.  Under Ken\'s system
A would have a TN of 13 and B would have a TN of 7.  This is a huge change
and is one of the primary reasons for using Ken\'s system. 

In short, Ken\'s system of 1/2 stat + 2x skill is specifically designed
mostly to make sure high skill low-moderate stat characters (stats of say
5-8) are not outclassed by skill level 1 & 2 characters with high stats
(10+)

Also, currently having an Education of 12+ is easy if the PC goes to
college and having a high Int is easy if you roll well when mustering out. 
There are going to be a lot of high stat character I think the current
system is far to easy because if you have a stat of 10+ all skill rolls
are pretty easy even if you only have a skill of 1 or 2.  As I see it,
Staggering and Impossible tasks should not be quite so easy for characters
a character with a 11 or 12 stat and a 1 or 2 skill. 

Also, I looked at your latest revision ad I still don\'t like 1/2 dice and
think that 5D for impossible tasks devalues impossible tasks.  If someone
is an top-flight expert they may well have a TN of 17 or 18.  I don\'t like
the idea of any possible PCs having a 40-50% chance to perform an
Impossible task.  This makes Impossible Tasks seem to easy and takes much
of the challenge out of the game. 

No 1/2 dice and 6D Impossible tasks is a better solution.

The target numbers were not broken in the T4 rules.  KBv1.1 was 
designed to give comprobable target numbers BUT to give more weight 
to a character\'s skill level.

It is not the target number I had a problem with.  It\'s the fact that 
one\'s attribute (read untrained, natural ability) is more important 
to a character\'s success than his skill level (read training).

AND it was designed to fix, with minimal changes to the offical 
rules, the problem with Staggering and Impossible tasks being too 
easy.

Actually, I wanted the target numbers to be about the same as they 
were in T4, and that\'s about where they are.

Skill just counts for more in KBv1.1, as it should.

Or you can have each player designate a different colored D6 at the 
start of the game to always be his D3.

As far as rounding up goes, I don\'t see how this could be a problem.  
Rounding up means that you round up to the next whole number for 0.5 
and above.  0.4 fractions are dropped to the next lower whole number.

If this is still a problem for you and your players, then write this 
on a sheet of paper and hand it out--

D6		D3
1		1
2		1
3		2
4		2
5		3	
6		3

Your players that have trouble rounding (and being honest) can look 
at their designated colored die, then look at this chart and know 
what they\'ve rolled.

I\'m sure that it will only take a few times before they need to look 
at this paper if they can\'t round up a D6 to a D3 on the first try.

QSDS (T4 p95) says that 1 Steward and 1 Medic are required if there is
a single high passenger. 
Stewards: 1 steward per 8 high psg/cmd crew, and 1 steward per 50 mid 
psg/other crew. Fractions rounded UP.
Medics: 1 medic per 120 people, and 1 medic per 20 low berths. No
rounding mentioned.

SSDS says that the requirement is rounded down, unless it is less than 1,
when it  becomes part of the duties of the Misc crewmember, if any. So 1
high passenger, no command and no mid passengers do not need a steward,
or a medic.

The other problem is that the steward requirement for mid psg is per 100
in SSDS, and per 50 in QSDS.

The question is - which one is right, or have I missed something?

It is hard to say this to someone who doesn\'t get it Harold, but here 
it is.  Traveller IS D6\'s just like D&d is D20\'s.

When TNE came out and used, gag, D20\'s, I spent months converting the 
TNE task system to D6\'s.

Why?  Because it is just not Traveller without them.

Now, I\'d feel the same way if somebody tried to change D&D to a D6 or 
percentile system.

And that\'s the best way I can explain it to you.  D6\'s are Traveller.

I wouln\'t have it any other way.

Apparently, many others wouldn\'t have it any other way either.

That\'s what I thought at first too, but it\'s really not a problem at 
all.  I bet you already have it memorized.  I know I do.

The same goes for the target number calculation.  The player gets 
hit.  He takes his damage.  Then when he attempts another task, it is 
easy to double the skill again and add it to half the new, lowered 
attribute.

Try it.  Once you\'ve done it a few times, you\'ll find that it is not 
hard at all.

I have no problem with the difficulty being called Impossible, but 
then again, Incredible is fine too.

We all know, or should know, that the Impossible category means 
really, really, #$@^&! hard--not a 0.00% chance of accomplishing the

Thanks for saying this, Richard.  I think that KBv1.1 sounds harder 
than it is.

I\'ve been using it for about 4 months now, and my game is cruising 
along at a good clip.  We\'re not having any trouble with the 1/2 die 
or the math.

If I could improve KBv1.1, I would remove the 1/2 die and change the 
calculation to simple addition like T4 is originally.

As it stands, though, they (the simple multiplication/division and 
1/2 die) are a necessary evil unless a totally new task system is 
developed.

Ya know, that Pilot-5 skill (almost twice the skill of a liscensed 
doctor) should count for something.  KBv1.1 is doing its job making 
skills important again.

OK, Marc, let me lay a few assumptions on you.  

1) First, the KBv1.1 task system was designed to fix the problems in 
the basic T4 task system as it was written in the book--not re-create 
a task system. 

I wanted to stay as close as possible to the system as 
written and still fix the problems of having the attribute more 
important than the stat (The Pilot-1, Dex-10--Pilot-4, Dex-6 problem) 
and the problem of having Staggering and Impossible tasks too easy to 
obtain (thus the change in dice to 4D and 5D for those two 
categories).

My question here is--are you wanting to change the whole task system 
or stay close to the original T4 system as written?

If the latter, then I advocate my system because it is the best way 
that I have found (and I\'ve looked at a lot of ways) to fix the T4 
system and have the system still recognizable as the T4 system.  It 
takes a minimum of steps with my system, as I have already explained 
in earlier posts, to fix what is broken in T4.

If you are suggesting that a new system is introduced all together, 
then KBv1.1 is not appropriate.  It wasn\'t designed to be a new task 
system, like some others that have been posted here on the TML.  It 
is only a fix to T4.

If I had my rathers, I\'d get rid of the 1/2 die all together.  And, 
although my target number calculation is relativly easy (double one, 
half another), it is not as smooth as just adding two numbers 
together like the T4 system.

What I would really like is to see a system that only uses whole dice 
on the difficulty categories and has an easy target number 
calculation.  

Your T4 fix with whole dice does this, but as I have stated, if you 
run the numbers you will see that the curve is too steep for the low 
level skills.  In order to use this system, we are going to have to 
find a way to boost the lower target numbers up so that a character 
has a decent chance of doing something.

Also, the attribute vs stat problem needs to be addressed, and this 
needs to be addressed in such a way that target number calculation is 
easy to calculate even after the character is wounded.

Just adding attribute and stat gives too much weight to the 
attribute.  Although the attribute should have a big impact on the 
target number calculation, it shouldn\'t be bigger than the effect 
skill level has on the number.



2)  Another assumption.  Your Superhuman character had a skill level 
of 12.  I don\'t see skills getting that high, do you?  I see them 
going to 7, maybe 8, before the character is too old to adventure.

Maybe this comes from the T4 XP system, which I think is broken too.

Before I can advocate a system, I need to know where your thinking is 
on this.  Are level 12 skills obtainable?  

Since much of T4 is based on CT--in fact, I consider T4  as CT with a 
few tweaks--I assumed in designing KBv1.1 that skill levels will be 
valued at about the same as they were in CT (a character just had 
more of them, but the skill levels were still the same value).

You would never see a level 12 skill in CT.  And, under the skills 
section, it still says that a doctor is a level-3 skill.  Judging by 
this (and other numerous CT-T4 comparisons), level 12 skills should 
not be possible in T4 either.



3)  Your original post to me compared target numbers, but target 
numbers are not what is broken in T4.  In fact, I wanted my numbers 
from KBv1.1 to be very close to the target numbers I would get if I 
used T4 as is.  KBv1.1 does that.  

The problem is not the target 
number, its that attributes are weighted much more than skills.  
KBv1.1 levels the field between the two.



>Where the system might make a difference is 

With that out of the way, let\'s talk about KBv1.1.

Again, we assume that:
	1) We want to stay as close to the T4 system as possible but still 
	fix the attributes-weighted-more-than-skills problem and the 
	Staggering/Impossible-tasks-are-too-easy problem.

	2) We want an easy to calculate target number.

	3) Skills will top out at 6, 7, or 8

How does my system fix the problems listed in point number one above?

	Here\'s the old Pilot example:

	Jane has Pilot-1, a beginner, but a natural ability, Dex-10.
	Paule has Pilot-4, a professional with a great deal of skill, but 
	natural ability of about average, Dex-6.

	Under T4 as written, Janes target number is 1, and Paule\'s target 
	number is 10. 

 Jane\'s natural ability has given her, a beginner,  a better success 
at piloting than a professional with great skill.  

	Under KBv1.1, this problem is fixed.  Jane\'s target number is 7 
	whereas Paule\'s target number is 11.

Skill has overcome raw, untrained, natural ability.  First problem 
(with T4) solved.

OK, now for the second problem--the difficulty percentages.  After 
running the numbers, I saw that most of the categories were 
fine.  The only problem came in when a character needs to make a 
Staggering or Impossible throw.  I\'ll use the Impossible category for 
an example below.

	Ulric has Computer-4 and EDU-9.

T4							KBv1.1
Target Number:  13				Target Number:  13
Impossible success chance:  44.37		Impossible success chance:  15.2

The target numbers are the same(again, they weren\'t broken in T4), 
but clearly from the first example, target number calcuation is 
weighted towards skills and attributes still have a major role in the 
number.

The success chance is where the KBv1.1 system works.  It reduces the 
chance of the Impossible task by a large amount.  Only the highly 
skilled will succeed with such an attempt.

Since you have already adopted the difficulty system I propose in 
KBv1.1--

(from your most recent post)

> TASK DIFFICULTIES
> Difficulty	Dice	Typical	Expert
> Level	Code	Success	Success
> 	Easy	auto	100%	100%
> 	Average	2D	 86%	100%
> 	Difficult	2=BDD	 61%	100%
> 	Formidable	3D	 38%	100%
> 	Staggering	4D	 10%	 92%
> 	Impossible	5D	   2%	 61%

I am guessing that you have calculated target numbers and compared 
them to your other proposed whole die system--and found it to 
be unacceptible because the curve was too steep.

If you can come up with a better way to get rid of the half die, then 
I\'m all for it.  For now, it seems the best solution to this problem 
is to use the difficulty fix I proposed in KBv1.1.

Now, we have to attack the problem of attributes being weighted more 
than skills in the target number calculation.

And that leads us back to the beginning of this post.

Double skills, halve attributes.

What questions do you have at this point?

OK, Marc, let me lay a few assumptions on you.  

1) First, the KBv1.1 task system was designed to fix the problems in
the basic T4 task system as it was written in the book--not re-create
a task system. 

I wanted to stay as close as possible to the system as 
written and still fix the problems of having the attribute more 
important than the stat (The Pilot-1, Dex-10--Pilot-4, Dex-6 problem)
and the problem of having Staggering and Impossible tasks too easy to
obtain (thus the change in dice to 4D and 5D for those two
categories).

My question here is--are you wanting to change the whole task system
or stay close to the original T4 system as written?

If the latter, then I advocate my system because it is the best way
that I have found (and I\'ve looked at a lot of ways) to fix the T4
system and have the system still recognizable as the T4 system.  It
takes a minimum of steps with my system, as I have already explained
in earlier posts, to fix what is broken in T4.

If you are suggesting that a new system is introduced all together,
then KBv1.1 is not appropriate.  It wasn\'t designed to be a new task
system, like some others that have been posted here on the TML.  It is
only a fix to T4.

If I had my rathers, I\'d get rid of the 1/2 die all together.  And,
although my target number calculation is relativly easy (double one,
half another), it is not as smooth as just adding two numbers together
like the T4 system.

What I would really like is to see a system that only uses whole dice
on the difficulty categories and has an easy target number
calculation.  

Your T4 fix with whole dice does this, but as I have stated, if you
run the numbers you will see that the curve is too steep for the low
level skills.  In order to use this system, we are going to have to
find a way to boost the lower target numbers up so that a character
has a decent chance of doing something.

Also, the attribute vs stat problem needs to be addressed, and this
needs to be addressed in such a way that target number calculation is
easy to calculate even after the character is wounded.

Just adding attribute and stat gives too much weight to the 
attribute.  Although the attribute should have a big impact on the
target number calculation, it shouldn\'t be bigger than the effect
skill level has on the number.



2)  Another assumption.  Your Superhuman character had a skill level
of 12.  I don\'t see skills getting that high, do you?  I see them
going to 7, maybe 8, before the character is too old to adventure.

Maybe this comes from the T4 XP system, which I think is broken too.

Before I can advocate a system, I need to know where your thinking is
on this.  Are level 12 skills obtainable?  

Since much of T4 is based on CT--in fact, I consider T4  as CT with a
few tweaks--I assumed in designing KBv1.1 that skill levels will be
valued at about the same as they were in CT (a character just had more
of them, but the skill levels were still the same value).

You would never see a level 12 skill in CT.  And, under the skills
section, it still says that a doctor is a level-3 skill.  Judging by
this (and other numerous CT-T4 comparisons), level 12 skills should
not be possible in T4 either.



3)  Your original post to me compared target numbers, but target
numbers are not what is broken in T4.  In fact, I wanted my numbers
from KBv1.1 to be very close to the target numbers I would get if I
used T4 as is.  KBv1.1 does that.  

The problem is not the target 
number, its that attributes are weighted much more than skills. 
KBv1.1 levels the field between the two.



>Where the system might make a difference is 

With that out of the way, let\'s talk about KBv1.1.

Again, we assume that:
 1) We want to stay as close to the T4 system as possible but still 
 fix the attributes-weighted-more-than-skills problem and the 
 Staggering/Impossible-tasks-are-too-easy problem.

 2) We want an easy to calculate target number.

 3) Skills will top out at 6, 7, or 8

How does my system fix the problems listed in point number one above?

 Here\'s the old Pilot example:

 Jane has Pilot-1, a beginner, but a natural ability, Dex-10.
 Paule has Pilot-4, a professional with a great deal of skill, but 
 natural ability of about average, Dex-6.

 Under T4 as written, Janes target number is 1, and Paule\'s target 
 number is 10. 

 Jane\'s natural ability has given her, a beginner,  a better success
at piloting than a professional with great skill.  

 Under KBv1.1, this problem is fixed.  Jane\'s target number is 7 
 whereas Paule\'s target number is 11.

Skill has overcome raw, untrained, natural ability.  First problem
(with T4) solved.

OK, now for the second problem--the difficulty percentages.  After
running the numbers, I saw that most of the categories were fine.  The
only problem came in when a character needs to make a Staggering or
Impossible throw.  I\'ll use the Impossible category for an example
below.

 Ulric has Computer-4 and EDU-9.

T4							KBv1.1
Target Number:  13				Target Number:  13
Impossible success chance:  44.37		Impossible success chance:  15.2

The target numbers are the same(again, they weren\'t broken in T4), but
clearly from the first example, target number calcuation is weighted
towards skills and attributes still have a major role in the number.

The success chance is where the KBv1.1 system works.  It reduces the
chance of the Impossible task by a large amount.  Only the highly
skilled will succeed with such an attempt.

First off, there will be no SS for an Average task?  There should be.

And, I\'d like to see the percentage chance of rolling 3 ones or 3 
sixes for each difficulty.

I don\'t have the numbers in front of me, but the percentage chance 
for a SS will GO UP the more dice you roll.

This means that characters will have NO chance of rolling SS for Easy 
and Average tasks but WILL have a chance of rolling SS on a Difficult 
task.  And, they will have a BETTER chance of rolling SS on 
Formidable rolls, and this chance will GO UP the harder the task 
gets.

There\'s something definitely wrong with that thinking.

T4\'s system is pretty good as is.  For Easy tasks, there IS a chance 
for SS, but no chance for SF--meaning that you can\'t screw up 
(although you can fail when your GM makes your roll Easy tasks) and 
Easy task, but you can do really well at it.

This makes sense for Easy tasks.  

Since SS in T4 (as written) is the lowest number available on the 
amount of dice thrown, the chance that an SS occurs GOES DOWN the 
harder the task gets.

This makes a lot of sense to me.  The harder the task is, the harder 
it is to do really well at it. 

And SF is only two 6\'s.  This means that the chance of really 
screwing up a task GOES UP the harder the task becomes.

This makes sense as well.  I would expect to have a bigger chance of 
royally screwing up on an Impossible task over a task that was only 
Difficult.

I think you should leave SS and SF as is.

Noticing that you are considering the difficulty definitions I 
proposed with KBv1.1

> TASK DIFFICULTIES
> Difficulty	Dice	Typical	Expert
> Level	Code	Success	Success
> 	Easy	auto	100%	100%
> 	Average	2D	 86%	100%

> 	Formidable	3D	 38%	100%
> 	Staggering	4D	 10%	 92%
> 	Impossible	5D	   2%	 61%

The percentages of SS and SF are pretty good with the T4 system 
combined with these new difficulty dice codes.

Here they are:
			SS						SF
Easy			100% (or 5.56% is you roll)		0.00%
Average		2.78%					2.78%
Difficult		0.93%					2.78%
Formidable		0.46%					7.41%
Staggering		0.08%					13.19%
Impossible		0.01%					19.62%

My vote:  Don\'t change the T4 SS and SF definitions, or at least 
re-think what you are changing it to.	
  


> DURATION
> 	Tasks take time.

I assume that this is a throw back to the time calculation for tasks 
in MT.  I think that its a good idea, and when I need to know a time 
for a task, I use this system too.

One thing that you didn\'t mention in your paragraph, though, is how 
to roll for time.

I really like the MT method where the GM figures the average time it 
should take the average person to complete a task and take 10% of 
this figure.  This becomes the time multiplier, and player\'s roll 
3D6.  The result of this roll is multiplied by the time multiplier.  
Players can use their skill levels as a negative DM on the 3D6 roll 
to decrease the throw and decrease the time it takes to accomplish 
the task.

This system gives a good variance to the time it takes to complete a 
task.

I\'m glad you put it in.

You should correct the table to reflect the chances for SS and SF.  
For example, with regard to SF, a Staggering roll can never be 100%.

I already have a table that reflects both SS and SF for this 
difficulty system--using the T4 definitions of SS and SF.

I\'ll post it for you if you like.


Keep up the good work, Marc.  We\'ll make this thing bug free yet.

In the CT book Fighting ships there was a large ore carrier that had jump
mesh to put around large boulders of asteroids for transport. This is just
for the record as I don\'t like the concept of flexible jump meshes and the
illos in Fighting Ships was so horrible that I could never use them. the

You\'re comparing the ubiquitous apples and oranges, again...

Olympic skaters train for the EDGE over other trained skaters.  Skating
FOUR plus natural ability make for good skaters (know any world class
skaters that don\'t have a naturally HIGH dexterity and endurance?  I\'ve
never heard of one... Not even of "so-so natural ability".  They were all
"buff" before they began training, usually right around birth, or just
before.  OR they developed those stats in conjunction with their skill
training...  It\'s not as if they stop developing DEX and END while
practicing whatever it is that skaters have to be skilled at, like watching
the ice, or something...  Maybe it\'s all natural ability and no skill at
all, perhaps we just need a few more stats in Traveller! ;-)

You\'re comparing a highly talented person with a trained AND highly
talented person...  You\'re unlikely to find HIGHLY trained people with NO
natural talent.  Characters with a STR of 2 don\'t cut it in the Marines,
and therefore never build up their combat skills very high...

William F. Hostman also contributed:

I, for one, do not agree.  So there.  ;-P  [It is important to note that
the author sought earlier to avoid any confrontation over the nuture v.
nature issues, but was provoked beyond the expected tolerance of any
sophont.  -ed.]  I think the assumption that once a character begins formal
"training" that s/he never continues developing "raw ability" is wrong.

Natural talent is the basis for ANY training whatsoever.  "If thou has
niescht the ability, thou wilt niescht develop any skill..."  [Pardon the
poor spelling, and abuse, of German.  The author has no formal training,
ability, or any other experience with the language, he just thinks it
sounds kewl.  -ed.]

If you have the coordination of George McFly, the you\'ll not be developing
much skill at the old arcade with the pistola...  In fact, you\'ll probably
avoid any such place that might put you nearby someone who could possibly
excel at it (FoEx, his son).
</rant>

I think that we\'re all beating the dead horse of whether a few jedi
characters get off easy or not.  If PCs in your game come up being all
jedi, then simply change the rules you use for generation, or XP, or
whatever.  Or make a special rule that they have to roll double the dice,
"just because..."  STOP THE MONTY HAUL.  Sorry.  Heh.


XP and Development during play

I intend to use a "hero point" system where the PCs acquire hero points for
spectacular success and spectacular failure.  These points can be
accumulated slowly, once per "session" for any given skill and put into a
general pool of "hero points" which has two uses:

1. For use as DMs to rolls (i.e. the old brownie points, but usable during
actual play), for which they are expended.

2. For use in developing skills (requiring a number of points equal to the
level to be gained, plus the cost/time of the requisite training) for which
they are expended.

        You were indeed.  There were a lot of 2\'s, 1\'s, and 0\'s handed out.
I think that a lot of the reason for the harshness was the fact that Far
Traders are basically boring ships to design and evaluate; since the
purpose is to make money, the bottom line becomes the main concern,
funkiness suffers, people get bored, and when they see yet another 200td Sl
Slab econobox, they marked harshly.

        I think that with the Merc Cruiser THUDDD, where the ships are
bigger, the emphasis on profitability absent, and the mission requirement a
little bit more exciting than "jump 2 make money", the ratings might be
higher...

Sure Harold, it\'s like this...

For SOME people (not all but SOME), Traveller is a nostalgia trip. Thus,
efficiency and logic don\'t enter into the discussion; they want their
Traveller exactly the way it used to be! I\'ve even heard a few of these
folks complain about the parts of T4 that are VAST IMPROVEMENTS over CT.
Some even grouse about MT, and Grandfather forbid you should mention TNE to
them...
        To these souls living in the past, Traveller has always been D6\'s
and nothing but d6\'s, and they can\'t -or more accurately WON\'T- hear of any
other idea. 
        Hey, if you want to continue playing a
good-for-it\'s-time-but-way-too-archaic-for-today\'s-market-game, feel free.
Lots of other people do too; it\'s called AD&D. And have fun. That\'s what
it\'s all about. But don\'t expect the rest of us to follow you.
        NOW, having said that, I have no problem with T4 using d6\'s (or d6\'s
with d3\'s) rather than other forms. It is true that some new players can get
confused with multiple types and sizes of dice, at least for the first
couple of sessions. But if Marc suddenly decided tomorrow that Traveller
needs to use d30\'s, that wouldn\'t bother me either, because to me the play\'s
the thing. I could care LESS what kind of dice Traveller uses.

the moment, but take a look when you\'ve got time.... I developed some
guidelines for Geonee starships (you better take them into account if you
plan to travel in Massilia) and Scott created one example.

        ===================================
        Geonee Standard Ship specifications - by Carlos Alos-Ferrer
        ===================================

	Geonee starships present a certain number of unusual features.

	1) Low interdeck height
	Geonee are 1.5 m tall, so the interdeck height in their ships is
usually smaller than in Vilani/Solomani ships. Typically, this height is around
2.4 m rather than the standard 3 m.
	For mapping purposes, this means that 2 displacement tons are
equivalent to 5 squares of 1.5 x 1.5 m, rather than 4. This makes Geonee
deckplans slightly larger than that of other races, but when one enters
in a Geonee ship, the first thing to notice is the fact that the ceiling is
very close.

	2) Only large staterooms
	Geonee starships are usually equipped only with large staterooms
for both the crew and passengers, in order to allow the male Geonee to
occupy the stateroom with the bondmaker or Chirper "pet" that typically
is attached to him.

	3) The brig.
	Most Geonee starships, specially the commercial ones, are
equipped with a small stateroom  which serves as a vault or brig where valuable
items can be kept under lock and key if necessary. This can include Geonee
females, for instance when some female is sent by her father, husband or
son from one world to another.

 	4) Threatening appearance.
	Other races typically find Geonee starships "threatening" because
of their particular design style. Falcon-like designs, for instance, are
common.

	5) Missiles.
	Geonee show some preference towards missiles above lasers. This
preference is deeply rooted in the historical effects of active volcanoes
and earthquakes in their homeworld. Psychologists argue that missiles cause
effects that can be more easily associated with those natural phenomena,
and so cause an instinctive fear on most Geonee, making them preferable
to the military mindset.

        6) Cost.
        The specific features of the Geonee ships typically make them a
bit more expensive than the analogous ships from other races.

 	7) Tech level.
	In Milieu Zero, the Tech Level of most Geonee ships is 11, but TL
12 ships are common and even TL 13 not unusual. TL 14 systems can also be
found occasionally.
	In 1105/1120, most Geonee ships are TL 15/16.
	In the New Era, new Geonee ships are TL 11. Old ships of TL 15/16
are also operated, but as their systems slowly fail, they are being
substituted by TL 11 ones.

        One of the most frequently encountered Geonee ships is the "Adroaal"
class Free Trader. "Adroaal" means "Profit-maker" in Irkonee (the most
widespread Geonee language), or, more correctly, "the one who makes profits".

   I too like the new emphasis on attributes, and my players seem to
   like it too. In the past, my players used to roll up a high attribute
   (say, Str) and then get disappointed when they discovered it didn\'t
   really count for much. Now the players are all much more excited
   about their character\'s statistics. Off course, no one has rolled up
   a character that sucks yet. 8^)

   Each character seems to have at least one attribute pretty high, and
   this has led to specialization among the team. It\'s kinda fun.  But
   it does mean that I need to make my tasks harder to keep things
   challenging for the team ("difficulty inflation"). This is a
   drawback, but not a serious one, IMHO.

>1. What SF RPGs existed before Traveller?

According to Lawrence Schick\'s HEROIC WORLDS, Flying Buffalo published a
SFRPG called "Starfaring" that came out a few months before Traveller. It
was based on the Tunnels and Trolls rules and was not a serious game, and
therefore virtually dissapeared from the market when Traveller (the first
REAL SFRPG) appeared. it is also possible (although I\'m not sure) that
"Metamorphisis Alpha" (a.k.a. "D&D in Space") might have come out before
Traveller, but I don\'t think so.

>2. What, in your opinion, makes Traveller special/different/unique as an SF
>RPG?

I would have to say that it combines a certain simplicity of game system (at
least in it\'s best incarnations) with the sweep and grandeur of a classic
Science Fiction setting. When I think of science fiction, the first thing
that comes to my mind is not cyberpunk or \'dark future\' settings. It\'s
Asimov, Pournelle, Niven, Vance, Van Vogt, and all the authors of the late
60\'s-early 70\'s SF that Traveller is based on. A fundamentally OPTIMISTIC
viewpoint, but one that doesn\'t gloss over problems the way Star Trek often
does.

Well...he has made a difference to the personal histories of a few thousand
Terrans, but I would have to say on a worldwide basis, not really. But
that\'s ok; I\'d rather have the satisfaction of knowing I\'ve brought hours of
enjoyment to a few thousand people than to be President or some such thing.
        Now if Traveller ever makes the big or small screen and becomes a
huge hit, that might be different...can you imagine how bizzare it would be
for us long-time Traveller fans to walk into a Wal-Mart and see a Vargr
action figure??

The reason for using D6 is that everybody got them, their propability
curves are well known and if used in pairs they\'re nicely "bell shaped".
Using 2D10 would be OK as well but to no real gain. You\'ll want a "bell
curve" \'coz you\'ll cover low propabilities at the ends and still have a
realtively narrow spread in the middle which is a GOOD THING. We want small
numbers to play with to ease playability. The reason we get these funny
dice and large target numbers is that the designers don\'t know propability
and are generally inexperienced in game system design. One of the few
really good system designers around was Frank Chadwick and one of the
coolest systems he made was Space 1889

For that Allen guy who considered those wanting only D6 to be old
nostalgics comparable to AD&D players lighten up. The old 70\' and 80\' games
used D100, D20 et c (like AD&D) but modern games (like them or not) use D6
like Warhammer, StarWars et c.

Skills levels should normally compleately describe how good a character is
in that skill.
Characteristics should govern how easy it is for the guy to improve his
skills and also his abilities when unskilled. There should be no auto
success, auto failures regardless of skill and task difficulty. The MOST
important aspect of a task system is its descriptive nature:
If a task is "Difficult" then an average guy in that skill should have a
difficult time succeeding. This makes it easier for the players to play
without knowing the rules.
GM should tell the players what they see, hear etc, the players will tell
the GM what they want to do and the GM translates that into task rolls et
c. The only thing players need to know is the gaming universe. Period.

Intersteller transport of ores makes as much sense as the US policy of
exporting raw logs and then buying back the finished wood products.
Seriously tho\', it would depend on the labor costs.  If you are mining a
insidious or corrosive atmospheric world, the cost per ton to ship ore may
be lower than the cost to process it on that world.  It would also be an
effective way to keep a type 6 government (captive) in check, by not
giving the world any means to be self sufficient.

I used a spreadsheet, but it was pretty much just using it instead of a
calculator...all the calculators in my house always seem to be dead..I
have been known to fire up the Mac, just to use the calculator DA.

I can post it, but there\'s nothing much to it...you enter all the values
by hand, and I set aside a multiplier column for each thing that has
multiples, like staterooms and workstations, but otherwise there isn\'t
much difference between that and using pencil and paper.

It\'s nice for doing multiple variants on the same design, but until I fix
it up a little, it\'s a pain to use for different designs, because there
are a lot of places for erros to creep in, by forgetting, for instance,
that a 5000 dt hull takes a different size jump drive than a 500 dt one.

Also using the \'spreadsheet as scratch paper\' is something I\'m really used
to doing, in fact building a structured sheet to handle all the
calculations, I would find a pain, and will let someone _else_ handle ;-)

    'body' => '        While futzing around with the HG-T4 Conversion System posted on
Kevin Walsh\'s "Free Trader Beowulf" site (an excellent site, by the way), I
noticed reference to missing information on the Meson Screen table in the
Standard Ship Design System. I looked this up and came up with some helpful
information. This has probably been covered in errata, but if it hasn\'t (and
since I have nothing else to do today except grow older), I thought I\'d
share my findings with all of you.
        First of all, if you look at the table, you will find the key to the
missing USD values. the first two columns are labelled "7" and "8 or 9".
These are references to the size factors of hulls; the numbers beneath them
are the PV\'s of the screens for those hulls. These numbers can be converted
to USD numbers using the table at the end of SSDS. HOWEVER there is a slight
error here. According to the way Meson Screens are built in FF&S, the first
column should be "Size 7 and 8" (for ships from 10 to 999 tons) and the
second column should be "Size 9" (for ships of 1000+ tons).

Here are the translated USD values for the meson screens for those who\'d
rather just be able to look them up:

TL      SIZE 7,8        SIZE 9
12      4               3
12      7               5

13      5               4
13      8               6
13      9               8

14      10              9
14      12              11

This may be of some use to the HG-T4 folks for figuring out how to convert
Meson Screens. However, I propose an easier way; simply find the conversion
for a Meson Gun of the same factor as the screen you want to convert. I
would presume that a Factor 9 screen would completely stop a Factor 9 gun at
optimum range, yes? if so, find the Very Short damage range number (the
first one in the sequence), which for a Factor 9 gun is 9 (conveinent, eh?)
and that\'s the strength of a Factor 9 Meson Screen! This also raises an
interesting point; the Meson Screens given in SSDS max out just shy of
Factor A in the HG-T4 conversion system. One would presume then that Factor
A might be the largest Meson Gun that can be mounted on a vessel of 5,000
tons. Is this true? Could be interesting to find out...

0.002 Cents into the debate.

I use a slightly modified version of the T4 task system in that target
numbers are calculated in the same manner (Attribute + Skill), and the
dice rolled in the same manner 2D, 2.5D, 3D, 3.5D and 4D.  Except I
treat any roll with a double number a failure, unless the double is less
than the skill used, eg skill 3 for a double 2 rolled.  The only
exception to this is a double 1 in the case of a average task (2D) which
is obviously a special success.

E.G.
Skill 4 Attribute 5 (good pilot, poor natural ability), target number =
9.
Skill 1 Attribute 8 (Basic training, above average ability), target
number also = 9.

On A roll of 2,3,3, normaly both pilots would succede under the T4
System, however under my system the pilot who received only basic
training would fail. 

I find this system has a number of advantages over the standard T4
system and a number of other proposed systems :-
a) It uses simple addition to calculate task target numbers (not that I
find division and multiplication difficult).
b) It gives full weight to the attribute, without detracting from the
value of the skill.  I agree with many others that the T4 and TNE
systems place too high a value on the attribute and not the skill.
c) It adds to an air of uncertanty ammongst the players, who is the
better pilot, the character with Dex 7 and Skill 4, or the character
with Dex B and Skill 1.  It\'s not easy for the players to work this out.
d) At low difficulties natural ability is more important, but at higher
difficulties skill becomes more important, which reflects real life in
my opinion.

Unfortunatly point c) does lead to the only drawback of this sytem,
which it is difficult for the GM to determine the diificulty of a task.
But I have found that with experience this does not become too tiresome.

There is also another point in that the system can result sometimes in
player frustration when they realize that the double 2 they have just
rolled is not a success, as they only have skill 1.  But as a GM I think
this a good thing (my players may disagree with me there however).

I have an idea. For spectacular success, _all_ dice need to be ones.
That\'s the obvious fix.

BTW, I think spectacular failure should be defined as:

If the player rolls greater than the target number and two of the dice
show sixes, *or* if _all the dice show sixes_, the task roll is a
spectacular failure.

While I agree that training is more important than natural talent in
most cases, I don\'t agree that the statement holds true in all cases.
Though I admire Ken\'s task fix, I get the feeling if he had his way, no
nasty math would be required.

IMHO, his "fix" has some disadvantages (amittedly minor disadvantages,
but I think it\'s important to examine them critically, since Marc\'s
going through the trouble of completely redesigning the task system):

1. A 4:1 skill to talent ratio is too steep. That\'s just my feeling.
Many people would argue it isn\'t. Many would agree that it is. I think
2:1 would be better. Average stats range from 2-12. Average skills from
1-6. Two times six is twelve. You get the idea. That would put Skills
and Attributes on equal footing.

2. Every point in an attribute doesn\'t count. Admittedly, Ken\'s system
is better than MT\'s task system in this regard. But I think that +1 EDU
should always increase your chances to succeed.

3. Division is icky. Hey, I can divide numbers less than 16 in my head
as well as the next guy, but you have to decide to round up or down, and
studies have proven that of basic arithmetic funcitons, it is the
slowest that the average person performs in his head. Ken himself has
mentioned that the ideal task system would require only addition.

4. Attributes change due to damage, and that aggrevates the pain of the
extra division calculation. 

I\'m quite pleased that Marc is taking the time to redo the Task system
the way it should have been done in the first place. For the first time,
I\'m actually considering plunking down another 50 bucks on the new
"deluxe" rulebook.

If I had my way, target number would be ATTR + (SKILL-1)*2, but
Skill:Attribute disparity can be dealt with in more ways than messing
with the target number, and dealing with extra math. Some ways I can
think of:

- - Reducing difficulty of task for highly skilled characters.
- - Letting the skilled reroll a number of dice equal to their skill
level/2 (round down)
- - Letting the skilled reduce any natural six by their skill level.
- - (variation) Let the skilled subtract from natural one and two\'s points
equal to their skill level.
- - (variation) If any dice rolled are three or less, and add up to the
player\'s skill level, they are eliminated (reduce to zero).
- - Let the skilled replace a number of D6\'s with d3\'s equal to their
skill level/2 (kidding)

Just brainstorming...

PS. I\'m not gonna be the one to do the statistical analysis on my above
suggestions. ;-)

Trent, I totally agree with your comments. I\'m willing to live with the
half die, but I\'d rather live without it. And skills outweighing
attributes is a matter of taste, but of course has a great bearing on
the "feel" of the game. I think that any extra step in target number
calculation should be optional.

since this task thing has come up again and I have found both
the official T4 task system and KB1.1 lacking.  Here is my take
on a T4-like task system that IMHO produces a good range of
probabilities at various diff levels AND weights Charicteristics
and Skills without requiring the Math of KB 1.1 (I know it\'s easy
but some of my players find it hard in the heat of the moment).

Goals are
- - eliminate 1/2 dice
- - eliminate extra math of KB1.1(note I think that attribute mods
can be pre-calculated + written on char sheet)
- - reduce chances of success over T4 system
- - make skills count for more than characteristics in task checks

Target number = Skill + (Attribute/2)

note that attrib/2 can be written on char sheet.

Thus an average, skilled character has att 7 + Skill 3 = target 7
PCs are likely to have higher target numbers

Dice rolled for difficulty are:
Easy - no roll for skilled char
Average - 1D6
Difficult - 2D6
Formidible - 3D6
Staggering - 4D6
"Impossible" - 5D6

Unskilled PCs must increase the diff of all tasks by 1 level
Note that a skilled and/or talented PC will not have to roll for
many average tasks.

I have not discussed crit success/failure as the various options
being discussed all make sense.  Time etc should also be 
considered but I think everone is on the same track here.

I think that this nicely solves the Skill vs Attribute problem
without the need to multiply skill x2.  Note that the table 
assumes a max skill 12, this seems reasonable given the T4
char gen system.  Skill levels have definitely been devalued
in T4 but this is not a bad thing as CT characters had too few
skills.  I think the broken thing in T4 is stating that a doctor
is min skill 3 when the levels available to PCs are much greater
this should be changed to Doctor at 4 or 5 (I think).

Anyway I\'m throwing this to the wolves, use it if you wish, dump it
otherwise ;-)

Well, it always has been -- food processing is the foundation of Vilani culture, after

Obviously I didn\'t type the qualifying statement "SOME people" in big enough

Seriously, I have NO PROBLEM with people who prefer d6\'s for aesthetic
reasons. My favorite game system apart from Traveller is GURPS, which uses
nothing but d6\'s! My admittedly sarcastic response to Harold\'s post was
aimed at those FEW (please not the qualifier FEW) whose adherence to d6\'s
and loathing hatred for the d3 is based on an unwillingness to accept
change. (By the way, WW\'s storyteller system is a modern system and it uses
d10\'s.)

contest, though I think it just shows how nice the original design from CT
is (my version was really just a tweeked copy).  Thanks to all those kind
folks that gave my design the nod.  Economics were clearly not this
design\'s strong suite, but I thought there should be toys on board for the
characters to play with.

  Since I was moving to a new house this week, I didn\'t have a chance to
vote on the other designs, but I think the more interesting concepts did
well.  I\'m glad those passenger busses didn\'t do well - I played with a
few of those in the initial stages of my design process, but after looking
at the passenger tables in the rulebook, rejected them out of hand.  Other
than that, I liked most of the designs.

  My personal favorite was the 300T J3 ship - I think this has some real
possibilities as player ship, though it does create problems for the GM
since the players have more choices about where to go (Free Traders are
great that way!).  I think it would look good with the demountable tanks -
have to take a closer look with that.

  What I plan to do is to go through the various designs and see if I can
come up with a superiour version that combines the best of all of them, or
maybe two or three versions (Generica builds lots of different ships,
after all).

  As for how I do the designs, I just pencil and paper it.  It\'s easy with
QSDS - The first one or two took a bit longer, but now it\'s as easy as
Book 2 used to be (at least that\'s the way it seems).  I use a calculator
to add up power and cost at the end, but otherwise am computer-free.

Right. RUN down to your local bookstore, spend your lunch money, sell
blood, whatever it takes . . . . But get a copy of _Starship Troopers_,
and read it. NOW.

Figures. If the movie reflects the typical Hollywierd view of the
military, then she should sue the bastards. Problem: when you sell movie
rights, you also sell a certain amount of creative control. "Ginnie" may
not have a legal leg to stand on, dash the luck.

I have a related question. In MT, each form of locomotion has a damage
factor
associated with it. For example, a ship might have a jump of 3 and a
damage
factor of 30/60.  

In the Starship Combat rules, each "jump-1" hit reduces the jump drive
by
one UCP factor. Where does the damage factor come into play? The
existing rules
say that, after the first hit, my jump drive is now jump-2. When does
the 
"30/60" tally start getting used up?

They are not always easy to find. You can always go to Fred Meyers or
Target and find d6\'s in 5-packs. Also, almost all kid\'s games have d6\'s, so
they are often around the house. Most mini\'s wargamers also have scads of
6\'s around. 6\'s are cheap, plentiful, and socially acceptable except in
millitary training areas.

We\'re not in japan, Harold... ;-) Seriously, though, d10\'s are the second
most common nowadays, courtesy of WWG, whose systems are d10 based. And the
Japanese use d10\'s for militarynsimulations. so I don\'t see why the strong
aversion, but the simple availability, familiarity, and prevalence of d6 is
probably a good bet for games not boxed with dice.

The design is economically unfeasible only if the Passenger Table is
considered to be the only way to get passengers.  You don\'t seriously believe
this do you?  

The Passenger Table wasn\'t mentioned as a design consideration.  I assumed
that the considerations for economic feasibility were what was mention in the
listing of economic information.  Similarly, despite the requirement for
Rescue Balls for ships licensed to carry passengers in the Imperium, I
assumed that this could be ignored since it wasn\'t mention as a design
consideration.

>Notes: The prime ship is awful - the second variant is much better,
>although costly.

I had though part of the propose of THUDDD was get some innovative designs
created.  With that in mind, I think that you are being very unfair in
calling my design awful.  I feel that it met the mission requirements,
despite it not being what is usually considered a far trader, which is why I
included a trader version of the ship.  Now, the reason the trader is costly
because it mounts a laser and an addition power plant, features that the
stereotypical player characters\' ship will have.  

BTW what is BudgetLines?  It sounds like a starliner company that I\'m not
familiar with.

	All tasks are based upon a professional level of skill, level 3, and

The labels:
	Easy: for some one of professional skill, very much so

	Difficult: Gives pro\'s a bit of pause, but they can do it by the

	Impossible: Even a pro cannot do it (19+, with DM+4, is still 15+),

Under MWM and KB\'s systems, almost anyone with any skill can still pull of
the impossible, even though MT/TNE Impossible is now Staggering, and
Impossible is a level harder.

Looking at Impossible, 6d vs asset, it is still possible for someone to do
it with Att 4, skill 2 under both systems (not bloody likely), but doable.
THIS IS WRONG!!! they don\'t meet the "professional" levels of MT, let
alone, accounting for the increased average skill level in primary field
under T4, meet the level 4 I consider proffessional in t4 (even though no
definitions exist as such past CT other than for MD\'s and Surgeons).

The definitions of the difficulties need to be re-worked.

Impossible SHOULD MEAN that it is beyond the abilities of the average
professional, or tasks should be re-defined so that it is explicit for WHAT
LEVEL of ability the Routine task is routine. (Heck, I had players making
4+ dice tasks under T4 without SKILL.)

BTW, Jack-o-t is WAY to powerfull under t4.

How many people would the Airforce train to be a pilot with a  dex-6 (below
av). Not to many I would think. 

Who makes the better car driver? Someone with low dex(poor reflex) or
someone with high dex(good reflex)......

Now someone with a poor dex might eventually make a good pilot or car
driver, but in the process their dex would have increased(faster reflexes etc)


The same goes for all the other skills. people with high int make better
scientists. People with low int don\'t become scientists.etc etc 

Well thats my rant & flag waving.

My situation is much like Bruce\'s, the spreadsheet that I made for THUDDD 
was the first I\'ve ever done (and I\'m scared to say, almost as much fun as
making the ship... Oh, No! I"ve been infected with GEARHEADITIS! <g>)

It\'s really a very basic sheet that works really well for variants of one
ship. Cal-
culations are set up to figure out salaries, monthly costs and such, but most
values of ship componenets are entered by hand and it really just saves my
having to crunch all the numbers by hand. However, it was my first, it was fun
to do, and there\'s another THUDDD on, so try, try again! <G>

Who thinks that Dex would be the most important skill for a pilot in
traveller times?  Int would make more sense to me.  With the
exception of flying a fighter in atmosphere, dex wouldn\'t play much
role at all IMHO.  A trader will reenter and fly to within a few
klicks of the starport under computer control (it would now, for
that matter).

In space (in orbit, in particular) things are less intuitive than
you might think and Int would dominate pilot skill.  It\'s a problem
solving thing, not a dexterity thing.

At 100km/s if you count on your reflexes you\'re dead anyway.

Atmospheric piloting should be a different skill.  Are the skills
the same to take a cube root now (*with* your calculator) as they
were in the days of slide rules?  Doing it by tables?

I guess I see pilots more in a Heinlein/Clarke sense than in the Han
Solo sense.

     Okay, since we seem to have reached an impasse wherein with the current
range of target numbers we can\'t realistically do away with the half-die, and
with our current range of dice we can\'t weigh skills higher than attributes
without requiring in-game division, I think it\'s time we tried upping the whole
scale:

NOTE:  I never claimed to have particularly good math-sense (notice my last
post where I made a pretty big statistical error) and I haven\'t done any
feasability studies on this; I\'m just throwing out the ideas.

TARGET NUMBER= Attribute + (Skill*2) +/- DMs
     Skills would have to be limited to level-8 max, or thereabouts
     
DIFFICULTY TABLE
Easy/Simple       Auto (1D)
Average/Routine   2D
Difficult         3D
Formidable        4D
Staggering        6D
Near Impossible   8D

Has anybody else tried a similar system, and if so, what are the drawbacks?  I
can see two possible ones up-front: 1) Average tasks will be a cakewalk for
just about everybody, not just highly-skilled people; 2) Lots of dice and lots
of big DM numbers might scare people.
     I\'d like someone to come up with some numbers on this to see how well
probabilities work compared to characters with similar att/skill levels under
MT, T4, and KBv1.1 to see how it does (or doesn\'t) hold up.
     And, of course, Spectacular results would have to be changed again, but
that can be worried about later/separately.

	I have the first 24 issues of White Dwarf magazine, a UK role playing
magazine that is now under Games Workshop\'s banner.

	Metamorphosis Alpha was reviewed in the June / July 1977 issue, and
Traveller was not reviewed until the April / May issue of 1978, almost a
year later. So if those review dates are similar to the UK release dates,
then M Alpha had almost a year in the UK to itself. I reckon there\'s no
reason why those dates wouldn\'t be too dissimilar to the US ones.

	Btw, I love Traveller because a lot of things can be logically explained,
like the scientific side of it. After playing AD&D for years my brain hurts
because something mentioned has to be remembered more than figured out,
whereas in Traveller things can be worked through to so many different
conclusions and uses. Well, I could explain that better and more at length
but it\'s like 1.00 a.m. here and I\'m asleep ;-)

	Someone earlier also mentioned that many items in CSC have a lot of
background information, and while AD&D has this it just didn\'t seem to gel
as well. I don\'t mean to do any comparisons here, it\'s just that Traveller
has this smoothness of operation to it, despite the task problems.

	Anyway, why can\'t our characters be able to do impossible tasks more often
than the average guy? Okay, I know they have elevated skill and attribute
levels, but they have one extra thing, and it\'s that they are the ones that
the game universe revolves around. Couldn\'t these low impossible task
levels be down to the extra luck that a character enjoys?

	In sci-fi the heroes are always pulling off the impossible. What sort of
roll would Luke Skywalker have to make to swing across a retracted
drawbridge, with a woman in one hand, the rope in another, while being shot
at by supposedly trained Imperial Troopers that have the shooting accuracy
of the bad guys in the A-Team? Anyone? Okay, a minus for a moving target,
granted... And as for Han Solo\'s piloting thru\' that asteroid
field...wow...And I remember Marc Singer in "V" running out of a building,
and turning and firing in one movement at a target about fifty yards away
that he had barely glimpsed _in the dark_ and making the kill! Well, "V"
was a bit problematic I guess, or maybe the example doesn\'t quite fit, but
we\'re playing the heroes, and they can do all sorts of wierd and wonderful
things.

	See ya...

        Some of my friends and I had this email convo about the feasibility
of using StoryTeller to run a Trav campaign today...  Personally, I think
it would work extremely well; it\'s lean, mean, intuitive, and what\'s more,
produces increasing likelihoods of spectacular failures at the extreme high
end of the spectrum (nice for players going up against really bad bad guys,
and it keeps the powergamers down).  And conversion would be extremely
easy...

        Capsule version: stats and attributes are expressed  as dots along
a 1-5 scale (that can be exceeded by powerful NPCs or if you\'re a
munchkin).  1 d10 per dot is rolled on task rolls; if Vladimir Nastikov has
stat: **** and skill: ****, he has a dice pool of 8 dice.  Target numbers
range from 2 (dirt easy) to 10 (bloody difficult).  A die roll equal to or
higher than its target number is called a "success".  Depending on the
task, one success can be plenty; for more complex or difficult tasks, three
successes are required for full success.  More result in a spectacular
success.

        Target number can be determined by a) GM diktat, b) opposing
character\'s stat, c) weapons rules.  And the die pool can be split; let\'s
say Vladimir is trying to whack Bob Victim with a 2X4 (diff 4, so he has a
70% chance of success of rolling it or higher on a single d10); he can make
either 1 attempt using all his dice pool (giving him virtually assured
success), 2 using half his die pool giving him a reasonable chance of
making two damage rolls, and so forth.  So the higher the stat and/or
skill, the higher the chance of success or the more chances at succeeding.

        Opposing rolls can be made, say in this case Bob Victim\'s Dex and
Dodge vs Vladimir\'s Dex and Melee...  Obviously, if Bob only has Dex:***
and Dodge:**, and Vladimir has Dex:**** Melee:***, Vladimir is likely to
whack Bob, especially as target number for melee attacks is 4 and for
dodging is 6.  However, if Bob has a knife in his hand and Melee:**, he can
choose to spend three dice on dodging Vladimir\'s first swing, and two dice
on slashing him.  Vladimir could likewise use some dice to Dodge too...

        Extended tasks can be handled by requiring the player to hit an
arbitrary number of successes (i.e. d10 rolling target or higher), at an
arbitrary number of units of time per roll of his full die pool.
Cooperative tasks of this sort can have both characters combinging their
successes.  And injury subtracts dice from their pools.

        Rolls of 1 subtract successes... and if you get more 1\'s than
successes, you\'ve "Botched", i.e. achieved a critical failure.  Rolls of 10
are successes, and what\'s more, permit you to re-roll that die in an
attempt to get further successes

        Personally, and here I will don my TL-21 vampire, flame, and
frac-cee rock proof jammies, I think it\'s superior to both the MT and T4
systems.  If a major revision of the task system is in the works, rather
than tweak an old and somewhat inelegant (I mean, d3\'s?) d6 based system,
Marc might do well to look at what White Wolf has been using... after all,
it\'s only the task system for the hottest-selling RPGs in recent years.
While task system isn\'t everything, it sure doesn\'t hurt repeat sales...
While Marc couldn\'t rip it off, he might be able to get some ideas for
streamlining out of it.

Fuel for Jump 3
Cargo = 80**
Crew= 13, Troops= 31***, High Passengers (Owner/Company Rep)= 1

Command= 2 (Captain, Troop Commander), Engineer= 5, Navigator= 1
Gunner= 4, Medical=1 (3 medics are included in ship\'s troops)

Sick Bay with 4 beds; Surgical suite


Armament:
   4x Triple Laser Turret
   4x Triple Missile Turrets

Ship\'s Vehicles:
   2x 50T Modular Cutters
        2 modules are carried on board, 2 more attached to cutters****
   1x Air Raft


* In T4 terms.  According to the description, it\'s unstreamlined, but can
  scoop fuel and land on vac planets due to lack of external projections.
** This is in addition to the 60 tons used for cutter module storage.
   There are two bays of 18 tons and three smaller ones of 8 tons for
   general cargo space, as well as an "Armory" that looks to be about 8
   tons. There is also a 2 ton "Secure Vault" for "pilferable items,
   novelties, drugs, weapons and ammunition, alcohol, and radioactives."
   I can\'t find the other 10 tons of cargo space on the deck plans.
*** Most are housed in the equivalent of small staterooms.
**** There are 8 standard modules available:
	1) ATV Cradle: Holds one ATV
	2) Personel Transport: Seats for up to 60 people
	3) Cargo: 25 tons, plus 10 passenger seats
	4) Fuel Skimmer: Holds 28 tons of fuel
	5) Assault module: Holds 16 troops in 2 sections; module digs
		holes for the troops to hide in (really!).
	6) Preasurized Shelter: Living Quarters for 8 persons
	7) Weapons module: Holds weapon for orbital fire support
	8) Fighter Frame: Holds 4 six ton fighters
   
    The Broadsword comes with one each of 1 (containing an ATV), 3,
   5, and 8 (containing 4 fighters).  The above price reflects these
   included modules.

COMMENTS:  
  In space combat, this ship is well armed compared to
the average CT merchant ship.  My players would have loved to get their
hands on this much firepower!  Then again, I ran a low-power campaign.
Compared to your average Navy ship, the Broadsword is not that tough,
especially in its basic form w/o armor.  Ideally, it operates in a low
threat environment - if serious warships show up, it\'s time to haul ass.
  The price should give us some idea of what "affordable" means in this
context.
  This ship cannot be built using QSDS 1.4 (I tried).  The two modular
cutters can\'t fit inside, and there isn\'t enough space outside to strap
them on.  In the CT version, the cutters stick out the back of the ship; I
guess one could fudge things by using a smaller than required hanger bay.
I\'m going to try again using QSDS 1.5 - I\'ll post the result in a few
days.

In MT the 30/60 is only used in vehicle combat, say a tank fires at your
starship.  You also have to multiply all the numbers by 10 or that tank is
pretty deadly to your starship.  Once you multiply them by 10 though your
starship is pretty much immune (for short periods) to anything short of
starship weapons (surprise!).

On the other hand take your average groundcar. It has a hull value of \'1/2\'
and if you don\'t use the x10 multiplier is made inoperative by ANY bullet
that penetrates. Use the x10 multiplier and it has a hull value of 10/20
and only a +8 success will render it inoperative in one hit - more
realistic IMHO.  It also has the locomotion and power plant damage factors
which all come into play in vehicle combat.

In short for starships the numbers are quite useless.  For vehicles they
make a lot of sense.

But are all olympic skaters also the best fencers, sharpshooters, starship
pilots, race car drivers, and etc.? Because that\'s what the T4 task system
makes them. Frankly, I have no opinion on the \'nature vs. nurture\' debate,
the only thing I am arguing about is a role-playing game. I play them to
have fun, and the existing task system is not fun.

Because the typical character has much higher numbers for attributes than
for skills, and since attributes get used a lot more often than skills, the
effect is that characters are defined by their attributes, not skills.
Characters who happened to have made one good roll generating attributes
are able to do practically any task at all based on the same attribute,
even an \'impossible\' task with negative modifiers, while having only a
skill of 1. As a GM, this is not fun; I have no way to gauge the difficulty
of tasks or tailor tasks for specific characters. It is also very boring;
character tend to fall into Edu-class, Int-class, or Dex-class; whose
members are effectively interchangable.

It\'s not fun for players, either. The player who made one bad roll at
character generation will never be able to recover, he or she will sit out
the rest of the campaign fuming as the one or two \'star\' characters do
everything, or keep rerolling until he or she gets a \'star\' also, or just
drop out. It doesn\'t matter what your skills or history are, a character
with 15 Edu (absurdly easy to get, by the way) will just blow you away at
everything unless you manage to get your skill level up to 20 or so (which
doesn\'t happen in my campaign). Even the high-attribute characters get
ripped off; because they are expert in everything they have no
individuality and are boring to play.

Do I like rolling 1/2 dice and doing arithmetic for every task roll? No.
But I like playing an RPG which ties the hands of the GM and bores the
players even less. I mean no disrespect to IG or Marc Miller, but priority
1 has got to be to make the game fun and enjoyable.

	Really? To me Traveller is a SCIENCE fiction game, as opposed to "Space
Fantasy." The specific mechanics weren\'t the primary attraction, it was the
feel. Each incarnation of the Traveller rules tried to pay at least passing
notice to reality. Not that I don\'t like fantasy RPGing. But when I play
fantasy, I prefer not to try to disguise it by abusing the SF label. But
then I\'ve long since come to the conclusion that I\'m Not Like Anybody Else.

	Agreed, the d20 gagged me when I first opened my TNE box, but instead of
immediately trying to bash it out, I tried using it. I really came to like
it, although I modified the task system. While I\'m rooting for Marc\'s T4.5
or whatever it\'ll be, right now I\'m sticking with TNE rules (bashed to my
own taste, but then who plays stock rules?).

	Second to the "verisimilitude" of Traveller is the setting. Frankly, I
could care less about d3/d4/d6/d8/d12/d20/d36/d100. All I want is to be
able to use ONE kind of die for 99% of my rolls as a referee, and all of my
rolls as a player.

	And can somebody explain to me why a "bell-shaped probability curve" is
the One True Way? Seriously, folks, you can\'t even justify any of the
probabilities for any of the tasks based on reality, other than handwaving
and "it feels right." I\'m sitting here with a handgun. Can you tell me what
my true chances of hitting my front door are? Or even define what "true
chance" means? It\'s a game. Some people like bell-shaped curves for
aesthetic reasons, some can live with or without them. As long as things
that to me fall into a hierarchy of difficulty in real life fall in the
same order in the game, and the general feel seems right, more power to you.

	Oh, and I agree with those who want a task system that gives SOME tilt
towards skills vs. attributes. For those of you heretical baby-sacrificing,
devil worshipping, pot-smoking, wife-beating, tax-cheating, wrong-headed
TNE weirdos who agree, I\'ve got my modified system posted on my Web site.

Yes, I\'ve tried it with my game group.  We converted from TNE to T4 (same
era, new rules) about a month ago (haven\'t been able to play since then)
and decided to use your system instead of the T4 system.  I added one minor
modification, though.  Instead of rolling two dice, we use three - one red
(the "tens" die), one black (the "ones" die) and a white one which is only
used to score for criticals.  Any result of triples is a critical result,
and success or failure depends on what target number was needed.  Of
course, a result of 1-1-1 automatically succeeds and a roll of 6-6-6
(oooooooh, scary) automatically fails.

Anyway, the system worked pretty well.  There are four PCs in the party,
three of whom are well educated, technical specialist types and one who is
a "jack of all trades, master of none" sort.  Some representative skills
and attribs:

		  High Stat & Skill		Low Stat & Skill		
	PC 1:  Dex-11, Pilot-8		Str-6, Brawling-2
	PC 2:  Edu-12, Computer-5	Str-8, Brawling-2
	PC 3:  Dex-10, Brawling-5	Edu-9, Metallurgy-1
	PC 4:  Edu-13, Engineering-9	Soc-8, Carousing-1

I realize the high skill levels are a bit excessive in two cases, but we
couldn\'t settle on a reasonable conversion from TNE to T4, so we left them
"as is."  This way, they make really good examples of extremes.  Anyway.

PC 1 gets a bonus of (Dex-7)+16 = +20 (+32 base 6) to his highest skill and
(Str-7)+4 = +3 (+3 base 6) to his lowest skill.

PC 2 gets (Edu-7)+10 = +15 (+23 base 6) to her highest and (Str-7)+4 = +5
to her lowest.

PC 3 gets (Dex-7)+10 = +13 (+21 base 6) to his highest and (Edu-7)+2 = +3
to his lowest.

PC 4 gets (Edu-7)+18 = +24 (+40 base 6) to her highest and (Soc-7)+2 = +3
to her lowest.

On the whole, we found the system to be very well weighted.  The emphasis
on skills seems at first to be a bit heavy when you consider case #4, but
anyone with that combination of skill and stat really should have no excuse
for failure.   
After all, this produces a base target number distribution that looks like
this:
	Easy:		66- (65-)
	Routine:		66- (65-)
	Difficult:	66- (65-)
	Formidable:	66- (65-)
	Staggering:	56-
	Impossible:	46-
Truly an Engineering Goddess.
In more reasonable situations, the system worked very well.  For example,
take case #4, lowest:
	Easy:		63-
	Routine:		53-
	Difficult:	43-
	Formidable:	33-
	Staggering:	23-
	Impossible:	13-
I leave it to others to calculate the actual probabilities.

Anyway, we were very satisfied with the 2D task system (3D? whatever...)
and I intend to use it in any games I run in the future.

But at least they get more than one shot off before they bite it.  They\'d
also overwhelm the Starfleet Redshirts with sheer numbers.  Don\'t forget
also, the Stormtroopers shoot better when they\'re aiming at bit characters
than when they\'re shooting at heroes.

assassination purposes.

And yet, photon torpedoes can\'t seem to do more than short out the bridge

Two kisses in two seperate movies do not an incestuous relationship make,
or even a potential one - this ridiculous point has been argued numerous
times.  Luke NEVER slept with Leia.  He never even got close.  Besides,
considering how many women Kirk has slept with over the years, how do we

It\'s a location thing - Solo doesn\'t NEED to find Earth.  Picard does.

time some Starfleet bureaucrat files the wrong paperwork and sells the Sol
system to the Dominion or something.

Thanks for the timely response! Your explanation makes things more

Hey, I agree with you!  That\'s why I argue in favor of increases in skills
being based on aptitude for that skill.  I\'d *like* to have skills increase
by a variable amount based on naturally how good a character would be in
that area.  THAT\'S how I\'d like to tie Attributes to Skills.  I don\'t seem
to have many takers though. <g>

My simple version is to give each skill an Aptitude of -1, 0, or 1 (roll
1d3-2), and increase skill points by 1d3+Aptitude.  This has the advantage
of not having a high EDU Attribute make a character exceptional at *dozens*
of skills just because of the EDU.

Another version is to have each skill tied to a controlling
Attribute, and use the table:

 Attribute  Aptitude     [The only problem with this is
 ====================     *somebody* has to come up with
    1-5       -1          what the controlling Attribute
    6-9        0          for each Skill is, and publish
    10+       +1          the list.]
    
And increase skill points by 1d3+Aptitude! <g>

With either version, during game play, I\'d add the
Skill+Attribute=Target_Number. the Attribute wouldn\'t have to be the
controlling Attribute, just one appropriate for the task.

I also use 1/2/3/4/5/6 dice...and I might add 7d, oh and 3d is average not
2d in my system.

   To me Traveller is not about what dice you use, but it is a way to
role-play, with a well defined setting that has a highly detailed
background--even if that setting and/or background was created by a
referee and not by GDW.

   So it\'s not so much what you\'re used to, but how flexible you are in
your thinking...dangerous thoughts for some.

   This may have been true c.1980, but dice with more than 6 sides have
been widely available for a number of years now.  Of course you might
have to lower yourself and be seen actually entering a *gamestore* (one
of those places all those darn kids hang out in), but even that\'s no
longer a barrier with the Internet in place and companies taking phone
orders.

   No, I\'m hearing strong *emotional* arguments for D6, but no *logical*
ones.  Can it be that there aren\'t any?

True. 

KBv1.1 was designed to fix the T4 problems--not create a new system.

Now that Marc has opened the door to improving the task system, it 
has allowed me to think in another direction.

I have an idea that would eliminate the math, get rid of the half 
die, and still provide good numbers while making skills more 
important to the target number.

Sound impossible?  Well, I might have just made my throw.

Well see as soon as I run some analysis.

If it works, I\'ll call it KBv2.0, and we\'ll take Marc by storm with 
it.

Wish me luck.

Maybe not.  I\'ve got an idea--a good idea--that may let us have our 
cake and eat it too.

It\'s a prototype for KBv2.0, and the goals are:

	1) Leveling the field between attributes and skills--like KBv1.1.

	2) Reducing the "math" step to something even more simple, like the 
	addition in the original T4 system.

	3) Getting rid of those pesky little half die.

	4) Keeping the harder difficulty levels hard.

I hope like hell I can pull this off.  It seems to be what we all 
want.  I\'ll let you in on KBv2.0 after I run some numbers/do some 
analysis.

When a character is wounded, you still have to re-divide your new 
stat level and add it to your skill level.

This doesn\'t improve upon KBv1.1, it does the same thing as KBv1.1.

Check out the numbers you posted.  1D6 for 
Average skills is WAY too easy.

Heck, for a character with only Stat-7, Skill-1, your target number 
is 7 (or 8, depending on which way you round).

That means that a character with an average stat and the lowest skill 
possible will ALWAYS succeed at Average tasks (unless he rolls SF, if 
you use that).

Certainly, this is flawed and definitely not better than KBv1.1 for 
both reasons.

One thing to point out.  The KBv1.1 task system does not reduce the 
weight of the attribute to a small component of the target number.

On the contrary, the KBv1.1 system only boosts the skill level to 
weigh about as much as the attribute.

It seems that there is a debate forming over attribute vs skill 
importance to the target number.

In KBv1.1, they are both important.  In T4, skill has a relativly low 
importance to the target number (and, thus, the success chance of the 
throw), and the attribute is all important.

Check out what I mean--

Here\'s Perry:  Str-7;  Brawling-3

Under T4, the target number is 10.  Under KBv1.1, the target number 
is also 10.

But the difference is, under T4, 70% of the target number came from 
Perry\'s attribute, and only 30% of his target number, the primary 
statistic that determines his chance of success, comes from his skill 
and experience.

Under KBv1.1, the field is leveled somewhat.  40% of the target 
number comes from Perry\'s Str, while the other 60% of benefit is 
directly related to Perry\'s skill.

40% for the attribut contribution is no miniscule amount, and 
gaining expertise in a skill all of a sudden means something.

We who advocate more skill weight in the target number do not want to 
down play the role that natural ability plays.  We only want to see a 
person\'s skill and experience take its rightful place in determining 
that person\'s chance to succeed at tasks.

reasons why I like D6-only Traveller:

1) It\'s (almost) always been that way, dammit!

2) D6s are pretty-much the only type of dice ever used outside of rp 
   2a) so they\'re familiar to everyone.
   2b) so it\'s very easy to buy/find more

3) They\'ve got spots instead of numbers, which, admit it, is pretty neat

4) They\'re much easier to stack than D4s

5) If players get bored, they can play "Yahtzee!" (under T4) or Craps (CT/MT)

6) Since we only use one kind, we can refer to our D6 as D and act like we
don\'t know what other people are talking about when they act like there\'s more
than one shape of die (proving that we\'re better, of course)

7) (Related to #2, only applies to Jr-High kids): If your classmates see you
with a bunch of D10s and D20s, they\'ll think you\'re a geeky/scary D&D person,
if they see you with 2D6 you can fool \'em into thinking you shoot craps

8) I\'d like to come up with ten reasons, but I\'m out of ideas.  In reality,
there\'s absolutely no reason why Traveller can\'t use any kind of dice in
whatever way it wants to, except that "tradition" is a powerful force and games
DO tend to be associated with their rules, and a big part of that is the 
type-number of dice they use.  It\'s definitely a point of pride and 
identification among long-time (and non-heretical) Traveller players that "we 
don\'t need those damn funny-shaped dice!" even if, to obtain more user-friendly
probability curves and task rules, we possibly do.  Just consider it an Article
of Faith in the Traveller\'s Creed ("We believe in one die, with six sides and 
spots") and leave it at that.

It gives a decent feel for success/failure. Crit fail is mighty common at
high levels.

Reasons for Bell Curved distributions:

		probabilities.
	4.	they provide endless hours of fun trying to figure out where
		to put break points for difficulties.

Reasons why not to use them:
	1	they make figuring % chances somewhat more difficult
	2	they require 3 or more dice to be rolled.
	3	They make the weight of modifiers dependant upon origional
		target numbers.

CT and MT DO NOT use bell-cured distributions. They use a traingular
distribution; with mose of the same benefits and limitations.

9	****

11	**
12	*

with 3 d6, the norming tendancy holds nearly 50% of rolls to a narrow
range. (less than 1/3 distance from center), and with higher numbers of
dice, this tends to remain somewhat true (haven\'t got the tables handy on
my HD anymore). Looking In the old Bk 0: Introduction to Traveller: 3d6
rolls of 9-12 comprise (74-26=)48% of rolls; 7-15 comprises (91-9)=82%, and
4-17 gives 99% of all rolls.

This models (easily and accurately) expected performance parameters for
repetetive tasks by skilled individuals. 2d6 doesn\'t, but comes closer than
any straight-line (ie: 1d__) system can. Even D% and D66 are simply
straight line distributions.

The real world **tends** to express as skewed bell curves.

1st thing I was taught in Statistics: When in doubt, look for a bell curve;
it usually appears in any large sample.

I like Far Traders and merchant campaigns.  Trade and exploration games
are a whole lot more fun and interesting for me than "Travel to distant

games.  One ship-o-war-n-death has always seemed much like another to me.

Well, it mystified me too.

Here\'s another plan - what about the winner being decided on *just*
commercial feasibility - that way I could go from 15th place to FIRST!

Yes!  I knew I could win.  (Am I allowed a consolation biscuit?)



Seriously, though, reading through the THUDDD results last night I was a
little bit surprised.  I mean, I could understand my ship design being
\'broken\' (though I still can\'t understand where the mistake is), as it was
the first ship I ever actually finished.  (I\'m more a planet person
myself.)

However, there seemed to be a lot of other \'broken\' ships too judging from
the comments that voters made.  I haven\'t yet tried to "design" some of the
other entries to see what I can learn from them.

I can\'t believe that all those THUDDD entries were trying to cheat or
anything, it seems to me that there must be something wrong with the design
system if it\'s so difficult to come up with kosher designs even using QSDS
- - supposed to be quick and easy.  It would certainly seem that some of the
grey areas could benefit from being \'tidied up\' (crewing requirements and
hanger space for air/rafts spring to mind immediately).

I wonder if v.2 will address this?  If not, may I suggest Wildstar consider
it?  (And may I take this opportunity to thank Guy for the huge amount of
fun I\'ve had trying to build a Far Trader - I may even have another bash!)

Well, I already admitted that under such a system we\'d have to re-define the
Crit. rules, so that doesn\'t bother me.  I figure we get the basic success/fail
numbers taken care of first, then worry about the extra rules.  My guess,
though, is that under this progression, we\'d have to go back to a "Fail by N+" 
system for CritFails (like MT and TNE?), rather than the current 
"dice-counting" systems.

Many RPG\'s take the view that characters are the \'pick of the bunch\' and
there is something very special about them.  In AD+D the characters
(usually) walk tall, crush ordinary orcs beneath their boots and save the
world every other day.  In Star Wars characters can shoot 50 stormtroopers
before taking a scratch.

Traveller IMHO takes a different view.  The characters are just ordinary
joes (or bobs or janes or ... :) who get up to some pretty extraordinary
things (well it isn\'t very exciting to role-play your average imperial
bureaucrat doing his daily routine!).  The characters are still
fundamentally ordinary people - they may if they\'re lucky change the
balance of power in a subsector but they\'re not going to place Norris on
the throne of the Imperium no matter how hard they try.  This is why NPC\'s
are just as good as PC\'s, combat is deadly and Imperial Marines don\'t fire
wildly and miss.  In MY Traveller the characters aren\'t super-heroes, just
ordinary people in extra-ordinary situations.

YMMV of course.

	With lasers there used to be a safety rule-of-thumb, which was

	"1 kW continuous CO2 laser,

	 can damage human flesh up to 1 cm depth,
	 in 1 second."

	And, of course, kilowatt-range laser may cause eye damage or
	the "retinal detonation" very easily.

	Currently 5 W continuous laser are being used for laser surgery,
	and 5 W laser focused on 0.2 mm spot will cut ~1.4 mm deep wounds
	in single pass.

	A 50 kW pulse laser would be a highly lethal weapon (read
	"maximum overkill") if the 50 kW output power was release in a
	single 50 kJ/0.1 ns pulse. (That is, the laser fires one 50 kJ
	pulse every second, and energy is 	delivered in ~0.1 ns with
	~50 TW instant power.)

	The estimated armor penetration of a 50 kJ/50 TW laser beam
	depends on the penetration algorithm used, and it is quite
	difficult to estimate the extent of scabbing and spalling
	without conducting real-world experiments. However, at high

No, exactly what I wanted to know -- and its a bit frustrating to see that
IG *still* haven\'t got the message. You can\'t assume that people have every
previous publication there is. New players are going to take one look at
PBG and wonder what the hell it is!

I have a reasonable collection of Traveller stuff - right back to the
little black books - but it isn\'t in anything that *I* have seen before. So
it must be pretty obscure!

Subject: PRESS RELEASE for Aleria in Drakkar.

KEY WEST, FL, -Multi-Player Games Network (MPG-Net), a leader in online
multi-player games, announced today the release of Aleria, a new game
scenario for the popular Kingdom of Drakkar.

"We\'ve done some new things in Aleria, both technically and
philosophically, that we\'re quite excited about" said Michele Dipert,
Director of Marketing at MPG-Net. Aleria boasts a more intricate storyline,
with quests and game play that interrelates on many levels. Players will
spend many hours exploring the immense new land, searching the Duchy of
Carenna, Tower of Koss, Borav\'s Hold and the sylvan forests of Hemlock for
adventure and fortune. 

Aleria is the first Drakkar scenario created specifically to work with the
new Drakkar interface, which was released into beta in November of 1996. New
features include a graphical interface driven by customizable macro buttons, 
a more intuitive screen layout, new graphics in new areas like Aleria, a
scrollable text window and other features designed to enhance the play of
Drakkar.

For beginning players, the Kingdom of Drakkar is a world full of creatures
to kill and wealth to gain, often with the help of other players. As
characters increases in skill and experience, they venture further afar into
the uncharted and continually changing realms of Drakkar, alone or joining
other hardy adventurers to tackle the legendary creatures of Drakkar and
their untold riches. 

Win 95 users can download the MPG-Net current roster of games, including
Aleria directly from the Internet web site at http://www.mpgn.com. Also on
the web site are interface tours, game profiles, game manuals and other user
resources. Online products include the fantasy role-playing Kingdom of
Drakkar--"You\'ll find Drakkar seriously addictive," (Michael Goodwin,
Reviewer, PC World). Subscribers can also play space strategy game Imperium,
classic war game Operation Market-Garden, railroad-tycoon game Empire
Builder, the cyberpunkish Minion Hunter, Backgammon and more. Other online
features include email, chat rooms, and forums. Prices are $4.95 for the
first month and $9.95 a month thereafter. To order the software via CD,

First; all characteristics was optimised at 5, 10, 15 and the poor chaps
with 14 in INT was just as smart as those with 10. Secondly; secret tasks
had totally different propabilities of success and also had another set of
results. Third; exceptional results were more common than normal, a clear
break of my Verbal compatability rule: "All named gametokens should
correspond to real world tokens of the same name". Fourth; 2 were always a
failure and 12 was always a success which are really bad. Fifth; time
duration for tasks were rolled up as the task was attempted (I know there
were absolute timed tasks) which leads to relativistic paradoxes like; I
try to open the hatch before with hit the mountain. OK roll your task, you
suceeded, roll time, you failed, what does this actually mean? MT had a lot
of flaws but was definately the best task system devised for Traveller
(except for my own of course ;) as it didn\'t have stupid AD&D type of dice
and didn\'t use even more stupid D3s!

I think we may have a dilemma here: the mental-physical dichotomy has
reared its ugly head.  I will posit that physical stats are MORE IMPORTANT
than skill for most any type of athletic activity, but that for
"professional" type skills -- FoEx, an MD -- the skill MAY be more
important.

The problem lies in the examples chosen to promote a given task system. 
Marc, and I, were probably thinking in terms of physical activities, whilst
Dr. Vince has been brooding over the state of the medical profession.

At last!  A reason why those #@$% EDU bonuses are so high!!!  Ah-ha.  There
was a method to the madness...  That +4 for college was there to put MDs
and educated folk up into the same probability range in which Emmitt Smith
might live, in different realms, of course.  It should be easier to develop
EDU than to develop thighs as large as my torso, I think.

GM

I still have to agree here.  The one part of Traveller I\'ve never liked is
the EDU and SOC stats: I don\'t think that they measure on the same scale as
the others...  Case in point is the psionic assault rules -- why in
Yaskodray\'s name would a psionic assault lower SOC, or EDU?  It would
definitely take some canon destruction and hand waving to change those
stats to something more comparable to STR, DEX, END, INT, and PSI, but...

> philosophy, I\'d rather reward the skill than the stat. Under the KB
system,
> skill is primary, and training (enough of it) can overcome a low stat.

I will argue, again, that someone will not have training without at least
an average or higher stat in an area...  Would an MD really ever be
produced with an EDU of lower than 7?  Or Yaskodray forbid, an INT lower
than 7?  Yikes!  Where\'s my pan-galactic, Imperial-sanctioned malpractice
attorney?!

Why?  I\'ve known -- been subjected to -- some pretty crummy MDs in my time.
 I\'m deaf in one ear because some "nimble" fingers snipped when he should
have snapped during surgery!  Not everyone graduates even near the top of
the class...  Obviously.  I\'m living proof!  And I\'m sure that my native
INT and EDU are much higher than those poor, studying geeks in my class: I
must\'ve just failed my "matriculation" roll, or something.

My advice to budding characters:  If you don\'t have the natural ability for
something that you really wish you could do, then do something you have
talent for!  (Funny, that sounds like the same advice I give high school
students in Real Life(tm)...  In gen-X parlance, that is "Don\'t do
something you suck at.")

This is a good example, BUT as a referee it is YOUR job to say "Yeah, you
have a med-1, but you have absolutely NO CLUE about how to use the
phlembobulator.  Sorry.  I guess old yeller is a goner."  ;-)  I think that
Marc\'s task system is being stretched tooooooo @#$& far to both tails of
the curve -- without careful calculation, both tails of the curves CANNOT
be satisfied!!!  There are going to be outliers regardless.  Especially
with d6!

We love the new T4 task rules because they\'re SIMPLE and EASY.  Let\'s not
get carried away with ourselves and probability.  (I have to do enough Real
World(tm) statistics in class.  "What do you mean I need proof for my
theory that public schools couldn\'t educate Einstein?  They couldn\'t! 
That\'s fact!  It\'s my THEORY.  Oh, yes, Dr. Murphy, I do want my Ph.D.
someday.  Yes, I want to be published.  Yes, I\'ll find some shred of proof.
 Uh, sir."  ;-P )

Hey, I said "Let\'s not get carried away..."  Just tell the poor untrained
slob, MY task definition says:  MEDICAL-3 or higher required.  Period. 
Your first aid will NOT help you repair the damage you did to Sparky\'s
brain case with a blow torch whilst trying to extricate him from the toilet
bowl.  I know it\'s not his fault that his head is stuck, but you\'re going
to have to PAY a vet to do your dirty work and face the potential music for
animal abuse when the authorities find out.  (See, I can turn this around
and still make it come out with a good way to fleece the PCs...  Heh.)

Proposal, Marc:  A REQUISITES section in the neo-Task definition, without
which the difficulty goes up one level for each missing PIECE, such as the
potential for tools exists in your examples.  Say:

To commit plastic surgery on an unsedated canine (3 hours).
(EDU + MED [3+]) + Tools (required) < Impossible (ALLd).

You\'re absolutely right of course. Skills level should describe how good
the character is at the task and the controlling characteristic should
govern
a The unskilled penalty
b How fast/easily one improves in the skill.

A simple system (not the one I use):
- ----
Some ways of gaining experience points should be devised.
To get a new level of skill costs:
Lvl 0: 2 ep
Lvl 1: 1
Lvl 2: 2
Lvl 3: 3
Lvl 4: 4
Lvl 5: 5
Lvl 6: 6 et c

For each level the new skill is above characteristic/2 double the required
ep cost.
This makes it hard to gain high skills and nearly impossible to get if you
don not have the natural talent.

Well I cannot tell you your propability of hitting that door but as your
angle deviation in shooting is bell shaped (according to my Rheinmetall gun
design book for real guns) the propabilitys range dependance is bell shaped
or rather integrated bell shape. Those interested in the actual formula can
ask me and I\'ll jot it down.
Everybody who measure things in the real world knows that most measurable
stuff has bell shaped distributions (or are forced to have one to be
calculable;).

Why stop with 6D?  If skills can, essentially, be open-ended, why not leave
it open to devious GMs to require a 9D task roll?

Heh.  I like this.  "So, you want to jump from the air raft, do a double
air-borne somersault, land on your feet, and catch your cutlass, which the
drinkbot launched toward you, with what you assumed would be
machine-perfect accuracy?  Hmmm...  Sounds like a 10D task to me.  Oh, you
don\'t have telekinesis?  Or clairvoyance?  Make that 15D..."  There\'s
something to be said for combining task rolls, after all.

No.  I, too, used to be a d20 junky, Harold.  I even went so far as to
write my own task rules that were a blend of open-ended Rolemaster, task
difficulty driven Vampire, and d20 AD&D...  I have now reformed, and will
obey Marc as I always should have.  \'-)

I do like the new psionics rules.  Very elegant.  And I do like the d6
rules, too.  I just disagree with Ken: I think natural talent is far more
important than skill, most things being equal -- especially physical tasks.
 You?

And ultimately, I don\'t think the dice used matter: it\'s all in the
GameMaster...

Does it matter?  In assessing any proposed project, a good planner
assesses
three criteria:
	Technical:  Can it be done at all?  Is there a logical reason to
(do/not do) something?  This is the point that you\'re addressing.
	Fiscal:	Can we afford to do it?  is there enough money to do what 
needs to be done to complete it?  Obviously IG & Co have the money to
re-work the task/die system.  No one is arguing this.
	Political: Is there the emotional will to deal with the issue?
Frankly more technical projects crash on this item than either of the
other 
two.  All changes proposed must occur within an existing emotional
framework.
The emotional framework around Traveller includes the D6 solution as a
major part of the framework.  Any proposed solution must address this
emotional issue.  Just because it\'s an emotional issue doesn\'t make it 
an invalid or unreal objection.  People are not machines.  This is
especially
true of what is essentially an imaginative pursuit.

You\'ve got that backwards. They arrive and ask where people have cargo
to ship to.

That is, instead of saying "We\'re going to X, have any cargo for
there?" they ask "do you have anything that needs shipping?" and find
out if the destination is somplace that they figure they can deal with.

They\'ll decide on whether or not to carry a cargo based on things like
whether or not they think they will be able to pick up another cargo at
the destination. Or they might turn it down because it\'s a planet they
don\'t like doing business on (say that the local customs folks are a
*real* pain). Or that it\'ll take them too far away from their "home
port".

They also have to worry about things like being in range of a port
where they can *get* maintenance when maintenance is due. That\'s likely
to be their "home port".

A ship that has their next destination in mind isn\'t a "tramp"
freighter, and likely not a true "free trader". They\'ll be somebody
making runs on a somewhat fixed route, but not necessarily on a fixed
schedule.

That depends on your definition of *logic*.

For IG, it make great sense that they create a new mechanic system based
roughly on the old one. This serves two goals: 1) product familiarity withe
the core audience (which was my biggest gripe about TNE, aside from the
really confusing combat mechanics...I mean they name two distinct (and very
different) weapon attributes "penetration"...)

The second goal is product differentiation: IG wants T4 to be T4, not
Traveller: the Wandering (as WWGS might put it). While I like the WWGS
mechanics for thier simplicity, that is sometimes their greatest drawback.

As far as personal choice, I like the T4 system, so I use it. If you don\'t
like it, use whatever you want, but why buy a roleplaying game that leaves
so much for the gamemaster to fill (a definite plus for Traveller), and then
rip out a big chunk of what you bought and use something else? Why not just
avoid T4 and kitbash yyour own SF RPG?

The problem is that while the number of passengers *available* has a
two-tailed distribution, the number that you can *carry* is a single
tailed one (if there are more passengers than you have cabins, you
can\'t "use" the extras).

So you *can\'t* use the median. Or rather, you have to calculate a
*modified* median, where values above the number of staterooms are
converted to the max number available.

As an example, here\'s the mode, mean & median for two dice, when you
have a "ceiling".

ceiling	mode	mean	median	
- ----	----	----	----
2	2	2	2
3	3	2.9722	3
4	4	3.8888	4
5	5	4.7222  5
6	6	5.4444  6
7	7	6.0277  7
8	8	6.4444  7
9	9	6.7222  7
10	7,10	6.8888  7
11	7	6.9722  7
12	7	7.6111  7

I didn\'t have the inclination to go thru the hassles of calculating the
variance or standard deviation, but those will be equally distorted.

ps. for those not familiar with the terms, "mode" means "most commonly
seen value". So if you have to bet on the *exact* number, you pick the
mode. "Median" is the value you get if you list the values in order and
then find the midpoint of the list (note that iit is either a value in
the dataset, or the average of two adjacent values in the sorted
dataset). If you have to bet on "this number or higher" you pick the
median. And if you want the average, you pick the mean.

But in the real world, the whole *reason* for going to higher tech for
power plants (in stationary situations) is that they are cheaper to
build, maintain, or operate! And then the new tech gets moved to mobile
uses.

For mobile uses, it gets cheaper *or* smaller. Doing *both* is harder
than doing just one.

Besides, the *materials* for the powerplant *do* cost based on mass!
And in most cases, so does the "processing" (ie machining, shaping,
assembly, etc).

Because the authors were idiots. Or, alternatively, for the same reason
that airliners and cargo ships are built at the *highest* "common" tech
level on earth, not at the *average* tech level. 

15 is the highest "common" tech level. So *because* ships at that tech
level are so much more economical to run, they get *built* at that tech
level. 

Consider how few places in the world can build modern airliners. Only
the places that can\'t afford to buy them from those places use the old
DC-3s and the like. BTW, if I recall correctly, a DC-3 (built in the
30s) is 3 tech levels lower than a 1970s airliner. There are a lot of
old DC3s operating, even in places that have essentially 18th & 19th
century technology. But the most common carriers to anyplace
"important" use 70\'s and 80\'s planes.

Maintenance is expensive because you have to get those "hi-tech" parts.

I see. Sort of like the story about the guy trying to cheat at craps in
a casino. As he makes his throw, a third die falls out of his sleeve
and rools down the table with the other two. The croupier doesn\'t miss
a beat, he picks up the dice, hands two of them back to the guy and
says "14\'s your point..."

:-)

Oh yeah, *that* reminds me of a game we came up with after the local
game store got in some 8-siders that looked like "real" dice. Ivory
color, rounded edges and corners, and *pips*.

So we sat down with the rules to craps and modified them for a pair of
8-siders instead of 6-siders. It\'s actually *dead* easy. 2 stays 2, 3
stays 3, 7 becomes 9, 11 becomes 15, and 12 becomes 16.

We were playing at it in the comic shop (on the counter) when a customer
walked in. You should have seen the doubletakes. Most of the chatter
sounded like normal craps. Until the line above came out... And then as
he walks over to go "wait a second!" he sees the dice. God, I wish we\'d
had a camera.

This sort of thing might be nice to give the players some fun when the
ref doesn\'t have a chance to do a lot of pre-planning. Have them
gambling under "different" rules. Besides using different dice for
craps, you can also have fun with playing card games with a tarot deck.
Poker works if you get rid of the "greater arcana". It\'s just that you
have different suits and *four* face cards (King, Queen, Knight and
Page). And if you have the "Lando Carlrissian" books (I forget the
author) he describes a game that is sort of like craps or baccarat
using a tarot deck. It\'s called Sabac, and the rules he gives in the
stories are consistent. You can\'t simulate the electronic cards(*) but
the game works ok without them. And it\'s fun.

This is more fun than using "gambling" skill, even if it\'s not as good
as role-playing. And it lets the players have fun while the ref madly
finishes off the details he didn\'t expect to need until next week. :-)

(*) cards randomly swap values unless they are sitting on the table. So
that King of Staves in your hand may suddenly "swap" with a 3 of Coins
in someone else\'s hand. The problem is *whose*? And do you want to lay
down that good hand you have and collect *now*, or risk losing it while
you are running up the ante.

Hmmmm. It occurs to me that you could use gambling skill to determine
when and where to swap cards between hands. It\'d require the ref to
take all the hands after every bet and make (or not make!) the swap.
I\'ll have to try to find my copy of the rules and see if I can work out
a reasonable method. If I can, we\'d have a great little game where both
skill at playing the game (player) and "gambling skill" (character)
would affect the outcome. Skill levels run 0-6, right?

(Did you make your EDU roll?  ;-)

The same holds for test takers:  two student who are equal on INT and EDU
take the SAT.  One has taken it before (starting in the seventh grade), and
the other has never even seen the test format before.  The test taker with
skill in the SAT kick bloody hell out of the test (having already gotten
comfortable with it, though progressing to his personal maximum) and is
offered membership in MENSA.  The other student tends toward the population
mean test score, but learns from his experience: if s/he\'s not too bummed
about it, taking it again will raise h/is/er score...  Based on simple
experience.

I understand, but I take exception with the fact that a PC with an EDU or
INT of 3 could EVER get any skill in MEDICAL, or anything else but bantha
hunting, or tri-D watching.

Nope.  You don\'t go far enough...  Heh.  (I\'m taking lessons from Harold.

And an extremist to boot!  The old plastic explosive to the faceplate was a

Your system has merit, a la Millennium\'s End, Rolemaster, et al, but I
think that in the spirit of simplicity that *IS* Traveller (except
spelling...) that it is unnecessarily complicated.  Your model works, but
provides little extra in the way of "prediction": meaning you added that
variable and your adjusted-R-Squared went down...  Go back to the original
and KISS it.  (BTW, I love the RM source books, but the new rules are worse
than the old ones -- prime examples of how NOT to design a game system. 
What were they thinking up at ICE anyway?)

decisions for the Ketaru Aerospace "Star" far liner, and try to 
address voter comments.  I\'d like to thank the voters for seeing
fit to give fifth place to the most expensive design in the entire
competition!  :)  I\'d also like to offer my congratulations to the
winners, whose designs were all interesting and deserving. 

I chose first to concentrate on economic viability, even at the
cost of increased price and size.  I decided this was a good thing;
I wanted a more unique design than a "standard far trader", even if
a few points were lost because of it.  QSDS 1.5 was chosen because of
the discount, and now I like the system *much* more than SSDS.  [I\'d
like to see two things added; smaller standard hangars for vehicles
(three tons would be enough for a grav flyer) and an entry in the
USP for communications devices.]  In fact, I think that I\'d rather
see a QSDS-style large ship design system than one based on SSDS.

Design was done the same way I always do; pencil, paper, and hand
calculator.  I only turned to the computer to do the write-up.

I am happy with the final result.  A crew of eight, with four or
so bridge types, an engineer, two stewards and a doctor, seemed
to leave space for a fairly typical set of PCs and NPCs.  The
ship is profitable enough that they can goof off a bit, even if
my stateroom numbers turn out to be too high.  :)

    CSC, page 62, converted from cubic meters to displacement tons.  The
    ship can function without it; in that case the fuel purifier should be
    run when the thrusters are off (probably when the ship is landed).  It
    only runs when the fuel purifier is, so the fuel lasts a whole year. 
    A real shipboard "hot" fusion plant would be more efficient in fuel,
    but this is smaller and adds an interesting "quirkiness" to the ship.
    It adds effectively nothing to cost and takes almost no space.

On to voter comments:

> Too expensive by far, and I can\'t see how it got that way - did this
> one get its ISDP component discount?

Yes.  The only other 300-ton ship in the competition, the New Victoria
"T-300", cost just under MCr 70 and was designed with QSDS 1.4 not 1.5,
so it came out a lot cheaper.  From a down payment point-of-view, it\'s
only four megacredits or so more than average.  :)  The point of this
ship was that while it cost a bit more money, it would also make more
money and pay for itself faster than most 200-ton ships, even with 
less than complete passenger occupancy.

Nope.  This is confusing collapsible bladders (storable at 5%) and folding
dismountable tankage (storable at 25%).  From QSDS 1.5:

  "Collapsible Tanks: Insulated fuel bladders may be carried in the cargo
   hold to provide additional fuel. This fuel may not be used directly,
   but must be pumped into the ship\'s normal fuel tanks before use.
   Collapsible tanks cost Cr 1400 per ton of fuel carried. When empty,
   they can be stored at 5% of their full volume."

  "Dismountable Tanks: Dismountable fuel tanks may be carried in the ship\'s
   cargo hold to provide additional fuel. Fuel from these rigid tanks may be
   used directly by the ship\'s drives."
   [...]
  "A version is also available that can be disassembled to store in 25% of
   its full volume, at a cost of Cr 7000 per ton."

My text may have confused the issue by referring to the tankage as being
"collapsible dismountable" tanks.  I should have said "disassemblable"
to be absolutely clear, but I thought mentioning that it took up 25% of
the space when disassembled would be enough to clarify this.  

> Command crew is extaneous.

Not true.  Command crew was not extraneous, but *required*.  QSDS 1.5:

  "Command Crew: Total the above crew, and divide by six (round fractions 
   to the nearest whole number). This is the number of command crew. They
   will require workstations."

I had four in the "above crew" (2x Maneuver, Electronics, Engineering).
4/6 = 0.667.  The nearest whole number to 0.667 is 1.  It does not read
"drop all fractions" or something equivalent; I don\'t know if this is a
QSDS bug or not, but I was using the rules as written.

Not _wrong_. It says that the chance of spectacular success/failure is about
the same across the board for the hard tasks. Its a small percentage, but
enough to happen once in a while.

As for the skill vs characteristic controversy, I go back to the arfgument
that Lester Smith gave me in favor of it... that is, characteristic lays a
foundation and creates the basic expectation, while skill (usually in smaller
numbers) helps make the final determination. That\'s why we shifted to lower
is better.

I\'ll grant you, IG needs to make certain it explains these things to 
the new kids on the block.  But if you have a MegaTraveller Imperial 
Encyclopedia, then look near the back and you\'ll find the explanation 
of PBG.  Thats where I found it.  I\'d give you the page number, but 
I\'m not at home.

If we use this system, we get a clip that can power a 250joule weapon 100 
times.

I foget how it works in T4, but back in TNE each round was 5seconds,  if you 
wish you could forgo the 5 shots for full auto per round and charge up the 
pistol with 5 secs worth of juice.  This would make a 1250j shot.

not bad, but still a little wimpy. About on par with a 9mm pistol.  But 
here\'s the clincher, no batery pack on the belt and no power cord.  the 
entire clip masses only 25g!  you can do more dammage with larger clips of 
course, as the discharge rate is proportional to stored energy, which is 
itself proportional to size.  (Discharge rate = 1% of total stored energy, 
accord to 3g^3)

Of course this is just for the TL-9 battery, i am thinking of coming out 
with progressively more effiecent batteries for each TL

I think the logical argument would be psychology related.  In my
experience, people (particularly newcomers to role-playing games) are
simply much more comfortable with six-sided dice because they\'re used in a
gazillion other games.  They\'re familiar, have well-known characteristics
(even if only known subconsciously) and readily available.

It\'s easier to explain to a new player "Roll three dice and if your under
this number you\'ve hit the creature and roll two dice for damage" than
"Roll a twenty-sided die over this number and if you do, then roll three of
those four-sided dice for your damage."  And I can\'t count the number of
times over the years I\'ve seen people mix up a D12 for a D20, not to
mention how many times I\'ve had to explain how to read a D4.

What it amounts to is people already grasp the concept of a D6 and can
concentrate on learning the game mechanics.

I do not argue that your dexterity goes up, the question that I

Obviously some does.  However, not much.  The ability to accurately
fly an airplane does not help you as much with figure skating.  

So, _given_the_T4_task_mechanics_, which statistic better represents
this observed fact?  Skill or Attibute?

Note that here I am assuming T4 mechanics...  When I designed a 
RPG system myself (OK, it was a modified D&D) many years ago, I
set it up that as the character gained skills, they also gained
(more slowly) attributes.  The system worked, however, it was 
significantly more difficult to handle than T4.

Further, while it may, in some people\'s opinion, be less "realistic"
the game balance under standard T4 mechanics is swung strongly 
towards the character with high Attributes.  I prefer a game where
there is greater differentiation between characters and have thus
chosed to use a modified KBv1.1 task system.  My concern has
been over the (ab)use of Jack of All Trades possible in that system.
Even in T4 standard, I had a cast of characters wandering around
essentially running a starship on JOT and high stats.  It won\'t
happen again, but it was all within the rules....  :(

I admit, Harold, my argument for the D6 in Traveller is strictly 
emotional--which is usually unlike me.  It was me, after all, who 
wanted to change the jump time to a variable amount based on 
different jump drives instead of the cannonical one weel no matter 
what system.

But, then again, our resident jump guru, Glenn Hoppe, changed my 
life, and now I\'m a one week convert.

But as for the D6, it is strictly emotional, I\'m embarrassed to say.

Buddy, I don\'t know where you learned math, but that\'s a bell curve.  
It may look triangular because of your histogram, but it is a bell 
curve.

This curve just doesn\'t curve as much as, say, a 6D bell curve would.

You should have been taught that, in craps, using 2 D6, its a bell 
curve, too.

I\'d like to see you back this up.  I can\'t think of many endeavors 
that skill, training, and experience wouldn\'t increase success in.

That\'s why incredibly naturally talented Olympic hopefuls train every 
day.  They are raising their skill levels.

If natural ability was all that mattered, then they wouldn\'t train at 
all.  
	Announcer:  "Yesterday he was working in a Pizza House in upstate 
	New York, and today he\'s won the Gold Medal for long distance 
	running."

It just doesn\'t happen.

Maybe your thinking is--if I take somebody who is Olympic caliber but 
doesn\'t train and pit them against somebody who\'s a coach potatoe, 
then natural ability is bound to win out.

Well, I agree with this to a certain point, and KBv1.1 accounts for 
these types of situations.

Let\'s look at an example.

Ollie could have gone to the Olympics, but he never trained.  He\'s 
got great natural ability, though.  Stat-15, Skill-1.

Now, Carl used to think that he was a contender, but that was a long 
time ago.  He\'s done some training, but decided that it was just too 
much work.  He\'s relegated himself to being a couch potatoe.  Stat-4, 
Skill-2.

Ollie "the Olympic could have been" has a target number of 11 under 
KBv1.1.

Carl "the coach potatoe" has a target number of 6, under KBv1.1, 
which is half that of Ollie\'s.

Isn\'t it clear here that natural ability wins out over higher skill 
in KBv1.1?

Even if Carl\'s skill was 3, three times Ollie\'s, he\'d still only have 
a 8 target number--still much below Ollie\'s.

In fact, Carl would have to have a level 4 skill just to be able to 
compete with Ollie (Carl\'s level 4 gives a target number of 10), and 
Ollies would still have the edge.

Of course, this would mean that Carl was no longer a couch 
potatoe--he\'s highly skilled with a level-4 skill.  I\'d pick him more 
to be a coach at this point.  He know how to do it, he just doesn\'t 
have the natural ability to compete any more.

All of these examples show how KBv1.1 deals with attributes.

They are by no means trivial to the target number calculation.

The only difference is that skills now  mean something.  You should 
go back and try these examples under the T4 system.

Attributes mean even more, and skills add just about nothing to a 
character\'s success.

If you took the time to analyze the numbers of the system that you 
are advocating here, you would not be advocating it.

Becasue we are talking about the bell curves of several dice, the 
more dice you add, the more steep the curve.

10 or 15 D6 would be incredibly steep, meaning that not even a high 
stated/leveled character could accomplish this.

It is not an even progression between different curves (say rolling 
4D6 vs rolling 3D6).

A target number of 10 has a 91.67 % chance (adjusted for SF) on 2 D6. 
 Linear thinking leads us to believe that if we add one die to the 
mix, this should halve the number, and guess what--it does just about 
that.  Rolling a 10 or less on 3 D6 is a 50% proposition.

Well, heck, if that holds true, then adding one more die should halve 
it again, right?  Wrong.

You only have a 15.9% chance of rolling a 10 or less on 4 D6 where 
you would expect it to me around.  This is not the 25% that you would 
expect.  

Then, at 5 D6, we might expect another drop by half, but from where?  
The 15.9% or the 25%.  

Whatever the case, the chance of rolling a 10 or less on 5 D6 is 
3.24%.  Not the 8% that we might expect (judging from the 15.9% 
before).

Do you see where I\'m going with this?

Adding more dice to the difficulty throw does increase the 
difficulty, but it doesn\'t do it in a linear fashion.  It may seem 
that way at first, but what it does is increase the difficulty 
EXPONENTIALLY at the higher numbers.

It is like a train leaving the station.  It starts out slow but 
rapidly picks up steam.

What we are seeing is the bell curve becoming steeper and steeper.  
At first, it is almost a line with a good slope.  Then, it starts 
turning up, and goes to a sharp peak.  It\'s a wishbone shaped curve 
when you add a lot of dice.

 David, a 15 D6 task?  Without the numbers 
in front of me, I can tell you that even if you had a 15 target 
number, which is pretty good, your chance of rolling that on 15 DICE 
is just about 0%.  As a matter of fact, you\'d need a target number of 
around 90 just to have a 50% chance of success.

My suggestion to you is, when the characters want to pull off the 
impossible, use the Impossible dice code, but add some additional 
modifiers to the roll.

You are the one confusing the issues here.  Both attributes and 
skills cover BOTH realms of the physical and mental ability.

Attributes (or skills) are not just Physical, and neither is not just 
Mental.

STR, DEX, and END are physical attrubutes, conveying physical 
prowess.  INT and EDU, though, are mental attrubtes, conveying mental 
ability.

Likewise, Brawling, Pistol, and Athletics (albeit the mental realm 
helps these some too) are all physical skills whereas Medical, 
Astrogation, and Language are all mental skills (albeit the physical 
realm is necessary too).

Given this, I declare that your above argument is flawed.  Skills and 
Stats do not seperate the mental and physical worlds, rather they 
both combine them.

 Under the KB

Wrong again here, too.  Skill is not primary in KBv1.1.  The system 
only fixes the end-all-and-be-all of the attribute in the T4 system.

Under T4, attribute is primary, but in KBv1.1, the opposite doesn\'t 
occur.  Rather, both are put on a more level playing field.

See my rebuttal to your other post for some clear examples on this.

Sorry, David, I\'m not trying to be mean.  I just can\'t agree with a 
word you\'ve said.  I\'m trying to.  I really am.

What I think you are doing here is confusing the broad nature of 
skills and attributes in Traveller.  You point above is well taken, 
but I\'d argue that it is a big universe.  Strange things will 
happen, and I\'m not going to rule out that some poor slob on some 
rock out there would not become an MD just because his EDU might be 
lower than 7.

This might be the rule (I\'m not saying it is--just using your 
definition for the example) on most civilized planets, but isn\'t it 
possible for a person to obtain and MD level of skill without going 
through formal training?

What about the guy (off the top of my head) whose world has been 
taken over by an evil dictator?  This guy\'s been in the resistance 
ever since he was 9 years old, and has chance would take him, he\'s 
been helping the doctors help care for the freedom fighters.  Now, 
he\'s 29 years old, and although he\'s never had any offical training, 
he\'s picked up a lot along the way because of his trial by fire.

In Traveller terms, his skill has increased due to his exposure and 
learning by doing.  Also, he\'s seen and reparied a lot more wounds 
than most medically educated interns in a high tech emergency room on 
some other planets.

Couldn\'t this situation happen in Traveller?  If so, then your 
argument doesn\'t hold water.

Getting back to my original point, I think that you are confusing the 
broad nature of Traveller stats and skills.

Traveller skills can be broad.  Grav Craft, for ex, is very broad in 
that it allows you to operate many types of vehicles--not just one 
type.  You can fly grave belts and air rafts--two totally different 
types of operation.

Traveller skills can also be narrow.  Acting, for instance, only 
covers this one type of action.

Regardless, all Traveller stats are broad.  DEX covers both the 
highly physical actions associated with Brawling, but also covers the 
simple hand-eye coordination associated with simply standing, aiming, 
and firing a weapon at a target--even though the only physical action 
is holding the gun and squeezing the trigger.

This shows that your physical-mental thinking argument is flawed.

Three reasons why I don\'t agree with Lester\'s thinking.

If we use Lester\'s argument, then characters are much 
more generic than if we use the skill is the same as attribute 
argument (note I didn\'t say skill is better than stat).

The reason for this?  There are  many more skills, some not even made 
up yet in future supplements, than there are stats.

There are now, and always will be, six Traveller stats ranging in 
level from 1-15.

But as I see it, the skills a person has defines him, and there are 
many more skills than there are attributes.

Also look at this--reason number two.  It\'s the more important 
reason.

Since the six attributes govern everything, Lester\'s thinking leads 
us to believe that a person will be about as successful in a fist 
fight as he is shooting a gun.

Those are two widely varried activities.  I, myself, am pretty good 
at shooting weapons.  It\'s all hand-eye coordination.  Physically, I 
just stand there and pull the trigger.

A fist fight is a whole different story.  I\'d bet money that I\'d get 
my butt kicked if I got in one.

Yet, under Lester\'s thinking, these would be about the same for me.  
Dex governs both Brawling and Gun Combat.  My skill level would tweak 
what my Dex brought to the calculation, but except for a few points, 
my chance to hit is much closer than if we used a system where skill 
had more impact.

This leads to much more generic characters.

I fall back on an example I heard from another TMLer--I think it was 
Doc Vince (maybe not).

He said that he had a character in his group that had Dex-4 and 
Pilot-4, but that this guy was good for nothing with his piddely ole 
8 target number.  He definitely wasn\'t the best pilot in the group.

But after switching to KBv1.1 where skills have a more important role 
in the target number calculation, this character actually took 
advantage of his level 4 pilot skill when his target number increased 
to 10.

In other words, under the T4 system, everything the character does 
with his Dex, because it is so low, will suck--all the varied tasks 
that Dex controls will have a low chance of succeeding.

In this system, how do you explain me?  I can shoot pretty good, but 
I can\'t brawl worth a damn.

If you create a system where skills are a little more important, 
characters can, at some point down the road, overcome their deficency 
in a particulary area with practice.

I for instance, may take Karate to increase my Brawling level.  
And, at some point down the road, I might even be able to beat 
someone with a much greater natural ability--because of my skill.

But this skill doesn\'t improve me in other Dex tasks.  I still shoot, 
or fence, or fly and aircraft the same as I did before.

That improvement will not be reflected in the same way under Lester\'s 
thinking.  In fact, I really have to improve a bunch before I can get 
that good.

A third comment on Lester\'s thinking is that, from a game stand 
point, players are encouraged to in crease their stats over 
increasing certain skills.  

This just doesn\'t seem right.  There should be more incentive to 
learn more skills and increase the ones you\'ve got.

Skills shouldn\'t count for more than attributes, but they should 
count at least the same as attributes.

I would like to thank Marc for pointing this out. I would also like to say
that if ANYONE can show me hard evidence that attributes do NOT contribute
SIGNIFICANTLY to ability, I will go with the (attribute/2 + skill x2) crowd.
I contend that this all boils down to philosophy, and it is now apparent
that Marc\'s philosophy is that the task system in this respect remain
unaltered. And since Marc\'s name is on the game, his version of reality is
the one you\'re going to get. I choose to accept that version of reality, and
get on with playing Traveller.

I\'m a d6 agnostic I guess -- though I do still have a way cool pair of d20s
from when I started gaming about a million years ago (right beside the jade
d6s I won in adventure design competition :) ).

But... I too have had trouble with the one-week rule.  It makes for some

rationale for it.  Kenneth (or Glenn?), care to enlighten me?

I am playing with a new idea that may cure the ills of the T4 task 
system and KBv1.1.

That is, it will get rid of the 1/2 die, reduce the math involved 
with KBv1.1, and still provide low probabilities for Impossible 
tasks.

First, I need to make a few assumptions.

Please help me to define these because the system will be based on 
the official definition.  In all cases below, we are talking about 
humans.

The questions that I need answers to are numbered.  In your reply, 
simply copy the number and question (you can delete all the other 
verbage) and state your reply.

I invite all who read this to make his opinion known, although I\'m 
really looking to hear from Marc on these so that I can work from a 
official position.

Here goes...

Attributes.

This should be easy.  I am working from the assumption that 
attributes run from 1 to 15.  This is stated in the rules, so there 
should be no problem there.  

My assumption is that the average human attribute, that is "average 
human ability in the stat category", is 7 just like in CT.

1) Does anyone dispute that the average characteristic for a 
human is 7?  Marc Miller or anybody else on the TML?

OK, assumption two, and this will be a little more sticky.

The rules state that there are no maximum skill levels for a 
particular skill.  But, there comes a point when skills tend to max 
out, even if there is no predefined level limit.

My thinking is that the skill levels in T4 are valued as much as they 
were in CT.  The difference in T4 is that characters have more 
skills (which is a good change), but the value of each skill level 
for those skills, eventhough a character may have more of them, is 
the same as they were valued in CT.

That is, level 1 is a beginner level.  Level 3 is a professional 
level.

Given this, I am working from the position that skills max out at 
around 7-9.  It will be very, very rare for anybody, no matter how 
great they are, to have a level 10 skill.  Actually, I think even 
level 9\'s will be unheard of.

Also given these assumptions, I think that the average skill level 
that a character has will be around 2 or 3.  Picking one of these, 
I\'d say that level 2 is the average skill level for a character.

2)  Are T4 skill levels valued the same as CT skill levels eventhough 
a character may have more skills?

3)  Do you dispute that level 1 skills are beginner level 
skills?  If so, what is a beginner level, in T4 terms, to you?

4) Do you agree that level 3 skills are professional level skills?  
If not, what level, in T4 terms, would you assign a professional 
level skill (like when a doctor graduates from med school, goes 
through his residency, and begins his practice)?

5) What would you say the average skill level is for a character?

6) At what level do you think T4 skills should max out at?  Not to 
impose a level limit, I\'m asking what level do you think will be 
virtually unheard of for a character\'s skill?

All of your responses, especially Marc\'s, will be greatly 
appreciated.  

Maybe we can all benefit from this in haveing a common, official, 
definition for these questions and terms.

And, maybe I will be successful for this idea I have for KBv2.0.  

Thanks in advance,

Kenneth.

I want to second this proposal.

came out and Kenneth was hammering out his task fix ;-)

has been watching some of the debate (which makes me neutral! :-).  One
problem with adding more dice to make impossible tasks more "impossible" is
that, as you add more dice, your distribution narrows.  This, when you roll
more dice the effect if a higher target number is magnified.  That is why
you see results where a low target number gives almost no chance of
success, but a good targer number, instead of giving a small but real
chance (say 10 %) has something near a 50-50 chance.

I\'m not sure what to do about it.  You might roll bigger dice
instead of more dice.  You might also reduce all targer numbers
in some way.

HEPlaR is astonishingly efficient - exhaust velocity much higher than any
imaginable fission drive, and it also fuses some of the hydrogen for energy
(and still bends conservation of energy.)

Conservatively, you might (per unit thrust) increase fuel consumption by a
factor of 100 relative to HEPlaR, power consumption by a factor of 10-100, 
and mass of the drive by a factor of 10. What you should end up with
(for a Heinleinesque drive) is something that can give you a few Gs
but with only enough fuel for tens of minutes of acceleration (a G-hour or
two total delta-V); Heinlein\'s ships in (say) "The Rolling Stones" didn\'t
have much delta-V at all.

Alternatively, look at George Herbert\'s table on MT low-tech thrusters,
at 
http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/house/thrusters.html
among other places - includes notes on converting to FFS format.

Don\'t forget to use the G-hours=ln(MR)/FC formula for these mostly-fuel ships.

I thought you\'d never ask. :-)

The solid rationale is this:

The charging of the jump grid creates a particle field which allows a 
starship to enter jumpspace. It is this field which encloses a 
normal-space "bubble" containing the ship. As long as the field is up the 
ship remains in jumpspace.

The field is generated by the jump grid, once the grid reaction is 
initiated, it cannot be stopped -- It must be allowed to run its course. 
It takes some time for the reaction to end; this time is 168 hours +/- 
10%.

Once the reaction is completed, the particle field is no longer being 
replenished, and hence the ship naturally "precipitates" out of jumpspace.

Sidebar: The reason why Lanthanum is used in the production of the jump 
grid is because its properties are such that it is the most efficient at 
"cooling". Other rare earths can be substituted at the expense of longer 
times for jump.

This is the rationale I came up with and internalized, and the one which 
made Ken a convert. (more or less, I\'m paraphrasing from memory).

My understanding is July 2, 1946. 

Last year, ID4 was released on 3 July 1996.

	Here\'s an idea for JoaT. Instead of letting you substitute JoaT for
anything, what it does is allow you to improvise or pull together
bits\'n\'pieces of information to try to accomplish the task. For a task
where you don\'t have the skill, a successful roll vs JoaT at the SAME
difficulty allows you to avoid the unskilled penalty. In other words, your
eclectic knowledge was enough to give you a temporary skill-0.

Well, aside from a 1965 Corvette convertible...

I want a task system that is easy to use but flexible enough to adapt to
what I need. Marc\'s proposed system does that. yes, there are a couple
things I would like tweaked (a better method of determining Spec
Success/Failure, and a somewhat less omnipotent version of JOT), but I don\'t
think there\'s anything wrong with the balance of attributes vs. skills. I
think that "reality" cannot be modelled in a game, especially one with as
limited a spread of attributes and skills as Traveller has. It requires a
much more complex game to even get close.
and I don\'t want it to! I play Traveller to recreate the FICTION I enjoy.
This "reality" that Traveller supposedly emulates comes from the fact that
the characters are lower in ability than those in a lot of games. I don\'t
believe it really exists-and I\'m glad for that.

Marc,

I think that the Attributes..or Characteristics, if you will..should form
the *foundation* for skills, but the foundation isn\'t the house!  I\'d
rather see a system where the basic characteristic modifies how much each
increase in skill contributes to the total.  

I don\'t like the situation where a single high stat..say EDU..constitutes
the majority of the totals for dozens of different skills.  

Maybe we need more Attributes...<g>

> That\'s why we shifted to lower is better.

Lower is better *is* a better way to go.  I want that to stay in whatever
system is settled on.

Actually, the fight in which the question came up involved boarding a
derelict, holed, ship whose power was completely out...  The players opted
for paint bombs because none of us could figure out what\'d happen to a bunch
of dust in a non-gravved vacuum!  We figured the paint, at least, would
stick or spatter on impact. NPCs were more irritated than anything else when
surprised with a paint bomb - one whose visor got sprayed was blinded until
he could get the paint off... Reading several of the responses to my query
(BTW - Tx to all of you who did throw in yr Cr02 - most helpful and
educational!), I got to thinking...  It\'s pretty cold in a vacuum not
exposed to sunlight.  What sorts of chemicals would stay liquid in such an
environment - or at least gooey/sticky enough to be a hazard? Tx! - Bill

I got lucky.  I found several D3 at a flea market! They look just like D6
but have only 1s, 2s, and 3s on \'em...  

Note to IG:  Contact the Armory, in Baltimore, MD - they make lots of dice
in lots of colors and sizes... Why not see whether they\'ll do a set of
Traveller dice?  Perhaps one of their little clear plastic boxes with a
dozen black w/red pipped D6 and four D3s...  Assuming, of course, that the
D3 stays around awhile...

Allen, Allen, Allen.

The attribute/2 + skill x 2 crowd is not saying that attributes 
should not SIGNIFICANTLY contribute to success.  They are just saying 
that skills should also SIGNIFICANTLY contribute to success too.

With T4, the way it is, skills pale in comparison to attributes.  
Under KBv1.1, they are weighted about the same.

Attributes are not the end all and be all of success.  Skill has a 
big contribution to make as well.

In T4, skill only tweaks.

We are not trying to turn the tables on attributes.  We don\'t want 
skills to be the end all and be all of the target number either.  We 
just want them weighted about the same as attributes.

That\'s all.

And, I don\'t think Marc subscribes to this theroy as much as he wants 
to keep the game mechanics simple.

From what I\'ve seen, he doesn\'t like inconveinent math, as simple as 
it is, in the KBv1.1 system.  He wants addition only.

As a matter of fact, that\'s what I want too, but I also want 
skills weighted as much as attributes.

Although I agree with your post, I wanted to make this, ahem, 
emotional comment.

I really don\'t have an opinion of wether we roll higher or lower, but 
I\'ll tell you that I was a bit disappointed when I first realized 
that we had to roll lower to achieve success in T4.

There\'s just an emotional high that I miss from MT and CT from 
rolling boxcars.

Ahhh!  Damn, that feels good.  Boxcars!

Remember when you first rolled a natural 20 in D&D and your DM told 
you that you just made a perfect hit--double damage?

To quote Gordon Gekko (Wallstreet),  "It was better than sex."

Well, maybe not better than that, but upon doing the numbers, I found 
that rolling lower, under the T4 system of establishing target 
numbers to beat (up or down), is better because of the way SS and SF 
are handled.

The SS and SF method are one of the really ingenius ideas to come out 
of T4.  I\'d say that this idea has been under appreciated by the 
masses, and I can only attribute that to not understanding its 
brillance.  I was agast when Marc was considering changing the SS/SF 
system to three 1\'s and three 6\'s.

In most games, the chance for SS is the same as the chance for SF.  
T4 is the first I\'ve seen that increases your chance of SF and 
decreases your chance of SS the harder the task gets.

The harder a task becomes the harder it is to do really well at it-- 
and the easier it is to really screw up.

This is a really novel idea, and I\'ve come to accept the lower is 
better concept.

But that high you get in rolling high is hard to give up.  If you\'ve 
ever played craps at a casino, the T4 roll low method is like betting 
against the shooter.

And something like 85% of all craps players play with the shooter 
eventhough the odds are slightly higher if you bet against him.

Why is this?  One reason I would posit is that people like to roll 
high.

After all, a Yahtzee is five 6\'s, not five 1\'s.

Dave, you have done a wonderful job on this.  I think that I\'ll use 
this from now on.

This TML thing is just a caldron of creative thought.  You should 
send your idea to Marc.  I think that this puts JOT back into the 
place it was originally intended to be.

It doesn\'t give characters a skill.  What it does is give characters 
a chance.  And, I can see them having to make the JOT roll you cited 
each and every time they try to use JOT to get them out of a jam.

Excellent thinking!

Good job!

Have you sent this to Marc or IG.  It is something that they should 
read as well.

A lot of Traveller players, at least many of the ones I\'ve met in the 
last 14 years, can\'t buy the one-week-no-matter-what concept.  They 
either blindly accept, but don\'t like, the rule, or they come up 
with, like I did, a different concept that changes the one week rule.

Reason:  There has never been an offical product that puts it so 
succinctly.  Even DGP\'s grand work, the SOM, muddles over this 
particular topic.  I get the idea that DGP didn\'t like the idea 
either.

You should send your idea off to Marc and IG.  Even if they don\'t 
print it somewhere, they should be exposed to it.

As a side note, one of the things you said that sold me was the 
materials used in the jump grid.

The question is, "why must the field, after being initialized, be 
allowed to run its course?  After all, we can start it but we can\'t 
stop it?"

And what you said to that was, "Maybe the materials used in the jump 
grid cannot be \'cooled down\', for lack of a better term, faster than 
168 hours +/- 10%."

This made a whole heck of a lot of sense to me.  We can start and 
stop the effect, but today\'s technology (that is, Traveller 
technology) cannot at this point cool down the grid any faster.

Another thing that I like about this is that it leaves the door open. 
 Maybe in the future of Traveller, in a future milieu, it will be 
possible to cool down jump grids in a faster manner.

This also explains why, eventhough ships can travel variable 
distances, it always takes the same amount of time no matter what 
jump drive you are using.

The engineers are already cooling the damn things down as fast as 
possible now.

And this will remain so until new technology improves cool down time.

   This reminds me of the article in JTAS#2 where MM (or possible LW?) couldn\'t
find such dice and related how he made his own with some red paint. 
Admittedly, this story\'s ~20 years out of date, so I\'m wondering if this
color-scheme is currently available.  I\'ve been intending to buy myself a set
of such "Traveller dice" (as well as 1 red w/black spots for use as D3 or the
"tens digit") but I never think about it when I\'m actually at the game store.  
My current set, black + white with little skulls for 1\'s, just don\'t seem right
for Traveller, somehow.
   As for Dave "heresiarch" Golden, I can only shake my head with sorrow and
wonder how such a promising soul could be led so terribly astray.  And, oh 
yeah, I\'m afraid we\'re going to have to burn you at the stake now, so please 
stay put at your computer terminal, meditate upon the error of your ways, and 
wait for us to arrive

1.  Great idea to ditch the D3\'s.  The are not so much of a problem as they
are a hassle.  Whole numbers fit better into my feeble mind. :)

2.  I have two skills that I would like to see added.  If you feel these
skills are already covered in others, I\'d sure like you to tell me where,
cause I couldn\'t find em. :)

     Farming -  The science of raising crops/livestock.
     Steward -  The ability to handle Higher society passengers on Starships.

3.  I would like to see a return to Charisma an Attribute, and put Social
Standing as an extended attribute.  The reason is because there are some
skills that would be limited by a low Social Standing, but shouldn\'t be.
Forexample, Han Solo in, IMHO, a great Carouser, however, when we first meet
him (before joining the rebellion) he has a low social standing as a
smuggler/rogue.  Why should he be punished for his low social standing when
he actually should get a bonus, because it is a benefit.  Carousing in the
cantina is a perfect example, it is not his SOC, EDU, or INT that help him
do it well. (And is certainly isn\'t STR, DEX, or END.) So what is it that
makes him good?  It is his Charisma.

4.  While I am in favor of the 1/2 attribute twice skill method, I\'m not
sure I\'ve seen the following comparison done yet.  T4 is the attribute +
skill method, and KB is the 1/2 attribute + twice skill method.

Wow, interesting that this lowers the target number for the normal PCs
(Assuming Attr 5-B and skill 1-3).  I like this, and I will probably use it
to one degree or another no matter what method is chosen to be official, but
It would be nice if this is the official method.

porting?

Porting is pulling a character from another Sci Fi source or a literary
work, or even a contemporary/historical character into your game (with
complete NPC stats and all).  I was trying this today with some ideas to put
some Popular Sci-Fi people into Traveller terms, and I ran into a problem.

Many people have some time in their life where they really don\'t do anything
listed as a career in the Traveller Rules.  They do some things, but often
they are not important, or at least don\'t really match up into a "real"
Traveller Career.  Take Luke Skywalker for example, I have a very hard time
believing that he is only 17 when the first movie starts.  In Traveller
terms, I would say that he is 21 (especially since IIRC, he and Leah are
twins and she is already performing Diplomatic functions).  So what career
would you say was that first "term" of young Luke\'s life?

With this in mind, I\'m working on the creation of a General Career.  While
it is not yet done, I have the basic idea sketched out in my head.  I\'m
going to try to get it down on paper in the near future and if I like it,
I\'ll post it here.  In the mean time, I\'d appreciate any comments that
anyone has.

    'body' => '     Because I\'m fickle-natured, and because no really good solution has come
along yet, I\'m almost ready to concede defeat and accept the fact that
attributes carry more weight than skills in T4.  The recent "pro-attributes"
posts have led me back to believing that it really is just a matter of taste
and feel, and that neither system is fundamentally better than the other
(except that, as it now stands, the pro-skills side requires more in-game math
and extra kuldge-steps).
     However, before I change sides totally, I have to point out that if the
current stat-favoring system stays in place, then there\'s a problem with
character generation, and stat increases will need to be removed from the Skill
Charts (or at least made to cost extra).  As the system currently stands, not
just abusive mini-maxers, but anybody would be remiss not to increase their
various stats (especially  DEX,INT, or EDU) up as high as possible and then
load up with a bunch of level-1 skills, \'cause such characters will be much
more effective in the game than their "moderate stats and a few pretty good
skills" counterparts (ie- traditional Traveller PCs).

     For example, if John P. Character has DEX 8 and spends two terms (for 10 
advances) he could raise his DEX to 12 and take 6 level-1 skills, giving him a
target number of 13 with a variety of tasks, or he could take, say, 2 level-5
skills, giving him a target number of 13 in two tasks, but a 4 (unskilled) in
everything else.  The first option is obviously the "better" character, and I
don\'t think it takes an abusive mini-maxing mind to realize this.

     In order to maintain some sense of balance and proportion here, increasing
attributes MUST be made more costly than increasing skills, simply because the
effects are so much more far-reaching.  In order to maintain balance, I\'d say
that the stat cost should be 3 to 4 times the skill cost, so in our example
above, Option One could only increase his DEX to 10 (@ 3 pts) and get 4 level-1
skills, giving him target numbers of 11-- he\'s still more versatile than
option two, but also not quite as "good" in his areas of expertise, and thus
more balanced.
                                                                 
     I strongly urge all pro-stat people to give this modification
consideration, because wihout it, character generation will become an abusive
player\'s paradise, and will cause endless headaches for GMs and players
(especially non-statistically minded ones) alike.

Then I have a suggestion. DOUBLE the number of skill levels characters get
and double the number of dice used at each difficulty level. This way, a
level 6 would be considered professional level. Give 2 skill levels per year
in character generation and 2 for each promotion, etc. This allows skills to
be more finely distributed, increases the relative proportion of skill to
attribute, and even allows tweaking the task system to have Intermediate
levels between the current ones. I am quite sure that the powers that be
won\'t go for that, and someone will invariably yell "but then an average
task isn\'t 2D anymore and that\'s not Traveller..." but it would work.

So Joe Blow has Dex 12, and Medical 1.  He attempts an Average
laproscopic cholecystectomy (removing the gallbladder).  The target
number is 13!  Do you really think this makes any sense?

Dr. Dianna Blow (his sister) is a 2d year surgery resident, with Dex 8
and Medical 3.  She has a ~3% chance of screwing up, while her
brother the EMT can do this sucker hung over (-1 DM :-) every time.

This is _screwy_.

I say that we take the Lap Choly task as Average for a pro.  For
each skill level below "Professional" we make the task a Difficulty
level harder.  So Joe can try the proceedure, but he goes for his
target number of 13 on 3d6, not 2d6.

(that assumes 3 is "professional.")

Does this make sense to any body else?

In this case if a professional pilot is 3 (a "Masters License" from
the Merchant Association), then pilot task diff levels are based on
pilot 3 skill.

This will be trickier for things like bribery, but those skills
might have more to do with attributes any way.

There, that\'s my take, and it doesn\'t really require a fix, just a
clarification.

I\'d go with fail by double, or more sizes than other #\'s rolled, dependant
upon difficulty. I\'d use by double for any at all, and more 6\'s on 3d or
harder.

Actually, I run PC\'s as "Ordinary Folks" (avoiding "Joe" reference to avoid
insulting our Zhodani friends), with extra-ordinary drive. I have (in one
campaign) had 3 nobles as PC\'s, and they DID find a way to put Dulinor on
the throne... but it took a 12 month campaign ccovering some 3+ years, a
lot of wheeling and dealing, and calling in markers, for them to get enough
clout to try. Then Survival margin came out....

Anyway, I figure that CGen produces slightly above average individuals, but
ones who are representative of the career types shown. Not =FCbermenschen
(ubermenschen=3Dovermen~supermen), but the higher half of the 1st Std
Deviation. With a few exceptions, who tend to be +-2 SD. When CGen allows
PC\'s to have 6 levels of skill in their primary fields without college
educations, I figure that level 6 must be slightly above norm.

they have a fixed route to follow, and ask for cargos going to one of the

I won\'t run MS ANYTHING that isn\'t required for work... and Eudora,
Netscape, and several other programs I have encoutered DO require the
"Mailto:", as they only recognize HTML HRef subset. Thus, I can\'t hot-link
off of a sig unless it has mailto:, HTTP:, FTP:, Gopher:, or Telnet:
prefixed to the address. OTOH, I also don\'t have to work hard to keep MS
Mail from affixing RTF or HTML copies of the message as attachments,
either. And Eudora Lite is Free, easy, and (for me and my friends, at
least) intuitive to use.

And if I have learned nothing else from TML, always provide to the lowest
common denominator above "Idiot". Anything less leads to 0.1C+ rocks. ;-)

my skills post suggested that we standardize tasks on a

me.  Just note tasks with a Base Skill Level.

So we\'d have:

Land Spacecraft from Orbit, Average,  Dex (Int?) (Pilot 1)

Override Computer Lockout, Difficult, Int, (Comp 2)

Back to my medical examples (can you tell I live with a resident
surgeon? :-)

Wound Suture, Average, Dex (Med 1)

Common Surgery, Average, Dex (Med 3)

Specialized Surgery, Difficult, Dex (Med 3)

The listings are:  Task, DiffLevel, Attribute, (Base skill level)

So you\'d adjust the Diff level up or down based on the base skill
level.  You can assign any base skill level you want, so any listing
of "professional" skill levels would be to help you estimate the
task difficulty.  Some examples would be useful to help people out
of course.

I would suggest treating JoaT or skill-0 attempts pretty harshly for
some applications, perhaps an additional +DL (DiffLevel Mod) for
stuff that really is a learned task.

The sheer SIZE of the D number should\'ve been a clue, as should the

My point is that if it works MOST of the time, use it.  I\'d rather play and
have my players enjoy the game, than be statistically accurate: I\'ll leave
that for my day job...

You made some really good points, David, but I believe you and several
other posters who made similar points have a fundamental misunderstanding;
I am not trying to simulate the "Real World(tm)". I am playing a game. I am
trying to have fun. I am trying to entertain a bunch of my friends with
science fiction role-playing. I have no opinion on the \'nature vs. nurture\'
debate. I do have an opinion on people who think the Real World (tm) can be
accurately modeled by 6 integers which range from 1 to 15; they need to get
out more.

My only complaint about the T4 task system is that it is not fun. The
existing task system penalizes players who made one bad roll in character
generation and makes superhumans of characters who happen to have made a
good roll. The existing task system makes characters who are superior in
one (for example) Edu-based tasks superior in ALL Edu-based skills they
have. I cannot design adventures for specific individuals because
low-attribute characters are so weak they can barely defeat a minor threat
and high-attribute characters are practically interchangeable. I cannot
make a character who is (for example) a superb Historian but a mediocre
Archeologist (or computer programmer, for that matter). Attributes so
overwhelm task calculations that skill level become nearly irrelevant.
High-attribute characters become near clones of each other. This is not
enjoyable role-playing. This is boring. I do not love the new T4 task
rules.

True, the T4 system is simpler and easier than the KB system. Rolling 3+ on
a single die to succeed for all tasks would be simpler and easier yet, and
would be even more boring. I am not trying to be condescending to you or
disrespectful of the incredible work Marc has put into this game; it is one
of my small pleasures in life which I am simply trying to make more
enjoyable. All the discussion about olympic figure skaters and talent vs.
training and Real World (tm) is, to me, pointless. Chess does not really
simulate warfare, yet it is a very enjoyable game. The issue, to me, is
that the existing task system detracts from my and my players\' enjoyment of
the game.

Actually, Traveller is the second oldest RPG.  D&D, of course, is 
the oldest.  

Therefore, there were no SF RPGs before Traveller.

Check out Joe Walsh\'s stuff.  It is pretty good.  I downloaded it

Joe\'s though.  I think it was somebodyelse\'s who had Joe\'s stuff

Yes, the black six siders with red dots are available.  In fact, they 
are really popular at my local game store.

A friend of mine recently bought some for his D&D campaign.  He calls 
them the "death dice".

I play social standing as relative to the situation.  A person may 
have a high soc in one place only to go to another and have a medium 
or low soc.

And it\'s relative to peers also.  Han Solo actually had, in my view, 
a high soc in the eyes of the other smugglers.  He was Jabba\'s numero 
uno smuggling pilot before the movie started (and this is finally 
stated in the new digital scene in the recent released version of the 
movie).

Of course, to the common citizenship, Han\'s soc is really low.

I like what MT had to say about soc in the MT PM--that soc is 
variable and will vary over a person\'s life.  I took this a step 
further and read this to be that soc could vary depending on the 
situation.

Ya see, we are all Vargrs at heart!

And it is just my take on the situation.

Look, Allen, it wasn\'t my intent to be patronizing to you.  I was

I guess you are a little too sensitive to my quips, and that\'s too

This would not work because doubling the amount of dice thrown would 
would make the bell curve way too steep.  If you ran the percentages 
on this system, trust me, you would not like them.

 I am quite sure that the powers that be

Actually, because of what I\'ve just stated, it would not work.  You 
would need huge target numbers and the scale would drop off too fast 
between difficutly categories.

These bell curves and six siders are tricky things.

Depends. Primary field In My Experience, tends to be 4-8 under t4, rather

13. This is just over 1.5x the max under MT. (Actually, MT had no max on a

Allen:

That very approach (It\'s the DESIGNER\'s Game) is the very reason that shops
Like GW and Palladium are driving people OUT OF THE MARKET. They both
demand that all ideas be either published through a house organ of the
parent company, or not published at all. If T4 is the only legitimate
"Traveller", then I do not, will not, and only for a short while have:
played "legitiamte Traveller".

Traveller has a history of being open to player ideas, Allen, and when that
ceases, it had better have a hard-core following like GW and Palladium, or
it will fail as fast as Nova Force or Road Rebels.

In my 14 years of playing Traveller, I remember most clearly that EVERY
EDITION EXCEPT T4 has had a "comment and suggestion" card. I got a response
from Loren W to one item on one (complained about missing parts) and got
the missing rulebook. I know it had to be the Card, and not the letter, as
the letter went into the mailbox the same trip to the PO as I pulled the
missing rulebook out of the mailbox. T4 doesn\'t need the reply cards, as
they accept E-mail.

Marc:

 Thank you yet again for the chance to have some influence in the shaping
of traveller. Thank you for not going chauvanistic like K. Simbieda. Thank
you for the Imperium, in it\'s 1100 years of glory.

Now, how about TWO task systems in the book: one 2300/DGP/mega-esque, and
one multi-dice (KB1.1 reccomended there). Make Traveller the most flexible
base book on the market.

This is so true and a real problem with the attribute means all 
method.

The people who want attributes want them to be all powerful, like 
Lester Smith\'s thinking.

We twice skill, half attribute people want a balance between the two.

People think that because to are doubling the skill and halving the 
attribute, you end up with much more skill than attribute.

But, this is not true because of the different scales each is on.  
Stats run from 2 to 15.  Skills run from 1 to about 9.

The average stat is 7.  The average skill is 2.

Under KBv1.1, stat is reduced to 4 and skill is doubled to 4.

You see, they are now providing the same benefit to success--not one 
over the other.

This is an interesting idea.  Of course, it is not necessary to redo 
all of the generation careers, which are now close to what they were 
in CT, to something different to account for this.  Instead, you 
could just use KBv1.1.

Eudora adheres to internet standards while MS does not and that is why the

There\'s no temperature in vacuum. The temp on the paint droplets will be
the same as the walls of the ship after a while but the droplets will start
evaporating, taking away heat to freeze the remainder as there will be no
liquid phase in vacuum.
I\'m worried (not really ;) about the description of a cloud, ball of
droplets et c. In vacuum paintbombs behave like frag grenades and spray
cans as sawed off shotguns which means that the droplets/ice particles will
move in a straight line until they hit something. They will not hang around
as a cloud unless dispersed really slowly.

WRONG

You\'ll have to throw an infinite number of dice to get a bell curve.
Your misconception is that you think anything that isn\'t linear has to be a
bell curve.

But for gaming purposes I\'d say that even 2D6 has enough bell-curvedness to
be called a bell curve. Enough nit picking.

It _was_ a coincidence, July 3 was the day before July 4 when all americans
frolic and celebrate their "great" nation as was portrayed in the film.

Skills should count for everything and describe fully the characters
ability in that area. Characteristics govern the ability to learn skills.
Skill levels should\'t be numbers but rather a text description of the level
of mastery in the skill that will help the players to flesh out their view
of the character.
"He\'s a GOOD pilot but TERRIBLE shooter so we\'ll leave him out of the boarding"

This is MY view and MY view is always right as I\'m the gamemaster!

Use a fixed number of dice (2D6). Variable number of dice also screws up

IMHO it would be better to have an additional characteristic here,

Most american "hollywood-type" films are pure propaganda. When I see
these films I feel remembered of old clips of the "Deutsche

Well Heinleinian ships had a fission core through which hydrogen was pumped
a la NERVA but a little higher TL you can use a gas core fission drive
where you make your fission core not only to meltdown but to vaporize as
Chernobyl partially did. This core is controlled and the gas is let out the
back with dramatic increase in Isp and no power requirement. I read about
it in some aerospace journal some years ago.

Verbal compatability rule: "All named gametokens should
correspond to real world tokens of the same name"
Task level names should mean the same as their real world equivalents when
performed by the normal practitioner ie _professional_

We need to define what skill levels really mean but the overimportance on
characteristics makes this impossible (meaning nearly not doable unless you

If they\'re taking mail they effectively become \'liners\' because they 
have to be in a certain place at a certain time (historically
speaking).

Similarly \'tramp\' does not apply to just to the little independents.
Any vessel which picks up a cargo in one port, takes it to another
port where it picks up a second cargo etc works according on the
tramp principle. I think the distinction you\'re looking for is whether
or not the cargo is organised one they reach their destination.

Many current shipping corporations work on this model - an oil tanker
may pick up a cargo in the Persian Gulf, transport it to the US where
it will pick up a second cargo for South Africa and so on. The companies
have the cargoes arranged in advance, but the ship isn\'t generally 
just running between two specific ports.

I\'ve always used Charisma (although to avoid confusion, Vargr "Charisma" was
changed to "Social Standing" since it reflected society\'s view of the Vargr;
and a separate \'physical attractiveness\' Charisma was given instead).

Most skills where SS could be used, players can use CH so long as I can see
a justification. They *could* get away with a glittering disarming smile
when they pick up the wrong knife and fork at a social gathering (high CH,
low SS) but couldn\'t get away with running up to kiss the local monarch...
(some Social rules shouldn\'t be broken, even if you have a wonderful CH or
are from down-under).

You mean this explanation is supposed to be new? Tries jumping up and down

20-odd years (hull grids not this silly coil things - that\'s me). I\'m sure
Marc has always known why Jumps last a week... he did invent the concept
after all!

:-)

It\'s all part of the "maintainance of velocity vector", "can\'t see or
manoeuvre in Jump space", "sealed bubble", "cross fingers before Jumping
because you can\'t change things once you\'re in there" sort of mentality that
I always associated with Jump... then there\'s my "Variable Density Jump
Dimension" theory which (through analogy) tries to explain why a Jump is one
week long without needing to worry about things cooling down... I think that
was sent with my thrusters document to IG back when they were first
developing T4.

Maybe it\'s just my sad English sarcastic/ironic/depressive mentality that I
can\'t quite see what the excitement\'s about? =8-)

A very humble request...

============
PLEASE DON\'T.
============

Kenneth, please choose one other person as an \'arbitor\' (perhaps Allen
Shock?) and get people to copy the two of you with every idea they\'ve ever
had on tasks.

Then in a year\'s time you (and the arbitor) can come back to the TML with
each of your amalgamations of peoples\' ideas. People can then vote (directly
back to you) which of the systems they prefer.

That way we can avoid this constant round-in-circles "I thought of it
first", "Skills are more important than Stats" arguments.

It\'s quite clear that a number of people are still using other systems like
MT and sometimes TNE. I\'ve been demonstrating the new Traveller to loads of
newbies and every one of them has agreed that the system\'s simplicity is
great. I also explain to them how they can add extra dice to the
difficulties or ignore half-dice if they want to, and they think that
flexibility is great too.

Marc has very clear views on how he wants T4 to go, and although I know he\'s
open to influence, I think one should be careful about assuming that because
a limited number of people (say 5 or 10) on the TML speak up for a given
system, that it is the best. Realistically the entire TML is only 400-500
people whereas 30,000 plus rule books have been sold, thus we are but a
*VERY* small minority who just happen to have a very easy way of vocalising
our thoughts direct to Marc Miller.

My other thought, though I hate to admit it, is that putting out a \'fixed\'
task system for T4 so soon after its release is rather like admitting failure.

What I *did* strongly advocate in the CORE Proposal to IG was that one of
the books should be a Player\'s book which - in addition to a wedge-load of
other stuff - included *several* optional task systems which one could use
instead of the original one, *if* the players and referee wished to do so.
This would mean the T4 system wasn\'t \'invalidated\' officially, but that
players could use other systems if they wanted to do so (in the same way
that there are many \'add on\'/\'upgrade\' rules for AD&D ed2, etc.).

So, Kenneth, if you wanted to act as amalgamator of *all* task rules systems
then perhaps - if the TML yells at Marc loud enough - they might see the
light of day in an official IG publication?

The Steward ability should also include cooking. Just who does the cooking

As a player of LOTS of games where rolling low is good (any using
percentage, FGU games etc) I prefer rolling low. Nothing like rolling a 1
in Bushido or rolling 01 in CoC. 
In regards to the 20 in DnD, I don\'t actually recall there being such a
rule. I know lots of people (including us) who  had it as a house rule thru.

 No, I don\'t believe that - obviously you can get more passangers (on a
high-pop world at least) by running a scheduled service and investing in
things like advertising and booking offices. However, this isn\'t the sort
of thing done by tramp trading ships working the fringes - which is the
sort of ship (and => economic model) the competition was based around.

 Your design is great for shipping lines interested in offering a low-end,
budget alternitive to Tukera (the Traveller equivalent of going by bus?),
but it makes a bad far trader. Sorry.

 Neither was the neccessity of a maneuver drive (or rather, the lack of
"far-trader tenders"), but you managed to work that one out OK (Hmmmmm...
a cargo line relying on tenders - an interesting idea, neh?). 

 Demand for staterooms and cargo-space should be the _first_ thing you
look at when designing a commercial ship.

 Just a name that sprang to mind - it may or may not bear a resemblence to
the company that advertises itself with slogans such as "so economical,
you\'ll think you\'re part of the crew!".

 I know - that was my entry :). I redesigned it this evening using

I think that variable dice actually help the SS/SF rules in T4.

        I recieved 7 ballots; however, some designs, due to late

What the heck are you talking about?

I wasn\'t looking for task system ideas, and you are way off 
base on what I was asking.  I posted 6 questions for TMLers to 
answer.

The point was to get a consensus, or at least as close to a 
consensus, on some basic definitions.

I didn\'t want to do a lot of work based on those definitions only to 
find out later that many people disagreed with those assumptions.

That\'s all.

Why don\'t you read the post next time before you hit the key board?

Sheesh.  It\'s a good thing that I have a thick skin.

You are comparing this to MT, right?  On the skill list, are you 
counting all those individual weapon skills that are neatly bundled 
into a few skills in T4?

Also, you haven\'t quite answered my question.  I\'m not asking if T4 
has a better skill list.  I\'m asking if each individual skill level 
is valued the same as a CT or MT skill.

Take Medical, for example.  Does Medical-3 in T4 equal the same 
amount of skill prowess as Medical-3 in MT or CT?

        Hey... if the target was undead, that doesn\'t seem so wierd, now
does it :)?

        You\'ll note that I was not advocating the wholesale adoption, just
taking a look at how it works.  One of the areas in which I find
StoryTeller somewhat deficient is in its combat system...  especially soak
rolls, which are great for reducing the effects of damage upon supernatural
beasties, but IMHO are abused on human characters.  So what I did when
running it was eliminate soaking against gunfire unless you\'re undead,
increase the difficulty on soak rolls against knives to 8 (up from 6), and
IIRC decreased the difficulty on firearm damage rolls to 5.

        Makes a world of difference...  Doing it again, I would have soak
rolls on a descending order of difficulty depending on impact force; guns
impossible, 9 for attacks with axes, big swords etc, 8 for other bladed
weapons and heavy blunt objects, and 7 for blunt objects that aren\'t
primarily intended to kill; brawling attacks are soaked at 6.  This IMHO
aside from being way off-topic would also fix the soaking system quite
nicely...

If Marc Miller and other game designers thought this way, you\'d have 
a lackluster game that suffers from lack of thought--talk about game 
mechanics problems.

"Hey, Billy Bob.  The task difficulty is so low that everybody 
succeeds even if they are not skilled.  What do you want to do about 
it?"

"Ah, heck, Rufus, I dunno.  Make\'em throw more dice for the 
difficulty."

"How many more dice?"

"Whatever you want.  I few I guess."

It is because people put this type of thought into the game that you 
are able to sit back and enjoy it as much as you do.

If something was broken, I bet that you would sure gripe about it.  
The mechanics thinkers try to ensure that you won\'t have this 
problem.

But how significant is significant? And do the statistics in T4 correlate
specifically to those required for given tasks? For example, (to use a
physical example) does the fact that I have an aptitude for martial arts
(based on DEX) imply that I have a similar talent for juggling (again based
on DEX)? Or knife throwing? Can you equate language aptitude and math
aptitude? While the same person could likely do *either* I contend that
*WITHOUT TRAINING* they can\'t do *BOTH*.

My biggest problem with the T4 system as it stands is that (IMHO) it
INAPPROPRIATELY weights the statistic over the skill. I never said that the
stat was unimportant.

But there should be an alternate rule for those of us who don\'t feel
similarly to Marc, and still want to play T4. I mean, doesn\'t it behoove the
author and guiding light to encompass as many GM philosophies as is easily
doable? Especially since this is such a small thing and would take about 1/2
a sidebar.

I agree with you that this thread is beginning to stagnate. I mean everyone
really agrees on some fundamental level; just some agree more than others,
but then agin the purpose of the list is to hammer out these sorts of
questions, right?

        Well, "bell curve" is only a name, and it is usually abused. The
strict, rigorous mathematics texts should not use it but for explainations.
Usually, it\'s true, it refers to the shape of a normal distribution, i.e.
related to the function exp(-x*x), and so it is obvious that 2D_ can never
produce a "bell shape", because the probabilities came out of certain
combinatorial numbers. So, yes, you are right, and almost all of us (me
included) have mis-used the term "bell" at one time or another.
        Kenneth, trust me, I\'m a mathematician ;-).

Actually, "Prince Valiant" is the oldest game you could call an RPG, having
come out several years before D&D, even before "Chainmail."  It was
primitive (dice made from bits of mastadon bone as I recall), but still an
RPG. :)

I did a variety of Scientist careers for CT a number of years ago,
including Xenobiologist, Archeologist, Physicist, Sophontocist (replaces
psychologist :) ).  If I still have these I\'ll post them to the TML if
anyone is interested.

FWIW, I avoided careers and skills that seemed to have no benefit to a
Traveller character.  I don\'t know about you, but for me running a
character who has something like Architecture-5 (or even Steward-3) is a
real bore.

This is an excellent point, and indicates that maybe the correct place for
the fix is in character generation: put the skills on the same scale as
attributes.  This would balance the importance of skills and attributes in
game play, make in-game calculations significantly easier, and probably do
away with the need to record intermediate numbers on scratch sheets.

This could also make for better granularity in chargen.  If you wanted to
you could make a table showing how many points you increase each time you
get a skill during character generation, as:

Number of times skill encountered:  1   2   3   4   5   6
Additional points gained in skill:  1   2   4   3   3   2

This is just off the top of my head, but I like this table.  It shows a
nice quasi-bell-shaped progression in proficiency (skewed toward the side
of skill acquisition, which is arguably realistic), and both the average
and maximum proficiencies don\'t change: a character with a skill-3 would
now have skill-7, while a character in T4 with skill-6 would have skill-15,
corresponding to someone having attribute-15.

Thoughts?

I don\'t think we need another stat here, nor should Soc be made variable
(this reminds me of the specious old AD&D alignment argument, that "good"
is entirely relative to the society you live in).  

Soc should remain some measure of your standing in a fairly stratified
society, like the Imperium.  Of course, on some worlds this won\'t count for
much; no one\'s going to bow and scrape to your Soc-14 character in some
tavern on a rough backwater world.  Pirates, smugglers, and such are among
those who are successful *despite* their (almost by definition) low Soc.
Their notoriety depends on their deeds and reputation, not on what family
they were born into or even how incredibly good they are at a skill like
piloting.  You could be an unremarkable smuggler just because you\'re
unlucky or unwilling to take on dangerous cargo in odd situations, despite
the fact that your Soc is 2 and your piloting and trading skills are
excellent.  

IMHO, of course.

OoOoOoOoh. I like this.  Not only does it give me a semi-rational
explanation (much more satisfying than "just because"), but it also opens
up all kinds of potential game developments:  What would a new jump engine
development be worth to the military, if you could suddenly predict this
reaction time to 168 hours +/- 1% or even better, instead of 10%?  What if
there were regions of normal-space that for some reason accelerated or
slowed the jump-reaction?  What if someone made a device that prevented
this reaction from taking place (a jump-dampening field) or caused it to
stop suddenly with a corresponding release of energy?  What if someone came
up with a new compound (a yttrium and copper clathrate surrounding a rare
lanthanum isotope, say :) ) that is even more efficient than straight
lanthanum?  

I\'m sure there are scads of other ideas surrounding jump technology that
could be used as the seeds of solid scenarios, perhaps even to the players\'
benefit ("sure the new engine is noisy and the grid looks funny, but you
should see the cops\' faces when we go into jump at about 100 meters over
the planet\'s surface!").

Thanks very much for that explanation.  Pseudo-science is _so_ much fun. :)

                                            -"Wizards"


        I\'ve been following the task system thread for some time now, and
want to thank everybody for opening my eyes to the ramifications of the
current task system.  The current system has a great advantage in elegance
(half-dice notwithstanding) and speed, but, as has been oft said, it puts
way too much weight on attributes versus skills, which is unrealistic.  A
"skill" represents a body of information and experience regarding the
performance of certain activities (e.g. piloting, gunnery, brawling, etc.).
By acquiring more skill, an individual presumably has gained enough pratice,
instruction, and experience to know the most effecient and successful
methods of performing the related tasks.  High personal attributes make
tasks easier to complete, because of sheer raw capability, but without the
benefits of training and experience an individual is likely to make mistakes
that a more more skilled person would avoid.  I, for instance, have been
fencing for nearly fifteen years, using a wide variety of blades.  I can
defeat physically superior but less-experienced opponents  simply because
I\'ve learned more about the art of swordplay than they- I can read their
intentions and employ a countermove at the moment they begin an attack.  By
the same token, I\'m a pretty good shot with a rifle, but while my dexterity
is somewhat greater than my buddy the Marine marksman, he can shoot with an
accuracy that leaves me shaking my head in humble wonder.
        I see skills as a framework of education and experience (sometimes
painful experience) that optimizes a character\'s chances of acheiving a
specific task.  A skill provides knowledge that allows an individual to
avoid making many basic mistakes, and choose the most effecient course of
action in acheiving a desired result.  A higher-skilled character is much
farther ahead on the learning curve than an unskilled one.  A man who has
high hand-eye coordination could control a handgun well and shoot fairly
accurately, whereas a man with pistol training and four years\' experience
would know to take into account his weapon\'s unique quirks, as well as
environmental modifiers (wind, range, etc.) to optimize his chances to hit.
        Skills enhance and amplify raw ability.  A high level of skill and
experience would allow an individual to make the most of his or her
abilities.  Thus, I would like to propose the following system, treating
skill levels as a multiplier of attribute levels:

Difficulty Rolls:
Easy (yawn): 1D (1-6)
Average: 2D (2-12)
Difficult: 4D (4-24)
Formidable: 6D (6-36)
Staggering: 8D (8-48)
Near-Impossible (I wouldn\'t, if I were you...): 10D (10-100)

Task Roll Success= Difficulty Roll<(Attribute*Skill Level)
Critical Failure: three or more 6\'s, regardless of difficulty.
Spectacular success: three or more 1\'s, regardless of difficulty.
note; 1\'s and 6\'s in the same roll cancel one another out on a one for one
basis for the purposes of determining critical success/failure.

Example:
        Luke Skywalker has just joined the Rebel Alliance, and for some
reason they\'ve decided to send the kid on possibly the most important
starfighter mission of the war (never mind the fact that the kid has never
flown an X-Wing in his life, but I digress...).  Let\'s say that Luke has a
high dex (10), and all that time bagging womp rats has given him a Pilot
skill of 2.  Now let\'s look at Red Leader, who by all accounts is an older
and highly-regarded pilot.  Being older (and not the hero of the story),
let\'s us assign him an above average dex (8), but because he\'s been flying
fighters since Luke was in diapers, we\'ll give him a Pilot skill of 5.  Now,
under my system, this gives Luke a base target number of 20 (dex multiplied
by skill level, or 10*2), but Red Leader, who is less-coordinated but more
experienced, gets a target number of 40 (8*5).  Red Leader knows his ship
better than Luke at this point, and can make it do things the farm kid from
Tatooine has never even heard of, and thus has the edge, despite his lower
raw ability.  
     
        The upsides of this system are:
1.) No half-dice.
2.) It\'s easy and quick to work out target numbers.
3.) It allows low-stat characters to stand toe-to-toe with high-stat
characters, and hopefully allow more character
     diversity and uniqueness.
4.) It involves few changes to the existing systems.

        The downsides of this system are:
1.) HUGE base target numbers.  A character with a stat of 12 and a skill of
3 would have a base target of 36, which
     would make anything less than a staggering task a walk in the park.  A
counterbalance to this would be critical
     failure/success and situational modifiers.  Under this system, you
can\'t crit on tasks less than difficult, but
     then again, how do you critically fail to start a car, or log on to a
computer?  Also, it is important to remember
     that the Difficulty Rolls are based on AVERAGE characters with stats of
7.  A character with a stat of 12 is
     closer to twice that level of ability, and thus should be generally
able to accomplish tasks that an average 
     person would find daunting.
2.) Lots and lots of dice rolling.

        A final note on crit failure/success- yes, my rule means that there
is a greater chance of failure (or success) as the tasks become more
difficult, but that adds a level of risk that is intended to give any
character pause.  Sure, a character with a dexterity of 11 and an Athletics
of 2  has a base chance of 22 to leap from the edge of the building and grab
the departing helicopter\'s landing skid (a Formidable task, by my
adjudication).  If he succeeds, he manages something worthy of any action
hero, but if he fails...  So the question is, do ya feel lucky?  Do ya?
        In closing, I would like to point out that this rationale has been
worked out from a character play standpoint rather than a statistical model.
Frankly, my math sucks.  If there are glaring statistical problems with this
proposal, then I apologise in advance.  I look forward to
analysis/comments/napalm attacks on this idea.

Actually in my game I have taken this even further, to help explain 
what the heck the engineers are doing during jump...  In my game 
the jump grid doesn\'t cool evenly.  In fact, the larger the grid,
the more problems you have with keeping the grid even.  This means
that on a 100 ton ship, checks every 8 or 9 hours are sufficient
to keep things kosher (assuming it\'s in good shape), but a 200 ton
ship requires checks every 4 or 5 hours, and buy the time you get
to a 50KdT warship, a full engineering watch is required 24 hours 
a day to keep the grid balanced as it cools.  Hmm, does this help 
explain the standard ship crew requirements?

Sorry to disagree with you again, Ken. According to "HEROIC WORLDS A History
and Guide to Role-Playing Games" by Lawrence Schick (Prometheus Books 1991),
the games which followed closely on the heels of D&D were BOOT HILL (TSR),
EN GARDE (GDW), TUNNELS AND TROLLS (Flying BUffalo) and EMPIRE OF THE PETAL
THRONE (TSR).
All these were released in 1975. STARFARING, a short-lived SFRPG using the
T&T system, debuted in late 1976, making it nominally the first SFRPG. It
dissapeared rather quickly from the market the next summer when TRAVELLER
appeared. Since TRAVELLER came out in 1977 and RUNEQUEST did not appear
until 1978, TRAVELLER does hold the distinction of introducing the concept
of character skills. So, while TRAVELLER was technically not the first
SFRPG, it was the first SUCCESSFUL RPG and a true pioneer in the hobby. But
it definitley was not the second RPG ever released.

Oh, and SPACE QUEST debuted shortly after TRAVELLER.

voyage:
	Average, INT + Cooking (or Steward -1),
	If no parsley is on hand, Difficult
	If serving to high passenger/ SOC 9+, Very Difficult

- -Finding the can opener for meals bought at the last Class D Starport
the ship stopped at
(during last part of second week of voyage):
	Difficult, INT + Cooking (or Recon -1)
		1D6 hours, uncertain

- -Preparing survival rations/crackers in inventive ways during third week
of voyage:
	Very Difficult, SOC + Cooking (or Survival -2)
		4D6+D3 minutes, fateful

- -Failing any of these rolls (mmmmm... rolls) results in the following
penalties:
	1st failure:	no tip (deduct 3D6 Cr from pay)
	2nd failure	no tip, complaint to Captain (as above)
	3rd failure	no tip, goulash splattered on uniform (as above plus
Cr10xD6 cleaning bill)
	4th failure	attacked by D3 passengers/crew.  
	5th failure	bound up and tossed out airlock.

Of course, a can of spray-paint could, in a pinch, also be used as an

I should have clarified further. I am not saying you have to play Traveller
EXACTLY the way Marc writes it. I don\'t even do that. I was referring to the
PUBLISHED Traveller. I have some serious issues with some of the things done
in First Survey, and may be deviating radically from it. But when it comes
to what gets put into the BOOKS, Marc has the final call.

I agree totally with this. I remember the Gygax "You must play AD&D MY way
or it isn\'t AD&D" tirades in the Dragon. I laughed at them then and I still do.

I am continually amazed at the responsiveness of the New IG to their
customers. Courtney Solomon and the others have responded to our complaints
and desires in 
ways that I would not have predicted four months ago. yes, the "machine"
still needs a little oil now and then, but it\'s defintley moving in the
right direction. And they DO accept our input into the game, as evidenced by
both M0 and First Survey. All I\'m saying is that Marc has the final say over
the published product, and from what I saw in what he wrote, he has definite
ideas about the task system that do not mesh with what some of the more
insistent individuals here are saying. I simply want to move along to a
different topic.

I didn\'t claim to be first at anything. In fact, anything I may have posted
on the subject of task systems was strongly influenced by previous

I also strongly urge IG to consider publishing a TRAVELLER COMPANION
featuring all of the best optional rules systems created by people on this
list. And I definitley think Ken\'s task system should be the centerpiece of
that book. Another thing I\'d LOVE to see in there would be a POINT-BASED
character creation system with advantages and disadvantages and tables for
determining the characters personal histories. I would really prefer to be
able to CREATE Traveller characters rather than roll them up. (yes, I know
we can choose rather than roll, but I would still love to see a completely
objective point-based system.)

There are a few things that bug me.  My main problem is that nowhere in the
book is any clue given about the size or membership in the Imperium!  The
only clue we have is the Core stats where various worlds are ID as Sylean
Federation.  Surely there are more worlds than this!

Also, if you look at the worlds of the SF, you\'ll find that most of them are
low population, pre-spaceflight planets.  This hardly seems to be a group
that is ready to go forth a conquor the universe.

A set of small maps showing the growth of the Imperium in 25 year leaps from
0 to 100 would have been nice.

While reading the history section, I kept trying to locate the Chanestin
Kingdom and its capital of Keshi.  No luck.  A similar fate awaited my
search for the Interstellar Confederacy.  I would think that some data
concerning these states would be avilable beyond the brief historical
sketches provided in M:0.

Which brings up another important point:  when, exactly is this book set?
I\'ve found commentary from as far ahead as 36, with many commentaries from
around 20.  What gives?

I will admit it was nice to see my name in the credits as a rumormonger..

On to First Survey.  Only a few gripes here.  I\'ll add my voice to the
general moaning about the small type.. but remember when everybody was
bitching about Alien archive and its BIG print.. you can\'t please everybody.

Vland only has 2000 people living on it?!?  Is this going to be explained,
or is it left as an excercise for the individual GM?  Inow point your
attention to the Shuna system in Lishun: 0227 A385644-E Ag Ni Ri.  Well, now
we know where those TL14 vacc suits are coming from..  Lishun seems to be
heavy in high tech worlds, with several at TL13.  

Once again stellar type seems to have been randomly assigned without regard
for the world.  the worst case I\'ve noticed so far is an Agricultural world
orbiting a M9d.  Gives new meaning to the term "iceberg lettuce."

That\'s what I\'ve found so far.  Overall, I\'m impressed by the work, and find
the books useful, it\'s just these little things that keep nagging at me.

My god, don\'t they teaach *any* history in school these days? :)

In the beginning, TSR created Chainmail.  It was derived from ancients
miniatures rules, adapted to man-to-man scale combat.  Almost as an
afterthought, they tossed in some monster stats.  People loved it.

Sensing a Good Thing, Gygax, Arneson, et al cranked out First Edition D&D
shortly thereafter.  This consisted of three little books in a small
box...a format certain other game companies copied a few years later.  The
three original books were (and here I\'m reaching into the dusty back rooms
of my memory):

  Men and Monsters
  Tunnels and Treasure
  Wilderness and Overland Adventures

I may be utterly wrong about those titles, but the topic areas covered
were as those names imply.  D&D was a runaway hit, but also a rather
rickety framework on which to hang a game.  So TSR began producing
supplements containing rules expansions, new monsters, and general
backround material.  Unlike GDW\'s later pattern with Traveller, these
supplements (the first three, anyway) didn\'t have single themes; each was
a mish-mosh of whatever cool ideas were available at the time.  The first
three were:

  Greyhawk
  Blackmoor
  Eldritch Wizardry

Somewhere around the publication of Blackmoor, Dave Hargrave released
"Arduin Grimoire," a third-party supplement for D&D.  AG was famously
bloody and "Monty Haul"-oriented.  The critical hit table from AG is one
of the enduring classics of the RPG industry...for example, one entry read
"Entire head pulped and splattered over wide area."

At around the same time Traveller was published, TSR released
Metamorphosis Alpha, which someone else here accurately described as "D&D
in space."  This was followed a few years later by Gamma World, which I\'d
in turn describe as "Metamorphosis Alpha on the ground." :)

OK, kids, there\'s your RPG history lecture for today.  Be prepared for a
quiz later this week.

Two bonus points, by the way, for the first person under 30 years of age
to tell me what "TSR" stands for.  No fair peaking at the fine print in
one of their publications!

beautifully demonstrated the nonsence that can occur when
characteristics overwhelm skills.

So far the only reaction I have seen to his post was to laugh with
the humour of it. I think he may well have hit a very valid point 
though, which should be explored further.

Given the assumptions which Kenneth is exploring regarding the
numbers reached by skills and characteristics it looks likely that
characteristic scores will be slightly higher (on average) than
skills.This will give the (few) characteristics a corrspondingly
greater effect than the (many) skills possessed by most characters. 

I have no problem with if this is the direction that Marc (and
Lester?) want the game to go. Where I do have a problem with it is
at the lower limits of this system.

Merrick\'s message clearly (IMO) demonstrated the absurdity of
allowing characteristics to dominate skills where the skill lies
below the "professional" level. Most T4 tasks will be attempted
by the character most likely to succeed in the task. As I see it the
system should be weighted to ensure that at below the "professional"
level the likelihood of success (and the importance of 
characteristic) is reduced.

The T4 system (as published) has a heavy penalty for level-0 skills 
(only certain tasks, and half the characteristic - rounded up). 
Perhaps we should look at a similar penalty being applied as routine 
to all tasks where the skill level is less than "professional". My 
gut feeling is that about a one dice penalty is about right.

   I don\'t know where you learned geometry, but a bell is different from
   a triangle. And the probability distribution for two dice not only
   looks like a triangle because of the histogramming, it /is/ a
   triangle. It has a peak 1/6 high at seven, and decreases /linearly/
   to zero at one and thirteen.

   True; it doesn\'t curve at all.

   It\'s a triangular curve.

Years ago I ran a CT campaign based on Earth circa 2000 or so. In that
campaign mankind had settlements on Mars and some of Jupiter\'s moons.
The PC\'s did all their stuff on Earth itself.

That ran for several months and we all had a lot of fun. With several
billion people on Earth, I had no trouble coming up with adventures.

Right!  I haven\'t heard *anyone* advocate making attributes unimportant.
Just somewhat *less* important than they are right now.

You sound like a candidate for my Aptitude Idea! <G>  I contend that a
character should roll up an Aptitude for each skill when they first
learn/use it.  This Aptitude is the specific natural affinity the
character has for that skill.  Let\'s take Martial Arts and Juggling
(both based mainly on DEX), your target number would include DEX as a
base (an important component that would still dominate the target number
for character\'s with low skill levels, but (for experts) the majority
would could from the character\'s Skill.  If the character had a low
Aptitude for Martial Arts (rolled a -1) then they would increase their
skill by 1d3+(-1) for each skill level (average 1), if they had an
average Aptitude (rolled a 0) then they increase by 1d3+(0) (average 2),
and if they had a high Aptitude (rolled a 1) they increase by 1d3+(1)
(average 3) for each skill level.  This character\'s Juggling Aptitude
would be independent of their Martial Arts Aptitude...or any other
skill\'s Aptitude. 

Advantages:
This method doesn\'t require any division at all. It keeps the basic
Attribute important...especially while skills are at a low level.  It
allows for players with the same skills to advance at different rates,
which is *very* realistic. It allows for some randomness, reflecting the
randomness of nature.  It doesn\'t require the use of 1d3 in actual game
play, with the increased skill numbers you\'ll want to go to whole dice
(I argue for 2/3/4/5/6/..and maybe 7 or 8).  It provides more varied and
interesting characters with only a little more work during Character
Generation.

Disadvantages:
You need to use d3\'s during the Character Generation process. The
Character Sheet needs a place for, and you have to record, an Aptitude
for each skill. Each Skill level increase requires a little math: Total
= Total+1d3+Aptitude, but it\'s only simple addition. The target numbers
do go up, so you\'ll need to raise the number of dice for each difficulty
level.

I\'m open to suggestions on how to improve this idea (how to get rid of
the d3\'s for example), but I\'d like to keep it as simple as possible. 
That means no table lookups, multiplication or division (if possible).

   The target number for a 50% chance on 15 Dice is 52; this is ignoring
   the double-sixes rule. If you use the double-sixes rule, you cannot
   get a 50% to-hit probablity on 15 dice no matter how high your target
   is. A target of 90 would give you a 100% chance of success, if you
   ignored the double-sixes rule. If you kept the double-sixes rule, a
   target of 90 (or 900, or 1 million)  would give you a 26% chance of
   success.

   The odds of rolling 15 or less on 15 dice are 1 in 4.7 times ten to
   the 11th, very close to zero, as you said.

   Hmm. Seems to me that in most (but not all) cases, this will increase
   the probablity of success. I used a concept very similar to this when
   I used MT\'s task system, and it worked well then, and it made JoaT a
   very powerful skill.

   In T4, however, with the new JoaT rules, you make an unskilled
   attempt and add the JoaT level to your target. Since the penalty for
   an unskilled attempt is /usually/ larger than the JoaT skill,
   attempting something with JoaT is usually harder than making a
   skill-0 attempt.

   You are free, of course, to rule JoaT by your own preferences. But it
   seems to me that making JoaT equal to skill-0 (in a large fraction of
   cases) makes it more powerful, not less. (I worry that your fix to the
   T4 rules is inspired, in part, by a misunderstanding of the T4
   rules. Maybe I\'m off base here.)

  QSDS doesn\'t have these - must be a SSDS thing.  I did manage to build

complaint.  Specifically, the UPP listings for the sectors.  The data was 
presented very clearly and concisely, but for some reason the text is very hard 
to read.  Big gobs of tabular data presented in a very fine font makes for 
difficult reading, especially in non-bright light.  I might suggest using a 
darker font (not necessarily a bold font, but not the spidery font used in 
these books).  The regular text was quite readable; it was only the UPP lists 
that presented a problem.

I guess if you are going to have problems with your publications, problems like 
this are much better than some of the earlier problems in the other Imperium 
Games publications.  Its good to see the improvements!

   I have those books too; my copies say "Dungeons and Dragons" on them. 
   They were based on a /wargame/ named "Chainmail". Their names (in
   order of publication) were "Greyhawk", "Blackmoor", "Eldritch
   Wizardry" and "Gods, Demigods, and Heroes".

   But I agree with you; D&D was not the first fantasy RPG. I think that
   was "Empire of the Petal Throne", a cult classic from the early
   seventies. I haven\'t seen it in over a decade. I\'ve never played it
   either, but I\'d like to. I heard various rumors and legends about why
   it never became a hit, some of them quite spiteful.

   The only other RPG I knew of in 1978 was Traveller, so it may
   possibly be the third RPG ever published. But I haven\'t done an
   extensive literature search. 8^) Seriously, though, after people
   first heard of D&D (the first popular RPG), everybody and his brother
   was designing their own variant. How many of these ever saw a
   printing press may be hard to estimate.

    'body' => 'I\'ve been following with interest the ongoing conversation on trade
economics and categories.  I offer the following definitions for further
commentary.  Note that none is intended to be hard and fast, or "official"
within the Imperium; these are more the way terms would be used in casual
discussions among starship and port personnel.

FREIGHTER
A starship primarily designed for carrying cargo, though it may include
passenger berths as well.  More specifically, \'freighter\' is often used
only for ships which carry bulk cargo under pre-arranged contract on a
fixed route; one of the other terms below is used to describe other ships,
even though they\'re also \'freighters\' by the broad definition.

LINER
A starship primarily designed for carrying passengers, though it may
include cargo as well.

MERCHANT
A freighter which has versatile operating parameters; e.g., it carries
diverse cargoes, perhaps some speculative, may be cover different routes
from time to time, and so forth.

TRADER
A merchant with even more versatile operating parameters; typically a
small vessel which relies on flexibility and trade speculation to make
most of its profits.

"FREE" (as modifier)
A starship which is owned (at least in large part) by its own crewmembers. 

"SUBSIDIZED" (as modifier)  
A starship which is supported by direct government payments in return for
performing some fixed service; e.g., covering a given route of worlds at
some maximum interval.

"TRAMP" (as modifier)
A starship which chooses its itinerary based on availability of cargo and
passengers for various destinations, rather than on a fixed plan or
schedule.  Such a vessel will almost always fall under the "Free Trader"
classifications above; in fact, the terms are almost synonymous. 

***

Note also, by the way, that in any discussion of Traveller trade
economics, one must realize that player characters and their vessels are
going to behave *very* differently from the bulk of starship traffic.  For
example, an average merchant captain (or line operator) will choose where
to send her ship(s) based on pure economics, or a set of contracts, or
whatever; PCs will have these motives, but usually will also have some
more \'heroic\' higher purpose in mind.  A typical scenario in such a
campaign runs like:

"We must return this sacred dagger to the High Skral of Junidy -- and
that\'s way over *here*, 8 parsecs away.  How can we get there, not run
afoul of the A\'an-ke assasins, *and* make a profit on the way...or at
least avoid going broke?" 

In other words, the economic questions run in parallel with campaign
issues, constraining choices and providing good GM "hooks".  This warps
the behavior of PC merchants far out of the mainstream of interstellar
trade, in my view.

   Well, my players haven\'t left the Sylea system yet, but they probably
   will soon. CT produced two excellent in-system campaigns, neither of
   which I have used extensively yet: "Tarsus" and "Beltstrike".

Has anybody used something like this in their games, or in other,

which could be used at a range against non-military electronics has some
potential for me. 
Beside the obvious use against robots and fixed security or communication
devices, you could use it against vehicles (what about a shot against an
Air-Raft, for example ?)

Any ideas?

True Enough except that the rules do not care where the freight wants to go.
You roll freight independant of your final destination.  I\'ve always preferred a 
link to what you get depending on where you are going and some of the recent posts
with freight income linked to origin and destination starports seems fairly good.

That said, it is also interesting to explore the getting a list of cargo with destinations
and making your load out of that list and selecting detination based on cargo carried.

I would have though that the potential income for a trader (free or otherwise) would be be
greater if that trader has a set of contacts he can call on and get cargo / freight from at
each world he calls at.  This would imply that the contacts need to know where the ship
is most likely to go next.

Conversely, each contact would have a large selection of ships he is prepping for and so is
probably almost always able to find a ship that is going where the freight needs to go.

I am firmly of the belief that the Freigth and Cargo system both need the capacity for greater detail.
That extra detail should be made worth while by producing greater profits.  (this will mean that players
that are dead keen of trading and the details will get a reward for any extra effort involved)

* Special Cargo is 2x 30T modules for Modular Cutters

Notes: This is as close as I could come to the CT Broadsword using
           QSDS.  It carries the same number of troops and vehicles as the
CT version.  The crew is twice as large (partially because CT treats the
small craft operators as passengers), so there is less cargo room (only
22T compared to 80T), though one could get most of it back (46 more tons)
by putting the crew and troops in Bunks and the command crew in Small
Staterooms.  I didn\'t do that, since the troops likely would arrive in no
mood to fight, and the CT design didn\'t pack them in so tight.  The CT
ship also had no armor, not an option at 800T in QSDS, so the reduced
cargo area reflects that to some extent.  Of course, this version is over
100MCr cheaper, so it\'s not all bad.
	The only way to get two cutters aboard under QSDS was to put one
in a bay and one externally, and even then it\'s a tight design.  To make
it all fit I had to downgrade the communications system from Advanced to
Improved to get enough surface area, an unacceptable compromise in a
combat ship in my view.  There is room for a Basic communications system
as backup, though I didn\'t include one since the CT description didn\'t
mention it.
	The one major difference is that the CT Broadsword came with a
module for the Modular Cutter that could hold four fighters.  T4 Starships
does not offer this option, so I substituted a cargo module.  This
accounts for some of the cost difference, since a fighter module plus four
fighters would cost from 30 to 59 MCr, depending on the type of fighter
carried.
	What did I learn?  An 800T Sphere (S) in QSDS does not make a good
Happy Fun Ball - fitting in 2 Modular Cutters just leaves too little extra
space.  In CT hangers didn\'t take up near so much space.  I understand
that an SSDS designer could do better by using docking rings, allowing
both cutters to be mounted inside - the only advantage seems to be more
room for surface-mounted equipment.
	I think two landing craft (at least) are needed for redundancy, so
a QSDS designer should probably look at the 1000T Needle Airframe - the
extra room and surface area should allow for a less compromised design. 
The "Happy Fun Pointy Thing?"  Well, maybe.  Anyway, this is not a
Generica Shipyards design - not good enough, in my view. 

	I\'ve included my design sequence below - QSDS 1.5 is used
throughout.  The only fudge is that I used two sensor crew rather than one
- - I thought a military ship should have backup in this area.  To balance,
I allowed only one repair person for the Cutters rather than the two
called for in the rules - since they\'re the same model, I think it makes
sense.  The total crew is thus by the book, aside from the fact I based
command crew on just the crew, not the troops - I treated them as
passengers who cook and clean for themselves (no steward).  Coments on my
math and design decisions would be appreciated.

Well, in fact, the extremely talented medic suffering under a
doctor of mediocre ability and having to defer to him (even
though he can do things just as well, if not better) is
something that has been used more than once in literature.
I find it quite reasonable.  In my career as a Ph. D.
Chemist I\'ve seen talent blow training away more than once.

>Does this make sense to any body else?

What this points up is that everyone is pushing their point of
view as "right".  It goes without saying that if you think
that training is more important than talent, then examples
like this are going to seem "wrong" (just as the will seem
"right" to people with a different point of view).

People can posts as many examples of what they consider
"screwed up" as they want.  Then those who agree will
chime in that it is screwed up and those who don\'t will
disagree.  In the end, nothing will change.

QSDS has \'External Craft Grapples\'...aren\'t those the same as \'Docking

Think nothing of it.  We all get testy here and there.

As for the thread going on too long, in my view, some might be tired 
of it (which is definitely the case from some of the posts), but the 
task we set out to do is not done.

The task system is not fixed.  I\'m going to work at it, whether its 
on the TML or in private, until it is.

Marc\'s coming out with a revised editon, and now is the time to 
vocalized what you think should be fixed.  I am doing that.

Take care,

Well, I should be flattered that you are interested enough in what I 
say to want to read it.

Normally, I don\'t post very much, and when things are hectic with my 
busineess, I don\'t even read the TML.  

I had a few slow days, though, and the task system is something that 
I\'m interested in.  I feel that I can contribute something positive.

So, I\'ve checked the TML a couple of times a day, and it seems that I 
always have five or nine replys to make.

I can see that this adds up for you.

Trust me, I don\'t have the time to keep it up.

First, I didn\'t write that JOT fix.  I just read somebodyelse\'s 
thought, and on first glance, it seemed to be a good rule.

There does seem to be a problem with JOT in T4, and eventhough I\'m 
not actively pursuing a fix, if I run across a good one, I\'ll 
probably use it.

My first glance at the fix told me that the character would be 
penalized because he had to roll twice to achieve the task (once for 
JOT, and once to do the skill), and the character has to roll for 
each and every try.

But you bring up some very good points as well, and it proves to me 
that I\'m going to have to re-think using this as a JOT fix.

Thanks for the good thoughts.

This makes a whole lot of sense to me and is a good extension of

I think that I\'ll start using it, too.  Tell me, how do you come up

	Yes...if you have one of these it could be quite devastating,
except for one thing, \'the defense reciprocity rule\', which is a nifty
term I just made up. Basically, most of human weapons development has been
a leapfrog effort of offense -> better defense -> better offense etc. _ad
infinitum_.

	 If an EMP gun does exist (and they\'re working on them right
now...) defenses against them will be readily available. Of course, this
doesn\'t hold all the time...we\'ve had nuclear bombs for quite some time,
and we\'ve yet to develop a decent countermeasure, other than More and
Bigger ones. But something that could be shielded against, would be, and
the cost of hardening devices against EMP will get quite cheap, especially
since advances in computing speed are running in the same
direction...towards optical circuits, which are quite immune to EMP
effects...that\'s exactly why CT has those Fib computers.

I could definitely see applications for such a device, but it sure isn\'t
going to be a magic wand.

A FGMP-14, now...well that pretty much qualifies as a magic wand ;-)

It\'s a great idea - particularly if you\'re willing to do a bit of work,
and use relatively low-tech spacecraft (reaction drives with only
a couple of G-hours worth of thrust, no contra grav, no grav-focus lasers...
you\'d have to make your own space combat system (maybe take BL and make the
hexes ten times smaller)).

Or do you mean set only in one system but against the Imperium background?
That could be fun to - go for it!

One site I found for nuclear rocketry is:

http://www.roadrunner.com/~mrpbar/rocket.html

it had this to say about one program, the NERVA, solid core nuclear
rocket:

"Solid Core Nuclear Rockets--Rover/NERVA 

The US government began the Rover program in 1956 at the Los Alamos
Scientific Laboratory to develop a nuclear reactor suitable for operation
as a nuclear rocket. In 1963, the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle
Applications, NERVA, program was started to take the graphite based
reactor built at Los Alamos and create a functioning rocket engine. The
programs ran in parallel and involved Los Alamos, Westinghouse, Aerojet,
and other industrial partners. The final engine tested used a core made of
graphite rods 54 inches long, hexagonal in cross section with 0.75 inches
across the flats, and with 19 holes running the full length of the rod.
The rod was a mixture of uranium/zirconium/carbide in a graphite matrix.
Each flow hole was independently orificed to match the heat generation
levels.

During the years from 1956 to termination in 1971, the programs
accomplished the following records:

1) Highest power - 4500 megawatts thermal power

2) 5500 degress Fahrenheit exhaust temperature

3) 250,000 pounds thrust

4) 850 seconds of specific impulse

5) 90 minutes of burn time

6) thrust to weight ratios of 3 to 4

In all, 23 tests were conducted at the Nevada Test Site at the Nuclear
Rocket Development Station, NRDS."

Also at this web site are PDF\'s of two research papers, one about using a
solid core rocket for a Mars mission, and another, the intial concept of a
toroidal gas-core rocket.

And they say you can\'t find useful stuff on the web!

it to put together one more of my "Pocket Empire" analyses of,
this time, the Sylean Federation and its\' competition.  

I\'ve discovered that the map is an utter mess when taken with
the text.  I\'ve also discovered that a fair number of worlds
have moved out of place.  I\'ll start with the Sylean Federation.


WARNING: There are some map spoilers here, so I can demolish
it most effectively.  If you\'re a player, you may want to skip
this message.


  SYLEAN FEDERATION.
     Sylea         A586A98-C   Hi          305  G2V

     Population:     30.1 billion.
     TL per capita:  11.98  (without Sylea, 8.13)
  Note that Sylea has no bases, and contains 99.6% of the
  population of the Federation.  This also conflicts with
  page 44 ("fourteen billion sentients inhabit Sylea").

However, Shudusham isn\'t included in the SF.  This means that
the map is for a time *before* Dawn, because Shudusham joins 
by -25 (the Chanestin Kingdom attacks "the Sylean industrial
world of Shudusham").  Shudusham adds 70 billion people with 
a tech level of 12.  In fact, the map has to be before -30,
when Vland joins, or -50 when regular trade with Vland exists,
or -100 when SFSS scouts return to Vland for the second time,
or we\'d have better data along the route to Vland.

In fact, the Syleans were fighting the Interstellar Confederacy
for five worlds in the second century pre-Imperial (-200 to -100),
so it seems that this map has to be no later than that.  It can\'t
be much earlier, or Sylea probably shouldn\'t be tech-12.

Oh.  Speaking of them.  "The Confederacy centered on three powerful
worlds: Marsus, Protalus, and Sketola (the capital)."  All three 
"rapidly rose to TL12" and were on the Sylean Main.  Ha.

  Marsus     0714 B6A7999-8   Hi     521
  Protalus   0812 B845755-8   Ag     214
  Sketola    0622 B647488-B   Lo     404
   
Marsus might be powerful -- if it was tech-11 instead of 8!  The other
worlds are not.  Marsus and Protalus are nine parsecs, as the slowship
flies, from Sketola.  They\'re in the WRONG SUBSECTOR on the WRONG MAIN.
The Bunkeria subsector (and the IC) appeared in TD 9.  At that time, 
Sketola was 0622, Marsus 0127, and Protalus 0128.  I\'d be more worried
about Fr\'now, which makes all these worlds look like small peanuts
(and, incidentally, has also been moved into a different subsector).

...and as for Keshi/Dunea and their "militaristic rulers with their now-
superior technology":
  
  Keshi      1938 B566200-7   Lo           114

A hundred people at tech-7 with no government?  I don\'t think so.

Let\'s check out the Santry-Cordova worlds, too:

  Santry     1736 B4208AA-C   Na Po De     900
  Cordova    1836 C3409BB-B   In Po De Hi  703

Gee, these worlds are in the *middle* of the Chanestin Kingdom, under
three parsecs from Keshi.  Not only that, but Santry, which supposedly
gets mauled for only having jump-1 ships, seems to have tech-12 (which
should give them jump-3, or at least jump-2 ships).  Then there\'s the
unmentioned Uundi Zi jump-2 away:

  Uundi Zi   2036 A410977-C   Na In Hi     804

On top of all of this, Santry is jump-1 from Cordova!  So who cares
about flanking maneuvers through other systems, high-jump Imperial
fleets assisting one side or another, when their own jump-1 fleets
can jump DIRECTLY from Santry to Cordova!  So much for the war of
strategic maneuver won by high-jump Imperial ships bypassing a fixed
defensive line.

The Syleans should be more worried about the HiPop tech-12 worlds that
are scattered around the map; Uundi Zi, Skeen, Arnaki, Ganshas, Fr\'now,
and Dishadishii.  One good (?) thing was finding the tech-14 vaccuum
world not far from Sylea that must be the source of those high-tech 
vacc suits (but I\'ll leave the location an exercise for the reader).
Also, look for Shibashliim/Cemplas (Core 1524), referred to in the 
text at the end of the sector data.

I\'ve found some other problems, too, but I think that gets the point
across.  Let\'s just say that I\'m not terribly impressed with the 
integration of the map for the new sourcebook.  I\'ll probably be
making my own maps, rather than get First Survey, if this is the
level of thought going into the sector maps.

    'body' => '     Okay, this debate has been going on for awhile and  we\'re seeing the same
arguments being endlessly repeated by both sides, with no new ground being 
broken.  MM obviously wants to keep the system as simple as possible while 
retaining a reasonable level of "realistic feel," and KBv1.1 (and, for that 
matter, every other proposed alternate system) don\'t do that as well as the 
current T4 system-- they increase the complexity more than they increase the 
realistic feel.  However, despite all that, there have been some legitimate 
concerns raised, and therefore I propose two simple rules-fixes to better 
"balance" the current system, and possibly quiet some of the debate.  Note 
that these fixes have appeared before in one form or another, and I\'m not 
trying to take credit for "inventing" them, I\'m just re-stating them to suit 
my own ends.


1.  In character generation, an increase in character attribute (i.e. +1 Dex)
can only occur ONCE per Term (4 years).  If therandom method of determining
skills is employed, the second and subsequent occurence of attribute increase
within the same Term should be re-rolled.

(This is a simple fix to the problem I pointed out yesterday about mini-maxing
players wanting to increase their stats unfairly because of the statistical
advantage that provides.  There\'s no real "new rules" here, and nothing that
will affect 99% of cases, but it does provide an important block to abuse and
therefore I feel it should be included in the rules).


2.  In most circumstances, natural ability is very important to accomplishing
tasks, and can make up for a lack of "formal training," but this is not always
the case.  Occasional technically-oriented tasks will require a certain degree
of knowledge and proficiency that will simply not be available to less-skilled
characters, regardless of their natural "talent."  In these cases, the Task
Profile will include a Mimimum Proficiency Level as follows: Skill Name [N+]
(where N is the MPL), and a character who attempts to attempt the task who does
not have at least that level of expertise will be treated as if he were
Unskilled, i.e. he will only be allowed to employ 1/2 of his controlling
attribute.

    For example, Freddy Medic is a genius (INT 13), but he\'s never bothered
with more than minimal Medical training (Medic-1), whereas Johnny Doctor is
less bright (INT 7), but is a licensed doctor, with several years of training
(Medic-4).  Because of his innate brilliance, under normal circumstances Freddy
is a better medic than Johnny (target 14 vs 11), but in surgery, where more
advanced knowledge and skill is required, Freddy is reduced to guessing and
fumbling (target 8) while Johnny is still comfortably in his element (11).  So,
while Freddy is more effectively able to perform basic medical tasks
(diagnosing illnesses, assessing damage, staunching bleeding, etc), he also
must occasionally defer to his colleague\'s expertise.  This same example 
could also be used with Engineering, Computer, and/or virtually any other 
technically-oriented skill.

NOTE that for most such tasks the MPL will be [3+], defined by the rules as
being "professional level," but for certain extremely demanding tasks, the MPL
might be even higher.  These cases should be rare, however, and the referee
should be careful to differentiate between such cases and those in which the
task is simply extremely difficult (which is handled under the Task Difficulty 
rules).
 
(The absurdity of the high-stat-minimal-skill character being able to best his
more-highly-skilled colleague in every circumstance is the primary basis for
people\'s complaints about skill-devaluation and the inordinate weight placed on
statistics, but this type of situation is only really outlandish in a few
technical-type circumstances-- I can see how a  Dex-14 Rifle-1 character
could consistently best a Dex-6 Rifle-4 one, for instance-- and I think that 
this simple fix/clarification remedies those few problem cases. Again there\'s 
no new rule here that will affect the vast majority of tasks or increase the 
complexity of the base-system in any appreciable way, and this simple fix (one 
or two paragraphs in the rules, one number on a few task descriptions) should
help to clear up a major sticking-point.  Another plus for this idea, I think, 
is that it is consistent with the rules for Unskilled/Default tasks and the 
Jack-of-all-Trades skill description).

(3.  As others have suggested, keep KBv1.1 and other alternate task systems in
mind for inclusion in a possible "rules options" supplement somewhere down the
road.  Undeniably they provide a different feel.  As it currently stands they
also make more sense, but with the above two changes instituted, I don\'t think
that will necessarily be true anymore).

Now, I\'d like to suggest that we put this task-debate away, or at least on the
back-burner, for a while and let MM and the folks at IG concentrate on getting
their revised T4.1 finished and ready for release.  Every day that goes by with
the current, inferior, product on the market, I think, is doing damage to the
reputation and sales potential of the game and the company, and I\'d like to see
that remedied.

With that, I think I\'m done with this topic,

        I\'m currently in the process of brewing something of the sort up:
I\'m tentatively calling it Traveller: 1965, and using an alternate setting:
a sort of Heinlein-meets-Paranoia alternate Cold War history where the
Nazis managed to build a few nukes and ICBMs and wiped Yonkers off the map,
thereby getting the Space Race off to a roaring start a decade early.  I\'m
going to be using a bunch of TL6-8 FF&S designs, the StoryTeller task
system (because it\'s better at schemeing political underhandedness and
paranoia), and my own background that I\'m developing with a friend.  I\'m
aiming at a sort of B-movie Red Scare Elvis-in-a-spacesuit sort of feel; a
dark past future lit by lava lamps and a radioactive glow...

Thoughts?
- ----

  I played in a game once where the characters didn\'t even get to see the
solar system, let alone other stars.  Set on a Red Zone law level F (!)
planet, in character we started the game not even knowing that space
travel was possible.  We got hints as time went on, but the campaign
folded before we managed to escape the planet (which we would have loved
to do considering how much trouble we were in by then).

  The game was cyberpunkish in feel, well before cyberpunk games were
around (I\'d guess we played this campaign around 1981).  We were average
Jills and Joes, turned to life on the run as freedom fighters due to a
computer error.  Star Wars was certainly an influence, since all of us
were psionic to one degree or another (a plot device, as I recall).

  The one scene I remember most clearly was a chase.  My friend Dale
(now a systems programmer, then a chemistry major who loved these new
"personal computers") had rolled the psionic ability of "special" and the
GM allowed him to come up with ideas.  He decided he wanted to have the
computational ability of a Model 1 computer, having read Dune and liking
the idea of Mentats.  We thought this was a silly power, compared to our
own TK and teleport abilities.  Until the chase, that is.  We were running
from the police, who were heavily armed, and all we had were a few
not-very-effective grenades, having run out of psionic powers getting the 
grenades.  When asked what we wanted to do, we dropped some grenades for
the police to run over, but it was such a hard task (and none of us had
grenade skill), that we kept missing.  Dale, who had been silent to this
point, then stated he was going to use his computer abilities to
calculate exactly how long to hold the grenade before dropping it.
Worked like a charm, and our characters were much nicer to his character
after that.

\'Twould have been nice to have had First Survey while making M0.  Gad, if

But, we didn\'t.  And the work suffered because of it.  Hopefully that

Milieu 0 covers the period 0 through 199.  Milieu 200 picks up at 200 and 
will presumably cover the period until the next Milieu book (whatever 
that will be).  If you want a "publication date" for it, to pretend it is 
an Imperial Publication of some sort (like the old CT adventures with 
their official dates), assuming sometime around year 40 would probably be 
okay.  IIRC, we were supposed to leave off sometime around there - far 
enough past year 0 to get a little perspective in some of the articles, 
but not so far as to give away everything that happens during the first 
200 years of the Imperium. :)  Maybe Andy recalls more specifically what

Admittedly, this is a wild stab in the dark. I\'m 29 years old and I once
owned the 8.5 x 11 Basic D&D boxed set published some time in the late 70s.

I vaguely remember knowing what TSR meant at one time before I matured and
bailed on the game for Traveller in 1980 at the tender age of 13.

Nonsense.  Joe will beat Dianna in *any* Dex driven surgery,
regardless of whether or not he has ever even seen the proceedure,
as will _any_other_ medical 1 person with better Dexterity.  This is
absurd, sorry.

Two point of target number on an Average task are at most ~10-15% at
the typical target number we\'re talking here (8-11 or so).  Do you
really think anybody who can do BCLS or ACLS and dress a wound is
80% the surgeon that any general surgeon is?  Sorry, this is silly.

This example can\'t seem right to anybody.  My point wasn\'t that the
die rolling system was wrong, it was that _task_levels_ are set in a
sloppy way.  To address what you think is the answer to the story I
told above, it seems that a Medic skill would be a different skill
than Medical (or Surgical, for that matter).  So we might have a
situation where a Medical 5 person has a rougher go on a nasty
battlefield trauma than the Medic 3 EMT.  Simple.  But I\'ll stand by
the surgery example.

You managed to miss the whole point of my post.  I was suggesting
that we set tasks better.  The task example I posted was an abuse of
the system----bad reffing, IMHO.  I think that the rules should make
some better guidelines so people can write better tasks (I\'d let a
medic have a go at surgery, but he\'d have to study up, and have a
reference or something----and it\'d take longer.)

WRONG!

There was one by Flying Buffalo... Copyright was 1976 onn the copy I have seen.

Tunnels and Trolls also predates Traveller and Post dates D&D (1975). Also
by Flying Buffalo. (BTW, this one, I just looked up in my copies of T&T).


Traveller was first printed in 1977. Making it the FOURTH RPG, and the
SECOND SFRPG.

CT/MT 18 yo was a 7, and average fell around 8.xx when friends and I did
the stat run on Sup 1 and Sup 4 a few years back., so no, ken, the "Average
imperial" as represented by published materials is around 8 in CT, MT, and
T4; in TNE average was a 6, as TNE didn\'t give as many chances to raise
attributes.

No, to CT. See my post of a few days back. MT has about 85 DISCRETE skills,
and about 120 entries on it\'s skill list (including all the "specific
weapon types" for CT compatability). T4 has around 1.5 times as many skills
recieved as MT.

Supposedly. But under T4, there will be more persons with such skill levels.

Truth be told, In PLAY it felt like a T4 level 5-6 was equivalent to MT
levels 3-4. The math also suggests a comparison of 2 MT levels equals 3 T4
levels.

And T4\'s Medical/First Aid dichotomy also presents a comparison problem. I
*L*I*K*E* the dichotomy. So much so that I\'m working it into MT.

Just for reference, I last played MT as a player in 88, as a GM in 96. CT
Player in 96, ref in 87. T4 only as ref. TNE ref only last in 95. I feel
the differences as a GM quite tightly... and looked at the skill lists for
all the systems before pointing out the lengths.

T4, TNE, and MT all have comparable skill lists, in both detail level and
length. They differ in content, however. CT\'s is about 2/3 MT, but I don\'t
count the stuff in books 4-8 in that figure. CT with books 4-8 has almost
the same skill list as MT, but doesn\'t have the "catch-all" weapon skills.
Every version has given me a better idea of the previous version\'s skill
list. Oh, btw, I don\'t count the extra skills in any of the TNE, CT or MT
alien modules in the skill lists.

Is that better, kenneth? (Really, I AM trying to help. Might not SEEM that
way at times...)

Glad to hear it. True, it wasn\'t designed for such high skill levels, but
that\'s for you do deal with :) .

The extra die is an interesting touch. If it adds texture without taking
more time, I\'m all for it. I think the probability of rolling three of the
same is about 6%, with a 0.5% chance of three ones or three sixes. On 2D,
it\'s a 5.6% chance for a Spectacular result.

Of course, as soon as I reposted the thing, I started re-analyzing the
probabilities, with the result that I\'m now considering some major changes,
intended to make it easier to calculate TNs. Also, I think the stat:skill
ratio should be 3:1, not 2:1 as it now stands. This new version will be
useless for your game, as I suspect it won\'t work for skills higher than 10
or so.

Compared to the current version, TNs will be a lot lower at skills of 1-2,
a bit lower from 3 to 5, the same for skill 6, and higher above that.
(FrEx: At Stat=11, the TNs for Skill Levels 1, 2, 3, 4 will become: 11, 14,
21, 24, and so on. Impossible tasks will be out of the reach of PCs with
Skill 1-2 and Stat 10 or less. But that seems acceptable to me.

Finally, I think I\'ll accept fate and draw it up as a TN table - so you
don\'t *have* to muck around with any math at all, just check the table
(ick). Adding and subtracting modifiers in "base 6" can be really annoying
(it\'s not even *really* base 6, it\'s a bit weirder than that...). The
strange math is the main flaw in the system. Otherwise I like it for its
strict regularity.

My original plan was for something exceedingly easy and straitforward.
Like: "Difficulty level = the first digit of the TN; the Skill = the second
digit. Then add attribute mods." This seemed perfect at first thought,
because there are six levels of difficulty, and skills are rarely higher
than 6 in T4. Of course, the problem with this idea was the 1:1 skill to
stat ratio, and the difficulty of doing math in "base 6". I was tempted to
do it as a D10 system, but the farther we stray from T4, the harder it is
to convert everything. Even as it is, my system is incompatible with the T4
Multiple Actions rule, for instance.

Will post the new version soon.

Thanks for the comments!

You make a very good point. There is one potential drawback to your 
solution: what about poor slobs that have really low attributes to begin 
with? Should they be penalized as much as someone who has a 12 and wants 
to raise it to 13? Also, there\'s the bookkeeping involved in keeping 
track of how many attribute "points" have been accumulated.

I\'m going to reiterate a suggestion I\'ve made w.r.t. attribute increases.

If a player chooses an attribute increase, make him/her roll a "success 
throw":

Roll: 3D6-3
The number needs to be greater than current attribute in order to 
increase it one point.

Since there\'s a 50% chance of rolling 8+ on 3d6-3, those with an 
attribute of 7 (average) have a 50/50 chance of gaining a point. Chances 
drop dramatically as attributes increase. (There\'s that amazing bell 
curve again! ;-P)

So, super-characters with attributes of 15 become a whooole lot rarer.

I see this "success throw" as once again shifting the emphasis on skills, 
but keeping the attributes important. During generation, is someone with 
an above-average attribute going to risk the throw and miss out on his 
skill? If someone fails a throw or two, maybe she\'ll decide to stick with 
the "sure thing" and pick an interesting or important skill.

Whattya think? Does 3d6-3 make a good curve for gaining points? Does this 
char-gen modification put attribute and skill selection on more equal 
footing?

I guess some people want a little more explaination than "it\'s that way 
\'cuz Marc said so". Me, I\'ve always advocated not changing the rules 
unless there\'s a darn good reason, and back when Ken had crazy ideas 
about basing jump times on the power of the drive, he said something like 
"unless someone can come up with a logical pseudo-scientific 
explanation..."

Not being one to turn down a challenge, and also wincing at the "heresy" 
Ken was committing by changing the one week rule Marc handed down from on 
high, upon which all of Traveller history was based, I expounded my 
theory.

Sure, nothing\'s new, I\'m not *changing* anything. Just adding 
versimilitude and -- what\'s that word others have used? Bullshittium. ya, 
that\'s it. I kept the "jump mentality", as you put it, in mind when I 
invented the explanation.

BTW, I\'m interested in hearing your "Variable Density Jump Dimension" 
theory...

>Maybe it\'s just my sad English sarcastic/ironic/depressive mentality that I
>can\'t quite see what the excitement\'s about? =8-)

Well, as Mike Sellers has pointed out in another post, one thing about 
coming up with pseudo-scientific logical explanations is that they invite 
logical extensions: Loopholes!

If one assumes the one week jump time is based upon limitations in 
technology and materials, then ultra-high tech Yaskoydray types can strap 
a jumpsuit laced with a "yttrium and copper clathrate surrounding a rare 
lanthanum isotope" and \'port to wherever they want in a matter of hours.

Sometimes, the explanation answers other questions... for instance, If 
the grid needs to cool down so the field drops and the ship enters normal 
space, than it\'s probably a good idea to make sure the field drops 
symmetrically. That gives the engineers something to do in jumpspace: 
Monitoring the grid and the field. So the question "What the heck do the 
engineers do once the ship is in jumpspace?" is answered.

If boring, pseudo-science technobabble doesn\'t interest a 
sarcastic/ironic/depressive person such as yourself, I guess you must 
really hate Star Trek episodes, eh? >:-)

There is some speculation that the NERVA rocket was used in a 
flight testbed in Texas.  There was UFO (Note, I didn\'t say Martian
Invaders) overflight of a remote highway, in which the occupants of 
a car stopped to look at a flaming object crossing the sky at very 
low altitude.  These two women suffered from radiation poisoning 
and the paint on their car bubbled off.  Shortly after the object
crossed the road, a bunch of military helicopters flew by in the same
direction.  The D.O.D. denies the allegation that they ever flight
tested a nuclear rocket however.

MT used the same rules as T4.  Collapsible tanks had to pump the fuel into
the ships normal tanks before use.  Dismountable tanks (or external tanks)
can be used directly by the drives (which I assume means Jump Drive as well
as Power Plant).

Of course MT ships have the advantage that their power plants are so
inefficient, and the jump fuel volume smaller that you can normally do a
second jump from your power plant fuel if you are willing to lose some
endurance (or have no choice).

All RAAM-Page Warhead Modules warheads have a timer and contact detonation
systems and is included in cost. 

Each module is packaged so to deliver the optimal dispersal pattern to the
targets\' area.

Damage is for contact hit, proximity damage will less. Due to number of
warheads the FCS difficulty is not increased.

Typically RAAM ships the RAAM-Page Warhead Modules with the "Bubba" and
"Little Bubba" Missile/Torpedoes.

Pete has us in the Glisten system and swears we will never get to leave

Then I\'d say you should probably take your two bonus points and see if you

Just a little point here.  You couldn\'t look in a modern publication from
TSR, as the official company name now is "TSR, Inc".  The Tactical Stuides
Rules part was dropped a while back.

Just though I\'d drop in this completely off-topic comment :)

*WOW!*

This sounds a *LOT* like something I read about in "Scientific American" a
while ago: a supersonic, low-altitude, robotic bomber, powered by an
atomic ram-jet (essentially an unshielded fission reactor).  According to
the article, the bomber (or, if you prefer, "cruise missle") was never
assembled and flown, but its engine was test-fired, by running compressed
air (stored in hundreds of meters of pipe) through it.  I don\'t trust my
memory, but I think the project was called "S.L.A.M." (which stood for
supersonic low-altitude missle, or some such thing), the atomic ram-jet
engine itself was called "Project Pluto," and the ungodly thing somehow
got the nickname "the flying crowbar."  I also recall reading that one
plan was to program the thing to fly back and forth over its target area
after delivering its payload of bombs, spewing radioactive debris...

Does this bit of late-\'50s/early-\'60s Cold War lunacy sound familiar to
anyone, or is some Zhodani practical joker playing with my memory?

I believe that the QSDS and other design systems should be modified to
state (or tabulate) this cost explicitly.

<spoiler warning!>

   Wrong.  The film takes place starting on the 50th anniversary of the
Roswell Incident and concludes on July 4th.  As it turns out the Roswell
Incident involved one of their scouting parties, which left a
scout/fighter craft behind.  Assuming near C travel, the aliens were 25
light years (more or less) away and came to rape Earth of its adundant
resources.

   Apparently no one told the aliens that everything they could get here
was available in our asteroid belt, and they could have mined it without
having to worry about a run in with the natives.

   The Americans may have figured out how to kill the aliens, but it was
up to the other countries of the world to do most of the fighting.  I
knew it was all over for the aliens when I saw the scene where the Iraqi
and Israeli pilots were working together to prepare for the final
mission.  Anytime you see Iraqis and Israelis agreeing on being your
common enemy, surrender NOW.

   As for the President, he was a decorated pilot from the Gulf War. 
Since this was supposed to be a kind of Last Stand, you would expect
that *anyone* who could fly an airplane straight would be handed the key
to a brand new Hornet.  Besides, it\'s not like other heads of state
haven\'t lead their armies into battle before.

   Right.  Better that all movies involve people sitting around in a
dimly lit room discussing their inner angst, or some deep seated social
concern that is troubling them to the point of suicide or apathy.  Lord
knows that Monty Python reaches me at numerous emotional levels, some I
can only barely perceive in a semi-concious way.  

   Look, the plot has holes large enough in it to drive a lorry (truck)
through.  Parts of the film are not particularly realistic, though the
special effects are in a word, tremendous.  Propaganda?  You\'re
assumption is that Hollywood films are written and produced with the
idea of turning everyone into Americans.  If only the pseudo fine arts
crowd in Hollywood was bright enough to conceive of such a conspiracy!  

   ID4 was created for American audiences.  If you as a citizen of
another country found it entertaining, wonderful, if not, well...you
weren\'t the target audience anyway.  I didn\'t get some of the political
humor references in the old Benny Hill series (created for British TV)
either, but then those jokes weren\'t put in for Americans anyway.

Regards,

Harold

P.S.  This discussion does raise an interesting point though.  What do
Vilani see when they watch Terran/Solomani entertainment programs? 
Would they laugh at the same things?  How much of humor (love, etc.) is
universal and how much of it is cultural?

This is not exactly true... even in Kbv1.1 stats are still dominant. The
halved stat gets applied to many different tasks and the doubled skill only
gets applied to its own tasks. Stats are still valued over skills. The
difference is that in KBv1.1 skills actually have a significant impact on
the target number, while in the T4 system skills are insignificant, so long
as you have at least a skill 1.

Consider this; why is it that having at least a skill 1 is so important? If
stats are supposed to be so overwhelming, why does it matter if your skill
is 1 or 0? It certainly makes little difference if your skill is 1 or 2.
The writers wanted to make untrained skill use really hard; how could they
do that if \'training\' makes practically no difference to your target
number? Take a look on page 49. They don\'t use a skill of zero, or even a
negative skill. They don\'t increase the difficulty level, or use heavy
negative DMs. High stats easily overwhelm all such considerations. So how
do the rules make a task REALLY difficult?

It says to divide the stat by 2.

I just picked up MO, and noticed one error right off the bat ;)

The "With Thanks to:" credits are missing ... me.

When Marc first started asking opinions about the 
Imperium\'s founding document, I suggested the title
"Warrant of Restoration."  

"Edict," "Proclamation," and such seemed pretty dry
and over-used. Since "Warrant" already had a
history of usage in Traveller, and its definition
included something like this, it seemed a good pick.
And the whole point of a *Third* Imperium was to
lay claim th the past glories (and past territories)
of the previous two.  Cleon wasn\'t creating a new 
Sylean empire, he was restoring the greater Imperial legacy.
Thus, "Warrant of Restoration."

Marc liked it, and thereafter referred to it as such.

Subsequently, Jeff Zeitlin (I think) drew up the actual text.

The Ilthara are human, and thus get an MHR designator.
They had an empire that would still be active in 
Milieu 200: the Imperium crushed it in 268 when it
sided with the Principality of Caledon in the long-

Urlaggash subsector, not Urlaqqash. This is a typo from
FASA\'s FAR TRAVELLER magazine that was carried over by DGP,
apparently they confused the lower case "gg" for "qq".

Pilot\'s Guide to Drexilthar Subsector, by J.A. Keith
(who along with his brother were the original authors of
most Reavers\' Deep material), uses upper case "GG" on the 
sector and subsector maps, making it a bit clearer.

And as long as I\'m playing typo-patrol, Reavers\' Deep
subsector P is "Fahinar", not "Ffalnar" or "Fahlnar", and 
the sector itself is "Reavers\' " (plural possesive) not 
"Reaver\'s" (singular possesive) Deep.

A few notes...
 
TSR stood for Tactical Studies Rules, which is related by happenstance to the name of the Lake Geneva gaming group of the time, the LGTSA, or Lake Geneva Tactical Studies Association.  It was formed by Don Kay and Gary Gygax, and took over some of the titles originally published by Guidon Games, including Chainmail.
 
The Chainmail Fantasy Supplement (which appeared in the 2nd Ed. of Chainmail) was used by Dave Arneson as part of the basis for the "dungeon" expeditions that later were used as the basis of D&D "Rules for Fantastic Medieval Wargames Campaigns Playable with Paper and Pencil and Miniature Figures" by Gygax & Arneson.  The three booklets were:
 
1)  Men & Magic
2)  Monsters & Treasure
3)  The Underworld & Wilderness Adventures
 
"Blackmoor" was the name of the second supplement for D&D, published in 1976.  This was the name of Dave Arneson\'s house campaign, some adventures having been written up in issues of The Strategic Review, the TSR magazine published before The Dragon.
 
Blackmoor as a campaign was produced by Judges Guild as The First Fantasy Campaign, which came out in 1978 or 1979 (I believe).  Arneson later went on to publish his ill-fated Adventures in Fantasy, which came closer to his original idea of what D&D ought to have been, but was left out in the cold by the success of the TSR product.

Traveller was actually at least SF game #3. 

The first was Starfaring, by Ken St. Andre, published by Flying
Buffalo, 1976. No supplements ever published. Died a quick death.

The second was Metamorphosis Alpha, by James Ward, published by TSR,
1976. Later became Gamma World--more or less--which was viable \'til
the end of the eighties, although never real big.

Other non-SF games that came out before Traveller included Boot Hill
(1975), Empire of the Petal Throne (1975, using quasi-D&D), En Garde
(1975), Knights of the Round Table (1976), Monsters! Monsters! (1976,
using quasi-T&T), and Tunnels & Trolls (1975).

And, I couldn\'t even guess when Traveller came out in 1977, the same
year as games such as Superhero: 2044, AD&D, Chivalry & Sorcery, Space
Quest, and Space Patrol.

In any case, Traveller was somewhere between the eighth and fifteenth
RPG, depending on how you count.

GDW\'s early supplement 1001 Characters had a number of famous SF 
characters in the back of the book...Luke Skywalker, Dominic Flandry, 
others.

My first Traveller game freely borrowed from Niven, Anderson, Foster and 
many others.

A. Bertram Chandler had his Commodore Grimes visit an alternative 
universe once where Dominic Flandry was encountered. This could work in 
Traveller for a mis-jump!

Remember, minor authors imitate, great authors steal outright.

I ***still*** have my original Armory dice from 1978 or

Hah! That\'S a good question!
On the one side, culture is SO MUCH MORE than language, that I would
question anyway, how well people from different star-systems could
possibly understand each other.
On the other side, it\'s recently possible on our planet, that people
form different cultures communicate and even deal with each other, and
not trying to eliminate everything and everybody, they don\'t understand.

    'body' => 'In TML 997 Steven Bonneville <bonnevil@cs.umn.edu> asked about the Milieu 0
"Map"

Just to confirm... basically, the Milieu 0 book was written to encapsulate
as much of the previous canon as possible, e.g. the fact that most of the
Core sector was already "known" to the Syleans, plus having pretty much
defeated the Interstellar Confederacy, Chanestin, etc. So all that data can
be regarded as accurate, i.e. the Milieu 0 text is correct.

Unfortunately, the sector data for First Survey was not made available to us
and we were not told how it was generated.

My most humbly submitted suggestions (to bring the two more into line) are:

(a) The maps should be considered to be only what is generally known by the
Sylean citizens and internal far traders. Scouts, military personnel, and
border traders could be given most of the referee data for *whichever
specific area* they have operated in previously or are currently operating
in. Although many such explorers and venturesome traders were whizzing
around the sector even by year 0, the Imperium wanted to keep a firm hold on
the exploitation of new worlds, so planetary data would not be available
"for sale" in your local nav stockist - you\'d only know about those worlds
that you\'d actually visited or - as is hinted at in M0 - that you\'d bought
data for illegally, from Scout contacts, etc. The more general Imperium
claim to \'own\' Core sector in Year 0 could be sustained more because the
major competitors had been subdued than by the fact that the Imperium had
actually managed to expand sufficiently to have taken over the populations
and cultures of the hundreds of worlds therein. So the Imperium in Year 0
could make big claims, but realistically was no more than a thinly spread
network of traders and military ships, maintaining Imperial presence through
trade or force.

(b) The low statistics for the Confederacy ("centered on three powerful
worlds: Marsus, Protalus, and Sketola (the capital).") could be regarded as
their statistics after having been subdued by the Imperium, i.e. starports
reduced significantly (perhaps the higher class stuff still exists at A or B
but is only available to Imperial military ships). Such states might well be
left half-disabled and isolated for many years while the Imperium worked to
expand sufficiently that it could *economically* afford to fully integrate
these previously *hostile* worlds into the Imperium.

Ok, I\'m running out of excuses here. There appear to be a number of
anomalous population/tech problems in FS which can best be explained away as
temporary tiny (1-9 people, or, for pop multiplier 0, tiny *and* transient)
bases and research posts placed by the expanding Imperium or perhaps one of
the other powers prior to the Imperium\'s expansion.

I can only apologise that when we were writing M0, IG did not make the FS
data available to us (despite our repeated requests) nor was it clear how
many sectors FS was to cover. If we had received the necessary information
we could have checked Core for inconsistencies with M0 and I\'d have made
damned sure the Gushmege data tied up with The Long Way Home! :-)

        Or that you don\'t need to build a fleet of 16km-wide flying saucers
to destroy a city when a nuke, or god forbid a humble, not even
relatavistic, rock will do.  There was this great file came over the net
titled "40 things I learned from ID4" that just ripped the movie apart.
Nice eye candy, but it would have taken a big crane to suspend my disbelief
over that one, and the grating propaganda got on my nerves bigtime...

        Now Mars Attacks!, on the other hand, was brilliant.  I hope that
the bozos responsible for ID4 saw it and experienced what all true hacks
feel in the presence of towering genius.  Mars Attacks! is, IMHO, the
ultimate alien invasion flick.  It\'s done the genre; it\'s the epitome of
it\'s type; everything else after it can only be pale imitation...

        Nope.  The US military were actually seriously considering the

Blackmoor WAS published as a campaign of sorts, but not by TSR
it was called "The First Fantasy Campaign" and published by
Judges Guild.

Hi John,

I had no idea.  If I\'d known, I would have suggested putting your name in

I thought I was the only person in the world still running a Blackmoor   
campaign (off & on - when I can get my gun-bunnies off Cyberpunk, SLA or   
Traveller)!

William is right about Blackmoor being the fifth book for the old   
white-box D&D set. However, he is wrong about Blackmoor never being   
published separately. Blackmoor was published by Judges\' Guild (anyone   
remember their Traveller stuff?) in about 1979 or so under the title   
\'First Fantasy Campaign\'. T$R also brought out four Blackmoor modules in   
the early eighties.

Also, in all the arguements about how many RPGS were published before   
Traveller, no-one has yet mentioned Chivalry & Sorcery (I\'d have to check   
my copy, but 1975 I think).

I now return you to your regularly scheduled Traveller Mailing List. :-)

Kind Regards

I didn\'t actually get to see Mars Attacks, but from the previews it was
completly in correct.  Earthlings don\'t have a clue what Martians are like.
 First they are not warfaring, they are the most pacifist society this side
of the Antares Grate.  Secondly they are not short and green.  They are
long and thin, averging 2.5m in height, and are execellent basketball
players.  Their skin color is a ruddy brown, much like the Martian surface.  

They dwell in an underground clan-caste system of adobe style villas and
are currently about in Traveller Terms, tech level 3. They however do
possess a device, clearly not made by them that they use to prevent outside
involvement.  Viking caught them by surpise, but they were read for Mars
Explorer.

Maybe now Martians will be described and treated with the respect they
deserve.

As a GM, it is incumbent upon YOU to make sure that this DOES NOT happen...
 If this is really a problem then BREAK THE CHARGEN rules, do not let them
break you.

Try these:

1.  Assign 36 + 2D points to attributes.

2.  Assign 5 + 1D to EACH attribute.

3.  Start everyone with what we call "tournament-style" characters.

All three should *stomp* the low rollers and the high rollers alike.  The
first gives more similarity in numbers, the second gives a broader range
while still preventing "unplayable" [The author believes there is no such
thing.  -ed.] characters...  And the third is my personal favorite: it\'s
easier to tailor a character for the campaign, as well as for the person
involved!

Bummer.  You can come play in my game: we have "tons o\' fun".

> Have any of you run a Traveller campaign that took place entirely within

        Yes, although I have to admit that was when I started Traveller....
all was built around ideas taken out of Character Generation (the old, only
6 careers...)
        (Non-standard subsector)
        Planet: Somewhere, inhabitable, two hundred millions pop.
        (it\'s a name: sounds not stupid when you play in Spanish)
        Plot: retired army generals are developing an underground criminal
net which threats to become the true power in the system. Ex-military
Characters get contracted as undercover law enforcers and the referee uses
the whole plot to develop the "civilian" character type.
        Second planet in the system: Nowhere, colony, not inhabitable.
Prison, Mining facilities, military training camps, secret criminal
facilities. Players go there from time to time.
        The campaign lasted around six months, and it was real fun. So it
can be done.

The idea was an analog to the fact that if you drill a hole through earth

make a "small" change in the game universe wihout thinking out the

You\'re all entitled to your views and if I sound like coming down hard on

Ummm... Fudge factor?  I haven\'t formalized it, and since my players
have had exactly one ship since, a 200dT Far Trader. I haven\'t done 
more than say, "check the jump grid every 4-5 hours".  If one of 
the gearheads decided to take the idea and run with it, I\'d love it.

Yes.
For me, this complaint sounds strange. THAT\'S HOW LIFE IS! I can\'t
complain about life, just because I am naturally impatient (which is in
fact one of my personal probs).
In real life I don\'t have another chance to roll better Endurance. I
have to learn patience, which means in Traveller terms, that I have to
build up Endurance. This is in fact far more difficult than learning
skills, based on Endurance. And this is exactly how T4 works. And that\'s
why I like it.
So I just can congratulate Marc and the guys who made T4. They did a
real good job, and I hope that esp. Marc doesn\'t get too frustrated
about so many peoples complaining about it. I think he must feel like a
father, who\'s baby becomes beaten up.

        Well, if it can be assumed that year 40 is the publication date, it
does not seem possible to take Milieu Zero as covering the whole 0-199
period, right?
        As a personal opinion, I should say that I prefer, for publication,
the "fictional author/date" approach taken by DGP in V&V and S&A. I prefer
each article with a specific in-game publication date, and pretended author.
This way, it becomes usable background material. E.g., at the moment I am
writing some game documents covering the whole Geonee history ;-). The
first, to be used with the Milieu zero setting covers from prehistory to
around year zero and is supposedly written by a Sylean archaeologist and
published in Sylea in imperial Year 30. The second, to be used with the
Rebellion setting covers from year zero to 1100, will be signed by a
historian and was supposedly published in Massilia sector in 1110. The
third, to be used with the New Era setting, covers from 1116 to 1200 and is
supposed to be extracted from a history textbook from the Third Geonee
Confederation.
        IMHO, this approach helps to create "game atmosphere".

        Anyway, I\'m not sure those subsector names can be "safely" used in
Milieu Zero. Shiwonee is named after the Geonee homeworld, but in First
Survey the name of the system is changed to Asadug.
        Heretic Theory: In First Survey/Milieu Zero times, many star systems
have names in the maps that do not correspond to local names. Scouts visit
the system and assign one name they can easily pronounce, or use the name
they had from old Vilani maps. During the next thousand years, local names
slowly spread to become the ones in the "official" maps.
        And so, the people from Shiwonee always called their world Shiwonee,
but the Sylean Scouts just put an old Vilani name on the map (Asadug). But
subsector names are even more probable to have been set arbitrarily by
scouts at the beginning. And, in Milieu zero, as they have still little
political meaning (lots of independent worlds, etc.), few people cares.
        Notice three "Geonee-like" names in Massilia subsector names.
Forquee, Shiwonee, and Shokee. If the scouts are not systematically using
the local names for planets, it seems not very probable that these are also
official, imperial subsector names in Milieu zero. Some old Vilani names or
new Sylean words ar eplaced on the maps, and they get changed over the
centuries until we get the 1100 names we are familiar with.
        Probably, the idea of "subsectors" would even be strange in some
worlds or... subsectors <G>. Maybe other confederacys/empires are using
different methods to cut the space into pieces, specially if they are not in
the center of a subsector. One prefers a map showing all own surroundings,
right? If you have a pocket empire of eight worlds at the "bottom" of a
subsector and another world at the "top" of the contiguous subsector, why
should you use two subsector maps? Use a single map of your worlds and all
other worlds in a 10-parsec radius. Put the subsector concept in the thrash.
(Btw, guess which pocket empire I am speaking about <G>)

This quickly showed me that JoT could not be used as a standard

	Default skills use Att/3 as base target number.  This 
simulates the initial jump from unskilled to skilled fairly well
with a T# difference of 1-3 points based on attribute.

	JoT adds to the default skill T# without multiplication.
This means that two points of JoT are equivalent to 1 point of 
other skills in a skill.  This still means that with JoT 5, her
character is often still better off using JoT than a skill until
the skill is 2.

	Another thought I\'ve been having is splitting JoT effects.
If JoT would allow a roll that would otherwise not be allowed, 
i.e. pilot.  The JoT roll is to even GET a roll, followed by 
a roll at Default level (Att/3).  This means that their JoT roll
is to figure out what to do, but it doesn\'t actually help them do 
it.

        Humor seems to be cultural in a high percentage. One theory about
humor is that you laugh because you feel superior to the characters
portrayed in the history. So, it appeals directly to your value scale, what
do you thing "superior" means. A Vilani will feel superior to any Solomani
trying to do things alone when cooperating with a group would make things
better. Probably, the Solomani character will be a regular of the Vilani
humor shows. They will tell thousands of "Solomani jokes". ("Why the
Solomani do not read? Because other person has written the book!").
Conversely, The Vilani would make good humorous characters at Solomani
shows, and there would be thousands of Vilani jokes. (How many "Vilani does
it take to change a light bulb? Hundred and one. One to do the job, and one
hundred to fill up the required formulars").

I don\'t think you need to apologize, Andy. The fault seems to lay in poor
corrdination of projects on the part of IG and perhaps time pressures
preventing Marc from sharing exactly what his plans were for First Survey.
        Myself, I\'m going to use FS the way it was originally meant to be
used; I\'ll be filling in the Player Data with the numbers I want to use, and
basically ignoring the Referee\'s Data entirely.

SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT.....................................................



One of the very real problems I saw immediatley when I looked at FS was
that, for an area of space supposedly recovering from a Long Night, there
are an awful lot of spaceflight level civilizations, A and B class
starports, and absolutely NO X class ports in any of the 9 sectors detailed
in the book (or at least I haven\'t found any). I guess I was expecting
something a LITTLE more along the lines of what the collapsed sectors of TNE
looked like; a fair number of dead worlds, lots of places with D and E class
ports, and a number of X\'s. There\'s one worls listed in the Core Sector that
has NO population (Pop 0 Pop Mutliplier 0) but a B class port and a TL of B!
How do you come up with that?? There are more X class ports in the Core
Sector in year 1115 than in Year 0! I have to say that aside from the maps
and the player data, the rest of First Survey will not be of great use to me.

Mileau 0 was a wonderful read, bursting with Traveller history and the joy
of discovering new information. But it says (for instance) that half of the
worlds the Scouts encountered were dead. Sure can\'t tell that from the
sector data. They must have one hell of a Recovery program in Year 0...


Sorry to criticize, but I had very high hopes for these products. These
discrepancies should have been caught in the editing process! Tony Lee
edited First Survey (but admittedly probably only took what Marc gave him);
Lester Smith edited Mileau 0. Between these two gentlemen, someone should
have caught the discrepancies between these two products.

I\'ll be honest; IG needs to slow down their release schedule and go over
these books in much more detail. I\'d rather have a well-done, consistent
product every other month than what happened with these two books.

Actually, since the combat pilots WOULD be part of the mercenary company,
you could treat them as passengers.

Having small craft pilots as crew members is only if the small craft are
part of the ship, rather than attatched to the passengers, as in this
case.

I know it gets all muddled when you realize that _everyone_ on board this
thing is technically crew, since these ships would probably be permanently
part of a specific company, it\'s just the distinction between Navy and
Marines on a real assault landing ship, or carrier; if there are support
aircraft on board one of those, they\'re flown by Marine pilots, not navy
ones.

That would alleviate a lot of the cargo problems you\'re seeing.

Uh, what?  If you drill through a sphere along a diameter, the "angle" is
of no consequence; it may not even have any meaning.  I don\'t see how this
relates to jump-time.

Maybe there is, but you have to get to TL17 before you see it.  By analogy,
there\'s been a lot of research into alternative power sources for cars at
our TL, but nothing really successful yet -- for all its faults, gasoline
still has by far the most optimal power/weight/cost combination.  

>There should also be rules for longer jumps at lower Tls or did

>right away? 

More likely, like many (real) physical processes, there is a threshold
activation energy required to make a jump at all.  Early jump research
finally hit on the amount of energy required (too little and nothing
happens, too much and ... boom), the flow rate required to build up the
energy fast enough but not too fast, and the structures, mechanisms, and
processes required (e.g., the right grid "cooled" the right way) to
successfully create a stable jump, getting more than fast neutrinos on the
other end.  Once all _that_ was done, fine tuning this technological leap
to provide approximately 1 parsec jumps was more a matter for the engineers
than the theoretical physicists (who, I\'m sure, are still arguing about the
precise underpinnings of jump physics).  

>The first mentioned idea rules out any change in jumptime from

No, that\'s true only at TL14-15 (but who knows, maybe some TL15 corps
actually have some things up their sleeves).  As research progresses, you
might expect to see all kinds of advances in jump technology.  That\'s one
of the advantages of a strong pseudo-scientific explanation: it gives you
places to take the technology in your campaign.

Well, for you maybe.  If you have a different and equally compelling
explanation, that\'s cool.  One person\'s handwaving is another\'s profound
theoretical statement (I think even Newton, Bohr, Einstein, and Hawking
might agree with that! :) ).

Well, I\'m that *anyone*. The attribute governs the ability to learn the
skill. The higher the attribute the faster you learn and and the higher the
limit where study time zooms skyward. The skill level accurately describes
the skill of the person as the name skill level implies.

Lou Zocchi et al gone?  What\'s the gaming world coming to?  Maybe I should take 
these rumors of TSR\'s pending demise more seriously.

I got my dice many years ago, like 1981.  I got two of them with my first set 
of Black Books.  I\'ve had to replace the Black Books due to wear, but the dice 
are still around.  I only use them for Character Generation rolls, though.  My 
players fear these dice.  Then again, they fear my quart-jar filled with 
red-pipped black dice, too.

Well, since the DOD already owns a huge expanse of Nevada desert for the
express purpose of being radioactive, I doubt they\'d do it over Texas, and
certainly not over public roads (too easy for the Commies to watch, eh
Roderick?) when they could do it out in the stinking desert

Second, SciAm puts out a CD-rom index with abstracts of all their issues
back to the early 40\'s, I think...this is something that would have
appeared in the 60\'s or 70\'s after the original work was declassified.

Surely SOMEONE out there in TML land has this index or access to it?

	Speaking as someone who believes that the advanced ship combat

	Having to roll handfulls of dice for everything is just a
nuisance.  I liked the 2300AD combat system that used D10s.  You could
resolve the entire attack in one roll by using three dice of different
colors, one for to-hit, one for location, one for damage. 

Happy Travelling, whatever dice you use.

I think that if extraterrestrials were to invade and pillage our planet,
it would be very hard to understand what they really wanted.

	"So a three mile cluster of trees from mars has settled down on the
Kalihari Desert and are making small oblisks out of the sand?  Is this
their idea of \'raping the Earth?\'  If it is, they have some
incomprehensibly kinky sexual practices..."

	"Damn Aliens... They landed, melted every car in the town into a puddle
and took them."

	"What are they demanding?"
	"47.62 hours of continuous music; specifically Elvis\'s "Jailhouse Rock"
 and Tuvan throat singing"

	"They\'re mining the asteroid belt, building giant solar panels and
orbiting them around the sun in a belt just beyond the orbit of
Mercury!"

	My point being, you wouldn\'t be able to tell the difference between
being raped by aliens or by a large tree.

I always used $2 equals Cr1. When I thought of that one, I was

In the Travellers Digest the Confederacy had more or less joined the 
Imperium by year 0, the poor state of the worlds is probably reflected by 
the fact that Confederacy worlds had been defecting to the Sylean 
Federation for decades (or longer)

Keshi gained its importance because it maintained Jump Drive tech during 
the long night, and conquered the worlds within 5 parsecs of it. It\'s 
year 0 UWP could be due to the fact that the Rulers of Keshi transferred 
their power base to other worlds of the Kingdom. Keshi could be a sort of 
Buckingham Palace, or Forbidden \'City\' for the Chanestin Royals. In this 
case the pop modifier represents the Royal population, with the tech 
modifier inconsequential as most of the tech is imported from the 
powerhouse Chanestin worlds.

Hope this helps,

the jump grid doesn\'t cool evenly.  In fact, the larger the grid,
the more problems you have with keeping the grid even.  This means
that on a 100 ton ship, checks every 8 or 9 hours are sufficient
to keep things kosher (assuming it\'s in good shape), but a 200 ton

Nice idea. What happens if you don\'t cool it evenly?

No they are different things.  Docking Rings contain the subcraft
entirely inside the main ship. External Ships bolt the subcraft onto the outside.  

When the subcraft isn\'t in its Docking Ring, they look like a big hole
in the hull, which is the exact size of the subcraft. 

The Life Pod in Star Wars in which the Droids evacuate the Princess\'
Ship would be in a docking ring.

The Space Shuttle\'s Booster Rockets would be in Grapples.

original D&D rules and decided he could do better. And Space Opera
definitley did NOT come out at the same time as Traveller. In fact, as it
was for every other sci-fi game of the time, Traveller was the standard
against which Space Opera was attempting to compete.

I\'d like to see Traveller once again become the standard...

If the skill level accurately describes the skill of the person, are
any two skill_3 people at the same level of skill?  I would actually
say no--but they have the same training.

Using the T4 (or something close) system, the attribute+skill_level
is how well you actually do at a given task.  I would use the skill
level alone to determine how hard that task is.  Within a given
skill level, the person with the best innate ability will do better.

Skills represent training, IMO, not ability.  Characters with an
average attribute may choose to familiarize themselves with a subject
in order to compensate for a low attribute----the problem is that in
the T4 task system, this doesn\'t really pay off... that\'s what
started the thread, right?

Again, I\'m not sure that task system is broken badly if you craft your
tasks right.  So, you want a task to be Difficult?  Difficult for
what level of skill?  Is the base level the same for all people
regardless of training?  Even the skill-0 penalties aren\'t enough
for some stuff.  An Engineering task might be Easy for any Eng2+
person, but even half atribute for a skill 0 person might
overestimate their chances of doing the Easy fix to the Jdrive.

When I started playing I used 1 Cr =3D 1$ but now I tend towards 1 Cr =3D 2$=
 to
account for Terrestrial inflation.
The Imperium shouldn\'t have inflation for ease of play and also because
inflation is caused by unbalanced state budgets which the Imperium doesn\'t
have as Strephon was so incredibly wise and smart.

OK putting on my handwaving gloves.
The normal universe has 3 dimensions (ignoring time for the moment) which
for the sake of simplicity will be reduced to a 2-dim surface on a sphere.
When jumping, a ship is cutting through the surface and subject to a strong
force that propels it along a "straight" path through the sphere. The angle
off from the curvature of the sphere depends on the J-drives weave
tightness and the distance travelled on the surface of the sphere is the
actual jumplength. The jump force has the same properties as gravity being
proportional to the supervolume of the sphere (4d volume that is) and
inverse square to the distance measured along the radius of the sphere
(which is perpendicular to all 3 normal dimension. All this is of course
only a crude analog taught to schoolkids because the real physical system
requires extensive study into "field array isoflux theory".
Off them gloves.

What the original poster said was simply that there are physical real world
systems that show a fixed length of time with varied parameters. Another
less easily handwaved is the period of a fixed length pendelum which
doesn\'t rely on neither mass nor amplitude (except when the amplitude
breaks the sin a aprox a) but only length of strong and gravity. Everybody
has heard the pretty crude rubbersheet anology to space time curvature so
the above anology seems on the surface similar and therefore game-world
acceptable.

Jump grid cooling sounds Trekkish, which means I just dealt it the lowest
of blows.

One portion of the fleet is cutting up mars, and another grabbing up the

Ah, yes...but as anyone who "played" it knows, C&S was not a role-playing
game.  There were several theories about what it actually was.  My
favorites:

- - The first doctoral thesis on Medieval society to incorporate d20s.
- - The world\'s longest eye exam chart.
- - The rough draft for Crowley\'s "Magick in Theory and Practice."

If the lanthanum jump grid needs to "cool down" to below a specific point
for the starship to re-enter ordinary space, perhaps uneven cooling leads
to parts of the ship leaving jump space prematurely - which, if you\'re
feeling particularly brutal, might "rupture" the "n-space bubble" around
the portion of the ship whose jump grid is still "hot," leading to the
loss of everything and everyone aboard... Keep an eye on those gauges!

What happens when only part of the ship is in jumpspace?  As someone
suggested elsewhere, you get some high energy particles scattered 
across the parsecs.  In fact, some "misjumps" are situations where
there is some abnormality in the de-energization (cooling) of the 
jump grid.  The engineers spend the time frantically scampering 
around the ship trying to re-route the grid energy to balance it,
occasionally partially re-energizing parts of it from the standard
power plant. 
	"Captain, we need 20% more power in engineering, immediately!"
	"What the heck are we supposed to turn off?"
	"Life support for all I care."
Well maybe not THAT extreme, but you get the idea.  Of course in such
situations, I would not let a single roll off all the characters,
but if they can\'t keep control, it certainly would be bad for them.
Note that re-energization does not take the extreme amounts and speed
of energization from zero state.  In my mind the jump grid is similar
in behavior to a transistor, with a BIG shift in energy level between
the Jump-State and the Normal-State, but within these states, 
it behaves in a "well-behaved" fashion.

So, during a "mis-jump" the extra time is because the irregularites
in the jump cause engineering to re-energize the grid to keep it
balanced, keeping the ship in J-Space longer.  Well, couldn\'t a ship
mis-jump intentionally? Yes, by re-energizing the grid during J-State.
Unfortunately, no one has been able to figure out the effects of
these re-energizations on the destination.  The initial energy 
of the Jump configuration has been well mapped.  The problem with in 
J-State re-energization, is that they\'re never the same and the 
requirements of re-energization seem to be dictated by J-Space.  And 
if you screw up, which is much easier under these circumstances, you
can spread you self over lots of parsecs...  Yes there are crazy
scientists chasing this, but the mortality rate is, umm...,
discouraging.  And spending a couple of months for one data point
is slow.  Personally, I\'d look to TL20 or so to control distance by
re-energization.  (Can you see PCs with a ship like this?  
Frightening!)

Anyway, enough blathering....
Anyone else want to run with this? Shoot holes in it?

ID4 was bad in many respects, but it was great at showing things being
"blowed up real good."  The USofA being one of the few, if not the only,
country to mention things being blown up in its national anthem.  

And, well, however bad the movie was, I still get a lot of oohs and aahs at
my black nylon jacket with the official Apple/ID4 logo embroidered on the
front. :)  

Now if I could just get a cool matte black nylon jacket with a huge
Imperial sunburst on the back... heh heh heh.

Yeah, off them gloves.  For my money, this explanation fails under its own
weight.  The parsimoniousness of the universe gives rise to Occam\'s razor
- -- which means that jump grid "cooling" (this cooling also being a crude
analogy taught to kids), being simpler, is more elegant, and thus more
likely to be true.

Of course, in your universe, your mileage may vary.


Hmmm.  While I\'m thinking about it, is there a physicist in the house?  I
have some questions about Planck space and particles as standing waves in
that space that I\'d like to explore, for plot generation purposes.

Thanks, you\'ve actually encouraged me to buy FS.  I was worried they would
do just what you wanted and am quite pleased that they did not. 

The Sylean Federation was founded in -650, at TL 11.  They\'ve been jumping
around the Core sector for a long time now.  Why in the world would you
expect Core to look like TNE wild zones?  Year 0 is the end of the
political and economic "Long Night" for the rest of the Imperium.  I would
imagine that the Core sector itself has had extensive trade and
colonization since at least -500.  Having Core sector look like a
wilderness of doomed worlds makes no sense to me at all.  After 500 years,
lots of starports make sense.  I\'d imagine there were a lot of TL 6-9
worlds which traded for jump drive and similar tech around -500 to -300 or
so and have been going strong since then.

Zocchi shut down?  You\'ve got to be kidding me!

I loved that place.  I discovered it on a gambling trip to Biloxi 
once.  We stopped in at Gulfport to try the casino there before 
moving on to the strip in Biloxi, and everytime I\'m out of town, I 
check the local yellow pages for a game store.  You\'d be surprised 
how much out of print stuff I find that way.

Well, I stopped in at Zocchi and just fell in love.  You name it, 
they had it.

Damn, I\'m really sorry to hear that they\'ve shut down.  I guess they 
really should have worked on their customer service.  (Yes, they had 
mounds of old, out of print stuff, but you had to go look for it like 
in a warehouse or swap meet.  They sure weren\'t going to take time 
away from their busy schedules to piddle with a customer.)

Mike Sellers wrote a good rebuttal, but I just wanted to add one 
thing in defense of Glenn\'s, and now my,  cool down theory.

Because Traveller is based on Asimov\'s Foundation series, technology 
waxes and wanes, and there is long periods of time between 
innovation.

Traveller has explained this with the way Vilani constrain technology 
innovation.

Just look at the jump drive.  The Vilani first discovered it in 
- -9235.  Then, almost 4,000 years later, they discovered jump-2.

4,000 years?  Damn.

This is true for many technological devices in the Traveller 
universe.

Given this, it is likely that the materials and equipment used to 
"cool down" (damn, we need a better term--maybe govern) and control 
the energy in the jump grid have not been significantly improved upon 
since the J-Drive\'s first inception.

Maybe they are working on it, but just haven\'t found a better system 
(kind of like our T4 task system debate).

I\'m sure that there are some experimental models out there.  I 
remember reading an artical call Project Farstar in an old Challenge 
that dealt with experimental jump drives.

The theory is that there are 36 levels of jump space, and this has 
been proven to some extent by misjumps.  DGP\'s excellent SOM states 
that there may be as many as 62.  (Sheesh!  How about that brand new 
jump-62 drive they put on that sporty model over there!)

But, from between -9235 (the first invention of the J-Drive) and 1220 
(TNE years), no J-Drive has been able to break the jump-6 barrier on 
a controlled basis.

That\'s 10,455 years!  Out of possible 62 levels of jump space, we\'ve 
only conquered 6.

I picture akin to the sound barrier, the light barrier, and 
the Warp 10 barrier on Star Trek.

Given this, I\'d say it is possible that they haven\'t been able to 
improve upon the cooling principle that was used with the first 
J-Drive all those years ago.

Another thing that I like about the theory is that the possibility is 
there--leading to some neat game situations.

Mark postulated that the answer to the cool down problem might be 
just around the corner, at TL17 or 18.

From what I have said here, that may well be true.

I remember that FASA started as a licensee for GDW and, you guessed 
it, Traveller!

I can\'t remember the exact meaning if the acronym, but I do remember 
it referred to the sector of space that FASA was granted to develop 
there products for way back then.

Or maybe it was a Vilani word.

I dunno.  Something like that.

Agreed.  Many think that the JOT rule is broken even under the 
published T4 task system.

>  I have made the following changes:

(Interesting ideas snipped)

> Comments?

Although your idea has merit, I\'d go with something simpler.  I try 
to stick as close to the printed rules as possible when I make 
changes.

What to you think of this JOT fix?

	1)As written:  JOT substitutes as the skill level for the missing 
	skill and attributes are halved.

	2)Proposed fix for KBv1.1:  Attributes are still halved, but skill 
	level is not doubled.

This seems to be an easier, quicker, and smoother fix for JOT under 
KBv1.1 that is still close to the original rule.  As a matter of 
fact, it is the original rule without the KBv1.1 changes.

I guess what I\'m trying to say is that I think the JOT rule works 
fine with KBv1.1 as written.

Attributes are halved, giving the character level 0 like ability, 
but the character does not benefit the full amount he would if he had 
a real skill (because we are not doubling the skill level).  And, 
there is a definite penalty for not having the real skill.

Let\'s look at your example of the character with JOT-5.  You didn\'t 
list her stats, so I\'ll use a generic stat of 7 for this example.

		JOT-5, Stat-7

Under KBv1.1, 
		Target number is 14.

Using the original T4 rule,
		Target number is 9.

There\'s still benefit from having JOT, and it could definitely get 
you out of a jam.  But, you have no where near the chance of success 
you had when you had a full skill.

Well, what do you think of that?  I\'m all for removing the 
complication.  This way, JOT does not have to be changed at all.  
You\'ve already changed to KBv1.1, and that\'s it.  JOT is fine.

True...but that wasn\'t the *origin* of the name.  R&B borrowed it from the

I actually had a system just like the one you describe above.  I had 
never heard anything that I could buy explaining the rule 
either--especially in the official material.

It seemed that the answers always boiled down to, "It\'s that way 
because it is."

I wanted more.

And Glenn gave it to me.  You should listen to his explanation.  It\'s 
a good one, and made me convert, after 14 years disregarding the one 
week rule.

Exactly.  Me too.  Glenn\'s explanation puts logic into the rule 
without changing anything.

I\'m one of his fiercest supporters.

Ha!  It\'s the name of the country run by Groucho Marx\'s character "Rufus
T. Firefly" in the Marx Brothers\' film "Duck Soup."  I believe or or two
of the FASA Traveller license products listed an R.T. Firefly as their
chief naval architect, or some such.

And I\'m still only 28.  :-)

Ah C&S.  It was none of the above.  It was designed by Tylenol Company for
test subjects of their new pain killer.  To continue the test, the release
Space Opera and Aftermath.

Actually, I bought Space Opera last year from a net-auction.  No real
reason, just to have it take up shelf space with everything else.  But it
is good to see how far games have come since then (not necessarily in
mechanics, but art and printing and layout).

I have to jump in here and defend ID4. This may become flame bait, and its
definatly off-topic but here goes any way . . .

I enjoyed the heck out of ID4 once I decided 2 minutes into the movie to
not nit-pick and just sit back and watch.  Yes there was a lot of stuff
that was outragiously stupid to people who know better.  A friend that is a
HAM operator was offened by the use of the old style teletype keys instead
of a more modern thumb-finger key.  I am sure the people at SETI thought
that the representation of SETI was completly bogus as well.

The movie wasn\'t made for science geeks like us.  It was made for the other
20 bazillion moving going Americans who build cars, walk dogs, sell
groceries, trade stocks, design buildings, etc.  I dont think you want to
class everyone who doesn\'t have a college degree and a good understanding
of science, dopler effect, and exo-biology in the class of "americans with
thick foreheads".

Not everything Hollywood does has to reflect reality.  In fact most movies
they make do not.  People in the field being represented are always
critical of it.  I know for a fact that the storm chase geeks were critical
of "Twister" yet everyone else who is not a meterology expert or meterology
expert wanna be enjoyed the movie because they didn\'t care about being
"accurate".

"The Net" is one that drove the computer geeks nuts because it was so
bogus.  Yet for every person who saw it who wouldn\'t know a fire wall from
a router saw an execellent and enjoyable thriller.  When hollywood makes a
film, they have to present what looks good on the screen and what will be
understandable by the mass of people.  99% of the people who saw ID4 could
care less that a Mac using a \'C\' like program could trash Mr. Alien
spacecraft.  They saw some last minute heroics from some exausted heros.

The movie makers don\'t spend a lot of money seeking to be technically
correct.  "Here hold the salt shaker, it will look like a cool sci-fi
weapon." is part of the magic.  

How many people enjoyed "An Officer and an Gentleman"?  How many Naval
officers and Marines tore that apart?  I certianly didn\'t belive that
Richard Gere\'s character was any were near qualifing for Naval Avaiator but
it didn\'t change the fact that it was a great movie.

You can nit-pick any movie to death to the point where you dislike every
movie.  When you get there, save your money, you are not going to enjoy the
movie any way.  I decided to stop nit-picking and just sit back and have
fun watching movies after I completly ruined Star Trek V for myself (bad
movie for trekkers, good movie for the masses).  Since then I decided to be
entertained by the story and not by the accuracy.

It seems like I have once again not fully explained myself (or maybe I just
need to write posts 3x longer than normal to cover every possible
misunderstanding that might occur...)

What you have said is valid for Core Sector, probably even for Vland. But
Gushemege? Corridor? Massilia? I would think these distant sectors would be
feelihg the effects of the Long Night yet, wouldn\'t you? I don\'t mean things
should be as bad as it was in TNE; far from it. I just think it should be
somewhere between that and what it looks like to me from the data presented.
Less A and B ports, more worlds at lower tech levels and so on. It wouldn\'t
bother me that mcuh except that MILEAU 0 says that this is what is IS like,
and the maps don\'t reflect this.

  {
    'body' => 'There\'s been much discussion of late on the 1-week jump rule; how it\'s
justified, how it might be changed.

The first important thing to note is that you *can\'t* change it in any
nontrivial way without breaking canon history beyond all recognition. 
Jump technology *defines* the Imperium (and its antecedents, and its
neighbors) in a deep, complex, inextricable way.  An Imperium in which
Regina wasn\'t months of travel away from Core would look *nothing* like
the canon Imperium.  A war in which higher tech allowed shorter-interval
jumps would look *nothing* like (say) the Fifth Frontier War.  A starship
that could use higher power to shorten its jumps would look *nothing* like
any starship ever built for Traveller. 

Obviously, if you\'re running your own non-canon campaign, you can use any
drive tech you want; but if you want to use the Imperium and be
consistent, you have to be incredibly careful about changing tech --
because tech defines the society, in a pervasive sense.  Just look at how
much canon was broken when TNE converted from thrusters to HEPlaR!  A good
rule of thumb is that *any* tech change from canon *will* have unintedned
consequences and invalidate other aspects of canon.

Now, for my attempt at hand-waving past the "Why one week?" question:

Jump involves a transition to a "metaverse" with a skewed coordinate
structure.  This metaverse is separated from ours by a tiny difference in
potential energy, measured against a hyperdimensional vector field called
Sigma.  Other metaverses lie at higher and lower Sigma potentials; the
lower ones aren\'t at all useful, as the physical laws there are *more*
restrictive than ours.  Our own universe is known as Mu 0 in this field of
science; what is conventionally called Jumpspace is "Mu +1", the first
metaverse of Sigma potential higher than our own.

During the transition to Mu +1, application of quite tiny amounts of
normal-space energy can create Mu +1 coordinate transformations which in
turn translate to "jumps"  of many parsecs back in Mu 0.  Unfortunately,
the normal energy of ships, people, and so forth is quite high enough to
make them "misjump"  spontaneously in random directions, particle by
particle, if exposed directly to Mu +1.  Most of what a J-Drive does is
create and maintain a protective bubble of Mu 0 space around the ship to
prevent this from happening.

Like all energies, the transition energy from Mu 0 to Mu +1 looks like a
distance in Mu +1 -- but it\'s spent \'between\' them, and thus ends up
looking like a *time interval* in both coordinate systems (e = mc^2, ke =
0.5 mv2, c and v in dist/time, mass fixed, apply SR at v = c, reduce).
That time interval is 168 hours.  Small quantum fluctuations introduce a
slight uncertainty in this figure.

Actually, interestingly enough, the transform above is not commutative.
The energy increase when dropping back from Mu +1 to Mu 0 manifests as a
*distance* -- c * 168 hours, or about 180 billion kilometers, or about
1200 AU.  Part of an astrogator\'s (and jump-control computer\'s) job is to
take this \'jump drift\' into account in planning the jump; its direction
can be controlled, with the proper inputs to the drive during the
transition (the same time *all* such energy inputs must be applied, as
once entirely \'in\' Mu +1, no normal-space effects will have any impact on
the Mu +1 outside the bubble.

A ship which suffers a catastrophic failure while jumping out will
occasionally reach jumpspace with an operative jump bubble, but without 
having had its course controlled by the jump-time energy inputs.  Such
ships will travel 1200 AU in some random direction...putting them into the
Oort cloud of most stars.  Some salvage operations have had luck looking
for wrecked ships 1200 AU from busy port worlds.

Next:  Where does all the hydrogen go?

I haven\'t, but why not?  There\'s an article in JTAS (I think) entitled "Travelling 
without jumping" or something like that that deals with in-system adventuring.  It\'s a 
matter of having enough detail in a star system to keep the campaign interesting.  
Traveller has rules and background to govern in-system travel and development of the 
setting (especially World Builder\'s Handbook by DGP), and influences from beyond the 
system (Imperial politics, or visits by offworlders, e.g.) don\'t have to take your 
players into jump space.  The Sol system is, I think, a perfect choice, because of the 
amount of detail already created and written down for you (both in Traveller and here in 
the Sol system -- ricochet.net is located on Terra, isn\'t it?).

I\'m not a proponent of your j-drive model -- I just posted my own
alternative -- but might I suggest "dissipate"?  As in, "Dissipation of
energy from the grid requires 168 hours," or "Captain!  If we can\'t
dissipate 20 megajoules in the next three hours, we\'re toast!"  It\'s a
reasonable term for what you\'re talking about, and sounds much higher tech
than "cool down." :)

For something *this* critical, even the Vilani would see the need to
research the hell out of it!  The culture with better j-drives *wins*, in
the Traveller universe.  If you could jump in six days instead of seven,
the economic advantage alone would be astonishing, to say nothing of the
military implications.  There\'s just no way *any* starfaring culture
wouldn\'t optimize this right to the wall (i.e., to the ragged limits of
their current TL).

<sniff>  Kenneth, you bring a tear to my eye.  Living on the Mississippi
Coast, I frequented Zocchi\'s and was VERY upset to see them leave.

Rumor Mill - They were bought out by a company from Tennessee that will be
moving the Out Of Print stuff from Zoochi\'s and the new stuff from Tennessee
to a big Distributor wharehouse in Atlanta.  No more walk in customers.

Also, I know it is no excuse for poor customer service, but Zocchi\'s was a
distributor, not a FLGS.  (They were anything but Friendly!)

GAAAH!

Rocky and Bullwinkle are, as everyone knows, from Frostbite Falls,
Minnesota, just north of Ely and about 150 miles north of Lake Wobegon,
gateway to Central Minnesota.  Boris and Natasha are from Pottsylvania, as
I recall.

Freedonia, on the other hand, is the name of a small nation that the Marx
Brothers are involved with in one of their movies -- I want to say \'Duck
Soup\', but I won\'t swear to that... 

And I was even born in 1970 Solomani (-2521 Imperial), so I\'m under
thirty... :)

QSDS has \'External Craft Grapples\'...aren\'t those the same as \'Docking
Rings?\'

That\'s the assumption I\'ve been making...

  I don\'t know enough about SSDS to comment, but I thought that External
Craft Grapples were just that - entirely external.  They take up very
little volume (only 5 tons for a 50 ton craft), so the small craft must be
entirely outside (I assume the tonnage represents the space for the
grapple mechanism and the fairing on the hull for streamlined and airframe
hulls).  Perhaps someone who really knows what they are doing can
comment.

The same could be said of fusion power in our time, of course.  Just
because there is phenominal economic advantage to a technological
development does not mean the politicos will suddenly wake up and say
"clear the way everyone! Dr. Propeller-head and his band of grad students
are coming through with the wheelbarrows of money we\'re giving them to work
on this problem!"  Particularly if the past ten or twenty Dr.
Propeller-heads have vanished in space with all that nifty-keen equipment,
having tested their (alas, mistaken) theories and turned into fast
neutrinos ...or perhaps having faked that event and having jumped to
somewhere near, say, Barbados -- hmmm, I feel another adventure scenario
coming on, if some angry megacorp might want to find the good doctor...

On a slightly different note, it\'s very instructive to look at past earth
history and the attitudes different civilizations have had on technology,
science, and exploration.  As just one fascinating example, the Chinese
never had the western-utilitarian view of science, technology, or trade.
At one point they had a huge trading empire spanning the Indian Ocean down
to the southern tip of Africa; they had huge fleets made up of nine-masted
ships that sailed for years on end; they had great technology enabling them
to do far more deep-water sailing than could the Europeans of the time.  

And then... the Emperor died, and a new, slightly more cautious one
ascended the throne.  This one was somewhat more afraid of his Admirals,
and so made the decree that no ship with more than two masts could be built
or sailed.  Instantly, the huge trading and semi-political hegemony the
Chinese had had throughout the Indian Ocean and China Sea vanished.  And
about twenty years later, as I recall, the Portuguese finally rounded the
southern tip of Africa, and sailed up the east coast, across the Arabian
peninsula, and around India, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines,
finding abandoned trade routes and easy pickings everywhere.  

This not only puts the early growth of the Portuguese empire in some
perspective, but (as I think you can see), it could make for a _great_
background for a pocket empire.

Mars Attacks is the Platonic form satire, a B-Movie version of the B-Movie
genre. It is a delight to the eye and a swift kick to any funny bone you may
have ever had. Tim Burton may be just twisted enough to play Traveller. See
it, know it, be it.

I used a spreadsheet in designing my SSDS THUDD entry very much in the same
way as Bruce Johnson, i.e., like a calculator. My spreadsheet was organized
like the worksheet in Starships. I added a row near the top for the totals
of the Mass, Volume, Surface, Power,  Cost, and crew columns. Like Bruce, I
also did a few cross-entry references for computing crew requirements,
stateroom totals, etc. 

My spreadsheet (in MS Works) did not contain any of the tables. I really
got tired of thumbing back and forth around the color plates. I am very
much looking forward to using James Dempsey\'s Java design tool, SAL
(http://www.spirit.com.au/~jamesd) for the next contest. I was able to
recreate my THUDD entry in less than ten minutes on the first try and have
been experimenting with some MERC designs. I like SAL; it lets you
concentrate on designing the ship rather than on the mechanics of looking
up table entries!

Pete has kept quiet about this, but he seems to run our game with a similar
thought in mind, that skill level is training. Attibutes determine how well
you do, skill level determines what you can do. The now famous paramedic Joe
Blow may have a better attribute than his lovely sister Diane, but she has
had more extensive training. He can stabilize the patient and keep him or her
alive long enough to get help, but she knows where to look for the bullet,
and how to get it out of there with minimal damage.
For an interesting example, see Traveller, The Silly Era. There is an
extensive discussion of what you can do with the skill of Vacc-Suit 5 on that
site.

In all fairness and with much sucking up to Pete, he is the master of rules
on the fly, (mostly because we stay with the plot line once in a blue moon)
and can create rules systems in seconds without blinking. Not everyone wants
to do this. Not everyone should. I\'ll shut up now and stop blathering.

Remember Anders, the number of races who invented jumpdrives is Six: =

Nah, I *like* having my wacky ideas picked apart. ;-) And I\'m not =

I, too, refuse to be a slave to the rules.

However, I *like* the Traveller universe, and since a constant one week 
jump time is one of the underpinnings of that universe, upon which skads 
of history and background is based, I don\'t change that "rule" lightly.

I wouldn\'t even call it a rule. It\'s a basic assumption of the Traveller 
background.

To me, rules have to do with the *mechanics* of the game. Take task 
systems for instance. There\'s something I\'m willing to gut to the bone 
and change as much as I wish.

It\'s not like the _characters_ in the Traveller background run around and 
roll dice and actually have attributes and skills "programmed" into their 
bodies.

You can change the *rules* as much as you want, and it\'s still Traveller. 
Lord knows, the rules have changed a lot.

If you change *assumptions* upon which the Traveller Universe is based, 
and you ain\'t playin\' Traveller, bub.

You\'re welcome to play whatever game you want, tho\'. ;-)

PS. I don\'t dispute the fact that basic assumptions have changed in the 
different incarnations of Traveller. (like anti-gravity, thruster/heplar 
etc.) That has rankled me a bit. I like consistancy in a Universe. (I\'m 
funny that way ;-) But the publisher of each incarnation had their 
reasons.

You will note, however, that the one week thing has been set in stone, 
inviolate, since the beginning... I think it\'s likely the most important 
assumption Traveller makes about future technology...

character generation and Pilot is the only logical choice, most characters
end up picking Pilot over and over. I\'m not saying that\'s bad, I just
wanted there to be some variety in spacecraft pilots. My idea of a starship
pilot is like an air traffic controller, watching panels full of displays,
and a small craft pilot is more of a seat-of-your-pants fighter jockey. I
was planning on changing the Spacecraft cascade to:

        Starship Pilot     Edu
        Shuttle Pilot    Dex
        Sensors        Int

Starship Pilot replaces the existing Pilot skill, it is identical except it
gives 0-level Shuttle Pilot and Sensors skill and is based on Edu. Since a
starship pilot is usually flying the ship in a grav-compensated workstation
I felt the education of how to integrate all the info displayed is more
important than hand-eye coordination. Also, I wanted there to be a bit of
cultural divide between the \'professional\' large-craft pilots and the more
free-flying shuttle pilots. The name change is solely to distinguish it
from Shuttle Pilot.

Shuttle Pilot replaces the existing Ship\'s Boat skill, it is identical
except it gives 0-level Starship Pilot and Sensors skill. It is also used
for piloting star fighters and ship\'s boats. I changed the name because
"Ship\'s Boat" sounds so dorky (can you imagine a fighter jock picking up
chicks with the line "Hey babe, I fly Boats for a living"?).

I added the Sensors skill to the Spacecraft cascade because I figure a lot
of the bridge crew on starships are really sensor staff, and I wanted
another good skill for players who roll Spacecraft skill.

Comments? I considered splitting Pilot into Reaction-drive (HEPlaR) and
Reactionless (Thrust plate) cascades, but felt this only added bookkeeping
and not coolness.

Yep, I do that too. Of course, I occasionally pay attention to the rolls

Ever since I saw the Europa games (back when I was working in a retail game
store and getting a zillion questions about them), I\'ve thought about
making a game about the _other_ Europa.  You know, the one that orbits
Jupiter.  Hmmm.  Maybe this folds into my desire to run a Sol-only campaign...

Well maybe, but I figure the ID4Aliens were running from some

And I really feel the pain of all our European friends bemoaning the role
of the US in ID4.  Tell you what, you can be the heroes in the sequel.  I\'m
sure the producers would be receptive...if you ante up the 200mil it\'ll

Dissipate!

The jump interface isn\'t HOT, it\'s just filled with degenerate matter
*leaking* into hyperspace.  In fact hyperspace is dead cold and sucks heat
from the jump bubble, explaining why ship\'s don\'t have to worry all that
much about radiators. <g>

See, the "jump fuel" is used to force open a rift in space between normal
and Jump (or hyperspace).  The reason it takes 10% of ship volume
regardless of jump distance is because the "fuel" is simply opening a rift
large enough to allow the ship and a surrounding bubble of normal space to
enter hyperspace.  

During the next week this "fuel", dissipates slowly into hyperspace
thinning the surrounding shell.  After about 1 week (and it varies because
more or less "fuel"..of varying purity is injected, the "fuel" dissipates
at slightly different rates, and the local conditions of hyperspace are
never really known) the shell has thinned to the point where the ship POPS
out of hyperspace and back into normal space.

Hey, it\'s a little off the subject, but talk to me about 2300AD.  I own
Traveller 2300, but I didn\'t buy 2300AD when it came
out...figured it was the same product, different name.  Now I\'m not so
sure.

Tw2300 was a nice idea, but it just didn\'t seem have much meat on it\'s
bones.  I couldn\'t get into the system and no ship building system sort of
killed it for me.

Is 2300AD a real improvement over Tw2300?  Enough to warrent
spending the $15 to $20 to get a used copy?  What about Star
Crusier...if I could find it would it be worth looking for?

   Freedonia was of course the small, nearly bankrupt country that
called Rufus T. Firefly its leader in the film "Duck Soup".

   For the record....

   "Duck Soup", released in 1933, directed by Leo McCarey, and starring:

Groucho Marx....Rufus T. Firefly
Harpo Marx....Pinky
Chico Marx....Chicolini
Zeppo Marx....Bob Rolland
Margaret Dumont....Mrs. Teasdale
Raquel Torres....Vera Marcal
Louis Calhern....Ambassador Trentino

   Though it now is considered a film classic, "Duck Soup" was not
particularly successful when it was originally released.  Most noted
for  Harpo\'s famous mirror sequence.  This was the last film the Marx
Brothers did for Parmount Pictures before moving on to MGM.

   And now a quote:

Rufus T. Firefly: "You\'re a brave man. Go and break through the lines. 
And remember, while you\'re out there risking you\'re life and limb
through shot and shell, we\'ll be in be in here thinking what a sucker
you are."

   I\'ve threaten to do a parody adventure set in the TNE Reformation
Coalition based on this film.  First though, I have to finish work on my
Traveller version of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"....

Harold

   True, but mass communications (TV, film, the Internet) tend to
homogenize cultures.  I think that\'s what frightens some people in
Europe the most about letting in all those American films, TV programs,
etc. unmolested.  They\'re afraid that in a generation or two, French,
Dutch, Italian, (fill in the blank) culture will be erased, or at least
will have been bastardized to the point being unrecognizable to previous
generations.  We can look to the stars for the Borg, or we can simply
look at that big cultural lab across the pond and see it here on Earth.

   Of course we here in the US don\'t like being called "cultural Borgs",
but then if you understand the reference to the Borg, you may have
already been assimilated...

   As to the other side of the coin, I have noted that physical comedy
tends to transcend cultures.  That\'s why so many people in France find
Jerry Lewis to very funny, even if their understanding of English isn\'t
always perfect.

   Cool!  Now let\'s recruit some minions and go off and rape and pillage
and burn.  John, you make all the black D6s lop-sided so that they
always roll off into the floor.  David, you make them hard to find at
game stores.  Eris, you cause them to roll spectacular failures that
result in the demise of PCs.  I\'ll of course will cause hoards of
orthodox TNE players to rise out of the ground and join unsuspecting
Traveller groups where they will demand to be allowed to use D20s to
roll for tasks, thus creating conflict and causing Traveller fans to
turn on each other as they fight for dice control. <insert evil laugh

   Done.  You can propose a compromise task resolution system based on
the number 60 which will appear to allow D20 and D6 players to sit at
the same table (D20 people using 3D20, D6 people using 10D6), but will
instead only wreak further havoc and spread further chaos as people get
all those dice mixed together, argue over whether to adopt the TNE or T4
names for difficulty levels, and debate which era of the Spinward
Marches to use instead of the primary settings that came with their
respective versions of their games....

If they do, can they let me know!  It sounds just the kind of thing that I

I\'d have access

I would say yes but it seems we disagree due to different definitions. You
seem to imply that skill level is the amount (time) of training done but I
see it as the actual ability. I therefore do not like the lvl 3 is a doctor
but rather set up a task to to get a doctors title. In my universe skill
levels are not numbers but names in the progression:

Untrained/unskilled
Bad/rookie
Normal/average/fair
Good/experienced
Very good/expert
Extremely good/master

This coupled to the fact that attributes doesn\'t add to the task roll makes
my skill level equivalent to ability to do a task. When a NPC ship shoots
at the players all I need to know is the gunners skill, the pilots skill et
c. I do not need to roll up the UPP of the crew and if all SDB crews are
experienced I need only know that (that all SDB crew should be skill 3 AND
DEX 8 seems a bit stupid to me).
I do not use CT, MT, TNE or T4 tasksystem so maybe I should shut up in the
ongoing debate on how to fix the badly broken task system in T4. After all,
I will never use it myself unless you fix it to look exactly like mine or
even better like the FUDGE system.

message time calculations a bit harder to do.

First of all base the canon jumptime on 6 days instead of 7 to account for
refueling et c but mostly for a more divisible number.
Ships charge up their jumpgrid for an hour or something depending on
p-plant output et c. While in jumpspace the jumpdrive contiuously burns
fuel (ignoring canon droptanks) as of the formula:
10% of ship volume per parsec no matter what J-drive.
Time taken: 6/Jn per parsec which makes all maxjumps take 6 days. The
problem with this system is that microjumps takes almost no fuel and no
time (bye bye nonjumpcapable ships) so I had to invent the 1 hour or
something charge up time for jumpgrid. Another problem is that you always
use the higher jumpdrive, even if only going 1 parsec which makes it less
likely that traders would have J1.

I stopped using it after a few weeks as the feel for the game changed a lot
but some heretics out there might like it.

Modular Cutter: The Modular Cutter is a multi-purpose cargo vehicle
which can be fitted with a variety of 30-ton (420 m3) modules. The
outer shell of the cutter\'s mid part open as a large cargo hatch, and
a module is attached to the cutter\'s spine between the cockpit and
engine. The cargo hold has lighter armor that the rest of the cutter
(AV 20, Armor 10), but counts as normal armor (AV 40, Armor 20)
when a cargo module is carried internally.
The cutter has build-in fuel scoops which are used only when a fuel
module is or flexible 30 DT fuel bladder is fitted in the cargo hold.

The external dimensions of cargo modules are 4.60 x 25.26 m.

    'body' => 'The notion that Jump will always take 1 week (168 hours) is an
oversimplification.

	 The (IMHO) best rules for jump duration were those given in Starship
Operators Manual by DGP which stated (page 64) that the actual duration
of a jump was 124 + (2d6 * 6) hours.  This formula gives a variable
duration of between 136 hours (5 days & 16 hours) and 196 hours (8 days
& 4 hours) with a mean duration of 166 hours ( 6 days & 22 hours).

	Starship Operators Handbook further stated (pg 65) that if a
superficial mishap occured duuring jump that the ship would emerge at
the correct destination system after a jump of 80 + (3d6 * 10) hours. 
This formula gives a minimum jump duration of 110 hours ( 4 days & 14
hours) a mean duration of 185 hours (7 days & 17 hours) and a maximum
duration of 260 hours (10 days & 20 hours).  Since a superficail mishap
during jump entry is not uncommon (especially among lesser skilled (i.e.
merchant) crews, we need to realize that the "1 week" duration of jump
is just a slightly oversimplified mean duration.

	Furthermore DGP implies that starships have some control over the time
length of their jumps.  In the MegaTraveller Journal #2 they said in
response to a question about how naval forces jumping into a system can
manage to launch an assault when their ships are going to be exiting
jump many hours apart ( a good question) that " If double the jump
preperation time is spent with all the affected ships in computer link
via tight beam communicator, use the folloing formula instead  167 hours
+ (2d6 * 0.1 hour) yielding a result of 167.2 - 168.2 hours." The mean
length of such a coordinated jump would be 167.6 hours.

	This statement (while perhaps no longer canonical) has some _very_
interesting implications.  If a bunch of ships can reduce the mean
variability of their jump by _60_ fold they must have some control over
their entry into jump space and the corresponding length of their trip. 
Therefore in my campaigns the following variant rule (which requires the
use of the MT Task Duration System) is used:

	If a starship spends 100 times the normal duration (a task which
_may_not be done hastily) preparing for jump they can reduce the mean
duration of their jump as follows.  Instead of rolling 124 + (2d6 *6)
hours for the duration of the jump the ship may roll twice and use the
shortest jump duration.  My calculations indicate that the mean roll of
the lowest of 2 throws of 2d6 will be 5.267.  Therefore by using this
method a ship can reduce its average jump duration by an mean average of
10.4 hours.  This would result in an average savings of 6.25% in jump
duration if not for the time lost making these calculations.  In
Starship Operators Manual by DGP states (pg64) that the Task Time
Increment for Jump calculations is as follows.

TL	Task		Average		Average		X 100 Duration
 	Time		Seconds		Duration	in hours or
	Increment 	Duration 	x 100 (seconds) minutes  	
			
9	360s		3780s		378,000s	105h
10	240s		2520s		252,000s	70h
11	120s		1260s		126,000s	35h
12	60s		630s		63,000s		17.5h
13	30s		315s		31,500s		8.75h
14	15s		157.5s		15,750s		4.375h
15	7s		73.5s		7,350s		2.042h
16	4s		42s		4,200s		70m
The Following Tech Levels Time Duration is Extrapolated
17	2s		21s		2,100s		35m
18	1s		10.5s		1,050s		17.5m
19	0.5s		5.25s		525s		8.75m
20	0.25s		2.625s		262.5s		4.375m
	
	Please note that the mean time duration for these tasks was calculated
assuming no positive skill modifiers - obviously a skilled astrogator
could speed up the duration of these calculations somewhat.	

	Using this optional rule a ship of TL 13 (or a Tl 12 ship with a good
very good astrogator) or better can save several hours off the mean
expected time duration of a jump.  However just because they can does
not mean that they _should_.  Starships using this procedure are very
vulnerable to attack while they are plotting their jump entry.  As
starship crews are aware of this the referee can assign slight penalties
to the morale of ships which reguarly use this technique.  In my
campaign the only ships which reguarly use this technique are Naval
Couriers and Imperiallines secret J6 couriers, ships for whom speed is
THE priority and who are armed to defend themselves.  A TL 15 ship using
these techniques for every jump will be able to shave an average of 8.36
hours off of every jump.  This will save about 12 days (depending on
your conception of the route & number of jumps in) off of the
Capital/Core to Regina/Spinward Marches route.

	This rule may prove too subtle or nitpicking for some campaigns but I
see it as a logical extention of canonical theory which can make for an
interesting little variant on jump travel which will not upset the
Imperium in any way as it is too minor a change to strain continuity.  I
am assuming that this technique is not secret and was first tried by the
Rule of Man but you may change this at your whim.

	This task might be much easier or shorter in duration if conducted by a
Psionicist with Prescience (precognition), the details of such as system
are left as an exercise for the reader.

There was at least one *book* about the nuclear propulsion for aircraft
project, and it was available to check out (by dependents like me) at
the local airbase\'s library in the late 60s. I read it, but not much

I still have my set of "Traveller dice" around somewhere. They got used

It was either the country that "The Great Dictator" ruled, or the

Either way it was your typical, mythical Balkan country in the mode of
Graustark and Ruritania.

It was also the name of an asteroid that figured prominently in Jack

EPT was published by TSR. It\'s still around, and on its third or fourth
publisher. There\'s a mailing list, and a (low traffic once you get rid
of the spam) newsgroup:
 list:	blueroom@prin.edu
group:	alt.games.frp.tekumel
  ftp:	ftp://nexus.prin.edu

BTW, *technically* EPT is an SF RPG!

John D. MacDonald. Much better known for his mystery stories, he *has*
written some SF. "Prisoners of the Sky" is so-so. "The Girl, the Gold
Watch, and Everything" is much better, and while not strictly
Traveller, is easily adapted. It\'s the gimmick with a guy inheriting a
watch that lets him "stop time".

Just remember to *do* it that way. 

This would be one of those things where just as you take that tricky
shot you slip on a banana peel, the shot goes wild and ricochets all
over the place, and the target ducks *into* the path of the ricochet.

Or the bomb you are trying to defuse goes off, but due to a freak

booby-trap on wind up landing safe and sound outside the destruction

Met:Alpha *was* out before Traveller. I bought it. I *think* that
"Villians and Vigilantes" (superhero RPG) was also out before
Traveller, but I wouldn\'t swear to it. 

There were also some SF wargames, and SF miniatures rules that could be
used by the desperate. I used some of them to add SF weaponry to my D&D
games (I started playing in 74).

Sorry, but D&D started out with three digest sized booklets, just like
Traveller. It was based on the "fantasy" appendix to the Chainmail
miniatures rules. The first *supplement* to D&D was Greyhawk, the next
was Blackmoor, and Eldritch Wizardry was either the third or fourth. 

I know, because i *own* all of these. The 8.5x11 booklets were "Basic"
D&D, which later grew into the "new" D&D (at which point the old digest
sized books became "original" D&D). These came out around the same time
as AD&D first edition. And much later than things like Tunnels and
Trolls, "Monsters! Monsters!", Arduin Grimoire, etc.

One thing to keep in mind is that white dwarfs, neutron stars, and
black holes *don\'t* have thermonuclear flux. The WDs are radiating away
heat energy, and only shine for such a long time because they are so
hot at formation and have so little surface area to radiate away the heat.

It\'s possible to get an intermittent tramline between a black hole and
a star under special circumstances (see "He fell into a Hole", one of
the CoDominium short stories). Doing so with neutron stars or white
dwarfs is going to be a lot harder.

Smoke consists of *very* small (micron sized) *solid* particles. In
vacuum, the hard part is getting them distributed evenly. They\'ll come
out in jets, from the grenade and travel in essentially a straight line
(ie cone shaped path if the grenade is stationary). 

Worse, without air, there\'s nothing to slow the fall of the particles.
In air, they are bounced around by Brownian motion. In a vacuum, they
act like any other solid body. So if there is any gravity, they\'ll fall
to the floor just as fast as a baseball. And there goes your "cover".

Paint would be a bit easier, as it is spread by the (minor) explosion
of the grenade. On the downside, you\'ll need a formulation that\'ll dry
at a suitable rate. Not too fast (or it\'ll dry before it hits most of
the target and before it can spread around), not too slow (or it\'ll be
too easy to clean off).

Not necessarily. She can\'t force them to change the plot. But the one
thing they *can\'t* do is force an author to let them use his name if
they\'ve screwed it up too badly. If nothing else, the author can make
them use a pen name. Harlan Ellison uses "Cordwainer Bird" (giving them
the bird) for the turkeys they make out of his stuff. David Gerrold
uses "Noah Ward" (No Award). The one Heinlein used for his stories that
wound up going to the *really* awful pulps was "Lyle Monroe".

So she could likely get the name changed, but I suspect getting it
totally removed is what she\'d rather have happen.

Here\'s a free suggestion for anyone with the reference materials at
hand...

Assume the 10% spread is due to the presence of multiple isotopes of
lathanum. So if you could afford to seperate the isotopes, you\'d get
more accuracy. Of course, if lathanum has only one stable isotope, this
won\'t work.

There\'s a rare earth element that is the *obvious* candidate for
shorter jump times. And the presence of impurities should increase the
uncertainty. Technetium. :-)

It has *no* stable isotopes. So it\'ll be very expensive and hazardous
to use. And since it\'s continually breaking down into other elements,
the uncertainty in jump duration goes up as the grid ages.

The Air Force had *several* different plans for nuclear propelled
aircraft. The ramjet proposal was the most extreme. There were a couple
others using a reactor to supply power to propellers (via steam &
turbines in one version). They had their problems.

There was a story in F&SF(?) which later came out as a paperback set in
an alternate history where we actually *built* one of the steam powered
ones, and it got used.

Vacuum has *no* temperature. The liquid would cool from evaporation,
and would cool or heat via radiation depending on the temp of its
surroundings. And it\'ll gain/lose heat via conduction once it actually
*touches* something.

The bit about "not exposed to sunlight" only applies if there\'s a *lot*
of insulation between the lit side and the dark side. Coat a sheet of
metal with carbon black (99% absorbent of incoming energy) and expose
it to the sun. Touch the side that\'s in shadow, and you\'ll fry your
glove.

BTW, there\'s an interesting phenomenon that was discovered in the early
space program. Food crumbs floating in the cabin were observed to drift
to the window. It couldn\'t be air currents, as the air in the cabin
didn\'t circulate (it was only there so the astronaut could open his
faceplate to eat and drink). The final answer was quite simple, but not
anything that had been thought of in advance. It\'s something that bored
crews might use to amuse passengers or to trick a new crew member who
hasn\'t been in space before.

So, the question is.... What is going on?
























The answer? The window faced open space, at 3K. So the side of the
crumb facing the window lost heat via radiation. It was a little bit
colder than the other side. So when air molecules bounced off that
side, they rebounded slower than ones that hit the other side. The net
effect was to push the crumb towards the window.

This only works with small, light particles. But I\'m sure that
*someone* on the list will come up with a practical joke that makes use
of this obscure bit of physics. :-)

They also created "Warriors of Mars", a set of miniatures rules set on
Barsoom (Edgar Rice Burrough\'s Mars of the John Carter novels). Alas,
they neglected to get permission from the Burroughs estate. So they had
to pull it from the market.

Also, since the monsters included some from Warriors of Mars, they had
to do a quick replacement of those *and* of the names they\'d borrowed
from Tolkien\'s works (hobbits and Ents)

There was also the infamous Tunnels & Trolls. I loved the way they
handled combat. For a quick & dirty hack n\'slash, it was great. Weapons
were good for X dice of damage (perhaps with extra bonuses as in "1 die
+2"). Both sides rolled up all their attacks and totalled them. The
side with the higher total inflicted the *difference* upon the saide
with the lower total. Armor took hit points. So if your sheild was good
for 5 points, after taking that much it was scrap and you got the excess.

Quick & dirty. I daresay it could be adapted to Traveller if someone
was sick enough. :-)

Tactical Studies Rules. And their first publication (before The Dragon)
was The Strategic Review. It had such lovelies as "Sturmgeschutz and
Sorcery" subtitled "How effective is a Panzerfaust against a troll,
Heinz?" Which was a crossover between D&D and their WWII miniatures
rules. I still own my complete set of them, plus the copy of Tractics
that the above article inspired me to buy. One of the few games with
rules for use of nuclear weapons.... :-)

	Ugh.  Too much math.  <Sheryl Crow music begins> "all I wanna do,
is slouch towards Bethlehem to be born..."

<//popculture&poetry&religion abuse mode= off>

	But actually, come to think of it, a base 60 number system makes a
certain amount of sense.  Of course, those poor benighted souls using 10
d6\'s would, if the Low End of The Distribution Factor (something based on
the standard deviation of the 6 d6\'s rolled) have to make a 1d6 +1d1 roll
(i.e. roll a d6 and flip a coin) or a 3d3 roll (actually preferable) and
subtract that from their score in order to determine whether they actually
manage to roll a 3 on 10d6.

	Let me get back to you on this.

No - a grapple bolts the craft flush to the hull (like the old

and part outside (like the old merc cruiser.)

Perhaps Wildstar should make some docking ring rules for QSDS real quick...
or we could all agree that the surface area requiremetns for grapples are

	He didn\'t mean along a diameter. IIRC correctly, the idea was
"ballistic tunnels" between two points on the earth, not necessarily
along the diameter. Turned out that travel time was constant regardless
of the length of the tunnel. If it was a shallow tunnel, you wound up
moving more slowly. If it was a deep tunnel (hence longer distance
covered on the surface of the sphere), the vehicle moved more quickly.

Ummm... Fudge factor?  I haven\'t formalized it, and since my players
have had exactly one ship since, a 200dT Far Trader. I haven\'t done 
more than say, "check the jump grid every 4-5 hours".  If one of 
the gearheads decided to take the idea and run with it, I\'d love it. >>

How about: no. man-hrs per week monitoring drive = sqrt(disp)

eg  100dt = 10hr/week (just under an hour and a half a day)
    200dt = 14hr/week (2hr/day)
   1000dt = 31hr/wk (4.5hr/day)
   5000dt = 70hr/wk (10hr/day - full time job for 1 engineer)
    10kdt = 100hr/wk (14hr/day - 2 engineers)
    50kdt = 223hr/wk (32hr/day - 4 engineers)
   100kdt = 316hr/wk (45hr/day - 6 engineers)
   500kdt = 707hr/wk (101hr/day - 13 engineers)

Might I point out that since this was written during the bombardment of Ft.
McHenry by the Royal Navy, it actually shows the *British* fondness of
blowing things up.  Also, since they couldn\'t even drop the flagpole, it
shows a certain lack of competence.

When it comes to anthem lyrics though, you can\'t beat the French and their
images of dead invaders.

Yeah.  I\'d play this like they had a problem dissipating (new 
term--thanks to a couple of TMLers) the energy from the jump grid.

Maybe thay had an uneven trouble spot.  It took extra time to 
dissipate the energy evenly--but they still arrived on time.

Good show, Newman!  I have that issue, and now that you mention it, I 
rememer reading it.

This would lend creedence to the notion that there are, or could be, 
faster ways to dissipate the energy from the grid.

See, those sneady government types are already using a system.

You should also check out Project Farstar in one of the old Challenge 
magazines.  It talked about alternative, experimental jump drives 
that attempted to access the seventh and higher weave of jump space.

I\'d forgotten those numbers, have to remember to start enforcing that.  BTW,
if anybody spots a copy of SOH anywhere, please grab it, and I\'ll be more
than happy to cover the cost and shipping.

I think you\'re misreading this slightly.  IMHO, the rule was supposed to
simulate the careful coorodination of a fleet to insure that their jump
profiles were nearly identical.  By this m,ethod, they can insure that most
of the fleet will arrive withing a short period.

For a single merchant ship, allowing the astrogator to try and narrow the
jump window down makes some sense, but I think it violates the spirit of the
rules to allow time shaving like this.

Just my Cr .02

the campaign its self was.

If the dex task has been made the GM can roll dice randomly to

I hate to say it, but this book as turned out exactly as I had 
feared, and it has little value to me.

Basically, you are paying 24 bucks for sector data and 9 incomplete
maps.

I will layer my criticisms below with constructive comments on how I
think FS could have been a much better supplement.

What you get:
	1)  Introduction on page 4;  short story/adventure campaign idea of 
	page 	5.

	2)  9 maps of the sectors in and around Core.  These maps are 
	incomplete, showing only the location of the world, if it has water 
	or not, and if a gas giant is included in the system.  Other 
	pertinent information is missing from the maps, and only a 
	sprinkling of even the planet names are included!

	3)  27 pages of incomplete sector information for players.  These 
	pages only have the physical data from a system listed.  Other data 
	like starport type, government, etc. are left blank.

	4)  68 pages of complete sector data for referees.  These pages fill 
	in the blanks in the data for the players.



Honest Review:

I lobbied hard against the inclusion of incomplete player maps here 
on the TML when the idea was first proposed.  I would have preferred 
complete maps for the referee and one blank map for refs to 
photocopy for their players.  That way, the ref could let the 
players know what information he wants them to, and it wouldn\'t have 
taken up one third of the book.

All you\'re paying for in this book is maps.  To me, that\'s a lot of 
context without any content.  I wanted to see a lot of information 
about these sectors of space.  I know that\'s supposed to be covered 
in MO, and although that book has a great deal of info in it (once 
I\'ve had tome to  digest it, I\'ll post my thoughts), from flipping 
through the book, I can tell that the information in M0 is focussed 
on the entire M0 campaign.

That\'s how it is supposed to be.  Detailed sector information (I\'m 
not talking about system stats here) should be in FS.  That\'s its 
place.

Those 27 pages used for incomplete player info could have been put to 
much better use as library data and comments about the people, 
places, and races within the sectors covered.

Marc states in his introduction that the book is based on the Atals 
of the Imperium.  I\'ve got the Atlas, and I\'ve got to say that FS is 
a much better supplement.  The Atlas gives you maps sans ANY sector 
information.  If you think I\'m upset about FS, you should have seen 
me when I bought the Atlas.

If maps are what you need, then this is the supplement for you.  
Don\'t get me wrong.  I want maps for the Traveller setting.  In fact, 
I already have many of the ones included in FS.  But if I was a new 
Traveller player, I\'d want a source to find the maps for the M0 
setting.  The problem is, I\'d still want more than what I\'ve gotten 
in FS.  

The big strength of Traveller is its history and gaming universe.  
All of the detailed information makes this place a fun, intriuging, 
exciting place to adventure in.  This strength is definitly lacking 
in FS.

As for the look of the book, it\'s OK.  There are no interior 
illustrations.  Foss did the picture on the front and back, and 
again, they look OK.  I don\'t really like Foss\' work associated with 
Traveller, but I\'ve got to admit that some of his stuff is growing on 
me.

I do like the way T4 looks from the outside, though.  All the black, 
the red border, the shining metal titles with red highlights, and the 
big, colorful picture on each of the supplement\'s covers make this 
game stand out well against its competitiors on the rack at the game 
store.

I think that both the Foss pieces on the front and back cover of FS 
is definitely Travelleresque--especially the one on the front.  The 
problem that I\'m having with Foss is his big, huge, bulky, mammoth 
sized space ships he puts into his pieces.

I\'m not agains big, and big has its place in the Traveller universe.  
But, Foss\' particular big ships seem more applicable to the Star Wars 
universe.  The things just don\'t look functional enough to be in 
Traveller.  

The pic on the front is an example of what I\'m talking about.  The 
ground work looks very Traveller, but you\'ve got this huge, bulbus 
space ship hovering over the grav vehicles in the desert.

Again, I can accept it, but I also think it can be, and should be, 
done better.

I can\'t tell what the pic on the back is.  You\'ve got giant mushrooms 
that look like they would be growing underwater.  There\'s a boat type 
water craft hitting one of them with its keel, but the boat looks 
like it should be a surfact water vehicle.  Then the mushroom looks 
like it is exploding as the boat hits it.

Just as I\'m deciding if this is an under water picture or set on the 
surface, I notice a spaceship type ship flying just over the vessel 
trailing exhaust or thruster streaks and above it are dots of light 
that I take to be stars.

So now, I can\'t decide if this shot is meant to be on the bottom of 
the ocean, and the surface of it, or out in space.  Looking hard, I 
decide that the vessel is a water surface craft, and these mushrooms 
are growing up out of the ocean.  The mushrooms contain some sort of 
explosive gas, like hydrogen, which explains the explosion.  It\'s 
night time, so that\'s why we can see the stars, and it looks a little 
foggy on the open ocean, so the flying craft is trailing a vapor 
trail.

What I can\'t explain is why this ship/boat is travelling so fast (you 
should see the wave it is kicking up) next to these mushrooms if it 
knows how dangerous they are.  Heck, just their immense size should 
give the boat pilot alarm even if he didn\'t know that they explode.  

Anyway, I\'ve got just a few more comments, and then I\'ll be through.

Just given the current content of the book, there are still a few 
items missing that should have been included.  One is the column 
headings in the players section.  These are included in the ref\'s 
section, and although it is not hard to figure out what column is 
what, the heading should have been there.

Also, I\'m an old time Traveller player, so I already know what all of 
the columns mean in the ref\'s section.  My concern is that a new 
player purchasing this book might, and probably will, have a problem 
deciphering what all of the columns mean.  There has already been 
some questions on the TML as to what the PBG column is.  Given this, 
there should have been a couple of paragraphs somewhere in the book 
telling the reader how to read the info given.  Since sector data is 
92% of the book, this should have never left the proof readers before 
going to print without this information.



Summary:

All in all, you can tell that I am very disappointed with this book, 
and I think it could have been much more than it is.  Even if you 
just need the maps, $24 is a high price to pay.  If the price had 
been, say $10, then I\'d be much more happy with the result.  Although 
it looks much better, the FS supplement gives you about the same 
gaming  material as those old Judges Guild supplements.  The 
difference is that the old JG books were printed on newsprint making 
them much cheaper.  You got what you paid for with their supplements 
(not to say that the JG supplements were great--not by any means.  
It\'s just that they were much cheaper, and the content you got was 
worth the price you paid).

There is one thing that I liked about FS.  Although it\'s a tiny 
thing, I very much liked the comments column of the sector 
data in the ref\'s section of the book.  There\'s not a lot of info 
here, but Marc did let us know where Ancient sites were, where 
certain homeworlds were, if a certain world was Droyne or Chirper, 
etc.  It\'s not a lot of content, but it is content, and I appreciated 
that.

I\'ve saved the biggest question of all for last.  Looking at my 
Library Information, I see that the First Survey was published in 
420.

You can see my question here.  Why was FS published for M0 anyway?  
I agree that maps of the milieu need to be published, but why call it 
FS?  First Survey should have been published for M400, not M0.

This information might have been better placed in the M0 sourcebook 
or some other supplement titiled differently.

And that\'s the way I see it.

2300AD is Traveller 2300 Revision. No major changes other than dropping the
Traveller name, and slightly more detail in the background.

Star Cruiser is a decent system, limited, but able to be tweaked extensively.

If you can find it, the _Colonial Atlas_ is very useful, as is the
_Earth/Cybertech Sourcebook_.

The Vehicle Guide and the Equipment guide are what should have been in the
box to begin with, but are very good anyway.

_Kafer Dawn_ and _Aurora_ were both well written adventure/supplement books.

I like 2300\'s system mechanics. Combat is deadly. Characters are fun to
generate. Only Problem is no rules for running alien PC\'s AFAIK.

And, NO, they are NOT for grabs (well, I can spare a copy or two of kafer dawn)

copyright dates well before Traveller\'s.

And there wasn\'t just one citation either.  There were several SF 
RPG\'s that were supposed to be published before our beloved 
Traveller.

I had always thought that Traveller was the first, but when those 
posts hit my mailbox, I said, "OK, I\'ve learned something new."

Then, I\'m looking through my copy of M0 and almost drop my glass as I 
read the introduction.  In the second sentence, Lester Smith writes 
that Traveller is the "world\'s first science-fiction role-playing

So, now I\'m confused.

It was written by Francis Scott Key, an American prisoner aboard a British
vessel during the shelling of Fort McHenry (I believe), part of the War of
1812.  All night, Key watched anxiously by the light of artillery fire to
see if the flag atop the fort would be struck, signalling surrender.  The
colors stayed up, and at dawn Key was so moved that he wrote the song
which became our National Anthem, using an old English drinking song as
the melody.

Actually it was :-)  It\'s called \'The First Fantasy Campaign\' and was

    'body' => 'I\'m coming increasingly to believe that external grapples have no place in
QSDS, and a questionable one in SSDS.  Here\'s my reasoning:

An external grapple holds the carried ship *entirely outside* the hull of
the carrying ship.  Let\'s take an 800 ton vessel carrying a 50 ton vessel
on an external grapple.  The grapple volume itself is taken as part of the
volume of the 800 ton vessel (15 tons, on a streamlined hull); this is the
*only* volume cost associated with a grapple.

However, when the carried vessel is attached, the resulting vessel is no
longer 800 tons, but *850*...the 800 ton original hull, plus 50 tons of
carried craft.  Remember, the 50 tons of carried craft are *not*
subtracted from available volume on the carrying craft; therefore, they
*must* be additional.  This increased volume should then be taken into
account in calculating jump drive size, maneuver drive size, fuel, and so
forth -- but it\'s not.  Also, even if we fix this by including the 50 dt
craft in the 800 ton vessel\'s volume costs, what we then really have is a
750 dt craft, with (possibly) a 50 dt craft clipped onto it...and then the
hull cost, armor, life support, and other calcs from QSDS are thrown
totally out of whack.

So, in short:  External grapples are a can of worms you really need
something of FFS-level complexity to handle properly.  For that matter,
docking rings are in the same category, if part of the carried vessel
extends outside the hole (i.e., volume cost to carrying ship is less than
carried craft volume).

We really really ought to have some formal judgement on this point by the
THUDDD/NAH powers-that-be before the Merc Cruiser competition closes, as
it has a *big* effect on this particular design.

As one of the more vocal heretics, let me say I don\'t have a big problem
with all jumps taking about a week...as I\'ve explained in other posts. 
OTOH, I don\'t have a problem with other folks playing the game however
they want either.  I\'ve run games where ships maneuvered and even fought
battles in hyper/jumpspace, but it still took about a week for most
ships to travelling between systems.

I guess what makes me a heretic is that I don\'t want to make everyone
follow "the one true way" of Traveller.  If you want to play in a
particular universe that conforms to what is generally called "canon"
fine, but don\'t "have a cow" if I (or others) do things a different
way.  It bugs me when people jump on folks who express a contrary
opinion by saying, "That\'s not canon! That\'s not the Traveller way!"

Anders this isn\'t aimed at you. It\'s just something I wanted to get off
my chest.

I suppose what I\'m really saying is "Viva la` difference!"

The simple answer is that this is the first survey of the Imperium as it 
existed early in its history. Later (c.4th or 5th centuries), the 
Imperial Grand Survey ranged over a much wider area. When the Grand 
Survey was repeated a few centuries later, the two were distinguished by

By this time, the original Survey of the core regions was long forgotten.

	I\'m not sure if I by your energy dissipation cooling of the jump grid
theory as the determinant of the length of the jump (and I\'d rather not
get into it with you) - but - whatever rationalization we use to explain
jump duration - this rule clearly implies that starships DO have some

	I have this article & I thought it was pretty good, I reccomend it to
others interested in jump space.  It appeared in Challenge #33 pg 33-37
and was written by Marcus Roland.  However most of the variant drives in
this article, if allowed to work, have the potential to alter canon
drastically.  The variant I propose, which will only save a few percent
of the time off the jump, will not.

	Yes but as written the rule will not only insure that they arrive
within a short period of time but allowas them to reduce the mean
variability of the duration of the jump 60 fold.  This statement implies
to me that the ships are controlling the point of their entry into jump
space & therefore the time duration of their journey to the other side
of the jump space & exit into the regular universe.

	If all they meant to do was insure that the fleet would all come out at
the same time they would have published a rule going something like
this:
	
	If all ships spend twice the normal time preparing for jump in tight
beam communication with each other the fleet may roll once for the mean
jump duration of the jump using the normal (124 + (2d6 *6)hours) to
represent the mean length of the jump.  Individual ships will dejump
 (2d6 - 7) * 0.1 hours away from this time.

	But this _is_not_ what they said (although maybe its what they should
have said) and the rule as given clearly implies some kind of minor
control over the length of the jump.  I have chosen to expand this
theory with a very minor variation that seems to be
1) a logical continuation of this theory
2) cool
and 3) too small a variation to threaten canon

	Yes maybe it is contrary to the "spirit" of the overall rules but this
rule is the most specific one we have and what it says to me is that
ships do have some control over the length of the jump.  I rationalize
this as control over their entry vector to jump space.

	Besides it just seems to me that since canonical statements indicate
that even at the Ancients level of technology (TL 20 - 35) a conrolled
misjump is impossible that this line of research is the only wa to go to
speed up jump.  If you cannot build a controlled Jump 8 ship but you can
manipulate your entry into jump space so that your TL 20 Jump 6 ship
will always take 110 hours per jump(4 days and 14 hours the theoretical
minimum length of a regular jump assuming a superficial mishap during
jump entry & the minimum roll on the duration table) you are saving
about the same length of time on a long trip.

	It is only logical to presupose that if a jump is possible with a given
duaration all you need to do is figure out how to insure that every jump
takes this long.

In place of the second modular cutter a Meson gun was placed to help provide
better fire support for the ground troops. In addition the bridge provides
one workstation for the troop commander.

The large Stateroom is for the captain/owner. The rest of the crew gets small
staterooms and the troops are relegated to bunks, except for three of the
command staff who get small staterooms. The number of troops can be increased
if some of the troops are crosstrained for the small craft and for gunnery
(especially the meson gun and missile batteries, allowing two more squads
if necessary).

Sidenotes: Not to bad for a first attempt at QSDSv1.5 I guess. But I\'m not
really happy with the design, even increasing the tonnage to 1000, it\'s hard
to design what I\'d really like to see. Hangers take up way to much room
for one.

   Yes indeed it was Fort McHenry during the War of 1812.  The British
fleet was attempting to get to Baltimore, where presumably they would
have performed a "hit and run" raid like the one they had days earlier
on Washington, D.C., which left the Presidential residence a burned out
shell (the building was later restored and several coats of white wash
used to cover the scorch marks, thus the White House), and several other
important buildings in ruins, including the Capitol.  President Madison
and the rest of the government had evacuated the city before the British
troops arrived.

   It has been said that the raid on Washington was in retaliation for
the American burning of York (Toronto), the capital of Lower Canada at
the time (I\'m sure our Canadian friends will correct me if I\'m wrong). 
One would suppose that the British were also still sore about being
kicked out of Lake Erie, and wanted to make sure the Americans knew who
was in charge of the Atlantic, should they get any ideas.

   Key penned the words (as a poem), but he didn\'t come up with the
melody.  Credit goes to Judge J. H. Nicholson, Key\'s brother-in-law. 
The melody is indeed from an old English drinking song called "Anacreon
in Heaven".  Because the melody was not written expressly for the words
of the poem, The National Anthem is a rather difficult song to sing
well, especially for untrained voices.  This is why it is so easy to
make a jackass of yourself in public performing it in front of a live
audience.  Best performance of it I\'ve ever seen: Whitney Houston\'s
before the Super Bowl in 1991.  Most creative: Jimi Hendricks at
Woodstock in 1969.  Worst: My own.  I am currently living under a
voluntarily lifetime ban from singing, though I have been seen reciting
the words of Key\'s poem to music at baseball games.

    'body' => '     Okay, I just got the two new books this afternoon, and I\'ve skimmed 
through both and read the first chapters of "Milieu 0".  What follows is
my chart reviewing the entire line thus far (for perspective) to be
followed by some specific comments about the new books.

Book           Content Design Useful   Cost          Overall
Traveller	B+	C-	A	A-(20-25)	B
Starships	D	D-	C-	D (5-8)		D
Central Supply	A	B-	A-	C (10-12)	B
Aliens Archive	B	B-	B	C+(10-14)	B-
JTAS 25		B+	B+	B-	A (4-6)		B+
Milieu 0	A	B-	A	B-(12-16)	B+
First Survey	B-	B-	B-	D-(5-10)	C-

Explanation of the terms: Content is the words of the book, plain and
simple.  Design is the physical appearance: editing, artwork, layout.
Usefulness is how much I think I\'ll actually use what\'s inside.  Cost is
how the price of the book compares to what I think it should have cost
(which is listed in paranthesis).  Overall is the average of the four.

Now for some more directed comments.  "Milieu 0" looks very good so far,
contentwise.  Of the chapters I\'ve read in detail (the first two), in the
first I appreciated the very biased and jingoistic history, as well as the
"rough draft" rebuttal (including the irony (assuming no foul play) that
he suggests Fusion+ should have been used to improve infrastructure, only
to be killed in a traffic accident!)  The second chapter is also very
good, and completely dispels any comparison between the economic machine
that is the Imperium and Star Trek\'s Federation.  I really liked all the
adventure hooks, but think they should have been set apart somehow from
the "in-character" text they accompanied (but this is more of a design
concern).  The biggest disappointment so far is, as someone else has
already mentioned, that the written history just plain DOES NOT match the
Core Sector map.  Unless I come across some Major surprises in future
chapters, I can\'t see any problems with this book\'s content at all.
     The layout-design has the same problems as the rest of the line thus
far, but I remain optimistic that when the new design team takes charge
this will improve, so I won\'t dwell on it.  One comment, though, is the
Chris Foss drawings: I liked the paintings in the first book, but these
drawings seem to have the same drawbacks (no "Traveller feel") without the
up-side (impressive paintings).  Several of them look like they might have
made good paintings, but as they are they just look rushed and sloppy.
     It\'s still overpriced, but since the content is so rich, I don\'t mind
as much.  Overall, as my grades above reflect, I think this is probably
the best T4 product yet, and I wish to congratulate all the writers for a
job very well done.

     The news about "First Survey" is far less happy.  I\'m not afraid to
say that I think Marc Miller made a very poor decision to follow the
wishes of this list, as it has led to something resembling the worst of
both worlds. This book has the least usable content in it of anything
since "Starships."  The layout is poor: columns of pale Courier font are
both hard to read and take up much more space than, for instance, the font
that DGP used to use.  At very least, a small enough font should have been
used to allow two columns in the Referee Data, and to make the Player data
easier to follow (those columns tend to run together).  In addition, the
data itself is severely lacking.  There are far too few "full data" worlds
presented, and even some of those are off in the middle of nowhere; I\'d
much prefer to have seen more logic applied here.  I notice that although
the homeworlds of lots of minor races are included, this doesn\'t seem to
include any of those from "Aliens Archive" (oops).
     From a design standpoint, in addition to my above complaint about the
wasted space from using Courier-type font, I also notice that, based upon
the original design prospectus, we\'re missing approx. 36 sectors!  Sure,
as presented there\'s no room for them, but if the font were shrunk to
allow each sector\'s description to take approx. 2 pp, then the 9 sectors
presented would take ~27pp, 1/4 of the 112pp book, with plenty of room for
the other promised sectors (or at least most of them).  What becomes of
the Ref Data then?  Well, quite frankly, we don\'t need it.  I was on the
losing side of this debate earlier, so I won\'t dwell too long here, but
from looking at all these sector descriptions, in 99% of the cases does
anyone honestly find this (obviously randomly determined) data to be
really useful, or anything we couldn\'t come up with on our own?  If the
number of "full data" worlds had been expanded to a reasonable number,
all of those worlds had been generated by hand to make sense (and match
the background presented in M0), we\'d been given all the promised sectors,
and a short section of Library data, including the info from the
"Comments" column of the ref data, I\'d have been happy.
     As it is, this book is basically a collection of mostly-blank map
guidelines, some world data that in most cases I fully intend to ignore,
a one-page scenario idea that, while interesting, doesn\'t carry through
with the actual content of the book, all presented in a reader-unfriendly 
and space-wasting format.  A reasonable price for this would be somewhere
in the neighborhood of $5-10, but $23 for this amount of useful info is
ridiculous.  I\'m afraid that this is the worst T4 product since
"Starships," and that I would urge people NOT to buy it (unless you can
find it for really cheap).

     Oh well, I suppose one out of two isn\'t too terribly bad of an
average, and if "Emperor\'s Arsenal" lives up to the high standard set by
"Central Supply Catalog," then we should still be in pretty good shape.

The UWPs for 1005 for size, atmos, and hydro were retained. The pop was
recalculated, and new gov and law were generated based on the new pop. Then
TL was calculated, taking into account the old (1105 TL). If the name has a
period (.) after it, it is newly generated (in Vilani). If there is no
period, the name is the same as from 1105.

Let me clear up your confusion, Traveller was the first *good* SFRPG to be
published, and is the SFRPG that everything else is compared to, but it
wasn\'t the first to be published.  That was probably the Flying Buffalo
abomination, "Spacebunnies and Starnookie"...wasn\'t *that* its name? ;->

Now back to *important* stuff...how\'s KB 2.0 coming?  Did your idea pan
out?  Did you get my post in answer to your questions?

Eris,
  still beating that dead horse!

Does the book say the highest three are used for damage?  I don\'t recall
seeing that in T4 anywhere, but that\'s the way I do it too. OTOH, armor
absorbs damage *first* so it absorbs the highest rolls.

What\'s this "in order" stuff?  Don\'t you just roll all 6 dice?  I would. 
What I\'d do is have the armor absorb all it could from the highest dice
down and then allocate the rest to the character.

(6,6,5) absorbed for (1+1+1) points giving,  3+3+1+(1+1+1) = 10

The hits would be spread over the 3 Physical Attributes..assuming this is a
second hit, or applied to a single Attribute asuming it was the first hit.

> Character B) No armour

>   If the damage rolled is in order 1,3,6,5,3,6 - then
>   the damage would be 6+5+6+(0)=17

This I agree with.  With no armor the highest 3 dice all hit the character.

I\'d say 10 is a LOT better than 17!  Again, I don\'t see where flex makes
the damage worse...in any situation.

Actually, I think the method the book has in mind is a little
different from this, though.  As I read it you\'d take the 6d and subtract 3
BEFORE you roll, just rolling 3 dice, ie.

6d - 3armor = (1+1+1)+d6+d6+d6 

On first hit all points are applied to a single Attribute.
On subsequent hits each of the d6\'s and 1\'s are applied to different
Attributes, well obviously there\'s some doubling up because you only have 3
Attributes to work with and you have 6 hit groups to apply.

Having written all this, let me just say...I don\'t much care for the
system.  Either version.

Hmm. My ruling was that fleets DO all exit jump many hours apart from each
other. Therefore an attacking fleet always meets at a prearranged staging
point (usually near a gas giant) in the target system about a day for
everyone to arrive before attacking. I felt this was a better rule because
it makes fleets have to be more cautious and secretive instead of just
launching blitzkreigs. Also, this makes it feasible to put single ships on
patrol watching for attacks; they can get the hell away from a fleet before
they are overwhelmed.

I remember one campaign I was a player in where we were guarding a gas
giant and a Chrysanthemum-class destroyer jumped into sensor range. The
pilot floored it and we just barely got away!

Hey, this is good! It also explains why ships smaller than 100 dtons can\'t
jump; it\'s the same reason black holes below a certain size don\'t exist
(naturally, that is). Since the shell will dissipate at its surface, which
increases with the square of the size, while the volume increases with the
cube of the size, below certain point (100 dtons, obviously) it will
dissipate faster than it can be created. Uh, oh; if the limit really is
close to 100 dtons then scout ships must be just a few kg of hydrogen away
from going poof each jump...

But if this is the case, why can\'t we then put more than 10% of the ship\'s
volume of fuel in to make a bigger bubble that takes longer to dissipate so
we can go farther?

Marc, there\'s no doubt that the French are as blood-thursty a lot as we

Well, Ken, it isn\'t unknown for people who make reference to historical
facts and get those facts wrong :) Also, STARFARING was a fairly obscure
game (I had never even heard of it until I read HEROIC WORLDS). Also, it is
entirely possible that Traveller may have been in development before any of
these. What I was referring to was the date of U.S. publication.
        Another more cynical viewpoint-and one which I strongly doubt- is
that claiming to be the first Science Fiction RPG gives you a measure of
prestige.
Prestige can sometimes sell books. But I think it\'s more likely that Lester
ma have been laboring under the historical misapprehension that many of us,
myself included, did for a long time.
        And one thing is certain. Traveller may not have been the first
science-fiction RPG by some technicality or another, but it was the FOREMOST
one for many years and is still more of an influence on all that came after
it than any of the other games mentioned.

No, I didn\'t get your answers.  I got Marc\'s and a few others, and I 
was surprised that I didn\'t get any more than that.  If you\'ve still 
got the post, then resend the information.

As far as KBv2.0 goes, I\'m still testing.  I did some preliminary 
tests, but I haven\'t had a lot of time to work on it these last few 
days.

The preliminary test showed that the system needed some tweaking, so 
I need to do that and test some more.

I\'m not throwing out a system with holes in it--not after that debate 
we just went through.  

I\'ll keep you posted.

 I always subract space for the craft as well as the grapple. As you
mention, this throws your hull calculations out of whack (unless you\'re
attaching 100 tons of craft), but I think it\'s a small price to pay for
simplicity in this case.

I\'m working my way through Sherwood Smith/Dave Trowbridge\'s Exordium 
Series. I\'m up to Book Two: Ruler of Naught (as I\'ve said before, great 
stuff, especially for those who are running Traveller!).

One nifty little gadet used in Book Two is the "tacponder". Like the 
Traveller Universe, the Exordium\'s navy has a limit on the speed of 
communications: the fastest ship is the fastest way for communications to 
travel (actually there\'s one way around that...involving some technology 
of a lost race called the Ur, sort of like the Ancients...but that\'s 
another story). In order to help with communications and the transmission 
of news/orders, the Navy has placed "tacponders" in various systems. A 
ship jumps in, signals the tacponder and gets news and orders. At the 
same time, the ship can update the tacponder with its log, recent 
encounters, news, etc.

This might be useful for T4, especially as we currently don\'t (if I 
remember my history correctly) have an X-Boat network and we have an 
expanding Imperium: Scouts could drop off the tacponder system by system 
as they go outwards, naval ships could then utilize and expand the 
network as they incorporate (ahem) systems into the Imperium.

The Exordium books are fairly similar to Traveller and definately 
Traveller in feel. I especially like the depiction of some of the alien 
races, the nobles, Rifters (pirates) and the cruisers and battleships 
(most of which have linear accelerators for those gosh darn relatavistic 
rocks!).

	According to my interpretation of the 3D maximum damage rule I wouldn\'t
count the three ones that are absorbed by armor in the above example.  The
only damage inflicted is the three full damage dice.  Whether you use the
three highest dice or the three lowest dice for the damage inflicted
depends on how lethal you want combat to be.  I use the three highest dice.
 If a round has sufficient velocity and armor penetration capability lesser
armor isn\'t going to slow the shot down sufficiently to prevent it from
doing massive damage.  I count the lower dice rolls as the loss in velocity
as it penetrates the armor.  If you use the three lowest rolls for damage
and the 3D max. rule what would be the difference between a big game
hunting rifle and a PGMP?  You could just as easily do three one point hits
with both weapons.  Using the three highest rolls gives you a better chance
to do more damage with three sixes if you roll more dice.  I prefer my
players to think of violence as the last resort, but that\'s just my
delusional thiking  of course.

A thought that occurred to me recently is, are there Imperial equivalents to 
Terran culture?

- - America/Hollywood: completely dominates culturally, everyone\'s heard of 
Coca-Cola, Elvis, Micky Mouse, etc. (Does every city have a branch of Burger 
Emperor/Sylean Fried Avian/etc?)

- - Britain: everyone knows their films & TV are the best, but nobody watches 
them! (Do Solomani actors always play villains?)

- - France: government desperately trying to keep their language/culture pure 
(though the people would rather watch Star Trek (in English)). (Does Vland ban 
people speaking Galanglic?)

- - \'Bollywood\': *huge* market, 100s of films every year, but almost unknown 
outside India.

      Maybe right now but that can change. See the recent events with the L.

They have been having some trouble in Bavaria I hear.
    So lets cut the garbage. No nation is purely for "Unity, Right and
Freedom", and everyone of them has done some killing. It\'s a governmental
tradition among Humanity to locate outsiders, non-conformists and those of

     Only in the last century that has changed somewhat. Otherwise none of us
would be here to talk about it because according to some folk RPGs are the

Egad! It appears that I may have come across as "having a cow" and 
jumping on folks. :-)

Dedly, I apologize if my tone offended you. I have the deepest respect 
for Eris the Heretic and all other heretics. My message was not meant to 
marginalize those who play alternate sci-fi universes using Traveller 
rules. It was only meant to point out what I feel is a very basic

Been there.  I ran a version of the RHPS for Call of Cthulthu a few years
back.  Since everybody in the game was also on our local cast, we all knew
our cues.

Still one of the best nights of gaming I\'ve ever had.

One other interesting note:  according to the education my kids received
when we lived in Toronto, the *British* won the war of 1812.  This is, as
you might imagine, in some contrast to the education I received growing up
in Virginia.

I found it interesting too that when I was learning about early US history,
none of us ever questioned what happened to all the loyalists -- Tories --
after the Colonies decided to become independent.  Moving a bit north to
*Tor*onto, clarified things for me.  It\'s very interesting after all this
time, seeing the cultures that have evolved in ostensibly similar places
like Virginia, Ontario, Oregon, and California -- very similar, and yet
with *very* telling differences that seem attributable to who settled there
when, why they dominated, and what their attitudes were. 

Okay, there\'s gotta be a Traveller tie-in here someplace.  Maybe a fiercely
independent world made up of the descendants of those who settled it while
fleeing from "civilization" and an earlier war (like Oregon)?  Hmmm.  Could
add some depth to a campaign.

Along those lines, did anyone see the suggestion I posted for reconciling
skills and attributes?  I haven\'t play-tested it, and it _is_ a good-sized
numerical change, but I think having skill numbers range from 1-15 rather
than 1-6 is a good idea that solves the bulk of the task resolution
problems.  And I think withe the small table I posted, the conversion (both
mental and numerical) is pretty easy, adds some good granularity to
skill-learning, and can be done quickly.

Did anyone see this, or was it just so bad everyone politely ignored it?

Description			Volume	Mass	MCr	MW
Internal Hangar (Minimal)	x2	.2	.0002	-
Internal Hangar (Spacious)	x4	.2	.0002	-
Docking Ring			x1	0	.0002	-
Launch Tube			x25	.5	.00015	.01
External Grapple (USL)		x.1	1	.001
External Grapple (SL)		x.3	1	.002
External Grapple (AF)		x.5	1	.003

Volume:  Multiply the craft or vehicle volume by the value shown to 
determine the facility volume.
Mass:  The mass in tonnes per cubic meter ofinstallation.
MCr:  The price, in MCr, per cubic meter of installation
Surface Area:  All of the facilities require surface area except for the 
hangars (which require launch ports, below).  The launch tube reqruies 
area in m^2 equal to 2*L^2 where L equals the basic length as taken from 
the Hull Size table, unmodified by hull form, of the largest craft that 
will use the tube.
	Grapples require area equal to the square of the final length of 
the craft carried by the grapple.

MW:  Power requirement per cubic meter of installation.

Hangar Space:  Spacious hangars allow all repair and maintenance tasks to 
be conducted at normal difficulty levels.  Minimal hangars increase the 
difficulty level of all such tasks by one level.  Docking rings allow no 
maintenance or repair.

External Grapply:  Types listed are for unstreamlined (USL), streamlined 
(SL), and airframe (AF) hulls of the carrying ship, not the carried 
craft.  Note that the volume of craft carried in exteranl grapples is not 
subtracted from the volume of the carrying ship, although the volume of 
the grapple is.  Remember that the volume of the carrying ship plus all 
externally carried craft is used when calculating the required amount of 
maneuver drive and jump drive.
	By selecting the type of grapple that corresponds to its hull 
streamlining, the vessel may carry exteranlly mounted craft without 
compromising its streamlining configuration, so long as the exteranlly 
mounted craft also meets that configuration.  If the grapple or craft\'s 
configuration is lower that that of the overall hull, the ship is limited 
to the lower configuration if it is carrying the craft.  If the craft is 
detached, the hull\'s configuration may be used.


Access Ports
Description		Area	MCr
Launch Port		L^2	.001
Large Cargo Hatch	20m^2	.02
Small Cargo Hatch	12m^2	.012

Area:  Hull surface area required.

L^2:	The square of the craft\'s basic length as taken from the Hull 
Size table, unmodified by hull form.

MCr:  Price in MCr per square meter of launch port, or per each cargo hatch

Launch Port:  At least one launch port is required if craft or vehicles 
are carried.  More launch ports allow craft ot be launched more rapidly.

Cargo Hatches:  All craft requrie at least one large cargo hatch per 350 
m^3 (25 tons) of cargo capacity.  Vessels with under 100m^3 of cargo 
space can get by with a single small cargo hatch.

    'body' => 'Dominic Reynolds recently discovered another bug in the T4 combat 
system.  We\'ve been hacking this out in private e-mail, and I\'ve come 
up with a simple fix that I want to throw to the TML for comment.

If anybody can find the problem in a rule, or a fix to that rule, it 
is  you guys.  So, here goes.



What Dominic said:

He said, basically, that the blunt trauma rule is broken, and after 
hearing his explanation, I agree.

How?  Take this example.

Jack\'s not wearing any armor.  He gets hit by a big game rilfe, which 
does 6D damage.  Due to the maximum damage rule, he only takes 3 D6 
damage.

For comparison, let\'s say that Jack is wearing Diplo armor (flexible 
AV3).  He gets hit by the big game rifle.  He takes 3 D6 +3 damage.

Why the +3 damage?  It is because of the blunt trauma rule that says 
a character takes 1 point of damage for every damage die negated by 
flexible armor.

As Dominic has said, therein lies the problem.  Under T4 as written, 
a character with no armor takes (or could take--depending on how the 
dice are rolled) less damage than a character with armor.



My thoughts and fix:

I think that the simplest way to fix this is to have a stricter 
interpretation of the max damage rule with regard to blunt trauma 
damage.

The max damage rule states that a character cannot take more than 3 
D6 of damage (certain things break this rule--explosions, automatic 
fire, shotguns).  This should include blunt trauma damage.

So, if damage to a character is less than 3 D6, you add in the blunt 
trauma.  If damage is 3 D6, you do not add in the blunt trauma.

Ken\'s fix for blunt trauma:
	
	The max damage rule cannot be broken by blunt trauma.



Checking our above examples with my fix, Jack would take 3 D6 damage 
after being hit by a big game rifle in both cases--wearing Diplo and 
not wearing armor.

Now, if Jack was wearing the Diplo and he was hit by an ACR, 
he\'d take 1 D6 +3 damage.  The +3 is due to blunt trauma.

If Jack was hit by the ACR without armor, he\'d take 3 D6 
damage.



Comments on this fix?

A bit more useless history.  Although the National Anthem was written
during the War of 1812, it did not achieve that distinction officially
until 1931.  The real kickstart to the drive to make it the National
Anthem was baseball...

The Star Spangled Banner was sung at a sporting event for the first
time in the 1918 World Series in Boston (a wartime series, it might be
noted), when it was played during the 7th inning stretch (not before
the game).  The crowd responded so positively that the ritual was
performed at every other game of the series, and eventually spread to
other ballparks.  Eventually, public enthusiasm led to an act of
Congress making it the National Anthem during the Hoover
administration.

Mike, I didn\'t see it.  I\'ve been having ISP troubles and have missed a few

Know what?  I agree with you about the "very basic assumptions" in the
Traveller Universe..if you stray too far from them the feel of the game can
easily become much less Travellerisk.  For that reason, I usually stay very
close to the basic assumptions, and when I do stray I take the changes
*very* seriously.  

OTHO,I\'m much less attached to the political and social history that has
built up over the last 20 years.  That\'s where *I\'m* a real heretic.  Well,
that and a number of techological/pseudo-science things.  Then there\'s my
different CharGen process, and task system, and my changes to the combat
systems, and....<G> Maybe I really am..

Ah, that explains why the US, Canada, and Britian remained rather friendly
even after the war..everybody thought their side won.  <g>

And everybody was right, the US remained independent, trade resumed between
the US and Europe, the British cut back on support for the Indian Nations
in our south and midwest, and Canada stayed a British Colony..just what
everybody wanted.  Everybody except the Indian Nations, that is.

Caveat:  I\'m not using T4\'s combat rules in my games because I want a more
detailed and deadly system.  However, here you go..

1.  Roll all the D6 for the weapon.  They will be applied from highest to
lowest, so arrange them in that order.

2.  Remove dice equal to the armor rating starting with the highest number. 
If flexible armor replace each removed die with a 1, if rigid armor
completely remove the dice.

3a.  On first hit apply all damage from top 3 dice to one Physical
Attribute at random (or player choice).

3b.  On second and subsequent hits apply each of the top 3 dice die (or hit
group) of damage to different Physical Attributes at random (or player
choice) starting with the highest remaining hit group and continuing until
all hits are applied.  This may require some Attributes taking more than 1
die of damage.


Example:  Big Game Rifle (6d6) against Diplo armor (3flex).

  1.   6d6 -> 3,3,6,2,5,1  arranged -->  6,5,3,3,2,1
  2.   replace 6,5,3  giving 3,2,1,1,1,1
  3a.  apply to one Physical Attribute --> 3+2+1=6
      or
  3b. apply each die to a Physical Attribute -->   3,2,1
  

Example:  Big Game Rifle (6d6) against Rigid armor (3rigid).

  1.  6d6 -> 6,5,3,3,2,1
  2. remove 6,5,3 giving 3,2,1
  3. apply 6 to one Attribute on first hit and 3, 2, 1 to different
     Attributes on subsequent hits.
     
Example:  Big Game Rifle (6d6) vs no armor

  1. 6d6 ->  6,5,3,3,2,1
  
  2. remove no dice giving 6,5,3,3,2,1
  
  3. apply 14 to one Attribute on first hit and 6,5,4 to different
     Attributes on subsequent hits.
     
Example:  Revolver (2d6) vs flex1

  1. 2d6 -> 5,4
  
  2. replace  5 giving 4,1
  
  3. apply 5 or 4,1
  
Example:  Revolver (2d6) vs rigid1

 1.  2d6 -> 5,4
  
 2.  remove 5
 
 3.  apply 4 to an Attribute
 
Example Revolver (2d6) vs no armor

 1.  2d6 -> 5,4
 2.  remove none
 3.  apply 9 or 5,4
 
 
Play around with that. <g>

Ken, two things..first, 15 might be the maximum, but it\'s too damn easy to
get that high, second I think it would be easier to solve the problems if
Attributes ranged from 1 to 8.  Foex, roll 2d3 rather than 2d6, and limit
increases to a max of 8.  (And you *know* I don\'t really like d3\'s. <g>)

Now that I\'ve gotten that off my chest, yeah 1 to 15 is pretty much
Traveller.

> My assumption is that the average human attribute, that is "average 
> human ability in the stat category", is 7 just like in CT.

Yeah, if you do the 2d6 thing, then 7 is the mean, but with the way
CharGen is now that 7 is likely to grow to an 8 or 9..and if it\'s
EDU then it can easily average 11 or 12.  THIS is what is what\'s
unbalancing things.

> OK, assumption two, and this will be a little more sticky.

That\'s close to my view, but I tend to push Professional a level
higher.  Here\'s how I see it:

Level 1     Novice              
Level 2     Advanced Student   
Level 3     Journeyman         
Level 4     Professional
Level 5     Expert
Level 6     Master
Level 7     Grand Master
Level 8     Yoda

However, I personally think that if Attributes average 7 then Skills should
average 6 to 8 after any tinkering we do.  This is for  competent PC\'s, not
beginners or experts.  With that in mind here\'s how the levels
(assuming each level is worth 1 point in the target number).

Level 1     Novice              
Level 2     Student   
Level 3     Advanced Student
Level 4     Journeyman         
Level 5     Advanced Journeyman
Level 6     Professional
Level 7     Expert
Level 8     Master
Level 9     Grand Master
Level 10+   Yoda

I might go with 3 levels, rather than 2, for character averages, and
this *isn\'t* assuming 1 point/level.

If we use whole d6\'s in the task levels then here\'s what works from
my testing:
                  Target Number succeeding about
Die   Name       90%     75%     50%     25%     10%
====================================================
1d6   Automatic   6       5       3       2       1
2d6   Easy       10       9       7       5       4
3d6   Routine    14      12      10       8       6
4d6   Hard       18      16      14      11       9
5d6   Formidable 22      20      17      14      12 
6d6   Staggering 26      23      21      18      15

I think a player who is average in Attributes, but Professional in
capability would have a Target Number in the 14 to 18 range.

If the Attribute contributes an average of 8 for the average player
(after being raised during CharGen) then you need 6 to 10 points
from Skill.  If we\'re talking about 3 Levels to be a Professional,
then it\'s 3 pts/level.  If we\'re talking Professional at 4 Levels
then it\'s 2pts/level.

If you go with 2pt/level then you get the Professional range (14-18) at
a/an: 
 Attribute  2  Skill Level 6-8
 Attribute  5  Skill Level 5-7
 Attribute  8  Skill Level 3-5
 Attribute 10  Skill Level 2-4
 Attribute 12  Skill Level 1-3
 Attribute 15  Skill Level 0-2
 
Does this help you any?

I have been an avid Traveller fan for the past 20 years, and I have
watched as the game transformed into its many different creations.=20
Through all the years I stood silently, rejoicing with each success, and
being struck by some of the stupid mistakes that were made.  I have
followed the many arguments for different systems, rules or designs and
have enjoyed them all (doesn=92t really matter what you use to me, as long
as you have fun.  I have always used my own bastard system. That is what
makes Traveller great =96 FLEXABILITY, IMHO).  However I can no longer
stand by silently, as I have reached the end of my rope (or I have
become an angry old man, no matter as I will now stand on my soap box).=20

For twenty years the Game has evolved, and in many ways improved.  CT
was good, MT if tweaked, great!, NE (skip that one), and now we get to
T4, could be the best of the best. Unfortunately, the most consistent
thing about each generation is how the amount of MISTAKES increase with
each.  Missing tables, charts, information, rules that do not work, data
that should be meshed seamlessly with other books all have gotten worse
with each new generation. With each new book I have gotten more
concerned. MO and FS being the final straw.

I bring this up not to complain, but to ask that more time, or people,
be used to proof the material prior to release.  If the quality
continues to be this shoddy, everyone losses.  Let me explain; While in
my local gaming store I overheard two young men discussion T4.  The gist
of the conversation can be summarized in two thoughts =96 Good idea, lousy
execution.  When I asked what they meant, they said that they had heard
that the rules had so many mistakes, etc., that they figured they were
better off not buying it. =20

Marc, I ask that you get some type of quality control program in place.
As I tell my clients, "Do it right the first time!"  This saves time and
money down stream.  Use the Intranet/Internet to distribute copies of
the text prior to producing the film. Do anything, just get control of
it. =20

I thank you for your time, and will now step down. =20

I like the "max damage is never exceeded by blunt trauma damage" rule, but
I think the problem lies with the blunt trauma damage being excessive.  I
think what I might do is either disregard blunt trauma altogether, or say
something like "subtract 1 die, plus 1 die for each AV" or maybe (simpler)
"add 1 pt of blunt trauma for each 2d of damage absorbed."  So the case
below with the big game rifle would be 3d without armor, or 2d+3 with flex
armor, or 3d+1 using the second suggestion.  These aren\'t a lot different,
of course, so you might want to lose the armor if you\'re going up against
crazed African hunters or something.

    'topic' => 'First Survey: should\'ve been...',
    'body' => '     I hate to seem like I\'m dwelling on this, I\'d just as soon move on, but in
looking at the Vland sector data in "Vilani & Vargr" this morning (it\'s one of
the only pre-T4 products I have at school), I realized what "First Survey"
should have been like to make it a worthwhile product (instead of the painfully
expesnive rip-off that it is now).
     First, the DGP write-up for Vland c. 1120 contains all of the same info as
FS: location, name, UWP, trade class, Bases, PBG, stellar; but in a smaller
type-face so that they can fit two columns per page.  The total sector data
comes out to 3pp! (for comparison sake, the data for the same sector in FS is
8pp).  Now, since Vland seems to have about average number of systems, I figure
3pp is a pretty good average, plus 1 for the map, plus 2 (guessing) for Player
Data (which would also be shrunk accordingly).  For all 9 sectors presented,
this gives 54pp.  If we decide to make FS into a 64pp book, we\'ve got 10 extra
pages.  Okay, we have the intro and "situation" from the current book take up
2pp, and here\'s my suggestion for how to fill the rest: 1-2pp explanation of
terms (what the UWP values stand for, what PBG means, I remember something
similar on DGP\'s referee screen), 1p Map of the Imperium highlighting the
included sectors (this would replace the schematic diagram in the current
book), 1-2pp listing the info from the Comments section of the current listings
(locations of old Depots, AAB repositories, Minor Race homeworlds, etc), 2-3pp
telling procedures for a standard "survey" (could be as simple as in "The
Imperial Fringe," preferably more akin to he intro section of DGP\'s "World
Builder\'s handbook"), and, if there\'s room, the standard IG ads.  (Also, added
to the present intro would be specific mention that this book is a companion to
"Milieu 0" and is not intended to be used on its own, and added to the Player
data on the various sectors (which would greatly expand the number of Known
worlds, especially around the Core) would be a short paragraph or so for each
sector giving a little background-- how much of the sector\'s been explored,
known Pocket Empires, known alien races, any sites of historical significance,
etc., as much as will fit).
     With that amount and arrangement of info, I think that this would be a
pretty decent supplement.  At 64pp, it would then be saddle-bound/stapled
(which not only would probably help keep the price down, but would also
facilitate photocopying-- I don\'t think it\'s any secret that most GMs would
rather give their players a photocopy to mark up than pages from their actual
book).  Price for this book would be NO MORE THAN $12.95.  I still think that
would be a little steep, but I expect that gaming books are going to cost more
than I think they should (Note that "Vilani & Vargr" cost $12.95 and while
admittedly that was several years ago, it\'s also a 104pp book).  Lastly, and 
this is important, it would not be labeled as "Book 6," because it is not of 
the same "level" as the other supplements.  If you notice the IG product 
numbers this, is already reflected (T4 is #1000, St is #1100, CSC is #1200, 
AA is #1300, M0 is #1400, FS is #1401) and I think that\'s how it belongs.  
     If FS had looked something like this, I would have been completely 
satisfied-- I\'d probably still think that it was one of the least useful and
interesting of T4 books, but I certainly wouldn\'t feel cheated the way I do 
with the current product.
     There, now that I\'ve said all that and got it off my chest I can put this
behind me and go on with my life (albeit with less money than I had before).  I
sincerely hope that the new layout people have some of the same ideas and will
keep this in mind when designing the Aslan-space Survey later this year.  If
not, it\'s not going to be too long before IG starts losing valuable customers
(ie- me) who simply can\'t afford to shell out big bucks for shoddy products.

Here is what I posted.  I posted this originally during the heat of the
task system posts (not that I want to stir _that_ up again), so it may have

This is an excellent point, and indicates that maybe the correct place for
the fix is in character generation: put the skills on the same scale as
attributes.  This would balance the importance of skills and attributes in
game play, make in-game calculations significantly easier, and probably do
away with the need to record intermediate numbers on scratch sheets.

This could also make for better granularity in chargen.  If you wanted to
you could make a table showing how many points you increase each time you
get a skill during character generation, as:

Number of times skill encountered:  1   2   3   4   5   6
Additional points gained in skill:  1   2   4   3   3   2

This is just off the top of my head, but I like this table.  It shows a
nice quasi-bell-shaped progression in proficiency (skewed toward the side
of skill acquisition, which is arguably realistic), and both the average
and maximum proficiencies don\'t change: a character with a skill-3 would
now have skill-7, while a character in T4 with skill-6 would have skill-15,
corresponding to someone having attribute-15.

Thoughts?

   ...were no longer colonial rebels, effective September 3, 1783

   Well you could list your references: Dresden being one.  We could
also go into the whole litnany of British crimes and acts of war against
any number of peoples over a period of nearly a thousand years, most of
which while less dramatic were certainly just as destructive if not more
so in relative terms.  People who live in glass houses should not throw

I like the idea that armor does the most it can for you -- you\'re removing
the "most lethal" die rolls.  The last part of this part is, of course,
exactly the same as the existing system: you ignore 3 dice, but add +3 to
the overall damage.

should be called the "D66 Task System". The original misnomer was meant to
stress the fact that it only uses two dice, but this obscured the system\'s
uniqueness.

Of course, part of its uniqueness lies in its wonky calculations, performed
in a strange variant of base-6. Well, enough of that. Why not just convert
the whole thing to a table and have done with it?

So here\'s The New Improved D66 System, with TN Table.

NEW changes:
  * Stat to Skill ratio has been upped to 3:1, which has necessitated lower
BTNs. TNs for Skill Levels 1 and 2 are, as a result, rather lower than
before; Impossible tasks are now well beyond the reach of most PCs at these
levels.
  * Just to be extra annoying, TNs for 0-Level Default skills are back to
- -1 level of difficulty, not -2.
  * This system assumes an upper limit to Skill Levels of about 10 (though
the TN Table shows only 0 to 8). If your game involves PCs with higher
Skill Levels, I suggest using a Stat to Skill ratio of 2:1 instead.
  * Note that there is no built-in upper limit on attributes in this
system, which can easily accomodate Characters with attributes above 16,
such as robots, aliens, variant human species, or prosthetically augmented
humans. The absolute upper limit is probably 24. (A character with stat 20
and skill 1 has a Difficult TN of 65 (98%), Impossible 35 (47.6%).
  * Note also that it is very easy to add further levels of Difficulty -
"Beyond Impossible", "Insane", "Suicidal", etc - simply by subtracting from
the first digit of the TN. This is particularly useful when dealing with
super-powered PCs. And it doesn\'t require thowing bucketfulls of dice.

The table is in two sections, which can be cut-n-pasted to make a single table.

             The D66 Task System
                    v2.0
          A simple task roll system
   compatible with Marc Miller\'s Traveller (T4)

The task roll is always two dice; one for a \'tens\' digit and one for a
\'ones\' digit, for a result between 11 and 66. As in T4, the task is
successful if the player rolls the Target Number (TN) or less.

Consult the Target Number Table, or use the formula (below) to calculate
Target Numbers without the Table.

"I S F D A E" means Impossible, Staggering, Formidable, Difficult, Average,
Easy.

Below the appropriate Skill/Difficulty Level, find the appropriate Stat
Code (in hexadecimal), which will provide the TN, at left. TNs for Stats
above F are not shown, but are easy to extrapolate. The "Stat Only" column
gives TNs for unmodified attribute tests. For 0-Level Skills, do not halve
the attribute. At right is a rough calculation of the statistical odds.

Alternatively, here\'s a table to showing the TNs for Stat 7. Numbers in
brackets are automatic tasks. SO = Stat Only, for straight tests of
attributes, without added skills.
For each stat point above 7, add 1 to these Target Numbers (in base-6).
For each stat point below 7, subtract 1 (in base-6).

    The Target Number Formula:

      Target Number = BTN + (skill*2) + (characteristic-7)

So, to determine the target number for a task:

1. Determine the Base Target Number (BTN):

   Difficulty Level       BTN
      Impossible          -16
      Staggering           06
      Formidable           16
      Difficult            26
      Average              36
      Easy                 46

2. Modify the BTN by the PC\'s skill and by the corresponding characteristic.

   2a: +3 for each skill level. 
   2b: +1 for each characteristic point above 7; -1 for each point below 7.
        
NOTE, however, that these modifiers are not added in base-10. The modifiers
are counted as steps up or down the 11-66 matrix:

- -11 -12 -13 -14 -15 -16  01  02  03  04  05  06
 11  12  13  14  15  16  21  22  23  24  25  26
 31  32  33  34  35  36  41  42  43  44  45  46
 51  52  53  54  55  56  61  62  63  64  64  66

Example: a character with Skill 3 and Stat 9 is attempting a Difficult
task. The BTN is 26. He adds 9 for the skill (3*3=9) + 2 for the
above-average stat (9-7=2), for a total modifier of +11. The result is not
37, as it would be in base-10. Instead, he counts 11 steps up the matrix;
so the actual target number is 45. *The calculation becomes much simpler if
you remember that six steps up or down the matrix equals one level of
Difficulty, altering the first digit by 1.*

To save time, Difficult-task TNs for all skills can be pre-calculated by
the players before play begins. Adjusting for other Difficulty Levels is a
simple matter of altering the first digit of the target number.

For tests of 0-level Default Skills, don\'t halve the characteristic (as in
T4). Instead, increase the Difficulty by one level (by simply subtracting 1
from the first digit of the base target number).

As always, a roll of two sixes is a Spectacular Failure, and two ones is a
Spectacular Success - even if the target number is below 11. Chance of
Spectacular Success or Failure is always 2.8%.

NOTE: The T4 Multiple Actions rule will not work in this system. A new rule
is needed: when attempting multiple actions, do not divide the
characteristic. Instead, increase the difficulty two levels for each extra
action (-2 to the first digit of the target number). Thus, for a character
with stat of 7 and skill of 6, the target number for a single Difficult
action is 56-; for two such actions, 36-; for three, 16-. (Obviously, this
rule does not allow characters to perform as many extra actions as the
original rule.)

   Still doesn\'t fly Keith.  Any planet orbiting around a M9d is going
to be so cold that it wouldn\'t have a type 4-9 atmosphere.  Having a
type 4-9 atmosphere is a prerequisite for a planet to be classified as
Agricultural according to Book 6, MT, and TNE.

   Your best bet for dealing with the stellar data in the new books (M:0
and First Survey) is to disregard it and start from scratch.  My
understanding is that the current plan is to present a better, more
realistic system for generating stars in "Pocket Empires"--I suggest you
use it to regenerate everything, unless IG issues some errata to cover
the stellar data in the meantime.

   An example of what stellar data *should* look like (or at least
something that is more realistic) can be found in Traveller Chronicle
#10, which contains the reformulated Solomani Rim star list.

  As QSDS is currently written, a small craft added using external
grapples does not require the ship designer to account for the added
tonnage.  See, for example, my design for the CT Broadsword using QSDS.  I
stuck a 50 ton modular cutter on the outside using external grapples, and
nowhere did the rules say I needed to up the size of the jump or manuever
drive to account for the additional tonnage.

  My suggestion for a fix is as follows:

1) During the Hull selection part of SSDS design, after selecting a
hull, decide the total tonnage of small craft to be carried in external
grapples (if any).

2) During the Jump Drive selection portion, add the tonnage of the hull
and the small craft together.  Select the tonnage catagory for jump drive
equal to or larger than the total to determine the Jump Drive Potential
required for the craft and the fuel tankage required.

3) Follow the same procedure when selecting the manuever drive system.


  Thus, to take the CT Broadsword design I posted previously, the total
volume of the ship hull (800 tons) is added to the tonnage of the cutter
in the external grapple (50 tons), for a total of 850 tons.  The next
largest QSDS size Jump Drive is for a 900 ton ship, so we use that line on
the Jump Drive Potential table.  Thus, the drive potential required for J3
with the external grapples would be 36 rather than 32, and the ship would
need 270 tons of fuel rather than 240.

  i think this is a simple and easy fix.  It causes problems for ships
larger than 1000 tons, since the tables for Jump Drive Potential go up in
1000 Ton increments after that, but that\'s tough - if you don\'t like it,
use SSDS.

  Note: It would be nice if docking rings were added to QSDS in a future
version, but that\'s of no moment here and now.

...and that\'s why they *can\'t* work under QSDS.  Much of the \'standard\'
equipment in QDSD is created by cross-indexing a hull size with a desired
performance level, directly or indirectly.  There are only a fixed number
of hull types available, though, of fixed sizes.

You can\'t model an 800 ton sphere with a 50 ton craft externally grappled
either of these ways:

1) Add the two, getting 850.  Suddenly, your drives (maneuver and jump)
   are underpowered by about 6%, because they\'re scaled to the 800 ton
   hull.

2) Subtract the 50 tons from the 800, pretending it\'s really a 750 ton
   hull.  Not only are you then paying too much (in power and money) for
   the QSDS hull, you\'re buying a nonstandard hull (750 ton sphere), and
   thus should lose the QSDS discount.

If we insist on supporting external grapples (and partly-external docking
rings) in QSDS, option 2 does less damage to the overall consistency.  The
cost differences for the slightly smaller hull is usually trivial, and we
can always handwave additional \'standard\' hulls into existence.

I\'m not so sure the rule is broken - it makes sense to me. The reason for
the 3D damage limit is that any further kinetic energy is lost. The rounds
go right through the injured PC; thus their body does not absorb the full
kinetic energy.

However, if someone wearing Flex is hit by a high powered rifle (6D
damage), the armor absorbs the kinetic energy that would otherwise have
been lost. The PC will take an extra three points, above and beyond the 3D
limit - because if they weren\'t wearing armor this energy would\'ve been
lost. Seems paradoxical, but it\'s entirely possible that wearing no armor
is, on rare occasions, preferable to wearing Flex!

A suggested "fix" (if it needs any fixing) might be:

*If the PC is not armored*, then they take the *highest* 3D of the full
number of dice. But, if they\'re flexible armor, the armor absorbs those
dice *before* damage is rolled.

This would ensure that wearing Flex does confer a real benefit compared to
not wearing armor at all - but if you\'re not lucky you might still take
more than 18 points.

Does this makes sense?

I don\'t know if that\'s what IG had in mind, but doing it this helps...and
if you want a more lethal system reverse things and have the armor reduce
from lowest die up.

Yep, pretty much.  The extra 1,1,1 (shouldn\'t call it 3, cause it\'s
supposed to be applied individually <g>), won\'t get applied with big guns
anyway.

To make this one fly, you have to resort to some creative
planetology.  <G> Hum, let\'s see...SHORTS is an Earth sized moon orbiting a
Brown Dwarf in orbit 0 of the M9d.  The dwarf and the star still don\'t
supply enough heat for the moon, but the interaction of tidal forces keeps
the moon\'s core hot..hot enough to maintain an atmosphere, a dense CO2 rich
atmosphere, through
volcanism...and the shear perversity of Gaia.  

The main occupation on Shorts is agriculture and agricultural
processing.  Most of this is widespread shallow ocean harvesting of what
we\'d mostly think of as foul smelling pond-scum.  The scum is harvested by
independent sweeper boats that skim the surface.  The independents work
well staked claims...careful to stay out of each others..uh, shorts, so to
speak.  They sell their loads of scum to processors on the few scattered
islands who dry and process it into the basic biomass we all eat on our
ships.  The big corps wouldn\'t be caught in Shorts...they are too
conservative for that.

Lately something stinky has been going on in Shorts...and we don\'t mean the
scum!  Our heros have been hired by a cooperative of Scum Sweepers to
investigate the disappearance of several sweepers in the "Culotte Square"
area.

We fully intend to dump our heros into the stinking muck on a leaky dingy,
and see if they can survive the "snappers", the erupting volcano and it\'s
tidal wave, the scum poachers...and the sabotage team from Palluka Oil
that\'s trying to run the scum sweepers out of their Culotte claims so they
can steal...well steal their Shorts!

Now seriously!  <g> We can twiddle up a few systems like this, but official
Traveller publication have always had *way* too many
anomalous systems.

I can see your point here, and eventhough I might agree with you on 
specific situations, this is not a good point to base a general rule 
on.

Common sense says that armor should protect you, and if you are hit 
by a gunshot, you should not take more damage from the round while 
wearing armor than you would not wearing armor.

Let me give you a dichotomous answer.

Yes, it makes sense, but it is much more complicated that the fix I 
proposed.  When I tweak a rule, I try to stay as close as possible to 
the original rules.  Your rule strays a little farther from the 
original than mine does.

In my fix, we are just defining the 3 D max rule a little stricter, 
and we are only rolling a few dice (maximum of 3) to calculate 
damage.  That\'s how T4 was intended to be.

I can see some GMs, who want more or less lethal combat, using your 
method of rolling each of the dice a weapon has designated for damage 
then picking and choosing which of the dice are not considered 
damage.

I\'d rather just do the simple thing of saying, "I\'ve just hit you 
with a 4 D6 weapon, and you\'ve got on AV3 flexible armor", and then 
roll 1 D6 +3 damage.

It is much more simple than rolling all 4 D6 and deciding 
which of the die are eliminated from the damage pool by the 
armor.

Now, to comment on the merits of your idea.  In a word, I think 
that it is great.  It is not the system that I would use, but it is 
definitely good thinking and allows GMs to tailor their combat 
styles.  For GMs who don\'t mind an extra step in the combat round, 
I\'d recommend it (since I am already using your hit location chart in 
combat, I don\'t need another step to contend with).

If I were writing the new edition of T4, I\'d throw in my simpler 
idea as the basic rule, but I\'d add your idea as an optional, more 
advanced rule, and I\'d let respective GMs pick how much detail (and 
extra steps) they wanted.

Good thoughts, Glenn.

Good idea for a GM who wants less lethal combat, but I like the blunt 
trauma rule.  I didn\'t expect to see it (it was in TNE) when I opened 
T4, and I was pleased with the simplicity in which it was handled.

One of the things I like about the rule is that it makes for good 
comparisons between rigid and flexible armors.  The rigid armors tend 
to have better AVs but more stat negatives whereas the flexible 
armors are just the opposite.  Whether or not your character will 
take blunt trauma damage gives him something more to think about when 
weighing the pros and cons of different armor types.

I personnally don\'t think that 1 point for every die is too much for 
blunt trauma, but I can also see a GM going to your "1 pt of blunt 
trauma damage for every two dice the armor absorbs"  system if he 
wanted to lessen the effects of blunt trauma.

Both you and Glenn Grant have had good ideas on this.  Let me revise 
something that I said in response to Glenn.

If I were writing the revised edition of T4, I\'d have my rule as the 
basic rule, but I\'d throw in yours and Glenn\'s ideas as two optional 
advanced rules to this system for GMs who like to customize their 
combat styles.

Good work, Mike.

Kenneth.

Good ideas, Mike, but definitely not for me.  

The reason?  I like to stay as close to printed T4 as possible.  If 
something is broken, then I\'ll tweak it a bit to fix it, but simple 
is the name of the game.  Complicated or sweeping rules changes don\'t 
interest me.

The task system needs to be fixed, no doubt, but, respectfully, I 
don\'t think re-working the skill levels like that is the 
answer--especially since it\'s been that way since the game as 
started.

There has to be a simpler answer.

Thanks for the post, though.

The song is "To Anacreon in Heaven". I have the words if anybody cares.
And the fact that the words weren\'t written for the tune has *no*
bearing on the difficulty of signing the song. It\'s the fact that the
tune covers a couple of octaves (or at least an octave and a half, I\'d
have to check) that makes it unsingable by the non-pro. Even
professionals don\'t always have the required range!

Since the original was a drinking song, nobody *cared* how you sounded!

The *original* release of Triplanetary wasn\'t a "board game". It had a

overlay so you could plot vectors with grease pencil (came in a *big*
mailing tube!). I never got to *play* it, but I saw a friend\'s copy. I
was rather disappointed to find out that he\'d sold it to someone else
when I tried to buy it from him a few years later.

Oh well, I finally got a copy when it was re-released in the late seventies.

is a body of knowledge and physical motions that have been practiced for enough
time so as to subsume the actual thinking of what needs to be done into a near
reflexive response.  This is, for example, why the Martial Arts work.  You\'ve
practiced for so long that you automatically do what needs to be done, as a
reflex.  Typing is the same way.  So is Surgery or Piloting for that matter!
Don\'t believe me, check out the overall Stats of Surgeons with decades of

and experience of the Pilot which made the difference.

A couple of corrections. Key had gone out to the British ships to
negotiate the release of some prisoners. He was held overnight so he
couldn\'t give warning of the attack. He was released the next day.

And the bit about "rocket\'s red glare" is not poetic license. This was
during the height of the "Congreve rocket" as a bombardment weapon. Not
long before the British had reduced a couple of seaport in Europe to
ruins with the same sort of rockets.

The rockets weren\'t as accurate as a cannon, but not that much worse.
And being "recoilless" they could be fired from something a *lot*
easier to transport. The launcher used on land looked much like a 2-3
meter chunk of rain gutter mounted on a tripod. You angled it
appropriately, laid a rocket in the trough and lit it off. The launcher
could be carried on a horse, along with a number of rockets. Add a
couple more horses with rockets and you had artillery that could move
almost as fast as cavalry.

At sea, due to the fire hazard, they launched the rockets from
longboats. They essentially hung a ladder from the mast, and laid the
rocket on that. You adjusted the vertical angle with fairly standard
rigging, and you adjusted horizontally by pointing the boat. The
illustrations I\'ve seen show the ladder sticking out over one side
rather than running lengthwise.

The rockets were a metal tube, several feet long, with a bursting
warhead.

    Well you could list your references: Dresden being one.  We could

 Keshi gained its importance because it maintained Jump Drive tech during 
 the long night, and conquered the worlds within 5 parsecs of it. It\'s 
 year 0 UWP could be due to the fact that the Rulers of Keshi transferred 
 their power base to other worlds of the Kingdom. Keshi could be a sort of 
 Buckingham Palace, or Forbidden \'City\' for the Chanestin Royals. In this 
 case the pop modifier represents the Royal population, with the tech 
 modifier inconsequential as most of the tech is imported from the 
 powerhouse Chanestin worlds.
  >>

     This looks to me like the Chanestin got pasted. Cleon and the troops
probably faced some determined resistance so they flattened everything.
 Note- No Government and No Law with only a few people left. Those that were
able probably left the devestated Keshi. The low tech level would also be
accounted for by large scale destruction. Bombed them back to the seventies;
oh no not pastel green disco shirts, this could be *worse* then the stone
age. :)

I have been looking over this thread and have been thinking.
Blunt trama should be applied only when the round DOES NOT penetrate. 
Think about it.  Your wearing a diplo vest(av=3) and you get hit by a
revolver slug(dv=2).  the round does not penetrate, but you still feel
the "whomp" of the slug.  2 points blunt trama.  You take a 6d rifle
shot, the round is going to penetrate, but the velocity is slowed down
reducing from 6dice to 3dice, but as the shot rips trough your vest and
into you, there will be no "whomp", no blunt at all, so ignore it.

Take it from someone with personal experience in wounds, blunt trama
makes bruises, but penetration friggin hurts! :)

	Docking rings DO NOT  leave part of the carried craft outside the

allocate additional drive capacity for externally protruding carried 
craft.  While grapples may be unworkable in QSDS, docking rings are very 
simple and are no more work than a hangar.
	For those who missed the stats the first time:

		Volume	Mass	Area	MCr	MW
Docking Ring	x1	0	-	.0002	-
Launch Port			L^2	.001

The numbers for the docking ring are per cubic meter of docking ring, 
while the numbers for the launch port are per square meter.  Surface area 
requirements of the launch port are the basic length of the carried craft 
squared.
	Basic length means the length of the hull before it is modified 
by configuration.  In other words, the length of a spherical hull of the 
same displacement.  This is the only thing that may create a problem for 
QSDS users, since I don\'t think the spherical hull length will always 
be available.  Your best bet is to just look this info up on SSDS.
	Yes, every docking ring and every hangar needs a launch port.

I created something similar along these lines shortly after TNE came
out, but before T4.  Much of it was based on CT (I own very little MT
stuff, except for a sourcebook or two), specifically Snap Shot.  It
incorporated hit location rules and weapon classifications from TNE,
as well as armour from CT.  It also had nice little tables with data
that you would transfer to your character sheet before gameplay to
keep things simple.

Ahem... each weapon delivered damage using a number of six-sided dice.
Depending on the weapon, different armour types reduced damage by
different amounts (each weapon was cross-referenced with each armour
type to recreate every possible weapon/armour combination).  Depending
on the weapon, each armour type would have a value between "1+" and
"6", as well as "-" (representing no effect).  Weapon damage ranged
from 1d6 (various low calibre toxin delivery rounds and individual
buckshot hits) to 30d6 (5.1cm fusion rifle or FGMP-15).

If a 9mm Magnum Revolver (damage of 4d6) were to strike someone
wearing, say, Combat Armour (with an Armour Resistance of "4+"), each
damage die rolled that generated a result equal to or greater than
"4+" would be totally ignored (eg: a roll of 1,2,4,5 would inflict
only 1+2=3D3 points of damage).

If the same weapon were used against someone wearing either Ballistic
Cloth or Ballistic Weave, each damage die rolled that generated a
result equal to or greater than "5+" would be totally ignored (eg: a
roll of 1,2,4,5 would inflict only 1+2+4=3D7 points of damage.

=46inally, if the magnum were used against someone wearing Flak
(remember, this was based on CT), each damage die rolled that produced
a "6" would be totally ignored (eg: the same roll of 1,2,4,5 would
inflict full damage).

My system was originally based on the idea the armour would subtract a
number between 0 and 6 from each six-sided damage die rolled in the
attack.  This was superior to the current system but proved to involve
too much math during playtesting.

Hello, Stephen.

I agree with your post.  One things that I do to curb the CharGen 
system--and its also the system that I\'ve always used for 
Traveller--is to be very strict in the process.

I don\'t let the players roll six times and arrange for initial stats, 
and I don\'t allow them various rolls like roll three times and keep 
one as you stat.

What I do is brutal, but it helps to put some balance in the game.  I 
give each player only one shot at rolling each of his character\'s 
stats.  That\'s it, just one try at Str, one try at Dex, etc.

If they want to increase what they\'ve rolled during CharGen, then 
they need to pick a table (I allow them to pick a table to roll on 
like in the old CT) to roll on at the expense of rolling on a table 
that would give them a skill increase.  You usually have a physical 
table in CharGen where you can increase certain stats.

This all seems to mesh together and produce more balanced characters. 
 GMs that complain that their player\'s characters having skills that 
are too high have no right to complain if they allow players to pick 
a table and pick from that table.  They gave the players that much 
freedom in CharGen, and they should live with the consequences.

I think the "whomp" is on your chest when you are hit.

If you do it this way, you get in a situation where having armor will 
increase your chance of being damaged.  That\'s what we were trying to 
fix with the blunt trauma rule.

If you are hit with a 4D6 gun while wearing AV3 flexible armor, under 
your system, you\'d take 1 D6 of damage.

But then again, lets say, wearing the same armor, you are hit with a 
3 D6 round.  Under your system, the character would take a solid 3 
points of damage.  

In many cases, that 3 points will be more damage than what you would 
have taken if the round had penetrated.

> Take it from someone with personal experience in wounds, blunt trama
> makes bruises, but penetration friggin hurts! :)

Which your explanation doesn\'t support, given my example above.

If you don\'t really like my basic blunt trauma fix, try Glenn Grant\'s 
or Mike Sellers\' more advanced fixes.  Both of those are good ideas.

Thanks, Commander X,

Kenneth.

Not to let you Brits off the hook or anything, but I don\'t think you can be
blamed for the *invention* of the concentration camp.  You refined it\'s use
during the Boer War, but concentrating your
opponents dependents had been going on forever.

During nineteenth century the Spanish held women and children
hostage in Cuba and the Philippines to "discourage" their men-folk from
engaging in guerrilla activities.  The US had been doing the same thing to
the Seminoles in Florida, and frankly that\'s what "indian reservations"
really were.  Centuries earlier the Romans did the same sort of thing, too. 


Armies have been using threats to civilians against their opponents for as
long as there have been armies.  Sometimes they are honest, and call them
hostages, but most of the time they say they are doing it "to protect
them."

I\'d say there\'s enough "nastiness" to go around.

Personaly, I\'d shy away from calling any PC a doctor unless he had, in
addition to Med-3, skills in Biology, Chemistry, and Research.  From my own
experiences, these skill are what seperates doctors from other medical
professionals, such as nurses and EMTs.

Okay, okay.  Sheesh.

How about relativistic travel in-system?  For example, if I wanted to have
Our Heros travel from, say, Earth to Pluto without using some sort of
microjumps, how fast (their perceived time) could they get there without
noticeable relativistic effects?  I have the Lorenz transformation around
here somewhere, but haven\'t dug it out.

Anyone ever done this in the context of Traveller?


BTW, just to be off-topic, you _know_ the reason Apollo cried in so many
BS:G episodes is because whats-her-name played by Jane Seymour had gotten
vaporized. :)

Ah, that sounds fine. Do you think it is a good idea to buy T4? I read all  
those discussions here, but I think it\'s too much comparing to MT and TNE in  
it to understand it (now).
By the way: I haven\'t carefully looked for MT, TNE or T4, but I found  
nothing. I hope IG has translated and shipped these to Germany also <g>.

d>I find it easier to use T4 as my core rules set, but I don\'t hesitate
d>to use CT or MT when I have a particular topic not yet covered in T4
d>rules.

That\'s one of my fears: I purchase a newer edition of Traveller and ... find  
other lacking features and new inconsistencies.

Example: What about learning of new skills and skill levels?

Learning (in CT) was quite difficult (and very time expensive), and  
nevertheless there was the skill level maximum (INT + EDU).

d>Example--there is no Shotgun group hits rule in the T4 basic rules,
d>so I\'m using the one from CT.

As I like the concepts and ideas in Traveller so I hate these things ...

Is there a kind of index in T4 to find specific rules faster?

d>Keep in mind that T4 is in its infancy.  The main book is meant to be
d>a basic book.  Other supplements will add more detail to the rules
d>system as the game grows just like Book 4 (and others) did to the
d>first three books of CT.

Oh? I never had seen a Book 4 (which name?). I own Book 1 to 3, a imperial  
atlas and a adventure, that\'s all.

What\'s covered in this and what do you expect: How many add-on books one had  
to buy to have all important rules? (Last but not least it\'s a question of  
money to me)

d>As for my Shotgun rule, Greg Porter told me that a Shotgun rule would
d>be covered in the Emperor\'s Arsenal due out in a month or so.

Plus shipping and translating time for me <g> (Of course I understand  
english, maybe far more better than writing on my own, but it\'s still a  
difference, so I like to have it in german - except, when it\'s very  
expensive compared to the english books (in Germany books are expensive!)).

Because of my long absence (to other realms of fantasy), two short  
questions:

(Classic) Traveller was sold by Gamer\'s Workshop Designers and today  
Imperium Games sells T4, is that right?

Can someone give me an email address of someone (from Imperium Games?) who  
can answer the following question? Who is the publisher of T4 in germany?  
(like Fantasy Produktion, Duesseldorf was it for CT). (I asked altavista and  
similar things but I didn\'t found anything that has to do with publishing  
Traveller articles in germany.)

James, I understand that the Emperor\'s Arsenal is bringing back 
penetration stats for weapons.  I\'m not a hundred percent on this, 
but if it is in the EA, this might give us some additional ideas on 
this or even solve the problem for us (if you don\'t like the ideas

Sod your discount! If you cared about the people you\'ve dissapointed 
with your shoddy work on T4 you\'d put this free mini-adventure on your 
website! (This is in relation to IG BTW, not Marc Miller)

I\'ve bought almost all the T4 books so far, excepting Starships, and 
that was because I had a chance to look at it beforehand. I\'ve just 
shelled out  33 pounds (about 50 dollars) for First Survey and Milleau 
0 from a local mail order shop, in order to keep them stocking T4. I\'m 
fed up.

IG has rewarded my loyalty to Traveller by screwing me again and again 
- - they\'d better get their act together damn fast, and start treating 
Traveller fans with respect or they\'re heading nowhere, and maybe 
that\'s where they should head. They\'re on \'strike 2\' with me, they\'d 
better not reach \'strike 3\'.

So, explain to me how Babylon 5 is related to Traveller? or Star Wars?
Oh, they fit under the heading "science-fiction". A broad category, but it
works. Of course, the category "roleplaying games" also includes Traveller,
as well as Blackmoor and even the general history of the hobby. Seems to me
to be an equally broad category.

ID4 stretches that category a bit, and the exchanges between our German
members and the Americans who chose to reply to them are completely
unrelated. I agree with you about those. Especially where they get insulting.

All threads die eventually. yes, even the extremely tedious but unarguably
Traveller-related Task System thread will one day be history. Some of these
threads started as a way of getting AWAY from that topic.

I myself see NOTHING Traveller related about lists of why Vader would kick
Q\'s butt or whatever the Star Wars/Star Trek thread is this time around. But
it happens, and no one complains about that. SOMETIMES, we talk to each
other just to find out what each other is like. I can accept that. I think
you will probably have to, too.

True enough.  Lots of stuff ends up being what you\'ve done before,
not what inherit ability you have (true in any field in my
experience).  If you never saw a given proceedure, or haven\'t
studied it you would be skating on thin ice.

Well, various traveller rules have called med-3 a doctor, but there
were also physician carrers.  If they didn\'t do med school as a
career, I wouldn\'t call \'em a doctor.  I would suggest a grouping of
medical skills so that medic (EMT), nursing, medicine, and surgery
were separate since to do otherwise would be like having a
"Spaceship" skill instead of engineering, pilot, etc. (or every
little sub-type of firearm, for that matter).

You might allow medics and nurses to get Medicine and Surgery
skills, but only to level 2 under any normal circumstances.  That
way you could get a sugical nurse who is forced to try something
beyond his training in a pinch (he\'s seen it before, even helped
many times, so he knows what\'s going on).

Hi Eamon,

I\'ll try to get an answer to the above for you tomorrow.  I\'ll answer the

Hmmm.  I don\'t see the relation between your statement and the decreased 
shipping charges.  We told IG, loud and clear, that their shipping 
charges were too high.  So they eliminated the shipping charges to the US 
and Canada, and decreased the charges by 50% to all other nations. I see 
nothing to be upset about in this regard.

Believe it or not, there are some folks who will buy anything with the 
word "Traveller" on it.  Also, some of us believe IG has cleaned up their 
act, and the product quality is improving.  For that sort of person, 
committing to the purchase of products in advance of their release is not 
onerous.  As a reward, IG is offering a discount for doing so in the case 
of pre-ordering 6 (if I recall correctly) products in advance.  In the 
case of T4 Deluxe, they really haven\'t a better way to judge demand than 
to ask for firm commitments (read: orders) from customers, since it is 
internet-only.  Finally, in the case of T4 deluxe, we have a good idea 
what we\'ll be getting.  It will be T4, edited better, and with errata 
fixes by Marc Miller (i.e., the task system he\'s been discussing on the 
list).  I don\'t think their asking for pre-orders of T4 is an unreasonble 
step, given the circumstances.

But, in the end, it is an individual decision.  If you are uncomfortable 
with placing pre-orders at this time, that\'s OK.  Perhaps, in time, IG 
will win your confidence.

As I understand it, this is a product only for the internet community 
(much like BTRC\'s Guns, Guns, Guns hardcover, which was also 
internet-only).  At some point in the future, IG will release a 
bug-squashed edition of T4 (softback, hardback, I don\'t know which at 
this point) to the general public, and it will be called "Marc 
Miller\'s Traveller."  This internet version will be "Deluxe Edition" - we 
get it sooner than anyone else, and it is a small print run, so the 
collectability is increased.

Again, this is as I understand it at this point - I\'ll try to find out 
more tomorrow.

IG does care about its customers.  That is why they have solicited our 
criticisms, that is why they have taken those criticisms to heart and 
changed their policies, and planned to make huge changes in the next 
printing of Starships.  That\'s why Marc is fixing T4\'s task system.  They 
don\'t seem to be behaving irresponsibly.

They\'re trying to make up for the errors brought about by the previous 
management.

I hate to see that you feel you\'ve been shoddily treated by IG.  The 
folks that put together the shoddy products are no longer associated with 
Traveller.  IG has offered special discounts and special offers to 
the internet community.  IG has changed their shipping costs policy.  
They\'re changing the things that we don\'t like about T4.  They\'re 
bringing in new editors, typsetters, graphic designers - all as WE 
requested.  Heck, they even have some new designers working on products 
for them.

To me, that constitutes a good faith effort, showing that they care about 
their customers.

It\'s obvious you feel differently.  I hope IG can someday win you back as 
a customer.

   Still doesn\'t work.  How did that brown dwarf get into orbit 0?  The
M9 white dwarf was at some point in its history a red giant (that is the
way most stars evolve--proto star to main sequence to red giant to white
dwarf), and during that phase of the star\'s life, orbit 0 would have
been inside the star, thus the brown dwarf would have been vaporized,
along with its moon.

   Now you could argue that the brown dwarf and the moon formed *after*
the red giant phase, from debris left over out of the planetary nebula
transition from red giant to white dwarf (there is some evidence to
suggest that planetary formation is possible during that time as
evidenced by the detection of a gas giant/brown dwarf circling a pulsar
found last year), but I don\'t think you\'re going to get any one to buy
off on a brown dwarf forming so close to the collapsing star.

   If Shorts exists at all, it would be as a moon of a brown dwarf that
circles an M9 *main sequence star* in orbit 0.  Planetary technonics
alone would be insufficent to keep the planet warm with fluid water
oceans and a breathable atmosphere.  No, much of Shorts would be covered
with a vast icefield, and the atmosphere above the icefields would be
very thin (trace in Traveller terms) and consist mostly of oxygen (from
the disassociation of water molecules), and perhaps some methane, carbon
dioxide, and smaller amounts of other components.

   So how could Shorts still be rated as Agricultural?  It\'s a stretch
(since it is so much easier and *cheaper* to grow things on a more
Earth-like world), but let\'s assume that while the surface of Shorts is
a frozen, barren, nearly airless wasteland, underneath the icefields is
another entirely different world.  Vulcanism provides enough heat to
create vast lakes and even an ocean or two of liquid water underneath
the frozen icefields.  As an experiment many years ago, Imperial
engineers drilled a number of tunnels through the ice, and created
pockets filled air in several locations between the liquid oceans and
the frozen icefields.  Later, floating colonies were established in the
pockets, and methods for recycling the air the colonists was breathing
were established.  The "Shortsean" colonial government soon became
reknown as being one of the most just and democratic in the Universe (or
"Shorts becomes reknown as a place you can obtain a new identity and
start over if you have criminal trouble on other worlds", or "The
floating habitats on Shorts were taken over by the Imperial government
and turned into a penal colony", etc.).  Many more colonists came in
(were brought in) over the years, and the population grew.  Light for
the colonies is provided by vast banks of (fill in your favorite
artifical light source here), and there is enough light and geothermal
heat that it is possible to grow a variety of hydroponic crops.  These
have been genetically engineered to thrive in the cold (temps outside
the climate controlled floating colonies aren\'t exactly like the rain
forests of Brazil--too much heat and the air pockets could be
compromised), artifically lit conditions.  Because of a combination of
materials in the native water, (fill in your favorite vegetable here)
grows particularly well, and much of the annual crop is exported to
other worlds.

   The above explanation still doesn\'t work for the world listed in
First Survey though.  That\'s why I say it would be much easier to just
change the star and keep the main world stats and descriptions "as is".

   Certainly, since Athena beats Ivanova so badly in that department,
there should be no discussion.  Oh I suppose if you like an **older**
woman who has latent telepathic abilities (potentially being able to

   Discussing the combination on Strephon\'s personal safe at the
Imperial Palace is more stimulating than relativistic rocks.  Problem
is, there are no true babes in Traveller (characters, not players). 
There was the "Lady In Black" on the cover of TNE, but she turned out to
merely be a psionic projection.  Shoshanna Dahnara-Avila from Children
of Earth vaugely resembles a 40-something Phoebe Cates, but unless you
have been following events in Traveller Chronicle, you won\'t know about
her either.  No, I fear that the Traveller universe is in general a
truly male dominated culture where the women are only mildly attractive
and stay out of the way.  No wonder Norris was AC only.

Given it\'s GDW-inspired heavily military background, this isn\'t too
surprising.  OTOH, I think the IG crew would do very well to do things that
will engage women *players* such as making attractive women in the game (no
battledress bikinis, please).  I think there is _plenty_ of room for
positive, strong female roles in Traveller, whether in art, NPCs, or as PCs
- -- think of Athena, Ivanova, Sarah Conner, and maybe Ripley as archetypes.  

Personally, while Ivanova is just a bit too fatalistic for me, I think she
(and the rest of the B5 crew) would fit into a Traveller campaign just fine.

Well, Austria HAS sometimes been quite bloodthirsty in the past during
it\'s monarchy times. But most of the times, Austria\'s motto was "tu
felix austria nube", which means "Thou happy austria marry!" or so (my
latin to english converter [TL 1] is a little broken ;-)
This motto discribes, that Austria\'s monarchs used to gain land by
marrying their children to other monarchs or influential people.

Still there are SOME austrians, which play this trick. Just think of
Arnold Schwarzenecker. :-)

The tabulated volume and area from QSDS are deducted from the base hull

using the lowest standard QSDS hull size greater than or equal to the
*combined* size of carrying ship plus all carried craft.

For example, an 800-ton ship carrying three 50-ton cutters on external
grapples would have a total effective volume of 950 tons.  The lowest
entry greater than or equal to this in QSDS is 1000, so 1000 tons would be
used for all drive/fuel calculations and so forth.

I\'m interested to hear what other people think about this.

When I got my copy of T4 and got to the combat section, I came across
a little sentence that stated "Because the dice code for ranged combat
tasks is dependent on distance rather than weapon type, it is
theoretically possible for a character to hit a target at 1500 meters
with a pistol, though very unlikely."  Needless to say, I quickly put

> Ah, that sounds fine. Do you think it is a good idea to buy T4?

If you like Traveller, I\'d say, yes, it is a good idea to buy T4.

T4 does have its problems, but it is also my system of choice right 
now.  There is something to be said for having a current game.  I\'ve 
tried the conversion route before, and it takes a lot of time, and 
this time commitment doesn\'t go away.  You are always converting 
something.  For time reasons, I prefer to stay as close to the 
published rules as I can.  I only fix the things that absolutley need 
it.

Given this, my T4 game is using the basic rules as written in T4, 
but I\'ve changed a few things here and there that I thought were 
broken.

The best advice I can give you is that I bought it, and I\'m glad I\'ve 
got the core book even with its problems.

The other supplements?

Starships:  
All you are getting here of any value is the SDDS--the 
Standard Ship Design System.  If you  like to design ships, and you 
don\'t mind paying $25 for it, then you might want to get this book.

I, personally, think it is one of the two poorest supplement yet put 
out for T4.  If you just want the design system, go to the Wildstar 
web page and download the latest version for free.



Central Supply Catalog:
Although small, this is a good book.  You get info on equipment, 
armor, robots, computers, and a vehicle design book.  In my opinion, 
it is one of the best T4 supplements yet produced.



Aliens Archive:
Another good book if you want to have some very "alien" aliens in 
your campaign.  This book has some problems, but I like it OK.  You 
can even use the races as player characters, in case a player wants 
to play something different.



First Survey:
All you are getting in this book are the maps for 9 sectors in and 
around Core.  This is the other half of the two poor T4 supplements 
that I mentioned above under Starships.

If you\'ve already got maps, then I\'d say pass on this one.  If you 
don\'t, ask yourself if $25 is too much for 9 maps.  Maps are a 
necessity, in my opinion, but that price hurts.



Milieu 0:
I haven\'t had time to digest this one yet--it is packed with 
information, but it looks like it is going to be a good one on first 
inspection.  If you want to play in the M0 time period, this will 
give you campaign background information.

Well, T4 does have its problems.  I\'m sure if you stay tuned to this 
list, you will have your pick of ways to fix things that are 
considered broken.

But don\'t kid yourself.  You will find some features lacking, and you 
will find inconsistencies.  but, you will also find some very good, 
easy to play rules.

I wish that I could say that T4 is 100% great, but I can\'t.  Adding 
to that though, I\'d say that T4 is getting better, and my hope (and 
faith) is that the game will just keep getting better.

Besides, your CT stuff is VERY compatible with T4.  You should be 
able to use supplements from both games.  I do.

> Example: What about learning of new skills and skill levels?

In my opinion, the experience system is broken in T4.  I will be 
working on a fix after I\'ve nailed out a new task system.  My opinion 
on how to fix the xp system may or may not interest you, but you will 
be able to find it here on the TML when I propose it.


> Is there a kind of index in T4 to find specific rules faster?

Actually, yes, in the main book, there is.  I was quite surprised at 
how complete it is too.

Also, if you choose to get T4, you will find a lot of the same things 
from CT in T4 VERBATIM.  Several chapters are just lifted from the 
Traveller Book or Books 1-3.

When I said that it was very compatible, I meant it.


> Oh? I never had seen a Book 4 (which name?). I own Book 1 to 3, a imperial  
> atlas and a adventure, that\'s all.

You\'ve miss a lot of cool supplements for CT, then.  Book 4 is called 
Mercenary.  Great Book!

Book 5 is High Guard, for Naval characters.  Book 6 is Scouts.  Book 
7 is Merchant Prince, for Merchant characters.  And the last book is 
Book 8 Robots.

Each of these books had extended character generation and special 
rules specific to that career.

Book 4 includes mucho info on weapons, large scale combat, recruiting 
and running merc outfits, etc.

Book 5 has a starship design system and a more advanced ship combat 
system from that in Book 2.

Book 6 has all you ever wanted to know on generating worlds and 
stars systems.

Book 7 has an extended trade system, and Book 8 includes robot design 
and use for Traveller.

Many of these topics are covered in the main T4 book, and if you 
already don\'t have those CT book, it might be cheaper for you to buy 
T4.

> money to me)

I\'d get the T4 main book for sure, and I\'d get the Central Supply 
Catalog to supplement the equipment list in the basic T4 book.  The 
rest depends on what you want to do in your campaign.

Look at the descriptions that I\'ve provided above for the T4 products 
currently in release.  Decide which ones will fit in your campaign.

If you are not going to be designing ships, then don\'t buy Starships. 
 If you want to have a lot of aliens in your campaign, then do get 
the Alien Archive.

Are you going to be playing  in the year 0?  If so, you might want 
Milieu 0, but if you are running a campaign in a different era, then 
this might not be a good choice.  Although I\'m running my campaign in 
the 1100\'s, I like the info I\'ve seen so far in M0.

In sum, get the main book and the CSC, then pick and choose the 
supplements that best suit the type of game that you want to run.

 
 I meant \'new to the game  
> and new here in the TML, but clinging to the classic rules\'.

I knew what you meant, Norman.  The innuendo was to get T4.

You said "Newbie (but CT)"

I said, as a suggestion that you should switch to T4, that the title 
of your post should be "Newbie (but T4)"

Lastly, Norman, if you have any additional questions about any of the 
supplements (from any version of Traveller--I have the bulk of them), 
or just have some additional questions, then feel free to e-mail me 
in private.

I\'d be glad to help a new Traveller player out in any way I can.

Welcome to the list!

Nope. If the round is slowed enough to reduce damage, then the removed
energy *has* to go somewhere. The flexible armor spreads it over an
area, such that you only get 1 point of damage for each die removed.

Or they raise a native plant that uses ethyl alcohol as an anti-freeze.
Picture something like 150 proof raspberries. They\'d selll *real* well
on the luxury market. 

Or, for that matter, there\'s nothing that says that "agricultural

producing drugs, fibers, even plastics.

Which is *exactly* what happens in real life! A bullet that goes thru
does *less* damage (unless it hits something vital). A bullet that is
stopped by flexible armor (a kevlar vest or the like) will cause
*extensive* damage. Broken ribs and the like.

That\'s why using flexible armor against anything much heavier than
*pistol* rounds is a *bad* idea. It spreads energy that would have gone
into going *thru* into impact energy. So instead of a deep puncture
wound, with shock trauma around it, you get the equivalent of dropping
a big rock on the character.

    'body' => '  I have a couple of questions about values and Formulae in SSDS as
printed in Starships. I sent the first couple of these off last week, but
didn\'t get any reply, so I have put them in again. Wildstar and Dave, I
would appreciate any advice you can provide.

1) Looking over the designs submitted for the first THUDD competition
(including mine), I have noticed something of a discrepancy in the crew
rules - specifically the steward and medic types.

QSDS (T4 p95) says that 1 Steward and 1 Medic are required if there is a
single high passenger.
Stewards: 1 steward per 8 high psg/cmd crew, and 1 steward per 50 mid
psg/other crew. Fractions rounded UP.
Medics: 1 medic per 120 people, and 1 medic per 20 low berths. No rounding
is mentioned.

SSDS (Starships p74) says that the requirement is rounded down, unless it
is less than 1, when it  becomes part of the duties of the Misc crewmember,
if any. So 1 high passenger, no command and no mid passengers do not need
a steward, or a medic.

2) The other problem is that the steward requirement is calculated per 100
mid passengers in SSDS, and per 50 mid passengers in QSDS. Which one is
right?


3) Whilst writing SAL, I tried to reverse engineer the price values for
Docking Rings on p103 of starships. I couldn\'t work out how it was done.
Going back to FFS, it seems (it isn\'t definitive) that they should be
handled the same way as hangers and have launch ports installed. The quoted
surface area backs this up as how it was done. If that is the case then the
price should be caluclated as [0.0002xVol + 0.0001xSurfArea] where Volume
is in Cubic Meters and Surface Area is in Square Meters. The following
table shows what the prices should be in that case.

 Small Craft    Recalculated
 Displacement      Price
          10        0.08

How about native plantlife which doesn\'t require a \'normal\' earthlike
environment, but which is, by an odd quirk, wholly compatible with human
biology and quite edible?

A native plant that is based on water on an ice only world? Remember that
it is not a terran plant genetailored to this planet, it has to have
evolved on it. This leads to the conclusion that the "oceans" also have
anti-freeze 150 proof in them.

Think about that. You need to distill out the alcohol from the drinking
water in order not to get drunk. Barfly heaven.

I think the "whomp" is on your chest when you are hit.

If you do it this way, you get in a situation where having armor will
increase your chance of being damaged.  That\'s what we were trying to
fix with the blunt trauma rule.

If you are hit with a 4D6 gun while wearing AV3 flexible armor, under
your system, you\'d take 1 D6 of damage.

But then again, lets say, wearing the same armor, you are hit with a
3 D6 round.  Under your system, the character would take a solid 3
points of damage.

In many cases, that 3 points will be more damage than what you would
have taken if the round had penetrated.

> Take it from someone with personal experience in wounds, blunt trama

Which your explanation doesn\'t support, given my example above.

If you don\'t really like my basic blunt trauma fix, try Glenn Grant\'s
or Mike Sellers\' more advanced fixes.  Both of those are good ideas.

Thanks, Commander X,

Kenneth.
___________________


Ah, I see your point.   A flat number for blunt, while the penetration is a 
random effect.  There\'s a quick fix for that.   Make the blunt damage random 
too.   In your example, for example(<G>),  the penetrated round would do 
1d6.  and the MAXIMUM blunt dammage would be 3.  So, make the blunt damage 
1d3.  Likewise for all blunt trama effects.  It should be only a maximum. 
(i.e. 1dBTN where BTN=Blunt Trama Number).

Hope this helps.

I was going to take issue with this until I realized thatyou said

It sure does, more examples of economic conflict;

The American Civil War
The American Revolution
WWI
WWII
The Gulf War
The Vietnam War

Now, I\'m not denying that there are not major other factors affecting the
motives of the citizens and fighters in these conflicts, but itcan be
argued that the primary motivation of the leaders in these conflicts were
economic considerations.

I figure the Zhodani in 1100 are starting to run out of natural resources

    'body' => 'Hi folks,

Over the weekend, the Web Newsletter generated a lot of questions.  Tim 
spared a few minutes from his busy schedule to answer a few:

Q.  Which German Distributor handles T4?

A.  FanPro


Q.  What is "Gateway" as listed in the 97 product list?

A.  It\'s the second half of the 2-part "The Long Way Home" from CORE


Q.  FF&S and Naval Archetect\'s Manual are both listed.  I thought they 
were the same products?

A.  FF&S will be the updated FF&S product.  Naval Archetect\'s Manual 
happens to share a similar name with the name used on GDW-Beta as a 
working product title for the updated FF&S.  So, on IG\'s web site, "FF&S" 
refers to the updated FF&S product.  Naval Archetect\'s Manual refers to a 
product that will provide instructions for using ships designed with FF&S 
in Traveller games (i.e., how to make deckplans, how ships are run, etc.).


Q.  What is "Aliens Hardback 1"?

A.  The details haven\'t been completely decided yet.  But, it will 
include Vargr and Aslan, at the least.  It may include 1 or 2 more Alien 
races.  It depends on how much space the other two take up.  But, they 
want to do a very detailed job on each alien race, so they\'re not going 
to skimp and put 8 aliens in one volume and so on.

I forgot one:

Q.  If Deluxe Traveller is just for the Internet, and there will be no 
softbound version, will a bug-fixed version of T4 ever be in the stores?

A.  Yes.  The web newsletter didn\'t state it clearly, but the 
Internet-only version is one that is signed, numbered, and stamped (as 
mentioned previously in correspondence from IG).  Eventually, Deluxe 
Traveller will be in stores (in hardbound only!) too, but the ones that 
go to stores won\'t be signed and numbered, and they will be from a 
different print run.  Thus, those who purchase the internet-only version 
will have a special collectible.

Well,, I alway figured, that they felt they were just protecting 
themselves from imperial imperialism (pardon the pun), which they 
felt was getting dangerously close to their borders.
They themselves, were never out for conquest, only for relative 
stability of their sphere. Maybe they also felt that their caste 
system was threatened by the imperial way of life!

Zho in 1100. Long term efforts to keep the (bigger) Imperium out of their
economic back yard.

        Continuing with the tradition <G> of sporadic Geonee posts, here it
is, the third Geonee setting that I am posting, that also happens to be
(chronologically) the first. UWPs are from FS, used with permission (thanks,

to the setting. You can find the whole, revised timeline at the Geonee

Setting 1: Milieu Zero & The Second Geonee Confederation
================================================================================

UWPs from First Survey, used with permission.

Allegiance: Gc: Second Geonee Confederation

Duuir		0928	A100155-C	Lo Va    614 Gc  M1V M8D
	(Local name: Rigaal). The Confederacy has sponsored the
construction of extensive shipyards at this system, which is the primary
supplier of military and exploration ships for the Geonee Navy and its
individual worlds and nations. The starport authorities enjoy a fair amount of
autonomy, although the key positions are almost always in hands of Geonee
noble families.

Inkhuug		1027	B686422-9	Lo         421 Gc   F3V
	(Local name: Hiponee). This heavenly planet was one of the signers
of the original Second Confederacy. In -45, a bloody Civil War was followed
by the decision to remove the native surviving population to Dreva, and the
planet was declared reserved for the Geonee nobility. Nowadays, the planet
is kept as noble residence and world affairs are managed by the assembly of
all residents.

Lalii		1028	E300588-4	Ni Va     510 Gc   F1V M6D
	(Local name: Dreva). The population is primarily composed by
former inhabitants of Hiponee (Inkhuug) ant their descendants, after their
forced migration. They are ruled by a bureaucratic, autonomous system, but
the Confederation keeps strong restrictions on the available technology.

Lagna		1029	B1108BB-E	Na         131 Gc  G3V M8D
	The planetoid belts of this system are full of valuable resources, and
they are the main source of ores of the Confederation. Lagna is also home to
most of the Confederation Research facilities, including the central offices of
ADRAT, the Association for the Development and Retrieval of Advanced
Technology, an organization sponsored by the confederation and fully
devoted to research, diffusion and retrieval of advanced technological
knowledge.
	Lagna is ruled by a former industrial family which joined the nobility
ranks when the Confederation was established. The present dictator, Count
Ar-Ganaal, has occasionally used foreign mercenaries to keep the local
population subdued.

Duundam E.	1130	B110344-B	Lo          514 Gc  F3V
	(Local name: Stenardee). The Confederation maintains a small
colony in this world for strategical and commercial reasons.

Vluuper Pim.	1131	C567333-6	Lo          710 Gc  F4V M7D
	(Local name: Ashavakuna). The native life of this world is hostile and
non-edible to humans. Nevertheless, a small group of colonists is struggling
against the environment and developing an agricultural exploitation in this
world.

Kiimda		1328	A100366-D	Lo Va     603 Gc  G0V
	(Local name: Tlasov). This is not one of the "traditional" 8 Geonee
worlds. In -78, the Confederation Navy moved to this low population system
and occupied it. Since then, many civil shipyards and pollutant industries
have moved here from Lagna, Shiwonee and Hiponee. The world is under
the direct authority of the Confederation.
	Most of the Geonee civilian starships are constructed here.

Muusha		1330	D443244-6	Lo Po     224 Gc  G2D M6D
	(Local name: Prindee). This unappealing world holds one
Confederation outpost.

Asadug		1430	BA86A77-C	Hi          433  Gc  F7VI M9D
	(Local name: Shiwonee). Shiwonee is the homeworld of the Geonee
minor human race. It\'s high gravity (1.3 G) and its geological hyperactivity
(frequent earthquakes and large number of active volcanoes) make it
somewhat inhospitable. Moreover, clymatic cycles that turn all regions
uninhabitable on a regular basis make things even worse.
	Nevertheless, both advances in wheather control and the
construction of extensive orbital facilities have led to a demographic
explosion in the last centuries.
	The planet is balkanized: the planetary surface is divided between
noble states and almost democratic nations. Almost all orbital cities are
autonomous.
	Shiwonee is the capital of the Second Geonee Confederation,
established in -190 to coordinate the efforts of the Shiwonee nations and
other Geonee worlds on two main fronts: interstellar exploration and
colonization, and technological research.

But why publish it as hardback? Shouldn\'t they rather look at the 
price and do a softcover. Another problem i have with this design, is 
that so much has been done on these races, wouldn\'t most of it be a 
repeat performance of what went before (especially those 
DGP - products, which will prove hard to top!). The choice of race is 
unfortunate, as well, since Aslan and Vargr have been done very well 
already so many old times won\'t feel the need to buy even more on 
them. I would, however, be very keen on buying data on lesser 
developed races, such as Zhodani, Droyne, K\'kree, Hiver and the like.
They would be much more useful, than "yet another Vargr, Aslan book"! 
I would gladly buy those!

Another unrelated point: I just noticed that M:200 is not included in 
the schedule anymore :-(

   Yes, I have done these calculations before. The shipboard time can be
   found by the equation

   T = Sqrt(4D/A).

   It\'s the same regardless of the maximum velocity of the ship at
   the turnaround point.

   Well, that\'s easy. My question is: What is the formula for the time
   in the reference frame of the planets? I tried to work this out once,
   and bogged down.

This is very close to the system I am using, except I divide the
attributes by 4 to get a modifier.

However, let me express my great admiration of your system ;)


Could I have a roll call of any ref who is using the T4 system *as is*?

Rounds which penetrate armor SHOULD NOT deliver blunt trauma in addition to
the penetrating damage.  If the round penetrates, the left over energy is
generally enough to slice through without significant resistance.

Rounds which do not penetrate but are stopped FULLY by armor should deliver
blunt trauma.

Having worn/been-trained-heavily-in-the-use-of kevlar body armor (I
wear/wore a Class IIIa Armadillo vest: it\'s in the closet...), this is all
based on live tests of non-penetrating rounds which I have witnessed (those
guys at Second Chance are NUTS!) and autopsy photos of penetrating rounds
which I was "treated" to ("Yes, Sgt. I will never trust my life to my
vest...").  Thank Yaskodray, I was never Irish enough to find out first
hand.

> Ken\'s fix for blunt trauma:
> 	
> 	The max damage rule cannot be broken by blunt trauma.

It shouldn\'t really apply.  If that M-16 (firing .223) penetrates my vest,
and it will - i.e. it misses the Class IV ballistic steel trauma plate -
the blunt trauma is the last thing I\'m going to be worrying about: it being
insignificant in comparison with the penetration/tumble damage.  However, I
will notice the blunt trauma from the .357 magnum that it stops completely!
(Nasty purple bruises, even through a Class IIIa, though not as bad as it
would be through a Featherweight Class II.)  And for disablement or healing
purposes the blunt trauma probably won\'t have much effect over and above
the more nasty wound...

As for armor that does not stop penetration being more wearer friendly than
armor that does stop the round, YOU GUYS FORGOT MATERIALS!  An armor level
of THREE has got to be RIGID -- that means ZERO transfer of energy to the
wearer without penetration -- and yes, the spent energy does go somewhere,
into heating the armor, chipping the paint, etc.

Second Chance(r) makes a rigid Class IV "suit" for the Coast Guard
(complete with a self-inflating life preserver) in a very stylish safety
orange: and having witnessed a test on it with a non-penetrating 5.45Bloc
(AK round), the wearer suffered NO bruising or damage or any kind (neither
to the chest with 3 rounds, nor to the groin with 2 round).  The test
"dummy" wasn\'t up for trying a penetrating round...  We suggested depleted
uranium, discarding sabot .50BMG, but he wasn\'t having any.  ;-)

Do you really think that someone wearing combat armor is going to take ANY
blunt trauma?  Nope.  Inertial compensators, padding, etc. will stop the
blunt trauma.  Only flexible armors are susceptible to it, and probably
being feasible about armor level 2.  And even most flexible armors (Class
IIa and above) will stop the average handgun round (.45ACP, 9mm) with
little or no blunt trauma to the victim.
</rant>
 
BTW, who\'s original ideas were these:

1.  Roll all damage dice for unarmored chars and use the highest 3?
2.  Roll all damage dice for armored chars and stop the highest first?

I always like to give credit!

Does "M9d" really indicate a M9 "white" dwarf? There\'s no such animal;
the universe isn\'t old enough for white dwarfs to have cooled down to M9
temperatures. (The coolest white dwarf I personally know of is 5000 K or so,
though I\'m not a white dwarf specialist.)

On the other hand, a brown dwarf could happily survive inside the envelope of
a red giant. It would tend to accrete mass (which makes it spiral inward,
and might make it turn into a star, though it\'s not clear how easy that is 
to do.) A brown dwarf in the innermost orbit of a white dwarf is perfectly
plausible - my PhD thesis advisor spent several years looking for them.
(Never found one, but presumably that\'s because brown dwarfs are inherently
rare.)(He thought he found one - G29-38, a white dwarf with a huge IR excess -
but the IR excess turned out to be caused by dust. No-one actually knows
where the dust comes from - dust should only last a few million years in orbit
around a white dwarf. Of course, we all know that it\'s simply the remnamts
of a planet destroyed by the Ancients...)

The IG Edition of TLWH will be produced in 2 parts.  It will be updated 
by the original authors (David Burden and Andy Lilly) so that it fits 
with the current sector map as presented in First Survey.  Other than 
that, no changes are currently planned.

It won\'t be a repeat performance for everyone though - IG has this crazy 
idea that they\'re reaching out to NEW customers with T4!  =)  As for why 
do it in hardback, I\'m told the cost difference of doing a book that is 256 
pp in hardback vs. softback is minimal, so why not do it hardbound? (BTW, 
the same reasoning was applied in the case of T4; that\'s why there won\'t 
be any more softbacks after the current inventory is sold.  Every copy of 
T4 produced in the future will be hardbound.  The internet-preordered 
ones will also be signed and numbered, etc.  But all will be hardbound.)

Which, IMO, is a good thing.  It\'s better to spend some time exploring 
and further developing M:0 before bringing out another milieu.

Actually, the purpose of body armour isn\'t to *reduce* damage, as much
as change the *nature* of the wound.  Rounds which penetrate naturally
cause massive internal and external bleeding (ie: difficult to treat
before the patient goes into shock).  Body armour that spreads the
energy out over a larger section of the victim virtually eliminates
external bleeding, while greatly reducing the chances of internal
bleeding.  Because of this, the victim has a much higher probability
of surviving the attack, even though s/he has been subjected to the
same amount of kinetic energy.  It still feels like you\'ve been hit
with a sledgehammer, though, but the type of wound isn\'t as life
threatening (barring the chances of fractured ribs puncturing a lung
or something like that).

The problem here is that most RPGs don\'t differentiate between these
two types of injuries very well at all.  :(

As you stated, a bullet that completely penetrates a target transfers
less kinetic energy than one that comes to a stop within the victim
(it is still moving, after all).

This is another problem with a lot of RPGs... armour piercing bullets
usually end up doing more damage than standard ammunition, instead of
less (on average).  :(

With the re-release of the revised Star Wars Trilogy, I am reminded of the
day Marc and I drove to Lombard (suburb of Chicago) to catch the opening, as
the film would not be in Bloomington-Normal for another week. 

I should mention at this point, that Traveller was largely written, and we
had run a few play-test sessions among trusted friends who could keep their
mouths shut. The sessions were electric with excitement, and we knew we had a
winning game.

We had dinner with Marc\'s mother (who lived in Lombard), then went to the
theater and waited in line for tickets. There were five theaters in the
multiplex, and four of them were showing Star Wars (the other film was _Gone
in 60 Seconds_ a deservedly forgotten piece of junk). All ten ticket counters
were selling Star Wars tickets -- there was a sign posted saying that anyone
who wanted tickets to the other film should ask the manager -- he had no
takers that I saw.

Marc said to me as we waited in the lobby, literally wall-to-wall with
people: "I know this is going to be great, and you know this is going to be
great, but who told all these other people?

We sat down, the theme music began, and the text began to scroll up the
screen, like a 30s serial -- I thought to myself "This is goping to be _very_
very good or _very_ very bad." Tatooine appeared on screen, the little
starship appeared on screen, and then the star destroyer began unrolling from
overhead. A few seconds later, I had no doubts about the movie whatsoever,
and spent the next two hours totally absorbed.

One further anecdote will illustrate the effect the movie had upon us:

At the scene where the Millenium Falcon went into hyperspace for the first
time, I found myself suddenly on my feet, yelling wildly. I then stopped and
looked sheepishly about, only to see the rest of the movie-goers, all on the
feet and looking around with the same expresion on their faces. We had just
given a movie special effect a standing ovation -- something I have NEVER
seen before ... or since. 

As we were driving home, Marc and I talked. I forget what I said, and I
forget everything he said except one thing: "Loren, Traveller _IS_ Star
Wars." And he was right.

Nostalgia mode off.

     Thanks for your latest IG update, which clears up (at least for me) a lot

Deluxe edition is now being offered for $30, but no sign or mention of the $10
discount originally offered to those of us who\'ve already shelled out big bucks
for the 1st edition.  Has this offer evaporated?  I surely hope not because,
especially in the wake of dropping $23 on a collection of blank maps, that $10
WILL make the difference between whether I order this book or not.

You are not disagreeing with me, here.  You are disagreeing with the 
T4 blunt trauma rule as it is written.

I was just trying to fix it and stay as close to the printed material 
as possible.  I don\'t try to make up rules for the sake of making up 
rules.  I really want to play the game as close to the printed rules 
as possible.

Some GMs like to do a lot of work to alter the main rules of the 
games they play.  I just fix things that I can\'t live with as is.

Again, I just wanted to fix the blunt trauma rule--not eliminate it 
as you are suggesting (for characters in armor).

My intent was to have armor protect you--not have a system where you 
stand to get more damage because you are wearing armor as Dominick 
has pointed out.

If you wear armor, you should take less damage than a character with 
armor.  To me, that\'s common sense.


> As for armor that does not stop penetration being more wearer friendly than

> of THREE has got to be RIGID

Look at your book.  Some material are flexible, and some are rigid.  
Diplo armor, for example, is flexible and does have an AV of 3.

It sounds to me like you have a problem with the descriptions of the 
armor types in the T4 book and the way they handle blunt trauma--not 
my fix for those rules.

> Do you really think that someone wearing combat armor is going to take ANY
> blunt trauma?  Nope.  

Combat armor, which they have not printed stats yet for T4, would be 
rigid armor, and therefore it would not have blunt trauma damage 
applied to it.

T4 pg. 57:  Rigid armor does not allow blunt trauma damage to be 
applied to the character.

I don\'t have a problem with that.  What everybody\'s been talking 
about is blunt trauma damage with FLEXIBLE armor.


> BTW, who\'s original ideas were these:
> 
> 1.  Roll all damage dice for unarmored chars and use the highest 3?
> 2.  Roll all damage dice for armored chars and stop the highest first?

You can look to Mike Sellers, Glenn Grant, and Eris Reddoch for 
those.

Ok heres the system.

If you unarmored, you take full damage up to 3d, 4d for shotguns.  (I 
personaly like this for the bullets,but  for lasers, plasma and explosives, 
no cap.  These weapons should be feared, why else would they be outlawed on 
an average 90% of all Imperial worlds, considering law level 0 or 1?)

Flexable armour gives LIMMITED protection. subtract dammage by the armour 
vaule, anything left over you get.

If there is none left over, i.e. full absorbtion, then take the damage dice, 
drop the d6\'s and make those points the maxium posible blunt damamge points, 
i.e. if a vest stops a 2d6 round completely, the character takes 1d2 damage.

Ridgid armour gives the MOST protection, if the round doesn\'t penetrate, no 
dammage, if it does penetrate, apply the remaining dice accordingly.

Moral of the story, you can kill normal folks with your .45, might need a 
M16 for the soldiers in balistic weave and kevlar, and if you see an 
Imperial Marine in Battle Dress and you dont have a plasma thrower, RUN!

Glenn, would you please write a few paragraphs describing what you felt

You mean your REMEMBER anything that happened after that star destroyer
started \'unrolling\'? All I remember is a blur of wonder after that, almost
like a dream.  It wasn\'t until the second or third time I saw it that I
started rationally thinking...\'Ok, this is a movie...\', and this was at a
time when films and film-making were huge parts of my life.

I have a friend who saw the movie something like 17 or 18 more times, just
trying to recapture the feeling he had in those first few seconds of the
film.

Yeah, sounds pretty cool.  So would you do something like this?

"Kenneth" (not his real name :) ) is feeling invulnerable in his flex armor
with AV 3.  "Marc" (say) sizes him up in the crosshairs of his 6D
Bandersnatchi gun.  To figure damage, Marc rolls six dice: 6 6 5 3 3 1.
Kenneth removes the _lowest_ three dice from consideration due to the
armor, and then takes 7/7/5 in damage, having added in the 2 pts for trauma
damage.  Then, in the tradition of Traveller players everywhere, he calls
for a medic and a Big Gulp break. :)

Sound plausible?

Excuse me, but IG is not marketing this game exclusively to those of
us with a long history in Traveller.  The newbie going to the game
store doesn\'t even know the Aslan and Vargr exist. I can\'t imagine
Traveller without these races, can you?  But that is how Traveller
would be presented to new players if IG does not issue "yet another
Vargr/Aslan book"!  If it is not of use to you, don\'t buy it. 

I look forward to the new product, because then new players that Stu
and I are trying to lure to the game will have reference of their own
to the data, without having to borrow virtually irreplaceable copies
of "old" material.  I also look forward to char gen systems that are
completely compatible to T4 without having to tweak and adjust.

    'body' => 'After reading the various messages on "Blunt Trauma" I thought that
I\'d contribute how I understood the rules.

1) Each point of "flexible" armor reduces one die of damage to one
point.

2) The maximum damage done to a human is 3 "dice" of damage.

This means:

	base damage	vs armor	acutal damage
	1D		flex 1		1 point
	2D		flex 1		1D + 1 point
	3D		flex 3		3 points
	4D		flex 3		1D + 2 points
	5D		flex 3		2D + 1 point
	6D		flex 3		3D

Note that once your damage dice equals your armor +3, your armor
doesn\'t do you any dang good.

Also, I do not roll any dice except those that do damage.  Otherwise
you\'re effectively violating the maximum damage rule.  The average
of 3D is 11.5, the average of 4D drop one is 13.5.  That\'s a fair
chunk more damage on an average roll.  The 5D drop two is higher 
still.

But, please remember that there are many of us "old timers" who don\'t have
all the materials you may have personally. Due to my age and financial 
circumstances back when I began playing CT, I was not able to collect all
of the published materials. And when my friend and I sat down to try and
puzzle out the rules for the MegaTraveller books he bought, it turned me so
off Traveller that I didn\'t buy anything else related to the game until I heard 
about T4 being produced.

And if the main idea of T4 is to also attract new blood into the game so that
it is not just a game for "old timers", I dare say that they won\'t have much
material from the old days either <g>. So why shouldn\'t the first major aliens
supplement cover the major 2 aliens in the game?

I will agree with your statement regarding hard- vs soft-cover pricing, I think
they would have noticed a *few* complaints regarding prices voiced on the
list, and realize that a soft-cover (cheaper) version would be nice for those
of us with families now who can\'t always justify dropping 30 or 40 bucks on
a game book. (It\'s the part I hate about being an "old timer" the most--getting
older...) <g>

I spoke to Lauren of Imperium Games about this, and this is what I was told:

When placing your order, if you\'ve previously purchased T4, just subtract 
$10.00 per copy on the order.  

If you have any additional questions along these lines, please email IG (see 
their web site for the address).

This was my argument, in addition to the fact that a lot of us old customers
don\'t have everything. BTW, have you heard anything further on the idea being
kicked around at one point about a CD-ROM w/ all the old stuff on it?

Didn\'t realize it would be so large, I was expecting something more along the
lines of Alien Archive or CSC. 256 pages makes it a much easier purchase
to justify to the wife <g>.

Agreed, I think a large part of the complaints that have surfaced on this list
over the last 7 months have been due to IG rushing products to meet some
damn fool schedule, e.g. Starships\' "ships designs pulled out of the editor\'s
ass", First Survey not matching M0, etc. It is definitely time that they 
started slowing down a little bit to avoid pissing off their customers. I talked
to 2 fellow T4 players in my FLGS this weekend who were sorely PO\'d about
the discrepencies in M0/FS. What good will putting out a product in time to
meet a schedule do if no one trusts it enough to buy it?

CAN WE PLEASE GET ALL THE POLITICAL WEENIE-WAVING OFF 
THE DAMN LIST!? I don\'t care whose government is better or worse unless
we are talking about the Imperium vs the Zho! I don\'t care whose religion is
better or worse unless it\'s related to the Hresh vs the Vilani! Can we please
get back to discussing 0.1c rocks, broken thrusters, hell even corndogs,
just so long as it is RELATED TO TRAVELLER!!!

If I wanted this stuff I\'d read usenet and their "WHY ALL [insert ethnic group/
religion/nationality here] SUCK" postings...

Sorry for the blowup, but the last two weeks signal to noise ratio has gone WAY
too far in the wrong direction....

(Now going back into mostly-lurking mode)

Honor Harrington comes to mind, as does Friday.

I\'m curious as to how many of you have female players/GMs in your group.
I\'ve always gamed with women, and have found them to be great role-players.
Traveller does seem to be lacking a strong female presence, but makes up for
it by not suffering from the chainmail bikini syndrome. 

It seems to me that IG could make some great strides in gaming by making
some of the major NPCs female.. I noted that all the movers and shakers in
M0 are men, so I\'ve decided that the Big Noble in my version of Fornast
Sector will be a Duchess.

I also find myself wondering about the discount.  It will make the
difference between my ordering it, and waiting until it hits the stores.

When it comes to the signed special editions, I really don\'t give a damn
about what bells and whistles are attached to the printing.  You could
release a version on fine linen paper, bound in engraved copper covers, and
unless the game inside works, and is reasonably bug-free, it won\'t be worth
my money.  All I want is a well designed, properly play-tested game, not an
assurance that Marc Miller\'s blood was added to the ink, and that with every
fifth copy a special "Girls of the Third Imperium" folio has been added.

Now for my question:  I do not, for various reasons, have a credit card.
The IG website swears that I can pre-order with a money-order.

ha.

Can I pre-order products, and then send them a MO fro the proper amount?  I
have done business like this before; usually the company sends email with
the invoice and order number, and I snail mail them a MO with the correct
information.

Which implies that Cleon is ....

Is the Third Imperium what happens when Luke & Han fail to destroy the Death
Star?

Much of the discussions I have read lately imply that most players are in
favor of the Imperium and Cleon.  Should we look for or develop some
materials on those groups who would prefer the Sylean Federation remain a
federation instead of merrily assuming you can inherit the right to rule? 

Is Cleon the good guy or the bad guy?

Excellent point.

Sounds like something I said, though actually my actual suggestion was:

1. Unarmored PC takes the highest 3D of the full number of dice.
2. Flexible-armor absorbs its rating in hit dice; roll only the remaining dice.

But whatever - your point is well taken: if the round penetrates the armor,
there should be NO blunt force damage. How about this, then:

1. If the weapon\'s damage rating is equal to or lower than the rating of
the armor, the hit dice are absorbed and the PC receives 1 point of blunt
force damage per die absorbed. However:

2. If the weapon\'s damage rating is higher than the flex armor, the round
penetrates and thus the armor has NO effect. Character takes full damage,
up to the 3D limit.

Sound realistic? It\'ll do, at least until the penetration rules appear in
_Emperor\'s Arsenal_.

Just to re-iterate: Lauren said the $10 discount is still on.  
Apparently, one just fills in that amount on the order form.  If further 
questions arise,email IG directly for information.

I\'d suggest emailing IG to ask about it.

No. But email Dave Bullock (webmaster@imperiumgames.com if I recall

on it.

I was expect 112 pages, too.  Apparently, they want this to be the final, 
comprehensive resource on Aslan and Vargr.  =)

The goal of Tim Brown (project coordinator for T4) is to get to a point 
where each project is alloted 6 months, by the end of this year (but 
maintaining the 1 book a month scheduling idea - thus, you have six 
designers/design teams working at any one time).

Of course, this beats the other end of the spectrum, the lurid, pulpy
"Overbusty Naked Amazon Space-Bimbos" atmosphere.  We\'re darn lucky in that
regard.  Go into any comics shop and take a look at the current stuff -- if
it\'s not some muscle-encrusted Rambo clone, it\'s a silicone-enhanced Barbie
Doll with just enough lint on to cover the naughty bits.  That\'s fine if
you\'ve got a thirteen-year-old set of gonads and the hormones to go with
them, but I, for one, would like to have rulebooks that open easily to each
and every page, even after heavy usage.

I can deal with Plain Janes in my Traveller rulebooks.  I\'ve got Playboy
Newsstand Specials for the \'other stuff\'...

It turns out that the FFW was, more or less, a Zhodani reaction to Imperial
expansionism.  If your theory is correct, then why did the \'Joes\' not take
advantage of the Rebellion and swallow up the Spinward Marches?  No, future
history (hah!) indicates that the Zhodani\'s major kick was containment of a
giant, cheesy load of notorious liars and emotional cripples.

In view of that perspective, the Exodus of 1202 had to be doubly
embarrassing for them...

Well, I may be a day late and a dollar short on this, but here goes:

According to FF&S (for what it\'s worth), craft in docking rings are
internal, but there\'s not one extra cubic centimeter of space available for
maintenance access and the like (as compared to the extra space that
hangars make available for these purposes).  At least that\'s the way it was
treated in the TNE ship designs.  The Mercenary Cruiser, as presented in
TNE (and earlier flavors as well, I think), had two cutters which were
internal (even though their back ends stuck out a little ways), and there
was internal space set aside for storing the extra modules as well.  Of
course, this means that such sundry tasks as changing modules become a
royal pain in the patoosh, and forget about doing that while maneuvering.

What does this mean now?  It means that you don\'t have to do any
handwringing about how QSDS deals with (or doesn\'t deal with) grapples,
because you don\'t need them for the cutters.

Of course, this brings up some interesting questions about how the cutters
and modules are handled.  First of all, you definitely would want to launch
the cutters before landing the merc. cruiser itself on any surface, since
its thruster-down orientation would absolutely prohibit any launch or
recovery.  Module exchange would have to go something like this:

1.  Launch cutter.
2.  Cutter releases module (keep that puppy tethered!)
3.  Recover cutter.
4.  Install new module.
5.  Launch cutter.
6.  Recover old module and place it in storage area.
7.  Recover cutter.

I had to do a floor plan for one in my TNE campaign, since I didn\'t have
access to any existing floorplans, and they\'d probably be at variance with
the TNE version of that ship anyway (as it was, I wound up discarding the
\'standard\' design in favor of my own).  Since the decks were perpendicular
to the line of thrust, and the cutters docked with what was the \'rear\' of
the cruiser in flight (or the bottom while landed), the cutters were also
perpendicular to the usual deck orientation, as were the storage spaces for
the extra modules -- they were \'below\' the cutters from their POV, but
\'beside\' them from the cruiser\'s POV.  Going from one orientation to the
other involved using a large section of deck which rotated inside a
cylinder and performed the 90-degree rotation (while standing on it, your
\'world\' moved, but you stayed rock steady).

The last bit of useful information:  Proper mission planning is critical. 
You can\'t expect to have time to change out the cargo/fuel pod for the
laser and missile pod during combat...

I asked about this recently on the list, and didn\'t get much response.  I\'m
not sure what\'s happening with Project Dulinor currently -- anyone know?

I downloaded the Alpha software on Wildstar\'s page; looks like some
interesting stuff.  Where\'s the Java applet though?  

And, um, who or what is CORE?  I\'ve seen many references on the list, but
no definitions (we really need a FAQ...).

I have a similiar problem, in that I have several credit cards, but do not feel 
comfortable sending the numbers over the \'net, especially to a site that makes
Netscape begin screeching about being unsecured. I would rather give my money

   My understanding is that there is one known M type white dwarf, and
that one is a borderline K.  Actually, I believe many professional
astronomers now use a different classification scheme than the old
"OBAFGKM" scale (one based on the composition of the white dwarf),
though the old scale is still popular with amateur astronomers.  But you
are correct, the age of the Universe tends to disallow such dim white
dwarfs, particularly in our part of the galaxy.

>On the other hand, a brown dwarf could happily survive inside the envelope of

   How?  You would expect that as the main sequence star gradually
expanded outward into the red giant phase, putting the brown dwarf ever
closer to the surface of the star, that the temperatures would rise to
the point that the brown dwarf would gradually dissolve.  Also, once the
star and the brown dwarf make contact, any remaining mass left over from
the brown dwarf should be absorbed by the star, perhaps even very
briefly extending the star\'s period on the main sequence (think of it as
the ultimate vampire movie--the star draws hydrogen from the "victim"
until its life force is extinguished).  At any rate, let\'s assume that
the brown dwarf survives all that somehow.  How does it survive the
transition from red giant to white dwarf?  Red giants never die
peacefully.  There\'s shelling of outer layers, and all sorts of other
violence occurring that should chew that brown dwarf into pieces in
short order.

>A brown dwarf in the innermost orbit of a white dwarf is perfectly
>plausible - my PhD thesis advisor spent several years looking for them.

   One possibility I\'ll have to give you, courtesy of the latest in
astronomical theory (which means its far from proven): a brown dwarf
that started out in a farther orbit, survived all the violence, but is
now gradually spiraling in toward the white dwarf (this would also
explain the prescence of the moon "Shorts").  "Shorts" is not going to
be a pleasent place to live a few million years from now (give or take a
few million years) as the brown dwarf finally finishes it death dance
and goes up in a big ***bang*** when it finally makes contact with the
white dwarf.

Harold

I spoke to a LTP (lady Traveller player) recently on this subject, and

fact that whether a character was male or female was basically 
irrelevant. Gender is just a detail that you tack on at the end for 
colour, if you like...in fact, recently I had some players encounter a 
human NPC who was neither male nor female, just as a red herring. 

As for the lack of female characters in Traveller - I think that T4 is 
fixing up the balance. The Milieu Zero book introduced a couple of strong 
female characters, both in the current setting and the past history of 
the Imperium. For example, the last governor of the Rule of Man on Sylea, 
Cleon\'s nemesis for many years in the Sylean Grand Senate, and of course 
there has always been the Empress Arbellatra, who wiped the floor with a 
whole bunch of brawling Barracks Emperors at the end of the Civil War. 

For those that haven\'t played with a \'girl player\' before - I thoroughly 
recommend it, but you\'d better be prepared for quality character interaction 
rather than plain old combat rolling.

Well, bless my horses.  Do you know that T4 actually addresses this 
wasted kinetic energy point in one sentence on pg. 57?

Yep, that\'s right.  It says, "higher damage attacks (meaning more 
than 3 D6 of damage for a single attack) tend to punch right through 
their target, wasting the extra energy.

Food for thought in this blunt trauma discussion.

If I were planning to use this rule (I\'m going to use my original 
blunt trauma fix), I do it this way.

K gets hit by M with a 6D gun.  M rolls only 3 D6 because the armor 
negated the other 3 dice.  

If any 6\'s are rolled in the 3 damage dice, they count as damage and 
they add one point each for blunt trauma.

	A roll of 6-1-5 would yield 12 pts of damage +1 pt of blunt trauma.

	A roll of 6-6-6 (yikes!) would yield 18 + 3 pts of damage.

That is, if I were to play this rule.  I think that it is neat, but 
it is not for me.

This is not how I read the T4 rules.  They give a clear example on 
pg. 57 dealing with a cutlass (dam 3D) and mesh armor (flexible armor 
AV 2).  The problem is that this example is unclear in that it can be 
used to support both of our very different readings of the blunt 
trauma rule.

One of my players read it the way you did, and I explained to him why 
that reading must be faulty.

To explain this, let\'s look at your example above.  The rule on pg. 
57 says that "if the armor is flexible, each negated die is treated 
as a single wound of one point."

Clearly, in your 6D example above, you are not giving one point of 
damage for each negated die.

In your example, the flex 3 armor has negated 3 dice from the 6D 
weapon, so by definition of the rule, you should add +3 damage points 
to the character.

They just didn\'t make it clear that these blunt trauma points are in 
addition to the 3 D max damage rule.  There\'s were the confusion is.

But, as I told my player, I could see that interpretation as an 
optional rule fix designed to cure the problem with blunt trauma.

Still, the information is already out there! If you look, you can 
find it. Over here, many stores still stock the MT Alien supplements 
(sadly, this can\'t be said about The Flaming Eye by DGP- i should 
have bought it when i saw it-doh!)
Even if reaching out to newbies, which i think is very good and which 
i appreciate a lot, shouldn\'t they try to maximise their sales 
probabilities? To that goal, it would be better to do something 
everyone would want. I for my part was very disappointed when DGP 
cancelled their Traveller support which meant the end for the Alien 
Sourcebooks. I wanted to see more on the other races, too, badly so!
I just don\'t feel it\'s wise to to a third version of those handbooks, 
esecially considering the quality of the predecessor. Additionally, 
won\'t DGP rerelease the old stuff anymore (any news on that, 
anyone??). Because if they will, it means that we WILL have duplicate 
manuals out there with duplicate info!

If that is so, then i guess it\'s o.k.! Some time ago, there was a

Hardback and one book. Although i only saw it once, i liked it a lot!

	30-ton launch. I made these because there appeared to be major
	errors in the Patrol Cruiser found in T4 rulebook. T4 PC is
	listed as having only 200-ton displacement, but some of the
	values show that it actually uses 400-ton hull.

	The Whippet-Class Patrol Cruiser is basically a TL-12 T-plate
	version of the PC found in Brilliant Lances. However the
	Whippet has much thicker armor than the original PC.

	The 4G thrust rating, long range sensors, two MDFs and long
	range weapons allows Whippet to "stand off" many potential
	TL-12 pirate ships. ("Standing off" means firing and hitting
	from ranges beyond enemy\'s weapon range. This works least in
	Brilliant Lances and Battle Rider starship combat systems,
	but I haven\'t tried T4 ship combat.)

	The date is given both in BL and T4 (W)USP formats.

   But even assuming that such a world exists, why go to all the
trouble, when it is so much easier (and less expensive to harvest) to
just throw some seeds into the soil on a more habitable world and wait
for them to sprout?  Even the "alcohol plants" would be much easier to
simply genetically engineer for warmer temps and take to another world
to grow.

   Making money at farming is difficult enough as it is, even in the
56-58th century.

Based on the fact that we have actually seen a really big planet,
fairly close to its star, in the case of 51 Peg. Some theorists have
modified the theory to suggest that the planet will eventually stop
spiraling in and come to a stable orbit.  There reason they came up
with this theory, is that it is kind of hard to believe that in all the
stars we have ever looked at, the first planet we discover is just
moments (astronomically speaking) away from plunging in to the star.  

Personally, I think the theorists like coming up with theories to fit
incomplete data sets.  But then again, I am an observer.

This is a personal decision, of course, but I\'ve really changed my feelings
on this.  Of course you should always be careful with your credit card
number, but I don\'t think there\'s any reason to focus on sending it over
the net as a particular point of exposure.  It is possible to sniff email,
and slightly more difficult to sniff Netscape messages, but it\'s just a
whole lot easier to get CC numbers other lo-tech ways -- from restaurant
employees or their garbage, for example.  

We routinely took CC orders from thousands of people over the Net where I
used to work, and we did not have a -single- case of a number being stolen,
despite a relatively high percentage of disgruntled hackers in the
population (who made their presence known in other ways).  In fact, the
only problem we had was from the other direction:  I would emphasize to IG
that they should *DEFINITELY* have a CC number checker so that they do not
ship orders made with fraudulent numbers.  We saw many more of those than
we had expected.  

I would rather give my money

This last option might be possible (I don\'t know how IG is handling this),
but if it\'s not, understand that it is *far* more labor-intensive (and thus
expensive) to take an order over the phone than it is to take one over the
web.  


ObTrav:  how do you handle this sort of situation in your game?  Do you
assume perfect encryption?  What if I\'m Soc15 but my wealth is in another
system several jumps away?  I played in one campaign that had banks
(effectively ATMs) built as standard issue into most starships; you\'d load
them up from a master account while in port, and then have to live off of
that (fairly secure) money until you got back.  This situation came up a
lot historically, btw, which is why "letters of credit" from one bank to
another (from London to Florence, say) were such a big deal.

Anyone for "Count of Monte Christo", T4-style?  Probably some good
adventures in that. :)

Hi,

Here is a write up on the world Ra, set in the Reformation Coalition circa 1202.
It is by John Muir Macphearson, Paul Walker, Rich Ostorero and myself.
If you are playing in the Old Expanses at an early time, it gives a bit
of history about the world that might be useful.  If you play in a
totally different part of space or time, you could use some of the
holidays at the end on different planets.  There is room for
improvements and additions, so feel free to comment.
The one thing that is missing, is an extended system write up. I find
making those up really boring, and never got around to it. Anyone out
there want to do it. Please!

    Port Adrian is the world\'s capital and is located at the south end of the

Seabridge Peninsula is 5000km from north to south. The other major continent
is named Bannon and is 16,000 km from pole to pole.  

History
	Before the Rebellion, Herring was owned by Cirrino Stronglia.  He
ran a back to nature, survivalist training center.  For employees, he
hired members of his family, figuring that he could trust them, and that
they would more loyal than strangers.  About fifty family members came to 
help. They started bringing in small groups of off worlders to train in 
survival skills, including small arms training, wilderness survival, hunting,
and fishing. The family didn\'t have enough resources or manpower to be self
sufficient, almost all raw materials were shipped in from off world.  They were
able to grow a fair amount of food in a large garden, but still shipped in
some foodstuffs. 
	During the Rebellion, the family saw an upswing in business, but 
towards the onset of the Hard Times, business began to dry up. The family
began to worry about their survival, and to supplement their income, they
allowed several starmerc groups to base themselves on the planet.  The 
starmercs started constructing a small primitive landing field for their 
ships. This still serves as the planet\'s only starport. It is at the
southern end of the Port Adrian helioport.  It During the last stages of
Hard Times, refugees started to land on the planet, at first it was a 
trickle, when Virus struck it became a flood, as over three quarters of a 
million people landed on the planet. The Stronglia family at first resisted 
letting the refugees land on the planet, but many were coming in ships that 
were failing and had no where else to go.  Unscrupulous merchants would land 
in the far reaches of the planet, and disgorge their hordes.  Others would 
promise only to refuel, but then release hundreds if not thousands of 
refugees.  
	The family debated on what to do, some members suggested hiring the 
starmercs to wipe out refugees or shoot down any incoming ships, but
calmer minds prevailed.  The family decided to hire the starmercs as a
security force, and to settle the refugees across the planet. This would
allow them to start to grow their own food, and lessen their impact on
any one area.  They also hired a company from Keipes to manage the refugees.
The company was payed off with the starport concession and short term 
mineral rights on the system\'s far planets. These showed some promise of 
being profitable for the production of radioactives.  The company was given 
wide latitude and told to do whatever it took to save as many of the 
refugees as possible.  The most immediate problem was that there was no 
food for the thousands of refugees.  In the first year, over 400,000 of them
starved to death.  In the second year, another two hundred thousand starved.
In the the third year, enough farmland was under use that the surviving
population of 150,000 was able to survive.
	Virus missed the planet on its first sweep through the sector, but 
several months later, a Vampire fleet jumped into the system. The
starmercs tried to fight them off, but were defeated.  After the Vampires 
had infected the surviving starmerc ships, they ignored the planet and 
jumped out of the system.  
	In 1140, pretty much everyone had finally conceded that the rest of the
universe was either dead or so badly destroyed that they weren\'t coming	back
to Herring any time soon.  The Stronglia family decided to create a formal
government, and to turn the surviving starmercs into a permanent army.
The family drew up a constitution and presented it to the refugees.  The
refugees were able to comment on the document, but only a few minor wordings
were changed. 
	The constitution set up the present system of government. It also set up
a legal system.  Accused citizens do not have many civil rights; they have no
right to consul, no right against self incrimination, no right to bond, and
are considered guilty until proven innocent.  The accused are often 
physically interrogated.  The rules of evidence are also rather lax. Trials 
are held before a panel of three judges, who question the prosecutor and any
witnesses that the defense or prosecution may have brought forth.  The 
guilty are sentenced to long prison sentences, where they are forced to do 
manual labor.  The death penalty is almost never applied, which is unusual 
for a world with such a high law level. It is only applied to the most 
heinous murders. This legal system doesn\'t apply to members of the Stronglia
family.  They can only be charged with capital crimes, and a panel of family
members judges the cases.  The death penalty is never applied to a Stronglia.
	The bureaus and the Stronglias set up 13 different communities. From
ten to twenty thousand people live in each community.  Originally each
community tended to be made up of people from one planet, but in the seventy
years there has been some mixing.  The towns are connected by a small two
lane highway.  Each town has unlimited use of the surrounding 2500 square
kilometers.  If they want to make use of any land beyond this, they must
petition the Stronglia family.  The towns do trade among themselves, each 
town has an agricultural specialty.  Sendegon makes excellent dewmelon wine.
While Leftbridge makes sugar and candy from the sap of the carbi vine. Port
Adrian catches dozens of different varieties of seafood. The towns have a 
center which is composed of the original buildings, that were built to house
the refugees.  These were hastily constructed and are falling apart.  The 
Bureaus are starting a new program tearing these down and turning the land
into public parks.  Most residents live in small single family houses. Each
house has a small yard.  There is a sense of community and most residents
know most of their neighbors personally.

Stronglia Family
    There are currently some 250 members of the Stronglia family, they all
use the family name as their surname.  Members of the family are usually
addressed with the honorific Kel for male members of the family or Kela
for female members. Most of the family lives on the family estates several
hundred kilometers north of Port Adrian.  The family estates are very
modest, they centered around the 80 year old main house.  This house was
built by Cirrino Stronglia, and has been in use since then.  The Stronglias
make a living by running a trading corporation which trades between the
different cities.  It is the largest such company, the Stronglias make a
point of not using their power to help the company. It really doesn\'t need
the help, it was the first trading company established and has built up 
an insurmountable lead on the competition.  The Stronglias also receive
a small amount of money from the thirteen communities, as a rent for
being allowed to live on the planet.  This tax amounts to about 2% of the
gross domestic product. 
    The Stronglia family is run by a council of all members of the family
over 60 years old.  The younger Stronglias have always complained about this,
feeling that they were shut out.  To help alleviate these feelings, in 
1197, the family allowed the younger members to appoint one of their own
to join the council.  They choose Kela Doreen Stronglia, a 31 year old 
who was filled with visions of the changes he could make, once getting in
a position of power.  So far he has been extremly bored with the council, 
because they really don\'t do all that much.  It is only in a time of crisis
that they are called on to act, otherwise the members tell dirty jokes,
play canasta and finish off the meeting with a good meal.  The council
meets about once a month. 
     The family has access to a fair bit of relic technology.  They have
several hundred small arms, mostly Imperial gauss weaponry. Two grav 
speeders have been kept operational, are are used in emergencies.  They
also have many miscellaneous consumer items, such as sonic massagers,
holovid games, microwave ovens, gravometric exercise equipment, and
an automed. 

Government
	Each of the thirteen communities sends representatives to the Planetary
Assembly.  An assemblyman is awarded for each 2100 residents.  This number
fluctuates, so that at anyone time, there are only 200 assemblymen.  The
assemblymen are popularly elected by the towns.  Assemblymen serve a three
year term, and can serve an unlimited number of terms. The assemblymen 
select one of their number to be the world\'s representative to the 
Reformation Coalition\'s Assembly of World.  The Stronglia Family selects
one of the Assemblymen to be Planetary Governor.  The current governor is
Manjit Bryce, who has served four consecutive terms as governor. The 
Planetary Assembly can vote to remove the governor from office with a 90% 
majority of the Assembly.  The Stronglias must then select a new governor.  
So far, this has never happened.  
	The Stronglia family also selects one of their own members to be the 
Chairman of the Assembly.  The Chairman has a veto over all declarations
that the Assembly makes.  No means are provided to override this veto.
The Chairman also has the ability to dissolve the Assembly and call for new
elections.  So far this has only happened once, when 37 of the assembly-
members were arrested on corruption charges. 
	The Assembly does not have a great deal of power.  It is able to pass
non-binding resolutions on any topic. It also has the ability to pass 
suggestions to the bureaucracy and the military.  All resolutions must be 
passed by a 75% majority.  In general the Assembly is a place for the 
people\'s representatives to talk about problems and discuss possible solutions.
These solutions are sometimes listened to, but often ignored.
	The real power in the government is the bureaucracy.  The Bureaus as
as they are called, were set up during the Hard Times that followed the 
Rebellion. The Bureaus are concerned with the welfare and well being of 
populace, but they assume that they know what is best for the populace. 
With dozens of different cultures being represented on the planet, someone
is always grousing and complaining.  The Bureaus are in charge of pretty
much everything except for religion.  The Bureaus run the schools, but tend
to stay away from the teaching of moral values, and the like, leaving that
to the parents and religious figures.  
    To many outsiders Ra seems a repressive planet, with a government that
ignores the will of the people.  Several groups from other planets in the
Coalition have tried to launch a democracy movement. The most visable of
these has been the efforts by the Blue & White party from Aurora.
So far these efforts have not borne fruit. One reason is that the 
government does not appreciate outsiders involving themselves with 
internal politics, the other is that the residents do not see democracy
as the ideal model of government.  They realize that Ra is not perfect, 
but it is better than what mob rule would turn it into.  Ra is firmly 
a member of the Federalist bloc, believing that each world is an isolated 
case, shaped by circumstances unique to the planet. Each world should be
allowed to determine the form of government and social structure that 
suits it best.  Kel Lucas Stronglia, the Assemblyman from Ra often 
critises other more interventionist Federalists, who want to interfere
in the internal affairs of other planets.

Seabridge Nest
	A nest of 500 hivers has settled on Ra.  They settled on Seabridge 
Peninsula, and have taken this as the name of their nest.  The nest is 
primarily interested in sharing agricultural expertise with the Coalition.
They have stated genetically engineering plant species for some of the
harsher planets in the RC, such as Phoebus.  The government of Ra, has
established a reserve around the nest to protect the Hiver larvae from 
human interference.  Penalties for broaching the enclave are fairly severe.
The nest is protected by the Company A of the 515th Ra Military Police.
The hivers have seeded the area with predators from the hiver homeworld
in order to keep the larvae population in check.  M. Dina is the head of
the project. 
	The nest was founded in VIII/1200. In exchange for the use of the land,
the hivers have given the Stronglia family a sizable cargo of high tech 
industrial goods. The Stronglia family sold these, to purchase two TL-12
System Defense Boats from Aubaine. These have subsequently been named Asp
One and Asp Two.  They also purchased a pair of weather satellites to provide
weather forecasts.  The hivers also supply a handful of technical advisors
to assist in helping the residents of Ra increase their tech level. In early
1202 the nest was attacked with a biological weapon of Solomani origin.  The 
renegade Dawn League scout, Vega Norn is suspected in the attack. She is 
also suspected in the firing of a nuclear warhead at the surface.  The 
target was an uninhabited island in the north. No casualties were reported, 
but a RCES crew was in the area. Several hundred of the hivers died from the
biological weapon which is believed to be Folgorex II.  This has severely 
handicapped their work, and it is unknown when and if they will be able to 
resume their work.
	The nest is supplied with state of the art hiver technology.  This includes
many expert system robots.  Thus ironically, a low tech world like Ra, is 
one of the few places in the RC where you can find large numbers of high 
tech robots.   The nest also has a state of the art passive electromagnetic
sensor array in orbit.

Society
     Since the refugees were from so many different worlds, they brought
different customs, religions and tastes to their adopted world.  This
heritage is still present on Ra.  Ra has dozens of different holidays, festivals
and other ceremonies, that a fraction of the population follows.  The blending
of culture has given Ra a very exotic air, as dozens of cultures merge into
something unique.
      The L\'Steich refugees still celebrate the Feast of St Vladimir, a four
day festival celebrating the salvation of the early colony on L\'Steich. The 
colony experienced a horrible first growing season, and mass starvation was 
imminent, when Vladimir Lukin arrived in system. His free trader had
malfunctioned and he needed some spare parts to fix his jump drive.
Luckily he was shipping luxury food items to Terra. He saw the 
desperate straits the colonists were in, and donated his entire cargo 
to the colony.  The Colonists celebrated with a great feast.  From then
on their fortunes looked much brighter.  To this day, the feast is
held on the 10th through the 14th of the ninth month of the year. It is 
celebrated with parades and feasts where the whole neighborhood joins in.
Of course historical events don\'t resemble the myth of St Vladimir,
but when did that stop a good holiday.
      The residents of Blackstone celebrate the Night of a Thousand Faces,
where the entire community dresses up in fanciful costumes and engage in
a wild party.  During this night, almost all social restrictions are relaxed
 and the people let themselves go wild.  Different groups in the city put
on block parties, and residents go from party to party, partaking of alcohol,
narcotics, hallucigens and other drugs.  Many people engage in sexual 
behavior that they normally wouldn\'t dare do.  In the last few years, the
festival has attracted alot of attention from the other communities on the
planet. Many residents of other cities have started to come to partaking in
the festivities. While other more conservative residents, particularly the 
community of Greenwillow have condemn the festival as a hedonistic ritual
that should be eliminated before it contaminates further generations.
     While Port Adrian is the capital of the planet, it is primarily
populated with refugees from the asteroid world of Kruyter. One of their
holidays is Equality Day. Mona Biel was a vocal supporter of minority and
women\'s rights.  In 432 the corporate dictatorship which ruled Kruyter at
that time executed her for her anti-government rhetoric.  The populace was
outraged and rose up and overthrew the government.  Ever since the date of
her death has been a national holiday.  Most people celebrate the holiday
by taking the day off, and spending time with their family.  There are also
lectures by prominent thinkers of the day. They give speeches on the status
of  to equality in the world today.
     The Corrigian residents of Sendegon and Le\'Fleiago celebrate the 
end of a deadly plague on the Festival of the Blessed Lady.  In -1500
a plague was ravaging the city of Belcoh. A mysterious woman appeared
and went through the populace healing the sick and raising the dead.
By dawn she had vanished, never to be heard of again.  A religion sprang
up around her.  On the day of the festival, the believers go to church
and pray.  On the day of the festival, the believers light their homes with 
white candles.  On Corrig there was a large shrine dedicated to the Lady.
It purports to have holy relics that were actually touched by the Lady 
herself.  Many in the community want to bring the shrine to Ra. They are
trying to organize a mission to do so.  They  have gotten permission from
the Stronglias and the Assembly of Worlds. They are currently trying to
raise funds.
      The residents of Kelogogianolk celebrate Holy Rites every 15 standard
months.  The Rites is a week of parties and wild abandon, followed by 
three days of contrition. This contrition usually involves fasting,
praying and physical castigation.  The Rites are supposed to balance the
soul, by purging the soul of urges that people are filled with.  Most other
residents of Ra, think the holiday is rather bizarre.
     The cities of Greenwillow and Hazardville celebrate one of the more
fun holidays, Minlidno Day.  Minlidno was the planetary symbol of Bestor.
She was a Keltara.  Keltara are a species of large arboreal animal native
to Bestor.  They are very gentle animals, eating fruits and leaves.  
Almost all humans find them extremly cute and adorable. They are covered 
with a beautiful golden fur, with large brown spots.  Keltara live for
several hundred years.  Minlidno was a orphaned as a cub, when a forest
fire killed her mother and father, and destroyed her habitat.  She was
found by a firefighter and brought to the local zoo.  Keltara hardly ever
survive in captivity, but Minlidno not only survived, but thrived.  She
was extremly friendly towards humans. Soon the entire planet had fallen
in love with her.  Minlidno died of old age, the year before the Collapse.
On the date of her death, people dress up and celebrate her life. They
either dress up in full Keltara costumes, or just wear something with
a Keltara fur pattern on it.  There is also a giant parade down the main
street in each of the cities.  There are floats, giant inflated balloons,
holographic displays, clowns and marching bands.  It is a very fun holiday.
     The Red Tide Fete celebrates the start of the fishing season on Welch.
It is celebrated every 7 standard months. (A year on Welch.)  Originally
it was celebrated with a large feast and story telling by the elders of the
community. The holiday is slowly dying, the current generations have not
ever seen Welch, and don\'t understand the significance of the holiday. They
are treating it as an excuse to take the day off.  
     Bolo Ball is the obsession of anyone descended from refugees from 
L\'Steich. On Ra, the game is purely amateur, on Balder the game has professional
teams. Fans on Ra, feel that Baldur has corrupted the purity of the game.
Fans on Baldur don\'t really care what the fans on Ra feel, they just want
to watch a good game.  On Ra, almost a third of the L\'Steich population plays
in a league. On opening day, the teams parade around town, boasting of what
they will do in the upcoming season.  They also talk to the fans, teach a 
few tricks to the youngsters.  Most people have a picnic dinner.  The night
ends with a fireworks display.
     The one holiday that is celebrated world wide is Remembrance Day.  This
day is dedicated to remembering those who died in the Collapse.  It is a
very solemn holiday.  Everyone has the day off, except for emergency 
personal.  Many churches hold special services to pray for the dead.  
The Governor gives a speech, and lays a wreath at the Remembrance Obilisk,
located in Port Adrian. The Obilisk is a obelisk of black obsidian sited
on a disk of white marble.  The obelisk is 200 meters tall, and the disk
is 500 meters in radius.  Many people lay flowers at the base of the 
Obilisk.  Remembrance Day is celebrated on the last day of the sixth
month of the standard calendar.  
	 The Sandpeople of Bolton tell stories of the immense wealth that their
ancestors left behind on the homeworld.  A group of them has tried to get 
the Assembly of Worlds to grant them a deed to the planet, so as to prevent 
anyone else from recovering the treasures.  They are also trying to raise 
capital to finance a recovery mission.  They are a rather poor community 
and have so far been unable to launch a mission. 
     The cuisine of Ra, is also quite varied.  Food in the communities 
with refugees from L\'Steich, tends to be most vegetarian. There was very
little room on L\'Steich for raising animals, so the people mostly ate
vegetables.  They came up with hundreds of ways to serve vegetables, and to
make them succulent and savory.  Now that they have access to more meat, 
the chefs still make vegetables their specialty, using meat as an accent.
     Kelogogianolk food is extremly hot and spicy. They brought several 
spice plants from Reagan, and they have found a few more on Ra.  Most 
other Ra residents won\'t even touch the stuff, except for a few hardy
souls with cast iron stomachs.

Hmm.  Well, obviously there\'s a female in my RPG group now.  <G>  
OTOH, come to think of it, there was semi-regularly before I met Suzette.  
As a matter of fact, way back in the old days, when 
RPG\'s were printed on Stone Tablets, and I actually used to play 
in (and more infrequently run) AD&D, before I gave it up for the one 
true faith, it seems like the groups generally had at least one (or 
more) women involved.

Overall, I think Traveller has a decent record about this.  Yes, 
there was a strong military bent about certain aspects of Traveller 
(and it got a little more so as time went on).  Nonetheless the lack of strong 
sexual flavor, and the absurd "chainmail bikini" syndrome present in 
many RPG\'s, made it a natural, IMO, for a mixed gaming group.  BTW, I 
can recall several DGP adventures that featured female characters and NPC\'s.  
GDW\'s Knightfall, for one, featured 2 Vilani females, and a female Vargr.  OTOH, 
the core of science fiction and RPG\'s fan base are both predominantly male, 
which would explain the predominance in Traveller, I suppose.  

Come to think of it, in all the years that I\'ve visited FLGS\'s, I think 
I\'ve seen about 3 women:  my wife, the wife of the owner of one of the 
shops I frequent, and Liz Danforth, who used to hang out at Flying Buffalo 
all the time when they used to actually run a game store here in 
Scottsdale, AZ.

   I always used the charter rules given in Book 2 (I assume they are in
   T4 also) for nonstarships. The customer then pays the charter cost by
   the day for the fraction of the cargo space he needs.

   I think the science fiction connection is a strong one here. In the
   fantasy RPG\'s I\'ve played in, there have always been women players. I
   think this is because many women like Tolkien and other fantasy
   writers, so they are attracted to Fantasy RPG\'s despite the chainmail
   bikinis. Very few women read science fiction, however, (with the
   possible exception of Michael Chrichton), and in the 18+ years I
   have been playing Trav, I have only seen three women play.

   Not that that bothers me very much. I kinda enjoy the clubhouse feel
   most Traveller games have, and the complete absence of sexual
   jockeying that enevitably goes on in mixed groups. And despite some
   assertions to the contrary on this list, I have never noticed that a

   sexual lines in either my D&D games or in my (limited,
   female-wise) Traveller games. Insofar as there is a breakdown,
   it follows lines of experience with RPG\'s, which women often lack.
   I\'ve noticed that newbie women in RPG\'s often model their characters
   after comic-book superheroines, while newbie men seem to prefer a

Well yeah, but I think you may be minimizing the military nature of CT at
least.  My wife, an avid RPGer (though no chainmail bikinis :) ) was
somewhat turned off by the "boys" nature of having to know what ACR,
claymore mine, FGMP-15, battledress, etc., meant.  Boarding actions she was
into. :)  Still, I think with the almost military-only character generation
and adventure generation, it\'s all too easy to have Traveller campaigns
resemble "The Guns of Navarone."  We may not need to have them become
"Sleepless in Seattle," but something in the middle (Aliens? B5?) is in
order.  

This is one reason I made the "scientist" chargen tables (which, yes, I\'m
still looking for.  I\'m down to the boxes we haven\'t unpacked in several
moves...).

He should be neither.

One of the great historical things about Traveller is that there never were
clear heroes and villains. Just ambiguities.

Remember how the Zhodani were thought to be this insidious evil? And then
once you got to know them, they weren\'t that bad. They just did
things,...differently.

The Imperium/Sylean conflict should be no different. Let the players
choose. Ref\'s shouldn\'t choose for them!

Best,

Chris

Correct, white dwarfs are usually classified with something other than
OBAFGKM - mostly classified instead based on temperature and composition.
Still, it\'s a convienient shorthand - I don\'t object to Traveller\'s use
of it. Nor even to there being an M white dwarf...but an M*9* is really red - 
there\'s only a handful of M9 stars known at all. Much cooler than an M0, 
far too cool to be a white dwarf.

Let me put it this way: the second-best brown dwarf candidate currently
known, GD165B, is a companion (at about 50 AU) to a white dwarf.
There\'s no particular reason why the brown dwarf would dissolve. The outer
layers of the red giant\'s atmosphere are only a few thousand kelvin. 
The outer atmosphere of the brown dwarf would heat up to the same
temperature - which is far short of what would be needed for the brown
dwarf atmosphere to start sublimating off. Brown dwarfs are small, and
dense, with very high surface gravity; there\'s no reason why they can\'t hold
onto their atmosphere in multi-thousand-kelvin conditions (and, in fact, very
young brown dwarfs may well naturally have surface temperatures of 3000K or
more.) 

How expect the star to suck mass off the brown dwarf? Again, because the
brown dwarf is massive, its surface gravity is very high. Because the 
red giant is thin and wispy, its surface gravity is very low, even though
its total mass is higher. Mass transfer will actually go the other way - the
brown dwarf will accrete mass from the red giant (classic common-envelope 
binary), possibly (though not necessarily) enough to push it over the line
into starhood. It will also spiral inward (it\'s gaining mass but not 
angular momentum so its orbit has to contract.) If it started out too
close, it will hit the core of the red giant, which admittedly would
be catastrophic. But if it started out just right, by the time the red giant
phase is over it could stop just short of the white dwarf (or moderately-
far-away...) (Brown dwarfs outside the red giant envelope spiral outward,
since they don\'t gain mass and the red giant has lost it; the net effect
is that there\'s a gap in allowed orbits around the white dwarf, from
about 3 AU to about 10 AU.) 0-3AU and 10-infinity are allowed. 

Finally, the transition from red giant to white dwarf isn\'t violent in
any sort of way that would chew the brown dwarf into pieces. (What do
you think it\'s doing - flinging huge chunks of star off into space like
a Star Trek special effect?) The gas comes off relatively quickly by
astronomer standards, but slowly by human standards, and will just pass
the brown dwarf harmlessly by. Binary stars survive their more-massive
partners supernovae, after all...

I have no idea why you think the brown dwarf will keep spiralling in once
the red giant phase is over. Whatever orbit it ends up in (probably a very
circular one, but that\'s irrelevant) will be stable. Neither object is 
losing mass. Orbits are, in the absence of external perturbations, stable
forever.

Listen - I have a PhD in astronomy, my thesis was a brown dwarf search,
I\'ve looked for white/dwarf brown dwarf binaries using the largest
telescope in the world - I know what I\'m talking about.

At the time of Marc;s statement, Cleon, Strephon (indeed, the whole

In a word, no. Marc was referring to the general ambience of movie and game.
He did not mean that Emperor Green-face and Cleon Z. were one and the same.
If you need to use "Good-Guy/Bad-Guy" labels, Cleon is a Good-Guy.

The conversion of Battle Dress (the powered version) from CT to
T4 has resulted in a huge upgrade of the armor, from "to hit" minuses to
virtual immunity to most small arms.  Any suggestions that might be more
palitable to our referee?

Also, the ship combat system has changed substantially.  We\'re
confused with the sandcasters.  The T4 rules seem to imply that you are
able to detect the number os lasers trained on your ship, and fire the
sand casters accordingly.  How do you know how many lasers the
enemy will fire?  Also, do you have to manuver around your own
sandcasters to fire your lasers?  I assume so.  Must the sandcasters be
controlled like missles after they\'re fired?  And finally, I assume that
launched sand casters will not remain with the ship if it accellerates.  Is
this true?

By the way, does anyone know what happened to Dave Golden\'s web

Why the heck haven\'t you replied to any of the requests I\'ve seen on the TML?
I am looking for a copy of Solomani and Aslan, and I would even consider
paying the shipping from Germany if the price was right.

There may be many over there, but on this side of the Atlantic, I have had a

This is a can of worms it\'s best not to open.  One of my major problems
with the Traveller background is how truly low-tech underlying industries
like manufacturing and information processing are.  If we avoid sinking
into a downward social/ecological spiral in the near future, within a
century or two we should be quite capable of synthesizing any desire
material or product directly from raw feedstock of appropriate elemental
abundances.  You want an alcoholic raspberry?  Synthesize one.

There will no doubt continue to be luxury markets in organically grown or
"low-tech" manufactured goods, just as there are today; but the bulk of
material needs will be satisfied using synthesis, relying only on rocks,
seawater, and (perhaps) sunlight as raw materials.

In a society with this technology, large-scale shipping of goods between
star shystems makes no sense at all.  Why schlepp 10,000 tons of Fubar
Root across two parsecs, when you can synthesize the same amount at your
destination from a few carloads of wet gravel?

The Traveller background is basically (basically!) 20th-century society,
with our cultural and economic underpinnings, and star travel grafted on
top.  This is probably the only way it can work as a game; players need to
be able to mostly rely on their real-world knowledge to understand the
game world; otherwise, you\'d need a year-long intro course just to know
what was up in the game world, what the assumptions are.  A real 57th
century human society would likely be as incomprehensible to us as
downtown LA would be to Gilgamesh.

Grapples and Docking Ring Issues:

Definitions:
  Docking ring:  A docking ring is an area within the hull that is nearly
the exact shape and size of the carried craft.  Grapples are installed as
part of this indentation to hold the craft in place.  The craft takes away
from the internal volume of the ship.  For an example, see the Disney movie,
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, the small rowboat used an example of a docking
ring.
    ____________
   /         ___|  ___
  |         |___  |___| 
   \\____________|

  Grapples:  Grapples are simply latches and tethers that are used to hold a
carried craft to the parent ship and connect it to that parent (for fuel,
passenger and data transfer, etc).  Grapples do not necessarily hold a craft
within the existing hull area of a parent ship.  The carried craft does not
take away from the internal volume of the ship.  For an example, consider
the typical long boat carried on early wooden sailing vessels, they hang
next to the actual hull, but are not allocated a place within the ship.
    _____________
   /             |
   \\_____________|
        c:::


  QSDS does not really allow for Docking Rings.  QSDS takes a prebuilt hull
and fits it with standard parts, and as such, there are no areas where the
indentation can be made for a docking ring.  For practical purposes,
however, assume that this can be done and that the docking ring area is
available (hollowed out) within the hull.  While in reality, the price
involved would not allow the discounted rate, for game purposes, don\'t worry
about this.

  The size of the hull and Jump/Maneuver Drive selection is an issue.  When
using a docking ring, the volume needed for a carried craft would need to be
allowed within the existing hull, and the selections for Jump and Maneuver
Drives (and anything else based on hull size) would reflect the hull size
chosen initially.  When using grapples, on the other hand, the volume for
the carried craft would be in addition to the existing hull.  The Jump and
Maneuver Drives (and anything else based on hull size) would reflect the
hull size initially chosen PLUS the size of the carried craft.

Examples:

  800 Dislacement Ton Merc Cruiser with three 50 Displacement Ton Cutters In:

  Docking Rings:  The Jump and Maneuver Drives (and anything else selected
based on the total volume of the ship) would be chosen based on 800 Disp
Tons.  Everything designated to be a part of the ship (apart from the
cutters) would need to fit within 650 Dips Tons because 150 Disp Tons is
allocated for the Cutters.

  External Grapples:  The Jump and Maneuver Drives (and anything else
selected based on the total volume of the ship) would be chosen based on 950
Disp Tons.  Everything designated to be a part of the ship (apart from the
cutters) would need to fit within 800 Disp Tons and the Cutters would be an
additional 150 Tons that would be jumping and maneuvering with the ship.

Any Questions?

Mea Culpa, sarcasm mode should have been set to \'on\'.  Especially since
I\'m a yankee by birth.  (A Northeasterner that is, not a baseball player)
and descended from a Passamaquoddy (The family still doesn\'t talk about
that though - not the older folks at least).

Many many Native American people were killed by guns in the hands of
settlers in New England and Virginia colonies, as well as later in
just about every other region of the U.S. settled by Anglican descended
settlers.  They were conquistadors and exploiters just like the Spainish.
Didn\'t mean to imply otherwise.

In defense of all the invaders, many of the deaths caused by them were due
to germs and viruses brought over which the natives of the American
continent had no resistance to.  While not forgiving those who took land
from the Native people, to their credit some of the people who came had no
trouble with the Indians and indeed got along well with them.  The
traditional \'pilgrims\' being, originally, in this group.

It\'s _possible_ for someone equipped with a "sniffer" program to extract
credit card numbers from the network packets flying by.  It\'s not easy, but
it\'s possible (and, IMHO, it\'ll happen one of these days).

On the other hand, sending your credit-card number over the \'net is at least
as safe as charging something at a store or restaurant (particularly if you
don\'t personally destroy your carbon paper).

The main reason for wanting secure servers and transactions is to protect
the credit-card company and/or seller from loss.  IF someone "steals" your
number, you can dispute the charge when it appears on your bill - and have
a good chance of winning, since the seller doesn\'t have your signature on the
charge slip (they can\'t prove that YOU did indeed make the charge).  Either
the credit-card company or the seller would have to take it on the nose,
and they don\'t want to do that.

With a secure server, the vendor can prove that the request did indeed come
from the cardholder - protecting themselves and the credit-card issuer from
the possible loss if the charge is disputed.  This also protects you from
the hassle of disputing the charge.

> ObTrav:  how do you handle this sort of situation in your game? 

See below.

> Do you assume perfect encryption?

No, but I assume Pretty Darn Good (PDG) encryption; I extrapolated based on
what was theorized about public-key and trapdoor crpytography at the time
(late seventies); most of it seems to have become possible in the last few
years.

> What if I\'m Soc15 but my wealth is in another system several jumps away?

Hopefully you brought your Credit Card with you, with a lot of money on it.
If not, get an X-boat to message your bank, and have them transfer you some
funds (and be prepared to wait several months).

I did something similar, except that they were credit-card sized pieces of
plastic and silicon that did the same thing - "smart cards".

In my campaigns, a "Credit Card" (actually a debit card in modern
terminology, but back in \'78 I didn\'t even have an ATM card yet) was
a credit-card-sized computer, with a display, a few buttons, and a socket
(rather like a modern-day PCMCIA card, but with a display and buttons on
top).  One of the buttons was actually a fingerprint scanner (in most
models).

The card itself contained a running balance (which could be displayed by
touching a button) of the money it carried.  THe money was actually "in" the
card - but it\'s the custom to "clear your card" periodically.  If the card
is lost or stolen the money is gone - BUT you can return to the issuing bank
and request an audit of the card - this will take a while, but eventually
you\'ll get your money back.  The more recently you\'ve "cleared your card",
the quicker this audit process will be.

To use it, the character would drop the card into a terminal (every starship
had at least one, and practically every bank and business in a starport
or on TL-10+ worlds had one too).  Then you\'d ring up the transaction on the
terminal, and the user would transfer money to or from the card by punching
his or her password and pressing "execute".

Banks and moneychangers could use the terminal to issue you cash for a stay
on a world that was too low-tech to accept credits; and everyone carried a
little cash in small denominations for small purchases.  But most
transactions over about Cr 100 were electronic (people who made large cash
purchases were considered suspicious - or possibly even automatically
criminal - depending on the law level of the place.

Inside, encoded with a fairly-secure* public-key cryptography scheme, the
card contained data about the user (name and all that stuff, plus several
ways of identification: a password, fingerprints, a retina scan, and a DNA
scan).  Also in there was a beginning balance and a transaction record; each
transaction encoded with the responsible authority\'s public key, and
validated with the card\'s public key.

* Estimated to take over a century to solve with a Model-9 computer.  If you
  could afford the hundred-odd Model-9s it would take to crack the card in
  a reasonable amount of time, you were either a government (in which case
  the Imperial Navy would be paying you a visit Real Soon Now), or were 
  wealthy enough that scamming credit cards is small potatoes.

The card\'s computer could validate transactions with the user\'s private key;
the private key was only "unlocked" when someone gave the correct password
and punched the "execute" button with the correct thumbprint.  This recorded
another transaction in the card\'s database, and adjusted the running
balance.

When a card is "cleared", it\'s taken to a participating bank and the owner
unlocks the card for audit (if the card has been lost or stolen, the owner
fills out a lot of paperwork, and gets thumbprint, retina, and DNA scans
taken, and then waits for the issuing bank to come up with their copy of the
card data).  The bank reads out all of the transactions, and (checks them
against its database; the initial balance of the card is updated, and the
rest of the transactions are erased from the card (they\'re retained in the
bank\'s database).  In the case of a lost or stolen card, the bank relies on
the records in its database to compute what the cards balance should have
been when it was stolen.

Terminals have a database of stolen cards (updated by planetary comm-net,
and by x-boat for offworld banks); they\'ll refuse to process a stolen card,
and may well cause an alarm.  After a waiting period (so that the bank can
collect all of the transactions made between the time the card was last
cleared and when the loss/theft was reported), the bank will compute the
proper final balance, and issue a new card.

The waiting period can be long, particularly if the card was last cleared on
a different world, or if enough time has passed to make a trip offworld and
return before the loss/theft was reported.

Experienced interstellar travellers "clear their card" with a world\'s
premier bank immediately on arrival, and again immediately before departure.

Can you give us a little background about what you mean by "Ecology 101"?

    'body' => 'I\'ve been holding off reviewing M0 because it has taken me a while to 
digest the book--a testament to just how much information is in this 
thing.

Hold your popsickles, M0 is a good background book.



Strengths:
As I just eluded, M0\'s major strength is the wealth of information 
you get in it.  Just look at these topics that are covered:

	* How the formation of the Imperium came about after the Long Night.

	* Cleon\'s role in the formation of the Third Imperium.

	* A dialog on the expansion process that the 3I uses to grow.

	* Contact procedures for worlds--from first contact to full 
	integration into the 3I.

	* Things that have gone wrong for the 3I.

	* The creation and role of the Scouts in the 3I.

	* The role of the Imperial Navy.

	* The role of the Imperial Army.

	* The role of the Imperial Marines.

	* Problems of expansion.

	* Power structures and politics in the year 0.

	* Specific info about Sylea.
	
	* Structure of the 3I.

	* Structure of the Vilani Confederation.

	* Intelligence agencies in the year 0.

	* Megacorporations in the year 0.

	* Other companies in the year 0.

	* The Imperial Moot and Nobles.

	* Types of nobles and the Orders of Knighthood.

	* The AAB:  The Vilani Repository of All Knowledge.

	* Referee\'s info for gamemastering games in the year 0.

	* Sample patron encounters.

	* Year 0 Library Data.

	* Core sector complete ref\'s data.

	*How the TAS was started.

And there\'s much, much more.

This book is crammed with info.  It\'s 110 pages, and there are very 
few pictures.  There\'s not even that much spacing between sections 
of text--you are basically getting two full columns of background 
material with every page.

Damn.  Just that alone gives it a winning review in my book.  I\'d 
compare M0 to the old DGP supplements that everybody loves.  
Remember the Starship Operator\'s Manual?  Remember how it told you 
everything you wanted to know about how a starship operates?  Well, 
M0 does this for the Milieu 0 campaign.

And another nice perk is that within the sections of text, there are 
adventure ideas on how to use the information presented in a game.

Although I agree with another poster that these adventure hooks 
should have been somehow seperated from the text in a shaded box or 
something, it is great to have them in there.

Nice job guys.



Weaknesses:
I purposely noted the good stuff first, because I don\'t want these 
negatives to alter the perception that M0 is not a good buy.

But, I do have a few gripes, abeit that some of them are small, 
about M0.  I\'ll list these in order of appearance in the book.



Art:   Chris Foss is at it again.  The cover pic actually looks very 
Traveller, but it is another one of Chris\' bulbous, blimp looking 
space craft dominating the scene.  I sure wish he would draw more 
Traveller looking ships.  At least I can accept this one as a lower 
tech (appropriate to M0) flying craft.  Besides the ship, though, 
the ground scene is extemely Traveller.

The back pick is another one of those domed cities on an asteroid 
pic.  It\' OK.  

Eventhough the outside on this supplement is acceptible, the inside 
is, for lack of a better term, crap.  There are 11 B&W ink sketches. 
 A couple of them look like Traveller, but there are two that are 
definitely Robotech (pg 14, pg. 35), one that is definitely D&D (pg. 
43), one that is definitely Car Wars (pg. 85), and one that is 
definitely Judge Dredd (pg. 76).  Of the other 6 remaining, there 
are only that are any good as Traveller pictures  (pg. 27; pg. 65; 
pg. 94). 	

IG has got to get another artist.



Layout:  As with most of the T4 supplements so far, the layout of the 
book is amateurish.  This ones seems more so than that the others.

I can\'t wait until IG hires that professional graphic designer.



Core Map:  This is another one of those minimal information maps that 
we are continuing to see in T4.  Man, I hate those.  I mean, why have 
a map at all if there is no information on it?  Just to show the 
players where the stars are located?

You can do that with the sector data.  If this trend is to continue, 
I suggest making everybody happy by doing one of two things.  Either 
print a complete map and a blank map for refs to photocopy and detail 
as they see fit (for thier players), or take one more page and print 
two maps--one for the players that only shows star locations, one for 
the referees with complete information.



Rumors:  There are 7 pages of rumors.  That\'s right--7 pages, two 
columns, gleaned from right here on the TML.

This is a total friggin waste of space.  I actually like rumors.  The 
add flavor to a compaign, but their right place is in an adventure 
module.  I don\'t know of too many GMs who would actually take these 
three or four lines and write an entire adventure from them.  Maybe 
one or two very, very, very creative GMs with nothing but time on 
their hands would do this, but I really doubt enough will to warrant 
the use of 7 pages in this book.  Bad decision--whoever made that 
one.

What I would have done with this space is one of two things.  I would 
have provided TNS news articles for use in campaigns (a much better 
idea than rumors), but that\'s only if this type of idea had to be in 
the book.

If I really had my way, I would have put some game rules specific to 
M0 here.  Above, I compared M0 to DGP\'s SOM.  One thing the SOM had 
that M0 doesn\'t is a couple pages of rules specific to the content of 
that supplement.

M0 does have a rule of two in amongst the pages, but there could have 
been more here.  What?  I dunno.  Maybe ship encounter tables 
specific to the Core sector or the Sylean system.  Maybe a map of 
Sylea.  Maybe rules for encountering specific types of races, or even 
a new alien race.  Maybe Imperial Navy hailing procedures.  Maybe a 
section of Imperial Naval, Marine, Scout, and Army equipment.  A 
drawing of a M0 soldier with the specific gear pointed out would be 
nice.  Maybe they could have given us never before seen information 
on starports.  Since a major mission of the 3I is expansion, 
detailing the major functions included in a starport, and rules for 
establishing starports, would have been a good use of the space.

The point is, a lot more relevant information could have been place 
on the 7 pages that the rumors took up.


What\'s missing in M0?  I expected to find a graphical representation, 
like the shaded maps in the MT Referee\'s guide showing the wars of 
the Imperium, printed inside M0 detailing the expansion of the new 
Third Imperium.  I would have liked 3-5 maps showing the different 
growth stages the Imperium goes through in between the year 0 and the 
year 200 when the next milieu starts.



Summary:
All in all, though, the M0 book is a good buy just because it 
contains so much information.  It is not a real gaming resource in 
that it has very few rules.  What it does have is tons and tons of 
background information on the M0 milieu.

How useable is this?  Well, I like reading Traveller background 
material, so for me, it\'s good stuff.  If you don\'t like reading 
Traveller history, politics, and Library data, then this book is 
definitely not for you because that\'s all M0 is--a very good book of 
3I background and history.

I very, very, VERY strongly doubt that Cleon is unambiguously a "good
guy."  People with enough ambition, willpower, and political smarts to
become emperors ruling billions of people are very seldom motivated only
by sweetness and light.  Men and women who get to the top are most
commonly driven by the simple desire for *power*, pure and simple, and
inevitably have to engage in some dirty deeds along the way, if only to
counteract dirtier ones by their opponents.

I cannot imagine that Cleon\'s assumption of autocratic power went
unprotested.  I am certain there were widespread demonstrations all over
Sylea and beyond -- especially at the universities -- decrying Cleon\'s
single-handed destruction of a fine republican tradition, and accusing him
of being a dictator and worse.  I\'m also quite sure that Cleon had his
security forces ready to contain any riots that started, using deadly
force if necessary.

We tend to forget that it\'s hard to judge how someone will be seen by
history from the viewpoint of the start of their career.  At the very
beginning, Hitler was an able, dynamic, passionately committed leader,
whose primary aim was Germany\'s economic and social recovery from the
chaos of reparations payments and ineffectual government (look up "Weimar
inflation", and find out why Hitler was welcomed with open arms).

On the other side of the equation, Lincoln, while running for President,
repeatedly reassured audiences that he entirely supported slavery, and had
no intention of pressing the South on this issue; this won him the
critical support of big business and the South.  When he went to war to
prevent the South\'s secession, he did so without a shred of Constitutional
support for doing so; after all, why shouldn\'t states be permitted
voluntary withdrawal from a voluntary federation?  This point was made
heatedly in Northern as well as Southern newspapers at the start of the
Civil War.

Needless to say, we now see Hitler as a villain, and Lincoln as a hero;
but in neither case could you tell which was coming from their origins.
We must, from the point of view of early Milieu 0, have the same
perspective on Cleon.

Paul, I thought that you might want to know that I have already tried 
this as KBv2.0, and it didn\'t work.  Doubling the skill gives you a 
target number way too high--espeically at the low end.

Ex--
You have skill-3 and Stat-7?  You think that you are pretty average, 
huh?  

Well, that would give you a target number of 13.  Easy rolls are 
100%.  Average rolls are 100%, and you are way above average for 
Difficult.

I\'ve already moved on to another idea for KBv2.0.  Results, so far 
are good, but I have to fix one snag.  I\'m close to posting what I\'ve 
got.

Ok, the additions:

1. The total cost is listed first with the discounted cost (if applicable)
in parenthesis following it.

2.  The Special Facilities (ie, Sick Bay, Science Lab, Mechanics Shop)
should also be in the area with the carried craft and such.  The tonnage per
unit is included afterwards.

3. Finally, the official addition of the design sequence.

Now, have some...

THUDDD Design Expectations and Standards:

The following issues have risen thus far, and more are sure to come up.
Check here often for the most current rulings. (Rulings on current 
issues will be posted to the TML as well.)

Required Crew:  When figuring the crew requirements for a ship, assume
the ship is operating at full level (See Economic Notes Below).  This 
means all positions necessary must be filled.  YOU MUST HAVE A SEPERATE 
PILOT AND ASTROGATOR FOR SHIPS WITH BOTH JUMP AND MANEUVER DRIVES.

Economic issues:  For ships that are designed for shipping or
transportation, the comments following the USP Notes MUST include a 
economic breakdown in the following format:

Notes:


All figures are to be calculated based on an annual period.  For the 
sake of simplicity, assume one standard trip takes 2 weeks, 12 months 
per year, and 52 weeks per year.  For income, assume 25 trips per 
year (one week is spent in annual maintenance).

Operating Levels:
  Full - As the name implies, this assumes a full cargo hold and full 
passenger register.  For the expenses, assume fuel is scooped (if ship
is equipped with purifier) and that berthing is only one week.
  Standard - This level assumes 80% of the cargo hold is full and 80%
booking for passengers.  For expenses, assume 5 trips the fuel must be 
purchased (if ship has purifier for the other trips) and that for 5 
trips, the berthing is one extra day (5 days total).
  Maintenance - This level assumes 20% of the cargo hold is full and 20%
booking for passengers.  For expenses, assume 20 trips the fuel must be
purchased (if ship has purifier for the other trips) and that for 20 
trips, the berthing is one extra day (20 days total).
  Special - If there is some optimized level for your vessel, then 
enter the figures here and explain the details of the level in the 
notes area.

Amounts:
  Down Payment: 20% of the discounted price is the down payment amount.
Down payments must also be paid for Subsidized starships.
Income:
  Cargo:  If A Broker/Trader position is included in the crew (as a 
permanent member of the crew) then use 2000Cr to reflect the advantage 
of speculative trading.  If only a Broker/Trader Salary is included 
(indicating a Broker/Trader hired at each world) then use 1500Cr to 
reflect the advantage of partial speculative trading (the lower amount 
is to reflect that the person at the selling world is different than 
the person at the buying world).  Finally, if no Broker/Trader
allowance is made, use 1000Cr for standard cargo rates.
  Passengers:  All passengers are allotted an amount of cargo space 
relevant to the type of passage they have purchased.  Lo passengers are
given 0.1 std of storage under their bunk.  Mid Passengers are given 
0.5 std of cargo area. Hi passengers are given 1.0 std of cargo area.  
Working passengers are allowed what room they have in their quarters 
or bunk.  The area for Hi and Mid passengers will need to be subtracted
from the total cargo volume before cargo income is computed.  Hi 
Passengers Pay 10,000Cr, Mid Passengers Pay 8,000, and Lo Passengers pay
1,000Cr.  Normally (passenger liners being the exception) a ship will 
not carry more than its displacement tonnage divided by 20 (Dt/20) 
passengers.
  Mail:  Only Subsidised Merchants are allowed to carry mail.  They 
must be armed, have a gunner as part of the crew, and allocat 5 std. 
for mail.  The payment for mail (regardless of the amount sent) is 
5,000Cr per std. or a total of 25,000Cr.  The payment is made regardless
of whether the mail is available or not.

Expenses:
  Payment: The standard ship payment is 1/240th of the ships discounted 
price per month.  The exception is for subsidized ships which pay half 
of their total income to the government that subsidized the vessel.
  Fuel:  The prices for fuel are standardized throughout the Imperium at
500Cr per std. for refined fuel and 100Cr per std. for unrefined fuel. 
Unless a ship is equipped with purification equipment, it MUST use 
refined fuel in order to get an Imperial Certification (and any ship
designed to carry passengers or cargo will need Imperial Certification
in order to get business).
  Life Support:  The cost for life support cleaning and restocking is 
2000Cr per occupied stateroom per trip and 100Cr per occupied lo berth 
per trip.  Double Occupancy requires twice this amount.
  Maintenance:  Annual maintenance costs are 0.1% of the purchase price
of the ship.  This includes the berthing costs for that week.
  Berthing:  Berthing costs are 100Cr for landing and six days stay and
100Cr for each additional day.  Each trip requires berthing fees for at
least six days.
  Salaries:  Crew salaries are paid per month.  Assume all crews are at
skill level-2.  Crew Salaries are as follows:
   Command         Leadership     -2     6,600Cr
   Pilot           Pilot          -2     6,600Cr
   Navigator       Astrogation    -2     5,500Cr
   Engineer        Engineer       -2     4,400Cr
   Sensors         Sensors        -2     3,300Cr
   Communicat.     Comm           -2     3,300Cr
   Broker          Broker         -2     3,300Cr
   Trader          Trader         -2     3,300Cr
   Medic           Medical        -2     2,200Cr
   Steward         ?Steward?      -2     2,200Cr
   Electronics     Electrician    -2     2,200Cr
   Maintenance     Mechanical     -2     2,200Cr
   Gunner          Gunner         -2     1,100Cr
   Screens         ScreenType     -2     1,100Cr
   Ship Troops     Weapon/Tactics -2     1,100Cr
  If a crew member is performing more than one Job, he will get paid at 
the higher of the two rates.  Ex:  Steward/Gunner will get 2,200Cr.


This information will eventually make it to the official THUDDD web pages at
my web site, but for now, cut it, print it, save it.  Also, this info is not
to be construed as a "new" economic rules set, these are simply assumptions
to make and standards to use to ensure that we are comparing apples with
apples in our ship design competition.  I will try to post a design using
the newer format and the Economic considerations later.

I agree, but yet humbly disagree.  It would seem to me that attracting 
both groups is in order here.  I would suggest a book along the lines of 
Vargr/Minor races of the Early Third Imperium.  I dont see the Aslan 
being someone to be dealt with ( I have yet to get hold of M:0 or FS, so 
maybe I\'m speaking from ignorance here ) at this time.  The minor races 
of this area are BEGGING to be dealt with.  At best on most of the races, 
we have a page or so from an old JTAS ( except of course the Geonee with 
their online sourcebook ( authors name and URL forgotten ) which is 
great ).  

The minor races cannot be found by the new player ( or the casual player 
for that matter.... have you ever tried going to a con and finding back 
issues of JTAS?  would you want a new player to try and do this? ).  How 
many new players know about Ael Yeal??

Further, this would increase the attractiveness of the product to us " 
older " ( hey I\'m 26 dammit ) players.  I have no real desire to buy a 
book with a retread ( or worse yet changes ) of the old material.  
However, a partial retread with expansion of the old JTAS minor races 
would be a treasure.

Just my opinion.... I could be wrong.

    'body' => 'Due to an overanxious PR intern, the previous posting of these designs went out 
before the jumpr drives had been upgraded to support the additional volume from 
carried small craft.  The following versions are correct, and as usual the 
costs do not include small craft.

In response to the recent Imperial RFP, "Armed Paramilitary Transport (Light)", 
Aurelian Industries submits the following tender:

Gladius-class Light Paramilitary Transport
This vessel is designed to transport a small force (up to 47 troops) into a 
potentially-hostile landing zone, either directly or via the carried 30-ton 
Ship\'s Boat.  The vessel is armed with an array of missile and laser weapons, 
allowing the ship to support a landing operation, defend a landing zone from 
approaching ground or aerospace forces, or even destroy light to moderate space 
defenses.  This vessel is also quite suitable as a exploration ship, allowing a 
group of trained scouts or observers to get into a dangerous area without 
needless risk.

The Gladius features a 10-ton minmal hangar deck for any vehicles used by the 
platoon, which doubles as a centralized meeting room for the troops and crew.  
There is also a machine shop to aid in the repair of the unit\'s vehicles, 
weapons or equipment after action, as well as a fully-equipped 2-bed sickbay.  
There are also five low berths to aid in getting seriously wounded troops to a 
proper hospital, or for securely transporting important prisoners.  In 
addition, there is more than 11 tons of cargo space available for carrying 
additional supplies.  To aid in long-range expeditions, the ship is equipped 
with fuel scoops, and carries an on-board fuel purifier capable of processing 
10 tons of fuel per hour, enough to fully process the total fuel allotment (ju
mp and power plant) in about 13 hours.

occupancy).  There is a Vehicle Shop, a Sickbay and a 10-ton Minimal Hangar for 
vehicles.  There is a streamlined 30-ton grapple for the Ship\'s Boat.  Jump 
drive size and fuel requirements were caluculated on a 700 ton hull, due to the

Also presented for comparison are the other two Paramilitary Starships 
available from Aurelian Industries.  While these are generally out of the price 
range of most start-up mercenary companies, they are very popular with some of 
the more well-established organizations,and even with some smaller new members 
of the Imperium looking to build up a military capacity beyond their planetary 
defense forces.


Claymore-class Medium Paramilitary Transport
This vessel, like the Gladius, is designed to transport a small force (up to 58 
troops) into a potentially-hostile landing zone, either directly or via the 
carried 50-ton Cutter.  This ship is a larger and upgunned version of the 
Gladius, with an upgraded sensor suite and twice the firepower of the Gladius.  

The Claymore features a 10-ton spacious hangar deck for any vehicles used by 
the platoon, which doubles as a centralized meeting room for the troops and 
crew.  There is also a machine shop to aid in the repair of the unit\'s 
vehicles, weapons or equipment after action, as well as a fully-equipped 2-bed 
sickbay.  There are also five low berths to aid in getting seriously wounded 
troops to a proper hospital, or for securely transporting important prisoners.  
In addition, there is more than 19 tons of cargo space available for carrying 
additional supplies.  To aid in long-range expeditions, the ship is equipped 
with fuel scoops, and carries an on-board fuel purifier capable of processing 
10 tons of fuel per hour, enough to fully process the total fuel allotment 
(jump and power plant) in about 22 hours.

ump drive size and fuel requirements were caluculated on a 1100 ton hull, due 
to the external craft.


Lochaber-class Heavy Paramilitary Transport
Designed for the large corporate security force or small government, the 
Lochaber is the powerhouse of the Paramilitary Transport line.  Displacing 
three times the volume of the Claymore, the Lochaber\'s armament is 
proportionally greater, and features a high-powered Particle Accelerator gun.  
This vessel is designed to transport a reinforced company of 230 troops, either 
directly or via its four carried 50-ton Cutters.  While larger and more heavily 
armored than its small cousins, the Lochaber is equipped with the latest in 
Sylean thruster technology, allowing it to reach the same speeds as the other 
vessels.  

The Lochaber features a 50-ton spacious hangar deck for any vehicles used by 
the unit, which doubles as a centralized meeting room for the troops and crew.  
There are also two machine shops to aid in the repair of the unit\'s vehicles, 
weapons or equipment after action, as well as a fully-equipped 4-bed sickbay.  
There are also ten low berths to aid in getting seriously wounded troops to a 
proper hospital, or for securely transporting important prisoners.  In 
addition, there is more than 140 tons of cargo space available for carrying 
additional supplies.  To aid in long-range expeditions, the ship is equipped 
with fuel scoops, and carries an on-board fuel purifier capable of processing 
50 tons of fuel per hour, enough to fully process the total fuel allotment 
(jump and power plant) in about 14 hours.

Actually it fits... well, not _perfectly_, but a lot better than any other
explanation I\'ve seen. There\'s one CT rule in particular which allows a
ship to charge it\'s capacitors with the energy absorbed by a black globe.
But the ship can only jump, even after its capacitors are fully charged,
if it has a full load of "fuel".

So apparently _none_ of it is used for power generation nor coolant, 
_Starship operator\'s Manual_ to the contrary notwithstanding. (Which is all 
to the good, because if it was used for power and coolant then there are 
several better ways to do it (You can, for example, carry more hydrogen as
water than as LHyd and you could use the oxygen for coolant to boot)).

And there\'s a perfectly good reason why it\'s called fuel: it can be used
interchangably as power plant fuel and "jumpspace entry mass". So people
tend to call it fuel. Only technicians and nitpickers call it entry mass.

Is the maximum acceleration of starships still limited to 6g as in CT?

Because of what? Lacking technology for anti-grav compensators to protect

Even the terran Space Shuttle crew must endure 6g, military fighter (jets)  
pilots about the same.

In the first CT book it is definitly noted, and even in the second book it

in addition I must guess the chapter names)

- - In the chapter \'characters\', \'the mission\' it\'s noted, that scout  
characters get one new skill per obtained promotion.

 - In the appendix for character generation every \'to-do-list\' for the  
generation reads:

        2) play mission
                a) survive?
                b) promotion
                c) skills check. Determine the skills for this check and/or
                   for being promoted.

- - In the last paragraph of \'characters\' a generation sample (the subengineer  
Theo Genisand) reads for example: \'Genisand has obtained three skills in his  
first year (for being promoted to M1, for the positiv skill check and for  
getting his commision to O0).

These three examples should show that your aren\'t correct, but indeed it\'s  
quite well hidden.

And traveller ships could do this as well, but only for similar

transient g-loads higher than comp by 6gs or so would be possible if
you had the drive to do it.

Is that true?  I thought no humans currently could function at more than
about 3g, even with a g-suit.  Anyone know for sure?

I don\'t know if this has been suggested, what about making the 50 ton and
100 ton bays in the design tables plug compatable with standardized 50 and
100 ton docking ring inserts?

This would be interesting - one or more source books detailing the campaigns
of conquest from the *other* side... Remember how cool it was to trash the
Imperium in GDW\'s old game of the same name?  After all, history is merely
what happened as retold by somebody with an ax to grind and all we\'ve read
so far has been written by Imperium historians...

Thanks for the in-depth review. I admit that when I perused M0 at a nearby
gaming store in Palo Alto and I was severely underwhelmed by the poor
formatting and layout. The interior art did little to win me over.

Since I was on my lunch hour, however, I didn\'t get the chance to really
read the darn book, so I couldn\'t judge the quality of the content. I was
ready to dismiss this as another shoddy product and move on, but you\'ve
sold me. I\'ll buy it based on content with the hope that future products
will show improvement in other areas.

Too bad my holdout for my beloved TNE game mechanics will go unrequited,
but I\'m willing to shell out my hard-earned cash for well-written
background material. What can I say? I\'m a Traveller-history-phile.

        In TNE and T4, there are no "arbitrary" limits on how fast anything
can accelerate, only what the crew can tolerate. Therefore, if you have a
10G drive, but only 6G compensation, if your crew can tolerate 4G, you\'re
fine. But they can\'t for very long.

        Certainly, for seconds (fighters), to tens of seconds (shuttle). But
not for extended periods of time. I have a reference at home somewhere which
gives various levels of acceleration and how long you can tolerate it.

Basically, I want to follow on from Doug\'s "Planetology 101."  He showed
us how to create a ball of rock with the right gravity, atmosphere,
temperature, and so forth; I\'m hoping to follow on with how to put in
consistent flora and fauna.  My major points will be:

- - What is life?
- - Where life comes from
- - The biosphere as a whole
- - Biomes (communities)
- - Creatures

Basically, a general-to-specific pass through the subject.  I\'m willing to
follow up on side topics and specific questions that come up at the time,
of course.  The overall goal is to convey how life both shapes and is
shaped by its planet, and how to make the life on your worlds consistent
and \'believable\'.

negative, except for a couple of quibbles.

First, he says it\'s "not really a gaming resource" because it doesn\'t have much
of any rules info, but I don\'t really agree with that (well, the former part,
the latter\'s a statement of fact) because of all the great adventure hooks.  I
have no doubt that if and when I run a Milieu 0 campaign I will use lots of
this stuff, much moreso than the SOM, which pretty much just sat and gathered
dust after I read through it.  Perhaps some more rules-y stuff would have been
appropriate, but I think that claiming it\'s not really a gaming resource is
going way too far.

Second, the rumors.  Yes, 7 pages was too much.  Yes, the space could have been
used much more effectively.  However, I was entertained by a lot of these and
if/when I run a Milieu 0 campaign I definitely plan to intersperse them
liberally with "real" rumors-- as background, curiosities, red herrings, and,
if the players actually decide to follow things up, maybe even real
(improvised) adventures.  Therefore, I don\'t consider it a total waste of
space, and I\'d even go so far as to say that I\'d like to see a "Rumors" section
in future issues of JTAS (about a half-dozen or so per issue, in addition to
more "official" TNS-type entries--but no more than a single page between them!)

Overall, though, a very fair and honest review with which I largely agree.

the most part I have been quite happy with the T4 products. But I have discovered
a problem with First Survey that, well, makes me a bit upset.

If someone else has discovered this problem and posted it, I apologize for
repeating the issue.

Open your copy of First Survey and look at the UWPs in the Referee\'s section.
Here\'s the first couple...

C474000-5
A8C3988-B
C356000-6
B541111-6
E864466-4
E879000-5
B354ACC-B

At first glance, no problem. But if you look close you can see that the government
and law level values (for the UWP impaired, the 6th and 7th values) are identical.
In fact, as near as I can tell, the government and law level values for every planet
in First Survey are identical.

Since government is 2D6-7+Population, and Law Level is 2D6-7+Government, it
would take a roll of 7 for every Law Level roll for this to happen. Which is effectively
impossible.

Thus, we either have a problem with the method the UWPs were made (I assume a
computer program) or a severe data-entry/editing problem.

In short, this makes First Survey of little practical use - this book of UWPs and
maps becomes a book of maps, for all intents and purposes.

I am not a businessman. I do not know what it would take for IG to fix this. And
like I said, I like IG...but this is a bit unacceptable.

Anyone else find this problem? Comments?

Put in my vote for Cordellia Naismith. HH and Friday may be able to mop
up the galaxy with the mother of Lord Miles Vorkosigan in a
fist/knife/gun/starship fight, but underestimating Cordellia is a _bad_
idea, as a certain Lord Vordarian found out :)

One of the best around here runs Werewolf. We\'re always arguing about
how much fun we could have if we were to play one another\'s game...but
she\'s a pagan Earth Mother who loves the spiritual element of _Werewolf:
The Apocalypse_, and I\'m more sf-oriented. One of these days....

Gotta agree with that...I thought that the two TNE novels were a big aid
in addressing this problem, since the protagonist was female, as were
most of the spacers aboard RCS _Hornet_.

In the Follies, one of the Emperor\'s major backers (and the "Big Noble")
is Duchess Mari Norstander, former SFN Captain and current First Space
Lord of the Imperium. The de-facto religious dictator of the world I
call "Stellis" is likewise female, as is one of the Ardin Empire\'s most
notorious privateers. There are lots and lots of less notorious female
NPCs serving as everything from scouts to Marines and nurses.

*I* say: AD ASTRA, ladies and gentlemen!

Those charter rules also appeared in the TNE rulebook and, so far as I
know, have remained consistent throughout all incarnations of Traveller
(except maybe T4 -- I don\'t own it and therefore can\'t say).  Of course,
you\'re probably jumping up and down right now, screaming "Yeah, but what
the heck ARE THEY??"  Here\'s what TNE said (page 224):

"Nonstarships charter for Cr1 per displacement ton per hour, usually with a
12-hour minimum.  Charter price for a starship is computed based on that
particular starship\'s revenue-generating capacity.  Starships are chartered
in two-week blocks; the charge for chartering a starship is Cr900 per ton
of cargo hold, plus Cr9000 per high passage berth and Cr900 per low passage
berth.  The owner of the starship being chartered pays all overhead
expenses and supplies a crew for the trip."

Since many in-system transfers are handled via jump drive (at least in TNE)
due to the time required to cross such distances in normal space (this may
have changed in T4 with the advent of reactionless thrusters which don\'t
require on-board reaction mass), which means that you will be tying the
ship up for the same amount of time that an interstellar trip would take. 
Since no distinction is made in price between interstellar jumps of
different length, it seems logical that in-system jumps wouldn\'t cost any
different, either.

Once again, reactionless thrusters change the dynamics, and thus the
economics, of this a little bit, so I\'ll have to defer to somebody who
actually owns (and uses) T4.

Well, that\'s a "drop of the hat" if I ever heard one :)

Patron 14753, Banker

You are approached by a well-groomed middle aged man dressed for business. 
He identifies himself as a banker with First Sylean, an important and well
known bank with branches throughout the Imperium.  He wishes you to
transport an Imperial Credit Transfer Pod to a branch of Solomani
Creditors Gmbh. on the next world in your itinerary.  He explains that
under normal circumstances such a credit transfer would be accompanied by
an agent of the bank, but that the local branch is having staffing
difficulties and they were unable to spare any of their personale.

The pod itself is a flat black computer with a prominently placed golden
Imperial sunburst and a set of standard data-ports.  The banker explains
that the pod uses a special set of encryption algorithms to electronically
transfer credits into and out of it\'s storage, allowing banks to move
funds securely from one planet to another.  Duplicate records of such
transfers are kept at the local offices of the Imperial Reserve Bank so
that in the event of the loss or destruction of a transfer pod the credits
can be reissued. 

1.  Everything is as explained, and the transfer occurs uneventfully.

2.  The man is in fact not an agent of the bank.  The Imperial Credit
Transfer Pod has been specially constructed to transfer a large number of
\'phantom\' credits into his own account at Solomani Creditors.  His forged
pod, however, is far from perfect and is quickly detected as false by
agents of the receiving bank.  The player characters are accused of
forgery!

3.  The man is an agent of the bank, as he represented.  However, a band
of pirates and/or ne\'er-do-wells have learned of this un-escorted funds
transfer and attempt to steal it from the players en-route to their
destination.

4.  Half way through Jump, someone notices that the Transfer Pod is
missing.  Who saw it last?  Did you forget to bring it on board?  Did one
of the passengers make off with it?  Clearly, this is best used if the
players fail to hide the unit, instead leaving it in a lounge, desk, or in
the Ship\'s Locker.

5.  A short time after the players have taken the pod into custody they
are approached by a man in a rumpled greatcoat.  He offers the players
MCr2 for "the item".  He will answer no questions about himself or his
intentions, simply repeating, "2 MCr.  Are you interested?"  He will
continue to hang around the PCs until their ship leaves port.

6.  Upon arriving at their destination world the players discover that
the last branch of Solomani Creditors on this world closed it\'s doors five
days ago.  No local representatives remain to collect the pod, and there
are no local branches of First Sylean to return it to.

Have you *really* looked over the tactics his so-called "School of
Contact" uses to bring planetary systems into the Imperial fold? This
guy deliberately _causes_ wars in order to loot a world\'s wealth while
spouting in Article One of the Warrant of Restoration that "the purpose
of the Imperium shall be...to bring the rule of law to the spaces
between worlds. No interference with local law or custom is
contemplated,
except where such local law or custom is in conflict with Imperial law."

In Cleon\'s eyes, "Even the negative aspects of war can be driven
beneficially" (see M0, page 17). Stage 4 of the Zhunastu School\'s
"Stages of Contact" goes on to state that "The only negative aspect of
war that has no benefits is population depletion."

In short, he does what\'s expedient to getting his way rather than what\'s
truly beneficial for everyone. Sorry, I\'m sticking with the Zhos.

So, run a campaign where Cleon fails in his unification campaign and the
3rd Imperium never forms.  The Sylean Federation could remain the strongest
state in the sector, but only be one of many political organizations
throughout...Known Space...I guess that\'s what we call it.

I\'ve been running all my campaigns in a non-Imperium universe for several
years, and I think I\'ll keep playing there.  The main protagonists in the
sector are The Confederated Stars of Argent (CSA), The Zeristu Empire, and
the borderland systems along Quental Main.

I *think* that was suggested as a joke, but I liked it then, still like it. 
<g> 

I\'m experimenting with all kinds of things.  

I\'m trying 6 skills / 4 year term rather than 4...but only rolled not
picked.  ;-> Increasing the number of skill chances helps offset the
characteristic advantage directly.

I\'m also tinkering with expanded skill tables (11 choices rather than 6)
using 2d6 for the rolls. I think one of the reasons skills get too high is
that there are too few of them to pick from.

Another idea I\'m playing with is setting up suites of skills for different
careers.  The PC\'s get the suite, and just the suite during their first
term or two.

And I\'m still using my Aptitude idea. ;->

Not when Average is 3d! 
                        
Task       Dice      Target:  13   
==========================================
Auto        1d       auto
Easy        2d      100% - SF(3%)  = 97%
Average     3d       84% - SF(7%)  = 77%

Actually, Impossible is just plain impossible, but I added it for kicks.  I
also changed Difficult to Hard, and Simple to Easy..just for kicks!  ;->

Seriously Ken, getting the skill levels up one way or another isn\'t a
problem.  It\'s the *low end* we have to worry about.  Take the PC with an
Attribute of 2 + Skill-1 = let\'s say 2 + (2*1) = 4...

              4
=========================              
Auto       67 - 0 = 67%
Easy       17 - 3 = 14%
Average    2 - 13 = Nope
Hard      0.1 - 20 = Ha!

Getting balance is a problem, as you can see, but to be frank I don\'t have
a problem with an Attribute 2 PC being a total yutz.  If he gets up to
skill 3 or 4 he can function adaquately in that area anyway.  With my
Aptitude idea the skill goes up on average by 2, and with a high Aptitude
it goes up by 3 each time!

  No, or the US *would* have.  The primary cause of premature death in
Native Americans between 1500 and 1900 wasn\'t whiteman\'s bullets--by far
and away the primary cause was disease.  It is estimated by reputable
scholars that as much as a quarter to a third of the native population
died in the first centuries after first contact from diseases ranging
from smallpox to whooping cough (these diseases were unknown to Native
Americans thus they had no immunity).  In some cases whole tribes were
wiped out (we know this because of the diaries of priests and
Conquistdors who noted that certain tribes disappeared).  Native
Americans do get one revenge though if I recall my history correctly:
they gave syphilis to Europeans in return. 

   In addition to disease, Native Americans killed each other too.  Wars
had taken place between native peoples for thousands of years prior to
the white man\'s arrival.  The colonial powers (Spain, France, Britain,
Holland, etc.) recognised this fact and created alliances with various
tribes to use them to fight rival powers and the rival powers\' tribal
allies.  One of the decisive factors in the French and Indian War (the
American name for the conflict, the European name is the Seven Years\'
War) was the fact that the British were able to recruit the Iroquois
Confederation (a power tribal alliance located in what is now northern
New York state) as allies.  With the muscule of the Iroquois behind
them, the British had a much easier time of it in the North American
interior and were able concentrate on taking Canada instead of worrying
about the frontier of their own colonies (incidentially, the Americans
were able to split the Iroquois Confederation during the American
Revolution and keep it from being a major factor during that war).  In
later history, we see that the Americans were very successful at
exploiting the rivalries between the various tribes, thus keeping them
from forming any kind of grand alliances against them.  This didn\'t stop
some trying however.  Tecumseh, a Shawnee chief of the latter 1700s and
early 1800s, was able to bring together an alliance of tribes that
ranged from Wisconsin to southern Georgia.  Only an pre-emptive attack
by American forces at Tippecanoe prevented the embryonic alliance from
becoming a serious threat.

   So what the hell does this have to do with Traveller?

   Substitute the Third Imperium for the Americans.  By exploiting
rivalries between various rival pocket empires, by negotiating treaties
with locals to secure economic and political gains in various regions
(securing some areas as "autonomous districts" under Imperial control if
necessary), only to break those treaties later if circumstances
warranted, and by open warfare to bring worlds into line, the Third
Imperium was able to bring under its boot heel a large chunk of the
space that was formerly occupied by the previous versions of the
Imperium.  While not always successful (the Julian War don\'t exactly go
as planned), the Third Imperium had by in large a very good run as
empires go.

   Of course the Fourth Imperium was able to surpass the Third in a
number of respects, but that\'s another story for another day.

   True, but I see no reason why an attractive woman can\'t run a
starship (the Vilani woman on the cover of V&V wasn\'t bad) or even rule
the Imperium.  No one says that attractiveness has to be a prerequisite,
it would just be nice to see more often.

   Well I\'m 33 years old, and pictures of silicone enhanced Barbie Dolls
*still* appeal to me (but then my gonads still work...a joke OK?).  Of
course if there\'s nothing but fluff for a game behind the Barbie Dolls
I\'m not interested in purchasing it either.

   Pictures of Pamela Anderson or Jenny McCarthy look alikes in
skin-tight jump suits on the covers of games *sells*.  Sells better than
Foss art, sells better than majestic landscapes with Traveller Correct
starships floating by in the distance.  Sells better than even cool
looking aliens.  While *we* won\'t buy a game on the basis of T&A
content, a lot of 13-20 year olds *would*.  Something to think about
when you are trying to rebuild the fan base of Traveller.

Yes, it\'s true -- but only for brief (< 1 minute) intervals.  Agile
fighters like the F-18 can routinely pull 9g turns, and pilots (in
g-suits, with lots of training) don\'t pass out.  No trained military pilot
would pass out in a 6g turn.  They\'d hardly even notice 3g.

There was a wonderful case a few years back (1990ish, I believe?) in which
a congressman was taken up for a ride aboard a Navy fighter, probably an
F14.  He persuaded the pilot to do some maneuvers...and promptly passed
out when the g-loads passed about 5.  The panic-stricken pilot immediately
made an emergency landing, fully expecting to be cashiered under the wrath
of an angry congressman.  The congressman, who\'d woken up on the way back
to the field, merely climbed shakily out of the plane, shook the pilots
hand, and said (with the press on hand) "It was clearly a case of a 6g
congressman in a 9g airplane."  Imagine the pilot\'s relief! :)

   I\'m afraid I tend to agree with Volker.  In fact I was about to
suggest a seperate TNE mailing list anyway for those of us who know the
ending of the movie "Third Imperium", and would like to discuss the
future of the Traveller universe from the year 1130 or so forward beyond
the premature end of the TNE storyline.  It would be a much more
productive forum without having to hear Yet Another Lecture on why Virus
sucks as a plot device, why the TNE game mechanics stink, why the
Reformation Coalition are Nazis, or why TNE isn\'t Traveller for the
umpteenth time.

   Is anyone else interested?  What would be involved in getting this
done?  I\'m not suggesting that people abandon this list, just something
additional for us heretics.

What\'s Hot by Mosaic Tapestry for the Smuggler News Report
Byline: Rotaer

I recently had the pleasure of a test run in the new maxThrust joyRider 
from the Space Vehicle Division of Worcester Yards on Rotaer. Quite a run 
it was too. This beauty, first out of the yard, was piloted by Sir Harry 
Worcester. Sir Harry is the acknowledged bastard son of the Right Honorable 
Bernard Lord Worcester, Baron of Rotaer. Sir Harry recently took possession 
of the first Sybarite class yacht from the Starship Division of Worcester 
Yards. A fine vessel in itself and the subject of my next report.

This twelve meter long power house is capable of moving 29 cubic meters of 
cargo to orbit, or safe jump range, at 6Gs of acceleration. Empty she can 
make 7.36Gs with no problem at all. Built for a crew of two and weighing in 
at just over 27 tonnes this one is a slick speed demon. At a cost of 
2,190,185 ImpCr every successful operation should be able to afford one. 
For those of you running the kind of operation that needs this speed the 
room in the hold this monster takes up might pay for itself in just a few 
good runs.

On my run Sir Harry\'s excellent piloting netted us a 20% improvement in 
flight time while wringing an additional 10% out of the thruster plate 
systems. The expected 2 hour 34 minute 41.5 second flight to 100 planetary 
diameters off Rotaer was cut to 1 hour 59 minutes 04.9 seconds. A savings 
of 35 minutes 36.6 seconds.

I\'ll be along on Sir Harry\'s next run so my next report will include notes 
on the maxThrust joyRider in action.

Thanks for the comments, Trent.  I think that we have a fundamental 
opinion difference here, and like you said, our opinions of M0 are 
pretty close except for a few quibbles.

Unlike you, I continue to use the SOM.  It has some great rules for 
detailing starship operations in the back of the book, and just about 
every time the players decide to do space operations, I refer to this 
book and its rules.

As far as the majority of the SOM, you are right.  It is great 
technical starship information, but once you read it, you\'ve pretty 
much got it down.  You only refer to the book for details from there 
on out.

M0 is exactly like this, except it doesn\'t have the rules to refer 
to.  Like you did with the SOM, I expect to read M0, enjoy the 
reading, and place the book with my other gameing stuff rarely to be 
opened again.

Oh, sure, I\'ll check for details here and there, but like the SOM, 
I\'ll use M0 as an encyclopedic reference after the initial reading.  
I may refer to it while creating a campaign or adventure, but I don\'t 
think the book will have a major impact on the play of the game the 
way the SOM did.

That\'s what I mean when I say I consider a good book--but for 
Traveller history, not as a gaming resource.

I agree.  As I said in my review, I like rumors.  I just didn\'t think 
that the place for them was in the M0 book.  That 7 pages could have 
been used much more effectivly for something else.

In the review, I said that the proper place for rumors is adventure 
modules.  You suggest that the JTAS is a good place.  I couldn\'t 
agree more.  Adventures and magazines is where these things should 
be--not taking up valuable space in the campaign supplement.

Thanks, Trent.  And I want to add that, although Trent and I are 
talking about what I consider some of the negatives of M0, I do 
recommend the book.  What you get by far out weighs what you don\'t 
get.

I\'ve always liked your aptitude idea.  I even played with it before

There are two reasons why I didn\'t use it in my task system fix.
One is that it added a lot of complexity to a very simple task 
system.  I wanted to keep that simplicity.  

The second reason is that the idea strays too far, in my book, away 
from the T4 rules as written.  I keep saying that I want minimal rule 
fixes, and that those fixes should be simple and as close to the 
original rule as possible.

If Marc was convinced and decided to incorporate aptitudes as even an 
optional rule for T4, I\'d take a much closer look at it.

I don\'t want to be playing a unique system that only I, and maybe a 
few other people here on the TML, are using.  Like Glenn Grant\'s D66 
system.  I didn\'t even look at that closely because I know that it is 
not what I want.  It is just too far away from the T4 rules.

I may appreciate your hereticness, and even admire it, but I like my 
games to be close to the real thing.

Yeah, Eris, I tried this too.  But the double skill + stat method is 
not giving enough good numbers across the board in all difficulties.

I usually start with an average character when I test a task system.  
If I like those numbers, I test a very weak character and a very 
strong character.

If both of those give good numbers too (which is usually not the 
case--either the low end or the high end usually give me 
problems--Damn those 6 sided dice), I\'ll test random combinations of 
skill and attribute to see if they make sense.

I am on to a very good idea right now, but I\'m having trouble with 
the low end.  The target numbers are high enough to give me good 
percentages at the high end, but the low end is way too easy.

It is a heck of a delimma, and it is going to be difficult to beat 
KBv1.1.

That system had some awkward math, but the number always turned out 
great.

We are trying to have our cake and eat it too with a task system, 
based on 6 sided die, that will give us good numbers and be truly 
simple to play.

What I want is the numbers involved in KBv1.1, the simplicity of just 
adding two numbers together to get the target number like in T4, and 
to use just whole die in the difficulty system.

THAT is a tall order.  I\'m happy to say that I am very close to an 
answer, but I\'ve got to lick this low end problem.

   Maybe you\'re the correct person to answer this question: I have
noticed that among the white dwarfs we can detect out to 50 ly, that the
*vast* majority are either DA type or DK type.  Is this because of some
freak occurance (just a really bad sample in the local area), or is it
because those kind of white dwarfs have the most common composition
(which would mean the white dwarfs we can see are actually a good
representation of the population at large)?

   OK, let me restate my position.  I am talking here about a main
sequence star starting to exit the main sequence (running out of
hydrogen) and a brown dwarf in orbit 0.  As the main sequence star
begins to expand, wouldn\'t the temperatures and gravity still be
significant enough at orbit 0 to severely damage or destroy a brown
dwarf?  I understand that this would not be the case at orbit 4 or
beyond, and may not be the case at orbit 3 (depending on the mass of the
star).

   I think this is what I was trying to get at.

far-away...)

  I wasn\'t aware that common-envelope binaries could evolve in such a
fashion.  My understanding was that once two stars merged, their cores
eventually ending up in very close orbit of each other.  Then again we
are talking about a brown dwarf, not another star.

>Finally, the transition from red giant to white dwarf isn\'t violent in

   Violent is a relative term.  What wouldn\'t disturb a star-sized mass
all that much might be devastating to something 2 to 80 Jupiter masses,
particularly in a close orbit.  That was my assumption though certainly
I\'d listen to someone such as yourself who had a different opinion and
has worked out the mathemathics of it all.

>I have no idea why you think the brown dwarf will keep spiralling in once

   I was working from the theory that the brown dwarf was gradually
losing angular momentum, and thus would eventually spiral in in a
similar fashion to a white dwarf binary pair).  Assuming that at some
point things were to stabilize, then you are right.

I can\'t tell which pictures are Ashe\'s and which are Chris\', but I 
detailed in my review which ones I thought were Traveller like.

I can see Chris\' boxed "F" on some of the interior illos, but some 
have been cropped too close to see the authors\' name.

Whatever the case, I only liked 3 of the 11 interior illos, and my 
review of that work stands, whoever did the art.

I just want good Traveller pictures in my game material.  I don\'t

   But 51 Peg is a G main sequence star, not a white dwarf.  The planet
in question could have also theoretically just been "born" there right
where it is today.  If so, what we think we know about how solar systems
are formed could be wrong.

   Having not been there to see how the 51 Peg system evolved, we may
never have the right answer.  If the theory about it forming in its
existing orbit is correct, then it won\'t be plunging into the star
anytime soon.

>Personally, I think the theorists like coming up with theories to fit

   Anyone attempting to create charts to generate star systems for
Traveller is coming up with a theory to fit an incomplete data set.  You
know you could be proven wrong with the next Hubble observation, but
something has to be done.

   And besides, if the theorists didn\'t come up with all those neat
theories, what would they do at all those conventions (I mean besides
what they usually do)?  :-)

Yes. I play my M0-Campaign (soon to read on Goerans Page) in a Milieu of
blooming secret services (and/or military intelligence), which is up to
treading out any glow of conspiracy by all means. They serve as
"guardians" of the expansion of the 3rd I. They try to consolidate the
reign of the Imperium in the newly conquered regions.

Nope! The planet would not likely have *formed* as an iceball. And it\'d
have taken a long, long, time to cool down. Consider that Europa(?) is
likely mostly ocean under the ice layer.

So life had a long time to evolve with liquid water, and a long time to
adapt to the cold. Red dwarfs have *enormous* lifetimes. So the
"antifreeze" scenario is not at all far fetched.

Alcohol is too good an energy source. *Something* would have evolved to
"eat" it.

I\'d be rather surprised to find inertial compensators in anything short

Remember, they are limited to *6* g. That\'s *nothing* when you are

Hit someone in battledress with a 75 mm shell and even if it doesn\'t

Except they wouldn\'t. Try getting bananas to grow in the temperate

That wouldn\'t necessarily be a "simple" job. Besides the plants being a
major fire hazard, the alcohol concentration would tend to be a lot
lower, as the higher temps (and higher atmospheric moisture levels)
will tend to cause absorption of water from the air. Taste and texture
will be a problem too. And at higher temperatures you may have to
radically re-engineer large portions of the plants metabolism to to
temperature effects on various enzymes.

It\'d be cheaper to just grow them where the climate is suitable. Or, in
some places, to use special "icehouses" the way we use greenhouses.

Ain\'t gonna happen. As a rough rule of thumb, c = 1 g for 1 year. So so
to reach 10% of c, you have to accelerate at 1 g for 37 days, 2 g for
18 days, 3 g for 12 days, 4 g for 9 days, 5 g for 7 days, or 6 g for 6
days.

So for a boost to 10% of c (nowhere near relativistic):

g	t	d (AU)
- --	----	----
1	34d 17h	300
2	17d  9h	150
3	11d 14h	100
4	 8d 16h	 75
5	 6d 23h	 60
6	 5d 19h	 50

Pluto is about 36 AU out....

So even at 6g, you\'d have to flip over and start decelerating long
before reaching 10% of c. And since you were accelerating, that means
that the *average* time dilation is far less than the *peak* dilation
(I have the formulas somewhere, but since the peak value is .99498...
why bother?)

I rather expected these results before I even started, as Heinlein in
"Have Spacesuit, Will Travel" had the bad guys make a run out to Pluto
at 8 g, and only take about a week.

        Gawd.... that\'s a real problem. The easiest way to make the data
still usable is to consider that Law level is the most volatile of the UWP
stats and so assume that the Scouts just didn\'t recorded it. So, we will
have to reroll when using a specific area of space. Fortunately, the reroll
isn\'t complicated, but it destroys all possibility of *canon* Law levels...
too bad.

There is already at TNE mailing list, it gets very little traffic.  I
think the last message was several weeks ago.  I think most of the
discussions on TNE take place here on the TML.  You could bring a
discussion there. I\'d be interested in hearing what you have to say.  

The list is run by listproc@tower.clark.net
I think you can subscribe by sending a subscribe message to the
address. The mailing address of the list is  tne-rces@tower.clark.net

If that doesn\'t work let me know, and I\'ll figure out how I subscribed to it. :)

You fool!  You\'ve succumbed to the evil propoganda of the enemies of the 
Imperium!  Cleon has only the best interests of every member of the 
Imperium at heart.  To him, honor is everything.  Don\'t believe the 
dishonorable lies you hear about him.  The nobles who were supposedly 
"silenced" have, in fact, simply left Imperial space of their own accord, 
since they were not equipped to deal with the new, honor-based system of 
government.

Of course, the Imperium needs every able-bodied being it can get.  But if 
you\'re like the dishonorable nobles who fled for the outback, you\'re 
welcome to join them.

Harold, I would not like to see another list-split. The last one was born
out of intolerance, and I think intolerance should be fought, not
surrendered to. TNE is part of Traveller just like any other part and should
be able to be freely discussed on this list. CT and MT are no longer the
"official" versions of Traveller, but they are discussed here. TNE should be
too. In fact, I would go so far as to say that if TNE is banned from this
list or if intolerant nastiness continues when it is discussed, then Classic
Traveller and MegaTraveller should be similarly banned; they aren\'t the
"official" version of Traveller anymore either. I would not like to see this
happen, so I hope people will develop more tolerance. I myself do not use
the TNE rules anymore, preferring the simplicity of T4, but I fully intend
when I get the chance to continue my RCES campaign.

Definitely - you don\'t get to be Emperor without breaking some
eggs - and heads (and hearts, and businesses, and lives).  I\'m sure
that there will be no shortage of people in M0 who can come up with
good reasons why the Third Imperium and its Emperor are definitely
an Evil.

It\'s worth noting that the official state song of Maryland contains a line
that refers to Lincoln as "the despot".

Not only will there be differences of opinion regarding Cleon, but those
differences may be deep and long-lasting.  Encourage your players to be
open-minded, and perhaps (as referee) show them both sides of the coin.

Even if Cleon is honestly trying to better everyone\'s lot at the same time
he grabs the throne for himself, not everyone working for him may hold to
the same ideals.  If Cleon is (and he may well be) honest in wanting to
improve conditions for all his subjects; these people will eventually be
rooted out; but a few highly-placed Bad Eggs can make life miserable for
millions of people - and an entire campaign can be centered around obtaining
proof of someone\'s misdeeds, and getting the appropriate people to pay
attention to it.

While we\'re talking about Cleon and Evil Emperors, don\'t forget that _other_
emperor Cleon, Cleon II.  Yes; I mean Cleon the Mad; hopefully more
information will turn up about him in M200 (Porifia shot Cleon II in 245,
which puts him firmly in M200).  For background reading, I suggest some
of the books I read for my Roman History class back in college.

        This is a great idea. IIRC, DGP covered Vilani, Solomani, Vargr, and
Aslan. The old Alien modules covered much more, but I\'ve never seen them and
I am under the impression that apart from TMLers, nobody has access to them.
So any supplement covering just two of those four races is not going to
appeal the majority of old timers, and yet they are precisely the four most
important races in the Traveller universe. But, apart from specific examples
like the Darrian, minor races have never been covered in specific supplements. 
        Ellaborating on your proposal, I would suggest books with one major
race and one or two minor races. 
        Nevertheless, which minor races can be paired with which major
races? Forgetting about the specific details of M:0 (when Vilani are not
mentioned because everybody is Vilani, and many races are unheard of), there
are some minor races that could be treated in sourcebooks that also covered
a specific major race. For example:

        Answerin: they are in Vland sector, so pair them with the Vilani.
        Vegans: they are in the Solomani Rim, so put them with the Solomani.
        Hhkar: they are surronded by Vargr, so it\'s obvious...

        But we should focus on M:0 - relevant races at the moment, right?
And, since the focus of M:0 is the "central" area of the imperium, there are
specific races that are becoming of key importance. Marc has recently stated
that the Suerrat and the Geonee are being considered as major players for
game purposes... so maybe it would be good to make a Vargr/ Geonee & Suerrat
supplement, each race taking 1/2,1/4,1/4 of the book.

        Thanks!. I\'m glad you like it. I am the author, Scott is the
archivist, and the URL address is (now that you give me the opportunity to
post it again ;-) http://members.aol.com/sgalli5794/traveller/geonee/index.html
        It is going to be updated soon.
        I continue to develop materials on the Geonee (the ones on the
online sourcebook are, of course, summaries), and I will be obviously very
much interested in seeing them appear on an Alien sourcebook (I am
volunteering, of course!). For the moment being, I am writing a short
article that I will submit to JTAS.

To be quite frank, the book\'s a disgrace. The maps are completely unusable.
Whatever happened to the CT/MT/TNE map style, complete with names, symbols
and xboat/xweb routes? I have the old DGP software on my Mac at home and
can generate excellent-looking maps for myself. Why couldn\'t IG do it?

Has their operation been reduced to a shoestring?

Terran organisms adapt from their warm and fuzzy beginnings be it in the
oceans or mud or whatever. If the planet was really cold to start with the
antifreeze HAD to be in the water from the start, otherwise no primitive
organisms could have started being waterbased. Remember that the
environment on a planet has to fit life BEFORE life starts to adapt to
extremes of environment.
As an anology just because we find some organims from Earth that can
survive and reproduce on Mars doesn\'t mean life can start on Mars.

   Heh. Have you noticed yet how Cleon\'s political critics seem to die

   that the Zho\'s are any better whatsoever, IMHO.

   The empire in M0 seems every bit as evil as the empire in M1100, as

   adventure sessions in M0 as in M1100. Remember, in M0, those Syleans
   are in search of lebensraum. "Long live the Thousand-Year Third

   Speaking of which... I haven\'t read M0 completely yet. Has anyone
   noticed any hints of genocidal (or xenocidal) activity yet? (I know
   about the Controlled in AA of course.)

In solar system terms (very roughly - I don\'t have the exact orbits)

- -if the brown dwarf stars where Mercury is (orbit 0, I guess) it may well
spiral in so far it hits the core and gets eaten

- -if the brown dwarf starts where Venus is (orbit 1? 2?) it will spiral in,
but not hit the core before the red giant phase is over. After the red giant
has lost its atmosphere the brown dwarf will be happily orbiting around
orbit 0 or so. 

if the brown dwarf stars where Mars is it will spiral out as the red
giant loses mass and end up around Saturn or so.

So, the net result is that (for the right initial conditions) you can end 
up with a brown dwarf in a close orbit around a white dwarf star. It\'s
actually a pretty broad range of initial conditions, because the "spiralling"
is a very slow process.

The process of the red giant losing its atmosphere really is pretty gentle;
the red giant atmosphere is nearly vacuum, and the brown dwarf is 
*extremely* dense - if it doesn\'t hit the core, it\'ll survive.
("Gentle" means winds of thousands of km/s, but the density is so low that
it can\'t possibly affect something as solid as a brown dwarf.)

The so called snub pistol was developed during the Civil war for shipboard
use. Prior to the war there wasn\'t much need for such weaponry as shipboard
combat rarely took place.

<handwaving mode on>
About one in every 100 shots actually hit but the lobe (speaking in
electric engineering terms) of the laser makes it fairly easy to detect
that someone is shooting at you and from where before any shots hit. My
ruling on sandcasters is that you cannot shoot back at the enemy you\'re
protecting yourself from but others are OK. As a matter of fact, you cannot
even track the enemy with your sensors while the sandcasters are working.

It\'s not (entirely) true.  The confusion here is in the distinction between
constant G-forces and instantaneous G-forces.  Yes, fighter pilots must
learn to deal with extremely high g-forces, often as high as 7 to 9 gees. 
However, forces this high are only ever encountered in extremely high-g
combat maneuvers, and never for more than a few seconds at a time.  The
G-forces endured by shuttle crews at liftoff are not usually higher than 2
to 3 gees, and this can be tolerated for longer periods.  Although liftoff
forces for the crews usually last for only a few minutes.

        In my campaigns, debit cards containing money also play a role, but
it is rather limited for several reasons: for instance, the number of people
that regularly travel to places they have never been before is minimal,
regardless of the fact that the PCs are almost always among them... so, why
would banks make life so easy to these travellers, specially when they are
rarely good customers? OTOH, it would be rather risky to carry large amounts
of money which are physically on one small debit card... On the third hand
<G>, low-tech worlds will not be prepared to handle debit cards properly,
and sometimes you wnat to travel to them...

        I assume that there are several types of banks, ranging from
one-world-only banks to Bank Hortalez et Cie (Imperium-wide). In order to
avoid carrying large amounts of money, I assume that large banks have
developed appropiate systems for good customers. Let me describe the one
used by Bank Hortalez et cie, and that my players have used from time to time.

        1) A loyal customer goes to his local office, where he has a (large)
amount of money, and says that he wants to securely transfer a quantity X.
Say X=100,000 Cr. He is travelling to some world, but is not sure if he is
using the money in this world, or in another, or if he would change his
mind... he wants the benefits of a debit card, but does not want to risk the
possibility of it being stolen.

        2) He decides a "distance" for the money, that is locally defined
depending on the typical travel times, etc. Roughly:

        Distance A.......... up to 3 parsecs
        Distance B.......... up to 8 parsecs
        Distance C.......... up to 40 parsecs

        3) The bank issues a check or set of checks for X=100,000 Cr. The
money at the local bank (the real 100,000 Cr.) are blocked for...

        Distance A.......... 8 weeks
        Distance B.......... 20 weeks
        Distance C.......... 100 weeks

        The checks (identified with the character\'s ID, fingerprints,
retinal scan, whatever) are stamped with the coresponding expiry date.

        4) The bank charges some cost, based on the amount X.

        Distance A........... 1%
        Distance B........... 2%
        Distance C........... 4%

        4) The customer travels around and can freely convert the checks
into money in any Hortalez et Cie bank during

        Distance A........... 6 weeks
        Distance B........... 16 weeks
        Distance C........... 80 weeks

 the specified time, and in the specified area. When he does so, the bank
where he does the change sends the info to the original one. The difference
between the blocking time and the disposal time makes it possible to avoid
risks on the part of the bank.

        5) The blocking time ends, the remaining checks become invalid and
the original bank sums up the received checks and substracts them from the
100,000 Cr. The remaining Cr. are de-blocked.

        And that\'s it. This system can have problems, but not more than the
usual ones... my players used it in some campaigns, and were never tempted
to do obscure maneuvers...

        Btw, Wildstar, are we two the only Matsumoto fans around here, or
there are more? ;-)

WOW! Could you plase post it to the list. Most assumptions made on
G-tolerance is related to fighter pilots and NASA guys ie short time
periods. The organs in the body due to different densities will start to
move around for instance which may be dangerous.

   I disagree; intolerance was not the mother of the xboat list. The TML
   never once discouraged or banned discussion of CT. Xboat merely
   created a channel where the signal-to-noise ratio of usable CT
   information could remain at pre-TNE levels; to do this, it was
   necessary to make a separate list.

   Hmm. Maybe I\'m missing something, but I haven\'t noticed any move to
   ban anything from this list except D&D and political weenie waving.
   And this attempt at censorship wasn\'t motivated by any anti-D&D
   intolerance or by any desire to stifle political discourse. It was
   merely an attempt to keep the Traveller signal coming in clear.

   If I missed something, and there have been attempts to ban TNE from
   the list (I confess ---- I don\'t read all the messages), then I agree
   with you. Otherwise, I think you are attacking a straw man.

   If TNE players want to have their own list in addition to the TML,
   then I don\'t think they should be prevented from making it. I enjoyed
   having the xboat around in the TNE days, and I wouldn\'t deny anyone a
   similar luxury. Not that I\'m lobbying for the creation of such a
   list. I probably would not subscribe to it if it were created, but I
   won\'t lobby against it either.

First off, the DGP modules expanded on what was presented in the 
Alien modules.  By design, there isn\'t much over lap there.  Consider 
the GDW modules an introduction to the race, then consider the DGP 
modules as expanded information on those aliens.

As far as locating them, they are hard to find, but I do run across 
them.  About two months ago, I was at a game store that has some used 
games and ran across near mint copies of Aslan  and the Vargr alien 
modules.  I bought those for one of my players.

I can keep my eye out if you like.  If you let me know, I\'ll contact 
you if I find more copies of any of the GDW alien modules.

   I rarely see the DGP modules around anymore, but I do see the TNE
   modules quite frequently (the one on the Hivers). Are these any good?
   The CT Hiver module left me wanting more...

Have been a CT fan - player - referee since 1977.

Some thoughts on several of the flowing topics...

CANON --  I don\'t follow what the Pope says, so why should
I follow what the rule books say?  They\'re just guidelines.
Players and I have always had fun bending, molding, shaping
the rules to suit our vision of the universe.  Why should I
change now?  Our only limits are our imaginations.  Wasn\'t
there a famous Terran cadet that changed the "rules" to win
a Starfleet Exercise?

MOUSETRAPS -- that\'s what I think of the T4 refinements(?) to
weapons\' damage.  Keep the rules simple.  Emphasize role
playing.  Realism is for Wargamers (and I\'m one of those,
also).  IMO, the best combat system came out of Ashanti High
Lightning.  Roll to hit, roll to kill.  Quick and dirty,
then move on to role playing.

FEMALE PCs -- the best _role_player_ I met and interacted
with was female.  Role playing was more important to her
than combat.  Most young male gamers tend towards the
"Drunk Grunt" syndrome.  I\'ve always discouraged this MO
and required finesse and quality role playing.  This
player\'s character eventually went on to form her own
mercenary company that built its own Billion Credit
Squadron....after five years of full weekend role
playing.  Okay, maybe I was a little to easy a referee.
I made a few major OOPS! in there somewhere.

As I recall, when I first started with CT, the group
I was with in North Dakota was 50/50 male to female.
Many gamers were husband and wife teams.  And because
of this, my wife even became involved in RPGing.

In response to Wes Payne and the 800T Merc Cruiser.

We solved the cutter problem because we felt the
800T MC was too small for its own good.  We upgraded
to a 1000T High Guard design using two 50T cutters,
adding two additional LSP modules for the cutters
and made them a side to side, slide-in//slide-out design.

Like Wes says,
you need to launch the cutters before a surface landing.
This is just good operating practice and smart to
provide the landing operation a HighGuard.  Proper 
mission planning is critical.  Launching the cutters
after just entering a system may be neccesary, if
not required.

I dissagree.  The basic building blocks of life are common, and it
appears that even in the most hostile of enviroments, the chemistry will
occur.  If any sort of life appears on the scene, the first thing that
will happen is that 1) it will change itself to suit it\'s surroundings
better 2) it will change it\'s surroundings to suit itself better.

Take the fact that we breathe oxygen, a chemical that will rapidly
combine with other elements to form oxides.  So where\'d the oxygen come
from -- it started out as a byproduct of ancient life (blue-green
algae).  Oxygen is not a great chemical for life to have in it\'s
enviroment, so more modern critters fumbled around and found ways to use
it (aerobic organisms).  

I could see a scenario where our future \'150-proof raspberries\' had
ancestors that existed near thermal vents on the bottom of our planet\'s
ancient slushy oceans.  Converting rock to methane (liberating Carbon
from the rocks and Hydrogen from the water) would have provided an
excellent source of energy (food).

Also the released Oxygen would have provided more energy in the
enviroment (aerobic life).  Forms of life would have evolved to produce
a natural antifreeze (CH3CH2OH -- ethyl alcohol), while others (using
this revolutionary antifreeze) migrated up to seek the dim light from
the stellar primary.

Already you see the possibilities for a very diverse, complex ecosystem.
 Critters eat rock, produce hydrocarbons and O2.  Others eat
hydrocarbons, O2 and excrete (or produce) antifreeze.  Some critters
absorb the antifreeze others produce and store it.  Still others use
photosynthesis to live, but need the antifreeze to survive.

A scout survey might be very suprised to find an actual liquid ocean
under the ice _because_ of native life.

Most life would be small (bacteria, algae, plankton) and would be a
source of food for larger critters.  Larger producers (plants) would
take advantage of any niches they could.

Mars is an odd case.  Life probably never had the chance to radically
alter the enviroment enough to survive.

the Sourcebook yet until the last day or so.  So the more recent stuff

evening.

The new stuff going up is:

The Milieu Zero pocket empire
Geonee starship construction philosophy
QSDS 1.5 version of a Geonee free trader
The updated Geonee timeline

Carlos has been nice enough to let me put the stuff here and start
creating stuff for the page.  I\'m the creator of the free trader.  Some
of my plans (which I hope I can work on in the near future) are:

- - Subsector maps for the two sectors where the Geonoee worlds are located
for each era.  First one I plan to concentrate on is Milieu Zero, of
course.
- - Deckplans for the free trader
- - Designs for a Geonee patrol cruiser and a Geonee science vessel/scout.
- - Deckplans for the above ships

I also plan to move the sourcebook to its own web address on my AOL
account.  I\'ll let you know when that will occur.

Of course, all these will be approved by Carlos first (before I make them
public).

The only problem right now is that the pages are kinda drab.  I need some
artwork, preferrably centered on the Geonee and/or Massilia.  Anyone has
any or is interested in doing something, please let Carlos or me know.

Any comments on the physical layout on the sourcebook should be sent to
me.   Comments on the actual content (except for the free trader) should
be sent to Carlos since he\'s done 96% of the work there (I\'m only the guy
that puts it in HTML).

I agree, Allan, so I hope you take this comment as a tolerant criticism of
the T4 rules, but I think T4 and "simplicity" are oxymorons. The intent was
simplicity, but the result was a task system of dubious results that has
resulted in more complex debates than I ever saw in a discussion of TNE
ship design rules!

I do see your point, though. I\'d like to be able to discuss TNE stuff and

it\'s so simple and self-evident...so the temp stuff takes the 
brunt of suspicion.
<sinbadsam> The temp calc may not prperly take into account for 
the heat sink effects of large bodies of water

later than 5:45 at the outside, and likely could make 5:30.  Just wanted to
warn of the chance.
> Just as long as we\'re done before Babylon 5 starts
<BRuadh> speaking of which.
* Craig laughs! "Gotta keep your priorities straight. :)"
<Craig> I\'m missing The Simpsons for this.  *Two* of \'em.  I 
hope you\'re impressed, Doug.
* Craig grins.
> C\'mon.. Bart vs. Me?  No contest!
<SuzD> Ok, I\'ll list it as 5:30 pacific, and if you\'re late, no 
biggie.
<Craig> Yeah, how can you tell \'em apart? :)
> My haircuts were much worse
* SuzD ducks into a corner
<Craig> Coolness.  This\'ll be fun.  Then after that somebody 
can do society building.  It makes a natural sequence.
<SuzD> yeah.
* Craig considers, nods. "Not much. But worse."
<SuzD> I\'ll have to work on that one.
> We touched on society building a few weeks back, but it 
wasn\'t that deep
<SuzD> I won\'t be here the last week of march
<Craig> As in you giving it?  Coolness!
<SuzD> out of town on business
<SuzD> um, no, I meant on finding someone to give it.
<Craig> What was the topic at the time?
<SuzD> I did Play by IRC <G>
<Craig> Ah.  Delegation.  You a manager? :)
<SuzD> yup
<SuzD> and Den Mother <G>
<Craig> I *knew* it!
* Craig grins...good combo.
> "planet Building"  tried to cover too much aream which is why 
i did tonight.. just focus on the physical aspects of a world
<SuzD> I kind of got side-stepped into it.
<SuzD> right.
<Craig> Have any sustained pbem or pbirc games come out of 
this?
<SuzD> can\'t cover too much
<SuzD> yes.
<SuzD> TLWH is on Wed nights
> You saw that TLWH got reviewed in Arcane?
<SuzD> Stu\'s Reaver\'s Deep game has been postponed a couple of 
weeks because of CORE commitments, but the players keep 
clamoring for more
<Craig> Oh, that started here?  I didn\'t know.  Guess I need to 
read more carefully.  Except for the task-system posts. :)
<SuzD> Afaik, Twolf\'s game on Mondays is still going
<BRuadh> yes it is.
<SuzD> I started my PBeM game only with people I dragged in off 
of here, or by recommendation from people here
<grayman> Yes it is and those crooks are toast when I get to 
them
<SuzD> I hear they got off with a rather large chunk o change, 
grayman <G>
<BRuadh> Stand in line, Greyman!
> still prefer ftf gaming
<grayman> Yea but we know were they are I think
<Craig> Otherwise, you have to order *so many* pizzas...
<SuzD> Maybe when the kids get older, I\'ll be able to do that 
again
* SuzD looks wistful
<SuzD> I like PBeM
<SuzD> Its convenient
*** james14 (twolf@pm3-p15.tfs.net) has joined #traveller
<Craig> Hey, Doug, you won the three bonus points! (Just got 
TML digest)
*** james14 (twolf@pm3-p15.tfs.net) has left #traveller
<SuzD> you don\'t have to worry about schedule conflicts
* Craig . o O (Guess James14 didn\'t like it here...)
<SuzD> and you can get really detailed with character 
development
> yeah, but it\'s the contact with other people that makes 
gaming for me
<grayman> That is true Suz 
<SuzD> I think he was looking for his dad
<SuzD> Doug, what do you think I live online for?
* Craig grins...reminds me of an old Dixieland song.
<SuzD> can\'t get out, so here I am <G>
<SuzD> its a sad existence, but its better than nothing :-)
<Craig> Suz, how old is/are your kid(s)?
> For me these days, it\'s the same thing.. I\'m either 
contagious, drugged, or in pain..
<SuzD> one will be 4 in April, the other is 14mths
> I really, really love having cancer
<Craig> Poor kid...any signs of improvement?
* SuzD hugs Doub_B
<SuzD> er, Doug_B
<Craig> Wow.  My 6.5 year old is hanging over my shoulder as I 
type. :)
<SuzD> I do that every time
> Little people!  My favorite kind!
> hi norrie!!!!
<Craig> Nori says "Hi!!!!!!!"
<BRuadh> My 16 month old loves to hang on my chair as I type.
> Craig:  slowly.  I\'ve decided to take disability and spend 
the year dead for tax purposes
<Craig> Kids can sense focused attention...and it draws \'em 
like a magnet.  Cats are the same way.
* SuzD waves hi to Norrie!
> Suz:  Nori is the future Ruler of the Planet.
<Craig> :: sighs, nods.  "Kid, I think you\'ve chosen well.  
I\'ve been back and forth on that question, and I really 
think that\'ll be the best route for you."
<Craig> Nori waves back!  Loudly!
<Craig> Sorry about that :: -- I\'m losing track of what part of 
the Net I\'m on. :)
> been MUCKing about, have we?
<SuzD> earth to grayman
* Craig grins, nods.
<grayman> Yea
<Craig> Suz, please...*Sylea* to grayman.
<SuzD> sorry <G>
<SuzD> Sylea to grayman
<SuzD> incoming comm message, sir
<Craig> *thwap*
<Craig> Sorry, \'Holy Grail\' image just leapt to mind. :)
> What is the sound made by a realtivistic rock hitting the 
Latex Planet of Pleasure?
* Craig whips out NearCeeRock, his spreadsheet for planetary 
assaults...clickety clickety...
> Craig, that\'s my mail announcemnt..Message for you sir!
<Craig> The sound, according to my calculations, is...SprrRRROOO
NK!
<SuzD> Doug_B, the soundbyte from Python?
<SuzD> we used to have that as ours, too <G>
* Craig laughs! "Perfect!"
<BRuadh> Been fun tonight, but gotta go.
<SuzD> nite, Brian
<SuzD> gone afk
<Craig> The creepiest I\'ve ever heard is HAL\'s "There is a 
message for you" from 2010.
<grayman> nite
<Craig> See ya!
> Everybody loves it.. Kirsten is currently using Dana scully 
saying "have you checked your email this morning, Mulder?"
> She was using the HAL message before that
*** BRuadh has quit IRC (Leaving)
* Craig chuckles. "Might\'ve guessed. Did you see my Nancy 
sonnet that mentioned them?"
> Yes!  I forwarded it onto the Duchovnik Mailing List
* Craig is stunned. "And? I\'m almost afraid to ask. I mean, how 
would they understand the context?"
> I keep imag8ining picking her up some dark morning, and 
pointing out the distinct lack of twelfth planets in the 
morning sky
* Craig snickers.
> I gave the basic backround on Nancy and the Zetas (opening 
for Bob Dylan)
<Craig> There\'s a college band by that name at Northwestern 
now, I\'m told.
<Craig> I gotta run along pretty quick...few minutes or so.
> I love it!  
> Me too.. DS9, B5, sleep
<Craig> The three components of life. :)
> You should hang out here more often
<Craig> I will.  Any action at non-scheduled times?
> sometimes.. I usually wander by arounf 6 or 7 to see if 
anybody is home
> night all

<Craig> G\'night!  And to Kiri too!
