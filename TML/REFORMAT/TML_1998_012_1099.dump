I\'ve been using a minimum armor factor of 10 times max acceleration.  This
produces results similar to the standard hulls found in the QSDS.  Maximum
possible armor is whatever volume\'s left after you allow for everything
else, if you want a flying block of alloy there\'s nothing to stop you.
Acceleration is limited by the effectiveness of the Inertial Compensators at
a given TL, the chart for this is found on page 103 of the Starships book.
I dunno what they do at TL 9, there\'s G-tanks but no info on how effective
they are.

Here, here.

But even so, with a bit of work, you can hammer *anything* to fit any TU.  Just depends on how much hassle you\'re willing to go thru to get the job done.

Why not increase the press run to 200 copies or so?  It would bring the price 
per copy down a bit and give you a bit of a cash surplus to buy the work 
needed for the next module.  Your time\'s gotta be worth *SOMETHING*, for 
Ghenghis\' sake!

Is there a possibility of a second press run of LOM?  I\'m sure they would
probably sell out just as quick as the first run did.  AAMOF, somebody on the
TNE-RCES list asked me if I wanted to sell mine already.  Course, you *KNOW*
what the answer to that was!  <grin>

I\'d argue I estimated about a factor of 3-5 low, but was setting assumtions

I\'m aware of the scout cruisers, as well as the mission specific donosevs,
et al. I assumed that the scout service has many ships not subject to
"Navalization" except in extreme situations, and thus not in the naval
figures. In fact, I was assuming pretty much only type S and variants, and
fast couriers, and fleet couriers in the scout pool.

One reference in cannon (can\'t remember which) gave some figure for
mothbals ion relation to the main fleet. I figure probably another 5E9 -
9E9 Td in mothballs. However; Since the main fleet is TL 14-15, the reserve
fleets are the TL13-14 ships, and the mothballs would then logically be
primarily TL 11-13....

And to think, IMTU, there is a privately owned ship of 1E6Td... <G>

Sounds ideal to me, if it is at least 1 sector of buffer between it and the
play areas. I\'d buy it. I\'d also buy a book like what I hear SJG has going
for the Marches for each sector of the Imperium.

(I have heard SJG has at least a paragraph for EVERY WORLD in the Marches.)

Well, if you sent the check thru the mail, you can sic the postal
inspectors on them. If you paid via credit card, sic the credit card
company on them. And if all else fails, file in your *local* small

Well, you could also call it Erewhon Sector (nowhere spelled

author of "Utopia") a few centuries back. :-)

This reminds me entirely too much of the mess that resulted when there
was a dispute over the ownership of the QuickBBS BBS software. It tied
things up for years and a lot of folks switched to something else. 

While it may not be time to sic a lawyer on them, it\'s definitely time
to be talking to one.

And that\'s exactly what you do. *YOU* decide how many gees you want the
ship to have. Then you stick in enough engine and powerplant to give
the required thrust. You may discover that you can\'t cram enough in. :-)

The maximum acceleration depends on what else goes in the ship.
Acceleration is simple thrust divided by the mass of the ship. 

With armor, it\'s much the same. You are only limited by what you can
afford and what affect other items you want have.

It\'s like the real world. You are going to discover that the "limits"
are *interactive*. That is, setting a ship up with A means you can\'t do
B.

Hi:

With all this excitement because Marc uttered the word "T5", I would like to
make a request.

I would buy a CD-ROM with all of classic traveller bundled together with some
of the supplements and some of the stuff from Digest Group.

I\'ve always liked CT rules the best. The only reason I ever bought
Megatraveller is because at first glance it appeared it had all of the CT
rules in one place rather than a bunch of
little black books that I was afraid would disintegrate from overuse.

Thank You

Hello all,

For those of you who are interested, I\'ve got a small Traveller section on my
web pages at

http://www.innotts.co.uk/~paulradford/

It contains a campaign consisting of of about 10 linked adventures. Now if only
other people could take more trouble to perhaps put some of their adventures on
the net?

Some vehicle designs with images may be going on in the near future as well.

<lurk>

Cheers,

Paul

	In reality, the max for Gs depends on (a) how much acceleration your
crew can withstand, and (b) how strong a drive you can mount.
*Normally* what you do is determine how much acceleration
compensation you can provide at your TL. That\'s the limit for
merchant/passenger vessels. If the decks are laid out so the thrust
axis points "up" (NOT like the scout/courier), then you can add 1G.
Military vessels can add about 2Gs, but the crews can\'t do much at 2G
excess acceleration--they have to be all strapped in.

Well as I said I picked Trav up sometime (memory failure at work!) in late
1977 and I was born in Oct. 1954. At the time I started playing I was
working as a machineist and had a 3 year old and a 1 year old son. Later, as
they grew and I moved into a management job and re-started school for
engineering I dropped out of game. Now, in my waining years, having shipped
both boys to the U.S.M.C. for wargaming training, I find that a teenage
daughter leaves just enough time to play/ref again.

So even with the "vacation" from Trav, am I eligable for the club?

That would be best, probably *more* than 1 sector buffer, 3 or 4 sectors

Yes, I agree with you about this too. ;->

There *is* a small "however" associated with SJG\'s GT and _Behind The

describe the main worlds.  Ok, UWP\'s aren\'t a GURPS thing, but I
certainly wish they would include them even if they didn\'t explain them
in the text at all.  UWP\'s don\'t provide nearly enough information to
really detail a system, but they are a quick and convenient shorthand
that I\'ll hate to lose.

Strangly enough, I wasn\'t influenced much by Star Wars movies in my Traveller campaigns. I think some of the players were, but for me it was really Poul Anderson\'s books.

Sure!  We can start and "Old Traveller\'s" club.  To join you have to be
old enough to...what?  Watched the first Mercury launch on black and
white TV?  Voted inour first election before CT came out?  Been around
for the launch of all 4 versions of Traveller?

Well, the UWP압 can be found in other sources, however. I consider that to be a boon as i don앖
get the information included in the CT-SM supplement again.
ok, it압 not all in a book and you got to have both books handy, but it leaves more space for
new info and helps keep the price down!

	That\'s great for all of us CT/MT/TNE/T4/T5/T98 ... owners, but
doesn\'t provide *any* help at all to the prospective new buyer of
Traveller material.

  Perhaps they (SJG) could at least make the 1120 SM UWP\'s available
on the web-site just like the TNS updates, etc?

The MegaTraveller Adventure \'Arrival: Vengeance\' featured the best drawn

When the referee draws from his experience with particular D&D rules
to play the game, I feel like I\'m playing "Dungeons in Space".

On the other hand, when I see those sublime 8x10 parsec subsector maps,
and am told that TAS has paid for my High Passage on board a 200t Free 
Trader, I know I\'m Travelling, and I\'m happy.

But when my stats have such oddments as "charisma", "agility", or
"constitution", the universe turns dark.

Some enlightened gentleman posted a concise summary last year on what
the Traveller "Baseline" is.  I don\'t remember exactly what that
baseline was, but I suppose it includes

	the one-week, parsec based jump drive
	the subsector map and UWP code
	primarily military-experienced characters (tho\' not exclusively)

...it doesn\'t even include the 3I, because the rules explicitly state
that anything the referee wants to use the rules for is fine.

I\'d say, anyone who started playing before 1980.  I didn\'t see the first
Mercury launch, but I do remember the Geminis.

Well what I\'ve learned from collecting the LBB set of rules is that early on
buying the TRAVELLER was like buying AD&D what you got in the basic and even
the Deluxe set was basicly " here are the rules go play somewhere" and you
could build simple star ships and the like and make up your own melieu. The
3I came later like one year after the game was first printed.

Now in this age of gaming games are sold by the strength of the world that
they are set in and not on the strength of the system (this does not apply
to D&D. It\'s sold by name reconition alone). 3I is a complex world to play
and explain to some ppl. My first traveller games in 87 during MT was a flop
because I wanted all the bells and whistles that I found this world to have
and they where use too easier black and white worlds. So I built a
BattleStar ( yea like the one on TV) and we started that way. Then later I
introduced them to the 3I ( well you know.. if you\'re looking for earth...
that\'s where you find it.)

On the Traveller Rules I like the ones from TNE as the most advance set to
date. All the others are just the same. I like the MT task system for the D6
versions of the game also quick and easy. But I think that you should be
able to play in the melieu without having to use the rules too...
exspecially if you want something else that Traveller rules to date don\'t
offer. one example of this is using Corp or TIMELORDS to make the game lest
inducive to volence or Fudge for simpler craft design...

In Fact why not Release T5 as a world book with all the races and the like
and add a system later? The Game Cops aren\'t going to knock on your door.
but you may get flamed in a mailing list or 2 for using D&D rules with it
:).

Whoa, that takes me back...one of my fragmentary early memories is
watching the entire Mercury 1 mission, sitting on my mother\'s lap in our
kitchen, watching the old Zenith B&W (which, come to think of it, was
considerably _newer_ then).

I distinctly remember thinking \'Wow, that\'s all?\' when it was over so
soon, though that may have been later unconsious embellishment, since I
was all of 3 1/2 then.

Aye, I remember wondering, why are these two guys sitting in a funny box
in the water??  It started a life long fascination with space flight. 
Now I\'m an engineer, trying desperately to figure out how to start a
small private space launch firm.  My favorite hobby is trying to figure
out how to really get to the stars.  Makes my head hurt sometimes.

been playing and buying Traveller stuff now for 22 years and well
I guess I will always buy it. I just hope you don\'t do what TSR
did, and just make a few cosmetic changes and try to sell it as
a all "New" version. That has begun to turn me off to buying the
games stuff that changes every couple of years. It is one of the reasons 
I stopped being in HIWG and the reason I created many

It\'s not correct in that it\'s not "simply" the shape of the aircraft that
makes it invisible to radar. Assuming that the "stealth bomber" is the B-2,
it also makes extensive use of radar absorbant materials (RAM) to reduce
its radar cross-section (RCS).

When considering stealth a designer must consider both the reflective
properties of the design (dependent on shape and material) and generated
signals (electronic and thermal from on-board systems).

Reflections
  Shape
    Avoid dihedrals, corners and cavities.
  Materials
    Use absorbant materials on all exterior surfaces or low-reflection
materials for _all_ systems and subsystems throughout the craft (i.e.
wooden engines!).

Note that both the F-117 and B-2 have engine intakes and exhausts on the
upper wing surface so that the wing body sheilds the cavities from
ground_based radar.
Most present generation warplanes have canted tailplanes to avoid dihedrals
and RAM at wing roots.

Generated Signals
  Engine exhaust
    Mask it (A-10) or disperse it (AH-64).
  Engine and system heat
    Trap it or direct it to specific port where it can be treated like exhaust.
  System electronic signiture
    Sheild it.
  Airframe/hull heat
    Minimize generation by restricting manuvers or by using materials which
do not radiate IR except at _extremely_ high temperatures.
  Lights
    Turn off the lights or close the shutters :->


The F-117 relies heavily upon faceting to reduce its RCS. By the time the
B-2 was designed, however, \'stealth\' materials had advanced to the point
that the bomber could use more aerodynamically appropriate shapes. It is
often stated that images of the newer B-2 were released before images of
the older F-117 because a photo would reveal _all_ of the F-117\'s tricks
while the B-2\'s secrets are not visible to the naked eye.

In short (too late ;-> ), stealth is a complex field. See if your local
library has _Stealth:_deception,_evasion,_and_concealment_in_the_air_ by
Doug Richardson, Orion Books; New York, 1989. It is an excellent lay
introduction to the topic.

Adventure 4, Leviathan, is centered on adventures in Egyrn subsector.
Egyrn is lies in the Trojan Reach sector, just across the sector border

_Tarsus:world_beyond_the_frontier_ includes a map of District 268, UWP for
all worlds of 268, extensive information and maps of Tarsus (District 268
0308, Spinward Marches 1138), and very brief library data entries on
Collace (District 268 0407), Forine (District 268 0703), Fornice (Mora

I don\'t think you want to set the line that way.  I first played Traveller in

	What is it about Corp & TIMELORDS that you think makes them less 
inducive to violence?  I\'m always looking for ways to make non-combat 
adventures more fun and more the focus of the game.

Yup.

Course, most of *my* Travelling over the years has been solo stuff or PBEMs.

Historical Notes 

Once the Terrans realised how much of an advantage the Meson Gun would
give them in combat with Vilani vessels, tactics were devised which
would allow the maximum use of the weapon. The result was the Tokyo
class Ship of the Line. 
The Terran reasoning was that, as the Meson Gun was able to bypass the
armour of the target, then extremely powerful weapons were not required.
What was required instead was a larger number of weapons, to enable more
hits to be inflicted. 
The main armament of the Tokyo\'s is a comparatively low powered Meson
spinal mount. By accepting the smaller (though still deadly to any
vessel it hits) main weapon, the secondary armament could be greatly
increased. This was important because part of the secondary armament
were 8 bay-mounted Meson Guns (in addition to 12 powerful bay-mounted
PAWs), each of which could inflict critical damage to any opponent. 
The tactics the Terrans used with these vessels was to use their high
acceleration to close to short range with an opponent, relying on the
extremely heavy armour and reinforced structure (capable of handling
20g, the same as most other Terran warships) of the vessels to absorb
the fire of the opposing vessel. At short range the Meson Guns would be
at their most effective, although in theory remaining at long range
would still allow the destruction on any enemy ship, although the lower
damage inflicted at long range would mean that the destruction would
take longer. 
As with other Terran ships of the line of the time, an apparent weakness
is the limited size of the fuel purification system (purification of a
full load taking more than nine standard days). However, the vessel was
intended to operate as part of a fleet with attendant support vessels,
so the purification system provided is intended purely as an emergency
backup. 
The class as a whole were higher effective, and very popular with their
crews. Before construction ceased a total of 140 were built, and they
saw extensive combat throughout the Ninth and Nth wars. The first of the
class, the Tokyo, joined the fleet in 2277AD, and the last, the Lima,
joined in 2295AD. 

Btw, if anybody ever did produce those Andy Akins t-shirts that were
mentioned, then I\'d be up for one (and probably so would plenty of
others :)

Regards,

Rob.

After a half a dozen characters get cut down in the first 
firefight, then characters either start playing smart, 
(shooting from cover, never giving a sucker a stand up 
firefight, etc) or they try and avoid getting shot at wherever 
possible by not getting into shoot-outs.

As I recall, Timelords is an extremely unforgiving game. You should worry
about getting shot in character as much as you would worry in real life
(it\'s a fairly deadly combat system).  Non-violent methods are always
better in such systems.  (Duh!)

Yes - Tarsus and Beltstrike are both set in District 268. In addition,
Faldor and Volentine Gambit (set on Mertactor) are also set in District
268. I\'m still keying in the info. from the booklet in Gambit, but it and
Faldor will both be out by this Christmas.

Actually both FFS and FFS2 have planetoid hull design sequences,
somewhere in the hull design sections. (NB: One excellent reason to
telecommute...you have all your Traveller books at hand ;-)

The tricky part is coming up with a power, drive and fuel supply for
that 400 year journey. You\'ll have to look into the \'Alternate
technology\' for drive technology.

	There *is* a special coating on many stealth aircraft. In fact,
there are many different types of coatings. Stealth (vs active
sensors) is based on reducing the amount of energy reflected back to
the sensor. Therefore, you can either reduce all reflection by
coating the plane with something that absorbs the frequencies used by
sensors, or you can shape the surfaces such that reflections don\'t go
back the way the came.

	One classic coating is microspheres of carbon suspended in the
paint, which are "just" the right size to absorb and/or scatter the
frequency of the sensor you want to protect against. At one time, you
could even by a "bra" for your Porsche or Corvette that supposedly
absorbed police radar.

	Beyond just coatings, there\'s the basic material of the aircraft
itself. Wood and fabric don\'t show up on radar worth beans.

	Side note: supposedly, the cockpit windows for the F-117 had to be
specially designed, when somebody realized the pilot\'s helmet would
cause a greater return than the rest of the airplane.

	Unfortunately, there\'s something called bistatic sensors: the
transmitter is at one place, and the receiver is at another. So if
the contour is designed not to reflect back, it may actually be
reflecting straight at the receiver ...

	It\'s also not just the surfaces, but the edges and joints.

	Much more to go into here, but I won\'t. To summarize, whoever
claimed there were no stealth coatings is incorrect.

What I\'ve read and seen on TV indicates that the shape is the primary
factor, and certain materials are used to further reduce signal. RAM tape
is used to cover the joints and door edges; the surface is some kind of
semi-RAM material at optimal agles for radar deflection, and the grills are
special material and construction. [RAM = Radar Absorbent Material]

The important factor IIUC is a dimond/lozenge shape, slanted back.

One design I\'ve seen is similar to the following

- ----

 RAM

\\    /\\    /\\    /\\    /\\    /\\    /\\    /
 \\  /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /
  \\/    \\/    \\/    \\/    \\/    \\/    \\/
RRM (Radar Reflective Material)
- ----

Basically, the stuff reduces even direct signature by use of andlged
diamond reflection under a RAM layer, and when combined with stealth
shaping modes, is supposed to really reduce signatures. Above illo based
upon one I saw in Scientific American YEARS ago (the late \'80\'s)

I remember watching the LAST televised one... Alaska didn\'t have much live
TV back then... Evening news was even flown in...

IMO, Old Travellers means having Played or Run traveller (even if only the
solo activities) prior to the release of MT in 1987, and being willing to
admit to being that old.

I remember the Challenger Disaster, Reagan getting shot, An apollr landing,
the fall of the wall, the collapse of the curtain, and neighbors never
coming home from the \'nam, and even Walter Cronkite saying "The war is
over; we are out of Vietnam. Good Night, America, and God Bless." at the
end of a news broadcast. My first real memory of a news event. I was
playing with legos on the living room floor...

True, a number of you are older, and true, mayny have been playing longer,
but to Me, You\'ve been playing a long time if you remember a time before a
change of system mechanics.

Then again, Traveller seems to be what you make of it....

David Thomas (whose previous BITS credits include 101 Lifeforms).

This is the latest in the \'little white book\' 101 Series, and the first
since IG\'s stopped producing new Traveller material. The book is the
longest in the 101 Series at 56 pages, and is packed with details of
governments from code 0 through to D. Each government has a description,
combined with referee\'s notes and a plot hook. There are exactly 101 in the
book, including several from the old flame war favourite, Feudal
Technocracies.

These take 52 pages - the rest include a single page glossary and three
pages of introduction/titles. The cover is a digitally enhanced photo, as
the artist who produced the previous covers has left the country.

I\'d prefer to see T4.1, as it means that people won\'t feel as ripped off by
Imperium\'s mess ups...

And the draft rules set seemed somewhat incremental?

Tarsus is a world in 268 (and in the Solomani Rim, but the boxed set is in
the SM)

Night of Conquest covers something in 268 IIRC
As does Safari Ship and Leviathan IIRC

well Corp & Timelords don\'t use a hit point system to deal damage. Damage is
a system of impairments and negative modifiers to the Charater. This and the
stun rules stops players from rushing into combat because as soon as they
get hit , they start missing and it\'s hard to regain advantage agein. Or an
unlucky stun rule and your Charater is knocked unconsous with a lucky hit...

CORP is quick and clean.. TIMELORDS has lots of dice rolling but they both
have that inovative combat system.

Well, I guess I probably qualify as well.  I\'ll be 43, this coming Dec.

Maybe we need to form some sort of "Geriatrics Club", like that one that

	The purpose of this particular layout is to increase the effective
path through the absorbent material taken by an incoming signal, and
hence increase the amount of absorbtion. Trace a path--the signal
comes in, gets partially absorbed by the RAM, then gets reflected at
an angle by the RRM. It crosses to the other side of the wedge, being
absorbed more by the RAM, and gets reflected again, crossing to the
other side ... until it finally gets reflected back out, and the
final amount gets absorbed on the last leg. Compare that to a simple
flat layer of RAM over RRM ...

	A)  Rules for planetoid hulls aren\'t in FF&S but are in FF&S2.

	B)  Don\'t worry if you don\'t have FF&S2 because you wouldn\'t want 
to use a planetoid hull for a sub-light colony ship anyway.  The reason 
is that planetoid hulls have to be very massive to give you the same 
structural support as a metal hull.  What you really want is a 
feather-light hull of crystal-iron or, even better, super-dense.  Mass is 
at an absolute premium with a sub-light colony ship, and the less you 
waste on your hull the faster you reach your destination.  The only 
reason to use a planetoid hull for an stl ship is if you don\'t have the 
capability to build a metal hull large enough for your purposes.

	C)  FF&S2 _does_ have useful rules for stl ships\' life support.  
It has options for extended life support that runs from different flavors 
of algae (yum!), all the way up to small domestic animals.

I\'m working on the design of the ESA Long Range Colony Mission ships right
now.   They are up to 25,000,000 dtons and still climbing, and I haven\'t
even added the drives yet.  That\'s becuase the description specifies
asteroid ships, 110,000 crew and passengers, and 2400+ years duration.  For
what it\'s worth, I calculate the cruising velocity of those ships at 0.25c,
based on both the colonization times in the original background, and the
straight-line distance from Earth to the Islands Clusters divided by the
trip time (actually 0.23c).  

In versions of Traveller that use reactionless thrusters, these appear to
have been invented by the first interstellar wars (c. AD 2113); _Imperium_
has ships cruising at ~0.86c.  This is essentially impossible with reaction
drives, but will work with reactionless.  Note also that 0.86c corresponds
to a 50% time dilation (2 years planet time = 1 year ship time), which may
be one reason it was chosen.

My recommendation:  since TNE uses reaction drives (however flaky HEPlaR
may be, it\'s still a reaction drive), delta-V is important - keep your
designs as small and light on payload as possible.  The main advantage of
asteroid hulls is they are money-cheap.  They are also mass-pigs, which
becomes exponentially more important when you have to apply the rocket
equation to your design.

If you still want to fiddle with asteroids, use High Guard for the hull,
then apply FF&S normally to the fittings (at a cursory glance, I couldn\'t
find the asteroid hull treatment in FF&S referred to in another post).
Otherwise, write me offline and I can send you the notes I\'ve collected
from various parts of the web.

 Yes. Tarsus is one of the worlds in District 268. Adventure 10(?)
Safari Ship is also set in 268, and an Amber Zone from WAAAAY back
("Tarkine Down!") is set on Tarkine. Glisten (the world) got a big
write-up by DGP. These are what I remember off hand, but I don\'t
think Five Sisters has ever had any real attention paid to it...

 In the unpublished department, Rob Dean (the TMLs original gearhead)
designed a number of ships for Collace\'s Navy.

Actualy, it was "Divine Intervention", the other half of DA 6.  Set on
Pavabid, it included enough information to get a good idea of the world\'s
culture.  NoC was part of the "Scottian Huntress" series, IIRC.

"Tarkine Down" in JTAS... hmmm.. have to look it up later.

Where was "Beltstrike!" set?

CORPS combat is lethal.  Play with guns and you\'ll find your character

They repay injuries with massive penalties, high chances of death, and no

That\'s just fine!  No one was to know about that for another 20 years!

Oh well, now that he\'s gone and let the cat out of the bag I might as
well go ahead and tell all.

Evidence of alien visitations to our system was found by astronauts
during the Apollo 12 mission in the form of several empty beersii cans
and other assorted trash piled up in a crater, but the Nixon
administration decided that it should be kept secret...what else would
*they* do?  The collision of an alien probe with Apollo 13 confirmed the
matter, and almost let the "cat out of the bag", but luckily the crew of
the 13, kept their heads, kept quiet, and got themselves and the wreaked
probe back to earth, more or less, in one piece.  

After that the United States quickly wound down their public
explorations and over the next few years brought other nations into the
secret.  Many discussions, at the highest levels, took place before
plans were agreed to.  Eventually, in 1974, the UN was given control of
the project, and through a secret Security Council resolution a space
program was authorized to secure the Solar System for humanity, and
prepare us all for eventual contact with the aliens now called Vilani.

The second round of lunar landings actually did begin on 79/07/20 with
the landing of the UN ship Beowolf on the farside of Luna near the south
pole.  Regular luna launches have continued for the last 19 years.
Launches are made from the supposedly mothballed Vandenberg launch
facilities, and from a USSR base in a *supposedly* irradiated area.
These launches have been occurring at an average rate of 26 per year now
for almost 20 years.  

Today a thriving base has been established on the far side of the moon.
From there we have begun to study the radio and television traffic
emanating from nearby systems...strangely similar to our own...;
tracking systems have been put in place to record and provide warning of
alien visits, though none have occurred during the 19 years of
observation; and research facilities in space sciences have been
established.

On earth, joint research programs at research institutes are developing
the technologies needed to assure Terran survival in the New World
Order.  Deep in the Ural Mountains, at a secret lab, scientists are
reverse engineering a fusion engine from a model acquired from some
un-disclosed source.  In the desert vastness of the United States
anti-gravity technologies are being developed from clues gathered from
other un-disclosed sources.

As *we* all know, experiments with Jump Technology won\'t really begin
until both the fusion and AG projects bear fruit.  We can only hope
success comes soon.

I\'d reverse engineer the hull using the MT percentages and reverse
engineering the MT AV 50 or 56, looking up the hull multiplier table (which
is the equivalent thicknes, in CM of Steel) from MT, then converting that
into CM of Steel Equivalent for whichever FF&S you\'re using. IIRC, double
it, then drop fractions.

Planetoids from MT:
Std: MTAV 50, useable volume 80%, Armor Mod: 80, so TNE AV 160. COst is
tunnelling cost per Td made available, totalling Cr75 per Td of the
interior, plus transport costs of Cr10 per Td of Asteroid.

Buffered: MT AV56, Useable Volume 65%, Tunnelling and Transport costs same
rates. MT AM is 135, so TNE AV 270.

I\'d figure mass at Specific Gravity of around 8, so 8 tons per cubic meter,
or roughly 112 tons per Td of 14 m^3 of planetoid remaining. Assumes a
nickel-iron asteroid (Iron has a SG of around 7-8).

in the Bowman Belt, in District 268. Quite an interesting set, as it gives
maps of one of the major cities of the belt, which is Koenig\'s Rock, a
Hollowed out planetoid on the order of 2km Diameter IIRC. Big. Massive.

JFK was shot on Friday.  My junior high, part of the high school, let
out at noon because that night was the homecoming game and the
homecoming parade was scheduled for one.  It was during the parade that
word of the "incident in Dallas" began to spread through the crowd.  I
went back to my homeroom and listened to a radio with the teacher and a
half dozen other students.  The radio described it as an incident in the
motorcade, then a disturbance, then it was confirmed that shots had been
fired, then Walter Cronkite came on...at least I think it was
Cronkite...and said that the President was dead. 

I walked 4 miles that afternoon to where my father worked, rather than
take the bus home, nobody would have been home, and I didn\'t want to die
alone.  I remember being filled with dread, walking as fast as I could,
and continuously looking up.  I fully expected the missiles to start
falling at any moment.  See, I was sure killing the President was the
beginning of the Soviet attack, with the President dead we wouldn\'t have
anyone who could officially send the orders to respond...I was twelve,
so what did I know.

The football game when on that night, although there was some discussion
of canceling it.  We went.  It was cold and it rained.  We lost by a
field goal on the last play of the game. I didn\'t really care.

There\'s no Ob Traveller for this one, I guess.  Consider it a bit of
history.

I haven\'t been able to find much.  The one short blurb I found said that
no positive results from tests so far.

Has anyone gotten any follow up on the room temperature superconductor

 Not as such, but the rules for creating deep meson sites work nicely as a
start... A fixed formula for price and time for such things is probably being
optimistic about the regularity of the universe, though. This summer\'s two
asteroid movies should be enough to prove that (assuming you want to see Deep
Impact at all, feel free to sleep through all the stuff that happens in an
atmosphere. Or better yet, go see Armageddon twice. I did.).

As usual any and all comments are most welcome. I\'m intending to keep 
updating the maps regularly as I push towards getting a full set of maps for the 
entire Nine wars period.

I recall my mother taking me out in the backyard one night to try to
point out Sputnik to me. Alas, there was also an airplane in the sky,
so guess which "moving light" I focused on. <sigh>

Oh well, I was only 3 or 4 so it I can almost forgive myself.

Try *29* years ago. And it\'s been more than 25 years since the last
time men were on the moon (last Apollo moon flight launched at 1233
EST, Dec 7, 1972)

My "problem" is that I don\'t remember anything but the LBBs...  Then 4, 
5 & 6.  I never got MT, TNE, T4...  So I guess I\'m stuck in my 
childhood.  And what a great place to be stuck!

Then Eris wrote about JFK being shot.  I was too young for that.  But 
your reaction would probably be what many felt when the rumors of 
Strephon\'s assassination came out, and from the descriptions of the 
fighting, some missiles did begin to fall!

sorry my friend, this breaks several laws, especially conservation of
momentum.  (I realize you are merely reporting this, not coming up with
it yourself)  We may not know everything about the universe, but in
general, what we know about physics remains true even in the light of
later developments, except for particular exceptions and circumstances. 
Besides, how much additional mass will the magnet and its support
structure add to the vehicle.  Also, how will you keep it in line, and
spinning.  And, how will you power said system, and keep THAT weight
down.  The anti grav and contra grav we use in Trav is fun, nice to have,
etc. but frankly they break way too many laws.  Personally, I have my
doubts that such things, in the way Trav describes and/or uses them, are
possible.

I remember (vaguely) the discussion about how to reach people
with the Gospel of Traveller.  I don\'t remember if you-all
decided if it were possible to tear kids away from GURPS,
D&D, etc.  I don\'t remember if you-all decided how Traveller
should best be marketed.

So, is Traveller going to just be a niche market?  Is it due
to something about the game itself?

Oh yes: I remember someone mentioning that role playing is out
of vogue -- it\'s thought of as a 70\'s thing (since that was when 
it was bigger?).  I don\'t suppose this image can be blasted?
I don\'t suppose this image is already melting?

The answer to that question will get me a 20 year vacation with a better basic cable plan than you have.

Prob is, Jim, we *really* don\'t know how gravity *works* yet.  All we know for sure is, it\'s there, it\'s measurable, and because of it you can have a real bad day if you fall out a window on the 29th floor.

Not a bad idea there.  Only, figure on \'dead\' runs, there\'d only be 1 tender, 
stock, just like in T&G, 1kt.  2 to 3 Xboats on station at any given time.  A 
couple snub fighters in real backwaters, your 2 or 3 SDB\'s closer to the 
frontier.  Resupply by 400 dt subbie merchants run by Imperiallines or other 
front outfit a la Air America.  Refuel by fuel shuttles.

FWIW, IMTU, I used to have the main starports of most high tech systems to be 
in the Oort Cloud or the Kuiper Belt of the system.  Over top of the planets 
themselves were secondary ports.

Actually, we have a pretty good theory of gravity - General Relativity does a 
perfectly good job of explaining how it works in terms of the geometry of 
spacetime, and how mass causes spacetime to curve. It\'s possibly the most 
elegant theory of the twentieth century...Of course, it fails utterly on 
quantum scales, but that\'s currently a minor point and irrelevant to 
evaluation of macroscopic devices like this "gravity shield".

First of all a Gurps Traveller is a great marketing Idea. In todays Rpg
market games are sole based on there Melieu and not the game engine itself.
Traveller which is a Genric engine itself may want to ad a Traveller System
book which is just system and how to create Offical Occupations for the
traveller system that are balanced for play in any enviorment. After all I
can create vichecles for any Tech level so why not Charaters for any Genra?

Secondly despite what we fans may think about being the second origanal RPG
ever made (all others being copies of D&D) traveller doesn\'t have the name
reconigition that D&D has. New players will be picking it up due to some
other reason... like the Star Wars RPG was not gritty enough or what ever.
Then they read about all the great races in the book and they want to play
them and the race books are out of print... Never was a edition Of AD&D
released without a Monster Manual so the old Classic trav races need to be
added..even if they are not detailed.
Handle detailing in suppliments.

Set the new edition during a war to add to the volence level and gives a

Not like the rebelion in MT but like interstellar war with the Zhos. the
zhos are the bad gays... it\'s niche now because the system is very grey and
appeals only to ppl who think in the grey areas.

A story about the USS Yorktown Aegis missile cruiser...in part...:

"The Navy뇹 Smart Ship technology may not be as smart as the service
contends.

Although PCs have reduced workloads for sailors aboard the Aegis missile
cruiser USS Yorktown, software glitches resulted in
system failures and crippled ship operations, according to Navy
officials.

Navy brass have called the Yorktown Smart Ship pilot a success in
reducing manpower, maintenance and costs. The Navy
began running shipboard applications under Microsoft Windows NT so that
fewer sailors would be needed to control key ship
functions.

But the Navy last fall learned a difficult lesson about automation: The
very information technology on which the ships depend also
makes them vulnerable. The Yorktown last September suffered a systems
failure when bad data was fed into its computers
during maneuvers off the coast of Cape Charles, Va.

The ship had to be towed into the Naval base at Norfolk, Va., because a
database overflow caused its propulsion system to fail,
according to Anthony DiGiorgio, a civilian engineer with the Atlantic
Fleet Technical Support Center in Norfolk.

늉e are putting equipment in the engine room that we cannot maintain
and, when it fails, results in a critical failure, DiGiorgio
said. It took two days of pierside maintenance to fix the problem.

The Yorktown has been towed into port after other systems failures, he
said."

I\'m going to be charitable, and not even say a thing remotely related to
a giant software kludge from Redmond...;-)

BUT, ObTrav...what happens when your high automation ship suffers a
disruption?

Nasa\'s Antigravity Machine
From Popular Mechanics - 03-JAN-98 - By Jim Wilson 
* What goes up must come down. Well, maybe not. 

Later this month, NASA researchers hope to conduct an experiment that could
determine if the force of gravity might someday be adjusted, like the volume
of a radio. The space agency says that turning down the gravity in the
immediate vicinity of a rocket would enable future spacecraft to roam the
galaxy by using the tug of distant planets and stars. 

Scientists have historically dismissed talk of anti-gravity machines as utter
nonsense. But at a rare, closed-door conference at NASA\'s Lewis Research
Center in Cleveland, Ohio, scientists representing major universities,
national weapons laboratories, defense contractors and the corporate research
and development community gathered to hear a detailed account of the space
agency\'s progress in attempting to build a machine that once seemed beyond the
bounds of possibility. 

In a surprising departure from its, long-standing policy of openness, NASA did
not invite the press to the conference. However, after, interviews with
attendees, Popular Mechanics has learned that a group of researchers at NASA\'s
Marshall Manned Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, has nearly
completed building a device that could make it possible to reduce
gravitational attractions in its immediate vicinity. 

Part of the reason for the secrecy is that the very thought of such a machine
defies conventional scientific wisdom. 

To understand why, it\'s helpful to know there are two complementary but not
entirely compatible explanations for gravity. Isaac Newton, the first
physicist, described gravity as an attraction between two masses. Albert
Einstein\'s general theory of relativity suggests mass actually causes space-
time to warp around it. 

Imagine, for instance, the indentation created by placing a bowling ball on a
soft bed. 

Both theories explain why apples fall from trees. Scientists consider
Einstein\'s theory superior because it explains also why light -- which has no
mass -- appears to bend in strong gravitational fields. 

Light, as the theory goes, follows the mass-induced curve in space-time.
Viewing gravity this way makes it more of a feature of the universe. It is for
this reason that scientists consider the idea antigravity device preposterous.

Well, most scientists, anyway. Ron Koczor, a researcher at NASA\'s Marshall
Space Flight Center, who co-authored a paper on the Huntsville laboratory\'s
gravity modification device that was presented at the conference, picks up the
story. 

"In 1992, Dr. Eugene Podkletnov of Tampere University, Finland, published the
results of his experiment with high-temperature ceramic superconductors,"
Koczor says. 

"He devised an experiment in which a disc of superconducting material was
magnetically levitated and rotated at high speed, up to several thousand rpm,
in the presence of an external magnetic field. In the course of the tests,
Podkletnov noted that objects above the rotating disk showed a variable but
measurable loss of weight, from less than .5% to about 2%. He had no
explanation," explains Koczor. 

Podkletnov collected data from his experiments for nearly four years and
compiled it in a paper that was accepted for publication in the prestigious
Journal of Physics. 

But the paper never appeared. Several days before its scheduled publication in
the fall of 1996, Podkletnov told his story to the London Sunday Telegraph.
Other reporters attempting to confirm the story learned that one of
Podkletnov\'s co-authors claimed to have never worked on the project. 

Podkletnov withdrew his paper and returned to the faculty of the Moscow
Chemistry Science Research Centre. For many journalists, the situation was
beginning to look like the cold fusion debacle. They quickly backed off from
the story. 

Not everyone was dissuaded by Podkletnov\'s refusal to publish his work. Seven
years earlier, Ning Li, a theorist who worked with NASA\'s Marshall center, had
developed a theory suggesting that a superconductor rotated in a strong
magnetic field could disrupt the gravitational force in its immediate
vicinity. Three of her papers were subsequently published by major scientific
journals. 

Currently a senior scientist on the research faculty of the University of
Alabama in Huntsville, Ning Li has been helping to build the superconducting
disc for the Marshall antigravity device for the past year. 

Whitt Brantley, the NASA-designated spokesman for the experiment who also is a
member of the antigravity project, says the space agency\'s scientists decided
last year to try to duplicate Podkletnov\'s machine by looking over his earlier
research and exchanging information with him by telephone and e-mail. 

"Each time we contact him there seems to be more detail. It\'s sort of like
chasing something," says Brantley. 

NASA isn\'t sure its antigravity machine, which is 90% complete, will work. At
the moment, the biggest problem is building the fragile superconducting disc,
which is, in fact, made of two discs, explains Brantley. One is made of metal
that can be levitated in a magnetic field. On top of it is a composite made of
superconducting materials. 

This assembly is housed in a 20-in.-dia. column that stands about 4 ft. tall.
At the start of the experiment, it will be filled with liquid helium or
nitrogen, which cools the apparatus to minus-400 [degrees] F. 

Only then is the disc set into motion. 

If the machine performs as Podkletnov claims, delicate instruments will show a
diminution of gravity\'s tug. 

Brantley says researchers originally saw a slight gravity shielding effect
when they placed instrumentation above a smaller, stationary disc. 

It turned out to be the result of the magnetic field. Adding ordinary 1/2-in.
iron plates removed this anomaly. Some critics contend that if Podkletnov had
taken a similar precaution, the effects that he observed would have likewise
disappeared. 

Most physicists believe that when NASA flips the switch on its gravity
modification experiment, absolutely nothing will happen. Then again, it could
start the countdown to a bold new era in space exploration.

collecting Games Workshop figures. They also play computer RPGs.

Yet most of them don\'t seem to make the transition to the \'real\' gaming
world.

Maybe because the occupants of that real gaming world sit around the table
frinking Scotch and being interrupted by their children.... (Ducks quickly)

There is no point or moral to this post, so don\'t bother looking.

On the other hand "new" theories come about when we check out
conditions that we\'ve not checked out before and discover that the
rules have exceptions for those conditions. 

"Remember" the uproar the Michaelson-Morely experiment caused? It broke
a lot of laws too.

Well, anti-gravity in *general* doesnn\'t break any laws. Heck, I canm
draw you up plans for a unit that even eminent physicists would agree
will work. It\'s just that you\'ll have to dig up a supply of "neutronium
dust" or some other similarly dense dust or fluid to make it work. :-)

Hmmm. We used to have a tradition during Traveller games. One of the players (I
couldn\'t, as the referee) was designated the bartender, and would brew Long
Island Iced Tea for the rest of us. Needless to say, as the gaming went on into
the evening, the actual quality of play tended to deteriorate. (Of course, my
refereeing wasn\'t affected :-)  ).

Nowadays, though, it\'s just Coke after Coke. The sugar high we all feel tends to
make us all very hyper towards the end of the session though.

I think the problem is not one of tearing away from GURPS, D&D, or any
other Role Playing Game.  The time competition is (in order) TV, Computer
Games/Internet, Sports, and CCGs.

Gamers play games.  Whether they are on a computer or in their minds.
There are plenty of (sorry) more entertaining things going on in either TV
land or on the Home Computer that investing the time and effort of
organizing, planning, and executing a session of either Traveller or D&D is
simply not worth the time lost playing Command and Conquer IV,
Streetfighter XX, or Master of Orion 4.

It takes a bit more sophistication to hook into the "god view" thing and
prefer to create your own scenarios and campaigns rather than use someone
else\'s.

One idea I had was to volunteer to lead after school activities at the
local Jr. high or High school.  Parents may think you are a potential
pedophile, however.

[whew, get a spellchecker]  Traveller is both a system and a background
(several actually), but it is, in fact, much more than that; its 50+ web
sites, hundreds of emails per week, dozens of fans willing to ask and
answer questions - and play, its the creator and several original writers
in direct contact with the players...Traveller is a community.

That\'s just fine...but count me out.  Traveller is a bit more like real
life...shades of grey.  I see the system (MT, which is what I\'m using) as a
good mechanical system, easy to play, balanced between realism and
playability.

Oh, and I don\'t think all Zhodani are bad gays either.  Just like all the
other gays, some are bad, some are good, just like all of us.  Is this a
parallel to the Aslan Lesbian thing?

I haven\'t heard of that at all and at least I go into a game store sometimes.

Sorry guys, the whole RPG market is a niche market, including CCGs.  It is
definitely out of vogue in terms of paper.  On the other hand, the Computer
RPG market is still growing strong.  Daggerfall was at least mildly
successful (for those who say "what?" Daggerfall is a first person
perspective D&D-like Adventure Game) for a computer game, and that\'s wildly
sucessful compared to a conventional RPG.

Unless something truly interesting and different happens, Traveller will
continue to be a legacy market, withthe people on this list, and the
non-computer oriented equivalents being pretty much the market for any new
Traveller products coming down the line.  I hope I\'m wrong, but that\'s my
opinion.

That said, there are a tremendous number of "new" products in circulation.
Letter of Marque and the new BITS books are one example, but the
proliferation of web-published stuff is simply amazing.  Need an adventure?
Search!  There\'s a lot of new material out there waiting to be used, and
its all free!  Consider, though, dropping the author a note of thanks when
you do use it, and a bit of commentary.

Traveller is alive and well, right here.  An attitude of serving the Legacy
Market might not be the ideal, but is is certainly better than no Traveller
at all.  Unless Marc can pull the proverbial rabbit out of his hat (and I
sincerely hope he can), were it!  and what we can support is all we can
rely on being supported.

Whew!  Enough ranting.

The sun did not come out quite like on the logo - the rays do not

Their color selection doesn\'t entirely please me; at the moment,
the only color combo I can wholeheartedly recommend is the yellow

After the debate on this for T4 was over, I decided the best
thing is not "blank space" because, in my experience, you still
have to deal with it (players ask what is "over there", etc.)
and it represents work before you can even play.

I decided the thing to do is that some worlds, or a region,
are developed along with everything else, but flagged as
"non-canonical" in that the info can be modified or replaced
by GM\'s without having to worry about contricting things
in future supplements.  That way there aren\'t big
blank areas for unexplained reasons but a GM has
the flexibility he needs.

Its mostly the Traveller veterans that like them, IMO.  New players,
in my experience, find having to memorize what the digits
stand for and always flip to a table to be daunting....

At least I do, and I\'ve been playing for years!

    'body' => 'Hm...in a plot I\'m considering running, players would have reason/need to
perform substantial repairs on a fairly large ship (they have some help), but
I\'d be curious about people\'s estimates on time/practicality of various
alterations.

The situation is that they are stuck on a minor planet (Hefry, in the spinward
marches) with blown J-drives, no ships in-system, and an unstable star which is
expected to flare and sterilize the system in the relatively near future.  Only
one ship has arrived in the past three months, and it had its drives blow out
when it arrived; scout ships which had been in system left some time ago with
messages and there has been no evident response.  The PCs have been recruited
to assist with evacuation....

For this task, they have access to a class C port, the scout base (as noted,
currently no interstellar ships), anything they can convince Hefry to give them
(TL 7 world, not really industrial or fully self-sufficient, but it\'s a vacuum
world so they know something about life support), with the limitation that the
scouts haven\'t _told_ the citizens exactly what\'s going on, on the theory that
adding riots to the mix probably wouldn\'t help.

They also have two large colony ships -- actually, converted TL 11 merchants --
each one is J-1, with enough fuel capacity for two jumps, some 12,000 low
berths (I am letting them run 4/ton; perhaps its a colonizer special), and
about 5000 tons of cargo capacity.  That\'s the good news.

Unfortunately, these ships have been lost for several centuries, and aren\'t
exactly in \'new\' condition.  Tasks which players might want/need to deal with:

The power plants have been inactive for several centuries.  It will take some
work to bring them back on line.  Even if brought on line, they won\'t run at
100%, which will cause uncomfortable brownouts during jump.  This may not be
fixable while here, but they _must_ be brought on line.

The jump drives are almost certainly out of tune, and may not be operational;
they definately need a checkup, and would do better with a full tuning which
can\'t be performed here.

Not all the cold berths work.  About 20% are definately dead.  About 40% look
like they work (based on diagnostics), but might not.  Another 40% have
questionable (or broken) diagnostics, and might or might not actually work. 
Putting people in cold sleep chambers with questionable diagnostics will
probably give a much higher than average chance of dying, so it may be
desirable to go over the cold berths.

The cargo holds are still basically sealed, but the ship was not designed with
sufficient life support capability to transport people in the holds, it just
can\'t recycle that much.  With proper life support and construction of bunks,
the holds could carry as many as ten thousand people (per colonizer bunks in
the world tamer\'s handbook).  About a thousand tons of space on each ship
actually is configured in this way, the rest is not.  The life support requires
a full recharge in any case, it wasn\'t designed to be left this way, and
there\'s some corrosion damage.  This _needs_ to be repaired.

The fuel tanks _leak_ -- roughly 2% of total capacity per day.  While not
crippling, it means that the ship cannot perform two consecutive jumps.  It
would be desireable to fix these leaks, though that\'s probably not currently
solvable.

The manuever drives are only working at around 60% of capacity.  Again, this
probably can\'t be solved at a class C port.

Ok, questions are:
a)  How long do various tasks take?
b)  What tasks am I missing?
c)  How doable is this in the first place?

To be honest, the only solution I see with this scenario, is getting the
colonists into the low berths, then high-tailing it to an outer planet and
staying in the umbra (? shadow the planet casts...) until after the flare
was over.  It would be a better chance than trying to Jump archaic ships.
They have nothing going for them - no industrial base, no source of spare
parts, no repair equipment.

Now, if there were a relic of the FFW, say a tender ship that was fleeing a
battle, misjumped into the system but suffered a catastrophic life support
failure (better yet, the jump grid has been so severely damaged that the
crew died of Jump sickness) that could be utilized, then they might have a
chance...  Assuming, of course, that the old prospector who found the ship
(still worth several hundred megacredits) and has been using it to reduce
his own ship\'s mainenance costs can be pursuaded into revealing the location
of his find.  Damage to the tender is such that only limited life support
can be established, the computers are extremely unreliable - but the
machinery and repair equipment are still online and available to experienced
engineers and mechanics - provided they can work in hard-vacuum
conditions...  ;)

Actually, the propoesed NASA system is not a mounted unit, but a ground
based unit. And not "Pseudo Science, either, Jim. There have been small
scale tests (replicated in three labs worldwide) that show the assembly to
reduce weight on the order of about 2% of object above them, using spring
scales, and also seems to reduce mass, as the demostration when it was
kicked up showed that the balanced mass scale displaced to the side that
was not over the device. NASA was looking to check whether this was a micro
or macro scale event.

In an effort to perhaps get some creative juices flowing for all the

people\'s idea of the best campaign or adventure they\'ve ever played 
or run, and why it was the best. 

The Best Adventure/Campaign You\'ve Ever Played In/Run And 
WHY!

It should be an opportunity for some good conversation, and maybe 
create a new perspective on everybody\'s favorite game, heck 
maybe you can even steal/plagiarize/draw inspiration from some of 
your cohorts.

Sorry, you just died.

Three computers will *only* help if the problem is a *hardware*
failure. If there\'s a bug in the *software* (ie, the programmer forget
to tell it how to handle situation X), then all three will fail
identically.

That\'s why one of the *5* computers on the Space Shuttle is of a
different architecture, and was supposed to have independently written
software. Alas, they managed to crash all 5 at least once, because
while the software was written independently, the programmers had been
using the same (incorrect!) algorithm. 

If you dig thru the comp.risks archives, you\'ll read all sorts of
instances where "failure proof" computer systems failed.

In at least *some* countries, certain levels of safety-critical systems
(like controls for nuclear reactors) use CPUs that are rather
primitive, but which have a "provably correct" hardware design. This
means that they first sat down and designed the instruction set etc as
a set of mathematical equations. Then they went through them and
analayzed the hell out of them until they could *prove* that there
weren\'t any loopholes or unexpected "gotcha"s.

The next step is writing programs that are also provably correct, to
run on such hardware. This is a *major* undertaking, but in the long
run it doesn\'t seem to take that much longer than getting *all* the
bugs out of systems designed in a more traditional manner. 

Once you\'ve got the software and hardware, you have to do things like
prove that the compiler is generating the proper instructions, and that
the CPU and the gear it\'s supposed to control are installed correctly. 

Heck, it could be that the reason it takes so long to change tech
levels in Traveller is that they actually take the time to design out
the bugs in advance rather than "hoping" they got them all.

That\'d mean that for centuries before the "official" change of TL, you
could get higher TL items, or at least "subassemblies". But would *you*
want to trust your lifeto something that crashes as easily as Windows? :-)

Amplifiers (tube) exhibit negative resistance. You put in X volts and
you get out X time 2 volts (or whatever). Semiconductor based
amplifiers do the same with current.

> b)  What tasks am I missing?

Many things on board will have "vacuum welded", even if there wasn\'t a
vacuum. A pair of clean metal surfaces, pressed against each other with
a bit of pressure *will* "weld" together in the course of "a few
centuries". This applies to things like switch contacts, parts
"sockets", etc. Picture trying to work on a PC where the "fingers" on
the card edge of the adapter boards have "become one with" the fingers
in the card socket. :-)

Also, Cosmic ray exposure (or exposure to high energy particles from
stellar flares, etc) over the centuries will add up to the equivalent
of a near miss with a nuke as far as *radiation* damage to electronics
is concerned. So all the electronics (but not the actual *wiring*) on
board is at least gonna be flaky, if not dead.

And semiconductor-based electronics will be in sad shape simply because
the P and N type dopants have migrated across the P/N junctions over
the centuries. 

In fact, if the party is smart, what they\'ll do to the electronics
stuff is just unbolt it, stuff it in a cargo net outside the ship, and
try to find stuff that can be used as "drop in" replacements. It\'s a
lot easier to make a mounting adapter out of sheert metal so you can
replace the old radar with a newer but smaller one than it is to *fix*
the old one.

Once they\'ve got the stuff they can quickly "upgrade" done, then they
need to try fixing the rest. And that\'ll likely involve cannibalizing
the items they replaced. 

> c)  How doable is this in the first place?

I\'d hate to be the folks in charge. But it should be doable. Just very,
very difficult.

A variant scenario that\'ll have many of the same problems to be solved,
but not be quite as stressful would be trying to salvage the old ships
for a collector or museum. 

In this case, they have to try to fix the old gear, and and "upgrades"
they do for the purpose of getting it running, will have to be
reversible and not "damage" the ship. 

The time factor would be the possibility that someone else has found a
sinilar ship in better shape. They only get paid if they are the first
group to turn over the "antique".

This also means that they\'ve got to bribe the port officials, because
the odds are that to keep it properly "antique" they\'ll have to break
or at least stretch some of the spaceworthiness regulations. :-)

That\'s a problem the guys in the emergency scenario *don\'t* have.

As I understand it all the previously known cases required high voltage.

It would be interesting if it turns out that cold fusion, anti-gravity,
and room temp superconductivity all are doable.  Doubtful, but certainly
interesting.  ;->

nothing and perpetual motion, so I didn\'t give it a lot of credence.

This depends on how bad on a disruption it is.  If it is a mild
disruption just announce that it now counts as normal automation or low
automation.  If you use a combat system that given dammage results like
computer minus 1 (a la High Guard) than you can refigure the Control
Modifier (MT & FFS1 term) to correspond with that of the new "smaller"
computer.  Refigure the number of crew needed to adjust.  If your old
high automation ahip had 12 guns & 4 gunners but with low automation it
needs eight gunners than obviously you can only fire half your guns
unless you pull people from somewhere else.  The only problem is you
probably do not have anyone to spare because you have the same problem
everywhere else.  If the dammage has already cost you some crew & you
were already understaffed than you are really up a creek without a
paddle.  So if you are a military (or paranoid) ships architect you may
want to include enough crew to handle the ship when you loose some of
your automation.  On the other hand crew need quarters & life support
which means you have less left over for bigger guns, more armor &
screens, bigger power plants, higher acceleration, bigger computers &
the like which might have helped avoid the dammage in the first place.

Of course if you are a true cynic you will assume that military ships
have lower degrees of automation than is adviseable because lower
automation means your navy needs more crew in it.  More crew need more
officers to supervise them.  This means more promotion slots are
available.  This means _you_ have a better chance of promotion.  If you
were a Naval officer on the Naval Construction advisery board what would
you pick? [Note that I am not saying this simply to pick on the
military, the fact that people tend to behave in this manner is one of
the premises of public chioice theory in political science & is called
rent seeking behavior by economists.]

Well I also consider using the shuttle to launch comsats to be akin to
using a Rolls Royce to move your couch, but thats another soap box.  If
its ground based, is no one considering inverse square??  Still doesnt
work for me.

Also, if its small scale, watch out.  I\'m not a physicist, but an
engineer, so I\'m automatically skeptical of scalings.  Theory and reality
just don\'t match up more often than not.

addressed to make an "open sea" star/spaceport workable?
Wouldn\'t such a platform need to remain out at sea rather than
close to shore to minimize the wave effects from earthquakes,
tsunamis, undersea volcanic eruptions, etc?

A wild adventure hook would be to have a Class C/D mobile
starport on a low TL world attacked by pirates...in a 3-master
flying the Jolly Roger! Of course, any such galleon would become
toasted (literally!) by even a Scoutship mounting a laser but
how about taking on something like a Missouri-class
battleship?

Or having to hunt down and stop the Red October from sinking the
starport?

I *know* the Wet Navy rules from GDW\'s Challenge magazine were
posted to a website. Anybody know the URL?

Well, think about it a minute...the thing is already walking around in body
armor, no lungs, three-and-a-half neurons for a nervous system...not much _to_
break there ;-)

Seriously, most smaller critters manage the pressure differential well, it\'s
all a matter of surface:volume ratio; as that number goes down, you have more
trouble dealing with pressure changes, because the dissolved gases can\'t
diffuse out of your body quickly enough. In fact, the thing that usually kills
them is not the pressure differential, but the temperature one...most
very-deep sea creatures are built for very cold water. These crabs are able to
handle wide temperature diffs.

Also...they looked very much like \'normal\' crabs because that\'s pretty much
exactly what they are...pigmentation is one of the first things lost on
adaptation to a dark environment, witness white or colorless cave crickets,
salamanders and others...this happens very quickly in evolutionary terms, long
before other significant morphological changes occur.

But isn\'t it astonishing where life flourishes? (Witness, the crabs only get
_close_ to the vent, but they\'re feeding on stuff that _lives_ in the vent!)

My problem: Our drink of chooice (after the microbrews go down) is black
coffee, which causes problems right before bedtime.  Also, I don\'t know how
much longer I can play until 11pm oon a weeknight.

Ahhh. Age.  Now I can afford all these neato supplements I haven\'t the time
to play or prepare.  Damn.

Also, Morse code can be sent _silently_. I saw a show on various special
forces (SF, Seals, SAS, etc) and they showed a scout up there 20 meters away
from the bad guys sending his report on a morse key strapped to his leg.

as far as building in lowtech backups, well, for something as complex as a
starship, it\'ll be kinda difficult, because there\'s a limit to _how_ low tech
you would be able to go. Ships controls are pretty much limited, about the
_only_ thing amenable to low tech improvisation would be commo. For that you
need a current source and antenna (spark gap radio), or a light source and
reflector (heliostat) and hope like hell that you can aim it at someone
looking for a signal that low powered.

And _both_ would likely use Morse or the Vilani equivalent encoding...

In fact I see the Vilani hanging on to a Morse type system for _far_ longer.
Not only is it desirably old and traditional, it requires a specially trained
person (caste) to send, recieve and decode it.

One thing that always bugged me...

Is the number of crew listed, other than screens and gunnery, the amount
for three shifts, or just one?  If it covers three shifts, then you could
loose quite a bit of crew and still be cobat worthy.  You may need to move
some DC teams from DC to some other task vital to fighting the ship, but it
can still fight.

Also, using the three shift consideration, you can fairly easily determine
the "on-duty" crew level and possibly even a minimum number needed for
operations.

Finally, would crew requirements be different for a military ship compared
to an equivalent civilian ship?  ie.:  10,000 dtons, J-3, 3G, and staffing
for power based on output or volume of the plant.  IMO, I would think that
they would be different, with the civilian requiring quite a bit fewer crew
members.

YMMV

Not yet.  The "test print" was actually done on a "scrap" hat,
which had other test prints on it; I haven\'t yet purchased my own
yet.  As I said, there are some issues that need to be cleared up
before I will be comfortable actually telling the supplier to go

cleared up, I _will_ get one done and postable.

An Interplanetary Internet Is In the Works

By BRUNO GIUSSANI 

    GENEVA -- "It\'s now time to start thinking beyond the Earth and get
working on the design of an interplanetary Internet." 

Vinton Cerf, widely considered the "father of the Internet," surprised
participants at the Internet Society\'s annual conference on Wednesday by
revealing that work has been under way for the last few months to extend
the reach of the Internet to outer space. 

NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and major telecommunication companies
are involved in the project. 

"The next mission to Mars is now in the planning phase, and it is
important to make sure that the Internet protocols are used in its
communication architecture", said Cerf, a senior vice president with MCI
Communications Corp. 

The project would involve the creation of orbiting Internet gateways to
allow Internet-based communications to flow between the Earth and Mars
- -- or other planets. 

Cerf is a highly regarded figure in Internet circles, largely because of
his role in developing the TCP/IP protocol -- the set of basic rules
that govern communication between computers on the Internet. So the
crowd took his words seriously -- except perhaps when he half-jokingly
said that "one day we may need to create a localized \'.mars\' domain name
to be used in Internet addresses." 

It\'s likely that within the next 20 to 30 years, manned missions to
outer space will become almost commonplace, Cerf said. 

"We have, therefore, to make sure that as spatial exploration goes, the
Internet will be there to allow communication between the Earth and the
scientists and astronauts -- and maybe one day even tourists -- that are
up there," he said. 

The same Internet architecture may also facilitate the control of
robot-based machines used to explore distant planets. Delays and errors
in communication flows disrupted the Mars Pathfinder mission last year. 

"Given the time it took to develop the Internet -- the basic research
started in 1969 -- and considering the fact that we are talking about
putting hardware and software in outer space, we have to start working
on this now," Cerf said. 

In this way, he added, "when we get to a point when we need all the
services we have on Earth, but on, like, Mars, we have an infrastructure
in place." 

Cerf suggested that a likely initial scheme would be to progressively
launch Internet Interplanetary Gateways (IIG) around the Earth and other
planets that will act as routers for Internet traffic. 

Packets of data being sent to a Mars station would, for example, be sent
to the IIG satellite orbiting around the Earth using the Internet
Protocol (IP). After being automatically repackaged, they would be
transmitted to the Mars IIG using special long-delay protocols already
developed by NASA, converted back into the initial IP form and then sent
down to Mars. 

"Think of the Internet as it works today: it is a set of networks
connected one to another by routers," Cerf said. Routers are special
computers that manage and direct traffic flows on a network. 

The new project, he said, "would connect the Earth\'s Internet with Mars\'
using the Interplanetary Gateways as routers." 

But why use a system based on Internet standards? 

One reason is standardization. Until now, NASA and other national space
administrations have created specialized software for every mission. 

Yet IP is rapidly establishing itself as the universal protocol for
digital communications. So why not use it in space? "IP works on top of
any transmission system, and every communication can be made -- and is
increasingly made -- over IP," Cerf said. 

Secondly, Cerf added, there is a cost issue involved. NASA has often
abandoned the special software and hardware designed for a mission after
it has served its purpose. "But if you have a standard Internet
Interplanetary Gateway orbiting around Mars, once the mission is over,
it remains there and can be used again," he added. 

In response to a question, Cerf said that research done to ensure smooth
and reliable communication at low speed over long distances in space
"could help solve the problems of high-speed, high-density Internet
traffic down here on Earth." 

This, in turn, may give the United States the control over an Internet
technology that is several generations ahead of today\'s. 

The Internet Society conference will last until Friday in Geneva. It
will be followed by an international summit of policy makers and
corporate representatives convened to discuss the future of the domain
name system, the Internet\'s addressing standard. 

Ira C. Magaziner, President Clinton\'s Internet adviser, and Robert
Verrue, the head of the European authority responsible for the
development of information infrastructure, are scheduled to attend.

In T4, none.  In MT, Vilani & Vargr, and Solomani & Aslan by Digest Group,
and Alien Module 6: Solomani by GDW.  I have seen all of these available in
auctions, but the DGP items are usually starting at $25 to $30 , while AM6
is usually in the $10 to $15 range for starters.

For biological Vilani, very little.  They tend to be dark skinned (light 
brown; sometimes dark brown to black) and haired (dark brown to black).  Eye 
colour is gray to gold.  And they live a long time.  I picture them as looking 
something like Indians, and are not different enough to be distinguishable from 
the many races of Solomani.  Plus the extensive interbreeding over the last 
3000 years has blurred what distinctions there are.  Only with genetic testing 
can you be sure.

Remember, though, that Vilani is also a cultural designation, and not all 
cultural Vilani are biological Vilani, and vice versa. 

> What book would have fuller writeups?

DGP\'s Vilani & Vargr ("Cogs & Dogs") has the fullest writeup.

  It might not be that uneven a struggle in either case, as such a
facility should have the compartmentalization (if not the armour)
of a Floating Fortress (tm) just to prevent some idiot water landing
a Courier top to bottom _through_ the docks. And if workshops etc.
require onboard power, then they might as well have laser turrets
installed to use it.

  A good model for such a port can be found in Michael Scott Rohans\'
"Run to the Stars".

	Actually, if you\'re a true realist, you\'ll assume that military
ships have lower degrees of automation than merchants on purpose. Not
necessarily to provide more slots for officers, though. Extra crew
provide damage control. They\'re more flexible--you can grab a gunner
and make him fight fires; you can\'t grab an automated targetting
system and do the same. And frankly, there\'s more busy work in a
low-automation system, which means people ARE kept busy. Old cliches
about idle fingers and the devil\'s tool aside, you have to keep
people busy or they\'ll get bored, go stale, find things to do ...
Bored, idle troops have *always* been known to be discipline problems.

	Been there, done that. Do a search on (I believe) SeaSat. It\'s a

Yes, paul, there is: CT\'s _Book 7: Merchant Prince_.

(Sorry, couldn\'t resist). Actually, it is the same system as Bk 7 and Mega
Traveller (it is in the MT Ref\'s Manual). THe wordings are slightly
different in each, and Bk 7 seems easiest to understand.

Howto:
Basically, the idea is that you buy a "Generic Cargo" at a base price per
ton, then sell it elsewhere at a different base, modified by differences in
world types, alligience, and TL.

Freight is different: you roll for number of lots of given categories, then
roll for size of each lot (what is rolled is determined by category: Major,
Minor, incedental). Then, you may roll what the containers contain based
upon the world type they are from, if you feel like it. If the PC\'s take
it, they get Cr1000 per ton.

There is a better system. Bk 2 had a totally different system for
generating cargo. Somebody on the list has done a system for generating
table much like Bk2 tables FOR EACH WORLD. Find a computerized version. It
saves a LOT of rolls.

aquatic ports have one BIG advantage for newtonian drive craft: the water
to soak up the heat is essentially FREE. (Most of the low level "Plume"
from Saturn and Shuttle launches is the water in the pit under the engines,
placed there to vaporize rather than allow the heat from the engines to
melt the launchpad/crawler.) Landing Pads which sit a meter or two below
water line would allow HEPlaR ships to do thrust landings... on
instruments. Just increase the flotation once the thing touches and shuts
off drives (hopefully slowly enough to prevent water crashing into the hull
and causing metal fatigue/failure on the hull).

Maybe. Or maybe on stilts, like the "Semi-mobile" platform some
scandivavian country has for drilling... towable (stilts and all), but not
self-mobile. I\'d suggest several separate sections rather than one big one;
a crash is less catastrophic that way.

Under the MT rules, control requirement is figured on price (table entry)
and TL, and depending upon the referee\'s tolerances for min/maxing, could
be figured item by item. Higher tech requires more control points.

In any case, the benefit is most noteable in case of failures: parts for a
TL 8 radiocomm will be available at almost any TL8-10 world, and generally
can be "Field Equivalent" replaced at higher TL\'s. (They take their off the
shelf stuff, and wire it up to provide the needed function. Usually, this
can be done with space to spare... I know an ET/Ham Operator/Comm Tech who
used TL 7 hand-assembled assemblies to replace the tubes on his VDist
RadioComm-6 {Mass, volume, and ranges matched up pretty well...}; he simply
replaced tubes with tube bases with semiconductors of equivalent voltage
capability connected to the correct pinouts.)

One key case is TL6 vs TL7-8: Vacuum Tubes vs Semiconductors.
_From_what_I\'ve_ _read_, vaccum tubes are no more resistant to shutting
down from EMP than semiconductors of same function, but are able to be
reset and function after an EMP shutdown. Thus a TL 6 craft will recover
from in (FWIR) around 15 to 30 minutes, whereas a TL 7 or 8 craft will take
much longer.

Another case is that simple damage resistance. Under FF&S1 and MT, damage
resistance (in terms of hits which can be taken) is a function of size. The
larger Low TL version is able to absorb more damage. So, take for example
ENIAC and your 286: Your 286 is 1/1000th the size, and 10 times the ability
(or more). However, a .22 LR is likely to cause fatal damage to your 286.
ENIAC, however, is likely to simply lose 1 or 2 tubes, which can be
replaced soon. Yes, this is an extreme example, but illustrates the point.

Mechanical Computing is another sideline for low-mid tech. The BB New
Jersey used a large mechanical computer to do fireing solutions. While any
286 or M68K could do it just as fast, they could not do it if the power
went out. A friend who served aboard the Jersey said there WERE emergency
hand cranks for the Firing Computer...

In one campaign, a player asked to have a mechanical Jump/Navigation
computer. I allowed him to build a TL12, dedicated system, massing double
that of a non-dedicated Model 1... with a hand crank, just in case. He did
use it, successfully, after a bad combat. He\'d no PP, but did have a
working JDrive, and needed out quickly... so he cranked the machine
(several increasing difficulty endurance rolls) while the navigator ploted
the course. He jumped, all right... and even on target. The PC also was too
tired to make the PP Repairs until the next evening... so everyone had to
sleep with Oxygen masks and thermal bags.

Dedicated Mechanical computing first appeared around TL1... with such
things as astrolabes. A mechanical clock or watch is a (Very limited,
analog) dedicated computing device, calulating with addition (counting) and
Division (by gearing), and in some cases checking against a stored value
(alarms and hour chimes). Orerrys (sp???) were astronomical computers,
built origionally around TL4, IIRC.

One side effect (with both advantage and limitation) is that different TL
controls might make certain machines less subject to theft... For example,
how many persons could even get a model T ford down the road??? Many moder
persons would even think to look for the starter crank, and would be
baffled by the spark and gas levers oon the collumn. Under MT, if the PC
was from a lower Tech Band than the device, he took one difficulty level
per BAND (most bands are 2-4 TL\'s wide); if from a higher Band, he took a 1
difficulty level penalty. Both penalties could be "Worked off" but no
mechanic for doing this was presented. I figured 28 uses per level of
skill....

First of all, you need an IRC chat program ... if you are a windows user, I
reccomend Mirc. If use Macs, then I\'m not sure, and if you use a Unix shell
then use irc-II.

Then go to your server list, and select an undernet server.

I dont think it\'s red zoned ... if it is, then UTP is goanna have to
negotiate with the Imperial Authorities to get permission to refuel in the

of the jump-3 route between Regina (the subsector capital) and Efate (the

If it isnt, then I\'m goanna have to rejig the route ... I dont think a

For what it\'s worth, my TL6/9 \'Gosling\' class air/raft (more like
air/truck) has about the same capability as a articulated petrol tanker.
The Gosling is pretty cheap and lo-tech, so I\'d guess it would out-compete
ground transport fairly effectivly, even if it needed occasional imported
spare parts.

There is a lot of fixed capital tied up in road networks, so I\'d say as
soon as contra-gravity is around, road networks would start to decline
rapidly.

My quick and dirty fixes are ...

1) Allow a skill roll against Trader to find cargos that get a TL of *
(i.e. no TL source/market mods). This means you can find exports for a TL-5
world to go to a TL-11 world, to match the high-tech goods going the other
way.

2) Allow a skill roll against Broker to find \'High Value cargos\' - one with
a much higher base price. This makes by-volume transport costs a much lower
percentage of value, thus allowing more trade to be profitable.

After many years of not playing, a small group formed here where I live

up the spot since I ran MT about 11 or 12 years ago, gods has it been
that long, and took a look at the T4 rules and then at the T4 errata and
wondered why they just don\'t publish a book for $30 called Traveller T4

Anyway, I\'ve decided to use the TNE rules....and running through the
combat system I began trying to figure out why a modern day 9mm pistol
with a Pen rating of Nil can\'t punch through TL2 Plate Mail. Not only
that, but a Laser does no better. Unless I\'ve completely interpreted the
rules wrong.....

So, I\'m wondering has anyone played around with the Pen ratings with any
success or failures? I was considering giving Lasers a Pen rating of .5
and then putting in Reflec with an armor value of 4 to 8 vs lasers
only....or something along those lines, that would mean there would
atleast be one other kind of weapon that could penetrate through Battle

And this makes a great model for throwing surprise lifeforms at
players. Simple, not very bright critters can be a *major* hazard
because they are too dumb to know better, and tough enough to get into
*very* inconvenient places before dieing.

Well, for a *good* description, pick up a copy of "Indistinguishable
from Magic" by Dr. Robert Forward. 

Here\'s a crude description. 

You start with a toroidal coil (ie the sort of coil you\'d get by
wrapping wire around a donut by going *into* hole while winding) of
piping. You "pump" the dense fluid through the piping. As it
accelerates, it generates gravity-like forces in the direction of its
motion. So if the pipes come *up* throught the center and back *down*
on the outside, an object sitting in the center will be thrown upwards
with great force, but anyone inside wouldn\'t feel a thing. 

That\'s just one of several designs.

Well, actually the reaction drives won\'t have *that* much of a problem,
but you would want to maintain a flat, stable, *solid* surface for
ships that weren\'t designed with water landings in mind.

The dangers from storms out at sea are as bad as near shore. Sure, near
shore you run the risk of being driven up into the shore. But at the
same time you can use islands or peninsulas to shield you from the
storm. 

A port anchored to the bottom on a continental shelf the way oil rigs
are would be better than a free floating port. The "legs" brace you
against storms and other things.

It work\'s like this. The induced voltages from the EMP simply arc over
inside the tubes, and the tube is operating again in *seconds*.
Semiconductor junctions are essentially tiny capacitors and the arcover
destroys them. 

That\'s why the US military developed what is likely the height of
"tube" design. TIMMs (Thermally Integrated Micro Modules). 

These have tubes the size of a *dime* consisting of a central anode (a
dot of metal), one or more grids (essentially some vertical wires
spaced in a circle around the anode), and the cathode (a metal ring
surrounding all the above). They are capped on the top & bottom with
ceramic, with wires running thru to make the connections. No filaments,
the cathode has a coating that helps it emit electrons at lower
temperatures and the entire tube (actually the entire *module) is
heated!

Capacitors are made of ceramics and metal. Ditto for inductors and
resistors. All the metals used are high melting point alloys. And the
modules are designed in three dimensions. So they are essentially a
solid block of ceramic and metal, with the only spaces being in the
capacitors and tubes. 

The modules are placed in what amounts to an *oven*. And it\'s well
insulated so it doesn\'t take a lot of power to keep it hot enough for
the TIMMs to be happy.

They got part densities as good as the most densely packed pre-IC
semiconductor units *plus* being effectively immune to EMP. 

They were in use in the 60s. I don\'t know when they went out of
service. 

Actually, this is a technology that *should* be presrrved. It\'d be
*perfect* for things like Venus Landers. The surface temp on Venus is
"just right" for this sort of thing. Kepping out the atmosphere is a
problem, but it\'d be a problem for *anything* we send.

And in Traveller, this sort of thing (if it\'s still known) would likely
be used for a number of purposes. It\'s well suited to high temp and
high radiation environments, so it may be found in reactor and drive
control systems. And it\'d be used on those planets too close to the
star to be in the habitable zone, but worth exploiting for one reason
or another.

Heck, put a couple of system defense installations on a Mercury type
world. Solar power is *really* powerful there, and the installation
could shrug off a lot of normally fatal attacks. After all, if your
laser beam dumps in a few megajoules and the sun is dumping in a
gigajoule or two, they may barely notice. :-)

Actually, Eniac was about as bright as an *old* programmable
calculator. I\'ve got an old 8-bit notebook. 8085 CPU, 32k of RAM. The
*mainframe* I used at PCC was mid 60s vintage and only had 32k of RAM
as the *max* it could have. I don\'t think it had the max. My *modem*
has a bigger CPU than that old notebook (heck, I\'ve got one modem that

It was also an *analog* computer. Analog computers can be superior to

Slide rules are mechanical *analog* calculators. Another such is a
gizmo called a "nomogram". It\'s essentially a chart with different
scales across the bottom and sides. You lay a straightedge between
numbers on the side and the bottom and where they cross a line on the
chart (possibly even a curve!) is the answer. They got used a lot for
time/speed/distance type calculations before calculators. 

Hmmm. It just occured to me that a lot of tables in the various design
sequences might be a lot easier to use as nomograms!

Anyway, you should be able to do a fair amount of real space navigation
using a "sextant"/telescope combo, a circular slide rule with some
special scales, a few reference works, and some nomograms set up for
the purpose.

As an example, a nomogram would have a side scale labeled "angular
diameter" and a bottom scale reading "planetary diameter". You\'d
measure the planet\'s angular diameter with the scope, look up the
actual diameter, lay your straightedge across the appropriate points on
the two scales, and read your distance from the planet from the chart. 

Simple, quick and easy. Especially since the chart would likely be a
"disposable" item like the old "plotting board" templates I\'ve got. So
you could mark the planets diameter with a red pen or something on the
one scale and that\'d be one less thing to look up when you make the
next sighting.

BTW, you may have noted from the above the main feature of analog
computers. They give quick, *approximate* answers. But often
"approximate" is good enough. For example, those mechanical fire
control computers on the New Jersey got the first round close enough
that it required only a minor adjustment to get the other eight rounds
on target.

And even if you know about the spark and gas settings, the odds are
rather strong that you\'ll *not* drive the car away. Instead you\'ll be
sitting there with a broken thumb! You see, the engine tended to kick
the crank *backwards* rather forcefully when it finally started. If you
were holding the crank in the "normal" manner this would likely break
your thumb. The *correct* way to do it has you placing your thum
alongside your fingers. That way the worst that would happen is that
the crank would jump out of your grasp and bash your knuckles a little.

Best bet is a series of "platforms" supporting landing pads in the area
between them. Simplest case would be three platforms supporting a
runway and some landing "pits":


                         +--+
                         |  |

= <- runway
* <- blast pit

Have the "field" supported by floats with something to buffer the wave
action (which can be used to generate power). And if there\'s a storm
coming, ships are all launched, and enough floats flooded to allow
"sinking" the platform to below the wave zone (say 30-60 meters down).

There\'d be cargo transfer docks along the outside.

Done so. You can visit a new VIP page at my website at
http://www.uni-koeln.de/Ancients (now member of the webring.)
There will be some other changes to it the next time.

I also got 300 dpi print scans of the portraits, but did not link to them.
You can load them by adressing them directly with \'name.gif\' at the page,
but be careful, they\'re somewhat bigger (zoom factor x5)

Another addition can be found on the Software Page: I added (finally!)
.eps versions of the logos. There\'s only one .gif left, which also can be
looked at on the page.

Hope this will help and be taken fancy for.

I will also try to complete my TNS archive by the weekend, it then has got
all the articles from 1105 to 1130. And I\'ll work out an alternate
GURPS-Timeline file. (Finally it is out, yeah! But I\'ll have to wait a
month or so until my FLGS finds another distibutor in America - yeargh!)

I hope that my other projects come along too in the near future.

Pumping high gravity fluid through the torroid won\'t do that since the
torroid would presumably be filled with this fluid.

A slight variant would be a series of dumbells that pivot at the center.
The ends of the dumbells would be gravity dense and would offset their own
weight.  Arrange these in a circle around your launch platform.  Now you
rotate all of these.  Since gravity drops off with the square of distance,
the pull from the near weights is greater than the far weights thus
producing a net acceleration.  Of course this only produces pulses of
reduced gravity and it would be much more efficient to throw the object
using physical contact.

The first thing I though of was the submersible platform in (I think) "From
Russia With Love" that the Bad Guy used.  It would surface, a big dome
opened to accept the helocopter landing, then submerged (presumably to hide
it\'s location?).

A Subersible Starport would have the advantages of mobility - place it
where the weather cooperates, or the glacial ice doesn\'t reach in winter.
Or perhaps it is above a submerged habitat (as would be typical on a TL10+
water world).  This allows "dry" landings for vessels and brings them to
the city/region served by the \'port without the problems associated with
submerging starships (which should be few anyway, but perhaps we are
optimistic).

In any case it should provide some interesting scenery.  "Your ship
approaches what the radar tells you is a bare patch of ocean.  \'Are you
sure this is where the transponder signal is coming from, Harry?\' Asks
Selden, officially the Captain.  \'For the third time, Yes I\'m sure\' Says
Harry.  As you begin the final approach procedures water starts to bubble
and froth around the patch of otherwise unremarkable ocean.  A massive set
of four bent legs emerges from the depths, followed by a domed platform.
As the legs extend, raising the platform clear fo the water, the dome\'s
clamshell doors begin to open, revealing a standard landing grid
\'crosshair\'.  The guidance beacon signal is suddenly much stronger..."

There may IYTU need to be a reason for raising the landing platform (or
whole starport) above the water.  If Weather doesn\'t tickle you, recall
that the Earth\'s own oceans are mildly caustic, and submersion will lead to
even the most durable materials to pit and oxidize due to the salinity.
Imagine, if you will, an ocean with a high sulfur content (leading to a
dilute solution of Sulfuric Acid).  Harmless in short exposures, but
potentially disasterous in a weeks time.

They would also have a high demand for hydrocarbons to make plexiglass and
plastics, or silica for glassmaking.

Dave,

I agree with you on this, but it means we need a combat system that
encourages combat ships to have spare crew.

Crew are pretty volume-intensive, unless you are double-bunking them. On
the other hand, they arent particularily massy, and mass is usually more of
an issue than volume in warships.

The other major issue is economics. Almost all sea shipping is currently
built at about one, maybe 2, TLs below current \'state of the art\'. The
technology that goes into, say, a Kortnaeur frigate just doesnt go into
your average Korean-built cargo ship. If lower tech does the job at a
cheapest price (including maintainence), then it is probably going to be used.

I really need to pull my finger out and post the TL8/11 Far Trader -
everything except the jump drive and t-plates is TL8, which means you can
pay for about half the cost with TL8 credits.

Well, historically plate armour tended to be 16-18 gauge steel, so I\'d be
quite happy with it between me and a 9mm bullet at anything further than,
say, 30 yards.

Very late plate got \'proofed\' against musket balls ... fire a musket at 10
yards. If the bullet goes thru, put it in the \'seconds\' bin. If not, sell
it at full price.

Of course, less honest armourers heated up a bit of the breastplate and
thumped it with a hammer and claimed it was really proof.

To cut a long story short, IMO 9mm pistol bullets should be stopped by plate. 

Lasers are a different issue - plate was traditionally shiny, which could
well reflect the laser (leave the surcoats at home, lads ... white armour
cap a pie).

One issue I have with Traveller is the way that TL6-7 anti-tank weapons
blow the crap out of battledress. A Boys anti-tank rifle should not be able
to give an Imperial Marine more than a very bad headache.

I\'m not sure.  I *have* the files (I believe a complete set).  They used to
be in one of the archive sites, but aren\'t at either MPGN or Joe Heck\'s
site.  The files I have are at home (and I at work) so it may take a few
days for me to get them here (Memory problems I fear) but keep bugging me
about it and I\'ll send them.

I will also send them to the first 50 people who volunteer to put them up
on their Web Site (I think its safe to assume Rob Dean would allow this).

Thanks for the praise.  Feel free to pass it around; I wouldn\'t mind 
hearing any suggestions.  The unformatted, original text is at

 http://www.ima.umn.edu/~bonnevil/traveller/sublight.txt 

The guidelines come straight from using stock QSDS propulsion (the
fusion rocket, HEPlaR, and thrusters) with the relativistic rocket
equation.  A carefully built ship can make it up to ten or twenty
percent of lightspeed at coast without too much trouble; however,
there\'ll be more fuel by volume than even a jump-6 starship has.

I\'d love to see a tech-11 ship that could make the 80% of lightspeed
seen in _Imperium_.  With thrusters, it\'d need a mass ratio of 9.
(That is, for every 9 metric tonnes of starship, 8 are fuel and only
1 can be anything else.)  As a comparison, a tech-9 ship using fusion 
rockets (under FF&S1 fuel consumption rates) would need to have a 
mass ratio of 1000 to get the same performance.  Fusion rockets do
fine in the ten to thirty percent of lightspeed range, though.

Since a meson gun are supposed to be used to move mesons through any

that the same is true for meson communications.
	would it then be possible to use your meson communicator to target a
smaller object and have the same detonation effect?  Most meson guns are
spinal or bay mounted, but could the communicator be used with the same
effect but at a much smaller scale?
	A smaller scale you say?  Yeah, something like a human target.  Someone on
a Zero-G space walk who get\'s a little to close to the sensor and/or
communications array.  Could the mesons - if intentionally set - be
directed at the small target (say maybe the heart or maybe the lungs,
stomach, diaphragm, or even the brain) of a human or other life form.

Add to that a fuel shuttle and another tender with 2 scouts

just for good measure, add an SDB squadron for protection.

Now, with all those people there, and ships rotating on and off

hollow it out and outfit it with minimal thrusters and decent

Maybe the Navy coddles their people on-station like that, but
I don\'t see the Scouts adding on so many frills to every system
where they have a presence.

The multiple tenders, shore leave facilities, shops, taverns, etc.
sound more like a Scout _Base_ to me, or perhaps an X-Boat
Way Station. A Scout Base might rate it\'s own SDB squadron,
but an X-Boat Tender and a couple of fuel shuttles? They get
their own squadron?

Between Way Stations on an X-Boat Route, the only Scout
presence might be the X-Boat Tender and a couple of type-S
Scout Ships and some Fuel Shuttles. Granted, they\'ll have 
5 gun turrets to protect themselves with, which may be more
than some corsairs want to tangle with.

No, it does actually work in a "steady state". In general relativity, 
extremely massive rotating objects have tend to drag objects near them along
with their rotation - "frame dragging". The moving fluid on the inside coils
of the torus will tend to produce a gravitational field near those coils that
will accelerate nearby objects in the same direction the fluid is moving. 
To get a noticeable effect, as Leonard says, you need something as dense as
neutronium, but that\'s an engineering detail. 

I wouldn\'t call it antigravity - just clever manipulation of existing
gravity. (Kind of like the fact that you could cancel our Earth\'s surface
gravity by parking a big neutronium disk right overhead that pulls you up
with an equal force.)

I did that once ... the way I did it was I designed it under the MT rules in
all of its configurations.
then I used a special figure and forget rule of mine.. it takes one action
to change from configuration A to B and from B to C and you have to go
through B to get to C from A and vise versa.

The Rules for walkers are in the books so they are legal. so battle tech
mechs work in system.
the veratech thing is my own creation and yours too.. so it can be any tech
level after that or share the tech level it did in Macross.
also add a couple of credits to the design for the varibleness..

Ok, ok...you have the Scout service, which goes out and actively
_recruits_ your average MacGuyver type.

 Now you\'re going to stick them off in some backwater with a starship
tender, parts, and _nothing_ to do???

There\'s _NOTHING_ more dangerous than bored scouts....;-)

They\'ll have their Zero Gee paintball arena, all right....and it won\'t

Now don\'t get me wrong, I like Robert Forward, he\'s smart guy, but he\'s a
physicist, not an engineer.  The trouble with such schemes is that they
are assumed to be a system, a control volume for you control system
types, that is assumed to be unrelated to the rest of the universe.  If
such a system is indeed cut off from everything else (ie, in its own
universe, totally alone) then energy is conserved, and it works.  The
problem is, conservation of energy requires 2 things.  

1)  There are no outside forces acting on the control volume.

2)  No work is done within the control volume.

The problem is, there ARE forces acting on the control volume, and it IS
doing work, by accelerating some mass.   Personally, my opinion is that
we might be able to find some way to accelerate masses without tossing
mass out the back of an engine, we still will have to spend some energy
somewhere, and we still won\'t be able to just circumvent gravity, and we
still can\'t ignore momentum, so no ships doing 10,000 g accelerations
while we have
tea and cakes.

Anyway, such is my professional opinion.

Grin.  There are three different "current timelines.

0-200.  Milieu:0, the offcial setting for Marc Miller\'s Traveller.
1200.   RC/Regency.  The post-Imperial setting for Traveller TNE.
1120.   An alternate setting for GURPS Traveller where strephon wasn\'t
assassinated.

Virus was the uber weapon that was supposed towin the Rebellion.  It was
supposdedly an artificially intellegent computer virus with two orders:
infect everything you can reach, then kill humans.  The story had Virus
being released during a major battle, infecting both fleets, and destroying
the Imperium.

This is possibly the single most debated topic here.  Some people take the
"It\'s a good story, and we can\'t predict what computers are capable of at
TL16"; while others hold to the "it\'s bloody stupid, and self-contradictory
in many places" school.

Since the offcial universe has sort of petered out while we waot for Marc
to finish T5, it\'s really up to you.

No wonder you\'re confused...T4 is set 1100 years _before_ the events in
MT, and the \'virus\' thing was all in the supplements in between,
Traveller:The New era, which _was_ the advancement of the MT timeline.

so we have the following timeline:

	Foundation of the Third Imperium (T4) Year 0
		|
		|	
	Classic Traveller	(vague, but was up to ~1110 or so)
		|
		|
		|  <----|
		|		   |
		|		(Gurps Traveller "It was a bad dream 		|		Strephon had" parallel
universe)
		|
	MegaTraveller	Rebellion 1116-1120-ish
		|	<-Virus happens here, in 1120
		|
	Traveller, the New Era Rebuilding 1200-

Without starting a flame war, Virus was a doomsday weapon developed by
Lucan\'s side in the war, a sentient, suicidal, self-reproducing AI that
could inhabit and take over any sufficiently advanced computer or
network, using any available entry point to that computer or network. It
was released by accident, before it was controllable, and that pretty
much ended the war along with civilization as starships crashed
themselves into cities, powerplants blew themselves up, and generally
all electronic devices went beserk.

The New Era is set after all of this has settled down, the Third
Imperium is a shattered, dead hulk, and pockets of humanity are starting
to spread to the stars again.

T4 is set in a similar, but less destroyed time. This time humanity is
moving outward again after the thousand year Long Night between the
Vilani Empire/Rule of Man (1st and 2nd Imperiums) to found the Third
Imperium.

Vargr have _always_ been accepted as Imperial citizens within the
Imperium. In the Rebellion, one of the Archdukes, Brzk, was Vargr, the
last of a long, distinguished line of Imperial Nobility. Their
distribution through the Imperium was decidedly skewed coreward, toward
the Vargr Extents.

tc passed the draft to Andy Lilly, who is editing it at the moment. This
one is getting a fine tooth comb (much like Governments) as it has a lot of
potential to undermine the goodwill the earlier work generated.... tact....
that\'s what we\'re working on...

I would anticipate it late August / early September..... around GenCon UK.

If only I could win the lottery and put a million or so (UK) aside to fund
a small gaming company for the rest of my life ;-) <sigh> Then I could do
this full time and get supplements out faster..

Hmm. I think there is one called Galactic, and the Dulinor Suite had a

Someone else here can probably tell you where to find them...

Once you\'ve done this once you should be able to order the next time

I recommended Leisure Games because they are the mail order firm I use
quite a lot, and are reliable (in my experience).

Apologies if this (telephone/faxing) is a problem for people -

In forward\'s system, as it accelerates whatever goes into the center of
the torus it does indeed use energy - presumably this manifests as the
neutronium dust circulating in the torus slowing down, and if you want to
use it steady-state you have to keep pumping the dust to accelerate it more.

Galactic only generates the star system per se, just main world, stellar, gas
giants, etc.  It doesn\'t generate every planet in it, which is what SB is
looking for.

worlds (new version with 1201 worlds just uploaded to
http://www2.dk-online.dk/users/mark_seemann/worlds.htm ), I discovered a couple
of interesting things.

While comparing the worlds from Survival Margin with the dgp-updated sector
files, I found a couple of new world names, as well as a couple of typos. This
will probably not come as a surprise to the list members, as the dgp-updated
sector files were incomplete and rather \'raw\'.

Now, I could just adjust my own files (already did that) and let it be at
that. I\'m not going to, though.

Looking through the HIWG sector files then, I see that a lot of names has been
added there.

Let\'s take Dagudashaag (dagu1120.nsc) as an example. The old dgp-updated file
(dagudash.sec) had maybe 95% unnamed worlds, yet the HIWG file has all worlds
named. Where do all these names come from?

I suspect that they were created by HIWG especially for these files, although
there may be an other explanation. Not that I\'m going to complain about this -
I think it\'s a good project that saves us other people a lot of time.

I have one little issue, though: The canonical worlds mentioned in Survival
Margin has other names in the HIWG files, probably because those names weren\'t
known at that time.

Again, using Dagudashaag as an example, 3227 is called Manshuruk in Survival
Margin (p. 39), yet the name in the HIWG file is Namkigem. I think Manshuruk
should be accepted as the canonical name.

I suggest this: The HIWG files are updated with the few new names I\'ve found in
Survival Margin. I would happily do this myself, but, naturally, I don\'t have
access to upload to the HIWG web site. What does the HIWG members say about
this?

For your reference, this is what I\'ve found (the page reference in paranthesis is the place in Survival Margin documenting this):

1109 Diaspora should be Libert, not Liberty (p. 18)
0140 Daibei should be Aston, not Gaalorn (p. 25)
3227 Dagudashaag should be Manshuruk, not Namkigem (p. 39)
2038 Dagudashaag should be Gracilis, not Ya\'uiya-ko (p. 46)
1430 Gushemege should be Neola, not Xerxes (p. 46)
1711 Ilelish should be Pharsalus (this one was unnamed) (p. 58)

I\'m waiting for the looting to finish.  Hopefully, it\'ll take the input from a
Galactic or TravTools file and dump to seperate text files...

I\'m not pissed at him, I\'m pissed at UMR.  I fired up their web page to get
their fone number and called them up to bitch about it.  They said the problem
seemed to be that one of their machines dropped off their intranet and the
mailer was bouncing everything back to source.  I told them to go buy a copy of
the Sendmail book, read it, fix the damned mailer, and be *DAMNED* glad I don\'t
sue them for a denial of service attack.

Idiotcy cranks my blood pressure up to somewhat hazardous levels sometimes.

ObTrav:

You land at an out of the way place, a bit off the beaten path.  Your computer equipment isn\'t *quite* compatible with what the locals have.  When your chief moneyman logs into the planetary datanet, a harmless \'fetch the stock market quotes\' instruction gets translated to \'crash the stock market\'.  This locks up the planetary datanet tighter than the Imperial treasury.  The locals come out branishing torches & pitchforks.  To make things worse, your engineer has pulled the head of your powerplant to fix a minor problem with the secondary enrichment bypass valve and it\'ll take him 20 minutes to reassemble it.  Of course, he won\'t get the chance to recalibrate or realign it in that time...

On my second question, perhaps I should reword.  In earlier systems, large scale conflicts provided good backdrops for
adventures (e.g. vs the Zhodani.)  I was wondering if there were any such conflicts in the "current" timeline (which is
Milieu:0 or 1200, I guess.)

I don\'t allow it IMTU. Simply put, a MesonComm puts a few hundred eV/cm^3
(if even that much) on target, while a MesonGun puts a few Million eV on
target. This is done, in both cases by relatavistic accellerations to
control decay locus. The energy comes not from particle impacts, but
particle decay around the locus of decay. A commo unit also aimes for a
large, even distribution (several dozen meters) versus the minimum decay
zone for a MesonGun. a Commo unit recieves by monitoring other

OTOH, I have had players use it to scare troops by virtue of radiation
warnings.

Current Time Reference is dependant upon ruleset and subset in use.

Baselines for materials, by edition of rules
Classic Traveller (Little black books): 1050-1115, in support materials. No
official time in rules themselves.

MT: 1117 from basic set.
MT + Hard Times: 1120-1130
MT + HT + Survival Margin: 1130-1200

TNE (Traveller, the New Era): 1200-1220 in various materials. Regency
Sourcebook would allow some use all the way back to 1100

T4: 0-20 in various materials, baseline for campaigning is around 20.

GURPS Traveller: post 1116, without the rebellion.
all dates in Year of the Imperium (IY)

the Virus is a (IMNSHO) half baked idea for a Domesday weapon, which
dulinor accidentally releases in later 1120\'s early 1130\'s by raiding one
of Lucan\'s research station. It is an AI program, adapted especially to the
semi-sapient chips used in imperial transponders since 1110 or so. Said
chips can pass the virus along to the connected computer systems. they get
the virus from radio contact, physical contact, or direct link-up with
another infected system. Said virus is supposed to be homicidal and
suicidal, but due to replication errors, it mutated into many strains. It
also depopulated the imperium\'s remnants in the period of 1130\'s-1140\'s,
from which it took 60-70 years to recover.

Depends upon WHICH timeline you\'re using. GT will have a different setup
than MT, MT+HT, MT+HT+SM, TNE+RSB, T4.

Not sure, but I\'m hoping for the variety of era books that supposed to come
out for T4.

The one I really want to see is Arbellatra\'s Regency, covering the period
from the tail end of the Civil War (620) to just after Arbellatra\'s
coronation (630.)

This decade is just ripe with possibilities in the Imperial Core.  Nobles
scurring to fill power vacuums, hunting down and trying war criminals,
getting caught up in the search for a legitimate heir, IMHO, this could be
one of the better products for Traveller.

Tech Level would be solidly 13, with some experimental TL 14 showing it\'s
head.  An interesting campaign might start with the PCs being part of
Arbellatra\'s Restoration Fleet, fighting the last few battles of the war.

No. <g>

Mark hasn\'t said whether we\'ll be in Milieu:0 or some other time period.

Personally, I\'d like to see M:0 done *right* before we move on.
However, I can understand the desire of some people to put as much time
and distance as possible between the next version of Traveller and M:0.

BB Iowa\'s used a Mark 1 Able(Mk 1A) dedicated analog FCS, before radar
systems were put in use. Mk 1A used synchro\'s, resolvers, and control
transformers. I was trained to use and service analog systems like the MK
1A, you had to zero the synchro\'s et all periodically, shudder shudder, the
time used to do so...... Basically the system took the range data from the
range finder(later radars), bearing of the target, target speed and course,
firing ship\'s speed and course, data from the ship\'s gyro\'s etc, then the
operators turn dials using crank-like handles. They are selecting data to
input like range to fire, etc. The faster the operator inputs the variables
the faster the ship could *accurately* engage the target(s). But when it
boils down the analog FCS are just specialized calculators not anywhere
near a computer. By the way I was in LBNS when the BB New Jersey was being
refitted there, got to go her several times. Big does not truly give the
idea of her size.

The MK 1A used two different crank settings one course, the other fine, ie
you pulled the crank up or pushed down depending on which you wanted. I
would put the mass of a analog jump computer at about 4 times the mass of
digital computer, but the number of variables needing to be entered ie

In this design you *are* expending energy. You have to accelerate the
the fluid. And *keep* accelerating it. And you\'ll need more energy if
there\'s a mass being launched than if you are just doing a "static
test" with no mass in the center.

I don\'t know *where* you get the idea that this requires isolation from
the rest of the universe.

Mecha aren\'t workable at *any* TL. They violate the square-cube law
(which is based on *geometry*, rather than physics, so forget the
arguments about "maybe the law is wrong").

In essence, if an object\'s linear size is multiplied by X, its areas
all increase by X^2, and its volumes increase by X^3.

Which means that while cross-sectional areas of supports go up by X^2,
the *streses* (based on the *mass* of components, which is a function
of volume) go up by X^3. So if it\'s X times bigger, everything has X
times the stress. Which means either that it\'s X times more fragile, or
needs materials that are X times stronger.

So, a mech that stands 20 meters tall is either 10 times weaker than a
human sized one, or requires materials that are 10 times stronger.

If you make the support members thicker, you wind up with something
that\'s not at all humanoid long before they get thick enough to handle
the stresses. 

Also, the extra moving parts required for "shape changing" massively
increase the number of failure points and possible failure modes.
Consider how much less reliable the original F-111 swing-wing was
compared with contemporary aircraft. They finally got the problems
mostly solved, but it\'s still extra complexity and more ways to fail.

That\'s a different device. This one works because of forces generated
by *accelerating* the fluid. Those forces don\'t exist in the "steady
state". 

The forces are related to gravity waves, not to "dragging the metric". 

Sort of like the difference between an electrostatic motor (which uses
static electrical charges) and the electromagnetic motors we are more
familiar with (which work due to the magnetic fields generated by
moving charges).

Re-read the above. The fluid is being pumped thru pipes *wrapped
around* the toroid. And the effects are due to the *acceleration* of
the fluid, not merely the motion. So you have to operate in a "pulse
mode, as the fluid rapidly approaches c!

Except for the fact that using gravity rather than physical contact
means that all particles in the object are accelerated *equally*, thus
resulting in no acceleration stresses.

The scheme you describe is the "smoke ring" system. You get the same
results by using solid *rings* rotating rapidly (the limiting case is
to somehow have a dense toroid rotating "inside out"). But not for the
reasons you state. The rapidly rotating mass "drags the metric" along
with it, thus causing gravity like forces.

However, meson comms can be used in other, interesting, offensive ways.

You should read part of the TML PBeM archive (at the URL:
http://www.ssgfx.com/traveler/archive).  Read Turn 2 from 1993, Parts
3 and 4.  One of the resident genuises aboard the good ship Elissa uses
a modulated meson beam to "kill" an attacking pirate ship.  By aiming
the beam at the cores of the attacking ships twin fusion plants, he
causes a severe enough fluctuation in the power flow that the plants
both scram, and cripple the attacker.

Pretty damn clever, if you ask me. :^)

Nope. Consider the difference between a laser comm unit and a weapons
grade laser.

For communications *microwatts* is an acceptable signal strength at the
target. For weapons, you need Megawatts. That\'s a difference of 12
orders of magnitude (ie 10^12 or one quadrillion).

The communicator just doesn\'t have the power.

There are many sensor and communication devices that are dangerous,
though. Notice the "Laser Source" warning on your CD-ROM drive
innards? Not to mention the way a radar dish can cook an unprotected
person pretty quickly.

They mention this in the "Smoke Test" chapter of _Arrival Vengeance_,
btw...a static discharge fries the commo unit and maneuver pack of
a crewman doing a hull inspection, Arrival Vengeance can\'t turn on her
sensor suite to find the drifting Starman because the sensors will surely
fry the guy as soon as they find him.

Hmmm - what effect does a several-AUrange radar dish have when swept
across a boarding party in battle dress at a range of a few meters, at full
power? Sometimes it can _suck_ to be a Marine...

Anyway, He\'s not talking about using a Meson communicator to blow someone\'s head off, just cause a heart palpitation or seizure - effects
that, properly placed, could be done with millivolts of energy. The only
problem is targeting - how do you blip the fifty-third neuron on the
left with a meson commo pulse inside a moving soldier?

 Depends on material science and the reaction times of whatever makes the

It looks like the thing that would keep this from working from a physics
standpoint is the mass of the apparatus generating the repulsive field. 
Even if the liquid could be rapidly pushed to c, it\'s own apparent mass
would create more attraction than repulsion.  

My $0.02 worth of my physics education.

I hate to tell you this but I think I\'ve found another bug. In the cells relating to 
the area of ECM gear (M124 - M129) the formula looks for the folding array flag 
in the H column when the flag is set in the G column.

SJ Games News: GURPS Traveller To Press

   By the skin of our teeth, GURPS Traveller made it out of here today,
   one day behind schedule. It was almost two days . . . I got in the FedEx
   door at 9:29:57 or so, just as they were closing it. Every time that
   happens, I say "Gotta QUIT this!"

   So it will PROBABLY still make it to the stores by mid-September; we
   now need for the printer not to have any problems, because we have used
   up our slack. Watch this space for updates.

   Big thanks to everybody who made this come out: print buyers Monica Stephens
   and Melissa Brunson pressed into service as proofreaders, copiers and
   indexers, Alain Dawson slamming the art in there, author Loren Wiseman
   tweaking (or adding) sidebars until the very last moment, and most of
   all Jack Elmy and Gene Seabolt, doing Quark layout with one side of the
   brain and editing with the other. We couldn\'t have done it without you.
   Shoot, we wouldn\'t be US without you . . .

Well...hey, that\'s not a bug! It\'s a feature! Yah, that\'s it! People across

Ahem. Sorry about that. Version 2.9 with the ECM folding array problem fixed

The real question is; \'why make them at all\'.  Battlemechs/Mecha/etc are
fun in a game sense, but from a military and tactical standpoint they are
too fragile to outweigh their value as weapons platforms.  Traveller, being
a \'hard science\' game, doesn\'t really have room for battlemechs in any
\'real\' battles.

Forex, Take that 50mm autocanon you were about to put in the arm of your 75
ton walking armored hulk and put it into a good sized grav tank instead.
Your grav tank has, at the same TL, better manuverability, lower
detectability, is more easily transported, more heavily armored, easier to
manufacture, isn\'t going to sink into the mud (unless you land it) and is
most likely cheaper (last is hard to judge without mech building rules).
There is such a huge advantage of the tank-like weapon system over the
mech-like weapon system that there is simply no  reason anyone would build
a mech like weapon system.

The one venue I can think of is if there is a competition industry, like
car racing or pro wrestling, where such machines are built (relatively
cheaply) with "play" weapons (underpowered lasers, non-penetrating
autocannons) for mass consumption in the media.  It could also be set in a
"high honor" culture where such machines are the tools of the code duello.

The other aspect of this I will encourage is "small" mechs.  A single
soldier in powered armor is a concept that can be somewhat enlarged in the
squad support role.  I envision marine drop squads having 5 standard
powered armor suits and one "heavy"; a powered armor 25% bigger, carrying a
six-pack of guided missiles and some sort fo heavy, direct fire weapon in
its arms [FGMP+?] (which a standard suit would not be able to handle).

Of course, how many times in *your* campaign do the players encounter a
full marine assault drop?

IYTU you may, of course, use mechs at the length of your desire, but I
think the standard/canon/typical traveller universe leaves them out for a
reason.

Actually it can be _more_ secure, as my wife found out one time. She was
booking a flight with an airline one time, and got to chatting with the person
on the other end of the line, who was quite happy to waste time doing so,
since he was doing it. Time that is...the phone operations had been contracted
out to the Colorado State Board of Prisons. In one fell swoop, a convicted
felon got her name, address, card number, when we were leaving town, and how
long we would be gone!

Nothing happened, of course, but I\'ve _never_ worried about sending my CC
number across e-mail ever again.

I did one of those up some time back. It was limited to working on ships (or
any combination of size up to that) in several huge bays. It was staggeringly
expensive. I don\'t remember if I actually posted it or not, so here goes.

(note this isn\'t the Mt size class you\'re looking for...but it\'s certainly a
flying starport)

Something I realized just now...the discussion we had recently of importing
vs. manufacturing jump drives is somewhat invalidated by concepts like a QSDS
ship...built of stadardized plug \'n play parts.

Description:

The Hephaestus is a large, jump-capable QSDS shipyard, capable of
constructing, simultaneously, 9000 Td of ships at a time in its specially
modified spacious hangars. Unlike most space-based ship construction and
repair facilities, the Hephaestus maintains a shirtsleeve environment for the
entire construction process, greatly improving both construction crew
efficiency and safety. Large cargo areas adjacent to the construction bays can
store the parts required to build 1 of the maximum size ship the bay can hold.
It is anticipated that the Hephaestus will be re-supplied on a reqular basis.

Anticipated missions for the Hephaestus include advanced mobile shipyards to
support Naval, Scout and civilian needs for repair and reconstruction at the
far reaches of the Imperium, and for rapid upgrades of starports to class B
and C. A multi-year lease on a Hephaestus is considerably cheaper than
building a starport, and can generate revenues to support expanding trade in
remote areas while ground-based starports are financed and built to take it\'s place.

The specialized nature of the Hephaestus allows it to assemble QSDS
componentized ships at a rapid rate. The record for assembly of a standard
200Td Far Trader was in 097 by a crew aboard the Vulcan, which produced the
ship in 5 days.

This far trader is on display at the headquarters of Thorim Shipyards, the
original manufacturer and designer of the Hephaestus class, which is probably
a good thing...it is doubtful that a ship built in such haste would have fared
very well in regular service.

Still, there are a number of these huge ships operating in and out of Imperial
space, generally on lease to planetary or multiplanetary governments
attempting to provide a local shipbuilding presence.

What\'s it\'s purpose?  The vehicle will be at least as expensive as an entire
numbered fleet, so you\'ll need a good rationale for it to be built.  To make
it, you\'ll need to tie up the entire yard of a large pop-A world for several
years as well.

In TNE, at least, you\'ll need to be aware of surface area limitations.  The
jump drive requires surface area.  As ship volume increases, it turns out 
that surface area needed by the jump drive rises faster than the increase 
in surface area; there\'s a limit on how big a jump-capable starship can be
built because of this.  For a sphere, the worst case, a jump-6 drive uses
up all the surface area on a hull 256 meters long (636,000 tons).  A jump-1
drive uses up all the surface area on a hull 900 meters long (27 million
tons).  You can avoid this for a while by selecting a non-spherical
configuration, but eventually you\'ll run up against it again.  I haven\'t
looked at FFS2, but this probably also is true in T4.

Considering how expensive the jump drive is, you\'ll probably want to put
in the smallest one you can that still works for the port\'s mission.

Anyone else have practical suggestions?

Um...wrong.  If you double the strength of materials (without doubling the
weight) you can construct an object of twice the linear size.  You can build
mecha, you just need materials with higher strength to weight ratios than human
flesh and bone.  This is not actually all that hard, you could build medium
sized armored mecha (battletech-sized) with TL 7 materials, though they\'d be
breakdown prone and you\'d need better control technology than is available at
TL 7.  Now, the really super-sized mecha are a problem with the square-cube
law, but a battletech sized mech (which is less than ten meters tall, and tends
to be rather squat) isn\'t really that bad.

Which is not to say that mecha are a _good_ idea at any TL -- compared to a
comparable tank, a mecha will be (a) less armored, particularly on the front (a
human-sized object has far more area which needs to be armored), and (b) have a
much higher profile, making it significantly easier to spot and shoot at.

This might be a help for anyone porting that plethora of \'C\' source code
on the TML CD....

Apple\'s now offering MPW for free download, which means...at
last...there is a freely available C and C++ compiler for the mac. While
the MPW is a primitive programming environment compared to Metrowerks
(so I\'m told), it would work to get Q&D ports to the Mac.

for that see:

MPW, MacApp and other development tools are there.

Well, one of the reasons a Mecha are better than Grav-Tanks at least in my
mind is the fact that they can have more weapons pointing in the same
direction.  That gives me a sort of a pause, plus think about it this way,
you are a common, average, everyday soldier & one day as you go out to
fight, you see a 40\' tall mechanical giant.  What would you do?

Maybe, in some situations, but there are some that Mecha would be better. 
City combat, forest combat, etc.  As for putting a 50mm AC in a mecha, are
you nuts.  Plasma Weapons.  High Damage, no ammo to carry.

Um, right now, they are in a war between the Eldar Confederation (my own

Right now, I have based the ECs mecha on Macross II, Macross +, & Macross
7.

Maybe, maybe not.  Remember Loren said they left out Spherical Grav-Tanks
because at the time, he did not want them to be laughed at.  Plus, the fact
that Mecha were not well known in the US in 1977.

Mostly, I was thinking about how ships in warfare might not be able to be
repaired at a shipyard you have just taken because of battle damage, plus,
it would make a great adventure idea.  One of the 3Is mobile starports have
been stolen & the players have got to find it & take it back.

Hunker down behind the hill, sneak around to the back, and blow the hell
out o one of the mecha\'s knees with a LAW. Once it\'s down, stick a
satchel charge in it\'s ear and kill it.

Get it running toward me and that antitank mine I\'ve conveniently put in
it\'s path.

Get it running toward me and that trip cable I\'ve got strung up.

Call in an artillery strike.

Call in an air strike.

On the other hand, grav tanks, which are _much_ better described as
"Apache Helicopters From Hell" would give me nightmares...

Actually, yes, ammo to carry.(look up plasma weapons in FFS or
FFS2...they have cartridges that are used as \'ammo\') 

A small grav tank will fit perfectly well into city warfare, and the
forest that will allow your 40\' giant room to run around in is not much
of a forest, actually. Lots of space for grav vehicles to get in there.

In a city, you can have literally thousands of ground troops scattered
throughout the buildings with anti-tank weapons. Mecha will get
slaughtered in that environment...they\'ll be in a crossfire from
somewhere _all_ the time.

Ground troops will run for hidey holes too small for the mech to look
into, and rig snifty items like triplines. Remember Luke taking out the
Imperial Walker? that is a rather good tactic to use. A mech, with it\'s
forward facing and bipedal stance, can\'t turn that quickly; a decent
grav vehicle will run rings around it, and that is the name of the game
for close in air support, boyo. Your mechas are dead, dead, dead.

Don\'t EVEN get me started on what meson artillery will do to them.

The reason they win in cartoons and mecha games is that the rules have
been changed to make it so they do win.

_human_ sized mecha...AKA battledress is another thing entirely.

	Have you figured the ground pressure a mech would put on its 
feet?  They\'d be confined to starport tarmacs and bedrock because they\'d 
sink in anything else.  The M1A2, the heaviest modern tank, has a ground 
pressure (mass/SA of tracks) of something like 6.5 tons/m^2.  Anything 
more than that and it would wallow like a pig in muddy or loose ground.
	Even if you came up with a material that was so light and so 
strong that it made mechs feasible, that material would still be better 
employed on a tank.

	IIRC (I don\'t have my books open), the meson comm doesn\'t have the
exact targeting that a weapon has. Rather than trying to cause the
mesons to decay at the receiver, you send a beam *through* the
receiver, where a spin-off of the meson screen causes them to decay.
You don\'t have to have nearly the range accuracy that you do for a
weapon.

That\'s a major vulnerability right there that grav tanks don\'t have.

	Pleas explain how a large, clumsy, 40\' humanoid in a city or forest
and having it try to operate in the restricted environment is more
efficient than a grav tank, which for the same weaponry is going to
be much smaller and maneuverable ...

It\'s the *attraction* that\'s generating the "push", or rather the
*change* in attraction.

The problems with this design are purely engineering. :-)

What are the phone numbers there like (in international format)?

+61 ??? ?????

The reason I ask is that there may be some fidonet systems there, and
that might make it possible to route the list to you (if they are
willing to handle the extra traffic). It could easily be cheaper,
because fidonet links zip up even *mail* when bundling it for transfers
between systems. That cuts down transfer time drasticly.

Even if there *aren\'t* any fido systems, you might want to consider
becoming one, because then you can just use *regular* phone calls to
exchange data. You\'d just have your system calling one on the mainland
once a day. At a guess, it\'d take less than 5 minutes to send out all
your outgoing mail and receive all the incoming. Then you read and
reply *offline*.

Personally, I am a big fan of jeep-sized grav vehicles with a battery- or
cartridge-powered laser. The small size means they can hang out in packs,
and one of them will get a hit in on the big nasty grav tank.

Speaking of Apache helos, has anyone built any TL7 aircraft and helos ?
Famile Spofulam may have to go down-market, and re-equip some A-10s with
grav technology, and replace the nose mounted autocannon with a laser ...

Actually, even when you fix the rules in favour of Mecha, traditional
troops can still win. Battletech doesnt allow aimed shots to be anywhere as
easy as they should be, but a combination of AC-2 armed aircraft and/or
helos, numerous infantry with command-detonated bombs as mines and adequate
artillery support deals with mecha but good. No expensive fusion engines, too.

>_human_ sized mecha...AKA battledress is another thing entirely.

I\'m not even certain about that. The basic problem is man-portable
anti-tank weapons, whether Boys ATRs/crunch guns, Sagger or similar ATGWs
or the good old trusty bazooka or RPG. High tech armour is pretty wussy in
Traveller - TL12 superdense is a mere five times more weight efficient than
TL5 hard steel, which means battledress has to be pretty damn thick to
protect against anti-tank weapons impact.

If you are prepared to lose tactical mobility, some sort of mountain gun or
short-barrelled 30mm autocannon in concealment could have a role as well
(with cheap grav trucks, operational mobility isnt a problem).

To work, battledress needs some sort of integral anti-missile defense, or
conventional troops will pepper them with rocket-propelled grenades and
such. Sensor signatures could also be an issue - you could spoof the mark 1
eyeball with chameleon coatings and such, but powered armour needs a power
source, and that means IR and probably other emissions.

My suspicion is that the very long operational range of grav vehicles would
lead to ground warfare being much more like naval warfare - essentially,
mobile self contained task forces with no \'front\' per se. Current armour
has an operational range of 100km or so, neccessitating a front to defend
rear-echelon supply and repair facilities. Grav tanks, especially fusion
powered grav tanks, dont have
these restrictions.

I suspect that ground troops will be in unpowered chameleon-coated sharpnel
proof armour, armed with rocket-propelled grenades and communicators to
call in support from the grav tanks and artillery (although given that
cluster bomblets make a nice mess of just about anyone under Striker, it is
actually possible that ground troops will just get a communicator, some
rockets and ballistic cloth armour. And an entrenching tool and a chameleon
blanket, of course).

You need it as a repair yard close to the front during wars. And in
peacetime, it\'s useful for "bootstrapping" facilities on worlds in a
newly added territory. It might also be of use in disaster relief.
Consider the fun if your starport gets hit by a *major* natural
disaster. It could take months or even *years* to rebuild. So you
appeal to the Imperium, and they send one of these out to "fill in".

This is where "folding radiators" and weird things like "liquid drop
radiators" come in handy. The ship gets to the jump point, shuts down
all non-essential systems, deploys the radiators, and proceeds to start
up the jump drive. 

I seem to recall that the j-drive does most of the power-using stuff
getting *ready* to jump. If you work it that way, you would want to
design the radiators to retract "fast" (ie in less than the 15-30
minutes you can keep the ship on the edge of jump safely). That way,
your displacement is back to normal before you enter jump.

Yah, but as long as it protects from smallarms you\'re gaining something.  The
basic mission for powered body armor isn\'t being a tank, it\'s allowing infantry
to carry NBC protection, thermal masking, protection against fragmentation and
smallarms, and a standard mission load, without falling over gasping from
exhaustion.  Make that cheap enough (well-trained infantry costs something like
100k, so if 100k PBA can double their effectiveness you\'re doing OK), and it\'s
easily an advantage in infantry missions, which are usually in very complex
terrain (such as cities), where at least 90% of shots aren\'t going to hit
anything anyway (with suppression fire, make than 99.8% or so).  Anti-armor
munitions are usually too heavy to use for suppression fire, and are a weight
problem even as a standard semi-auto weapon.

Remember, a human is a 100-200w IR source.  Powered armor could easily have a
lower signature than a human.

Powered battle dress with gauss rifles could probably slaughter huge numbers of
such troops.  It depends a lot on the price/reliability of powered battle
dress, though --it probably isn\'t worth more than about a 5:1 force advantage.

I don\'t "do" C. I\'d be interested in a Pascal (prefereably Turbo Pascal
compatible) or a BASIC. And an assembler would be nice too, though I\'m
sure I can find a free 68000 assembler on the net. It\'d be the
interface libraries that\'d be the problem. That and the fact that I
prefer to program in a high level language and reserve assembler for
places where it improves performance (or where it lets me work around
language/OS limitations).

So, anybody know of a *free* Pascal or BASIC that\'ll run on a Mac Plus?
How about a *really* cheap one?

It\'s actually a lot harder than you think. Human bone (when fresh, as
opposed to dried out) is stronger than steel by quite a bit. That\'s one
of the big problems with building joint replacements. 

And there are limits to material strength. Buckytubes look to be about
as strong as you can get. And they aren\'t *that* much stronger than
graphite (carbon) fiber.

At 10 meters tall it\'s 5 times the size of a man. And a 2 meter tall
"mech" (read protype robot) that\'s as strong as a human is pretty squat
to begin with. So unless you can come up with something 5 times as
strong for the same weight, it\'s gonna be ugly.

The only "mecha-like" device that the military has ever shown any
interest in was the "walking truck". Which has four legs, and a low
profile. 

It\'ll be interesting to see if when such a thing is finally put in
service it uses 4 legs and is "directly" controlled by the driver\'s
arms and legs, or if it has 6 (or more legs) and is controlled by a
joystick input to a neural net adopted from insects.

I rather suspect the latter. And in fact, it might be possible to have
semi-autonomous "trucks" that follow the course track they are given.
For example, picture something the size of a large dog or a pony (but
lower to the ground) that can cross a battlefield to resupply troops
who are pinned down. 

If such a unit gets hit, no problem, just send another. You can salvage
it when the lines advance enough. If you have to retreat, destroy it in
passing. 

But having "rover" delivering fresh ammo and other supplies (MRE\'s,
medical gear, etc) could be a common sight. Each squad might have a few
attached to it. They could lug extra gear on patrol, and be sent back
for resupply without reducing the combat strength of the unit.
Obviously, they need some sort of "homing" method. Given that they\'d be
based on insect models, scent markers might be good. But spread
spectrum radio would work too. Probably a combo of inertial guidance
(to record the path they\'ve followed so they can retrace it), scent
markers, and radio for cases where you *don\'t* want it retracing it\'s
path, or taking a "direct" route would be used.

Although I\'ve never tested it, I thought it would be neat to fully load a heavy
mech with machine guns.  Something on the order of a hundred guns going off at
once.  You gotta expect at least ONE will be a golden BB. The trick is getting
into range.

Non-transformable mecha are <looks in MT Ref\'s Manual- design sequences>
TL8+, for leg transmissions. So that Raidar X and Mac II  are around TL10,
due to the small fusion plants. Under FF&S1, works much the same. FF&S2,

I\'d put transformable mecha around TL 15... simply due to materials tech.
But this is just a SWAG.

Damn, John!  What in tarnation are you doing posting _this_ under

   Wouldn\'t build a mecha without a damn good IR sensor suite and lots of
anti-personnel weaponry.  Get within 50 meters and you\'re swiss cheese.

   This is a problem for all ground based vehicles.  On the other hand,
grav vehicles must be careful not to fly above terrain features for too
long or they meet a similar fate.

   Grav vehicles are indeed superior to mecha, but only because they give
you superior operational mobility (they can go anywhere you can fly, and
they can almost always get there faster) and armor protection (mecha
generally have thinner armor because thick armor makes them too slow).

   OK then lasers.  I\'d still like to have some .5 or so Mj plasma or
fusion weapons of the quad barrel, rapid fire variety to take care of those
pesty roaches (guys in battledress).

   My mecha look more like spiders--low to the ground and about the size of
a grav tank or smaller.  Two legged artifical giant samurai just aren\'t
practical.

   This would also be true of any vehicle.

   Make a town too much trouble and the mecha will flatten it.  Hiding
amongst the ruins they would be rather formidable though admittedly they
would have to lie in ambush for any passing grav vehicles and then clear
out or face the same problem the infantry did.

   Also, tripping a spider-like mecha would be darn near impossible.  All
your infantry are going to accomplish is pissing off the drivers.

   A spider-like configuration would be extremely difficult to get around on.

   Or to a grav vehicle...

   That\'s because 11-20 year olds like to see giant artifical samurai going
at it at close range.  There are actually hand-to-hand weapons for mecha in
Battletech--something even I find totally silly.  

>_human_ sized mecha...AKA battledress is another thing entirely.

   Battledress equipped troops are excellent for shock value and can wipe
out non-armored infantry equipped with gauss rifles (or lesser weapons).
The problem is that when they run into enemy troops that have rapid fire
energy weapons at their disposal, battledress equipped troops die just as
fast as the non-battledress equipped formations.  A proper high tech army
would have mix of armored and non-armored troops, grav vehicles, and
support vehicles.  Mecha?  Not in anything resembling the Battletech or
Star Wars style.  Mecha are probably going to be support vehicles,
spider-like and (if you are using FF&S I) capable of short duration flight
through Heplar thrusters (this would increase their operational
effectiveness dramatically), and armed to the teeth with a variety of
ordinance and sensors--they aren\'t intended to stand toe to toe with a main
battle tank (grav or otherwise) but can kill one if they get a chance.

Nope. Because it *still* has to radiate that 100-200W or else the
trooper inside fries in his own juices. *Plus* it needs to get rid of
the energy generated by the power plant.

Quite a bit if they fold out from recesses in the hull. Also, by proper
design, the channels for the working fluid can be collapsible so as to
save space when folded.

Say that when deployed they are *only* 10 cm thick. That means that
very 100 square meters of radiator is .74 displacement tons. Then
figure how many 100s of square meters you nedd for that huge ship.

Maybe I\'m missing something in the change from MT to the current flavor of
design, folded or not, they have the same volume.  

Was there a change from MT to FFSv.X?

Not nitpicking, just curious.

No they don\'t. Remember, volume includes *enclosed* space. So for
example, if the fluid channels fold flat when not in use, they they
take up less space than when they are deployed and said channels are
opened into pipes.


Flat: =======

        /\\
Open: /    \\
      \\    /
        \\/


And if they just fold into slots in the hull, the volume of the slots
counts even when the "fins" are extended. 

> Was there a change from MT to FFSv.X?

No idea. This is a simple matter of *geometry*. A cargo bay counts as
volume whether it is full or empty. So a similar "bay" that the
radiators fold into still counts even when the radiators are unfolded
and outside the ship. But at that point the volume of the *extended*
radiators *also* counts.

Anti-Personnel Cluster Charge with Motion Detectors.  Say bye-bye to one
guy with a LAW, but then you can kill a tank with this same tactic, so what

  Laugh (from behind hard cover, admittedly).

  Almost anything can be rationalized (I certainly have with `mechs, just
not on this list), but you can\'t change their target/armour profile; they
simply can\'t be anywhere near as survivable for warfare as we (and the OTU)
understand it, using Trav materials.

  Which doesn\'t change their availability for essentially non-combat uses.

Actually, Battledress, IMTU, is NOT intended for survival against anti-tank
weapons. Rather, the useage tends to be in the anti-infantry role, and in
the equivalent of light armor-cav: fast attacks against non-heavy targets.

I use BD and Combat armors as the equivalent of APC\'s/AFV\'s (as the terms
are used in modern US military parlance): a means to get infantry to
survive long enough to fight AFTER the heavy armor, AIr Support, and Arty
wipe out the obvious hard targets, but before "REAL INFANTRY" can move in
to mop up and control the area. I also have them used in arreas where the
hard shell protects against expected possible blast/fragmentation and
hostile environments, especially starport tarmac.

I also use the bounce infantry concept: Grav-mobile battlesuits with some
anti-tank weapons carried, for fast, high speed, high dispersion rapid
response. Since the BD-14 and BD-15 units can use the FGMP-14, and integral
grav belts, and give the user a useful operational day of nearly 18-20
hours,  bounce infantry scout units are fast, efficient (they can make more
out of terrain than any other hardened unit), and carry sensors equivalent
to most light AFV\'s, they can flesh out the light recon BEAUTIFULLY.

IME, IMTU, Battle Dress and Combat armors at TL13+ are fairly resistant to
most small arms fire (enough that it extends the combat lifespan from under
a minute to around 5 minutes in large engagements). This is based upon
experience with both TNE and MT, and under MT both the large scale and
personal scale combat systems. They are just as subject to annihilation by
armor when directly targeted as unarmored infantry. Danger-space secondary
effects are MUCH reduced; non-direct targeting is unlikely to actually take
out BD armored troops, whilst being able to anihilate unarmored infantry.

[still IMTU:] This "Secondary Effect Damage Reduction" makes a small cadre
of BD troops very useful in most ground ops where there is some cover. The
Regiments of Armored Infantry in the imperial marines are specifically
beach-head-establishment units, and as scout units for theater operations,
but not the mainstay of the battle lines. Grav Armor, and grav-mobile leg
infantry (Grav APC mobile) are the bulk of the line troops in MTU\'s
Imperial Military.

In short, use the equipment for what it does best, not what it was designed
for! No amount of armor will make a Battlesuit the equivalent of a Tank.

under MT, I have found BD-14 with Gauss Rifle superior to TL-10 CES with
Gauss Rifles by over 10:1...when 100 troopers in BD take on 1500 in CES
using the SAME weapons system, With the BD being elites and the CES troops
being borderline veterans, already entrenched in the city ruins. Troop
levels assumed using the skill levels based upon AHL/Striker standards.

In TNE: A PC was knocked unconscious while wearing BD-12. THe PC was KO\'d
by a M60 from T2K weapons book- by the 1 pip per die effect. It took three
turns of full auto fire, using the rules as written (d6\'s for damage, no
sudden death), with most of the KO being faceplate hits. The PC was able to
get close enough to hand grenade the 60-gunner. The PC was hit with 1/2 of
all rounds fired by the m60; all shots were at Close range for the M60, as
the combat was aboard a ship.

Chipmunk Basic (freeware, IIRC) is a mumblesoft basic port (line numbers,
separate graphics window) for Mac and PowerMac. It also hase some
concessions to Applesoft compatability. Also supports some sprite
graphics... as well as morse code output.


SCBasic is freeware, Toolbox using, structured basic environment. NOT USER
FRIENDLY for coding toolbox calls, but powerful. Runs fine on 68040 and
68030; donkt know about 68000. Also FatBinary, IIRC. Has some problems with
the built-in (default) I/O windows... supports up to 20 separate code
files. Requires use of ResEdit or equivalent to create GUI components.
SCBasic is written in SCBasic. The SC stands for Self Compiled. I can\'t
find the Author\'s site, but I\'ll zip it up and send it direct if you want
it (and I can still find it on my PB).

Again, since my worst machine is an \'030, I don\'t know how they will run on
your Mac+.

This comes down to doctrine, I think - essentially you have to move away
from \'spray it with lead\' and towards more of a sniper mentality.

I would have to play with FFS2 to get a definitive answer, but I suspect
that you could build a fairly effective man-portable fusion bazooka. The
next question becomes what range to build it for ... a kilometer sounds
about right.

True, but a human would be easier to mask than a human plus power source.

We really need some hard numbers on the actual thickness, cost and so on of
Battle Dress at various TLs, so we can crunch out cost-effectivness of
countermeasures.

My long-forgotten Striker memories are also telling me about the
maintainence demand for battledress with all the toys - all those sensors
and electronics are creating a longer \'tail\'.

The doctrine would be dig in, conceal and squeal for help when the
clamshells turn up. It\'s a defensive doctrine, but thats all anything
without 3cm of composite laminates should be doing anyway IMO.

This has the problem that big meson-gun equipped low-gee waships have in
Traveller - if they get into range, they kill anything. But they cant get

If you are a grav tank, you can try and hide under trees. You also have

Ummm, plasma guns dont have to use explosive power generators (and lasers
can use chemical cartridges), but it saves you from using massive volumes
of accumulators. Accumulators are the real bitch with energy weapons, the
actual weapon and power source arent the problem.

This is why tanks stay away from towns. Warsaw cost the German units
involved 25% of operation armour ... and that was against an enemy with
next to no anti-tank capability.

First catch your pigeon. How do you propose to flatten the town without

Outlaw The Solution ! We *need* a 50m minimum length for meson guns at
TL11, dropping by 10m per TL thereafter. Just say No to TL11 man-portable
Meson Guns !

My preliminary designs couldnt build a rapid-fire man portable gauss gun in
FFS2. If anyone has a design I\'d be glad to see it.

First of all, use contragrav rather than heplar. It\'s cheaper, lighter,
smaller and puts out less of an IR signature.

Secondly, if the ordinance and sensors cost the real money, why not use1

That makes your mecha far more similar to conventional tanks, with modern
armor tactics. The TL equivalent of A10\'s and AH-64\'s are going to give you
headaches. Granted, unsupported ground troops are going to be creamed by your
mechas...which I\'m picturing as moving something like the Bugs in Starsh*t
Troupers (the movie)...fast and agile, only with guns.

nasty, yes, but like conventional armor, your \'legs\', be they legs or tracks,
are your weak point. If your mecha are going to be fast, they have to be
light, which means less armor.

Except grav vehicles could stay _above_ the city, which gives them the
advantage of firing from the high ground. Granted, trying to take a city in
the face of determined resistance is _extremely_ difficult, no matter what
your equipment level. There\'s a reason that some of the nastiest battles of
WWII were essentially extended street fights, going house to house rooting one
side or the other out.

>    Make a town too much trouble and the mecha will flatten it. 

Just nuke it from orbit then. Don\'t risk _any_ assets. Flattening a city
removes the reason you\'re there fighting house to house in the first
place...if you\'re doing that you want the city reasonably intact.

Not with a strong net it won\'t be. My tactics were also specifically aimed at
the statement \'you see a 40\' tall walking samurai\', which is what Legate is
talking about if he\'s referencing Macross and Battletech.

>    A spider-like configuration would be extremely difficult to get around on.

So is anything with a turret, which I\'m guessing is how your spider mechs
would be designed. Your mechs far more closely resemble tanks with legs
instead of tracks, not the traditional bipedal mech.

The problem with more armour is higher ground pressure unless you expand the 
surface area of the tracks/feet.  This is because the extra armour weighs 
more, and thus needs a heavier power supply to get around the added weight.  
Unless you add some antigrav modules, you\'ll rapidly run up against the wall 
of diminishing returns.  And if you add *any* antigrav modules, you might as 
well go all the way and make the mech a grav tank like you should have in the 
beginning.

The main reason the Allies did house to house fighting was because they wanted 
to preserve as much of the cities they had to go through.  If this wasn\'t a 
concern, they could have firebombed them just like they did to Dresden.

Exactly.  The burg has *something* you want when the fighting is over, and 
you\'ll pull your punches.  This means, when you get down to it, you\'re gonna 
be taking it with grunts.  The main theory behind mechas is that they\'re a 
more articulate tank and can get in & out of areas a conventional tank has 
problems with.  The downside is, they\'re just too vulnerable to survive.

If you only deploy mechas in areas where they\'re almost sure to survive, it 
means you\'re limiting them to like TL2 targets or less.  What are these people 
gonna have that\'ll justify you taking them on in the first place?  Why bother, 
since advanced biological warfare is good up to like TL8 or 9?

Somebody said something about the Germans losing 25% of their armour units in 
areas where there was practically no anti-armour capability.  This is 
ridiculous.  If there was practically no anti-armour capability, they would 
have lost most of these units to stupid things like friendly fire.  I don\'t 
see this happening much.  Now, if the poster meant practically no 
*conventional* anti-tank capability, I could agree.  The fact is, the tanks 
*were* taken out other than with friendly fire.  This means *SOME* anti-tank 
capability, like, say, Molotov cocktails...

\'You see a 15 meter tall walking samurai\' means you have a BIG EASY TO HIT 
target.  Damned little survivability given the technical restraints needed to 
provide said survivability.  Standard 3I battledressed grunts were *not* meant 
as a replacement for grav tanks, they were intended as heavily armoured highly 
survivable *infantry*.  They can hide in places that are reasonably man-sized. 
 Can\'t do that with a mecha.  And even the high tech aspects of Desert Storm 
showed you *STILL* need grunts with guns.

If it\'s gonna resemble a tank, take it the rest of the way.  Anything else is 
just expensive targets for the bad guys to take out.  If you want infantry, 
*design* infantry.

    'body' => 'Hi,

I spent all afternoon thinking about Milieu 0...what I liked, didn\'t
like, and would like to see done with it...and writing this as a reply
to someone.  When I finished it occurred to me that I should post it and
see what you think.

    ----
    
I thought Milieu 0, and the M0 Campaign book showed promise, but it just
didn\'t *do* it for me, somehow.  For one thing, it was aimed more at
politics than I liked, but that wasn\'t really the problem...politics
*had* to be involved and politics gets dirty.  Well, I was hoping for
more exploration and recontact, and by recontact I don\'t mean subverting
local economies and governments, either, ;-> but that wasn\'t all of it
either.

The problem was, I think, you put both too much and too little in the
book.  _Milieu 0 Campaign_ tried to cover a subject that just didn\'t fit
in one book.  In the space you had, you were only able to focus on one
the kind of campaign and even then not as completely as you could have.
I realize you mentioned that other sorts of campaigns were possible, but
it was clear where the focus was when you wrote in _Milieu 0 Campaign_
that "all roleplaying is political, to one degree of another."

Seems to me, Milieu 0 should have been setup a little differently.  I
wouldn\'t drop the politics.  I wouldn\'t even de-emphasize it, but I\'d
approach it a little differently.

What I would do is contract the size of the Sylean Federation, constrict
the time period Milieu is going to cover, and expand the space to tell
the story.  

I suggest Milieu 0 cover the 60 years from -30 to +30, and
at the beginning of Milieu 0 make the Federation a compact, sub-sector
sized, state...bigger than its neighbors, but not much bigger.

This means we begin with the final maneuvers leading up to Cleon
establishing himself as Emperor and the critical early years where he
defends his position and the Third Imperium expands beyond its central
"core."  That Cleon *will* succeed in founding the Imperium or that he
(and his offspring) will succeed in surviving as Emperor can be in doubt
as players campaign in this period.

It also means that the *survival* of the Federation/Imperium would be in
doubt if several of the neighboring states combine against it.
Diplomacy becomes more than a way of expanding, it becomes a tool of
survival...as it should be.

Then I would make sure that several different *kinds* of campaigns are
described and detailed.  Some political and underhanded, some noble and
pure. Maybe, something like the following...

Campaign Type One -- Securing the Imperium

During the Milieu 0 period, the Sylean Federation/Third Imperium is only
a subsector sized "empire" in the middle of the Core Sector.  The rest
of the Core Sector contains pocket empires and independent systems,
several of which are *real* challenges to the Federation/Imperium\'s
survival.  This campaign type would focus on politics, intrigue, and
military actions...both internal and external...as the Syleans and Cleon
secure their position as *the* Imperium and as the Emperor.

  ---- Sub-Campaign:  Securing Our Rightful place in the Imperium
  
Internally, the Syleans of Cleon\'s generation are working out if there
is going to *be* a new Imperium, then working out the structure and
"pecking order" of Imperial leadership once there is one.  This
involves political maneuvering and, very likely, other less polite
techniques.

Players would work for (be members of) a faction (family) vying for
power and influence inside the power structure, first of the Grand
Senate then of Cleon\'s court.  Depending on just how dirty you want
politics to get (and I don\'t have a problem with it getting very dirty)
you\'d see everything from assassinations (real and character) to
seduction...with blackmail, extortion and financial manipulation in
between.

They could also play citizens of a neighboring empire working against
Sylean (or Cleon\'s) interests, either before or after the founding of
the Imperium.

  ---- Sub-Campaign:  Securing the Imperium\'s Rightful place in the
                     Galaxy
  
Externally, the strength of the surrounding Empires would have to be
"reduced" to protect the Imperium, and the independent systems would
have to be given a reason to join the Imperium.  This would involve
political, economic and military actions.  

Players could work for the Imperial government as diplomats/spies or
military personnel, they could be citizens of one of the competing
Empires resisting the Imperium, or they could be merchants from either
side caught in the middle and just trying to make a buck.

  ---- Sub-Campaign:  A Pirate\'s Life
  
This would be a period where empires (including the Imperium) might well
secretly commission privateers to carry out economic raiding in "enemy"
and contested territory.  The empire could always say publicly, "We know
nothing about these pirates you\'re complaining about, besides it isn\'t
in *our territory.  If there was, or if you were in the *Imperium* you
wouldn\'t have these kinds of problems.", but still allow them to use
local ports, "Why not, they haven\'t committed any crimes in *our*
territory have they?"  The very same technique could be used by the
Imperium\'s opponents...it probably was given Cleon\'s "anti-piracy"
spiel.  It puts a cute twist on things if the Imperium was behind much
of the "piracy" they "wiped out" once a system or area joined, though,
doesn\'t it?


Campaign Style Two -- Expanding the Envelope

Space beyond the Core Sector is unknown territory to the Syleans of
Milieu 0, but the Syleans are gripped with a spirit of exploration and
are striving continuously to push back the darkness.  This is the
campaign for the people that want to play Scouts, Scientists and
Exploratory Merchants, a campaign filled with exploration and discovery.
The characters in these games aren\'t especially concerned with the
intrigues and power struggles of the "core", instead they are constantly
pushing outward to contact new worlds for the sake of knowledge,
adventure and profit.

  ---- Sub-Campaign:  Survey and Contact
  
First the Sylean Federation Scout Service then later the renamed
Imperial Interstellar Scout Service was formed to explore and survey
systems and contact the inhabitants if neighboring regions.  By Milieu 0
they have explored to the edges of the Core Sector and are moving beyond
it into the unknown.  Behind them the Federation/Imperium is
consolidating it\'s position within the Core Sector, but *most* of the
Scouts are looking outward not inward.

The players play Scouts who are assigned the mission of exploring in a
sector bordering on Core and preparing the way for the diplomats,
merchants and military of the Imperium who follow a few years later.  Or
they play Scouts assigned to found, defend and develop outposts and
colonies on a world.  They might be aware of the politics and covert
activities of other branches, but that\'s not *their* mission.

  ---- Sub-Campaign:  Pursuit of Knowledge
  
Archaeologists, academicians and scientists are very interested in
exploring as well.  Lost cities, bases, and artifacts are the life\'s
blood of archaeology. just as new species of animal and plant are for
the biologist and system data is for the planetary or astronomical
scientist.  Some of these scientists stay at home and analyze data sent
back by scouts, but many of want, even *need*, to go out themselves.

The players can play the scientists in search of the new, novel, or
lost, they can play the spacers that transport the scientists, or they
can play bodyguards for the scientists.  This sort of game could run
inside Core and interface with the political and military intrigues, or
outside Core and deal with the dangers of the totally unknown.

  ---- Sub-Campaign:  The Early Bird Catches the Worm
  
The more adventurous often travel beyond "known space" (Core) in the
hope that they will be the first to find and exploit resources they find
there.  Merchants hope to find new products and markets from which they
can make fortunes.  Mercenaries and Adventurers hope to find territories
in which they can acquire fortunes and power.

The players can play Merchants exploring beyond Core, finding, opening
and developing new products and markets.  Out beyond the intrigues of
Core they have a chance to form their own trade companies and develop
them before the Mega-Corporations of the Core enter the area.  

Or they play "retired" technical or military personnel that hire own
with lower tech systems to train the locals and run the higher tech
systems they (or merchants) bring in.  These retired characters can just
as easily be mercenaries hired by merchants, adventurers, would be
conquerors, or local governments either on straight combat tickets, as
the professional cadre of local forces, or in trainer/advisor/commander
roles.  They could also be hopeful conquestidors seeking to build their
own empires.


Now, how would I organize it for publication... 

Instead of doing one big book, do three.  There is enough material and
it allows each book to maintain a strong focus.

Book One: _Cleon\'s Vision: Rise to Power!_ 

  Time period -30 to 30.  This is the book for all the political,
  economic and military maneuvers.  It would cover when Cleon is setting
  things up to found the Imperium, and then the rise to (and falls from)
  power by various factions within the Imperium.  In addition to
  background events, this would be the place for all the rules for the
  dirty tricks and the skulduggery of political infighting.  Maybe
  careers for Politician, Diplomat, and Spy would go here.  The
  political and economic structure of Sylea, the Federation, the
  Imperium, and an *overview* of all it\'s neighbors would be in this
  book, too.
  
Book Two: _Growth of the Imperium_

  Time period -30 to +30.  This is the military, diplomatic and economic
  maneuvers that the just founded Imperium took (and had taken against
  it) as it expanded out to control the Core Sector.  This is were you
  put the rules for military actions, and the rules for covert and
  diplomatic "initiatives."  Here is where the military forces of the
  Core are laid out.  It would also contain details of the Imperium\'s
  strongest early competitors.  I\'d also include the piracy/buccaneer
  angle in this book with complete rules and a career for Pirates...or
  Privateers, if you prefer.

Book Three: _Pushing back the Night_

  Time period -30 to +30.  This is the system creation, development and
  exploration book we didn\'t get in T4.  < grump ;-> I see it as a
  combination of _Scouts_, _Merchant Prince_, _Mercenary_ and _World
  Builder\'s Handbook_.  Yes, that sounds like a lot, but the basic
  creation systems for all these kinds of characters and the basic world
  creation system would already be in the Main Book, so I think
  everything else would fit into one book.  The book could present
  advanced trade rules, exploratory trade rules and system creation
  procedures.  It could detail what Scouts do and how they do it.  It
  could give the details of forming and campaigning on colonies.  It
  could explain the different types of Mercenary tickets and how to run
  those kinds of campaigns.  It might even be a lead in to a book on
  building economic and political empires (ala Pocket Empires II).
  

I think a 3 book set could adequately cover the types of campaigns we
would want to play in M:0.  The rules within the books could be written
generally enough to be useful in any milieu or alternate campaign
without skimping on the background that most people find useful.

Comments would be appreciated.

The problem is that infantry started to be issued with anti-tank weaponary
down to squad level back at TL6. You have to be able to deal with them, one
way or another, if you are going to deal with infantry.

Personally, I am very doubtful about cavalry attacks on infantry. I think
cav is going to take horrific losses against dug-in infantry.

Grav packs look to be viable for non-powered infantry. A problem is
signature - grav packs of whatever sort needs a power source, and that
means signature. Signature draws artillery ...

The tactics I am thinking of involve dug-in concealed infantry with
artillery support. I assume that smart munitions designed to look for
things in battledress would be available - possibly individual heat-seeker
submunitions.

Unless that infantry is dug in, which makes it pretty much shrapnel proof,
especially if you issue the dug-in infantry with slabs of, say, 2cm thick
armour plate for top cover for foxholes.

One advantage of having a small proportion of your troops equipped in a
particular way is that it makes it not cost effective to re-equip an entire
enemy force, and re-engineer their doctrine, to deal with it.

Given a 4 TL advantage, one would hope that they have an advantage of 10:1
.. imagine for a second a modern unit against a TL 5 formation. Elites vs
vets should be worth 3:2 by itself IMO.

Gauss rifles-12 in Striker werent that impressive. They had penetration of
7, which was one point better than a HMG-5, and range was similar.
Essentially, every man got a .50 cal, which is nice, but not as nice as the
increase from protection 5 for cloth-7 to protection-10 for combat armour-12.

The real advantages for hi-tech troops are in things like individual
communicators, map boxes and (especially) laser-guided cluster bomblet
artillery (including lurk-and-attack-when-asked missiles). Every Man A

A .50 cal isnt designed to be used on hard targets - it is designed for
multiple soft targets at range.

Try it again using, say, a 60mm recoiless bunker-buster.

I have often wondered how small you can get a MAD 
device (Magnetic Anomoly detector, used by recon 
aircraft to find submarines)

Think about all those gauss rifles going off - those have 
got to produce significant magnetic spikes - now think 
about guided munitions keying off a MAD; An artilery shell 
specially delivered to each individual infantry foxhole...

Pardon me, but I don\'t recall *any* city that was subjected to any

Also, they\'ll have *severe* problems with ground pressure. All that

I\'ll definitely check that one out, as FPC is also the leading

Be nice to use different versions of the same compiler on all my systems.

nuking a city or anything else from orbit is destorying the asset that you
want..
and then you have to rebuild the socity which is more expensive then the
mecha or BD or grav tank.

Ian, throw in modifiers to hit for size and dexterity/maneuverability and
the chances to hit are tremendously reduced.  The book doesn\'t allow for
this properly but I know from experience that aiming a shoulder fired or
even a wire guided rocket/missile is damned difficult.  A quick zig/zag by
something that is about 5% of the size that you are used to aiming at will
add tremendously to the difficulty factor.  Your weapons firer will NOT be
able to compensate that quickly.  I do believe damage is right IF they can
hit him, after all the round was designed to stop a tank.

\'Rasonably\' is a slippery word...compared to nuking it from orbit, yes any
city that was subjected to house to house is reasonably intact... after all
most of the buildings are still standing, the roads could actually be cleared
pretty quickly. Then, too we don\'t have any examples I can think of that
weren\'t either bombed or shelled pretty heavily first. The point remains that
if you simply want the place destroyed, it\'s insane to do it by going in and
doing it house by house. If you\'re doing that, you have an objective to
capture _something_.

	I believe there was a proposal to modify the Pen of man-portable
lasers--rather than declaring any laser with a calculated Pen of 1 or
greater to be Nil, use the calculated Pen.

The BD equipped troops are going to have to depend on Patton\'s three
favorite tools: Speed, Shock, and Maneuver.  An Imperial Marine platoon
will be all over the place, working like mad to shatter the enemy before
they can organize themselves.  As you say further on, having every BD
trooper capable of calling for fire support is in itself an incredible
advantage.

Battle Dress provides on huge advantage:  you can ignore shrapnel.  The
vast majority of infantry deaths come from artillery.  If you can ignore
those hot bits of wire flying around, you\'ve just limited the enemy\'s
ability to hurt you by about 75%.  They have to use support weapons on you.
 Morale drops quickly when faced with soldiers who just keep coming.

Digging in assumes you know where I\'m coming from.  Battle Dress is only
really practical in first wave assaults, where you need maximum striking
power.  If I know where you are dug in, my Marine Regiment is preceded by a
massive amount of deadfall ordinance.

Exactly.  Which is why the vast majority of Imperial troops are still
wearing CES and carrying gauss rifles.  It\'s much cheaper.  Dedicated
strike units wear BD.

It would be easier on us, in the US and Canada, if BITS could find a
distributor over here.  Seeing as these books are in something of a
niche, I can see were the big distrubutors (that are left) might not be
interested, but it doesn\'t *have* to be a major distributor, BITS might
be able to directly distribute to an on-line games vendor, even some
enterprising netizen could buy a few copies of each book and sell via
the net.

Has BITS checked with Crazy Egor\'s, Discount Games, Dragon\'s Trove, or
Titan Games to see if they would be interested in stocking a few copies?
 
Has BITS dropped a note to Hyperbooks?  Terry would handle the on-line
purchase and after BITS received a confirmation they would ship out the
product.  Because we\'re talking about shipping from England costs would
be higher, but probably not much more.

Has BITS approached, or been approached by, anybody in TML about this?
I bet there is someone here who would be willing to act as USA
distributor for BITS products.  

Heck, even if there\'s nobody here you\'d trust to be your distributor why
wouldn\'t you sell a few copies of each book at wholesale to someone over
here and let them sell them?  Paul Sanders was able to sell out his 120
copies of Letter of Marque (and could probably seel out another print
run if he wanted to) at ~$18 each. I rather suspect BITS products would
sell, at least, as well...don\'t you?

That was nice of you Suz.

Personally, I was hoping she\'d get interested in all these strange (to

I like the concept of a seperate pen rating, but I\'ve never been
particularly happy with how it was implemented in TNE.  Maybe it was
just me, but the explanations in the book always leave me scratching my
head.  It *looks* like there are two ways of handling pen, one for
personal weapons and one for vehicle/ship weapons, I don\'t think that\'s
true, but it sure looked that way to me.

	I have suggested on-line (downloadable PDF) copies, but they\'re a

to drop them a line about this.

	I\'m glad somebody was polite about it. I tend to have a short temper
with people who join lists and don\'t bother to read/save the welcome
message, with such useful things as the *purpose* of the list and
*how to leave* the list ... And the occasional spammer who does it

I thought I was.  Aren\'t there any BITS folks on the TML?  If there
aren\'t, why the heck not!  ;->

As a suggestion, I wonder what effect it would have if Crazy Egor\'s or
Discount Games got a few dozen order requests from people willing to put
their Credit Card number where their mouth is? 

Actually, that\'s not a bad idea.  If there is as much interest in here
as I think there is to get BITS books over here in North America, then
we should pick one good online vender and send email requests for a
specific book to that vendor.  It\'s probably not worth it to them to
place an order for one copy, but if there are a a few dozen it might get
their attention. It would certainly get mine! ;->

There are several vendors we could pick.  I haven\'t ordered from Crazy
Egor\'s or Titan Games, but have heard good things about them from
others.  I have ordered from both Discount Games and Dragon\'s Trove with
good results. Any of those four would work for me.

I can understand their reluctance to do PDF, although BTRC has gone that
route so there must be money in it.  I\'ve ordered several BTRC products
from Hyperbooks (both hardcopy shipping and online files) and have been
pleased.  If anybody here hasn\'t dropped by hyperbooks.com and taken a
look they should.

	Ditto. I think it\'s a great idea, although I also understand their
reluctance. OTOH, Greg doesn\'t even protect his documents from

Here I go again, although it didn\'t seem my recent posting regarding the subject of canonical world names was of interest to anyone else...

While thumbing through my issues of Challenge, I noticed a Contact article in JTAS 26 about a minor race called the Prt\'.

The Prt\' are said to origin from the world Prt\'aow, which in the article is referenced "Spica/Prt\' (C9667C9)". This made me wonder if one could maybe backtrack the location of that world by finding a world with a matching UWP in the DGP-updated or HIWG sector files.

Alas, there was no world matching the UWP C9667C9, but there is one (and one only) world with matching physical characteristics (size 9, atmosphere 6 and hydrosphere 6) - it\'s the world 2340 C966302-A. The starport is also the same, but the social characteristics differ (the tech level was never given).

One could think of two reasons for this:

1. The Contact article refers to the CT era stats, and they somehow changed to the new 1120 stats in the intervening years.

2. Noone ever considered the Contact article when generating the UWPs for Spica :-)

Anyway, I suggest one of two things:

1. The world Spica 2340 C966302-A is called Prt\'aow, and the UWP is left as is. The referee then need to think up an explanation for why the social stats changed.

2. The world Spica 2340 has it\'s UWP changed to C9667C9-A, and is still called
Prt\'aow.

In any case, subsector O of Spica should be called Prt\'.

I still think updating the HIWG sector files to reflect this would be a good
idea (again, I would be happy to do so myself), but maybe I\'m the only one who
think this?

Actions? Comments?

Exactly my experience - if you want to change the credit card used, you

Ian, you missed the entire point of the last four words of the paragraph
you quoth... AGAINST NON-HEAVY TARGETS. Dug in infantry are just as heavy a
target as an armor collumn; less damage potential, but also much harder to
target individually. Light Cav, BTW, is NOT ARMORED VEHICLES as much as
infantry with transport.

Even so, any heavy infantry unit is going to make life hell on anything
they can prepare for.

and as for TL differences, the 10:1 was with nearly identical commo, and
identical spotting useing the mk 1 eyeball, in a city\'s rubble.

Battledress is not a panacea for combat; I\'ve NEVER claimed so. It is,
however, a multiplier of infantry effectiveness in the low threat
environments, and even in medium threat environments (ie: actual trained
troops with decent weapons). And, since inidvidual weapons for the average
trooper (by canonical sources) show Gauss rifles or ACR\'s for all infantry
of TL\'s 10-15, the TL of the gauss wepaon is immaterial under MT... Under
FF&S, if you take the time, yes it does improve.

A HIgh threat environment is going to eat infantry, armored infantry, light
and medium cav, and some heavy cav. And, IMTU, is simply going to be
softened up with Meson Ortillery... THEN send in marine Cav and Infantry
units under Close Air Support from Marine Armor (The trepida is an
incredible attack aircraft, especially with a co-axial VRF Gauss Gun
added). The Astrin, partner to the trepida is likewise wonderful- fast, and
survivable from direct hits from almost any man-pack weapon. Trepidas,
however, can drop them quick.

As for signatures: Current technology allows for IR suppression via
chemical "Chill Cylinders". Use a chemical reaction that results in
cooling. Currently frightfully expensive. Neutrino: no chance. EMR- can br
reduced if using passive systems and built-in faraday caging, grouned
through the boots. MAD- perenial problem with Traveller is the tech
system\'s reliance upon ferro-magnetic armors. So, rahter than steel, base
your composites on non-ferro-magnetic materials.

One other thing about sensing: usisng sensing equipment requires training,
computer assistance/automation, or both. Much easier to have semi-automated
sensors putting upa display in the hud of BD than a non-framed kit.

BD, which STARTS at around KCr50, is expensive, and more than likely will
INCREASE training costs (Which, I\'ll agree with KCr 50 as the base training
costs of an infantry soldier in traveller, as that\'s about what it worked
out to when using MT and CT Bk4, including housing, ammo, instructor
salaries, amortized cost of training center). And don\'t forget that the
cost of a soldier also includes his pay over time... BD , which I figure
adds 50% to training cossts, plus the cost of a suit every 10 years per
trooper minimum, makes the cost per trooper in very BASIC BD (no high TL
goodies, just basic commo gear, and a standard issue arm and kit,adds
around KCr25) on the order of KCr150 - to get him combat ready. Around 3
times that of the "sfot" gropo. So it is worth bumping up the costs with
chill canisters, cammo, etc. Standard imperial BD runs on the order of MCr
1.25 per suit, no training or weapon included! With the squad heavy weapons
being in the KCr50-400 range... well, that TL14 Imperial BD with all the
goodies costs as much as a light cav vehicle. And will be protected as
such. The only way I can see Imperial BD in use is for the PSYCHOLOGICAL
effect against civilians. The expense is so great in comparison to soft
infantry, and by comparative firepower (Canon sources show BD troops having
only marginal firepower improvements over soft infantry) that the troops
will not exceed the 20:1 cost differential in performance...

As for "Dug In" soft infantry, such infantry is a static target, much more
suited to artillery fire. And anti-BD arty will be taken out with
counter-battery fire, wither from ortillery, armor, or plandef... unless
the target is a strategic necessity intact (like the power plant for a base
which has otherwise been secured, or power plant and/or life support center
for a domed colony) AND cannot be easily replaced/supplanted. Situation
which, in my view, are a lot less common than some persons on this list
seem to feel (no finger pointing here, just noting it). Why do the hard
thing, when the easy approach will do?

One other note: MT Battledress is more effective than TNE/FF&S1 BD. This is
due to the differences in the armor penetration rules; MT is  a multiplier
to damage, while FF&S is a linear damage reduction system. That 1/10th
damage in MT akes even high damage, low pen weapons fairly useless against
BD and Armor... which is why I apply the success level LAST, (Also a
multiplier, but has a minimum damage function). It reduces BD to the 5:1
effectiveness I feel is right. Otherwise, since thedamage rounds down or
normally) Damage 4 becomes damage 0.4 x success modifier (0.5 to 8, for a
final range of 0.2-3.2 vs BD of AV 14 or more, and the minimum success
needing to be by 4 points (to break the 1 point mark) in oder to do damage
when rounding down). Striker was even more effect from armor, as it was
2d+Pen-AV, with that 7 point difference meaning the worst result from a
Gauss rifle was a heavy wound. Under TNE, the low damage gauss rifles
generally had their eintire damage converted to 1 pip per die. Adds up MUCH
faster.

The above is the response I got when I asked our misguided new member

Well, since this is far from the first time this has happened, I
explained what the list was about and asked where she\'d heard about it.
Her response is in another message.

But basicly, it\'s as I suspect. There\'s a site with a list of mailing
lists that has *this* list filed under "Travel". I\'ll be trying to
contact them later on, but I can\'t do it until late tonight. 

So we *need* to be nice to people, as they are making an innocent
mistake.

The Boys ATR was a kinetic-kill weapon, not a rocket. Basically, it was a
dirty great big heavy rifle, designed to deal with early-WW2 tanks.

As tanks got thicker armour, the ATR rifle concept was basically discarded
in favour of shaped-charge rockets.

Now, shaped charge rockets are slooooow, which allows troops to doge them,
if you are using them in an anti-personell role.

The TL9+ equivalent of the Boys ATR looks to be the baby particle
accelerator - about 250 kJ, range about 5km, with an integral grav sled for
mobility.

Of course, once you fire it, everybody within 20km or so will know your
*precise* position.

I actually argued that every trooper would be capable of calling in
artillery fire. This should be an advantage to the defenders - the
shrapnel-proof dugouts should equal to the shrapnel-proof battledress. 

The tactical defense also have an electronic advantage - they can pre-place
sensor decoys. I suspect warfare would become a lot more about concealment
and electronics once it becomes one-shot one-kill.

Modern artillery (since the Boer War or so) has been designed to shoot
shrapnel-making shells . Once troops start becoming shrapnel proof (when CE
suits and combat armour becomes standard issue), artillery will move to
cluster bomblets and their cousins, small heat (or whatever-) seeking
missiles.

If these bomblets will penetrate Battle Dress (and under Striker they
will), then infantry is back where it was, battledress or no battledress.

The alternative is to build point defense systems for individual suits of
battledress, which looks possible, but difficult.

Platoon-level dedicated point defense systems look more doable - the
equivalent of a ZSU-23 rigged up for anti-artillery work.

Given a choice between digging in and not digging in, infantry should
*always* dig in.

I wont deny that they would, I just suspect that they arent cost effective.

But the biggest issue is the probable lack of \'fronts\' in hi-tech
grav-mobile warfare. That is going to change ground combat to almost beyond
recognition ...

This remember me of my favorite Mech-Configuration in
Mercenaries/MechwarriorPC-Games. I loaded my Mech with as many MG\'s as I
could (as much as 10), tried to stay short range and fired all of the at
once, one, two times. Killed most of the light and medium oponents a lot
faster than they tried to kill me, and even worked with the
heavier one\'s !!! :-)
MG\'s were more waste heat-efficient than Lasers and PPC\'s, running cool
and , you are more often on target with the high volumes of fire!

Not necessarily. In many cases (Stalingrad?), the objective was to wipe
out the defenders because the attackers didn\'t dare advance *past* the
town until it was "neutralized". And since the attackers didn\'t have
the air superiority required to bomb it to death, the poor bloody
infantry got the job.

I went to   www.listz.com    and gave them the searchstring traveller
but there
wasn\'t anythink to be mistaken. Except from a brief description of the

Perhaps someone has already - I took a look at the site and the traveller 
mailing list is not in the Travel category, and when I found it with a general 
search it is fairly clear what it is (the info file for the list is 
included with the listing).

   Knocking down a city does not kill as many well-prepared defenders as the 
attacker hopes, and gives the surviving defenders plenty of places and material 
to create defenses.  Plus it\'s even harder to move in heavy weapons through the 
rubble.

My favorite trick was configuring my joystick buttons to control the jump
jets.  Great way to side step incoming missiles.  I used that and completely
loaded out with medium lasers, then you rush up and POW!  one shot and the
whole screen lights up.  Of course, I turned off heat when I did that :-)
But there was this one time that I got lucky with a light mech.  Jumped high
and got a lucky MG shot through the cockpit of a Dire Wolf.  Never could
duplicate the shot though.

Nope. Because it *still* has to radiate that 100-200W or else the

The "Chill Can" idea is nice - a refrigeration unit designed to let you
"turn off" (or at least dampen) your heat signature for short periods of
time, such as the time between your unit breaking cover and your unit
storming the enemy HQ complex. You glow like a toaster after you
overload the heat storage, or dump the can and lose the heat masking
capabilities.

This assumes, of course, that by TL12 or so we haven\'t come up
with some impossible bit of technology that lets us jam an IR
sensor. 

I\'ve liked the idea of ultra-short sensor ranges in a sci-fi RPG - they
make so many cinematic things possible. Starfighters flying at
speeds and ranges akin to those of a WW2 dogfight, because
sensor jamming makes their eyeballs the only useful collision
avoidance and targeting tool (a la Star Wars), for example. I think
a high-tech battelfield will be much more interesting if jamming tech
is so well developed that you can\'t trust a targeting solution (or even
target detection) not provided by the naked eye.

The Boys ATR was a kinetic-kill weapon, not a rocket. Basically, it was a

As tanks got thicker armour, the ATR rifle concept was basically discarded

Now, shaped charge rockets are slooooow, which allows troops to doge them,

The TL9+ equivalent of the Boys ATR looks to be the baby particle

You\'ve just replaced a Section-level (or Squad-level), man-portable support

analog - but remember that the weapon you\'re seeking an analog for

over a Panzer II it would be lucky to break a tread.

The Boys ATR might have been a nice weapon to drop to the resistance
units, though - it could easily disable a steam locomotive, for example,
or knock out any cargo vehicle. And it\'s effects on things like avgas
storage tanks would be beautiful to behold. Put those in something you
can carry on the back of a bicycle and use at 100+ meters and you
have a very nice toy indeed, provided the guerillas don\'t get cocky.

I believe that when sector data was done up in general, unless it was
established sectors, such as the Virushi in Reavers\' Deep, absolutely no
attention was paid to the contact articles.  One of the best minor human
races described was the Dynchia existing in the Leonidaes (AFAIR) sector (1
sector trailing the Old Expanses), became the Hinterworlds sector when MT
was published (a name change... no big deal right?)

Then Challenge published the Hinterworlds sector data and lo and behold,
the Dynchia were no more.

OK, we have terminology differences. Heavy, for me, means armour. Cavalry,
for me, means either horses or lightly armoured armour. Infantry with
integral transport I either call mech infantry, motor infantry or infantry.
Infantry without integral transport I call infantry or leg infantry (before
motorised infantry is standard, motor inf gets called motor inf, and normal
is just inf. Afterwards, motor inf is inf, and non-motor inf gets called
leg inf).

I always built Striker units with lots of rifle grenades ... the other
thing to remember is the Imperium fights a real war, what, every 80 years
or so tops ... lots of time to forget.

The other issue is even \'soft\' infantry is in combat armour, and thus
reasonably crunchy itself.

Hmmm, if you intend to spend KCr 50 shipping your trooper 10 parsecs, and
then contract them for a year for KCr 50, then putting the MCr 1.5
investment into a BD-equipped trooper is a better deal, as the increased
training and equipment costs are not reflected in the increased shipping
costs.

Thinking of BD+grav belts as equivalents of Scout Cars, it might be cheaper
to spend the MCr 1.5 than build and then ship the scout car 10 parsecs.

Battledress may then be a \'mercenary\'s weapon\' ... not considered cost
effective by the real military, but used by mercenary striker units when
they have a 2-3 TL advantage over the locals, and are trying to avoid
direct combat in any case.

My idea of hi-tech artillery involves pre-dropped MRL packs - basically, a
6-pack of rockets with individually homing submunitions. Counterbattery
fire, whilst not impossible, is more difficult (hmmm. I hafta build some
grav rockets, and see just how well they work).

Striker still had BD troops as dead meat to cluster bomblets and 20mm cannon.

200 kJ particle weapons are pretty small. The weapon needs a length of less
than a meter, about a tenth of a cubic meter of accumulators, about a fifth
of a cubic meter for the beam pointer and a power source of about 50
kilowatts for a RoF of a shot per 20 seconds (me, I\'d use a very fast
discharge battery for one shot, then a slower release battery for
recharging the first battery).

All up I think the weapon should end up at about a cubic meter, including
grav sled.

I thought that Battledress was found primarily in the Imperial Marines 
rather than the Army.  Maybe I\'m wrong on that, but my take was that BD 
allowed fighting on shipboard, vacc, no grav, small arms type stuff, and 
shock value to initial landings, not running around a battlefield as 
part of the regular infantry...

I\'m not in HIWG, but I think it is important for the articles and other
published (By "Canon" sources) material to have a correspondence with some
copy of the sector files floating around.  I support changing the HIWG maps
to reflect this anomoly.

Stalingrad is a special case...if you can afford mecha, you can afford air
superiority. If you don\'t have air superiority, your mecha are crispy critters.

Stalingrad is also why Hitler lost the war. That tied down one of Guderian\'s
pincers of armor and infantry long enough to keep him from taking Moscow,
which kept him from controlling Eastern Russia, which kept him there \'till
winter started, and the only rational response to invading during a Russian
winter is to not do it.

Removing the _ability_ to do effective suppression fire is a serious
disadvantage for any force, it means that it will be essentially impossible to
take defended positions.

Nah, infantry vs infantry fights usually occur in close terrain (cities, etc). 
200 meters will probably do fine.  Unfortunately, it won\'t fire very many
times, so it has about the same problem as the anti-armor missiles.

Yes, you need more weight to mask human+power source than to mask human, but
this gets back to powered armor _carrying_ more weight.  Also, the human body
really isn\'t all that efficient at turning power into work and doesn\'t idle all
that well, a 400 kilo suit of powered armor which isn\'t moving much might well
use under 50w of power, and even running flat-out maybe a kilowatt, of which as
little as 25% might be waste heat (depending somewhat on your tech assumptions
about how suits are constructed).

Well, if you can pin down an infantry unit with your light battledress unit you
can either (depending on your goals) head off and cause trouble elsewhere, or
just pin them long enough for your fire support to turn their reinforced
position into slag.

You\'re not the only one to express an interest in a new release of a

Hinterworlds Sector was not renamed - Leonidae Sector is the sector immediately 
to trailing of Hinterwords.

It looks like the author of the article was going by the known space maps 
included in the Library Data books (supplements 8 and 11), where most of the 
sectors are not named.  Old Expanses is named, but not Hinterworlds nor 
Leonidae - the author named these sectors Margin and Melande.  The Editor notes 
that the article was written without reference to the Atlas of the Imperium, 
and conflicts with it.

However, the Council of Leh Perash in subsector-P of the HinterWorlds is 
exactly where the article placed the Comitia of Dynchia (plus I,J,M,N of 
Leonidae); I\'d suggest replacing the Council with the Comitia in your universe.

Well, that\'s another way of naming them, but you\'re not going to start any good 
bar-fights with names like that. :)

You\'re suffering from a common misconception. Namely the idea that the
energy used for "work" *doesn\'t* wind up as heat.

Admittedly, a powered suit will do better than most, because a lot of
energy goes into gross physical movement. Still, a lot of the energy
used will wind up as heat or other EM radiation.

While starting I have found a few ambiguities I need help with.

My first query is related to the social standing of the ruling family.  How
is this determined to start with?

As each persons social standing is related to the Archon (or head of the
family) minus the number of steps from the Archon, is the brother of the
Archon of the same Social standing as the Archons Children?

If my Archon has a SOC of B, his siblings should all be A.
The Archons children will be A and the children of the Archons Siblings
will all be 9.  Is this correct?

Later, when the Archon resigns and his heir (assumed to be the eldest
child) steps up the ex-Archon has now got a SOC of A, the ex-Archons
siblings go to a SOC of 9 and their children go to 8.  The new Archons
siblings stay the same and all descendents of the new Archon increase by
one.  Is this example correct?

Putting it all down like this has made it easier to see.

Any comment would be appreciated.

Thanks

  Stalingrad started in fall `42; I suspect that this really refers to

Actually, that is true.  It\'s been a while since I looked at TNE but I
remember that Dave Nilsen explained it too me.  IIRC, the personnel
combat uses PEN as a multiplier of the armor and subtracts that from 
the damage; while the vehicle combat PEN is compared against the 
vehicle\'s armor to see if the shot got through.  I wasn\'t too happy with
the way it was handled; but, I didn\'t have much vehicle combat in my
campaign so I didn\'t worry about it too much.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Just read a book by David Weber, _Path of the Fury_. Main character
was a member of the Imperial Cadre - best of the best of the best
drop commandoes. In his book, each drop commando (when you
factor in recruitment, training, cyber implants that would make a
Cyberpunk Solo envious, and a nice suit of battle dress) ends up
costing the Empire about as much as a Frigate.

What do you use such an expensive asset for? Very, very surgical
missions. High-profile hostage rescue. Capturing the bridge crew of
an enemy dreadnaught. A rebellion can be stopped without nuking
the planet from orbit - if a squad of these walking nightmares can get
into the rebel headquarters.

They\'re described as supermen, as the scariest troops the resources
and technology of a thousand worlds can produce. The Emperor has
budgeted for 10,000 of these elite troops, but tough recruiting standards
keep the drop commandoes from ever being at this strength level.
They aren\'t immortal, though: a traitor in the book gives them bad 
intelligence on a hostage rescue, they go in with a company and come
out with barely a squad. In the right situation, they\'re the best possible
asset to have. In the wrong situation, they\'re casualties.

(btw, for those of you looking for reasons to have pirates show up
in a campaign, Weber\'s _Path of the Fury_ puts together a good
one - I\'d tell, but it would be a bit of a spoiler for the book.)

One of the LBB\'s , _Broadsword_, describes Zhodani Commandoes.
Find the <1% or so of your troops who can master the psionic discipline
of teleportation. Now you can put them almost anywhere, an amazing
advantage. You want to capitalize on this, so give them battledress,
MP energy weapons, the best training and support you can afford.
You don\'t want to blow this advantage, so what do you use these troops
on? Do you teleport them into the path of a grav tank assault? Or do you
drop them into the middle of his headquarters bunker where his CO is
sitting in shirtsleeves? In _Broadsword_, they don\'t send these
Commandoes after the combat-armored, well-armed Mercenary
contingent - they send them after the crew of the Broadsword while the
mercs are away... 

You generally can\'t bring as many troops with you interstellar as the
defender can raise, when doing interstellar warfare. The ones you bring
have to be the best, with the best equipment and training, because
they are going to be outnumbered. Battledress won\'t make them
invulnerable, but it couldn\'t hurt.

Yes, there\'s lots (at least a few occasionally post something) of BITS folk
on TML but we\'re just members of BITS.  It would be up to Andy Lilly to
arrange something like this....


...and to the best of my knowledge he has been endeavouring to do something
along these lines for some time now.  (I don\'t know exactly what as I\'m not
privvy to such details, but I\'d guess he\'s thought of all the obvious
routes.)  I understand there may have been problems or a hold up with
whatever was in the works.

I have a suspicion he is away on holiday at present, but no doubt he will
respond (en masse if the past is anything to go by) to these suggestions
when he can.



>Actually, that\'s not a bad idea.  If there is as much interest in here
>as I think there is to get BITS books over here in North America, then



Believe me, I\'m certain that Andy has a good idea that there is \'much
interest\' in the US over buying the BITS products.  I\'m sure he\'s as keen
as anyone to get you guys to buy these books.  If he does forget, I\'ll keep
reminding him!  I\'d have loved for you all to have a chance to buy my
bibliography!  (And not for the money - what money? - but because I think
it\'s genuinely useful.)


While I\'m here, I ought to say that I\'ve nothing but praise for Leisure
Games\' service too.  (via the post and in person).

   I agree with this.  Imperial Fleet Marines get BattleDress to maximize
their effectiveness.  There is a limit to how many you can carry onboard,
so you make each one as nasty as possible.

    Good idea.  Even 2 missle racks that each BD Trooper carries and leaves
someplace .  You paint the target (or send the location back to the
missle), have it launch, and let the counter battery response pound
someplace you\'re not.

    'body' => 'OK, GURPS Traveller made it to the printer 1 day late with (literally)
second to spare (we got the manuscript to the Fed Ex office just as they
were closing the doors). Tentatively, we hope to get it back in time to
have it on the shelves by early September, but see below.

Does this mean it\'ll only be one day late getting back to us? Maybe -- let
me explain how printers work: Because presses cost in megadollars (at least
the ones you use to get quality products) they cannot afford to let them
sit idle, so printers try to schedule every minute as far in advance as
possible. If you miss your place in the queue, sometimes you have to get in
the back of the line, sometimes they can fit you in (depends on a lot of
things, like how big a job it is, and how much your business means to the
printer, and how nicely you ask the person who does the scheduling). What
this means for GURPS Traveller is that the printer cannot promise us that
our one day delay will translate into one day delay at the other end. It
might be one day, it might be a few days, it might be a week. Gahd forbid,
it could be two or more weeks. We won\'t know until the printer tells us,
and that might not be until mid-August.

The Hardback is another story: it is going to take a few weeks longer than
the paperback edition, because it takes longer to do a HB than a regular
paperback. Since we can\'t afford to delay the release of the paperback
until the HB is done, we\'re going to release the HB version later,
hopefully towards the end of September. You\'ll need the GURPS basic rules
book in order to play, but you could squeak by with GURPS Lite, a 32-page
pdf booklet of the condensed GURPS rules which is available free off the SJ
Games website (www.sjgames.com/).

In any case, now is the time to start pestering your FLGS (in a nice way,
of course). Distributors order based on retailer requests, and retailers
request on the basis of consumer queries, so if you want to see GURPS
Traveller products on the shelves, now is the time to start asking. Make
sure the FLGS owner knows that this is GURPS Traveller you are asking
about, or there may be confusion. So far, the buzz among retailers and
distributors has been good, and we\'ve been sending out a promotional poster
(maybe some of you have seen it). We\'ll also be doing a T-shirt (more on
this later).

Upcoming releases include Behind the Claw, a sourcebook for the Spinward
Marches, and a Mercenary sourcebook. I want to have a merchant/trade &
commerce book follow closely after that, but that brings me to my next
point:

I need someone to write a 128 page book dealing with trade and commerce in
GURPS Traveller. Hopefully, this should be pretty detailed, using the world
characteristics to determine what kinds of cargos will be available,  and
using the GURPS game mechanics. Fortunately for the author, there aren\'t
that many GURPS mechanics dealing with interstellar trade (I haven\'t been
able to find more than a few sentences), and will need to mesh in with the
bare-bones rules I included in the GT basic rules.

Any Takers? Contact me outside the list, and we can discuss details.

***************************

Our over-worked web wrangler will be posting samples of text and illos from
GURPS Traveller on the GT web page as soon as possible, but I can\'t
guarantee that will happen this week. We got some art from Rob Caswell
(some re-cycled, some previously unpublished) and quite a biut of new stuff
from Tom Peters. I daresay some of you will remember these two illustrators?

Someone asked if Behind the Claw will include Traveller-style UPPS: the
answer is no, UPPS are not part of the way GURPS does things. It is
possible for us to translate the stats into UPP form and put that on the
web, and I\'ll see if this can\'t be done by the time the book comes out (I
don\'t think much has changed between 1110 and 1120).

gave lots of adventure hooks.  

I\'ve only played CT, and have not even seen the other versions (other 
than sitting on the shelf).  That said, I have no idea, apart from what 
people have said on the TML, of what the T4 system background was.  I\'d 
hope that the type of things that Eris wrote were in there.  Thanks Eris 
for putting it down here...

Comments on Politics:  Politics is fun.  There needs to be more than 
just politics, though, I agree.  IMCTU, I\'m putting together the upper 
levels of sector government and I anticipate having some high-level 
intrigue.  Eris\' ideas will help me...even if it is only on a "local 
power base" level.

How long is the Milieu 0 time period and how big is the "empire"?

I like these ideas.  It allows for the full range of the Traveller 
system to be used.  Power, Diplomacy, Bribery, danger, victory, windfall 
profit, massive losses, tradewar, *Piracy*... and many of them together.  
And thanks for the player ideas, too.

I particularly like your ideas for book three.  I\'d include a bit more 
on establishing companies and the expansion of market share with the 
attendent tradewars, etc.  Merchants need to catch hot plasma 
sometimes...  ;->  

So have we been told what setting T5 is going to be?

Lunion (2124 Spinward Marches A995984-D) Date: 001-1119

Unrest has erupted on Lunion after a second, successful assassination attempt
yesterday killed the Count of Binled, Draco Sylas.

A few days before, terrorists killed what turned out to be a clone of Sylas, in
a hangar in Binled castle using TDX explosives. The criminals are still not
apprehended.

On 365-1118, during the traditional inspection of the Count\'s guard, criminals
struck again, once more using TDX. The Count was instantly killed together with
several members of the guard. Spectators were relatively unharmed due to the
special nature of TDX, but panick ensued with considerable damage to people
and property.

Elements of the Count\'s guard opened fire against civilians as looting and rioting spread through Binled City.

Later during the night to Holiday, Lamarr Nilpoat, seneschal to Duke Giblinick of Lunion, declared the City of Binled in a state of Martial Law.

Colonial fleet elements apparently loyal to the deceased Count Sylas then moved to bombard the arcology with meson fire. With the Imperial fleet stationed at Lunion\'s naval base away battling the Aslan to rimward, the colonial fleet looked like it would make short process of the city.

In a surprise turn of events, elements of the 43rd fleet, stationed at Capon (2324 Spinward Marches) jumped insystem, ordering all forces loyal to Count Sylas to surrender immediately under orders from Archduke Norris himself.

"To the inhabitants of Lunion and all Imperial citizens: This is vice admiral Arthur Khi Salinlikhigu from the 43rd fleet on a mission from Archduke Norris. Subversive elements in Lunion\'s nobility has attempted high treason against Norris, Domain of Deneb and the Imperium. The leader of this group is Count Draco Sylas, and we demand that he and his forces immediately surrender."

The situation is still unresolved at this time.

World governments are sovereign, they rule themselves. Although they can

What is the Imperium, what is the value of Imperial Citizenry, what does
the Imperium consider itself sovereign over?

You might want to try and have more background books instead. Those will
probably find a larger audience, and will be more fun to read (Me, for
example, i haven앖 played traveller in years, but bought loads of
sourcebooks and adventures, old and new, just to read them...)

my feelings exactly: if you don앖 have great surprises planned for the

A reasonable analogy, so long as it isn\'t pushed far at all, is that the
Imperium is to it\'s member worlds what the US Federal government is to
the states (please...no long rants about the evil federal gummint from
anyone, ok!); the states conduct their own affairs according to their
own laws and whims, the fed regulates trade between the states, provides
for the general defense, and settles disputes between the states.

The actual sticking points of the matter is a bit murkier than that.
Acceptance into the Imperium as a member means that the world\'s
government(s) acknowledges that their sovergnity ends at the edge of
their atmosphere (or their 100 dia limit depending on how you play it).
Imperial starports are extraterritorial, much like embassies or trade
compounds in asia during the first years of contact with European
traders.

In return for this reduction of their power and submission to a larger
state, they\'re protected by the Imperial Navy.

Imperial Citizens is actually another poorly defined term, variously it
has meant a sapient being born or naturalized in Imperial space
signifying nothing much, other than \'I\'m not Zhodani\', to a specific
class of citizen, with differing rights, mostly rights of appeal to
Imperial jurisdiction.

Canon is rife with contradictions over exactly what and how minutely the
Imperium rules..but effectively, they are the big guns and can cut a
planet off from outside commerce if they want to, but generally the
Imperium doesn\'t try to micromanage world governments.

One thing Dulinor was fighting for was having the Imperium take a
greater role in running the worlds within the Imperium, making it a much
more comprehensive \'1-Imperium\' government; that\'s what he was talking
about when he was going on over "The Imperiums responsibility to it\'s
citizens".

Again, the actualities are muddier. Typically, as the Imperium grew
during the years of expansion, the rulers of the various worlds joining
the new Imperium were co-opted into it by making them Nobles, with
representation in the Moot, so the various woirlds were not without
representaion at the highest levels, and nobles running a world would
tend to run it in conformance with what benefitted the Imperium as a
whole.

Dulinor wanted to go farther than that; he wanted to extend the Imperal
rule to ground on all the planets of the Imperium, reducing the member
states nominal independence in favor of a single huge state.

Interstellar trade is considered a Good Thing in the Imperium, as it kept 
fresh ideas brewing up all the time.

Correct.  Planetary matters were the responsibility of the planetary 
government.  This responsibility ends at the edge of the planetary atmosphere 
or the 100 diameter limit in the case of airless planets, IIRC.

The planetary government\'s right to go to hell in its own way without outside

I\'ve never claimed that the (long, but not as long as passive) sensor ranges
in FFS2/DSR were terribly definitive, but here\'s an interesting data point 
for those of us who believe in long ranges:
- ----
(from a JPL press releast)
     Ground-based radio telescopes have been able to detect the 
Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft and have 
found it rotating slowly near its original position in space, a 
potentially important step toward possible recovery of direct 
communications with the spacecraft. 
 
     Radio contact with SOHO, a joint mission of the European 
Space Agency (ESA) and NASA, was interrupted on June 24, an event 
under review by a joint ESA/NASA investigation board. 
 
     With the encouragement of Dr. Alan Kiplinger of the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\'s Space Environment Center 
in Boulder, CO, researchers at the U.S. National Astronomy and 
Ionosphere Center (NAIC) in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, used the 
facility\'s 305-meter (990-foot) diameter radio telescope to 
transmit a signal toward SOHO on July 23. The 70-meter dish of 
NASA\'s Deep Space Network in Goldstone, CA, acted as a receiver, 
locating the spacecraft\'s echo and tracking it using radar 
techniques for more than an hour. 
 
     Preliminary analysis of the radar data, which is ongoing, 
indicates that SOHO is still in its nominal halo orbit near the 
so-called "L-1" Lagrangian point in space, (a gravitationally 
stable vantage point 1.5 million kilometers ahead of the Earth) 
and is turning slowly at a rate of roughly one revolution per 
minute.  
- ----
For comparison to Traveller: Arecibo is somewhat bigger than most spacecraft
active arrays :-) but it\'s also less powerful; since Traveller ships have
hundreds of megawatts of power to spare, the FFS2 sensor arrays trade
area for power. SOHO is small - smaller than a Trav space combat missile. 
It\'s not very stealthy, though. The operators knew roughly where to look - 
a "single-hex scan" in DSR terms . It\'s probably not a fire-control
quality detection, but it does indicate that low-TL radars can detect 
small targets at million-km ranges.

Hmm.  There should be more than politics.  One of the things I\'ve 
toyed with in the various adventures I wrote for M0 was the 
characters having to deal with misconceptions in their "First 
Recontacts" with worlds.  After 18 centuries of isolation, much of 
what limited knowledge about the worlds they are travelling too 
may not only be sketchy, it may be totally inaccurate. Patient Zero 
(in Milieu 0 Campaign) was a good example of this.  A disease 
crops up that is old hat for Imperial citizens, but when \'carried\' to a 
new world it becomes quite deadly, because the new world isn\'t 
equipped to deal with it.

Other examples can be had, but just about anything that can work 
in a first contact scenario with a world (i.e. just about anything), 
can be made to work in M0.  It is one of the better things about it 
as opposed to CT or even MT.  There\'s a lot of there out there, and 
not only do the PC\'s not know much about it, but what they know 
is quite possibly dead wrong.

> How long is the Milieu 0 time period and how big is the "empire"?

As originally conceived, Milieu 0 was written from the perspective of 
somebody who might have been alive in year 20, looking back at 
the first 20 years of the Imperium.  When Joe Walsh and I wrote 
the additional material for the hardcover, we felt this was too 
restrictive.  We felt it should cover the first 200 years of the 
Imperium (or thereabouts), giving the GM the opportunity to set up 
scenarios during any point of that time period.  The additional 
material was geared towards that possibility.

Of course, your mileage may vary.  :-)

	This is also a bistatic array, something not currently modeled in
Traveller. Note that the signal was sent from one antenna, a *305*
meter one, and received by another, Arecibo\'s 70m dish. You can get
more gain out of 305 meters. They also don\'t say how much power they
used. Any ideas?

"It ain\'t what you don\'t know that kills you. It\'s what you know that
 ain\'t so..."

One nasty that occurs to me is a planet that was a religious
dictatorship (or oligarchy, either will work). And it still is. It\'s
even the same religion. Only thing is, there\'s been a "reformation" or
a "revelation". So the actual *practices* are almost 180 degrees from
what they used to be. This could be a *fatal* mistake...

Having just joined the list I have the obvious questions that you\'ll probably
want to email me directly with answers to instead of wasting bandwith.  

1.  What is the status of Traveller (not counting GURPS) or more specifically,
T4 and Imperium Games.  Products seem rare and the web page is not as active
as others I have seen.

2.  What plans exist for the non-GURPS Traveller future?


And a more relevant question:

What exact year does the T4 campaign start or if there wasn\'t a set date what
have most people started it at?  

Thanks,

Don\'t get me wrong, Stu. I\'m not knocking what you all did with _Milieu
0_.  I just don\'t think you could get it all into one book.

Go back and look at Chp. 5, Refferring Milieu 0, the first 6 pages were
*all* politics.  I know non-political things eventually are included,
but can you blame me for seeing a focus on the political?

Of course.  ;-> BTW, you know we all don\'t have the hardcover, and hence
this additonal material.

They were, and they weren\'t.  I don\'t think the exploration angle was
addressed very well.  We oldtimers all knew it was there, but it really
wasn\'t laid out in the published material as strongly as it should have
been, IMO.  The opponents of the late Federation and early Imperium were
mentioned, but there weren\'t many details.  

Heck, there is only so much that can go into 88 pages and that\'s what
_Milieu 0_ was after you take out the Core data.  As I mentioned in my
post I think the Milieu, any milieu, needs more than one book to cover
all its angles.

>How long is the Milieu 0 time period and how big is the "empire"?

Good question.  I think the original _Milieu 0_ book was looking back
from 20 and either Joe Walsh or Stu Dollar (or both) have said they
considered M0 to go out around 200.  

As for how big...well, I don\'t think a number of systems is mentioned,
but by 0 almost all of Core Sector is under control and there aren\'t
really any enemies around that *really* threaten the existence of either
the Federation or the new Imperium...the lack of a viable external
threat is a problem, but maybe I\'m just misreading the material.  "By 20
the Imperium seems destined to encompass about half of Dagudahaag,
Ilelish, Massalia, Fornast and Antares as well as a wide corridor to
Vland through Lishun.", seems to indicate a pretty big area around Core
had been incorporated.  Resistance from individual systems is mentioned,
but the feel is of an almost uncontested expansion through a vacuum..pun
intended.  ;->

I\'m not the fan of the UWP\'s that some old timers are (I always have to
look up the order ;-), but they are a very compact way of expressing
some of the important details about a world.  The only GURPS way I\'m
familiar with is the Planetary Record, _GURPS Space_, p 116, but I doubt
that\'s what you have in mind. ;->

I hope you do.  Sure, we Traveller geezers can use our old material, but
newcomers won\'t have that.  We do we want newcomers coming to Traveller
through GT to be able to carry on conversations with the already
initiated and to be able to share user written stuff between us, don\'t
we?  I\'m afraid, for better or worse, UWP\'s are part of the Traveller
language.

Well, trade was a motivation, accoring the Melieu 0, for its
formation, but it is definately more than a trade organition.

>According to Dulinor "The Imperium only rules the space between the worlds"

Not just Dulinor.  But that is more of a slogan.  It refers to the
fact that the Imperium allows most worlds to have autonomy over
local affairs.

Subject to Imperial rules

They defend the Imperium against outside forces, suppress rebellion
against the Imperium (worlds that don\'t pay taxes and follow Imperial
rules).

>What is the Imperium, what is the value of Imperial Citizenry, what does
>the Imperium consider itself sovereign over?

It really is sovereign over everything.  However, doesn\'t involve
itself with local maters.  (Much like the Roman Empire and subject
kingdoms).

To make this more intelligible to everyone:  

Suz plays Dr Mira Hasta-Rur, an ex-Scout MD, in my AKUS MOBY game.
Ricardo O\'Brien, played by the heroic Bruce Johnson, has just saved the
ship from disaster by manually shutting down Reactor One after a pipe in
the secondary cooling system blew.  In the process he got several burns
including a *badly* burned hand.  Now, after 18 hours in "regen" Ricardo
is running around trying to use his still healing hand and Dr Mira is
threatening to "tight him to a pole" to keep him from using it.  She\'s
already told him he can\'t have any beersi while on the pain meds, and
he\'s not taking it very well.  ;->

There are a three basic situations.
  1 - being in the wrong place. Either a strategic location or just all the worlds
      around have joined. After around 50 the Imperium had a policy of "forced"
      incorporation of worlds within its borders who weren\'t already members.
      Usually this was not a military invasion, more strong arm economic
      pressure and political manipulation; but the Imperium was not averse to
      sending in the marines when it felt the need.
  2 - Support of piracy (not wanting to relight the fires). Give succour to pirates
      and if the Imperium finds out you\'re in like it or not! (with a new government)
  3 - You\'ve got something they want badly enough. Very similar to situation 1.

No not normally. Don\'t tamper with the local situation. You are more likely to 
get worlds to join if you have a hands off policy with regards to local autonomy.

Balkanized worlds are treated as seperate nations, but there may be
diplomats and negotiators (Scout Service?) who mediate between such nations
and attempt to bring the parties to a certain course of action.  They would
not use force to bring about the desried changes, but they may withhold
certain types of aid or offer certain bonuses.

IMTU and in my opinion in the "Canon" Traveller Universe the Imperium
cannot be so "hands off" that local governments can act how they please
with impunity.  Certainly, the unwritten Imperial "Rules of War" Are an
example of the extreme limits of local behavior.  If a local government on
a balkanized world used Nukes, for example, on a neighbor, that government
would probably be declared "unlawful" in the eyes of the Imperium, and I
would think that large troopships would begin to appear overhead, which
would go away once the situation was stabilized.

A sticky point I always have, though, is the limits of individual behavior.
If I kill a person (not that any of our heroic PCs would ever do such a
thing - except in self defense) and the local gov\'t thinks I should be
prosecuted (or has already held the trial and sentanced me to death) can
they appeal to the Imperial government to have me extradited back to the
planet in question?  If not, then killers can roam from place to place,
leaving a trail of bodies.  If so, the not-so-fair governments can
extradite people they don\'t like on trumped up charges.  There must be a
middle ground somewhere there...any ideas?

OK there is 2 kinds of PEN.... in TNE... REALLY ....
One is the rateing this is for small arms  and is the number of dice
subtracted from the DMG of the weapon. As most hand held man portable
weapons don\'t penatrate that much this is the only one you have to worry
about until you get to vechicle combat.

The INVERSE of this 1/PEN is used then to determine penatration... multiply
this number by the aromr of the vechile and subtract that much DMG number
that is a part of it... as it is writen in TNE product as 1/pen:DMG - 1/PEN:
DMG - 1/PEN : DMG
per the range bands...

It would seem to me that if one nation would begin to make trade 
agreements with the Imperium, the others would follow suit.  All the 
nations (superpowers anyway) would then be "in" the imperium, and I 
would think that the next step would be for the establishment of 
something like our current UN, if it doesn\'t already exist.  And the 
Imperium WOULD NOT have a seat on the security council.  This would 
provide a world voice, but allow the balkanization to continue until 
such time as the world society as a whole developed a world government 
(and this may never happen, IMO).

For instance, the US in the Balkans.  When moving troops, supplies, and 
stuff in there, one of the concerns was that each faction needed to 
receive some benefit from the agreement with the US/UN.  So, money 
flowed into all the coffers in the form or payment for goods and 
services received to include shipping of stuff, trains, road repairs, 
etc.  All to keep the sides happy and to make them come together.  
OBTrav, other factions would be afraid to be left behind by the 
developments of favorable trade agreements (weapons?) between the 
Imperium and their enemies...  Would tend to bring the sides together in 
a big way, I would think.

I have no thoughts yet on the extradition points....

off-planet? Can the planetary gov\'t appeal to the Imperium for extradition?
But can a repressive gov\'t create trumped-up charges and extradite
innocent people into their gov\'t\'s evil clutches?

IMTU the "middle ground" to this is Imperial Law vs Local Law.

The Imperium has created a list of offences, some of which are
considered Les Majeste (against the crown) and some of which
are considered common-law crimes. 

Les Majeste crimes are prosecutable by agents of the Imperium,
on any world of the Imperium, whether the local government
is investigating or not. These would include crimes such as Sedition,
Treason, Espionage, Murder of an Agent of the Imperium, etc.,
crimes that are specifically directed against the Imperium or
that deliberately fly in the face of Imperial Authority. If there are
specific moralities or agendas the Imperium feels are central to it\'s
mission, crimes in these areas may be included as Les Majeste
crimes as well - Slavery, Hijacking and Piracy come to mind.

Nobles may also have rights to Imperial Justice - they may insist
that charges against them be applied in an Imperial court, as inflicting
local laws and punishments on them may be construed as an
affront to the Crown, which "owns" these nobles. Nobles might also,
in some grey area cases, push a government to suspend local
laws from being applied to them (such as blasphemy laws from
a religious dictatorship), but this will depend on how influential the
noble is and other matters of circumstance. Certain Imperial Agents
may also claim this kind of protection, but as most of them are
nobles anyway(ambassadors, inspectors, etc.) it would be rare for
this to be a problem.

Common-Law Crimes that fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire are
a much greyer area. These are crimes that are usually illegal on every
planet of the Imperium, but may not be, or the perpetrator of the crime
may be beyond the jurisdiction of a planet where the offense was
committed. If the crime extends to other planets (which may have
conflicting legal systems), the Empire may also become involved.
The idea of the Common-Law Crimes is, in some ways, like the
Imperial Rules of War - designed to be ambiguous enough so the
MoJ can get involved whenever them deem it necessary.

Example One: Gile Theron runs a passenger line from his offices
on a Law Level Zero planet. He prints off several thousand fake
middle passage vouchers for his competitor\'s passenger line and
distributes them sector-wide in an attempt to give his competitor
a PR black eye. Gile never leaves his law level zero enclave, but
some of his distributors have turned crown\'s evidence. As the crime
extended across multiple planets, Imperial MoJ agents can arrest
Mr. Theron.

Example Two: Maria DeSandri is accused of Blasphemy on a planet
with a strict religous dictatorship. She has managed to escape the
planet, and is hiding at a nearby mining colony. Her crime was entirely
local, and not covered under Imperial Common-Law Justice, so
the Imperial MoJ will not act on any request from the religious
dictatorship to punish her. If Maria is smart, she will hide in a system
that holds kidnapping as illegal and has no strong political links with
the religious dictatorship, otherwise some fanatics may show up at
her door some night and make her disappear (which may happpen
anyway).

Example Three: Jor Thanagar is accused of murder by the same
religious dictatorship. He flees off-world, claiming the charges are
completely fabricated so the R.D. can get him for a Blasphemy
charge. Murder _is_ a crime covered by the Imperial Common Law,
but since Jor managed to flee into Imperial Space his crime must
be tried in an Imperial court. Again, Jor may wish to flee to a safe
system - the R.D. might decide they can\'t win in an Imperial court,
and try to spirit him away instead. Also note that the R.D. can
try and convict him in absentia, leading to adventurers being able to
brag about "having the death sentence in seventeen systems". <g>

Example Four: A Crimelord has esconced himself on a law level zero
planet. He murders a member of a visiting starship crew. What he
did is not illegal on the world the act was performed on, but does
fall under Imperial Common-Law Crimes. If the other members of
the starship crew can get the nearest MoJ office to take notice,
they may be able to get the Crimelord arrested. They may also
decide this is too iffy and would take too long, and decide to
beam laser the guy\'s villa into slag instead. (This is the rarest
situation for Imperial involvement. It is based on a legal opinion
that in situations where no local law is present, the Imperium can
treat the situation the same as it treats interstellar space. There
would have to be no local government in a position to object,
and an interest from the local MoJ for such an intervention
to take place.)

Imperial Common-Law also covers day-to-day activities between
planets - crimes committed while travelling on starships, or committed
against starships, crimes committed on Imperial territory (such as
Starport Extra-Territoriality Zones).

Note that planets with high Law Levels and esoteric crimes will
closely secure their starports - if you\'ve just been sentenced to
death for accidentally tearing a photograph of Our Beloved Leader,
getting to the starport places your out of the local police jurisdiction.

Note that this system may encourage Bounty Hunting. Many planets
may wish to "extradite" (i.e., kidnap) criminals who have escaped
jurisdiction of local law. On some planets it may be legal to take
someone if you are a Bounty Hunter, but once you are in Imperial
Space (travelling from one planet to another, for example)
the Bounty Hunter could be charged with kidnapping as a
Common-Law Crime. Thus Bounty Hunters will be secretive and
illegal, even though the local MoJ may turn a blind eye to their
activities as long as they toe the line on some unwritten code.

IMTU: Mudrer is a Imperial crime and I treat it like fedual crimes are in
the USA. MOJ officers come after u. with hi-tech equipement to solve the
crime. I treat the MOJ like a conbination between the FBI and US marshals
they have seperate branchs under them. and they deal with Imperial crimes
like treason or too many weapons and the like.

IMTU, which is nothing like anyone elses I hope...

Balkanized worlds are not even in the 3I as full members.  They may be
assoicate members, but until there is one government, they are not full
member worlds.

IMTU, if a nation within a BW used nukes on a neighbor, forget about a few
troopships.  The 3I would invade the planet, kick out all the governments &
set it up as a fully Imperial World.  Meaning that it is under the direct
control of the 3I.

Yes, treat the 3I as the US.  Murder is a local law, not a fed law, but a
state can extradite a person only after a hearing before a fed judge. 
Works for me.

BITS is *trying* to sort out distribution in the US and Canada, but we have
two problems - (1) we get no replies back from distributers and (2) we are
all working full time so it gets awkward mounting a sustained attempt to
get a reply.

Do you want to send me URLs/email/snail mail details...? I can pass them to
Andy.

That may be an idea - we initially rejected Hyperbooks as we don\'t want to
distribute the material as on-line docs (yet).

To my knowledge *no-one* has approached us.

We know we have a big market in the US, and if anyone wants to email me
with contacts etc were we can get distribution sorted out, I will make sure
Andy gets them.

The TML has several BITS members. A few of us have been involved in
writing, running or otherwise working for BITS. Andy and Sarah Lilly run
BITS, and have final responsibility.

Andy has had an increase in real life (tm) workload, a bereavement in the
family and also a short holiday. If you need to contact him urgently and he
doesn\'t respond, please let me know. Several of us are working as lurkers
and editing out relevant TML sections for him to respond to or keep in the
know...

As it stands we have a heavy work load the next two months - GenCon Uk
approaches and we need to build up stock of the new books already released
(101 Governments), prepare others (hopefully 101st Spaceborne and 101
Religions, possibly 101 Gadgets or Cultures), write some tournament
scenarios (1 out of three written, two in progress), continue working on
software material (supporting Rob Prior\'s work), .... as a result, you may
not see many responses in depth.

He is interested. We had a discussion about the US market at GamesFest 98
and have had a few more leads.

According to your header you are at -7hrs off GMT. The UK is currecntly at

Imperium Games no longer have a licence for Traveller, and have been
prevented from shipsing any existing stock due to a dispute with FarFuture
Enterprises.

BITS/CORE has a licence to produce material and is continuing with the more
generic 101 series (designed for T4, but usable with CT and MT)

The T4.1 (ie revised and expanded T4) playtest draft set the date as 97
Imperial. This was seen in later books by IG eg Missions of State. The date
would currently be 98....

Milieu 0 runs from 0 to 200. Buy the hardback campaign version if you get a
copy as the extra material includes a timeline...

IMTU, if the person is identified while in still in the base system, but
off the planet (aboard a starship heading out or whatever) the Imperium is
empowered to return that person to the planet to stand trial.

If the fugative makes it to another planet, the accusing world has to ask
for extradition.  This is pretty easy in cases covering "universal" crimes
like murder, but can get sticky when the offence is not considered a
criminal act by Planet B.

It would be much easier to simply accept a few of the governments as
members.  Then watch as the other nation\'s populations grow envious of the
economic boom the Imperial states experience.

Picture what would happen if the aliens made a treaty with Ecuador, and
traded only with them...

I volunteered to Andy several months ago to distribute the 101 products
personally, out of my home, for no charge, provided all expenses came out
of (gross) sales.  This included taking a proof to a local printer and
printing on 8.5 x 11 inch paper, dealing with color laminated covers, etc.

I know for a fact that Jo Grant offered to (using my color printer) produce
and distribute 101 Cargos and 101 Plots from his (then) temporary U.S.
location.

Both offers were not taken up.

I charitably assume that they want a more professional vector for
distribution.  My offer, however, is still good, and what\'s more, I assumed
(and assume) that if a \'legitamate\' publisher/vendor comes along I will
immediately cease operations/rights/whatever.

But then, I suspect this offer too will go for naught.  Besides, there are
other people in the U.S. closer to BITS than I who are more likely
candidates for informal distribution.

I didn\'t say there *weren\'t*, just that there *shouldn\'t* be.  ;-> 

For game purposes PEN should be PEN, whether it is penetrating body
armor, hull armor, or unarmored skin.  Why not have one simple (even if
not quite as realistic) way to handle it?  

And the same goes for rating the DV of the weapons!  There\'s no need to
have one type for vehicles and another for personal combat.

Well, Matt, It is a subject of contention even amongst my GROUP, let alone
the list, but I\'ll give you the run-down from my TU.

1) The imperium is a feudally organized alliance of worlds, with certain
trade and legal restrictions. Basically, the Imperium has the following
powers: To raise and maintain a military; to declare interstellar war; to
tax WORLDS and NOBLES (but not other individuals); to establish such public
services as may be needed on an interstellar scale (the IISS, ISIS, IMOJ,
Etc); to Regulate, issue, mint, distribute and control interstellar
currency; to define the basic rioghts of a sophont; to define what is a
sophont and therefore a protected being.

The imperium sets certain requirements of member worlds: No perpetual
slavery; That Murder, Treason, and Piracy shall be crimes throughout; that
imperiam officials shall not be prevented in their duties by any local
laws, that a per capita and percentage of GPP Tax be paid annually; that a
certain value of land be lain aside for the issuing to imperial noblemen;
that the government select of allow to be selected for them an Imperial
Liaison, who shall then be henceforth the Nobleman of said world,
responsible for the maintenance of and administration of the Starport
Extrality Zone.

The Imperium reserves only a few rights unto itself: Determining tthe
nature of being a Sophont; Use of Chem, Nuke, Bio, or other weapons of mass
destruction; the right to allow psionics (although not to prevent local
prohibitions); the right to appoint imperial noblemen; the establishment of
minimum safety and commercial regulation of spacecraft and starships;
regulation of interstellar Commerce.

2) WHat the military defends is the Imperium\'s Interests: The member
worlds, especailly those holding imperial installations; the trade which
makes the economy grow; the freedom from outside oppressive forces; the
common peace.

What they do in cases of local member worlds warring with each other is
monitor for CBR/NBC warfare... and if found, stop it by pre-emptive strike
and re-alignment of the using government. If a member world breaks the few
imperial laws, the imperium may simply increase the tax assessment, or
totally wipe out the structure of government... in any case, the imperium
does not require that a planet (or even nation) join, but once it does,
there is NO LEGAL SECCESSION, save by Imperial Decree.

  It is sad to see backsliders denying the truth of earlier works. It
seems odd that the theories of the early pioneers (i.e., Striker by GDW)
should be denied in favour of a body of revisionist apologism cobbled
together by the lowest of party hacks (i.e., IG). I assume that some
unforeseen trouble is responsible for your intransigient attitude, but
I feel that your reputation can yet be rehabilitated by a full retraction
before a Peoples\' Tribunal. What date would be convenient for you?

  BTW, any word on infiltrating the TML RoM TL Flamewar/Debate of 1997
Historical Re-enactment Society? This might be a useful platform for
expounding the message of Traveller Socialist Conspiracy.

Good question that.  It is my understanding that one of the 
members of this list has been given permission to post this 
information in some form by Marc Miller.  I have asked this person 
to hold off publishing it for a bit longer, as I am still engaged in a 
seemingly fruitless effort to extract a bit more payment out of IG 
before sicking the law firm of Dewey, Cheatham, and Howe on 
them.  One of the works for which I am unpaid is the 
aforementioned extra material.

It is my hope not only to see it published, but I might just write a 
little bit more to supplement it... :-)

BTW, there is still a lot of IG material in channels, and most of the 
FLGS\'s I frequent still have some of the stuff, so it might not be too 
late to find it before it goes.

The official State Of Traveller

There Hath Been or Will Be 6 versions of Traveller:

Books 11-3, the original little black books 1977, aka CT

MegaTraveller	198?, aka MT

Traveller, The New Era, 1985-ish (iirc), AKA TNE

T4, the IG barracks publisher, 1987-88 aka T4

T4.1 Marc\'s current version-in-preparation, TBA? A publisher is being
negotiated with from the last thing Marc said about this, he\'s looking,
IIRC at a late \'98 -99 timeframe.

Gurps:Traveller, being printed feverishly as I write this, eta,
September. AKA G:T

The story line goes from the old Imperium, that of the 5th frontier war
(CT)to the rebellion (MT), to the aftermasth, collapse and rebuilding of
civilization(TNE). In story line terms, this covers the timespan of
roughly years 1100 to 1220-30 of the Third Imperium dating.

T4 covers years -20 to 200 of the Third Imperium, or the founding years,
again a time of rebuilding civilization.

G:T shares time with CT up to the precipitating event of the Rebellion,
and veers off into a parallel timeline where Strephon is in fact, not
assasinated, Dulinor is killed in a mysterious explosion en route to the
meeting where he was going to kill Strephon. Sort of CT with the
heightened tensions of the Rebellion, but none of the outright warfare.
Helmed by none other than Loren Wiseman, which, imo, bodes quite well
for the quality of the work.

T4.1, I\'m not sure what time frame is covered, although I do know that
the Third Imperium is definitely the setting.

	Seriously, IG is not only out of the Traveller business, but
prohibited by Marc Miller from attempting to dispose of any of their
remaining materials. Note this doesn\'t affect game stores or
distributors who already have materials available for sale.

No offense taken.  I agree with you, actually.  What I would have 
liked to take the opportunity to do would have been to build on what 
was done with M0 with additional material.  One of the things we 
proposed, but which never got done in light of IG\'s year long death 
dance was to develop specific sectors that we thought would be 
useful, within the context of the M0 campaign, and basically 
develop the sector within the context of the 150-200 years covered 
by M0.

For example, we proposed a sector book on Antares.  This would 
get into the politics of the region, the cultures that had grown up, 
detailing key worlds, the races minor and major that populated it, 
and source material for the key events in that sector the 200 (The 
chief ones being the Julian War and the Antares Pacification 
Campaigns, of course).

I come from the school that says that Traveller\'s universe is TOO 
big, and too generic to do sweeping sourcebooks that cover the 
entire Imperium with anything more than a broad political brush.  
Get too detailed into anything else, and you quickly run out of 
space.  The suggestions we had were to take specific backdrops 
and paint them in more detail, both as a play aid for lazy referees 
(count me in this category at times), and as an example for others 
to draw inspiration from/plagiarize for their own campaigns.  If M0 
became the campaign setting for T5, I\'d like to see this approach 
used.

Like it or not, the period covered by the original M0 time period (0-
20) is primarily one of politics and economics.  Exploration played 
a big part, and I agree should have been a bigger part.  On the 
other hand, exploration with an eye to economic development 
would be the hammer to knock the nail in from Cleon\'s perspective. 
 Jo Grant\'s work on that topic is good.

Realize the constraints the authors worked under.  The other 
authors were given 3 weeks, and an outline to work from that had a 
heavy political emphasis (Each did about 15000 words).  I 
personally did the same amount of work as the others in about 48 
hours after one of the original contracted parties backed out for 
personal reasons.

The 1997 draft proposal which we (Joe and I) submitted for 1998 
product release would have answered a lot of these concerns.  
Sadly, due to IG\'s well-documented money woes, that didn\'t come 
to pass.

Believe me, I\'d love to give the setting a second go, because I think 
it had a lot more potential than anything that came before it.

The article implied they were transmitting for about an hour (so it\'s 
basically one Traveller space combat turn.) 

To be honest, I doubt this will help with salvaging SOHO, but it\'s probably
the record for radar detection of a man-made object...

Mathematically they were equivalent, if I recall correctly. A personnel
weapon might be rated with DV 6 and pen 1-2-3 (meaning it would do 6 dice
against an unarmoured target and go through 6, 3 and 2cm of armour at the 
three ranges.) A vehicle weaponw tih the same performance would have a 
PEN of 6-3-2, which just directly gives how many cm of armour it goes
through. THis is pretty reasonable; vehicle weapons are mostly shooting at
armoured targets, personnel weapons mostly care about damage to un/light
armoured targets. 

(Lasers are kind of an anomaly in this, but are more for space combat than
vehicles anyway.)

	I\'m keeping my mind open about salvage. If anybody\'s interested,
BTW, I can post a layman\'s explanation of what went wrong, and how
NASA hopes to salvage it, seeing as I have strong professional
interest in this area (I do Air Force satellite ops engineering for a
living ...). I\'m already preparing a "lessons learned" briefing for
both our operations crews and satellite engineers on the subject

Thought you would enjoy this.

From The University of Oklahoma, School of Chemical Engineering, a Dr.
Schlambaugh\'s class.(The good doctor is famous for asking final exam
questions like, "Why do airplanes fly?")

In May, 1997, the Momentum, Heat and Mass Transfer II final exam question
was, "Is hell exothermic or endothermic?  Support your answer with proof!

Most students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle\'s Laws or some
variant. One student, however, wrote the following:

"First we must postulate that if souls exist, they must have some mass.  If
they do, then a mole of souls also must have a mass.  So at what rate are
souls moving into hell and at what rate are they leaving hell?  I think we
can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell it does not leave, and thus
no souls are leaving.  As for souls entering hell, we must look at the
different religions that exist in the world today.

Some of the religions state that if you are not a member of their religion,
you are going to hell.  Since there are more than one of these religions,
and people can not truly belong to more than one religion, we can project
that all people, and therefore all souls, go to hell.  With the birth and
death rates what they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to
increase exponentially.  Now, we must look at the rate of change in the
volume of hell.  Boyle\'s Law states that in order for the temperature and
pressure in hell to remain the same, the ratio of the mass of souls and
volume of hell need to stay constant.

So:

A) If hell is expanding at a rate faster than the rate at which Souls enter
hell, then the temperature and the pressure will drop until hell freezes over,

 or 

B) If hell is expanding at a rate slower than the rate at which souls are
entering hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase
until all hell breaks loose.

So which is it?

If we accept the postulate given to me by Theresa Banyan during Freshman
year, that "...it will be a cold day in hell before I sleep with you..."and
take into account the fact that I still have NOT succeeded in having sexual
relations with her, then "A" cannot be true.

Thus and therefore hell is exothermic. QED "

The student, Tim Graham, got the only "A".

That *is* an interesting area that hasn\'t been covered very well up to
this point.  In fact, has the whole Julian Wars/Protectorate area been
officially covered at all?

That\'s why I suggested restricting the area and time covered.  I don\'t
remember if there is official timeline already established before T4
that detailed just exactly what happened during the -50 to +50 period,
but if there wasn\'t, I\'d have slowed the Sylean\'s down and made the
Interstellar Confederation and the Star Kingdom (I think that\'s them) much
more serious threats.  As it stands in the M0 timeline all the serious
threats to the 3I\'s immediate survival were wiped out early, and it
wasn\'t until they had spread over the whole Core sector that they
started running into stiff resistance...maybe I\'m wrong, but that\'s what
it seemed like to me.

I realize that, but not everyone wants to play a political campaign and
the exploration presented was really exploitation, it seemed to lots of
folks.  M0 presented a "darker" view of the Imperium\'s imperialism,
probably quite realistic, but not the "pure and noble" view that some
wanted. Oh, I\'m likely overstating the case here, so don\'t mind me.

Yeah, I had high hopes too.  Of course, I doubt I\'d ever be happy
playing in somebody else\'s universe anyway.  Maybe the real reason I
advocate a short time/compact area approach is so I can use that as a
seed and grow my own universe around it.

Why not include the UPP\'s in the back, ala MegaTraveller Imperial
Encyclopaedia\'s listing of the marches, with a UPP Guideline Sheet ala the
one from Spinwarrd Marches Campiagn. Should only take about 5 pages total
for just the marches, if laid out correctly. (2 col at about 9pt text,
preferably something clean to read, like Helvetica or Arial). The listing
of all the Marches UWP\'s from the MTJ "Domain of Deneb Special Supplement,
with full UPP+Ext+StellarData takes 3.4 pages in two collumn.

The benefits to those making crossovers between GT and the rest of the
Traveller Systems/sourcebooks/etc would be wonderful.

All the Text needed to explain it would be something like the following:

"The UPP (Universal Planetary Profile, sometimes called UWP or Universal
World Profile) is a Traveller shorthand for describing a world. It is
included here both for allowing easy use of this supplement with Traveller,
and so GURPS: Traveller players can decode UPP\'s found in products for
other editions of Traveller. The chart on pg. XX gives the values for the
various entries. The order of data is: Starport type; Size;
Atmosphere;Hydrographics (coverage of the surface with fluid or ices);
Population Exponent; Government Type; Law Level; Tech Level. The "PPG" data
is Population Multiplier, Planetoid Belts in system, and Gas Giants in
system. Stellar type information is presented in the normal scientific
method, as presented in GURPS: Space. Trade classifications indicate
certain economic, physical, or social factors of the world."

Loren, SJ, you have my permission to use this text if you want. Just,
PLEASE, include the UPP\'s.

I have just joined the list a couple of weeks ago and have been enjoying
the discusion here very much.  I started playing Traveller with it\'s
initial release way back in the 70\'s, but due to the pressures of real life
had to give it and my books up just as TNE was coming out.  I have since
been in the process of rediscovering the game and I am thrilled to see that
it has returned to its roots.

I would be interested in finding a group playing Traveller in the Dallas /
Fort Worth area.  Just drop me a note if you know of anyone looking for a
new player.

Uhm, the UPP is a tabular data format, you have to use a monotype, courier 
(shudder), or one of the grotesque monotypes (monaco is one of my favorites).

But that is roughly 3,000 words (quite substantial in a roughly 100,000 word 
suppliment).

I think theres a better chance of it being put it on the web or maybe available 
with a SAE. Don\'t get me wrong, I\'d *love* to see the UPP\'s included, but it 
would be a fairly subtantial "investment" in the suppliment, and I have this weird 
suspision that SJG might not want to include 2-3 pages which are basically 
redundant vis-a-vis GURPS.

I doubt it. This was at the Earth/Moon system\'s L1 point. That\'s maybe
2 light seconds out (closer to 1). Mars, at close approch is something
like 16 light *minutes* away. That\'s around 500 times as far away. And
that means the signal would be 1/500^4 as strong.

It actually went a bit further than you think. We had got about 8
subsectors into Dagudashaag when IG went under.

Shame really, it would have been a nice playground with background for the
whole of M0, competing PEs and some really nice plot hooks (a few
ex-Interstellar Confederacy forces out for revenge - Doug Berry did a
gorgeous ship design).

Last I heard, Bryan Borich was trying to get permission to post it on his

permission as they haven\'t been paid yet. But this is a while back.

The help files with Galactic include discussion of the file formats. In the
course of writing a Perl/Tk interface to those files, I have become a bit
familiar with the details.

I\'d recommend unzipping Galactic and looking in galhelp/qna/data.

The MC is possibly the single most decadent-appearing human being I\'ve
seen on television - which doesn\'t quite fit my picture of a Vilani
noble - but he is suitably obsessed with ritual and tradition.

Methinks you timeeline is a bit off, Megatraveller was published in 1987
(at least, thats the year in the cover of my MT Ref\'s Manual)

Traveller: The New Era was at earliest 1990, and I think 1991 or 2

It was IIRC 1995, in the fall, when GDW officially closed its doors after a
number of "running battles" with vars. dark forces.  That was a depressing
time on this list (or rather, it\'s predecessor).

"Marc Miller\'s Traveller", Published by Imperium Games (May it rest in
peace) was first released at GenCon 1996 amid great optimism and hope.

If any new folks want info on why IG went down, email me privately.  That\'s
one topic you just don\'t want to see on the list (especially if it takes
time to download your email).

No Solomani world in the Solomani Rim is TL 15 in 1110 (ref: the original
Solomani Rim supplement) (I think there was one in Grand Survey that was.)
This implies that either (a) the Solomani forgot to make notes when 
evacuating Terra and hence couldn\'t bring any of their other worlds to 
TL15 even in a hundred years, or (b) Terra - and the whole confederation - 
was only TL14 in 1000. (Do the Solomani even *have* any TL14 units in I:E,
or are they almost all TL13?)

He also made a serious logical error.  Her statement actually equates to "if

Good reasons, but I can think of another.  The UPP isn\'t just for the
players, it\'s also available to the *characters*.  AFAIK, people in the
Imperium know and use UPPs for planets, and can legitimately say to each
other things like "Hey, Eneri, our next port call is Law Level 6.  You got a
body pistol I can borrow?"

To me, this (presumably Vilani-derived) habit of quantifying things is an
intriguing aspect of Imperial culture, as well as a useful shorthand for the
players.  As a cultural fact alone, they deserve to be included.

If I\'m wrong about this, hopefully Marc or Loren will be so kind as to set me
straight -- but I\'ve always had the impression this was the case, from the
inclusion of UPPs in Traveller News Agency articles and so on.

(I wonder if the characters "know their own stats," too...)

I am trying to build an economic model for a TL12/13 balkanised

Both the road network table and the vehicle table on p33 only go
as far as TL8. I know roads aren\'t replaced by gravetics at TL8
(fused roads are available at TL12+).

Does anyone have an eratta for WTH or know what data these tables
should have above TL8 (especially TL12 and TL13)?

Quattro Pro, Excel, and Lotus spreadsheets should interchange for the most part, although there may be occasional glitches. For example Excel calculates some formulas a little differently than Lotus, and Excel doesn\'t like Lotus macros. I like Lotus over Excel, myself, haven\'t tried QP. BTW, I have a Megatraveller starship spreadsheet in Lotus that should be finished in a couple of days, anyone still use MT starships? It\'s nowhere near Andy Akin\'s masterpiece level, but maybe it will help make life a _little_ easier for a rough draft. I\'ll be more than happy (wait, donning battle dress) to submit it for dissection, er, destruction, er, review, yes, that\'s it.

yes, me. It would be a shame if this little ommission would reduce
compability and the chance of player-spillovers into the other system, thus
increasing sales.

There are may MT-heads out here.  My own Excel Spreadsheet got quite a good
thrashing.  New release RSN.  I\'ll certainly take and look at your...then
steal what I like from it for my own use if allowed to.  I\'ll also provide
commentary and critique (having rec\'d plenty, I think I know what ot look
for).

BTW Jo Grant\'s MT Ship Design spreadsheet works under Lotus 1-2-3 (he does
work there after all) and *not* under Excel (Macro incompatibilities, and
some backsolving problems).  I don\'t know about Quattro Pro.

Jimmy Simpson is working on *his* own, too (and had a pretty good one out
there to begin with).  It sometimes seems as though there are more
spreadsheets than users for MT ship design.

Andrew Keith manuscripts by Christmas in what I hope most will consider a
professional format. 

The three larger supplements - "Letter of Marque," "Scams," and "Faldor"
(all originally intended as boxed modules) will be released as large
adventure type supplements, roughly the size/shape/format as say DGP\'s
"Flaming Eye". 

The two smaller supplements, "Planetfall Starport" and "Artic Environment"
will be released in their originally intended LLB (Little Balck Book)
format, like "Duneraiders" for example.

All five J. Andrew Keith supplements will be autographed by Andrew as well
as being fully \'gone over\' (typeset, proofread, etc.), and (drumroll
please) fully *illustrated* with both \'old\' and \'new\' (i.e. previously
unpublished) artwork by William H. Keith. All five supplements (staying
true to the chosen format) will also be folded and stapled with cardstock
covers featuring Bill Keith artwork as well.

OVERVIEW

Below is a simple description of each supplement:

"Letter of Marque" -  First in the "Rogues in Space" series. Set in
Reaver\'s Deep sector on the fringes of the Imperium, it details many/most
aspects of playing/running pirates in the Traveller universe.

"Scams" - Second in the "Rogues in Space" series (or, as Andrew wrote on
the manila folder this handwritten manuscript arrived in - "Pigs in
Space"). Also set in Reaver\'s Deep sector, it fully details playing/running
gangsters in the Traveller universe. 

"Faldor - World of Adventure" - Companion module to both "Tarsus" and
"Beltstrike." Set in the District 268 sub-sector of the Spinward Marches,
this supplement fully details a \'lost colony\' world originally settled by
the Darrians. Features several adventures, and throws additional light on
the Darrian, Sword Worlders, Zhodani, and Imperial intelligence services.

"Starport Planetfall" - Companion supplement to "Startown." Described by
Andrew as "An encounter booklet for Traveller," it details many aspects of
starports and the individuals to be encountered there, as well as
priviously untouched aspects of making planetfall.

"Artic Environment" - Last in the Keith\'s "Extreme Environment" series.
What\'s to say - this supplement explores in-depth the aspects of surviving
on Iceworlds ("Tran-ky-ky" anyone?).

EXTRAS

I am working on several \'extras\' to include with the supplements. They are:

"Imperial Calendar" - Will feature the \'best\' of Bill Keith\'s Traveller
artwork, and will be autographed by Bill. (Only available when purchasing
the entire set.)

"Reaver\'s Deep" - Sector supplement featuring: Sector and sub-sector maps
with matching UWP\'s. I am also thinking of including the library data for
this sector, but am not sure yet.

2 Cluebooks - LLB versions of the original loose-leaf and stapled clue
books for both MegaTraveller I & II computer games.

And lastly, the results/winners of the NPC/Starship contest (HINT - I could
use more than two submissions :). Not sure what size/format this extra will
take at the moment - judging by the present results, it just might end up
being a folio.

RELEASE DATE

I\'ve set Christmas as my deadline - orders will be shipped on or before
December 31, 1998.

PRE-ORDERS

Again, I\'m financing this project \'as I go\' - Marc, Andrew, Bill, and the

Gentle Sophonts and K\'Kree, we are proud to announce that the \'Terra was

as he was known in the ancient Terran Language of France. Complementary

  Hmmm. How about this, Yes to extradition but the persons are tried
in an Imperial Extradition court, by an Imperial Judge. That person
can then either find the defendant innocent, and the charges will no
longer be valid in the eyes of the Imperium but the defendant might
want to avoid ever going back there, or found guilty and turned over
to the prosecuting world for punishment.

  An alternative would be that the Imperium holds an extradition
hearing in which compelling evidence must be presented to show a need
for trial.

Sure, we can always use more rocket scientists posting!

After the rabbit that Hughes pulled out of their hat with their recent
satellite, I\'ll be more open minded, too.

What\'s the scoop?  Are we, for legal purposes, constrained from

No, I\'m not asking just out of morbid curiosity.  After years dealing

One thing for sure:  I\'m tired of calling them Them.  Because if it

Yes.  In fact, as I recall an argument can be made that the Solomani have
a minor technological advantage over the invaders.  I think that most of
the continental army formations were tech-14 for certain.  However, other
sources (like _Azhanti High Lightning_) suggest that the Imperium in
general *did* have a technological advantage over the Confederation.

The other possible implication is that the Imperium ripped the industrial
heart out of the Solomani Confederation.  The Rim is the most densely 
populated sector we\'ve seen in known space, and it was the core of the
Confederation, but the Imperium occupies most of it now.  As an aside,
I\'ll note that the Vegan Autonomous District is an incredibly dense knot
of high-tech worlds; the average tech level per capita nears 15!  (In
the Imperium, 12 or so is closer to normal.)

It may be that there\'s more tech-15 worlds in Aldebaran sector, closer 
to the relocated Solomani capital, and back a bit from the cease-fire
line.  Another possibility is that they\'re doing something like the
TNE Regency of Deneb -- putting resources into building rimward worlds
to tech-14 rather than bringing key worlds to tech-15 (if you think 
this is a tradeoff that they can decide to make).

Imperium Games was a division of Sweet-Pea Entertaiment.  Marc was never an
employee of either entity, IIRC.  He licensed them to produce Traveller.

IG\'s actions can be laid directly in their laps.  They butchered peoples\'
work, never paid anyone that I know of, and generally gave expensive
lessons in how *not* to run a game company.

I\'ve said I would like them included already, but they don\'t have to

    'body' => 'IMTU, things are a bit rougher than in most, it would appear.

The Imperium does not, as a rule, involve itself in local affairs.  It
governs the planets.  There are a certain class of crimes that will bring in
Imperial investigators (piracy in high space, sedition against the Imperium,
possession of nuclear arms, high treason, crimes against the nobility,
etc...), but these are the exceptions, not the rule.  For the most part, if
it happens on dirt, it is a planetary affair.

As long as what you do does not interest the Imperial nobility resident on
any given world, and that the planet government itself does not appeal to
the Imperium for assistance, you are pretty much scott free if you can get
off-world.  It should be noted that (IMTU) while the primary starport of a
planet has extra-territorial status, the auxilliary starports do not.  And
if the primary port happens to be the highport, and you are ported at the
downport , you could have a great deal of trouble getting off-world!

Once you are off-world, your primary worry is that the planetary government
will think highly enough of you to post a bounty.  While most bounties are
not significant enough to warrent immediate attention, if enough bounties
get placed against you it may become cost effective enough for someone to
try and take you.  Most bounties are actually paid to starport officials
("welcome to dirt, may I see your ID please?"), but there is enough credit
out there for a bounty hunter to make a comfortable living.

Generally, a bounty hunter needs only get the fugitive to the starport to
make his claim.  Most planets have local agreements that will allow the
transshipment of fugitives (low passage, of course), once their identities
have been verified.  Payment, of course, does not occur until after
verification.  Bounty hunters are licensed through the Imperium, and abuse
of their position will attract Imperial notice very quickly.

Since every dealing with the Imperium requires some exchange, either of
favors or something more tangible, most planetary governments choose not to
involve the Imperial beauracracy in the location and retrieval of minor
criminals.  However, on occaision there will be a truely notable act that
demands assistance (the use of a plasma gun in a shopping mall leaps to
mind - in the player\'s defense, there were extenuating circumstances that
never came fully to light...;-) from Imperial resources.

First, a bit a background.  IMTU - the Imperium is not necessarily liked by
each planet, but it must be tolerated.  Each planet has a \'Imperial House\',
a building where Imperial affairs are located.  While the Imperial Nobility
cannot directly interfere with a planetary government (unless invited to do
so...), there is a certain amount of activity with is Imperial related that
planetary officials have little control over.

Execution of an Imperial warrant (small \'w\') is one of these activities.  If
someone becomes a person of interest in an Imperial investigation, a warrant
shall be issued by the ranking noble in the area, and filed with the local
government with 72 hours of it\'s execution (note - I did not say 72 hours
_before_ it\'s execution.)  The local government may, upon review, protest
the warrant up to the level of the System Count (who has the final authority
in this area).

Fundementally, there are three branches of the Imperial government that may
be involved: Justice (IMOJ), Security (IBIS/IRIS), or the Military.  What
happens to you largely depends on which branch catches you.

The IMOJ is the way the system is *supposed* to work.  They will make every
attempt to verify the charges, deliver you intact to face justice and ensure
that you have at least an opportunity to defend yourself in accordance with
planetary law.  On the other hand, if you are guilty of Imperial crimes,
they will try you and send you to a *really* unpleasant Imperial Prison
Planet.  Unfortunately, the IMOJ is not usually involved before you are
captured, but is involved assuming you survive the capture process.

Security is the way that no one really wants to look at closely.  If you are
picked up by Imperial Security, chances are you will either be released (no
Imperial interests), recruited, or disappear.  Close friends and associates
may join you.

The military is normally the Imperial arm associated with the capture.  For
fugitives identified by starport officials, the Imperial Army or Marines
will be called in for the capture (usually security forces).  Otherwise, it
is generally the Navy that locates the wanderers.  In any case, assuming
that the fugitive survives the capture process, they will generally be
turned over to IMOJ.  Rarely, Security (or worse, Intelligence) becomes
involved before the transfer is complete.

    'body' => 'Enough people have emailed me (in the two hours since I sent out the offer)
that I am replying on list rather than off, as I had said I would.

The following contains some factual information and some which is opinion.
The factual info is true to the best of my knowledge, but is based on what
I was told, and I may have been deceived at times.  Please bear this in
mind.

I am/was a stockholder in Imperium Games and, I think, had a certain
perspective plus access to some knowledge that others did not (at times
though I was left "out of the loop" and others knew more than I).

Most of this is history that has appeared here.  Apologies for reiterating
this data, but there are many who haven\'t heard it.

IG was originally founded by Ken Whitman (& co., but with Ken in charge), a
man with a good deal of gaming experience, and a lousy business sense.  Ken
also had a bad sense of what was "acceptable" to sacrifice in favor of
getting products out the door.  Several early products suffered greatly
from this (esp. Starships).  I can attest to his good intentions for
Traveller, and his early enthusiasm.  He sold me on IG (I was, of course,
already sold on Traveller), but he occasionally misinterpreted our
communications, a tendancy which, in other contexts, was probably not
exactly good for business.

Ken was forced out of IG by Sweetpea Entertainment, the primary stockholder
who had that right, I believe, as the majority stockholder.  The \'plan\' at
the time was that Ken\'s new company would provide (much of) the material
for Traveller, and that IG (now working from Sweetpea\'s office) would
publish it and handle the business end of things.

Note that, although Sweetpea and IG\'s history was inextricably linked from
that time on, the two are completely seperate companies, and Sweetpea was
never "the publisher of Traveller".

Sweetpea Entertainment (under Courtney Soloman), which holds the movie
rights to both Traveller (I think still) and D&D (which will have a movie
out soon) had good business sense, but lousy gaming sense and no talent for
editing whatsoever.  They are a movie making company, not a publisher or
even a game design shop, so, while they actually collected money from the
distributors (something Ken had neglected) they failed to pay much
attention to the product line.  I think they were passing products from the
contracted writers (some of whom were never paid) straight to the printer
with little or no editing, and, sometimes, improper cutting.  There was
also an implication of some improper bookkeeping on Ken Whitman\'s part at
the time of the takeover, which I honestly believe was either probably
simple carelessness on his part, or something I was told so I was "against"
Ken.  He simply was not an administrator.

In either case, my own original view was that the company would not be
making money for a year or more, until the product had a chance to catch on
with new audiences.  None of the company\'s management seemed to take this
view, and expected to have sales revenues coming in the door much more
quickly.

At some point they hired an editor (I\'m blocking on the guy\'s name) and
products started to improve (Gateway, Nobles, et al I think).  But it was
too late.  Sweetpea is in the business of making money, not making games.
Although it is possible to do both (GDW did for a long time), Sweetpea was
ready to stop throwing good money after bad at this point, and shut down
the operation.  That IG\'s license to publish would need to be renewed was
probably a hard deadline for closing shop.  In the shutting down, IG
probably decided that they might as well treat their creditors as their
debtors were treating them, and they didn\'t pay a lot of people; writers,
Marc Miller, et al.

My understanding is that at that point, not only was IG in the red, but the
company had a big loan out from Sweetpea already, and that company was not
willing to loan any more to pay writers.  It may have been at this point
that an offer was made to writers to pay something like 50 cents per dollar
owed them.  Later, inventory was offered as s substitute for payment.

In general, the Staff of IG (The central office, that is) before Solomon
and Sweetpea\'s takeover was sloppy and slapdash, but had good ideas and
knowledge.  Afterwards the staff was more efficient, but clueless (in terms
of Traveller) and distracted (they were in themiddle of a major project -
The D&D Movie - and only administered IG as there was staff available to do
so).  Anne Flagella of Sweetpea/IG deserves credit for dealing with irate
gamers in a polite manner.

To soften this criticism, without new buyers the game can\'t make enough
money to really support a full time staff (even of one) and pay writers,
publishing and printing costs, shipping, and deal with all the deadbeat
distributors (who, I have been told, deserve much of the blame for the
decline of RPGs in general for their cutthroat practices).  The market that
was buying was not much bigger than the "legacy market".  Traveller needed
more time and publicity to be found by new gamers.

When I invested in Traveller I estimated the chances of huge success to be
about 1 in 10.  About what most start-up companies have for investment
purposes.  I still think that was a correct measure, only now its with
benefit of hindsight, and it turns out IG was on the wrong side of those
odds.

Remember that despite their problems, IG put out as many products (more?)
in two years as GDW did in the entire Megatraveller line in twice that
time.  The quality of the products was very low at times, not in terms of
content, usually, but in editing and formatting.  Other products, however,
were excellent, like Psionic Institutes or Pocket Empires.  Of course, most
of those supplements were written by people who are reading this, and they
should be proud of their work.

There, that will either set the record straight or muddy the waters for all
time.

	Having some experience with WTH from when I was trying to detail
the RC with it, I can tell you that it\'s not very good for that sort of
thing.  What I found was that with only moderate population and TL (like 6
for both) the production totally exploded.  Everyone had many times the
expected wealth for their TL, many times the max food on the table, and
there was still a surplus.  I think the *idea* of WTH is great, but it is
too detailed for an entire world and the values on the tables leave
low-tech societies starving and hi-tech ones drowning in surplus
production.  Pocket Empires for T4 doesn\'t have this problem, but there
are enough other things about it that are nonsensical I refused to buy it. 
	I realize this doesn\'t answer your question, but I\'m suggesting 
that you have only _begun_ to find the problems with WTH.

It busts once per day or 30K which ever comes first.  However, I don\'t
think it works as advertised.  I think its bursts once per day and breaks
into 30K digests.

However, on a more accurate answer:  The digest frequency is based on
posting frequency.  If the list is busy, they will post more frequently
than if its slow.

Can\'t be done, geosynch is dependent on the length of your day, which is not in
the UWP.  However, for a world of density similar to earth, this distance will
be roughly 634*size*(day length)^2/3 - size*800.  If you assume days fairly
close to 24 hours you can call it size*5000 km.

   Unfortunately, that\'s not possible--by its very definition, geosynchronous
orbit 
REQUIRES the planetary rotation period. Everything else you need can come 
from the UWP, with the right assumption. All you really need is the planetary
mass, which you can fudge assuming the planet\'s density is equal to Earth\'s.
But you still have to come up with a rotational
period.

http://www.flatoday.com:80/space/today/073098b.htm. 

How was SOHO detected?

The Arecibo Observatory, located in Puerto Rico, is operated by the National
Astronomy and Ionosphere Center. The giant 305 meter dish is the world\'s most
powerful RADAR. It can transmit pulses of radio energy with up to 500
mega-watts of power. The Arecibo radar has been used to map the surfaces of
Venus and Mars, and to study the properties of near-Earth asteroids.
Astronomers used a technique called bistatic radar to detect SOHO. Bistatic
radar means that two radar dishes work together, in this case the 70m Goldstone
antenna and the 305m Arecibo dish. When SOHO passed overhead in Puerto
Rico, an hour-long series of radar pulses were transmitted from Arecibo in the
direction of the satellite. By the time the pulses reached SOHO, and the
reflections travelled back to Earth the satellite was no longer visible at
Arecibo.
That\'s because the dish is so large that its steering is limited and the
rotation of the
Earth had carried SOHO outside its field of view. So, the 70m radio antenna in
Goldstone, CA, which is 60 degrees longitude to the west of Arecibo -- was
used to pick up the reflections. This is a technique that has also been used to
study the rings of Saturn and Earth-crossing asteroids.

Yes, the printing cost on the two smaller books is reduced slightly, and
the savings will help subsidize the cost of the three larger books, the
added cost of cardstock covers/stapling/trimming, and pay for the printing
of the \'extras.\' Also - although I am not required to pay Bill for using
his artwork, I am going too, because I think he and Andrew deserve to be
paid for their past efforts. In addition, if there is any excess cash left
over, I will be sending an extra couple-of-hundred dollars to Andrew and
Bill as a \'thank you\' for agreeing (free of charge)to sign their autographs
several hundred times.

Count me as someone that doesn\'t want the UPP data in the Gurps: Spinward
Marches supplement, for a number of reasons.

1) Apparently GT will not use UPPs, so it will be meaningless (at best) to
people that don\'t own older Traveller products. At worst, it will confuse
and infuriate them, as it forces them to buy old Traveller products to
figure out what they mean.

2) Most Traveller fans already know the UPP for the planets in the Spinward
Marches, or have it readily available. I can\'t see it changing that much
from either Supplement 3, or the Imperial Encyclopedia (as the SM isn\'t
really involved in the war). Not to mention, it\'s available on the net, in
things like Galactic. So, the data is readily available. 

3) Speaking of Galactic, the UPPs are very hard to decode for most people
without the use of a computer program. I know I have to look what digit is
what in a book, and I\'ve been playing Traveller on and off for around 15
years. And I wrote a program generating random subsectors.

4) Any space used to have the UPP data is space that could be used for
something else useful. It\'s also time wasted by the author, that he could
be spending on improving the book.

5) If Gurps:SM actually has descriptions of all the planets/systems in the
Spinward Marches, the UPP isn\'t really needed. Wasn\'t the whole point of
the UPP just a way to describe systems with bare minimum of effort on GDW\'s
part?

AFAIK, the digest get압 sent when there are enough mails to fill it.

this is the basic type of layout, although this is wholly my text and

Looks like each time it breaks 27KB in size, from my TML inbox. Or, at a

Funny you mention that.  My current IRC campaign is set in pre-
contact Earth, circa 21st century.  I may write about it as the game 
develops, and I\'m not giving away secrets that my TML-reading

A large portion of the **additional material** for the hardcover was 
devoted to the Pacification campaigns, as well as the Julian War.  
About 25% of it, actually.

The Interstellar Confederation and Chanestin Kingdom are both 
gone by Year 4.  Really, there are no big enemies for the Imperium 
until the run up against Menderes and the Julian Protectorate.  
There are pocket empires to be sure (a few examples were detailed 
in M0 campaign), but there just isn\'t anybody big enough in the 
area covered to pose a credible threat to the Imperium during the 
time period covered.

Hmm.  Capitalism with angst?  I\'m not sure I agree that M0 is all 
that dark a background.  Certainly not as dark as MT or TNE.  No 
darker or brighter than CT, in my book.  Brighter in some ways, as 
we have an empire expanding, new worlds being rediscovered.  CT 
has an empire that clearly is not as strong as it used to be 
(territorial losses to Zhodanis & Solomani), has deep seated 
internal problems (anti-psionicist pogroms), and is basically an 
empire in stagnation, whether your universe has Strephon getting 
knocked off or not.

The Imperium **is** little more than a trade confederation, backed 
and binded together by oaths of loyalty and a strong navy.  The 
only way such an empire could be put together is through 
economic expansion, encouraged by political maneuvering, and 
backed by a show of force.

Nobility is merely a cloak to disguise real motives.  No one does 
anything totally out of altruism, despite what people might like to 
believe.  At its best, governments and societies function out of 
enlightened self-interest.  Hard to imagine the young Imperium 
being much different.  The later Imperium (at least as written in MT) 
forgets about the "enlightened\' part.

I see nothing dark in a win-win situation.  Most worlds, by 
accepting Imperial protection, and becoming part of an interstellar 
economy, would materially benefit from Imperial rule as opposed to 
enduring further generations of the long night.  Many worlds in the 
early years of the Imperium would undoubtedly jump at the 
opportunity to import high tech goods, and have a steady flow of 
exports.  Obviously, some wouldn\'t, and there would lie the seeds 
of the Consolidation/Pacification campaigns.

See what I mean about enlightened self-interest?  :-)

No mention on where this world is exactly, so the old searching game starts
again.
This is another thing i liked about the expanded UWP, it always said where
exactly this world was, so finding it on the map is made easier!

remember however, that Traveller TL and Gurps TL DO NOT match!
Thus, there will be a certain amount of confusion, unless there is a TL
conversion-table in the G:T rulebook!
Secondly, why write it out? The UPP only takes about a page to explain, a
page that does not need to be recreated (just take the one from MT), while
the individual entries would be shorter in the long run. And Gurps players
would be weaned on the UPP압 making it easier for them to understand
Traveller sourcebooks and thus allowing them to purchase them without
havibg to also buy the rules!

Weird, and i thought that the marches were only settled by the 3I, with the
only exceptions of Darrian (and the Zhodani, although they also settled
their part).

For what it\'s worth, I hope that they *don\'t* use UWP\'s for
Behind the Claw. Those of us who want UWP\'s can find them readily
enough - or make our own.  The lack of UWP\'s would
help free up the imagination and the referee\'s scope.
I\'m hoping that the world-building format in GURPS:Space
will be adhered to: this is GURPS-flavoured product,
after all!

I don\'t mind, though, if GURPS chooses to post the UWP\'s
on their website as an archive or errata, or if a brief paragraph
is tacked on at the end asking for a self-adressed stamped envelope,
so they can send you the UWP\'s.

Personally, I\'d *LOVE* to see a seperate Reavers\' Deep supplement a la

That *has* to be an instantaneous peak power number, not average power.
(ie they transmit a 1ms pulse every (say) ten seconds; the peak power during
the instant they\'re transmitting is 500 MW, but the average power is 
50 kW. Probably it\'s more like a 1 microsecond pulses at a few tens of

Because of TravChat, I am sent all email directed towards

responses lately. They seem to come in spurts and this last one has 
been a bit more sustained.

I\'ve been as helpful as possible, despite having to break the news to them 
about IG\'s demise (I usually avoid even that unless they ask directly).  I 
do point them to TML.

The phone number of the bookstore is : (702)-261-9577

They all look like they are in decent shape (Fair?). They just have 15 years
of shelf wear.

I think shipping (they are in Las Vegas) is $3 for the first one and $1 for
each additional book. Ask when you call.

The hex location is noted.  Note that William made up an entry as an 
example rather than quoting the playtest files directly.

In writing it out they give you more information (i.e., atmospheric taints, 
info on the starport, etc.).  Plus the paragraph or two of backround 
information each world gets.

Just reading a thread "Navy Movies" in the sci.military.naval newsgroup.

From "Gary"

 Favorites, with some mediocrity and hokum included:
Submarine Movies (in addition to those already mentioned):
Torpedo Run
Operation Pacific
Run Silent, Run Deep
We Dive at Dawn (British)
Destination Tokyo
Crimson Tide

And just out of curiosity, what were the ten most crucial=20
naval battles fought in Traveller history, pre 3I?
I don\'t know, but as sheer speculation, I\'d put them as
1 battle - Vilani, pre-First Imperium
  a battle that marked the Ziru Sirka as the Master
  in Charted Space. =20
3 battles - during the First Imperium: one battle that set the
  coreward limit of Imperial Space vs.the Vargr, one=20
  battle that was "the most serious threat to=20
  Vilani Space", pre-Terran, and one battle that marked
  the epic end of an anti-Vilani revolt.
2 battles - during the Interstellar Wars.  One battle that
  gave the first sign that the Terran\'s were Serious, and a=20
  second that marked the End of the Imperium (The Battle=20
  of Dingir, 8th Interstellar War?)
2 battles - the Rule of Man.  Both of them involving
  warfare among the Naval Nobility, highlighting the
  disintergration of the Ramshakle Imperium\'s leadership.
2 battles - during the Long Night.  One battle being=20
  a pyhrric victory, improvishing two cultures that could=20
  have ended the Long Night centuries earlier, if they didn\'t
  improvish themselves in war. A second battle marking=20
  the height of the pirate Reaver\'s fleet.
1 battle marking the rise of the Sylean Confederation
  as an interstellar power.

OK, so it\'s 11 battles....

Anyway\'s, interstellar civilization has been around=20
- -9235 (The Vilani), and the First Imperium
ruled from about -5273 to -2204 (Offical ending:
September 14, A.D.2299, on Vland, according to=20
http://users.netaccess.co.nz/amv/trav/Library
/Int_wars.htm. ) =20

That\'s over 3000 years for the=20
First Imperium (!), and 9000
years for human interstellar civilization.

That\'s a lot of history with rather limited warfare,=20
but then again the Vilani are more bureaucratic
than militaristic. Moreover, they had a weakness for
genocide, even more than the Solomani, so=20
few subject peoples would rebel twice.

And on the side... the First Imperium became \'decadent\'
from -3000.  If you assume that Vilani trading ship\'s
visited Earth pre-decadence, then the occassional visit
would end at about 900 AD ("decadence" implying the
end of cross-border expeditions by unregistered
\'free traders\', never numerous even at the height of=20
the First Imperium).=20

The interstellar empire with worlds in the marches:

	3rd Imperium/Regency/Domain of Deneb
	Zhodani Consulate
	Federation of Arden
	Sword Worlds Confederacy
	Darrian Confederation

There are unaligned and/or independant and/or client state worlds, as well.

In neighboring sectors:
	Several Vargr polities
	The Aslan Hierate (the portion on the coreward side of the rift)
	Various "Island Cluster" polities in Reft Sector.

I\'ve always assumed that there was some sort of Imperial
(or at least local) accreditation, specifically for skills
such as Pilot-3, so players can advertise for a "Pilot-3"
for their ship.
Similarly there is probably someone willing to handout
"Broker-3" certificates.
Of course, whilst people might boast an IQ of 140, the
UPP is not usually well advertised and your Pilot-3 might
be better advising what to do than actually flying your
ship (depending on your approach to the Stat vs Skill debate).
Lower law level worlds might also have the problem of
unregulated certification authorities handing out awards
without proper testing.
How this applies to skills like streetwise, carousing
and bribery, I\'m not sure. You might be able to use a
criminal record to justify bribery-1 but presumably with
bribery-5 you won\'t have one :-)

From my Prometheus Rising work:

The first would be the Battle of Junction (late 2152 AD) during the 3rd War. This 
was the Terrans first major victory over the Vilani, the defeat of the provincial 
fleet in this battle enabled the Terrans to drive the Vilani from their own territory 
and launch their first substaintial incursion into the Ziru Sirka.

The second would be either Albadawi\'s campaign in the 8th War (a series of 7 
battles, ending in the 2nd Battle of Duriim) which destroyed the Vilani provinical 
forces. Or more likely the Battle of Ganesh (2275 AD) during the 9th War. This 
was a relatively minor battle, but it was the first time a Central Vilani 
government fleet had been defeated since the Consolidation Wars and the 
morale effects of it (it destroyed the populations faith in the Ziru Sirka) were 
very far reaching.

Speaking as a Traveller veteran from 1980, someone who uses
Galactic 2.3 to track system info (Jim V., thankyouthankyou),
*and* someone who dropped over $100 on GURPS books in
preparation for G:T, I also would _not_ like to see UWPs in 
"Behind The Claw".

However...

Loren, would SJG have a problem with posting the UWPs to its
website for us old-time players who would like to use them? This 
would:

1) help minimize printing costs,

2) maintain a link to previously published Traveller material, making
those of us who have it happy,

3) *not* make the use of UWPs _required_ for anyone, making those 
who don\'t use them happy  (I admit I like the text explanations better),
and

4) give some Traveller players who don\'t play GURPS a reason other 
than very occasional TNS postings (which may not be useful to them)
to check out the SJG website. Some may even decide to (gasp!)
consider one of SJG\'s product lines as a future source of fun and
*buy* something. (hey! it could happen).

Now some may ask "why not just derive them yourself from the text
explanations?"  Answer:  I\'m lazy. Besides, I already have them.
For all published eras.

But...

It\'s much easier to read a file of numbers into a computer rather than
key them in and quite a few of the younger members of the TML (or
just relatively newer Traveller players) may not have the info. Making
it available for download on the SJG website ensures the info
availability and allows any relatively new player to mesh any of the
old material they find available with G:T publications.

And if asked where they got the info, guess who gets free 
word-of-mouth advertising, potentially across the world?

Just some thoughts....

(The idea of a website post came from a friend. The marketing greed
is all mine.)

A decent Navy movie to port to Traveller is "Down Periscope".  Kesley
Grammer plays a mverick submarine officer assign a rustbucket old diesel
sub for a wargame.  He has to sneak past the nuclear navy to launch
simulated attacks on Charleston harbor and the Norfolk naval base.
Unfortunantly, one of the Admirals overseeing the games is determined to
make him fail, and saddles him with a less than stellar crew.

Funny movie, and I could easily see a similar scenario for a
Navy-orientated campaign.

Straight to this world:

Transsexual/Transylvania A-867830-E     A622 G2v

Transsexual was seeded by the Ancients with humans 300,000 years ago.  The
mild climate and abundant, edible life lead to a fairly hedonistic society
to develop.  Transylvanians, as they call themselves, grew to excel in
genetic and biological engineering.

The world is ruled by an insular Royal family, who appear to be more
interested in plotting against one another than actually ruling the planet.
 Citizens have great freedom to what this wish.  Society is highly
segregated, with abuse of lower classes common.

Transylvanians have little concept of modesty of sexual restraint.  This
has lead to the world being posted as an Amber Zone due to certain
misunderstandings in the past.  Land at your own risk!

Oddly, there is some evidence that a Transylvanian research team reached
Terra around -2540, landing near the settlement of Denton, Ohio.

Therefore, any UWPs published for G:Traveller will indicate _GURPS_ tech level,
not Traveller tech level.  In addition, UWPs will probably indicate GURPS
control rating, not Traveller law level.  Neither of those changes will
increase anyone\'s understanding of anything....

There is.

And that page should probably be there.  However, aside from that page, a UWP
is basically a way to compress information about a world into a largely
unusable form which is almost impossible to read without a computer, so why
bother actually _printing_ any UWPs?  Just print tables, with column headers,
and people who aren\'t addicted to UWPs will find it much more readable.  If I
were a newcomer, I\'d much rather have:
World Name    Loc  Port Size  Atmos Hydr Popul Govmt   CR  TL Notes

GURPS players, being sane, have little interest in being weaned on UWPs.

Iminent non-payment from IG amongst other things. It was due to be
submitted around a month after IG started to go belly up. At this point
BITS/CORE stopped sending material in case of copyright problems. What was
left to do was complete some sectors, some serious editting to pull it all
in line (IGs failure to let us know what was in upcoming books caused
problems with new Pocket Empires appearing as we worked!) and draft the
drawings/maps. This was to have been a profits to charity book.

Mine for a start. ;-)

It is presently held to see what is going on with the new publisher. It is
possible that it may appear as a BITS publication in the future (but there
are higher priorities in the 101 series at the moment). If all else fails I
will post my subsector and ask Doug if he ever recovered the ship designs
from an Excel crash.

You could in theory use GT and GURPS Lite (which is available free on the web,
at www.sjgames.com/gurps/lite, and is a good introduction to the game
regardless).  In practice quite a lot of other books might be desireable;
obvious likely candidates include:
GURPS Basic <includes quite a bit of stuff you may want, such as psionics>
GURPS Compentium II _or_ GURPS Space <rules for alien atmospheres, gravity, and
the like; GURPS Space also has world-construction rules>

Lower priority include:
GURPS Compendium I <more character creation stuff>
GURPS Vehicles <item creation.  Equivalent to Fire Fusion and Steel>
GURPS Ultratech and Ultratech 2 (a lot of advanced equipment, much of which is
debatable for a GT campaign in any case, because GURPS generally has better
microtechnology than Traveller).

Quite a lot of other books could be interesting, but aren\'t particularly
necessary to Traveller.

Theoretically, GT is sent in a divergent universe in which Strephon is not
assassinated. And it uses the Gurps rules instead of the Traveller rules. Does
that count as the same universe or a different universe?

colonial units as I recall;  there were a few elite Marine formations at TL-14

Now if I can just find a similarly shopworn copy of original Striker
for a price like that, I\'ll be a happy CT collector.
Collecting for reading & ideas, mind you, thus I\'m not picky about
how mint-condition it looks on my shelf.

Thanks Seth, I\'d been looking for a copy of this but all the places
who had it wanted collector\'s prices for it.

Precisely the inspiration I used... as it was airing at the time I wrote
that. It was merely an example to illustrate the type of entries in use.
Since I don\'t have access myself, and someone who does allowing me more
than just reading over their shoulder would violate the playtest
agreement... a non-TU example was a wonderful way of approaching the
situation.

Some material will be suitable for cross-fertilization of ideas.  Prior to
1116, all of the GT Canon is, effectively, the mainstream OTU. Rules
mechanics and stuff derived directly from them will be incompatable.
However, if you go with GURPS, remember that almost all Traveller materials
since MT started have included some background information, and many have
quite a bit, of variing detail levels. GT seems to be going that way, as
well.

Start with GURPS Basic. Everything else is optional.


Add the compendia next. I Reccomend Compendium 1 as a required read/use; it
gives all the advantages and disadvantages, skills, and optional attribute
rules, and will allow you to tailor the feel of the game.
compendium 2 is nice but not vital, especially not for players.
Behind the Claw as soon as it comes out.
Vehicles 2nd if you want to design craft of all kinds.
GURPS Space has a few useful items that may or may not be duplicated
elsewhere; wait until GT is out... when I see exactly what\'s in it, I\'ll
post some commentary.

GT is the same universe up through the CT timeline.  After the
Fifth Frontier War it begins to diverged (particularly when 
Strephon isn\'t assasinated :-).  The game mechanics are
suited for using GURPs with Traveller fairly generally,
the background material is the same for stuff until
they diverge, then it inculdes stuff that doesn\'t appear
in other timelines.  A big part of the GT book is the
library data entries which are fine for a CT or Mellieu 0
campaign if you just ignore the stuff that hasn\'t happened yet.

As Loren mentioned, you probably could get GT and "squeak by"
with GURPS Lite (which can be down loaded for free from SJG).
Getting GURPS Basic would be fine.  Other books have stuff
that you might like but certainly don\'t need to get if you don\'t
want to.

You\'re lucky Walt. I\'ve been looking for a copy of Battle Riders for years;
anyone on the TML have suggestions?

My main interest is in a tactical space combat system able to handle
large-scale engagements at a level of detail greater than Mayday. Can
anyone suggest a good system? Wasn\'t Bruce of the Definitive Sensors
working on a space combat system?

I was ignoring warfare that occurred after the foundation of

There\'s a little known *sequel* to "Mr. Roberts" called "Ensign Pulver"
(i think that\'s the name). It starts almost immediately after the end
of the first movie and has poor Pulver struggling against the crew
who\'ve gone back to deciding that he\'s an ineffectual officer and can\'t
do anything about the captain.

I caught part of that on cable at a friend\'s house. Not bad.

Which reminds me. *Years* ago(early to mid 60s?) I was watching what I
*think* was a movie, but might have been an episode in a TV show.
Anyway, they had an excercise where a US sub was trying to sneak past
patrols into a naval base (I assume it was Bremerton, since I believe
Puget sound was involved). At one point they rendevous with some
"spies" from on shore who are in a small fishing boat with a noisy
outboard. They sneak past at least one destroyer at periscope depth
with the fishing boat covering them. They even have the guys in the
fishing boat drawing diagrams on a clipboard and showing them to the
(barely awash) periscope that\'s on the side away from the ship!

Does that ring any bells for anyone?

ps. After all the comments on the list I picked up a copy of "On
Basilisk Station" the other day. Blast it! Now I have to find a way to
buy the rest of the books! :-)

Streetwise-2, Broker-1, Liaison-3, Brawling-1, Pilot-1, Navigator-1,
Legal-1, Engineering-2

A likeable but disorginised rogue, he is involved in a complicated scheme
to start up a passenger liner between several worlds in the subsector. The
complications involve his attempted exploitation of a recent policy of
unofficially encouraging development of underdeveloped worlds.

(if YTU does this as a matter of offical policy, great. If not, it is a
bright idea of a Subsector Marquis or similar, who has put the word out
that a couple of demonstration projects would be Well Received at court)

His plan involves gaining start-up funding from several different Imperial
authorities for a passenger line between several moderate-population,
low-starport worlds. Needless to say, each of the Imperial departments
thinks it is the only one supporting the otherwise-commercially sound project.

(depending on YTU, the orginisations may include the Bureau of
Colonisation, the Bureau of Trade, the IN [perhaps thru it\'s Pension
Funds], the IISS and individual wealthy nobles).

He claims to be an Imperially Qualified pilot, engineer and navigator, but
his claims are supported by copied documentation - the orginals have been
forwarded to him from the Sector Capital, but are apparently stuck in
Imperial paperwork. In reality, he has been struck off the register pending
his provision of documentation from a badly-failed safety inspection. 

Similarly, his commercial references are from a couple of subsectors away,
and do not stand up to intense scrutiny (he has actually spent most of the
last 15 years doing salvage of small caches of old IN gear, via a fifty
year old datatape of locations of Imperial Reserve Caches. The gear dates
back several hundred years to the war scares accompanying the Solomani Rim
War, when the Imperium feared other attempts at seccession. The equipment
was obsolete when cached, and in most cases is now valuable only as scrap).

His cash position is incredibly poor - in fact, he is broke, and his
administrative and financial skills are clearly not up to scratch for
orginising such a project.

To his credit, he has arranged several contracts for tens of people and
hundreds of tons of cargo to and from each planet - but these plans are
contingent on getting a brand new 2-gee jump-3 freighter to run the routes.

He has also linded up local government permissions at some (but not all) of
the worlds. Closer examination may reveal that grandiose promises have been
made to the local authorities on each.

Carlton is currently seeking crews and trainers for the project. Part of
what has been promised is that the new line will take on a particular
number of trainees, and these people will be up-skilled to Imperial
standards - training that is usually not available for citizens of dirtball
worlds in the boondocks.

Unfortunatly, the plans as written will require too many trainees for the
number of skilled crew on the ship for either safety or proper training of
the trainees ...

Adventure hooks include chasing around the subsector doinf financial
viability on the project for an interested patron (who almost certainly
doesnt want to be told \'No\'), being recruited by Carlton to help run the
project, cleaning up the mess afterwards when failure is finally declared,
being a creditor\'s representitive trying to get money for unpaid bills out
of Carlton, or being contracted to actually find and negotiate for a
suitable ship.

Note : Any resemblences to anyone alive or dead is purely coincidental. Any
resemblences to events connected with <deleted for reasons related to
Crimes Act 1914> are also coincidental. Trust me. This could never happen.

How much antimatter would you need to push an STL colony ship at 1G to,

In essence, I suppose I\'m asking: how many kiloJoules you can get out of a
gram of antimatter?

And, if anyone knows: roughly how long might it take to produce that much
antimatter, if you had, say, a woppin\' huge accellerator powered by a big
solar array on Mercury?

An alternative to antimatter - I seem to recall reading somewhere - would
be magnetic monopoles. I figure, if you can make antimatter in large
quantities, you can probably make monopoles, no? If so, they would be make
a much safer starship fuel than antimatter. But would the mutual
annihilation of positive and negative monopoles provide as much thrust?

Hope someone can help us out on this. I\'m co-designing a hard-SF game
background with former TMLers Ross Coburn, Derroch Elliot, and sundry
others.

Hi folks

I wonder if you can help me out.

I have to try and get hold of a copy of a supplement for Phoenix
Command  by Leading Edge Games called the Hand to Hand Combat Guide.  It
is now out of print so I think a photocopy is probably in order.  If
anyone possesses this supplement could you email me urgently.  I will
recompense people for all costs within reason.

Thanks again

Ummm...are you in the US? If so, LOM should have arrived by now, or by

still got a good four (4) weeks *at least* before it will arrive.

Well, IBM seems to have covered Star Trek with OS/2 Warp.

Do you really want Traveller associated with M$. Go with Mac or better
still, Linux. Functional and cheap to run. I think M$ is better
associated with AD&D, constant reprints, minor fixes and rarely
admitting you were wrong.

And very much in the niche market - exactly what we are trying to break out
of being, no?  ;)

I wish that Traveller had the name recognition that Windows does - rather
than the admiration of the relatively few greybeards that Linux does.

Apologies to the list, normally I try and ignore anything that dips into the
O/S wars...

Rank nobles, and High nobles.  Honour nobility
is granted as a reward for service to the
Emperor, or the Imperium at large: this is
almost *always* a knightly or sub-Baron
rank, IMTU: you don\'t give someone a
political position over the billion\'s
of a subsector only because of fame.

Exceptions have been known to occur:
ie. a genetic engineer with Imperium-wide
fame given Baron rank, and being put in
charge of a thinly-settled subsector.
The exceptions tend to revolve around service
to the Emperor personally, the Imperial military,
or careful political manuvering.

Megacorp personnel are notable for being given
severely-weakened noble positions: for example,
the *Count* Tukera, who merely happens to OWN
a megacorp, yet has a fief of less than 10 systems!
(ONE high-pop system, if playing by Offical Universe
rules.)  Honour nobility is inheritable, I think, but again
is usually a lesser knighthood of one form or another.

(I use a slightly-modified version of Hans
Rancke-Madsen\'s system of knighthood: where the
class of knight is directly related to your
powerbase in population and/or wealth)

Note that Archdukes can grant knighthood\'s, but only
of their Domain\'s order (or lesser knighthood\'s,
IMTU ).

Okay, that lead\'s us to Rank nobility (despite what High
Nobles may say, they aren\'t particularly smelly...).
Basically, they are given a Patent of Nobility strictly
as part of their duties in the service of the Emperor.
They can keep their Patent until death, but it then
revert\'s back to the Emperor: in other word\'s, it isn\'t
inheritable.  Almost all of these folk are Baron\'s,
with the occassional subsector Duke or sector
Senior Duke (subsector Viscount, IMTU).

These nobles work in the Imperial Organs of State,
and while they don\'t run world\'s, subsector\'s or
sector\'s, have the equivelant power. (For example, the
Sector Admiral is often a Duke, while the Imperial
Minister of Trade on Capital is ranked as a Senior Duke.)
Rank nobility are way more common than High Nobility.

High Nobility in Offical Traveller refer\'s
to old, powerful noble houses within the
Imperium, usually holding *dozens* of major
ruling titles, most of which is inheritable.
I\'d guess that there are only
about 100 of these houses in the offical
Imperium, and maybe 10,000 -
100,000 high-nobility total. (Nobles in Offical
Traveller have such small families...)
Lot\'s of these nobles individually
hold multiple titles.

No special term is used for inheritable
noble titles of Count or less.

Note that all nobles of Baron or higher
can vote in the Imperial Moot.

============================

End of "setting the scence".  The Old
Hand\'s can come back now, and review
my personal spin on the nobility....

============================

Now, what about all those second- (and
even farther-back) siblings and relatives?
They have no title or part in the fief: are they
just to be tossed out on their ear?

Hans uses a system of knighthood, setting
people to lower and lower grades of knighthood
the more father-back their relationship is, ending
only at the very lowest level of Imperial
knighhood ("Member of the Third Imperium")
Good enough to set their social standing,
but I\'m currently interested in their relationship
to true noble society.

I\'m guessing that four degrees of kinship is needed
before any relationship is acknowledged. (ie,


A + B
    |----|
  d + C                D + e
    |                    |
  E + f                g + F
    |                    |
  h + G                H + i
    |                    |
  J + k                l + m
    |                    |
  N + o               p + q

The family relationship between the C (main) branch of
the ruling family and the D (secondary) branch of the
family is recognized in Imperial Noble courts until the
N (5th) generation. Any decendant\'s outside of the
primary or secondary line are common, and may
not inherit any form of nobility.

If we use Han\'s system of declining nobility,
and assume that A started out with a
Inheritable Baron title (rank , 24 in Hans system)
then  "H" (the 3th generation,secondary line)
will be of  - at most - rank 18 (Knight of the
Emperor\'s Guard, say), with the equivelant power
of a small nation of c. 1 million people, barely that
of a decent city.  More likely, he will have already
been disennobled to Member of the Third Imperium
(rank 15, the lowest rank of Knighthood.) without any
but the most basic privileges (which is still notably
more than common subjects, but of little cachet
in real noble circles...).  And after the fifth generation,
by default all secondary-line gentry have
their titles changed from inheritable to honour, and
their children becomes commoners.

This put\'s serious pressure on lesser-line gentry
to Do Something to gain an Imperial Patent of their
own.

[Question: just how long *is* a generation, on average,
in the Imperium?  Pure-blood Vilani can hit their 200th
year I believe.  Anagathics (and other anti-aging
treatments) is discouraged among the nobility
as just *SO*  *COMMON*, but Emperor\'s have lived to
150 years of age, and even Archduke Norris is comfortable
with cloning....]

And of course, all this is only applicable to inherited
nobility, not rank nobles.  Honour nobles & gentry can
sometimes pass their title to their designated heir,
but that\'s it: their other children are commoners.

======================

The genechain

The mainline nobles & gentry keep careful track of
their genetic heritage, both live (ie.siblings,
clones, in-vitros) and stored (DNA  samples, blood
donations, etc).  Also, parental records and
genealogy tables are kept at family strongholds,
the Office of Arms branches at Ducal capitals, and the
Central Noble Registry at Captial.

Physical bloodties become more important the
higher the noble rank.  A Rank Baron is unlikely
to care what stupidity his niece-3rd degree
removed got into, but a Regular Baron
(also "Gene Baron" or "Blood Baron"
in the vernacular) is obligated to keep her in the
straight and narrow, or loose respect among the
gentry and the nobility. ("How can you rule 50
Billion people if you can\'t govern your own family?")
The nobility has no intention of having any of their
subjects - or their peer\'s - or the Emperor - decide
that they are Unfit to Rule.

========= Virtu and genus =======

Old Terran nobility believe that they have a Divine Right
to Rule.  Old (First Imperium) nobility believe that
Tradition demands that they rule.  Third Imperium
nobility doesn\'t believe in either of these things, as a
general rule.  The ability to rule must be re-earned
every day, first by securing a base of power, then by
maintaining this base, while expanding the network of
obligation, duty, and control so *ALL* eventually look to
the noble house for leadership and protection.

The Noble Houses rises and falls based on the power
of that house.  Power comes in several forms: most
noble theorists focus on military, economic and social
forms of dominance.  The nobility, unlike 20th century
secularist\'s, understand the place of Virtu (in the
Machievellian/pagan sense of the word): they respect
the power of honesty, bravery, learning, discipline, and
even piety, and prefer to work with Virtu, rather
than against it.

They also believe in the genus of a family, the power
of a family name (The early emperor\'s drew heavily
on the Roman empire for inspiration, and the "genus"
concept fitted well with Vilani attitudes). Everyone fully
intergrated into Imperial culture has a family: nobles
have a House, and all noble houses have certain legal
duties, responsibilities and privileges.

The energy Solomani put into promoting their faith
(monotheistic, statist, or whatever), Imperial\'s put
into their family.  The Solomani tend to have tight
nuclear families; Imperial families tend to
be huge sprawling things, of which  genetic relationships
tend to be a tangle.  Moreover, following Vilani culture,
Imperial families tend to be "jack-of-all-trades" with everyone
in their special slot, while Solomani families - to the extent
that "family goals" exist - prefer to focus on one thing, and
those siblings that can\'t/won\'t do that one thing wander off
to found their own seperated families.


======== Virtu and Virtue =========

The Imperial respect fot Virtu should not be confused with the
Christian virutes  ("But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,
peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
gentleness, self-control.  Against such there is no law."
- - Gal. 5:22-23)  The Vilani never made Love much of a
focus for their civilization, prefering Obligation: the
Imperium follow\'s Vilani though when it comes to absolutes.
Pride (a sin in Christian thought) is considered a Virtu,
while gentleness and goodness is considered fine
in loyal servant\'s, but not for the Nobility.  Long,
multi-generation hatred\'s are *savoured* by most
nobility: of course, people who act this way have no
place in Heaven.

Even so, there are a LOT of Solomani nobility, and a good-
sized, influencial minority are Christian in some fashion or
another.  They don\'t change the basic character of the
Imperium, but they do soften it, tending to round out it\'s rough
edges.

========Imperial Culture =========

The elites set the tone for society in general.
The reverence of the pagan Virtu\'s exhibited by most
nobility - Vilani and Solomani - is imitated by
the typical Imperial, especially Imperials
closely intertwined with interstellar society and commerce.

Money and Power is desired, but not as an end
in itself as much as a way to gain a good and honoured name.
A good family name - even as a commoner - can open
`door\'s that are closed to other\'s.  Everyone takes for
granted that some goals will take year\'s, even decades
to achieve, but Vilani-acculterated societies are quite
comfortable with this mode of thought.  (Typically, the more
powerful you are, the longer the timeframe.)

On the other hand, the typical Imperial is quite capable
of murder if it would promote family/business interests: as long as
it\'s kept "In the fold",  the Imperium isn\'t going to set a manhunt
and putting you in jail, and even if they catch you, a high Bloodprice
is usually sufficent to satisfy both plantiff and the accused.

Originally, the Bloodprice was meant as a way for nobles to avoid jail/
vendetta for killing a commoner. Because all things originally reserved for
the upper class have a way of seeping everywhere, the Bloodprice would by
the 1100\'s be just the way the Imperium does business, IMO.  Inability to
pay the set Bloodprice means some kind of physical punishment, ranging from
lashing ("crimes of passion") to death by torture ("mass murder of innocent
Imperial civilians")

(My Imperium doesn\'t believe in jail cells for physiological reasons: as a
starship-based culture, the nobility doesn\'t like the idea of criminals
using up precious air and cargo space in idleness, even on perfectly
decent worlds.)

Besides a flexible attitude toward\'s killing, Imperial culture is
notoriously unforgiving.  As a general rule, the Nobility has long
memories - and so do the Vilani.  The Third Imperium is not nearly as coldly
genocidal and culturally oppressive as the First Imperium, but it does have
it\'s fault\'s, and one of them is a quickness to anger.  This spirit of
small-scale hatred is shown by the insecessant merchant wars (even by
companies that can\'t make their bank payments), by nobles more than willing
to kill family members who Failed the Clan, by the endless demand for Bounty
Hunters.  To their credit, the high nobility generally put a damper on
things, but watch out if that discipline breaks (as it did in the Rebellion
timeline...)

========Imperial Christian\'s and the Inhuman =====

It is advisable that Imperial Christians not be mistaken for classic
Imperial Romantics, despite their reputation for softness.
They are generally quietly but deeply humanistic, not so
much hating non-humans as much as viewing them as
basically inhuman, not a part of God\'s people
("Christ did NOT die for the universe, but only for the
Children of Adam.").

They do recognise that these inhuman\'s are sentinent,
and even creations of God, and thus worthy of the
Emperor\'s protection.  They don\'t mind the Emperor
giving them rewards and Imperial positions: the
inhumans can work hard, care for their friends,
and be just as morally upright as any human: if they show
respect for God-ordained standards of Justice and Truth,
they should be rewarded for it.

Even so, there is a fundamental distance between
Imperial Christians and inhumans, as the
Christians don\'t believe that the inhumans have
any eternal destiny, either heaven or
hell (except for Grandfather... ).   When you get
right down to it, they just don\'t *care* about the
mystical, traditionalist Aslan or the atheistic, rationalistic
Hivers.  They have been told to spread the Gospel to
every human, which mean\'s missionaries to
Zhodane (however much they might hate psionics), not Lair
(however close the Vargr\'s are to the Solomani).
So long as the inhuman\'s leaves human property, worship,
and lives alone, they can live as they please.

Your typical Imperial pagan tend\'s to view the alien\'s as just like
himself, with furry skin and funny head\'s.  In much the
same way he view\'s the gods, with the Vilani
goddess of love as much the same as the Hindu
goddess of love as the same as the Vegan goddess of love.
A Vargr pantheist in the Julian Protectorate is largely
the same as a neo-Dolphin pantheist in the Solomani
Confederation, despite being at opposite end\'s of Charted
Space.

In contrast, Christ died to save humans, and human\'s alone.
And the Christian God will tolerate worship of Himself,
and only Himself.  And the Christian is not to be of this world,
but of the world to come.

The body and facial signals that suggest this suble but
fundamental form of rejection are quite low-key: the only
non-human race that can even pick it up are the Vargr.  And
even here, \'it ain\'t that simple\'.  Christian attitudes
range from contempt (twisted mutant dog!) to pity
(a simple dog, used and abused by that proto-demon...)
to friendship (With tongues and hands and minds, God
has blessed you indeed!) to curiosity (Does the Vargr
see God as I see Him?) to the cooly cynical (One of Balaam\'s
wolves, I see.).  Most Imperial Christians (indeed, most
Solomani) have a more favourable opinion of the Vargr than
of any other inhuman Major race: the very movement\'s
of the Vargr just "look" right, compared to any of the
inhuman\'s.

The Vargr have problems understanding the dangerous
stability of human societies.  They don\'t understand
why humaniti would obey the command\'s of low charisma
authorities thousand\'s of light-years away.
Judeo-Christian theology, from an all-powerful
God with an unchanging Law, to a Jewish people who have
stayed theologically the same for longer than
8,000 years, to the very concept of the Good Shepherd
who despises the wolves and cares for the sheep,
to a Final Judgement where the Repentent
rest forever while the Damned fry - all of it freak\'s
out the Vargr.

Hard-core Imperial Christians tend to provoke
either intense submissiveness or instant
hatred: the very smell/feel of their belief\'s is the very
epitone of alieness to the Vargr.  The average
Christian doesn\'t cause problems, although there
may be times when the Vargr get\'s this uneasy feeling....

========Christians and psionics =======

Some Imperial Christians are quite comfortable
with psionics.  For example, how many Pentecostal
Healing and Prophetic ministries are there, anyway? And how
many times has the Ministry of Justice: Anti-Psionic
Branch taken one look at a typical Charismatic meeting,
seized the minister, and put him away for 25 years?

Other branches of Imperial Christians consider
psionics as thinly-vieled demonism.  ("Complete
with the [Zhodani] moon-god", as the saying goes...).
Of the 20 most successful anti-psionic officers
in the Imperium, 10 are Imperial Christians.  While
the Vilani is solidly anti-psionic, Imperial Solomani
Christian opinion is split down the middle: currently,
the anti-Psionic faction has a thin lead in Christian
intellectual circles.

The basic query from the Christian point of view
is "...and exactly *who* is providing these powers?"
Within the Traveller universe, psionics looks to be
merely an intergral part of human psychology.
In that case, psionics is just a tool that can be used
for good or evil, just like hammer\'s or starships
or computers or the scientific method.

======Imperial vs. Solomani Christians ====

Imperial Christians are mainly, but not exclusively,
of Solomani or Solomani/Vilani descent.  In both
The Third Imperium and the Solomani Confederation,
Christianity is a minority religion, but much less so
in the Confederation (say, 2.5% in the Imperium vs.
15% within the sphere.)  Humanist Christianity in
the Confederation is much more triumphalistic
than in the Imperium, believing that it truly has a
God-given destiny to rule the universe.  (Despite
that philosophy\'s defeat in the Solomani War).
Moreover, Confed. Christianity is much more focued
in inter-human divisions: instead of Imperial Major & Minor
racial division\'s, or Imperial Christianity\'s human/inhuman
divisions, Solomani Christianity prefer\'s to divide sentience
by...
            Pureblood Solomani
            Mixedblood Solomani
            Alien Human
            Alien Major Non-Human
            Alien Minor Non-Human

Imperial Christians view the first three division\'s as the
result of Solomani politics: no such basis can be found in the Bible.
They would also group the last two together: the important thing
is that thay are not human, not the amount of political
power they have.

Imperial pagans differ from both viewpoints.  They would either
1) Go for only the Major and Minor racial divisions (This is
     offical Imperial Policy).  In this view, it\'s the political power that
     matters. (with the Droyne mentioned only because of the Ancients)

 (This used to be decided by "who invented jump drive",
   but we have this small problem with the Aslan...)

2) do a Vilani-centric ranking:
    Pureblood Vilani
    Mixedblood Vilani
    Cultural Vilani
    All other sentience races
3) group all in one big bundle, known as sentient\'s
      (This view has some
      support in Imperial Law codes)


                  (Note that robotic and non-corporal intelligence isn\'t
even
                    addressed in these rankings)

======== And finally...======

From National Review\'s book review
of _Other Worlds: The Search for LIfe in the Universe_
by Michael D. Lemonick (Simon & Schuster)

Review title: The Empty Heavens by Stephen M. Barr

<begin snip>

 For many people, there seems to be something
 more involved in this search for extraterrestrials
 than simple scientific curiosity.  Very likely that
 something is atheism.  As long as man appears
 to be unique and "alone in the universe," he seems
 to be an anomaly, an exception, even, perhaps,
 a miracle.  How much more natural the human race
 would seem if intelligent life were shown to be the
 quite ordinary outcome of planetary chemistry.
 And so, among Martian rocks and radio waves
 from outer space, the secularist searches for
 evidense which would allow him to announce, with
 strange triumph, that man is nothing particularly
 special.

 For the relogious believer, in contrast, extraterrestrial
 life is not an issue of paramount importance.  God
 could just as well have made one or many races of rational
 beings.  The existance of alien life would certainly be of
 great interest, but it would make no difference to religious
 duty or doctrine.

 This brings me to a highly regrettable aspect of
 Lemonick\'s book.  Although he is a scrupulously
 accurate reporter of scientific matters, he does not
 always try very hard to get his facts straight about
 religion.  If he had, he would know that it has never
 been "Christian dogma" that there is only one
 inhabited world.  He would know that Giordano
 Bruno was burned at the stake for his radical
 theological doctrines rather than for his speculations
 about other worlds.  And he would know that Pope
 John Paul II did not "rescind the Church\'s
 longstanding objections to Darwin\'s tehory of evolution."
 (The Catholic Church never condemned or even
 objected to Darwin\'s theory, and Pope John Paul II
 said nothing, theologically, that went beyond what
 Pope Pius XII said in 1950 in *Humani Generis*.)

 Fortunately, though, Lemonick is more interested in
 the science of the story than in its suposed
 philosophical and religious implications.  An
 so, for all those healthy souls for whom science is
 just science, and alien creatures are just something
 fun to think about, like dinosaurs and Yeti and lost
 civilizations, I recommend this book as a pleasent read.

Ahem. The next MacOS release is *8.5*. And *X* is due next year sometime.

Anyway they do admit they were wrong! The literature for Win98 boasted over
2400 bug fixes!

And Traveller is Win95 these days... everything Marc Miller sent out for
playtest on the drafts a while ago was from office 95.. ;-) Fortunately
MacOS8.1 has filters for that...

Ok, there are *several* problems here. First, at 1 g, you\'ll run into
*major* relativistic effects long before you hit the halfway point.
That makes things *really* messy.

Well, you need a gram of matter for each gram of antimatter to
completely convert it to energy. So the answer is E=2mc^2. 

Energy in joules equals twice the mass of antimatter (in kilograms)
times the speed of light squared (in meters/second).

E = 2 * m * (299792458)^2

Well best I\'ve heard of for even *theoretical* efficiency at producing
antimatter is 1%. So that means that 1% of the energy put nto the
accelerator will become antimatter (at m=E/c^2).

Nope. *WE* can make antimatter. But even if monpoles exist, you\'d need
to *have* one to start producing more (short of some *really* weird
stuff).

Energy is energy.

A monopole is just a magnet.  You can\'t \'annihilate\' it.

What monopoles are good for is, any application needing a magnet.  A monopole\'s
magnetic field is linear in strength rather than inverse square, so it\'ll reach
farther.  Instruments that depend on the strength of a magnetic field are
easier to calibrate.

    'from' => 'aplummer@idirect.com',
    'body' => 'Archduke Dulinor Astrin Ilethian was elevated by Emperor
Strephon at 1104, over the objections of much of the Imperial
Nobility.  At 1116 he assasinated his patron, and started the
Rebellion that destroyed the Third Imperium.

GURPS: Traveller decided to set it\'s breakpoint at 1116,
where Archduke Dulinor dies while en-route to the Emperor.
There are other alternatives: I made a previous post years ago
on an alternative universe where Emperor Lucan successfully
reunites the Imperium.  Here, we will see what would be the
result if Dulinor was more successful in his drive for the throne.

1116: The Archduke has a private meeting with Strephon,
insisting that a major overhaul of the Imperial government be
accomplished.  Strephon refuses: he is perfectly aware of growing
regionalism, declining loyality to the Crown and the infighting
among the nobility, but any radical change is more likely to bring
about chaos than forge a new dawn.

He had previously narrowed his options to two: a swift
decapulation of the Imperial family, or a Quiet War to
undermine Strephon and take his place.  Both options
were fully planned out, but the actual decision was left
to instinct: when he met Strephon privately, that is when the
decision would be made.

During the actual argument in the Offical Timeline, Dulinor
sensed a certain weakness, a certain inconsistency, which
clicked with his intuition: NOW is the time to strike.
In my timeline, that certain vocal tone was missing, replaced
by a harshness that warned Dulinor that today was not the day.

The reason is, of course, Dulinor was actually arguing
with the Emperor, not an actor.  In this timeline,
Strephon wasn\'t called away on the Longbow project.
His actor in the Offical Timeline was trained only for
the typical Court pleasentries and rituals: all of the
real decisions would be made by the Privy Council
until the Emperor\'s return.  The nameless substitute
is an excellent actor, but he simply didn\'t have the full
command of classified information or the experience
with Dulinor\'s personality that he needed.  Simply
projecting confidence isn\'t going to fool anyone raised
from birth to rule: there has to be something behind
that confidence, and *that* was what the actor was
lacking.

In this history, Dulinor return\'s to Dlan/Ilelish, and
the Quiet War was set in motion.  Archduchy agent\'s
spread throughout the Domain of Sylea - the seat of
the Emperor\'s power -  looking for situations
where a few Trillion credits in the right hands would
embarrass the Emperor, while increasing the cry for Reform.
A number of deals were made with large criminal
organizations, granting them money and protection
in return for certain 녅avours.\'  Corporations with close
links with the Emperor were shown to be corrupt
(whenever this was true or not is besides the point).

More importantly, Dulinor\'s agents managed to spark a
major Corporate War between Instellarms, LIC and Delgado
Trading, LIC in Core sector. Despite rigourous
enforcement of the Imperial Rules of War, several
million people died (mainly in production facilities
and financial towers), hundred\'s of Trillion\'s of credits
worth of wealth vanished into the Void due to
financial data corruption and telecommuication
failure, and immense amount\'s of trade was disrupted,
not due to the rather limited attacks on shipping (It\'s
hard to get in the mood when three Trilion Credit\'s worth
of Naval Death is coldly watching every move you and
your opponent make...) as much as the endless transportation
disruption\'s, skyrocketing insurance costs, mass panics,
and capital flight.  By the end of the Delgado War (Delgado
was badly damaged, but kept it\'s MegaCorp designation:
Interstellarms also survived, but took 15 years to regain it\'s position
as a MegaCorp) Core\'s industrial capasity was hit hard, sparking a
regional depression.

[This fracas - running between 104-1121 to 382-1123,
 underscored several Imperial problems, including the difficulty
 Emperor Strephon had in controlling and ending the war, despite
 absolute naval and military superiority. Strephon\'s failure
 to end the Delago War early badly damaged his reputation, and
 indirectly led to his failure as an Emperor.  Dulinor deserves plenty
 of blame for his patently treasonous behaviour, but the dry wood
 was already there.


Strephon at least managed to keep the fire from spreading to other
 MegaCorps, and avoided a massive destruction of Imperial
 wealth and industrial power - all the while grappling with
an unseen traitor in his seniour ranks.]

Dulinor strove not to be seen as openly hostile
to  the authority of the Emperor, instead, he helped
the media make Strephon look stupid or incompetent.
Every failure that the Emperor made Dulinor made
sure was widely publicised, every challange to Strephon
recieved a little extra boost from unexpected sources.
Illegal (aka untaxed) trade activity surged - cutting
deeply into Imperial revenue - while Imperial Navy unit\'s
always seemed to always be a day late and a dollar short.
As life in the Domain of Sylea turned to the worse, Dulinor
made friends among the Younger Nobility, promising
to establish a new order, one that would create a truly new
world for them to shape.  The Archduke also made strenous
effort\'s to patch up his differences with mainline nobility,
while protraying Strephon\'s designated heirs as merely the
Same Old Same Old, who would merely fiddle as the Imperium
quietly disintergrated.

[Residents of the Sylean domain - the core regions of the Imperium -
have difficulity differentiating between "The Imperium" and
Domain of Sylea, for much the same reasons that newscasters
say "the world is watching" when they mean the Western World.]
Finally, Dulinor made the breakthrough\'s he needed.  The Archduchess
of Sol unofically allied with Dulinor at 1125, and imitated his
reforms in her own Domain.  And the Emperor made a
grevious mistake, challenging Dulinor\'s loyality to the Throne
at 1129 without sufficent proof.  The trial was held at Capital
at 1130-1131, and what was initally a solid-cast case became
a public relation\'s disaster when the Crown\'s case was shown to
be built on innuendo, bribed witnesses, and planted evidense by
over-enthisuastic IRIS agents and hostile high nobility.

Vindicated by the Imperial Moot and lionized by the Imperial
citizenry, Dulinor retook his place as Archduke as most
pro-Strephon nobility suffered public humiliation, with a minority
either broken in rank or stripped of their Noble Patent\'s.
Strephon still sat on the Throne, but he was broken as an
Emperor.  Dulinor and his allies closed in for the kill, widely
publishing Prince Lucan\'s foolish actions as a proxy to finish
off  the Alkhalikoi dynasty in the eyes of the public and the Nobility.

As Dulinor secured his succession to the Irridium Throne, he wound
down the Quiet War.  It was fought entirely through proxy\'s and allies,
so there was very little "cleanup" that needed to be done.  Most of
those who served Dulinor well got nice appointments and comfortable
pensions. By this time, the INI of Domain of Ilelish was in Dulinor\'s
pocket.  The result\'s of this war didn\'t dissapear quite so quickly:
a depression in the central sector\'s of the Imperium was in full
swing by 1133, and Dulinor got appointed to reslove the problem.

Archduke Dulinor shifted resources from the Domain of Vland (a
healthy economy, and a centre of opposition to his rule) to the
Domain of Sylea.  The same criminals that Dulinor protected when
they were useful he destroyed when they got in the way of making
Sylea hum again: most major criminal groups will not make any kind
of off-the-record deal with the Imperium after this betrayal.
The Sector & Subsector Nobility was told in no uncertain terms, by
both Strephon and Dulinor, to follow Dulinor\'s masterplan of reducing
revenue to the high-pop, high-tech systems and transfer them to
high-pop, mid-tech and low-tech systems.

Moreover, the megacorps were encouraged to develop and invest in
the lesser high-pop systems, but they were reluctant to do so.  So
instead Dulinor focued on Domain- and Sector-wide corporations,
granting them tax breaks and the occassional subsidy to do what he
requested.  Finally, he promoted population resettlement\' of old
high-tech, mid-pop systems (many of them have had declining
populations for 300 years, like Strogy (Shiwonee:Massilia
A425347-E) ), taking pains to insure that the new populations
will fit in well with the technology requirements: this resettlement
was most heavily done in Core, but was also done in  Massilia sector.

As the depression - now contained in Core, Zarushagar, Massilia
Sector\'s - started to level off  at 1136, Archduke Dulinor began
his Domain Common project back in the Domain of Ilelish.
Each subsector and each sector obtained a Commons,
where the commoners elected representatives via proportional
representation.  They have a limited ability to legislate, but no
ability to control the budget for their area.  Moreover, in response
to Noble pressure, Dulinor made voting eligibility dependent on
family and property requirements; also, one-fourth of the membership
must have knighthoods at least, but at least 66% of the Common\'s
must be *below* noble rank.  Control of the budget, interstellar judicary,
and military still resided in the hands of the nobility.

Emperor Strephon was on a journey to meet with Archduke Norris,
the last major pro-Strephon noble left when he finally died at 52-1137.
Archduke Dulinor was proclaimed Emperor in 303-1137: immediately
afterward, Prince Lucan (now Marquis Lucan) was shot dead by
ex-Grand Princess (now Countess) Ciencia Iphegenia.


Emperor Dulinor immediately set about 1) rewarding friends with new
noble titles taken 2) from old political enemies, or people he simply
deemed untrustworthy.  Going against his advisor\'s, Emperor Dulinor
decided to leave Archduke Norris in place, as a gesture of forgiveness
and putting past differences behind.  Norris didn\'t like how
Dulinor got into power, but agreed with Dulinor\'s goals of reforming
the Imperial System.  Instead of a purge, Dulinor merely undermined
the most vocal and unreasonably discontent of his enemies, mainly by
turning their titles to Rank nobility from Regular (ie: inherited) titles.
As the economic recovery of the Domain of Sylea stalled, Dulinor
held a major meeting at Antares Sector at 101-1139.  The
Council of Dowa (Held at Kimamini, Urnadim:Antares A465436-E)
The Emperor, Archdukes and  certain Senior Dukes outlined the
reforms they felt would work, and proclaimed the Edit of Dowa at
their respective capitals at Holiday 1140.

__________________

The Edit of Dowa had two main portions: one deliminating
the new Imperial Common\'s, and the other directing the reformation
of Imperial culture.

The Nobility would retain control of interstellar legal, defence, and
foreign affairs throughout the Imperium, and their fief\'s and corporations
will continue to have their financial priveleges. However, most other
areas of  government - including interstellar trade regulations -  will be
turned  over to newly-formed Imperial Common\'s, established throughout
the Imperium at the subsector, sector, and imperium  level. (No Common\'s
will be established at the Domain  level).  Appropriate property and
eligibility requirements will be set, but in all cases no noble above
baronet level will be permitted to join,  proportional representation
will be the law, every system in their area of space
will be represented (worlds with lower than 99,999 people will be
represented by a noble-appointed delegate) and the Common\'s
will be subject to bugetary oversight by the nobility.

The Edit also provided teeth to the One Imperium policy of the new
Emperor. While the nobility has no legal basis for creating and
enforcing a unified Imperial culture on Imperial worlds, the Imperial
Common\'s can.  They are elected citizen\'s of their worlds, and can
legimately make law for their worlds to encourage Imperial standards
of culture and living. (Special regulations will be put in place for
balkenized and low-pop systems).

The Common\'s will be encouraged to standardize living standards and
legal systems of their worlds, first on a subsector basis, then sector, and
finally Imeprium-wide. (Nobles will be encouraged to do the same with
interstellar law: )

The Imperial Common\'s are expected to work in co-operation with the
local world government: the more co-operative systems will be favoured
by local nobles, who will effectively control the budget.  Systems that
refuse
legimitate orders of the Common\'s are open to sanction by the Imperial
government, up to and including occupation, dispersion of the inhabitants,
and/or imperium-mandated immigration.

The Emperor will be the final arbritrator of what Imperial Standards and
Imperial culture consist\'s of.

than ever before.

Admittedly, it\'s still the definitely more wealthy than any two other
domain\'s,
but the projections are clear: Domain of Sol will be just as powerful as
Domain of Sylea by 1160.  By 1175, four sector\'s will be more wealthy than
Core sector. The basic problem - as is often with wealthy societies -
is a sharp fall in fertility, but there is very little Dulinor can do about
that.
The Delago War merely was the fire that burned away the illusion of
strength.
But at least the rest of the Imperium is growing well, including Dulinor\'s
beloved Domain of Illeish (now the fief of a trusted ally, as Dulinor has
enough problems governing the Sylean domain).

Most Imperials are fairly satisfied with their lives, but apprehensive about
all the
political changes.  The young feel as if they are in a time of revolution,
and can\'t think of a better time to be alive.  The older nobility continue
to grumble
about Dulinor, but remain loyal: it could have turned out a lot worse.



_______________________

Most obvious senario to play
Restore the Alkhalikoi dynasty!

 Everyone believes that Emperor Dulinor was vindicated
at the trial on Capitol, but you know better, and want to
get the word out.  The PC\'s will need to somehow contact the
 Alkhahikoi family.  Now nearing the end of their hard financial
times (we\'re talking about a LOT of debt\'s here, with no more
Imperial money to play with) they are finally in the financial
black, and holding on to their last inheritable title, the Marquis
of Usdiki (in Ruie:Gushmerge A6649EF-F): the few other titles
Dulinor allowed them to keep are all Rank titles, and will
dissapear as the current holders die off.  They are fully aware
that they are alive at the pleasure of the Emperor, and will NOT
rebel against him.
      Even so, there is still a deep sympathy for them in noble
circles, and even the public is becoming a little
more sympathetic than usual.  Countess Ciencia
Iphegenia Alkhalikoi, now 42 years old,  is working herself
to death at actually doing the work of governing all three
of her titles (Countess in the Solomani Rim,  Marquis at
Usdiki, and a Baron in Deneb) as Archon Varian Alkhalikoi,
49 years old, is trying to get portions of his uncle\'s memoirs
published, and get the word out on at least part of the real
story of the Delago War (without pissing off Dulinor).
Of the several nobles who respect the Alkhalikoi line, the most
powerful is Archduke Norris Aella Aledon of the Domain of Deneb.
His family and the Alkhalikoi line goes way back to
Emperess Arabellatra: Captain Roland Aledon was one of
Grand Admiral Alabellatra Alkhalikoi\'s officers in the
Civil War (604-622).  Now, however, he will not risk treason
charges to put Ciencia on the throne at this late date.  Most
of the old pro-Strephon fraction agree\'s with his stance.

      Even so, the unexpected could always happen.....

Damn good.  The HHU has \'Prolong\', and anti-aging formula.  She\'s got over
thirty years in the Royal Manticorian Navy and looks barely out of her
teens.  Let\'s see, she\'s a heavy worlder, so jack up the strength and

high brawling skill.  Expert shot with handguns (gunpowder & pulsers (gauss
weapons on steriods, they use grav tech)),  melee weapon, melee weapon
(long blade), and of course tactics, starship pilot, astrogration, etc., etc.

   She\'s the NPC you keep around to annoy the players.

I liked this a lot. A dirty-tricks type political campaign just waiting
in the wings, without the hard-to-take black war infighting (that was
what turned me off the rebellion setting - having just reached the bits
of TW2K where we were getting over THAT war, we have an even worse one
breaking out!)

I\'m not sure that I can see ALL the commons, throughout the whole of the
Imperium, managing to pull together all in the same direction, or even
all at the same time. This I think is Dulinor\'s basic fallacy - he wants
everyone in the Imperium to be the same, ignoring the fact that many
people don\'t WANT to be the same - they\'re happy being equal but
different (this smells like flamebait - too much like South Africa\'s old
\'separate but equal\' argument - but by putting the \'equal\' bit first I
mean to give that prominence)(the order of words does make a difference
- - consider the difference between a democratic socialist and a social
democrat)

I shall have to think about this more. That was just off the top of my
head. Anyway, nice one, Alvin.

  "Arrival Vengeance" may provide a rule-of-thumb here; any ship
carrying sufficient stores and shops can manufacture most needed
parts as they go, and Traveller FTL technology relies on hydrogen
(which is pretty common :> ) so the limits on strategic mobility
are rather more like the Age of Exploration under sail than the
operational constraints of coal-powered warships.

  The real limits (short of scouting to avoid systems w/o fuel
stocks, which seems trivial for a fleet or even a single cruiser
outfitted with carried or separate auxiliaries) are likely less
technological than social - how long are the highly skilled crew
required willing to leave their civilization for, and what risk
of their loss are they and the authorities sending them willing
to incur? Of course, a lost explorer supplies little data...

 Antimatter is the best \'nuclear\' fuel for a nuclear thermal rocket
(fuel heated by passage through a fission, fusion or annihilation
reaction and thrown out the back), because all of the antimatter (and an
equal amount of matter) is converted to energy, as per the Einstein
equation.

So one gram of antimatter yields 1.8 X 10^14 J (annihilation with one
gram of matter) - equal to several thousand tons of TNT!

Robert Forward\'s short essay on antimatter is very instructive (found in
\'Indistinguishable From Magic\', pub. Baen Books).

Currently, it takes about sixty million joules of energy in to get one
joule\'s worth of antimatter out - accelerating protons and slamming them
into a target at a sizeable fraction of c ; only about one percent of
the antiprotons created can be caught in electric and magnetic fields
and confined.

Higher levels of technology (eg. gravitics) may be helpful in increasing
efficiency...

If you can get enough antimatter, then dribble it out into a spray of
liquid hydrogen (unfortunately not a canon Traveller reaction drive).

Monopoles are a different kettle of fish.
It may end up being easier to generate (or find?!) negative energy or
matter, which will aid in the creation of wormholes (time and space
travel, anyone?) than to find those!

Er... I was referring to the theoretical subatomic particle known as a
\'magnetic monopole\'. They are merely a prediction based on quantum theory,
but if they do exist they will be among the most massive particles in
existence.

I seem to recall Larry Niven describing, in _Ringworld_ (or was it
_Ringworld Engineers_?), a disintegration weapon that throws together
positive and negative monopole particles, which annihilate each other.

At this point in time, I am very reluctant to discount any possibility,

Oh yeah, and Lyons Carlton should have a nice letter of introduction from
the Sector Duke\'s aide de camp, who likes the idea as explained to him.

Can I get the full reference to the Mel Brooks movie btw ?

The Bretange class first appeared in the Terran Confederation fleets near the
end of the 4th Interstellar War and were a representative example of the
Classic period Terran Ship of the Line. The class used a wedge hull (though
the use of an airframe was uncommon), utilised the citadel armour concept to
give maximum protection to vital locations and had a comparitively modest
acceleration. The main armarment was a single spinal particle accelerator
(much reduced in power from the Early period designs) backed up by laser and
missile bays with a heavy point defence laser battery. The Bretange were one
of the earliest Terran designs to abandon the 0.5 Td missile in favour of the
larger 1 Td variety. One weakness of the class was the lack of additional
armour over the life support, a feature that was responsible for the tragic
loss of the TCS Texas. The classes other major weakness was its high Infra
Red signature which made it vulnerable to targeting sensors.

There would be only one problem left: If the UPPs are included there is
need for a legend so that the non-UPP-used players (i.e. the new-to-
Traveller-ones) also know what these are for. There was an full-size table
on the Alien Modules which showed every combination, but no text. This
together with the UPP list in DGP style could give a four-page folded
sheet which can be laid into the book. Perhaps there is also place for
some explaining text instead of the table, but I\'m no publisher.

Surely. It was called \'Magna Roma\' there, but the name shows the

There are several features of the Asian economic
crisis that I suspect would look 
interesting if transplanted into a traveller setting:

A) Hyper-expanding economies tank because of poor lending pratices
B) The cost of producing good fall\'s sharply
C) These tiger economies cannot afford anything from
      America, but can sell things to him
      very cheap.
D) America\'s economy contract\'s, as the
      Tiger economies were once good markets.
E) This lead\'s to the interesting situation of
      a high demand of cargo ships.  These
     ships are loaded to the brim at the Tigers,
     and shipped to America, where they
     are unloaded.  Then, they sail *empty*
     to the tigers to be reloaded.
F) Despite incredible demand, the cargo ship 
     lines are *withdrawing* their ships from these
     routes, as they are losing a lot of money
     (they\'ll go bankrupt running ships at effectively
     half capasity.)
G) As part of the previous boom, the Tigers had built
      new airport\'s to handle more capasity.  Now these
     are massive white elephant, which will
     take years to pay off.  More importatly, the new
     airports in Thailand and Hong Kong were
     disasters, with computer chaos, million\'s of
     dollars in perisible good\'s left rotting on the tarmac,
     and cargo scattered every which way. 
     
Let\'s put this in the Traveller universe 
(Regina: Spinward Marches 1110 to be exact)

America =  Efate, A646930-D
The Tigers = 
   Alell, B46789C-A; 
   Uakye, B439598-D; 
   Feri B384879-B ; 
   Regina A788899-C
                     
(Regina is  a special case.  Between 1105 and
1115 it\'s tech level skyrocketed from TL 10 to 13,
due to a very successful economic
deal brokered between Duke Norris [1]
and the Sector-wide corporations.  But
the economic ripple effect\'s of the
deal was largely "channeled" into the pockets
of the Sector corporations and the
coffer\'s of the subsector government, 
rather then felt off-world.  Still, such a surge
culdn\'t be completely suppressed...)

Now, Tech levels don\'t change much 
over the years, so economic surges 
like the U.S. between 1941-2000 don\'t
happen very often.  So instead let\'s assume 
a major immigration wave came into
Efate at around 1070-1100, say one 
million poor but hardworking people 
from the Imperial Core immigrated every year
at that time.

Now these poor but hardworking folk
don\'t stay poor for long, in this rich new land 
of opportunity.  Let\'s also assume that they are
fertile, and have a ton of clean, hardworking kids.

All this put\'s more juice in the economy,
and in the fullness of time, creates an 
economic surge in this subsector, especially 
in the Tigers.  Over time, this surge becomes 
a regional financial bubble, that bursts at 1115.  

As financial chaos hits,  the major cargo lines
start cutting their losses, and the new starports
becomes a disaster zone, the player characters
smell opportunity.  They kept their noses clean 
during the boom, avoiding the fast money
while cleaning up their debt. Now,  what\'s 
the best way that a small little outfit 
can make out like a bandit?

Yeah, I don\'t think that Dulinor will quite know what he\'s unleashed on the
Imperium...the bit about the Emperor being not only the final arbiter of
Imperial Law, but Imperial Culture, as well can turn and bite him hard. 

Dulior want the whole Imperium to be one happy country...what if those dazzled
young people \'Living in the midst of a revolution\' decide to start running
around waving...oh, I don\'t know...maybe little red books of the collected
wisdom of Chairman, errr, _Emperor_ Dulinor?

What happens when they decide they will enforce the Emperors Will by
completing his cultural revolution? And as young idealists, the most obvious
solution is to tear down the corrupt Old Order to build the Glorious New Order.

Revolutions are really, REALLY hard things to contain, once you\'ve started them...

Another problem...his mandate that the high-pop high-tech worlds \'share the
wealth\'. The 90% of Imperial Citizenry living there might resent that the
other 10% \'are getting a free ride\'. OTOH, since it will, in reality, take so
little to bring that 10% up, they may not even notice. "Oh dear, taxes went up
0.002% this year. I guess this year I have to round UP a credit on the 1040..."

     (If I remember correctly, Guatney made a very
      good one that even includes Sylean: is it still 
      available?)
B) And I need a nice world generator for Windows95
     too.  Any favourites?

Thanks,

I picture GravTanks as ground hugging helicopter gunship like vehicles for
the simple reason that if a sensor can see them they will be hit -
guaranteed, 100% certain by a laser. No use in dodging there, you\'ll need
at least say 50 000 km range before any dodging will do you any good
against lasers.

All in all the lethality of lasers vs flyinng things is good I think. More
NOE and ground action which is more enjoyable for the PCs and also keep the
Canon look of ground conflicts more in line.

Aren\'t they (monopoles) inverse square instead of inverse cube as normal
magnets? Also, besides SF authors, are there really any noncrackpot-, not
working at NASA advanced propulsion-physicists that believe in/have

If you are like me and can\'t wait for the new release (titled _Echoes of
Honor_) you can read the first part of the book online at
http://www.baen.com/chapters/echoes_p.htm

As of today, there are fourteen chapters.  They seem to add chapters are
a regular rate.

The hold-up is in calculating a world\'s geosync orbit altitude.  I think
it\'s necessary to include this because it\'s my belief that most
highports will be in geosync orbit.  But calculating geosync orbit
altitude is not easy.

Fortunately, World Builder\'s Handbook gives me what I need to be able to
calculate it.  It requires I know the world\'s UWP size digit, plus its
star\'s type.  From this, a number of calculations to derive such things
as the world\'s density, mass, rotational period can be made, with much
table lookup and a few random numbers, which are ultimately used to get
the world\'s geosync orbit calculation.

I haven\'t added this to the spreadsheet yet, but at least I\'ve satisfied
myself that I can do it.

Is it worth it?  Do you think, like I do, that most highports are at
geosync altitude?  Should I go ahead and do the work of adding this
calculation to the spreadsheet?  Perspiring minds want to know!  :o)

This is a me too kind of reply. I have a HyperCard stack (for the Mac) that
takes an extended UPP (with belts, GGs and stars) and it generates all
orbits, gasgiants, moons, rings for you. It also calculates orbital
periods. THis can be saved into simple text files for printing. I use it to
fill out starsystems for my players so they don\'t think that each
starsystem consists of a planet, maybe a gasgiant and a belt or two (and
this planet consists of a starport and a bar...)

It also calculates the number of die rolls it saved you.
Those interested may drop me a line. If anybody can do a SuperCard
conversion of it then it can be made into a PC app as well but I don\'t have
SuperCard.

A lot. A really, really, really large amount - well past what could be 
considered plausible hard-SF.

>In essence, I suppose I\'m asking: how many kiloJoules you can get out of a
>gram of antimatter?

The amount of energy you get out of a gram of antimatter is just given by
E=mc^2; 1 gram (plus one gram of normal matter) releases (0.002kg)*(3e8m/s)^2=
2e14 joules = 200 billion kiloJoules. This sounds like a lot (OK, it is 
a lot), but rockets are inefficient at energy use - most of the energy in a 
rocket goes into its exhaust. The most efficient way to use antimatter
fuel (in some sense) is a "photon rocket" - all the energy goes into photons
rather than using any of it to heat more solid exhaust. (This is "most      
efficient" in that rather than carrying a resevoir of reaction mass it\'s
more efficient to just carry more antimatter and annihilate the reaction
mass instead.) However, the efficiency of this is terrible. To accelerate a 
1000-ton rocket that can accelarate for about four years at 1 G requires
33000 tons of matter/antimatter fuel. 

>And, if anyone knows: roughly how long might it take to produce that much
>antimatter, if you had, say, a woppin\' huge accellerator powered by a big
>solar array on Mercury?

33000 tons of fuel is 3x10^24 joules of energy. Mercury has a surface area
of about 10^13 square meters and a solar flux of about 10 kW/m^2, so 
at 100% conversion efficiency it would about a year if you covered *all* of
mercuy with solar arrays. However, plasuible conversion efficiencies are
about 0.001 or less, in which case it would take about a thousand years
if you paved mercury. All this to power a 1000-tonne spacecraft, which isn\'t
much of a colony. 

Somewhat more plausible from a hard-SF standpoint is a ship that either 
accelerates with its antimatter fuel for a briefer time (to perhaps 10%
or 20% of the speed of light) and/or accelerates very slowly (0.01 G    
or less), taking a couple of decades to get to Alpha C. 
This has the added advantage of keeping you out of the relativistic regime
for speeds, so you can just use the old-fashioned rocket equation to 
calculate your (really really big) fuel requirements.

>An alternative to antimatter - I seem to recall reading somewhere - would
>be magnetic monopoles.
There\'s no particular reason why monopoles would be more efficient per
gram than antimatter. They\'re also effectively impossible to 
manufacture except at universe-endangering energy levels, and it\'s generally
thought that the largest plausible density for monopoles is one per 
10^30 cubic light years.

According to the data in First Survey, the Sylean Federation consists of

only 19 systems.  About 3% of Core sectors systems.
Then add in the Chanestin Kingdom\'s 25 systems (4%), and 32 from the
Interstellar Confederacy (~6%).  The Sylean Federation is faced with 2
larger rivals.

(I can\'t remember the First Survey date, but that shouldn\'t effect
system
allegiances should it?

But other evidence in the book indicates that the Sylean Federation may
have been much larger.

In -30, the Vilani join (although Miliue 0: Campaign
says "In Year -100, the now _much larger_ Sylean Federation again
officially contacted the Vilani homeworlds." [my emphasis, p. 48]

And the charts in the added 32 pages of Miliue 0: Campagin say that
at Year 0, the Third Imperium has a very large number of integrated
systems:
Antares: 10%: 55 systems
Core: 30%: 170 systems
Dagudashag: 10%: 56 systems
Fornast: 10%: x systems
Gushemege: 10%: 53 systems
Lishun: 10%: 60 systems
Massilia: 5%: 26 systems
Vland: 15%: 80 systems

Total: 500 systems

However, if you look at the maps of these sectors and try to keep all
these
systems together, you quickly see that the Third Imperium depicted,
though
large, is spread very thin and has many choke points or keystone sytems
that link systems in different sectors.  Consider also that these sytems
can
only
be interconnected at Jump-2 connections because Sylea and the other
members of the Sylean Federation are just reaching TL12 at Year 0.

This means at Year 0, there are about 151 systems that are part of the
Sylean Federation that are not designated as such in First Survey.

(All of this assumes that the Milieu 0 is cannonical.)

As Eris suggests, I think cutting back on this large of a Sylean
Federation
is a good idea.  And the Third Imperium\'s TL advantage allows the
difference to be made up by mid to late in the First Century.

As far as Eris\' recommended dates: I\'d push it farther in both
directions.
Say -50 to +50.

I have to disagree about the number of books.
I think 2 would be better (and more marketable).  One that contains all
the
systems, which are interrelated IMHO and would be best in one place.
Another that contains the background information and details.

In this way, the systems book has a market greater than the Milieu
books.
They could work with any Milieu and any Traveller Universe.  Maybe its
just me and my own idiosyncracies, but I would really love to have
pocket
empires, imperial squadrons, trading, and world/system development type
information in one book.  I\'ve been this far from de-binding PE and IS,
punching holes in the pages and reorganizing it all into one binder,
since I

use these two together so often.

Sure this might mean 2 fairly large books, bbut I\'d buy em.
Put hardcovers on them and sell them for US$30-35.

Then I need a T5 book.
A fixed starship design book with enhanced starship combat.
A comprehensive equipment, vehicles and weapons book.
At Close Quarters for personal combat
An aliens book, major and minor

I\'d be very happy.
I\'d be even happier if these books got the fine-toothed errata comb and
non-canonical information inquisition.  ;-)

You want to hear something really funny?

It is a real organization.

Dewey, Cheetham & Howe
5 John F Kennedy Street
Cambridge, Massachusetts
(617) 876-6632

I\'m not sure its actually a law firm, but it is listed in the business
pages
of the Greater Boston phone book.

Maybe off line I\'ll give them a call.

I\'ll help get them all to the post office, as I recently failed my sanity test
and was thus give a Massachusetts Title to my car, enabling me to endanger
pedestrians and other cars at will on the paved-over blind-turn no-right-on-red
lane-optional \'streets\' of Boston.  Or just keep the car in the parking lot
where it is safe.  (and no, I\'m not trying to resurrect the Boston Driving

I\'m really enjoying the discussion here concerning high-tech combat,
infantry, battle-dress or not, grav tanks, etc., etc.  It seems to me
that this is a prime topic for development into a marketable product.  I

think we need a "The Influence of Battledress on Upon History" to pinch
a title from Mahan.  Although the whole topic of Planetary combat is
really what I\'m thinking of.

The Imperial Soldier\'s Manual: A Guide to the Weapons, Equipment and
Tactics of Planetary Combat.

Sections include:
- --The Effective Use of Battledress
- --Cavalry: Grav Tanks and Ground Craft
- --Hostile Environments: or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the
Corrosive Atmosphere.  (Alternatively, Army Men Can\'t Jump on Low-G
Planets If They Want to Survive.
- --The Successful Boarding Party, and How to Defend Against It (A section

for the Imperial Marine).
- --Getting the Drop on your Opponent: How to Survive the Trip from Orbit

The people of the Imperium want Change (as
today\'s politican\'s would insipidly put it).  But
what kind of change?  A clean up of the old nobility?
Secession from the Imperium?  The First Republic?
Is the change desired even political - are they ready for
a universal religion?  An end to the Psionic Suppressions?
A tech level burst - from TL 15 to TL 20 in 30 years?
A full-scale conquest of the Solomani Sphere and the Zhodani
Consulate?  A doubling of the Imperium\'s size?
Imperial Noble rule on the individual systems,
as well as in space?

Emperor Dulinor thinks that he knows what the
People want: economic equality, cultural unity,
and a greater say in the distribution of economic
resources.  He has given the population
a platform from which they can speak, and will
find out EXACTLY what they desire, soon enough.

Dulinor is one of those highly intense, very smart men
who suffer\'s from intellectual tunnel vision.  He knows
what he want\'s, but doesn\'t see the *implications*
of his actions.  He also tend\'s to see his plan\'s work
perfectly in his mind\'s eye, and lack\'s sufficent respect
for both Murphy\'s Law, and the Law of Unintended Consequences.

And that bit in the Edit, about "The Emperor will be the
final arbritrator of what Imperial Standards and
Imperial Culture consist\'s of."  All Dulinor see\'s
is one edge of the two-edged sword, here.  Is he
in for a Big Surprise....

(Did old Archduke Norris smile knowingly when
Dulinor signed the Edit?  It\'s hard to tell from
the holovid...)

Most revolution\'s occur in two phases: the initial changeover
and the Other Side.  We\'ve had the initial changeover...

>Revolutions are really, REALLY hard things to contain, once you\'ve started
them...

Dulinor is going to have his hand\'s full, trying to control the
Imperial Commons.  Right now he thinks that they will do
the obviously right decision, and - after careful debate,
of course - follow *his* vision of what the future should be.

Just wait till Dulinor the Populist and Dulinor the Autocrat
get a good, long look at each other....

Now, 90% of the population lives on high-pop systems, but
the average tech level of these high-pop worlds is 13, I think.
Assume that Dulinor is looking to bring *every system in the
Imperium* up to, say, TL 15.  Now, how is he going to do this?

(And if this is hard, imagine trying to standardize
 all system governments, in an Imperium that is used to
 complete independence at that level.)

The most dangerous time for a government is NOT in
a war, or in the middle of civil unrest.  The most
dangerous time is in the middle of a reformation, when the Old
Order is dying but the New Constitution have not yet jelled...

  In an attempt to waste even more time at work I am trying to code up
an
  Access database to assist in running Pocket Empire campaigns.

  While starting I have found a few ambiguities I need help with.

  My first query is related to the social standing of the ruling
family.  How
  is this determined to start with?

>From the Original Archon\'s UPP.  B is the minimum, so I suggest
rolling1d6 + 10, and ignoring results that are too high.

However, you have pointed out an interesting problem.  The Archon
of a Noble family running a Pocket Empire should have the maximum
Social Standing by definition.  You could view the Social Standing of
an Archon as his "Imperial Social Standing," and their Social Standing
within the Pocket Empire as Maximum, G or whatever,  which might
make sense in the Caraliata family example, but that is less than
elegant.

  As each persons social standing is related to the Archon (or head of
the
  family) minus the number of steps from the Archon, is the brother of
the
  Archon of the same Social standing as the Archons Children?

Yes.  In the real world, the Sibling would likely have a lower Soc than
the
children of the Archon, because the children will inherit and the
sibling
wont.  But PE contemplates family voting for succession.  So, for
bloodline
succession, I suggest:

(View with Fixed Width Font)

Archon Soc X
|______________________________
|                              |
Heir Soc X-1         Heir\'s Siblings Soc X-2

For Siblings of the Archon:


Archon with Heir:

Archon Soc X ----Archon Sibling Soc X-2
|____________________                        |
|                    |                       |
Heir Soc X-1   Siblings Soc X-2    Sibling\'s Children Soc X-3


Archon Without Heir:

Archon Soc X ---- Archon Sibling Soc X-1


This reflects Soc-1 for per generation within the bloodline, basically,
each step
up or down the traditional family tree reduces Soc by 1 (treating all
non-heir
siblings alike).  And it reflects -2 Soc for each step out of the line
of Succession,
(because once the Archon has an heir, the Archon\'s siblings are out of
the line of
succession).  Example, the Uncle of an Archon with an heir would have
the Archon\'s
Soc -2 because he is out of the Succession line.

Think of it as how many people have to die before a particular party can
inherit the
throne.  For the heir, only the Archon must die (1).  For siblings, the
Archon and the
heir (2).   For a child of the sibling of the Archon, the Archon, all
his children,
and the Archon\'s sibling must die (3).


  If my Archon has a SOC of B, his siblings should all be A.
  The Archons children will be A and the children of the Archons
Siblings
  will all be 9.  Is this correct?

Yes.

  Later, when the Archon resigns and his heir (assumed to be the eldest
  child) steps up the ex-Archon has now got a SOC of A, the ex-Archons
  siblings go to a SOC of 9 and their children go to 8.  The new Archons

  siblings stay the same and all descendents of the new Archon increase
by
  one.  Is this example correct?

Yes, though remember in PE, succession is by vote, number of
votesdetermined by rank.

  Putting it all down like this has made it easier to see.

  Any comment would be appreciated.

I think you\'ve got it.

Galactic will make a bitmap of planet.  (IIRC, you\'ve got Galactic).
Just select a system, hit F4, "R" to read the instructions on making a
map,
then F10 to dump the map into a bitmap.  Then convert the bitmap to
whatever format you want.

If there is interest, I\'ve got some time and could whip one up on GIF,

(Such a world hexmap would make a great addition to MM\'s idea for

Turns out I had more energy than I thought.

I\'ve made 2 World Maps in tradtional hex format.
One is generic with just the hexes, a small legend, a line for
UWP data, and then blank lines to write your own notes on.
The other is designed for Pocket Empires use and has, in
addition to the map and the legend, has lines for most of the
data needed.  Namely, the PE version includes: the Economic
Extension: Resources, Labor, Infrastructure, Culture;
The World Character: Progression, Planning, Advancement,
Growth, Militancy, Unity, Tolerance.  And Planetary Economics:
Planetary Demand, Base Gross World Product, Finished Goods
Trade Multiplier, Total Taxation Level, Governmental Budget,
Civilian Expenses, and Military Expenses.

Each map is in a format that will easily print out on a 8.5" x 11"
paper.
Each is available in .GIF, .PDF, and .CDR (Corel Draw) format.
I can resize the GIFs for different screen sizes if desired.

If your interested in a copy (free of course), send me an email directly

stating which formats you want and if GIFs, what pixel size.

FYI:  The Largest format GIF is 37k.  The PDFs are 300k (not sure
exactly
why the great disparity).

I think a better and more objective standard, as well as easier for
the Imperium to enforce, is whether the offense is a crime under
Imperial law, and without reference to Planet B.  After all, Planet B
has very little interest in what happens.  The Imperium has a very
strong one because the alleged criminal fled through Imperium space,
and Planet A is asking the Imperium to use its authority to return the
accused to that planet.

I think that is too much of a loophole for any Imperium to tolerate.It
makes
whatever extraterritorial status Imperial starports have
completely meaningless.

This mirrors the Federal Jurisdiction from Causes of Action "arising
under" Federal Law.  I suggest that is should be expanded to include
crimes that, though not directly intended against the Imperium, have
a potential impact on the Imperium.  The standard would depend on
how low you want the jurisdictional hurdle to be, "any" impact or
"significant" impact.  IMHO, you can bet the Imperium will choose the
former.

Immunity.  Since Nobles are very often sovereigns, under
traditionalprinciples
of Terran law, they would be immune from prosecution in
a member-world court.  I suggested in a post several months ago that
there would likely be an entirely separate court system for Nobles,
because only their superiors would have any authority of them (though
certainly they could consent to other courts volunarily).

For non-Noble Imperial Employees, some form of limited immunity is
certainly appropriate.

Note: the Imperial Military, as the very hand of the Sovereign, would
be immune from prosecution in member-world courts, and there should
be a military court.

Not strictly necessary since Article VIII of the Warrant of
Restoration(Milieu
0, pg. 84), gives the Imperium the authority to do whatever it
wants with regard to member worlds.  (This is the fine print your lawyer

should have read before you signed).

They should be enable to arrest him even if the flyers were not
distributedon
other planets because Gile induced fraud in commerce.  Anything
that may potentially impact interstellar commerce is within the
jurisdiction
of the Imperium.

Well, kidnapping would certainly be illegal in the Imperium and
bytransporting
a kidnapee in interstellar space, the kidnappers would
have committed a crime directly against the Imperium.  So it shouldn\'t
matter where she hides WRT kidnapping.

Due to the supremacy clause of the Warrant of Restoration in Article I
(Milieu 0, p. 83), "No interference with local law or custom is
contemplated,
except where such local law or custom is in conflict with imperial
law.",
all Imperial crimes would essentially be incorporated into the laws of
all member worlds.  Thus, piracy, slavery, etc., cannot be legal on any
member world.  I think the same applies to kidnapping and all other
Imperial crimes.

How could a place with no legal government become a member of
theImperium in
the first place?  My reading of the Warrant of Restoration
says that its not possible.  Article I: "Any world may, through a
recognized
representative, proclaim allegiance to the Imperium, and in so doing,
such
world shall become a member of the Imperium, equal in ststus to all
other
members of Imperium.  Member worlds shall govern themselves as they
see proper, provided that such government does not violate Imperial
laws."

Clearly, it presumes some form of legitimate government.  If there
wasn\'t,
the Imperium does not need to "recognize" any representative and can
take the world for itself.  And the last line essentially requires
member
worlds, of whatever law level, to obey, and impliedly enforce, the laws
of the Imperium.

Well, they can only secure the starport within reason.  Article VII:
"Movement of material and sentients between such territories
[starports]and the
member world shall be controlled by the member world, subject
to Imperial laws governing such movement."

I think it was last summer we were discussing bounty hunting.There is no
reason
bounty hunting should be illegal.  IMHO,
bounty hunters should need an Imperial license and could only
be used to hunt bounties that were legitimate under Imperial
law.  In your example, this would be for Common Law Crimes.
Certainly there are more criminals than the Imperium alone can
afford to go after, and member worlds have a very strong
and legitimate interest in pursuing criminals and prosecuting them
in any court, including Imperial court.  Especially, since an Imperial
judge, after sufficient showings that the defendant can recieve a
fair trial, could choose to _not_ assert Imperial jurisdiction, and
the member world may have its day in its own court.

As I understand it a monopole\'s field strength is an inverse square, just
like charge or gravity. It reaches farther because all natural magnetic
fields are dipoles, north and south pairs, and consequently have an inverse
cube strength. That\'s why magnets stick together like crazy glue, but have
a very weak attraction when you manage to pry them apart.

I imagine monopoles would be very useful for power generation, but don\'t
understand why they would be "easier to calibrate", except maybe at a
distance simply because the field strength would be less. Electrical
dipoles have no unusual calibration requirements I am aware of.

I don\'t believe monopoles would annihilate each other or have any unusual
effects if they touched, unless one was a monopole an the other an
anti-monopole. Touching the poles of regular magnets together don\'t do
anything special except for the usual attraction or repulsion. I imagine
isolated monopoles would have the typical quantum properties that would
make it as likely for them to interact as other subatomic particles.

Again, the similarity to the Imperial Rules of War. The Imperium can
step in and squash a local conflict any time it wants to, but has neither
the resources or the interest in doing so - thus it lets member worlds
have wars, as long as obey the Rules. The Imperial MoJ can (technically)
walk up to any non-noble suspected criminal on any world and cart them
off to jail - do they want to bother? The vague nature of Imperial
Common-Law crimes allows local MoJ agents to place the
jurisdiction line wherever is best for the interests of the Imperium.
Remember, the Imperium is not entirely a nation of laws - it is 
mostly a nation of men.

it would have been up to the local authorities to track him down...
and on a law-level 0 planet, they may have no interest in arresting him.

bytransporting a kidnapee in interstellar space, the kidnappers would
have committed a crime directly against the Imperium.  So it shouldn\'t

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

It will matter quite a bit. If a bounty hunter is carrying her out of her
hotel room while she screams "Help! I\'m being kidnapped!", she\'ll
want the local police to have a policy of rescueing off-worlders who
are in that kind of trouble. And if the Religious Dictatorship is about
to buy line of megafreighters from the world, it\'s government might
be able to pressure the government harboring this fugitive to look
the other way while another blasphemer is brought to justice.

Remember that the Imperium, at least on the frontier, is spread far
and wide when it comes to resources. If all twelve MoJ agents in
this subsector are busy tracking down a 200 kidnappings a week
slaving ring, they may not have time to investigate when a citizen from
one backwater world goes a-missing on another backwater world.
If it suits the Imperium, or is too big to ignore, they clamp down on
it hard.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I would say that a bunch of miners on an otherwise uninhabited rock
could very well be a law level zero population, which would have no
government of it\'s own - and would be considered Imperial territory,
just like a starport or a starship in space. In such a situation, nothing
would necessarily be illegal in the eyes of the fringe-living inhabitants
of the rock (excepting their "Belters Code", "Fringers Code", or
whatever). This would change when an Imperial representative (Patrol
Cruiser, Agent, etc.) was present, say in response to a report of 
something big enough to warrant Imperial interest. Imperial Marines
or MoJ agents (or both) would lay down the Law for as long as deemed
necessary, take whatever steps were necessary, then leave...until
something happened again. Enough happenings, the Miners might
get a government forced on them - in which case many of them might
just hop their Seekers and leave.

IMTU there are plenty of worlds too small, new or disorganized to have
a government the Imperium deals with directly. The Imperium simply
lays claim to these worlds in much the same way it lays claim to the
space between them. "Squatters" (who may have been there for
generations) are often ignored, though they may be deported or simply
outnumbered by a group of Imperial-sanctioned colonists. If there are
six people living on a world, they\'re not going to have a governor
and police force assigned to them - they\'ll be lucky to ever see
an Imperial ship, unless the system has something the Imperium
wants...and in that case, they\'ll probably see their planet 
Eminent Domained away from them anyway.

(Adventure Seed: Pick a planet inhabited by a small group (1000?)
of people who know the planet well and simply want to be left alone.
Add in an Imperial colonization project that didn\'t think the thousand
people already there had enough claim to the planet to bother with,
or one that used legalese to force colonists on the original inhabitants.
These colonists will be Botany Bay style ex-convict transportees,
retired military men getting land in lieue of pension, probably some
researchers and one or two idealist "conquer a new world" types.
Add in a Survey that was performed in the long easy season, that
didn\'t talk to the original inhabitants and made assumptions based
on their low-tech lifestyle. A colony is founded, done on the cheap
due to the plentiful food supplies and balmy weather. 

The original inhabitants fade into the wilderness, and wait for the
Storm Season to come...

Put the PC\'s on either end of this problem. Maybe even have them
a Scout team doing the follow-up survey, when they realize that
the bungling of the pre-colonization survey is going to get thousands
of people killed.)

Unless the offender has some claim on Imperial Immunity (he is

getting grabbed by the evil local Secret Police. Officially he can do
nothing - what happens to this Marine if he hears a desperate cry
for help, grabs the prisoner and drags him across the line?

"Sir! The Citizen was being attacked, and I rendered assistance
as per instructions regarding lending assistance to the citizenry, Sir!
The street was noisy, I did not hear the attackers identify themselves
as Police Inspectors, Sir! Sir, by the time they regained conciousness,
the citizen had fled into the Starport, Sir!"   <g>

I think it was last summer we were discussing bounty hunting.There is 
no reason bounty hunting should be illegal.  IMHO,
bounty hunters should need an Imperial license and could only
be used to hunt bounties that were legitimate under Imperial
law.  In your example, this would be for Common Law Crimes.
Certainly there are more criminals than the Imperium alone can
afford to go after, and member worlds have a very strong
and legitimate interest in pursuing criminals and prosecuting them
in any court, including Imperial court.  Especially, since an Imperial
judge, after sufficient showings that the defendant can recieve a
fair trial, could choose to _not_ assert Imperial jurisdiction, and
the member world may have its day in its own court.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

The "illegal" Bounty Hunters would be those who went after
criminals the Imperium had no interest in - especially those who
an Imperial Judge would *not* send back to the planet of jurisdiction.
Thus these B.H.\'s would have to engage in Kidnapping and perhaps
Slavery (selling a sentient for money?) to collect these illegal bounties.

"Legal" Bounty Hunters might be citizens with the same standing as
freelance Repo Men from the excellent JoTAS article (name and issue
escapes me) - Private Citizens who may detain a criminal and turn
them over to the nearest available Peace Officer. 

Remember, modern-day Bounty Hunters have no police powers.
They go after bail-jumpers: they can only chase these people like they
do because the contract signed by the suspect with the Bail Bondsman
said, "if you jump bail I can send people to come get you who can
do this and this and this". They dress like police special agents and
carry shiny badges so unobservant and timid people will give them the
same leeway we give to real Cops (like answering their questions
and not calling the real Police when we see the B.H.\'s breaking into
someone\'s house). 

I see the Third Imperium having an official stance that Bounty Hunters,
at least as specially licensed and empowered agents, are not necessary,
as the Imperium can take care of it\'s own problems beyond what is
expected of a common citizen. Local Imperial representatives may
have a different opinion, and be willing to turn a blind eye to private
citizens who are properly getting the job done - as long as the rep can
deny everything and keep it all nicely "unofficial".

Considering the multiplicy of incompatible "standards" on current day
Earth, which has only a single machine-building species with a very recent
technology base dominated by a few industries with a large amount of shared
engineering and instantaneous communication able to ship to any customer
cheaply, I would imagine the Imperium, which has none of these features,
would have a standards problem we couldn\'t even begin to imagine.

I don\'t even think it\'s *possible* to have a single standard for anything
in the entire Imperium, no matter how "integrated" the world is. What
single, for example, standard communication system could work equally well
on a TL 5 water world, TL 15 vacuum world, and TL 10 droyne world ruled by
a religious dictatorship? This is ignoring the problem of incompatible
technologies, like electronic vs. photonic vs. mechanical vs. chemical. vs.
gravitic vs. nuclear vs. psionic vs. what-have-you power systems.

Sure, it\'s possible to say everyone uses totally self-contained sealed
power (or whatever) units shipped from a single planet everywhere in the
Imperium, ridiculously over-engineered to work in any environment, but I
wouldn\'t run MTU this way.

First, it\'s unlikely for such an over-engineered device shipped hundreds of
parsecs from a monopoly supplier to be cost effective with locally-produced
technology. I also think most worlds would want to market their own
technology and not be dependant on outside suppliers. Many worlds may not
even *allow* their equipment to be interopable, to protect their interests
or lock out competitors.

Second, I think declaring that all worlds\' equipment is interchangeable
harms the background. Having each world with different standards and
capabilities gives a reason for the Imperium to want them all, and a reason
for players to travel from world to world. Doing this also makes individual
planets seem more distinctive and gives technical-type characters something
to do. Saying you can get a replacement sensor focal array, for example,
off the shelf at any planet removes a lot of dramatic potential from the
game.

IMHO canon supports this. Why would planets be shipping manufactured
equipment back and forth if everyone produced the same stuff? Obviously,
there must be differences between goods produced or there would be no
significant interstellar trade. IMTU, this is one reason why most starship
computer programs are so expensive, they require significant customization.

This doesn\'t have to be a playability problem either. If you want to gloss
over such details just say all the  equipment your players buy has been
produced on one planet. For more detail, just say all (for example)
equipment produced on a single planet is interoperable, but equipment from
different planets requires an Engineering task to be connected. For high
detail you can tell your players they can either buy a complete new
TransStellar jump drive in Glisten, or travel to Regina to get a
replacement Magna Engineering eludium P366783 jump coil modulator. You only
need to use whatever amount of detail is appropriate.

I\'m not saying there won\'t be standards, just that they should be system-
or technology-specific, and that every planet in the 3I won\'t be the same.

actually, Planet B may have any number of reasons for denying
extradition:

1) The fugitive is an influential citizen of Planet B

2) The fugitive is a citizen influential or not, depending on how
citizens are treated there.

3) Planet A does something that Planet B does not approve of. (The US
has been denied extradition of criminals from Canada because the US
jusrisdiction requesting extradition is likely to seek the death
penalty, which canada officially disapproves of.

4) Planet B may try the fugitive under their own laws, and tell planet A
that \'The criminal\'s being appropriately punished, he/she had a fair
trial,  possesion is 9/10ths, and we possess him/her.\' This may often
happen after case 3, above.

5) The fugtive has gained some sort of protected refugee status on
Planet B.

The Imperium had zero interest in the matter save during the time the
fugitive is actually under direct Imperial jurisdiction. If the IMOJ
claims its jurisdiction encompasses the ground of Planet B, that pretty
much nullifies the concept of \'The Imperium rules the space between the
planets.\' and planet B\'s nominal soverignity is pretty severly
compromised.

I suspect that the Imperium maintains an impartial \'Worlds Courts\' where
representatives may go to argue their respective cases in matters such
as these, territorial disputes, etc....I\'m unsure of exactly how much
authority they would have unless all parties are signatory to some sort
of binding agreement to abide by the decisions of the Court.

Why should highports be at geosync altitude? Geosync orbit has a small
advantage for communications satellites, but I imagine a starport could
contact a satellite any time it wanted to. Geosync orbit has no significant
advantage for ships that can maneuver at multiple gees, and may be at an
inconvenient distance for shuttles or planetary craft. I can imagine
planets that have geosync orbit inside the atmosphere, in a ring system, or
with a companion planet that makes geosynch orbit unstable.

I don\'t see any reason why a highport should be at geosync altitude.

Not only a classic plot, but one which I\'d bet has been used by games

in a game setting.  I tormented players in several different games when

There are, as usual, two possibilities;

1). that the highport is in geosynchronous orbit

2). that it is not.

The likelihood is that, some are and some are not.  It depends on the needs
and desires of the individual planet.

You can rationalize the decision to place all highports at the geosynch
orbit, you could rationalize the opposite, and in either case there would
be exceptions.

If the port is *not* at geosynch, where is it?

1. Lagrange point?  That\'s awfully far away, but it is usually outside the
100 diameter limit in the system, therefore a place where ships juming in
can reach quickly.

2. A non-geosynch orbit?  Not a "forced" orbit, but maybe a lower or higher
orbit than geosynch.  Perhaps there is a satellite that needs to be
avoided, or debris or radiation belts around the planet, or satellite
traffic, that prevent use of geosynch, or perhaps there is some other
reason.

3. Some other location?  Why not put the highport in a parallel orbit
around the same star but a bit further out.  Again, this could put the
highport outside the 100 diameter limt, but closer to the planet than the
LaGrange.

Geosynch is a safe bet, I say go for it, and if someone else doesn\'t like
it, they can alter to suit themselves.

Besides, you need the mental excercise!

In the Man-Kzin wars of Larry Niven\'s Known Space, Kzinti war fleets are
constructed at a technology significantly _below_ what the Patriarchy is
capable of. This is because the war fleets are built to the disseminated
standard so that any ship form the core regions can be repaired by any
frontier base when fighting aliens beyond the border and so that each fleet
can swap spares and technicians between units and even between fleets. A
brisk black market exists in illegal modifications to bring line units up
to their potential performance. A captain may loan his admiral the talents
of a exceptionally clever engineer to upgrade the admiral\'s personal
fighter in exchange for extra supplies, the honour of leading an attack, or
a promise of status.

Has anyone every considered the horrendous logistical problems those
sprawling, mixed-tech Imperial fleets must have? Forget standardization
between 11,000 worlds. Mixed standards within the fleets (obvious from the
varying tech levels) would render them effectively impotent in any extended
campaign.

    I agree.   She complains about astrogation, but can pull fast and dirty

I just flicked over to Win95 to check that out.  Interesting.  I was thinking
Gal would automap a planet for me.  It didn\'t.  However, it didn\'t take long to
quick-hack the basic map from a spare UPW.  Then I cleaned up the BMP & added

Honor has a mental block when it comes to mathematics that started
back at the Academy, or before.  I\'ve always wondered if her "problem"
with Lord Pavel had something to do with making her phobia worse,
psychologically.  Anyway, she can do the calculations quickly and
accurately, subconsciously, but blocks when she has to consciously
think about it. 

Of course, *I* don\'t think that smashing the tail of that pinnace was
really mathematics.  I think Honor has a gift for spacial
relationships, she just instinctively *knows*, but has trouble
expressing what she knows in the mathematical terms.  She knew exactly
how to sideswipe that ship with her wedge and not thinking about it
she just ordered the course. 

You need an RPG system that handles gifts and faults to really handle
Honor\'s math phobia.

Again, that\'s her gift for spacial relationships.  She doesn\'t have to
"work it out", her subconscious is connected directly to her
dexterity.

I\'ve still got an openning or 3 in my upcoming PBEM, starting this week 
sometime.  I\'m assuming you are reasonably familiar with Classic Traveller?

Prob is, you\'ll need a hotmail.com or yahoo.com address since AOL has problems 
with my configuration...

Marcus Rowland had an interesting article in Challenge 33 called
_Project_Farstar_. It outlined the history of jump drive research, outlined
the various directions of current research (1100+), and presented three
adventures dealing with prototype drives. It also gave reasons why post
Jump 6 technology wan\'t feasible -- in-game: the navy and megacorps don\'t
want any else to match them in range - out-of-game: post Jump 6 tech would
destroy game balance and wreck Traveller beyond recognition or repair, a
priviledge GDW reserved for itself at the time ;)

Hmm. Let\'s make our exploration fleet a small 
IISS Jump-3 military/exploration fleet, organized 
by a subsector Duke in the Marches.  A large flotilla
of small ships, perhaps 50, with 2 old 20,000 disp 
modified cruisers, scout tenders, 400-ton Donoslev (sp?) 
exploration ships, 200-ton lab ship\'s, a few scout couriers to 
keep some timely communciation links, and a pile of 
standard Type-S scout\'s.  Maybe 1.3 TCr, with .7TCr 
going to the crusers

This is just a "go as far into uncontested space as you
can, scout out these four subsectors for a year each, then
come back home" kind of mission.  In effect, a kind of 
trade/scientific/diplomatic mission - the kind\'s Captain Cook 
would have loved.  

The typical IISS crew is willing to spend only a year\'s journey
past Imperial borders, 3 month\'s on-site, then a year back.

Assume that the average jump cycle for this crew 
is 77% of the time in jump space, 23% of the journey 
time refuelling, repairing, negotiating with the local 
authorities, etc. (Say a week in jumpspace, 
2 days in realspace) That work\'s out to 40 actual jump\'s 
a year, so make it 80 parsec\'s for a jump-2 ship.

This implies most information less important 
than headline news travel\'s at something like
1.5 parsec\'s a week, outside of the Imperium,
(or similar interstellar government) compared
to 4 parsec\'s a week within the Imperium 
(love those x-boat networks!).

For a military expedition (find the problem, kill it, go home),
Jump-4 is the standard.  They also spend less time 
talking to people, have fewer diplomatic hassles, 
and military-grade information and map\'s.  Let\'s
guess that the jump cycle here is 7 days jumpspace,
12 hours realspace = 93% jump, 7% real.  That work\'s 
out to 48 jumps in a year, or 192 parsec\'s out.

(For comparison purposes: a sector is 40
parsec\'s long, 32 parsec\'s wide)

My jump-3 exploration flotilla is composed of lifer 
IISS Scout\'s, say.  [Yes, I know there ain\'t such thing
in the Offical Universe].  As I *would* like to see
at lease some of my ship\'s back again, I\'ll
limit the expedition time to 20 years.  [Yes, this 
is taken from the old  Imperium Romanum Legionairre\'s
sign-up time].  Assume the standard IISS jump
cycle, and we get  400 jumps, or 1200 parsec\'s
at jump-3 for ten years.

Oops!  I forgot to take out the four years time
for exploration.  That gives us 16 years for actual
travel time, or 8 years one-way.  That gives us 320 jumps,
or 960 parsec\'s out.

If my little expedition is lost with all ship\'s... well, guessing that
information outside of the Imperium travel\'s at "jump-1.5", 
it will take at least 12 years for the first rumour\'s to surface in
Imperium space.

And BTW, you can bet these expeditions are going to be all-male!
I\'m sending them to look around, not start a colony!

Now, in the real (ie: three-dimentional :) universe, 
the Imperium would indeed have all these small blobs
of systems and worlds, isolated from the main body
of the Imperium.  However, we just don\'t have
that many isolated Imperial worlds.  Therefore, 
I would think that the Imperium would have to
choose the worlds, rather then have the worlds
choose the Imperium
 
Also, there\'s no way I\'ll tolerate the "Equal in status to
all other members of the Imperium" part.  Sector
capitals are going to get benefits pop-2 vacumn world
ain\'t touching.  And the Imperium would certainly favour
high-pop systems over others.

This is one of the key\'s to understanding the Traveller universe
- - although I doubt the "nation" part.  It\'s more a bizzare federation
of interstellar corportations, high-pop system governments, 
noble families, and the Imperial Navy, united around one man
and a code of Tradition and Honour.
 
(The Imperial Bueaucracy used to be so powerful it could run 
the Imperium by itself as the nobles and the Navy ripped into 
each other - a la the Civil War. Not anymore...)

>Remember that the Imperium, at least on the frontier, is spread far
>and wide when it comes to resources.

Not just there.  Outside of the military, the Imperium is rather
a lightly-funded organization I suspect.  Before the age of the 
incredibly growing nation-state, most of a nation\'s revenue\'s 
went directly to the military.  Here, I bet the major fraction\'s 
of the Imperium - nobility, corporations, high-pop systems - 
all want *less* interference with their lives and their property.  
Many are quite well-armed  (or can get well-armed in a 
short time).  Even without arms, they 
could cause a ton of political or economic damage in 
a short time.  Supressing all of them is quite impossible for 
the Emperor to do.  Thus, I would guess even in Core 
sector the number of MoJ agents is *just* sufficent for 
day-to-day operations.

I don\'t care to even speculate how long that list of missing citizens is
in the Spinward Marches.  If it\'s just a low-social standing citizen,
wandering in a known danger zone, I doubt that they will even 
bother.  Average folks dissapearing on a supposedly safe world
will be dealt with by the local authorities, unless there is a pattern of
dissapearances or there is finally is some time to catch up
with the backlog.

Heh.  I wonder how many Detached Survey scout\'s are really
interested in scouting, rather then filling out the forms and
getting back to their side businesses?

And of course, many nobles have a soft spot for the Maines....

Actually, I suspect that Imperial personnel operating in their
assigned position have certain legal protections that smart
people don\'t trifle with.  Moreover, the local noble judicary
are more likely to believe Imperial personnel than the locals, IMO.

board. Why microfiche? So you can read it, even if the computer
you wrote it on is a rad-blasted pile of scrap and the nearest one
like it is on the far side of Corridor. You don\'t have it, Depot makes
it. You bring a lot of _Shoshone_ class Destroyers into Depot\'s
sector, Depot will probably start churning out spare parts for them
as soon as possible - just to be ready.

Why do you think Navy surplus & salvage is such a
lucrative career?  <g>

I\'ll bet a lot of each FleetRon consists of cargo ships stocked with
spare parts, too.

Still, I\'ll bet if anything would cause standardization it would be
the Imperial Navy. Design specifications arrive at Sector Capital
from Core, saying that all new builds must *minimally* meet
specification such-and-such...if you can\'t meet the spec, you
build other things while your competitor gets the lucrative navy
contract. Wanna bet that, if you build ships, you won\'t bother
changing very much from Navy standards when you use part
of your shipyard for civilian builds? Standardization spreads....

This will also give PC\'s an excuse for getting more out of their
hardware than they are supposed to. An average engineer will
know that the drive is rated at 2G, but a hotshot engineer might
know that Ling Standard machined down some high performance
coils off their 3G parts line to meet the spec on this particular
- - and might be able to kick some extra power out when you need it.

Since I can\'t imagine a Sector Duke undertaking 
a project like this merely to go farther than anyone
else has, you\'ll be travelling a lot slower than this.
You\'ll want to stop at each system for at least
a preliminary survey, get enough data for your
science staff to chew on for the week in jumpspace.
Add extra time for checking out the real anomalies,
such as lost colonies, suspected Ancients sites,
and so on. I\'d up the average stay per system to
at least three days, if not four. And remember you
have to stop at each system as you go in direction
such-and-such, and many such systems will be
one parsec apart. If this happens half the time, 
your average jump is now 1.5 parsecs.
The slightly longer stay times and lower average
jumps will cut your range to between 50 and
60 parsecs (closer to 50).

Unless you are building on the work of a previous
expedition - "Go to the forward base established
ten years ago by Admiral Quochet\'s expedition,
and proceed from there!" - then you could
go with two day stays or less, but stellar
density variations would make you lucky to
get your average jump above 1.7 parsecs,
all those times you have to jump one parsec
to set yourself up to cross a two-parsec gulf.
That\'ll get you out about 70 parsecs in a year.

We\'re assuming here that the "Scout Tender"
you brought along was capable of performing
annual maintenace, or that you can twiddle
the drives on a scout ship so you can do
annual maintenance with blood and sweat
instead of a shipyard (which is the case IMTU).

If you\'re going rapid transit to a forward base,
intending to start a deep penetration survey
from there, I\'d recommend putting all mission
specialists and replacement crew members
in low berths, perhaps rotating awake crews
with reserve crews. A year of staring at the
innards of jump space seven days out of nine
can be a long, long time.

For a military expedition (find the problem, kill it, go home),
Jump-4 is the standard.  They also spend less time 
talking to people, have fewer diplomatic hassles,

guess that the jump cycle here is 7 days jumpspace,
12 hours realspace = 93% jump, 7% real.  That work\'s 
out to 48 jumps in a year, or 192 parsec\'s out.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Twelve hours won\'t allow you enough time for refueling ops.
Also, stellar density again - with Jump-4 it\'s not as much
of a problem, but you\'ll still not get your full Jump-4 every
single time. Though I can imagine that there are carefully
planned optimum Jump-4 routes (and Jump-3, and Jump-5)
between every Depot and major Naval Base in the Imperium.

If you stretch the average stay time to a day, and assume
90% efficiency at getting Jump-4, you\'re down to travelling
162 parsecs from one annual maintenance to another.

Oops!  I forgot to take out the four years time

Based on my more conservative figures from

you\'ll have to allow time for your epic space

Yes, but i still think fixed depots are too inflexible when communications
travel no faster than the enemy forces. (Admiral Zweistein needed these
spares a month ago. Her fleet was here at the time.) Similarly, fleet
trains of cargo ships are limited to already manufactured parts. If the
navy uses a huge number of different designs, you can bet your cargo ships
are carrying the wrong spec replacements.

It seems to me that any major task force assigned to stop an incursion or
to itself pentrate territory will need to travel with a minimum of integral
manufacture and repair capacity. For logistic flexibility i would expect
these resources to be broken down by the major tasks of mining, manufacture
and repair.

Mining ships carry prospecting shuttles and deployable extraction
equipment. These ships are capable of finding, extracting and processing
fuel and materials. (Somewhere out there is the Red Dwarf! ;) )

Factory ships carry a full set of plans for every fleet system and can
manufacture spares or expendable munitions on site using materials gathered
by the mining ships. (These are seen in the Albedo comic series.)

Repair ships can repair minor battle damage and return ships to combat or
fix severely damaged ships to an operational level which permits them to
get to a secure rear area under their own power. (One of these, the
- -Nesting-Slashtooth-Bitch- figures prominently in _The_Surviror_, one of
Donald Kingsbury\'s stories in the Man-Kzin Wars universe.)

These support ships are among the largest units in the fleet, dwarfing
everything except the largest dreadnoughts. They carry huge crews of
technicians which can be raided to replace casualties in combat vessels.
Together they represent a greater manufacturing capability than many
systems they visit. Vulnerable to attack, their screens of lighter combat
vessels represent a reserve for desperate commanders.

	A monopole is more than just a magnet. A magnet has both N and S
poles, and you can\'t separate them. Chop a magnet in two, and you
have two smaller magnets each with a N and a S pole. A monopole is an
isolated magnetic charge, much like an electron is a single
electrical charge.

	So what happens when you bring a N monopole and an S monopole
together? At the very least, their magnetic "charge" cancels out
leaving zero net magnetic field...

	Off the top of my head, I\'d expect highports to be much lower.
Geosync tends to be way out there, causing longer travel times,
signal lag, etc... Commsats, powersats, some metsats, and other
functions requiring continuous coverage of a given location are the
only things I\'d put way out there. I\'d put the highport in a much
lower orbit.

It isn\'t the best way to do things, but at least the enemy has the

than yours, so he could have standardization. I\'ll take the logistics

I think the time to prospect, mine, refine, fabricate and repair
will be longer than the time it would take for a fleet supply
squadron to catch up with you. And there is always the question,
with a badly damaged ship: is it a better decision to fix it in where
it lies in harm\'s way, take it to a safe place, or scuttle it?

While giant mobile repair bases are very space operatic,
I think a Fleet Tender that can carry a crippled ship home
is a better idea. This is because I see two varieties of
repair tender: one that envelopes the crippled ship, and
one that docks with it. If you can envelop it, take it home.
If you dock with it, you\'re probably stuck to it - your
giant repair tender is on the front lines, in harm\'s way,
an investment more important than a battleship and
costing almost as much now vulnerable. Remember
that you aren\'t fixing a crippled ship in hours or days,
you\'re talking weeks - and a wrecked jump drive you
need to go get, you don\'t fix.

I usually build Fleet Tenders that can carry crippled ships
back to repair bases. Ships bigger than the max tonnage
limit for the Fleet Tender are Dreadnaughts, with redundant
systems and the most defenses you can pack into a ship
for the tech level. If the Dreadnaught gets smoked, you\'re
in so much trouble that it won\'t matter that you can\'t
bring it\'s crippled hulk home....

You\'ve still got the problem of whether or not you\'re carrying spares for
the systems the enemy is going to knock out in battle. Particulary as the
\'current\' Imperial Fleet designs i\'ve seen span several tech levels, let
alone several standards!

But you know the details of the system you\'re fighting in, and star systems
are _big_, _empty_ places. Seize a remote rock or comet and mine it. If
combat force levels in system are roughly equal, the enemy won\'t have time
to seek out and harass your support element.
Unless your fleet supply train is jumping into the contested system with
two week-old information (dangerous in hot systems) there is time for your
attached support to make a difference. Particularly as the mining and
processing element can be preparing fuel for the whole fleet while combat
elements spend their time facing the enemy.

I agree with you whole-heartedly. The vast majority of my combat units are
battle-riders. With no jump drives, jump tankage, fuel scoops or purifiers
their volume and surface area are optimized for combat: sensors, weapons
and defence. Jump tenders carry out severe cripples and carry in
replacements. Mobile repair bases are for moderate cripples that fall
between self-repair and yard jobs.

Remember, major bases are a minimum of 2, 4 or even 6 weeks round-trip from
the contested system. That\'s plenty of time to repair units which have been
rendered combat ineffective by specific damage to a few systems.

At this point i think we must agree to disagree, but it would be
fascinating to try a major engagement over an extended area between our two
logistically different fleets.

This implies that a TL 15 archeologist, without special training,
would have difficulty recognizing an old Solomani television set
AS a television set.  At least without tearing it apart for a few days.

And how difficult would it be to get it to actually _work_ again?

In the end, I suspect that the Imperium runs *very loosely*
on Vilani standards till TL 11: after that, it\'s absolute
chaos on the civilian side.  There is only slightly
less pandemonium in Colonial Navies, the Imperial Army,
and the Scout\'s.

When it comes to the Imperial Navy and the Marines,
"What is standard for Domain of Sylea/Core Sector/Capital
is standard for us."

I doubt if even the Navy can affort this.  Maybe cerain Marine
regiment\'s, and high-profile Scout expeditions...

Has anyone every considered the horrendous logistical problems those
sprawling, mixed-tech Imperial fleets must have? Forget standardization
between 11,000 worlds. Mixed standards within the fleets (obvious from the
varying tech levels) would render them effectively impotent in any extended
campaign.

Just WAIT till you take a look at the Imperial Army...

(Cut away to...

Sir Jonathan  Isshiirli, Colonel of the
Imperial Army on Darl So ( a small green moon
orbiting  the Urath\'hs Gas giant [Gegala system:
Khouth:Corridor] ), sigh\'s as 400 knight\'s in
cloth armour ride by, their wooden shields
proudly bearing the Imperial Sunburst...)

ANYWAY\'S, the Imperial Navy ain\'t that bad:
the Colonial fleet\'s are simply a mess, but the
Imperial Navy is standardized at TL 15.
And such a major force would be quite influencial
when it comes to standards.

On the other hand, Imperial Navy standard\'s are just
another carrot to throw into the stew....

On the gripping hand, the very concept of
"standards" is tightly bound with militaries
and governments: the government has both the
money and the force to make Imperial equipment
build to Imperial specifications, regardless of
what the local\'s want to do.

Initially,  they can afford to pay Imperial prices
for their good\'s.  The massive orders they can
place, however, tend\'s to make the magic of mass
production work in their favour, making their item\'s, well,
less expensive then it could be.  ("That\'s an order
of 4 billion TL-10 laser rifles - and I demand
an additional 15% off the base price, or I will
take my order elsewhere!"  Dame Siilaki Ge
to Interstellarms Director Finemore McTavish)
Imperial military manufactor\'s tend to become
dependent on their major - often, sole - customer,
which gives that customer quite a lot of say.

Also, the familiarity that military men have with
Imperial standards will tend to force all
producers to build to that standard.

Gordon,

It might be fascinating - unfortunately, the differences in logistical strategy
aren\'t well addressed by the rule sets I\'m familiar with. If I put the resources
into Depot-based fabrication and warehousing facilities that you put into
mobile mining, fabrication and repair facilities, I\'ll get more and better stuff
by an order of magnitude or two - several jumps away from the front. We
won\'t see my advantage coming from the rules, while your forward repair
craft would exist. The only advantage I\'d get is that I\'d spend the spare
money on more warships, and that isn\'t really the nature or comparable
quantity of the advantage my idea would give me. We\'d have to make
campaign-level decisions to properly illustrate the effects of my logistics
strategy - things like upgrading the level of some of my starports, or
decreasing my in-port repair times. This would reflect more resources
spent on Depot-based logistics.

Nothing personal, but:
I still think your idea of bringing along prospecting, mining, refining
and fabrication units to the war zone is, well, silly. It would take weeks
or months to find the right ores in quantity, and forget just stumbling on
the necessary "special stuff" like Zuchai Crystals. More weeks to set
up refineries and factories and get them working. Don\'t forget to bring
dedicated defenses with you for them, because you *know* I\'d love to 
starve your fleet\'s ships of spares by nailing the industrial base you
brought with you. 

You\'re really talking about setting up a forward base and trying to 
bootstrap it into an industrial system with class B or A facilities - 
all in what you call a "hot system". And by the time your smaller mobile 
forces have struggled in the wilderness to start doing what my Depot has 
been doing since before the war started, the battle has probably moved on.

I redirect my combat resupply chain, you abandon the mines you\'ve
discovered and start getting set up all over again. Or you start a combat
resupply chain from your frontier-quality forward base to where the war
is - you have a poorer cargo chain than I do, and a much lower quality
(and lower quantity) production facility - and since the war has moved,
your forward base might be just as far (albeit in a different direction)
from the battle as my Depot is.

The Gamelords stuff is ok, I guess.  About the only one I use a *LOT* is
Pilot\'s Guide to the Drexilthar Subsector.  <grin>  I\'ve got most of them.
Personally, Startown Liberty and Wanted: Adventurers are of marginal
usefulness.  All in all, they\'re about on a level with the Judges\' Guild as
far as useability in the most part, but a good bit better quality than the JG
stuff.  And kinda nice to have around if you use CT like I do.

BTW, where\'s my turn??????????????

  All of Far Frontiers was published in Traveller Chronicle (R.I.P.). The
rimward half was done by Dale Kemper about the same time the Keith
Brothers were doing adventures in the region. Despite being the current
custodian of the data, I don\'t know who came first...
  My own work covers the coreward half of the sector. I\'ve stated before
that I\'m not entirely happy with it, but it will do...
  I\'ll see if I have an electronic version of the rimward stuff.

  As for The Vanguard Reaches, the only published version is the
Paranoia Press release. This IS the version that Dale Kemper\'s Far Frontiers
assumes is next door.  Chuck Kallenbach (the original author) has since
revised the sector completely, and it no longer fits quite as tightly with
Dale\'s stuff.  Chuck and I talked about this and were working on making
adjustments when Real Life (tm) swallowed both of us.
  The new Vanguard Reaches has been available online in the past, but
Chuck\'s website vanished last year...

 Not that I\'m aware of. The Imperium isn\'t THAT far away, at least in
spirit, as the Trelyn Domain in Vanguard Reaches is strongly pro-Imperial.
I suspect that Fulani\'s trailing edge is lousy with Chuck Kallenbach\'s
Eslyat, a rather xenophobic bunch IIRC.  Aside from this I wouldn\'t expect
any real leakage from "printed" material.

Some of us don\'t *play* GURPS.  Me, for one.

FWIW, and this is *ONLY* IMNSFBHO, SJG isn\'t gonna sell me anything.  There\'s 
too much changeover for me to want to bother to deal with.  And my particular 
fave area of Known Space, Reavers\' Deep, isn\'t gonna be covered by SJG for 
quite some time, if ever.  I think I\'m gonna sit this release out & just keep 
playing with my LLB\'s, my MT, & what little TNE I have laying around.  I\'ve 
waited this long, I can wait awhile longer for T5.

No offense, Loren.  I just can\'t see justifying the expenditure for something 
I\'m gonna have to spend massive amounts of time converting to something I can 
use when I *already* have to spend a lot of time working on making what I have 
now useable where I need it useable.

A monpole is a (theoretical) *fundamental particle. As such it *will*
have an anti-particle with which it will react, producing lots and lots
of energy in the process.

Using monpoles as fuel has the problem that you have to keep them
*seperated* and that means you\'ve got a pair of humongous magnetic
poles on the ship. This screws up all kinds of things.

Just a nit-picking query ... is "antispinward" one of  your  IMTU
terms?  The cannon term for the opposite direction to spinward is
"Trailing".

A question here, related but not specifically.

You mention signal lag, etc.  Is there a chart, or does someone have a 
chart made up that reflects the general comm/signal lag from the 100 
diameter limit to the highport (or the beacon/navsat/downport or 
whatever you use for the starport authority)?  I\'m looking for something 
(even the formula would work and I can make up my own chart) that I can 
use for when the ship precipitates out of jump at a size 4 world, then a 
size 9 world, then a size S world, etc. and the sensors/comm 
suite/transponders squawk their arrival.  

Maybe just a chart with representative distances and signal lag time in 
seconds....

I\'d like to know (or know how to figure) the seconds or minutes it takes 
to "have a conversation" or computer communication with the authorities.  
Thanks...

Signals sent will travel at 300.000.000 m/s = 300.000 km/s, so you\'ll have
a chart somewhat like this

  World                 Ship(100dia)->Highport(10dia)  

  Earth (6383km)               2s
  Jupiter (71492km)           21s
  Mercury (2440km)           0.7s

> The Count,

The formula is 

        distance in km / 300.000 km/s = signal travel time

so for a signal sent to highport at Earth would take 2s and a reply would
take another 2s giving a waiting time of 4s.

Our campaign is open to "drop ins" which, IMHO is an excellent way to
"evaluate" the fit for both (new and existing) players and GM of a
potential new player.

The basic idea is to give the visiting player a character who is usually an
NPC and let them do their thing.  This may or may not be a "party member".
If things look likely the person can either take over the character
permanently or, if they wish, roll their own.

Oh, I\'m in Malden (soon to be Medford).  Contact me via email privately if
you wish to "drop in", either Brad or anyone else here or passing through.

Ask and ye shall receive...It\'s quite simple.  Please excuse my simpleness
in using miles rather than km, It\'s my unit of choice in this instance.

1 light sec = 186k miles

Size    Dist of   One Way Signal
Code    100 Dia    Trav Time
 S       25,000mi   0.14 sec
 0       12,500     0.07
 1      100,000     0.54
 2      200,000     1.08
 3      300,000     1.62
 4      400,000     2.16
 5      500,000     2.69
 6      600,000     3.23
 7      700,000     3.77
 8      800,000     4.31
 9      900,000     4.84
10    1,000,000     5.38
SGG*  2,500,000    13.45
LGG** 6,000,000    32.26

*SGGs are "20 to 60 thousand km diameter" per MT ref\'s manual.  I used the
middle value of 40,000 km or about 25,000 miles
**LGGs are "60 to 120 thousand km diameter" per MT ref\'s manual.  I used
the middle value of 95,000 km or about 60,000 miles

This is one way.  Two way communication doubles this.  So a conversation
with someone 3 seconds away will look like this from the point of view of
the ship;

Ship: "Hey Jack!"
(3 sec for message to travel to planet, planet person say\'s "what")
(3 sec to travel back, ship hears;)
Planet: "Hey what?!?"

Conversations would probably be more like brief, alternating, monologues.
Perhaps email would work better ;)

Note that if the star\'s 100 diameter limit is further from the star than
the mainworld (as occasionally happens with large, cool star types), an
emerging ship will, in all likelihood, be much farther from the mainworld
than a few light seconds.

This calls to my mind the difference between ancient Egypt and
Babylon.  Babylon had the Code of Hammurabi, and the law was
above all people, because their society was so unstable and
their lives were so uncertain to begin with.  Egypt, on the
other hand, had a stable world, with extremely predictable
flood cycles etc.  So their Pharaoh was the absolute authority,
and nobody minded.  Their culture was so stable it got stuck 
in its own conservatism, and they fell behind in some technological
aspects.  Of course, they did flourish for a rather looong time
too... from 3000 BC to 1800 BC for the Old Kingdom, I think.

Thus the 3rd Imperium is a very stable, conservative empire,
where the Emperor is the final word.  Technological advancement is 
very slow but the people are happy.  Psionics are borderline "liberal".

I would assume their longevity is due in part to the Vilani culture,
except for one thing: aren\'t the Vilani supposed to have seeded
the Sumerian culture?  Since the Sumerians are so short-lived,
I guess their method of rule wasn\'t appropriate for the Fertile
Crescent; however, there might also have been a colony in Egypt,
which may explain their stability.  But how about the Vilani script?
If Sumer used cuneiform, then shouldn\'t Vilani be heiroglyphic and
rather calligraphic/wedgelike?

Okay, I should crosspost this to TravLang, eh?

One of many. Never forget the "mystery NPCs" from one of the Early

"Deathworld" books).

I\'d love to see Honor confronted with Miles Vorkosigan (and vice-versa).

Well, as anyone who has read Dante\'s "Inferno" can tell you, while

Just a note, a "photon rocket" is actually *less* efficient than
something using reaction mass for complicated reasons involving
relative velocities and momentum transfer. I\'ve had it explained to me,
but I don\'t remember it well enough to explain it myself.

Also, since *one* year at 1 g (ignoring relativity) produces a velocity
of c, the ship\'s velocity and distance covered are going to be
*dominated* by relativistic effects.

It depends on your definitions of efficiency. Per unit energy, if you have a
choice of using that energy to heat a gram of hydrogen into plasma and put that
out a nozzle, or using the energy to make photons and shining them out the   
back for thrust, it\'s vastly more efficient to use the hydrogen. On the other
hand, if you have a choice between using the hydrogen for plasma and 
instead converting the hydrogen into energy (by carrying half hydrogen and
half antihydrogen), the latter always gets you more delta-V; it\'s 
generally more efficient to burn fuel than throw it away unburned.

(Photon drives have such terribly low accelerations that for most practical
applications the plasma variant is more efficient in terms of getting to a
destination more quickly, but that\'s a more subtle effect.)

But, as has been observed: law and tech levels are different in GURPS. And

A TL issue. The more "reaction mass" you mix with your antimatter the lower
the nozzle temperature which is probably the limiting factor for antimatter
drives. Building an antimatter drive with say the same Isp as a fusion
drive is probably easier so it might just be the thing to do as the fuel
production can be put on the ground.

I find Startown Liberty the most useful product. A ready made supplement
full of ideas adventure seeds etc to give your players during those run of
the mill startown booze blasts each system stop tend to devolve into.
Mountain/Desert environment are good to but WAY too narrow in scope
(basically TL-7 diving/climbing as a sport)

Well, going by the supposition of the expanding Hells, its pretty obvious.  Some
areas of Hell are expanding faster than they are being filled since the death
rates around the world vary.  Thus some hells are endothermic while others are
exothermic.

I\'m not arguing about what PE says, but I have an objection.

Basically I think this methodology leaves too few social standings.

The family of the nobility of the "empires" ruler should be considered
"above" the station of all other folk out to a certain extent.

If the Archon in the previous example is Soc D, then this is not much of a
problem.  I see a problem, though, if any member of "royalty" falls (at
birth) below Soc A in rank.  This would imply they are not royalty, and as
such, commoners of the society may be of equal rank.

Now, at some point (2nd cousin?  3rd?) Ther must be a transition point, but
that means you need three levels of Soc; One for the Ruler him or herself,
one for the immediate royalty (heir, sibling, spouse, non-heir children)
and one for "everyone else" of royal stature or relation.

Just my Cr.0.02

The transponders are a special case. The inconvenience of having to ship
transponders all over the imperium is made up for in a number of ways.

For a start every ship licensed in imperial space would be required to have
one by law and the cost of the transponder would be part of the licensing
cost. This means that even if you have to ship it from Core to the Spinward
Marches (for example) you can still ensure you don\'t make a loss (on
average) by correctly costing licensing. The \'black box\' part of the
transponder would probably be quite small and not weigh much which means the
costs for shipping them would not be too great.

The major benefits are of course those given for the use of the transponders
in the first place.

Yeah, I know.  What page was that on, the Acuso stuff?  That sector is getting taken off, since I started working on Revers\' Deep.

I\'ve got a lot of reviews of CT stuff on my web site. Not everything (far
from it), but a lot of the stuff by GDW, and some of the stuff by FASA.  I
add to it everytime I get something else (which isn\'t as often as I like).
No Gamelords material, though - I don\'t have any (someday, though...). It

Well, there are problems with this. Consider that Venus orbits the same
star as Earth, and in an orbit not that different. Yet it has a "day"
almost the same length as it\'s *year*. 

I think your best bet is to prompt the user for the length of the
planet\'s day, but fill in the "default" value from World Builder\'s
Handbook. That allows creative refs to add in their own info, but only
requires an extra keystroke for folks who don\'t care.

Geosynch is convenient. But don\'t forget to add checks for
"reasonableness". For example, if a planet\'s rotation is slow enough, a
geosynch station is impossible because the station is so far away that
it\'s orbiting the *star*, not the planet. Likewise, with a fast
rotation, it\'ll be too close to be safe.

And a highport gets *really* weird if the "planet" is a satellite of a
gas giant. Stable orbits have to be fairly close in in that situation.

Sounds like a nice supplement. Just be sure to include examples of some
of the *weirder* legal principles that exist or have existed on Terra,
as things that can be encounterted on various worlds (Islamic Law, Code
Napoleon, etc).

On the other hand, it\'s not *that* hard to come up with *legal*
practices that are functionally equivalent in many cases.

For example, slavery may be illegal, but indentured servitude is likely
quite legal. And with a bit of a stretch, I can see a character being
"sold" to someone to work as their unpaid servant until he works off a
debt. (It pays to read the fine print on those contracts *and* to stufy
the local legal system :-). 

Likewise, the difference between pirates and privateers is somewhat
academic to their victims.

Wonderful read! Well written.

IMTU, I stuck with the rebellion. Some PC\'s decided to take matters into
their own hands, and in mid 1117, went to assasinate Lucan. They installed
Dulinor (as Barracks Emperor) by holding the moot hostage, once reconvened.
Basically, it was a case of "Dulinor is here, and the legal emperor. If you
fail to confirm this, He will die... As will all of you. [activates comm
link with orbiting BatRon Commander, loyal to PC] Admiral, the announcement
of the new emperor will  be your signal... if not our choice, kill us all
down here." The PC\'s were from the Marches, and had brought some of the
Corridor fleets with them "In accordance to Lucan\'s \'Imperial Wishes\'".
Lucan was assasinated by tracing a call to him, then MESON and Particle
fire at his location + or - 1 km. Followed by BD troop follow up.

Said players went on to assassinate "The Real Strephon"... they were quite
aghast when Survival Margin came out, revealing the TRS was really TRS!

IMTU, any world exporting goods had better have them to spec. Usually, the
retooling takes around 20-30 years to be complete, but the IMoT will
subsidize retooling to standards.

Computer Standards are less so. There is, IMTU, an "Imperial Virtual
Machine" with a standardized instruction set. All computers for military
use MUST have the IVM as hardware emulation. All computers sold offworld
must have IVM sold with them. All machines must be capable of handling at
least Anglic and Vilani; most also will support binary. All data
transmission formatsmust have a binary header with certain key fields
(including symbology in use); some forms of encryption simply change this.
Basically, the IVM runs using Anglic or Vilani script, and has a dual
language capability.

Agreed.  I was trying to suggest a bloodline succession system similarto PE,
since PE contemplates succession by vote of family members.

And of course, in any pocket empire, the Archon would have maximum
Soc.  I think someone posted previously some allusion to Hans-Rancke\'s
system which uses a much wider range of Soc.  I\'d love to see this if some
one could direct me to it or post it.

Well, I see your point, but at some point, you\'re going to have members inthe
family tree that are so far removed from possible succession that they
are effectively commoners.

I was reading some medieval hisorical fiction concerning Simon de Monfort and
Llewelyn ab Gryffdh, and noticed that the King of England would chose who would

get what Earldom, or other rank, etc., and not necessarily follow the bloodline

strictly.

Its all a bloody mess.  ;-)

I was very glad to see that MM put "Noble Lands" as a mustering out benefit for

the Noble career in T5/4.1, so that I don\'t have to deal with high-Soc-rolling
players
who think they own a planet.

Once upon a time I ran across a list of almost every Traveller product
published.  It was on the Traveller Chronicle site, I think, but
that\'s gone away now.  I do think it would be useful to have that list
(as complete a one as possible) available somewhere.  It would also be
nice if there was a short description for each of the products: 
number of pages, which game it was for, what was it about, if it was
useful or not.  Then there are the articles in all the various

me to thinking.

How much do you have to spend on defending a cargo ship before
a 50tn Strike Fighter can\'t cost-effectively hurt it?

Sure, a 50tn fighter isn\'t going to do more than annoy a dreadnaught...
but how many escorts does it take to keep the 50tn fighter away from
the Fleet Support Squadron? And how many 50tn fighters, firing by
squadron, does it take to blow up a Combat Stores ship?

Sure, we could keep the cargo ships, tankers and such near the battle
line - but that would place them in range of enemy spinal mount fire.
One Destroyer moves to intercept ten fighters, the fighters split off
by twos - Destroyer picks which two to intercept, the other eight
fly around him.

Sounds like you need fighter squadrons of your own as a screen, or
your fleet will soon be all head and no tail.

If nothing else, the presence of patrolling fighter squadrons increases
the threat level of the contested system. Maybe you need to use
higher-G Combat Support vessels, and put defensive armament on
them - increasing the cost. Even if fighters do nothing but make you
spend more on each ton of combat stores you bring with you, they
can be cost effective.

Does this make fightercraft viable fleet assets, or are they still
(as someone here once put it), nothing but "ornaments"?

Personally, I\'d use a small stand-alone fiber-optic computer with an
independant battery backup, as the microfiche is still power-dependant. On
the other hand, I have this image of a Vilani engineer looking up the specs
while cranking the handle to produce the power to run the microfiche lamp ....

A lot of designs are still going to be the good old ones that served the
Ziru Sirkaa for 5000 years. Andrew Atkin\'s 1000t jump-2 TL11 freighter is
an example - built with TL11 credits, it can quite easily maintain economic
viability in a TL15 empire.

Vilani megacorporations are going to have a unified if large set of
standards. Given that the bureaux have been influential in the 3I since
close to Year Zero, I\'d say that even non-Vilani are going to stick with
Vilani standards, because it is the choice between using theirs, or not
selling to Vilani.

The thing that has to be remebered is the Imperium is as much a creation of
interstellar commercial interests as interstellar commercial interests are
the creation of the Imperium. And consistent standards are good for
interstellar commercial interests.

Someone also mentioned the adoption of local standards as a non-tariff
barrier to protect local industry. Somehow, I suspect that this would not
be looked on well by the commercial interests of the Imperium, and these
people have ways of dealing with such recalcitrance by local governments.
The Office of Calendar Compliance is the obvious first authority to alert
to this unfortunate development.

But they are constrained by honour, and honour is something that can trump
self-interest.

Someone who knows how to exploit laws can do a lot of damage - \'Sue, and
appeal till they go bankrupt\' is an excellent strategy for a large company
dealing with a smaller competitor. A single decision maker unconstrained by
actual law can prevent such abuses. Of course, if that decision maker does
not have their eye on justice, but on something else, then very bad things
can happen.

This is part of why the Imperium emphasised Honour so much - you cannot
pass a set of laws for 10 000 worlds, but you can hold Honour up as a
sacred trust.

This is an excellent reasons for fleets to consist of homogenous ships.

This doesnt work with the very long Traveller sensor ranges. A Type S scout
is very cheap, and a dozen of them can scout out a system for anomolies in
days, especially if those anomolies are designed to support 50kton
battlewagons.

Surface area and volume arent as important as they used to be in Traveller
military ships. Mass is far more important with realistic thrust, and
hydrogen fuel for jump drives is not very massy (hydrogen masses 1 t per
dton. Most military systems mass about 20t per dton) and more mass equals
more power demand for more t-plates to maintain the same level of agility.

I suspect the optimal design may actually be a battle rider with an
auxilary jump-1, enabling the ship to do a running jump to the outsystem
when it has to. A warship is also going to fill the capacitors for jump-1
in nothing flat, and this is going to help it when the time comes to cut
and run.

Traveller ships hit by spinal mounts tend to not have their damage limited
to a few systems. If you are substantially damaged, then retreating may
also be a problem.

We\'d need some rules for combat repair first. I suspect that the very long
operational ranges of Traveller warships would make the self-contained
fleet a viable concept.

The other thing to bear in mind is the Battle Rider concept is merely a
modification of the System Defense Boat concept, and important systems tend
to be the hi-tech industrial hi-pop ones, and these tend to have a lot of
SDBs.

Efficiencies of scale for producing expensive goods drives interestellar
trade.

Imagine we are building a widget - the good old TL8 10 MW power plant. A
hundred worlds want a hundred each per year, and they have a sticker cost
of one megacredit, payable in TL8 credits. They take up one dton each as
freight.

Built in batches of 100, they cost the sticker cost. But if built in
batches of 1000, they cost MCr 0.9. Built in batches of 10 000 the
production lines are really rolling, and they cost MCr 0.8.

Now, it will be cheaper to import one from the world that makes them than
build locally if the transport cost is less than KCr 200 in TL8 credits.

Assuming the TL8 credit trades at 0.5 to the Imperial, and shipping is done
at a cost of Cr 800 per parsec, then you can ship them about, oh, 100
parsecs before the cost of shipping overwhelms the efficiencies of scale.

No, but I suspect that a local area will arive on a standard. I also
suspect given the low cost of freight and passenger transport in Traveller,
a local area is going to be quite large (and Traveller passenger costs are
low, once you drop the silly Cr 2000 \'life support\' charge - and a bunk or
shared small stateroom takes up a dton).

Well, you know my opinion Walt :->, but i\'ll repeat it here in public.

A high thrust cruiser or destroyer can cause just as much havoc in a supply
column as a squadron of fighters and has more uses. Ditto for a swarm of
Hoshisame gun sloops or similar. Also, carriers are more vulnerable than
cruisers because they have dedicated volume and surface area to fighters
which aren\'t necessarily around in a fight and aren\'t that effective
against ships of the line anyway.

Present day fighters are 26x to 50x as fast as present day warships. Attack
planes are 12x to 34x as fast. With radar horizons and the like a fighter
can cross a target\'s engagement zone in as little as five minutes.

Traveller fighters operate in a frictionless environment so velocity
differences
are highly dependent on tatics. Versus combat hulls, Traveller fighters
usually don\'t have better than a 2x acceleration advantage. Versus slow
cargo hulls and the like, 6x. And there are no radar horizons in space. It
will be a fight in and a fight out.

The pre-flight naval equivalent of the fighter was the PT boat or torpedo
destroyer. IMHO these are the appropriate "fighter" in Traveller: small,
move manuverable, slighty faster. i.e. Hoshisame gun sloops, SDBs and the
like. Base groups of them at rocks that don\'t rate a cruiser and use them
to harrass the enemy rear.

How long are Traveller sensor ranges? I dug a couple of books out of the
closet when this discussion got going and i was surprised at how _short_
the listed sensor ranges are, especially given that even a large ship can
be a very small target in a star system.

Alvin is referring to the legendary village sometimes called Li Jien (Legion)
in Western China. I have read a novel devoted to this subject, in which a
deranged emperor orders a disgraced Legion to "March East" and it makes it all
the way to China.

Another version has the survivors of Cannae taking service with the Parthians
as mercenaries, and gradually working their way west. 

Another version is detailed in David Drake\'s Ranks of Bronze...(I think).

For those of you who missed our last chat session, shame on you. 

Elvis was briefly sighted on #traveller last week. He stayed only a 
few minutes, contributing his thoughts on Milieu 0, before 
continuing his series of late night appearances at Quickie Marts 
across Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas.

For those of you who weren\'t there, you\'ll never know if this was 
true or not, will you?  For the rest of us, its our little secret. :-)

Anyways, in celebration (such as it is) of a 300 point drop today in 
the Dow Jones Industrial Average, this week\'s topic will be:

"Finance in the Third Imperium"

The emphasis will be on extrapolating from Traveller\'s background 
as well as its Trade and Commerce rules to try to create the basis 
for further adventures in the Third Imperium of an economic nature.

Really, it won\'t be as dreary as it sounds.  Trust me (he says,

It depends on the system you are using. The newer -- and I\'m told, more
realistic -- versions (including the legendary Definitive Sensor Rules) make
ships easy to see a long way out.

More recent (and I\'m told, more realistic) versions of Traveller make it
pretty easy to see ships waaayyy out. One to look at on the \'Net -- Bruce

 Yeah, *MY* kind of Imperium!

Now, many depot systems may have low populations, or even low tech - 
but that\'s just the "permament residents".  Base personnel &

And of course, the Vilani discovered the supremacy
of microfiche over all other forms of long-term
data storage long ago. 

( if information density and decent  lifespan is your goal: if 
long-term data survival & integrity is what you want, 
embossing the information on diamond slabs
might be perferrable.  Widely used for holy religious work\'s
and geneological tree\'s for nobles - anything where cost is
irrevelant, and information survival paramount.

Cutaway to...

   The escorted visitor enter\'s Liinirganu Citiadel, the traditional
   stronghold of the famed Liinirganu house of Aramis subsector.
   Her hair and clothes carefully tailored to meet Vilani stadards 
   which were ancient when the Pharaoh\'s ruled, she glided down
   the pulsing, swirling corridor to meet her betrothed for 
   Gurirugudegammaduu, the traditional third meeting before 
   the actual marriage ceremony.

   As she strode toward\'s the veiled archway, the fractal pattern 
   began to hum on a subvocal level, shaping themselves into
   recognizable forms.  Women giving birth to children, small
   ship\'s landing on virgin worlds, a very old man kneeling before
   a Flag Emperor, a citydome growing like a flower under 
   a poisonous sky.  

   The woman part\'s the veil.  A round room, 20 meter\'s in diameter,
   covered with sunlight.  Yes, *sunlight*, as warm and rich as if she
   was standing under Vilani\'s sun, over 250 light years away. To
   her left and her right stand\'s a heartbreakingly beautiful
   tower\'s of pure diamond, sparkling with the gilded names of the
   ancestors, framed by Diswark veined marble.  Her escort whisper\'s 
   her to stand still,  and 10 people, 5 men and 5 women, entered 
   the room wearing House robes. 

Heh.  The sheer cost of these diamond slabs and the expensive, beautiful 
artwork that tends to be added to them must be astonishing.)

Walter Smith, have you ever considered a career with the AAB?

For my little expedition, I want to eat the daisies once

Truth.

However, 1) all government\'s are self-limited
and 2) all government\'s have a tendency to
strain at those limits.  This is true even of
legalistic theocracies, when the priesthood start\'s
to reinterpret the Law to suit themselves.

The point isn\'t the Rule of Law - the Law 
is only a protection as long as the ruler\'s
have the integrity to interpret the Law
as intended.  If the ruler\'s and the citizen\'s
have a basic integrity not to trample on justice, then
the written Law is not necessary: a more flexible,
organic Tradition is the best tool for organizing
societies.  

Give me a society of noble, honourable people,
and the Law merely get\'s in the way, a rigid and 
very clumsy tool to rule 11,000 worlds (unlike,
say, Tradition).  Give me a ruling class 
of corrupt, devious liar\'s, and all the Law\'s and 
all the Court\'s will not help you.

I believe that Andre\' Norton did a novel, (Star Ranger?) that was based on a
version of this. In the novel, supposedly following the historical pattern,
a Sub-sector governor, in an effort to rid himself of the pesky remainder of
the Imperial military, ordered them to extend the Imperial map. They may
have been looking for lost colonies. At any rate the loyal officers boarded
their ships and set off, traveling ever further until their ships simply
wore out!
There was more to the story, but it\'s been years since I read it last. If I
ever get the rest of my books unpacked I\'ll have to look it up now. It may
have some scenario ideas, most of her juvinile slanted books seem to have a

*******

From the article "SelimCorp Skirt\'s the Edge", from
_StarTrader Monthly Datazine_,  90-1114

"Some sagas never end.  Take SelimCorp, LIC.  The little 
Regina company od dubious parantage, a checkered and
litigation-strewn past, but with apparently perpetual supply of
big plans, a "revolutionary" low-temperature artigrav cell,
high-prices industrial additives, even lanthium - recently
persuaded both the Regina (subsector) and the
Sector-wide corporate court\'s to give it a new lease on life.
In so doing, it overcame the objections of the Imperial Securities
and Exchange Commission (ISEC), which less than 20 day\'s
earlier filed Domain securities-fraud charges against the company 
and it\'s noble backer, Sir Mustapha Selim.

<snip>

Between mid-1111 and early 1112, their shares rose spectacularily
in the Spinward Marches Bourse (SMB), from 5 Cr. to a high of 
38 Cr. , but it\'s bubble burst in mid-1112 after the Kirga Network
[an association of top financial news agencies, equivelant to the
Wall Street Journal] reported that the Ministry of Justice: Securities
Department was looking into the possible involvement of two convicted 
stock swindlers in the stock\'s ascent, and the suspicious nature
of the company\'s funding.... 

Sir Mustapha Selim is apparently still under investigation 
by Regina system\'s Serious Fraud Office...."

*******

Sir Mustapha is a long, lean man in his fifties, looking
every inch of the truly regal noble.  He is the main driving
force of SelimCorp, spending his time raising new capital
from interested corporations and wealthy families.
His wife, Dame Feura Selim, actually handles
day-to-day operations.  A small, hard, round woman
in her forties, she married Mustapha as a step up in 
respectability, but work\'s 14-hour trying to make end\'s meet
and pay off debt\'s so Selim can chase his dreams.
For now, she refuses to have children.

Through fast talk, wideranging travel and a few
lucky moves, Selim Family has managed to build up 
SelimCorp, LIC as a truly wide-ranging business, with 
some small operation or threadbare office in every 
sector of the Imperium.  SelimCorp
continually petitions to be considered a MegaCorp 
(it can be found in every Sector, after all) and is 
regularily laughed off or ignored.  Regardless, 
Sir Selim is determined to get to "get the respect 
he deserves" , and is alway\'s looking
for the Big Break....

In addition to his network of tiny offices - run out of back alley\'s
and post boxes across the Imperium - he also has 16 
small traders, a scout ship, and a "Family Holding" 
of a small fish farm, a two-acre fief, and a 2 MCr  
GravCarrier that serves as his home.  Besides
the employees of SelimCorp, Sir Mustapha has 
two liege-servants that will serve his family
till death, but the servant\'s children have already decided
that they aren\'t interested in following their father\'s
footstep\'s.

I think they were scouts but I can\'t remember exactly why they
were sent out.  Their ship crashed on a planet that they later
found out was the home world (Terra, that is) and all the known
human races left for the stars from there.  I vaguely recall something
about the alien races not being accepted in the new order but
don\'t remember for sure.

If someone does develop a senario from this I would be interested
in seeing it.  :-)

Why is kidnapping considered an Imperial crime? Is it important for the
wellbeing of the Imperium? I\'d say piracy, slavery, pseudobio posing as a
sophont, rules of war,a shitload of crimes vs nobles are the only Imperial
laws that hold on the planets themselves. Piracy btw is probably not
covered as only piracy in space should be worthy of Imperial interest. If a
planet (Wurzburg/Glisten) allows piracy on the planet I don\'t think the
Imperium would bother.

Gordon, you seem not to have seen the wonderfull FF&S designs with fighters
up to 18 G\'s. If the increased compensator capability rules made it to
FF&S2, it would be feasable, at TL15, to have compensatiopn on the order of
10 or 15 g\'s, plus the 6 of comfort for the pilot. While T-Plates may only
have 6G, HEPlaR and similar can easily generate short bursts of 18 or 20
G... well within the 6 percieved G limit for comfortable operation.  If you
add this to a T-Plate (Wasn\'t explicitly outlawed under FF&S 1), you can
get a cruising thrust of 4-6 G, plus boosters for combat giving you well
beyond that.

Such fighters can, and will, be capable of outmaneuvering, and changing
aspect qwuickly against, capitol ships. More along the lines of PT boats
than aircraft, but still 2-4x faster than capitol ships.

And, while there are no radar horizons, there is diminishing signature. And
there are HARMS... so active sensors could mean death of the sensor.
Bistatic systems would still have passive capabilities, but mono-static
systems eating HARMS can reduce a fleet to the "Mk. 1 Eyeball" [with a nod
to Phil and Ed for the term, borrowed from Space Opera]. There is much more
to a battlefield than just sensors and weapons and speed; the interlocking
nature of defense and countermeasure, for example, means most often your
ship will not be optimized to defend against your enemie\'s current
offensive tactical regime. And Vice Versa.

As to fighters, the best measure is that (under FF&S) you can build
fighters that, while they will be killed by a single hit, may not get hit
as often as the victim would like, and carry more firepower per Td than
comparable line vessels, and when hit will be overkilled... the reduction
in crew space vs weapons space is a benefit, especially for near-world
defenses. Carriers, if built right, still have considerable offensive
potential; the fighters should be tube launched, rather than external; the
surface area useage of the carrier should be commensureate with that of a
cruiser. By launching fighters prior to engagement, with the ability to
open/close ranges rapidly , allows probing the enemy fleet (albeit at
potentially great losses). The use of fighters also effectively multiplies
the surface area of the carrier for purtposes of area devoted to weapons.

Loading a first strike with HARMS (or equivalent) allows the first strike
to be a discardable wave; if sufficient target units lose sensors, commit
to battle. If too many sensor systems are still active, send another
long-range barrage of missile fire. Det lasers with HARM targeting can be
viscious. Expensive, but well worth it.

And yes, a Cruiser may be more useful for non-combat uses than a carrier
plus fighter group. However, the tactical differences are quite striking in
play (BL, especially, where ramparts really can take down big ships). But a
cruiser is an all or nothing combat commitment; a carrier might not be.

    'body' => 'Peter Newman and I were discussing Jumpspace, vector retention during jump,
and how to get around the frames of reference physics problem, and how to
eliminate the retention of system vectors.

Commentary desired. Most of the idea is Peter\'s, I just worded part of it.

1) Jumpspace And Frames of Reference
	Your real-space vector is maintained while juping. This occurs
because jumpspace cuts you out of the frame of reference of the local star
system, but maintains your vector as an inertial vector relative to the
frame of reference of the jump bubble. At jump exit, you are pasted into
the frame of reference of the target system, inertia intact. This vector
should be measured as a vector based upon comparison to the line between
the two most significant gravity sources in the frame at current. So, if
you course is 500mps along a course parallel to the two most significant
sources, your course and vector will, upon exit, be  500mps parallel to the
line between the two most significant gravity sources at destination.
	EG: Leaving Terra/Sol. At 100 diameters from Terra, the two most
significant forces are Terra and Luna. So, if you are on a course 45
degrees clockwise off the line from Terra (most significant) to Luna
(Second Most Significant). When you jump to the neighboring system
Prometheus, which has a mainworld with no moons, the refence line is from
the planet to the star. So, your exit vector is 45 degrees clockwise from
the line from Prometheus to its primary, Proxima. You could set your
jump-out point so that this course will aim you at prometheus, or away from
prometheus, or any angle relative to prometheus; your vector, however,
Relative to the line Prometheus->Proxima, will be 500 mps relative  to
prometheus, on a direction 45 degrees clockwise from that line.

2) More frame tightening?
	I have used that jump entry end exit points are also in a position
relative to the most significant body, on a distance and heading from that
body identical at jump exit to the heading on jump entry, again relative to
the heading to the next most significant body.

	EG: situation same as above. Position at jump exit is 1,281,000 km
out on radial 60 degrees from Terra -> Luna line, you will exit jump on a
line of 60 degrees from the line Prometheus -> Proxima, at 1.281E6 km out,
with a heading of45 degrees relative to the line Prometheus -> Proixma, at
500 mps.

	Problem: This makes the "Bingo Jump" of TNE impossible.... If you
have a vector away from the origin world, you will have a vector away from
the destination world. Does encourage the minimization of vector prior to
jump, however.

3) Jump entry and exit versus time of jump
	Peter and I figure that jump exit points MUST be calculated to a
frame of reference centered upon the target world (or star, or other
massive body). This prevents the problem of targeting a world in a frame
centered upon the universe as a whole, where one\'s exit point needs to vary
over the + or - 17 hours from the normal 168 hours of jump. I figure that
the reference should be based upon the relationship of the most significant
gravity well of the target point, and probably, in order to give a
directional aspect, also relative to the second most significant gravity
well overlapping the point of jump.

So is that where the idea came from for the country  of  Regiment

Actually, there are such things as "solar powered" microfiche readers.
They were popular with the survivalist community in the 70s. All you
need is a reasonably sunny day (uses mirrors and lenses).

If you are at a reasonable distance from a star you can do it that way.
Or you can get a nice *bright* light source by having a oxy-hydrogen
flame playing on a piece of limestone (that\'s how those monster
spotlights they have at movie premieres and various "grand openings"
work. The amount of oxygen and hydrogen required to power a light for a
reader is pretty darn miniscule. 

Y\'know, give the large amounts of hydrogen on most ships, and the ned
for oxygen for life-support, oxy-hydrogen powered "limelights" might
make a better backup light source than battery powered lights!

Among other things, they have the advantage of *not creating electrical
or magnetic fields that could interfere with unshielded circuitry being
repaired, and as long as you have protective covers over any ports,
there\'d be no indication from the outside that the ship wasn\'t a dead
hulk (except for the IR output, but there are lots of reasons why the
ship could stay hot for long periods after being knocked out.

Those ranges are from *before* T4, where we got some real world data
from one of our resident astronomers about what *current* sensors can
do. (They work so well that it\'s doubtful that therte\'s much room left
for improvement!)

Light (and radio, etc) travels at 299,792.458 km/sec. 

So for "one way" travel, you simply divide the distance in km by 300,000
to get the time in seconds for things like passive sensors noticing
that a ship has emerged from jump. 

For things like active sensors, or conversations, you divide by 150,000.
(or you double the time you got in the previous step). 

For example, if a ship emerges at 450,000 km then it\'ll take 1.5
seconds for the gravity pulse from the emergence to reach the planet.
It\'ll also take 1.5 seconds for a radar pulse from the planet to reach
the ship and *another* 1.5 secoinds for the echo to return, for a total
of 3 seconds (but if the radar has been sending out regular pulses, you
may get lucky and get a return from a pulse that was sent out 1.5
seconds *before* the ship emerged and got to the ship\'s position just
in time to bounce off it). 

But when they contact traffic control, it\'d take 1.5 seconds for their
message to get to traffic control. And assuming traffic control replies
*immediately*, it\'ll take another 1.5 seconds for the replie to get to
them, meaning that they\'ll hear the reply 3 seconds after asking the
question. 

As I recall, the "size code" is a the radius of the planet, in km.
Therefore:

 9	1,800,000 km	6.004 sec	12.008 sec
10	2,000,000 km	6.671 sec	13.343 sec

As you can see, it doesn\'t make a lot of difference. :-)

And as you can imagine, once the lag time gets up around 15-30 seconds,
you pretty much give up on holding conversations. You just dump data at
them and when their reply arrives, you fill in any details you\'d
overlooked.

*My* eventual goal is to be able to display the entire galaxy with some
sort of overlay, and as you move the cursor around, an info box on the
side of the screen gives you the info about that region. Click on it
and if there\'s finer detailed info, you\'d drop down to that level. Drop
down another level or so and the screen would be displaying sectors,
still with the "info box" off to the side. Click on them and you drop
to sector maps divided into hexex, click again and you\'ve got an entire
hex on the screen and can select planets etc for more info. 

And so on until you hit the floor plan for the bar the characters are
in. :-)

Norton\'s SF (as opposed to her fantasy) has lots of good ideas for
Traveller. Matter of fact, if I had the money and experience, I\'d try
to get her to agree to a "sourcebook" for SF RPGs based on her books.
Heck, do another on Witchworld and the like for the Fantasy buffs.

Loren? Any chance SJ Games would be interested in doing a Norton
"sourcebook" for Gurps? I\'d *love* to have the "official" word on her
alien races, organizations like the Patrol, Free Traders and the Guild.
Ditto for the various Forerunner artifacts. And all the neat planets
she came up with. 

The Dipple would be a great place to have characters start out from. :-)

"Rangers" which seems to be somewhere between her "First-In Scouts" and
Traveller Marines.

Bemmies (from BEM or "bug-eyed monster") were definitely second class
citizens. Something the Patrol didn\'t think much of.

Well, it wouldn\'t fit the standard Traveller universe at all, given the
base idea of Terra being long lost and half-forgotten, but there are
other possibilities.

Actually, diamond substrates aren\'t all that expensive to produce
*now*. And there are persistent rumors that there\'s *some* way to
"dope" diamond so as to make useful semiconductors from it. 

In which case "scrap" diamond from the semiconductor industry would be
*cheap*. And in *any* case, within a few TLs of *now* synthetic diamond
in any reasonable size chunk or slab will be cheap.

Three forms appear in \'The Best of JTAS\' but not *in* any early issues.
Presumably they were on the mailing covers.  Does anyone know which issues
they appeared with?

The forms were:

IS Form 8
The standard Traveller world map flattened dodecahedron.

TAS Form 2
The  character  sheet  with  room  for  Personal  data and history, service
  history and psionic ability details and notes.

TAS Form 6
The standard subsector blank hex grid.


Any  info  gratefully  appreciated.  E-mail me off list if you\'d rather and

Check out the colonial  economic  model  in  TNE\'s  World  Tamers
Handbook.  The section on agriculture has tables and  rules  that
say how much land, raw materials (pesticides, etc), capital goods
(tractors and stuff), a farm worker needs at each TL ... and  the
output.  It also covers the  quality V quantity  of  agricultural
output and non-food agricultural output (eg. textiles).

This is exactly what my goal is too.  It\'s very similar to a project I 
worked on using the images and maps used by the gov\'t (can\'t remember 
the agency right now) to show the "region", then be able to change scale 
to zoom in, to eventually be looking at individually identified 
buildings....  And we could overlay the units that were there, and the 
logistical infrastructure of the area, complete with load-bearing and 
size limits, with through-put capability.  

Now if I could figure out how to get paid to work on stuff like that for 
fun work that would be great...

>How much do you have to spend on defending a cargo ship before

The first strategy is to allocate 10% of ship volume to surplus jump fuel,
allowing a rapid jump away from the fighter.

The second strategy is to have a number of grapples for fighters, and have
your fighters and their fighters duke it out at some distance from the convoy.

The third strategy is to arm each cargo ship with armament appropriate to
it\'s normal-space power surplus (cargo ships need a power output equal to
25 MW per 100t per jump number. High-jump low-gee ships tend to have a
lower power demand than this in normal space than this, which means you
only need to allocate space and mass to weapons, not to the power systems
to power these weapons), and put them in convoy. Ten 1000 dton cargo ships,
each with three sandcasters, three missile racks and a 250 MJ laser are
probably going to be able to deal with ten fighters, and the armament will
cost less than the fighters. Especially if the auxilaries are armed with
det-nuke warhead missiles, rather than civilian combustion-laser warhead
missiles. Fighters tend to be weak on anti-missile defenses.

The fourth strategy involves a dedicated escort bigger than n fighters can
handle. 50 dton fighters are not likely to have mil-spec nuke dampers or
mil-spec PAWs. A 50t fighter is unlikely to survive a single hit from a
16x2m PAW, and if the escort has thicker armour than a TL-max laser can
penetrate, then it is likely to be able to eventually disable a large
number of fighters before it runs out of it\'s multiple-redundant sensors or
surface-mounted radiators. The fighters, being small, are unlikely to have
thick armour, due to their poor surface area:volume ratio.

In essence all that fighters will achieve IMO is forcing the defenders to
adopt convoy, and probably be escorted by a couple of obsolete frigates.

Mind you, just forcing them to adopt convoy will be a signifigant
advantage, in that it reduces the effective amount of hauling capacity the
other side has available.

I\'ve been doing some thinking about the venerable Pelvic-Mounted Plasman
Pistol (1).

As a sidearm, it\'s fairly useless, having such a high recoil and all.

On the other hand, if you put it into a missile and add a target-seeker
guidance system (Cr 1000), then you have a fairly decent clam cracker.

Add in five kilos of grav plates (0.25 kN at TL10) and a kilo of batteries
to power them, and you have a weapon that should not only go like the
clappers but also do very bad things to BD equipped troops.

Total unit cost appears to be about KCr 4, total mass about ummm 10 kilos.
Range is goanna be pretty long, especially on \'cruise\' mode, but I havent
done the precise numbers.

I suggest that you sit down and actually *calculate* the forces
generated on the ship by Terra, Luna, and Sol. If I recall correctly,
*Sol* will be the second strongest, if not the strongest (hint, the sun
exerts more "pull" on Luna than the Earth does!)

Also, I dislike this because it screws with too many conservation laws.

I think it\'s much simpler to just go with the idea that you were
travelling with a given speed in a direction (say 45 degrees clockwise
from coreward) relative to the planet you left. Add in the velocity
vectorts for the planet relative to the star and the star relative to
the galaxy. Plus the vectors for the destination star & planet. 

The result is your vector on exit, with respect to the target planet. 

It may *seem* more difficult, but it isn\'t. Not when you consider the
calculations you\'d have to do to determine which the two strongest
sources were at departure and arrival. 

The vector addition is done rather easily with rulers, protractor and
paper. No *math* involved (except perhaps deciding how many inches or
cm each vector should be).

Ummm, I wouldnt want my pilots to be pulling 6 gees for more than 10
seconds or so. Definitly not maneuvering at 6 gees over the compensators
for tens of minutes on end, which you tend to have to do to try and avoid
laser fire.

T-plates are no longer limited to 6 gees of thrust. It\'s compensators that
form your effective limit to maneuverability.

As far as I can tell, stacking forms of maneuver drive is not only legal,
but encouraged.

And completely unable to harm anything with halfway decent armour, as
fighters do not have enough length to mount effective particle accelerators
or meson weapons.

Thus, they are limited to lasers and missiles. Lasers are limited in
megajoulage to TL*50, leading to warships with armour thick enough to shrug
this off, and missiles. Missiles are not particularily effective against
warships - nuke dampers, sandcasters, point defense lasers and
counter-missiles all give them fits.

Fighters also make poor missile platforms as they dont have enough volume
for reloads, and each fighter has to have a computer, t-plates, sensors
etc, which makes them not cost effective compared to standard warships.

>And, while there are no radar horizons, there is diminishing signature. And

Nope. Active sensors are too short range to use effectivly. Most everything
in serious combat will use passive sensors.

ARMs are a targetting method. They have all the same problems with point
and area defense that standard missiles do.

Yes, but they cant deliver that firepower in large enough lumps to hurt
real warships. The alpha strike of a fighter sucks. Given their poor
surface area:volume ratio, their armour will also tend to be thin.

In my opinion, you are better off using that volume for more interior fuel
tankage, allowing quick getaways in combat. The other alternatives are big
reload bays for your own missile racks, and extra staterooms for more crew
to replace the inevitable combat losses. Oh yeah, and more parallel-mount
PAWs (they take up very little actual surface area - you can get around the
power curve issue by using batteries and careful power management).

Incidentally, fighters (not tending to mount nuke dampers) are quite
vulnerable to missiles.

Jump-capable cruisers can also run a lot better than a fighter squadron
can, especially if it is only trying a jump-1.

The thing that made the \'fighter\' concept work in the real world is the
torpedo and it\'s more modern cousin the missile - a weapon which, although
carried by a small craft can kill a bigger craft. In Traveller, there is no
torpedo.

So use them against non-combatant craft - force the enemy to spend

Very little in Traveller can hurt a "real warship", except for another
real warship. Traveller naval rules, unfortunately, allow you to field
fleets that are 100% "real warships" - ignoring the necessary, and
vulnerable fleet support assets.

Another thing that doesn\'t exist in Traveller are rules for what happens
to your fleet when you lose your Cargo, Transport, Repair, Medical,
Tanker, Intelligence, and other non-combatant assets. These
Fleet Support units really don\'t exist in Traveller rules, except as
targets in "attack the convoy" type scenarios.

While some PT boat captains dreamed of sinking a battleship, they
knew their job was to sink transports. Make the enemy pay - in blood
and losses, or tied-up fleet assets - for every round of ammo, 
replacement crewman, or liter of fuel carried to the combat zone. 

One thing on cost of threat vs. cost of countermeasure:
It costs less to mount defensive weapons on a cargo ship than it
does to buy enough fighters to overcome those defensive weapons.
But remember that you have to arm all your cargo ships, or hope that
I only attack the armed ones. And my fighters can tell a friendly
Destroyer which cargo ship is the armed one, while they break off
to hit easier prey.

An excellent point.  Your weapons platform (fighter) no longer can be 
out of effective range of the defender\'s weapons system and deliver the 
massive killing blow that a nuke tipped torp would at our current TL.

Moving on to fleet combat in general, I haven\'t played the board games 
of combat, nor really have I tried to "do" combat.  But as I read about 
it, it seems as though it takes a long time to fight a battle.  Does it?  
Days?  I wouldn\'t think so.  

I can see a kind of running engagement, one that lasts weeks, but that 
would be as new fleets jump in.  Let\'s see.  The enemy fleet jumps in 
and begins to toast the fleet in system.  SDBs go for cover, or evade to 
conduct further operations, and the still jump-capable ships jump out of 
system.  

The Task Force Commander, after some period of softening up the planet 
(how long?), decides that planetary landings may commence.  They do, and 
combat on the surface continues until one side wins.

In the back of his mind, he\'s got to be thinking about how long he has 
until the next combat ready enemy fleet "could" arrive...  12 days, at 
the absolute minimum, to what, 6 weeks?  He\'s probably sent for 
reinforcements too, based on the outcome of the battle, so when the 
enemy fleet arrives, friendlies may be coming in too.  So you could have 
a lengthy series of engagements...that could stretch to months...  Would 
stretch to months, IMO.

So from experience, and knowing that each system is different with 
different forces, etc,:
1. How long do the actual shooting engagements take? (fleet actions)
2. How long could SDB fleets be expected to survive?
3. How long do planetary invasions take?
4. How long do "campaigns" for a system take?

For a really good example of a running fleet battle, that is within the
Traveller "feel", read the intro story in War World vol2 IIRC.  It details
a raid by a Sauron BC against Tanith to capture the Borzoi crop (The only
thing that is able to sedate the Saurons).  The BC engages a CA and two
CLs, IIRC.  By the end of the story, it had turned into a weeks long
slugfest that was the final major fleet engagement of the war.  

It also contained a very cool description of battle-armor Marines doing an
assault on the CA.

I\'m not sure all the above support units are going to be there in the 
initial assault.  That is one of the things I don\'t quite understand 
about the combat system...hence my other post asking about times of 
combat.  Some of these support ships would be there, but I\'d only 
anticipate that they would give some expeditionary capability, and not 
the full blown fleet support.  

Full fleet support would come later, I suppose, but how much later?  
First wave?  Second wave?  Before or after the counterattack?  

With the weeks involved in communication, the fleet employment problem 
is magnified.

Traveller has been likened to the Age of Sail, with notable differences.  
Historically, how many ships in a sailing squadron were of support type?  
Few, I\'d guess.  Most of the ships were self-contained fighting ships, 
carrying their "sawbones" with them, having most everything they needed 
with them, to include spare spar, sails, etc.  Maybe there should be 
more support in the fighting ships themselves and not in support 
vessels...

Agreed but then again I think only slave trading between systems are of

I think I know what the variable frame of reference group are after:

To not have to worry about relative stellar motion etc in gameplay and come
up with some handwave to justify it. I think this is valuable as the
relative stellar motion would complicate things alot as arrival/departure
times from/to systems would increase quite a bit and would depend on what
pair of starsystems the jumping was done from.

To be honest, most of the time relative stellar motion will be less of an
annoyance than simple orbital velocity, since most stars will be moving in a
reasonably similar direction.  In any case, the maximum delta-V involved is
probably going to be lower than the delta-V acquired in a run from orbit to the
jump diameter (for any vessel with 1+ Gs) and thus you can probably just assume
that its automatically dealt with, it won\'t make that big of a difference in
transit times.

Kidnapping per se is probably not an Imperial Crime, but the moment
kidnapper and kidnappee move through Imperial space, it becomes one.
This is analogous to all those \'crossing state lines\' clauses making
local infractions federal crimes here in the US. BTW, since the 30\'s
kidnapping, whether or not you cross a state line, has been a federal
crime here. This was due to a large rash of kidnappings for ransom, not
just the Lindbergh case.

Not, IIRC, a rumor, as much as very preliminary research. I believe I
read a short bit about it in SciAm some time ago. Anyway, they\'re also
looking at very seriously at diamond merely as the chip substrate
instead of silicon...for the semiconductors they lay on silicon or
gallium arsenide layers. Diamond is so much more thermally stable than
silicon it\'s not funny, and it\'s far less reactive. Diamond substrate
chips with Cu conductors, gallium arsenide semiconductors and optical
memory would make for a howling fast computer. We be talking gigahertz
speeds here folks, tens and hundreds of gigahertz.

Which, btw, could account for the huge sizes of CT computers...the
computer itself is the size of, say, a PC-XT, but the shielding required
to meet FCC regs for home use swell it to tons!

You are rarely silenced with duct tape and thrown in a car trunk on a
job, unless you\'re working for the Mob, and that is actually less a part
of the job than one of HR\'s mandated severance and termination policies.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

With few exceptions, most of the Traveller design rules allow
you to optimize the hell out of your ship designs with respect
to combat. What\'s the minimum cargo tonnage for a 150000tn
Battleship? What penalties does the Battleship suffer if it doesn\'t
have that cargo tonnage available? Does the Battleship have to
carry an entire Marine Planetary Assault Force on board to
be effective (as per the Star Destroyers in Star Wars), or can it
depend on support units for that task?

The Battle Rider/Battle Tender is an extreme example of taking
non-combat capabilities off the combat ship and putting them
on a dedicated non-combat ship. Without Jump Fuel and Jump
Drives, a Battle Rider will easily defeat a Battleship of the same
tonnage. If the Battleship also must carry it\'s own Marines,
Small Craft, a campaign\'s worth of stores, etc., the problem
gets worse. 

All but a tiny percentage of Age of Sail navy ships were warships.
Most of those warships had lots of cargo space and extra crew,
though there were ships of short cruising range that did not.
It wasn\'t until the age of steam that you started to see Colliers
(Fuel Supply Ships) and such - but the specialization of ships,
and the creation of specialized support ships did not happen until
communications made it possible to coordinate these support
assets. Since this level of communication is impossible in
Traveller, IMO you should see multirole ships - carrying their
own fuel and refueling facilities, carrying troops, etc.

The original 400tn Patrol Cruiser from CT was built with a whopping
50dtn cargo bay, more than 10% of volume. Azhanti High Lightning
cruisers carried their own fuel shuttles, marines and fighters. 
How specialized for combat can your starships be before they
become too dependent on support ships?

I was refering to the stated similarity of slavery and kidnapping "being
controlled by others for *their* purposes".  The typical schmoe is being
controlled by his boss to what the boss wants.  Sure, he gets paid for it, but
that wasn\'t part of the distinction above.

I think the similarity above is that you\'re being held against your will rather
than working for it.  Which then raises the question of prisoners.

So if you were to mount a T-plate on an asteroid in a systems outer reaches
you could accelerate it up and make it a really nasty weapon then? ;-)

Check out Tim Collinson\'s  Traveller Bibliography if you can get hold of a

There\'s quite a comprehensive list at Marc Miller\'s FarFuture site. Can\'t
remember the URL off hand but you can get to it through my site (URL in

Hrm...unspeakable topics.  In any case, this isn\'t necessary, the kinetic
energy from a constantly accelerating object is (distance)*(force) (if using
thrust in tons and distance in AU, it\'s about 400 kilotons*D*F) -- the mass of
the object being accelerated is irrelevant.  Therefore, you don\'t need to mount
the T-plate on anything.  Of course, since thruster plates violate conservation
of energy and can be used to create perpetual motion machines, it\'s probably
best to just fudge the physics on such collisions... ;)

I agree it would be great to have an Andre Norton\'s Universe

However, I seem to remember that she died a year or two ago. Am I
wrong?

I still prefer the "retain your velocity relative to the universe as a 
whole" and "exit point moves relative to the universe as a whole at
the same velocity as the ship had when it entered jumpspace."
approach. For example, if you were moving at 10 km/s (relative to, say,
the galactic center) when you entered jump space, and your jump took two
hours longer than expected, you\'d emerge 72,000 km away from your planned
exit point. If you match velocities with your target planet before entering
jump, the jump exit point will (roughly) move along with it, so even if the
jump is a day late you\'ll be close to the planet when you exit.
Nice and internally consistent.

Although I\'m personally fairly strongly anti-fighter, I still believe
they might be useful for commerce raiding or \'space control\'; a fighter
squadron can attack (light) targets spread out over a large area of space
better than a single cruiser could - for example, attacking interplanetary
traffic, or a convoy that has "scattered". Whether a 50-ton fighter or a 
200-ton gunboat is better is more ambiguous, but in some sense that\'s just
semantics: many small carried craft can cover more space than a single
jump-capable large ship. 

Of course, in a canonical Traveller universe, as has been pointed out,
there are few such opportunities. The 100-diameter limit is comparable
to weapons range for a ship, so a cruiser or two can completely control the
space inside a planets\' 100-d limit - and a convoy outside the 100-d limit
will simply jump rather than scattering. Interplanetary traffic will 
most likely be microjump-driven as well. Only in very specialized
situations (planets around gas giants or big stars, and inhabited asteroid
belts) will you have targets spread out over tens of millions of km.

However, if one were to crank the 100-diametare limit up a little, things 
would change...

Hi. I\'m one of the silent members of TML. This is my first posting.

Well, modern (wet) ships make pretty short work of missiles in moderate 
quantities.

But this discusion makes me think that the rules concerning Nuke
Dets might need a change.  My take on how they work is that upon
firing, the warhead deploys a number of laser rods in the direction of
the taget. IMO this should be more then 6 rods (the max of the 1D6
roll). As some of these beams seem to miss their target this should
mean that a Nuke Dets fires the laser beams in an narrow cone.
 
     Nuke
      /\\ 	
     /  \\     Cone   
    /    \\
     ___
   /      \\
   \\___/ Target

So the number of hits should depend upon the area of the target. 

Maybe something like this could work..

Displacement	Hits
0-200 dt	                1D3
201-1000	dt	1D6
1001-10000 dt	2D6
10001+ dt	3D6

Exact numbers would depend on the number of rods.

Sure, what if your main world is within the 100D limit of its
_star_. Then the limit is pretty big...

Or around class M stars, where the life zone tends to be within the 100
diameter limit.  Note, however, that supply convoys aren\'t really required to
be within the life zone in any case.

Particularly if you crank it beyond 200-odd diameters, so the limit is outside
the life zone of a typical star.

So research bases, critical command centers, etc. might be
placed on the innermost planets - as far within the star\'s 100-diameter
limit as possible - to make any attacker have to spend a long
time in normal space before they can attack it.

The couple minute lag times for communication might be
a worthwhile price to pay, except that if Admiral Whatsisname
wants to visit your research lab he\'s got to cool his heels in
a shuttlecraft for a pretty good chunk of time - and it might be
bad if an emergency happened and the good Admiral\'s fleet had
to leave without him.

Kidnapping and Slavery are much the same thing, in legal terms.  Call itFreedom

False Imprisonment, Slavery, all restrict a sophont\'s freedom.

"Posing as a sophont."  Thats interesting.  Since a non-sophont wouldbe
incabable of having the necessary mental state to commit this
crime, I think anyone who pulled it off, would qualify as a sophont
and would therefore be guilty of nothing.  What are you going to do?
Put a dog on trial for impersonating a Vargr?

Don\'t forget starports are Imperial territory.  And interstellar commerce.And

Well, having the legal authority is one thing.  Having the power and desire
aretwo others.  Certainly, there will be different degrees of tolerance in
different
areas for different reasons.  But the legal authority is there.  And it really
is
very broad, at least on paper.

Maybe in YTU, but its pretty clear that any such behavior against Sophonts
is antithetical to the charter of the Third Imperium.  Ziru Sirka?  I don\'t
have
any idea.  Rule of Man, I should think most definitely not.  3I, no way.

As is bank robbery.  The same should apply to the robbery of any bank,any
where in the Imperium, that does any transaction in Imperium currency.

BTW, just because something is an Imperial Crime, doesn\'t mean only
the Imperium can deal with it.  In the US, States and Federal courts and
police agencies, have concurrent jurisdiction in a great many cases.
This means either court/agency can proceed against the crime.
Thus, IMHO, Kidnapping is an Imperial Crime, but any Member world\'s
judicial system with jurisdiction is competent to prosecute and punish
the offense, unless the accused can make a sufficient showing that he is
unlikely to get a fair trial in the member world\'s courts.

How about a "good-enough" hack for calculating GeoSync with
the UWP?  Though there is scant correlation, you could always
fake the length-of-day and world mass, right?  For worlds we
have no data on, why not try and see?

world radius = size x 500   (in km)
earth masses = size x atmosphere / 56
period       = (size^2 x atmosphere x hydrosphere + 36) modulo 50

This guarantees a day is no longer than a certain amount.
Hey, it ain\'t pretty, and it ain\'t real, but it churns out numbers
real nice.

Ok, then.  Just add the word "involuntarily."  You can always quit your job.You
can\'t quit being a kidnappee or a slave.

Prisoners forfeit most of their rights and privileges, indeed, often their
verylives.  Your life and freedom are forfeit.  They are the sovereign\'s.  Thus,
chain gangs are acceptable.  However, you are correct in pointing out
the possible tension between these ideas.  When does acceptable treatment
of prisoners cross the line into slavery of free sophonts?  Certainly, the
Imperium would not tolerate life imprisonment at labor for jaywalking.

However, there would be several difficult areas, especially with regard
to religious/poltical heresy, etc.  My conclusion is that the Imperium will
intervene when a member world\'s actions, or inaction, are beyond
a reasonable standard.  I\'m not sure what that standard should be at the moment.
In the US, we commonly use 3 different standards in dealing with laws that
may be unconstitutional.  The standards vary according to the authority of
the federal system to legistlate in a specific area, the authority of the states,
and the particular type of behavior involved.

An action must have a
- - Rational relation to a legitimate state interest,
- - Reasonable relation to a substantial state interest, or
- - Narrowly tailored to a compelling state interest
to pass scrutiny.

I doubt the Imperium would have the same range.
I think its a worthy topic of discussion where that line should be, as a legal
matter.
I suspect the Imperium will claim as much room as possible.  Of course,
enforcing that is another matter.

I tend to put some number of mechanical and electronic shops into military
designs, though of course there are no rules to define the advantages of 
this. I\'m thinking about damage control and repair rules for my Military
Combat System - maybe they should be tied to shops, etc. One can imagine
that a "mature technology" like most Traveller tends towards the highly
modular, and may also include automanufacturing, which would tend to let 
one carry out substantial repairs with relatively few spare parts - maybe
just a stock of generic modules and some raw materials that can be 
manufactured into better parts (hunks of BSD, purefied silicon, superconductor,
etc.) Sufficiently advanced technologies could manufacture spare parts from
even more raw materials (hunks of planetoid) but Traveller probably isn\'t
quite that advanced. 

An Age of Sail squadron on extended duty (like blockade) would tend to be 
supported by transports to bring water, fresh food, etc., from shore, and/or
to rotate out members of the squadron back to port, but generally such ships
were indeed relatively self-sustaining against normal wear-and-tear (water
being the thing they were most likely to run out of.) After major combat
ships would definitely need to go back to port for at least some patching,
reloading, and replacing of crew. Smaller ships like frigates tended to be 
even more self-sustaining. 

One thing that simplified fleet combat does neglect is ammunition  - 
replacement missiles. A TNE/T4 ship can go through its whole missile load
almost instantly; a missile-oriented fleet will need a major-league supply
chain to keep it operational. (I suppose one could invent "collapsing missiles"
in which you pack only the warhead and engine, and the body is machined out of
bulk metal when you need to reload and the fuel (heavy water for AND 
missiles) added then.) In TCS-type combats I generally make people pay 
ten times the cost for consumables (missiles and mines) to reflect some of
this.

>[good points about fleet engagements]

>1. How long do the actual shooting engagements take? (fleet actions)
Once ships are in weapons range of each other, only a few hours.
Chasing down someone who is trying to run away from you, or  intercepting
someone travelling across interplanetary space, can take much longer - but
such actions are relatively rare; most people who run away will just jump
away, and most ships have no reason to cross interplanetary space. 

>2. How long could SDB fleets be expected to survive?
They can hide nearly indefinitely, under an ocean or deep in a gas giant
atmosphere; their survival is measured by how long they\'re willing to wait
before engaging. Once they decide to emerge it\'ll only take a few minutes
to get out of the atmosphere and fight and die. 

>3. How long do planetary invasions take?
>The Task Force Commander, after some period of softening up the planet 
>(how long?)
This is a harder question. We should note that in mainstream Traveller
civilian populations are essentially unprotectable; any medium warship in
orbit can destroy a worlds infrastructure if unupposed, and even if opposed,
ships can carry out devastating kinetic bombardments from well outside of
the range of any possible response. So, if you\'re willing to threaten 
civilians and the enemy is interested in protecting them, they have little
choice but to surrender once defending ships (and maybe fixed defences) 
are gone. 

If civilians are off-limits to orbital bombardment then you have to land
troops. Large scale troop landing require taking out a substantial fraction
of the fixed defences (surface laser weapons especially, which can claw 
drop capsules out of the sky as fast as they can fire.) Getting close enough 
to do this probably requires shutting down fixed (deep) meson sites.
There will probably be a fairly lengthy duel between invading ships and fixed
meson weapons - taking days if one or both sides are cautious, or hours if
one side is agressive and unconcerned with casualties. Once the meson sites 
are out the attacking ships move closer and deal with lighter surface
defences; this probably takes hours more (and of course you can never be sure
you\'ve gotten them all until you start landing troops.) The actual
descent and landing of the first wave probably takes only ten minutes, followed
by fighting around high-value targets (like remaining ground-based defences) 
as drop troops land, followed by landing of heavier troops in shuttles. 

The length of the whole campaign to conqour a planet depends on its population
and the resources devoted to it. The campaign for Terra took months...but 
a battle for a Pop-5 world where everyone is concentrated in a single city
might only take a week, or a couple of days.


A couple more thoughts on orbital bombardment:

IMTU, grav focus pulses can\'t travel through atmosphere - so ground-based
lasers are quite short ranged (only a few hexes at most.) Similarly, 
ships shooting down at a target beneath an atmosphere will suffer major
degradations due to atmospheric blurring of the beam unless they\'re within a
couple of hexes (if they\'re too far away, the lightspeed lag makes it 
impossible for their beam control to cancel the turbulence well enough to 
hit a target.) Orbital installations are incredibly vulnerable to kinetic
missile attack, so moons (big enough to bury a site under enough rock to
protect it from kinetic attack, but with no atmosphere to diffuse beams)
become very important and the best site for laser batteries to protect the
mainworld from missile attack.

Also, although there\'s a conception that being in orbit gives you a big
"high ground" advantage in that you can "drop rocks" on your opposition,
at Traveller tech levels this isn\'t much of an advantage. A high-performance
missile can accelerate at 20-40G for a substantial time. A rock dropped from
orbit arrives at less than 10 km/s; a 20G missile reaches this speed in 
less than a minute. Consequently, high-performance kinetic missiles
fired from the surface are pretty much as deadly as ordinance dropped from
orbit. A world worried about invasion might pre-deploy underground or 
underwater kinetic missile batteries that could be called in as artillery
strikes on invading troops. The attackers would have to keep enough spacecraft
in orbit to shoot down such a missile salvo - which might be very, very,
very large. (A pop-10 world could have a million half-ton 20G missiles
predeployed for a small fraction of its military budget, each impacting like
ten 10-ton bombs...) The classical "Thor" concept of pre-deploying these 
into orbit only makes sense over a narrow range of tech levels. 

A "strike cruiser" (optimized for supporting invasions) should have a 
medium-sized spinal meson mount (for engaging deep meson sites), a 
medium-sized missile battery (mostly kinetic warheads for attacking orbital
or lunar targets), and a lot of rapid-fire lasers (for engaging groundside
laser batteries and for protecting landing craft and landed troops.) 
Armour could actually be fairly light, since the main threat is deep
meson weapons. A parallel PAW spinal mount might help for engaging lunar
targets.

Quit your job and you and your family starve.  Quitting a kidnapping or slavery is
called escape.  Note that it is generally advisable to feed and house kidnappees and
slaves while jobs have no such overhead.

It is exactly because of that tension that I don\'t think even slavery is in the
Imperial jurisdiction.  Slavery isn\'t always black and white, its VERY grey.
Example: Dad forces son to take out trash, is that slavery?  Entire family decides to
work for rich man for no pay but rich man feeds, clothes and houses said family... Is
that slavery?

This should be true - and it should be true for any weapon, since lasers
generally fire tens of pulses per turn and should get multiple hits on
big targets.

My work-in-progress Military Combat system includes this effect (plug,plug)
for missiles and other weapons by adding hits based on how much you make
the to-hit roll by - and the to-hit roll depends on the targets\' surface
area. It still does end up assuming that missiles only have ten or so 
rods, though.

What\'s not to like???    I just spent a very enjoyable couple of hours

No, I realize it is not *that* far away, but I was referencing (I
believe MM) remarks made lately about developing sectors outside/inside
the T4/T5 Imperium that should be \'one or two sectors away\'. Either of
these two seem to fit the bill, and I wouldn\'t mind working on one or
the other, IF no one else minds or has done so in the past. The last
thing I want to do is undermine or overwrite what others before have
spent painstaking hours on.

For the *electronic version* above, if available, my system is MSDOS
based, Win95, Netscape. I may have to retrieve the data from your sight.
If not, I have gained a lot of missing information for which I thank you
very much.

This is tricky. Define \'support\'.
Recommended human caloric intake for adults ranges from 1500 to 4000
cal/d
(Sedentary to hard labour ranges ; 1000 to 1500 per day borderline
starvation, less than 1000 - death camp rations).
WHO minima : 2600 kcal per day, 65g of which should be protein (10% at 4
cal/g protein).

Technology affects how many calories you can extract from an area of
land : eg. fertiliser, irrigation, tractors, animal growth
promoters.....

We\'ll consider two examples (the U.S. and the Republic of Mali).
Each is at opposite ends of the calories per capita spectrum, and was
roughly in export/import balance for foodstuffs over the
period of time the data was taken.

U.S.A. (1988)
Calories per capita : 3642
Protein intake : 106.5 g/d
Population : 246.33 million
Arable land (crops only) : 1897486 sq. km
Pasture land (grazing animals only) : 2410816 sq. km

Outputs (thousands of tonnes) :-
Cereal        206467
Meat          27935
Vegetables 27894
Fruit           25735

Each square kilometre supports 130 people (carbohydrate intake) or
102 people (animal protein intake), per year.

[One square kilometre is 100 hectares, each hectare is 2.47 acres].

Republic of Mali (1988)
Calories per capita : 2020
Protein intake : 54.3g/d
Population : 8.92 million
Arable land : 20743 sq. km
Pasture : 300167 sq. km
Outputs (thousands of tonnes) :-
Cereal       2432
Meat           154
Vegetables  245
Fruit             13

Each square kilometre supports 430 people (carbohydrate) or
30 people (animal protein) per year.

I am wondering how the jump routes are encoded in the galactic sector
files. (I\'m using galactic 2.3, a great little program!)

I have customized the jump routes to be very rare (essentially between
close A & B starports only) but find that there are still too many, and
some "important" worlds are skipped over.


A sample is:

$0209 0111 0 1

obviously the first two fields are the hex numbers of the worlds, but what
of the 0 and 1?  I have also seen -1 and 10 used.  What do they mean?

data though, just world positions, which I found rather odd.

Has anyone heard of this thing before?

I haven\'t bought it yet, but if someone is interested I could pick it up for
them. The asking price is $1.95 US at the store (plus the cost of shipping
to any interested party). It is in pretty used condition, though, so it\'s
not much of a collectors\' piece, and I have a hard time seeing it being
useful in any other way.

Oh, I also found several Traveller\'s Digests (15-17, 20) and that holiest of
grails, DGP\'s World Builder\'s Handbook, all also for a $1.95. :-) I giggled
hysterically when I found that last one. I haven\'t decided if I want to sell
it or not yet (I\'ve been looking for it for about 8 years). It\'s a little
worn, but hey, I\'d expect that from a book used by the ISS.

thrust you lose your low signiture advantage. And how will you manuver you
fighters? If they go for least-time/max-velocity intercept it will take
them three times their base-to-strike time to return to base. If they
attempt to match velocities, they expose themselves to defense fire for a
long time. Also, HARMs are useless against passive sensors (no R to A).
Passive sensors seem the more powerful in Traveller.

If they have fixed weapons they can\'t run away and fire at the same time
(or charge to the attack and fire at the same time). The best design would
seem to be weapons in swivel mounts that can either fire directly forward
or directly aft.


This discussion convinced me to go to the Sentry Box today to buy FFS2. In
the event, however, i didn\'t buy it for four reasons.
1)Flipping through it in the store i found six typos by comparing the text
to the tables. (I wasn\'t trying, honest.)
2)Some of the assumptions seem a little odd. (Such as the radiators.)
3)Some of the assumptions don\'t seem internally consistent. (Thruster
plates work by twisting space which must already be stressed. Therefore,
they are ineffective beyond 2000au (from a sun-like star), but are equally
effective at all depths of gravity wells within 2000au....Huh?)
4)I\'d rather buy food.

I also noticed that thruster plate ships are back to having infinite endurance.



I\'ll be convinced that FFS2 fighters are useful anti-convoy assests if
someone posts a design that meets the following specs:

- -1-around 50 tons displacement (this is what we\'ve been talking about)

- -2-high enough thrust to get into its own killing range while minimizing
time within target\'s killing zone

- -3-low enough signiture to increase chance of entering own killing zone
withiout taking heavy defensive fire
   (2 & 3 need to be played off for optimum balance)

- -4-long enough legs to intercept convoys and return to base

- -5-tough enough to survive at least 50% of committed engagements vs. armed
merchant convoys (say 1000dt hulls with 4 150Mj lasers each and light
escorts)

- -6-at least as strong a first punch as the equivalent volume of missiles
(include survival rate: if 1 fighter = 50 missiles by volume and 50% of
fighters survive to attack and 10% of missiles do then 1 fighter needs to
mount a first punch equivalent to 50 * 0.1 / 0.5 = 10 missiles)

- -7-cheaper than it\'s lifetime equivalent in missile strike power (If
mission survival rate is 50% then 99% of fighters will be destroyed in 7
missions or less. So, the example fighter must be cheaper than 7 * 10 / 0.1
= 700 missiles (this is generous in favour of fighters).)



This will convince me that FFS2 fighters are theoretically useful, but like
any military commander i won\'t be convinced they\'re a threat to _my_ fleets
until they start decimating my supply lines :->

The former is within your control.  Its your volitional act.  The latter is generally
not, as the kidnapper and the enslaver directly challenge your ability to "quit" the
situation.I was hoping you weren\'t going to press the poor analogy.

Well, its in clearly in the Warrant of Restoration, so it is within the jurisdiction and
ever member world consents to be governed by that document, which supercedes all member
law contrary to Imperial law.  No getting around that.

Not IMO.

Is son an emancipated sophont?  Sophont, yes.  Emancipated, no.Therefore, not slavery.

The family "decided".  Therefore, not slavery.

Neither of these examples even approach the concept of slavery.

Just for grins and giggles:
Black\'s Law Dictionary, 5th Ed.:

"Slavery.  The condition of a slave; that civil relation in which one man has absolute
power over the life, fortune, and liberty of another.

Slave.  A person who is wholly subject to the will of a another; one who has no freedom
of action, but whose person and services are wholly under the control of another.  One
who is under the power of a master, and who belongs to him; so that the master may sell
and dispose of his person, of his industry, and of his labor, without his being able to
do anything, have anything, or acquire anything, but what must belong to his master."

Where\'s the grey area there?  If the person is property, its slavery.  This is emphasized
by the term "chattel slavery,"  as seen in the Warrant of Restoration.

Note that children are not treated as adults, and therefore restriction on their freedom
short of abuse are acceptable.  I am aware of no culture in which this is not true.
Regardless, children also have rights and can\'t be treated as property.

  Mali\'s agriculture isn\'t a lot better than the U.S.(TL4-5 vs 8!) ; it
depends on how you define arable land. I\'d multiply the arable land area
by 8 to include \'forested\' areas - there must be some gathering going on
as well.
This yields a value of 56 people per square km for carbos, which is
probably closer to the \'true\' value.

Whether or not hunter-gathering enables a smaller \'footprint\' is argued
about in some circles. I suspect not.

I know this is not the usual TML fare, but if you don\'t feed the people,
there
aren\'t going to be any starships to fly.....

Is anyone interested in Medicine in Traveller ? I\'d be happy to provide
some info (and wild speculation about the future beyond managed care
:-)

This is tricky. Define \'support\'.&nbsp;
Recommended human caloric intake for adults ranges from 1500 to 4000 cal/d&nbsp;

We\'ll consider two examples (the U.S. and the Republic of Mali).&nbsp;
Each is at opposite ends of the calories per capita spectrum, and was roughly in export/import balance for foodstuffs over the&nbsp;
period of time the data was taken.&nbsp;

U.S.A. (1988)&nbsp;
Calories per capita : 3642&nbsp;

Meat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27935&nbsp;
Vegetables 27894&nbsp;
Fruit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25735&nbsp;

Each square kilometre supports 130 people (carbohydrate intake) or&nbsp;
102 people (animal protein intake), per year.&nbsp;

[One square kilometre is 100 hectares, each hectare is 2.47 acres].&nbsp;

Republic of Mali (1988)&nbsp;
Calories per capita : 2020&nbsp;

	This makes so much sense I\'m embarassed I didn\'t think of it a 
long time ago.  Over on trav-tech I\'ve done a ton of stuff with various 
kinds of shotgun-style bb missiles which work on essentially the same 
principle.  I don\'t know why it never occured to me that det-lasers 
should work the same way.

If we assume that the 1D6 hits refers to Small class ships and that #hits 
is proportional to cross-sectional area, then an average ship of each 
size class would receive the following number of hits:

Class		Displacement	#Hits
- ----
Small		100-999		  1D6
Medium		1,000-9999	  5D6
Large		10,000-99,999	 25D6
V. Large	100,000-999,999	125D6
Gigantic	1,000,000+	625D6

(You can derive this by averaging the cross-sectional area of the smallest 
and largest spherical ships in each class, then finding the proportional 
increase for each size class.  It turns out to be a constant 4.6, here 
rounded up to 5.)

	Recognizing that large ships will intercept more of the nuke\'s
energy and thus take more damage has an enormous and, IMHO, positive
impact on Traveller naval combat.  It means that battleships will suffer
almost as much (as a proportion of hit capacity) from a missile attack as
a scout ship.  (Since damage capacity is related to volume, which rises
faster than surface area, big ships are still better off).  This is great 
news, because without it, naval combat degenerates to a contest of spinal 
mounts.  Missiles will still not be the knock out punches against capital 
ships that spinal mounts are, but it does mean that a capital ship 
without escorts and open to missile attack will be in deep trouble.  
That\'s the way it should be.
	It is still not clear that it makes fighters important, since we 
still need to determine what the best missile delivery system is, but it 
does mean that missile armed fighters could be quite dangerous.

An example from Brilliant Lances:

	A Midu Agashaam-class Destroyer is one of the staples of the
Imperial Navy.  It displaces 3000Td, carries a spinal PAW, 8xLTs, 6xMslT,
& 6xSCs.  Under BL it can take a total of 235 Hits (a third of which is
the purification plant).  Yet a single det-laser missile can now hit 5D6
times, each strike inflicting DV-72 or 3 Hits.  That comes out to 15-90
Hits total.  Considering that the PP can only take 33H, this is could be
enough for a mission kill.  
	Since T4\'s technology comes from FF&S2, itself an extension of
Brilliant Lances, this should hold true for later versions of the game as
well. 

	Ultimately whether or not to use this rule is a matter of taste.  
What do people think?

 This applies to all material on my site, and to all listening: private use

 My site inflicts some deep scratches into the material I\'ve developed
over the years, but they are scratches, nonetheless...
 I have sector data for every sector map on my site except Beyond.
This is the same data, by the way, as can be found on Kagehira\'s
great CD compilation under Tienspevnekr (all mine) and Zhdant
(which I provided most of the world names for).
 Other stuff is largely fragmentary, and gets attention as it needs
it...

  I\'m sure SOMEONE out there has probably done something, but if
they don\'t publish in some form (paper OR web) then the material
effectively doesn\'t exist, and the only person who can complain if
YOU decide to publish in some form is Marc Miller. The rest of us can
comment, advise, opine, and/or whine all we like...

 Being a Mac user and a long-time Netizen, I use raw text for much of this
stuff because I know that others will attempt read my work with programs
I may never have heard of. No worries.
 I haven\'t web\'d most of my sector listings due to their being pre-TNE in
their
stellar assortments. In my copious spare time I convert them, but other things
usually claim a higher priority...

An often overlooked portion of the Terran navy during the Interstellar Wars,
the highly specialised Bomb Ketches were none the less a vital part of the
fleet. Designed specifically for planetary bombardment duties, two very
distinct forms of the vessels were produced. The first were the small cheap,
mass produced designs intended for service as orbital artillery in low threat
environments; the second were the larger heavily protected designs intended
to neutralise enemy planetry defences. The General Grant class fell into
this second catergory. The most notable feature of the design was the heavily
protected hull (over 1.1 meters of crystaliron) with armour that would not
disgrace a Ship of the Line. Since the vessel was intended to operate in a
stable low orbit, little attention was paid to maneuverability; however the
class featured an extensive ECM outfit with particular emphasis on passive
jamming and a heavy point defence laser battery. The class carried six 3 Td
lifeboats, each capable of carring up to 11 passengers for up to 24 hours
(since the class operated mainly in low orbit, this was considered sufficent
endurance).

The classes sole offensive armarment was its single missile bay optimised for
the small (0.25 Td) Raiden missile. The Raiden was a short range high-g
missile which could be fitted with a wide variety of warheads, including a
500 KT det laser, a 12 x 10 KT MIRV, a wide variety of smart deadfall
ordinance, chemical and biological warheads, and many others. Bomb Ketches
remained an important part of the Terran Confederation\'s fleets throughout
the Interstellar Wars, but they fell out of favour as the Rule of Man adopted
Vilani style Strike Cruisers in the planetary attack role (though fitted with
the newly developed meson gun).

One of the most famous examples of the type was the Marshal Ney. During the
Eigth Interstellar War, the Marshal Ney was one of the flagship of the small
flotilla of Bomb Ketches that were carried by Admiral Albadawi\'s jump 3 fleet
tenders. It was the accurate and effective attacks by the flotilla that
enabled Aldadawi to reduce Enulsur, Apishlun, Shikashu and Duriim in quick
succession; thereby isolating the Vilani fleet and enabling the Terrans to
smash open the frontier.

How exactly do you engage a Deep Meson site? If you 
don\'t know where it is, how can you figure that out? You 
can\'t see the Mesons coming, so you can\'t triangulate.

I guess you could sit in orbit and try and detect large 
power sources underground, but zapping all the electric 
trains probably wouldn\'t make you popular.

Traditionally I\'d always thought of them as requiring either 
wiping the surface clean of sensors hooked up to the 
Deep Meson site, or landing troops as fast as possible to 
try and find the bloody thing.

I hate Meson guns...

This should be the case for single round attacks as well as it could be
assumed that making the attack roll with a lot means a better hit (better
located).
As you already have a log based damage system simply postulate that if you
roll the target number exactly (or whatever constitutes a near miss in the
system) roll the damage 1D6 twice and use the lowest result and if a
spectacular sucess ocurred roll 1D6 twice and take the best result. This
assumes that spectacular success should be easier with easier tasks.

My 0.02 Cr based somewhat on how my personal/vehicle/starship combat system
works.

Please remember that the Imperium is NOT USA.

The Imperium allows fullblown wars to run on planets without intervening
unless the combatants start using ABC weaponry or (shudder) disturb
interstellar trade. Keep this fact in mind when conjuring up what level of
detail the Imperial Judicial system operate at.

The Traveller Imperium doesn\'t resemble any country, alliance, empire or
federation in the earths history.

Dr Theo Krenstein was supposedly in deep shit for letting his AB101
pseudobio pose as a sophont when dubbed as Knight in the first installment
of the DGP publications. This is fairly well established in Canon.

Come ON! There\'s a commonsense line here..the bit is _voluntarily_. I have
quit several jobs, and not come close to starving. I got another job.

First, no matter what the son thinks as he\'s dragging the trash out, the legal
definition of \'family\', and specifically the relationships between minors and
their guardians are clearly spelled out in most jurisdictions. Demanding that
your child do their chores is ok. Demanding that they get a job and turn over
their earnings to the family or leave is OK, depending on the local child
labor laws. Selling them to a sweatshop is not, at least under US law, and
prosecuted vigorously if found out. Other places may vary...in India, for
instance, it\'s a common practice, though illegal.

The second question makes no sense. The family in question most certainly
_are_ being paid, though in goods and services rather than cash. Where it
turns into slavery is if they want to leave and rich man says no, you have to stay.

If, however, they have signed a contract for a specified term of employment,
their employer, as signatory to the contract, is entitled to recompense under
whatever the contract states, including continued service for the employer.

This is called \'indentured servitude\', and this truly skirts the line between
employment and slavery very closely. A world that did this a lot, for very
long terms, particularly to off worlders would get some serious scrutiny from
the MOJ. It took some 65 years or so, but they finally eliminated it in
professional baseball here in the US. 

Slavery is outlawed, mere exploitation is not.

Would PMPP warhead really have a significant advantage in performance of a
HEAP warhead?

I mean, sure, it\'d *look* cool, but a PMPP is designed as a multiple use
weapon, and Im sure that a single-use explosive warhead would run much
cheaper.

Oh, wait a sec, I bet you want this thing to cruise around the battlefield,
blowing away BD troops over and over again, right?  I was thinking it was a
one-shot fire and forget missile type device.

In that case, I hope your IFF gear is up to date and working well.  I think
a robotic brain might be in order (considerably more than a target-seeker
guidance system) with some variable tactical algorithms, a radio comm unit
(or two) for attack and recall signal transmission, and a bit of armor to
shrug off the first point-defense shot from the BD trooper (assuming YTU
has such things).

I think its probably more expensive than you think.

Slavery is an Imperial crime as sources on the rebellion from GDW and DGP
tell us. Margaret is portrayed as being so narrowminded free-trade
proponent that she enen allows slavery within her borders - a true break
with Imperial tradition.

Ah!  Well funny you should mention that.  I\'m just putting the finishing

(Yes, I know I\'m potty - there were 900 of the wretched things - I won\'t do

Anyway the answer to your question can be found in the following example

And Arnold Schwartzenegger has escaped a lot in the movies too.  I\'ve seen MANY cases where
people are living paycheck to paycheck.  Sure, not all people are like that, but not all

Well, what if you claim your slaves as dependents under the Imperial taxation laws?  When
you buy said slave, you instead call it adopting and then you meddle with a few of the
child labor laws... Voila! de facto slavery.

What about the old mining companies where you get paid in scrip.  Valueless outside the
corporation.  All your stuff is corporate property.  So the boss may say go ahead and quit,
you have no means of supporting yourself outside the corporate enclave.  Is that slavery?

  So the question is Where is that line?  Like I said, its gray.  If it weren\'t gray, we\'d
either still have slavery in the USA or it never would have existed.

Since it is such a gray matter, I can\'t see the Imperium wasting so much resources to
enforce it.

Apparently there _is_ a way  to  determine  world  rotation  rate
based on mass and  size  ...  I  was  hoping  one  of  the  astro
gearheads would have posted something by  now.  The  complication
comes from a drag effect from  any  satellites.  From  what  I\'ve
read the Earth\'s day should actually by about 8 hours,  the  moon
has dragged this out to 24 hours and gained  some  distance  from
the Earth in the process.

A GeoSync hack should compute the base rotation rate, then add  a
random percentage  drag  factor.  In  the  absence  of  the  real
formulae for base rotation we could use Robert\'s proposed  method
reworked to give an 8 hour local day for size 8 worlds.

For drag I suggest the following:

    Max drag = Satellite\'s \'month\' - Base local day
    Actual drag = 2D-2 x 10% of max drag
    Actual local day = base local day + actual drag

The percentage of drag indicates the degree  of  geological  time
the satellite has been present.  A roll of  0  implies  either  a
very young star system, or a very recently  captured  object  (an
asteroid or rogue planet).  For  example,  Mars\'  satellites  are
thought to have originally been asteroids that passed  too  close
and bacame trapped ... they will eventually  impact  the  Martian
surface.

Obviously, a world without satellites would  just  use  the  base
local day ... there is no drag factor to apply.

Where there are multiple satellites then you\'ll need to find  the
\'average\' satellite ... by averaging  masses  and  distances  and
then calculate this virtual satellite\'s month.

I\'m not sure how to treat retrograde satellites, or  those  where
the satellite\'s orbital plane  is  markedly  different  from  the
world\'s equatorial plane.  I suspect rings can  be  ignored.  And
as with everything else there are always exceptions  ...  Mercury
and Venus don\'t follow this plan (possibly all worlds inside  the
habitable zone should be considered \'exceptional\').

Clearly warheads don\'t carry an infinte number of rods. Since the rods are
the most expensive part they probably don\'t even carry the 4000-odd implied
by the above.

In fact, I\'m not 100% sure where the assumption that there are many rods
"spraying" a volume of space really comes from. Detonatin lasers go off at
sufficiently short range that evasion isn\'t an issue; you\'d only need a whole
bunch of rods spraying empty space if (a) you can\'t aim them precisely
enough (and you only need to aim within a microradian or so to hit a 
100-ton ship at 10000km, which is within the limit of good mechanical
tracking) or (b) the detonation disturbs the aim (marginally
possible.) IN either caes I would tend to assume that a laser warhead
has at most ten rods.

(in my MCS I think I actually ended up assuming 6 rods, and the numbers are
such that most always hit most targets unless the target is small and
evading - I could change this if people are emotionally attached to 
1d6.)

Well, the best ways are the old ways; Sleep with the planetary defense
commander.

No really, pre-invasion intelligence (and post-invasion intelligence) is
probably the best way to figure out where, exactly, the nasty Meson Guns
are.

Of course, that brings up Meson Guns mounted on submarines or in
underground "railroads" that can change position at will.  Again, though,
*someone* knows (at least approximately) where they are, and that means
they can be persuaded to tell.

I certainly wouldn\'t be sending my marines down to ask directions.  If I
didn\'t know where they were, that large, hard object sent planetward would
start looking pretty good (compared to my fleet in ruins).  At that point,
the planetary authorities *better* start negotiating.

Consulting the agriculture section of WTH ... er ... there are no

I think I remember reading something about these types of warheads back
when SDI was the buzzword.  Perhaps we could find out what they were
planning and "reverse engineer" the design to FF&S to fit our needs.

THE LAW
	Every culture must have a pattern of laws (or regulations, expectations,
guidelines, or suggestions) which govern behavior. The determining
characteristics of a code of law are found in the dual spectra of Rigidity and
Objectivity.
	Rigidity. Legal codes may range from the rigid to the flexible. Rigid law
codes are infrequently changed and shape a culture뇹 activities by their
prohibitions. Flexible codes change with time and circumstances, and take into
account circumstances which may not be specifically incorporated into the
written laws. 
	Objectivity. Legal codes may range from the objective to the subjective.
Objective codes incorporate specific values and evaluate all suspected
violations against those values. Subjective codes call upon individuals
(whether judges, juries, or other legal agents) to make personal judgments
about the nature of violations. 

 LAW LEVEL
	Digit	Description
	0	No Law. No prohibitions.
	1	Low Law. No body pistols, explosives, poison gas.
	2	Low Law. Portable energy weapons prohibited.
	3	Low Law. Machineguns, automatic rifles prohibited.
	4	Moderate Law. Light assault weapons prohibited.
	5	Moderate Law. No personal concealable weapons.
	6	Moderate Law  All firearms except shotguns prohibited.
	7	Moderate Law. Shotguns prohibited.
	8	High Law. Blade weapons controlled; open display of any weapons prohibited.
	9	High Law. No weapons possession outside the home.
	A	Extreme Law. Weapon possession prohibited.
	B	Extreme Law. Rigid control of civilian movement.
	C	Extreme Law. Unrestricted invasion of privacy.
	D	Extreme Law. Paramilitary law enforcement.
	E	Extreme Law. Full-fledged police state.
	F	Extreme Law. All facets of daily life rigidly controlled.
	G	Extreme Law. Severe punishment for petty infractions.
	H	Extreme Law. Legalized oppressive practices.
	I	Extreme Law. Routinely oppressive and restrictive.

THE CATEGORIES OF CRIME
		Crimes Against
		Property	Environment	Beings	Society
	1	Vandalism	Waste	Assault	Violation
	2	Damage	Damage	Battery	Slack
	3	Theft	Pollution	Cruelty	Dishonor
	4	Destruction	Ravage	Killing	Treason
	5	Havoc	Ruin	Mass Killing	High Treason
	Degree. 	Crimes are further detailed by degree, the exponent of the economic
value or cost of the crime: Violation-2 is a minor crime involving a value of
about  Cr100. Intentionally killing a businessman is Murder-6 (attributing to
him a value of Cr1,000,000); killing a laborer is perhaps Murder-4. Assigning
economic value to a crime is admittedly sometimes a subjective decision.
	Intention: Intention affects the severity of consequences of committing a
crime. Lack of intention may be argued as a defense, and after conviction may
be used to reduce the severity of consequences.
	Cultural Values. Not all cultures believe that all of the instances on this
list are crimes.

INTENTION
	Intention is a strong component of crime. An individual who specifically
intends to commit a crime or to violate the law bears a greater degree of
guilt than someone who commits a violation in the heat of passion or through
inadvertence or negligence.
 Crimes Against Property
		Vandalism. Casual defacing of property.
	Damage. Physical devaluation of property, but falling short of destruction.
	Theft. Taking property Includes theft (taking by stealth) and robbery (taking
by force), fraud (taking by deception).
	Destruction. Physical destruction of property. Includes Arson, Bombing.
	Havoc. Mass or indiscriminant destruction of property.

Crimes Against The Environment
	Waste. Misuse of resources. Includes failing to sort trash, failure to
maintain equipment in efficient running order.
	Contamination. Minor crimes against the environment. Includes littering,
emitting obnoxious noises or odors, failure to dispose of useless property.
	Pollution. Serious crimes against the environment. Includes disposal of
untreated waste, unauthorized toxic waste production, . 
	Ravage. Commercial actions which degrade the environment without regard for
long-term consequences. Includes strip mining.
	Ruin. Non-commercial actions which degrade the environment. Includes setting
forest fires.

Crimes Against Beings.
	Beings may include intelligent beings, animals, artificial beings such as
robots or cyborgs, artificial intelligences, and artificial entities such as
corporations or companies.
	Assault. Violence against beings, but which inflicts no injury. Includes
threats, threatening actions, libel or slander.
	Battery. Violence against beings which results in injury to the victim.
Includes physical violence, emotional abuse; may include libel or slander.
	Cruelty. Causing pain or suffering to a being. Includes cruelty to animals,
torture. 
	Killing. Causing the death of an intelligent being. Includes murder and
serial murder.
	Mass Murder. Multiple killing of intelligent beings. Includes waging illegal
war and crimes of aggression.

Crimes Against Society or the State
	Violation. Disobedience of regulations. Includes traffic or curfew
violations, failures of permits or paperwork.
	Slack. Undue dependence on society or the state. Includes welfare or
unemployment assistance abuse.
	Dishonor. Betrayal of the basic principles of the society. 
	Treason. Adherence to the principles of an alternate or competing society.
	High Treason. Active support of the principles of a competing society to the
detriment of the individual뇹 native or adopted society.

The Elements of the Crime
	Motive
	Means
	Opportunity

Mitigation
	1. Intentional. The violation was performed with intention and with the
knowledge that it was wrong.
	2. Passionate or Emotionally Charged. The violation was performed in the heat
of passion or under extreme emotional duress.
	3. Accidental or Unintended. The violation occurred accidentally or without
intention.
	4. Ignorant. The violation took place without the individual being aware that
it happened or that it was a violation.

I\'ll make a note of it.

What I posted was an example of how the situation is treated in the US.
It is not a unique approach, by any stretch of the imagination.  Many
other countries have and do practice similarly.  The principle of
concurrent jurisdiction between sovereign governments is a rational
mechanism to deal with many problems.

So.  That contradicts nothing I\'ve said or that can be found in the Warrant

History repeats.  Humans are Human.  The Rule of Man was created byTerrans.

Certainly, the Imperium is unique, but it would be foolish to say that
historical
parallels are uniformly inappropriate.

So its the good Doctor who has committed the crime and not the pseudobio.That
would be something other than "posing", as its the pseudobio and not
the Doctor himself.  Perhaps, "misrepresentation of a pseudobio as sophont,"
"fraudulent sophontism," something along those lines.  I thought you meant
the pseudobio itself would be guilty of the crime.

Canon is only well established where it is well known.And with so many

Slavery is illegal in the Imperium.  There is absolutely no question about that.
What constitutes slavery is very clear: sophonts as personal property against their will.

The question for Traveller purposes is not whether one behavior is slavery or not.
The question is, can you get away with illegal slavery in the Imperium.
The answer to that is certainly "yes."

For the Imperium to prosecute slavery, several things must happen.
They must have:
- - awareness of the slavery,
- - the will to prosecute it, and
- - the resources to prosecute it.

For a multitude of reasons, the Imperium may not be able or willing to treat
all cases of slavery uniformly.

If a given situation is not clearly slavery, i.e., indentured servitude, etc.,
the Imperium may be unwilling to prosecute it.
If its a backwater planet with little significance to the Imperium, they may
not have the resources in the position to prosecute it.
If an enslaved race is not clearly a sophont race, at least to the Imperium\'s
knowledge, they have nothing to prosecute.

That slavery is illegal by Imperium law, wherever found within the Imperium,
is simply not a question.

No more than Vilani would consider chimps and apes to be "little brothers".

Seriously, a ship would need shielding like that at well, from the rf
interference such a computer could generate. Hospitals require special
shielding, and even business use systems are required to meet FCC \'B\'
class, which allows more noise from the system.

You don\'t. You engage the targeting systems. Once the thing can\'t see, it
can\'t shoot. Plus, if you take the planet, you simply have to repair the
command and control systems and now _you_ have a deep site meson gun.

Thus, a lot of firepower will be spent on destroying ground and orbit based
AEMS and PEMS arrays, and ground side communication systems.

This, in my opinion, would be SOP at any TL...in lower TLs it\'ll deal with
planetary defence missiles, and at higher TLs it will deal with the deep
meson guns.

Of course, considering that you can hide a virtually unlimited number of
forward observer posts with meson comms on an inhabited planet, \'engage the
targeting systems\' has limited meaning.

Oh yeah, and I am deeply indebted to Doug Berry for the idea of having the

Weeeeeelllll, I was kinda planning on one-shot. The logic is something like
battledress will have short range countermeasures against SEFOP grenades
and similar, but a nose-mounted plasma gun may be able to fire outside this
range. I think it is a viable concept, but it needs more work.

It\'s designed as a battledress breaker, so if your side doesnt use BD, just

Given Traveller sensors, this isnt much of an advantage. Combat ranges in
Traveller goes out to about 5 light seconds absolute tops, and
military-grade sensors see a lot further than that. Essentially, sneaking
up on people is damn difficult - you need to run power plants to maneuver
and accelerate, and that creates signature.

>Passive sensors seem the more powerful in Traveller.

This maneuvering problem is common to most everything. Usually, a ship in
combat will accelerate with one gee and use anything left over for evasion.
Fighters are usually built with 4 gees or more acceleration (with no
evasion, combat ranges go out to sensor ranges, which are loooooong).

Personally, I think fighters could easily spin-fire-spin-evade. Most
Traveller space weapons fire about once every 10-20 seconds, so there is
plenty of time to re-orient yourself during the cool-down period.

Imperium Games never really had the concept of proofreading. Errata is

well worth buying, if you\'re a gearhead.

This is a game fudge to stop the Infamous Near-C Rock (get asteroid in
outsystem. Attach t-plates. Accelerate to large fraction of C. Crash into
enemy planet). Thruster plates also violate a couple of other things, such
as the law of consevation of mass/energy.

I think dogs and canines would be seen more as the Vargr equivalent of
primates (pre-Proto-Vargr).  Are there people (outside of some animal rights

Are you Eliminating or Capturing? If the latter, figure several months or

Umm...gold *was* (and still is) used.  There was enough of it, and
other precious minerals, in some of the older systems to have made
"mining" them before (and in some cases after) being sent to the junk
yard economically viable.  

In today\'s computers, lots of substitutes are used instead, and the
amount of any precious mineral in the system is lower, partly due to
substitution, partly (mostly) due to miniaturization.  I don\'t think
mining your system boards is economic anymore. ;->

It is well documented that slavery is illegal in the Imperium.  It all depends
on how pervasive the Imperium is in YTU.  In the OTU, the MoJ and IN will
definately stop overt slave-ships and such but I would say the "gray" areas
you\'re talking about are not slavery.  Definately exploitation and despicable
behavior, but not slavery.

Now that is just plain ridiculous.  Especially the analogy, though it is

The Imperium *does* enforce it...at least in the OTU.  YTUMV.

Hee! Hee! ;-p

Are we, Referee, sure Margaret allowed (I\'ve heard it said she did
more than *allow*) slavery, or are these more in the line of rumors?  

The impression I got, from what little Rebellion material I have, is
that there was a lot of propaganda being tossed about by all sides.
Accusing Margaret of slavery, given her background and area of space,
would certainly have been effective propaganda even if it wasn\'t
really true.

OTOH, they have the very nasty _disadvantage_ of generating
quantities of a colorless, odorless gas that bonds _very_ well
with hemoglobin - and never lets go.  Death by carbon monoxide
poisoning is _not_ a recommended recreational activity.

My direct knowledge of law is limited to military justice, but according to
the Manual for Courts Martial, these elements are not strictly speaking
matters in mitigation. To paraphrase:

1.  Defense - elements showing that you did not commit a specific crime, or
that your actions did not constitute a crime.
2.  Extenuation - elements showing that while you did commit a crime, it
was not as serious as it could be.
3.  Mitigation - elements showing that while you did commit a crime and it
was serious, you should not be punished as severely as possible.

Some of these could be defenses, depending on the legal system ("Ignorance
of the Law is no Excuse.").  Most of them would be matters in extenuation,
rather than mitigation.

Intention, as you have defined it, would be an aggravating rather than a
mitigating factor.  Lack of intent is a defense in some crimes, however.

Respectfully,

Yes, but they will not have det-nuke lasers unless they\'re Naval players or
pirates. Nuke use is prohibited by the Imperial rules of war.

Bruce has a point.  In Traveller the ship is often home for the crew,
and hotel for the passengers.  As such, there are going to be "all the
conveniences of home" aboard, and shielding requirements similar to
any home shielding requirements. 

For my games, I postulated that gravitic technology produces fields
that play "merry heck" with electronics anyway.  This means all
electronics rated to work around gravitic devices are bigger, heavier,
slower, more expensive.  

Few planets are willing to forgo the use of grav tech. So when it is
discovered, electronic devices stop shrinking and start getting larger
and heavier. 

That\'s my handwave anyway.

A Midu Agashaam-class Destroyer is one of the staples of the

& 6xSCs.  Under BL it can take a total of 235 Hits (a third of which is
the purification plant).  Yet a single det-laser missile can now hit 5D6
times, each strike inflicting DV-72 or 3 Hits.  That comes out to 15-90
Hits total.  Considering that the PP can only take 33H, this is could be
enough for a mission kill.  
	Since T4\'s technology comes from FF&S2, itself an extension of
Brilliant Lances, this should hold true for later versions of the game as
well. 

	Ultimately whether or not to use this rule is a matter of taste.  
What do people think?

*************
My personal opinion (having served on a Frigate myself) is that this is
fairly accurate and a good theroy.  I know if a missile ever got through
our defences, we were gonna be out of the battle (probably 3000\' below the
ocean surface too).  With the technology we have currently today, It\'s hard
to get a missle hit on one of our warships.  If you got hit by a missile
though, 3/4ths of your crew will be doing damage control while the other
1/4th is dead.  Even more so in space with decompression and all..  It\'d be
easy to cut out a fire (vaccuum the room) but if there\'s still personal in
there, moral\'d hit a new low if you did that.  I\'m not a physics major or
anything yet, but the theroy of more volume taking more of a hit seems that
it\'d hold up to me also..  You\'d be insane to enter combat without some
form of Antimissile defences.  Sandcasters, laser batteries, etc.  
Just my thoughts.

The part about the Imperium not being similar to any historical state was
intended to steer the discussion towards issues about wether ths or that
epoch/state etc that historically fit the Imperium good enough to be used
as a model. History may repeat itself but as the Imperium was created by
Marc W et al (remember) it may not necessarily fit any real government.

Beside the fact(?) that the Imperium DOES NOT RESEMBLE THE US (no yanks in
space please) what historical state etc does it resemble, the Hansa states?

Yeah, you\'re right - thanks for pointing it out. "Fraudulent sophontism" is
a cool term btw. I don\'t think the Imperium require nonsophont to uphold
the law themselves but France actually held cases where rats etc where
charged with this and that, they were even given a lwayer to defend
themselves properly.

What, don\'t you all have everything ever printed for Traveller ;-)
The line about "fairly well established" came from the fact that it is
mentioned in several different publications from Digest Group as well as (I
think) Robots.

I would expect that in most societies, lot\'s of people
get into regular contact with lot\'s of computers...

Moreover, there are a good number of people
living in their starship\'s (incl. nomads) , space stations,
and hostile environment complexes.  Places where you can\'t
use space to protect you  from harmful radiation, so

One tidbit from the Traveller Library...

Soegz, Admiral
Admiral Soegz was a loyal supporter of Arbellatra in the final years of the
Civil War. He was elevated to Archduke of Antares by her decree, which
incidentally and simultaneously ordered the execution of the previous
archduke for the treason of not supporting her.

(FYI: The Archduke of Antares in 1115 IM. is Archduke Brzk, the
eight-generation
grandson of the Admiral Soegz, a vargr in the service of the Imperium.)

Question: The K\'kree are a very conservative race, even more conservative
than the Vilani.  How on earth did they discover space flight? Why?
And why did they start expanding to the stars?

Also, if the K\'kree hate carnivores so much, why haven\'t they
attacked the Imperium?  Sheer distance?

newspaper of a man sentencd to life in prison w/o parole for shoplifting
panties.  It was under the 3 strikes law in FL; he was a twice-convicted
felon.  Because the man had a penknife IN HIS POCKET at the time he was
apprehended, Robbery w/ a deadly weapon.  The employees of the store confirmed
the man never brandished or threatened to brandish the knife (blade was 4"

Obviously the letter of the law...but the spirit?  Could this happen in the

I think that if humans wandered out in space and encountered an alien race
that curiously held Orangoutangs as pets on a leash and that these pets
were more or less everywhere. Not only were they extremely common, that had
also been breed to look like [CENSORED] (think about how ridicelous some
dog breeds look compared to the wolfs they descend from end you get my
meaning).

For the Vargr, that at least had to be their largest scientific puzzle ever
and remember that the Vargr today (1998) have interstellar empires of their
own while we Solomani cannot even get out of our balkanized state on our
homeplanet.

I believe there are limitied numbers of materials that can bond/attach properly
to silicon and be used as direct connections on the chip itself. (Wasn\'t it
a big deal recently when a new process was annouced that would let (copper?)
be used?) 

Also, in a integrated-circuit world (as opposed to the bulky macroelectronics
Heinlein visualized), resitance of the wires isn\'t a crucial factor for
many applications relative to the performance/resitance/speed of the 
semiconductor parts involved. Only very small amounts of electricity have
to get shipped around; controlling the capacitance of the wires involved
is more important (and easier) than controlling the resistance. I suspect
that (since gold is softer than copper) gold wires would be harder to 
make in low-capacitance configurations than copper.

I am leaning towards that she actually did allow slavery as she married
that asshole Tukera (proof of bad taste) and that she supposedly was
pregnat with Strephons child with a little help from her genedoctors and a
stolen bloodsample of the former Emperor.

Be that as it may

The targeting systems need to be a little more sophisticated than that - 
decent-sized PEMS would be medium-large telescopes at good sites. Since 
thermal sensitivity is low from a planets surface, they would have to be
fairly large to detect targets at fire-control levels from reflected
sunlight. 

That adds an interesting characteristic for strike cruisers: contrary to
what you might think, they\'d actually be designed to be very stealthy,
in particular with Mil Ultrablack hulls, so that only large (easy-to-attack)
ground-based sensors can see them. 

I was also thinking (in reference to meson guns) of the concept of trying
to triangulate in on the meson gun by tracing back secondary emissions 
along its beam or as it strikes a meson screen. 

One could also look for the meson gun\'s grav pointing mechanism through
grav sensors, and its fusion plant (if it has one) through neutrino sensors,
and secondary emission as it fires through neutrino sensors, though both
would probably require being on the surface of the planet. (I should add
looking-for-meson-gun to my sensor rules and tweak it so that what you need
to do is get a sensor within a few tens of km - so that the Marines and/or
recon fighters have something to do.)

<Grumble! Grumble!>

Ok, I\'m probably missing some piece of C@#$@n somewhere, but AFAIK,
the way det lasers are projected to work doesn\'t allow real aiming,
nor deploying, nor cones of attack.  They just shotgun space with
beams and count on numbers and luck to hit their targets.

As I understand the theory, a number of very thin rods are arranged in
a sphere around a nuclear device.  The rods extend out from near the
center of the sphere toward the surface, and as I understood it there
is a specific geometry into which they can be arranged.  

When the nuclear device detonates a portion of the energy goes into
all the rods and they destructively lase in the microsecond before
they are consumed by the nuclear explosion.  The laser beams project
from the device in all directions out from the sphere.  It should be
possible to only implant the rods into part of the sphere producing a
cone, or hemispheric effect, but I seriously doubt your device would
employ maneuvering rods in an effort to aim them toward some target.  

As for how many rods, I don\'t think anyone *knows* that, but I\'d guess
the number is in the hundreds, not the thousands.

Additionally, and IMO, a det laser should have a random chance of
hitting *any* target in range, not just a specified target.  Of
course, targets occupying a larger arc of fire (closer and/or larger
targets) should have a greater chance of being hit, and/or hit more
times.

IIRC, det lasers have a 1 hex short range (30,000), so I suggest
something simplistic like...

 tons              Dice
 ===================================
 >100              +1d6
 100-999           +2d6
 1,000-9,999       +3d6
 10,000-99,999     +4d6
 100,000-999,999   +5d6
 <1,000,000        +6d6
 
 range     hexes   Dice
 ===================================
 same hex    0     +1d6
 short       1     -0d6
 medium      2     -1d6
 long       3-4    -2d6
 very long  5-8    -4d6
 extreme    9-16   -8d6
 
Example:  A det laser fires, and 5 ships are potentially in range, so
all five *might* be hit multiple times...

Target 1: 3,000 ton Midu in same hex:   
                +3d6+1d6 = (4 to 24 hits)  [7 hits]

Target 2:  60 ton Sprint fighter at short range:  
                +1d6-0d6 = (1 to 6 hits)   [4 hits]
                
Target 3: 57,000 ton Hume cruiser at medium range:
                +4d6-1d6 = (0 to 23 hits)  [13 hits]
                
Target 4: 300,000 ton Tigeress at long range:
                +5d6-2d6 = (0 to 28 hits)  [9 hits]

Target 5: 100,000 ton Plankwell at extreme range:
                +5d6-8d6 = (0 to 22 hits)  [0 hits]
                
If you let the det laser device get within short range of your
battlewagons they can do lots of damage, but if you defend in depth
and force the enemy to "detonate them or lose them" at longer ranges
they won\'t bother your big ships...but they\'ll EAT UP the screen out
front.

Doing det lasers this way also allows for the possibility that the
delivery device (ship, boat, fighter, deploying missile) is also in
range of the detonation and takes collateral damage.

No, of course not.

A player of mine recently purchased a classical BFG type device; A "Plasma
Grenade Launcher".  Really its just a pump action, CPR projectile launcher,
the projectile happens to be a fair sized HEAP grenade that uses a fusion
reaction to create a jet of plasma energy that leaks a lot in other
directions.  All told, its not as efficient or effective as a grenade
launcher (but a bit safer at close range).

It was marketed to the guy as a "poor man\'s plasma gun".  It\'s hideously
heavy (the grenades are 20mm x 50mm, and heavy) has a five round magazine,
you have to *pump* it to reload, and it has a nasty recoil (there are no
compensators).

In combat last night he was afraid to use it since there was a hostage
somewhere in the big house they were assaulting.  He ended up using a 9mm
autopistol for all the \'wetwork\'.  The primary function of his "poor man\'s
plasma gun" is intimidation value.

I am always amazed, though, when people propose expensive solutions where
cheap ones will do so well...when referring to deployed Impie (or U.S.)
military equipment.  Remember, military contracts go to the lowest bidder.

This from distant memory of a ca. 1982-4 Av Week and Space Technology
article on the subject. (I\'m sure of the date, because that\'s when I had
a roomie who got that magazine. A search through those three years of
issues should find it. Also \'smart pebbles\' and other such things were
discussed at that time, as well as down firing antitank submunitions..)

But the original proposal was to have something like a dozen or so rods,
that were targettable, theory being that they couls hit several missiles
at once. A bunch of them aiming at the same flights of missiles would
probably get them.

Yes, as bus card contacts and traces on some circuitboards...I mean the

Distance, lack of significant contact. Also, they expand extremely
slowly in any case, and they\'re still trying to figure out how the
Hivers did that horrific thing that they did to them, and probably
wondering if the Imperium can do it too, since the Imperium has had
greater contact with the Hivers than the K\'Kree.

Also, though they\'re militant in their vegetarianism, they\'re not
dumb...the 3I is a big, nasty, heavily armed cactus pad to chew for the
Thousand Worlds. They probably realize they can\'t win.

The biggest problem is the brain. I make this too dumb, Company HQ

more on the brain than we\'d spend on an APC. The first is only a

that would respond to simple command sets from it\'s squad, like
"Follow with Pattern 12" (referring to a pre-planned shadowing procedure)
"Orient Mark 23, Target Movement, Fire!" (fire on whatever moves thataway)
...simple, pre-programmed tactics that the squad leader and assistant
squad leader (or a designated drone operator) would be trained to use
with the Drones.

To keep these cheap, I\'d plan on making them pretty limited - optimized
to carry one heavy weapon and shoot it where the Sergeant tells them

Yes, it\'s allowing much faster computers, using less power. Both Moto
and IBM are real close to, if not IN production with these devices.

Not quite...this resistance is exactly why they were so thrilled to
figure out how to use copper instead of aluminum. The problem with
copper is that the Cu atoms \'leaked\' and poisoned the semiconductor
parts. I think they have manufacture and seal the chip in a anaerobic
atmosphere as oxygen is a big part of the problem.

The heat that an ic chip generates is due to resistive heating; the
faster the chip runs, the more heat it generates, even at lower
voltages. If you can reduce the resistance of the ship, you can crank up
the speed.

Actually, the exact opposite is true. Softer metals are easier to draw
wires from. Gold has astonishing ductility, which is why you can, for
instance, make gold leaf, which you can\'t iirc, from any other metal, at
least not easily.

This is a very, Very, VERY difficult question you propose.  In fact, it 
has puzzled the Imperial Scientific Community (ISC) for hundreds of 
years.  How could they [the K\'kree] discover something on a world in 
another system, without already possessing similar capability.  The ISC 
have been postulating that the sensor ranges of the K\'kree are highly 
advanced, beyond anything that the 3I has been able to field, or even 
hypothesize.  

The Tech Level of the K\'kree sensor industry must therefore be 
incredible.  This also would explain why all expeditions into K\'kree 
space have always been met by overwhelming force....  ;->

These are a lot of fun... and if you thought missiles moving at a few
hundred Gs of accel are impressive...

Wait\'ll you get a load of some of the things the Imperial ships 
can do in this series...

He\'s done some other stuff as well, based in the <mindblank... TFG\'s other

he\'s done some fantasy as well, IIRC.

Be that as it may, I still think that at Traveller ranges a more
shotgun approach, with *perhaps* a little rudimentary aiming, would
work better.
 
And even if it doesn\'t...I like my approach from a gaming standpoint.
The number of dice might need to adjusting, but I like the approach,
and it would be for one of MTU\'s anyway.

I have a mercenary company in a current campaign (NPCs) who brought with
them a similar devie, but it was only for Recon (well...see below).  The
players liked it too.  Here\'s the stats from CT\'s Robots (using Andy
Akins\'s Robot Spreadsheet for design).

Drone Probe
Designed by Hyrshal Mechner, produced by Ling Standard Products.

Monitoring Probe      3320F-04-3B000-9F31   Cr217,650   122 kg
	Fuel=1.9    Duration= 0.5    TL=15    Thrust=400kg

	electronic circuit protection

A 50 Liter Sphere that zips about at around 2.3 G, quite dumb (mostly human
controlled and monitored...or from a ship\'s computer).  At 200kcr, only
marginally expendable.

The brain, such as it is, is only 6400.  It\'s the Grav that costs so much;
180,000 credits!  With 4 legs instead of Grav, this item costs only 45k or
so, now *that\'s* expendable.  Unfortunately, that\'s not very manuverable or
versatile.  ACV and heavier grav take too much space.

The original design was for a security robot that patrolled a given area
and reported any anomolies.  The light tentacles could theoretically hold a
pistol-like weapon, but it was not designed to be armed - shooting things
is something humans do.  In fact, the brain isn\'t big enough to have
firearms skill.

At 2.3 G, however, this device can do some serious damage to a human if it
can run up a bit.  Of course, with no real armor, an NPC filled it with 9mm
rounds and took it out pretty easy last night.

A ramped up version, with armor and weapons, would probably need to be
pretty big, perhaps based on a grav bike chassis.  at 50 liters I was
having a lot of trouble getting a viable design.  Any real brain capability
starts adding up pretty fast too.  Here\'s one swipe;

	Navigator-2, Grav Vehicle-4
	Communications-1
	Forward Observer-3, Tactics-2
	Recon-3
	Weapon Handling-2
	Security-1, Infantry Ground Combat-2, Armor Ground Combat-2

This Robot has a real brain, travels at just shy of 3G (Shouldn\'t there be
avionics in these things?) has a passel of skills, can operate
autonomously, has a full blown sensor package, and a nasty weapon package
(I would have added externally mounted tac missiles if possible).  This
design is 150 liters.

Of course, at Mcr.3 you can almost buy a tank for the same price.

The main cost items are 1.1 Mcr for the Grav, and 1.6 Mcr for the brain.

With a little fiddling I found I can fit the same stuff in a 350 liter
chassis with "Heavy" grav units and save about a Mcr.  Those "light" grav
modules are sure expensive.

If you are inclined to look at my humble calculations and reasoning,
please do so.  I am working toward a Unified Theory of Imperial
Economics, to help explain MTU.  I came up with some numbers that
surprised me, but then again, a lot of this is wild guesswork.

Summary: 

   1. A _military_ per-person income tax of 2.5% (or so) works just 
      fine for supporting the Imperial military.

   2. Interstellar trade is small potatoes compared to in-system industry.

   3. Interstellar piracy is therefore rare, but also does not
      receive much attention, since most of the money doesn\'t leave
      the major systems.

An Exhaustive Rush through Imperial Economics (in under 200 lines)

The economic strength of the entire Imperium, and therefore of its
members, can be approximated IMTU by looking at military strength,
interstellar traffic, and system industry.  Moreover, the derived
numbers can also shed some light on Imperial policies, including system
patrols and taxes... and maybe piracy.

Military Strength

The first hurdle to clear is military strength. We\'re given
outlines of what the battleship elements of fleets look like, and from
there we must approximate costs for assault groups, support ships,
depots, and patrol ship squadrons (why not?)

A depot is like a starport big enough to handle an entire fleet: that
is, about 1 billion tons of repair and fuel at any one time.  Here\'s
a starport large enough to be a depot:

   Downport components:

FLEET MILITARY STRENGTH

Note:
I\'ll round numbers off in most cases.

   Battle Element:   942 ships,  760 mT,   TCr  380 ( BCr500 per mT )
   Assault Groups:   100 ships,  500 kT,   BCr  100 ( BCr200 per mT )
   Support Ships :   500 ships,  200 mT,   TCr   20 ( BCr100 per mT )
   Patrol Ships  :   100 ships,   50 kT,   BCr   50 ( TCr1   per mT )
   ----
   Subtotal      :  1642 ships,  960 mT,   TCr  400 ( BCr400 per mT )
   x 20 fleets   : 32840 ships, 19.2 bT,   TCr 8000
   + 5 depots    :                         TCr 4000
   ----
   Total                                   TCr12000

Maintenance is 2% of the value of the equipment per year:     TCr 240
Payments on this equipment (which includes mothballed
reserves, decommissioning, upgrades, and new orders) is
4% equipment value per year:                                  TCr 480

Interstellar Traffic

This involves approximating all possible trade between all possible
worlds in the Imperium.  This workspace can be trimmed by only considering
trade between neighbor worlds and important worlds; however, the task
remains daunting.  With less hard data, assumptions here are dangerous;
on the other hand, freedom to make up numbers means the referee may
tailor the results to fit YTU.

Average pair of Imperial worlds:
   Starport B, Population 8, TL 13, X-Boat Route or Base or Gas Giant
   Starport C, Population 7, TL 11, Gas Giant
   Average trade indices = 8 and 5
   Average distance from neighbor world = 1 parsec.
   So, traffic between average worlds (indices 7 and 4) is:
        1620 passengers per week,    6480 tons of freight per week.
        x 52 weeks per year          x 52
    ----
      84,240 passengers per year, 336,960 tons of freight per year.
      x KCr6 per passenger         x KCr1 per ton,
    ----
      MCr505 per year     +        MCr337 per year = MCr 842 per world per year

By the way, it looks like starports of this size will overhaul
the equivalent of one 1000-ton ship per week.  If the price of
such an overhaul is, say, MCr0.2, then this boosts yearly revenue
by MCr10, to MCr 852.
                                                     MCr 852 per world per yr.
                                                    x 11,000 worlds
                                                  ----
                                                     TCr 9.4 per year

Starport Costs

Starports cost money to build and maintain.  Since the best way to
buy a starport is to finance it, I assume banks look at starports
like big non-mobile spaceships: about 4% of its cost per year in
payments and maintenance, salaries, etc.

   Average Interstellar Starport:
   Ships arriving (landing) per week: 64 (50)
   Tonnage: 30000 (16800) per week
   Passengers: 1620 (734) per week (etc)

   08 (00)    x 1400td 800 passengers
   020 (018)  x  600td 600 passengers
   016 (014)  x  300td 160 passengers
   020 (018)  x  100td 60 passengers

   Downport components:
   Airstrips:         1 (MCr 0.01)
   Shuttles:          1
   Parkbays:          5 (MCr .5)
   Fuel:           5000 (MCr 50)
   Repair:           50 (MCr 5)
   Build:          5000 (MCr 500)
   Admin, mtc, tower cost: BCr 2.82
   Groundport total cost:  BCr 4.7

   Orbital components:
   Shuttle ports:              1 (MCr 10)
   Berth capacity(td):      1320 (MCr 1320)
   Fuel(td):                3300 (MCr 330)
   Repair(td/year):        13200 (MCr 1320)
   Build(td/year):          1320 (MCr 1320)
   Admin, mtc, tower cost: BCr 6.46
   Orbital total cost:     BCr 10.76
   ----
   Total Cost:             BCr 16

The average starport, then, costs 16 billion credits.  The yearly
expenses would work out to MCr 640.  For 11,000 worlds, then, the
yearly cost is perhaps around TCr7.

System Industry

This is approximated by calculating the average world profile and
figuring out the GWP.  This has already been done, but I\'ll do it
here with wild generalizations just for fun.  I\'ll use the Pocket
Empires economic model to calculate currency value and validate
my GWP estimates for the world types I chose.

Average Imperial worlds:
   Starport B, Population 8, TL13: RU = 16;  currency value = 75%
      GWP = 500,000,000 x Cr10,000 x 0.75
          = TCrImp 3.75
   Starport C, Population 7, TL11: RU = 1.4; currency value = 63%
      GWP = 50,000,000 x Cr10,000 x 0.63
          = BCr 315
   Average GWP  =      TCr2 per world per year
                x    11,000 worlds
                ----
   Imperial GWP = TCr22,000 per year

Conclusions

For equipment alone, the military alone needs TCr480 per year from the
Imperial coffers.  This represents a per-person income tax of about
2.5%.  This is a very comfortable and familiar number, and I think it
is in the range proposed before.  In comparison, interstellar traffic
is small potatoes, and the revenue generated is probably around 30%
greater than the cost of maintaining the starports.

This supports the idea that Naval bases can easily double the size of
a starport.  Moreover, it seems that since interstellar trade is so
small a percentage of the GWP of the Imperium, there is more effort to
patrol the world surfaces themselves than patrol space, and thus in
frontier sectors piracy may well thrive.

These terms are pretty fuzzy even in the Real World. (Remember the 
Great Frigate Reclassification in which the USN suddenly discovered that 
half the ships it had been calling "Frigates" were really cruisers?)
In current USN useage, a "frigate" is a smaller, slightly slower, ship
optimized for escort duty (especially escort of transports/convoys),
with mostly ant-submarine equipment. A "destroyer" is a larger and 
faster vessel capable of keeping up with the carrier battle groups, still
optimized for escort (either ASW or anti-air.) A "cruiser" is an even bigger
or more capable escort vessel. (Of course, anomalies occur; the 
Ticonderoga-class Aegis "cruisers" are built on almost exactly the same 
hull as the Spruance-class "destroyers".) 

In the Imperial Navy, a "destroyer" seems to be a 1000-5000 ton vessel
optimized for general-purpose combat against other light vessels. "Escort"
can mean either a much smaller patrol ship (the Gazelle) or a slightly 
larger warship intended to protect fleet elements from small ships and
fighters (the P.F. Sloan). In my mind the difference between an 
"Fleet Escort" and a "Destroyer" is that the Destroyers (like the Midu)
are designed to operate independtly if necessary. 

The Imperial Navy doesn\'t seem to use "Frigate".

I don\'t know of any that currently exist (but that means very
little)...however, I am currently working on some code that does just this.
I have no timetable for its release, since real life (job, wife, son) often
interferes with the coding :)

If you want to learn more about the project in general, and it\'s current

I was thinking of things like ultra-high-speed semi-rigid cables, which

H2 with lots of other gases as impurities, right?

So, OK, let\'s assume you fill your tank with water, and run your

vent the O2, and put the H2 right back in the same tank.  You have to
keep doing this until there\'s nothing but pure H2 left in your tank,
then I suppose you liquify it.  And you are supposed to end up with a
full tank of LH2, sufficient for your jump drive.  Huh?

Or you start with a tank full of (presurized, I suppose) GG scoopings. 
Now you\'re supposed to separate the good H2 from the bad impurities,
vent the impurities, liquify the H2, and again end up with a tank full

Keep in mind also that they ran into the Hivers over a world of sentient carnivores.  The K\'kree were in the process of gearing up to wipe \'em out, the Hivers were going to uplift them into the Hiver Confed.  War broke out, which ended when the K\'kree found out what the Hivers had in mind for uplifting *THEM*.

Personally, I\'d *LOVE* to see the documents on *that* plan.

OK, I\'m gonna ignore the smiley mode.  The original flights were to the moon 
of the K\'kree homeworld, when they somehow or other determined that there were 
intelligent carnivores on that moon that could concievably be a threat to 
them.  So they developed spaceflight to take them out.

Heh.

Different people have different takes on it, but IMTU the ship can\'t
"load and scoot," purifying on the way.  It has to stick around the GG
or sit on the water while the purification process takes place.  Oh
and the tanks are compartmentalized, so you can fill them small
portions at a time, that helps.

For water refueling, your ship sits there running the water through
the Unit, storing the H2 and venting the O2, for the number of hours
it takes to fill your tanks with hydroden.  It can dip and go
elsewhere to refine, but it would have to make several dips if it
does. That\'s an ineffeicent way to do it.

For GG refueling, you ship either makes a number of fast
(hypersonic) passes, slow (subsonic) passes, or loiters in the upper
atmosphere (trey dangerous) collecting unrefined gas.  Generally,
the ship refines it\'s load, extracting and filling a few fuel
compartments, venting the rest.  Then it makes another pass,
followed by refining, followed by...etc.  Doing it this way, you run
into diminishing returns as the tanks begin to fill with refined
fuel and each pass returns less and less refined fuel.

That\'s why IMTU the slow pass/loiter method is preferred.  With the
slow pass/loiter the ship refines as it goes through the atmosphere.

Of course, I can name you three or four folks on the list that
scream bloody murder at the very idea of loitering in the atmosphere
of a GG.  ;->

process of fuel scooping, either from a GG or from H2O is a slow process.
IMTU a ship spends as much time in atmosphere, or resting on a lake, river
etc. as it takes to purify the fuel. As the fuel is scooped, it runs through
various catalytic purifiers that seperate the elements, discarding the
unused material (some oxygen is syphoned off to life support), the processed
hydrogen is compressed and saved to fuel tankage.

This can be done in stages by "dipping" into a GG atmosphere, scooping and
processing as you go. In this method a number of such trips must be made
until the total time in atmosphere equals the process time. On the other
hand a ship can ride in atmosphere of CG and "troll" for a time period equal
to the processing time.

Trolling for fuel has become a minor tourist attraction with some of the
higher class passenger/luxury liners.

Draw backs include the lack of manuverability while "trolling" that leave
ships open to attack.

Again, this is just how I do it IMTU, by no means a canon opinion.

There is a big rift in the way.  They one route around is
blocked by the Hivers (who they tried to take over and
failed).  The other way is through the Vargr Extents.
Presumably the only reason they haven\'t attacked the Vargr
is that there is only one J-4 route there.

This analysis is really cool stuff, but it has the problem that it is
working with the existing Traveller trade rules, which are solely designed
to deal with itinerant free traders.

When you either scale them up (\'I want to buy 2 million tons of B12 Hi Ind,
take them 2 jump 3s and sell them for gazillions profit\') or scale them
down (\'What the heck is B12 Hi Ind, seeing as it costs Cr 300 per cubic
meter ? And how many FGMP-12s can you fit into a displacement ton, anyway
?\'), they break. Badly.

Scaling them up runs into diminishing returns - you mightnt have a problem
picking up 400 tons or so of ore once from a pop-5000 Belter colony, but if
you want 2 000 tons a week, then they are probably going to try and charge
more.

There is also the efficiency increase gained from regularily scheduled
routes - people will be more inclined to sell offworld when they know that
a ship will turn up every week, give or take a day.

There might be a solution hiding in the PE rules - take the GWP increase
from Finished Goods Trade as being the Interstellar Traded Goods sector.

This means an A starport world would have a traded sector of about 40% of
the economy, which is a bit much. B and C starports are more reasonable, at
about 33% and about 12%. These numbers strike me as being too high.
Personally, I think the numbers should be 10% traded for A, 5% traded for B
and 2% traded for C starport worlds.

The other solution is my previous approach under GUTTT, which essentially
proposed for every Cr 1000 profit you could make under the vanilla Trade
rules, 1% of GDP would be dedicated to that. It then added some
higher-value goods, and a super-value luxury goods, and tried to compensate
for current-account deficits (lo-tech worlds run chronic trade deficits
under the vanilla Traveller trade rules).

Of course, this assumed we could make a map of all viable trade routes in
the Imperium, which an insane amount of work.

    'body' => 'The way I see it, there are two seperate driving forces behind interstellar
trade.

The first one is specialisiation and exchange. Imagine a good that has
economies of scale in production, but a world only needs 10 of them in a
year. Imagine it\'s a displacement ton big and very expensive (a
megacredit), and that for every 10 you make you get a 1% volume discount.

If ten worlds each build their own, then they all get a 1% discount, so
they cost KCr 990 each. But if one world builds all 100 for the ten worlds,
then it gets a 10% discount, and can thus build them for KCr 900. Therefore
it could sell them to the other worlds for KCr 955 each, spend KCr 20
shipping them and still make a profit of KCr 35 each. Assuming that the
other worlds have something they can sell back to this world, everybody
profits.

The second one is the desire for luxury goods from far away. I\'ll use a
real world example. In Sydney, there is a beer, Sheaf Stout, drunk by 60
year old alcoholics, and me. It\'s so low on the social scale of beers most
pubs dont serve it (they serve Guinness or Coopers Stout, if they serve a
stout). In San Francisco, according to Charles Haynes, a yuppie acquantance
of mine, the yuppie bars serve this very very expensive Australian boutique
beer. Sheaf Stout.

Now, when you are dealing with luxury goods, you can fit a lot into 14
cubic meters. If you assume a fair amount of disposable income, a lot of
people are going to have 10 credits a month for something special. And a
fair chunk of that money, if people are so inclined, will go to luxuries
from other worlds (10 credits a liter turns into a very chunky Cr 140 000 a
displacement ton).

The standard trade system deals well with specialisation and exchnage type
trade. As far as I can see it, the drivers for the second sort of trade a
very different - essentially we could tie it to a worlds\'s culture and
disposable income, and it is almost completely unrelated to technology. A
world that is full of people who like new and different experiences is
probably going to be a better bet for selling luxury goods to than some
cheerless stronghold of Industrial Puritanism. Although the second world
might be a really, really good place to buy
fashionable-if-appallingly-retro clothing for export back to world one.

Income distributions should affect things as well - a world where the many
are poor and the few are rich is going to be better for very high value
luxuries, while a world with a prosperous working class is going to have a
mass market in low-value luxuries.

Finally, dont discount the Veteren\'s Market. 20 year veterens get paid
Imperial Pensions in Imperial Credits, so if these people retire back to
their dirtball homeworlds in the boondocks, then they are going to provide
a small but viable market for offworld luxuries.

This sounds a lot like the "Heavy Weapons Platforms" (robot tanks, both
conventional and gravitic) found in the X-COM computer games.  Each is
maybe the size of a golf cart and equipped with a brain that can follow 
simple commands (in the game, you control them just like your other
soldiers).

For a story treatment showing how these tanks are supposed to work, see
Russ Brown\'s X-COM SAGA or the sequel by Larry Mann, both accessible on

The problem I have with this is that you\'d have to be a completely inept MORON to NOT figure out a
way to skirt the Imperial Slavery Laws.
1. Ship slaves in low births.  There\'s nobody to question if the Navy pulls you over for speeding.
2. Don\'t call it Buying/Selling slaves, simply call it passage and recruiting fees.
3. Force all "recruits" to sign trainee contracts whereby they are learning a trade and have their
food and lodging supplied by the "employer"
4. Control the life of trainees so they don\'t complain by some means. Addiction to a drug.
Restriction to pressurized locations on vacuum planets.  Give them a disease that need regular
treatments.  "Training Collars".  Brain washing.  Hold family hostage. The list goes on and on...

Now I\'m sure it looks nice on the books to SAY that Slavery is illegal in the Imperium. But anybody
smart enough to run a ship should be smart enough to skirt the issue.  That makes it nigh
impossible for the Imperium to LEGALLY bust a slavery ring. Sure, they COULD drop out of the sky
and bust up a suspected ring, but it wouldn\'t hold up in court.  And if the law was written in such
a way that it would stick, it would also cover ALL of those exploitation cases.  Which is bad for
business.  What\'s bad for business is bad for taxes.  What\'s bad for taxes is bad for the
Imperium.  What\'s bad for the Imperium tends to be ignored by those in power to such an extent that
it is no longer bad... etc. etc.

I\'ve heard that 10,000 Cr is the average annual wage for an Imperial citizen.  I would venture to
say that it costs more than that to support a person on anything but lush world.  Thus slaves would
be better off than free men.  At least they know where their next meal is coming from.

  I\'m considering a campaign where ships can\'t just point their nose at a far
star and blast off; rather jump routes require extensive mapping. Most would
be accomplished by the ISSC, adding significantly to their importance, and
then made available for computer download (a modest fee for all currently
known subsector routes, paid once by a starship for each subsector it visits).
MegaCorps might also maintain privately charted routes as trade secrets (maybe
a Jump-3 which cuts several Jump-1\'s off a main) as might those pesky pirates
keep secret the jump route to their hidden base.
   The obvious hook to this is that discovering/pioneering a new route would
be very lucretive (sell it to a MegaCorp or receive some standing reward from
the ISSC) Of course, it would also be very hazardous with a high risk of
misjump or simply disappearing into jump space never to be seen again. You
might also run afoul the MegaCorp or pirate willing to spend a missile on you
rather than lose their exclusive on the route.
   My thoughts are to set up a formula for both the odds of success and the
value of a new route. For the first, negative modifiers might be jump length
or time since your last overhaul. Positive modifiers could be pilot and nav
skills, pre-knowledge of the systems at either end, or equipment such as TNE
Exploration/Survey Electronics Package.
   On the value of the route, things such as trade factors, jump length,
planet viability, population, or tech level come to mind.

   So- has this already been done; i.e., where would I look for the info? Or
would anyone like to toss out some ideas?

Hey, Eris,

 Ok..  Starting from the top, you\'ve got carriers.  Those are self
explanatory.  Self defence weaps only + Fighters/Bombers.  
 Battleships come next.  They\'re the ones with the shipkiller/planetkiller
stuff.  Also they\'ve got some self defence stuff, but mostly rely on fig\'s
and DD\'s for that type of stuff.
 Cruisers would be next.  These have less armor, better
speed/maneuverability than a battleship, less weapontry but can still kill
some ships/groundtargets.  They\'ve got more selfdefence stuff than a
battleship but still rely on fig\'s and DD\'s.
 Destroyers are shipkillers and escorts.  They\'ve got enough weaps to kill
a ship but they are midrange between offensive/defensive weapontry.
Cheaper and easier to kill than a Cruiser but still very dangerous.
 Frigates (sometimes called escorts also) are there as torpedo stoppers.
They\'ve got the firepower to defend their convoy or battlegroup.  Self
defence weapontry at max.  A few ship/ground killer weapons maybe.
 Escort\'s don\'t exist in most navies because their role is the same as a
frigates and are pretty much the same cost.  Usually a little smaller and
less well armed.  I won\'t mention armor cause it\'s N/A.  In the US Navy
(wet) these\'ve been replaced by figs..

For that matter, does anyone have a military ship classification scheme
(types, duties, etc) that they would like to send me? I would be very
interested in seeing this.

 A normal battle group in the WetNavy would be a group centered around a
carrier or battleship, sometimes both for the big ones, at least 2
cruisers, 3 destroyers, and 4-8 frigates.  
 Also we dispatch cruiser groups, which is usually 1 cruiser, 1 destroyer,
and 2-4 frigates for smaller problems.
 and a patrol squadren usually is composed of 1 destroyer, and 2-4 frigates.
 Convoy\'s are usually escorted by patrol squads depending on the value and
size of the convoy.  other times they may be escorted by 1-2 frigates as
well.  

 Hope this helps.

The Imperium really isnt that hung up about laws. It is a government of
men, not a republic based on the rule of law. And if the Imperium doesnt
like slavery, then pissing them off by looking for fig leaves of legality
wont help when some IISS functionary shows up with an Imperial Warrant
requesting all local assistance to breaking the slave ring, and local laws
be damned.

Slavery is one of those threshold issues. The arguments you put were
covered in some detail in the UK in the 1860s, during the American
republic\'s slow and brutal surgery to remove the cancer of slavery from
itself.

The basic problem for the UK was that slavery in the cotton states was good
for Britain, becuase it kept the price of cotton down. Never the less, the
RN sat by while Freedom of Navigation was restricted by the USA\'s blockade
of the rebel slave states, because slavery was seen to be wrong.

I believe that the same attitude would be held in a civilised Imperium.

A human needs about 10 kilos of food a week, or 500 kg per year. This is
about 4% of a displacement ton (we will assume water is close to free. Much
food shipped thru interstellar space would be concentrated or dried, in the
same way orange juice is currently transported in concentrated form).

Assuming for a moment the prices in the Traveller trade system are vaguely
related to the reality of the Traveller universe, a dton of produce from an
Ag world will cost about KCr 6, plus call it KCr 4 transport costs (enough
to go 5 parsecs or so).

Therefore food should cost a maximum of about Cr 400 a year, plus profit
margins for distributors etc. Assume these profit margins are 200%.
Therefore, food should cost Cr 1200 a year for your average Imperial
citizen who lives entirely on food imported from 5 parsecs away.

You also have the problem that slaves tend to work badly, and as Agricola
etc documented, a slave who intends to do you damage through deniable
incompetance can cost you more than they could ever be worth.

Finally, it wasnt an accident that slavery essentially disappeared in
Christian Europe between the final fall of the Western Empire and the rise
of the Carolingians. It just isnt economically efficient.

Hee! Hee!

This is one area I don\'t think we\'re being all that heretical.  I
know "fast pass" is mentioned in FFS2, but nowhere (that I\'ve found,
and I\'m *not* looking) explicitly says you absolutely *can\'t* loiter
in a GG\'s atmosphere, and if you can loiter you can make a slow
pass.  

In fact, it\'s supposed to be a standard SDB tactic to hide in
GG atmospheres.  That looks like loitering to me.

The argument has been mainly about streamlining.  Whether the ship
has to be hypersonically streamlined to loiter in a GG\'s atmosphere
or not.

IIRC, CT mentioned someplace that a fuel skim on a GG took 8 hours.  
Considering that \'actual\' time for a pass would be on the order of maybe an 
hour and a half.  This suggests to me that it\'s actually a bunch of short 
passes followed by either refining in place or liquifying it if you don\'t have 
purification.

That\'s been around for ages, all the way back to CT.  I see this as orbitting 
inside the GG\'s atmosphere under power, down to about 4 or 5 atmospheres of 
pressure.

Yeah, I can see hypersonic streamlining to deal with GG atmospheres, since in order to fill your tanks, you have to go deep *and* have the speed to get back out.

Interesting comment and model - I\'m going to have to try them out.

My specialty is the Islands Clusters - only 27 worlds, effectively
isolated.  I *have* completely mapped the trade routes and the profits to
be gained from each.  I also figured out the total available shipping
tonnage (using TCS campaign rules and some admittedly debateable assumptions).

For clarity\'s sake, I will call a single-jump link between two worlds
(regardless of actual distance) a "leg", and a series of legs connecting
any two worlds a "route".  

Using a "gravity" model - tonnage shipped is proportional to GWP and
profitability, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance in
legs between source and market - I worked out the fraction of total tonnage
shipped between each source-market pair, then multiplied by total tonnage
and divided by twice the number of legs to get the tonnage shipped per
week, then multiplied again by Cr4000/dton to get the value shipped.

Turned out that the traded sector ranged from 0.01% to 3.1% of GWP, the
extreme values representing really low exchange rates (TL/starport
combination) and really low populations respectively.  The average was 0.5%.

This implies to me that my total tonnage figure must be low - the
shipbuilding limits in TCS must represent "docks suitable for construction
of military ships" rather than the total available, or my assumptions about
new construction versus annual maintenance or the lifetimes of ships must
be skewed.  I\'ve just started looking at alternatives.

Query: If you\'re deep enough in a Gas Giant that the atmosphere hides you from sensors, how do you know when to come out?  Obviously your sensors are screwed too, if
not scrubbed off entirely...

By the way, does anybody have a diagram of a Gas Giant detailing atmospheres at various altitudes and gravity at same?  Plus the comparison to the 10 and 100
diameter limits?

Please explain to my how a forward observer will spot and target a ship in

The targetting system would be sensor platforms in orbit; military satellites, 
sensor platforms on planetary moons, that kind of thing, linked together in a 
communications net and handled by a big computer like a Mod9/fib.  Your \'fwd 
obs\' tech would be doing realtime data relaying from the network to the 
gunners themselves.

I\'d hide comsats in the planetary ring system & on the planetary moons along 
with passive sensors, feeding the comsats.  The comsats would have to be tight 
beam boxes, but this is do-able.  I\'d also rig them for burst transmission.

Christopher points out a valid yet subtle distinction between mitigation
and other legal actors.

Generally, in US non-military law, \'mitigation\' is a term of art that is
only encountered in dealing with the death penalty.  [forgive the
non-capital letters - shift key is sticking]
the supreme court ruled in the 70s that state death penalty laws which
do not consider mitigating and aggravating factors are
unconstitutional.  thus, amongst lawyers, if someone says mitigation,
we\'re almost always talking death penalty.  however, some states have
used the same language with regard to serious crimes.  in these
situations, mitigation is with regard to the penalty, not the
determination of guilt or liability.

what mm described as \'mitigation\' is its common sense meaning.  it
encompasses both defenses and excuses.  i think this is very appropriate
given the context in which he writes, a generic abstract of legal
systems that will no doubt be implemented in various ways in various
systems.  it goes to the defintition of the crime really.

generally, there are two types of crime and liability; those requiring a
specific mental state or intent (mens rea), such as \'intentionally\',
\'knowingly\', \'willfully\', \'wantonly\', \'recklessly\', \'negligently\', \'with
disregard for human life\', \'with depraved indifference,\' \'with malice
aforethought\', etc.  crimes and liabilities that do not require a
specific type of intent are called \'strict liability\', and there is
rarely, if ever, and excuse or defense to these.  a good example is
speeding and parking tickets.  over the limit or over the line and you
are guilty.  the judge may dismiss it if you can prove a
life-threatening emergency, but you are still guilty and nothing
mitigates that.

with this backdrop, you can see that mm\'s blessed brief and concise
descriptions cut to the heart of the matter.

\'intention\' is the necessary mental state that is an element of the
crime.  it must be proved or no crime has been committed.
\'passionate or emotionally charged\' - evidence of this will negate
certain types of intent, especially those requiring premeditation,
malice, specific intent, i.e., the specific outcome was the goal of the
actor.
\'accidental or unintended\' do much the same and usually are evaluated in
terms of the foreseeability of the consquences to the actor.  if the
outcome was not reasonably foreseeable, the defendant will not be found
to have the requisite intent.
\'ignorance\' - well, i have yet to encounter a legal system where
ignorance of the law has excused anyone\'s conduct, but its a big
universe.  ignorance that a violation took place is different though.
proof of it may negate responsibility for some classes of crimes,
especially those that involve cooperative acts of multiple defendants,
such as conspiracy crimes.

can you tell i just took the bar exam?   ;-)

IIRC gold is actually a poorer conductor than copper. Gold is used
connecting chips to their IC carrier because it\'s very ductile; copper
wires that tiny would snap. It\'s also used on card contacts because it
doesn\'t corrode, but where electrical conductivity is important copper is
the way to go.

Taken from my "Ships of the Interstellar Wars" page:

Terran Confederation Warships

During the Interstellar Wars the Terran Confederation did not use the common 
forms of designations for their warships. Instead they used a system of 
nomenclature that owed more to the Terran "Age of Sail". Thus rather than 
dividing their ships into the usual groupings of Battleships, Cruisers, Destroyers 
etc. the Terrans used the following ship types

Ships of the Line: These were large capital ships designed with the sole 
purpose of meeting enemy warships in battle and defeating them.

Cruisers: This term was only introduced during the 9th Interstellar War. When 
the Terrans developed meson guns they found that they were most effectivily 
employed in ships smaller than their current Ships of the Line. Hence the term 
"Cruiser" was introduced to refer to capital ships mounting meson guns. These 
ships were closer in size to the large Frigates that were common in the Terran 
fleets at that time (circa 35,000 Td as against circa 120,000 Td for Ships of the 
Line and circa 15,000 Td for Frigates). Their role however was not that of a 
traditional cruising ship but that of a capital ship.

Frigates: These were designed as "Cruising Ships". Their roles were scouting, 
commerce raiding and commerce protection.

Corvettes: These were small frigates designed for commerce raiding, escort 
and patrol duties.

Sloops: These were small ships designed for general patrol duties. Frequently 
encountered in peacetime as picket vessels.

Missile boats: These were small non-jump capable vessels. Built around a 
small mass produced hull fitted with a large number of missiles to counter the 
heavy missile armament of Vilani vessels. The Missile Boats were one of the 
two "elite" branches of the Confederation Navy.

Mother Ships: Jump capable tenders for the Missile Boats.

Raiders: These were small "expendable" ships designed to destroy enemy 
merchant vessels. Generally featured long endurance and a powerful 
armament. Extensively used in the scouting role in addition to their anti-
commerce roles. The Raiders were one of the two "elite" branches of the 
Confederation Navy.

Bomb Ketches: These were sloop sized vessels designed specifically for 
planetary bombardment roles. Distinguished by their slow acceleration, heavy 
defences and strong missile batteries.

Guardships: Ships assigned to defend specific fixed locations. Generally these 
were an assortment of obsolete warships no longer suited for frontline duties 
assigned with little or no modifications. However some purpose designed 
guardships were built for strategic systems. These were similar to non-jump 
capable Ships of the Line.

This is clearly a misreading of the the question.  The question is
clearly how did the K\'Kree scientists get to earth to do the
research that lead to the discovery of jump drive (hence the
reference to the K\'Kree discovering jump drive on earth) before
thay had interstellar travel.  And why didn\'t they do the research
on the K\'Kree homeworld?

(After all, the idea they used sensors to see jump dives on Earth
is just silly:-)

things. The \'other lot\' have a habit of messing up the issue.

Take the Kiev class carriers. Not in the same league as a US (or, say,
French) large aircraftcarrier, but more akin to the British through-deck
cruisers (light carriers in all but name, operating ASW helos and VSTOL
fighters). 

However, while the Western approach for a carrier is: point-defence weapons
only, leave ASW, long-range air defence and surface attack to the vessel\'s
air compement, the Kiev is half cruiser, half carrier.

The result is a reaonable powerful cruiser (modern definition, not
Traveller) which operates some aircraft for air defence and ASW, plus
missile guidance. Reliance is mainly placed on the \'cruiser\' weapons, not
the planes.

But what you have is a flexible ship that\'s not nearly as good as a Carrier
Task group, but costs less, too. Its role is different. Point is, is that a
cruiser or a carrer? Both. 

For Traveller, where we have vast areas of space to cover, you might see a
\'Frontier Patrol Vessel\' or \'Self-Escorting Cruiser\', a cruiser-sized
warship with slightly weaker armament but carrying a gunship squadron and a
bunch of ground troops. It\'s not a s good as a cruiser in battle, but it\'s
flexible, and it\'s a one-ship task force.

The Imperials might not bother, but if budgets were tight then these ships
might be seen as cost-effective for patrol duties.

The Ushman class was a paramilitary vessel, intended not only as a high jump
trading vessel, but also as a patrolship helping to maintain law and order
on the spacelanes. Throughout the long history of the Ziru Sirka designs such
as the Ushman class actually formed the bulk of the Empires patrol and
escort forces. The construction of these vessels was heavily subsidised by
the various Vilani Bureaux, and they proved to be a cost effective means of
patrolling space throughout most of the Ziru Sirka. However they were totally
outclassed by the Terran Confederation\'s Raiders during the Interstellar
Wars (they proved to similarly ineffective against the incursion of the Vargr
corsairs during the same period) and as such suffered heavy casualties.

Despite their military role, these ships were not naval vessels and the bulk
of their crews were civilians (only 7 crew members operating the weapons were
considered to be naval personnel); and they were required to operate as
commercially viable units. Thus they conformed to general Vilani merchantile
design practice, the only concessions to their military role being their
armarment, light armour and on board fuel purification capacity. Unfortunatly
these compromises resulted in them being only marginally profitable (even
with the Bureaux subsidy) and with the fall of the Ziru Sirka they rapidly
disappeared as the Rule of Man was unwilling to subsidise their construction.

The only example of the Ushman class known to have survived the Long Night
was the Ariiarargu. The Ariiarargu was built at Dingir shortly the start of
the Eigth Interstellar War. Her assigned patrol area included the Duriim
system and she was the only Vilani vessel to escape with the news of the
systems fall to the Terrans. She was latter to achieve fame when after the
Vilani defeat in the 2nd Battle of Duriim, her captain showed considerable
skill and determination in carrying the news through Terran controlled space.
As a result the Ariiarargu was preserved in the AAB on Vland and survived
through the long night intact.

When writing material for M0, my assumption has been that the maps are the
latest \'commercialy\' available data, referencing the state of Imperila
knowledge around -25 before the collapse of the interstellar confederacy
etc, and just as Cleon started his thirty year expansion drive and the
resultant promotion to emperor.

This seems to work okay and also helps justify the lousy quality of the
data on the maps (lacking in starports etc). Even with the lousy data,
First survey would have been so much better with trade routes, bases etc
marked on with two maps, one for the ref, one for players.

I produced Core subsector up with starports and names and it made quite a
difference...

Except most of those last ones are crimes as well. \'Give them a disease..."
that\'s one of those imperial rules of war things, it\'s called biowarfare.
Restriction to location is kidnapping, and meets the essential control
requirements of slavery, as do \'training collars\', and holding a family hostage.

Brainwashing is another thing...if you call yourself the High Majareesh
Bagwhan and get your followers to give you all their money and work for
nothing...hey, it\'s their \'choice\'. Why do you think there\'s all those damn
Gov type \'D\'s around?

The question is _whose_ business is it bad for? The Imperium does not treat
any running-dog capitalist as equals...there are many who are more equal than
others. Imagine, you\'re a petty little despot, running a lucrative slavery
trade, and some sector-wide news organization investigates you and splashes
all your corporate clients and graphic details of the horrible conditions
under which your \'workers\' toil. Huge public outcry, petty nobles take stances
against you in the Moot, your clients competitors seize the opportunity to
wreak havoc on them and keep the pot boiling. 

Ta-da, you\'re now the squeaky wheel in the status quo, and the MOJ is on you
like a load of bricks.

You are making a broad assumption that the 3I is stricly \'rule of law\'. It
ain\'t, never has been. Since the moment ol\' Cleon I had himself crowned
Emperor, the 3I has been a mixture of both rule of law and rule of man...a
noble rules of his own power derived from a man, the Emperor, not law.

Each one of those cases you stated above could be construed to be covered
under the simple \'Control of another person against their will=slavery\' rule.
Whether you\'re prosecuted or not, as others have said depends on the resources
and will of the Imperium.

Something that seems to be getting lost here...the stated reason that the
Imperium is governed the way it is is because of it\'s sheer size. That
absolutely necessitates a hguge amount of local autonomous control, which
means the law _will_ inevitably be prosected differently in different places.

Well, the only reason it wasn\'t \'free\' was there was, practically speaking
absolutely no where else to go...which is why the rise of towns killed it so
quickly...sort of. Here in the US they called it \'sharecropping\', and it
occured well ito the 20th century.

However, the manorial lord had some (in theory) pretty heavy responsibilities
to his serfs, and they had some pretty absolute control over him as well,
since they could, if they so chose, starve him into submission.

besides i wouldnt mind seeing some thing like this pop up as an actual ship

Although called Sp濃kreuzer - Reconnaissance Cruiser - those ships were
basically large destroyers capable for Atlantic Operations. Based on
traditional destroyer design, several project studies started in 1938 to
develop a large destroyer of the size of a CL. Like most German CLs, those
ships were planed to get a mixed propulsion system, geared turbines for high
speed and diesel engines for long cruises. It was planed to use this ships in
combinations of the new battleships of the Z-Plan in the North Atlantic where
the Sp濃kreuzer should be the eyes of a larger battle fleet.

K\'kree!  So the Centaur\'s hatred of carnivores

insight into their psychology.

********

Now, my take on slavery... Slavery is rather inefficent compared
to a willing, paid workforce.  Also, industrialization and the division
of labour tend\'s to finish off slavery as a workable concept. Add in the
fact that
the Imperium prohibit\'s slavery, and it would seem that there would be
no slavery at all, especially if you are using "Middle Atlantic" aka
American Slavery as the model.

On the other hand, there is certainly oppression on various Imperial worlds:
many libertarians would argue that Communism is a form of slavery,
and there are almost certainly Communist societies within the
Imperium.

Moreover, some form of indentured servanthood
seem\'s likely, as a way of paying off loans, colonist transport cost\'s,
etc.

Still, indentured servanthood is is quite different than slavery.  For one,
it is not tansferred from parent\'s to children.  Also, servant\'s are still
people,
rather than slaves, which are legally so much furniture, to be
used, raped and killed when conveinent or entertaining. And not just
the slaves, but their children and THEIR children as well,
till the end of time.

Serfdom, however, may indeed exist in the Imperium in some form.
For now, let\'s define serfdom as a form of communism: the slave may
never *own* any land (or factories, or starships...), but - as long as
he provides labour to his lord - he has the right to use some of his
lord\'s property for the serf\'s personal use, (including increasing
personal wealth, to buy his freedom say) has the right to be treated as a
man rather than as some sex toy or beast of labour, can
marry and have children, etc.  His children, however, are also born as
serf\'s, and also must serve their lord.

Enforcing serfdom - that is, keeping it from becoming slavery -
is going to be a nightmare without increasing the power of the
Imperium to massive, and probably unsustainable levels.
To the extent that the nobility in the West didn\'t treat the serf\'s as
animals is due to a powerful, universal Christian Church.  There is
no analogue to this institution in the offical Imperium.  (Although
family ties & the honour code may make a fair substitute)

In the end, I suspect that serfdom itself would be offically banned
by the Imperium as just a different form of slavery - but the ban will
be enforced or ignored, depending on the wealth and the personality of the
local nobility.

Eventually, you run into limits on what forms of servitute the Imperium can
forbid, before extending it\'s power to illegal and unsustainable levels; ie
banning son\'s of farmers from working on the farm due to child labour laws,
insisting that all families have a paid nanny to raise children rather than
using the unpaid labour of the wife.  Moreover, the very institution of the
Imperium endorses some form of servanthood: what are nobles, but servant\'s
of the Emperor?   And aren\'t the Imperial military just armed retainers of
the Irridium Throne?

	You forgot the most classic of all, comparative advantage!  
Admittedly, in the modern world this plays a small role compared to 
economies of scale, but there\'s reason to believe it would be more 
important in the Imperium.  Given the wide variety of different kinds of 
"terrain" (earth-like, asteroid, water-world, fluid, etc.) there will be 
more opportunities for trade based on these differences.  The classic is 
a terrestrial world and asteroid belt trading biologicals for minerals.  
This is the notion behind Traveller\'s trade classifications (Ag, In, 
etc.)

The Vargr being what they are, I predict mixed and varied reactions. :)

In general, I would expect them to a certain unease with terran dogs, since 
they are a reminder of the geneered origins (something they are touchy about).

I beg to differ.  The enslaved person is going to be allowed to
testify.And IMHO and Legal Experience, even if the victim doesn\'t
testify,
it wouldn\'t be hard to prove the case at all.  And thats assuming that
the Imperium\'s courts are as liberal as modern Terra.

Cool. Can you send this to me ? Also, did you compute the route from
Cerebin to Serendip Belt via Zuflucht ? If you allow drop tanks, it\'s a
jump-4 route.

IMO it should be tonnage shipped depends on the GWP and net profitability.
We really should stick time in there as well, because time is money -
someone has all this capital tied up in owning the cargo while it is
between the worlds, money that could otherwise be earning a nice little
packed in Hortalez et Cie bonds.

Profitibility determines if trade happens. One assumes the more profitible
trade is, the more of the economies involved will be dedicated to that
trade (this may not be true. Imagine a world with one very rick deposit of
lanthanum. If that mine is profitable, it will operate. But if that mine is
exteremly profitable, there can still be only one lanthanum mine).

But if you can make money shipping goods between 2 worlds, it doesnt matter
how far apart they are.

Transport costs are not a square function incidentally - do you have a copy
of Hans\' Passenger and Freight table ? Basically, jump-3 is the most
efficient per-parsec way to transport goods long distances. (incidentally,
this means the importance of jump-1 mains has been way overstated.
Essentially, they are irrelevant for long-distance transport).

The high-volume trade routes will tend to get source prices lower than
this, but market prices higher than this.

[also, please do me a favour and not mention the v-word ... prices are nice
simple things, being based as they are on opinions, backed up with cash.
The v-word is a lot more nebulous and makes by brain hurt when I think
about it, and I get this overwhelming urge to start reading Ricardo and the
Grundrisse]

If trade is this high with your assumptions, then it is going to be a quite
healthy number once we plug in some more pro-trade assumptions.

The maximum effective life of ships is something that has never really been
defined. Personally, I think starship maintainence should be 1% per decade,
and if your engineer gets a special success then the ship gets 1d6 years
\'younger\'.

Without local enforcement, the Imperium wouldn\'t hear about it.  If the
local government supports slavery, the Imperium would be totally in the
dark.  Of course if local government held slavery to be illegal that\'s a
different story.  All I\'m saying is that the Imperium can\'t enforce slavery
laws without local help, thus it should be local jurisdiction.  Now, if the
Imperium wants no slavery, they can write that into the treaty when a new
world signs up.  One of the tenets would be outlawing slavery.  Of course
that would make slavery High Treason as it would threaten the Imperial
treaty.

Jump-1 mains are important in sub TL12 situations - Long Night
recoveries, for example, or local worlds attempting to develop
interstellar trade. While TL12 is the Imperial Average, 
there are a lot of Class A Starports at TL9 or 10.

While Jump-3 availability will introduce the efficiency referred to by
Han\'s Passenger and Freight Tables, the cultural and trade links
forged before Jump-3 was available will have an endurance of their
own. These links may slowly erode as new trade routes replace the
old, leading to interesting (ok, _bad_) changes for the bypassed worlds.

Well, aside from the fact that they are not derived from "dogs", are
they "touching" or just "proud".  IMO, the only touchiness comes from
all the dog jokes and human prejudices that Vargr living in the Imperium
are subject to.  Which brings up the question, do humans in the
Vargr extents have to put up with "Cheeta" jokes?  How do _they_
react to chimpanzees.  (I can the said that Ancient genetic engineering
gives Vargr a break with their canine past while humans are, in fact,
the sons and daughters of primates).

According to my electronics course we use gold because the contact
resistance stays low due to gold\'s low reactivity with other materials, i.e.
when you two gold connectors they don\'t react with each other and tarnish,
retarding the connection. With dissimilar materials you get more tarnishing
and they stuff up faster... I think.
Don\'t quote me on the above stuff, that\'s just what I\'ve garnered from my
course, I\'ll ask Paddy (the tutor) and come back with the definitive answer
:)

By the way, copper is a better conductor than gold, but silver is a better
conductor than copper.

The Concordance is a culture that I\'ve been working with, a small
cluster of late TL-12 worlds outside the Imperium. They have
a relatively unified interplanetary culture, and like to use robots
for things as long as the robots have close human supervision.

This is the first draft of my idea for an infantry fire support drone. 
A bit over half a MCR each, might be a bit pricey for a squad level
support asset. It\'s built with "Basic Command", which seems to mean 
you can\'t use complex sentences and must articulate clearly - the 
latter could be a problem in a combat situation.

(Recall Sergeant in _Aliens_ asking the Lieutenant to repeat orders
while his team is getting torn apart)

You can tell it "Proceed to tree line", or "Follow the heat trace and
destroy the source", but you can\'t tell it "Roam around the battlefield
until you find grav tanks, then report their location to me while you
hide and keep them under surveillance".

I gave it an Obscuration Device so it could throw a smokescreen
over it\'s squad, or protect itself from laser fire. I wanted to give it
a video recorder, but the weight would have comprimised it\'s
3G acceleration. Infantry Ground Combat skill was included so
the Drone would have the vocabulary needed to understand
battlefield orders, and Recon skill was added so it could do a
low-level interpretation of sensor data - so it might recognize
certain marks as tank tracks, or a certain heat signature as the
vent from an underground bunker\'s power source.

It\'s about the size of a big person with no arms or legs, so it
can fit wherever you carry a person - in a standard drop capsule, for
example. An expeditionary force would save life support costs,
but will have to pay about Cr5500 per year in maintenace costs.

Without further ado, I present to you the Concordance Plasma Drone.

That would be correct. Especially as I don\'t have the book to proof it

The logic for the latter goes like this: Attack carriers are a lovely big
target. Use of ballistic missiles at sea is less likely to lead to
esaclation, so carriers might get nuked.

Any air power is better than none.

So the idea was to use the Spruance hull (also used for the Ticonderoga

which operates a couple of VTOL fighters for recce or air defernce - or
even strike, I suppose.

No, I specifically avoided the question.  I needed a closed system, I\'m not
enamoured of drop tanks anyway, and two jump-4 legs would leave only 36% of
the initial ship volume in either direction as total payload fraction -
including all ship\'s systems and cargo.  Such trade might exist, but it
would not be economically viable or significant.

Distance *is* time, at least in Traveller: two weeks per jump, base case.
I already made the point that reducing time on intermediate stops is a
money-maker, if your freight is shipping more than one leg at a time.

I subtracted Cr900 per leg from gross profit, on the theory that charter
rates are the lowest that still make money consistently and that large
shipping lines would have reduced costs to the minimum.

The "gravity" model is derived empirically (not by me, of course) from
real-world observations of the amount of trade between points, based on
distance and an "attactiveness" factor, which I have represented with GWP
and (net) profitability.  The actual fitted value of the exponent for
distance is 1.9 - close enough to squaring as makes little difference.

True - to be completely accurate, I should have used the traded cost and
price.    This seemed a useful approximation, as the differences are less
than a factor of 2 in most cases.

I used 40 years, the standard mortgage term.  For comparison, the IRS
depreciation tables list 18 years for amortization of ships, though this is
clearly skewed toward accelerated depreciation to reduce corporate taxes.

Yep.   All of the major interstellar powers govern rather loosely, I
think...

Third Imperium: Feudal rule, united by alliegance to the Emperor
Solomani Confederation: A federation of smaller nations, united by
   belief in Human supremacy
Aslan Hierate: Aslan clan rule, united by Aslan Tradition
Vargr Extents:  Umm, there\'s No Such Thing as a unified Vargr State
Hiver Confederation: Not much of a governement at all: it\'s main purpose
    of existance is so the Hiver\'s can spread their genetic material around.
Two Thousand Worlds: I know pratically nothing about the K\'kree except the
    usual blurbs: we haven\'t had a sourcebook on them since Classic
Traveller.

    How DO they govern?  Do they care about their subject worlds at all,
just
    as long as they\'re vegan?  Do they have some Interstellar Society of
    Vegetarians organized throughout Charted Space?  Have they sent
    Green Missionaries  to every major spaceport?  How do they use
    science: as a necessary plague like the Vilani?   Or do they only
    care about social change, but are blase regarding tech?

I am assuming that systems that meet all of the following requirement\'s

I once did some research on slavery in Ancient Rome that may be of interest
to you. (Note that specific information was very scanty and that I\'ve
interpreted that information very freely, so this is not much more than a
guesstimate itself. I\'d like to think  it is not too far from the truth,
though).

Basically, the price of a slave is two year\'s pay to a freeman performing
the best-paid job someone with the skills of that slave could get. A free 
field worker at the time of Cato recieved between 2/3rd and 5/6th of a 
denarius per day. An unskilled, 20 year old male slave cost 500 denarius. 
This is almost exactly 2 year\'s pay for the free field worker. This was
based on an expected return of 6% (25 denarius) pa. and on writing of
the slave in 20 years (another 25 denarius pa.). Cato reckoned the keep of 
the slave to be 1/3rd of the wage of a laborer = 128 denarius per year. 
(Incidentally, cost of living for a freeman laborer and his wife was 300
denarius per year or 5/6th of a denarius per day). Cato was a parsimonious 
man, however, and I guess that the 128 denarius is a lower limit. Other 
slave owners may have spent a bit more. Personally I\'m going to use 1/3rd 
of the wage as a guideline, meaning that more valuable slaves are given 
better food and clothing than mere field slaves.

An older slave could be worth more because of his better skills and less
because of his lesser life expectancy.

Incidentally, I\'ve no idea how a lesser life expectancy would affect the
price of a slave bought for a hard or dangerous occupation. The purchaser 
of a gladiator or a silver mine slave could certainly not expect to write 
him off over 20 years!
 
Luxury slaves could be worth quite a lot. Any unskilled slave costing more
than 625 denarius was taxed as a luxury item (3% instead of 1/10th of a
percent - an anual property tax, I think, but I\'m not sure). Some quoted
prices for courtesans ran from 2000 to 6000 denarius and much more
expensive ones were propably possible.

I suggest that we do not assume any such thing. That particular trade system
is IMO so full of holes that it is useless.

Traveller universe quite well, especially
with it\'s noble background and respect for
history.  In effect, you are playing the
lineage of a family (usually noble,
but commoner\'s also have families...)
over a long time period.  Just play the
interesting part\'s of a PC\'s life, then move
on to their children, grandchildren, etc.

Inheritable traits and the "genus" of a family
(that family\'s self-image, what it agrees on, 
it "spirit") would play major roles here.

Traveller has a long, rather detailed
history and a common ethos throughout
the rule of the thousand-year Third Imperium.  
Coupled with the slowness of technological
change and the stability of the political 
and economic systems - and the affinity
that Vilani socal systems have for 
stability - Traveller look\'s like an ideal
environment for Dyanstc gaming.

Things to note:
- - family allies and enemies
- - family religious/ideological belief\'s
- - the rise, fall, and recovery of family fortune
- - the unity or divisiveness of the family
- - the family\'s focus on military, economic, 
  religious, or political matters (or a mixture thereof)
- - the willingness or reluctance of the use of violence
- - the family\'s relations with the Imperial government
- - the family\'s relations with it\'s home base (a system,
  a corporation, etc.)
- - the family\'s relations with Imperial nobility
- - is the family Solomani?  Vilani? Something else?

Also, note how these things have changed over time, and their
initial set-up.

    'body' => 'It has been previously noted on this list that
the Subsector government is where the real
military decision\'s are made.   Let\'s stretch this,
and assume that the subsector-level of government
is where much of the action is organized politically 
and economically, as well.

Now, the subsector Duke has the basic responsibility
of upholding the Will of the Emperor in his area: if the
emperor decides to ban psionic\'s Imperium-wide, this 
Duke is the one who has to actually organize local resources to
meet the goal.  If the subsector is given additional tool\'s
by the Emperor/Archduke/Senior Duke, the subsector Duke
actually makes most of the decisions on who-get\'s-what
(with the help of the local Moot, of course)

This Duke also represent\'s the area to higher authority.
The Duke is NOT in charge of a system, not even the 
subsector capital: if he feel\'s that a system is being 
exploited, he can press on that particular
system\'s noble to fix things, but is limited in what he can 
do unless the exploiter does Something Clearly Stupid: 
*then* he send in the Marines.

The subsector Duke, however, is probably the first level of real 
resistance to major Sector, Domain, and MegaCorp business.  
If he feels that MegaCorp bribery is undermining the local nobility\'s
alliegance to the Crown, he can unilaterally start slapping
people around, laying punitive taxes, etc - and be backed by
the subsector fleet.  If he has the backing of the Sector Duke, 
he can even ban the Corp from local space until it clean\'s up
it\'s act.

Deciding which system get\'s major changes (ie. major terraforming, 
hundred\'s of million\'s of immigrant\'s, additional tech level\'s or 
Imperial bases and installation\'s) is usually a Sector-level decision.
However, the subsector Duke can lobby hard for his particular patch 
of systems to get the goodies.

As Head of the Subsector Legal Court, the subsector Duke also 
decides how the law will be interpreted, within the limit\'s set by his
lieges (Sr. Duke to Emperor).   He may refuse to hear legal cases, 
or refer them to the Subsector Moot, or even a commoner 
court, depending on how the local legal system is set up.  In all cases,
the subsector Duke has final say, subject only to his lieges.

Most subsector Dukes have multiple titles, and - as the ruler of
those systems and fief\'s - has multiple bases of political power.
(Additional votes in the Subsector Moot, for example)

Upon occasion, the subsector Duke might also have
control of the local military: the military chain of 
command is hazy in the Subsector and Sector levels.
(There are no fleet\'s organized at the Domain level: 
since there is no such thing as a Domain Admiral, 
the Archduke is automatically CinC.  Same at the
Imperium level.)  

Of course, many Admirals are nobles in their own right, but 
their fief\'s may be at the other side of the Imperium.

Moreover, there is also "unoffical" power that the subsector Duke has.
The Duke is *always* independently wealthy, and often has
a few side businesses that he is allowed to favour (ie subsidies,etc)
to a limited extent (no, he can\'t make his agribusiness conglomerate
the ONLY source of food in the subsector - but he can make sure that
it always has 10% of the subsector market).  The Duke is also at the top
of the local social pyramid: he decides who\'s "in" and "out", who 
should be shamed and ostracised, and who should be respected and
publicly praised.   

 (Most system nobles fear the Duchy Court a lot more than the
  Imperial Court, when it comes to High Society: they might go to
  Capital/Core/Core maybe twice in their entire life, but they need to 
  deal with the subsector Court on a routine basis.)
