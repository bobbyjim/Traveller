This is a really intersting "little ditty", but Iam at a little lost
on it is to be used. Has anyone used it yet? And if so can you explain how?

I\'ve used it! What it does is extract a single subsector\'s world data
from a whole sector\'s worth of world data.

As all Traveller veterans are well familar, a sector is an array of 32 X
40 hexes, and is subdivided into sixteen 8 X 10-hex subsectors as
follows (I hope my A-R, omitting I and O lettering was correct --
somebody correct me should my memory be faulty):

The official form of storing mass amounts of world data (as declared by
Traveller prime originator Mark Miller) is in a file representing an
entire sector, with each line of the file representing a single world.
The gensec program I wrote produces a format very similar to Mr.
Miller\'s format (it has a few added columns).

Sometimes it is nice to extract the data for a single subsector, for
example to create a detailed subsector map (ala mapsub, the subsector
mapping program, for instance).  What is desired is a program that given
a sector file, produces a subsector file by throwing out all the worlds
not belonging to a single sector of interest.  A shell script has been
written to do this, called subsec.csh.

Given a sector file, "Spinward", and a desire to look at subsector "G"
only, one could type to the UNIX Shell:

	subsec.csh 3 2 Spinward >Regina

This would create a new file, "Regina" which contains only those worlds
from Spinward which are also in the G subsector region.  The 3, 2 is the
x, y coordinates of the "G" subsector in the overall sector picture
above (The origin is at the upper right corner of the subsector map).

Now what to do with the subsector data? Well, you can show the data to
your players, or map it into a pretty hex grid with the mapsub program.

Naturally to use subsec.csh, you need to be running UNIX and have the
csh command shell.

I don\'t mean to offend if this is a simpler explanation than was
desired.  I know there are some people out there not very familiar with
Traveller and I hoped to write something at a novice level to help them
out.

There are 93 Travellers on the list, and there are 14 future Travellers
pending address confirmation.  This represents a steady growth at the
beginning (July-August), followed by a period of relative stasis at
about 75 members (September-Decemeber), followed by a steep rise in the
last half of December to the current number of 93 members.  This list of
people is available on request.  The recent expansion of the list
overseas has resulted in 3 or 4 new members at the University of
Linkoping, Sweden, and a couple more in the UK.  It\'s exciting to see
Traveller alive and well overseas, although I wonder if they have a more
limited/more enhanced set of published materials in their regions.

It\'s been fairly dead lately, due to the bug in the mailing list
software, but that\'s been fixed, as is evidenced by the messages from
glenn and baranski that have gotten through.  Fixing the bugs and then
adding all the new members (Welcome aboard!) has kept me very busy over
the last month or two.

Here\'s a list of the archives I keep for the list.  Everyone should have
seen at least numbers 60 through 89.  If you want back archives, just
send mail to me at traveller-request and I\'ll try to retrieve them for
you.

I saw this article on rec.games.frp concerning Mega-Traveller, and thought I\'d
gateway it to the Traveller Mailing List.  Rob, maybe someone here will have
an answer for you.  I have Mega-Traveller on hold at the not-so-local gamers
shop, but I haven\'t had a chance to read much of it yet, or I\'d probably offer
some thoughts myself.

I bought it this weekend. GDW seems to have done well on the re-write.  I don\'t
care for the task system, but other than that it seems ok.  Does any one have
any opinions on Mega-Traveller?  Are there any things that I should be aware of?
(Being fairly well versed at Traveller)

Thanks in advance.

It was a little frightening.  I amazed myself with the speed
at which I picked up the boxed set of MegaTraveller.  I had 
told myself I wasn\'t going to buy the boxed set.  I had already
bought a copy of the first of the three books individually, I
was going to wait for the other two books to be released singly
before grabbing them.

Hah!  Somehow the thinking, rational part of my brain was 
short-circuited and the reptile base of my brain forced me to 
grab a copy off the shelf and shell out thirty bucks for it.  

The MegaTraveller boxed set includes a 102 page Players\' Manual, 
a 104 page Referee\'s Manual, and the \'Imperial Encyclopedia\' -
a 96 page book of background material.  Also included are a 
pair of dice and a fairly spiffy map of the Spinward Marches.

I have yet to actually run MegaTraveller, I have read through 
the rules, played with the character generation stuff, vehicle
generation stuff, etc.  It looks pretty playable.  It wasn\'t
hard to figure out.  I think if you have some experience with
Traveller, MegaTraveller will look pretty familiar to you.

MegaTraveller is the first major rewrite of the Traveller rules.
Over the years GDW has repackaged the game in big boxes, little
boxes, big books, little books, and so forth.  Each of these
formats included pretty much identical text.  MegaTraveller has
been changed to try to fix some areas where the original rules
were lacking.  

The whole game makes use of a task system, much like Twilight
2000 and Traveller 2300.  This is a system to codify certain 
objectives of the players.  The idea behind this is to break
down the player\'s immediate objectives into a series of simply
defined tasks that are described in a predetermined format.

The Traveller combat system has been replaced with one that 
is task based.  I have always hated the original combat system, 
anything different was a welcome change.  The new system takes
into account penetration values for armor; it also unifies
personal and vehicular combat.  I haven\'t used this in play 
yet, so it\'s hard to evaluate it at this point.

Traveller\'s separate starship, aircraft, and vehicle genera-
tion systems have been replaced with one general system.  This 
system seems to work well, and is pretty straight forward.

Everything has been rewritten for added clarity and understanding.
They make frequent use of step-by-step procedural instructions
of how to move through a particular system.

My biggest complaint is with the frequent typos and editing
problems present in MegaTraveller.  It looks like GDW has 
skipped the entire step of proof-reading their work.  The only 
spelling errors that appear to have been caught are those 
noticeable to a spell check program.  This is fine for casual 
correspondence, but in my mind not for professional work such 
as theirs.

I am looking forward to using these rules as a referee.  I think
they are a positive change in Traveller.  I would recommend them
to anyone with a passion for the game.

I\'m sure to be only the first person to leap upon you for this :-)

Traveller, for reasons unknown to lesser mortals, *does* use I and O
for designators. Thus the subsectors in a sector range from A to P.

By the way has anybody figured out a "standard" format for storing
the extended system data generated by using the Book 6(Scouts) 
world & system generation technique? 

I\'ll be needing something soon, as I\'m making progress on my program
to generate systems using the book 6 rules. It\'s complete up to, but
not including the adjustment of a companion\'s orbit if the rolled orbit 
turns out to be inside it\'s primary.

So far it is pretty fast. As part of a test for how often you would
get a trinary system where *both* companions have "far" orbits, I
generated over 300 thousand systems (stars only) in less than 5
minutes on my 10Mhz PC. Not too bad for Pascal...

When I get this monster completed, I\'ll post it if anyone is interested.
(Turbo Pascal 4.0 for the PC)

I would consider using an ascii format that looks just like the form
presented in the back of Book 6.  That way you don\'t have to write a
form generator, and should this program ever be ported to the UNIX
environment (I\'m a rabid games software porter, myself), it would make
processing much easier than an (ack) binary file format.

Just a suggestion...

Hi everyone,

If you\'d been looking closely lately, you\'d have noticed by now that my
computer (dadla) is no longer dadla.tek.com.  It\'s now dadla.la.tek.com.
That means that the system adminstrator has decided to phase out the
name "dadla.tek.com" and have dadla live only in the la subdomain (la
stands for "Logic Analyzers").

So, be aware that traveller@dadla.tek.com and
traveller-request@dadla.tek.com are becoming obsolete, and to use
traveller@dadla.la.tek.com or traveller-request@dadla.la.tek.com in the
future.

I finally broke down and bought Traveller 2300, actually it was finally
availible here, and I find it quite interesting, it works some what like
Twilight 2000 execpt much more streamlined. Another interesting thing I noticed
is that they both belong to the same timeline, so the descendents of the surving
soldiers of WWIII will be adventureing 300 years later
By looking at T2300 I can guess what MegaTraveller will be like,



so far I don\'t think I will be to disapointed, but I fear some things will gone
in favor of new ideas


eg: You can change careers in T2300 maybe so in MT, but the easy to use
UPP maybe gone (they do not exsit in T2300)


thats all for now.

Hi, this is my first posting to this mailing list.

I have the Fifth Frontier War boardgame, which seems very at odds with the rest
of the "official" universe. First, when I play it, it never gets beyond the
second year. Compare this to the "official" war, 1107-1111. By 1111, the
Imperial fleets would be complete, and walking all over the Zhodani. Next, why
has the News Service made no mention of Admiral Goolanzoon (what a name!)? With
plotting factor 0, tactical factor +3, when I get him I put him in charge of
the biggest Imperial fleet available, and unleash him. If he arrives early, he
gets the Rimward Forces rienforcements, and mashes the Sword Worlds. If he comes
late, I build up something impressive and let him mash Zhodani. Either way, the
Imperial propaganda machine would love him! Next, Vargr. Balent, Uthith and
Gireel (the Vargr worlds of FFW) bear no resemblance to the worlds in those
positions in Alien Module 3, "Vargr". And in "The Spinward Marches Campaign",
the Vargr are said to come from 40th Squadron. That place has no A class, and
one B class, starport. Where do they get 2 battle squadrons from? And what does
Kedzudh, capital of Kedzudh Aeng and TL G, which I assume is 16, do in the war?

Has anyone tried out this system?  It seems very detailed, perhaps
overly so.  In a few test runs, I didn\'t manage to roll up a single
habitable planet.  Has anyone figured out the chances of a system
(say, G0 V) having a habitable world?
Deficiency - I can\'t find any provision for asteroid belts.
I\'m working on a C program to do the system generation.  If there is
interest, I\'ll send it out.

Well folks, here\'s a forwarded message.  It didn\'t get sent to the list
correctly the first time, so not everybody got it.

The problem is that someone sent mail to
traveller-internal@dadla.la.tek.com.  This is a bad idea.  The address
that works correctly is traveller@dadla.la.tek.com.  It is possible that
in replying to a message your mailer would automatically send a Cc: to
traveller-internal.  I\'ve fixed that so that in future messages your
mailer you should be able to reply to the message correctly.  This fix
will only work for messages with archive numbers greater than 101.

Oh yeah, the archive message numbering for messages 100-104 has been
reshuffled a little (these are the most recent messages).  It\'s back on
track starting with this message.

I was able tcreate a garden world with the system on the first try. 

Though the world atmosphere was to dense for breathing without some type 
of aid.

I noticed there is no ship generation in the game, I could see that 
private design could be prohibited due to the manpower,time and money
that would be required that only nations and corporations can muster.
But the referee should be able have some kind of ship generation to be able 
to design other ships that may be encountered. Maybe they plan to have some
type of supplement for that.

Here is an variant Trav system to generate characters.  It isn\'t Trav but
its based in it. Hope you enjoy.
______________________________________________________________________________



Human Species character generation

Method A.  
	Roll the character out of a GDW Traveller book.  Mercenaries and
High Guard are closely inspected.  Scouts are ok. (For aliens Vargr can be
used depending on where the character starts.)  Give it to the GM for 
manual converison to League Comos.

Method B.
	Design and Random mix.  First is basic character generation:

1. The player divides 48 characteristic points among STR, DEX, END, INT, EDU,
   and SOC.

2. The new character has a base of 3 skill points to divide among the skills
   skills associated with previous experience.  To this base more points are
   added depending on the characters INT, EDU or SOC (to which the player
   cannot assign more than the species maximum).  If an of these 
   charcteristics are below 7 then there is no gain but no penalty.

Characteristic advantages for skill pts:
- ----
INT		EDU		SOC		number points gained
- ----
7-9		7-8		7-8		1
10-12		9-11		9-10		2
13-14		12-13		11-12		3
15		14		13-14		4
<for each       <for each	<no further	+ 1
 + 1>		 + 1>		 gain>
- ----

3. Roll 4D-3 on Previous Experience Chart #1 (basic).  If an 11 or 12 is 
rolled on this chart then roll on Previous Experience Chart #2 (extended) or
choose the nondescript character (generic label character).

Those characters with Scout, League Security, Soldier, Sailor, Colonist
automatically get ATHLETICS-1 at no skill point cost.  Skill points are 
added to the base amount accrued so far.  The base amont is then used to 
choose skills from the Previous Experience Skill Chart.  

The highest initial level is 2.  Any chacteristic modifiers are then added
to this level.

- ----

16		Scientist			2
17		Scientist			3
18		Media				1
19		Media				2
20		Media				3
21		GM special			*

A GM special might be a charcter that owns a starship, a diplomat with 
league rank, a character that knows magic or psionic skills.

- ----

4. Roll 2D to detemine APP or apparrent physical beauty.  At high(er) tech
   levels APP may be adjusted upward (or downward in some odd cases) for a
   cost of 1000 CR per point by a surgeon with MEDICAL-4 and the proper
   equipment.  

5. Roll 2D for FOR or universal force.  All living and some "nonliving" things
   have a force binding their relationship to time, energy and space.  Among
   other attributes FOR is the characters ability to manipulate and withstand
   MAGIC.  A high FOR does not mean the character knows magic.

6. Roll 3D-3 for base psionic ability.  Psionics are similar but very different
   from FOR.  They represents the characters mental will to effect subtle
   causation of mental and physical events around them.  PSI (base psionic
   ability) is used to determine two computed attributes PSS (PSionic Stamina)
   and PSR (PSionic Resistance).

   PSS = (2 * PSI) + STR + END
   PSR = (2 * PSI) + INT + END

7. Roll 2D to determine the characters current worth in CR and yearly (360
   days) salary.  Add one to the roll for EACH LEVEL of money related skill
   (ADMIN, BARGAINING, BRIBARY, DIPLOMACY, FORGERY, GAMBLING, LAW, ORATORY,
   PROPAGANDA).  If a skill is known at LEVEL-0 then a roll of 10+ (ten or
   greater on 2D for tech level 12, any character atribute modifiers apply
   INT, EDU etc.).

   Next add or subtract to the original 2D (not to LEVEL-0 skill rolls if
   they are necessary) the modifier from Social (SOC) Dice Modifier Table.
   This now determines the total accured roll.

   The entire procedure just outlined is done once for current credit and
   one time for yearly salary on Accrued Credit Table

8. Roll 2D to determine the characters age.  Then add or subtract to the
   roll using the Age dice modifier table.  Use the total accrued age to 
   determine age on the Character age table.

each pt add 1     each pt add 1		|

Method C.

     Extended random design.  Go through steps 1., 2., 3., 4., 5. in Method B.
Then go through Extended Human Character Generation steps.  Finally go through
steps 6., 7. and 8. in Method B to complete the character.

Method D.

     Deliberate design with advantages and disadvantages.  Assign 60 points
to STR, DEX, END, INT, EDU, SOC, FOR, PSI.  Do not go over the species limit
or the limits implied by the current tech level.

     Choose a profession from League Cosmos professions list.  Start with
a pool of 5 points.  Apply the points to the characters skills, characteritics
or wealth according to Point allocation table.

- ----
	Point allocation table
- ----
	character attribute			cost in points

	Skills in profession			.5
	Skills outside of profession		1
	Characteristics (STR, DEX, END, EDU
			 SOC)			1
	Characteristics (INT, FOR, PSI)		2
	Credits in current wealth (per 25k)	1
	Credits in current salary (per 25k)	2
- ----

Then you may "buy" additional points for the character by taking a number
of disadvantages corresponding to the points.  Additional points to
correspond to disadvantage points on a one-to-one basis.  A character with
a 6 disadvantage points is fairly warped and may not be comfortable for
some people to play.  By 9 you may really have a flamer.

Some disadvantages can be built directly into the design mechanics.  The
characters charcteristics (all except APP, which hasn\'t been added to the
charcter yet) may be traded for skills.  Skill points may be traded for
chracteristics.  Points may be gained by taking negative skill levels in
skills.  Minor skills are worth less than major skills (minor=.5 pt, major
= 1 pt per negative level).

Other disadvantages are built indirectly.  The charcter is a religious
fanatic, has a great fear of hyperspace or even being off a planet, a 
person or organization is after them.  In some cases oly the Gaming Master
may know what the charcters disadvantages are.

Last the characters wealth and age are generated.  Start at "10" on the 
Accrued Credit Table for Current Credit and Yearly salary.  You may reduce
the number in either column on a 3:1 ratio to make your charcter poorer in
either current money or yearly salary to get disadvantage points.  For
example, the character can get a disadvantage point by having 13k current
credits instead of 23k current credits.  The salary level may be increased
one per .5 disadvantage point spent (this assumes that some are left from
skills and characteristics).  Money related skills DO NOT apply in this
algorithm.

Next choose any age above 21 unless age was used as a disadvantage.

Obviously these designed characters are directly subject Gaming Master
scutiny.

Method E.

Build a character using components from Methods A through D.  Just explain
it to the Gaming Master.

Method F.

Deliberatly design a character with no disadvantages or dice rolling.  This
is useful when a certain type of character is needed for a scenario.  Again
subject to direct scrutiny by the Gaming Master.

Extended random human character generation 

This is a set of companion procedures for those players
that want more detail in their starting character or prefer more
random dice rolls.

An average human and animal (or alien) with the same mass should have 
approximately the same hit points to unconsciousness.  Fatigue points
are optional.  If fatigue points are used there are two counts versus
END, not just one.  Obviously there are a nubmer of mechanized armors that
eliminate all fatigue point loss.

    The END DM modifies the number of END points assigned to the characters by
the player.  If the characters END or DEX goes below 2 or above F use the
DM against STR.  If the case comes up where both END and/or STR and/or DEX is
2 or F then the modifier is lost.

   Home world  STR D END DM       DMs for the characters homeworld conform
   G range                        to DM limits for PC mass.  If STR
                                  goes below 2 and a negative DM is
2  (-).2-.218  -4     -2          rolled it is subtracted from END.

4  .237-.545   -2                 is rolled, it is added to END.
5  .546-.727   -1                 If STR and END are both F and a
6  .728-.909                      positive DM is rolled then the
7  .910-1.099                     DM is lost.  If STR and END are
8  1.1-1.272                      both 2 then the penalty is ignored.

3. Roll 2D six times (one time for each characteristic) to determine the
   effect of the genetic engineer at the characters \'birth-gen\'.

4   -2           -1        -1                  -1
5   -1           -1
6    Natural conception, no genetic engineer, no Dice Modifier
7    Genetic engineer changed nothing at \'birth-gen\', no DM
8   +1           +1
9   +2           +1        +1
10  +3           +2        +1                  +1
11  +4           +2        +1        +1        +1
12  +5           +2        +2        +1        +1        +1

Discussion:  Genetic engineers focus on certain preconditions thus the INT
characteristic is likely to be altered.  APP is the easiest to change
and also the easiest to change the wrong way.  After programming these
the genetic engineer attempts to alter END, STR and DEX.  There is a slight 
chance that genetic makeup will alter the PCs social behavior (SOC).  Genetic
factors do not influence EDU (EDU is 100% learned behavior for gaming 
purposes).  The average tech level for genetic engineering in League Cosmos
is 12.

Environment Descriptors

1. Artificial- is supported by a life support system. characters that come
from this background tend to be trained in skills that don\'t require
open space or randomized social interaction.  Martial arts may seem
foreign to them.  Learned behavior is intensified.
 adv apps: EDU characteristic, ADMIN, CHEM, COMP, ELECT, ENGINEER,
              GRAV, LAW, LING, MATH, MEDICAL, MUSIC, PHARM, PHYSICS, WRITING,
              VACC SUIT.


 dis apps: ATHLETICS, BRAWL, GUN CBT, RIDING, SKIING, SOC SCIENCE,
              STREETWISE, SWIMMING.

2. Hydroplanet- The environment is water.  For standard TRAV assume
90% water or better.  As such certain skills are distant to the character.
    adv apps: ATHLETICS (water sports), SWIMMING, VEHICLE (water only).
    dis apps: ATHLETICS (nonwater sports), JUMPING, RIDING, SKIING (for
               those planets without extreme seasonality), VEHICLE
               (nonwater).

3. Arid planet- In this environment water is a rarity.  Characterss from
this environment are used to uniformity and quietude.  Silent
movement comes natural to them.
    adv apps: STEALTH, SURVIVAL, VEHICLE (air only), WILDERNESS CAMO,
              WILDERNESS TRACKING.
    dis apps: SKIING, SWIMMING, VEHICLE (land or water).

4. Hydro vegetation planet- has an abundance of water and plant
life.  characters from this environment are used to easy camouflage in
natural cover.  Silence dosn\'t always seem necessary to hide oneself.
    adv apps: BIOLOGY, BONTANY, SWIMMING, VEHICLE(water and air only).
    dis apps: STEALTH, VEHICLE(ground only), WILDERNESS CAMO.

5. Typical ecological environment-
    adv apps: none.
    dis apps: none.

Seasonal Descriptors

6. No planetary seasonality- characters that originate from a planet with
   a lack of seasonality tend to be somewhat bored and \'epicurian\'. 
   They tend not to notice certain subtle changes in the environment.
    adv apps: ACTING, ARTIST, ATHLETICS, DIPLOMACY, FORGERY, GAMBLING,
              HIDE ITEM, MUSIC, ORATORY, POETRY, SLIGHT OF HAND, WRITING.
    dis apps: PERCEPTION, PLANETOLOGY, SKIING(if not a cold planet),
              SURVIVAL.

7. Typical planetary seasonality-
    adv apps: none.
    dis apps: none.

8. Extreme planetary seasonality- is caused by eccentric orbits
and/or axial tilt and/or uneven star energy output.  Because of the
harsh conditions the penchant towards the arts is lacking in their
behavior.
    adv apps: CHEM, LEADER, PLANETOLOGY, SURVIVAL, SWIMMING, SKIING,
              WILDERNESS CAMO, WILDERNESS TRACKING.
    dis apps: ACTING, ARTIST, MUSIC, POETRY, WRITING.

9. Artificial seasonality-
    adv apps: none.
    dis apps: none.

Population Descriptors

10. Sparse population- does not include large cities per se.
These characters tend to be \'hickish\' in their behavior.
    adv apps: BARGAINING, BLADE CBT, BRAWLING, CLIMBING, JUMPING, RIDING,
              SURVIVAL, WILDERNESS CAMO, WILDERNESS TRACK.
    dis apps: ADMIN, ARTS OF LOVE, LAW, PROPAGANDA, SOCIAL SCIENCE,
              STREETWISE, URBAN CAMO.



11. Medium to dense population- characters from this environment are familiar
    with large cities.
    adv apps: ADMIN, ARTS OF LOVE, CAROUSING, FORGERY, LAW, PROPAGANDA,
              STREETWISE, URBAN CAMO.
    dis apps: RIDING, SURVIVAL, WILDERNESS CAMO, WILDERNESS TRACK.

12. Clinical population- this environment is synonymous with an artificial
environment.
    adv apps: none.
    dis apps: none.

Discussion:  Advantage applications derived from character background are
added to existing or become new skills.  Disadvantage applications are
subtracted from skills already assigned by the player.  If a skill is reduced
below level 1 it goes to level 0.  If the skill is further reduced it stays 
at level 0.  A unit of an advantage application starts at skill level 1 not at
skill level 0.  In some cases character characteristics themselves are
augmentedor diminished.  They cannot be raised above the species maximum or 
below 2.

    For Traveller 2300, I believe the supplement on ship construction is
Star Cruisers (it is actully more like a whole game).  It is out (or at
least they were packaging it at the warehouse a couple of weeks ago when I
was there).  There is also a supplament on ships of the French Arm with all
sorts of ships and weapons in it.

Sure no problem.  By the way someone in our group will start running MegaTrav
in about a month.  If I get some time I will try to post some comments.

Rendered here in C is a star system generator called st, and some
postcript processing routines which apparently draw subsector maps (I
wouldn\'t know, since I don\'t have access to any postcript
devices/tools/etc.).

This is apparently a partial implementation of the Book 6--Scouts
Expanded Star System Generation system, which determines what orbits
exist around the main star and their satellites, etc.  It does not
conform to any output standard that I know of (like my gensec and mapsub
use an expanded form of the Marc Miller system standard).  It also does
not generate anything other than Solitary star systems -- no binaries or
trinaries.

I found this source in comp.sources.misc, and thought I would share it
with all of you.  I am attempting to contact the author so I can ask him
some questions.

To unpack this shar archive, you must first make two subdirectories,
sysgen and sysprint. sysgen has the generator source (st) and Makefile,
and sysprint has the postscript post-processing stuff.

I don\'t know which newsgroup would be appropriate for the following,
perhaps it should go in comp.sources.misc with some cross-postings?
We are unable to post into rec.games.frp at present, so could you
post it in the most suitable place please?  [Here.  Most non-source

Usage of Traveller Programs
===========================

Create Two subdirectories sysgen & sysprint : Then unbundle the files.
The directories will contain :

sysgen:
Makefile const.h glob.c glob.h init.c main.c planets.c print.c rnd.c sats.c st.c
stuff.h sub.c support.c system.c types.h

sysprint:
Makefile mass stars.ps tr22 trconv trmult trmult.c ts

To generate complete listings of star systems (an allegedly complete
implementation of Single-Star Systems according to the rules in Book 6)
it is necessary to compile the files in sysgen (by typing make) and then
running the program st. Be warned this produces voluminous output.

To generate a postscript file representing the star system, run st with
the -m option. This produces a file which lists the major features in the
system.

The command trconv file in the sysprint directory will then
produce a postscript file. Trading routes can be added to the system
description file by the DM as required.

Multiple systems can be printed using the trmult command. For example

trmult 2 2 stars.ps file1 file2 file3 file4

will place 4 systems on a piece of paper. But be warned: the order is not
the most obvious imaginable.


NOTE: the st command takes an argument which is an integer defining the
system. This allows the st program to be run many times with predictable
results.

tr22 & mass are historical examples of using trmult.

Sure! There\'s a couple ways to interpret the Jack-O-Trades skill; the
standard Traveller way or the MegaTraveller way (MegaTraveller is the
newest revision of the Traveller rules).

The standard Traveller rules I have are very old, being edition one.  I
remember cracking open the set of books that I had ordered direct from
GDW back in 1979, when I was just about to enter High School.  The
printing I have is the 10th print run of the first edition of the Basic
Traveller rules (This was even before the Journal of the Traveller\'s aid
society existed, I think).  Anyway, my set of Traveller rules has very
general, inspecific skill descriptions (which caused me fits of hair
pulling as a Referee in those days), and this is what it says about
Jack-o-trades:


Jack of all trades-- The individual	    The well-rounded individual (the
is proven capable of handling a wide	renaissance man, so to speak) is
variety of situations, and is res-	uncommon in all societies, but is nat-
ourceful in finding solutions and	urally proficient when he occurs.
remedies.				    This skill is a general ability
					which may be applied to nearly any
					endeavor at the discretion of the
					referee.

Note that this doesn\'t say that Jack-o-Trades-N means ALL-SKILLS-N.  It
merely vaguely says that you can give the player a chance in situations
where he has little or no skill.  What this amounts to is that you (as
referee) have to figure out your own way to deal with Jack-O-T.  Methods
I have used are treating Jack-O-T as skill level 0 for all skills in
which the player is totally unskilled, and skill level +1 for all skills
in which the player has skill; but perhaps this is too generous.

MegaTraveller interprets Jack-O-T much more concretely, giving the
player a second (or third, or fourth...) throw any time a task throw
fails.  It does not allow Jack-O-T to be used as any kind of DM, and
also the disadvantage due to lack of skill is still felt at full force.
But the Jack-O-T rules allows those resourceful characters who have it
to pull off miracles sometimes, just when everything seems to be going
wrong.

In MagaTraveller a task throw is required any time a character needs to
use skill for something; for example:

Example Univeral Task Profile (made this up in about 15 seconds):

	To dodge asteroids while flying any spacecraft:
	Routine; Pilot or Ship\'s Boat, Dexterity; 2 sec (fateful).
	If the character is attempting any other action besides
	dodging asteroids, the task becomes Difficult.
	    Referee: If the result is failure, determine damage
	to the spacecraft as per... [etc.]

Long-winded Translation of the above (for those unfamiliar with tasks):

The task is Routine (requires an 7+), or Difficult (requires a 11+).
DMs: + Pilot or Ship\'s boat skill level, +1 if Dexterity 5+ or +2 if
Dexterity 10+ or +3 if Dexterity 15+.  The length of the time it takes
to perform this task is 2 seconds times (3D - above DMs).  Fateful: If
the task fails, some kind of damage to the spacecraft will automatically
occur (The referee will consult the Task Failure table in these cases).

Note that all Univeral Task Profiles assume a skill level of at least 0
(Pilot-0 or Ship\'s Boat-0), unless the notation "Unskilled okay" appears
in parentheses like fateful is above.  If you have absolutely no skill
in a particular skill, there is an additional penalty (I believe the
task increases in difficulty one level, making otherwise Routine tasks
Difficult, and Difficult tasks Formidable, but that\'s from memory as my
MT books are at home).

So if a character with Pilot-3 and Dexterity 7 is attempting to dodge an
asteroid with no other distractions, he can do it by rolling 7+, with
DMs 3 (for Pilot) + 1 (for Dexterity) = +4.  Furthermore, the task would
take 2 sec times (3D - 4) to complete.  If the pilot was evading enemy
weapons fire, he would have to roll a base 11+ with the same DMs.

What Jack-O-T does do, in MegaTraveller, is provide any character which
fails any roll with as many retries as their Jack-O-T level (still
quoting from memory -- I may be a little off here).  So, if your Pilot-3
character is dead and the totally unskilled (at Pilot) Jack-O-T-3
character (Dex 10, just for the sake of argument) tries to fill in, this
is what happens.  Since the character is unskilled, the task difficulty
increases one level (from Routine to Difficult or from Difficult to
Formidable), but he gets as many retries as Jack-O-T skill levels.

So if a character with Jack-O-T-3 and Dexterity 10 is attempting to
dodge an asteroid with no distractions, he can do it by rolling 11+
(Difficult), with DMs 0 (for Pilot) + 2 (for Dexterity) = +2.
Furthermore, the task would take 2 sec times (3D - 2) to complete.  If
the fellow was evading enemy weapons fire, he would have to roll a base
15+ (Formidable) with the same DMs.

Example: Tom Jefferson of Astel Tine has JOT-3 and Dex 10.  He attempts
to dodge an asteroid.  He must roll 11+ with DMs +2.  He rolls an 8 + 2
= 10 and fails.  His first retry he throws 8 again + 2 = 10, failure
again.  On his second retry he throws 4 + 2 = 6 (missing the desired
throw of 11+ by this far is considered exceptional failure, so he
doesn\'t get any more tries.  The referee assigns some amount of damage
to the exterior of the craft.  Woe to smaller craft, which may suffer a
critical hit from the asteroid collision).

Instead, say on his second retry he threw 8 yet again + 2 = 10, failure
again.  He gets one more retry: he rolls a 12 + 2 = 14, and succeeds
(exceptional success!).

Sorry I can\'t give a definitive answer, but I think this is close to the
way MT deals with Jack-O-T.  This is also an example of how MT brings
sense and concreteness where the Traveller rules were unbelievably
vague, something I find refreshing.  It also shows how quickly and
easily a referee can make up a new Task (I made up the "dodge asteroids"
task on the spur of the moment as an example).  I also personally find
the MT task nomenclature very easy to understand and find it easy to
express desired character activites with it.

However, I still haven\'t actually used MT in play, but it seems pretty
neat.

Almost. The last time a character in one of my campaigns had JoT skill, I used
JoT skill -1, with a proviso that the character had some chance of knowing what
he was doing. Hence, JoT-3 means Pilot-2, Pistol-2, etc. if the character has
ever been in Navy, Scouts, Merchant, or had some other reason to know about
starship handling. An Army type with JoT-3 would probably not get to use it for
piloting (although a Marine might). I\'m sure the -1 modifier came from the
rules, along with the quote "Jack of all trades, master of none".

I don\'t think much of the MT method for handling JoTs.  Allowing retrials
up to the level of JoT is an immensely powerful advantage.  Let\'s look at
the numbers (you have to do it sometime!):

In JTP\'s example, the hot pilot gets +4 to dodge asteroids (Pilot-3, Dex-
terity 7).  In a Routine task (7+), odds are 35/36 (97%).

The total novice (Dexterity 7) gets +1; dodging is Difficult (11+), so
the odds are 6/36 (17%).

The nimble novice with JoT-3 now gets 3 additional trials!  What are his
odds?  They are 1-(1-odds for one trial)**4.  Drumroll, please...

    1-(1-17%)**4 = 52%.

Not as high as Pilot-3, whew.  So JoT-N is not equal to Everything-N.
But wait!  What if our the novice had picked up Pilot-0 along the way?
Then the task would be Routine (7+), DM+1, and the odds are 26/36 (72%).
But he still gets four trys at it!

    1-(1-72%)**4 = 99%!
                                   
But wait, there\'s more!  Suppose they are trying to fix the jump drive
simultaneously.  The task is now Difficult (11+).

    Pilot-3: DM+4, odds 21/36 = 58%.
    Pilot-0, JoT-3: DM+1, odds 6/36 = 17%, after four tries 52%.

Almost as good as Pilot-3, and a lot better than Pilot-2!  So, under the
MT rules, we can safely say

    JoT-N is NOT EQUAL TO Anything-N; however JoT-N and Foo-0 is FAR
    SUPERIOR to Foo-N normally, and ALMOST AS GOOD under stressful
    circumstances.

So JoT becomes the most powerful skill in the game, acting as a magnifying
glass for all other skills.  I suggest we take this literally, and call
such characters "Lensmen": apt, since their abilities far outrank those of
the other puny mortals in the game.

I would suggest the following.  Under no circumstances should JoT replace
or augment existing skill.  Instead, JoT can be used to make up for a total
lack of skill.  Here is the "task descriptions":

    To use Foo-0 when you have NO SKILL at Foo for a PARTICULAR task:
    Routine; Jack-of-all-Trades, Intelligence; varies.
    If the character is attempting any other action besides figuring out
    how to make up for a basic lack of competence, the task is Difficult.
        Referee:  If the result is failure, the character may not make
    another attempt at using JoT in this circumstance.

I.e., if you have NO SKILL, and there is a PARTICULAR TASK (e.g., dodging
asteroids), you may try to apply your JoT skill.  It takes as long as the
task would normally take to figure out how to apply JoT to this task.
(Meanwhile, you may be taking some asteroid hits!)  After that time, throw
for success.  If you make it, you may now perform THIS TASK ONLY with a
skill level of zero (instead of unskilled).

After you dodge the asteroids, and want to get back to the space station,
you\'ll need another attempt to get Pilot-0 for the steering.  And then
another attempt for docking, etc.

In my opinion, JoT shouldn\'t be the all-powerful monstrosity that it is.
This keeps those JoTs in line, while allowing them some reasonable talent.
No one should make plans relying on the JoTs to come through in the clutch.

I\'ve only seen MT very briefly.  How do the rankings go?  (What is the
throw for Formidable?)  And what do people think of the "interrupt" idea?
I couldn\'t figure out what they had in mind.  Anyone want to explain how
interrupts work?

Question:  Do JoT skill levels directly transfer to other skills? 
           (i.e. JoT-3, means also Pilot-3, Pistol-3, etc...)
           I don\'t have any books with me, and I\'m playing the rules by memory,
           so can anyone help me.
This is obviously not true.  JoT is used as an aid to figure out how a thing
works or can be repaired, but it doesn\'t give you the skill itself.  The classic
use of Jot is to repair a broken piece of equipment.  For example, a person with
Electronics-3 could probably build a radio from spare parts, but a JoT could
never do this.  Both skills would apply toward figuring out how a given
radio worked or repairing the radio. In a dire life or death aliens at the 
door emergency, a referee might permit a JoT skill to be used for survival.
In this case a JoT-3 would probably be able to figure out how to pilot a
spacecraft, but would not have any skill in it i.e. he could probably fire
the engines and go in the right direction, but probably couldn\'t dock, skim
a gas giant for fuel, or land on a planet\'s surface.  Anything which
requires practice to get the skill does not fall under JoT i.e. weapons
skills, driving or piloting skills, etc.  As a referee, I would be reluctant
to even let him attempt to pilot a spacecraft except in a case where the
party was fried if they stayed were they were.  For example, if the party
lost its pilot and was headed on manuever drive out into deep space, I might
let the JoT be used to turn the ship around or jump to a system where a
pilot could be called in to take over.   JoT should primairly be used to fix
broken objects where the failure is obvious i.e. a short in a piece of
electric equipment.  Or in an emergency (i.e. life or death) it may be used
as a survival skill i.e. if you figure out how this works you live if not
you die then a JoT might be applicable (skill level should be about were
Capt. Kirk was with a stick shift).

Perhaps in some universes they are equivalent (no books handy here either)....

In my games it\'s 1/2 equivalent -- that is, JOT-3 gets you equivalent of
Pilot-1 (no 1/2s here), JOT-4 gets you Pilot-2, etc.

JOT is thus very useful, but *not* gross.  As the normal \'limit\' is -5 for a
skill, it is difficult for a JOT to become very skilled at anything -- but
they can *do* nearly everything.  This seems to be in the original spirit of
the character skill.

Subject: MegaTraveller vs. Traveller - Also A Product Request

     Someone else requested this and I\'m unsure if the report came
through because of mailer problems. Anyway, how does MegaTraveller
differ from Traveller? Should I be aware of any great and grave 
differences?

     I finally unpacked several things and found all my old Traveller
info. But, in searching through I find that I\'m a couple of Alien
modules behind. Did GDW pull them because of the release of
MegaTraveller? Also, the last book I was aware of was Book 6, but I saw
a reference for Book 8? Any info is cheerfully appreciated as I intend
to start the old campaign up again and would like to find out how far
I\'m behind.

Thanks to whomever can answer these questions,

Happy Trails,

There are Alien Modules 7, "Hivers", and 8, "Darrians". Book 7 is "Merchant
Prince", which gives a "High Guard" standard character generation system for
Merchants, as well as a flawed trade system (see below). Book 8 is "Robots",
and deals with robots as vehicles, giving a design and combat system; and as
characters.

Has anyone else noticed that the "Merchant Prince" system makes it almost
impossible (economically) to go from a low-tech world to a high-tech world?
Just how do high-tech industrial worlds like Efate get their food?
Speculative cargos:
Efate : A-D In Hi Cr2300 (4000 (Base)-1000 (In)-1000 (Hi)+1300 (TL-D)-1000)
			 	(A-class starport)----^
Knorbes:E-2 Ri Ag Cr7200 (4000 (Base)-1000 (Ag)+1000 (Ri)+200 (TL-2)+3000)
				(E-class starport)----^

Regular trade:
Efate (Pop 9, TL D) -> Knorbes (Pop 7, TL 2)
High passages: 3D-1D+13-2 = 8 (Minimum), 18 (Average)
Mid passages : 3D+13-2 = 14 (Minimum), 21 (Average)
Low passages : 5D+13-2 = 16 (Minimum), 28 (Average)     
All probably going to teach the ignorant (TL2) natives how to use the high-tech
machinery they just bought! :-)

Major cargos : 1D+5+13-2 = 17 (Minimum), 19 (Average)
Minor cargos : 1D+6+13-2 = 18 (Minimum), 20 (Average)
The major companies jumping on the bandwagon.

Knorbes -> Efate
High passages: 3D-2D+3+2-13 = 8 (Maximum), -4 (Averaeg)
Mid passages : 3D-1D+3+2-13 = 9 (Maximum), 0 (Average)
Low passages : 3D+3+2-13 = 10 (Maximum), 3 (Average)
Maybe the 3 low passengers got mugged.

Major cargos : 1D+3+1+2-13 = -1 (Maximum)
Minor cargos : 1D+4+1+2-13 = 0 (Maximum)
All the food Knorbes produces is now feeding the mass of immigrants.

And note that this system encourages mass migration from high tech worlds to
low tech worlds, whereas on Earth, now, the reverse is true, with Third World
immigrants coming to high(er) tech U.K. (for example).

> up to the level of JoT is an immensely powerful advantage.  Let\'s look at
> the numbers (you have to do it sometime!):

Charles has given a very persuasive and (in my opinion) compelling
argument for doing away with the MT method for handling JOT.  However,
I\'d be curious to see how the numbers crank out for one change in the
set of assumptions.

The change is this: Charles has assumed that any die roll (+DMs) may be
rerolled if it has failed, even in the cases of extreme failure and
fumble rolls (extreme failure is when you miss the throw by more than
two; ex: you need an 8+ and you throw a 5-; fumble means rolling a
natural 2 on two dice, and always fails: whether it\'s exceptional or
normal failure is determined normally, I think).  The rules imply this
assumption.  What if you only allow JOT retries if the failure was
normal? This way fumbles and exceptional failures terminate your chances
at JOT-style re-rolling.

Okay, let\'s crank out some numbers:

> In JTP\'s example, the hot pilot gets +4 to dodge asteroids (Pilot-3, Dex-
> terity 7).  In a Routine task (7+), odds are 35/36 (97%).

> The total novice (Dexterity 7) gets +1; dodging is Difficult (11+), so
> the odds are 6/36 (17%).

> The nimble novice with JoT-3 now gets [up to] 3 additional trials!  What are
> his odds?

They are 1 - (1 - odds for first trial) * (1 - odds for second trial) *
...  * (1 - odds for fourth trial).

Here\'s where we get tricky.  The odds for the first trial are 17%, as
above.  The odds for subsequent trials are 17% * (1 - odds for
exceptional failure or fumble in previous trial).  Since exceptional
failure or fumble occurs on a roll of 3 less than Difficult (11+) with
DM+1 (Dex 7) or less (natural 7-), the odds for exceptional failure are
21/36 = 58%.  Subsequently,

    odds for first trial = 17%
    odds for second trial = 17%*(1 - odds for failure) = 17%*(1-58%) = 7.1%
    odds for third trial = 17%*(1 - odds for failure)^2 = 17%*(1-58%)^2 = 2.9%
    odds for fourth trial = 17%*(1 - odds for failure)^3 = 17%*(1-58%)^3 = 1.2%

Hence,

	First Trial (unskilled): 1-(1-17%) = 17%
	Second Trial (JOT-1): 1-(1-17%)(1-7.1%) = 23%
	Third Trial (JOT-2): 1-(1-17%)(1-7.1%)(1-2.9%) = 25%
	Fourth Trial (JOT-3): 1-(1-17%)(1-7.1%)(1-2.9%)(1-1.2%) = 26%

Which is much better than with the non-restricted reroll:

>     1-(1-17%)**4 = 52%.

Here, JOT-N + unskilled is nowhere near as good as Skill-0.  Keep in
mind that this is a Difficult task.

> But wait!  What if our the novice had picked up Pilot-0 along the way?
> Then the task would be Routine (7+), DM+1, and the odds are 26/36 (72%).
> But he still gets four trys at it!

Okay.  The odds for the first trial are 72%, as above.  The odds for
subsequent trials are 72% * (1 - odds for exceptional failure or fumble
in previous trial).  Since exceptional failure or fumble occurs on a
roll of 3 less than Routine (7+) with DM+1 (Dex 7) or less (natural 3-),
the odds for exceptional failure are 3/36 = 8%.  Subsequently,

    odds for first trial = 72%
    odds for second trial = 72%*(1 - odds for failure) = 72%*(1-8%) = 66%
    odds for third trial = 72%*(1 - odds for failure)^2 = 72%*(1-8%)^2 = 60%
    odds for fourth trial = 72%*(1 - odds for failure)^3 = 72%*(1-8%)^3 = 55%

Hence,

	First Trial (Pilot-0): 1-(1-72%) = 72%
	Second Trial (JOT-1): 1-(1-72%)(1-66%) = 90%
	Third Trial (JOT-2): 1-(1-72%)(1-66%)(1-60%) = 96%
	Fourth Trial (JOT-3): 1-(1-72%)(1-66%)(1-60%)(1-55%) = 98%

Wow, slightly better than Pilot-3! In general here, JOT-N + Skill-0 is
slightly better than Skill-N, for a Routine task.

> But wait, there\'s more!  Suppose they are trying to fix the jump drive
> simultaneously.  The task is now Difficult (11+).

>     Pilot-3: DM+4, odds 21/36 = 58%.
>     Pilot-0, JoT-3: DM+1, odds 6/36 = 17%, after four tries 52%

We get after four tries 26%, which is better than the 17% Pilot-0 only
person, but not as good as Pilot-1 only (which is 27%).  Here, JOT-N +
Skill-0 is at least Skill-0 but not near as good as Skill-1; again, this
is a Difficult task.

With Charles\' assumptions: 

>     JoT-N is NOT EQUAL TO Anything-N; however JoT-N and Foo-0 is FAR
>     SUPERIOR to Foo-N normally, and ALMOST AS GOOD under stressful
>     circumstances.

With my restrictions (no retry on exceptional failure or fumble):

	JoT-N is NOT EQUAL TO Anything-N, unless the task is routine or
	simple; JoT-N and Foo-0 is about Foo-N for simple and routine
	tasks, only a little better than Foo-0 for harder tasks.

In this way, Jack-o-T can still be used even if you have skill in some
area, reflecting the general resourcefulness of these people.  It helps
anyone out alot for simple or routine tasks, but when the task becomes
difficult or formidable, the effect of Jack-o-T becomes much less.  I
feel that Jack-O-T should be useful in all situations a character should
encounter, not just those in which he is totally unskilled.

However, even with this (close) interpretation of the rules, JoT is
still overpowering for simple and routine tasks.  I would still not
relish refereeing a character with more than JoT-1.  They would be quite
a Mr.  Bond (James Bond).

The basic skill levels are:

	Simple		3+
	Routine		7+
	Difficult	11+
	Formidable	15+
	Impossible	--

No accumulation of DMs may exceed +/-8.  Skill level for a task usually
increases one level where there\'s a total lack of skill, unless the task
is marked "(unskilled OK)".  Lots more detail that I can\'t remember.

I haven\'t looked at interrupts that much, but as I understand it, at the
beginning of each combat round, each "side" has the ability to make one
interrupt.  Individuals on each side expend action points one-at-a-time
in strict order.  If the opposing side makes a single-action-point move
that is unfavorable to your side, you may expend your interrupt by
delaying the opponent\'s action while you make an action.  Hence you can
get a stack of interrupts.

This is supposed to be useful in "covering" a comrade; your comrade
moves out into the hallway, expending an action point.  Opponent
declares he\'s shooting at your comrade.  You declare an interrupt to
shoot first.  You shoot, THEN opponent shoots.

This doesn\'t always help: your comrade moves out into the hallway;
opponent declares he\'s shooting; you declare an interrupt to shoot
first; opponent\'s comrade declares an interrupt to shoot you.
Opponent\'s comrade fires, THEN you fire, THEN opponent fires.

As usual, I don\'t have my books with me, so this is from memory.

My edition 1 Traveller rules had a probability table for assigning randomized
"Jump Routes":

TRAVELLER, Volume 3, Copyright 1977 Game Designer\'s Workshop, page 2

	World	----Jump  Distance----
	Pair	Jump-1	Jump-2	Jump-3	Jump-4
	A-A	1	2	4	5
	A-B	1	3	4	5
	A-C	1	4	6	-
	A-D	1	5	-	-
	A-E	2	-	-	-
	B-B	1	3	4	6
	B-C	2	4	6	-
	B-D	3	6	-	-
	B-E	4	-	-	-
	C-C	3	6	-	-
	C-D	4	-	-	-
	C-E	4	-	-	-
	D-D	4	-	-	-
	D-E	5	-	-	-
	E-E	6	-	-	-

However, I have reservations in using such a simplistic and
non-deterministic system for generating Trade Routes.  Maybe something
that looks at at least Starport Class and Population, and maybe Trade
Classifications, too? With a great enough number of dependent variable,
the randomness could be almost done away with.

I think it would be an entertaining enterprise to try to come up with
such a scheme.  Perhaps something based on the average profit gain
between two systems, weighted by jump distance and surrounding worlds
(i.e. suppose one world provides a link across a great rift... even were
it Class D now, it would probably be a crucial trade route between the
societies on each side of the rift).

When I get a spare week or two I\'ll look at this item.  Maybe I\'ll come
up with something great and (after everyone on the list gets to alter
it, playtest it, add suggestions, etc.) send it off to the editors of
Challenge magazine as a definitive system for trade routes.  And maybe
I\'ll become President of the United States....  :-) I doubt I\'ll ever
find time to even start on this myself.  How about a communal effort?

Who, besides me, is dissatisfied with Traveller\'s handling of computers? I
have two main gripes.

First, hands up those who still believe Traveller\'s claim that hand/pocket
computers arrive at TL10. Now put down your hands, those who don\'t think today
is TL10, or TL9 at least. Why? Because I _have_ a pocket computer. O.K., so
it\'s not as powerful as a desktop computer, and pocket computers never will be
as powerful as desktop computers, because whatever high tech chips are used to
make the pocket computer powerful, more of the same can be used to make a more
powerful desktop machine. But mine has 32K RAM (expandable), and a built-in
programming language which is a cross between BASIC and PASCAL. And it can talk
to larger machines, if an RS232 interface (which the makers can supply) is
fitted.

Second, the table of computers in Book 5, High Guard, implies that as
technology advances, computers get larger, more powerful and more expensive.
Now it seems to me, in the real world, they either stay the same size and price
and get more powerful, or they get smaller and cheaper for the same price. Take
my pocket machine, for example; apart from display, it\'ll outclass a PET no
trouble; and what today fills a cabinet would previously have filled a room.
Also, High Guard mentions "fibre-optic backup". In modern computers, and
military ones especially, they use fibre-optics as the _primary_ connection.
Besides, wouldn\'t the radiation, which fib models are supposed to be proof
against, also zap the chips?

Now, my solutions. Pocket computers are available at TL8, for a few Cr100\'s.
I haven\'t worked out a way of translating present computer trends into High
Guard terms without making every published ship obsolete. After all, at TL15,
a Model 3 is probably desktop, and a Model 2 pocket-sized. But instead of "fib"
meaning "fibre-optic backup", it just means "backup", in the form of extra,
redundant components, e.g. processors. For damage purposes, I assume the
ship has two computers. When the computer is damaged, I roll 1D to decide
which one is hit, and always use the least damaged one for that ship\'s fire
modifiers.

Any comments? Am I overlooking something critical? How does MegaTraveller
handle computers?

Regarding "fibre-optic" backup, I read that as yet another unintentional 
mis-use of terminology (how many of you remember the article in an early
JTAS that had "copper-based hemoglobin"?)

I merely assume that the backup is "really" a backup computer based on
optical circuitry rather than electronic. They\'re starting to build
such stuff now (at about RTL logic equivalent).

Or they might be using TIMMS (Thermally Integrated Micro Modules?). These
are basicly the *tube* equivalent of integrated circuits. They\'re made
of ceramics and high temperature metals. No filaments or "heaters". You
put this "block in an oven and heat to a few hundred degrees! (these 
were used for radiation hardened equipment in the \'60s).

Neither of the above would pay much attention to radiation levels that
would kill the crew. BTW it isn\'t necessarily the EMP that kills semi-
conductor based equipment. Radaition does funny things to PN junctions.

As for the size/cost/etc of computers in Traveller, pay close attention
to just what their idea of a computer is. Even the "simple" programs are
more than I\'d care to try on even a 68000 or 80386 machine. Navigate is
doing *real-time* multi-body orbit and trajectory calculations involving
object that are manuvering under power. That ain\'t simple! Not to the
accuracy you need to keep from hitting another ship while making your approach
to the Starport.

Size has been argued before. much out it may merely be the space required to
let you get at it. Figure out how much space a "normal" PC takes up if you
include the desk and chair...

First as an historical aside.  At the time that Traveller was written about the
only computer I believe that Mark Miller had seen was an old Tandy with a
cassette tape drive (UGH).  It played a great dungeon game (which was
unwinable and I think Scott Renner wrote - he is occasionally seen on the
net out of UofI).  At any rate considering the inexperience of the developer
computers aren\'t bad in Traveller.  On the straight gaming side there was
also rules balancing to consider. 

My solutions to the computer problem were the following home rules:

Traveller Computers:

The current computers in traveller are rather over sized for what
they can do i.e. a computer today that can run only two programs
every ten minutes and can only store 4 more would, comfortably
fit inside a telephone, yet it takes one ton of space to do this
in Traveller.  With just the currently projected advances in
technology you will be able to compact computers even more. (Also
Traveller computers obviously have no concept of virtual storage,
concurrency, multiprogramming, or multiprocessing all of which add
up to allowing literally scores of programs to run at the same
time.  With these each program only needs a small portion of itself in
memory at any one time.  The number of programs running being
limited by the speed of switching programs, rate new pages are
needed, and secondary storage more than CPU memory size.)
Since the Traveller tech chart shows the level 1 computer as a
Tech Level 5 entity, we are going to assume that the chart on page
13, book two is the TL5 chart.  Because I find the CPU/storage
columns to be nonsense they will be combined into one column
(note that this eliminates the need to have bis models).  For each
odd TL above five the program capacity of the chart will be shift
down one rows i.e. model 2 program capacity will become model one
program capacity,  cost and space will be read as normal. 
On even TLs the cost can be cut by one third or the mass can be
halved.  Therefore the chart for TL11-12 is:
	model	price	mass	prog cap
	1	2	1	14
	2	9	2	27
	3	18	3	50
	4	30	4	70
	5	45	5	90
	6	55	5	110
	7	60	5	130
	Note that I decided to project the top of the chart at a constant
	20 programs.  I think for the time being we\'ll leave software as
	it is.  (I will accept comments and suggestions there though).

Any computer with a program capacity of 150 or greater can be
considered an artificial intelligence (AI cost is x3).  These
computers may replace their prog cap with skills at a ration of 1
skill for 15 programs (one skill must be the skill AI which
equates to a personality)(plus they will automatically have 1 skill at
ship maintenance and be able to function as a library).   AIs are
required to have a robot at their disposal and are considered to
have heat and vacuum sensors through out the ship (visual, hearing
and voice would be limited except by the presence of the robot,
maintenance senors would be placed where needed).  Ship specific
skills would be:  Predict, Gunnery (assumed equal to Gunner
Interact, Target, Launch, return fire, anti missile programs and a
Gunnery skill of 1), Select, Multi-Target, Maneuver/Evade, Jump
(includes Generate and Navigation programs), and Anti-Hijack.  All
these skills can be assumed to have the same effect as the best
equivalent book 2 page 12 software and may be chosen freely by
the player.  AI computers can also have any other skill (granted
many of them would be useless to the computer) available and can
be used to teach.  AI computers can not change skills once they
are chosen.  An AI computer (that is to say the ship) will not
necessarily do what it is ordered since it is a NPC (note ships are
considered to be phenomenally loyal to their owner (i.e. incapable
of treachery), but not without a sense of self preservation).  We
will deal with the problems this will entail, in the area of title
transfer, when we come to it.
	a. When starships are awarded to a player (when he musters
	out) a die is rolled and the TL of the computer is as
	follows 1 = TL9, 2,3,4 = TL11 5,6 = TL13.  Note: that you
	may buy a new higher TL computer to replace the one given.

That depends on which trading rules you are playing by. If you use "Merchant
Prince", the only decent trade routes are those with lots of A-class starports,
on Hi population planets, with roughly the same tech level. Try a tour of the
Vegan Autonomous district, in Solomani Rim sector. I have a ship doing so right
now, and it\'s about to emerge a multi-millionaire!

If you use the speculative rules in Book 2, you get much more satisfactory
conclusions. The obvious trade route is between Agricultural and Industrial
worlds, and this is rewarded in the Book 2 system. The only problem is, the
availability of cargoes is too random. You are quite likely to go to the
Agricultural world, only to find that the only cargo available is Machinery, or
something equally useless.

If you use the regular cargo and passenger tables from Book 2 or Merchant Prince
then again, stick to high population worlds. Starport class doesn\'t feature
here, but tech level may (I disregard TL modifiers for these charts, otherwise
I can never visit lower tech agro worlds).

Now for another question. Book 2 mentions mail briefly. Under "Revenues", it
says "Mail  Cr25000 (if fitted). How does an honest merchant get mail fitted?

I believe that Traveller computers are not all that far off base.  I use the
following rationaliztions to make sense of the following rules, and negate the
objections to the rules:

Computers too big:  When you consider the cumputer as the major or entire
control system of the ship, spread throughout the ship, with only the
traditional computer components: CPU, Memory, Console, storage, printout, at
the bridge, the size of compters makes more sense.  The size of the fiber optic
computers I rationalize as the "fiber optic" setup being as it states, a *"back
up"*, in addition to the normal computer.  It is stupid, if there are no
drawbacks, to use the FO only as backup, but I believe this is a rule whose
purpose is to make FOC special items.

Computers run too few programs:  These programs are massive **realtime** sensor
and simulation programs.  You are comparing these to batch or timesharing
programs.   You can only get a given number of MIPS out of a box, no matter how
you slice it.

Ooops! My message filter was broken last month, so messages sent to the
traveller mailing list got eaten (programmer error, again...  I really
must be more careful).  Somebody sent a message on the 3rd and somebody
else on the 8th of March, and they both failed.  I think one of them was
even mine!

Hopefully it is fixed now (if you get this message, it really is fixed).

Sorry,

Sometime back, I seem to remember that someone mentioned they were either
starting, or thinking of starting, a play-by-mail traveller scenario.
Well, if anyone is, I sure would like to hear more on the subject!

  Hello all.  I hope this is not a repeat, but I finally got MT, and I wanted
to compare notes.

  General system:looks cleaned up to a great degree.  As the recent scuffle of
jack of all trades shows, they are not completely clear, but they seem to be
better than all of the stuff I used formerly.

Now for the caveats:
  Did anyone proofread this puppy?  It seems like an inordinate number of
tables and charts are just plain wrong.  First example:

  Merchant prince character generation:I was unable to find the specialty
schools referred to in the rules.  I found them in my merchant rince rulebook,
and they worked, but this is a disturbing table to be missing.

  Second BIG feature:hit charts for beam weapons.  I think they flipped the
numbers on most of the table.  WHY is it harder to hit with a factor 9 beam
than a factor 1 beam?  Or have I got this reversed...

  Second problem:why would one ever want to buy fusion guns over plasma guns?
 They cost more, use more power, and take more guns to give the same factor at
a given tech level.  Am I missing something, like a plus one or two on the
damage tables?

  What are the special effects, if any, of antimatter missles?

  How does one use a white globe?

Did they flip the signs on the reulsor table against missles?

   A question:  Should not a higher tech level be able to produce smaller
drives?  I wonder why a tech 15 jump or manuver unit takes up the same space
and power as a tech 11, or a tech 21 setup.  This seems odd...


  Big caveats for the moment...  As I keep looking and using, I will see what
else I can come up with.  Any help on calling these would be appreciated.  In
geberal, it looks like a clean system, but who can tell.

Still too much old stuff.  Yes, they are better than the old stuff,
but they are still worse than almost everyone elses.  I personally
used GURPS rules instead of MT\'s.

   I think that the beam weapon chart is a typo.
   I believe fusion gun have some pluses to do damage.

>  What are the special effects, if any, of antimatter missles?
   Some people say that it\'s just like nuclear missle but cannot be block
out except by proton screen.  I don\'t believe that.  The cost and the
fact that a special screen has been designed for it\'s use indicates 
that it\'s much more potent than that.  Remember, fission, or even fusion,
comsumes a very very small portion of matter.  With antimatter, almost
all matters are converted into energy.

>  How does one use a white globe?
   It is supposed to be just like the black globe except it does not
impede anything from coming out.  I don\'t think it\'s resonable.  
a thing cannot absorb and giving off energy at same time.
I would treat it as a force shield and requires HEFTY amount of
power to operate.  Of course, the A/M powerplants provide the extra
power.

>Did they flip the signs on the reulsor table against missles?
   I guess so.

>drives?  I wonder why a tech 15 jump or manuver unit takes up the same space
>and power as a tech 11, or a tech 21 setup.  This seems odd...
   I thought it\'s unreasonable too.  
   Another thing about the table.. I would prefer them to give out formulas
instead of tables.  Some tables are just a waste of space.  

The rule for shipbuilding is decent, but it does take a lot of work.
One thing I noticed is that some new factors are useless.
Like the hull cripples/ destroyed points.  No where in the rule
says anything about it.  

The combat is almost unchanged from High Guard.  I think it\'s time for
something new.  One thing I don\'t  like is the factors.  I prefer 
a more linear system of factors.  How do you know just how powerful
is a factor T meson gun is comparing to a factor 4 laser?  The differece
may be thousands of times... I think the factor system should be dropped

The Imperial Encyclopaedia is especially bad.  It is useless.  It does not
give enough information about the game world, and those information it
does give are too fragmentory and incoherent to use.  A lot of stuffs
are just lifted from the ancient Traveller.  It\'s time for something newer.
Traveller 2300 is much more coherent, and playable, than the much more
expansive MT.  

I am very disappointed in this. The Travaller game world is THE best
in the SF genre, yet GDW produce this junk for all its potencial. 
MT is fit only as a reference book- and not very good one at that.
Over all, I am very disappointed.

I was in the bay area (San Francisco for you non locals) a couple
weekends ago and next door to my hotel was a game store that impressed
me.  They had almost all the Traveller supplements along with most of
the megatrav stuff.  There was even a used book rack with used trav
books.  Along with that they had an outstanding assortment of other
role playing games.  There were also alot of games I had never heard
of. 

Anyway, this is not so much a plug as a referral source for any of you
who can\'t find something, out-of-print or whatever reason.  They said
they would do a mail order.  The store is: 

                        Gamescape

  Do they do miniatures? Specifically, do they sell 15mm Zhodani miniatures?
  Do they allow overseas mail order (e.g. by Visa)?

Yes they have a large (although not extensive) collection of 
miniatures.  I am in L.A. and can\'t easily check out the store as 
it\'s not local.  I do not know if they would do an overseas ship, but 
I suggest you write or call them if you have specific questions.  

They did NOT have a catalog when I was there, but the salesperson said 
they were considering it.  I guess the rub here is that you need a 
pretty good idea of what you want in order to but it there.

Sorry this doesn\'t help much.

(You are in a twisty maze of line eater food, all different...)	

Has anyone tried to improve Traveller\'s (or MegaTraveller\'s) character
generation system?  I do not like Traveller\'s system and think MegaTraveller\'s
system is poor also.  Since I think the rest of the game is pretty good, 

I am thinking about ripping out the official character generation
system and replacing it.  The new generation system would create characters
similar to the old one, so no other rules would need to be changed.
	
Has anyone tried this before?  Has anyone thought about this?  If so,
please email me any ideas you have.  If I ever create anything interesting,
I\'ll post it....

P.S. I have the character generation system posted by "redden@trwrb" in Jan.

Here\'s an article asking a question about Merchant Prince Trade I picked
up on rec.games.frp, and I thought I\'d forward it to the Traveller
Mailing List to see if anyone could help this guy out.  A partial reply
to his question also appeared in rec.games.frp, and that message is
included too.

I can\'t give my two cents since I left my MegaTraveller set at home, but
personally I think the Trade system has major problems.  Traders that
frequent a world should be able to bid on an win contracts for Cargo
delivery, learn more about places to find best quality items or lowest
prices, develop a reputation for business, or if they are a subsidized
merchant probably have a central cargo clearinghouse membership for
which their subsidizing government can pay a fee, etc.  Also the
inability for low tech agro worlds to economically sell agro goods to
high tech industrial worlds is a major stumbling block, as is the fixed
amount of available cargo and passengers (among many others).  That\'s
enough flaming editorial for now.

I have a question about Traveller (Merchant Prince).

To determine how much cargo is available for a Free Trader 
to pick up, you are supposed to roll on a table to 
determine the amount of \'Major\' \'Minor\' and \'Incidental\'
cargo available.

My question is:  What is the difference?  Does Major cargo
come in 10 ton units or something?  If not, there could never
be more than say 20-30 tons of cargo available at even the
most populated worlds.  Doesnt fill up much of the 80+ tons
of cargo space in a standard Free Trader.  Whats the deal?

Please respond by e-mail.  I never get any.

In MegaTraveller, major is 1d+10, minor is 1d+5, and incidental is 1d.  You can 
also get a number of each size cargos depending on your rolls of availability.
The numbers generated are tons of cargo.

HI Everyone;

    Does anyone have any errata for Megatraveller? I have a friend who 
purchased it but we have yet to see anything about corrections from GDW.
I was thinking possibly the next issue of Challenge but it take a while for
them to get up north here. 

    We haven\'t tried MegaT yet but it looks as if it will be interesting 8-)

    Also does anyone have any further rules for doing trade. Ideally, 
trade should be similar to what happens at a shipyard. Does anyone know if
free trading (similar to what we have in Traveller) is allowed in the world
today? I would like to get more information and maybe start working on a 
better system of trade between planets. 

    This should be enough. Good Travelling!

Long time ago when GDW started publishing their support material
for Traveller, it was a rather interesting world they portrayed.
The Spinward Marches was a rough and ready frontier, where a man
had to rely on himself. Sure, there were a few high-population
worlds where you could relax and have city-type adventures, but in
the low-pop. systems  -  The Outback, as it were  -  you were on
your own; the navy had a few Kinunir and Gazelle class starships,
but mostly you had only your own wit and skills to pit againt evil
pirates and whatnot. There were a lot of cracks for these pirates
and other malcontents to hide in, and a looseness about the whole
setup that allowed PCs plenty of scope to right (or commit) wrongs,
explore near-empty star systems and generally have a good time.

Then "Azhanti High Lightning" and later "Fighting Ships" told us
about the juggernauts of the Imperial fleet: 60.000 T ships by
the gross, 100 and 200.000 T ships by (at least) the dozen. Why,
then, don\'t they buy one less dreadnaught and enough Kinunirs
to put a couple in each starsystem, thus ending piracy forever?
Later "Trillion Credit Squadron" told about how to finance the
fleet and "Fifth Frontier War" showed more than a 100 trillion
credit squadrons in the sector (propably many more, since the
map only shows some of the sector, and some ships presumably
are held back to protect the rimward part of it). And on top of
this comes the civillian shipping. With the assumption that
goods must be moved around to pay for all theese warships, I
once calculated the trade tonnage in Glisten subsector to
48 *million* tons! And Glisten is a comparativly low-population
subsector...

It\'s those high-population worlds that does it. Look at Mora, a
world with 10 billion people. According to "Trillion..." each
contributes Cr 500 per year to the naval budget. That\'s Cr
5.000.000.000.000 (five *trillions*). Naval investments are
equal to 10 times the yearly budget; so Mora alone can finance
*fifty* squadrons. Of course, some of that will have to be used
on local planetary defenses. Anybody want to calculate the
number of meson cannons you can buy for a third of fifty
trillion credit?

And dare I mention that there are three more high-population worlds
with a total population of thirty billion in Mora subsector ?

If we use the rules in "Striker" we get a slightly smaller figure:
a yearly budget of "only" 3,08 trillion Cr. Of this, a mere 30% goes
to the Imperium (and how many meson guns can Mora get for the
remaining 70%?), giving us a paltry 9 trillion credit squadrons
with a little bit left over. But this is only after a long
period of peace, where the military budget is 1% of the gross
national product. In times of war that figure can be raised to
15 times that or 45+ squadrons.

Can this universe be saved?

I have some requirements of my Traveller campaign. Mostly they
are concerned with keeping things reasonably close to the
original concepts:

1) Starships are expensive, but not totally beyond the means of
   a determined, adventuresome and lucky group.

2) Some worlds has a reasonably high volume of traffic; the navy
   are present here and piracy, if not entirely impossible,
   depends on stealth and audacity, rather than brute force. But
   others are small out-of-the-way frontier planets where anything
   can happen  -  and usually does (da-da-da-DAH!)

3) The size of and demands on the navy makes it impractical to
   maintain navy ships in the small star-systems. The navy con-
   centrates on the important worlds and make do with irregular
   patrol sweeps at the others.

I have some ideas for patches, but I would like to hear your
reactions before I say more. Am I talking sense? Or through my
hat? Do you have any ideas or suggestions?

Without the rules and a calculator,  I\'m not sure if the money you\'re talking
is several orders of magnitude higher than it "should be."  If it isn\'t, don\'t
forget that the tax money has to pay for:

Salaries
Maintenance
Command facilities and employees
Spare parts
Fuel
Military pensions
Military hospitals
Research
Recruitment
"ROTC" programs
(lots of other things)

and not just for equipment.  That 10x annual figure in equipment value seems
excessive.

Throw in some graft,  political lobbying costs,  advertising,  losses to
pirates,  and the like,  and hopefully you can justify significantly lower
values of ships actually in service.

Hello TML!

Here\'s some mail that got sent to me from someone whom I don\'t think is
on the list.  We\'ll help him out as best we can, and I\'ll try to recruit
him to the list :-).

In answer to his question, a 5 minute search through my MegaTraveller
set only revealed some of the information, in the Imperial Encyclopedia
book.  It mentions an ammo weight and ammo cost (appears to be a small
energy clip of some kind, presumably), but nowhere in the Neural Weapons
description does it explain what the "ammo" is referring to.  Looks like
another situation where creative refereeing will win the day.

	I agree that there were "too many" ships involved in the war.
	I can only assume this is because other portions of the
	Imperium (and its opposition) are supporting this front, and
	that it must be considered "key" because of four major races
	holding it in contention (Zhodane, Imperium, Aslan, and Vargar)
	as a stepping stone for greater advancement in the region.

	If I remember (and I don\'t have the books with me), population
	is the only thing used as a modifier for GPP.  I was a little
	dissatisfied, because looking at our world, it is also clear
	that tech level, government type, and law level play major
	roles in determining per capita income, GPP, and military
	spending.

	A tech level 3 world is going to have a smaller GPP than a
	comparable tech level 10 world.  And, because it is going to
	spend more time worrying about feeding and sheltering its
	people, a smaller percentage of its GPP is going to be
	available to be skimmed off by the Imperial, Sector, and
	Subsector defenses.  (There\'s NO WAY a country like Afganistan,
	whose per capita income is $400 odd dollars,  can support a tax
	of $500 a head.)

	Similarly (and I\'ll try not to get into any political debates),
	certain governments promote production better than others.
	Other governments (notably captive governments) are likely to
	produce less.

	Law level should also be used a a modifier.  A very high law
	level means a higher spending percentage by the military.  A
	very low law level means a lower spending percentage.

	Another thing that both rule sets seem to overlook is that the
	highest cost incurred by the military (and by most large
	endeavors), is personell.  A fleet can\'t be run without trained
	people (ah, er, well, even robots cost money and maintenance),
	and trained people imply salaries, trainers, support personell,
	etc.  I\'d *guess* anywhere from a very efficient wartime 10
	times crew salaries to a top heavy 25+ times crew salaries
	during peace time (you could also say 1/5 to 1/20 of the budget
	is actually used on ships).  If the entire military budget of
	Moria is used on hardware, you may indeed have 50 squadrons,
	but if no one is there to use or maintain them, a scout ship
	with a laser could disable them all.

	I\'ve played a little with all of the above as modifiers, and
	while I haven\'t done the research to make it "right", things do
	seem to look "better".

		-Rob.

Today marks the first anniversary of the Traveller Mailing List.  One
year ago today I posted a message to rec.games.frp asking if people
would be interested in a mailing list to discuss Traveller, and here we
are!

Greetings travelers,
  I have a few questions for anyone out there, they are relayed from
the GM of one of my traveler games.  Also is a suggestion for an addon 
to prospecting skill.  These quotes and questions are taken from the 
first printing of the megatraveller players and referees manuals.

In beltstrike it is stated that 1 person can load 2 tons of ore in the 
  course of 1 watch (6 hours).  
It is suggested that in Megatrav: To mine an asteroid for 1 KG of a 
  raw ore it should be considered a routine task with DM\'s for 
  Prospecting and Dex, and a duration of 1 hour.

Questions from the referees manual:
- -) On page 13 the bottom of the left column under Fateful, second 
paragraph.  Sentence 1 states a fateful task failure causes a 2D roll 
on the mishap table.  Sentence 2 guarantees these mishaps.  The last 
sentence of this paragraph states "If the task is listed as fateful 
(but not hazardous), implement a superficial mishap: no mishap roll is 
required." 
  Anyone know if we should mishap roll when a fateful task is failed?

- -) Refer to page 15 in the general damage and repair tables.  The book 
states "The ""field"" is any location without shop facilities of an 
adequate tech level."  We have shops on our ships, but the question is 
"is the shop onboard of an \'adequate tech level\'?

Questions from the players manual:
- -) See Medical skill and Assessing damage.  What is the difference 
between a wound and an injury?  Which is more realistic for how long 
to treat?

- -) See page 30, right column skill list.  The admin discussion of 
avoiding close inspection of papers is a simple skill with DM\'s for 
admin and legal BUT the legal skill (defined on page 36) also serves 
as Adimn minus 1.  The question is "if I only have legal 2 and want to 
avoid close inspection of papers, do I get a +3 DM?"  If I have a 
legal 3 can I not fail a routine roll in a no law, without a fumble?

The DM from my game would appreciate any responses to these 
statements,questions from anyone out there.

I have one observation of my own, with regards to using experience.  I 
I do not have a skill at even level 0, and I watch someone use that 
skill.  I can attempt a difficult roll to gain experience for that 
skill.  Then, if I succeeded with that roll, I can attempt that skill 
for myself, this time as routine (without the experience roll this 
roll would be difficult).  If by some luck I roll 12 I may get 
an AT for a skill I don\'t have.  I sort of like this, but it doesn\'t 
sound right.  Of course if I miss all these rolls I could always try 
JOT.

Thanks for any and all responses,

I have been informed by the powers-that-be at Tektronix that AT&T will
no longer be forwarding mail through ihnp4, unless it is directed to an
employee of AT&T.  They\'ve probably done this so as to stop having to
act as a major hub of USENET, thus reducing their costs.

This change probably won\'t effect most of you, but those of you using
ihnp4 in mailing paths who are not employees of AT&T should try to find
an alternate route.  I suggest looking at another major node (uunet,
decvax, or gatech) for your forwarding instead.

Hello Everyone! Here Goes:
 
Would anyone like to play an email game of Fifth Frontier War? It seems like
a perfect game for gamemastered pbem. My copy is two hundred miles from me
right now, but as soon as I get it I would like to play and/or gamemaster
a game.
 
Regarding \'Can This Universe Be Saved?\' I haven\'t really liked the space
combat systems presented since Book 2. I liked the vectors! Now combat seems
to be just a lot of dice rolling with the winner usually being the one with
the right combination of defensive screens and offensive weapons that the
other ship can\'t screen. What is it like in Trav:2300 or MT? Of course I
don\'t really like playing once ships get bigger than say the Broadsword
class. Give me a Scout Ship anyday. The big ships are fine for boardgames,
but they take too much time away from roleplaying I think.
 
Has there ever been a computer program written for keeping track of basic
starship financial operations? I started one once in Basic no less, but I
don\'t have Merchant Prince, 2300, or MT. What would be the best combination
of current rules for running a free trader or up to a 800 ton cargo ship?
 
Has anyone out there ever run The Traveller Adventure? I recently found a
cheap used copy of it and was considering running it. Are there any major
errata? It looks like it will make the Referee job a lot easier.

  New typos found in rules:

  1.  it is impossible to construct a ship with an armor factor of 9 by the new
rules.

  2.  Unless you only plan to run a meson screen for a few minutes a day, don\'t
even bother installing one.  They demand FAR too many megawatts per cubic meter
to run.  Try dropping the power requirement by a factor of 10 or so

- --note:doesn\'t it seem odd that a higher tech civilization can\'t produce
versions of lower tech things that do more damage and the weigh less?

  3.  Errors corrected in charts of fusion weapons
    {details posted later if anyone is interested}

  I am thinking of cutting fuel consumption by a factor of two or three on the
power plants; this would put them approximately equal to old book two/five
designs.

  4.  Correct me if I am wrong; a white globe is visible, unlike a black globe.
 It blocks all energy heading in, like a black globe, and one\'s own weapons and
movement are not impeded while it is on.

  Has anyone gotten around to proofing the charqacter generation system yet?
 I only noticed a missing chart in the merchant prince section, but I have not
been very thorough.

  A final note:I am hoping to redesign the system around a percentile scale,
with player skills running from 0 to 50, and the task profiles giving the odds
of doing a particular task (e.g, roll over 5 percent to do a routine task, over
80 to do one of the difficult ones, and over 130 for an almost impossible one.
 Add skill)

  This would help in that then one can have skills altering during play without
upsetting game balance, and one can have a greater variety of skills \'in the
works\'

  See y\'all around

"Would anyone like to play an email game of Fifth Frontier War? It seems like a
perfect game for gamemastered pbem. My copy is two hundred miles from me right
now, but as soon as I get it I would like to play and/or gamemaster a game." 

I\'d be interested in either a Trillion/Billion Credit Squadron Game, or
Fifth Frontier War.  I have both games.

Has anybody thoroughly looked at the Mega Traveller rules. It seems that 
somebody forgot to check them before printing them. Autorifles can engage 2
targets but assault rifles can engage only 1. same for ACRs. Library book
has no entry for \'recording equipment\'. The fuel on the Type S and Type J
seems more likely to last 300/900 rather then 30/90. The tech level 12
Merc. Cruiser with J-3, 3-g goes to a TL15 J-1,1-g!
I wrote to GDW months back for erratta but no response. Anybody else having the
same problem? As is I\'m still using High Guard for starship combat. 
Speaking of which it mentions that if you get a bridge hit you can transfer 
control to emer. bridge but it doesn\'t till you how to build the bridge 
much less the emer. bridge.

Imperial naval forces at the start of the war consisted of 2 battle squadrons,
6 cruiser squadrons and 1 assault squadron, plus 16 assorted colonial
squadrons of varying type and quality. (From "Fifth Frontier War" Imperial
Order of Battle.) Many of the colonial squadrons were cruiser squadrons with
0 attack factor, which I take to mean they were the <1000 ton patrol cruisers
of various forms. Some are less powerful than scout squadrons! Zhodani forces
were much larger, which isn\'t surprising as they were attacking, and had
brought up their forces from all over the Consulate. When the Imperium did
likewise (reinforcements), they got a lot more. Incidentally, the Aslan weren\'t
involved unless you assume some of the mercenary units are Aslan. And where did
the TL16 battalion come from?

I do have the books here - Striker Book 2 (p.38) and Trillion Credit Squadron
(p. 31).
Striker: GNP=Pop. * Base GNP * trade class modifier
Base GNP comes from a table based on TL, which works out as 2000*(TL-4).
Trade class modifiers are: Rich 1.6; Industrial 1.4; Agric.  1.2
			   Poor 0.8; Non-ind.   0.8; Non-Ag. 0.8
Military budget=GNP * (3% normally; varies between 1% and 15%)

T.C.S.: Naval tax = 500 * Govt. modifier * population

Both systems have tables for converting local currency to Imperial currency,
based on TL and starport type. The tables are not the same!

So, use the Striker system, but with the T.C.S. government modifiers.

Not necessarily. Efate/Regina has law level 0, but "Fifth Frontier War" gives
it a battle squadron, a cruiser, and a large army.

Agreed. And in T.C.S., what about starports? Can one upgrade them? For how
much?

I ran TTA about two years ago. Yes, it does make the job a lot easier. The
book is divided into a lot of small adventures, actually very much like a
mystery novel where you are fed small pieces of information and clues until
you finally grasp what is going on. The adventure, or rather the adventures
are quite good and you really don\'t have to do much work for a year or so. 

There are no actual errors in the book, or at least not many, but you have to
adjust the adventures to your campaign anyway. First of all there is a lot of
side stories beside the major story so you have to plan ahead maybe two or
three adventures all the time. If you have a campaign of your own going on,
maybe you want to use TTA as a part of that. In that case you really must
consider which equipment and characters you must bring into, or out of your
campaign before you can begin with TTA.

My advice to you is that you should read the book through at least two times.
When you have done that you can draw a plan over which adventures you are going
to run in which order. You will probably have to make one or two adventures
of your own based on the information from the book halfway through the story,
or you can play them by the seat of your pants, so to speak. All depends on
how much work you want to put into the story.

So, sure, use it. Your players will certainly appreciate it, or at least the
rewards if they manage to solve the problem without getting killed.

    'body' => '
The backbone of communication throughout the Imperium (and other large states)
is the X-boat network. Now we all know how this works: X-boats carry messages
between worlds with suitable stations, scout/couriers take the messages from
such worlds to those without stations, and X-boat tenders transfer messages
between X-boats, as well as refuelling and maintaining them, and providing
for their crews. What I haven\'t seen anywhere is how an Imperial citizen (i.e.
your PC) uses the X-boat network. Specifically, how much will it cost you to
send a message, and how long will it take to arrive? Here are my answers; any
comments (including alternatives) welcome.

Cost:	Cr10 per page of pure text
	Cr20 per page including pictures (pictures take up more computer space,
	     and require higher quality output devices. You also pay the higher
	     rate if you want high quality documents at the other end.

Cost multiplied by:
	* 5  for message encryption using civilian cypher
	*10  for message encryption using military cypher
	* 1  (1-9 jumps)
	* 2  (10-99 jumps)
	* 3  (100-999 jumps)

Civilian cypher provides protection against such things as industrial
espionage, and a limited degree of personal privacy. Limited, to the extent
that the local government can easily decode it if it wishes.

Military cypher provides total protection against all except Imperial
interception. It is often used by megacorporations, as other megacorporations
are often quite capable of breaking civilian cypher. However, in addition to
the higher fee, a permit to use military cypher is often required, especially
by high law level worlds, who may even require to see a copy of the text in
plain language.

Time delay:
	7 days per X-boat jump
	+2D + (log(no. of jumps)) - 10 days for random transition delays
	+4D days per link by scout/courier

Once an X-boat arrives in system, the tender will usually have the message
transferred to another X-boat and on its way within 1-2 hours (according to
Supplement 7). Assuming another boat is waiting, of course. And assuming no
delays of any other sort. Hence the "random transition delay".
Messages to be transferred by scout/courier will usually be delayed until the
ship is available, and until enough messages have accumulated for a jump to be
worthwhile. Delays aren\'t usually more than 3-4 weeks (Supplement 7 again).

Example:
I want to send a message to another world which is not on the network, but the
nearest station is 2 parsecs from it, and 8 X-boat jumps away from me. I am at
an X-boat station. I have 2 pages, text only, and I don\'t care how it looks at
the other end. The message is private, but not top secret, so I\'ll uses the
civilian cypher.
Cost: 2 * 10 * 5 * 1 = Cr100 (2 pages @ Cr10 each, * 5 (cypher) * 1 (not more
			      than 10 jumps).
Time: 7 * 8 + (2D + 0 - 10) + 4D
Roll 2D for a 6, so random delay = 6 + 0 - 10 = -4 -> 0, i.e. no unexpected
holdups.
Roll 4D for 19. The courier is a bit late.
So my message will arrive in 75 days time.

Hi.  I new to the list.  If you want to E-mail me personally, my net
address is:

	tektronix!fpssun!spock

My actual name is Richard Johnson.

Now that\'s out of the way, Do any of you use programs at home (other
than those available from the list archive), and what computers are
they running on?  Maybe we can work out some arrangement to distribute
among ourselves rather than duplicate effort.  This would especially
help me since I have none yet...

- ---- New topic ----

I have been running a fairly successful campaign under the original rules
with about six friends.  Two of them were always playing, and even asked
for additional time.

About two months ago, I tried introducing the team to Megatraveller, by 
creating new characters and running a simple adventure.  It did not go
real well. One of the two "regulars" became disheartened and did not role
play well; she has since refused to have anything to do with Traveller of
(oops) or .. Megatraveller.  She says she "might" consider playing again
if I figure out a way to bring her old characters into the new campaign.

Other players have not been so adversely affected; most don\'t really see
such a big change in the rules, and in some cases prefer the new (I think
cleaner) system.

I have a vested interest in keeping this particular player in the campaign
(she has been a close friend for many years, and now it\'s about the only
time we get together...).  Yet, I don\'t want to destroy a new campaign
by bending to player will at the outset.  Neither is it desirable to destroy
the campaign by letting her exclude herself (she has "pull" with many of
the other players).

Any suggestions?

Thanks.
Richard

     Traveller has been continuously in print for the last ten years, with 
new support material ever since  Adventure 1: The Kinunir.  However, a 
common complaint was that the universe was too static, and the differences 
between advanced (book 4-7) and basic (book 1, supplement 4) characters were
too great for existance in the same system.  Add to this two different ship
design systems, a very obscure vehicle design system (in a set of miniatures
rules), and many useful variants printed in a single article in the Journal of
the Traveller\'s Aid Society, GDW decided to rework the system so as to make it 
more coherent, easier to find specific rules, and a single skill use system.
The end result of this project was Megatraveller.  There are a few problems, 
though with the system as it now stands.  I for one would like to see a FULLY
illustrated ship design example, as some of the tables have typos, and/or are
a bit unclear to make use of.  Similarly, the Merchant Advanced character 
tables are missing the special assignment tables from Merchant Prince, and the 
different mustering out tables for each type of merchant line.  There are typos
in other character generation tables too.  I expect a MegaTraveller Errata/
Examples/Index book would be something of an eagerly awaited release from GDW.
A thourough debugging may have been delayed by the desire to have the books 
ready as a tenth anniversary release, but should have been done nevertheless.

Greetings and Salutations,

   Here is one of my few and far between postings.
While running through the MegaTraveller Basic Mainworld Generator I came across
something I didn\'t understand, to wit:  step 14--Population Multiplier.  This
procedure generates a random number from 0 to 9...but what is it FOR?  I can
find nothing in the text to explain it.  I had one suggestion that it was for
pupulation increases for the planet.  Does anyone know if this is true?
And if so, so what?  I can\'t imagine a campaign lasting however many
years/decades/centuries it would take for this to become significant to the
game.  Any thoughts/opinions on this?

    I agree with Paul <rocchi@viebmef> that many of us are eagerly awaiting
Errata, etc.  Has anyone heard if/when something like that will be out?

The only thing I can think of is the obvious: that since the population UPP
digit is the exponent of the population, representing values of 10, 100, 1000,
10 000, 100 000, 1 000 000, etc., the population multiplier allows you to be
more fine-grained: 10 000, 20 000, 30 000, 40 000, etc.  I don\'t plan to use
it for population increases; just as a finer-grained measurement of
population.

Going along with this finer-grained idea: suppose I am an administrator that
wants to tax a planet by population.  Since 2x10^8 is twice as many people as
1x10^8, I\'d prefer to know the population by exponent plus one significant
digit!  Also might help out Trillion Credit Squadron rules.

Hi there everyone.  Haven\'t seen much in the way of discussion of Traveller
2300 here, but James said it was within the context of the mailing list, so..

I\'m playing a character in Traveller 2300 from the Canadian colony of Doris.
I read the description of the Doris system and created a graphic summary
sheet, using "Adobe Illustrator" on a Mac II.  Is anyone interested in a
copy of said document?  If you ask nice, I might even mail you a hardcopy
version printed on a LaserWriter II :-).  The two versions I have are:

The first file is the straight Adobe Illustrator file, which is only readable
if you have a copy of Illustrator, I believe.  The second file is an EPSF file,
which is quite portable -- even to IBM PC type things.

If there\'s incredibly overwhelming interest [like, on order of a billion
pieces of mail] I\'ll mail it to the entire list.

Hi,

   Concerning your question about bending the rules:

   This question really goes to the heart of roleplaying games and
their purpose.  RPG\'s (including Traveler/MegaT) are a forum for
improvisational theater amongst the players (who have one actor each)
and the GM (who has the rest of the actors in the universe).  Always
keep in mind that the reason for the game is for the entertainment of
everyone concerned.  Perhaps the most satifying thing for me as a GM
has been to hear players tell "war stories" of their adventures in my
games - it means they really "lived" their characters.

   The rules (and aids like maps) are merely a framework to aid the
actors (including you) in feeling comfortable in the universe you
create.  My advice is to flat-out disregard the rules when necessary
and do what you think is best.  This will give you more freedom in
dealing with the players - but make it clear to the players that *you*
are the arbiter of the universe.  Nothing is so boring as a rules
argument.  The play is the thing.

   Were I you, I\'d let your friend in with her old character, and work
out accomodations with your other players so they\'re happy too.

This is a followup to Brian Jarvinen

I am interested in a pbm game of Fifth Frontier War.  I  had conversations
with Mr. Baranski he and I were working out the last details of how to do
it when he had to bow out.  I can send you the material we had worked on
if you\'re interested.  I tried to email this to you directly but "nosc"
doesn\'t know who you are. Please try to contact me via email.

Well, let\'s hope somewhere in this mail giberish there\'s a decent mail path.
All I know is that you have to get to DECWRL somehow.

I\'m looking forward to playing FFW, but at the present point in time, I have no
place to set up a board.

I received an inquiry from Jim (is that the right first name?) Baranski about
playing Fifth Frontier War. However I was unable to send him mail directly.
I don\'t think I will be able to participate in a game with him unless I find
a different adress for him. Any ideas? Could you please forward this to him,
without sending it to the whole list?
 
Also, I currently have set up a three player game of FFW with Adrian Hurt,
MC Grew (Charles?), and Jim something at U of Florida (jco@ufl....). I also
saw the request posted to the list by Kurt Staiger, and have contacted his
(him) with regards to this situation. Anyway, would you like me to post a
running account of the upcoming game? I could post once a week, say a week
after I resolve a turn and report it to the players. I could do this in
Traveller News Service style I guess. What do you think? (Oh, by the way I
am gamemastering said game).

Thanks to all of you who suffered (along with me) through
the electronic chaos here to reply to my question about the
player who seemed to suddenly become disinterested in traveller
when I changed campaigns.

In short, you were unanimous in condemning (well, not quite condemnation)
me for changing the nature of the campaign, adjusting rules, and requiring
new player characters all at the same time.  It was simply too much for this
one player, and made the others uneasy.

Yes.  I talked to my players after consulting you...

We (the players helped decide where they wanted the campaign to go -
maybe they should have originally) decided to take the following 
actions to restore the campaign:

	1. use existing characters
	2. use the existing campaign as a background to begin a new
	    one, rather than start from scratch
	3. implement MegaTraveller changes  (they really are minor - and
	     mostly enhancements

Most of you can easily see the mistakes I made.  I certainly can.  
"Don\'t try this at home, kids..."

Thanks again to all of you.
Richard

Greeting and Salutations Fellow Travellers!

The list has been curiously devoid of traffic lately, so I thought I\'d contribute some
detritus to break the monotony of the days toils.

==============================================================================================

The cast of characters:  The Captain and some of the crew of "Sed\'s Determination"
  
  Capt. Sedhgherr "Sed", Vargr merchant (Broker-4, Trader-2), owner of 200 ton far trader 
                         "Sed\'s Determination".   

  Leo Kernquey,          1st officer, ex-scout, pilot/navigator, smoker of "El Ropo" cigars,
                         needs to get directions to the shower, as he doesn\'t use it often
                         enough to remember it\'s location (slight exagerration).
                 
  Speaker to Furballs,   Kzin chief gunner (Gunnery-2), former "ambassador" to Vargr space,
                         a runt among Kzinti ("only" 7\' tall, 205kg), slightly mellower
                         than most.  Favorite drink: Old Frothing Slosh (that stale, pale
                         ale with the foam on the bottom).

================================================================================================

Although primarily a merchant campaign, the crew of the Determination tend to involve themselves
in high-risk situations, so they tend to pack as much firepower as they can get away with.  
Recent activities include foiling an assassination attempt on the life of an Imperial Minister
of Trade by a vargr terrorist group we call the "Planet Busters".  Unfortunately, the "Busters"
know who we are, and are not pleased with us.  We were originally going to be their "fall guys"
in the attempt, so they kidnapped us and planned to take us to another system to hold us for a
few weeks until their plans came to fruition.  Then we\'d be set up as the culprits.  

Well, we got out of that by successfully taking over their ship (300-tons, mostly engines if 
you follow my meaning), when Leo managed to kayo a guard with a bar of hard soap while on the 
way back to our cell from the lavatory.  Of course, it helped that Leo is second only to Speaker
in the muscle department.  The rest of us were confused as to how he managed to use the soap bar
as a weapon, especially as he\'s had so little experience with it in it\'s intended use.  He then
broke the rest of us out, and we had a spirited firefight with the crew resulting in several
severe injuries (to us and them), and one shredded captain (for them).  I used my AP pistol, a
kind of mini grenade launcher, patterned after the AP Pistols in CJ Cherryh\'s "Chanur" series. 
In the campaign, it\'s a weapon of vargr invention, and can\'t be found outside of vargr space.
Anyway, he got rather severely perforated, along with a few bulkheads.  

Once we got back to our original planet, we only had to deal with the "Bugs" (Imperial Naval
Security, or INSec) "INSec, Eliminating subversive elements since 847".  Those guys.  Lucky
for us we had accumulated overwhelming evidence of our innocence.  That way it only took us
two weeks to be cleared of all charges related to the (now pirated) ship we were in when they
stopped us.  The real pisser of it all was that we couldn\'t hang around to get our reward for
helping to foil the assassination and recovering the kidnappers ship.  There\'s over 1MCr waiting
for us back there, but there\'s also over 200 members of the terrorists on the same planet who
are waiting for our greed to get the better of us.  Ah well, plot \'n plan, and find a way.

=================================================================================================

Anyway, are there any list members with experience playing vargr characters?  I\'d like some
ideas on how to flesh out Cap\'n Sed.  Personality quirks, likes and dislikes, whatever. I\'ve
gotten the GDW Vargr supplement, but it pretty much concentrates on total vargr campaigns,
not one where the campaign is mostly human with the occasional vargr. 

Later postings will probably contain less verbosity, I just got bored.  Sorry.

Some tales from one of my old Traveller campaigns...

                   [7;1;4m  M Y R I A D     L O G  [0m

    [1m321.260:[0m  On  HARDIL  Nathan Rofaro (Kevin  McCarthy),  leader  of
    the  infamous Rofaro Syndicate, smuggles a note off planet in the
    landing gear on the prison ship.  The note reads:

         [7m ---- [0m
         [7m|   Adventure and Fortune is for the  people   |[0m
         [7m|   who find a way to get myself and  my Lt.   |[0m
         [7m|   off HARDIL.  Enclosed  is  10K  Cr.  and   |[0m
         [7m|   one half of 100K Cr.  This and much more   |[0m
         [7m|   can be yours if you are sucessful.         |[0m
         [7m|                                              |[0m
         [7m|                          Sir Nathan Rofaro   |[0m
         [7m ---- [0m

    Rofaro\'s and his  Lt.,  Jasper  Fulton(Pam  Baranski)  have  been
    seeking  a  route  off  of  HARDIL  since  the  recent decline in
    Nathan\'s health believed  due  to  the  effects  of  the  tainted
    atmosphere.   Nathan  Rofaro  is  the  Grandson of Ceaser Rofaro,
    founder of the Rofaro  syndicate  over  50  years  ago,  and  has
    sucessfully  run  the syndicate since the suspicious death of his
    father  eight  years  ago.   Jasper  was  placed  on  HARDIL  for
    suspected treason against the ROYALTY due to her involvement with
    a revolutionary ARKIDian group.  She has, in her  four  years  on
    HARDIL, become a trusted advisor to Nathan.

    [1m321.300:[0m Lukas  Smith   (Bob   Lyons),   Jessica   Lyndon   (Erin
    Neprud),   Jameson   Rondoval(Steve  Rieven),  Carrn  Eckers(Rich
    Dickey), and Lee(Cheryl McCarthy) are  discharged  from  services
    and meet on LAMON.

    [1m321.311:[0m Carrn and  Jameson,  while  wandering  in  the  starship
    docking  area,  find an unusual package containing a note, 10,000
    cr and one half of a 100k note.

    The Group decides to hijack a ship to break Nathen out.   In  the
    starport  the  group  sees a 600ton Liner and 400ton Cruiser land
    and proceed three days later.   They  wisely  ignore  Carrn,  who
    starts making plans to take over the Patrol Cruiser.

    [1m321.359:[0m The group hyjacks  The  ANDOR  GYPSY,  a  200  ton  Free
    Trader,  on planet as part of their regular trade route.  Jameson
    and Luke hired on for a days work loading cargo on the GYPSY  and
    other  ships  in  the  LAMON  starport.  Claim- ing the loss of a
    wallet in the hold, Jameson and Luke gain  acess  to  the  GYPSY.
    While  Jameson  and  one of the remaining crew members search the
    hold, Luke and the other have a friendly drink.  The  two  return
    with  the  lost item and proceed to join the others when the bomb
    bursts in the hold.  One  of  the  crewmen  investigates  and  is
    knocked  unconcious  by  the  gas released by the bomb.  Upon the
    failure of the first crewman to return, the second  crewman  lets
    Jameson  and  Luke  out and goes off to investigate the situation
    himself.  Luke, Jameson, Jessica, Carrn and Lee  board  the  ship
    with  supplies  and  place the two crew mem- bers in low passage.
    The security to the ship is unlocked by Jessica and a trap is set
    for the return of the remaining crew.  A gunfight follows and the
    steward is killed.  The two others are injured.   Jessica  treats
    the  injured  crew  and  they are placeed in low passage with the
    others.

    [1m321.360:[0m Jump  day:   The  ANDOR  GYPSY  takes  off  on  schedule
    with  the  flight  plan  change  to  DYLOS  logged  with starport
    officials.  The Jump is sucessfull.  SIGHTINGS:  On their way out
    to jump the group notices a 200ton Free Trader coming out of jump
    into the system.  they hail each other and go on.

    [1m321.366:[0m Land  day:   The  GYPSY  jumps  into  the  DYLOS  system
    and refuels at the gas giant.

    [1m321.367:[0m Checkday:  The  group  checks  the  ships  engines,  etc
    for next jump.

    [1m321.370:[0m   SIGHTINGS:   On  their  way  out  to  jump  the  group
    notices  a 200ton Free Trader coming out of jump into the system.
    they hail each other and go on.  The group computes their  course
    and  jumps  to HEX 0602.  Although the jump was sucessfull, there
    is a smell of burning insulation and ozone  in  the  drive  room.
    Jessica  runs  diagnostics  and  finds  that the Jump drive needs
    repair.

    [1m321.373:[0m Unable to repair the malfunctioning drive  themselves,
    they  decide  to  bring  the  Engineer  of the ANDOR GYPSY\'s crew
    out of low birth to repair the jump drive.

    [1m321.373:[0m After   much   discussion   with   the   group,  Jessica
    sucessfully brings the GYPSY\'s Engineer out of cold sleep.  He is
    given an ultimatum to repair the drives or die.  He is also given
    the chance for equal partnership if he cooper- ated.  He is grogy
    and would rather sleep as Jameson attempts to enlist his aid.

    Jameson > How would you like to make  it  easy  on  everyone  and
    repair the the Jump drive.

    Engineer> Well, I suppose it is possible,  but  this  ship  is  a
    piece of junk.

    Jameson > Well, look at it this way.  If it doesn\'t get fixed  we
    are not going anywhere.!

    Engineer> Wake me  up  when  we  get  planetside.   (Yawning  and
    heading for his stateroom)

    Jameson > (Growing a little irritated) WE WON\'T GET TO ANY PLANET
    IF THE DRIVES DON\'T GET FIXED!!

    Engineer> You mean we misjumped?

    Jameson > Not exactly.

    Engineer> So why did you have to make things difficult and  bring
    me?

    Jameson > Well, you were there and being an engineer  we  thought
    you might come in handy.  And seem that it is a good thing we did
    bring you.

    Engineer> <GROAN> Hm, well, I don\'t see what difference it  makes
    if  I fix now or later, and it is most likely that I will do more
    damage than good if I don\'t have some rest.

    The engineer is alowed to sleep in one of the  Passenger  cabins.
    Approximately  eight hours later the engineer wakes and wishes to
    eat.  Jessica brings him dinner and checks him out.  Jameson  and
    Jessica, after much irritating haggling, sucessfully pursuade the
    Engineer to repair the drives.

    The diagnostics are run and, where they showed an  Ion  imbalance
    before,  now  show  nothing.   The engineers says he can probably
    prevent a misjump and advises the group that it would be  alright
    to jump.

    [1m321.381:[0m The group  jumps   in   to   the   TEMLER   system   and
    proceeds to refuel.

    [1m321.391:[0m The group jumps  into  the  SKARV  system  and  proceed
    to dock at the starport.

    [1m321.393:[0m Carrn and  the  engineer  see  to  the  repair  of  the
    jump drive.  The engineer spent the entire week in jump furiously
    working to keep  the  GYPSY  on  course.   Jessica  sees  to  the
    purchace  of  supplies and other items.  During the time spent in
    port waiting for the ship to be repaired, Jameson and Carrn study
    Navigation uder Lee\'s guidence.  Jessica works on the research of
    her amnesia drug and helps Luke study First Aid.

    [1m321.410:[0m The  group  heads  out  to  jump  point,   refueling  as
    they  go.  They set a course back to TEMLER and then to Hex 0502.
    On their way out they encounter a 400 ton Subsidized Merchant.

    [1m321.438:[0m The   group   enters   the   HARDIL   system.   Powering
    down,  they  proceed to drift towards the prison planet.  As they
    drift they pick up a 100t ship just at the edge of  their  sensor
    range  towards HARDIL.  On the hour they pick up a coded message.
    After a few unsucessful attempts at decoding the message  Jessica
    finds  that  the  third  message  reads:[1m   Tracking   object,  No
    movement  or  action.[0m  Three and a half hours later  the  sensors
    detect  another object heading towards them the Ship.  They power
    down all but the radio recieve mechanism.  The fighter approaches
    and  sends  an uncoded message:[1m  Unidentified  Free  Trader stand
    by  to be boarded.   You are in a  restricted  zone. [0m  The  group
    decides  to  ignore  the  message  and  claim Misjump due to  the
    illness of the engineer.  They sabotage the reciever.  A  50  ton
    shuttle  docks  and  4  Royalty  marines  board.  The armed group
    greets the Marines, at the airlock.  The guard  orders  Luke  and
    the  others to drop their weapons.  They do so willingly.  Carrn,
    in the meantime hides in one of the ATV\'s  effectively.   Jessica
    calls  for  a  Medic  to  help her with the disabled crew member.
    Jessica and the Medic transfer the engineer to  the  shuttle  and
    the  guards  ask  that  all  the others come with them also.  The
    Colonel explains that they are being taken  to  headquarters  for
    questioning.  A Royalty pilot follows them in the GYPSY.

Having read the message about the merchant crew with a Vargr captain, and the
request for help with characters, here are my views on Vargr.

Rules for playing Vargr

Rule 1. No wimps.
	The key Vargr characteristic is Charisma. A high charisma Vargr will
dominate any situation (or try to, if non-Vargr are involved). Other Vargr will
follow him, regardless of skill or other qualifications. A mid-charisma Vargr
will attempt to do glorious things to gain charisma. A low charisma Vargr can
be treated like dirt, as he will feel like it. Vargr have egos to match their
charisma.

Rule 2. I don\'t want to catch anyone NOT breaking any laws or rules when they
can get away with it.
	Vargr have little or no respect for formal authority. They respect a
high charisma leader whom they can see and follow; they do not respect an
isolated leadership, with whom they have no direct contact. Which is why
Vargr society is so unstable.

Rule 3. No wimps.
	Charisma is often backed up by physical strength and size, and disputes
of leadership are settled with a form of unarmed duel, Infighting, which is a
little more ritualised than a simple punch-up. The Vargr Alien Module covers
this quite well.

Rule 4. No maltreatment of lower life forms (while anyone\'s looking).
	Vargr are highly racist, because of the fact that they alone of the
major races were given their sentience, instead of evolving it. Some believe
the Ancients created them to rule the universe; chief among these are the
Church of the Chosen Ones.

Rule 5. No wimps.
	Vargr are touchy, easily insulted, and likely to react swiftly and
violently to any perceived insult. The insult may not be meant as such, if it
is given by a non-Vargr. NEVER call a Vargr "cunning as a wolf", "sly as a fox"
etc., even though you may think those are complements. If the Vargr in question
doesn\'t have an extremely high Liaison skill, you\'ll have your head in your
hands to play with.

Rule 6. There is no rule 6.
	There are no other rules governing Vargr behaviour, either individually
or as nations. Vargr are highly individualised. If anyone thinks they have any
other rules, apply rule 2 above.


The Vargr Alien Module is full of errors (my copy is, anyway). For one thing,
in the advanced Corsair generation rules, it says that you can\'t enter the
Technical department without going through Technical school. What it doesn\'t
say is how to get into technical school. Also, the rule on variable charisma
is, if the character achieves a major success and throws 2D less than his
charisma, he gets 1 added on. Which means a low charisma character has little
or no chance of advancement, and a high charisma character can\'t stop getting
higher. I suspect that should be, throw 2D higher than charisma for an increase
with a natural 12 always yielding an increase.

Coming soon: the story of Aerrghkunun, warlord and now a major force within
Gvurrdon sector.

This is the MegaTraveller Errata sheet as posted to Delphi

   Page 25, Mustering Out Benefit Objects, Corsair (correction): When a
pirate character receives a Corsair ship as a benefit, it is wholly owned
upon the first receipt of the benefit - no payments are ever made. No
matter how many times the Corsair is received as a benefit, only one ship
is received. This is consistent with the statement made on page 19
second column, under Starships.
   Page 28, middle column, Economic skill (correction): Economic (includes)
Admin, Broker, Legal, Trader.
   Page 38, left column, Rifleman Skill (addition): Rifleman (Includes
Autorifle, Carbine, Rifle, Shotgun).
   Page 51, Military Occupational Specialty Table (correction): Die roll 2
under Infantry, Commando, and Ship\'s troops should be Cbt Rifleman skill,
not Gun Cbt.
   Page 53, left column, Assignment Resolution, Survival (correction):
Combat missions are battle, siege, and strike - not police action, 
counterinsurgency, or raid.
   Page 54, Assignment table (correction): Change die roll 3 from Shore
Duty to Frozen Watch. This makes the table consistent with the Frozen
Watch paragraph under Special Rules on    Page 53.
   Page 60, left column, Initial Activities, Draft (correction): Delete the
reference to the draft. In MegaTraveller, Merchant characters never enlist
via the draft. Flyers (a military career) have replaced Merchants (a
non-military career) in this regard.
   Page 63, Skill Tables, Free Trader, Business column (correction): Change
the die roll 5 entry from Steward to Pilot. With this change, a Free Trader
can now acquire pilot skill.
   Page 63, Skill Table Notes (omission): Merchant Life available to all
characters. Shipboard Life available to all (including Free Traders) except
Sales and Admin Departments. Officer Skills available to rank O0+.
Merchantile Skills available to all (including Free Traders) except
Engineering Department. Master Skills open to Deck Department rank O4+.

   Page 67, left column, Surprise (correction): In the referee\'s paragraph of
the task for determining surprise, change "If any mishap occurs..." to "If
exceptional failure occurs...". Thus if the attacking party gets exceptional
failure on the surprise task roll, the defending party has surprise instead.
   Page 67, Definitions Sidebar, Distance Scale (correction): The last line
of the Distance Scale definition should read: "Therefore this weapon\'s
danger space is one square in the 15m scale."
   Page 68, left column, Interrupts (correction and clarification): The
sentence should read: Unintelligent animals never perform an intelligent
interrupt. An animal that by nature leaps at its prey will interrupt by
jumping at a man, even though that man is fully protected by combat
armor. An animal that by nature flees at loud noises will interrupt to run
away from a defenseless human who is yelling at the top of his lungs.
   Page 69, right column, hand-to-hand combat tasks (suggestion): If you
prefer, you can combine the two hand-to-hand combat tasks into this
single task:

To hit another unit with a hand-to-hand attack:
Routine, Off=Wpn skill, Str; Def=Wpn skill, Wpn Def (confrontation)
Referee: If the attacker is unskilled, increase the difficulty of this task
by one level; if the defender is unskilled, decrease the difficulty of this
task by one level.
   The defender may use his weapon (whatever weapon he currently has) for
defense. Note that the defender may later conduct a hand-to-hand attack
with his weapon if he has not yet taken his turn. The defender may
attempt to preempt the attack by interrupting the attacker (note: use Dex
in place of movement speed as the DM when interrupting a hand-to-hand
attack in this manner). The defender may not attempt to interrupt anyone
other than the attacker.
   Failure means the defender blocked or otherwise avoided the attack.

   Page 70, left column, hand-to-hand interrupts (clarification): A unit
undergoing a hand-to-hand attack can try to interrupt the attacker; in this
case, use the interrupting unit\'s Dex as the DM in place of movement speed.
In effect, two units locked in hand-to-hand combat may interrupt each
other, but no other units.
   Page 72, weapon enhancements (addition): A character who remains
stationary for the combat round and can brace against something may use
the gyrostable difficulty profile when firing his weapon.
   Page 74, Personal Armor table (correction): The Reflec armor value
should be [10], indicating that the armor value applies only against laser
fire.
   Page 74, Large Blades table (omission): The block missing values are:
Sword 3, Cutlass 2, Broadsword 2.
   Page 76, Slug Throwers (correction): The following are the correct
entries (the corrections are underlined):

   Page 87, Corridor Sidebar (correction): Varian is incorrectly identified
as the acting emperor. Varian\'s younger brother Lucan is in fact the acting
emperor; Varian lost his life in the ensuing struggle following emperor
Strephon\'s assassination.

Referee\'s Manual
   Page 16, Universal World Profile Diagram (correction): The Gas Giants
and Planetoid Belts labels have been switched. Planetoid belts comes
first, then Gas Giants. In the example shown, Roup has 2 Planetoid Belts
and 3 Gas Giants.
   Page 22, World Size table (correction): The column headings should be:
General Description, Minimum Diameter, and Maximum Diameter.
   Page 22, World Atmosphere table (correction): The column headings
should be: General Description, Minimum Pressure, and Maximum Pressure.
   Page 23, World Physical Data table, Code Hydrographics (correction): The

   Page 26, Step 9 (correction): Rather than determining the companion
star\'s orbit distance in AU, roll 1D+13 to determine the companion star\'s
orbit number (see the Orbital Distances table, below).

Empty Orbits.

   Page 34, Step 1 (correction): The Basic World Data table, Atmosphere
column, is incorrect. The correct values for this column are:

  UWP Atmosphere

   3  Vacuum
   4  Thin
   5  Thin
   6  Standard

   Page 35, Step 10 (correction): The Animal Behaviors table, Omnivore
column heading should be To Attack, To Flee, Typical Speed. These
headings apply to Omnivores, Carnivores, and Scavengers.
   Page 42, Step 8 (addition): If a legal encounter occurs, go to step 10d.
   Page 42, Step 9 (addition): If a random encounter occurs, go to step 10d.
   Page 43, Step 10d (addition): After determining encounter range, if the
Encounter includes an NPC, go to step 11.
   Page 45, left column, Interpersonal Bribery (correction): SOC 2 should be
Social Standing squared.
   Page 50, Step 5 (clarification): Lot size is given in displacement tons.
To convert to kiloliters, multiply by 13.5. Optionally, use the following
rolls to get the lot size in kiloliters directly: Major Cargos: 150 + (1Dx10).
Minor Cargos: 80 + (1Dx10). Incidental Cargos: 1Dx10.
   Page 50, Step 6 (correction): The Trade Classifications table, Fl code
line should be Atmosphere A+, Hydrographic 1+. The Size entry should be
"Q".
   Page 53, Step 5 (addition): Add the following results to Negotiation:
Passive Uncooperation, +1000; Active Uncooperation, goods withdrawn
from sale. This adds some detrimental effects to negotiation,
representing the cargo purchaser\'s inability to drive a hard bargain.
   Page 62, Step 3 (correction): The price column is in thousands of credits
on the Small Craft Hull Table.
   Page 63, Step 5 (correction): Configuration 1 should be labeled
Needle/Wedge. The Airframe Column for Configuration 6, Dome/Disk
should be x3.0, not x0.5. The Price Mod column for Configuration 7,
Irregular should be x 0.5 not x.05.
   Page 63, Step 6 (clarification): The armor value mass factor is in fact
the armor value mod (refers to the Mod column on the Armor Table in step
9).
   Page 64, Step 11 (correction): The second and third sentences should
read: If the vehicle has a chassis UCP of 0.2 or less, it cannot be enclosed;
occupants must ride on its outside. If the chassis UCP is more than 0.2,
the vehicle is enclosed unless selected otherwise.
   Page 64, Step 1 (corrections and clarifications): The table heading is
misleading. The Power Out, Weight, and Price is per kiloliter of volume;
thus the Power Out, Weight, and Price of each table entry is for 1 kiloliter
of power plant volume. The volume column should be labeled Minimum
Volume, this is the smallest volume to which the power plant may be
built.
   The tech level 12 Fusion Power Plant Kl/Hour entry should be 0.003, not
0.005 as shown.
   The tech level 17 Antimatter Power Plant Kl/year entry should be 250.0,
not 25.0 as shown.
   Also, further testing of vehicle designs using the hydrocarbon fueled
power plants has revealed that they are too inefficient as given. More
acceptable values are given below:

                        ----Per Kiloliter----  Minimum
 TL Description          Power Out Weight Price  Volume Kl/Hour Fuel Type
 5 Internal Combustion     0.25     1     1000   0.005  0.030  Hydrocarbons
 6 Improved Internal Comb  0.40     1     2000   0.001  0.025  Hydrocarbons
 7 Gas Turbine             0.60     1     5000   0.005  0.040  Hydrocarbons
 8 MHD Turbine             0.80     1    10000   0.001  0.035  Hydrocarbons

  Antimatter power plants use fuel pods: a special self-contained fuel
package that consists of a measured quantity of antimatter enclosed in a
strong artificial gravity "bottle". The bottle\'s gravity fields are maitained
by an array of superbatteries. Fuel pods are the heart of an antimatter
power plant, and they typically provide fuel for up to a year before needing
replaced. Fuel pods also have a minimum size to which they may be built:

    Minimum
TL  Volume (Kl)
17  2.000
18  0.800
19  0.200
20  0.050
21  0.005

  Antimatter power plant output increases dramatically as the ability to
safely contain a progressively larger anihilation mass occurs. This means
that a given fuel pod is "burned up" at a progressively faster rate,
however.
   On the Fuel Cells table, the headings for the two rightmost columns should
be: Price, and Fuel Liters/Hour.
   Page 64, Step 2 (correction): On the Small Plants Efficiency Decrease
table, the Volume column entry for Turbines is missing. It should be 0.10-.
   Page 65, Step 5 (clarifcation): An anti-grav unit requires a gravity well
to push against, so an anti-grav maneuver drive is less efficient at 10
diameters and beyond. The effective maneuver number of the craft drops
by 50% at 10 diameters and beyond; for example, a maneuver-2 drive drops
to a maneuver-1, and a maneuver-1 drops to a maneuver-0.5. Thruster
units do not suffer these effects.
   Page 66, Step 7 (correction): The minimum volume percentages should
be: Wheels: 1.5%, Tracks: 2.0%. Greater volume reduces ground pressure,
which in turn increases off-road speed.
   Page 66, Step 9 (correction): The Avionics table headings should be:
Volume, Weight, and Power - not Power, Volume, and Weight.
   Page 67, Step 4 (correction): The price note should say: If TL8, x2.
   Page 68, Step 3 (correction): The prices for Radar should be: Weight x
Cr1,000,000. All-weather Radar is Weight x Cr1,500,000.
   Page 68, Step 5 (clarification): An EMM package does not mask the
craft\'s emissions when it uses active electromagnetic sensors. Also, an
EMM package does not mask the craft from active sensor scans conducted
by other craft.
   Page 68, Step 7 (correction): The weights for tech level 10 and 11
regional Ladars are incorrect. They should be TL10, 0.016 and TL11, 0.008.
   Page 70, Step 15 (correction): The power requirement for the EMS Active
Array should be: Weight in tons x 10.
   Page 71, Step 3 (correction): The price column and hardpoints column for
the Meson Guns table are incorrect. The correct values are:

MESON GUNS (SPINAL MOUNT)
        Hard-
UCP MCr Points
A 10000  50
B 12000  80
C  3000  20

X  2000  80
Y  1200  70
Z   800  50

   Page 72, Step 6 (correction): The hardpoints for bays should be 10, not
100.
   Page 72, Step 8 (correction): The TL 9 column should be empty for the
Plasma Gun, Fusion Gun, and Repulsor. The prices for these weapons are
missing - the correct values are: Plasma Gun, MCr5; Fusion Gun, MCr8; and
Repulsor, MCr6.
   Page 73, Step 13 (correction): Each Plasma Gun Turret can have 1 or 2
weapons, not just 1.
   Page 74, Step 14 (correction): Each Fusion Gun Turret can have 1 or 2
weapons, not just 1.
   Page 74, Step 17 (clarification): Rate of fire applies in personal combat,
not in space combat. Each space combat round represents 20 minutes of
elapsed time - rate of fire is inconsequential in this case.
   Page 74, Step 18 (clarification): 100-ton bays hold 100 missiles; 50-ton
bays hold 50 missiles. The battery-round for one 100-ton missile bay is
100 missiles; The battery-round for one 50-ton missile bay is 50
missiles. ROF only applies during personal combat: in space combat, use
the battery-round.
   Page 75, Step 20 (clarification): The Indirect Fire range lists a range
band and a number in parentheses. The number in parentheses is the actual
range in kilometers. Where the range band indicates a general range band
for "effect", the exact range in kilometers is much more accurate. We
recommend you use either the range band or the exact range in kilometers
in a given combat session - don\'t use both. Mixing and matching range
methods can be confusing.
   Page 77, Step 22 (correction): The indirect fire range in kilometers for a
10cm bore is 20, not 22. Likewise, the indirect fire range in kilometers
for a 24cm bore is 60, not 90.
   Page 79, Step 33 (correction): Change the last sentence to read: If a
vehicle is open-topped or smaller than a UCP of 0.2, the weapon mount
must be Fixed or Open; Turrets or Cupolas are not allowed.
   Page 80, Step 2 (clarification): The price of Nuclear Dampers is given in
MCr.
   Page 80, Step 3 (correction): The Power column entries for optimized
Meson Screen Packs is incorrect. The correct entries are: TL16, .135;
TL17, .100; TL18, .065; TL19, .035; TL20, .015; TL21, .010.
   Page 80, Step 6 (clarification): The price of White Globes is given in
MCr.
   Page 81, Step 1 (correction): The volume and weight of Basic
Life-Support is incorrect. It should be 0.005, not 0.050.
   Page 81, Step 3 (clarification): The price of Computers is given in MCr.
   Page 82, Step 7 (corrections and clarifications): On the Engineering
Crew formula (Ce): L=Locomotion CP. On the Maintenance Crew formula
(Cm): A=Hull displacement divided by 100, H=Hull CP.
   Page 82, Step 8 (correction): The example incorrectly specifies a
43-person crew - the correct value is a 45-person crew.
   Page 83, Step 3 (clarification): The listed price of the fuel purification
plants is in credits. 
   Page 91, left column, Surprise (correction): In the referee\'s paragraph of
the task for determining surprise, change "If any mishap occurs..." to "If
exceptional failure occurs...". Thus if the attacker gets exceptional failure
on the surprise task roll, the defender has surprise instead.
   Page 92, right column, sensor lock (clarification): Each new combat
round, as long as the target unit does not move out of its square, the
sensor lock stays in effect.
   If the sensing unit uses active sensors for the scan and the enemy has any
functioning sensors, the sensing unit must automatically reveal itself to
the enemy (just as if the enemy had performed an exceptional success
sensor scan on the sensing unit).
   Page 93, left column, range DMs (clarification): Change all references
from "beyond planetary range" to "at far range".
   Page 94, left column, DMs for ship damage tables, second entry
(correction): Replace "If the weapon inflicting the hit has a UCP factor of
9 or less..." with "If the weapon inflicting the hit has a UCP factor of A or
more, apply a DM of +6."
   Page 95, right column, Special Rules (addition): A space vessel with an
anti-grav based maneuver drive has its maneuver drive number halved
when 10 or more squares away from a massive astronomical body. A
thruster based maneuver drive does not suffer these effects.
   Page 95, left column, Tractors (clarification): Tractor Pull V Target
Weight = Agility and Speed Loss (round fractions up).
   Page 97, (clarification): Change all references from "beyond planetary
range" to "at far range".
   Page 99, Attacking Beam Factor table (correction): The To Hit values are
incorrect. The correct values are:

        Attacking Beam Factor
        1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   A   B   C

  Hi folks!

  I need a new copy of the c program that generated star systems; mine died in
my last disk crash.

  I also need any source code that anyone out there has that takes care of
traveller details (ship design, world generation, system generation a la
Scouts, and similar...)

  Also, has anyone made any major modifications to the Merchant Prince system
that I should know about?

  (Just starting a new campaign, and my players are after me for information!)

  Thanks in advance, any help MUCH appreciated!

This mailing list has been quiet lately. Too quiet. What\'s happened? Has
Strephon\'s assassination caused the second Long Night, and everyone\'s asleep?
Or are Vargr, Zhodani etc. intercepting all communications between the Core
(i.e. North America) and the outlying regions (i.e. U.K.)? :-) :-) :-)

Anyway, here are a few points to consider about starships. GDW starships in
particular.

1. In "Traders and Gunboats", we find the "Gazelle" class close escort. With
drop tanks fitted, it\'s 400 tons. (Ignore for the moment the fact that the
plans make it look smaller than the 200 ton "Empress" class far trader!)
Without those tanks, it\'s 300 tons. "High Guard" says you can have a hardpoint
for every 100 tons of hull, so with the tanks fitted, you have 400 tons, i.e.
4 hardpoints. So the "Gazelle" has two laser turrets, and two particle
accelerator barbettes. When it drops its tanks, the ship becomes 300 tons, and
one hardpoint is now invalid. Does it fall off too, or do the control links
just disappear? Incidentally, how does that ship burn the fuel from the drop
tanks, drop them, and THEN execute its jump 5?

2. In the same book, where are the power plant and computer on the Type S?

3. Whoever designed the "Kinunir" class cruiser should be shot. It has 8 dual
laser turrets, which some moron grouped into two batteries of 4 turrets, or 8
lasers, each. This gives it a High Guard USP factor of 4, boosted to 5 by
high tech. 3 turrets to a battery would do the same, leaving the other 2 free
for use as missiles or sandcasters. I also checked the energy calculations for
that ship.

Computer		7
16 lasers		16
2 partcle accelerators	10
Nuclear damper 5	50
Total			83

Power plant 7 gives 87.5 EP, so agility = (87.5-83)/1250 * 100 = 0.36 = 0
But then I looked in the back of "High Guard" where the design is shown, and
they give the damper 40 EP, which gives the ship enough EP for agility 1.
In fact, the damper is rated as 8 tons, MCr 30, 40 EP. And these are the
figures, not for a factor 5 damper, but for a factor 4. But the factor 4 is
TL 14, and "Kinunir" is TL15. Does the damper get a factor increase for this?
If so, why haven\'t I found a rule to that effect elsewhere in the book?

Thanks for getting this far. Now back to sleep! :-) :-)

Anyone interested$in playing a Traveller PBM?  If you are, follow these 
directions below very carefully:

	1)  It will not be held here, but on a BBS, the phone # is
		
			The Pyre (408) 226-2889

	2)  Just log in, and become a new user, after that is done

	3)  hit the \'=\' key and enter 19, hit return (This puts you in my
	    game group)

	4)  Leave a handle, and character description (If you have one rolled
           put him there, but I am only using Basic Traveller [no Merc, or
           High Guard, or Scout])

	5) E-Mail me if you want to to tell me you posted

The game turns will run about once every two weeks, or even as slow as a month
if people want that.


Check it out, the BBS, even if you are not interested.  Hope to hear from some
of you soon.

In message #169 Tim Thomas asked if anyone had ideas for hi-tech traveller...

I found a number of interesting things, complete with modifiable descriptions
in FASA\'s *Space Opera* game.  I say modifiable, because their tech level
system is 0-10, vs our 0-18(or so).  Also, they make some assumptions about
availablility and use (etc) that do not hold for Traveller.

A big thing to look into is how they describe CT (antimatter) driven ships.
Comparing some of the ship design concepts from *Space Opera* with the new
hi-tech drive and power information in the MegaTraveller Referee\'s book
(I think that\'s the one) gave me some ides for TL17+ CT-powered jump ships.

Right now I have a lot of characters in my campaign on personal technology
quests.  Most of the players are experienced D&Ders and originally thought
of tech level in much the same way as a better weapon.  Slowly, they are 
learning that sometimes better technology is not worth the cost.

The costs are more than just MCr (but is is a good way to keep some of your
wealthier characters a little bit in check).  Often the character\'s education 
is lacking.  So is the character\'s responsibility.  Consider the CT ship:

	Ferd, a good pilot (ex scout, pilot 3, Nav 2, computer 2, ...) 
	stumbles accross a TL18 scout ship, for some reason peculiarly
	abandoned (lots of possibility for trouble here :-).  Ferd takes
	it to a good shipyard and promptly discovers that no one knows
	how to fix it, and no one knows where he can get any help.

	Finally, Ferd\'s ship is ready for take-off (assuming he/she didn\'t
	just dump it for some fast MCr).  Mission one is to fine some
	antimatter.

Well, you get the picture.

I enjoy having hi-tech things as well as lo-tech things around.  It gives
the campaign some color.  I\'ll see if I can find that write-up I did for
force blades, laser swords, and light swords from *Space Opera*.

Have fun.

Actually, "Space Opera" was published by FGU (Fantasy Games Unlimited)
the publishers of Chivalry and Sorcery, Bushido, and other games.

BTW, Space Opera has one of the MOST tedious character design systems
I\'ve ever seen.  My first character took me 5 hours to complete, and
even after I got used to the system, it still took me 1.5 hours.  And
this is coming from someone who played Chivalry and Sorcery for 6 years
(Another system renowned for its complex character generation system.)
The problem is that each skill is so interdependant with other skills,
that you can\'t figure out your skill level in one skill, until you
know your skill level in all of your other skills; kind of a catch-22.

Perhaps my dislike for this game was accentuated by the fact that
the group I was playing it with at the time was using it as a means
for extremes of Power Gaming, with Dark Lords.  Basically, everyone
had a Dark Lord, of equal or greater power than Darth Vader.  Very
boring.

_____________________________________________________________________
I invite your comments on the following idea.  Let\'s get some
discussion going.

It seems reasonable that about TL 13 or so, (maybe higher) someone
would figure out how to create a permanent space-base whose purpose
is to generate a hyperspace field that interacts with the hyperspace
field of a ship.  The result of the interaction is a new field whose
size and intensity are determined by the interaction of the original
two fields.

What this device does is enable a ship to jump with a smaller internal
fuel expenditure.  The remainder of the fuel required for a given
jump is consumed by the jump gate.  For example, if it is 4 parsecs
from system A to system B, and system A has a gate, then by using the
gate, your ship requires only the fuel required for jump 1; the gate
requires fuel for the total jump (inefficiencies). 

_______________________________________________________________________
notes and thoughts:

Wealthy systems would want to subsidize some of these, and set them on
"standard" routes (that is make nav tapes for the trade lanes readily
available).

They present an interesting military target/opportunity/... Would YOU
be willing to destroy one?  Try to hold it against an invading fleet?

These "jump gates" should be *very* expensive, if only for game balance. 
They also would require a *lot* of fuel and maintenance.

Should the output field be controlled by the using ship\'s computer or 
by someone/something on board the gate? 

The difficulty of using one of these should the the same as for making
a normal jump of the total distance (not 1), if the pilot AND the 
navigator have experience.  The standard non-profieciency penalties
should apply; JOT should not apply.

JOT should apply for learning how to use one of these, though.

Using one of these does not mean a jump 4 cruiser can make a jump 24.
As it says somewhere semi-official, no one has discovered anything
more than a jump 6.  No range benefits, just fuel and possibly time.

______________________________________________________________________

So what do you think?  
It would be nice to "flesh this out" and see if it\'s usable.
Direct e-mail I get on this, I will forward to the list (unless
its obscene or something).

Fare well for now, fellow travellers.
Richard

	Shades of the _Buck_Rogers_ TV show, but I like the idea.  The
	idea of "jump" is pretty loosley defined in Traveller, and I
	don\'t see too many problems in incorporating it.

	What about the corporate aspects?  Initially, they\'d probably
	be built by some of the big ship corporations.  They\'ve already
	got a corner on the jump market.  Those that couldn\'t copy,
	create, or steal the production process would push heavily for
	regulation.  (The First Corporate Wars?)

	If the process is pretty straight forward, what of the
	expense?  The organization that builds or commisions to build
	one will have to recoup the losses.  That\'d mean that jumps
	would probably cost a little more.  Probably direct debit
	stations at the gate - at widely varying rates.

	It seems that if these are implemented, demand for higher jump
	ships will drop.  Are the prices on all ships going to rise to
	cut expected losses?  Or will the bottom drop out of the jump-6
	ship market completely?

	As a somewhat evil GM, I see all kinds of opportunities to
	force traffic to or around certain places.  Also, there\'s much
	more opportunity for the tax collectors, mafia hit men,
	corporate raiders, military police, etc. to trace those
	characters and find them.

	To use this thing as a player, you probably have to call in,
	tell where you\'re going, what heading you have set, and the
	approximate jump "strength" your ship will use.  The
	"gatekeepers" will then debit your account and match your
	course with the additional power.

> 
> Should the output field be controlled by the using ship\'s computer or

	The gatekeeper probably has the power to assist a much larger
	ship than your 100 ton scout.  He can put you practically
	anywhere he wants to.  If you were playing in my game would you
	trust YOUR computer or MINE.

	Mis-jumps are much more likely - multiply your mis-jump rate by
	that of the gatekeeper.

Hi Everyone;

   I think the general idea is great!!!! The adventure possibilities are endless
for a group. Imagine trying to stop a group of terrorist planning to destroy
the base, or pirates trying to take one over to jump at will to nearby systems
allowing them to easily jump back because they aren\'t using as much fuel.
Great stuff!

   The biggest thing about one of these would be the cost envolved in running
it. Rich worlds (or worlds with strategic value for the Navy -- such as a
Naval Depot) would have them. The amount of fuel would be excessive for large
traffic areas. (But then again how fuel is there in a large gas giant 8-).

   Ideally a jump gate would be located close to a Gas Giant to allow for cheap
fuel. The Jump gate would have to allow for cheap "mining" of the gas giant
(i.e. skimming of fuel).

   I could probably add more but the mind is working (too early yet). BTW,
is there anything new out yet for Mega-Trav or Traveller from GDW? I haven\'t
been down to the local gamer\'s shop in a while.

It was really chilly in here this morning, and it got me to thinking 
about being much colder yet.

Let me know if you want me to continue this, or to shut up now..:-)

_________________________________________________________________________


"Overdid the buzz a little last night," Braen thought, as he slowly opened
his eyes.  "Left the light on, too."  This was the worst Braen had ever
felt after a night carousing.  His eyes wouldn\'t focus, he ached all over, 
he couldn\'t move, and he was cold.  Cold like he\'d never felt before.
So cold his bones hurt.  

But he couldn\'t shiver.  In fact, he couldn\'t move at all.  "Keep calm" 
he told himself.  "I can feel myself breathing, that\'s one.  I can kind
of make out shapes, so my eyelids work.  I don\'t smell anything, whatever
that\'s worth.  Well, they say smell is the most primal sense, hmm.  Back
to work.  I can make out shapes, so at least some of my optic nerve is 
intact, as well as a large portion of my central brain.  I\'m thinking...how 
can I think when I\'m SO DAMN COLD! Well, I think I\'m thinking, so my frontal 
lobes must be at least partially OK.  

"Let\'s save brain functions for later.  Let\'s see, smell, sight, temperature
(I think), that leaves hearing, touch, taste, motor control, time sense, and
balance.  All I can hear is this silly ringing.  Sounds like a 60 Hz hum and
a 1 KHz whistle.  Funny, I didn\'t notice it a minute ago.  Maybe I\'m waking
up.  Can I open and close my eyes?  Yep. Still no focus though.  Gawd I\'m cold.

"How \'bout taste.  Hmm, I can\'t move anything, but concentrating on it, my
mouth tastes like a catalytic converter smells first thing in the morning.
It\'s so cold.  If I could move I\'d set myself on fire.  Hey, I\'m shivering!
So much to testing motor control.  Do I remember what I\'m thinking about?
Yeah, if I\'m alive or dead, or dying.  Time sense, well at least memory,
is starting to work.

"What\'s that I smell?  Smell?  Maybe I\'ll open my eyes again...No, too tired.
I\'ll just go back to sleep and die."
 
                  ***          ***            ***

"There\'s that smell again.  Dammit, just when the dream was getting good!  
It\'s cold again, too!."

"Don\'t just lay there, start movin\', you bunch o\' barbaric bargylls!"  

Braen thought he heard a strange voice shouting at him.  "Must be part
of that wierd dream-within-a-dream thing," he thought.  "Probably some
after-effect of that new stuff I tried last night. Might as well wake
up now and get moving, shake off some of this cold."  The man tried to
stretch his arms and emit his customary welcome-to-the-world good morning
sigh.  All he got was a healf-hearted moan.

"If you don\'t get movin, there won\'t be enough of this tub left to drag 
back for scrap; and you\'ll be with it!"

There was that strange voice again.  "Oh well, lets roll out and see 
what\'s going on."  

Braen was used to strange voices in the middle of the night and early in 
the morning.  The crowded flat he shared with six other people, two couples, 
who all had different schedules.  Not that it much mattered.  The church 
took care of all their needs, so most of their time was spent attending to
the service of the Great One, wandering, partying, reading, and sleeping. 

Just as Braen was about to move, the whole world shook with a deafening
roar.  People all around were screaming.  Braen fell almost a meter onto
cold steel.  Something sharp momentarily tugged at the inside of his right 
elbow.  Something else was gripping his face.  He groaned softly and tried
to look around.  His head barely moved.  Everything went black.

                      ***          ***            ***

This time the smell was different.  So was the voice.  Braen did not even
try to understand the words; it was obviously some kind of drug-induced
hallucination.  He\'d heard those kinds of nonsense syllables before.  He
was cold again!  "Dammit, I just gotta get that heater fixed," he said to
himself.  His mouth still tasted terrible, his ears were still ringing and
he still couldn\'t move.  Braen opened his eyes.  Although fuzzy, the image
was clearly a woman standing above him.  There was that strange language
again.  She reached out and gently closed his eyes.

"Wow, what a dream.  I gotta write this one down and tell our confessor. 
It could go in the Records."  His left arm started feeling very warm. Wherever 
the warmth went pain was quickly following. The fuzzy woman touched something 
very warm and very wet to his lips.  "I\'m finally in heaven," Braen whispered.  

The woman, tall with golden brown hair said something strange again.  Then
she said something almost normal-sounding, then something really queer and
odd-sounding.  

"Are you talking to me?" Braen asked, again just a hoarse whisper.  "Can
I have some more to drink?"

"Do you understand me now?" the woman asked.  Braen\'s face felt like it was
working, felt kind of like someone else feeling astonishment.  It was 
beginning to get warm and was smarting all over. She smiled.  She slipped a 
small tube of some strange texture into the corner of his mouth.  "Sip on t
his verrry slowly," she said, stretching the word almost to tomorrow.

"Rest now," she continued "while we thaw you out.  Doctor Llewllyn will
want to talk with you soon enough."  The warmth was slowly flooding his 
chest now and the pain, while not severe was becoming really annoying.
Despite his efforts to stay awake, he really wanted to rest, just like the
fuzzy woman with the nice voice said.  

"What a nice place," he thought. "What a woman.  She\'s almost hypnotic.
Hypnotic!  Why the..." but he was already asleep.

Here\'s chapter two.  This really is a Traveller adventure, the character
development is important right now.  (I originally expected just a short
thing, but we\'ve only begun.)  Writing is a little different from GM\'ing,
I get to make all the characters do whatever *I* want :-).

Have fun.

Chapter 2: Braen awakens

Braen\'s right arm felt like he\'d hit it with a club.  "Must\'ve rolled
over on it in my sleep," he thought.  "But I\'m on my back.  Oh, yeah
I can\'t move.  I screwed myself up and I\'ve been having these hallu-
cinations.  The confessor\'s gonna love some of this stuff."

He opened his eyes.  He glanced about the room, not even trying
to move anything but his eyes.  The room was indirectly lit, from where
was not immediately obvious.  There was enough light to see, but not
enough to read, and it was a peculiar color anyway.  He was alone in the
room.  Around the walls were various kinds of strange equipment.  The
room smelled antiseptically clean.

"A hospital," he thought, "I should have known.  Julien put me up to
that party, and doped me so she could get my sack space.  Then she turned
me in."  It was customary for invalids to become the ward of the church 
and spend the remainder of their days transcribing doctrine.  Not Baen\'s
idea of a good time, especially since he was young.

He was mad.  He clenched and unclenched his teeth and fists in rage.  
"I\'ll get that bitch!" he quitely cursed.  "Wait!  I just moved my hands."
There\'s nothing quite like both pain and surprise to temporarily pre-
occupy you.  He looked down at his arm and slowly moved the sheet aside
with his left.

A gauze pad was taped to the inside of his left elbow.  Around it was 
the unmistakable darkening of a large bruise.  In the center of the pad
was a small spreading stain, unmistakably his own blood.  The pain,
combined with the view, was agonizing.  "Yecch," he said, and quietly laid
back on the pillow to think things through.  "Well how bout that, he said
aloud.  I can move, AND I\'m finaly warm."

The lights began to slowly brighten and the door opened.  A short, dark-
skinned man, about 30 by his appearance came through and pulled the chart
from the end of the bed.  "Ah, good you\'re awake.  Now we can get the
gravity back to normal and get you fed.  Someone will be here with some-
thing for you to eat shortly.

As the door closed behind the short man, Braen felt the familiar tug of
gravity and the resistance of the bed to his weight.  "THAT\'S what was
missing," he thought.  "How\'d they do it?  What else have they been
keeping from the faithful?  Did the Great One return and them hide it?

Presently the door again opened and a fairly massive-looking dinner
tray silently glided into the room.  It sailed over to the bed and
hovered while the bed behind Braen\'s back and shoulders raised him to 
an almost-seated position.  "Is that far enough?" asked a disembodied
voice.

"Yeah, yeah" replied Braen.  "This is going to take some getting used
to."  

"Would you like a translator and some crysals to study?"  The tray unfolded
legs beneath itself like aircraft landing gear.  It then slowly drifted over
the bed and extended the legs to the floor.  "Is my height satisfactory?"

"Y-yes" Braen stammered.

"Is that in response to the first question or the second?" asked the
tray.

"Oh," Braen replied, recovering his senses, "the second.  I\'d like you
to answer some questions before I answer the first."

"Very well, but first you have to eat.  Orders of Doctor Llewellyn."

"What\'ve you got?" the man asked.

"For you, a very large glass of what the crew calls \'slime \'n\' squeeze\'
and a small pastry.  You are instructed to ingest all of these."  The
tray magically sprouted an arm from somewhere.  An unnoticed panel slid
all the way to the rear, revealing the contents of the tray (one
large glass filled with a bronze colored liquid and one small pastry, both 
on a small plate).  The arm reached into a hidden cul-de-sac, sprouted two 
\'fingers\' and removed a straw.  It then slipped the straw into the glass 
and disappeared.  

Braen sat momentarily stunned.  This whole setup is nothing like he\'d ever
contemplated, never mind expected.  In all, it was a bit much for a young,
inexperienced man just recovering from trauma, hypthermia, culture shock,
and technology shock.

"Please eat now," the tray said "before your food cools."

Gingerly, Braen touched the straw to his lips and sipped.  The drink was
not quite like anything he had ever tasted. It was served warm but not hot.  
It smelled like citric fruit and tasted like soy beans. But for all that, 
it was really wlecome, and it did wonders to cure the nagging metalic
taste that had been with him all morning.  He took a real drink.  It
seemed to have an analgesic in it, too.  Or maybe it was the chicken
soup syndrome that eased the pain not only in his arm, but throughout
his body.

"What is this?" he asked the tray as he picked up the pastry.  The "pastry"
was a pretty tasteless mass of something that sort of half-way melted in 
his mouth and stuck to everything inside it.

"I presume you are talking about the pastry," the tray responded.  "It and
the drink are a scientifically designed, balanced blend of liquid electro-
lytes, carbohydrates, vitamins, and amino acids.  They work together to speed 
healing and are extremely easy to digest.  There are almost no waste products.
In your case, the doctor added a general analagesic and a general antibiotic.
Ask your questions."

Now that he was both waking up and beginning to get some energy Braen
realized he was truly hungry.  "Where am I?" he managed to squeeze out
around the pastry-mush.

"I do not know our present location.  We, collectively, are on a starship"

"WHAT THE ..!" Braen chocked out involuntarily.  The tray remained silent
and unmoving.  Braen swallowed hard and took a deep breath.  This could
be a test of the inquisitor.  His Confessor had warned them all of the
inquisitor, and so he a took a few moments to speak clearly.  "Travel to 
the stars is impossible.  That\'s written in every one of our chatecisms 
from even before we learn to read."

"Really!?"  Finally, the tray seemed genuinely interested.  "What catecisms
are those?"

Braen\'s thoughts now raced, "Got to think smart, think clearly, and remember
all that drivel they drilled into my head for so many years."  Slowly he
answered. 
	"Five years creche,
         Seven years school,
         Three years prep,
         Two years tool."
just like he\'d been taught.  It was something everyone learned through years
of drill and corporal punishment.

"Do you believe all you\'ve been taught?"

"Certainly" Braen quickly, and automatically replied.

"Where are you from?"  the tray asked, putting away the empty dishes.

"Surely you know.  But for the record, Haildrun."

The tray continued disposing of dishes and began silently retracting its
landing gear.  It quickly sped toward the door, the door opening at its 
approach.  It paused.  "And what is the name of our blessed world?" it
asked.

"Why, Omigosh" replied Braen as the door closed.  Slowly the bed returned
to a horizontal position, and Braen felt himself again mostly, but not
completely lifted off the sheets.  "Oh well, he thought, "I didn\'t feel
much like doing anything but sleeping anyway."

  Before we get to the main body of this submission (in which I
solicit help with my Traveller campaign) there\'s a small matter
to take  care of first:  One of my players,  Sven Munther,  has
recently joined this mailing list.  Would you, when replying to
this posting, do us the favour of marking the submission plain-
ly  (like "Rancke\'s campaign" or "No peeking,  Svend") so Svend
can avoid getting any  forewarning of the horrors awaiting him?

JumpGates, eh?  Hmmmmm.  I like it.  My first thought when I read the note
was to arrange it so you didn\'t need a jump engine on the ship at all.  Just
secondaries to get you around in the system.  This would allow you to save
space and money on the jump drives.  With the extra cargo/passenger space you
could lower your rates for transport.  This would allow you to sell more space
to people who could not afford it before, thereby raising your volume of
business.

Then I re-read your note.  You say that a jump drive is still necessary on
board the ship.  Whyso?  If you set up the gate as a ring (or some other
enclosed polygon) would not any matter entering it be jumped?  Assuming
it was turned on, of course.  What do the rest of you think?  This would allow
you to jump whole asteroids from system to system as raw materials...or
weapons.  "We could throw rocks at them..." --The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress

Finally, I believe this concept wouldn\'t be developed until higher tech levels.
Say 15 or 16.  The technology is significantly different...instead of jumping
the engine (and whats attached to it, i.e. the ship), you are jumping what is
NOT the engine (i.e. what the engine encloses).  What do the rest of you think?

That\'s all for now.  From the bridge of the NOMAD.

Subject: Re: My campaign

... [dropped out little header material here -- James]

Oops. It seems that the body of the text didn\'t make it. Sorry
about that. Here it comes:


(OK, Sven, hit "n" now.)




  I\'ve been  running  a  traveller campaign with a friend for a
couple  of years now,  and we\'ve decided to involve our players
in the ever-popular "Riddle of the Ancients".  But we have some
problems with that.

  For one thing, neither of us are particularily enamoured with
the official version of the riddle. We find it... unconvincing,
to say the least. And not only unlikely, which would not matter
- - -  would indeed be a plus  -  if the story was a good one,  but
uncommonly bland and anticlimatic.

  You  may  disagree  about this,  but even if we had liked the
official version;  even if it had been marvelously well-crafted
and intricate tale, a veritable tour-de-force, a masterpiece of
poetic imagination,  it would still  have one  absolutely fatal
flaw: the players know it beforehand.

  So what we\'ve done is to whomp up an alternate version of the
riddle.  We\'ve tried to keep as many of the clues that has been
puplished  in various Traveller adventures as possible,  but we
are not fanatic about it, since our players hasen\'t encountered
any of the clues yet. What I\'d like to ask you, is to point out
weaknesses of the story  (preferably with suggestions on how to
plug the holes)  and especially  suggest embellishments of your
own.  It is our ambition to make  this story the crowning point
of the campaign,  and to provide something **really** memorable
for our players.

  OK, here it is,

               The TRUE Secret of the Ancients!

(Well, ya didn\'t REALLY believe the one about Grandfather, didya?)

  There were  TWO  ancient races,  and neither of them were the
droyne.  The first were the MASTERS,  amoeboid 4-kilo parasites
capable of taking up residence inside another creature and con-
trolling it\'s bodily functions  (anybody recoqnize these little
slimeballs? Well, I\'m not above borrowing from a master). For a
number of reasons  they preferred  intelligent hosts,  and they
enslaved  most of the  known part  of our galaxy,  annexing the
technology  of their slaves in the process  (this is the reason
for all those diverging technologies found on different Ancient
sites). They experimented on human, lupine and other stock from
Terra and on  numerous other races  from other worlds  in their
efforts to produce  the perfect subject.  They were  altogether
extremely not-nice, and if anyone wonders why I don\'t call them
Slavers and be done with it, it\'s because "slavers" is quite an
ackward word in danish.
  To the reptiloid \'STREE,  the manners, outlook, pilosophy and
behaviour of the  Masters  were an  abomination.  Their genetic
manipulations were downright blasphemous. Added to this was the
fact that Masters reproduced about once a century by fissioning
and seemingly lived forever (barring accident or violence).  As
anybody familiar with geometric progressions will know, that is
nothing less than a catastrophy waiting for a chance to happen.
The Masters firm resolve  to enslave any being they could  (and
exterminate any being they couldn\'t) was real unpopular too. So
shortly after the first  contact with the Masters,  the  \'stree
quietly began organizing an extermination program of their own.
  The  \'stree was an extremely old race even 300.000 years ago.
They had  been  mostly confined  to  their own planet  by their
concentration  on the social  and psionic  sciencies.  Now they
evolved  their  own  technology  in  record time,  enlisted the
diminutive droyne as troops (most droyne were too small to host
a Master,  and  their  psionic  talents  helped them detect the
caracteristic  double mind of a masterdriven sophont)  and went
to war!

Provisional timeline:

- - -300.000 The  Masters thrive.  They transplant humans  to other
         worlds,  experiment on various terran and otherworldly
         fauna in an attempt to breed the perfect "steed",  and
         generally muck about.

- - -250.000 Masters contacts  \'stree planet;  final war begins and
         lasts for 2.000 years, resulting in the total (total?)
         extermination of the Masters.

- - -248.000 The  \'stree  retire  to  their  planet leaving droyne,
         vargr and humans to their own devices.

 -75.000 Nadir  of  droyne  race.  The mysterious "Grandfather"
         (\'stree wanderers)  visits about  20 droyne worlds and
         introduces the coyns.

     328 Foren Caliphren Doon is marooned on Frisini (later re-
         named Beck\'s World) in the Regina subsector.  He finds
         an ancient Master stasis field  and releases a Master.
         Establishing proper control of Doon without destroying
         his mind (completely) is difficult,  but  "Number One"
         has both time and patience.

     335 Doon  is  rescued.  Number One  decides  to search for
         other survivors.  As a cover  he makes  Doon establish
         the Octagon Society.

     423 The Master fissions.

     499 Number One  and his  "brother"  Number Two  decides to
         abandon the search and leaves for the core, where they
         intend to infiltrate the very top of Imperial society.
         Unfortunately  (for them)  upper-class  imperials rou-
         tinely employs psionic adepts as security guards,  and
         a Master-driven person is amazingly conspicious to the
         telepatically endowed.

     800 The Masters, now 32 in numbers,  succeeds in provoking
         the psionic suppressions in order to eliminate psionic
         adepts and lessen the risk of exposure. The move works
         to a degree,  but  the highest levels of  the Imperium
         continues to employ psionic adepts in secret.

    1116 The Masters unleashes a plot to eliminate Strephon and
         put a successor that they already controls on the Iri-
         dium Throne. The move is not totally succesful.

Provsional campaign outline:

  The players  are in year 1112 now.  In 1113 they will be sent
on a long exploration voyage into the Foreven and Far Frontiers
Sectors. Here, on the egde of charted space, they will encount-
er the planet of the  \'stree,  the first humans to have done so
for six or seven centuries.  On the surface the \'stree seems to
be just another low-tech barbarian culture, and the description
of them will be aimed at reinforcing that impression. You know;
big, strapping, muscular, spear-toting lizard-men wearing loin-
cloths  and tough expressions.  The \'stree elders will take the
opportunity to scan the player\'s ship\'s library data.  They get
suspicious over some clues to the existence of the Masters (Hey,
The Psionic Suppressions were rather conspicuous). They can\'t be
sure, but they decide to check it out. On leaving,  the captain
will recieve a \'stree servant  ("We have  a parting present for
you, Captain.").  If nessessary with a little pressure  ("Oh, I
couldn\'t accept that."  "Suit yourself; in that case we\'ll have
to excecute him...").

  They should return to  The Spinward Marches in 1116,  just in
time for the s**t to hit the fan. First the \'stree will somehow
manipulate  the  players  into a  round trip of  The Marches in
order to look for proof of the existence of the Masters, culmi-
nating in a visit to Twilights Peak. Next they will have to vi-
sit several of the warring  factions in order to discover which
one is controlled by the Masters. An extremely vicious fight to
eliminate  said Masters follows.  Finally, their  \'stree friend
will agree to help them clean up the mess and restore The Impe-
rium, but they\'ll have to figure out how by themselves.

  Well, there you have it. Any comments?

PS. This is my third attempt at gettng this posting out.
    Hope it finally makes it. (Sigh).

TEXT RECORDERS

At tech level 10, text recorders can transcribe: that is,
they can produce written text directly from spoken words.

Information is recorded on small tape cassettes costing Cr3.
At tech level 13, data is recorded on holographic crystals
instead. Tapes can hold approximately 20 million worlds; crystals
can hold ten times that. At tech level 10, text recorders can
transcribe spoken voice to written text automatically.  Memclips
for specific languages are also available: each allows
transcribing from a specific spoken language.

SOUND RECORDERS

Very small, pencil-sized recorders appear at tech level 10,
and can easily record anything detectable by the human ear. 
Dedicated computer software within the recorder allows the user
to instantly playback any part of a recording. By  tech level 13,
sound recorders use holographic crystals as the recording media.

IMAGE RECORDERS

Two-dimensional images remain the most common method of image
recording, with the speed and ease of use improving dramatically
at higher tech levels. Although holography is generally invented
around tech level 7,  inexpensive and practical methods to
produce and view still holographic images are not perfected until
tech level 11.  Inexpensive 2 dimensional image recordings
(snapshots) are still a popular alternative to 3 dimensional
images beyond tech level 11.

Two-dimensional Still Camera: The tech level 10 still
camera is inexpensive, easy to use, and produces detailed images
that can be viewed instantly.  The \'recording card\' used to
record images is re-useable.

Three-dimensional Still Camera:  In spite of the
awkwardness of using the first marginally portable 3 dimensional
still cameras (which require a seperate power pack) at tech level
11, 3 dimensional image recorders are in public demand, because
of their advantages over the 2 dimensional machines.  At tech
level 13, with the advent of compact batteries providing the
necessary sustained power level, 3 dimensional still cameras
reach handheld  size.

VIDEO RECORDERS

Even though holovision typically becomes available at tech
level 10, producing holovideos still requires expensive, bulky
equipment and high power at that tech level.  Often, not until
tech level 13 are effective techniques devised for producing
inexpensive holovideos with simple, lightweight equipment.

Two-dimensional Video Recorder:  Electronic recorder of
visual images, either as single frames or sequential motion
pictures using integral camera and lens system.  Information is
recorded on small visual tape cassettes for later viewing.  At
tech level 13, recording is on holographic crystals. Each tape
can hold 60,000 distinct images or one hour of motion pictures;
crystals can hold ten times that amount.

Three-dimensional Video Recorder:   The 3 dimensional
video recorder is barely portable at tech level 13.  More
portable units are commonly available by tech level 14, with tech
level 15 bringing forth the handheld 3 dimensional recorder.  All
of these recorders use holocrystals for image storage.  Separate
powerpacks are not needed.

This errata announcement does not include anything mentioned 
in earlier errata listings, namely, the Errata list dated 
4/1/88.

According to Group Digest (editors of MegaTraveller), this 
earlier errata is nescesary for this errata to make sense.
In at least one case, this new errata makes changes in the
old errata (fun fun fun!!! :-)

I posted the Errata dated 4/1/88 to this mailing list 
sometime this past summer.  The moderator of this list may 
still have a copy available in an archive somewhere for those 
of you who missed it, if not, drop me a message and I can try 
to mail you a copy. I can\'t guarentee anything, our mailer 
here has a heck of time figuring out UUCP addresses.

MegaTraveller Errata, 10/01/88

PLAYERS\' MANUAL

    Page 15, Aging (clarification): The aging rules used when a
character reaches age 34 and beyond apply during play as well as
during character generation. This is hinted at on page 16 in the
paragragh on disability, but never explicity stated in the rules.
If any character has a birthday during an adventure session and
reaches one of the ages shown on an Aging Table row (page 47), that
character must immediately make the indicated saving throws to
avoid losing UPP points.

    Pages 20, 22, 24, Mustering Out Benefit Rolls
(correction): The Mustering Out Benefits tables shown do not
match the text on page 17. The correct table, which matches the
text, is shown below:

    MUSTERING OUT BENEFITS
    Per term of service .....1
    Rank 1 or 2 .............1
    Rank 3 or 4 .............2
    Rank 5 or 6 .............3

    Notice the rank bonus rolls are mutually exclusive. In other
words, a character who is rank 5 or 6 gets 3 extra rolls; he does
not count as rank 1, 2, 3, or 4.

    Page 51, Military Occupational Speciality Table
(correction): Die roll 2 under Infantry, Commando, and Ship\'s
troops should be Cbt Rifleman skill, not Gun Cbt.

    Page 54, Advanced Naval Characters (omission): The
Technical branch assignment resolution table is missing. Here it
is:

    Page 55, Engineering school (addition): Under the Special
Assignments column, add Naval Architect to the list of skills
available at engineering school. This way, naval characters can
acquire Naval Architect skill.

    Page 66, Tactical points pool (addition): Some referees
have reported that their players are abusing the tactical points
pool. The intent of tactical points is to simulate the effect of
tactics skill being shared among the group before and during the
fight. This leads to some suggestions to avoid abusive use of the
tactical points pool:

    * The single highest tactics skill level from among the group
represents the maximum possible draw from the pool available at any
one time. Thus, if the highest tactics skill possesed by any one
character in the group is tactics-3, the maximum draw at any one
time is 3.

    * If the referee feels a questionable use of tactics points is
occuring (such as a character with handgun-0 using 8 points from
the tactics pool to get a good chance of getting a hit), force the
player to roll a special communications task (using whatever is
appropriate: radio, shouting, etc.) with another character who has
tactics skill. If the communication is successful, the handgun-0
character may only draw as many tactical points from the pool as
the character he communicated with has as a tactics skill level.
However, the referee should only use this task as a last resort to
keep abuses in line: the questionable situation has to be really
"stretching it" before this rule should be used.

    * Characters do not have to contribute all their tactics skill
as points to the pool. They may hoard some of their tactics skill
for themselves, creating their own private tactical pool. This may
sometimes be out of character, however.

    Page 68, Interrupt restrictions (revision): Strike the
rule that states "a unit cannot interrupt the turn of another on
his own side." The idea with this rule was to avoid a complicated
chain of interrupts. However, as some players have pointed out,
sometimes a character on your own side may do something stupid, and
it makes sense to be able to interrupt either to help him out or to
try and stop him. The rule of "no more than one interrupt per side"
serves quite well to keep interrupts in check.

    Page 72, Line of Sight, Obstructions, Cover, and
Sighting (clarifications and additions): The following rules
more clearly explain line of sight, obstructions, cover, and
spotting. (Oh! Now I see! ...Ed.)



LINE OF SIGHT: INDOOR COVER 

    Indoors, three main types of cover are available: corners,
consoles (or furniture), and machinery.  

    Corners: Doorways and bends in corridors constitute corners for
the purpose of determining cover. It is of course possible to use
such obstructions to interrupt the line of sight completely, and
thus be considered hidden.

    A character behind such a corner may, however, lean out from
behind it and fire. For targeting purposes the character is
considered to be under cover, but visible in the square into which
he is leaning.

    Consoles (or Furniture): Units may crouch behind consoles
and thus be counted as hidden (unable to fire or be fired upon).

    Alternatively, they may partially expose themselves and fire
(and be fired at), in which case they are considered to be under
cover, but visible for any fire directed at them.  

    Machinery: A unit adjacent to machinery may fire through it
and be fired upon through it.

    The unit adjacent to the machinery square is considered to be
under cover but visible unless the firing unit is also adjacent to
the same machinery square-in which case, neither is considered to
be under cover.

    If neither the firing unit nor the target unit are adjacent to
the machinery square through which a line of sight would pass, the
machinery square becomes an obstruction, and the line of sight may
not pass through it.

LINE OF SIGHT: ILLUMINATION AND DARKNESS

    Combat generally takes place in an indoor or outdoor location
that is well-lit. When combat takes place in darkness, vision is
impaired.

    Characters or robots may turn off inside lights using switches
placed on walls or bulkheads near portals.  The referee may specify
that certain areas are in darkness due to power or system failure.

    Combat outdoors at night also takes place in darkness.

    Depending on the amount of background light available, the
referee must decide whether the darkness is partial or total
(partial darkness is more common). When an area is in darkness, use
the visibility and spotting rules.

    When in darkness, increase the difficulty of all "to hit" and
spotting tasks by one level.

    Darkness does not apply if the weapon, character, robot, or
vehicle has vision enhancement devices.



LINE OF SIGHT: VISIBILITY AND SPOTTING

    Basic combat provides some simple visibility and spotting rules
in the form of the cover status: under cover, but visible, and
hidden.  These rules introduce a new type of cover status: under
cover, not visible.  This cover status means you can see the enemy,
but he can\'t see you.

    At the ground scale covered in most outdoor combat sessions, few
playing areas cover an area more than serveral hundred meters,
which is well within normal visibility ranges. As a result, the
primary limitation on line of sight which provides for an under
cover, not visible status is target concealment.

    The indoor visibility is generally a problem only when darkness
(either partial or total) exists.

    The following discussion further defines how line of sight
works.

    Units: Characters, animals, robots, and ground vehicles do not
block line of sight.

    Hills: Hills block the line of sight.  

    Vegetation: Trees block the line of sight, with certain
modifications.  Units on the ground (or flying nap-of-earth) cannot
see through dense trees, but can see through up to 50 meters of
sparse trees (to medium range).

    Observation from above is also affected by tree covered areas.

    In dense trees, the sky is considered entirely locked by
branches, leaves, or the equivalent; thus units in dense trees may
not see or be seen if the line of sight passes through this canopy.

    In sparse tree areas, this canopy is broken; a vehicle in the
air may see though the canopy (and be seen) for a radius on the
ground equal to 20% of the vehicle\'s altitude above the ground; for
example, a vehicle at 250 meters altitude can see (and be seen by)
a unit on the ground up to 50 meters away from the point directly
below the vehicle.

    Trees vary in height, but average about 10 to 30 meters; the
leaf canopy may begin at varying heights, but should average half
the height of the trees.

    Undergrowth has no effect on the line of sight.  

    Buildings: Buildings block the line of sight. Units in
buildings and who are not on the ground floor can see units not
adjacent to lower obstacles.  Buildings are 4 meters tall per
story.

    Smoke Screens: The line of sight terminates at a smoke screen.
Smoke screens are 15 meters high.  

    Under Cover, Not Visible (Concealed): Terrain features
which do not block the line of sight, however, may make a unit
harder to see.

    Characters, animals, or robots are concealed if they are in an
area of trees or undergrowth. Vehicles are concealed in areas which
contains both sparse trees and any kind of undergrowth (dense or
sparse).  

    Units may also be deliberately camouflaged. If a unit is
concealed at the beginning of the combat session, the referee may
allow it to be counted as camouflaged.  If so, it remains
camouflaged until it moves for the first time.

    In partial darkness, all units beyond medium range are
considered concealed.

    In total darkenss, all units beyond short range are considered
concealed.

    Hidden Units: In some terrain, units may choose to be hidden.
This choice is possible for characters, animals, or robots in
buildings, gullies, field fortifications, directly behind walls, or
just over the crest of a hill. Vehicles can choose to be hidden if
directly behind hillcrests or stationary in buildings.

    The decision to be hidden is made at the beginning of an unit\'s
turn and applies until the next combat round. Hiding units may not
be spotted; if already spotted they remain spotted as long as they
do not move - hiding units may not spot, fire, or perform any other
activities requiring observation of the area; they are "keeping
their heads down."

    Spotting Concealed Units: Units which have not been spotted
by the enemy may be kept off the playing surface; their positions
(and movements) should be recorded for later verification if a
dispute arises. This may be done on a small map of the area, with
written descriptions, or by using small cards or markers on the
playing surface in place of the unit. In the last case, also use
several dummy markers to confuse the enemy.



    To spot a concealed unit:

    Difficult, Recon, absolute: 1 combat round

    Referee: Make one roll for each concealed unit, applying the
best recon skill from among any of the opposing units with a
potential line of sight to the concealed unit.

    Decrease the difficulty of this task one level if:

    * The concealed unit is moving (a popup doesn\'t count as
movement in this case);

    * The concealed unit fired a high-signature weapon. In darkness,
this applies to a moderate signature as well.

    Increase the difficulty of this task one level if:

    * The concealed unit is camouflaged;

    * The range from the potential spotting unit(s) to the concealed
unit is beyond very long range. Decrease this to medium range for
partial darkness, and to short range for total darkness.

    * For darkness, increase the difficulty of all spotting tasks by
one level.

LINE OF SIGHT: SMOKE

    Line of sight terminates upon encountering a smoke screen.  

    Some weapons are listed as having a smoke round available. All
such rounds have a specific screen length given in the weapons
table.

    On the combat round of impact, one marker is placed on the
playing surface in the square of impact.  On the the next combat
round, a second marker is placed in a square adjacent to and
downwind of the first marker (use the scatter procedure if the wind
direction is unknown).

    Once the screen has reached its screen length, the round ceases
to generate smoke and the screen begins to dissipate. On the next
combat round, remove one marker from the upwind end of the screen.
On the next combat sound, remove another marker, and so on. 
Continue this procedure until the smoke screen is gone.  

    Fire: Brush fires and structural fires both produce smoke. In
both cases, the length of the smoke screen is 50 meters.

    As with a smoke round, one smoke marker is added to the screen
downwind of the fire each turn until the maximum length is reached.
Unlike a smoke round, the screen is not removed after it reaches
its maximum length, but rather remains in place until the fire
stops burning.



    Page 72, Line of Fire (addition): The target closest to the
firing unit and in the line of fire is attacked first, ignoring all
friendly units. However, if exceptional failure occurs when rolling
for a hit, then friendly units are included when determining the
closest target. (In other words, don\'t get exceptional failure or
you may hit some of your own guys who happen to be in the line of
fire!)

    Pages 72,73, Danger Space (omission): The danger space for
flechette rounds applies only along the line of fire and is not
circular like the danger space for all other rounds.

    Page 72, Vehicle Hit Value (addition): For purposes of
personal combat only, multiply a vehicle\'s hit value by 10 before
starting the combat session. For example, a ground car lists hull
hits of 2/5. Its actual hit value in personal combat is 20/50
(multiplied by 10). In a similiar manner, its locomotion and power
plant hits are each 10/20 (1/2 multiplied by 10). Use the
unmodified values for starship combat rather than personal combat
(see the errata entry for Referee\'s Manual page 94, Power Plant-n).

    Page 73, Pinpoint location (suggestion): Some players have
reported abuses with the pinpoint hit location rule as written,
since specifying such a shot reduces the target\'s armor rating by
one-half. An easy fix is to change the rule to increase the task in
difficulty one level when a pinpoint location is specified, rather
than requiring exceptional success. This makes a pinpoint location
shot work the same as a shot at a small target (page 69).
Increasing the difficulty for a pinpoint location hit also works
nicely because if the player wants to take great care in making the
shot, he can try for a cautious attempt. Many players will feel the
increase in difficulty is not worth the lowered armor rating, which
ends the abuse problem.

    Page 76, Gauss Rifle (correction): Dmg column for the Gauss
Rifle (4mm) should be 4, not 3.

Page 76, Assault Rifle and Advanced Combat Rifle (correction): The
Assault Rifle (5mm and 7mm), as well as the Advanced Combat Rifle
(7mm and 9mm) should both be given 2 autofire targets. Both of
these weapon types are capable of automatic fire.

    Page 78, Grenade Launchers (correction): The HE and HEAP
pen/atten values were accidentally switched on all the grenade
launchers. HEAP rounds are designed to pierce armor and thus have a
greater penetration than HE rounds.

sentence "If the goods are cargo (carried for a fee of Cr1,000 per
ton..." should say "If the goods are freight (carried for a fee of
Cr1,000 per ton..."

    Page 60, Panel add-ons (clarification): Panel add-ons can
be installed to augment a craft\'s control panel needs. The power
and volume requirements of an add-on is usually superior to that of
straight control panel units for a given CP value. In all cases, a
control panel add-on can act as a direct replacement for weaker
control panel units. However, as a rule of thumb, do not install
any more control panel add-ons than you expect to have crew
members. It is a bit ridiculous to install 10 large holodisplays
when you only expect to have one crew member.

Also, holodynamic linked and holographic linked panel units both
refer to the same type of panel unit.

    Page 62, Hull Design (clarification): To determine the
values for a non-standard hull size, just extrapolate the values
from the closest hull size using the following formula to determine
the modification factor:


    F = N / B

    Where:
    F = the factor to apply to the base hull values.
    N = the desired non-standard hull size.
    B = the closest standard hull size to use as a base.

    For example, if a 440 UCP hull size is desired, simply multiply
the values for a 400 UCP hull by a factor of 1.1 (440/400). If, on
the other hand, a 460 UCP hull is desired, then multiply the values
for a 500 UCP hull by a factor of 0.92 (460/500).

    Page 63, Step 5, Craft Configuration and Streamlining
(clarification): Here are definitions for the various streamlined
configurations:

    Unstreamlined: No attempt has been made to streamline the
hull. Many protrusions and irregularities exist which significantly
increase the vessel\'s drag, making it difficult or impossible to
operate the craft in an atmosphere at a high rate of speed.

    Streamlined: Various cowlings and farings have been added to
the hull to streamline it for operation in an atmosphere, although
the streamlining is less than that provided by an airframe. This
configuration is equivalent to the "partially streamlined"
configuration found in High Guard.

    Airframe: The hull has been designed for high performance in
an atmosphere. In order to achieve such performance, exterior
design has been a priority. This configuration is equivalent to the
"streamlined" configuration found in High Guard.

    Page 64, Step 1, Fuel Cells (clarification): The minimum
tech level for the fuel cells shown is tech level 10.

    Page 65, Step 3, Jump Units Required (correction): The
Jump-4 entry for a size of 75,000 is incorrect. It should be 3750,
not 2750.

    Page 67, Step 2, Meson Communicators (correction): Meson
communicator, planetary range, TL 20, is given a weight of 0.2. It
should be 2.0.

    Page 67, Step 4, Laser Communicators (correction): The
price note should say: If TL8, x2. The tech level 16 column should
read: -, -, 0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.006, 0.010. The tech level 17
column should read: -, -, 0.001, 0.001, 0.003, 0.005, 0.010. 

    Page 67, Step 5, Maser (Microwave) Communicators
(correction): The price note should say: If TL8, x2. The entry
for a tech level 8 V. Distant maser communicator should be 0.032,
not 0.32. The tech level 16 column should read: -, 0.002, 0.003,
0.004, 0.007, 0.010, 0.040.

    Page 68, Step 2, Radio Jammers (correction): The entry
for a tech level 9 Continental radio jammer should be 0.0026, not
0.002. The tech level 10 entry on the same line (next column over)
should be 0.002, not 0.0026.

    Page 71, Step 3, Meson Gun Table (correction): The factor
K meson gun should have a volume of 110000 not 11000.

    Page 72, Step 7, 100-ton Missile Bays (addition): The
100-ton missile bays stop at UCP factor 9, while 50-ton missile
bays go all the way to UCP factor C. The correctly extended 100-ton
missile bay entry is:

100-Ton Bay Weaponry        ----TL of the weapon----
TL Type   Power Weight MCr  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21

    Page 72, Step 8, 50-ton Bay Weaponry (correction): The TL
9 column should be empty for the Plasma Gun, Fusion Gun, and
Repulsor. The prices for these weapons are missing-the correct
values are: Plasma Gun, MCr5; Fusion Gun, MCr8; and Repulsor, MCr6.
The Plasma and Fusion Gun Bays are incorrect. They should be:

50-Ton Bays                  ----UCP at Tech Level----
TL Type       Power  Wt MCr  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21

    Page 74, Step 16, Disintegrator Turrets (correction):
The disintegrator turret example is confusing. A better example is
5 turrets with 10 disintegrators (tech level 18) produces a UCP
disintegrator factor of 3.

    Page 74, Step 14, Fusion Turrets (correction): The Fusion
Gun Turrets table is incorrect. The correct table is presented
below:

Fusion Gun Turrets                    ----UCP Factor----
TL Type             Power  Wt  Price  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A

    Page 76, 77, Flechette pen (correction): The "Pen" column
for flechette rounds should be labeled "Dgr" (for danger space)
instead. The penetration for flechette rounds is equal to the HE
penetration for the same sized round.

    Page 77, HIVEL Gun Ammunition (correction): Tech level 8
ammunition volume and weight should be 0.014 not 0.14.

    Page 81, Step 4, Control Panel Units (clarification):
The first sentence "Select and install enough control panel
units..." should instead read "Select and install enough control
panel units and control panel add-ons..."

    Page 82, Step 3, Reduced Vehicle Gunners (revision): The
formula for reducing vehicle gunners penalizes a design that has
increased sensors, which was not what was intended. The following
formula fixes this problem:  X=(C+S)/W.

    Page 82, Extended Accomodations Table (clarification): A
low berth holds one individual, and is essentially a specialized
bunk. An emergency low berth holds 4 individuals on a short-term
emergency basis only. The volume of all accommodations was doubled
from the original volumes given in High Guard to allow for access -
what good does it do to put in a bunk if you can\'t get to it?

    Page 87, Agility (clarification): In the old original High
Guard system, agility was defined as an attribute of maneuver
drive, that is "how effectively can my drive out-maneuver yours".
In the new MegaTraveller rules, separating out weight and volume
into unique craft attributes made it clear that agility needed to
be more precisely defined as its own unique attribute related to
ship mass, not to ship speed.

    Under the new rules agility is defined as the "ability to change
your craft\'s orientation over time", which is more a function of
ship mass than of ship speed. Under this new definition, it becomes
immediately obvious that smaller vessels will tend to have a
greater agility than larger vessels. Consider: which is faster, the
Queen Mary, or a rowboat? Which can change its heading more
quickly? The rowboat has the greater agility, even though its
"maneuver drive" speed rating is far less than the Queen Mary\'s.

    Page 88, Passive Energy Pinpoint Table (correction): The
table at the top of the second column on the page is mistakenly
labeled as "Passive Energy Scan Ability", and should instead be
labeled "Passive Energy Pinpoint Ability".

    Page 92, Sensor Operation Tasks (correction): The word
Difficult is incorrectly used in the sensor task for locating a
target (on the bottom of the left column). The word should be
(Difficulty), meaning a variable difficulty is used on this task.
The referee notes for this task explain how to arrive at the proper
difficulty level by using the starship\'s UCP.

    Page 94, DMs for Ship Damage Tables (revision): Change
the wording of the sentence that says "If the weapon inflicting the
hit has a UCP factor of ..." to read: "If the weapon inflicting the
hit is a spinal mount, apply a DM of +6".

    Page 94, Power Plant-n (clarification): Reduce the UCP
power plant factor of the target vessel by 10% (minimum of 1) for
each -n level hit. For example, the Mercenary Cruiser in the
Imperial Encyclopedia (800-ton displacement) has a power plant UCP
factor of 20/40. A power plant-1 hit reduces this by 2 (10% of 20)
to 18/40. Once the UCP factor is reduced to one half (10/40),
spinal mount weapons (if any) no longer work, and the maneuver
drive rating drops by one half. An additional 5 hits on the
Mercenary Cruiser would render the ship\'s power plant inoperative. 

    Any additional hits once the inoperative level is reached are
applied at 10% damage against the right-hand value (for the
Mercenary Cruiser, this reduces the 40 on the right by 4 for each
level of power plant hit). If the right-hand number reaches zero,
the power plant is destroyed beyond repair.

    Page 95, Black/White Globes (clarification): Treat white
globes just like black globes, except a ship mounting a white globe
can see out, maneuver, and fire. All other effects are the same. A
black globe that is totally on shows up on enemy sensors as a
"hole" in space. The prudent commander will flicker his black globe
to allow enough emissions from his ship to escape so as to blend in
with background levels and effectively be invisible to enemy
sensors (roll 1D x 10% to determine the flicker rate needed to
currently match local background levels). A shrewd commander will
flicker a white globe for exactly the same effect.

    Page 97, Starship Combat penetration task
(clarification): The task for penetrating a defense in starship
combat is confusing. A clearer way to express the task is:



    To penetrate a defense in starship combat:
    Difficult, Off=computer size, penetration table DM; Def=computer
size (confrontation)



    Notice the penetration table DM belongs under the offensive DMs
and is added, rather than a defensive DM that is subtracted.

    Page 98, Table 1, Disintegrators (revision): The current
Disintegrator Table makes disintegrators a weapon that is not very
lethal, and (since they are outrageously expensive) not very cost
effective. This was not the intent for these very high tech
weapons. The following table properly upgrades disintegrators to a
much more lethal and cost-effective weapon, as was originally
intended:

    Also, move disintegrators from the Sand and Beam table to the
Repulsor table. The second table should now say "Repulsor or
Disintegrator".

    Page 101, Starship Damage Tables (correction): Strike the
entry for disintegrators under the interior explosion table.
Disintegrators only use the surface explosion table, which may give
an interior explosion as a result. The surface damage table is the
only way disintegrators can end up rolling on the interior
explosion table.

I\'m in the process of redesigning the Traveller starship combat
rules for an upcoming campaign.  The rules given in the basic
3-book set are playable, but not nearly detailed enough.  I would
at the very least like to add in some maneuvering rules to give
it more of a classic dogfight-in-space flavor.

I\'ve read the High Guard rules a few times and found them all
but incomprehensible.  At best, they seem cut out for mass
engagements and not very well-suited to small scenarios.

Is there anyone out there who has a reasonably detailed yet 
playable set of rules for small-scale starship combat?  If so,
would you be so kind as to post or email them?

I\'d also be interested in references to published material on
the subject.

Many Thanks,
Edward J. Driscoll

I am also trying to redesign the rule.  They are too abstract and
simplified for my taste. 

Dogfight?  I don\'t think you are going to do much dogfighting with
these kind of weaponry and speed.  When you get into a range where
you can dogfight, it\'s within visual range- and with the kind of weapon
you have, it\'s suicide.

True, and there\'s too much obsolete baggage from the old traveller.

I am in the process of designing one- and it\'s pretty drastic.
I am drawing materials from Harpoon- the naval wargame. 
I am throwing away factors and missles- they are ridiculous.
I am emphasizing on sensors/EW since the one with the first shot
is going to have huge advanage with these kind of weapons.
I am trying to base damage on points.

>I\'d also be interested in references to published material on

Try Traveller 2300\'s Star Cruiser.  It\'s not Traveller competible,
but it got some useful ideas.

I like the idea of jump gates, they make starflight easier in civilized
areas without making it so in not-so-civilized areas.

I like this interpretation:

    Any vessel can enter a jump gate.  If it has no jump drive, the
    distance it will travel will depend on the gate\'s jump rating.

This rule lets player start out with a non-jump ship without requiring
them to do all adventuring in one star system.  It makes the "entry cost"
for civilized-area adventures less (important if no one mustered out
with big bucks or a used ship) and gives them a chance to build up some
bucks for an upgrade to jump capability.

    If a vessel primed for jump enters the gate, the NET jump will be
    the vessel\'s jump rating, PLUS the gate\'s jump rating PLUS 1.

This lets a gate function as a "first stage" to kick a starship out
farther than it could get on its own, and thus deeper into adventure.

It also makes retreat a somewhat lengthier affair, since two jumps
(at least) will be needed to get back.  The plus 1 added above gives
a bit of an inducement to use the double jump field, since you will
likely get further than with two separate jumps.

If you want the jump-6 limit to still hold, we can assume gates are
limited to jump-5.  The net effect goes like this: the gate jumps the
ship to its destination (1 week) and as the ship materializes at the
destination, and before the jump field from the gate collapses, the ship
jumps again, using residual energy of the collapsing field.  The ship
"stutters", jump-1 (another week) and finally the ship\'s normal jump
(three weeks total.   The net effect maxes out at jump-12, (jump-6
ship approaching jump-5 gate) which takes 3 weeks, and costs just less
than two jumps of jump-6 (two weeks) in a jump-6-equipped starship.
At that limit, effectiveness is a judgement call.  Below the limit,
(say, jump-3) the gate\'s effectiveness is plain.

Of course, the players will find a bill waiting for use of the gate when
they get back.  Or maybe you charge them as they approach.

I\'ve been catching up on the jump gate discussion, and I\'d like to add a few
points.  First, the original proposal would be least likely to seriously
effect game balance.  If the gates increase the range of a jump-capable ship,
or make it possible for ships without J-drives to jump, J-drive ships would
vanish from the main trade routes as quickly as jump gates were established.
The cost savings from a smaller (or no) jump drive are too much for Tukera,
et.al. to pass up.  I do think, however, that they should not be available 
before tech 15.

Secondly, I think payment would certainly be made *before* the jump.  It\'s
too easy to vanish in the depths of space to risk any other means of payment.
If the cost to build the gate is low enough, and the company that develops them
is in the shipping business, however, then they might prefer not to allow
anyone else to use the gate.  It might be enough of a competitive advantage 
to justify the expense.

On the subject of control, it seems that the jump *must* be controlled by
the more capable computer at the gate station (heh, heh).  This also adds a
handy way to waylay characters that have upset the local megacorporation,
as well as a way to direct them where the referee wants them.

Overall, I find the idea interesting, but I\'m not sure I\'m ready to add
them to my game.  If anyone decides to playtest these, I\'d like to hear
about the results.

Hey guys and gals,
	Anybody interested in a Traveller PBEM?  I\'ll use the new Mega Traveller
rules for creating characters, but I\'ll use the old rules (modified a little) to
do the rest of the work.  I will run one, if I get enough responses, from now until, May \'89.  Turns will run about once every 7-14 days, and you need not 
know that much about the game.  I have no set limit on the number of players,
but I will make one, after I get all the responses.
	For now, just mail me a character, from MegaTraveller Rules, and your
address.  And hopefully we will be playing soon.

PS: I will allow you to have the enhanced characters from the MegaTraveller
    rules, but they can only be 30 yrs old (max).

PPS: If you don\'t have the new MegaTraveller rules, use the old ones.

I have a hybrid game of Traveller and FTL 2448 running on my sytem, and I
am in need of players.  We have 4 so far, and I need 3 more.  If you are
in the San Diego area (or can call it via PC Pursuit), and would like to 
play, call The Dream Clinic at 670-9522 (300-1200-2400, 24hrs per day, 7
days per week, ANSI and normal ASCII available).  Thanks!

Date: 132-1117
Place:  onboard the Free Trader Ulysses, in Jump Space

In the Passengers\' Common Room:

	A man, in his late twenties, but showing the wear on his face of a 
thirty-four year old, calls for attention.  You all are sitting in the G-
cushion chairs around the room, looking over the situation.  He introduces
himself as Captain Jordan Moray, owner of the Free Trader Ulysses.  "I\'m glad
to see so many people able to make the journey, and before I go asking your
permission to know your names, I\'ll inform you all on our destination.  As 
you know, we have just left Pysadi (in Rhylandor Sub Sector of Spinward 
Marches), and are heading for Aramanx.  Now this is a standard two week 
journey, and if any of you are familiar with the navigation of a starship, you
realize that we are going to have to make a second jump to get to our
destination.
	Now for easiness, and quickness of the journey, my Navigator, Erekosse
Wildantor, has picked a refueling stop at Lewis.  There is a Gas Giant where we
can refuel quite easily, in about four or five hours, and then be off to Aramanx
.  If you wish to see the data on Lewis or Aramanx, you can use the terminal
right over there."  He points to a sitdown, old fashion, video display terminal
in the corner of the room.  "Now if you would all do me the honor, I would like
to know your names, and let\'s start with . . . you miss."  
	A five foot, seven inch tall brown haired lady, looks around, and then 
says, "Well my name is Samantha, and I used to be in the Scout Service."
	"And why are you journeying with us, if I might ask," says the Captain.
	"Oh, I\'m just going to see a friend who used to be in the service with 
me.  I haven\'t seen him in almost 6 years."  She looks to be maybe thirty-two
at the most, and in prime condition.
	"Next," says the Captain.
	"My name is Erc Haven, and I\'m retired from the Navy.  I just happen 
to be spending my retirement pay visiting as many worlds as I can."  He is 
a well built man, in his mid thirties.  He stands at least six feet in height,
with sandy-blonde hair, and a build that would make Arnold Schwartzanieger 
proud. (I think I misspelled Arnies\' name :-)
	"And you sir," the captain points to a man sitting at a Hologame.
	"Me, well . . . my name is Steven Cortland, ex-Marine.  I\'m just trying 
to find some place to settle down, and I\'m hoping that Aramanx is the 
place for me."  Steven has red-blonde cropped hair, military style, with a 
mustache.  He stands about five-eleven, adn has a medium build.
	"Before you ask," says the man sitting with two other men around the
3-D chess board, "My name is Robert Riechten, and I\'m on a buisness trip for
a clothing manufacturer.  In fact, you have some of my clothing onboard." 
Robert is as average as they come, except for the scar on his neck that runs
from his left ear to the center of his throat.
	"I\'m Charlie," says the man sitting opposite Robert, "me and Dan here,"
pointing to the man on his right,"are computer experts who have a job on 
Aramanx.  We work for the BSP corporation, we design both ship and personal
computer software."
	"Hi, I\'m Dan," says the man to the right of Charlie.
	"What about you two," says the Captain to two men sitting reading 
magazines.
	"I\'m Moe," says the black haired one, "and this is Curly," pointing to
the man on his right, "and that\'s all you need to know."
	"Right, well I hope you all have a pleasant first day with us, and I
hope the rest of the journey will be quite pleasant.  I must ask that if you 
wish to go on a tour of the ship, or just roam around, you call us on the
intercom besides the door next to the stairs.  Other than that, lunch will 
be served in three hours."


- ----well this is the beginning, what are you going to all do

Note:
	All of your weapons (i.e. pistols, rifles, blades) are in the ships\'
locker, if you wish to have smuggled one into your stateroom, ask me with 
your response

PS:  Respond by Dec. 14, so I can do the next turn before my break, on
     the 17th.
