Pocket Empire Report #0 - Initial Data

Aoreriyya Region of Reavers\' Deep Sector

"Aoreriyya" is an Aslan word which is best translated as "New Veldt"; it is
the Aslan name for this region of space.  Aoreriyya is a vague astrographic
region which includes most of subsectors J, K, N, and O of Aeitle Sakh sector,
better known in Galanglic as Reavers\' Deep.  It was applied by early Clan
explorers because of the relatively large number of worlds with climates
and ecosystems well-suited to Aslan comfort.

Early Solomani explorers named this region ??.


Subsectors    Name
=--=========--================
J  0921-1630  Ea
K  1721-2430  Drexilthar
N  0931-1640  Eakoi
O  1731-2440  (unknown)
=--=========--================

To use the subsector data with Cynthia Higginbotham\'s SSV program,
simply cut apart each subsector (they start with the "@name lines",
and each one is in order).


Classic Traveller Data

Three subsectors need star generation, and two subsectors need names
for the worlds.  I note that there is quite a mix of Aslani and
Solomani names in this area, perhaps some folks out there can suggest
names so we can fill in that part.  It would be nice to get somewhat
of a mix of different Solomani languages, and get some Aslan names
too (we can always use a random generator for that, though).  The
unnamed worlds are identified as ?-#### (where #### is the hex number).

Since most of this area has never been a part of the Third Imperium, there
are a decent number of established polities.  Presumably, some of these
will form the nucleus for Hard Times and New Era polities, while some of the
Non-Aligned worlds will band to gether to form totally new polities.

Assigning Stars

Steve Higginbotham writes:
We have 105 worlds here, of which 27 have their stars already, I
believe.  So we need stars for 78 worlds.  Assuming normal distribution,
we should have 43 M\'s, 11 K\'s, 9 G\'s, 13 F\'s, and 2 A\'s.  So let\'s be
arbitrary and burn some of those G\'s for all the Ag and Ri worlds left.
Of course, there are 28 Ag, Ri, or Ag Ri worlds without stars, so we\'ll
need to use up most of the K\'s and F\'s getting them decent stars...


Toward the New Era

During Hard Times, and up to the onset of the Virus, some polities will
decide that its time to become Reavers in the Grand Old Tradition (RitGOT).

Near the beginning of the Rebellion, a relatively large group of (alien
minor race or races) fled Solomani persecution into Aoreriyya.  They passed
through Carrillian Assembly (through Carrill and/or Lanaxion) on their way
to a suitable colony world.  Their transporation was two or three very
large (100,000-ton+) imperial-design bulk transports, with over 100,000
colonists in cold sleep, and such supplies as could be transported.

During the Rebellion and Hard Times, the area recives a continuing trickle
of refugees (especially minor-race aliens seeking refuge from Solomani
opression).

An idealistic Imperial officer and the remains of her CruRon (badly damaged
in the initial fighting; only 2 ships are space-worthy, and only one could
be called combat-ready) set course for the Deep.  These people are not
Reavers, but an idealistic, pro-Imperium, good-guy group who are trying to
recreate in microcosm all of the good things the Imperium has lost in the
Rebellion.  The choose a relatively good world, and play Guardian Angel.

And of course, the usual mob of desperadoes generated by Hard Times.
Some Vargr may even show up to join in the fun.

All of this section is still fluid, and Mike Metlay\'s Near Miss will
probably fit into it somewhere.

And then the Virus hits.

Library Data and Other Information

The following general on Ea data was printed in Far Traveller #1:

Originally Explored by Aslan traders and clan scouts looking for new
territory, the Ea subsector has been the scene of numerous
confrontations between Humans and Aslans in competition for the same
real estate.  During the era of the Reaver Warlords, several small human
states sprang up here; as a result, competition is stiff.

Two substantial human states, separated by a scattered band of unclaimed
independent worlds, dominate this region.  The Grand Duchy of Marlheim
is a tightly controlled, expansionist totalitarian state.  The
Confediracy of Duncinae is a less restrictive interstellar community
with close ties to the Principality of Caledon to coreward.

[TNE-POCKET: The Grand Duchy entered an internal civil war, primarily
 a struggle between Pendang and Marlheim for control of the polity
 (similar to the internal politics of the Sword Worlds).  The civil
 war causes this polity to be classified Red Zone for the duration.]

Htalrea, lying between the two states, is a primitive world hitherto of
greatest importance to Aslan traders.  It is the home of the risth, a
large, dangerous predator whose scent glands are a source for rare and
expensive perfumes.

Library Computer: The Reavers.  Name given to any of the petty warlords
or pirates who have operated in the area of space known as Reavers\'
Deep.  The first Reavers flourished in the region during the Long Night,
when individual warlords with a handful of working starships could
dominate several worlds.  Expansion by Aslan and Imperial interests into
the region, culminating in the Aslan Border Wars (ca. 200-380), led to a
lessening of the Reaver presence, but in the aftermath of those wars the
neutral strip of border worlds in the Deep [became] havens for criminals
and pirates.  To this day the name is sometimes applied, often in a
fanciful or romantic manner, to freebooters, pirates, privateers, or,
occasionally, to small interstellar states found in the area.

Library Computer: Tlaosierlahrau.  Also known as tlaospice, tlao, or
seasongold; a spice derived from the seed of tlaosier, a tree found on
Roakhioc[sic]/Ea in Reavers\' Deep.  The golden seed kernels, when ground,
produce a fragrant, light seasoning popular with both Aslan and Human
gourmets on meat, soups, and stews.  Because of the scarcity of
tlaosier, and the expense of shipping it, tlaospice commands an
impressive price of Cr 3 per gram in offworld markets.

Library Computer: Tlasayerlaahel.  Merchant corporation controlled by
the Yehaso clan, a strong Aslan group in Reavers\' Deep.  Tlasayerlaahel
is a powerful company with many interests in the Deep, among them the
tlaospice trade with Roakhoi, the rithscent trade with Htalrea, and some
commercial contact with the natives of Gaajpadge, from whome glasswares
and other objets d\'art are obtained.  Tlasayerlaahel is currently
engaged in stiff economic competition with the human merchants of
Caledon Ventures, Ltd. from Caledon/Caledon.


TNE-POCKET Data:

Union of Harmony:
Cynthia suggests that the Union of Harmony actually be a Confederation
wannabe:  they have applied for membership, and are busy showing how
zealously Solomaniac they are (being Chinese, they probably think this
whole Solomaniac shtick is drivel - they KNOW that being Chinese is far
more important than (and far superior to) anything else out there):-)).
This gives a good excuse for lots of Solomani support, with room for them
to be dropped like a hot rock when things start to look dark...

And although they are getting lots of Solomani support, they have to use
almost all of it to keep the Aslan out of their spinward border (and
therefore have very little resources left to do more than act obnoxious to
everyone else).  Once they stop recieving Solomani support, then they get
the nasty shock of finding out how alone they can be ...

Happy New Year!!

Thanks for the response on those 10mm Pulse rifles! Much appretiated.
I\'m gonna bug you a little more about weapons now, What about these laser
weapons?
Now, I have read all sorts of stuff on these "power packs" which are
unique for each different weapon, but I have no Idea about the size (vol)
of these things. I got a weight listing here in the Imperial Encyclopedia
that says a typical Laser Pistol-9 power pack should weigh 2 kg. Fantastic.
Now, depending upon the makeup of the power cell, the casing material
and what ever power flow governing equipment the little bugger has on it,
this means absolutely nothing to me. If we are talking heavy elements,
it is conceivable that the power cell is about the size of a typical
weapon clip for a slug thrower. (Yes, No, Maybe?)
Ahhhh, but then we take a little gaze at the weapons tables in the
Players Handbook and notice that a typical Laser Pistol-9 has a 50 shot
capacity per power cell. The plot thickens... And we see that a Laser
Pistol-13 (with a Power Cell weight of 1 kg) has a 200 shot capacity!
That\'s right, we have an increase of shot power per kilogram of factor 8!
Now, I have no problem with this as long as we are talking a backpack
that is akin to the size of a small Microwave oven. But we also have a
drawing of an imperial trooper on page 35 of the Rebellion Sourcebook
(Potential Boo-Hiss?) which depicts a Laser Pistol (I assume TL 13) with
the power link cord running behind him... He doesn\'t look too encumbered
to me. Now, I don\'t claim that artistic endeavors should become the be
all end all of judgement in this case, but I am REALLY confused.
And What about this 200 shots per magazine... How about clips that
contain 20 shots, which can load into the grips? Wisdom anyone? Advice?
Also, Can anybody direct me to some net accessible robot designs? I
got a lot of Scott Kellogg\'s designs (Cargo Lifters and Pizza Boxes)
but I have a great need for more.

Thanks, Happy New Year,
Anthony Neal

    'body' => 'Hey folx,

Guess I\'m a bit behind in the times, but I\'ve been a bit busy.  A
while back there was a thread on the TML about planetary
atmospheres.  Basically the argument went along the line that since
Earth has a standard atmosphere, a planet with a more dense
atmosphere in Traveller must have a more dense core than Earth.
I\'m afraid that is not the case.

You see any analysis of Earth\'s atmosphere has to take the actions
of Earth\'s Moon into account.  The moon is substantially larger
than any standard moon.  The Earth - Moon system is much more like
a double planetary system than a single planet with a regular moon.

The moon is so large and so close that it is slowly skimming off
the Earth\'s atmosphere, thinning it out.  Tidal action of the moon
actually gives escape velocity to some of Earth\'s upper atmosphere.

By contrast, Venus is slightly less dense than Earth (Surface
gravity 0.9G), yet it has an atmosphere of between 10 and 25
atmoshperes.  (CRC handbook Chem/Physics)  Why?  Venus has no moon,
not even tiny asteroid moons like Mars.

I also seem to remember reading an article a couple years back that
suggested Earth may have been hit by a small planetoid.  Approx
Mars size.  When the planetary core hit, it spread a large amount
of heavier metals over the surface of the planet.  That was
supposed to explain why there are measureable amounts of metals
like gold, silver, platinum, lead, copper, iron etc. etc. in the
crust instead of them being tied up in the core of the planet.

Catie?  You heard anything like that?  Or is there a more
conventional explanation for the distribution of metals in the
Earth\'s crust?

    'body' => 'Got an odd question for ya\'ll on psi shields:

Now, we know psi shields prevent a telepath from reading a person\'s
mind.  We also have more or less accepted that if a large area is
covered with a psi-shield, a teleport can not teleport inside, nor
can a clairvoyant see within the shield.  Telekinesis won\'t work
accross the barrier either etc.

Now for the odd part:
What about Clairvoyance.  As far as I know it works by a person
concentrating on an object or person, and then they will be able to
determine the location of what is sought.  Make sence?

What if a clairvoyant tries to spot the psi-shield?  Can a
clairvoyant \'see\' the shield, even if they can\'t see inside it?

If so, then having a psi-shield around your deep-site meson gun
won\'t help an awful lot.

Of course, as the Imps come up with psi counter measures, the Zhos
will come up with psi counter counter measures, and then psi
counter counter counter measures & psi counter counter counter
counter measures & psi counter counter counter counter counter...

About a month back I had this neat idea:

>>   Perhaps a UUP (Universal Universe Profile) might be in order!

and Wildstar had this to say...

>Hey, good idea!  A simple string of digits which summarize many of the
>important points of a universe.  How about something like the following
>
>Tone : Rating of the overall tone and character of the universe; low
>numbers mean dark, depressing, morbid; high numbers indicate light,
>upbeat, hopeful.
>Contrast : Rating of the definition between "good" and "evil"; low
>numbers indicate that such a conflict is not a fundamental part of the
>universe, with the contrast increasing up to the high numbers, where the
>conflict between a well defined good and evil is central to the universe
>(Star Wars is a good example of this in science fiction).
>Scale : Shows the "size" of events in which the players will typically
>be involved; low numbers indicate that the events are likely to be
>unimportant on a cosmic scale, and of interest to the participants and
>a few others.  High numbers indicate world-shattering, star-spanning
>plots with strong consequences for entire worlds and billions of people
>Input : This indicates how much influence the players are likely to have
>in the course of these events; low numbers indicate that the rebellion
>will go on no matter what the players can do.  High numbers represent a
>larger player influence on their universe.
>
>Technology: A group of three digits which represents the low, average
>and high end of the technology available in the universe.
>
>Parameters: A group of digits for plugging into equations in design
>dequences; represents the type and effectiveness of specifc technologies
>in the game universe.  Likeley candidates include Fusion, Gravitics,
>Jump Drive, Stutterwarp, Stargates, and as many others as seem
>reasonable.
>
>Examples: (in my humble opinion, using a 2-B scale):

>Classic Traveller: 9469-AFG-87600
>Rebellion Era:     58A3-AFG-67600
>Hard Times Era:    4878-9CE-67600
>Star Trek TNG:     A79A-???-A90B1
>Star Wars:         BABA-???-88A00

Well it looks like GDW might be going to run with a similar sort of idea!
(Yes GDW may actually be taking some notice of what goes on here!) If you
check the last page of Arrival Vengeance you will see the following in the
ad for TNE...

Each campaign will have its own universe profile which describes what
is possible there. Is anti-gravity technologically possible? What
is the most efficient means of intestellar travel in this universe?
Jump Drive? Stutterwarp? Stargates? Is matter transport possible?
When was artificial intelligence created? In the universe of the
imperium, stutterwarp is physically impossible, but jump drive and
anti-gravity are easily discovered principles.

(I hope GDW doesn\'t mind people quoting their ads...)

From this it looks as if they are only going to use the "parameter" type
digits, but more than the ones wildstar suggested (like matter transport
and AI).

So perhaps, to get discussion going on TML again, we might have a discussion
(argument, flame war) about what should be included in a UUP and how it
should tie in with the rest of the rules (ie. what does a "stutterwarp 6"
rating mean?).

An obvious candidate for another digit in the UUP is psionics (Traveller has
moderately powerful psionics, the Star Wars universe has powerful psionics
(the Force), a universe like 2300AD has none). Also FTL communications:
This has been a big no-no in Traveller & 2300AD, but is used in a lot of
science fiction - Star Trek being a prime example. (By FTL communications
I mean FTL communications which are faster than the speed of travel for
matter).

Any others people can think of?

As for what the digits actually mean, for the FTL digits the maximum distance
which can be travelled is perhaps the obvious choice, but there are other
possibilities, such as the maximum speed or an efficiency rating.

For AI, perhaps the digit might be the maximum intelligence an AI can reach
and still be stable (as I remember, human level AI\'s in 2300AD were possible
but tended to suicide after a few months). How about the length of time
that an AI remains stable as the meaning of the digit?

Psionics may be the maximum level in any psionic-type skill.

The Fusion/Gravitics numbers seem best used as inputs into vehicle design
process.

Any other suggestions?

but if decoy shields were substantially cheaper than deep sites, it might
not be too bad...

Of course, at the rate of fire of weapons in this game, engaging one real
site and two thousand decoy sites might not take very long.

I would like to make a couple of follow-up comments about the UUP idea.

First of all, I\'m glad GDW will do something of the sort with T:TNE; any sort
of multi-universe game needs something like this.  Personally, I felt that the
Tone, Contrast, Scale, and Input numbers are quite important.  Not everyone
likes the same kind of adventuring, and these allow you to quickly see if a
product fits in with the kind of game your players like to play.

The parameters were intended to go into equations in the vehicle and equipment
design sequences: exactly what each number means depends on what it is for.
As a rule of thumb, a 0 indicates that the technology is impossible (not
present in the universe at all).  Other numbers indicate greater or lesser
degrees of efficency; the larger the number, the more efficient or powerful
the effect.  Exactly how these numbers are interpreted would depend on the
rules contained in the design sequences for that technology.

Since none of these rules (currently) exist, then it is all rather
hypothetical.  But it would be nice to see such a scheme in place for T:TNE.


Speaking of Arrival Vengance, my local game store (Dream Wizards) does not
have it in stock yet (Dec 30th).  Tom Peters (who occasionally works there)
mentioned that he has yet to see the completed product, and he did the
cover art (!).  Tom also expressed a good bit of confidence in Dave Nilsen
and Traveller: The New Era.

I picked up an old issue of Byte magazine (before it sold out to
McGraw-Hill) from January 1979, and I\'d like to quote from an article,
entitled "History of Computers: The IBM 704":


  The IBM 704, announced in 1956, was almost the last vacuum tube
computer.  It was rendered obsolete by the 709 in 1959, which became the
7090 in less than a year.  The addition of the zero suffix to the model
number denoted the replacement of vacuum tubes by transistors and the
start of the second comptuer generation.  The 704 was very definitely a
first generation machine in the tradition of the giant brains of the
1940s and 1950s.  The central processing unit occupied a hige L-shaped
cabinet of about 120 cubic feet.  There was not enough room in the
cabinet for the 32k 36-bit words of core storage that occupied its own
box - another 100 cubic feet at least.  Today [1979] the computing power
cotained in those two steel, glass, and dark grey enamel cabinets can be
equaled by a desktop machine; in fact the latter would easily outstrip
the 704\'s 12 us instruction cycle.  Nevertheless, the 704 was the
ultimate computer of its time.

  ... On the other hand, support for the hardware was much in evidence.
A customer engineer spent eight hours a day on the premises, including
an hour long daily preventive maintenance session before the normal
first shift began.  The session included bringing up power, which took
15 minutes, and running diagnostics with voltages 20 percent above and
below normal in an effort to find weak vacuum tubes.  The effort was
usually successful.

  ... The 704\'s input and output (I/O) units consisted of a card reader,
card punch, line printer, ten magnetic tape units, two magnetic drum
units (each composed of four 2k-word drums) and a cathode ray tube ...


What intrigued me was the following question: What (in MegaTraveller
terms) is the Model 704?  You might want to think about the answer
before reading on.  Another interesting question to think about is: Can
the Virus take over a Model 704 (and make it sentient, etc...)?
Finally, you might want to compare a Model 704 to a computer you are
familiar with: do you have the equivalent handy today?

^L

A quick examination of the MegaTraveller Referee\'s manual shows that
computer technology begins at TL-5, and (ignoring /fib) goes like this:

TL-5 : Model-0, -0/bis, -1
TL-6 : Model-1/bis
TL-7 : Model-2
TL-8 : Model-2/bis
TL-9 : Model-3
TL-A : Model-4 (and so on up)

Quickly flipping back to the TL descriptions, we find that TL-5 is the
rough equivalent to c.1930, TL-6 is about c.1950, TL-7 is c.1970, and
TL-8 is c.1990.

A naive application of this rough description would place the IBM 704 in
the late 1950\'s, or firmly TL-6 (making it a Model-1/bis or
thereabouts).  Instead, I would argue that (since it is a vacuum-tube
machine) the IBM 704 should be classified as a Model-1.  The Model-0 and
- -0/bis would then be earlier and smaller vacuum-tube machines (all
first-generation computers, though, and of the same general technology
level).

To continue this line of thought, the Model-1/bis should be about the
largest and fastest computer produced with discrete-transistor
technology (presumably sometime in the mid to late 1960\'s), while the
Model-2 is probably the equivalent of an early supercomputer (early
1980\'s: perhaps a Cray-1), and a Model-2/bis should be represented with
the most powerful supercomputers on the drawing boards today.

So, the IBM 704 can run a respectable commercial starship.  Can the
virus take one over?  I (personally) should think not: after all, the
Model 704 is a very limited machine: a floppy-based, 128k-RAM IBM PC is
more than the equal of the 704.

Comments, anyone?

I think that giving the IBM 704 as a Model 1 is overstating its
power. Firstly I think that the technology scale would be: TL 5 =
Vacuum Tubes (note the x100 volume mod for TL 5 on the computer
table), TL 6 = Transistors, TL 7+ = Silicon Chips. (Could someone with
the Ref\'s Companion check this?) This means that the 704 is using TL 5
technology and should get the x 100 volume mod.

The total volume given for the 704 in the article was 220 cu ft which
is approximately 8 cubic metres (= 8 kilolitres). A model 0 would take
up 0.5 x 100 = 50 kilolitres, so I think that the 704 is considerably
less powerful than even a model 0...

Even if you consider vacuum tubes to be TL 6, then a model 1 takes up
20 kilolitres, and a model 0 takes up 5 kilolitres, so it would be
closer to a model 0 (perhaps a model 0/bis?)

OK, so if that\'s the power of a 704, what would a model 0 be in
today\'s terms (assuming the first case for volume)...

Mutliplying the memory capacity by 5, we get 160, 36 bit words = 5760
bits = 720 K. IUm not sure how CPU complexity would be affected, but I
think that a model 0 on these lines would be approximately equivalent
to a 640K IBM PC, say based on an 8088? Or maybe an old 512K or 1 MB
Mac.

Does this seem reasonable?

covering deep meson gun sites.  I now offer my opinion.

In my games, nobody would ever put a psi shield on a deep meson gun (unless
they were ignorant of basic psionic theory, which seems reasonably possible
in the Imperial core, but not behind the claw).  See, a clairvoyant trying to
locate a deep meson gun site has to *search* for it.  That means sweeping the
entire crustal volume of the planet for hidden meson guns.  A psi-shield
would stick out like a sore thumb, making it easier for the devil Zhos to
find the site.  Although an unshielded site is vulnerable to attack by
teleportation, experience has shown that only colossal luck (or good
intelligence work) will give a Zhodani clairvoyant the location of the
defense guns.

It\'s not just a matter of "thinking about the location" unless you already
know the location, in which case why bother with psi when you can go ahead
and meson-blast the s*** out of it?

Gluek Automation Gunslinger Gunnery Robot TL12

     The Gunslinger is designed around a Gluek 12-11 robotic brain, and
provides a low cost gunnery capbility to a starship operator.  It is avail-
able with its program specialized for either lasers or missiles.
     The Gunslinger is an immobile box which is plugged into the appropriate
gunnery position on board a starship, usually in a location which would only
be accessible to members of the crew.  This makes it more difficult for a
hostile group aboard the vessel to disable the guns, which would be desirable
during a hijacking attempt, for example.  Communication with the bridge crew
is via the ship\'s computer network, and the robot uses the ship\'s sensors
(via the network) to engage targets designated by the bridge crew.

Red Star Class Free Trader (Type A) TL14

     The Red Star class is designed to meet minimal Type A standards.  Many
cost saving measures are included in the design, such as the use of a minimum
size fuel purification plant, an enhanced Model 0 computer, and provision for
carrying only 18 days worth of full power operating fuel for the power plant,
which allows additional cargo to carried.  No turrets are mounted on the ship
as built, but space has been reserved for later installation. Additional
controls would be required if weapons were installed.
     Most examples of the Red Star class were built in the Imperial core, and
survivors during the Rebellion Era are likely to have been extensively modi-
fied.

Red Star Class Freighter (Modified Type A) TL14

     The Red Star class freighter is a variant of the Red Star free trader
design. The cost saving measures included in the original design, such as the
use of a minimum size fuel purification plant, an enhanced Model 0 computer,
and provision for carrying only 18 days worth of full power operating fuel
for the power plant, are carried over into the freighter variant. In addi-
tion, all accommodations beyond the bare minimum required for the basic two
man crew have been removed, increasing the cargo capacity by 702kl.  No
turrets are mounted on the ship as built, but space has been reserved for
later installation. Additional controls would be required if weapons were in-
stalled.

We\'ve had two newcomers ask about the wisdom of investing in MegaTraveller
products in the past week.  As a result of this, I\'ve been thinking that
we might want to put together two lists: One of MT product reviews, and one
of classic Traveller products that should be sought by new MT players.

The second category would certainly include things like Book 8: Robots, whose
rules have not yet been translated to MT (and probably will _never_ be),
The Traveller Adventure, and most of the Alien books.  What else would anyone
recommend as a \'must-have\'?

Commands to the DS-1 must be rather specific as the unit has a very
limited intelligence.  The unit is usually under the supervision of
a household computer.

DS-1 units are often available on a rental basis and will be able
to move rapidly about cities under their own power.  However, when
left on their own they have a tendancy to cause traffic jams.  They
get confused by "Don\'t Walk" signs and will stop in the middle of
the road.

Why did the DS-1 cross the road?

The Adrian model Newsreader is only pseudo-biological in appearance

I think that giving the IBM 704 as a Model 1 is overstating its
power. Firstly I think that the technology scale would be: TL 5 =
Vacuum Tubes (note the x100 volume mod for TL 5 on the computer
table), TL 6 = Transistors, TL 7+ = Silicon Chips. (Could someone with
the Ref\'s Companion check this?) This means that the 704 is using TL 5
technology and should get the x 100 volume mod.

The total volume given for the 704 in the article was 220 cu ft which
is approximately 8 cubic metres (= 8 kilolitres). A model 0 would take
up 0.5 x 100 = 50 kilolitres, so I think that the 704 is considerably
less powerful than even a model 0...

Even if you consider vacuum tubes to be TL 6, then a model 1 takes up
20 kilolitres, and a model 0 takes up 5 kilolitres, so it would be
closer to a model 0 (perhaps a model 0/bis?)

OK, so if that\'s the power of a 704, what would a model 0 be in
today\'s terms (assuming the first case for volume)...

Mutliplying the memory capacity by 5, we get 160, 36 bit words = 5760
bits = 720 K. IUm not sure how CPU complexity would be affected, but I
think that a model 0 on these lines would be approximately equivalent
to a 640K IBM PC, say based on an 8088? Or maybe an old 512K or 1 MB
Mac.

Does this seem reasonable?

See ya \'round.

In my games, nobody would ever put a psi shield on a deep meson gun (unless
they were ignorant of basic psionic theory, which seems reasonably possible
in the Imperial core, but not behind the claw).  See, a clairvoyant trying to
locate a deep meson gun site has to *search* for it.  That means sweeping the
entire crustal volume of the planet for hidden meson guns.  A psi-shield
would stick out like a sore thumb, making it easier for the devil Zhos to
find the site.  Although an unshielded site is vulnerable to attack by
teleportation, experience has shown that only colossal luck (or good
intelligence work) will give a Zhodani clairvoyant the location of the
defense guns.

It\'s not just a matter of "thinking about the location" unless you already
know the location, in which case why bother with psi when you can go ahead
and meson-blast the s*** out of it?

A couple of interestng (and perhaps non-obvious) things follow from my
analysis
of the shipbuilding capacity of the Imperium.  The most important is that
the volume of shipping is *INVERSELY* dependent on the size of the ships used
to carry it.  This is because larger ships require more of a shipyard\'s
capacity, in addition to taking longer to construct!  When I calculated my
shipping volume, I assumed an "average" mix of ships, taking the same amount
of starship resources as one 10,000 ton vessel, and yeilding 1 ship per
million ton-weeks of shipbuilding capacity, with an average displacement of
6,250 tons per vessel (and presumably about 3,125 tons of cargo capacity).
Recomputing with 200-ton traders would result in over 3.3 times the total
volume of shipping (and presumably a similar increase in cargo capacity).

The Trillion Credit Squadron rules I used were probably never meant to apply
to civillian, merchant shipbuilding capacity; I used them because they were
the only ones available.  Better rules should include multipliers to the
capacity based on Tech Level and trade categories, as well as for Population
and Government Type.  Similarly, the trade through a port should be dependent
on the world\'s population, government type, law level, tech level, and trade 
categories, and astrographic location, as well as its starport type.

Nevertheless, let us proceed boldly into the fray.  I computed an "average"
Class A port as handling 27.3 million tons of shipping in a week.  This would
include all imports, exports, and trans-shipments.  Halving this number gives
an estimate of the total *CARGO* volume (remember, I was using the total
volume
of the ships involved): 13.65 million tons a week.  For simplicity\'s sake,
I will assume that 50% of this is imports, with the balance being exports and
trans-shipments; this gives us a final figure of 6.8 million tons of imports
per week.  For comparison, US imports of 31.5 million tons works out to about
0.6 million tons per week (I\'ve been working in Displacement Tons all along).

If the US is taken to be an "average" Class A world, the Traveller shipyards
can maintain this level of trade (in terms of constructing and maintaining
the starships) even if the ships are as large as an average of 50,000 tons.
However, if the US is taken to be an "average" TL-7/8 world (and therefore
much more probably a Class B or even Class C port), then the major Imperial
worlds (with tech levels in the 14 to 15 range, and Class A starports) could
be
doing 10 to 20 *TIMES* the trade of the US.

While these volumes of trade are not enough to supply a world with the
staples
of life, it is more than enough to make a massive difference in the tech
level
and quality of life (excercise: look around and mentally "remove" everything
that has been imported from overseas; remember that some components that you
take for granted may be imported - like the DRAM in your computer).

Major gaming effects:
  o Worlds (small outposts and stations excepted) is probably self-sufficent
    in terms of staples (air, water, basic foods, fuel) although the
production
    or distribution of these may involve imported equipment or skills.
  o A majority of the available consumer goods are likely to be imported (or
    produced primarily for the export market, depending on whether the world
    is primarily an importer, like the US, or an exporter, like Japan).
  o A busy port will have many hundreds, up to thousands, of ships operating
    around it; probably at a large number of separate facilities (the World
    Builder\'s Handbook provides quite nicely for this).  A port is likely to
    be as busy as a major US airport, with vessels arriving and departing
    every two to fifteen minutes.
  o Even the sleepiest of ports will have a flow of traffic; anywhere from a
    ship a day to one every couple of weeks.

Rebellion effects:
  o Destruction of shipbuilding capacity has a long-term effect; if the yard
    is not rebuilt, the effect becomes cumulative as worn-out ships are not
    replaced.  The average starship will become older and less reliable, as
    ships are kept in service due to a lack of replacements.
  o Destruction of ships has an immediate effect; even if all shipyards are
    left intact, because of the long time needed to construct any ship.
    Replacements are likely to be smaller ships, because they can be built
    faster, and with fewer shipyard resources.

Incidentally, would anybody care to calculate the economics of _ihatei_
fleets? How big a percentage of _ihatei_ can each aslan generation afford
to send off? How many ships would the Domain need to beat off a century\'s
accumulated _ihatei_, assuming that every single one went across the Great
Rift instead of some of them going rimwards? How many would they need,
if they can play off one clan against another? How many ships would they have
in their rimward subsectors even if they sent all the regular ships coreward
to deal with the vargr and just left the subsector forces?
I\'d be interested to compare your findings to mine.

A while ago, there was a small discussion of the life support costs of living
on a starship.  Specifically the 2000 Cr per person per jump (Jump being
about 2 weeks approx because I assume they are including time for in system
manuvering.)  So that comes out to 1000 Cr per week per person in life
support
costs.

Ok, what does it pay for?  Good question.  Well, according to the Ref\'s
manual the cost/power/weight/volume of lights, heat, air, cooking, waste
recycling etc. does not change from TL 5 all the way to TL 21.  If so then
the technology used must be similar to that currently used.

Ok, that means you are going to need carbon dioxide filters, dust filters
and such that are going to have to be replaced on a regular basis.  Also
Emergency life support equipment is going to have to be serviced from time
to time, not to mention perisable medical supplies which will need to be
purchased if used or not.  (perhaps a wily starship crew could resell these
to dirtside hospitals before the expiration date was completely up to help
cut costs?)

Food?  Well it isn\'t that expensive, I have seen figures published saying
good food was about 200 Cr per week (I\'ll have to check that)
I also remember there was a bit in the Traveller Adventure on the cost of
breathing air.  (Aramis has an air tax I believe)  I think it was 150 Cr
per week (Of course that includes the cost of beaurocracies)

Still, I these are small costs overall.  What I think would soak up the most
cash would be the cost of various equipment maintainance.  Most aircraft
undergo maintainance inspections every 100 hrs of flight and a major
inspection
every 1000 hrs (Sorry I\'m only a student pilot not an aircraft owner)
Starships on the other hand have their overhauls every year.  A year of
operation is a LONG time.  I\'d guess that the 1000 cr per week goes mostly
toward routine equipment replacement and spares.

Speaking of air replenishing systems, I read a while ago on sci.military
about
\'Oxygen Candles\' which are an emergency air system on submarines.  Basically
it is a \'candle\' (quite large: 30cm diameter by 50cm high) which \'burns\'
releasing oxygen and heat as it does so.
 I imagine it as a kind of oxydizer rich solid rocket fuel.  Not that it
produces any thrust, but that it is a material which holds the oxygen
chemically, and releases it upon being heated.  The oxygen burns the
\'candle\',
heating it, releasing more oxygen.

I would assume these are carried aboard ships for emergency use.  Now, it has
been pointed out that there are existing worlds in the spinward marches which
would be \'failing\' before the trouble started.  Say a Vaccum world with too
low technology.  Explain it?  Well, how about an naturally occuring mineral
deposit similar to these \'oxygen candles\'?  It would be a local material that
would find a ready market!

    'body' => 'The recent mention in S&A of the long-range Solomani explorations into the
Perseus Galactic Arm got me to thinking about where some real interstellar
structures should be in the Traveller universe.  Five Imperial sectors are
named after real stars, after all (Spica, Fornast, Alpha CRU, Deneb, and 
Antares).  Ever wonder what the sky might look like from, say, Vland? 
Regina?  Using an old copy of _Norton\'s Star Atlas_, I went on a trip to
Vland.  (Of course, in terms of the Traveller chronology, this is like
using an Egyptian chart from 1800 B.C., but oh well.)

Vland is fortunate enough to have two very bright stars in its sky.  Located
about seventy parsecs away from Vland is the M1Ib red supergiant the Vilani
call Mika, known to Terrans as Antares.  Seen from Vland, Antares has an
apparent magnitude of about -0.5, which if it were that bright in the Terran
sky, would make it their third brightest star.  More impressive still is
Deneb, only 65 parsecs away.  Deneb shines at the incredible apparent
magnitude of -3.1, four and a half times brighter than Terra\'s brightest
star.  Tourists from Mora won\'t be impressed.  From Mora (21 pcs.), Deneb
has an apparent magnitude of -5.6, two times brighter than *Venus* from
Earth, and probably visible far into daylight hours!

Unless you brought your PRIS binoculars, don\'t plan to find Terra from
Vland.  Sirius, the brightest star in Terra\'s sky, shines at a apparent
mag. of +7.8.  Think "Neptune".  Sol, at a range of 200 parsecs, is an
eleventh magnitude star.  Usually, people can only see down to the sixth
magnitude or so with the naked eye.

- ----

In WBH, they say that supergiants should be rare.  They are!  I have
only found three others beyond Deneb and Antares so far. The three:
  Eakhoi    (2123 Dark Nebula)  F8 Ia
  Sardas    (0839 Mendan)       F0 Ib  M7 D
  ??????    (1530 Empty Qtr.)   M4 Ia  M4 D
Rare enough?  This is in the whole region of the Imperial Atlas!
Of course, whether these stars are real or which they are is another
question altogether....

I also have a request for the "old-style" Traveller players out there.
Remember that old map of Charted Space with the star field background?
Traveller Deluxe and "Library Data A-M" had copies of it.  I don\'t have
a copy myself, but I remember that it showed some bright star names on
it, as well as a few nebulae.  It would be interesting to know where
(what sector, roughly what part) some of these nebulae were placed.
For instance, do we know what Dark Nebula the sector of that name is
named after, according to Traveller?  I\'m putting together a list of
stars/systems that I\'ve seen referred to in sector library data, and will
post it if anybody is interested.

Incidentally, I haven\'t been able to find Spica, Alpha Crucis, or Fornast
yet (although I haven\'t looked for Fornast much), so if anyone has a hex
coordinate for them, I\'d appreciate it.  For owners of "Solomani Rim":
what subsector of Alpha Crucis was named "Denebola"?  Any help with this
would be appreciated!

>Skill Levels and their meanings (In my book)
>(Using Ground Car as an example)
>Ground Car-0 (Know how to drive, fill the tank, when to get routine
  maintainance, knows when car is malfunctioning.)
>Ground Car-1 Can Drive in bad weather, diagnose of minor faults, can
  perform minor maintainance: change oil & filters
>Ground Car-2 Can Drive in bad weather at speed.  Perform most maintainance
>Ground Car-3 Professional Racer.  Can overhaul engine & transmission.
>Ground Car-4 A.J. Foyt
>Ground Car-5 Speed Racer
>Ground Car-6 Racer-X

 You remember Speed Racer, too?... ;-)

>(Using Hand gun)
>Hand Gun-0 Can point the gun and shoot it.  Knows how to reload
>Hand Gun-1 Can strip and reassemble it under battle field conditions
>Hand Gun-2 Can strip weapon & reassemble blind folded
>Hand Gun-3 Competition level marksman
>Hand Gun-4 Olympic level marksman
>(Please note, I am Ground Car-1, and Hand Gun-0.)

 Same skills with me, though I probaly would have something like a
Knowledge(firearms/20th century)-2 or 3... 
 These skill levels seem okay. I generally have considered 
level-5 the \'master\' skill level; For example, Han Solo had a piloting of
at least 5, and Scotty had an engineering of at least 5. Two character\'s
in my campaigns have managed this level (both scouts), one in piloting
and the other in electronics.
