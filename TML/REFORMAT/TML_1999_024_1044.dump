The dampers are stated to work by manipulating the weak nuclear force.
Said force turns out to be involved in fission *and* fusion. So while
it may take a different "setting", there\'s no reason they *can\'t*
affect a fusion reaction, and lots of reasons to think they can.

> I still hold that the intention of the dampers was
> that they\'d damp fission.

Nope. They are *specificly* describes as being able to speed or or slow
down fission. And I\'m pretty sure that fusion is mentioned also.

BTW, when used against missiles, it\'s virtually certain that the damper
is used to *accelerate* decay, so that the sub-critical masses in the
warhead will melt and ruin the warhead before it gets close enough to
hurt you. 

Slowing down down the reaction would only be useful if you caught the
warhead at the exact millisecond that the explosive charges compress
the fissionables past critical mass. Hit it outside that window and the
warhead can still go off as soon as the beam moves to another target. 

It\'s been specifically noted that "cleaning up" after a nuke blast on a
planet surface involves making the radioactive material decay faster.
This makes the contaminated area much more lethal (and hotter in the
*thermal* sense) whgile you are doing this. But in a relatively short
time, there\'s no more shortlived isotopes in the area, and long-lived
isotopes give off negligible amounts of radiation unless *extremely*
concentrated.

As stated above, this *wasn\'t* a sale. It was the return of a piece
from a factory repair. As far as I know, the rule you mention is only
for *sale* of a firearm.

I want to disagree with you here. During war, more or less every weapon
that is effective to use will be used. Kyle pointed out the atrocities
commited by the *allies* during WWII as an example. Especially the
bombings of Dresden were interesting, as it was not a military target.
On the contrary, many German civilians had gone there to avoid being
bombed. The bombing was done at that spot in order to ruin the German
morale quickly...

Hehe... if we (stupid humans) learned from history, that is, we would
have come to the same conclusion. I do not have the exact wording for
this quote, but one of the Wright brothers said (about the flying
machine) that this machine will make further wars impossible, since the
potential for destruction is so great.

Sadly enough, it had been said before. A pope (don\'t know which, have to
find my quotations collection) once said (not an exact quote either)
about a new weapon that it was too accurate, silent, quick, and deadly
to allow for any more wars. That weapon was the crossbow...

ObTrav: Seeing things in this light, I find it rather improbable that
nukes aren\'t used by most cultures in Traveller. IMTU, the Imperium (and
thus their client states) have laws forbidding them, but many other
cultures use them. The below notes are further information about nuclear
weapons IMTU.

The Vargr haven\'t got the knowledge, and the Zhodani won\'t give it to
them (the Zho\'s have got the Bomb, but they are afraid of an escalating
war). The Darrians have no problems whatsoever with using nukes if they
need to, and they have bombed several of the Sword Worlds. The Sword
Worlder\'s have done the same to the Darrians... This is exactly the type
of conflict (with the Imperium) that the Zhodani are afraid of.

The K\'Kree gladly nuke "bad" worlds, but won\'t destroy inhabitable (to
them) worlds that way. Aslan follow the Imperial way of thinking, but
some clans just *might* have an ace or two up their sleeve.

I haven\'t considered Droyne or Hiver\'s, since I don\'t have any material
on these races yet (I\'m waiting for GT: Alien Races 3).

I agree to the fact (?) that the K\'Kree play as dirty as they can
afford. They simply have no compassion at all for their evil,
meat-eating opponents. They will be even worse to their enemies than the
Nazis (yes, possible, but damn hard) were to the Jews...

It\'s a good thing for the rest of Known Space that the K\'Kree don\'t have
a tech advantage over everyone else...

I would love to see you standing before a K\'Kree and saying that bit
about "size disadvantage" though...   ;-)

Like attacking without warning, something the humans (especially the
dirty Solomani) gladly do. The Aslan (at least clans that have had
conflict with too many humans) probably assume that a human might play
dirty at any time, no matter what the little fur-less thing says. They
won\'t drop the rules until the humans do, however. But I wouldn\'t want
to be a human marine when the Aslan get really mad...

Too late, I already have Couerls, Ixtls and Riims in my game..:)  However I
disagree about them being too tough to take out; remember in the book that
human \'ingenuity\' was what prevailed.  After reading some of the clever
things PCs have done in games posted here, I wouldn\'t throw in the towel on
them just yet.  :)

I suspect a lot of this has to do with frequency. How many of us use a
private courier company to send a letter or postcard?

My own experiences indicate that Canada Post has a far better record than
UPS. Out of thousands of letters I\'ve sent/received, less than a dozen have
been lost or significantly delayed.  OTOH, UPS has managed to lose one
parcel entirely (no record of it in their system at all), help another "in
transit" for a week (on an overnight delivery), and forced me drive 1.5
hours to their depot to pick up another only to discover that they had left
it with a neighbour (whom I didn\'t know) who had just gone on holiday!  One
parcel was delivered on time.

Canada Post: 99.9% success.

UPS: 25% success.

Well, I haven\'t needed this one yet, but I figured that the ceremony would
take place either with both parties in attendance, or with one party and a
herald (who would then convey the news to the other, and return to the
first to inform them that they were free of obligation).

That\'s what the herald\'s for.

That\'s for the TML-PBEM.  As of a year and a half ago (last time I heard from 
anybody who was involved concerning it), they weren\'t accepting any new 
players.  Doesn\'t look like they\'ve posted anything in a year & a half either.

Interesting ideas in the archives, though.  Can\'t quite figger out *what* the

The Ancient-transplanted Syleans were overthrown by gothic Ziru Sirka/Rule

captured the hearts and minds of the surviving population using battle pod
equipped infantry. All while wearing sensible shoes. Amen.

I\'ll admit your logic is sound here, but that\'s why earlier on in the thread
on this top I qualified the concept by including variations on the theme.
I\'ve never assumed that one has to *literally* drop big rocks. Any number of
"big dumb objects" will suffice.

>You need *enormous* (and expensive!) drives to shift rocks.


Fair enough.

With Traveller starship technology there\'s nothing special about mass
drivers; using the ship\'s own engine for "deadfall" ordinance makes much
more sense for bombarding city-sized targets, and smaller targets need
guided ordinance, which might as well have its own engine.
(A typical Traveller missile has ~200 km/s of delta-V, much higher than
you could ever get out of a mass driver; and of course a starship can provide
several km/s with a few minutes burn of its engines before dropping the
rocks.)

The high performance of Traveller engines somewhat negates the advantages
of being in orbit - you can get that same 200 km/s (or something close to it)
with a missile launched from the ground on a suitable trajectory, though
of course that\'s easier to shoot down. Only in societies with chemical rockets
does the energy advantage of being in orbit (10 km/s) make a significant
difference. The positional advantage does remain (it\'s easier to protect
your own troops from orbit.)

It almost goes without saying that the Imperium can hold the high ground
when it wants to, at least when it\'s dealing with internal problems. *Now* I
can see why nobody leaves the Imperium under their own will. ;)

Still, it would also seem that the first thing a country wishing to rebel
*must* do if its rebellion is to have any chance of succeeding is to manage
to create one, but preferably more, deep meson cannon sites. Of course, this
will frequently have to be done in secret.

It\'s not so much for nailing the big rocks but for making such a scenario as
expensive as possible for the Imperium.

I\'m sorry if I misconstrued your argument. I thought you were refering

to bombing the planet back to the stoneage. And yet the Narn didn\'t

And can\'t support their own people who begin to think maybe being a part of

I supose it\'s posible if everybody on the planet is mortally opposed to
imperial rule this might have to be done but I don\'t see any planet with a
pop
greater than 2 where this could posibly be the case. And with populations
that low
any old machinegun is a weapon of mass destruction. Ie in that case "wipe em
out
who\'s gonna notice." In all other situations enough people will be found who
are willing to accept Imperial rule to keep things going on a more or less

I supose. But just how determined is the populace? If the Impies come
in with a batron and a few regiments of marines, bribes in the right places,
and some cosmetic reforms (say renaming the taxes negative income
enhancements or some such) would the peasants still revolt?
In most cases I doubt it.

Yes I was being inelequent. Some other reasons countries go to war
are: "Glorious Leaders" huge ego needs a stroke, religious disputes (These
wars
are among the dirtiest wars), to avoid being anexed by another country.
(Yes it actually does take two countries to fight a war)

And no doubt many other reasons/justifications. Wars still boil down to a

In general in a land war you only shoot at things that are in your imediate

everybody it lands on whether their fighting back or not. Killing people
who aren\'t otherwise involved usually results in fence sitters joining the

Dresden was more or less irellevent to the outcome of the war. In fact the
only
big contribution to the outcome of the war that strategic bombing made was
in
the interdiction of the Ploesti oilfields. Pity it took the army air corps
as long as
it did to concentarte on them.

Japan was already beaten in every sense except the actuall occupation by the
time
the bombs were dropped. The japanese knew this and were attempting to
negotiate surender terms at the time. The bomb merely pointed out that we
were
willing to kill all of them in order to get unconditional surrender.

In both cases large occupying armies were required to control the conquered
teritories and we wound up spending a large sum of money rebuilding their
destroyed infrastructure. If both of the previous were not true we would
probably
have had another world war sometime in the sixties.

Well, if they\'re stupid enough to shoot themselves in the head like that,
all you do is interdict them. No problem. If they want to isolate
themselves, and live as poor dirt farmers, the Imperium isn\'t going to
stop \'em. Any offworld holdings they have will be attached to satisfy
external claims. But they\'re not getting off their world and going
anywhere. 

Hell, if offworld money isn\'t involved, the Imperium doesn\'t
_care_ whether they live in caves starving to death, or large
industrialized megalopolises...once they all starve, someone willing to be
part of the Imperium will come in and rebuild, if there\'s anything of
value there.

The Imperium doesn\'t give a flying fig about what it is that people do on
their own planets. They control \'the space between the stars\'. If you\'re
harboring p*rates, expect those facilities to get bombed. 

If your leaders are plotting treason, they\'ll get whacked. If the
everybody on the planet says: "We don\'t wanna play Imperium anymore!
We\'re quitting!", the Imperium says, \'Fine\', and starts charging an
Imperial duty on all goods flowing to and from the planet in question.
That will probably far more than make up for any losses in taxes.

Also, if some, ohhh, say nearby polity or Megacorp wishes to reintegrate
the planet in question back into the Imperium...who\'s gonna stop \'em? The
planet\'s on their own.

Which said taxes are actually quite low, and _probably_ paid by taxing
traffic through the starports, not directly taxing the inhabitants of the
planet. I think we figured out one time that the average Imperial resident
pays something like, what, less than ten Cr. a year in Imperial taxes? At
the population level of the Imperium that\'s quite a few teracredits...
 
The Imperium isn\'t going to even threaten rock-tossing over mere taxes...

Finally, in the end, since the Imperial model of growth was to co-opt the
local leaders into the Imperial nobility, there are very few places that
have any incentive at all to quit the club.

If your imperium is a Star Wars type evil empire, then they\'ll do this
sort of thing, but as I see it, the Imperium is more like the Empire in
the Flandry stories, a distant thing that asks everyone for a few pennies
a year and that\'s about the extent of the Imperium\'s impact on the average
sophont. Who the dog catcher is in this years election cycle is far more
important.

Ah, now it\'s all so clear to me. Perhaps this is the way that the Imperium
might play it in some other game, but remember... this is *Traveller* and
the Imperium is willing to step in when two powers wage war to the point
that their industrial capacity is threatened. Remember, this is the Imperium
that waged the Pacification Campaigns when there were significant cultural
regions who resisted integration into the Imperium.

Really? One wonders if this extends to worlds like those within a few
parsecs of Capital. How about those worlds with some degree of political
importance or symbolic importance, like... Terra?

Does anybody *really* believe that the Imperium really controls "the space
between the stars"? They may buy that line in the Imperium universe, but I
must say you\'re insulting my intelligence if you expect me to buy it in real
life.

This is the same Imperium that expanded by touching off surface wars on
worlds that it wished to integrate. This is the same Imperium that waged the
Pacification campaigns. This is the same Imperium that steps in when a
worlds\' industrial capacity is threatened by warfare.

>If your leaders are plotting treason, they\'ll get whacked.

Strange behavior for an Imperium which "doesn\'t give a flying fig" about
what folks do on their own worlds.

Ah, so the Imperium *is* interested in taxing worlds by whatever means is
necessary in the situation.

Oh, but wait, doesn\'t the Imperium have laws against multiworld polities?
There\'s a bit of sarcasm in my voice there. It\'s difficult to disentangle
what the Imperium really does from what their "spin machine" says they do.

But wait, didn\'t you just say that taxing traffic through the starports is a
"last resort" when a world\'s not willing to cooperate? Still, I thought that
there was a different figure in trillion credit squadron. I could be wrong
though, as I don\'t have it nearby.

>The Imperium isn\'t going to even threaten rock-tossing over mere taxes...


Yet taxes, are in the end, all they\'re really interested in... even though
they\'ve been fully willing to do other nasty things in integrating worlds
that don\'t want to cooperate.

Huh? Surely this is a IYTU scenario. There is no evidence that this is the
case as individual worlds have *many* different styles of government that
are at odds with Imperial quasi-feudalism.

On the contrary, I do not think that the Imperium is "evil" nor do I think
that it\'s "distant". It\'s utterly obvious that the Imperium has a real stake
in keeping worlds under its control. After all, if the hands-off policy you
mention were to be in effect, there\'s no reason not to leave the Imperium.
What? The Imperium is completely willing to give our world complete self
determination? Sure, the Imperium doesn\'t have to worry about its core
worlds splitting, because their mineral resources have likely been depleted
after long millenia... but that\'s also exactly the reason why not letting
worlds leave is so damn important.

Happy to help. Of course, having a free source of scenarios and rules

Roger bought DGP off Joe Fugate (IIRC) who did a lot of the work for 
GDWs\' MT publications in addition to the DGP material. This happened 
after DGP withdrew from the Traveller market when TNE was published.

At this present moment, several list members are owed money by DGP 
for material printed and sold years ago. Roger has started many 
projects for RPGs since he bought DGP, none of which have come to 
fruition.

His dispute with MM relates to the ownership of the DGP material. 
Although RS owns the copyright of the text for the DGP material he 
cannot publish without MM\'s permission. RS wants a lot of money for 
the DGP material. As a result, it is legally dubious to use DGP 
material as a basis for current Traveller material and both T4 and GT 
avoided reusing it by working around it. As a result, some of the 
best Traveller material is being overwritten and is condemned to 
being rare collector\'s items.

Other people who were on the list earlier than me may have a better 
description, as mine is not first hand, only the story as I have been 
told.

Another reason for the bombing of Dresden was retaliation for the

This sounds good to me, provided it can be swiched off, overridden, or tweaked.

Nice, but not essential. But, if you\'re going to do an econ analysis in it,
make certain you allow for either base GT Book separately from GT:FT,
asthey will have much different break-even points.

Doubtful, since each sector has a government and a fleet (CT: HG), as does

Actually, this is canon. I\'ll have to do a bit of digging, but I\'ve read
this in at least one or two sources.

>>There\'s a bit of sarcasm in my voice there.
>
>Oh, Really?


Just wanted to make sure that there were no misunderstandings. After all,
while I\'m working the assumption that the Imperium doesn\'t allow multi-world
polities, it\'s apparent that there are multi-world polities within the
Imperium.

That may be so, but what is one to make from the distinct disconnect in
canon? It\'s easy to fallback on canon and say that the Imperium rules the
space between the worlds. On the other hand, that\'s denying other elements
of canon which point to the idea that the Imperium does quite a bit of
meddling in the affairs of its member worlds.

Problem is, the rock will get the course mod *way* outside the range of
an meson site. Say 1 or 2 AU. That\'s 150 to 300 *million* km. The
imperials can stay out around the 100 diameter limit and pick off
anybody jumping insystem. And they\'d be fairly hard to hit (actually,
I\'m not sure they *can* be hit at that range from an "average" sized
world).

Yes, but you have to remember two things. First, the Centauri had to
limit the bombing *somewhat* because they wanted resources on the
planet. Destroying those would have made the whole excercise pointless.

Second, that\'s fiction. What reaction intelligent being would have to

True enough. It\'s  just that *relying* on your players being clever

Whoa!

You appear to be suffering from a common misconception. It\'s not
*possible* to keep things like nukes "secret" if they *ever* get used,
and it\'s fairly unlikely even if they *don\'t* get used. 

The scientific method ensures that if you ask the universe a question,
you get a truthful answer. So, once you *know* something can be done, a
research program *will* find out *how* it can be done. Period.

The *only* reason the Germans didn\'t get the bomb was that (depending
on who you believe) either a research dropped a couple of decimal
points when calculating critical mass from the results of an early
experiment, or he *deliberately* fudged the result. Either way, they
wound up thinking that it\'d take *tons* of material to go critical. So
they figured a bomb was impossible. Anybody who *knows* bombs are
possible would take one look at that result and recheck the figures and
find the mistake.

Please note that of the more than a dozen countries with nuclear
capability, the evidence points to every single one of them succeeding
in getting a working bomb on the *first* try. 

Nukes are incredibly simple, and anybody that knows the physics behind
a fusion reaction can figure out that a fission reaction is possible,
and enough of the parameters to start research on building a reactor or
a bomb. And given a reasonable amount of time and resources, they\'ll
*succeed*. It only takes massive resources if you are in a hurry. 

So anybody over TL 5 or 6 (too lazy to check the books :-) can build a
nuke. It\'s no more "restricted" a technology than gunpowder and other
explosives. 

In fact, nukes are likely seen as merely a bigger bang, with some
unfortunate side effects. They may actually get used (along with damper
tech "clean-up") in some large civil engineering projects. 

I expect that the "no nukes" rule in warfare is actually no "weapons of
mass destruction". No taking out cities just because there was an
observation post in it.

You\'d tear the ship apart long before you got near c. Remember, running
a mass around in a circle requires that you exert a force to push it
towards the center, so it\'ll stay in the circular path. And that means
that the frame of the ship needs to exert a counterforce to keep the
cyclotron from flying apart (an inward push on the mass results in an
*outward* push on the cyclotron).

You get *exactly* the same stresses you\'d get if you had the mass on
the end of a long arm and tried to spin it around at some fraction of
c. 

Cyclotrons work because the particles they are accelerating have so
little mass. try accelerating a 1 kg mass to the same sort of speed and
the side forces get unreal.

the game to new players, I generally give lurkers preference.  I
suspect if you asked, most of the GM\'s would be willing to except
lurkers.

No, a meson cannon couldn\'t stop the rock from being put on an
intercept course.  It wouldn\'t have the range.  I got to thinking,
though, about another idea.

Would it be possible to use the meson cannon to deflect the rock?
You aren\'t going to have many shots because of the closing velocity,
but it doesn\'t have to be moving all that fast to be deadly, so it
*might* be possible to hit a rock a few times between the time it
comes into range and it hits the world\'s surface.  

You don\'t want to break it up so aiming would be critical.  What you
would want to do is decay the mesons just under the surface of the
big rock causing an explosion that changes it\'s vector.  All you
have to do is deflect it a little and it hits at an angle and skips
off.  I suspect even near misses would be quite unpleasant for a
world\'s ecology, but infinitely better than a direct hit.

None of the canon sources I have identify the Syleans as a minor human
race. You mention T4, and I will freely admit that I have absolutely zero
T4 materials. I do, however, have lots of CT, MT, TNE, and GT materials,
none of which identify the Syleans as a minor race.

This is not to say that the Sylean\'s couldn\'t be one, as not all of the
40-odd minor races have been identified in the canon sources. This being
the case, whether the Syleans are a minor race or just decended from Ziru
Sirka and/or Rule Of Man settlers is a judgment call left to the whims of
the individual GM.

In my case, IMTU the Syleans are not a minor human race themselves, but
are descended from a mix of Vilani and Solomani. "Sylean" is more of a
cultural identifier, the way "Canadian" is for myself despite the fact
that if you go back far enough most of my ancestors were European (although
one branch ultimately came over the Bering Strait land bridge during the
last ice age)...

Which brings up a question for me; assuming the forces have control of the
\'high ground\', whats the best way of dropping your troops in oder to capture
the planet?  Together in armored shuttles (I think this is a bad idea
myself) or like in Starship Troopers, where they drop individually
\'halo-style\'?

It was fun watching a group of marines shooting each other with non leathal

IMHO, the best riot control weapon is something with no medical side effects,
able to be targeted effectively, and has minimal secondary effects. Watar canons
seem to fit the bill. Water casues no alergic reactions, the delivery will at
most cause abrasions and blunt trauma (on hitting the ground  or obsticals) and

Well I think that as a GM, its my job to kinda \'sniff out\' how resourceful
my players can be.  Get a feel for how they react and if needed, fudge a die
roll behind the scenes once in a while.  After all, the goal is for a fun
game.  It ain\'t fun if all the PCs die.  Conversely, if they do something
stupid like walking up to an Imperial Marine in BattleDress toting an
FGMP-14 and attack him bare-handed..:)

He won\'t get much of that article unless he\'s a Pyramid Online

IMO, it\'s worth $15 a year.  So, I recommend it to everyone, and if

Andrew did an article about the Ine Givar and posted it on the TML
before he wrote his Pyramid article.  It is archived in Digest 168
of 1998.  He can\'t give out the one in Pyramid, but the one in the
TML Digest is (or should be) still available for free download.

Hiroshima happened because the U.S. was the only country to possess nuclear
weapons. There was no chance that Japan could retaliate.  The whole
Manhattan project thing, with the USAA bombing water pipelines from Norway
to prevent heavy water deliveries to scientists in Germany was based on the
fear that Hitler would get the bomb first. Had he done so and dropped it
on....I don\'t know...***London*** for example the European war would have
been over. (Especially if it had been delivered by a V-2.)

The cold war happened because the USSR was spying on the American/British
nuclear projects and had the bomb themselves. If they had not, I feel that
sometime in the 1950\'s, during the major anti-red scare, the U.S. would have
nuked them. Once they had the ability to retaliate the balanced changed, and
it became unthinkable (to all but Barry Goldwater) that the U.S. would use
nuclear weapons in a regional war.

Obtrav: As long as the other major interstellar powers can use near C rocks
or mass drivers for orbital bombardment this method of warfare will not be
used. In side the 3I it won\'t be used because destroying a high pop world
would result in a general rebellion. The local Reserve and System Navy
forces would never support it, even if the Navy Admiralty did. Quite
possibly even nobles in other sectors might not support it (because of
pressure from their vassals), and support of the citizenry in general.

I just pictured an Impy Marine being launched in full BD at some planet
doing roughly 22,000 miles per hour. I know, I know, he would burn up on
entry into the atmosphere but the thought was there none the less. Huummmm,
if you could cool him down, I wonder just how big a crater he would make?

Yes, I know... but:

The way I interpret Vargr makes it... ahem... difficult for them to
research a thing like that. IMTU, they mostly steal things that other
people have. They know how to build things like slugthrowers, simple
spaceships and such, but advanced technology (hand-held laser weapons,
jumpdrives etc) they have to steal, purchase, or get from the Zho\'s (who
secretly sponsor them). Yes, this means that occassional Vargr Corsairs
pack some stolen nukes, but not on a large scale.

The Vargr are simply far too impatient to research anything complicated.
They have more enthusiasm than actual scientific skills. This got them
into space using large rockets (and blowing several of them into tiny
bits before that). A Vargr researching nukes would think something along
the lines of:

"OK... so this thing can explode. I\'ll test it in the back yard and see
how much. Calculating the stuff takes too much time."

BOOM!

Well, I\'m late to this thread (10 digests arrived over the weekend, when it\'s
normally 3-4 per day), but if you need alien names feel free to use the guys
from Adifux Inc LIC. They are:

1.   The Aslan noble, Sir Eoraokortitrikhue (OEG) of Rhylanor
[pronounced eeyore-ay-oh-kor-tea-trick-huey, or just "Huey"  ;-) ]
Huey has heavy weapon skills (he *loves* his grenade launcher), plus the Aslan
spear-hook and throwing boomerang.
Another fave trick is the snub pistol loaded alternatively with
tranq-HEAP-tranq-HEAP, etc.
Huey was in the Army, I think. Put it this way: he didn\'t receive BD skill until
*after* he mustered out. ;-)

2.   The Droyne noble, Sir Ervmisbe (OEG) of Auitawry
[pronounced erv-miz-bee, or "Irving"]
With a slight build, this Droyne Sport prefers laser weapons, esp. the pistol
and carbine. His exceptional psionic skill (PSI-15) allows hime to teleport
_with_ the pistol and a Droyne vacc-suit.
He has Telepathy-15, Telekinesis-15 and Teleport-15, but I don\'t know how to
translate that to GURPS.
He has had Dakhrongkae (which see) build him some little "toys": small,
completely-enclosed dome-shaped bombs. One favourite tactic is to teleport in
with a bomb, stick in on the target, teleport out, and trigger the _internal_
"pin" remotely. Works well on the back of Zho combat armour.  ;-)  Gliding in is
another option, but too often his armour is too heavy to do this!

3.   The Vargr noble, Sir Dakhrongkae (OEG), homeworld unknown
[pronounced dar-krong-key]
This guy is the group\'s mechanic. He has Engineering-4, Mechanical-3,
Gravitics-2, Electronics-2, but only Handgun-1.  ;-) He is forever tinkering
with stuff - latest project is a tri-barrel laser rifle for Irving. No, I don\'t
know if it could possibly work, but he is willing to try.  ;-)

Three thousand years is not a big distance in evolutionary terms for us

ancient Egyptian and Chinese civilisations, as well as the Celts and
Phonecians (sic).

we\'re taller, heavier and a fair bit healthier on average.

to be little different from us from a physical point of view.

Preview of Ground Forces (a real rough preview):

Making a forced landing is one of the most difficult exercises the Army or
Marines are called upon to perform.  Planning and executing these invasions
require several steps:

I.  Reconnaissance

	The target world needs to be scouted.  Ideally, Army Intelligence will
have maintained information on the planet\'s defenses for years before the
conflict.  Sylean Ranger or Marine Special Operations units will attempt to
infiltrate the world.
	What they are looking for is command and control centers, communications
nodes and planetary defence sites.  Recon troops work hand in hand with
Intelligence assets to make the best use of available information to
produce a complete picture of the enemy defenses.  Of course, this
information has to make it back to the Army commanders to be of any use.
If possible, recon teams are extracted by IISS ships.  If not, the
information is sent to IISS ships which then leave the system.

II.  Space Superiority

	For anything other than quick Marine raids, it is necessary to establish
reasonable control over orbital space.  It is rare to be able to completely
clear enemy activity, but the commander can not allow hostile vessels any
penetration of the Fleet screen.

III. Orbital Bombardment/Initial Raids

	Once orbital control is established, selected targets are engaged by fire
from Navy ships.  Highest priority is given to planetary defense sites that
have the ability to hit the fleet.  If necessary, fire is allocated to
secondary targets such as power generation centers, transportation nexi, or
population centers.  Imperial doctrine is to avoid unnecessary collateral
damage when possible, so ortillery fire is closely contained.
	At the same time, Marine units begin dropping to seize high value targets
such as the planet\'s starport.  Other raids are launched to both distract
and demoralize the defenders.  At this point in the operation, the overall
commander will make the final decision on where the main force will land.

IV. Pathfinder Landings

	Rapid Interface troops and Marines will make meteoritic reentry to seize
the dedicated landing zone.  At the same time, orbital fire will shift to
suppression of any enemy presence within 250 miles of the center of the LZ.
 The troops on the ground can count on heavy support from naval fighters as
well as their own attack speeders.

V.  Main Force Landing

	Under the cover of their fleet escorts, the massive Keith-class Brigade
transports begin reentry.  Supporting fire reaches it\'s most intense level
during this period of vulnerability.  Electronic Warfare units attempt to
reduce the enemy\'s ability to detect and communicate to such a low level
that they are effectively immobilized while the transports land.
	Once grounded, each transport disgorges it\'s load of two combat battalions
and support units.  Depending on the tactical situation, the transports may
be ordered back into space or told to remain on the surface.

VI.  Movement to Contact/Consolidation

	Once the combat units have formed up, they begin moving to their
objectives.  At the original landing zone, Beachmaster units begin the
difficult of setting up the necessary supply and medical units.

	The Imperial mode of combat emphasizes quick action and overwhelming
firepower.  Army leaders are taught the Fleet can not afford to linger over
a single planet, so never depend on endless support from the skies.  When
in the attack the Army and Marines use their firepower liberally.

The Vargr developed jump drive, and Lair has a higher TL that the Zhondani.
 As I recall from AM3, the Vargr found the Zhos, not the other way around.

Quite the opposite, I feel the Vargr mind set would encourage scientific
development.  Why?  Charisma.  Vargr are intelligent creatures, and the
Vargr who developed the Theory of Relativity would be the Alpha of Vargr
physicists.

It\'s tempting to see the Vargr as a wild howling pack of dogs.  Indeed,
that the impression the give much of the time.  But to ignore that they
inhabit an area of space equal if not larger than the Imperium and have
inhabited that area since before the First Imperium came along does them a
disservice.

Charisma is a difficult thing to get a handle on.  To be blunt, probably
the closet thing we can use as a comparison is lust.  Humans are
pre-programmed to react to certain indicators given off by the opposite
gender (same gender if you are gay-- and the odd thing is that they aren\'t
the same one that an opposite sex partner would respond to) with the
physical urge to mate.  Take away the higher brain functions, and human
males would do nothing but attempt to mate constantly.  (I\'m sure some of
the women on list would say that that\'s true even with the higher functions
in place :P)

But we can control that urge, for the most part.  We might have a physical
reaction, but we can understand that making a pass at the cop who is
writing you a ticket for 75 in a school zone is a Bad Idea.  The same for
charisma in a Vargr.  That new guy may be impressive as all hell, but
raiding Rhylanor in a single Corsair is suicide!  There will always be
Vargr who let their emotions guide them, just as there will be humans who
do the same.

Geez, start writing a reply and end up looking like the Vargr
Anti-Defemation League...

Ah.  What I lost was that the anti-electronics device was an EMP grenade. 
I was thinking it was something like the gadget that was used against
Yugoslavia, where a seal, like above, would be sufficient to protect your
gear.

Primitive EMP hardening might be possible, if awkward.  It would probably
be sufficient to reduce the effect of an EMP grenade, which could, after
all, not have too extreme an area of effect if it was to be used in a city.
 So, something more than a few meters away from such a grenade could be
safe, with fairly simple shielding.  Would the demonstrators have the
technicians capable of creating such shielding?  Obviously it depends, but
it\'s very likely.  They probably couldn\'t do it on the spot, but if this
device is do be used more than once, countermeasures are possible and
likely.

Well, that\'s great. Last I noticed, within the Imperium there are no feuding
superpowers. There can be no Cold War style situation in the Third
Imperium... well, there can be, but at that point you begin to get further
and further away from the canon view of the Imperium.

Yet, strangely enough "energy" ortillery will be alright, even though the
effects can be exactly the same. There are plenty of strange rules of
warfare in the real world, so I\'m not raising my eyebrows too much. So, what
you\'re actually saying is that these various interstellar civilizations,
each with *vastly* different views on... well, *everything* are going to all
decide to play by the same rules?

I do find that a little bit difficult to believe.

"Destroying a high pop world"... Geez, would people *please* stop putting
words into my mouth when they reply to my posts? I\'m not talking about
destroying high pop worlds. I\'m talking about dropping big rocks, not
busting planets in half.

Still, there\'s no reason to believe that such a scenario would result in a
general rebellion anymore than dropping a contingent of Imperial marines on
to the surface, backed up by ortillery would.

Yet they will support dropping Imperial troops onto the surface of the world
to engage in combat with guerilla forces, where the distinction between
combatants and non-combatants will most likely be blurred, and the
distinction between civilian and war production will most certainly be
blurred?

Moving rocks would be economical, but not militarily viable.

option 1: Move the mine to the miners. In order to reduce shipping delay of raw
materials to refineries, rich asteroids can be put into a low thrust intercept
to the location of said refineries. While they could take months or years, well
timed boosts could arrange an asteroid every other month.

option 2: Cheap transport. In a Jerry Pournelle book (Leonard will know which
one, I cant remember of hand), the miners hollowed out a rich nickel/iron
asteroid, filled it up with small amounts of VERY rich and rare alloys, as wll
as hold and silver, and blasted it to earth with an orion drive.

Really? So a world can\'t support itself without Imperial help. That\'s
interesting, \'cause we\'re not doing that bad here on Terra right now. ;)

Still, there are some worlds which require technological assistance to keep
their population alive. Of course, the Imperium wouldn\'t need to drop big
rocks on them to win them over.

Well, the large number of nationalist movements, self-determination
movements, and so on that exist and have existed in the real world seem to
be placed in opposition to your reasoning.

"In all other situations..." watch those generalizations, sir! ;)

Seriously, though, this is an awfully strange view of the way human beings
have been, and seem to be in the real world. Granted, this is descriptive
and not prescriptive (the problem with "human nature" is that it\'s
neccesarily descriptive) but even so, what happens when you\'re confronted
with a charismatic, nationalistic dictator, or ideology, or both?

Least damaging to whom? The planet or the Imperium?

If it\'s the former, dropping rocks is effectively the same as dropping
ground troops. You\'re still going to lose civilians, and it\'s more than
likely that you\'re going to decimate industrial centers. If it\'s the latter,
dropping rocks is a hell of alot cheaper and less time consuming than
dropping marines in battle dress.

Bribes only go so far. That\'s been tried at various points, and that
frequently fails as well. How easy would it be to bribe a Hitler, or a
Castro, exactly, or any other leader who manages to convince people, for
whatever reason, to do things that seem amazingly non-rational in
retrospect?

Just out of curiosity, how did we end up on the Marxist "peasant revolt"
line? It doesn\'t have to be "peasants" or "proles" who are doing the bulk of
the revolting at all. In fact, in cases like the American of French
Revolutions the peasants weren\'t even the real driving force behind the
rebellion.

Actually, religious disputes, historically, have been among the least
"dirty" wars, depending on how you look at it. This may simply be an
accident of history, since the same force that allowed mankind to make
really impressive weapons also happened to marginalize those religious
institutions that would be able to make war to a great degree.

However, if you were to add up the death toll of only two of the ideological
and nationalist wars of the twentieth century (World War I and World War II)
you\'re gonna find that the dirtiest wars weren\'t fought over religion at
all.

>And no doubt many other reasons/justifications. Wars still boil down to a

Fair enough, but you\'ve already stated that your previous statement was open
to misinterpretation. There\'s no reason to belabor the point.

;)

Still, it doesn\'t have to follow that the use of a brutal terror weapon
means that you have to turn the surface of a planet into slag and start over
again with a new crew of colonists.

Really? In a land war, it can be amazingly difficult for combatants to tell
who\'s a civilian and who\'s not. Of course, the blurring of distinctions
between civilian and military targets that invariably happens in modern
warfare makes this even more problematic.

Oh come on, who the hell\'s going to doubt the Imperium\'s capacity to drop
big rocks on their population centers at will? Anyone in the Imperium who
has the most rudimentary education is going to understand that it\'s a
painfully simple process.

Still, your "moon" scenario is just delaying the inevitable. Okay, the
Imperium does that once, and the populace folds. The Imperium does it again,
somewhere else, and the populace folds. What happens if the Imperium whacks
a moon a third time and the population says, "Nuts!"?

Was it now? I know, people can tell me how there were no real industrial
centers there, blah blah blah...

Still, do you happen to have access to some information the world isn\'t
privvy to? Perhaps morale levels among soldiers and civilians in Germany
after the news got out? Can you say with certainty the bombing of a civilian
target - which Jens noted was where civilians were going to avoid being
incinerated - had no effect whatsoever on the war?

Yes, and this message was sent in a big, atomic fireball... This further
supports my point, actually. After all, what happened to the fence sitters
who would (under your model) rise up and strike back at their foes as a
result of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki?

Again, you go on to support my point, since the infrastructure of both
countries was decimated by more traditional forms of warfare. ;)

Oh. I had no idea. Being a relative newbie (2yrs), I have only got T4
and G:T material. Sad...

And no, I don\'t have the money to buy the reprints...

Why does this way of thinking remind of the scientists of another race,
one I know far better from real life?

Certainly. That\'s the way I\'ve run them.  :-)

From the G:T module, I got the impression that Vargr space was much
smaller. I hate not having access to canon material like this piece of
information!

Anyway, thanks a lot for enlightening me. I will start a Traveller
campaign with a new group during spring or so. I will change my view of
the Vargr for that campaign.

Is there perhaps a web source of basic information about the different
races, perhaps with a general timeline thrown in? Is there good (better
than in T4) examples of such material in GURPS: Traveller (the main
book, which I don\'t have)?

<snip of thoughts on Charisma>

Interesting thoughts. I\'ve played them more like a wolf pack, with a
strong leader having to show off his strength to the others.

    If you\'re dropping troops to the surface to grab what is, in all
likelihood,
an already well-defended target, such as a starport or other "high value
target", why wouldn\'t you make that, or one of those, your main beachhead?
If you\'re talking "hit and get" raids, yeah, but I got the impression that
you
were talking seize and _hold_ the starport.  Troops already on the ground
would make suppression of local air-defense (or their analogue) possible
as well as being able to designate/clear landing zones as well as giving
the main force, hopefully, a relatively fire-free zone to muster in.
    I could be wrong, but it read to me as if you were saying that the
"initial raids" and "pathfinder landing" were two different and completely
seperate stages.  It would seem to me to be better to combine them.
If nothing else, this forces the defender to decide what is a feint, what is
a raid, and what is the legitimate main force landing (re: Hitler, Normandy,
and Pas-de-Calais).

J-Man, each has their advantages and disadvantages.
Shuttles make targets, big and obvious, but
individuals are smaller targets, and hopefully one
blast doesn\'t take out a whole company. However the
old problem with paradrops is that the unit gets
broken up. If you\'ve trained with Sgt Slaughter,
Corporal Jim-Bob and your best friend Cyril every day
for the past two years in the "Glorious Gonzo
Company", and suddenly down on the ground you\'re with
a bunch of bozos you don\'t know, in the "Confused
Klutz Company", well, you\'re just not going to fight
as well. In military strategy when the enmey mixes you
all up in a mass of confusion, nobody knowing who\'s in
charge, they call that "disruption," and it\'s a chief
aim of the enemy, who will happily drive armour into
your flanks to finish you off. When you do it to
yourself, it\'s not called "disruption", it\'s called "a
successful paradrop."

I\'d go for the armoured cars, myself. Unless unit
cohesion ain\'t important to you, which I suppose it
isn\'t if you have trained beserker fanatics who don\'t
need back-up or organisation.... "I only need to know
one thing... where the bugs are... blood blood blood!"

Who remembers Moff Tarken in Star Wars? He was never
ordered to go and waste Alderaan.... who here thinks
that if the Death Star had survived the Emperor would
have cashiered and executed Tarken? I think he just
got carried away with his big new toy. Alderaan\'s
annual taxes might\'ve paid for a whole new Death Star.

What are the possibilities for a Death Star type
weapon in Traveller? Maybe a humungous Meson Gun?

Well, 22,000 mph is about 6 miles/sec. or about 9.8 km/sec. At *3*
km/sec the impact energy is equivalent to an equal mass of TNT going
off. Energy goes up as the square of the velocity. 

So my figures say he goes off like 11 times his mass in TNT. Assume 250
kilos for trooper and suit, and you get the equivalent of an old time
"block buster" bomb (actually about 2.6 tons of TNT)

Depends on the rock\'s size, shape, composition and rotation rate. But
giving enough of a nudge in the last few *minutes* (which is all the
longer the rock will be in range since it\'s travelling 30-40 km/sec) is
going to be really hard. 

You do have one advantage. A dinosaur killer *won\'t* skip off the
atmosphere. It\'ll plow right on thru. It\'s just *too* massive. But a
city killer is a different story.

One good question deserves another, under the same set of circumstances how
differentiated do you think Vargr will have become?  My remembrances of
reading what I presume is the canon Vargr module suggests that there has
been considerable variance among the Vargr, even assuming that Grandpappy
started from a single homogenous genetic stock, not a forgone conclusion in
my opinion.  That module referenced both very large and smaller than average
Vargr sub-races resultant from his genetic manipulation.    While I am not a
zoologist it is my understanding that the germplasm of modern canines is
arguably more plastic that homo sap., as witness the wide variance in modern
canine breeds.  On the flip side I understand the modern breeds will, within
a few feral generations of interbreeding revert to an archetypal short
haired dog about 25 to 35 pounds in weight.   Thus I ask the question, how
do others play variations in Vargr "genotypes" if at all.   Is there "racial
prejudice" within the Vargr race based on fur color, length of fur, fur
texture, body size, body confirmation, jaw configuration or length of fang?

For that matter, it would have been fairly easy to smuggle a few nukes
into the US about freighters from "neutral" nations (assuming that they
decided *not* to risk delivery by submarine). 

And this is a lot more likely, since V2s weren\'t that accurate, and
they didn\'t really have the payload (they only carried a ton of
explosive. Early nukes ere not only heavier than that, they were *way*
thicker). 

I suspect that New York City would be the first target, simply because
it\'d be the easiest to sneak into. Washington is a bit far up the
Potomac.

"Build Your Own Atomic Bomb and *Really* Wake Up the Neighborhood" (or
something like that) was the title of an article printed in the 70s in
Analog. It details how to build a *really* crude nuke. Really dirty
too. 

And yes, they left out details. Ones that might get you killed. But the
damn thing *would* work.

Basicly, all you need are the fissionables, a 2-story house with
basement, and some fairly common tools and construction materials. You
*don\'t* need any explosives!

Niven style "stasis fields" would be *great* for drops. Form up a
company (or whatever) in BD, slap a stasis fiels around them, and throw
them at the target, with the field set to drop just after impact. The
field drops and they bounce out of the still glowing crater....

Oddly, they aren\'t all that great for defensive use. You can\'t *do*
anything while inside them, since a second inside is a few million
years outside. And you can\'t shoot out of them either. Nor do they
"hide" that well. 

Turn one on as a "last resort" and when it goes down, you\'ll either be
surrounded by enemy weapons, ready to be set off, or if you *really*
pissed them off, the weapons *will* go off as soon as the field goes.
Ouch. 

But for a combat drop, they\'d be great. Worst that can happen is that
they throw something big at you and your "group" winds up in a
different spot. But even that would be hard to pull off.

Maybe it\'s just as well Traveller doesn\'t have them...

You\'ve never seen what a regular fire hose can do, have you? And you\'ve
*definitely* never seen what a water cannon can.

At the speeds and pressures involved, the *water* can break bones. You
don\'t have to be thrown against anything. 

There are pictures available of the time the authorities used "mere"
firehoses on civil rights demonstrators in the South. And you can see
the water stream "pick up" and "throw" people 10 and 20 feet. Anything
pushing hard enough to do *that* and less than a foot across can and
will produce blunt trauma all by itself.

As for water cannon, there are cases on record (from repressive
regimes) where they were used and *cut people in half*. Those things
can punch holes in concrete blocks or some frame buildings. Using them
on people is *not* remotely "without medical side effects".

I remember reading that article in my school library.  My favorite part
was the safety caution not to get your sub-critical masses too close to
each other prior to the planned event, as a "squib" explosion could
occur.  The author used words to the effect that such a squib explosion
would barely manage to blow up the building, and "terrorists who only
succeed in blowing themselves up are not terrifying at all, but merely
amusing."

In modern canine breeds, there are families rather
than species. Eg the modern "sausage dog" came from
16th centruy England, when a breeder dred a
long-bodied dog with another, got their children to
mate with each-other, selected the longest-bodied of
_their_ children, and so on. Essentially it\'s a case
of breeding _in_ the recessive genes. You could do
exactly the same with humans if you wanted to, and
were patient. For example, you could create a race of
"hobbits" by breeding one midget with another, and
making their children mate with each-other, and so on.
Canine "breeds" are very simply inbred families.
(anybody seen the X-Files episode, "home"? icky!) If
you could make Michael Jordan mate with the head of
the Russian women\'s basketball team, you could make a
race of "giants", and so on.

So I\'d say the Vargr would probably just be mongrels,
really. I\'m sure that with language and higher
intelligence they would have developed the same incest taboo.

Way bother grabbing the starport at all? If commercial starships can land
at a type X starport (AKA a big empty field) than a combat lander should be
able to. 

So, for a planetary assault you could drop a brigade or two in a deserted
spot. They grab a large enough area for your combat engineers or seabees to
build a new starport. The new starport lets you land troops in a secure
area while the people on the planet are busy re-routing their troops to an
area they were not prepared to defend. If you are not willing to bombard
high value targets, well, the local troops will be coming to you so you can
hit them in a low value area.

And if the locals don\'t come out to play? Grap the rest of the planet and
starve them out. (What tech level does weather control become practical?)

Granted, this won\'t work with a world with a high enough pop. A world with
a population greater than maybe 7 or so, you will probably end up having to
hit at least  some of the population centers hard. This might start out
with EMP bursts and escalate (clean airbursts to burn soft targets) if the
locals didn\'t surrender.

And a final thought. The Imperium is made up of 11,000 worlds. Burning one
world every few decades might be a cost effective measure if it makes other
worlds think twice about leaving.

Sorry J, but I can only offer success stories about Amazon.com.  I have a
friend that buys regularly, every couple of months from Amazon.com, never
less than $500 (AUST) each order and is stuff arrives within a couple of
weeks from the U.S.  He gets books, CD\'s, CD-ROM\'s, and DVD\'s without a
hitch.

A Aussie computer magazine (APC) also ran an article on on-line buying
(something pretty slow to take off in Australia - Aussies disliking giving
their credit card details over the net), how it is slow but improving.
Aussies were advised mainly to avoid Aussie on-line stores as the prices
were not comparable to U.S. on-line stores, even considering shipping
costs!!!!!  Anyway, to get back to the thread, the writer compared several
local and overseas stores buy anonymous personal buying (something he did,
which gave him an inside on the article) and found that Amazon.com was the
fasted to deliver his goods (even with shipping to Australia), and when he
ordered book "X" and they actually sent book "Z" instead, upon e-mailing
them, he not only got the original book within days by an overseas express
delivery service, he was told to keep the other product as compensation for
the delay.  All this without them knowing he was a computer journo or that
he would write about it in an article some months later!

I can\'t offer you any help, I\'m sorry, but if I can find the article, it
does give legal (although Aussie - but it may be a start) points on what to
do.

Actually, PCs in a planetary assault situation would tend to find the
tactical situation (what is our immediate mission objective, how do we
get there, what support do we have, and who will relieve us) far more
important than the echelons-above-gawd (EAG) strategic view (why are we,
at _this_ time, seizing _this_ world, and how will we assemble the
needed forces to seize it).  Thus, while an EAG game (such as _Fifth
Frontier War_), with a ground force scale of units up to field army
size, can abstract space, ground-space interface, and ground combat, the
typical PCs will _need_ to have all the details we\'re discussing in this
thread.

(Yes, I know that I skipped the operational level of war.  In my
defense, I would expect most warfare-related campaigns to place the PCs
either in the units actually engaging in combat [see _Striker_ for
details], or in positions on the General Staff, deciding how to
prosecute the war as a whole [as in FFW].  Even operational-level
campaigns [with the PCs as commanders of combat operations involving a
single world] would require knowledge of the tactical doctrine being
employed by units under those commanders\' direction.)

I believe that the comments about greater capacity for violence making war
infeasible are also less than relevant to my original comments. The point is
that even with the capability for extremely high levels of violence, most
(notice the use of this word, in case anyone decides to give a list of
counterexamples) groups agree to a set of conventions which limit the impact
of the fighting.

Rambling on:

Note that even under the current law of land warfare, you are entitled to
reprisals if your enemy violates the conventions. Considering the number of
violations by the Iraqis in the Gulf War, think about the possible *real*
reason for some events in the war.

Even further afield:

Much like the SCA, who do not reenact history as is was, but rather
something like
"history as it should have been," Traveller is not the future, but "the
future as it should be," at least from the POV of the authors. In reality,
it will not even be close, but that
shouldn\'t stop it from being an interesting game.

Actually, all three methods are important components of a planetary
assault.  Large (battalion or larger) jump troop formations will be used
either to seize the initial "spacehead(s)", or to secure key terrain
features to prevent or delay the enemy\'s early counterattacks on the
spacehead(s).  Smaller formations (battalion and smaller) would conduct
diversionary raids, to disrupt the enemy\'s ability to respond quickly to
the assault.  For assaults on low-population worlds with few high-payoff
targets, jump troops, possibly reinforced by small grav vehicle
contingents, may be sufficient to secure the world under attack. 
Attacks on these target worlds would most likely consist of Imperial
Marine regiments, with little or no Army participation in actual
combat.  OTOH, if Army units of corps size or larger are to be involved
in active ground combat (as compared to counterinsurgency, pacification,
or occupation duties), then the preferred units would be Army Rapid
Interface formations.

The jump troop lodgments would then be reinforced (if necessary) by grav
vehicles descending from orbit.  These forces would provide the
firepower needed to enable the invaders to expand the spacehead(s)
enough to provide fairly secure rear areas.

However, the vast majority of troops, equipment, and supplies would
reach dirt via shuttle (and/or landing-capable starships), landing in
the now-secured rear areas seized and expanded by jump troops and
direct-assault grav vehicles.  After all, the biggest problem with
direct-drop forces is that resupply is too difficult to maintain for
long periods of time without use of shuttles and/or landing-capable
ships.  The shuttle-borne flow of supplies, reinforcements, and
replacements to the spacehead(s) will enable the invader to secure both
important objectives on-planet and travel routes betwen those
objectives.  These forces will almost always consist of Imperial Army
forces that have been mobilized from regular or colonial subsector
elements.

    Radar and/or other sensor/scanner installations (probably best on the
planet), small craft and local naval bases, repair facilities, warehouses
(full of stores potenially useful to either side), I  assume that the
planetary
political and/or industrial heartland will likely be fairly close to the
main
starport for ease of access.  Most of this assumes a down starport, but
an orbital one will be taken fairly easily early in the campaing.  Even if
you don\'t want to hold the downport, you probably want to disrupt it heavily
to minimize enemy use of it.  And you don\'t want to scrag it completely
unless your in a "total war" environment, because it\'s too damn expensive
to rebuild.  To me, this means either a hit-and-run raid or outright seizure
is desirable.
    Also, although a really big combat lander probably CAN land in an open
field, I expect re-inforced surfaces will be prefered.  Chief Engineer to
Captain: "Sir, due to uneven sinkage rates, we appear to have taken on
a 12% cant to starboard and nearly 15% towards the bow.  I reccommend
EXTREME caution on take off."

A knoted string will kill in the wrong hands. Any feasable riot control weapon
requires a brain to use. If you are going to use high preasure water at knife
fighting ranges, then you MUST expect casulties. It was one of the strong points
mentioned in the Non Lethal Weapons show on Discovery.

Water IF USED CORRECTLY is:

1. Non irratant. It will not cause fits and alogegnic reations. It is non
poisonous. It cannot cause toxic shock. If it does puncture the skin it can not
cause any secondary effects (apart from the trauma itself).

2. Aimable. Yes you can aim at heads. But aiming at the torso or legs is more
effective and harder to avoid.

3. Cheap. In non deasert enviroments, water is cheap, and in a pinch can be made
by burning hydrogen. Any starship can be used as a riot vehicle in a pinch (and
may be a feature on some ships!).

Again, we are talking about the system, not the people using it. If you want to
use it to kill, there are better ways of doing it. If you using excessive force
to crush a riot, why use water? Plasma guns and Fusion guns haver better ranges,
better blowthrough (I got 3 gollywogs with 1 shot!) and better fear causing
atributes (people wont generally assult a plasma gun enplacement no matter
what). I can suppress a riot with knotted sting, and kill people with it (and
has been historically used , it\'s called a whip).

<scenerio : Me as riot suppressor commander>

Do I have the will to use lethal force and live with the consequences?

No.

If called to suppress a riot with water, would I do it? Yes.

Why?

Because I know if I keep control of the situation, I can minimalise the
causualties. I want to cause fear and loathing in the rioters, not martyrs for
the cause. If I loose control of my troops, no mater what they are armed with
(chopsticks, canes, whips, SMG\'s, black puddings) they can and will kill. (Ask
the East Timorese).

</scenerio>

I would fear a uncontrolled force armed with silly putty , or a force willing to
use leathal force more than I would a profesional force with a water cannon.

And history shows that sooner or later, a government that resorts to leathal
force against its own will fall.

Black puddings?  Doesn\'t one have to be a proponent of Eccie Thump (sp?) to

Second, that\'s fiction. What reaction intelligent being would have to

Not just intelligent beings - *alien* intelligent beings. While Narns may
be played in the show by humans in fancy makeup, it could be very
dangerous to assume that "real" Narns will respond to all situations in 
similar ways to how humans react.

Narns seem to me a bit more fatalistic than humans, for example.
Such fatalism may allow them to collectively do some pretty heroic
looking things, as they\'d have an easier time convincing themselves 
that death is a reasonable price to pay for the attainment of a goal.

Hmmm fusion reactors come in at TL9 damper boxes come in at TL11 and
projectors at TL12, now while TL9 fusion reactors may be quite large
relative to what comes later in FFS1 they can be built as small as 100 cubic
meters producing 200Mw. From TL9 to TL12 only the reactors minimum size
changes. This implies to me that damper technollogy was not advanced enough
at these TLs to be used to increase fusion.

In the Starship Operators guide it did say that fusion reactors had a
deuterium tank which was used for crash starting the reactor. Could not the
fuel purification system include items to seperate deuterium and possibly
tritium to help initiate the fusion reaction?

IIRC, in ST the book, each trooper is controlling
a square mile or so of territory, so it\'s not surprising
that they drop individually. They also have a high
cross country movement rate (bouncing along by grav belt?)

If instead of a single trooper, you needed a squad with
full support weapons, you might well vote for the shuttle.

With trav tech, you have the possibility of "flattening"
a bit of the planet that no one is interested in, landing
there and then having a 12,000km NOE trip to your objective.

If the Imerium is doing its job right, the starport is the ecconomic centre
of the planet. It also contains the mercantile interests that you have come

IMHO

This sounds more first imperium than third. The 3I (in the twelfth century)
isn\'t forcing people to join or stay for security reasons (like it did in
previous centuries.) Now it\'s trying to be a low burden, high value trade
protection operation. It wants to use its large economy with low taxes
to outlast its opponents (an extreme version of the way the US "won" the
cold war)

Well, since it is stated in HG that they are separate fleets, and I\'ve seen
references to "Local" fleets in at least two adventures, I think that
they\'re probably NOT the same things... so Basically, since CT and MT
assume a semi-feudal late 3I, I took that to mean their own governance,
taxation, and fleets. So IMTU, the Imperial Navy has it\'s Numbered and
Sector Fleets. The Sector Duke has his "Reserve Fleets". The Subsector
Dukes have their "Police Fleets", which match the numbered reserve fleets
answerable to the Sector duke, at least in number (although seldom by
tyupes or numbers of hulls), and any world which can afford it has at least
a few SDB\'s or Type-T\'s...

So, in any given world, you have the local Government\'s Fleet, a portion of
the Subsector Fleet, the possibility of a portion of the Sector Duke\'s
Numbered Reserve Fleet, and a possibility of a portion of the Imperial
Numbered Fleet for that subsector, plus a possibility for a portion of the
Sector Dukes Named Reserve Fleet, and a possibility of a portion of the
Imperial Named Fleet. And, if part of some sub-subsector polity, the
Count\'s Fleets might show, too!

Then again, IMTU, the Imperial Government levies a 1% stock levy per
issuance for all off-planet buisinesses, for each of the following:
Subsector Duke of Homeworld, Sector Duke of Each Sector operated in, Each
Archduke whose domains are operated in, and 1% more to the Emperor (who is
also Archduke of Sylea, thus getting 2%). I make it part of the Office,
rather than the Fief. Plus, Most Subsectors and sectors IMTU charge between
0.1% and 1.5% GPP taxes, too.

Actually, religious disputes, historically, have been among the least
"dirty" wars, depending on how you look at it. This may simply be an
accident of history, since the same force that allowed mankind to make
really impressive weapons also happened to marginalize those religious
institutions that would be able to make war to a great degree.

However, if you were to add up the death toll of only two of the ideological
and nationalist wars of the twentieth century (World War I and World War II)
you\'re gonna find that the dirtiest wars weren\'t fought over religion at
all.
</Chris>

However, it does often seem that wars in which religion is a major motivating factor are inclined to get nastier quicker.  Many of the more notorious cases of atrocities and attacks on civilians seem to happen more often in religious conflicts that nationalist or ideological conflicts.  Whilst the two \'World Wars\' had many documented cases of atrocities, I suspect that in proportion to the numbers of combatants involved many of the smaller conflicts in history founded in religion were far nastier.

You don\'t consider the Zho / Imperium relationship that of feuding
superpowers? It fits the classic example, down to the support of the
conflict between the Darrians and the Sword Worlds as sponsored governments.

A contingent of Marines can be surgical. Take out the leaders, take out the
troublemakers, the balance of the population, who probably doesn\'t care
who\'s in charge as long as business is good doesn\'t get hurt. Well mostly
anyway.  Start using weapons of mass destruction: Bio-weapons, Nukes, big
rocks, and their general apathy starts to turn to rebellion pretty quick.

Sounds just like the invasion of Terra during the Solomani Rim War.

this space flight is at least one of the two precursors to the actual
launching of Chinese citizens, or what they term "taikonauts" in
English. The word comes from Chinese "taikog" (sp?) = cosmos/space, and
"ren" for men. The spacecraft itself is called "Shenzhou" for "magical vehicle."

It\'s an exciting prospect and the Chinese have put their own touch onto
what looks like an effort based upon the Russian Soyuz. Of course the
Americans have also "donated" (and I use the word cautiously, in light
of the current spy scandal on our shores) their technology to the Long
March launch vehicle, in service since 1996.

Nevertheless, it should generate a lot of inquiries and comments from
people around the world. When they pull off their first manned space
flight, it is my hope that both the USA and Russia, as well as the
European Space Agency, will welcome the Chinese accomplishment with open
arms and invite them to participate in future space missions as an
instrument of international good will.

There is an unofficial web site dedicated to the Chinese manned space
flight efforts. It\'s called "Go Taikonauts!" and it is located at:

http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Launchpad/1921/

I think this would be a good Off-Topic discussion for Traveller fans.

Please note that in the quote above I said "within the Imperium".

No doubt that a contingent of marines can be surgical. However, a surgical
strike is *anything* but what the Imperium would need in a scenario like the
one that forms the basis for this discussion.

I am curious as to how you\'ve come to the conclusion that "general apathy
starts to turn to rebellion pretty quick"? While it seems to me that,
historically, armies in the field tend to fight better when they hear about
atrocities commited on their civilian populations, there\'s no real evidence
that atrocities *generate* revolutions.

Besides, the Imperium is in that boat already. In the scenario we\'re talking
about, there already *is* a general rebellion on the surface of the planet.
If a few fence sitters change sides it really doesn\'t matter. What are they
going to do, thumb their noses at the Imperial warships, effectively
invisible and untouchable, somewhere past the sky?

You\'ve made my point for me. In this case, only the avatar of destruction is
being changed, not the fact that the destruction occurs. From the point of
view of the Imperium, the use of big rocks is much cheaper than a marine
invasion, so why is it that folks claim that such scenarios will be "rare"?

	Interesting idea, but I wonder about the cost of a Death
	Star. It is described as the size of a "small moon," and
	certainly looks like one from close up. Anyone have a
	guestimate of its tonnage? I cannot imagine anything
	just 1 km in diameter being refered to as a "small moon,"
	perhaps 10 km would be a minimum. This is about 3.88x10^10
	dtons. It might require more than a few planets worth of
	annual taxes.

	That would be the best of the canon weapons systems, IMHO.
	Of course, some sort of grav device might be effective at
	allowing the planet to blow itself appart. In any event,
	it would have to be BIG.

Heh. I have a semi-funny story relating to that... A 
classmate of mine and I went to a local ham enthusiasts\'
club one night (we were both in computer engineering at the
time in university). There were a couple of guys from Bell
giving a presentation on how they installed fiber lines.
They had one of these cool boxes with multiple camera/microscope
and a tiny little arc welder that made splicing fiber seem 
pretty damn easy (having had to do it by hand in a lab, let
me tell you that butting up two pieces of fiber, half the
diameter of a human hair, is not easy).

After hearing about all the wonderful properties of fiber
versus copper one of the HAMs, totally serious, stood up
and said how great fiber would be to run from his power

Now, on the other hand, in all fairness, I can barely work
an FM radio in spite of having taken multiple courses on
electromagnetics and antennas, so it\'s not like he was the
only idiot in the room.

According to published Star Wars sources its a sphere about 120 km in
diameter, thus it has a displacement of 6.463 x 10^14 dtons. The second DS
is supposed to be larger.

The cost of the frame alone would be ... significant.

Not a universal result of intelligence. Remember that in Ancient Egypt
(Right up to the First Century BCE) the Pharaoh and his sister were often
mated, to maintain the "purity" of the bloodline.

(I LIKE this way of doing attributions.)

I think I\'m the one who started this by saying that religious wars are the
nastiest and bloodiest, and I should have been clearer about what I meant
by that.  I should have said "ideological wars" but I was talking in
shorthand-- while I have a strong faith, ideological wars exemplfy what
bugs me about Religion with a capital R, which doesn\'t necessarily have
anything to do with any real conception of God/dess.

I have a degree (MA) in History with concentrations in Medieval Studies,
Women\'s History (don\'t hate me, I still shave my legs OK?) and History of
Science and the Occult.

My favorite professor said that it was during the Crusades that people
really began to make the intellectual leap toward dehumanizing others and
that prior to this, even though there may have been a religious aspect,
wars were fought mostly over territory.

When you are fighting over territory and you just want to take other
people\'s lands and stuff away from them, you aren\'t going to salt the
fields or use a nuclear weapon because you want to preserve what\'s there.
Nine times out of ten you will restrict your predations on the populace
to some degree because you will probably want them as servants.

Wars of genocide and wars of mass destruction, whatever weapons are used,
are always the wars that are fought over ideas, and religion was the first
big idea that people were willing to fight over that way.

In the 20th century, of course, religion has largely been replaced with
various ideologies in the industrialized world.  Capitalism vs. communism
(though there is a lot of religious crap attached to both ideas-- there
are fundamentalist Christians who talk as though the current economic
system of the US were divinely ordained in the Bible, hahaha, and one of
the things communists are most vilified for is the suppression of
religion, which I hardly think is the worst thing that say, Red China, has
ever done!) and other such ideologies, like religion, can be used to
dehumanize the enemy.

But even so, if you have a really nasty conflict, with ecological damage,
systematic rape, death camps, etc. nine times out of ten there is ideology
involved-- the Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian mess is partly religious in
nature-- and the tenth time it\'s a couple of small groups of people that
have been hating each other and competing for scarce resources for
hundreds of years.  Combine the two, as in Bosnia, and...

Anyhow, I still remember in the late 80\'s when the communist gov\'ts fell
in Eastern Europe and I was like "oh shit, there goes Yugoslavia."  My
Reaganite mother was horrified and insisted that now that these people had
found Democracy (to her, like finding Jay-zus, whom I differentiate from
Jesus Christ in that Jesus Christ does not make you weird and Jay-zus
does)-- they would forever be able to live in peace, and was really
irritated at my suggestion that a strong central government was the only
thing keeping those people from killing each other.

I haven\'t discussed it with her since, mostly because she and I don\'t get
along (we haven\'t spoken at all since 91 anyway) but I often wonder if she
ever recalls that conversation.

This doesn\'t invalidate, or even contradict the common incest taboo.
Since the Pharoahs were seen as divine beings, the rules did not apply
to them. Thus it _ever_ is with the ones on the top of the heap.

This is NOT to say that Vargr will necessarily be completely genetically
homgeneous. There has been a LOT of time for genetically distinct races
of Vargr to evolve and plenty of opportunity to do so, what with the
various long nights, short naps and other suchlike events throughout
known space.

They\'ll not be breeds, such a Great Vargr and Chihuavargr ;-) but there
will be (and according to canon, are, IIRC, though I may be remembering
the Forbidden Canon here) distinct \'races\'.

Which, of course, opens up the question of why you don\'t just put a damper box around a nuclear weapon, to shield it from external forces.

Well, blowing up a planet takes in the vicinity of 10^32 joules (for an earth-sized object), which is around a trillion tons of antimatter, making the idea of blowing up a planet by simple force a bit impractical.

What you want is a ranged matter-energy converter, or perhaps a fusion catalyst (though that would be more effective for blowing up gas giants).  Either one is well above Imperial tech levels.

	[Steve replied]  or, for those of us with a little less Wilsonian
view, maybe the idea that the Chinese are planning to put a manned craft
into space within 2 years (optimistic, IMO) and a person on the moon within
10 (more realistic, perhaps?) will FINALLY get NASA and more importantly
Congress to program a more aggressive US space program?  The good
achievements in telepresence (a notable recent failure notwithstanding...;)
have really not made up for the essentially moribund US space effort since
Apollo.  How about a Mars landing by 2010?

	The Chinese establishment has always seemed to be better able to
take a longer term view (not to overgeneralize) and I rather doubt they
would land personnel on the moon, never to come back for 30 years...

	Also, inbreeding is not so much of a problem in some

I was responding to the specific scenario of a worlds leaders deliberately
sabotaging their own infrastructure not making a general point. If say
some political leader were to order you to destroy your source of income
in order to annoy some larger political body would you? Would your neighbor?

If they\'re fanatics who\'d rather die than accept Impie rule they would.
But such people are rare in the extreme.

True there are Welsh seperatists. And a lot more Welsh who are more or
less happy being british. Then there are the Quebec seperatists. And twice
in a row they\'ve voted down independence.
There are other examples, my point being that in any reasonably large
population you will be able to find a number of quislings and a lot of
people who won\'t care who is in charge as long as they have bread
on the table and a reasonable expectation of having more of the same in
the future.

Some people become adherents of the said dictator/ideology many don\'t.
The trick is to kill the adherents whilst leaving as untouched as posible

that
these are one and the same.

If you don\'t mind who or what you hit you can just drop rocks.
If the historical record on strategic bombing can be used as
an analogy for the rock dropping you propose then it won\'t
be as effective as MIB and will result in a good many more
civilian deaths.

Maybe not Hitler but how about the Krupps? Or the general staff?
Or even confronting Hitler in 36 or 37 when the wermacht was still
A small and mostly obsolete force instead of the much larger army
of 39.

On the subject of Castro. I was going to go there but I won\'t.

Either the planetary leaders or the planets population intend to leave the
Imperium. If the leaders don\'t or if the leaders can be co-opted then
that leaves everybody else. I\'m just trying to remind you that planets
aren\'t political monoliths. Just because a group of plotters wants to
seperate from the benevelent 3I doesn\'t make that the will of the
populace. And just because the working stiffs want to suceede doesn\'t
necesarily imply that the holders of political power will go along.

I was thinking dirty in the sense of less likely to obey "civilized rules of

rather than more deadly per se.

Allow me to expand your reasoning here. Lets suppose that you drop your
carefully limited rocks to enforce your will. Sure this works for a while
untill
someone says "Well they always stop short of causing real damage we can
call their bluff." And sooner or later it escalates to needing to slag
planets to
prove you are willing to slag planets. and eventually you can\'t keep the
fiction
of a benevellent Imperium going and lots of worlds and probably quite a few
fleets rebel and the next thing you know....

The war wasn\'t over untill the gropos had occupied germany. The fire bombing
of Dresden did\'nt materially hasten the occupation. Ergo the firebombing was
"more or less irrellevant...."

Again at that point it was obvious that the Japanese had lost the war.
The question was at that point what concessions could they get from
the US. The bomb just convinced Hirohito that all of his people would die.
He ordered the unconditional surrender (which wasn\'t quite unconditional
they got to keep their emperor). If this still supports your thesis (in your
opinion) well so be it.

I\'m sorry but the infrastructures of both countries were destroyed by
strategic
bombing (mostly) which is closer in spirit to your rocks than to my MIB\'s.
Also. The point I was trying to make is that we forestalled another war by
A) Physically occupying both countries with large forces.
B) Rebuilding the destruction we had caused in our attempt to drive them to
their knees.

The cost of these paliatives would far outweigh any monitary savings for
orbital bombardment and the cost of not occupying/rebuilding would be
the need to go back and do it twenty years later with the added bonus
that more of your enemy will be convinced that you are evil.

Well, this keeps people from importing plant for agricultural purposes,
but if you accept the basic premise that it\'s a true garden world, then
that\'s probably not a big deal. Assuming Whanga has the same level of
biodiversity as Earth, which is reasonable, then there\'s no shortage of
possible plants to cultivate agriculturally. 

There really isn\'t an issue of Whanga\'s plant life being inedible by 
humans, as the Vilani and several dozen other minor human species seem to have
made out ok by living off of a biosphere that, at first glance, would seem
incompatible. If there\'s something that grows on Whanga that looks like a
potato and contains a lot of something resembling starch, then chances are it
can be shugili(sp?)-ized into something edible.

To be honest, the concept of an un-farmable garden world is about as far
fetched as you can get and I don\'t think I\'ll be able to really cook up a
complete explanation. But I can give it a whack...

Yup, sure - just compost everything and you don\'t even really need an orbital
station, though that would be nice - you just have to build a large,
self-contained biosphere dirtside. This is one thing I may just have to plain
old ignore. :)

Yeah, true. I suppose a planet is a pretty big place, even a measly 
size 6 one. I don\'t have the stomach to calculate how much "stuff"
there would be after a few centuries of tourism, but it would be
pretty manageable, sure. Terraforming the place with it is an interesting
idea... (ski mount Crapmore!)

My only open question is that I wonder if the agricultural worlds of
the Imperium notice the loss of biomass over time? I mean, if you have
"Alberta-zon", the planet covered with wheat (and right-wing politicians)
that\'s perpetually being shipped out to feed the legions or whatever, do they
start to suffer after a few centuries? Do they notice the loss of
nutrients, minerals, etc?

Anyway, on to the idea of an un-farmable garden world.

The basic idea is that the planet\'s plant life grows fine, like Terra\'s, but
there exists a combination of factors that makes monocultural farming difficult
to impossible.

For example, when you till a field on Whanga, a week later you\'ll have a nice
green patch of thick grass & weeds. It\'s difficult to farm effectively when the
weeds choke out the crops before they even sprout. (On the other hand, Whangan
potatoes would probably make a great crop off-planet... imagine crops that grow
faster than the weeds.)

The normal solution would be to apply a selective herbicide, but wow, Whangan
plants are remarkably adaptable to herbicides and you\'ll run out of herbicidal
formulations pretty fast (say, in a decade or so).

Another option might be to farm something that doesn\'t mind weeds, like fruit
trees, but, unfortunately, there\'s a mould/fungus/insect grub that tends to
spread from tree to tree quickly, wiping out the entire orchard once the fungus
taken root (so to speak). Whengan trees deal with this by using a wind-born
seed/spore distribution method that tends to keep individual plants of the same
species fairly distant from one another, except for certain species, like
non-fruit-bearing trees, which soak themselves with a natural anti-fungal agent
(which is, unfortunately again, highly flamable, making the trees a poor choice
of building materials).

The wind-born spores would probably reach a peak seasonly, thus the atmospheric
taint. For most of the year the air would be fine, but there\'s this two week
period every year and that just happened to be the time when the survey team
landed...

I didn\'t orginally envision any native animal life on Whenga, thus removing
mechanisms like using animals as seed carriers (via berries) as an option.

Using the chlorophyll virus in combination with all of that would make
a nice touch, preventing existing genetically engineered plants from
being imported (no RoundupReady canola!).

The final possibility is using plant-to-meat converters (i.e. cows) for which I
have no good defence. Maybe everything on Whenga is poisonous to cows too, I
dunno.  At any rate, the whole thig is just a handwave to explain why such an
otherwise nice planet is being wasted on casinos and grav-ball stadia.

Careless code recycling causes killer kangas --
Mutant Marsupials Take Up Arms Against Australian Air Force

The reuse of some object-oriented code had caused tactical headaches 
for Australia\'s armed
forces.  As virtual reality simulators assume larger roles in 
helicopter combat training,
programmers have gone to great lengths to increase the realism of 
their scenarios, including
detailed landscapes and -- in the case of the Northern Territory\'s 
Operation Phoenix -- herds
of kangaroos (since disturbed animals might well give away a 
helicopter\'s position).
  The head of the Defense Science & Technology Organization\'s 
LandOperations/Simulation division
reportedly instructed developers to model the local marsupials\' 
movements and reactions to
helicopters.  Being efficient programmers, they just re-appropriated 
some code originally
used to model infantry detachment reactions under the same stimuli, changed
  the mapped icon from a soldier to a kangaroo, and increased the 
figures\' speed of movement.
  Eager to demonstrate their flying skills for some visiting American 
pilots, the hotshot
Aussies "buzzed" the virtual  kangaroos in low flight during a simulation.
  The kangaroos scattered, as predicted, and the visiting Americans 
nodded appreciatively....then did a
double-take as the kangaroos reappeared from behind a hill and 
launched a barrage of Stinger
missiles at the helpless helicopter.  (Apparently the programmers had 
forgotten to remove
THAT part of the infantry coding.)
The lesson? Objects are defined with certain attributes, and any new 
object defined in terms of an old one inherits all the attributes. 
The embarrassed programmers had learned to be careful when reusing 
object-oriented code, and the Yanks left with a newfound respect for 
Australian wildlife.

Simulator supervisors report that pilots from that point onward have 
strictly avoided
kangaroos, just as they were meant to.

I certainly agree that really nasty warfare (salting fields, genocide,
nucs, rocks, etc.) requires de-humanization of one\'s enenmy. And I\'d agree
that the Crusades were a fine example of this.  But I\'d question whether
the Crusades were the first example.  What about Carthage, for example?

I would tend to agree with you; that\'s why I mentioned that it was what he
said.  But I can\'t remember what Carthage was about... it\'s being one of
those days at work, and the period of history I know best begins with
Julius Caesar and ends with the Enlightenment, at least as far as Europe
is concerned.  =)  Forgive my space brain and tell me if there was an
ideological component to Carthage or if it was one of those hundreds of
years of ethnic hatred due to close competition things.

While I might agree that most early wars were fought over territory, there\'s nothing about a war over territory which prevents it from also involving dehumanization of the enemy -- look at the Balkans.  That\'s basically a conflict over territory.

As evidence for the degree to which ancient societies considered one another human or subhuman, I\'d probably take a look at the cultures who were fond of enslaving other groups.  That one seems to go back about as far as any records can be found.

Enslavement doesn\'t mean that you think of your enemies as subhuman,
especially the older forms of slavery that aren\'t based on race or other
easily identifiable characteristics.  (Americans in particular get
confused about this because American slaves were black in a mostly white
country, which made it intellectually easier to think of them as a
different species.  Even so, they were still treated as people in many
households.  One or two slaves who lived with the family was much more
common than vast plantations, and even on vast plantations, not everyone 
was Simon Legree.)

Among the Romans, the Norse and many other peoples, slavery made you part
of a household.  

Since the master of a household in Rome had the right of life or death
over everyone in it anyway, slavery basically only made you transferable
property and also affected your civil rights outside of the household.  
Many slaves were regarded as part of the family and people looked down
upon those who abandoned or mistreated old slaves who could no longer
work.  

I\'m not saying that slavery is OK, but when close ties continued past
manumission, as happened with many freedmen and women in some of these
cultures, and there were clearly emotional as well as legal bonds-- I
think that slavery of the sort prevalent in the ancient world cannot
really be regarded in the same light as death camps, concentration camps,
rape camps, "comfort women", nuclear warfare, and other atrocities.  

It\'s wrong, but it\'s a different kind of wrong.  Making someone peel your
potatoes, become your concubine (different from being repeatedly brutally
gangraped and then murdered), hoe your fields, etc is rather different
from cutting them up in bizarre experiments, dashing their children\'s
brains out in front of them, or loading them into ovens or gas chamber
"showers".  Slaves get to live, get treated as people even if not with the
same rights, and sometimes even get freed.  Many slaves were even loved
after a fashion by their masters, though the slave did not always return
such feelings.  And while slaves were often beaten and occasionally killed
in these times, so were wives and children.  People in those eras had a
different idea of what it meant to be a human being, which did not
include immunity to corporal punishment or the right to make your own
decisions conferred absolutely somewhere between age 16 and age 25
regardless of gender, birth order, or economic situation.

None of this is intended as a moral justification for slavery.  But if you
had a choice, you\'d be better off as a slave in an ancient household than
you would be in Dachau.  Commodifying people is not the same as completely
dehumanizing them, and commodification was almost never absolute in the
ancient world because people had to spend too much time together in
households not to think of each other as human beings.

Are their any cultures in your TU that practice slavery?  Do you believe
that slavery is economically unworkable after a culture reaches a certain
TL?  I am curious as to how people have dealt with this issue.  I am sure
that there\'s no slavery in the 3I, but what about other places?  Traveller
is really a space opera, and slavery is prevalent in lots of those.

MONGO NATIONAL GUARD FLEES IN TERROR!!
Zhodanis occupy capital
Ming the Merciless Missing

182-1107 -- Jewell/Jewell/Spinward Marches

Years of tense and uneasy peace along the Imperium\'s
spinward border gave way to war last week, as Zhodani
forces launched a massive invasion of the
JewellCluster.  

In the worst fighting, Zhodani fleet elements,
believed to belong to the 40th and 65th Fleets,
bombarded defense forces on Mongo for more than ten
hours before several divisions of Zhodani troops
landed over fierce resistance at the downport.  Once
the Zhodani troops were on the ground, however, the
Mongo National Guard\'s morale crumbled and it soon
ceased to exist as a coherent unit.  The Mongo Armored
Battalion stood its ground, but was wiped out to the
last vehicle with heavy loss of life, during a
desperate holding action at the palace.  

Ming the Merciless, ruler of Mongo for over seventy
years, is reported to have gone into hiding somewhere
on-planet.  A holovid broadcast over the airwaves
before surrender showed Ming in full battle regalia
promising to carry on the fight from guerrilla bases. 
"I know more about Zhodani methods than an Imperial
baron should," he stated, "that\'s why I was sent to
rule this distant, forsaken rock.  Nivrnditlas\'s
troops will not have an easy time here." (Nivrnditlas
is a Zhodani admiral, but TNS was unable to confirm
whether he is attached to the 40th or 65th Fleets.)

In other action, Zhodani fleets annihilated Emerald\'s
defense forces by bombardment, but curiously did not
land any troops.  Ruby and Nakege fell to overwhelming
Zhodani forces after offering token resistance.  

Imperial spokespersons on Jewell, speaking on
condition of anonymity, stated that appropriate
countermeasures are being taken, and noted that,
contrary to Zhodani propaganda, no insurgent forces,
such as the mysterious Ine Givar, have risen to
support the invasion.

I haven\'t really bothered to address the issue.  In general, I assume that its closer to the modern mold, which means sweatshop labor and company towns.  Of course, \'evil oppressive alien races\' could do whatever seemed appropriate.

It was essentially a dispute over territory. The Phonecian-decended
Carthaginians had a wealthy trade empire, and Rome, as an expansionist
power, wanted in on that action. Sicily, Spain, and North Africa were all
in dispute.

There is little evidence that there were higher-than-normal ethnic tensions
involved, and none at all of religious dispute, AFAIK.

The razing of Carthage and the salting of the ground seemed to have as much
to do with revenge for Hannibal Barca\'s long rampage in the Roman homeland
as anything else.

IMHO, greed tends to be the biggest factor in why wars get started, with
ideologies providing a convienient rationalization to justify the cause.

True.  But they weren\'t much more humane to members of their own peoples,
often.   At least not the Assyrians or the Aztecs.  Assyria was a terrible
place to be born female.  

The Egyptians were somewhere in the middle and slavery among any of these
peoples cannot really be compared to what is going on in Bosnia, Rwanda,
or what was practiced during WWII.

Rome actually was a pretty good place to live throughout most of its
history; it gets a bad rap due to Sunday School stories, but Christianity
was one of the few religions it *DIDN\'T* tolerate and that was because the
Christians were actively campaigning against the gov\'t-- Rome ignored
religion except when it interfered with government and only ever really
got seriously into oppressing three religions:  Zoroastrianism, Druidism
and Christianity.  They even gave the Jews an exemption from worshipping
the Emperor once they understood that the Jews were monotheists who
weren\'t going to bother other people.

Rome is a very good model for a benevolent Empire at any tech level.
Except for the little problem of having the army pick the Emperors, LOL.

Heheheheh.  I expect that\'s the usual.  I just recall being surprised to
see slavery in "The Phantom Menace".  Usually people don\'t mention it much
any more, even though it fits in with the type of culture that universe
had.

I have run Traveller in the universe where my novels are set and there are
several slave-owning cultures, and several non-slave-owning cultures
(which sets things up perfectly for those nasty atrocity-filled
ideological wars...)

Carthage was being encouraged to join the Roman Empire. Carthage refused.
No big deal... take \'em by force, think the romans, who then get embarrased
by over 10 years of constant fighting with Carthage\'s Armies. In the middle
of this, at one point, the roman army broke and ran, so some higher-up
decided they "Needed steel in their backs", and so one in 10 legionaires
recieved a hot iron enema, aimed along the spine.

So, when Carthage finally falls, they line up the men, kill one in 10 (mind
you, these are from the survivors of the capture), Declare 1 in 10 of the
women to be  unpaid prostitutes, Declare the rest to be non-citizens, and
till the fields with enough salt that it took over 1000 years before
saltwater grasses would take. "New Carthage" is some 20 miles from the
original.

The key word here is \'commodifying\'. They were worth something, in many
cases, worth quite a lot. People own horses, oxen, dogs, they, well,
they provide living space and food for cats ;-) Slaves were viewed in
much the same way...a good slave was worth a heck of a lot, and it was
stupid to mistreat them, same as it is to mistreat a good horse...it
makes them worth less. 

Enslaving people because they are part of the untermenschen (sp, I\'m
sure), as the Nazis did, is another kettle of fish. They were seen as
disposable, worthless, but you might get some use out of them before
they wore out and were thrown away, which was the ultimate goal anyway.
The Nazi\'s were hell bent on exterminating those they found to be
subhuman, but they were also pragmatic to a germanic fault...why waste
good labor while you had it?

Chattel slavery, \'people as property\' is specifically outlawed as an
Imperial Crime. Curiously, this does not seem to include indentured
servitude.

I\'m sure that there are any number of Megacorps who are happy to provide
their workers with all their needs at the company store, housing them in
the company quarters, schooling them in the company schools....charging
them a little bit more than they make all the while...

\'...another day older and deeper in debt...\'

The difference between this and chattel slavery is pretty much mere
window dressing. 
While the law forbids passing the parent\'s debt on to their children, a
particularly callous megacorp might well charge the children, not their
parents for schooling, medical care, etc, so they hit 18 with an
unmanageable debt to start with.

I wrote a T4-era adventure around a world where indentured servitude =
chattel slavery. It was set outside the Imperium, but could easily occur
somewhere inside, depending on how devious the megacorp execs are.

http://www.u.arizona.edu/~bjohnson/slavers_of_gennare.txt

(A prettier version of this is on Freelance Traveller.)

Slavery is only workable when you have something that needs human labor,
rather than machine labor to do it. Robot work 3 shifts, no
lunch/coffee/potty breaks, no life support is necessary, no pesky worker
safty rules apply, they\'re pretty much immune to unionization.

I don\'t think it\'s very workable on a mass industrial scale.

On an agricultural one, well that depends greatly on how cheap robots
are.

As household servants, OTOH, slavery will be practical as long as rich
people are lazy. However, that is a vanishingly small segment of the
workplace.

OTGH, lots and lots of people will be contract laborers, blue and white
collar, and the Company will own their contracts. If you have no choice
but to work for Eneri\'s Widget Works until Eneri decides to release you
from your contract, what again is the difference between that and
slavery?

That was the basis for the MLB players association successful suit to
allow free agency by the baseball players; it reached the Supreme Court,
and the (then) existing system of player contracts was overturned on
14th amendment grounds, as being equivalent to slavery.

Well, they also evicted the Jews from Palestine, but that\'s because the Jews were apparently the inventers of middle eastern terrorism.

It\'s a nice idea, but it\'s about as practical as trying to start a big
lump of anthracite (hard coal) on fire with a match.

"Protium" (H1) requires *much* higher temperatures and pressures than
deuterium or D-T mixtures. As I recall we are talking *orders of
magnitude* higher (10 to 100 times).

On the other hand, there are reactor designs being looked at that
*don\'t* require high temp and high pressure. But they tend to require
rather *large* reactors.

space is to be American-made, that\'s not common sense in my humble

Three options for what to do when things don\'t match: (i) accept it, (ii)

There wasn\'t any significant ideological component, AFAIK. It was 
simply a matter of finishing off the job. Mind you it took a fair bit 
of stirring by rabid anti-Carthage senator, etc to get the Third Punic 
War rolling, and I suspect that the agitators were probably those who 
stood to profit most.

However for an even earlier example that (arguably) wasn\'t economic or 
territorial I submit the Persian Wars. They were largely fought on the 
(mainland) Greek side out of a belief that Greeks were superior to 
everyone else, and therefore should be under Persian domination. Of 
course once the Ionian Greeks started to actually succeed in their 
mainland assisted revolts the Persians turned it into an invasion of 
mainland Greece.

Considering how much is Russian (once Soviet) tech, Russian \'ships\', 
Russian personnel and most definitely Russian experience and expertise

    'body' => 'Who says Imperial culture is Western?

If the archaeologists/anthropologists/whatevers are right,
human culture didn\'t put any value on the human at all
until around 2000 BC (with, of all people, Abraham).
It was with certain Semitic peoples in Mesopotamia that
developed the idea that the person was worth something;
from there we have the birth of "Western" civilization.  The
older ways hung around as well, and gave rise to Eastern
thought, though there is a mix of East and West in each
of us now due to the cross-pollination of ideas over time.

The old ideology commanded us to accept the inevitable,
dance with the wheel of life... the world of the ascetic or
the fatalist.  The Western ideology is a bit more intrusive,
I think, with the idea that each person is an individual, with
value, and that struggle is meaningful, time is linear, etc etc.

On all human empires there will be swaths of competing
ideology, over history, work, wealth, rights, etc.

IMTU there are ideologies that come with each culture.
Cultural regions IMTU follow these rules of thumb:

Interior: Cultures are gathered in subsector- and sector-
wide regions (see the MegaTraveller books).  Some allowances
and prohibitions are valid for the entire region.  Expect local
corporate offices to be staffed significantly by locals, who
follow their culture.  Also expect a vocal minority of
protesters to oppose the seemingly arbitrary and unfair
cultural biases inherent in the culture.  Activist will call for
change.  Money will exchange hands, and political fortunes
will be won and lost.  People will die, and will either be
hailed as heroes or conveniently forgotten.

Interior cultural borders: On the borders of two cultural regions,
ideology will be an interesting, sometimes conflicting blend of the
cultures.  Expect there to be sporadic violence and terrorism.
Don\'t expect there to be full-blown war, because of the Imperial
Marines.  However, you can bet yer boots that some corporations
have "tradewars" more for cultural reasons than economic ones.
People will die, and will either further polarize the factions at
each others\' throats or will be forgotten.

Frontier worlds on the X-boat route: Expect these cultures to be
related to other cultures which were grafted to the boondocks
from the interior.   An important world will spread its culture
to neighboring worlds, and a cluster of important worlds will
probably have the same culture... or a few antagonistic ones.

Frontier worlds off the X-boat route: Cultures will vary wildly from
planet to planet, and even continent to continent.  Expect wealthy
worlds to have influence over their neighbors.  However, the frontier is
where you\'ll find all the fringe groups, off the X-boat routes.

Nope. Doesn\'t match the photos. For that size, and the size of the
central trench, relative to the diameter of the DS, when we get to the
shot where the trench almost fills the screen, the hangar bay wouldn\'t

And you\'ve got the problem of this thing having a significant gravity
field. Which means that the stresses on the frame are going to be unreal.

My figures say 20 miles diameter, tops.
Based on using freeze frame on the video, and measuring the relative
size of:

        diameter of Death Star:width of central trench
       width of central trench:heighth of hangar bay entrance
heighth of hangar bay entrance:thickness of Millenium Falcon

On the other hand, try sitting down and figuring the output for a PAW
20 miles long. Actually, given what we see in the film, make that *six*
of them.

A superpower in contemporary times means a nation that
can effectively exert its will anywhere in the world
in a very short time, without any other power\'s
cooperation.  The United States is presently the only
nation with that capability.

In the Far Future, a superpower would have to able to
exert its will anywhere in known space in a very short
time, without any other power\'s cooperation.  Given
distances and travel capabilities, no power can be a
true superpower.  

Local regions may experience two or more great powers
as pseudo-superpowers, who have to be considered in
taking any action, but that still doesn\'t rise to the
level of one-world superpower capability.  

Another key difference between the recent past and the
Far Future is that no one in the Far Future has a real
and immediate ability to destroy all life everywhere.

Well, it\'s an actual game of Fifth Frontier War (a map

campaign.

They would eventually. But you can slow it down a bit by requiring
visiting ships to dump their "sludge" tanks. You can do even better if
you have the ships hauling grain one way haul "sludge" the other way.
Hi-pop planets are going to have an *awfully* large amount of the stuff
to treat. Enough that doing *minimal* treatment and loading it into the
food ships for the return run may make sense.

Dr. Jerry Pournelle, in _King David\'s Spaceship_, points out that the
horse collar eventually led to the end of human slavery as a routine
institution.  [Note:  Figures used are from _KDS_.]  Before the horse
collar was invented, a horse could do the work of five human slaves,
because the harnesses in use at the time would strangle the horse if you
had it pull too much.  Since a horse also eats about as much as five
human slaves, human slave labor is reasonably attractive.  However, once
the horse collar was invented, a horse could do the work of _ten_ human
slaves, while still eating as much as five human slaves.  Given the
obvious economic benefit of using horses for heavy work (twice as much
work per unit of food), slavery becomes more rare, and is generally
imposed on peoples thought of as inferior.  Once the Industrial
Revolution began, slavery became even less viable economically, as
machines began to replace human labor in many fields.

Thus, S.M. Stirling\'s Domination of the Draka notwithstanding, I would
not expect to see chattel slavery in a semi-rational technological
civilization.

It\'s happened, and it will most likely happen again (and again). It seems
like you\'re assuming a modern American apathetic dynamic. There are
astonishing examples in World War II, for example.

Ask me that later if I\'m particularly surly with regard to the American
government, it\'ll help if I am part of a separatist movement.

I don\'t think that they\'re as rare as you think. Vietnam (particularly apt,
actually), Afghanistan... I can be here all day composing a list, and that
would only focus on those after 1900 or so.

I never said that *every* world would want to leave the Imperium, nor that
every world that wants to leave will be commited. However, I think that it
would be an eventuality that would happen, and would happen a number of
times within the Imperium. After all, there are many, many worlds within the
Imperium.

Remember, the Imperium looks the other way with regard to the plight of
worlds ruled by brutal regimes every day. It\'s going to be obvious to
somebody that the Imperium *could* do something and chooses not to as long
as the taxes are coming in. Give such a scenario, I don\'t know, one or two
or six centuries and you\'re going to have people who have more than just a
little dislike for the Imperium.

Toss in the submerged cultural regions, which were at one time multi-world
polities with long histories and (presumably) proud traditions, and which
were brought into the Imperium by force.

If what you\'re saying is true, the Japanese could never have isolated
themselves to the extent that they did. Incidentally, that isolation ended
when the American Navy threatened to come back in a year and start
bombarding the country.

Actually, after the West made their way to Asia and started trying to pawn
off their shiny baubles the Asians frequently pulled inward and tried to
isolate themselves. Some were successful, some were not.

It is an important distinction to make. After all, you\'re saying that unless
you have less than 999 people (a pop code of 2, if I recall correctly)
you\'re not going to be able to get any agreement. Not all worlds are
canonically participatory democracies, and we\'re talking about all sorts of
different cultures with differing degrees of collective self-consciousness.

If you\'ll pardon my saying so, that\'s an awfully shallow view. Charismatic
dictators are not mesmers. They do not suddenly shift populations with their
stunning rhetoric. They are charismatic because they are a product of the
culture that they are making their appeals to. Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m not
saying that their actual *presence* doesn\'t matter. I\'m just saying that it
goes far deeper than that. Ideologies, on the other hand, are not simply
born overnight.

They accrete and develop over the course of long decades, even centuries.
Let\'s keep going with the Nazi example. It\'s a good one. You kill the
adherents. How do you find the adherents? There were hundreds of thousands
of German citizens who had no qualms about going out and killing Jews. There
were members of police and para-military groups who sent back pictures of
dead Jewish Poles - women and children and old folks - in the streets to
their wives and children back home.

There have been anthropological and sociological studies done which seem to
strongly point the finger not at any one leader, nor any one group of people
(indeed, those who participated in the really nasty and atrocious acts were
a decent cross section of the German populace), nor any general moral
breakdown on the part of the German people it was the result of a long
process and includes philosophy, religious development, folklore, political
movements, outside influences, and many, many other factors.

In other words, how do you figure out who adheres to an ideology and who
doesn\'t?

Not at all. After all, rocks are cheap, battle-dress, grav tanks and trained

So what you\'re saying is that nailing, say, a city of 10,000, at no danger
to the Imperium, is going to be different from entering into a ground war
that could have many, many more casualties and could cost the Imperium a
hell of a lot more?

Fair enough, but do you honestly think that bribing Hitler, or Lenin, or
Castro would have succeeded? Do you think that Hitler would have been
interested in money?

Besides, we don\'t need to speculate. There were many attempts to get Japan
to open up to trade after they closed themselves off. When China tried to
close itself off from imperialist Britain, they probably would have
succeeded. The only problem was that Britain resorted to nasty tricks in
order to keep up the trade, tricks that were, at least in my estimation, at
least as bad as nailing a population center or two.

Well, no, it doesn\'t have to be either the peasants or the leaders. It can
be both, and the reasons can be deeply rooted in the culture of the people
on the world.

Fair enough, although I\'m not sure that anybody *really* follows "civilized
rules of war" these days. Folks tend to avoid the nukes, chem and bio
weapons simply because they know that the situation will most likely
escalate to the point that they\'d be wiped off the face of the earth.

Yep. No doubt.

Nope, the Imperium only needs to do it a couple of times to prove that

Um... Okay, sure. In one case the war wasn\'t over until the infantry
occupied the country, in the other the war was over before the infantry
occupied the country. You\'ll have to excuse me when I say it sounds like
you\'re trying to have your cake and eat it too.

>I\'m sorry but the infrastructures of both countries were destroyed by

Actually, no. It\'s not closer in spirit to what I\'m talking about. I\'m not
talking about strategic bombing in any way, shape or form. I\'m talking about
the use of terror weapons. Two entirely different things.

What do you think happens when you let loose the battle-dress marines and
the grav tanks? Do you think the infrastructure of the country remains
intact? Do you think that the Imperium will avoid nailing strategic targets?

So, no. Strategic bombing is not what I\'m talking about here, not in any
way, shape or form.

>Also. The point I was trying to make is that we forestalled another war by
>A) Physically occupying both countries with large forces.


I\'m fine with the occapation angle, actually, considering the fact that
after the war was over the job of the infantry was no longer taking ground.
Would you consider what the Americans did in Japan after their surrendered
was "fighting a land war"? Same with Germany. Same with Kosovo right now.

It\'s something of a moot point anyway, because... (scroll down)

...the difference with rock dropping is that you don\'t *really* damage the

industrial and military infrastructure of that city is *gone*. Poof. Not
there to rebuild in the first place.

Compare that to the effects of a ground war, in which you\'re going to have
to destroy the enemy\'s industrial capacity if you want them to stop
fighting.

People forgive and forget pretty quickly. Even ground wars can end with the
same kind of feelings that you\'re talking about. Take Germany\'s position at
the end of World War I, for example.

I\'m not quite familiar enough to deal with the American revolution, so I
will just deal with the French case.

Basically, the peasants provided the bulk of the force behind the
revolution, along with the urban masses, the sans-culottes.  This is for
the good and simple reason that the peasants were the _overwhelming_
majority of the French population.

"Elite" revolts that face opposition need mass support, or they will fail.

You don\'t, of course, get wars that are fought for just one reason.  But
still:

Enter the Taiping Rebellion!   

The second bloodiest war in human history was fought in China between 1851
and 1864.  The body count has been estimated at around 30 million or so. 
The Taipings\' central leader considered himself the younger brother of
Jesus.  

Yes, there was a lot more to it than "just" religion, but that\'s true of
every "religious" war.

Look, there\'s just no way I\'m going to touch this stuff.  Let\'s declare it

Yes & no. There are some feuding GTL6 superpowers on Singer (0940 District 268)
in the Spinward Marches. Strictly speaking, though, they\'re not part of the
Imperium. They are an independant system, as are most of those in the district.
However, they ARE looked after by the Imperium and will eventual join the
empire.

Singer is THE place to go if you want to play in the RW(tm) circa 1960\'s.
The government is, like, 28 countries with various alliances, all fighting.
One of them just took over a major land mass in the northern hemisphere.
Just think of it as post WWII with the serial numbers filed off.
PC\'s can try out their "I could rule the world if only..." scenarios.
Speaking of which... any chance we could go there David? (GM Hint).

(Interestingly, Singer only became amber zoned and at war in GURPS.
Prior to that it was more nondescript. I guess someone changed it
into a more interesting playground to base adventures in.)

	I thought they used a powder charge atop the upper hemisphere to

This isn\'t particularly logical but it makes for better gaming.

Generally okay, but Marc Miller is about to reprint Books 7 & 8 in a 
new volume.

Go to BITS website http://www.bits.org.uk/ and go to the jumpsite page.

1) Look at Hyphen\'s pages (Beowulf Down or Tavonni Down) as this has 
a lot of background library data and also copies of Marcs comments.

2) Look at Downport.com as this has a lot of material and may include 
the copyright statement. You can get to Freelance Traveller from here 
too.

3) Look at Marc Miller\'s site - FarFuture Enterprises - for details 
on the reprints and possibly photocopying.

Absolutely.

And also by \'At Close Quarters\' also written by Doug and to be 
published by BITS in the immediate future. This is a set of rules for 
running more detailed combat built around the task system *and* 
penguins.

        Hi, Josh...  I\'m sorry, a "rock" is not a "pin-point" weapon any
more than the Hiroshima bomb was.  When you start generating yields in the
hundreds of tons range for HE, that isn\'t pin-point.  In _Cyberpunk 2020_,
there is a set of source books where two major corporations are using
Ortillery strikes on each other\'s skyscrapers...  the dropped round is about
the size and shape of a crowbar...  its worth a few tons of HE on impact....
enough to collapse a sky-scraper in on itself and that\'s about it.  That\'s
about as pin-point as you can get, and its still going to not be as
effective as any competant air-defense grid....
        Besides, the its just lucky for the Centarii that the Narns didn\'t
have c-sec ranged thermonuclear silos on the planet, or that rock-dropping
excercise would have been a *heck* of a lot less lop-sided.  Rock-dropping,
or any other form of orbital bombardment is *very* reliant on your target
being helpless...

Which is why you don\'t want to launch an all out planetary assault on it.
You want the starport intact for after the war, so you pull the defending
forces away from the port before engaging them. Now, you can can do what
the Russians did in Afganistan and grab the starport before anyone knows
you\'re coming, that\'s a different story.

I thought it was the second Death Star that was 120 km? IIRC, someone
worked it out using the amount that the hull curved in relation to the
length of the command ship that crashed into the DS in ROTJ.

Either way, the novelization of ROTJ said that the second DS was twice the
size of the original. Of course, it doesn\'t say if that size is being
measured in diameter or volume.

        I would disagree with your assessment.  The Vargr are driven by a
requirement to boost thier own standing with other Vargr (thier Charisma).
*Any* idiot pink-stink can drop a rock on a world and say "Gimme money or
I\'ll do it again"....  that isn\'t going to do *anything* for one\'s
Charisma...  no bravery, no bold action, no fears faced nose-on....  
        A planetary assault or a boarding of a high-port on a snatch and
grab, or a pack raiding an Imperial  convoy... now, that is a *whole*

personal, and your friends have to survive to be impressed and brag you up
to thier friends.  That is why the Vargr seem so fragmented into such

That\'s $28, plus shipping to UK at about $10....  still a bargain, though,

The _Starship Operations Manual_ (SOM) was written for MegaTraveller as
a fairly comprehensive description of how things work on a starship.  It
was published by Digest Group Publications (DGP), not GDW (the
importance of this becomes clear in the next paragraph).

To get a copy, you need to find someone willing to part with a used
copy, since SOM has been out of print for about ten years, and the
current copyright holder of DGP materials is not as understanding as
Marc Miller concerning photocopying out-of-print material for
Traveller.  (If you read the TML for a while, you\'ll find that most
people express their opinion of Roger Sanger <spit> more pungently than
I have.)

By the same token though, any idiot pink-stink can, say, point a gun, or do

*specific* sorts of "heroic" actions were required for Vargr Charisma.

Besides,  I thought that the Aslan were supposed to be the honorable ones.

Again, I\'m not sure I\'ve come away from Traveller sources with the same idea
of Vargr that you have. Keep in mind, I\'m not saying that they\'re drooling
evil nasties just waiting to drop rocks on any planet that they get the
chance to drop rocks on, which has been one of the dangers I\'ve become quite
conscious of over the course of this discussion.

Actually, a big part of my understanding of Vargr comes from my research
into the Sioux and the lower echelons of the New York mafia of the 70s (via
the book Donnie Brasco).

>Who says Imperial culture is Western?


I always assumed that Imperial culture had some basis in Western culture
because the lingua franca of the Imperium is galactic anglic / galanglic,
the noble titles are taken from the Western tradition, and, most importantly
that the Imperium is firmly rooted in the genre of "libertarian sci-fi" with
its emphasis on merchant and mercenary style games.

Your own mileage may vary.

In my own Traveller Universe (the "Petty States" universe) the Interstellar
Wars were a war of words and ideas as much as soldiers and spaceships. The
assumption I\'m working with is that the Vilani tradition and way of life was
forced on the worlds of the Ziru Sirka. This view of the Ziru Sirka as
pretty much homogenous isn\'t really at odds with canon. The Terrans found
that information warfare, and I mean that in the truest possible sense of
the word, was extremely effective in getting individual worlds and systems
to shrug off Vilani rule.

Only one problem: Due to the fact that the Terrans rushed into the war, and
that Terra was still more or less balkanized, the ideas that made it to the
stars were not always compatible. In addition the manner in which different
cultures integrated these new Terran ideas into their own cultures was
frequently surprising. There were heavily Vilanified worlds with deeply
submerged cultures, for example.

The economic decline of the Second Imperium was hastened as a result of all
of this turmoil. That\'s where my own timeline diverges. The Long Night is a
period of wars, Renaissances, Enlightenments, Cultural Revolutions,
uprisings, insurrections, etc...

The Sylean Federation forms, turns into the Third Imperium... but the task
of taming the stars is considerably more difficult than Cleon thought it
would be. He discovers he doesn\'t have a monopoly on grand visions of
interstellar unity.

I\'m still working out the history and the details, but the end result (circa
1107 or so) is that there are quite a few distinct interstellar states bound
together in a web of alliances, treaties and obligations. Think of the world
on the eve of World War I...

Yep, I pretty much threw the Third Imperium out the window, because I\'m
starting to think that even without Terran intervention an interstellar
empire the size of the Imperium would be nigh-unto impossible to maintain,
or even attain in the first place. I\'m only adding in the Terran
intervention to provide some degree of familiarity for the sake of my Terran
players.

That\'s not to say that the familiarity will always be to their benefit. ;)

In communicating ideas and concepts between different cultures, there\'s
frequently some degree of "packet loss", if you get my meaning. Imagine
knowing how to read German, but not knowing how to read it very well. Now
imagine reading Hegel in German and explaining the philosophy to some
high-school student from a completely different culture who knows only a
little English and and who has had no introduction to, say, the philosophy
of Kant.

"So, what you\'re saying is that Hegel saw this Napoleon fellow on a horse
and exclaimed that he must be some sort of time-demon?"

Actually in real life and in Traveller, governments do not have to fall. If a
government fails to change however, then it is invetable to collapse.
</generalisation>

Take the Catholic Church. It started as a fringe cult from Judea, then an
underground movement, then a state religion, then a pan-state religion, then a
state itself (while exercising power on a global scale), then to a non-dominant
religious organisation.

Thus it has survived since around 30AD to today, approximately 2,000 years. It
is now a form that Joshua of Nazereth
would not reconise , but it is the same organsiation that Peter sets up.

England is another example. The Monarchy has managed to cope with all maners of
problems, from open insurection to devoloution of power to parlement.

Both managed to survive due to the ability to change.

The Vilani is also a good example. When the First Imperium began to impose
statis on the empire, it was doomed. It was unable to stop change, and was
usable to cope with change, so the system begins to collapse when it is faced
with crisis it can not cope with (Vagr and Terra).

There are still governments that still excist from antiquety (Tonga, Thialand,
Mouri tribes). Yet well designed systems have collapsed (Communism was really
well set up, just porly managed).

This is not correct: the Geneva Convetion of 1949, and
the addtional two Protocols of 1977, specifically
stated that violations by one party to the conflict
did not absolve the other party or parties of the
responsibility to follow these conventions and
protocols. In other words you can\'t say, "but he did
it first!" 
The reason for this is obvious: it would make the
conventions meaningless, since everybody can always
pull up some example of the enemy having done
something wrong first, therefore nobody could ever be
held responsible. Secondly, restraint or atrocities by
one side will encourage the other to behave similarly.
A good example is the Germans in WWII: they in general
treated the Allied soldiers well, and that treatment
was returned (the massacre of Americans at Malmedy and
so on being easily matched by Allied actions); they
treated the Soviets horrifically, and as a
consequence, of the two million Germans captured by
the Soviets, only 10,000 came back, and they were not
released until 1955.
You _don\'t_ have the right to reprisals in current
international law. You have the right to seek
prosecution. (Which rarely happens, but that\'s another
story!)

Not an ideological war, really.  The Romans were just very good at making
sure than when they put you down, you *stayed* down.

of sealed container A, making sure that the container

The foregoing was inspired by an article in the
current issue of Treasures, the magazine of San
Francisco\'s Asian Art Museum, from which I quote:

"Most exhibitions require couriers to accompany the
objects as they make their trip from one venue to
another, and amking arrangements for them is a big
undertaking.  Couriers (who are usually curators,
conservators, or registrars [but might be gun-toting
ex-spooks --GMG]) must be prepared to spend long
periods away from home.  For Golden Age, a delegation
of more than twenty people from China will stay with
the entire exhibition, rotating in teams, with each
group staying four to five weeks -- this is a
significant exhibition expense.  It is up to the
registrars to find accommodations for them, to provide
translators if needed, andto arrange library access
and educational and leisure activities.

"During transit, the couriers must never lose sight of
the objects:  they must be present when objects are
packed and unpacked, they have to ride in the truck
carrying the object to the plane or one following it,
they have to ride in the same plane as the objects ...
and they have to be present for the loading and
unloading.  Forrest McGill recalls couriering a single
ceramic to an exhibition in Miho, Japan, which
required him to go thirty hours without sleep."

We should remember to distinguish between bourgeois
revolutions, like the English Civil War, the American
Revolution, and the French Revolution, and poor
peoples\' revolutions, like the Revolustions of Russia
(1917), China (1949), and Cuba (1959), and perhaps
some of the 1848 uprisings in Europe (and the Commune
of Paris).  (The far off topic question:  Do we
consider Russia 1985, and China since Deng Xiaoping to
be bourgeois revolutions?)  

Every revolution requires mass support to topple the
existing structure.  Who can get and keep that mass
support is the interesting question.

Strange though it may be, both sides in a war normally do play by the rules.
(Though when they don\'t is when things get *interesting*).
It\'s hard to describe why, except in vague terms, but think of it this way:

Actions have consequences.
Some consequences are undesirable.
Therefore your possible actions are limited.

The goal you are trying to achieve in combat precludes you from using
certain actions and tactics. For example, if you are trying to capture a
factory you would not use a nuke on the forces defending it. It would
destroy them but also prevent you from achieving your objective. So,
as a consequence, your actions tend to fit within what we loosely
call the "rules of warfare". The "rules" are not so much arrived at
by sitting down in a committee, but by what actions don\'t give
unfavourable outcomes.

Similarly on a strategic level, your ultimate goal will constrain what
lengths you can go to to achieve it. Read Clausewitz. Politics and the
military are intertwined. Political goals are behind all combat. Why
doesn\'t the IRA assassinate the queen? Because the *political*
consequences of that act would be undesirable for the IRA.

Now, though the various interstellar civilizations may have different
views about things they have many similar goals. Like survival.
Colonization. So, the technology and tactics used might be alien
but the objectives would be similar.

Now, as to why near-c rocks don\'t get used in the Traveller universe
more often I have a simple answer.

Control.

No commander likes to have weapons under his command that he can\'t control.
Near-c rocks are about as uncontrolled as you can get. They take weeks
to prepare, can\'t be directed at small targets, and have an unpredictable
area of effect (because bits flake off before impact, the rock might
explode when it hits the atmosphere, etc). Worst of all for any commander,
once sent they cannot be recalled. Just as the poor sods you point it at
cannot stop it, eventually neither can you. If they surrender unconditionally
before impact, or you find they have something you need intact, or the
EMPEROR calls off the attack you *can\'t* do anything about it. You are no
longer in control of your own weapon.

No commander would chose to be in such a position, and no politician would
LET the armed forces get into such a situation.

It\'s sorta like the plans for an automated response proposed during the
cold war, where computers were to launch missiles automatically. The
idea got nixed/changed to keep the humans in the loop, so that they
could still *decide* whether to go to nuclear war or not.

Now, I\'m not saying that near-c rocks *cannot* be used in Traveller.
I\'m just explaining why, *by choice*, they aren\'t used more often.

Yes, but royals always are incestuous, since no-one
else is good enough for them to marry. (Anyone seen
the family tree of Queen Victoria?) I\'d note that
while the Pharaoh might have been happily shagging his
sister, the commoners were a little more squeamish.

Then the ground you\'re standing on begins to get less firm, at least in my
opinion. I don\'t mean that in an insulting way, but drawing lines between
ideological wars and non-ideological wars begins to appear rather arbitrary.
Ultimately, there\'s always going to be some at least *some* element of
ideology in any war.

What I\'ve seen begin to happen when a line of thought like this is used is
that there is a difference between ideological warfare and warfare which is
intended to annex or hold territory, depending on the side. I\'m not saying
that there\'s anything wrong with that, but it opens up a whole new can of
worms.

I don\'t mind Women\'s History at all, in and of itself.

As I stated above, I find it kind of odd when people try to delineate
different sorts of wars. All wars have an ideological component, and
frequently ancient wars had ideological components that are invisible to us
moderns.

For example, the culture of the ancient Greeks was one that was literally
*awash* with competing ideologies, religions and philosophies, as was the
culture of the ancient Persians, for example. The Persians and the Greeks
were two cultures which had a real difficulty seeing eye to eye in general.

You\'re right, though, there were distinct differences in how they viewed
other groups of people.

To some extent. It depends on the culture or civilization. Even predating
the crusades, though, you had some really nasty warfare. There is
archeological evidence that quite a number of cities were rebuilt and
destroyed many times as a result of many wars. That\'s hardly in keeping with
the theory that ancient wars were simply fought to capture intact land. Make
of it what you will.

To switch continents, the American Indians fought some pretty nasty wars,
and some of the customs that different tribes and nations had toward
prisoners of war were pretty different. Once you get down into Central and
South America things get pretty odd as well. The same can be said of Africa.

Depends on the culture. Historical records tend to be all over the place
with regard to their treatment of the populace at large. Some wanted massive
armies of servants, some didn\'t.

I can see where you\'re coming from. Still, genocide on a large enough scale
to make the history books is really *most* viable with modern technology.

The enemy *always* gets "de-humanized" though. When the Greeks warred with
the Persians they felt pity for the Persians, but still felt that they were
superior to them. By the logic of the day, the Persians would have been just
like the Greeks had they, too, been lucky enough to live on land with harsh
soil.

They still weren\'t as *good* as the Greeks.

I\'m in agreement with Kiri, except for one thing, her
assertion that prior to the religious crusades of the
middle ages, wars were "mostly over territory." And
therefore didn\'t involve so many atrocities. While
respecting Kiri\'s degree in medieval history, I\'d like
to point her to ancient history, just one example for
teh sake of brevity: Alexander the Great. This
charming lad would show up and say, "surrender your
city or I will kill every last man woman and child in
it." If they fought, he would win, and then murder
everybody. Pretty soon, other cities started
surrendering first. 

Armies historically in all ages have killed far more
civilians than soldiers, mainly because the civilians
didn\'t fight back. It\'s a lot easier. And comitting
atrocities binds you together as a military unit, and
as a nation, and makes you less likely to surrender
("holy shit, what will they do to me if they catch
me?!") The most die-hard, no-surrender soldiers are
also the most murderous, comitting the most
atrocities. Atrocities are not a recent thing in
history, the idea of rules of war are. Though the germ
of the idea has long been there...

Atrocities exist because soldiers are human, and
because as a matter of policy, they often work. Of
course, sometimes they don\'t (egh all the jewish
scientists that fled europe and went and built the
bomb for the yanks instead of for the krauts, "woops,
nad idea hating the jews," says a kraut scientist in
August 1945)

We\'re talking about three different ways of valuing

"infinite value." Because lives are of infinite value,
we are imprisoned for murder, and so on; whereas were

Of course not. Otherwise, mortgages would be
prohibited. I am not joking here. You are legally
forced to work for the bank if capable. How does that
differ from a farmer in India? All that differs is
that it\'s necessary for the Indian to do it, or
starve, whereas for us it\'s just a case of wanting
things... we\'re still indentured, though.

Well, no, it\'s easy to explain why: all rules concerning modern warfare are
meant to stop the wars from escalating out of hand. You don\'t use nukes
because someone else out there has nukes and in a few hours you\'ve got a
really serious setback to modern civilization, to put it lightly.

After World War I, everybody was really horrified by how chemical weapons
had escalated out of hand. In World War II, interestingly enough, I can\'t
think of the use of chemical weapons on a large scale in World War II
(actually, I can\'t think of their use on a small scale either, but I\'m
hedging my bets here since there are quite a few people on the list with an
astonishing mind for detail) with the exception of the death camps, but the
dynamic was quite different from the battlefield.

>Actions have consequences.
>Some consequences are undesirable.
>Therefore your possible actions are limited.


Unfortunately, we\'re not talking about Earth here, where all of the
combatants are part of the same species *and* the same planet. The Aslan,
the Hivers, the K\'Kree are all radically different, psychologically.

Hell, if you accept TNE canon the Ithklur (the Hiver\'s pet troops) weren\'t
above *eating* the K\'Kree! ;)

The Vargr are at least descended from real dyed in the wool Terran
mammals... *but* on the other hand they can\'t really agree on anything as a
race, I\'m not sure why they would be able to agree on anything with folks
*outside* their race.

In the Imperium, the distinction is blurred between the Solomani and the
Vilani, although I think I recall that in canon the Vilani are all business
when it comes to warfare.

Finally, the Zhodani *already* use combat robots, which the Imperium hates.

On the other hand, if your objective is to destroy the troop concentration
around the factory... you\'d use the nuke. Or, if some particularly tasty
targets happened to be there, you might also use the nuke. So what?

The reason that we don\'t use nuclear weapons on earth is because using nukes
can very well result in the end of civilization for everyone with nukes.
Once the birds are in the air, say goodnight, Gracie.

It naturally follows that there must be some reason for not using really
heavy weapons in the Traveller universe, and it can\'t be the same. It\'s
handled internal to the Imperium by the Imperial rules of war.

Of course political goals are behind all combat. It\'s so obvious that it
goes without saying.

Again, so what? All you\'ve really said is that launching a nuke at a factory
when you want to acquire it isn\'t a good idea, and that politics happen to
be lurking behind warfare.

You\'ve managed to completely dodge the question you responded to, which
boils down to:

Why would rules against using big rocks be in place between interstellar
civilizations, but not energy ortillery which serves the same function and
can be just as damaging.

You *nearly* answer it at the end of the post, but you make an appeal to
practicality, which has nothing to do with the rules of war, concerning a
position which I don\'t even hold. More on that when you get down there.

Keep in mind we are talking about *technology* and *tactics* here.

I\'m very sorry, you must have me confused with someone else. I have never,
in this thread, nor any recent thread, referred to near-c rocks. I\'m not
talking about near-c rocks here. Keep that in mind as you read the rest of
my response where I ignore the prefix "near-c".

>No commander likes to have weapons under his command that he can\'t control.


Fine, but big rocks can be controlled with relative ease. This is a culture
which builds gigantic starships. Landing ships on the surface of a planet
is, literally, a routine task.

>Near-c rocks are about as uncontrolled as you can get. They take weeks
>to prepare,

Okay, they take weeks to prepare. All the more time for the planet to come
around and accept Imperial demands.

>can\'t be directed at small targets,

Actually, yes they can. The laws of physics tend to be pretty stable, and
Imperial ships tend to have really big computers. Still, depends on what
size you consider small. Big rocks are only practical for big stationary
things, like cities, towns, harbors, etc.

>and have an unpredictable

I\'m sure that a starfaring race can come up with a set of guidelines
concerning what types of rocks won\'t flake apart before impact, and what
ones aren\'t explosive.

>Worst of all for any commander,
>once sent they cannot be recalled.

That may be the case with near-c rocks, but it\'s not the case with big rocks
that aren\'t accelerated to such speeds.

In general, you only have to follow the laws of war if *all* your enemies

"International Law" and "the Requirements of Humanity", but some of
the more restrictive limits on such things as confiscating property,
handling POW\'s, or restricting collateral damage no longer apply.

Let\'s say A and B signed the treaties, and C didn\'t. If A and B have
a war, they are both obligated to follow the rules. If C has a war with
either A or B, no one is bound to follow the rules.

Here\'s the interesting part, though:
If A and B are having a war, and C allies with B against A, then
A no longer has to follow the rules - but B is still bound by them!!

ObTrav is a little fuzzy, as I don\'t expect these conventions to have
made it to the stars with the 2nd Imperium...but the odd side effects
treaties can have should make for some interesting plot twists.

My interpretation of the various Hague and Geneva conventions was
incorrect. While it is true that the involvement of even one belligerent
releases other belligerents from following the agreements, the
release from the agreements appears to apply to all belligerents
in the conflict, regardless of which side (or sides) they may be on.

I would expect that Pharaoh\'s wishes in the matter of his spouse were
entirely immaterial.  Like it or not, Pharaoh\'s duties included marrying
his sister.

This brings up an interesting ObTrav.  How are potential Imperial
spouses chosen?  Marriages of state (heirs of two royal families
marrying each other) seem unlikely, given that the two largest human
rival states to the 3I do not follow the Imperial model.   That leaves
the various noble families within the 3I.  If that\'s the case, then how
far down the nobility chain can a potential Emperor/Empress go to find
an acceptable mate?

The big catch being that the horse could replace slaves as far as sheer
muscle power went. But when it comes to things where manual dexterity
is involved, the slave wins until fairly late in the industrial
revolution. 

Heck, stevedores were better than machines at several phases of loading
and unloading vessel right up until containerized freight caught on. 

The original reason the American South needed all those slaves was to
pick cotton. And that came about *because* the invention of the cotton
gin made it *practical* to raise huge amounts of cotton. Before that
there was *too much* hand labor involved in removing the seeds.

Remember, the Draka are a *highly* unusual situation. They started out
with an "ideological need" for slavery after the ex-Confederates joined
them after the US Civil War.

Sure. *Some* starships can land at type X ports. They then have to load
or unload *by hand*, or pretty close to it. What a decent port could
unload in an hour might take them all day. 

This is the same reason that the Allies made a point of capturing a
relatively intact seaport shortly after D-Day. You *can* get troops and
supplies ashore via landing craft. But it takes specialized vehicles,
and takes a lot of time. 

Ports also have fueling facilities, and are tied into the local
transportation net. that last won\'t be *quite* as important in a CG
using civilization, but I bet there\'s still stuff better handled by
road or some sort of "subway" or even pipeline.

Just keep in mind that the *other* side wants that port intact too.
You\'ll mostly see major facilities being destroyed when the enemy is
fighting on territory that they took away from someone else. 

Otherwise it\'s a good sign that they consider the situation hopeless
and have decided that the only thing left to do is destroy things to
keep you from using them.

Just consider the temptations for a ref who is interested in Japanese
culture, and is fond of Shogun and samurai movies. 

Now *that* would be an interesting Imperium. And oddly enough, you
could even justify it, by extrapolating from Japanese dominance in
various industries and their interest in space. 

Other possibilities:

Chinese Imperial bureaucracy.
Cultural Russians, "reviving" the Czarist model.
Roman Revival.

And so on. This planet has seen a *lot* of "empires" with rather
different details. Even *gross* details.

If you want to take obscure (but known) "empires" and make them the
dominant culture of some planet with it\'s own humaniti and have *them*
be what the Imperium is descended from, things *rapidly* get weirder.

If I won the lottery, I\'d be tempted to hire a few anthro majors and
dig up what\'s known about *all* the cultures on Earth, and see what we
could do in the way of trying to "grow" them into industrial cultures,
and then on to planet-spanning cultures, spacefaring cultures,
starfaring cultures, and finally to interstellar cultures. 

It\'d make for one *hell* of a sourcebook. Probably more like a *series*
of sourcebooks.

I don\'t think so. And even if they did, I can think of several means of

And the Aztecs needed captured enemies for sacrifice to their God/s (a

By scale, the Egyptian economy didn\'t warrant large scale use of slaves, so
they were (by scale) the lesser user of slaves.  As where the Roman Empire
needed slaves in the long-run for economic reasons, the large scale supply
of foods and goods both military and civil.

All of these were actually aloowed (if not welcomed) into Roman society, but
when they worked against the Roman ways (gov\'t, etc.) were they repressed.
Christianity was repressed because of it\'s belief that there is only one
true god and that was heavily against Roman ways and it\'s belief in
polythesionism.

Slavery in ancient Europe was an economical requirement for some hundreds of
years, even with the coming of Christianity (many Popes had slaves [as the
bible sees, or had seen, no wrong in slavery as a practice or way of life.
Indeed, "Blessed is the slave whom his master, returning, finds performing
his charge," said Jesus in one of his parables -- Quoted from Slavery: A
World History by Milton Meltzer].  My old TU also had societies that relies
on slavery (with many models from malevolent to family units - all good for
plot devices) even though I believe it is canon that the Imperium does not
allow slavery (also for the making of many plot devices!).

I\'d recommend here some of the GURPS "Alternate Earth"
series. To my memory, there\'s only one of them that
has a spacefaring culture, and that\'s an Islamic
world-dominance one, but nonetheless they give good
ideas, since most are world empires...

However, while there may be conditions which release belligerents from
observing their formal treaty obligations as signatories to the several
Geneva and Hague Conventions, there is, according to my studies of the
Law of Land Warfare (US Army Field Manual 27-10), another source of
binding Laws of Land Warfare:  custom.  [The following quotes are from
the online edition of FM 27-10, Chapter 1 (Basic Rules and Principles).]

<<begin first quote>>

4. Sources 

The law of war is derived from two principal sources: 

a. Lawmaking Treaties (or Conventions), such as the Hague and Geneva
Conventions. 

b. Custom. Although some of the law of war has not been incorporated in
any treaty or convention to which the United States is a party, this
body of unwritten or customary law is firmly established by the custom
of nations and well defined by recognized
authorities on international law. 

Lawmaking treaties may be compared with legislative enactments in the
national law of the United States and the customary law of war with the
unwritten Anglo-American common law.

<<end first quote>>

<<begin second quote>>

6. Custom 

Evidence of the customary law of war, arising from the general consent
of States, may be found in judicial decisions, the writings of jurists,
diplomatic correspondence, and other documentary material concerning the
practice of States. Even though individual States may not be parties to
or otherwise strictly bound by H. IV and GPW 1929, the former convention
and the general principles of the latter have been held to be
declaratory of the customary law of war, to which all States are
subject. 

The Preamble to the HR specifically provides: 

Until a more complete code of the laws of war has been issued, the High
Contracting Parties deem it expedient to declare that, in cases not
included in the Regulations adopted by them, the inhabitants and the
belligerents remain under the protection and the rule of the principles
of the law of nations, as they result from the usages established among
civilized peoples, from the laws of humanity, and the dictates of the
public conscience. 

Similarly, a common article of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (GWS, art.
63; GWS Sea, art. 62; GPW, art. 142; GC, art. 158) provides that the
denunciation of (withdrawal from) any of the Geneva Conventions of 1949,
* * * shall in no way impair the obligations which the Parties to the
conflict shall remain bound to fulfil by virtue of the principles of the
law of nations, as they result from the usages established among
civilized peoples, from the laws of humanity and the dictates of the
public conscience.

<<end second quote>>

<<begin third quote, from paragraph 7>>

c. Force of Customary Law. The unwritten or customary law of war is
binding upon all nations. It will be strictly observed by United States
forces, subject only to such exceptions as shall have been directed by
competent authority by way of legitimate
reprisals for illegal conduct of the enemy (see par. 497). The customary
law of war is part of the law of the United States and, insofar as it is
not inconsistent with any treaty to which this country is a party or
with a controlling executive or legislative act, is binding upon the
United States, citizens of the United States, and other persons serving
this country.

<<end third quote>>

<<begin quote of paragraph 497, referenced above (Chapter 8)>>

497. Reprisals 

a. Definition. Reprisals are acts of retaliation in the form of conduct
which would otherwise be unlawful, resorted to by one belligerent
against enemy personnel or property for acts of warfare committed by the
other belligerent in violation of the law of war, for the purpose of
enforcing future compliance with the recognized rules of civilized
warfare. For example, the employment by a belligerent of a weapon the
use of which is normally precluded by the law of war would constitute a
lawful reprisal for
intentional mistreatment of prisoners of war held by the enemy.

<<end final quote>>

Those who are interested in further reading of official US Army doctrine
and interpretation of the Law of Land Warfare can go to the following
site:

http://155.217.58.58/cgi-bin/atdl.dll/fm/27-10/toc.htm

ObTrav:  The material quoted above can be used, either verbatim or in
analogy, to describe an interstellar polity\'s doctrine concerning the
laws of war.

To this very day, in Bangladesh, Thailand and West Napal to name a few,
there is still dept bondage where mainly children are sold into slave labour
and prostitution to pay of daddy\'s dept to someone else.

In the Ghana and the Sudan, rich land owners practice an almost sanctioned
slavery (well, sanctioned by their government) by contracting labourers that
are treated exactly as you may understand "slavery" to be, for a 5-year
term.  The thing is, after 8-10 years when the slave... errrr, labourer dies
from overwork and maltreatment, it appears no-one has told the poor bugger
his contract was up several years ago!  And he still dies owing the company
store money!

ObTrav:  We live in a world that prohibits slavery, yet it survives in one
way or another, sometimes "legally"... as well as it could in the Imerium?

Overwhelming is putting it lightly ;)

The only problem being that the bulk of the action was really in the cities,
politically, philosophical, and physically,  and that\'s not where the
peasants were. There were a number of relatively minor peasant riots, and
the peasants seized the land from their aristocratic landlords, but after
that they really didn\'t really do that much.

It\'s even more complicated because the Gallup Poll wasn\'t yet in general
use...

"Our recent poll shows that 71% of the peasants in the field are in favor of
the revolution, 12% think that the Committee for Public Safety isn\'t
guillotining enough aristocrats, spies and political opponents, 6% wish to
be let alone and allowed to eat cake, 6% are against the revolution because
they miss the snazzy outfits the aristocrats used to wear before times went
sour and 5% are undecided."

Granted, I\'ll give you that it really helped that the various revolutionary
factions had the support of the peasantry... *but* as far as I understand,
that support really began to dwindle, and by the time things got bad enough
that they called in Napoleon, the peasants had little say in their destiny.

One of the real problems with applying a Marxist class-based model to the
French revolution is that classes, as such, didn\'t really exist in France.
Class structures are "horizontal". The social structure of France was
"vertical", or privilege based. Of course, a really proper Marxist
revolution requires a degree of industrialization, which was really slow in
coming in France.

It\'s tough too, because apparently the major scholar on the French
Revolution was himself a Marxist. Damn, I wish I could remember his name.

Anyway, while I have friends who are Marxists, one of the failings that they
tend to have is that they try to hang a Marxist interpretation on anything
that has something resembling a hook. I tend toward being a Skocpol fellow
myself, even though I\'ve got two major problems: One, I don\'t understand her
as well as I\'d like, and two I\'m not familiar with the various critiques on
her structuralist view of social revolutions.

>"Elite" revolts that face opposition need mass support, or they will fail.


Only if the "masses" actually have some sort of direct connection to the
elite. Of course, the French Revolution went through a number of phases, and
the peasants were pretty active quite early on. Later on, they sat it out.

ObTrav: You can have *lots* of fun with revolutions, especially when the PCs
are involved, even accidentally. All that the characters wanted to do was
deliver a package, now their ship has been impounded by the "people" and
their Imperial credits are looking really good to the population of the
planet, since the economy has gone hyper-inflationary.

Do the characters join on the side of the well-dressed aristocracy... or do
they raise their fists and say, "Down with The Man! Power to the people!"?
If you\'re using the French Revolution as a model you can toss in artistes,
such as David, and any number of philosopher types to really increase the
fun you can have. You could have the "Grav-Ball Court Oath"! Of course, you
can have fun with the later "minor" revolutions as well.

And what about Puerto Rico, the majority of US citizens would be
*more* than happy to give them their independence, and we wouldn\'t
object to them joining the union as a state is they wanted.  It
comes up for a vote down there from time to time, but everytime it
does they vote to remain a territory.  Then *we* get blamed for
their decision...sheeze!

I\'d take this to the Imperium, but I don\'t imagine the Emperor
lets systems vote to *leave* the empire.

Perhaps you could provide some so I know what your argument is?
Barring that, yes there was resistance to german occupation durring
the war. The industrial output of occupied territories was definitely
effected by sabotage, slow work, etc. But production continued.
And how long would people have kept up the resistance if the
UK/US/USSR hadn\'t been actively fighting the germans? A world
rebelling on the border may be able to count on outside support
or liberation but not neccessarily. And get a few jumps into the interior
and you can forget about outside assistance.

Perhaps. But the imperium would also be more than willing to deal with
the victors of a proletarian revolution (Hah now you see my true sympathies)
as long as those same taxes keep roling in. It comes to a push(gambling
term,
means tie) IMHO. Oppressive regimes are tolerated but so are relatively
quick revolutions. In some instances I would expect some covert Impy help
to revolutionaries.

CF Scotland. Last I heard loyal subjects of the Queen. Yes there are lots of
reasons for worlds to rebel. There are also lots of reasons for the same
worlds
to remain loyal. Cultural inertia will result in most worlds in the imperium
remaining loyal. When worlds do rebel the marines deploy. As the Imps can
always count on overwhelming odds against any single world we can assume
the world will capitulate fairly soon. Then sift through the locals looking
for a
loyal government. Orbital bombardment only gets in the way.

I\'m not as hip on Japanese history as I should be so if I make any
factual errors please correct me.

Prior to this the only people who tried to break through to Japan were
the Chinese (who\'s fleet was destroyed in a storm(Kamikaze)) and the
Dutch (who traded there for a while but were kicked out.) To the best
of my knowledge nobody else even tried untill the Americans.

This was also coincident with the Meiji restoration - a revolution of sorts
in which power shifted to the emperor that had previously been held by
warlords. The newly powerfull emperor, realizing that Japan\'s previous
isolation had led to stagnation, ordered a massive westernization
campaign. (Damned impressive too, they went from a feudal agrarian
backwater to an industrial power in less than 100 years)
So they were ready to do this any way and the US didn\'t cram
missionaries down their throats(which is what the dutch did that resulted
in their dismisal)

Well you start With the SA, and SS and comb through records of party
mebership
etc. You will undoubtedly find/execute people in those groups who aren\'t
commited nazi\'s but we don\'t need to be perfect in this instance. You can
assume
most of the rest are merely pasive supporters who are willing to adopt
another
governing Ideology. Again some nasty war criminal types will slip through
the
cracks but again we aren\'t worried about perfect. What you wind up with is
a population which is statistically likely to not be significantly nazi. At
least
they won\'t act like them as long as the occupation holds. This is by the way
more or less how we dealt with the silly master race twits historically.

Yes and that same cross section of germans later accepted that Nazism
was wrong(at least when the allied troops were arround) Studies exist
that prove that almost anybody will perform the most heinous acts if
they perceive that those acts were ordered by an authority figure. (I
can\'t cite them off hand but they are in any first year Psych/Soc text)
Set yourself up as the authority and most Humans will obey you.

Yes because just nailing cities doesn\'t necesarily impose control.
Marines impose control. And again the ground forces will be a good deal
less random in their application of force. I cannot stress that last
sentance
enough. It\'s the key to the whole problem. If you want willing Imperial
subjects you need to at least appear to avoid indiscriminate killing.

As well as the fact that none of these weapons is very useful in a
military sense. Nukes destroy whatever they hit - If you want something
you can\'t nuke it. Chem and bio weapons have a nasty habit of biting you
on the ass if your not very carefull. They are used occasionaly against
civilian populations these days. They don\'t appear to have decided the
course of any wars. They certainly haven\'t stopped any (I\'m primarily
thinking of the Iran/Iraq/Kuwait/Kurd mess here.)

Any government that wishes to last as long as the Imperium has lasted
has to cultivate at least the appearance of benevolency. If everybody thinks
the imperium is the problem the imperium falls. QED.

Perhaps I am. My point was that occupation was necesary even with
the nasty nuke terror weapon victory. In both instances it was conventional
force which beat the enemy and occupation(Which continues to this day in
both instances) that sealed the victory. The use of terror weapons in both
instances didn\'t change the eventual outcome.

Actually strategic bombing = terror weapons in most respects.
It is possible for a heavy bomber to be given a tactical mission which
tends to confuse things a little. Everything else that SAC does is target
civilian populations.

If they\'re smart they will. Tactical targets win wars. Strategic targets
absorb explosives.

If there was anything in that city you wanted you will have to rebuild it.

Why? You need to destroy the enemies will to resist. Wether his industry

Germany was still producing armaments to the end of the war.

The peace was severely bungled after the great war. Germany was not occupied
and onerous conditions were imposed on the germans by the alies. Which
probably wouldn\'t have led to the next war if the depression hadn\'t
destroyed
the worlds economy and the french hadn\'t insisted that the germans continue
to
repay reparations. IMTU the 3I has learned this lesson well, "Don\'t kick

(The Commander\'s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations (NWP 1-14M))

"6.2.3 Reprisal. A reprisal is an enforcement measure under the law of armed
conflict consisting of an act which would otherwise be unlawful but which is
justified as a response to the unlawful acts of an enemy. The sole purpose
of a reprisal is to induce the enemy to cease its illegal activity and to
comply with the law of armed conflict. Reprisals may be taken against enemy
armed forces, enemy civilians other than those in occupied territory, and
enemy property.

6.2.3.1 Requirements for Reprisal. To be valid, a reprisal action must
conform to the following criteria:

1. Reprisal must be ordered by an authorized representative of the
belligerent government. (For the rule applicable to the United States, see
paragraph 6.2.3.3).

2. It must respond to illegal acts of warfare committed by an adversary
government, its military commanders, or combatants for which the adversary
is responsible. Anticipatory reprisal is not authorized.

3. When circumstances permit, reprisal must be preceded by a demand for
redress by the enemy of his unlawful acts.

4. Its purpose must be to cause the enemy to cease its unlawful activity.
Therefore, acts taken in reprisal should be brought to the attention of the
enemy in order to achieve maximum effectiveness. Reprisal must never be
taken for revenge.

5. Reprisal must only be used as a last resort when other enforcement
measures have failed or would be of no avail.

6. Each reprisal must be proportional to the original violation.

7. A reprisal action must cease as soon as the enemy is induced to desist
from its unlawful activities and to comply with the law of armed conflict."

I would have to assume that in the 3I, similar restrictions are in place.
Even if there are no *written* treaties. The Geneva Conventions are only
about 50 years old, if I remember correctly (that\'s a big if), but the same
principles have been followed for quite a while. After over a thousand years
of interstellar war, I would expect the same types of conventions to be
followed, even if they are not in writing.

Maybe the 3I canon setting is not so unbelievable after all...

It was worse than that. Before the Diasporia, the early christians concidered
themselves Jews (as Yesuda of Nazereth was King of the Jews) . The Jews
themselves wanted nothing to do with a heritical sect (as for among other
things, jepodised their concesions with the empire in terms of worship of Ceasar

the jews had, the christians where persicuted.

Kyle adds: good IRL example, the British and teir
recent thing of whether or not nukes are lawful. Note
that the Geneva conventions and protocols prohobit the
use of weapons that:
"...cause superfluous injury or unneccesarry
suffering..."
"...cause widespread long-term and severe damage to
the natural environment"
"...Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of
which is to spread terror among the civilian
population are prohibited."

and also prohibited are "indiscriminate" weapons such
as "...Those which employ a method or means of combat
which cannot be directed at a specific military
objective..." 

And there are those that say nukes fall into this
category. The Brit government disagrees, but its
scottish courts do not, saying that a person who\'d
vandalised a Trident submarine couldn\'t be prosecuted,
because that submarine was illegal under international
law. The UK govt says the conventions apply only to
"conventional" weapons, not nukes. Hmmmm....

So a diplomat certainly could have a different
interpretation to his own government.

Cris Seamans asks why ban rocks but not energy
weapons? I don\'t know, why ban gas but not nukes? Why
ban poisoned bullets but not agent orange? Why ban
serrated bayonets and shotguns but not frag grenades?
I can only answer that some weapons are more
"terrible" than others, in the sense of inspiring more
terror and horro. Gas, for example, definately is
scarier than bullets, regardless of statsistics of
deadliness. And I will be more scared of a screaming
mad looking soldier charging at me with a serrated
bayonet, than Fritz with his frag grenade. Strange but
true.

Culmination of the Punic Wars.  It wasn\'t ideological, exactly.  It
wasn\'t racial, exactly.  It wasn\'t religious, at all.  I\'d say it
was mostly economic and political. 

Let\'s say the young Third Imperium had a competing state that was
almost as large and powerful.  This competing state was actively
courting systems to join it, and succeeding more often than the
Imperium likes.  The Imperium and this state go to war time and
again, but neither side can really defeat the other.  It\'s not
racial, it\'s not ethnic, it\'s not religious, but both sides are
going to grow to hate and despise each other.  Finally, the Imperium
finds a way to capture their opponent\'s capital, and they make "an
example" of it.  Then they offer "terms" to the rest of their
opposition..."accept our terms or suffer the fate of Carthage."

Is this how the Julian Wars would have ended *if* the Imperium had
won?  <g>

This is a good place to point out that cultural differences can get you
in *real* trouble with this sort of thing. As an extreme example, check
out L.E. Modesitt\'s "Adiamante". 

A culture that considers "if you do that, we\'ll do this" to be a form
of aggression. Likewise for displays of force. All they can do is try
to set up situations where if their "visitors" can actually stop and
*think through* the implications of things they are seeing, they might
figure out that they\'ll be in big trouble if they start anything.

And, naturally, part of the problem is that even when they let the
"vistors" read a copy of the "rules" they live by (or the basic
principles behind them) the visitors reaction is "They can\'t *really*
mean that".

I point you toward the incredibly overdone Star Wars Technical Commentaries:

More than you ever wanted to know about the Death Star, all on one page. It

From _Survival Margin_, page 79:

"When Chief of Combined Intelligence Admiral Herzoch Stearns ordered the
development of an offensive virus based on the Cymbeline chips, he
planned to use the talents of \'wild strain\' chips which could command
prey chips to cut new circuitry without having to come into physical
contact with them."

Ibid, page 79:

"The two main strengths of the virus, its heritage from the Cymbeline
chips, were 1) its intelligence, and 2) its ability to cut new
circuitry, i.e., embed itself in hardware, not just software."

Many thanks.

Now, who was this fellow?  Some Solomani officer who found out about
the chips after the Solomani overran Cymbeline?  Or an Imperial officer?

The point is: can I assume that the Imperium knows about the chips
in 1120 of the alternate timeline?

An Imperial Navy officer, Admiral Stearns served as Chief of Combined
Imperial Intelligence from 1097 to 1108 (_Survival Margin_, page 71).

Yes, the Imperium knows about these chips in 1120.  After all, the
SDG-313F strain of chips, a "lobotomized" version of the Cymbeline
chips, was introduced as the basis for Imperial transponders in 1088
(ibid, pages 70-71).  Further, since Admiral Stearns ordered the
development of Virus during his tenure as Chief of Combined Imperial
Intelligence, the possibility of Virus was recognized no later than
1108.  Finally, Dr. Arnold Rushorin, formerly of the Free University of
Aquitaine, defected to the Imperium in 1110, and published a
heavily-censored paper on the Cymbeline chips in 1114 (ibid, page 72).

Sorry I can\'t provide more detailed information, but _Survival Margin_
is the only TNE sourcebook I own.

No, that is *not* it.

The Jews had only one god and they were left alone.  They were even given an
exemption from worshipping the Emperor-- but they didn\'t refuse to serve in
the army or pay taxes because of their beliefs. (Some Christians refused to
pay taxes, I forget the exact reason, and many Christian groups prior to the
Council of Nicaea were pacifist.)  There were all kinds of problems with
Christians not obeying various Roman laws which is why so many of the
epistles stress obedience to the established order.  That whole "women
should obey their husbands" thing that Christian women get slammed down
their throats is being taken out of context-- it\'s from a larger sermon
wherein the importance of obeying societal laws is being stressed, in which
slaves are also told to obey their masters.  Many early Christians were
antinomian, or "anti-law", believing that the Old Testament Law was not the
only law they didn\'t have to follow on account of Jesus\' sacrifice.


Also, the Jews were mostly born into their religion, whereas Christianity
was spread by conversion.  Hmmm... you are a large Empire, and you have a
religion sweeping thru your society by conversion that is causing people to
disobey their superiors and the law generally, how do you handle it?  Unless
you\'re Constantine, and can see the wisdom of taking it over and trying to
control it, you probably try to suppress it...

Especially when they also preach that their god is the only god, and 
your empire covers a very large area with many diverse cultures that 
have different religions. However much I dislike the later empires 
suppression of pagans, in the long run conversion of the (Roman)empire 
to Christianity was probably the only way to preserve it.

The Japanese made extensive use of chemical and bacteriological warfare
in China.  They had a large installation in the middle of the country
dedicated entirely to experimenting on Chinese prisoners (and some
Allied P.O.W.s) with new germs and chemicals.  Then they used these
germs and chemicals on troops and civilians.  One example I remember
involved putting mosquitos that carried some disease (probably malaria)
into big clay jars and dropping out of airplanes into Chinese villages.  

The scientists were never prosecuted as war criminals.  The bargain was,
they provided their research results to the United States and the United
Nations would not prosecute. If I recall correctly, some of them came to
work for the United States military, much as the more famous German
rocket scientists did.  

It\'s very well documented.  Last year I saw a quite horrifying
exhibition about it at the old navy base on Treasure Island in San
Francisco Bay.  If the exhibition comes to your town, go see it.

Marx referred to these as bourgeois revolutions.  They were the
revolutions that marked the transformation of European society from
agrarian/feudal to industrial/capitalist.  A class analysis still
applies, but the classes are the feudal classes -- basically the land
owners and the land workers, who split the production of the land
between themselves.  The classes in capitalist society are the owners of
the means of production and the wage-earning workers.

The communists didn\'t read Marx, or ignored what they\'d read.  Marx said
that communism can\'t occur until the forces of production are maximized,
and that _the_ way that the forces of production will be maximized is
through capitalism.  The major communist revolutions took place in
agrarian, semi-feudal societies (Russia and China), not industrial,
capitalist societies.  The forces of production in Russia were
inadequate to maintain a communist society, so it collapsed, along with
its many client states (some of whom were mature, but not totally
maximized, industrial states, like East Germany). 
 
China under Deng Xiaoping is trying to manage the process of
transformation from agrarian to industrial, from feudal to capitalist,
society.  A communist state and then a communist world (that will also
be a Chinese state and a Chinese world) are the long-term goals.  (Yes,
I\'ve read too much of the Chung Kuo series, and studied too much Chinese
history in college and graduate school.)

Marx never set a time line for the maximization of the forces of
production and the collapse of capitalism under the weight of its
internal contradictions.  The advent of interstellar travel and the
discovery of great new markets to conquer will extend the growth and
development of capitalism for a very long time.  

The form of economic relations in the Far Future have a feudal gloss,
but are still capitalist relations.  In the Imperium at least, the means
of production are privately owned, non-owners are paid wages in return
for the fruits of their labor, and government exists to maintain the
status quo.  

This sort of Marxist analysis suggests some questions.  What conditions
would indicate that the forces of production in the Imperium are being
maximized?  What internal contradictions are being experienced now,
compared to those described by Marx?  How much of a threat to the status
quo would an efficient communist or anarchist world be?  How much of a
threat would it be perceived to be?

Please bear in mind I\'m *not* on a Yank-bash here.

Based on that definition alone, would the US really be a superpower ?  Could they have exerted their will in Kosovo or Kuwait without the co-operation of any other power ?  I submit that these are only military examples of exerting a nation\'s will, and that there are many other ways (cultural, economic, ideological to name a few) of doing so.  If your friends and enemies alike (of whatever nation or state) decide they don\'t like what you\'re doing, it ain\'t gonna get done, no matter who you are.

Ballpark figure : average 200 grams per person, per day of solids and
1.5L of liquid. The big volume in sewage is the water used to flush the
stuff away.
	The big problem is going to be with other trash, in terms of quantity.
Fusion torches really simplify waste disposal though, IMHO.

The sewage will be full of \'friendly\' micro-organisms. Consider it a
\'low-tech nanite\' approach to terraforming - spray the stuff everywhere.

The only real problem, over the very long term (millenia, as planets are
BIG places) will be the loss of phosphorous from the biosphere. Enormous
reserves of nitrogen are in the atmosphere, and tectonically active
worlds will have carbonate-CO2 cycling. 
	Phosphate containing rocks could be mined or imported. Again, fusion
torching makes material processing and purification relatively easy.

Or a great weapon. The local agricultural authorities (not to mention
environmental groups) would not allow such material off planet.

Whangan plants are unlikely to use chlorophyll, if you\'re using
Leonard\'s (Weber\'s) idea (which raises the possibility of non-green
plant life ; what colour is Whanga\'s sun?).
	Target this molecule with a poison, as well as a number of other
metabolic steps in the local plant life. This should be relatively easy
with TL8-12 chemical and biochemical techniques. 
	\'Combination chemotherapy\' will be irresistible for a few years until
you come up with some method of biological control (but without animal
life the latter option may be problematic).

Pollination of imported plants is the big impediment to their use if
there aren\'t any useful local insects.

I think someone mentioned tax loopholes and other legal and cultural
wrinkles - the easiest handwave, IMHO.

In any case I regularly use Skycatalogue 2000 when doing systems to get

Just like the \'baddie\' ships in "This Island Earth" which guided the
meteors to the target.

Question: Why did a civilisation that had developed the "interociter"(sp?),
and shipboard weapons capable of destroying the inbound meteors, not have
an effective planetary defence system around Metaluna?

Apologies for the late post, I\'m just catching up with my mail from the

I doubt it. At the time Traveller first came out, the only
Klingons we\'d seen on ST were in a few TV episodes. The aspects
of Klingons that would be reminiscent of the Vargr didn\'t evolve
until TNG and DS9, by which time the Vargr were already out there...

Speaking of Vargr, one running gag in my Traveller campaign is that
the Vargr engineer, an NPC, likes to stick his head out the window
of the team\'s air-raft -- mostly to bug the team leader, who invariably
responds with an annoyed "Stop that!"...

  Either wait for T5 (6-8 months?) or get GURPS: Traveller, 2nd ed.; the
best way is mail-order from either: www.imphobbies.com or www.sentrybox.com
 - both avoid customs handling charges, and the latter avoids PST, being in
Alberta. If you go with OOP/used systems, try www.titangames.com, downport (?),
or Mr. Miller\'s page - he has lots of neat stuff that you won\'t find elsewhere.

Um... too late!  Somebody should have warned you before you asked that in
open forum.  Now you have rekindled the wildfire that is "the version
question".  By the time it is over you will have more information than you
ever wanted and the entire list will have reached critical mass. <sigh>
Well, I guess I\'ll start things off: I suggest you get a copy of the T5
playtest material and fiddle with that until the full version comes out next
year. ;-)

Been away for a few days so this is coming a bit late ...

"The  Early  Adventures"  does  *not*  contain  all  the   Digest
adventures.  What happened was that when Digest  started  it  was
the CT era.  Then MT came out and so  DGP  published  "The  Early
Adventures" which included the characters and  the  first  *four*
adventures converted into MT stats.  (It  was  also  in  8.5 x 11
inch format rather than LBB-size format.)

You must have a particularly nasty mortgage...mine allows me to work
anywhere I please, or not work, even. So long as I can come up with the
payment each month. 

I am also entirely free to sell my house and pay off the mortgage if I
so desire. 

I can rent the house out and live somewhere else.

Heck, I can even NOT pay the mortgage, and all that will happen is that
the bank will take back the house _they_ paid for. I will not be hunted
down, arrested, and forced back to my job paying the mortgage.

A loan isn\'t indenture by any stretch of the imagination.

If the bank said I had to keep working at Eneri\'s Widget Works until the
mortgage was paid off, and directly attached my earnings, _then_ I\'d be
indentured.

Been away for a few days so this is coming a bit late ...

At the risk of starting a debate about what is and  isn\'t  canon,
there are GDW references to the Ine Givar:  some  Traveller  News
Service stories in JTAS prior to the 5FW, and  inclusion  of  Ine
Givar guerrilla units in the 5FW boardgame.

Additionally, as  already  mentioned  in  other  replies,  Andrew
Moffatt-Vallance wrote a detailed look at the  Ine Givar  history
and scope which was first posted to the TML  and  then  became  a
published article in SJG\'s Pyramid magazine (I haven\'t  seen  the
latter \'cos I\'m not a Pyramid  member).  While  I  enjoyed  AMV\'s
write-up my interpretation of the Ine Givar for MTU limited their
sphere of influence to the coreward half of the Spinward Marches.
Is the Pyramid article \'canon\'?  Probable depends on how you view
GT material in general.  Remember IYTU YMMV.

Certainly not. A dinosaur-killer rock would probably accomplish the feat

order to get a better view or something).

The liquid mass would travel upwards and solidify. This is what happens
constantly when the tectonic plates are moving away from each other.
Thankfully, this doesn\'t destroy the Earth :-)

Agreed. Blasting the thing away would be pretty hard. A better solution
(depending on why exactly you want to remove the planet) would be to
destroy all life on it (big rock) or nuking it until it glows (if you
want to prevent someone from ever using it again, perhaps for strategic
reasons).

Hm...I\'m not sure what the total quantity of radioactives in the earth\'s core is, I\'m not sure its sufficient to blow the planet apart, but its probably enough to melt the planet (which is orders of magnitude easier).  A \'fusion catalyst\' is probably a ranged high power nuclear damper also.

No.  It would result in a sizeable release of energy as the rest of the planet settled inward, squeezing mantle material into the area to fill the hole, but that\'s pure gravitational energy caused by the shrinking of the planet.  In any case, making a hole large enough to severely disrupt the surface of the planet isn\'t easier than melting the surface of the planet.

Planets are generally stable, and aren\'t capable of destroying themselves.

        Its not like there is a list in AM:3.  However, one of the remarks
made is that Charisma is something that is hard to maintain because it is
something that is *personal*...  which is one of the reasons that the Vargr
are so factionalized from the Imperial POV.  So, I\'d extrapolate from that
concept the idea that "push button warfare" is not nearly as good for
playing hero as "Cutlass in Paw" warfare.  To me, that\'s the essence of
Charisma...  having the guts to go somewhere and do something noteable *in
person*.  Don\'t be stupid, obviously, but we Terrans rarely toast the boys
in Bomber Command the way we talk about Buzz Burling or any other number of
fighter pilots....  one-on-one or one-vs-superior foe stories are always
more dramatic, romantic and heroic than "went there, got shot at, dropped
payload, got shot at, went home" stories
        (Note:  I am *not* belittling the Vets of WW2 Bomber Command...  I
have a great respect for them.  I *am* generalizing about pop-culture.
Please save flames for summer barbque\'s, I don\'t want them).

>Besides,  I thought that the Aslan were supposed to be the honorable ones.

        Honor and Charisma are two different concepts entirely.  They are
not mutually exclusive.  An Aslan might find Honor in a particular Vargr,
just as a Vargr might find a particular Aslan Charismatic.

        Fair enough.  I got the impression you were voting the Vargr race as
a whole to be in the #1 position for rock-dropping or other WOMD first-use.

        I\'ll defer to you here, as I have read neither set of material.  I
am going entirely on my own impressions of AM:3.  However, I believe that
the Amerind (Apache,anyway) concept of "Counting Coup" is an example of one
of the sort of ideas that go into Charisma....  being personally there,
personally brave and personally victorious, even if its only in sneaking up
behind some Cavalry Lt. and tapping him on the shoulder before you
disappear...  you could do it, you *did* do it, and now your friends are
impressed by it.

Depending on the force mix, it could have been launched from the US (B-1, 
B-2, B-52) or by Naval Aviation off of carriers in the Adriatic.  Not quite 
as practical, but doable.

OK - there are presently 7 101 Books so you probably have them all.

The Long Way Home is now out of print, as is first edition 101 
Cargos(*) and first edition copies of the Traveller Bibliography.

(*) The difference is that a new set of cargos were generated as Jo 
Grant\'s originals were grabbed for JTAS by IG. SJG have always had 
the second edition of this.

But, \'SpaceDogs\' and \'The Khiidkar Incident\' are both out now. These 
are 101 sized (ie LBB size) adventures with stats for GT and T4 and 
notes on using the system with all Traveller editions. SJG will 
probably have them in for Christmas. In the mean time, Leisure Games 
in London have copies and Esdevium (big UK games supplier) probably 
will too (if not now, pretty soon). FWIW these adventures were 
released following the TMLs cries for adventures in the LBB style. If 
they sell more, we have more to release; if not, well, we tried to 
give people what they asked for!

We\'re hoping to have the following out for Christmas:
- ----

At Close Quarters - Doug Berry\'s detailed combat rules for Traveller, 
famous for Penguins.

101 Patrons - over a hundred patrons for Traveller, including 
material by Andy Slack (the 36 dramatic situations) and Thad Coons 
(World Seeds as originally seen on the TML). This will be almost a 
sequel to 101 Plots but bigger, harder (science) and better (IMO but 
I edited and wrote a chunk of it).

The Traveller Bibliography 2nd Edition - Timothy Collinson\'s 
excellent guide to all things Traveller.

Obviously, the release dates of this will be as soon as we can get 
them out - we all work for a living (and sadly not in RPGs) and have 
to fit in BITS work around real life. UK release usually predates US 
release as SJG have to see the BITS book before they say yes and 
order it.

ISTR that there is was also a belief amongst contemporary Romans that 
Christians (1) drank human blood and flesh in their ceremonies and 
(2) went into the world trying to commit the worst sins they could, 
to come back at the next service and boast about them.

Operating in the Adriatic needs the co-operation of the bordering 
states, and the airborne attack would need to be based on stand off 
weapons from outside any other counties airspace, which you would 
violate by firing through it. Bear in mind NATO\'s air operations in 
Kosovo had a serious impact on civilian flights in the regions...

This has been said about every oppressed religious or ethnic group since
time began, and shouldn\'t really be taken seriously... Christians used to 
say this about the Jews, too.

Well, there were some Gnostics (the Carpocratians come to mind) that I
wouldn\'t have put that past.

There were lots of flavors of Christianity in existence before the Council
of Nicaea declared all of the others heretics and produced an "official
version" that was strangely amenable to being used as a tool of
imperialist conquest by Constantine, who sponsored the Council.  Then the
official Christians went out and stamped out all the other versions and
did their best to destroy the holy books that all the other versions had.

This is one of the reasons that I can\'t personally accept Christianity
based on Scripture.  There was a hell of a lot of Scripture that got
thrown out; the Bible Christians have today was heavily edited and revised
by many committees hundreds of years after the death of Jesus and none of
the Gospels were actually written down sooner than 100-200 years after his
death, though they may have been transmitted orally.  And as these were
not primarily oral cultures, I don\'t particularly trust oral transmission
from the Jews, Greeks and Romans of that era.

We have not recovered anything close to all of the Gnostic Gospels.  While
I\'m sure some of them were bogus I\'m sure that the official ones, which
were heavily edited and revised, are not pure either.  It\'s difficult to
say, without all the evidence, what Jesus really was all about-- but one
thing that is historically clear is that there was a lot of uncertainty
even then, if you look at all the different varieties of Christianity that
existed prior to Constantine and all the different things they did.

Of course, people who have had personal experiences with Jesus are a
different matter-- I don\'t question the personal experiences of others,
lest they should question what happened to me in Gokokuji Temple (when all
I originally intended to do there was find the grave of Ozaki Yutaka,
LOL!)  Religion and beliefs are intensely personal.  I did, however, lose
my last attachments to Christianity, which were incredibly tenuous to
begin with, in graduate school.

Unless the waters are restricted, they should be international and cleared 
for free movement of shipping, and the carriers and their battle 
group.  I\'m not saying it is how it should have been done, only that it 
_can_ be done.  The US based air power if it were to be used would have to 
fly quite a roundabout route, and the only pinch point would be at the 
entrance to the Med, at Gibraltar.

Regarding the local air traffic, IIRC, our carriers operate with a declared 
exclusion zone most of the time.  You start getting warnings some distance 
away, then get an interception by the CAP, and if you approach within a 
certain distance, other steps might be taken depending on the current 
threat level.

Again, it would not be the ideal way to do it, but it could be done.  I 
know that were _I_ in charge, I would not force three to six CVBGs into the 
Adriatic.

<everything concerning rock dropping snipped>

It really seems like we\'ve gotten to a point where I have to assume that
we\'ll need to agree to disagree. While I don\'t like taking that road, it\'s
apparent that your view of the way societies work and my view of the way
societies work simply have no common ground.

In your view of the way human societies operate, there are free-floating
individualists, not cultures. In my view, cultures are, at least for the
most part, coherent, if not internally consistent. By your line, many things
that would have happened in the real world simply could not have happened,
and to be fair, by my line many things that would have happened in the world
also wouldn\'t have happened.

It shows in those things that you wish to focus on, such as finding and
nailing individual Nazis in order to de-Nazify Germany, while in response to
that, I would point out that certain concepts and ideas were specifically
introduced into German culture after the war and were necessary to
de-Nazification process.

On most points though, it seems like a continued discussion would simply be
a matter of us going through the motions, with me pushing the culturalist
line and you pushing the utilitarian individualist line.

I\'d be lying if I said the discussion wasn\'t fun though. ;)

You beat me to pointing out that this has been said about every oppressed
religious or ethnic group. There *is* one important distinction though:

One of the things that has been central to Christianity since its earliest
days has been the sacrament of Communion. Tied in with that sacrament is the
concept of trans-substantion, in which the bread and wine are said to
*actually* become the body and blood of Christ.

So, while the same rumors have floated about other oppressed religious
groups, had you walked up to your average Christian throughout most of the
history of Christianity and asked him or her if he partook of the flesh of
Christ, the answer would be yes.

Subject:  OFF TOPIC (OT): Taikonauts!

Jeesshhhh!!!

     Where do I begin to defend what I said here?

     The USA was founded on an individuals right to life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness. These basic elements are what is needed to sustain a free
democratic and CAPITALISTIC  society. Without a doubt, the most successful one
yet. By what measurement? The only yardstick that matters . . . . . . LIFE.

     Over the past 200+ years, the USA has drawn to it people  who cared for
their own welfare first and the fruits of their mind and body a close second.
The net result of this freedom of mind and body is the most technologically
advanced, educated and well fed nation in the world. If the will of these free
producing people is to explore space, then that will happen in spades. While
some oppressive nations are trying to figure out how to keep it\'s populace from
fighting over the scraps it "gives" them, the free producing nation will be
spreading it\'s seeds to the stars. Human life will continue because individuals
chose it, not because a government demanded it.

      I do not deny the contributions of non-US citizens to space exploration.
Remember where most of those individuals go to do their work and get fairly
compensated for it. I do refuse to celebrate the successes of dictatorships or
socialists. They will plant a flag on alien soil and exalt the sacrifices of
those who got them there.

     I want to plant a flag on alien soil exalt the accomplishments of free will
and enterprise.

I will speak no further about this on the list . . . . . I am warmly welcomed as
a gammer and for that I am thankful. You folks are the most scientifically
stimulating group I know.

I will keep my ideology to myself from now on.

oh my.

Tieing _this_ in with the oft discussed Vilani Cannibalism Hypothesis,
one is led to the conclusion that perhaps Jesus was a lost or rogue
Vilani...perhaps with a supply of slow drug and a nifty autodoc in a
cave near his headquarters...

Yup. For that, in the USA, you need a Family Court or Divorce Proceeding.
In many states, you can be jailed for not making your alimony payments. 
Even if you\'ve lost the high-paying job the alimony payments were
based on.

I\'ve heard of a case where the divorce settlement was a sizeable 
percentage of a professional american football player\'s salary for his entire 
career. After a year or two, he began to talk retirement...it\'s a tough
game, many people\'s bodies wear out, he said he\'d made enough
money and wanted to get out while his body still worked. 

His ex-wife slapped a court order on him to keep playing.

I think modern research on German post-WWI reparations is along the lines of:

- - Germany refused to pay reparations *and* repudiated the loans they had used to
pay reparations up to that point, *and* added to the problem by a massive
currency devaluation, and if you add up the numbers then in fact they
didn\'t pay much reparations at all to the victorious powers

- - Reparations still had to be made, in the sense that someone had
to pay for the infrastructural damage of WWI, final result being that the
countries which had suffered war damage paid for it themselves

- - Germany was never occupied during WWI, and for all the loss in manpower had
suffered very little damage on the home front, so effectively it ended paying
far less reparations than most of the other European belligerents, in the sense
that its own recovery was cheaper.

The end result of the supposed enfeeblement of Germany was that by the 1930s
it was once again a superpower, capable of massive rearmament programs,
intervention in Spain and elsewhere, and ultimately the initiation of a series
of conflicts culminating in global war. 

And the second result is that Germany was able to engage in these adventures in
part because it was surrounded, in the West, by those countries which were
genuinely enfeebled by the cost of the previous war, and in the East by a
subdivision of Austria Hungary into a series of statelets which could
individually offer neither threat nor resistance to a revitalised Germany, but
which on the other hand acted as an protective buffer zone for Germany against
the Soviet Union as Germany recovered.

Lesson being, "once they\'re down, make sure they stay down" (NB that doesn\'t
necessarily mean repression - for example one of the things not countenanced in
Wilson\'s redrawing of the European map in 1919 was substantive division of
Germany, other than anomalies such as Danzig and East Prussia).

Well Tim, you\'ve opened a can o\' worms here! ;^)

You\'ll surely here as many different answers as there are people on the TML!
Here\'s mine.

I really believe that if your playing by email then , if your running a game
yourself, I\'d concider buying the reprints of the CT version that Marc has
coming out, ot GURPS:Traveller, since both of these offer (or will offer in
the immediate future) large, and reasonably complete data bases to work
from.

Most email games are combines of several versions, but since all but G:T and
TNE are basically updates of Classic Traveller, the reprints would be a good
start. So if your planing to be a player in someone elses game, I\'d start
there then let your GM guide you if more specific information is required.

Saying all this you might think I\'m a CT fan, but really, since I got back
into the game a few years ago, I\'ve been building a collection of
MegaTraveller stuff. For the most part I find that MT took the better parts
of CT and added some real time and effort saving features (task system,
integrated large scale combat, etc.), T4, dispite it\'s best efforts never
reached this stage of integration, in my opinion. G:T, since the base system
is so large, has these opertunities as well, however GURPS, as I\'ve learned
from several gamse I\'ve run, can get complicated, and IMHO doesn\'t lend well
to PEM (too many die rolls involved in combat, etc.). MT has the draw back
of being mostly expensive and hard to find.

Humm, Hope some of this helps,

Mike

It happened.  You can ship your own firearm to/from the manufacturer since
no transfer of ownership happens.  You cannot use the USMail for handguns,
only longguns.


From http://www.atf.treas.gov/core/firearms/information/faq/faq.htm

(B8) May a nonlicensee ship a firearm through the mails?

A nonlicensee may mail a shotgun or rifle to a resident of his own State or
to a licensee in any State. Handguns are not mailable. A common or contract
carrier must be used to ship a handgun. A nonlicensee may not transfer a
handgun to a non licensed resident of another State.

The Postal Service recommends that longguns be sent by registered mail and
that no marking of any kind which would indicate the nature of the contents
be placed on the outside of any parcel containing firearms.

A carrier must be notified that the shipment contains a firearm.

In addition, Federal law prohibits common or contract carriers from
requiring or causing any label to be placed on any package indicating that
it contains a firearm.

Planets, as others have pointed out, are largely stable.  You can wipe out
all life on the planet easily enough, but actually blasting it into peices
is damn tough.  Accepting the previously given figure of 10^32 Joules (was
that Anthony Jackson?  Where did you get that?), you could smack a .1 C
rock into the world, but it would require a mass of around 10^17 kg. 
That\'s on the order of 10^14 m^3!  Hmm, actually, a cube 50 km on a side
would almost do it. 

My math, feel free to correct: 
(5E4 m)^3 = 1.25E14 m^3  (rock\'s volume)
1.25E14 m^3 * 5 tons/m^3 = 6.25E14 tons (rock\'s mass)
.5 * (6.24E14) * (3E7)^2 = 2.81E29 Joules (rock\'s KE at .1 C)

Which is a little low for obliteration, but good enough for a terror
effect, I think :-). Of course, the mass gets much lower with higher
velocities.  How does the destruction energy change with planetary
diameter?

Hmm, a thought just occurred to me.  What about peaceful use of near-c
rocks?  What if you had a world-sized object whose orbit was decaying such
that it posed a threat to another, inhabitted world?  Total obliteration
wouldn\'t be necessary, of course, but a spectacular "nudge" with a near-c
rock would be one way of dealing with it.  Wait, nope, if you can generate
that much thrust, why not just apply it to the world itself?  Or would you
get additional benefits from the impact...?  Just thinking out loud...

Back in the good ol\' days of EC Comics, there was a story in Weird Science,
I believe, and it concerned a similar scenario.

The Galactic Exploration Authority was doing its survey work. They
discovered one world in the early iron age and one of the scouts was dropped
off to learn about their culture, customs and language. On the way back
home, the rocket ship that had carried him was destroyed in an accident (I\'m
pretty sure it got whacked by a rock). All records that this scout had been
assigned to this job were destroyed.

The GEA scout was a nice enough chap, and he was disgusted by the conditions
on the world. He started doing the little things he could do to help. He
healed the sick with his advanced medicines, he fed the hungry with his
advanced survival rations. Word of his deeds eventually reached the upper
echelons of society. They had him captured and brought before them. They
demanded he feed and heal them instead of the wretched and the poor. He
refused.

So, many years later, the GEA detects atomic bomb explosions on this planet.
They send out a group of scouts to make contact with this world they had
apparently missed the first time around. Once they get there, they discover
an advanced civilization, in the midst of 1950s style progress. They see
important looking buildings with stylized funny-looking symbols adorning
them, and they see folks with these same little symbols around their necks.
Finally, one of the scouts asks his guide what the symbol means. The guide
responds by telling them it represents the torture rack their saviour was
killed upon.

Interestingly enough, although that story never came under fire, another
story did during the days of the first "Comics Code", another one did. This
concerned a scout visiting a planet in a full-body space suit. He contacted
the planet\'s civilization and found that a dominant group of aliens with one
skin color were oppressing another group with another skin color. They wish
to become part of the interstellar community, but he tells them that unless
they start acting like civilized beings they can\'t be allowed to enter. He
gets back on his ship and flies away. When he gets a moment to relax he
takes off his space helmet and it turns out that he\'s black, and that he\'s
crying.

The first Comics Code authorities demanded that the character in the story
be changed to a white man. The folks at EC realized that the Comics Code
fellows had clearly missed the whole point of the story and they dropped out
of the organization.

Given standard Traveller technology, a star trigger probably _is_ a fusion catalyst.  There\'s a bad technobabble explanation in GT: BtC, but that can reasonably be ignored.

You can do it by integrating escape energies for the planet (which I did long ago) or approximate it by multiplying together escape energy (6e+7 J/kg) and mass (6e+24 kg) and applying a fudge factor because the inside needs less energy to escape, but for the current discussion I was just relying on a discussion of this which is left over from the GURPSnet archives: http://gurpsnet.sjgames.com/Archive/Space/planetbust2

4th order in diameter, for gravitational binding forces.  You\'ll start having to worry about non-gravitational binding forces below a few hundred kilometers, though.

yet. By what measurement? The only yardstick that matters . . . . . . LIFE.

     Over the past 200+ years, the USA has drawn to it people  who cared for
their own welfare first and the fruits of their mind and body a close second.
The net result of this freedom of mind and body is the most technologically
advanced, educated and well fed nation in the world. If the will of these free
producing people is to explore space, then that will happen in spades. While
some oppressive nations are trying to figure out how to keep it\'s populace from
fighting over the scraps it "gives" them, the free producing nation will be
spreading it\'s seeds to the stars. Human life will continue because individuals
chose it, not because a government demanded it.

      I do not deny the contributions of non-US citizens to space exploration.
Remember where most of those individuals go to do their work and get fairly
compensated for it. I do refuse to celebrate the successes of dictatorships or
socialists. They will plant a flag on alien soil and exalt the sacrifices of
those who got them there.

     I want to plant a flag on alien soil exalt the accomplishments of free will

I guess a classical Marxist, trying to explain the collapse of communism, would
say that the original revolutions in Russia and China were premature, since
they occurred in pre-industrial societies. Under communist rule, they became
more or less industrialised (less so as yet in China\'s case), and when the
economic system in Russia was relaxed to permit capitalism, bourgeois
structures asserted themselves as a matter of course (ie the answer is probably
yes). Taking the same view a similar thing would happen in China, when
capitalism became sufficiently mature.

And eventually a "proper" socialist revolution would also follow, at the point
where capitalism in turn implodes (this point has yet to be demonstrated
empirically ;-))

If you want to PBEM, go with CT, GT, or T4.1.

If you\'re going to run, pick whichever you can get the most of.

(Personally, I use MegaTraveller, with T4 Psionics, and a few other tweaks)

Hmm, when I was looking at getting a loan for a house, the application
terms were rather specific: The loan was in default if any of the following
occurred:
1) The house was not occupied by at least one of the cosignators as their
primary residence
2) Either of the cosignators lost their job and didn\'t find a new one in 30
days
3) any payment was more than 10 days late

This was through a low-income housing project, but it clearly requires that
both cosignators work, and that you must reside there; failing either, you
get evicted.

Ob trav: I can seem many ship loans having useage clauses: you have to be
engaged in making money, or else! Similar to subbies. One crew thought htey
were getting a deal when they only had to pay 10% down, until they realized
they had to spend 3 months per year on a back and forth run. The world
issuing the loans needed J2 traders to reach the main trade route, so they
subsidized type A-2\'s, 16 of them... at any given time, 4 are on route.
When the PC\'s showed up 2 days late for their "Duty", they found out about
the skip clause... Add either 1 year of run duty, pay off the ship
completely, or forfeit the ship.

Such indentures make for interesting moral, ethical, and play-ballance
issues for a group of PC\'s.

I\'ve peeked at Harold Hale\'s work, and done a little cross-checking of my
own.  The conclusion I\'ve drawn is that you just can\'t make assignments
of real-world stars to dots on the Solomani Rim map more than a few
parsecs from Sol.  Tau Bootis is out past the point where the
correspondence stops holding.

That having been said, I *think* Tau Bootis would be rimward of Sol.  It
might actually be in Aldebaran sector. . .

Survey team gamma finished decade on rimward survey of system 43288.  World

Examined ZS base remains in region designated 42-dag-LBR, found
no significant increase in TL (note: within STD of backwater minor races).

Languages all mutually unintelligible: deviation from STD significant.  Presence of

Custom writing systems without relationship to ZS, revolving around standard

Religions all derivable from typical ZS seeding from ancient to early ZS time periods.
Fertility, agricultural anxiety, and star people figure prominently.  Typical spread of

You\'ve been watcvhing too many *bad* SF movies and TV shows. Orbits
don\'t decay all by themselves. Objects orbiting inside the upper
fringes of a planet\'s atmosphere lose energy and drop to a lower orbit.
Ditto for "planetismals" inside the dust cloud a system forms from. 

But it\'s a *very* rare thing for a planetary orbit to decay. Ditto for
orbits of natural satellites.

Yes. Yes, to all of them. <g>

When playing in a PBEM you don\'t need access to a lot of mechanics,
you can depend on the GM for most of that. I have people in my
Traveller PBEM who have preferences for all the above, and I run it
very loosely with a mixture of rules. I think my players could tell
you which set I most favor, but they don\'t have to have that set of
rules to play, and if you asked them they\'d probably tell you I jump
all over the place, rule-wise. <g> OTOH, I play in a CT PBEM and an MT
PBEM, where the rules set is pretty obvious from how the GM runs
things, so, it can vary. IAC, any Traveller rules set is fine for
playing and any setting or background that you find interesting is
fine too.

About the various versions and all in my opinion...

If you liked CT, and want to keep playing CT then get Marc\'s reprints
when they are released and use CT.  Nothing wrong with CT, then or
now.  There isn\'t a rule for everything so you have to make it up on
the fly, but that just means it\'s closer to a "freeform rpg" which are
the rage now days. <g>

If you want to dig around you can find used copies of MT, which is
good, but filled with errata.  It is similar to CT in feel, but can
quickly get complicated. I like the concept of the task system, but
not how it was implemented...but that\'s just me. Like most things with
MT, some people love it, some hate it. You won\'t know how you feel
until you try it out.

If you liked Twilight 2000, then you\'ll like the TNE rules, but that
means using "other" dice, and some folks love their d6\'s.  The rules
don\'t "feel" like "real Traveller" to some people, but it does to
me...YMMV. BTW, you don\'t have to use the setting to use the rules,
and you don\'t have to use the rules to use the setting. <g>

If you like CT, but want a more streamlined game, get the main T4 book
and Marc\'s T4.1 extensions. Or even better, IMO, get Ken Bearden\'s
KBv2.0 rules for T4. Out of the box, T4 has some problems, but I still
think it had potential...again, YMMV.

If you like GURPS already, then Gurps: Traveller is what you should
get. If you don\'t like GURPS, then *some* of the GT books are still
good for background. If you don\'t know GURPS, then get the free GURPS
lite and see if you like it.

For setting, the CT reprints are going to be great when they make it
out. So, are the GRUPS books for the "no rebellion" timeline.  Finding
the MT and TNE settings books are harder, to be honest, and if you are
an oldtime player you might not want them anyway.

In the final analysis it doesn\'t matter what Traveller you get, or
play. Just that you play....and welcome back to the game. <g>

I guess a classical Marxist, trying to explain the collapse of communism, would
say that the original revolutions in Russia and China were premature, since
they occurred in pre-industrial societies. Under communist rule, they became
more or less industrialised (less so as yet in China\'s case), and when the
economic system in Russia was relaxed to permit capitalism, bourgeois
structures asserted themselves as a matter of course (ie the answer is probably
yes). Taking the same view a similar thing would happen in China, when
capitalism became sufficiently mature.

And eventually a "proper" socialist revolution would also follow, at the point
where capitalism in turn implodes (this point has yet to be demonstrated
empirically ;-))

Hey, follow a heretic\'s lead!  <g>

They are all Traveller and 
All Travellers are good!

Each version is different, but
Difference is spice.
Embrace the differences!

There are many settings.
Marvel at the settings.
Make the settings your own!

All Traveller is good and
We are *all* Travellers!

Now, if you included a complete set of errata to go along with them,
I\'d say that\'s a very good deal. <g>

Hmmm. my mortgage, a more conventional one, had nothing whatsoever in it
about automatically defaulting if someone lost their job. (Though
thinking about it, it does require us to live there; it\'s a residential
loan, not a commercial one)

Thinking of it, that a purely stupid, needless clause to put into a
mortgage unless the bank _likes_ reposessing houses. If you lose your
job, yet still pay the mortgage...what should the bank care?

If you don\'t pay the mortgage, then the late payment thing kicks
in...It\'s clearly simply a punitive clause; what happens in our
WONDERFUL, CAPITALISTIC, FREE society; if you\'re poor you\'re worth less,
and treated as such. Or is it worthless? (Jeez, my mortgae says I\'m in
default if I miss a payment, whcih means a month, and that\'s not
automatic if I tell the mortgage co. 

I have a friend who ran into some bad times (he learned the really hard
way what can go wrong if you\'re a _partner_ in a law firm :-( who was
something like ten months behind...he was working with the bank, though,
and managed to keep the place. It generally results in a loss for a
mortgage company to have to foreclose, by the time they go through the
associated costs of forclosing, repossesing and reselling the property;
even more so in bad ecom=nomic times.

(Sorry but there have been some _particularly_ trollerific jingoist
posts today that I\'m REALLY telling myself \'I will not reply...I will
not reply\'... already I\'ve trashed three or four ones that didn\'t get

Yes, a subsidized merchant _is_ going to have many restrictions on
it...make things more interesting: As the PC\'s go on they realize there
are two classes of sub traders in this system. A few mega\'s are getting
cheap, subsidized ships, and oddly, they seem to flout the rules that
the PC\'s have to follow...

Any number of scenarios go on from there from whitle blowing to the
local version of 60 minutes, to organizing the smaller subbies into
striking for fairer terms, to running with the ship (and looking over
their shoulders for the Repo man. The life of a Repo man is always
interesting.).

A ship loan in general is going to be a business based loan, though, and
you have to have a detailed business plan, and some estimate of earnings
in general to get a business loan, no matter what the business. It\'s
going to be different than a loan for a residence.

We\'re about to get into that in the AKUS game...we have a ship outright,
but there are some rather significant holes in it that will cost a few
megacredits to fix

Depending on the force mix, it could have been launched from the US (B-1, 
B-2, B-52) or by Naval Aviation off of carriers in the Adriatic.  Not quite 
as practical, but doable.
</Kurt>

Oh yeah.  Militarily doable.  Politically ?

My point sort of was that if everyone else had said "We don\'t want you to do this" and then the US had gone and done it, what would the consequences have been ?  In order for a nation to successfully exert it\'s will, it *must* have the co-operation of other powers.  In the case of both Kuwait and Kosovo (and others) when that will was exerted, it was with both the explicit and implicit compliance of other states.  If the pre-requisite for a superpower is that it must be able to exert it\'s will with or without the co-operation of other nations, then no-one has, as yet, achieved that status.

ObTrav : If we\'re using the above definition *solely* as the basis for deciding who is a superpower and who is not, then I suspect most of the major (and a couple of the minor) governments would qualify.  3I, Consulate, Hierate, etc.  Even possibly Arden and Darrian would qualify.

Yes, the US could have exerted its will in Kosovo or
Kuwait without the cooperation of other powers.  It
would not have gotten the same results, but the lack
of cooperation would not have been able to stop it
from bombing targets, landing troops, and inciting
insurrection.  

Lack of cooperation is different from active
opposition.  No superpower would be able to remain one
for long if all or most of the other countries were
actively opposed to its acts and policies.

I will agree that no one with the power to do so has
ever really had the will or desire to do so.

>I also submit that no-one has ever had the ability. 

Here we disagree.  The Cold War was not a bad dream. 
Both sides did have enough nuclear weapons to wipe out
all life on earth several times over.  Actually, that
capability still exists, but the reason for having it
(that mutual destruction would be assured) does not.

Yes and no. Anybody dealing with a more or less "closed" ecology is
*not* going to run perfectly good "complex organics" thru a fusion
torch. They\'ve got *way* too much time and energy invested in that
"complexity" to turn it back into raw elements without a *really* good
reason. 

But with "waste heat" from a fusion reactor, extracting the the water
from sewage and producing a dry, sterile "sludge" is fairly simple.
Well, actually, you cheat a bit on the "sterile" part. Either from the
reactor, or from a radioisotope source you expose the stuff to enough
gamma radiation to kill anything in it. 

The result is damn good fertilizer, or at least the first stage in
making such. 

The one thing that you\'ll see on ships and in closed environments is a
seperation between OWW (Organic Waste Water) and IWW (Industrial Waste
Water). And a lot of *household* stuff goes in the IWW category. Either
that, or there will be *severe* restrictions on what you can dump down
the drain and what you can use as a "cleaning compound".

This is because lots of chemicals *really* screw up reprocessing.
Especially strong acids/bases, bleaches, and even a lot of detergents.
They "poison" the sludge so it\'s not useful for fertilizer, except in
*massive* artifical marsh type sewage treatment systems.

Alas, it\'ll also be full of *unfriendly* ones. Like all the diseases
and parasites that any visitor may have had. That\'s why you sterilize
it and *then* inmnoculate it with the organisms you *want* it to have.

Still, it tends to be cheaper/simpler to just dry, sterilize and ship
the "sludge" that isn\'t needed/wanted locally.

Now we know the _real_ reason the ZS fell...communications ground to a
halt because the bureaucrats were too busy typing out 388 character
e-mail addresses, and replying to the people who had sent them mail in
error by typing a D instead of an S in the 376th place...;-)

Whoa!

You appear to be suffering from a common misconception. It\'s not
*possible* to keep things like nukes "secret" if they *ever* get used,
and it\'s fairly unlikely even if they *don\'t* get used. 

The scientific method ensures that if you ask the universe a question,
you get a truthful answer. So, once you *know* something can be done, a
research program *will* find out *how* it can be done. Period.

<Bits snipped>

</Shadow>

I\'d have to say I agree with the first of the above statements but not the second.  Two different (and seperate) entities seeking the solution to the same problem will come up with two seperate solutions.  Witness the response to AIDS several years ago.  When it first appeared in NY and San Francisco roughly simultaneously, doctors in both places came up with different solutions for keeping their patients alive, and explained the cause and transmission differently.

It may be that one group/individual who happens to be a leading light in the field has decided that \'it\' can\'t be done.  As he/she/it/they are the acknowledged expert, the rest of the population goes "Oh, well, fair enough" and \'it\' doesn\'t get done.  So, there may have been an enterprising Vagr scientist




The *only* reason the Germans didn\'t get the bomb was that (depending
on who you believe) either a research dropped a couple of decimal
points when calculating critical mass from the results of an early
experiment, or he *deliberately* fudged the result. Either way, they
wound up thinking that it\'d take *tons* of material to go critical. So
they figured a bomb was impossible. Anybody who *knows* bombs are
possible would take one look at that result and recheck the figures and
find the mistake.

Please note that of the more than a dozen countries with nuclear
capability, the evidence points to every single one of them succeeding
in getting a working bomb on the *first* try. 

Nukes are incredibly simple, and anybody that knows the physics behind
a fusion reaction can figure out that a fission reaction is possible,
and enough of the parameters to start research on building a reactor or
a bomb. And given a reasonable amount of time and resources, they\'ll
*succeed*. It only takes massive resources if you are in a hurry. 

So anybody over TL 5 or 6 (too lazy to check the books :-) can build a
nuke. It\'s no more "restricted" a technology than gunpowder and other
explosives. 

In fact, nukes are likely seen as merely a bigger bang, with some
unfortunate side effects. They may actually get used (along with damper
tech "clean-up") in some large civil engineering projects. 

I expect that the "no nukes" rule in warfare is actually no "weapons of
mass destruction". No taking out cities just because there was an
observation post in it.

I guess a classical Marxist, trying to explain the collapse of communism, would
say that the original revolutions in Russia and China were premature, since
they occurred in pre-industrial societies. Under communist rule, they became
more or less industrialised (less so as yet in China\'s case), and when the
economic system in Russia was relaxed to permit capitalism, bourgeois
structures asserted themselves as a matter of course (ie the answer is probably
yes). Taking the same view a similar thing would happen in China, when
capitalism became sufficiently mature.

And eventually a "proper" socialist revolution would also follow, at the point
where capitalism in turn implodes (this point has yet to be demonstrated
empirically ;-))

Not much of a threat overall, assuming they stayed on the right side of the
Megacorporations. As long as they support the Pax Imperium, and allow Tukera
and company to operate freely (including resisting the temptation to
nationalise megacorporate assets) they\'re OK - you can see from looking at the
UPP data for the various sectors that the Imperium isn\'t really concerned how
authoritarian particular governments are. But the megacorporations are stronger
than individual worlds, so they also get a strong say. To that extent the
Imperium is a corporatist state along the lines propounded by Mussolini and his
chums.

Note this is for worlds with longstanding internal arrangements. How does the
Imperium respond to local revolutions?

In terms of the tendency of individual worlds to revolution, and looking at the
way the Imperial economy worked, you\'d have to look at those worlds which
combine high exploitation (ie responsible for a lot of manufacture) with a high
level of immiseration (represented by a low tech level?). On those lines,
Industrial worlds with low tech levels would be bearing the brunt of Imperial
era capitalism, and be most prone to periodic revolutions. If those revolutions
disrupted supply to other local worlds, or threatened strong off-world
interests (back to the Megacorps) then the Imperium might be tempted to
intervene.

I accept the point but the crux of the Christian service is the wine 
/ bread re-enactment of the Last Supper (\'this is my body\', \'this is 
my blood\') which is shared between the participants. This could be 
easily misunderstood/misrepresented. And - although the justification 
came later - attendees at the service would claim that the bread and 
wine were transubstantiated into the body and blood, supporting any 
suspicions.

Bear in mind that the split which occurred during the reformation 
drove the Catholic and Othodox wings of the Church deeper into 
sacramental tradition, whereas the reformed Church focused on 
Scripture over the Sacraments. Both sides lost something...

BTW I thought that Mark\'s Gospel was recorded somewhere around the AD 
70s/80s, before the others?

I agree, but the point that I was making was that projection of power 
in such situations does rely on the co-operation of local states, 
without which the operation could not take place without a high cost 
in men and material.

I haven\'t seen any recent interpretations of this question so I won\'t
dispute them.
My point was that germany was required to pay reparations which made alot
of germans angry with the peace for that reason. Then the depression hapened
and one of the things that depened the depresion in germany was the
reparations
payments. Which led to civil unrest and the virtual coups that installed the
Nazi
regime.

The second point I had was that *if* germany had been occupied after ww1
things
might have worked out differently. My oppologies if I failed to make myself
understood.

Works for me!

One of the few things in sci-fi that bugs me more than Yanks in Space
Syndrome is Yanks Imagining Samurai/Jinshi in Space Syndrome.  I mean, get
real!  First of all, on a purely practical note, everyone knows that Yanks
are going to come out ahead every time, so it\'s hardly credible.  Then you
add in the problem that people are dealing with half-understood
"orientalist" stereotypes they don\'t even think about the ramifactions
of...  Well, anyway, Turks in space sounds like a good compromise.

Comrade!

Despite the best attempts of the craven opposition to deflect the OTU into
a parallel universe where the Sayat are unable to link up with Baddies
from the Core, Virus, and other progressive elements, soon the running
tree-dogs of the noble and megacorporate classes will be roasting on spits
while the newly liberated working sophonts of the Imperium rejoice and
reload.

The only condition necessary for this is the creation of a GURPS:
Traveller "race template" for the Sayat.

We leave this in the capable hands of inevitability.

My apologies for a late reply to this thread.

Steven said:
>>Also see "The Circus" from E. E. "Doc" Smith\'s "Family d\'Alembert" series:
[snip]
>>In terms of the nobility and empire background, the series is very

My copy of "The Imperial Stars", the first volume of the Family d\'Alembert
decalogue, is copyright 1976. Even the 4th book goes back to 1977.

Stephen Goldin is listed as "co-author", but I agree - I have a feeling that he
is doing more than that. Probably compiling and expanding from a basic skeleton
of "Doc\'s" ideas.

Traveller dates from 1977. The nobility and royal family were determined some
time after that.

Here are some similarities between the d\'Alemberts and Traveller (Methinks a
"tip o\'the hat" to the series?):

a. Names

Family d\'Alembert        Traveller
- ----        ----
Emperor Stanley          Emperor Strephon
Empress Irene            Empress Iolanthe
Crown Princess Edna      Grand Princess Ciencia

Oh - and only the one heir, so that:
     (i) she knows she would inherit (and therefore not think about ways to get
rid of her father), and
     (ii) to prevent sibling rivalry over the throne.

b. Nobility

Here\'s what the first book says about the nobility:

"As one of her principled reforms, Empress Stanley Five imposed on society the
formal hierarchical structure still in use today. Given the fact that
stratification was inevitable in any social system, she elected to introduce the
arrangement that had served mankind the longest - that of hereditary
nobility(*). Her logical mind took what was essentially a chaotic state of
affairs and, in a sense, standardised it. All inhabited space was divided into
thirty-six Sectors, with Earth considered to be the centre of the sphere. Each
Sector is ruled by a Grand Duke, and may contain hundreds of planets. Single
planets are ruled by dukes. Marquises rule continents or the equvalent thereof.
Earls rule over what would previously have been considered states or small
nations., Counts rule countries. Barons - the lowest ranking nobility - rule
cities or districts."
E. E. "Doc" Smith (with Stephen Golding), "The Imperial Stars", Granada
Publishing Ltd, UK, 1976, p 79.

(*) Hey Jeff, here\'s another argument in favour of the nobility!

c. Cover Art

Chris Foss did the cover art for the series AND for T4. In fact, some of the the
same pictures are used, as follows:

Book 5: The Bloodstar Conspiracy     T4 Book G: Missions of State
Book 10: Revolt of the Galaxy        T4 Book ?: Gateway (Long Way Home Pt 2)

Oh yeah, and in all cases, the cover pics bear no relationship to the contents.
;-)

d. Equal Fights

There is no discrimination between the abilities of Jules and Yvette (an ideal
upheld in Traveller character creation, as opposed to AD&D\'s weaker women -
something, BTW, my gaming group *never* followed). Both are heavy-worlder
gymnasts, just as capable as each other. Oh, the *only* difference is that Jules
is the only thousand-pointer currently alive, while Yvette "only" scored 999 (on
S.O.T.E.\'s thousand-point ability test).

e. Scope

They keep saying "The Galaxy", but they don\'t actually mean it. The Empire
really has only as many (or maybe even less) systems than the Imperium\'s "11,000
Worlds".



Finally, the series is a masterpiece for all you conspiracy lovers. The whole
thing deals with the heroes and heroines uncovering the conspiracy, one piece at
a time. Even things that don\'t appear to be part of the conspiracy (eg. book 2,
"Strangler\'s Moon") are eventually tied in!

...and those who play TNE may find it interesting, as well. ;-)

(You\'ve now got me re-reading the series, blasters, stunners, nitrobarb and
all!)

Old JTAS Amber Zone - the parcel contains a vase belonging to a religious sect.
The sect deems it OK to see the vase if you are a sect member, but anyone else
who sees the thing must be killed.

If you haven\'t opened the parcel and just give it to them, they will be happy
and go away. OTOH, if you open it and look at the vase, you\'ll suddenly gain a
Recurring Enemy who\'ll chase you across the Imperium.

Not bad for GM\'s who want to create a permanent "push".

No, with that definition none of the Traveller
governments could qualify -- that was exactly my
point.  Are the Hivers, for example, able to exert any
direct influence on Zhodani space?  Can the Imperium
exert any direct influence on the rimward portion of
the Solomani Confederation?  It just takes too much
time for forces to go anywhere, unlike on a single
world, where everything is in short striking distance
of everywhere else.  

Within its own borders, each major interstellar state
may function like a superpower, but not with respect
to the other powers.

I thought about it, but there\'s one big problem:
If you stick with 11000 worlds arranged in approximately a sphere the travel
time from Core to, say, the Spinward Marches is only a few weeks.  The
alternative is if you decide on a transit time of, say, 1-2 years you get an
empire of tens of millions of systems.

Neither of these seems to work with the CT Imperium background material.

I also tried to think up some reason why \'Jump Space\' might be 2
dimensional, but I couldn\'t get anything I was happy with.  A 3d->2d mapping
doesn\'t work well.

My take is that since the Pacification Campaigns, especially the abortive
Antarean Campaign, the Imperium has realised that this sort of thing doesn\'t
work that well. It\'s not good economics, for one thing.

Since the Alkhalikoi dynasty has been in power, all the Imperium does is
increase diplomatic pressure, up to and including Red Zoning the system (part of
which included destroying the world\'s starships and ship building facilities, if
any). This quarantines the world from interstellar trade, which Far Trader
suggests is necessary for the world to survive and rise in TL. Naturally, it
works better on some worlds than others - Ag worlds can hold out better than
Vacc worlds, for example. Some worlds even prefer not to rise in TL - oh well,
they\'re not going to produce a lot of tax, in any event.

The Imperium takes the long view, that the world will, sooner or later, decide
to rejoin and petition for a removal of the interdiction.

This policy works for the odd one or two worlds that try it. A concerted effort
to leave the Imperium by a group of worlds hasn\'t occurred yet - at least, not
until the Rebellion... ;-)

...then the policy changes to the Black War scenario, which is (really) what you
have all already suggested would be the final outcome...

	According to the History Channel, the man who invented the modern
firearm cartridge (an ordained minister) was convinced it was too
horrific to ever be used in combat. He only wanted to be able to hunt
ducks--seems the old flintlocks had a measurable delay between
pulling the trigger, the flint coming down and igniting the powder in
the pan, and the main charge going off to fire the bullet. Darn ducks
would hear the lock click and take off ...

Kyle writes: perhaps we could adjust the definition of
a superpower to, "without another power\'s
co-operation, providing that there is no widesporead
opposition." That is, if you are a superpower, "those
who not against us are with us." To be truly neutral
and "non-interventionist" means to make the strong
stronger, the weak weaker. 
I can\'t imagine any nation ever being powerful enough
that its enemies and rivals, united, couldn\'t defeat
it. But just as one bully may scare twety classmates
who, together, could easily beat him up... who wants
to be the first to step forward and say, "hey, bully!
cut that out!" And if the bully is a benevolent ruler,
only demanding you let him sell you Coca-Cola and
episodes of "Friends," well, you might put up with
him...        
Of course nations _can_ contest the USA\'s power. But
no-one does, really.

So I went back to the source post to check:

Sorry Chris, I missed that. I really thought you were talking about the
near-c things and addressed my response accordingly. I musta been having
a bad day.

Chris again:
>Why would rules against using big rocks be in place between interstellar

Both energy ortillery and deadfall ordnance are, I think, accepted canon.
Deadfall ordnance is (basically) the same as dropping rocks from orbit. The
old "smart rock" concept. Your big rocks are just bigger ordnance. Apart
from the (again practical) problems with moving large rocks, there would
appear to be no problems with using them. - Your point I think?

However, the Imperial rule against using weapons of mass destruction would
apply to using really BIG rocks, but not to the smaller deadfall ordnance.
So the question becomes; At what point do weapons become weapons of
*mass* destruction? Just how big a rock can you drop? I can\'t fully
answer this one; perhaps it\'s covered by a treaty between superpowers;
perhaps there is an arbitrarily set limiting size (mass); more likely in
the Imperium, though, the decision would be made AFTER the fact whether
the force used was appropriate or not.

And:

I think my point about the IRA covers this. Sure you could use really heavy
weapons against a planet without killing yourself in the process. But that
will make you very unpopular with a lot of people. Like anyone from the
planet. Like any megacorp with interests there. Like any noble (and their
supporters) who have an interest there. This would apply to planets even
outside the Imperium, which will have trade with and megacorporation assets
from within the Imperium. So the Imperium is unlikely to use weapons of
mass destruction against either it\'s own sophonts or any of the races
with which it deals.

As to the other races, even if they do not trade with the Imperium, they
would probably not use weapons of mass destruction against worlds in
the Imperium because they fear that both the Imperium and other races
would retaliate in kind.

SO FAR all the races found in the OTU have (for whatever reason) found it
to be in their own best interest to generally conduct wars without resorting
to weapons of mass destruction. At least, I don\'t recall anything in canon
that says they have. That does not preclude it from happening. Indeed, that
may be what the Zhodani et al found so disturbing about the Empress Wave -
perhaps they saw a race that was prepared to destroy without any inhibitions.

Hey!  I\'m not accusing *anybody* in particular, just pointing out

that\'s always concerned me: the huge cost of Traveller

businesses either start in credit (having savings to
invest), or expect/hope to clear their original loan
within 10 years, and make a living in the meantime. 

Naturally, those that succeed don\'t take the extra
thousands a month they\'ve got from having paid off the
loan and just spend it, they expand their business...
(get a better ship?)

Obviously when natural lifetimes are longer at higher
TLs, you\'ll be willing to have debt for longer, but
still! T4 gives 40 years as the typical time...
sheesh! If you need 20% down, why would you get that
brand new 20 MCr ship when you could get a second-hand
"engineer\'s dream" for 2 MCr?

Finally, I never bought the business of "we have ways
of making you pay." How does a bank foreclose on a
mortgage if the residence has Jump-3? And I don\'t want
to hear about transponders and "late payment messages
stopping the engine." If an engineer put it there,
another engineer can remove it!

The only vaguely plausible one I heard, it was a sci
fi story, for the loan the ship captain had had his
spleen removed and replaced with an artificial one
which would decay in six months, unless he returned to
the world to make his payments...

My pyramid article of itself is _not_ canon (it was specifically noted as
"one interpretation"). However, portions of the material in the article were
used as the basis for the sidebar on the Ine Givar in Behind the Claw, so
I guess those parts could be regarded as canon for GT. However, thats
about as far as it goes.

IMTU, it\'s fairly simple: Banks won\'t finance J5 or J6 ships. Period. J4\'s
will only be financed when there is a viable collateral OTHER THAN THE SHIP.

J3 ships require a good buisiness plan, and while anything put in can be
removed or replaced, if you can\'t outrun the news, you\'d better keep the
payments in line. Most of the "Pirates" (by cgen career) are actually skip
tracers most of the time, starmercs when needed, and privateers when
available. The banks tend to send J-4 messages when a ship makes it\'s
payments, to all payment acceptance stations within 2 months hard travel
from point of payment. Most worlds maintain lists of ships in the area; if
a ship is more than two months out by local computations, they prepare a
skip alert... Not that they announce the ship has skipped, but that customs
needs to check for papers (if the law level allows) or the bank hires a
skip tracer to "take a look"; most (almost all) ship financing allows the
banks\' local agent to inspect or authorize inspection by their deputy as
"part owner". If the agent finds proof of payment, fine, he\'s got to leave.
Otherwise, including if the crew refuses access to the papers and/or ship
after seeing appropriate credentials, the agent may reposess the ship "On
suspicion". I only did this to a PC group once... it ended the campaign
(They wound up confined to an imperial prison world, since the note holder
was the Imperial Government, and the "Tracer" was an IMOJ field agent...
whom they shot.)

Since I use the "pirates" as skip tracers, it gives reason for banks to
subsidize or even finance pirate vessels... field authorizations! And a
letter or Marque and Reprisal, with clauses allowing inspection of records
of vessels financed by a given bank, or government, and siezure if not able
to prove current payments. That, and the pirates keeping tabs on skip
reports.

David,

Much of my first campaign had roots in these books! Thanks for the reminder,
now to dig them out!

Oh, by the way, I thought it was common knowledge that \'Doc\' Smith was dead
well before these books came out. Apparently Stephin Goldin gained
permission (ither from \'Doc\' Smith himself, or from his estate) to write
several series based on never published notes (Similar to Jerry Pournelle\'s
arrangement with H. Beam Piper, permission to write in the same universe and
use characters from it. This was also the basis for the the follow up novels
to the Lensman series, one was something like \'The Dragon Lensman\'. These
were to take the secondary, unattached Lensmen characters mentioned in the
first books and follow their adventures. I think only three books were ever
published, and, unlike the "Family d\'Alembert" series, didn\'t have the
"feel" of a \'Doc\' Smith book.

Yep, just checked one of my few available reference books. E.E. \'Doc\' Smith
passed away on August 31, 1965. More than a decade before Stephen Golden
captured his intent (if not his exact style) in the "Family d\'Alembert"
series.

One other bit of trivia, the copies of the books I have (that I now HAVE to
dig out) didn\'t have Foss covers, but originals that coinsided with the
stories. Were yours published in Europe by any chance?

Well, I just did a crude calc for a famous SF vessel. I come up with a
*minimum* of over 500e15 (500 *quadrillion*) m^3. Or about 40
quadrillion dTons. And it was likely more than double that. 

Question. At what TL can *one* person run such a vessel?

a hard and loooong fight; years and years of fun for the

Haviland Tuf\'s _Ark_, perhaps?  (If not, I\'ll see what figures I can
come up with for _Ark_.  Such a useful vessel....)

At whatever TL the plot requires.  ;-)

Seriously, one of the quibbles I have about the various ship design
sequences in Traveller is that one gains no extra benefit from
increasing the number of computers (over the required number) linked
into ship operations.  Perhaps for each additional doubling of computing
power, the crew requirement could be halved.

Feedback, anyone?

Heck, if I lose my job, the bank will pay the mortgage for me for three
months, and if I\'m still not working , put the mortgage on hold for up to
twelve months, and I only have to live in the house for part of the year.

Also, the bank is quite willing to wait for it\'s mortgage payment if we hit
a "temporary cash flow problem" as it were.

Sounds like William really needs to get a better bank.

What if you don\'t use a sphere?  How about a saucer shape?  Out here in
the spiral arm, the galaxy is not as thick as at the center (but it
might be so thick that a sphere would be the only realistic shape for
known space).

You know, I\'m beginning to have nightmares that twenty years from now I\'ll
be a famous game designer, and people will still come up to me at GenCon
and call me "The Penguin Guy."

Also, ACQ was co-written by James Lindsay, who is only partially under the

	Hi, Seth.  No, I mean *helpless*.  If they have anything that\'ll
shatter a starship, then they have something that will shatter a rock.
Keep in mind, you can target fighters with spinal mounts, so even a 10-ton
rock is open season for a deep meson site.  Particularly a deep meson site
with nothing else to fire at.
	Now, if you are doing energy weapon bombardment, you are correct.
All you need is range.  Until you try and deploy your landing craft...

And you know that you need to play _more_ Traveller if you didn\'t
understand Doug\'s comment....

(I hear that, after the Rams beat the 49ers for the second time this
season [the first time since 1980 that the Rams have swept the \'Niners],
the 49ers decided to replace the "SF" on their helmets with "GK.")

I think I read somewhere that those two rocks that orbit Mars are in
decaying orbits, and that one of them I can\'t remember which has a date with
the planets surface, I think though it is the closer of the two.

Then theres that large rock Luna I think its called which is actually
spiralling away from its primary Earth I believe, but this will be solved
when the hyperspace bypass is built necessitating the removal of Earth.

The good news is that I believe Andy Lilly is in the final throes of
putting together _The Traveller Bibliography_ (Second Edition) which will
not only tell you about all the BITS books thre are but will, in fact, tell
you all about every Traveller book ever (including the novels that are
being discussed in another thread).  Don\'t miss that BITS book....  ;-)
An excellent read in its own right.

IIRC, the Moon would[1] continue to spiral away for about 50 billion years
(the rate is about cm/year?) until the Earth is tidally locked to it
and then return (at an equally slow rate) until it impacts.

I think that Leonard was referring to orbital decay in a period of
days, weeks or months being bad SF. Even a satellite orbitting at a few
hundred miles gives years of notice.

What\'s the list\'s view on this?

I mean, can secret conspiracies to associate someone with penguin throwing

That\'s a mighty big ship, especially for just one person. The only
published SF example I can think of -- great big huge ship, one
person running it -- is the ecological seedship run by Haviland Tuf
in George R.R. Martin\'s "Tuf Voyaging".

No we don\'t! :-)

ObTrav: In my copious spare time (not!) I\'ve been trying to build the ships
from FSotSI with GT. Yes, I know the ships in there are broken (the CA-15 I
have been working on has a crew of 1079 but a frozen watch of 12!), but I
am trying to go with the spirit of the designs rather than the actual stats.

One thing I have run straight head on into is streamlining. Many Imperial
warships are streamlined, so as to scoop fuel from gas giants. However,
streamlining in GT takes away a whopping 20% of the ships internal volume.
At first I felt I understood the reasoning behind this (wasted space that
is too small/awkwardly shaped to be used for anything else). However, the
more I think about it, the less I am in agreement -- especially on larger
ships.

For example, take the 100,000 dton CA-15 -- a big, streamlined cone. By GT,
20% of this cone is unusable because of streamlining. Now where, I ask, is
this wasted space at? Surely on the scale of a 100,000 dton, even the nose
cone of the vessel would be large enough to be used for something.

It occurs to me in writing this that the streamlining penalty on volume may
be an abstraction to simulate the volume differences between a box on a
certain length and surface area and, say, a wedge. By this thinking, a
100,000 dton cone is not *really* 100,000 dton in volume, but is as long
and wide at it\'s largest dimension and has the same surface area as a box
of that size. But this seems like an unnecessary abstraction -- why not
just use configuration modifiers (as has been the tradition in other
versions of Traveller).

If someone could make a good case for the GURPS Vehicles/Traveller way of
handling streamlining, I\'d like to hear it.

This is, in fact, correct.  It\'s also a reasonable approximation of the difficulty of _storing_ streamlined objects, which are generally not terribly good shapes to put into vehicle bays and the like.

The reasoning for doing in it GT is mostly that that\'s the way GURPS Vehicles handles streamlining.  However, a point worthy of note is that an unstreamlined ship in GT would be called \'partially streamlined\' in other rules systems; a streamlined ship is what FF&S would call \'airframe\'.

The *best* case that could be made is that GURPS: Vehicles is *not*
traditional Traveller. That is, the Vehicle design system was in existence
and in use before Traveller was ported to the GURPS system.

On the other hand, I personally tend to chalk up the loss in space to both
"waste space", and special structural design modifications. I\'m not an
aerospace engineer in real life, so I don\'t know if such reasoning is
justified.

 In FF&Sv2 (The T4 version) this is accomplished by setting the degree of 
interconnectedness between systems. The raw computing power aboard isn\'t 
nearly as important unless you introduce robotics to actually replace 
crewsophonts (unlikely in the TNE setting; quite possible in the CT setting).

This is a common mathematical  problem  called  "packing".  Given
fixed dimension items such as standard height  deck  squares  its
true that a portion of internal volume will be wasted in  awkward
shapes.  However, there are 2 important factors missed out here:

First, there is something called (I believe)  "gradation",  which
basically means that the smaller the internal objects  *relative*
to the area/volume they are to be  packed  in  the  less  overall
waste.  In other words the  larger  the  ship  the  smaller  this
percantage should be.

Second, some items to be packed do *not*  have  fixed  dimensions
(but do have fixed volumes) ... such as fuel  tanks.  These,  and
other items, can  be  packed  into  most  of  this  wasted  space
provided the architect is competant.

The GURPS:Vehicles method  of  20%  loss  works  okay  for  small
vehicles such as ground cars and aircraft but does not make sense
for larger vehicles.

The non-G:T Traveller method of modiifers (explained as  external
equipment cowlings, structural reinforcement,  and  airosurfaces)
is okay for medium sized vehicles (eg. the Kinunir).

But IMHO large vehicles  such  as  dreadnaughts  and  battleships
would be  so  unstable in  an  atmosphere  that  streamlining  is
pointless.

A quick fix would be to have the GURPS:Vehicles  percentage  vary
with overall volume ... becoming smaller and smaller  the  larger
the vehicle.  For added flavour this could be improved by a  task
roll against the architect\'s skill.

I understand this, but that extra 20% makes a huge difference. In the
CA-15, its about 2Gs of manuever capability and a bunch of armor.

As Anthony pointed out, "unstreamlined" hulls in GT are what traditional
Traveller called partially streamlined, and "streamlined" hulls are
airframes. So tell me ... should there be a "partially streamlined"
category in GT to represent Traveller streamlined ships?!?

What exasperates me about this is that GV doesn\'t even use the Traveller
classifications "unstreamlined, partially streamlined, streamlined," or
"airframe." Instead, a vehicle is either streamlined or it isn\'t, with
several levels of streamlining available.

So *why not* name it like it is? IMHO, unstreamlined in GT should be just
that: a hull with no streamlining. Streamlined hulls in GT should have
basic streamlining, and not airframes. Airframes (and partially streamlined
hulls) should be seperate categories.

Hopefully this will be addressed in the upcoming goodies from SJG.

And it seems to me that Peter\'s comments on "gradation" should be taken
into account when figuring streamlining for large hulls.

The extra volume is only significant because jump drives are volume-based.  If you were to specify that only internal spaces count for jump drive mass (or to be even simpler, are used for jump fuel computations) most of the problems people complain about would go away.

Nope.  Per GV, any GT ship not specifically designed otherwise is capable of entering atmosphere (which means only an idiot builds streamlined merchants, but...).  The difference is that with less than the level of streamlining which is considered \'streamlined\' per GT, they must move at subsonic speeds (or disintegrate) while in atmosphere.

To be honest, most \'streamlined\' CT designs are basically unstreamlined, judging by the illustrations.

As the \'streamlining\' volume for a ship is actually outside the hull, no, not really.

    'body' => 'Howdy folks.  I\'ve got here a new can \'o worms, and I want to
open it up.  It concerns the potential difference between political
and cultural boundaries, sort of.

Ask a Traveller player where the Spinward Marches is, and show
her a map, and most likely she can figure it out if she doesn\'t already
know.

Fine.  Now ask a native of the Aramis subsector (or District 268, or
Five Sisters) where the Spinward Marches is, and he might say his
region isn\'t really "the same as" the rest of the Marches.  In short, a
border area might claim a bit of individuality that separates it from the
sector\'s core.

Frontier gives way to wilderness on one side and civilization on the
other... and location has an effect on its inhabitants.

So then, an exercise to the reader would be to take a close look at
the Spinward Marches and pick out the areas that, quite frankly,
don\'t really fit the mold... if there even is a mold for this sector.
Where do their cultural ties rest?

Now, I wouldn\'t suggest this kind of exercise for, say, Deneb,
because they\'ve only got one Imperial border.  But the Marches
might have clusters that prefer Deneb worlds, or might be solid
Marches supporters, or might be only marginal.

What do you think?

This is only an exercise.  If it doesn\'t go anywhere, that\'s fine.

Can you imaging how valuable the charcoal gas (like coke gas from coal)
could be from such plants?  Bake the wood and distill the gas for use as a
high octane fuel.  Depending upon its chemical properties, it might even be
possible to leach out the anti-fungal agent(s) and re-use them, perhaps
rendering the wood stock usable for building.  Such a process might require
pulping, but he pulp could be "glued" back together creating a building
material that would be stronger than ordianary wood.

PC ships may (often) be, but as usual, PCs are not typical.  Ask anyone
who has started his or her own business; the initial years (and often the
years after that) consist of 18-hour days and a constant struggle to keep
things in (or even near) the black.  Remember that a majority of new
businesses fold within two years.

The various trade systems are rather well-balanced with the cost of
shipping to make bulk cargo- and passenger-hauling by small ships a slow
path to bankruptcy.  This is both intentional and realistic; there\'s no
way 200-dton tramps are going to compete head-to-head with Tukera on
moving bulk machine parts along the Spinward Main.  Small merchants
succeed (if they do so) by filling niches the majors don\'t or can\'t
address -- charters, speculative cargoes, service to backwaters, that sort
of thing.  Adventure seeds, in other words. :)

Look at it this way:  Any mature business sector in a capitalist society
is going to be \'marginal\' (in the technical sense).  If ships were
cheaper, more of them would be operated until shipping prices fell to the
point that revenues were again hovering near the break-even point.

> Most businesses either start in credit (having savings to invest),

If the characters have alternate sources of capital, there\'s nothing to
stop them from arranging a shorter-term loan with a larger down payment,
or even purchasing a ship outright.

> or expect/hope to clear their original loan within 10 years, and make a
> living in the meantime. 

Not usually true.  Business investments may be amortized over spans of
decades.  And making a living is a separate (though related issue. 
Basically, for a privately-held business, you take your net revenue, pay
your operating expenses, service your debt, pay your minimal living
expenses, and then take what\'s left and either give yourself a bonus,
re-invest it in improving the business, or (most commonly) some mix of the
two. 

Note that a merchant company/ship which is doing well will probably be
able to refinance ship loans under more favorable credit terms.

Or hire broker services on key worlds, or improve the current ship(s), or
establish permanent facilities, or...

Again, in a free market prices will tend to equilibrate at the point where
the total expected cost of ownership and book value for these correlate to
the asking price.  If the 2MCr ship is a net better bargain, demand for it
will rise, and sellers will raise their prices accordingly.

How do finance companies foreclose on cars which can drive away at high
speed?  You catch them when they\'re parked.

No, it doesn\'t require tech wizardry.  Your ship puts down on Regina, and
during the week you\'re arranging cargo, a repo agent scanning the arrivals
list matches your transponder ID against the skip list, and files a notice
of repossession with the courts and port master.  She\'s worked on knowing
the right people and processes to expedite this.  Two days later the
impound docs are approved.  The first you know about it is when she (and a
few port security folks) walk up to the ship, ask to speak with the owner,
and hand you a thick envelope full of intimidating-looking legal papers.

Now you\'ll probably get a hearing with an admin judge, who will determine
that you\'re in default and give you 3 days to have personal belongings off
the ship.  Alternatively, you can take off without permission, blow
through the TCA and orbital traffic pattern, and run for it.  Now you\'ve
gone from being a deadbeat to being a wanted high-level felon (you
endangered a lot of lives, doing that, and stole the finance company\'s
property).  On some worlds, local air or space units may shoot at you if
they\'re positiioned well to do so on your way to jump.

Not a good thing.

So if you decide to skip, or if you\'ve done the break-and-run option
above, your only real hope is to go far, far, *far* away, outside Imperial
space.  While getting there you must avoid any legitimate starport, patrol
cruisers, and so forth.   Depending on how far you are from the border,
and which border that is, your chances range from poor to nonexistent.
Alternatively, you can \'go pirate\' -- stay inside the Imperium, perhaps
near your original area of operations, but operate clandestinely, avoiding
all contact with authorities (and civilians looking for reward money).
Again, I\'d have to say your odds of lasting long aren\'t good, especially
after that jump core failure that could be fixed in two days at a Class-A
port, but...

11000 stars at a concentration of 1 per 2 cubic parsecs would only be a
distance of 17 parsecs from the core to the edge.  Even allowing for
non-spherical shapes and lower stellar densities I can\'t imagine a radius of
more than maybe 30 parsecs.  I think the galactic disk is 1000-1500 parsecs
thick in the region of the sun.  The galaxy is a big place.

Given the rather huge size of the galaxy, is there anything else out there?
For starters, the Zhodani sent expeditions most of the way to the galactic
core.  Did they really discover no other major powers?

What you are missing is that there are 3 different categorizations, and
different methods in use through the various editions.
CT/Bk2	CT/HG		MT/FF&S		GT
USL	USL		USL		-	No Atm
- -	PSL		SL		USL
SL	SL		AF		SL	Can glide

USL= Unstreamlined
PSL=Partially Streamlined
SL= Streamlined
AF= AirFrame

Each different set used the terms differently. In FF&S1, there is a waste
volume penalty for AF designs. In GURPS, there is a penalty for SL designs,
which ARE MT/TNE/T4 Airframe designs.

Well, it depends.  If you drop all the M-class stars and use relatively realistic star densities you get a 50-60 parsec radius.  If you assume that only 10% of all those systems are reasonably inhabitable you get a 100-150 parsec radius.  On the other hand, a J-1 ship is likely to be unable to reach anywhere interesting with real star densities; with 10% of worlds being useful, you need to jump an average of 10 parsecs to reach another habitable world...

Any way you go about it, if jump-1 can reach an average of 2 stars, and Jump-6 is 6x as far, jump-6 will be able to reach an average of 400 stars, and the entire imperium should be about jump-20 across.  One option is to make J-6 not be 6x as far -- call it 3.5x as far and it doesn\'t reach that many more stars than a standard J-6 ship.

Hm, well, not that valuable, since I stole the idea from something

only good for making flutes.

Flammable != high octane. There are plenty of things that burn
that also make lousy fuel. Roof tar, for example. The substance
secreted by these trees would probably be something like tree sap
with a lot of oil in it - Eucalyptus trees, for example, are
really oily and a forest fire in Australia is apparently something
pretty severe, even compared to a "regular" forest fire. Heck, the
Blue Montains are blue due to the high content of eucalyptus oil
vapour in the air (or so I\'m told).

You\'d probably get a better fuel pulping the trees and fermenting
them to make methanol. Methanol kicks ass.

Sure. I mean, it would depend on how valuable the stuff was to 
someone other than the tree. Normal tree sap is pretty useless
(unless you\'re at TL 2 I assume). Most "natural" products that
need to be harvested in quantity are cheaper to produce synthetically,
like rubber or ASA. Once you figure out what the anti-fungal
agent is, you can probably create it cheaper in a lab/industrial 
process.

Rober asked about Whanga\'s sun though... from the Spinward Marches 
Campaign, it\'s actually a binary system, with the primary being an
A and the secondary a M. The sky probably looks pretty wierd
and I wouldn\'t be surprised if Whangan chlorophyll was not green,
like orange, yellow or blue.

Not being an astronomer, where\'s the peak of Sol\'s light output 
in the visual range and where the same peak for an A star? Presumably
Whangan plants have their colour shifted similarly.

My experience at work shows that an increase in computers in no way allows
us to lay off experienced programmers, engineers, or even program managers.

We don\'t have anyone typing up dictation, and we could get rid of the mail
room easily enough though.

Steward is the only job I can think of that could be replaced by a computer.

I don\'t know how smart your computers are though...

Basically, if you wanted to have more cheap, tramp starships, what you\'d need to do is recognize that 100 dT is BIG, and that the electronics for starships are pretty outlandish as well.  An age of sail tramp steamer would probably be more like 10-20 dT, and pretty cheaply made as well.  It isn\'t surprising that these enormous, extremely capable ships (your average free trader is probably 30-40 meters long) are also expensive.

If you make a 100 T ship actually normally weigh in the 100T range (which means, depending on version, a 5-10x reduction in volume) it becomes a lot less unreasonable; drop the electronics correspondingly, and you start seeing prices which are only in the few millions; still expensive, but much more believable than the 20-40 million for a free trader.  Actually, a 5x reduction in volume makes things like staterooms come much closer to real-world sizes.

Well, (1) you apparently can jump to arbitrary locations, not just specific points, and (2) there is no possible unique continuous mapping from a sphere onto a plane (and in fact, more or less requires that occasionally J-1 is going thousands of parsecs), and (3) historical canon suggests that jumpspace and RW space are closely linked.

I imagined it like crumpling up a piece of paper into a ball.  The ball is
\'real space\' (3d) and the surface of the paper is \'jump space\' (2d).  The
problem is that somewhere in this scheme you end up with points close
together in real space but very far apart in jump space.  (You\'re right in
that this is exactly what wormholes might allow, but I don\'t see a nice 2d
map being the result.)

If you want to have this 2d jumpspace at the very least you have to drop the
pretence that directions \'coreward\' and \'spinward\' etc are valid in
jumpspace.  Where would you put a star on a traveller map that was \'up\' with
no coreward or spinward components?

Well, this is obviously correct, and I congratulate Comrade Hudson on his
insight!

How it happened is obviously the next question, and I suspect I have the
answer.

You see, most of the former Soviet Cosmodromes and stuff are in places like
Kazakhstan, where the local populations tend to be mostly Islamic, and
often speak Turkic type languages (as well as Russian, of course).  

At some point in the 21st Century, the "Russian" space program largely
becomes the "Central Asian" space program.  "Naturally enough", the Central
Asian states turn to their co-religionists in Turkey for assistance, which
has been vaguely industrialised by European capital.  

With the US being run by people like Jesse Ventura, Pat Buchanan, Donald
Trump and Ross Perot, the Turkish/Central Asian bloc becomes the vanguard
of humanity\'s expansion into space... :-)

Has anyone read any books by Ken Macleod?  He\'s a friend of Iain Banks who
writes this mutant-Marxist cyberpunk stuff.  It\'s a bit odd, and he insists
on making lots of obscure references, but he also has flashes of
brilliance.  His latest book is at least partly set in a micro-state built
around some of the former Soviet space facilities (and a bunch of concealed
nukes).  One of his earlier books has some _very_ scary stuff about
"post-humans", who I really don\'t like....

Zoroastrianism was the state religion of Persia, Rome\'s major "civilised"
rival.  A variant form, Mithraism, on the other hand, was one of the major
Roman cults.

Something similar happened after the Romans adopted Christianity in its
Catholic/Orthodox form (this is before the split between the two, of
course).  The Persians persecuted Orthodox/Catholic Christians, but
tolerated Nestorian heretics, who the Romans persecuted.

This is a possible interpretation of the effects of the Empress Wave on
Zhodani society.  Essentially, you have this powerful psionic message that
could be misinterpreted as a divine revelation, and the resulting cult
could well spread its incorrect ways of thinking through Zhodani society
faster than the Thought Police can stop it....

J1 (and J2 etc) drive should have in order to preserve the same
relationship between jump rating and number of possible destinations as
in canon.

First of all, I counted the number of possible destination hexes
(regardless of they contain a star or not) from one hex using different
jump ranges. For J1 to J6 drives, the number of destination hexes are 6,
18, 36, 60, 90, and 126. Thus, a J6 drive should be able to reach 21
(126/6) times as big a "destination volume" as a J1 drive, and so on.

Since a sphere with n times the volume of another sphere has a radius
that is [the cubic root of n] times that of the other sphere, it is
quite easy to figure out how big the jump ranges should be. I assume
that the range of a J1 drive is 1 parsec. If another basic range is
desired, just multiply all the ranges by the basic range (in parsecs).

In the table below, the symbol * means "cubic root of"

Jump rating   Jump range

    J1            1

I always thought Papillon would be a good setting for
a Traveller prison adventure.  

I mean, role-playing games are just the sort of places
to explore experiences that you might not want to have
in real life, like prison, horrible diseases,
abduction, serious physical trauma, having your mind
read, etc.  These experiences provide kind of a nice
contrast to getting rich quick and winning firefights,
which are also experiences that we don\'t usually have
in real life.

Of course nations _can_ contest the USA\'s power. But
no-one does, really.


In this vein, I know this might sound dodgy, but let\'s face it. Pax America
is a good thing (IMHO - phew!).

It has an active bill of rights. Sure this might (and has been) ignored in
playing the game of nations (eg during the cold war) but by and large its
still a pretty good thing. This in turn influences how it behaves to others
and it is more inclined to \'go into bat\' for the little people now, more
than ever with the demise of the cold war as they don\'t have to worry about
encroaching on Russia\'s sphere of influence.

It\'s a Democracy. Okay, so interest groups and the two party structure (like
most English speaking western countries) sometimes makes us think otherwise,
especially with two parties giving the impression of \'lesser of two evils\',
but both have to behave at least semi-honourably and with a genuine intent
to better their fellow man/woman/other ( and tobacco companies...)
 
And of course as the wealthiest nation of all, its bread and butter is
trade. It simply can\'t afford to be a bogey-man \'cause the good times will
surely end. Just look at the various short and nasty trade wars that erupt
between US & Japan or US and Europe, and they\'re over relatively minor
disagreements. 

Finally, it\'s not Pax Russia, China, or god forbid, France. In my book, a
good thing indeed.

As for a Pax Australia.

Not (necessarily) so.  Sol\'s peak output is in the green part of the
spectrum...the precise part that chlorophyl *reflects away* rather than
uses.  On Earth, it happened that the best sunlight-capturing chemical
evolution came up with had this disadvantage; it made up for the problem
by being more efficient at using the photons it did absorb, being
\'cheaper\' to synthesize, less prone to chemical attack, and so forth. 

An A star\'s peak output is in the blue-violet part of the spectrum, but
(like Sol\'s) it\'s a very broad peak.  It would appear "harsh blue-tinged
white" to the eye.  Note that brightly-colored stars are a rarity; normal
stars are simple black-body radiators with broad spectral peaks.  So an M
star isn\'t the glowering blood-red fireball we\'ve seen in too many
illustrations; instead, it\'s pretty much the same color as a 100
watt lightbulb running at about 50 watts of input power, a sort of
brownish-reddish-yellowish-white.

Dropping electronics is a question of what you think can be dispensed with
safely (or safely enough to satisfy potential passengers, freight agents,
starport authorities, and crewmembers).  Dropping volume, though, comes
straight off the bottom line; smaller ship equals smaller hold and
passenger quarters equals smaller revenue.  It does little good to reduce
ship payments by a factor of 10 if you also cut operating revenues by a
factor of 10.  In fact, it will hurt; certain fixed costs become more
relatively important when the volume is small.

To put it another way, one could express the business environment of a
ship in terms of its fixed expenses (e.g., crew salaries) and an
expected net revenue per dton of hold and passenger quarters.  The latter
is what you get when you subtract the revenue you expect to obtain by
using that dton for commerce, minus the costs of operating that dton
during the period (life support, etc.)  Note also that the size of the
debt payment will scale with the size of the hold/quarters; for
simplicity, let\'s call it linear.  So we derive

  P = V * H - V * D - F

where P is net profit, V is the ships\'s volume available for commerce on
some arbitrary scale, H is the expected net revenue per dton of commerce
volume, D is the debt payment per dton, and F is the ship\'s fixed
expenses.  Simplifying gives us:

  P = V * (H - D) - F

That H - D term simply tells us that if each dton can\'t earn enough
revenue to pay for itself, we\'re hosed from the start.  Note, however,
that in the limit of zero volume, the ship loses F credits per period.  As
V increases, we hit some breakeven point, and as V increases further, the
ship becomes profitable.

Which just reiterates what we all know already:  Economies of scale exist.
Large ships are more profitable per dton than small ones.  Small tramp
merchants are screwed if they try to compete with the big guys.  And
Anthony\'s super-small tramps will have to find even more specialized
niches where not even \'normal\'-sized tramps can operate.

To put it yet another way:  Nobody ever gets rich doing standard book-3
trading in a Type S, and you don\'t even need to make payments on those. :)

Just wanted to publicly say "thank you" to Scott Spieker, who recently ran a
Trav auction of his material.

I bought "Signal GK" from him a few weeks ago. He emailed me last Thursday (18
Nov), saying he posted it and it should arrive within a week. Well, I\'m happy to
say that I picked it up from my PO Box yesterday evening (Wed 24 Nov)!

It was sandwiched between two nice thick cardboard sheets and therefore received
no damage while en-route. The book looks near-new to me (no I *don\'t* know the
official quality codes ;-) which is excellent for something that is 15 years
old.

Thanks again, Scott!

On of the best deals I heard about was that of my sister in-law and her
husband.  If either of them were put in a situation where either of them
could no longer work, the loan was automatically paid off by some kind of
insurance that was part of the finance deal!  I might add, that this was
some 20-odd years ago and the deal is no longer available from what I have
heard, but it paid off just recently with both of them being put in just
that situation... and the house only having a few grand left after this
time... but still, better than nothing.

IMTU, it\'s fairly simple: Banks won\'t finance J5 or J6 ships. Period. J4\'s
will only be financed when there is a viable collateral OTHER THAN THE SHIP.
J3 ships require a good buisiness plan, and while anything put in can be
removed or replaced, if you can\'t outrun the news, you\'d better keep the
payments in line. Most of the "Pirates" (by cgen career) are actually skip
tracers most of the time, starmercs when needed, and privateers when
available. The banks tend to send J-4 messages when a ship makes it\'s
payments, to all payment acceptance stations within 2 months hard travel
from point of payment. Most worlds maintain lists of ships in the area; if a
ship is more than two months out by local computations, they prepare a skip
alert... Not that they announce the ship has skipped, but that customs needs
to check for papers (if the law level allows) or the bank hires a skip
tracer to "take a look"; most (almost all) ship financing allows the banks\'
local agent to inspect or authorize inspection by their deputy as "part
owner". If the agent finds proof of payment, fine, he\'s got to leave.
Otherwise, including if the crew refuses access to the papers and/or ship
after seeing appropriate credentials, the agent may reposess the ship "On
suspicion". I only did this to a PC group once... it ended the campaign
(They wound up confined to an imperial prison world, since the note holder
was the Imperial Government, and the "Tracer" was an IMOJ field agent...
whom they shot.)
Since I use the "pirates" as skip tracers, it gives reason for banks to
subsidize or even finance pirate vessels... field authorizations! And a
letter or Marque and Reprisal, with clauses allowing inspection of records
of vessels financed by a given bank, or government, and siezure if not able
to prove current payments. That, and the pirates keeping tabs on skip
reports.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 


IMTU I handle payments thusly;

If a vessel has payments remaining, the vessel has to go to a Bank branch
every payment date to get the running codes for the ship (codes for the next
two years are X-boated to branches once the papers are signed). If this date
is missed by more than two weeks (and vessel is not in Jump, has not
suffered a malfunction preventing one or is not empty of enough fuel for a
jump), then jump drive will be disabled and \'registered\' weapons be not able
to fire. This is designed to prevent the vessel from skipping. 

However, banks do give permission for those with payment\'s owning, to
receive codes in advance, if they are going to be outside the interstellar
state where the bank is located (such as the \'outback\', for a Sylean M0 or
over the frontier for a M1120 Imperial ship). Obviously there has to be a
good reason and the vessel\'s owner\'s have to give a proposal (many
\'regional\' bank officers ask for a 5-7% commission on any profits made on an
\'outside\' trip . Some even might send a clerk to keep an eye on things). 

There are some rogue independent worlds (such as Class A or B star ports
with low pop and govt. but high tech far from interstellar states) that
offer \'code\' cracking or re-configure services, but these are likely to be
very expensive and are highly illegal (look, an adventure!) 

Re-payments are made every month. The cost is 1/240 of the cash price (new)
for the ship. If extra payments are made, then the monthly payment is
reduced concurrently (work it out on a spreadsheet or something). Banks
require proof of ability to finance re-payments, so this might make non
merchant vessels a tad tricky to fund ("So you want to buy a patrol cruiser.
How will you be funding the payments?" . . . "I\'m going to . . . er . . .
become a pira . . I mean an escort, yeah, an escort . . . matey!")

The Mauri are comparitively recent.


Your best example is the Papacy, which has lasted about a millenium as a
government. We\'ve had groups lasting loinger that eventually fell, so I
still predict that they will fall too. But there\'s no way to prove this
until it happens.

(Note: I\'m discussing governments in power, not organizations.)

Don\'t forget Palestine was a mess of fundamentalist nutters at the time,
doing all sorts of strange things. Think of the Brits in Northern Ireland:
no matter what you do, someone will complain (even going away will cause
complaints). No way to win that one.

(FWIW, I\'m a Christian, and yet I think there\'s a chance that the
historical Jesus may well have been a bandit/freedom fighter. No way to
prove it, barring some old records coming to light -- and if they did
there\'s a fair chance that they would be attacked pretty quickly, so even
that wouldn\'t settle things.)

Hmm. Years ago I got permission from the president of DGP to xerox
out-of-print work for friends, provided I did so at cost. Roger <spit>
Sanger hasn\'t revoked that permission, so I would assume it\'s still valid.

The question remains, though, if SOM is actually DGP\'s.  I know that it was
the only DGP writing that I got paid for, so everything else of mine that
they published is actually under _my_ copyright, not DGP\'s (because they
didn\'t fullfil their half of the contract - paying me - I don\'t have to
fullfil my half - transferring my copyright to them).

David Pulver (the designer of the GT starship design system) says that in
GT the USL hull is equivalent to a MegaTraveller Partly Streamlined hull.
In essence, it is not streamlined, but you can still travel at a reasonable
speed if you have contragrav. You have all the aerodynamic lift of a brick,
of course.

Here are the conversions:

GT	MT
SL	streamlined
USL	partly streamlined
PL*	unstreamlined
DS*	unstreamlined

* Planetoid and dispersed-structure: coming in future GT books.

GT: Starships will include a better explanation of this, as well as more
details on things like fuel scoops, jump grids, and the like. Chris Thrash
is writing it, and the draft is quite nice. Buy a Pyramid subscription to
be on the playtest team (when it hits playtest, which should be pretty
soon).

I should be able to answer you this weekend. These, along with about 50% of

this thread has sparked the desire to re-read them!

<* chuckle *>.  You have just reproduced a table which almost ended up 
in _First In_.  I think we decided to drop the idea because it affected the
Traveller flavor too much -- for one thing, it played hob with the economic
models in _Far Trader_.  But this notion might be worth exploring in
a home-grown Traveller game.

This is probably not what your thinking of, but I\'m interested in
knowing the star systems which are at the furtherest boundries
of the 3I. From the stuff I have avail. to me, 3I\'s farthest
Spinward systems are either Emape or Raweh in the 5 sisters
subsector of the Spinward Marches (IMTU its Raweh, since
its farther from the core. This assuming that both systems are
moving in the same direction. One could argue Emape is the
farthest out, but that would take *way* to much gearheading
for me to worry about). Rimward we have Remulak and
Sarpedon in the Solomani Rim (again IMTU I give it to
Remulak). Of course, if the 3I still intends on reclaiming the
Solomani Sphere, then the systems would be *alot* more
Rimward. I don\'t have that much to go on for a farthest
3I galactic coreward or trailing system. Anyone with a
Atlas of the Imperium?

Not if it\'s *bigger* than a starship. Consider that shells which will

Also, *shattering* a rock in the "city killer" and up range can

Not quite. There was an author given permission by Doc Smith shortly
before Doc died. His name was Ellern. The first story was "Moon
Prospector" and was not only published in Analog, but was the cover
story that month.  Ellern later wrote two more stories, one of which
was serialized in the back of the Ace Perry Rhodan books. And his
stufff was pretty good, it just hit the market at a bad time.

*Much* later, Smith\'s *heirs* authorized those dreadful books you
mention above ("The Dragon Lensman", etc). Those were an unmitigated
disaster, because the writer didn\'t *have* a style, and didn\'t
understand basic premises of Doc\'s universe.

It also depends what you call a "government," that is,
what sort of events would make it no longer the same
government? I\'m thinking particularly of the Roman
Empire, which began around 750 BCE, rose to its first
height of power by 280 BCE, had a second expansion
around 50 BCE - and then went from republic to
dictatorship (Julius Caesar). Was it the "same
government" after that? And from there it expanded and
contracted for a bit, took on Christianity... does
that officially make it a "different government"? A
hundred years after that, it was split into east
(Byzantium) and west. Does that count as a government
change? And then of course the west fell to barbarian
invasions, the east remaining, and shrinking, until
1453 when it fell to moslems... which is undoubtedly a
"change of government"... of course there were many
other steps along the way, but I\'m just pointing out
the most obvious and well-known ones.

Certainly I can imagine similar things happening in
the Imperium (forgive my ignorance of canon if they
actually have, or if I\'m speaking blasphemy!) that is,
the empire becomes too large to govern, is split in
two or more pieces, one side falls to barbarians
(Vargr? Aslan? K\'kree? some wild mixture of races?),
the other remains, culturally rich but militarily
(relatively) weak...

Actually the T4 history I\'ve seen seems to parallel a
later period: the collapse of the western Roman empire
(first imperium), the brief rise of Charlmagne, or
Theodoric (Rule of Man), then the Dark Ages (Long
Night), and finally the Renaissance (Third Imperium).
However religion has been removed....

Not sure exactly what question I\'m asking, but I\'m
sure what I\'ve said will spark some comments:)

I always assumed the streamlining was, well, wings and
stuff. 20% of your volume is lost because 20% of your
weight is now wings and so on. When I see technical
data for a jet, they may give its weight as 25,000
lbs, but that\'s 25,000 lbs *including* the wings,
aeroliens (sp?) and such. It\'s assumed you\'re not
intersted in its wingless weight, since all that
weight, whatever it is, will be, um, "dead" weight."

I recall a time in the late 70s or eaerly 80s when a car dealership
vacated their building downtown. For a long time they couldn\'t find
anybody to rent it, and we joked about getting a bunch of gamers
together and renting it. 

You see, the first floor was almost entirely open, and tiled with 1"
white ceramic *hex* tiles. Yeah, a hex map about 200 feet square. 

Let\'s see. If I haven\'t dropped a decimal, that\'s 2400 hexes across. 

I can see it now, dozens of different games set up with the "maps"
roped off when not in use...

Nope. Skylark of Valeron. We know for a fact it was built around a
"projector" with *thousand* km diameter "setting circles". And that
attacks that blast holes miles deep into it didn\'t affect the
projector. 

So in essence, it\'s a size "S" planet! Maybe a size 1. Tuf\'s Ark is a
*lot* smaller.

There are even bigger ships. Check out Fritz Lieber\'s "the Wanderer".
It has *ships* the size of *Earth* battling it out entirelt too close
to Earth.

And they were using PAWs scaled to fit!

Hey!  I\'ve got that magazine...mid-60\'s, I think.  I could dig it

Kyle replies:
Sounds all rather well-organised. I just can\'t imagine
it working that efficiently. To me, it seems rather
like a 15th century Florentine bank lending money for
a ship to do speculative trading in the East Indies...
"I\'ll be back, really I will!" Hmmm....

Again, I don\'t quite buy it. Codes are crackable. If
your PCs have among them an engineer, it\'s going to be
his first priority, I\'d imagine. This is particularly
so if the ship is worth millions. Most crime is either
really petty (VCRs, TVs, marijuana), or really big
(insider trading). The PCs will want to skip payments,
temporarily or permanently, if it\'s a matter of a
thousand creds or less ("who cares about that
little?"), or a million creds or more ("think of what
else we could do with that money..."). 

I\'m thinking here of the Cash Value to Hassle Ratio.
When this is high, the likelihood of crime is also.

Again, what NPCs can do, PCs can do... though it may
take longer and be more expensive in buying computers,
etc...

****Re: Solutions to dilemna****
IMTU, ships are heaps cheaper... but then, I was using
the TU before G:T came out, using GURPS rules, the old
GURPS: Space... with the spaceship construction rules
there. _Much_ cheaper than CT et al...

I make available "engineer\'s dreams" (like the
"renovator\'s dream" in real estate) with the
occaisional unpleasant surprise.

Further along this road, there may be those among you
who know of this beach in India, I forget its name,
where old unseaworthy ships get run aground. A whole
city has grown up around the scrap industry there. I
figure the same will happen in the future. Some ships
get dumped in space or suns, but some get landed on
this planet... A small desert world, almost mined out,
only a few desperados live there... and old ships get
dumped in a 100x100 km area... the local government
charges mainly by the ton.

It\'s an adventure for the PCs, scrounging around. It\'s
great for starting groups, I tell them what\'s
available, and they tack together a spaceship out of
it all... not high-tech stuff, but the host planet
charges very little for it. In traditional GURPS rules
it was relatively easy, with advantages, for a party
to scrape up half a million or so, and they were able
to get a mediocre free trader out of this. A
"character ship" for them... starting off with no
staterooms, just blankets on the floor... Maybe
someone had a Contact or Ally in the local Imperial
Shipyards, so they were able to get a decent computer
(or they could stick with their TL6/7, two dozen
parallel-wired 286 type machines)... and so... thus,
ship construction becomes an adventure in itself, and
they get to learn about the ship construction system,
get explanations of what a meson gun is, and so on...

How much of the 3I (and surrounding polities) would fit on a map that
size?

"Stomping the Sword Worlds" would take on a whole new meaning.... ;-)

Alternately, you could do World War II (using the _whole_ world!) at
battalion/regiment/brigade level (each hex would be about 10 miles
across at the equator).

Naval actions could be fought at the destroyer-escort-and-up level....

Oh really? And IYTU, is Remulak the home of the Coneheads and do you

Yes, and it\'d take longer than the real WWII to game
out! I\'m not kidding! I saw in Sydney a game of World
in Flames (WWII, for you non-wargamers), with _all_
the optional rules, six players, it took them six
months of weekly games... granted, these were not the
most decisive and rapid acting bunch of players I\'ve
ever seen, and there was much consulting of rulebooks
and, um, "discussion" of the rules, but still...

The problem is that the Bill of Rights, as well as labor and environmental
laws only apply within its borders.  In the 3rd world Pax Americana mostly
seems to mean freedom for US corporations to screw the locals, with
practices ranging from killing labor organizers (as has happened in
several African nations) to actual use of slave labor, or work agreements
with nations who use slave labor (for example the PRC). 

It\'s great for US consumers, but w/o effective resistance the US is free
to suck the 3rd world dry.  It actually looks a lot like the earliest
parts of the 3rd Imperium. 

While a US-run world government might end up somewhat more free on average
(though I\'m fairly sure negative economies of scale would make the effort
a disaster) the Pax American is in part merely a grand neocolonial
moneymaking endeavor. 

Note that Saddam Hussein remains in power despite the atrocities he\'s
inflicted on his own people and others. However, the US made sure to keep
cheap oil coming out of Kuwait and Saudi.  It looks like the motives 
involved have much more to do with money than with anything else.

In my line of work, automation HAS reduced the number of people required to
do the job. I just finished laying out a book, in page maker. The actual
layout took a mere 100 work hours (counting re-layouts due to editing
changes). If it had to be done by manually laying out type for the final
and proof, and retyping the pages for the various (20) drafts.

>
>Steward is the only job I can think of that could be replaced by a computer.

Steward is the only one I can think of that CAN\'T be replaced by
automation. Since stewards have to handle customers, handle paperwork,
load/unload/ballance cargo, and provide for the cooking and cleaning
services... Yes, automation might reduce the efforts in paperwork,
loading/unloading/ballancing cargo. But not in direct customer service
areas.

Navigators could be replaced by extensive automation, provided there are no
legal impediments.

Engineers, under normal conditions, could be automated out of the loop,
again subject to legal requirements; damage repairs are NOT "Normal
operations", but routine maintenance could be automated to a large extent,
especially if one installs robotic manipulators that are close enough to
work on each other, too.

Pilots can be automated, too. Most piloting tasks would logically be little
more than triggering the autopilot and setting the correct waypoints; with
GPS good to 2m (There was a shot of some military engineers useing a GPS
reciever to set a survey marker, and it was on broadcast TV! Those are
supposed to be field set to within 10cm... draw your own conclusions), you
should be able to fly a ship that\'s 15m + in length on a landing pad fairly
accurately by using 2 or 3 GPS\'s. In theory, the GPS system should be
accurate to 5cm... once outside orbit, there really isn\'t much in the way
of piloting that couldn\'t be done on an apple IIe, with the correct
parameters and software. Even Jump Piloting can be automated, see also Jump
Tapes for proof in canon: Jump Tapes require no Pilot/Nav roll, just the
engineering rolls. In fact, I\'m aware that in the simulators, they\'ve been
able to plot autopilot courses for P-3\'s that simply reuire the pilot to
take over to do the flare and lower the gear.

Gunners: Gunners can easily be automated; in any real space combats either
ranges will be far enough that you\'re shooting on Probability of Contact
volley solutions, or close enough that the relative speeds will probably
make humans useless. Exceptions for orbital ranges. You need someone to
tell the auto-gunner whom to shoot, and whom not to. And in most cases, if
a gunner can line it up, a computer can line it up faster. Based upon the
few canopn descriptions, gunners don\'t actually fire the weapons anyway,
but rather select the target, and disengage the safety so the computer can
fire at the right point. Why have gunners? So you have someone to lay
liability on, and to perform maintenance on the gun. Maintenance can be
done by robots, or robitic parts linked into the computers.

Medical: Medicine really has expanded due to automation... but medicine as
a technology-intensive field is still not bloosoming in the same way office
work has. Computing power allows better manipulation of medical imaging
systems. It allows better (and automated) decision tree systems which
provide the most likely problems. Computer alone, however, are not MUCH of
an aid to medicine; but more an adjunct to timely decision making and to
the sensors.

Sensor Operations and Communications Operators: Look at what SETI is doing
with automation. Yeah, you still need to have someone look at what gets
through the hasing algorythm, but as the algorythm gets better, that makes
it much easier to check what is important. In theory, you should have the
sensors and commo monitored 24/7 when underway... that means you need at
least three people for reasonable safety, two if you are willing to cut
corners; on smaller ships, it is a safe assumption the pilot and navigator
alternate this duty with any dedicated electronics operators.

Loaders & Deck Apes: With TL 13+ Robots available, and the prices at which
a TL13 cleaning robot can be built, there\'s no reason not to replace
swabbies with bots. Likewise, loading is not an intellectual activity,
provided the steward has the loading plot ready. With containerized cargo,
there is no reason not to automate the process, as bot\'s WILL BE more
accurate than persons.

So, in almost all areas, the reduction really isn\'t from computers, but
from the roboticization of the workspaces, and adding the software for the
required skills. Not a big problem. Expensive. In the long run, probably
even cheaper than paying crewmembers. But, in the overall economic picture,
not a good idea. First, you want people to be liable... so if something
goes wrong, you need a user to have user error. Secondly, if you automate
the craft too much, it becomes far too easy to take over if you can gain
computer access... send a well charged up cymbeline chip on a mission....
Third, People need jobs. Capitalism is based upon payment for labor. That
requires labor as an input value. Lacking this, see vinge.

I definitely don\'t buy vinge\'s whole bit,  but I do know that moder
economics require a working public.

Escape? They\'d described to me how to set it up. Since all sentences were
LIFE sentences (not natural life, but you are there until you die there,
unless the emperor takes pity on you), on a world with no surface
accessable metal deposits that are workable. The atmosphere is breathable,
the plants are all edible, and the temperature is generally tropical in the
middle lattitudes. The "jailors" set up a blockade. They NEVER land. Not
even to drop prisoners; a prisoner arrives via paradrop; in their kit a
prioner has a bowl, a spoon, and a pocketknife, all of SD, plus the
jumpsuit, the parachute, and the rigging thereof. When I sprung this on
them, they decided that they didn\'t want a "survive the jungle and the
previous prisoners". They\'d all read the Sten Series, and knew what you can
do as a prisoner... and the bit about the penal colony had them fearing
thbe already established hierarchy.

Besides, I didn\'t have Adv. 8; I only acquired that last year.

Well I make that 60 *sectors*.  (2400/40).

I think we can safely say you could fit all of known space on the floor and
a fair chunk of the Zhodani core expeditions.

\'Course you might want to have a \'walkway\' round a sector for access

That must be somewhere out west, say Acton way.  Drat!  Now I\'m going to
have go and find the article.


There\'s also the minor curiosity that you can go northbound on one line
from station A to station B and then northbound on another line from B and
wind up back at A.  I\'ll leave it as an exercise for the reader to work out
where this us unless you want to know in offlist email!

After two years of using the underground I started cycling round London
(good for the adrenalin rush) and was surprised by how \'inaccurate\' my
geography was!


I wonder if in some future 6th Imperium when they work out how to travel
instantly (or very very fast) in normal space, travellers are suddenly
puzzled that actually Efate is quite near Capital and none of the familiar
astrography \'works\' any more?

The GURPS space book has it at 600 parsecs (1956 ly) thick in the 
spiral arms and 1800 parsecs (5868 ly) thick at the core.

Sounds like what I\'ll set up if I ever run a game again.

Yards *full* of old ships will exist, especially in airless worlds, or
in *distant* (for stability) parking orbits around mainworlds. This is
where ships go when they aren\'t worth fixing, or when the crew just
gives up (or dies). Ships that nobody is real interested in "as is" but
are felt to maybe be worth more (eventually) than their value as scrap
metal.

It\'s not like it *costs* anything to let them sit on an isolated corner
of an airless mainworld, or in that parking orbit. The only costs are a
nav beacon and a security guard (for the stuff in orbit, he just
watches a sensor display back at the highport, it\'s not as if you could
sneak up on them...

You may be able to find almost anything there. But the more specific
the item, the less likely. And many (most) easily strippable parts for
*common* ships will have already been removed.

So, for example, if you want replacement filters for your XGZ Mark 4
trader, they probably won\'t have them. But don\'t give up yet, says the
proprietor, I think we\'ve got an old Vargr ship that has filters you
could use if you build an adapter in your ship\'s machine shop...

And if all you care about is "we need life support parts, and we\'ll
*make* them fit if we have to" then you\'ve come to the right place. 

You may even find functional but ancient ships. Like this old TL-9
trader. Uses a fission reactor for power and for the reaction drive.
She\'s old and worn, but still sound. It\'s just that the last owner died
and the heirs didn\'t want it. So it\'s been sitting here for a couple of
centuries. Yes, it does take a bit of hunting to find yards that\'ll
overhaul the ship. On the other hand, you only need to refuel the
reactor every 5-10 years. You still need LH2 for the Jump drive and for
the manuever drive, but that\'s available everywhere. It\'s a tradeoff.
And you spend a lot more time coasting to and from the 100 diameter
limit. But if you are willing to take the extra time, it\'s cheaper to
operate than a modern ship. 

And thus your players wind up as the proud owners of a true "antique"
of a ship. A real Classic. And a definite "fixer upper". :-)

You are confusing "streamlining" and "airframe". Most *cars* are
streamlined. This means that air folows over them smoothly, and in a
manner calculated to not destabilize the vehicle (ie the car doesn\'t
have a stron tendency to turn into the wind, but a strong gust will
still push it sideways). 

Airframe is where you start worrying about stuff like generating lift
and major aerodynamic control surfaces.

Keep your eyes open. This was a *common* flooring for some years, and a
lot of ground floor "showrooms" used it. 

If I ever get a house of my own, I may buy a bunch of those tiles and
use them to cover a *big* gaming table. Nice glazed ceramic finish, so
you can use grease pencils and felt markers and still clean it easily.
I expect I can find a good, non-porous *black* grout to mount them in. 

Who cares if you spill drinks on the map? As long as you didn\'t use
water soluble markers...

This looks like a *bad* case of "diminishing returns". 

Let\'s look at this a bit differently. In *real* 2-d space, you don\'t
have fixed hexes. The *area* accessible to you goes up with the square
of the jump. J1 = 1X, J2 = 4X, J3 = 9X, etc. In 3d space it goes up as
the cune. So without doing the calculations, I think you want the range
to increase as the 2/3rd power of the jump number:

J1	  1
J2	 *4 (1.58)
J3	 *9 (2.08)
J4	*16 (2.52)
J5	*25 (2.92)
J6	*36 (3.30)

This looks a bit better than your figures, and I\'m pretty sure it has
the area/volume relationship right.

If all else fails there\'s that stuff they use for expansion joints 
between concrete slabs. It\'s black, it\'s easy to apply (it must be - a 
guy I used to flat with put the stuff in for a living, and he\'s nearly 
moron material), and it won\'t wear out and practically nothing

        Hi, Leonard!

        Is that before or after they put nuclear explosives in them?  A 15"
sapper with a 100kton charge for the payload will screw up a significant
amount of a mountain side....

        Imagine being able to deliver several dozen minutes of sustain
kton-range explosions into that mountain...  that\'s USP T meson fire...  you
can kill a mountain or a mountain-sized rock in short order with the weapon
yeilds that Traveller gets into....

        Unless you can blow the pieces to sub-re-entry sized pieces.  Which
a sufficient number of surface-set missile and meson batteries can do.
        Better yet...  spend some time with a calculator and figure out
which point on the surface of the roid to keep soaking the meson and missle
fire into to change its course so it "skips" off the outter surface of the
atmosphere.  As I understand it, the angle required for a sucessful, "will
touch the ground" reentry is vanishingly small....

<slapping forehead>  Of course!  The Stranded Vilani Travellers who
eventually wound up in southern Mesopotamia originally landed their
starship in Anatolia, not (as I\'d previously been thinking) the Caucasus!
In fact, Kemal Ataturk is one of \'em, revived from low berth according to
the Unspeakable Schedule... it\'s all much clearer now.

	Just don\'t do too good a job, depending on your players.
	I ran an Aftermath! campaign a while ago, and I wanted to
	impress on the players the hopelessness that most of the
	survivors of the apocalypse felt.  It was never clear to
	me that I might be doing a good job of this until the
	players asked for a change of game, they found this one
	too depressing!  I was both disapointed (a fair bit of
	work had gone into the ruins of Montreal) and elated (wow,
	I guess it worked).  Happily, we turned back to Traveller,
	which had been dormant for a while.

Oh, yes, you can get insurance like that now. In fact, my mortgage company
has one on us, so If we are dead or otherwise physically unable to pay,
the bank get\'s their money, and the insurance co. gets the house.

Now I can go out and buy supplemental insurance so I get to keep the
house, but it comes out of my pocket...still a good idea, though.

ObTrav (and ObAkus, Eris!) Starships, of course, like cars, automobiles,
and Martha Stewart can be insured against loss, damage, or lapsing into
poor taste (just kidding, but the board of directors for Martha Stewart
Inc, have taken out a rather large incurance policy on her)

How much do you charge and does it work IYTU? Adding, of course and
entirely new layer of bureaucrats snooping around the PC\'s lives and
misdeeds: the insurance investigator.

Actually, you can color grout just about any color you want; I know I saw
a lot of different colors at a tile store I was in recently. (including
black)

Also, there are smaller hexagonal tiles (they come on the mesh backing and
are laid in 1\' x 1\' squares.) That makes a much more manageable gaming
table, and is just about perfect for most minis.

Damn good idea Leonard!

Still, that system could be adapted to Traveller pretty easily.

Duran Duran. Of course I\'m cheating, having just watched it. Again. Jane is
such a babe. And surrounded by all the inept set design, writing, etc. she
actually seems to be acting. I read in a recent article someone is thinking
of redoing the movie, with Drew Berrymore as the lead. Wrong choice IMHO,
but I\'d still go see it.

As far as "stats", here are some thoughts:

Large Wardrobe
Clumsy (She falls alot)
Naive
Extreme pulchritude (IMHO)

I don\'t know - IMTU and in the suggestions for T4.1, steward skill 
was going to be more like that held by Andre Notron\'s Cargo Masters. 
IE they manage everything to do with cargo and passengers, 
effectively the ships\' business manager.

As to shedding engineers - my company still invests similar levels of 
capital but has cut engineering numbers by 2/3 and shifted the areas 
of responsibility. YMMV

Hmm. So we have:

The Great Old One Eris the Heretic.
The Great Old One Templar Inquisitor Doug the Penguin Guy.

All conspiring against the stars being wrong and sleeping L\'roy will

ObAkus, Wolfgang met with the insurance agent yesterday.  It\'s not
*my* fault he didn\'t bring his Captain or partners up to speed, and
no I\'m not going to tell you what he found out. <g>

ObTrav, and ship insurance.  What you pay is going to depend on
several factors, the value of the ship (or ship systems) insured,
how and where the ship is used, the deductible and/or co-payments
required, and the frequency of payment.  

This is going to be coming up in my game RSN, and here\'s my thinking
on it. I\'d appreciate comments.


To insure a ship against loss or damage up to 90% of apprised value.
    3% of apprised value per year, payable in advance
   +1% to cover the remaining 10%
   -1% if the ship stays on especially safe routes
   +2% if the ship works outside "safe zones"
   -1% if the ship receives regular and necessary maintenance, as
       defined by the insurer, and proof of same is submitted to the
       insurer

   Insurance does not cover maintenance, upgrades, or repairs
   required from normal use.

   Insurance covers only damage incurred from causes listed in the
   contract at time of issuance.

   And, of course, the GM may modify payments, terms and conditions
   as needed based on the requirements of the campaign.
   
So, to cover the exploratory trader /Mae Lee/, valued at 10.8
million cr, to 100%, given that she receives regular maintenance,
will cost you 540,000 cr each year.  If you drop the coverage to 90%
and fly only the insurer\'s designated "safe routes", the fee drops
to 108,000 cr.

Gads, yet another set of boxes to dig in! I love this list!

Now that you mention them Leonard, I do remember those stories! However I
think your right Ellern was given permission by \'Doc\' himself. Both Goldin
and David Kyle were given permission by the estate (i.e. heirs) of \'Doc\'.

Hummm, according to my desk top reference William Ellernwrote "Moon
Prospector" for Analog in the April 1966 issue, "New Lwnaman" was serialized
in Perry Rodan # 61-75 January-June 1975 and in London: Futura, 1976 (by the
way if anyone in Brittan can locate this in a used book/magazine store we
can negotiate!), finally "Tripalanetary Agent" was serialized in PErry
Rhodan #100-105, August-October 1976.

Oh, and even though I own all of them I agree, the Kyle books were terrible!
I injoyed Goldin\'s books as pulp in their own right, at least he tried to
capture the essence of pulp fiction.

Loenard,

We used to use a table like this (6x10 ft.) however we didn\'t grout the
tiles in. We built a frame around them to hold them in place. The reason was
that we had several colors of tile, therefore we could pop the tile out and
replace them
to depict walls, rivers etc. We also mounted minis to individual tiles with
glue. During the game, when a figure would move we\'d pull a tlie from the
new location, place the figure there and "backfill" with the pulled tile. It
nmade for some neat complex maps. A couple of small suction cups glued to
the ends of sticks worked for pulling the flat tiles.

Same here.  In my Akus Moby game, in order to be a ship flagged out
of the Mark system, get insured, get loans, etc, the PC\'s are just
about to start "sitting" for certifications and licenses which will
"prove" their qualifications for their shipboard jobs.  <g> This is
what I\'m requiring for Steward/Pursers.

Assistant Steward/Purser requires a...

  Steward\'s License
     Certified Medical Technician
        First Aid-1
        Med Tech Electronics-1
        Diagnosis-1 
     Tests covering:
        Lifesupport Ops-1
        Ship Administration (Admin-1)
        Passenger Services Regs (Steward-1)
     300 mark registration fee

  Chief Steward/Purser
     Steward\'s License
       (As above)
     CargoMaster\'s Certificate
        Tests covering:
           Cargo Loading & Freight Handling  (Cargohandling-1)
           Hazmat Handling (Hazmat-1)
     Commercial Law & Regulations  (Law-1)
     Advanced Ship Administration (Admin-2)
     Advanced Passenger Services (Steward-2)
     600 mark registration fee

This is for the License, but to be successful, the Steward is going
to have to add several business, interpersonal, and security skills:
Broker, Trader, Market Knowledge, Streetwise, Liaison, Fast Talk,
Diplomacy, Security, Gun Cbt, Boarding Tactics, and so on.

BTW, in every version of Traveller I think it would be a good idea
to list the "requirements" for the jobs that PC\'s normally do.
Things like, 

"If you\'re going to be considered a for the Pilot position you need
these skills at minimum...and having....would be nice."

"To get hired as an Engineer you should have these skills..., and
these aren\'t required,...,but having them would increase your
value."

Etc

	Given that the Mae Lee would have monthly payments of

Of course, in this case, the Mae Lee doesn\'t have a monthly payment at all 
<g> At least not unless or until we have to take out a loan to cover the 
repairs we need to do to her.

Sounds rather like "Escape Orbit"(?) by James White. At least I think
that\'s the title.

Except that there they did "land" or at least come to a low enough
"hover" to kick prisoners and their kit off the end of the boarding
ramp. 

Also, rather than find a world with no usable metal deposits, they just
did sensor sweeps and any time they found a concentration of metal
above a certain size, they\'d drop an ortillery round on it. 

I think there were regular drops of vitamin mineral supplements, and
minimal medical supplies, too. For all the goos a plastic crate and a
parachute did the prisoners as "raw materials".

They managed to escape. And no, I don\'t remember how.

Also, check out Jack Vance\'s "the Blue World" for an example of how to
produce metals on a planet with no workable deposits. The basic idea is
that given a strong heat source, and carbon to act as a reducing agent,
things like *blood* can be a metal source. Many plants and animals
selectively concentrate various metals.

The problem there is actually multiple, interlocking problems. First,
the Arabs are understandably reluctant to set the precedent of allowing
outsider removal of a (theoretically) Arab, Moslem leader.

Second, it\'s not politically feasible for us to just take over. Which
leads to the third problem. If we eliminate Saddam, who replaces him?
There\'s *no* credible opposition faction left. He saw to that via
extermination. So we\'d get either someone who is much the same, or we\'d
get a weak leader. And if we got a weak leader, Iran would invade (and
*win*) in a heartbeat. 

We don\'t need an Iranian controlled Iraq!

Especially when you consider that these tiles are intended for high
dirt, heavy traffic areas. The main places I\'ve seen them are showroom
floors (where the have to deal with cars, including possible oil leaks)
and in old public bathrooms. 

Heck, if all else fails, tile the rec room floor with them. Have lots
of *big* throw pillows for the players to sit on while working around
the map. 

If you get really ambitious, find a way to get some tiles custom glazed
(or reglazed) with stars and names on them. A permanent map. :-)

Also, credit/mortage companies get bought out, merge, etc. And when the
contract changes hands, some aspects of the terms can also. For
example, the credit insurance I had on a card I no longer have changed
from "lose your job, payments are made until you get work" to exclude
being *fired*. You had to be laid off, or the company you worked for
had to go under. 

It\'s details like this that could turn around and bite the players when
they find that their insurance terms aren\'t quite what they thought
they were.

No, burning up on re-entry is one of the ways the cloud of chunks from
a *big* rock can screw the planet up *worse* than just letting it hit
in one piece. 

Instead of <way too many> joules concentrated at a single point and
punch through the crust and wasting energy trying to move rock, you get
<still too many> joules spread over much of a hemisphere, cooking
everything, or at least igniting everything flammable.

It\'s the difference between a cannonball and canister shot. Same mass
of projectile, but far more damage of the *desired* type from the
smaller pieces.

Only for spacecraft. At shallow angles (very shallow) they\'ll skip. A
bigger object *won\'t*, because it has far more mass behind each unit of
surface area (the square/cube law strikes again). 

At steeper angles spacraft burn up or hit the grouind too hard for the
crew to survive. Again, a bigger object won\'t burn up, and you *want*
it to hit the ground hard.

I had a player comment a few weeks ago that they were going to make
"plenty of money" trading.  I don\'t think he counted on *all* the
expenses that "plenty of money" was going to have to cover.  They
are going to have to take out a hefty loan, or NPC partners, just to
get the ship off the ground.  Either way, there will be strings
attached. <g>

That\'s a good question.  One can fairly argue that China had the same
government from the time Qin consolidated power in the central part of
the region about 450 BCE (I think I have the date close to correct)
until 1949.  While dynasties holding the throne changed at various
times, the central functions of government -- bureaucracy, education,
military, religious rites -- continued more or less normally.  Even the
Mongols simply became Chinese emperors after a generation.  

One can even argue that the communists, too, just became Chinese
emperors, but I don\'t want to get into a flame war with the Marxists on
the list.

Oh no, the Coneheads are canon.  They are mentioned in the Traveller

They built a decoy of a crashed enemy ship, complete with debris, 
fires, etc. then they gassed, shot, etc, etc the crew of the spaceplane 
that came for a look, stole it and invaded the orbiter.

Kyle Schuant:

Again, I don\'t quite buy it. Codes are crackable. If
your PCs have among them an engineer, it\'s going to be
his first priority, I\'d imagine.

* * *

Me2:

Absolutely all codes are crackable. However this is <cue kettle drums> the
future where  such \'codes\' could be hideously complex. Re-configuring
transponders in the Trav Universe for example are supposed to be along the
lines of \'practically impossible\' without muchos forgery, electronics and
computer skills and associated equipment. In RL, we\'re seeing the rise of
engine imbolizers so when the plods spot a reported stolen vehicle they just
cut the engine via a radio signal (though admittedly a mechanic could
disable the unit and it\'s more a case of catching the vehicle from where it
is stolen to where it is going for disassembly). 

Imagine <various wavy lines appear on scream as we view the future>. Skipped
vessel arrives in imperial starport. Local bank branch has a feed from
starport control, keeping an eye out for all vessels under its re-payment
plan. It automatically hooks up to the black box it has installed to prevent
skipping (an integral part of the jump drive without which the vessel cannot
jump were it removed) to check for tampering. What\'s this? Someone has had a
go at it? - awooga, awooga, awooga - ding ding ding - starport control
prevents the vessel from leaving so an investigation can take place. 

I don\'t imagine the banks loading up their \'how to prevent a skip\' computer
hardware/software with substandard or easily bustable codes. That would be
stoopid. Given the vast amount of monies invested, there would have to be a
way to prevent skipping. And given that communication is limited to jump,
and a vessel could jump anywhere, then that prevention would have to be on
the ship itself. Especially as the collateral for the loan is usually the
ship itself for small time merchants.

I like the idea of cheaper ships though. That would solve a lot of problems
(especially on the whole collateral issue).

Getting the price of ships too low, though, has its own problems. 

Military ships will always be much more expensive than civilian
(even para-military/pirate) ships. They will have more armor, more
expensive weapons and hiediously expensive sensors that the civilian
ships won\'t have.

So, let\'s limit our discussion to civilian ships.  For *merchant
ships* just how low can we reasonably go and not wreak the feel of
the game?

20,000 per dton?
10,000 per dton?

And what systems do we reduce in price to get the total price down?  

Power plant?
Jump Drive?
Sensors?

Yeah, there\'s four to date, all in the same universe:

The Star Fraction
The Cassini Division
The Stone Canal
The Sky Road

Cassini Division is the one with the most stuff on the posthumans.  One of
the things they do is *infect computers*!  So the humans are forced, for a
time, to resort to the use of Babbage engines, and they have a bit of a
fleet out there watching what is going on, in a rather New Era setup.

It\'s actually fairly Travellerish material.  Unfortunately there is only
one interstellar colony, described in Stone Canal, and they use a wormhole
method to get there.

It\'s biggest weakness is the obscurity of the jokes - they\'re actually
pretty good, but you need an understanding of far-left political history to
get them.  It\'s on the level of someone being described as a "Transitional
Programmer" - a pun on the Trotskyist "Transitional Programme", crossed
with the idea of programming non-deterministic computer systems, like AIs.

Complex, shomplex. If the damn thing is worth
millions, the PCs will make the effort (or maybe my

week-long jumps with nothing out the window but swirly
grey jump space, what else is there to do?

Imagine  <various wavy lines appear on scream as we

sometimes!) They swipe the transponder (57th century
number plate? Do they make them on that prison planet
in the other thread?) from another ship... or Engineer
Jo _makes_ her own transponder from scratch (made up
number plate!) I can _almost_ believe interstellar
banks could communicate with at Jump-6 and co-operate
with on the ground local law enforcement, and that the
local law would actually place a priority on such
things, but the idea that each local law agency has a
list of all ships everywhere and finds that yours is
unregistered...! No way. Just like today: if you\'ve
never comitted a crime (or the records indicate nobody
of your name, or your ship has done so) then you;re
not on the records. 

An article recently described the volume of trade in
the Imperium; going on modern models, you;re looking
at a ton per person per year... what\'s the average
freight, then, per ship? Divide that into the number
of people in the Imperium, and that\'s how many ships
are flying around... even if .01% of them are Free
Traders and other PC-type ships, that\'s a heck of a
lot for the law to keep track of.

I say, it\'ll be much like cars: so long as you don\'t
run anybody over or use the thing to rob a bank, the
law will pretty much leave you alone.

Kyle had the last word:
Of course, the only other solution is that bansk won\'t
finance jump-capable ships... the PCs must spend the
first part of their career in a single system, making
enough to pay off the ship and get a jump drive...
Just an idea!:)

Kyle replied:
Well, IMTU as I\'ve said it\'s from the old GURPS:
Space, so everything\'s cheaper... There are different
classes of hull available, though. I think we can all
imagine the difference between the hull on a four seat
Piper and an Apache! Also, the electronics is a huge
part of the cost. Military ships have much more
sophisticated systems overall. There\'s a big
difference in cost between collision-avoidance radar
and military targeting head-up-displays, and so on. If
anybody is interested in the exact costs, email me
privately and I\'ll send them, but it works out that
your standard free trader, unarmed, no stealth
ability, just enough engines to get it off largish
earth-type planets, Jump-1, a hull that\'s internally
tough but not armoured, and staterooms for the PCs,
about a quarter its volume for cargo, that\'ll set PCs
back, new, 500 kCr. Whereas your military fighter
ship, hugely manoeuverable, well armed and armoured,
sophisticated electronics and so on, will set you back
18 MCr.

Basically, high tech and weapons cost a lot, ships
themselves, not so much.

Of course the cheapest ever in my game came when the
PCs had fled their ship from a Vargr boarding party
and left it to self-destruct (a la The Enterprise),
and landed on a TL 7 world. The engineer was able to
produce a Jump drive by enrolling in the Research
department of a local university... But a ship? What
could they do? They noticed in the papers that there
were disarmanent talks going on (Balkanised world), so
they sold their Jump drive design to the local
national government in exchange for an old missile
submarine... the government thought they were idiots
because the sub had had its engines removed, and of
course the warheads. The PCs took the missiles out and
strapped them to the sides of the sub, hooked up the
diesel generator to the jump drive, recast the hatches
so that they\'d resist pressure form the inside instead
of the outside, installed some comofortable seats, and
took off.
The Good Ship Jabberwocky, as it was known, did not go
far, but it got them off the world.

    "The two Air Force C-141 Starlifters were on their way to a rendezvous
with a KC-135 tanker over central Oregon one day in the summer of 1998 when
they heard a pilot calling Seattle Central to report that the engine of her
Cessna Turbo 210 had failed. She said she was going down. The voice was
calm, precise. Center was unaware of the Cessna pilot\'s dire circumstances
because the light aircraft\'s transmissions were blocked by the foothills in
the remote, forested area.
    The Air Force pilots, reservists with the 446th Airlift Wing at McCord
AFB in Washington, began relaying messages between the Cessna pilot and air
traffic control. The woman gave her altitude and position; she knew she was
too low to dead stick to any airport.
    "I see a road - too many trees!" There were no more transmissions.
    After alerting ATC, the transport pilots banked their huge aircraft and
began a dash toward the Cessna\'s last reported position, about 100 miles
away - 12 minutes by Starlifter. What they found there was a sea of green
pines stretching forever. The two airplanes split, the crew in one searching
north and the other south.
    Presently, flight engineer Master Sergeant Todd "Buck" Murray tapped
co-pilot Lieutenant Colonel Pete Buehn on the shoulder and pointed out the
right side window at what appeared to be a white log. Command Pilot Captain
Paul Parrinelli closed in for a better look. Bingo! A 210 buried among tall
pines. There was no sign of fire. Or life.
    The two transports began circling the Cessna, with the high one
transmitting news of its find. Help would be on its way, but the crews were
frustrated. Directly below was a pilot who, if alive, was probably hurt,
possibly dying, and they could do nothing except watch.
    Then off in the distance, they spotted a rooster tail of dust. They
zoomed toward it to investigate, hoping it was a rescue team. But it was
only a pickup truck galloping along one of several dirt and gravel logging
roads that cut through the forest. As the truck drew closer, now tooling
along a road that passed near the downed airplane, Parrinelli and Buehn had
a quick strategy session.
    Rod Holman, an alfalfa farmer, was taking a shortcut home through the
Fremont National Forest when he spotted the C-141\'s crisscrossing the road
up ahead. They were low. Way low. He slowed his Ford F250 so his wife and
boys could take in the improbable  airshow. Just then one of the grey
behemoths roared overhead, so low the truck shook in the wake that then
churned the tips of the surrounding pines. The aircraft pitched up and
banked hard to the right.
    "Holy smoke" uttered Holman. And then he spotted it. Over to the right,
about a 150 feet in the forest, was an airplane jammed in among the trees.
Holman stopped the truck, got out, and approached. At first he thought the
thing was abandoned, but as he got closer he saw fresh blood all over the
cockpit. 
    He looked inside, dreading what he would find. But there was Patty
Burrell, shaken, but very much alive.  In fact, apart from a head gash and
some disorientation, the 69-year old instrument instructor was in remarkably
good condition.
    Just then the two Lockheeds roared by again, and in that instant Holman
understood the purpose of the pilots wild performance: They had been using
their giant aircraft as distress flags.
    Burrell fully recovered from her injuries and replaced here wreaked 210
with a Cessna 182. Meanwhile, she and the Holman family were adopted as
honorary members of the 446th. They celebrated their good fortune over an
Air Force barbecue."

Hum, I roughed out a 200dton Jump 1 ship, no weapons, minimal hull,
and not many extras...it ran about 8 million new.  That\'s *far*
cheaper than other traveller systems, but still expensive for a PC
group.  By it used for 50%, make a 10% downpayment and the PC\'s have
to come up with 400,000 cr. That\'s doable for a group. 

In most Traveller settings the interest rate on Ship loans is
something like 3%.  In GURPS I think the normal rates are more like
8 to 12%.  If you lower the initial price, I think you need to raise
the interest rate to keep monthly payments about the same.

     John:
The problem is that the Bill of Rights, as well as labor and environmental
laws only apply within its borders.  In the 3rd world Pax Americana mostly
seems to mean freedom for US corporations to screw the locals, with
practices ranging from killing labor organizers (as has happened in several
African nations) to actual use of slave labor, or work agreements with
nations who use slave labor (for example the PRC). 

I don\'t know if you can label them as US corporations, they\'re
multi-nationals. Sure most of the biggies are US born, bred and based, but
they\'re screwing everyone. However the share-holders of said corps
invariably come from the wealthy west and the US is the biggest chunk of
that particular unsavory pie. 
	
John again:
		It\'s great for US consumers, but w/o effective resistance
the US is free to suck the 3rd world dry.  It actually looks a lot like the
earliest parts of the 3rd Imperium. 

Good call.

	John some more:
		While a US-run world government might end up somewhat more
free on average (though I\'m fairly sure negative economies of scale would
make the effort a disaster) the Pax American is in part merely a grand
neocolonial moneymaking endeavor. 

It\'s not US run, more US led -  rather Pax America facilities and  doesn\'t
necessarily dominate (though in practice it more often than not does).
Although this is because it is rich, rich, rich, capitalistic and so are its
G8 chums (except Russia - are they a part?) and it\'s true that corps do get
a largely free reign. Be that as it may, most in the US have a social,
environmental and ethical conscience and they do exercise that right. We
know what multi-nationals are doing, and although they might be having a
more profitable time thanks to \'Yay Capitalism\', us socialistic types of the
western world are slowly putting the kybosh on the more un-palatable parts.
Unfortunately very very very slowly and in cleaning up our own yard more, we
can pollute others. For example, the clamping down on Tobacco in the US
means better and more secure profits are to be had, in say asia, where sexy
chicks strut the street handling out free packs of Marlborough and smoking
controls are non-existent. 
 
Dang! I can see where you are coming from. But in a free, healthy middle
class society with a good dose of \'what is right\' we can and do change
policy. In Aust. we are seeing shame lists of dirty corporations
proliferating and the government itself has a black-ban on purchasing
services or products against those that violate these rules. Hell, look at
the 60\'s.

	John:
		Note that Saddam Hussein remains in power despite the
atrocities he\'s inflicted on his own people and others. However, the US made
sure to keep cheap oil coming out of Kuwait and Saudi.  It looks like the
motives involved have much more to do with money than with anything else.

Again you have a point. But it\'s not just the oil. US DOD could not go for
all of Iraq, they didn\'t have the mandate, it went against the heart of \'we
don\'t fight if we can\'t win and get out\' and it would have caused a
sh*tstorm for the next 100 years geo-politically speaking (especially with a
then still mean and capable Russia & co). And it\'s not just \'cause of oil -
no-one can accuse the US of putting economics in front in Bosnia, though it
took them literally years to get in there (no oil). <Oh this is my opinion,
it has nothing to do with ADOD>. 

Okay, so Pax Americana has its flaws. But we can see them and that\'s a
start.

And I like Friends. Is that bad <g>

Chandler funnee.

Ob Traveller; Pax Americana is kind of like the Imperium in attempting to

Then there\'s a world in the Albadawi Subsector, Solomani Rim 0330,

The only Cassini Division I know is the one in the Interplanetary

the Hubble, Tycho, and Galileo divisions), consisting of the teams
representing Ganymede, Io, Titan, Vesta, and Miranda. BTW, Neptune is

Adventure idea... some rogue bank decides to extend your ship loan

they want you to (interest and all that)... you have to break into the

I just watch Lex, which I feel captures the original Barbarella style even

Add in that film that Sean Connery is embarrassed by, and a few others, and

I\'m sorry Glenn, but you\'re completely wrong on this one.

There are not, and have never been, enough nuclear weapons on the planet to
completely wipe out even a single moderate sized country , say France, let
alone the entire world.

Your contention is a common fallacy, but in reality it would take some where
around a thousand times the maximum number of weapons to get close to even
taking out just the heavily populated parts of the planet, (let alone the
vast majority of the planet which is not heavily populated) and even that
would rely on careful placement of the weapons, and wouldn\'t be possible by
ballistic delivery.

While it is possible a release of all the available nuclear weapons _might_
cause major climatic changes, based on previous evidence such as the Taupo
and Krakatoa events (Taupo being estimated as the equivalent of 5 Gigatons
of TNT, about what the world\'s nuclear arsenal is capable of now) , it is
actually extremely unlikley that the much-touted "nuclear winter" would
occur for more than one season, if at all.

And even if it did, that would be nowhere near "wiping out all life on earth
several times over". In fact, it wouldn\'t even wipe it out once over, as
previous ice ages  have shown.

I suggest you actually examine the evidence in future before repeating this
sort of popular bull.

Yes I\'m surprised at that.  And thought it a bit of a cheek for Askegren\'s

I wonder if you mean Paul Brunette who wrote:

Both explicitly TNE novels (the third in the series - The Backwards Mask -

IMTU, under MT, I require the following for holding a ticket:
Unrated: Computer-0, Vacc Suit-0, Speak Galanglic. (This rating a
prerequisite for ALL ship crew tickets which follow) There is an exception
to galanglic made for Droyne. Droyne are required to speak galanglic to
test for Master\'s liscences.

Rated Tickets:
Pilot: Pilot-1, Commo-0, Sensor Ops-1
Navigator: Navigation-1, Computer-1, Sensor Ops-1, Commo-0
Steward, General: Medical-0, Steward 1, Admin-0
Steward, Purser: Admin-1, and General Steward ticket
Steward, Broker: Trader-0, Broker-1, Streetwise-0, Admin-1
Medic: Medical-1, Sensor Ops-0
Steward, Ship\'s Flight Physician: Medical-3, Admin-1, Sensor Ops-1, Steward-1
Engineer, general: Engineer-0, Mechanical-0, Electronics-0, Gravitics-0
Engineer, Systems: Mechanical-1, Electronics-1, Computer-1
Engineer, Drives: Engineer-1, Gravitics-1
Engineer, Ship\'s: Admin-1 and both systems and drives tickets.
Gunner: Turret Weapons-1, Screens-0
Ship\'s Master, 5th Class (<=400Td, Non-commercial only): Complete the prep
course, &/or own a ship. See below.

Advanced ("Master") Ratings
Ship\'s Master, 4th Class (<=400Td): Admin-0, Legal-0, Commo-0, SensorOps-0,
Interview-0, and any rated ticket, plus 4 years active merchant service or
2 years as a naval officer, Pirate Officer, or Scout.
Ship\'s Master, 3rd Class (<=1000Td): Admin-1, Legal-1, Pilot-1, Nav-1,
SensorOps-1, Commo-0.
Ship\'s Master, 2nd Class (any non-combattant): SM3c Ticket, plus Leader-1,
Interview-1
Ship\'s Master, 1st Class (Combattants): SM2c Ticket, plus Ship Tactics-1,
Instruction-1, Interrogation-0.
Engineer, Master: Ship\'sEngineer Cert, plus Naval Architect-1, PLUS any two
skills required by the lower engineering ratings at level 2.
Steward, Counsel: Medical-1, Admin-2, Legal-3, Steward-2, Broker-1 (this is
the guy who bails you out in Imperial Admiralty Courts) plus 4 years
merchant service or Naval Service.


IMTU, I have the IISS and the IN both run ticket tests, but the ratings are
actually issued through the scouts. You can get rated at any scout base,
naval base, or class-A or Class-B Starport within J2 of an X-Boat route,
and any class C port ON an x-boat route. You may only test any given skill
once per month. Test attempts are included in the actual card\'s database.

The Test: Routine, (once each skill) and Edu. Safe, Fateful, Uncertain. 1
Hour (Expected thus is thus 10 hours, you have 16 to complete the test;
exceeding time allowed is a failure). DM+1 if repeating test taken within
past six months.
Roll this task for each skill required. On Total Truth, rated at skill
level. On SOme truth, Rating for skill = Skill +1d3-2. On No Truth, Skill
rated at Level-1d3. Count Level 0 as a step, and no skill at all as one
level below level 0. Taking the test costs Cr100 per skill tested, plus
Cr100 to apply for the rating.
If your Assesed skill levels possess all the skills, but at insufficient
levels for the ticket sought, you obtain a "Mate\'s" ticket in that rating.
If you LACK ANY skill (according to the assessment, not the character
sheet), you will not pass. If your assessed rating lackssome but not all of
the skills, it will be noted that you are striking for the rating.
If your assessed skills equal or exceed the required levels for the ticket
sought, you will be granted the rating proper.

Note: Skill tests are generally available in any language spoken in the
local subsector or within J6, plus the following: Vilani, Old High Vilani,
Sylean, Galanglic, Aslan, Oynprinth, Newt, Virush, Geonee, Vegan.

Getting the Unrated Spacer\'s Ticket
Simple, Computer, VaccSuit, 15 minutes, Fateful, Safe. (Expected time is 3
hours; limit is 4 hours. Increase difficulty by one step per each skill
missing.) This test is only issued in galanglic or Oynprinth; if taken in
oynprinth, it will be limited to ships operated by a known Droyne
Population Center (Read as a droyne government). Any character with
Merchant, Naval, Pirate, scout, or Marine background ends CGen possessing
this ticket. This ticket is a lifetime rating, but must be renewed every 4
years. It may be renewed without retest if not lapsed 4 or more years.

Also, I grant every PC any non-masters tickets they qualify for before
mustering out, if they have a naval, marine, scout, merchant, or pirate
background. Anyone else with ship-specific skills may be rated; they have
to ask the GM...

IMTU, a master\'s liscence is required to be a ship\'s captain. The IISS will
run a certification prep course for both the unrated spacer\'s ticket and
the 4th class master\'s ticket, and a Pilot\'s Mate Ticket. The combined
course takes 9 weeks, grants 1AT to each of the following skills if they
are not possessed: Pilot, Nav, VaccSuit,  Legal, Admin, Steward, Interview,
Commo, Sensor Ops. You get Computer 0 and VaccSuit-0 automatically. Roll
standard AT testing rolls at completetion of course. Cost is KCr5 for the
course, it is residential, and intense; no outside communications are
allowed during the course. At the end of the course, you get an unrated
ticket, a "5th Class Master\'s Ticket" which is limited to 400 tons
Displacement, non-commercial service, and incedental employment as master
only. The 5th class will also be issued to anybody with any other rated
ticket who is in a first mate slot, or a department head. Basically, this
allows yachters.

Since some versions of Traveller include Cook as a separate skill
(FF&S2, page 80, refers to Cook skill), I would include a ticket (that
falls under the Steward category) for Steward (Cook), which would allow
Cook 1 to substitute for Steward 1 as a rated ticket.  No more than 1/2
of required General Steward billets (round up) could be filled by
Steward (Cook) ticket holders.

I would also allow a Steward (Chef) ticket, based on the FF&S2 reference
above, which would require the following skills:

Steward, Chef: Cook-3 _or_ Steward-4, and Purser ticket (see original
post below)

> Steward, Purser: Admin-1, and General Steward ticket

In order to carry High passengers, any ship with six or more steward
billets would need to carry at least one Steward (Chef), who would fill
one of the billets.  (Smaller ships are not expected to provide gourmet
cuisine for their High passengers, and thus are exempt from the chef
requirement.)

<<snip>>

> Steward, Ship\'s Flight Physician: Medical-3, Admin-1, Sensor Ops-1, Steward-1

I would drop the Steward requirement for this billet.  YMMV.

<<snip engineer tickets>>

> Gunner: Turret Weapons-1, Screens-0

For larger ships, I would include a Screens ticket, which would require
Screens-1, Turret Weapons-0.  Gunner and Screens billets could be filled
by holders of either ticket, although pay rates would be base on skill
in the billet, rather than higest skill on the ticket.

Note that T4 doesn\'t list Naval Architect as a skill (although I think
it should be available; if you include this skill, let your players know
ahead of time).

Why is Medical skill included (assuming that the counselor in question
is serving as a specialist, rather than as a generic steward with extra
skills)?

I would allow any character who receives a ship as a mustering-out
benefit (and also has all prerequisite skills) an automatic Master\'s
ticket for the appropriate class of vessel.  Further, I would allow a
ship owner or primary operator to receive a provisional Master\'s ticket
(regardless of skills), which would allow shipment of non-hazardous
cargo (no passengers) within certain specified shipping lanes.  Routine
passenger traffic would require a Master\'s 4th Class or better ticket,
although one-shot passages would not fall under this category.  (As an
analogy, if I pick up a hitch-hiker, I don\'t need a special license,
even if the passenger pays me gas money.  OTOH, I would need a
chauffeur\'s license to drive a bus or taxicab.)

Naval officers with combat commands (if generated using High Guard)
would automatically carry Master\'s tickets based on their rank at the
time of command:  O3 or less, Master 5th class; O4-O5, Master 3d class;
O6+, Master 1st class.  Note that naval officers with combat commands do
_not_ have to possess all (or any) required skills to obtain the ticket
appropriate to their rank; commanding a ship in combat is considered
prima facie evidence of ability to command a vessel.  Naval officers
without combat commands at the desired level must possess all required
skills for a given ticket to receive that ticket; in such a case,
receipt of the ticket is automatic (this could indicate a peacetime
command, or preparation for peacetime command).
 
> IMTU, a master\'s license is required to be a ship\'s captain.

See above for my suggestions on exceptions to this rule.

Just extend the age table for ships. A ship that\'s a century old should
still be usable, but won\'t be "worth" as much.

Ther\'s a consistant "off by 1" error, all these drives can reach the hex
that you start in. Thus the divisor is 7, not 6.

Either way, it still destroys canon, simply because it now only takes
three jumps for a jump 1 ship to go the same distance as a jump 5.

Craig\'s response puts it better but it must be remembered that the age of

to compete
with ships in the tens of thousands of dT.

Apart from canal barges and other local shipping, nobody today would buy a

less than a thousand dT.

At a guess, even a 747 must be 50dT.

especially if one of the terms is that all the notification is for it to

But will the PCs remember this when the insurance company is bought

That\'s not strictly true.

It is possible to devise a code with a completely random
encription. Ie every letter uses a different key and there
is no pattern to the sequence of keys.

The problems with this are:

a) the code book is bigger than the message (since you have
   a substitution table for each letter.)

b) only people with a complete code book can use the code.

c) how do you transmit and secure the code book?

However, none of these stop this being used in the real world.
(See under one time pad.) The simple example being a spy who
can collect their code book from their contact.

In Traveller, these code books can be sent out by secured
transport and only accessed from secure buildings.
This doesn\'t stop people stealing them, but it
stops your computer-8 guy breaking the code.

Now you could steal the code book, copy it and then put it back...
That would be an interesting scenario.

Under T4, ships work out about 100kCr/dT for merchants,
500kCr/dT for paramilitary and 1MCr/dT for Military.
Fighters and SDBs (not having all that jump fuel)
tend to be 2MCr/dT or more.

That\'s way too cheap. A book 5 party could probably buy
one outright, just from mustering out benefits.

I don\'t know how much cargo you can carry, but it\'s not
going to be at 1kCr/dT.

Plus all your PCs will have to take a pay cut. No one
will pay out almost 400KCr/year on the crew for such a ship.

The Gnat class is only sold to people who don\'t mind being
shot up by passing free traders.
The Imperial Heavy Fighter (at 50dT) is well over 100MCr.

WRONG!

There are codes that *cannot* be cracked by any means except
someone stealing the code book. These codes are in use today
and I don\'t mean a "computer the size of the universe
takes the lifetime of the universe to solve it unless the TL35
INT 25 math genius who your PCs have as an engineer makes the
mathematical breakthrough that has stumped the greatest minds
in the Imperium for a thousand years" type of problem.

I mean a code where the only solution to a four hundred letter
message is to print out all possible 400 letter messages and
say "It might be one of these, pick one."

The only limitations on using these methods everywhere,
is how to transmit the vast code books required,
how to generate the codes and how do you contact someone
you don\'t know using such a code.

Solutions to these problems are being worked on. I don\'t
understand but it\'s "quantum".

</rant>

And I\'ll bet he only needed a 12 on 2d6*...

*adjust according to rules system.

That\'s probably because no one has actually seen them yet!

Not an aerodynamic one as the poster had suggested.

Or even if you *do* mind. :-D   This is the campaign where the PCs are

Well, Frank, I don\'t know if that\'s the point...

If we imagine a hypothetical situation where you\'re approached by someone who
you know for absolutely certain can beat the living hell out of you, who has
a bat and says

 "I\'m going to break every bone in your body"

Are you going to tell him that it\'s not possible to break _every_ bone
and that chances are you\'ll still be left with most of your soft tissues
and internal organs intact?

My personal reaction would be to accept his thesis and ponder its finer
points from a bit further away. 

The point is that it\'s not something we ever want to even try to 
verify empirically, so debating it is kind of irrelevant.

Big empty fields are also nice places to fire meson guns into, or to drop
nukes on.  Grabbing the downport not only gives you a nice place to land
the *huge* transports the Army uses (wait \'til y\'all see these puppies!)
but also convenient refueling, repair, communication and sensor facilities.

This will probably happen in many cases, but the Imperial War plan is to
overwhelm a single point with massive force.  A entire Marine Regiment,
supported by orbital fire and fighters, is going to be hard to stop.

The only worlds the Imperium really worries about are those with over one
million inhabitants.  Below that, just move in and garrison the place.  The
Imperium also has a policy of *not* using WoMD unless there is no other
option.  In almost every case it is easier to keep pouring troops in than
earn the hatred of the locals for flattening cities.

One can make this argument only by ignoring everything about the
governments themselves.  (Qin consolidated power in -221 or -222 or
something, BTW).  The infamous "examination system" alone changed
drastically; how it operated, and its underlying assumptions, in the Ming
or Qing would have been unrecognizable to someone from the Tang, let alone
the Han.  The central functions of government were in a constant state of
reinvention.  That\'s *why* there\'s big fat sections in each of the
dynastic histories (plus piles of adjunct handbooks) dealing with
governmental institutions and procedures; they kept changing out from
underneath \'em.  Some key symbols and fragments of ideology persisted, or
more accurately kept resurfacing and disappearing, but once you start to
really look at it, there wasn\'t a hell of a lot.  Less continuity than you
could find, say, in political philosophy & symbolism between the western
Roman empire and 18th century western Europe.

(It\'s worth keeping in mind that the "Chinese empire" had some sizeable
gaps, between the Han and the Sui, the Tang and the Song, the Song and the
Yuan.  Not to mention the long periods where official dynasties still, on
the books, in power, had lost control over large sections of territory, in
which rival governments ("non-orthodox dynasties") existed.)

Because we can destroy all life on earth?  Well, anyway, I\'ll try just to
be a flaming retard, then.  If all you mean by "Chinese emperor" is "held
central and local power over the area traditionally called \'China\'", then
sure.  THe structure of government power and operations is radically
different from anything that came before it.

Much earlier.  Gudea was a rearguard bureaucrat whose job was to distract
attention from the removal of the Unspeakable Procedure to central
Anatolia, where the Vilani refugees disguised themselves as "Hittites" and
subjected the region to endless management retreats and productivity
seminars.

Adventure answer:

PC\'s walk into local MOJ office..."I know where there is a nest of
pirates...they\'re trying to steal _our_ ship!" and gives location of said
rogue bank.

A few platoons of Imperial Auditors land and persuade said bank from ding
that.

That\'s a DIRECT interference with interstellar trade, and the IMOJ is
going to be _quite_ interested in them for that. 

Of course a evil sadistic ^H^H^H^H^H good GM will allow a few NPC
\'executives\' of such a bank, who are always identified with their
nicknames in quotes in the news stories, to get away. Now the PC\'s spend a
lot of time looking over their shoulders.

Why? Who cares? If the prisoners are alone on the world, then who
cares what they build? besides, if future prisoners are anything like
modern prisoners, they don\'t come from a highly educated background
(one of the reasons they\'re criminals in the first place...). I really
doubt that even given a gigantic hunk of pure iron ore sitting right
out in a field that they\'d get much above a stone age existance.

There may be some assumptions that I\'m missing out on though.

I think the problem is that the average sci-fi writer (and Leonard)
pictures a planet full of criminals who have the amazing breadth
and depth of knowledge... of a science fiction writer (or Leonard).

I\'m not saying criminals are dumb, but they\'ve put most of their
energy toward developing skills other than ore smelting and 
metallurgy.

On even a semi-garden world the local flora is going to 
have more than enough of what prisoners can make use of.

If they\'re on the equivalent of a rockball, the whole premise 
breaks down for me as I don\'t see how the prisoners are going
to get that whole O2-CO2 thing working.

I think that you underestimate the level of possible damage. Let\'s talk EMP
damage for starters. If you don\'t think the death toll in North America and
Europe wouldn\'t be horrendous I think that you\'re mistaken. Hundreds of
millions would die just because the infrastructure gacked when all of the
electronics stopped working. Without the infrastructure the countries would
cease to exist. There would be starvation, epidemic, riots, looting, etc.
At the height of the cold war multiple warheads were armed at almost every
section of the American continent.  Almost every state had more than one
target, even if only military assets were hit. The balance of the U.S.
population lives in these areas. The separated enclaves that might survive
would no longer be a civilization, at least not a 20th century tech level
civilization.
This ignores the general level of radioactive fallout that would exist. The
accident in Chernobyl result in a measurable increase in radionucleides in
the milk of dairy cows as far away as Norway. The probable levels of
radiation from the blasts and level of contamination from the fallout would
make the lives of the survivors very unpleasant.
Even just a couple of years of nuclear winter would result in a huge number
of deaths. We are a society where ever small numbers of people raise the
food for the population as a whole. The loss of the ability to do this alone
would result in large numbers of deaths.

Oops, almost forgot.  I\'m also writing this policy in to give the Army and

 The current US Space Shuttle is pretty close in size to a Traveller Shuttle 
(ie. 95 DTons), so a little extrapolation puts a 747 (used to carry the 
Shuttle around) firmly in the 180+ DTon range.

I know what the *books* say, but that wasn\'t the question.  The
question was how low *could* the costs be without wreaking the feel
of the game.

That\'s also about 1/10th of what I calculated such a ship to cost
using GURPS:Space.  A 200dt Free Trader type ship, unarmed,
unarmored, no stealth, 1g/J1, 4 crew/10 passengers cost about 8
million new, about half that for a serviceable, but old ship.  A PC
party get into one of them, given a required 10% downpayment.

The above ship works out to 40k per ton new, and down to about 20k
per ton used.  You could get this by reducing construction costs to
40% of standard, or for ease of conversion make it 50%.  How does
that sound to everyone?

Hmm, must be november...time for the Traveller <> Real Life rant.;-)

In real life, yes. In real life Traveller wold be dull boring and no fun.
A real-life depiction of prison is boring, brutish and not very
interesting. Notice, in the game that started this thread, placing the
characters on that prison world ended the game.

While this may be acceptable to the particular players in that game (they
didn\'t like their characters any more, they were shipping out, got jobs in
other cities, etc) in general in ongoing roleplaying games it is a BAD
IDEA to stuff PC\'s in hopeless situations. _Almost_ hopeless is another
kettle of fish, but \'You\'re here, no hope of escape, no hope of parole,
you die of old age\' in a game I wanted to continue would (and has) made me
look twice before gaming with that person again, at least with them as GM.
(I had a good friend who lloved to put the PC\'s in these utterly
untenable situations: 

"You wake up in a cave, things feel weird."

"Weird how?"

"The light is wrong, and gravity doesn\'t seem to work right."

"We look out the cave"

"As you stand there, a huge portal opens in the air and hordes off demonic
looking things start pouring out. They are marching toward the cave."

"We try to leave."

"Too late, the vanguard reaches you. You are taken prisoner and marched
back through the portal."

"Huh?"

"You are lead to a huge, bloody altar, with thousands of dead bodies
heaped nearby."

"HUH??!!"

"The first of you are lead to the altar, where a goat-thing with huge
muscular arms splits you in half."

"Ok, lets play something different now...")

What Leonard, (and all those SF writers) are doing is setting up a far
more cinematic universe, where criminals are evil geniuses (repeat after
me: "Before I kill you, Mr. Bond..." ;-) Player characters could even
think about owning ships, let alone run around with battledress, and life
is interesting enough for people to play escapist games about it.

Frankie, the number of weapons deployed was definitely enough to wipe out
civilization as we know it. The US had at least one warhead per city of
50,000 persons in the Soviet Block (USSR & Warsaw Pact). The USSR had
enough warheads for stauration of the same. The total tonnage Per World
Capita was 2.5KT per person on the planet (assuming a planetary Pop of 5
Billion) [Time Magazine, 1990 or so, similar data published in Defense
Weekly in about 87] Since most (75%) of the worlds population lives in
concentrations where 2.5KT could easily wipe out more than 20 persons...

Add to that the non-nuclear armaments: Chem, Bio, and FAE, and the raw
destructive capacity that was DEPLOYED was Mutual Assured Destruction of
SOCIETIES. When you can drop a 0.5GT Warhead on EVERY production center in
the warsaw pact, and the Warsaw Pact can do the same to N. America and
Western Europe, that, as far as I am concerned, is enough to end the world
as we know it. And this doesn\'t count those 8" 2.5KT Artillery Nukes. I\'ve
read the US Army\'s FM on them (I know, I shouldn\'t have)... They were field
deployed.

Anyone who claims the Cold war was just a dream obviously slept through the
whole thing. I\'ve met far too many polish and russian ex-patriots, and too
many of my US fellow citizens, who\'ve lived in terror because they know
just how close nuclear war really came to being. People who are aware of
just how often DefCon 2 has been reached. People whose jobs have been to Be
Ready.

Ob Trav: There can be no comparable threat against the Imperium. Due to the
distances involved, and the scales of targets, any atrocities done will be
at worst a slow wave-front moving inward. Even the Star Trigger, if it
worked, is a marginally viable threat... you still have to deliver it.

No, I don\'t.

While your arguments are all valid, I was _specifically_ countering Glenn\'s
suggestion that there are enough nuclear weapons to wipe out all life on
earth several times ago.

Some specific points :

I agree that the die-off rate in industrialized countries would be huge.
The estimates are something like a 8-10% kill immediately on the first wave
with about 70% secondary kill (i.e: through starvation, radiation, rioting,
etc.).

That\'s a lot of death and sufferring, but,  even a 99% kill of humans in
industrialized nations is _nowhere_near_ eliminating the human race or
destroying the planet, and the technological level of the survivors is
completely irrelevant to my argument (though if you want to argue that
seperately I do reckon technlogy would not just dissappear as all the
post-apocalypse stories seem to asume. )

Although from memory, that research is questionable, as there were no base
data to show that there had, in fact, been an increase. It just showed that
the levels now were higher than expected.

This is true, though again I feel the effects have been overrated. I believe
studies on the effects of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs have shown that
while people at the time and their immediate descendants had/have noticeable
effects, third generation offspring are not any more likely to suffer
effects than others.

Note the point is that _you_ are in a society where small numbers raise
food.
The majority of the world\'s population are not in such a society.

I fully agree that the US, Europe, & Japan would be stuffed.
Whether I think that\'s a bad thing or not depends on my attitude at the
time.

I don\'t have the appriopriate reference handy (and even those are edcuated
estimates as the exact figures are kept secret)  but from memory the US only
has _produced_ in the _tens_ of thousands of nuclear warheads since they
began production, (from memory around 40,000, of which the majority are no
longer viable & have been scrapped)  and the USSR has produced less . Even
adding in China,  France, England, Israeils, Indians and Pakisanis, I doubt
there are many more than 100,000 nuclear warheads extant today. Heck, based
on current figures I may be remembering the figures larger than they are.

How many cities ? I don\'t know, but I suspect there are more than a 100,000
cities in the North America alone, depending on your definition of city.

Even if I\'m out by a factor of ten in the wrong way, and there\'s a million
warheads out there, the effective radius of even the largest nukes is no
more than thirty miles. If you do the math, you\'ll find that even with a
million  nukes that\'s only a fraction of the surface of the planet.

And that assumes that the nukes are set off to cover maximum area, which is
_highly_ unlikely. In the event of a full scale nuclear war (again, highly
unlikely, but just assuming) , some nuke\'s would never be launched or not go
off, others would be destroyed by ABM and AA systems, others would be used
for exoatmospheric EMP and intelligence denial , some targets would be
designated for overkill, and others would be given military targets well
away from large population centers (such as naval fleet concentrations and
"second-strike" SSBNs )

BTW, from references I do have handy,  ( Strategy & Tactics) the numbers  in
the 70\'s were even lower. At that time the number of US delivery systems was
about 22,000 with the USSR having about 14,000. While they had more warheads
than delivery systems, including the nuclear shells for the old Long Tom,
and the fact that some delivery systems were MIRV,  the difference between
delivery systems and warheads is not practically useful.

Also, according to the latest S&T, the US currently only has 580 ICBM\'s and
432 SLBNs in 18 SSBNs. Russia has 800 ICBM\'s and 540 SLBNs in 22 SSBNs.

The second thing is that nuclear weaponry is no longer the main weapon of
detterrence. As it says in "In Athena\'s Camp" (John Arquilla, 1997) and
other recent  military doctrine studies, it is now quite likely that a
technological force, such as the US military, could destroy the majority of
amn enemy nuclear power\'s nuke forces on the ground in a first strike using
_conventional_ weapons, thus avoiding the PR problems of launching a nuclear
first strike.

People have always overestimated the nuclear power\'s capability to wage
nuclear war, and it is becoming increasingly a secondary capacity to other
doctrines such as AirLand Battle 2000, C2 (or C4ISR, depending on your
politics), and Informtuion Warfare

Well, to be realistic and still semi-interesting, I would leave the
planet untouched, make the criminals smart, but fairly un-metallurgically
inclined and have the players do the good stuff like smelting pig iron
and rolling it out into some sort of orbital launch vehicle.

For PCs to do the ridiculous to impossible, sure. But not _everyone_.

Interesting != totally unrealistic.

(Well, maybe for some people, but I doubt they play anything as
pedestrian as Traveller. AD&D or Vampire maybe)

This is the TML where people debate about whether free trader
ships, as designed in canon, can be used to run a profitable business 
and set up analysis frameworks to work within. And did I mention
priates? (ducks)

I mean, I am posting this to the TML right? 

Anyway, I\'m not totally fond of cinematic super-villans, so 
maybe that\'s it. Super or not, even if we have a bunch of
SCA-trained blacksmiths on killing sprees, so what if they
get the metal? What are they going to build? A railroad?
Skyscrapers? The Sydney Opera House? (hm, given a few hundred
years, I guess a bunch of criminals could build the Syndey
Opera House...)

Getting off-planet is about more than technology and knowledge,
it takes a big economy, which a prison planet just doesn\'t
have.

And so would India and mainland China from intentional, revenge, and
incidental hits and general fallout patterns.  In a general war, I
expect industral centers in the southern hemisphere would also be
hit...on the general principle of "if I die so do you."  And, of
course, many of the southern hemisphere countries aren\'t as
self-suffecient today as they were a hundred years ago, so they
might be well above the carrying capacity of the land without
chemical fertilizers, hybrid seeds, petrochemicals, and antibiotics.

Loss of all life on earth, no, not even all human life.  I wouldn\'t
be surprised if it was 80% to 90% worldwide.

Of course, this is the sort of thing I really wouldn\'t want to put
to a test. <g>

It is the point I\'m arguing, certainly, though you may not be interested in

The problem with the analogy is that the guy with the bat has _far_ more
chance of "breaking every bone in your body" than the nuclear powers have of
"wiping out every living thing on earth ten times over" which is what I was
disagreeing with.

Mine would be to strike first, taking out his sensor capability, in your
analogy, his eyes, which doesn\'t require brute strength, merely  finesse,
and _then_ avoid his bat. Heck, once his eyes were out of the way, he might
not even be a danger aymore. This is in fact what the US military has done,
and is why nuclear weapons are no longer the "big stick".

Except in that if people have an irrational fear of something, it may blind
them to more dangerous things.

Anyway, I believe in "Share what you know, learn what you don\'t"  and that
is my major motivation for disputing the misinformation that Glenn was
spreading.

Yes!  This precisely what I\'m talking about.  I won\'t post my
complete list, as it is similar to William\'s.

I *do* hope that Marc and Loren look closely at this list.  Please,
include something like it in future editions of Traveller.  It will
help even old-timers generate characters that can really *do* the
jobs they are aiming to take in the party.

And, don\'t you think this sort of thing is *better* than GURPS
templates?  Don\'t give me 90% of a character, just the minimum
skills the PC needs for various positions and I\'ll mix and match to
produce the PC I want.

    First off I want to say that I agree with the concept and premise of
your post. I did want to add some filler on your comment about Defcon\'s.
While I was in the Army (1969-1989) we went to Defcon 2 once and Defcon 3
three times. Now for the most part (earlier in my career) I might have been
unaware of exactly what was happening and missed something, but during the
latter half of my career I was more than involved.  As far as I know we
never even adjusted the Defcon status (we were at 4 because of terrorist
threats {Bader Meinhoff [sp?]} to our ground forces in Germany) when for
example the barracks was bombed in Beirut. As a matter of fact we didn\'t
change Defcon for our invasion of Grenada just 2 days later. (Oct. 23, 1983
& Oct. 25, 1983, respectively). The same could be said of our failed rescue
attempt in Iran in 1980. It was at 4 because of the hostage situation and it
never changed. It was rare indeed to see a change in Defcon to higher than
4.
    More interesting is the fact that the military uses "Threatcon" now to
warn of impending danger. I was over at Hanscom AFB, MA and the signs
("Threatcon Alpha") were everywhere. Actually they have been up for almost a
year now. This has nothing to with Defcon but (I believe) possible terrorist
activity. Maybe some of you who are on active duty now can explain this new
(to me) term.

In Fifth Frontier War terms, are these the J4, 0-0-6,
transports that can carry 600 troop factors?  (In 5FW,
500 troop factors are in an army, 100 per corps, 20
per division, 10 per brigade, 5 per regiment, 1 or 2

Of course, you do realise what commodity Terra was most uniquely suited to
provide for the Ziru Sirka, that few other worlds could provide in such
quantities and quality?  Biomass.  Pure, human compatible sh*t.

You may find that harder to do under the MAI, if/when that passes. But
that\'s a separate rant, which I won\'t get into here.


ObTrav: I see the Imperium as having a three-part power structure. The
megacorporations are one leg, the nobility is another, and the Emperor (and
Imperial organizations) the third. Depending on the era, the sphere, and
the situation, the exact balance between these groups keeps shifting. Which
makes for some interesting politics, and explains why the same group can be
both hero and villain. YMMV.

The problem with this is that given the extremely small numbers of US and
Russian ICBM\'s (under 1000 for the US, and just over for the CSS) and even
smaller numbers of Chinese ICBM\'s, no-one is likley to have enough strike
capacity spare to be able to indulge in such attacks.

Exactly.

I would be surprised at that level worldwide, though not surprised at such a
level for Europe Japan & the US.
However, it\'s possible.

Of course, I haven\'t factored in release of biological agents, which is
almost certain in any full war scenario, and which might well take the level
of human die-off over 90%

> Of course, this is the sort of thing I really wouldn\'t want to put

True.

Though I fully expect at least one limited nuclear war over the next
century, I doubt it would escalate.

One of the few scenarios I can think of where escalation is likely, is if a
biological agent is released in the US, killing much of the population .and
the remaining US deciding to do as much damage as possible to the rest of
the world out of spite.

I haven\'t bothered with an ObTrav: yet, but here\'s one.

Even in the 3I, nuking a planet "back to the Stone Age" would require a
_huge_ fleet investment and probably take several years to be certain.

To be blunt, nuclear weapons are not as useful or as destructive as good
mass drivers, so other than perhaps as tactical (battlefield) weapons and in
order to take out Tech7-8 comms nets via EMP, and perhaps to power X-Ray
laser mines, that sort of thing, would nukes really be considered useful
weapons in the 3I ?

Kyle replied:
Frank\'s quite right. However, I\'d like to add some
points. Firstly, just one missile could ruin a
country\'s economy, and ultimately causes millions of
death. Picture this - just one series of warheads
(eight 250 kton on a Russian SS-21 missile) Los
Angeles flattened, 3 million people vapourised
instantly, 6 million others dead within a week, 3
million others burned and irradiated, the public
utilities all destroyed (roads, water, and so on.)
Disease strikes a week later from the millions of
corpses rotting in the streets. Most of the surviving
population of LA County becomes refugees, the
authorities suddenly need food and housing for 5
million people. Could the USA cope with this?
Undoubtedly. But it would wreck its economy, and the
troops in Kosovo would definately be coming home.

Secondly, it\'s true nukes couldn\'t kill every person
in one big blast, but they could come damned close.
Expand the LA scenario there to "just" two largest
cities in every nation of over a million inhabitants.
This increases the number of disease and famine deaths
since nations are unable to help one another, and
barely able to help themselves. The "just one season
of nuclear winter" is pretty deadly, since it would
cause worldwide crop failure. There\'s plenty of food
to feed the world; but our reserves aren\'t that great
(we eat it as soon as we get it) and of course nations
would be keeping food to themselves; net importers of
food such as Japan would be in big trouble. All that,
even without the movie-style "breakdown of law and
order", starts pushing the fatalities pretty close to
100%...

You can\'t compare the explosion of lots of nukes with
the explosion of a volcano. A volcano does not have a
3million centigrade fireball, nor deadly radiation.
Its blast is often supersonic, but it doesn\'t usually
explode in the middle of a city (disaster movies
notwithstanding). Also, one big bang doesn\'t make as
much dust (for nuclear winters) as lots of "little"
bangs. Lots of little ones cause more damage; this is
the principle of the frag grenade.

Lastly, I\'m not terribly worried exactly how many
would die. I think that the thought that human life is
not extinct would be of cold comfort to those
millions, or billions, already dead. And the
survivors, well, where would our civilisation be?
Picture an Aztec in 1450 being given a vision of his
nation\'s future (to, say, 1999). To say to him, "well,
Indians survived," probably wouldn\'t impress him much.

 Bear in mind that the split which occurred during the reformation 
 drove the Catholic and Othodox wings of the Church deeper into 
 sacramental tradition, whereas the reformed Church focused on 
 Scripture over the Sacraments. Both sides lost something...
 
 BTW I thought that Mark\'s Gospel was recorded somewhere around the AD 
 70s/80s, before the others?

Good story, and quite useful to Traveller games.

An interesting idea would be to put this event in a character
background. Let the event take place on a primitive (ie 1970s or
something) planet, and have the character being the one alerted by the
UFOs. Rescuing the pilot of the other UFO, he was recruited by the
visiting scouts, spotting talent and courage when they saw him enter the
spacecraft and rescue one of them.

Perhaps, though I very much doubt if 20,000 odd weapons is enough to wipe
out civilization, or that there are less than 10,000 population
concentrations in the Warsaw Pact larger than 50,000 people

But even if both are true, they didn\'t have the means of delivering that
number of warheads.

> The USSR had  enough warheads for stauration of the same.

And they had even _less_ ability to deliver them.

In 1972 at the conclusion of the SALT I talks the USSR had just 1500 ICBMs
(and they were deploying at the rate of about 200 a year ) At the time the
US had approx 1700 ICBMs and SLBMs

Or are you implying that the US in 1972 had less than 1500 cities containing
more than 50,000 people ?
It\'s possible, I don\'t have enough data on the US populaion distribution to
figure it out myself, but inuitively it sounds unlikley.

This information is misleading, and does not invalidate any of my
statements.

These figures were calculated based on the number of waheads that _might_
have been produced given the amount of weapon\'s grade materiel that had been
produced over the last fifty-odd years , not on the numbers of warheads
actually produced (which is still actually secret, but is likely to be much
less than the number that it was possible to produce)  It\'s also based on
the total production since 1944 or thereabouts, and the majority of warheads
produced prior to 1970 degraded to a useless/dangerous state within a year
or three, and had to be replaced. Therefore your statement should read  :

The total tonnage _ever_produced_  ( including all all those test firings
and ones actually used, and all the ones that were dismantled ) when added
up, produced the figure of 2.5KT per person.

At no time in history were there enough nuclear weapons _in_service_at
_any_one_time_ to produce this figure.

>Since most (75%) of the worlds population lives in
> concentrations where 2.5KT could easily wipe out more than 20 persons...

This presumes one could actually deliver "2.5KT" in such a way. Most
available weapons are in the MT range, and you can\'t split them into little
pieces (ignoring MIRV\'s for the moment, of which there only a few hundred)

In 1990, the US had just over 7300 nuclear warheads and just over 1500
ICBMs. The USSR had less than this (the USSR has always had less thatn the
US). That implies that between them they could hit no more than 14,000 odd
targets, assuming they could somehow deliver all 14,000 to their targets.

Prior to 1990 there were more warheads, but not _that_ many more. I can\'t
find the reference, but I don\'t think the US ever had more than 10,000
warheads at any one time, and since SALT II they never had more than about
1500 ICBMs

FAE was fairly recent, and Chem weapons are not particulalry useful.

I agree that biologicals are far more worrying than nukes, and have a
greater chance to be able to kill large numbers of people.
Problem is that MAD was never a particulalry useful doctrine, and societies
are not species.

However, the whole concept of MAD was one-sided, the USSR _never_ had the
capability to "MAD" the West, and was terrified of the West\'s insistence on
the doctrine, and thus forced to try and compete.

In fact, "MAD" was really a tool to destroy the USSR\'s economy by forcing
them to spend more on their military than they could afford.

But not enough to "kill all life on earth ten times over" which was what I
was disputing

I also dispute that either the US or the USSR ever actually had this
capacity, or that they ever had it combined

I suspect generals on either side may have _claimed_ this capacity for the
opposing side, but many of the figures claimed by US military brass about
Soviet capability in order to boost their budgets, have been proven wrong
since Glasnost.  The USSR even lied about the population of Moscow, they
claimed it was much bigger than it actually was so they could claim a
"US-sized" city in the USSR.

As were defensive nuclear mines in the Fulda Gap and other strategic break
through points in West Germany. The British even deployed Blue Steels to the
Mediteranean and lost at least one overboard.

But the totals I mentioned _do_ count those.

The Cold War was not a dream. But, I repeat, at no time from that period to
now did we have the capability to "kill all life on earth ten times over" ,
and also at no time during that period was it likely that a full scale
nuclear war would eliminate the human race.

Just because a lot of people _fear_ something does not make it so.

There were\\are also a lot of people living in England in 1940 who were\\are
absolutely convinced that Hitler would have won the war and conquered
Britain had he launched Operation Seelowe as planned. This despite the fact
that every military scientist who examines the facts determines otherwise.

Yep.  Each of these ships is supposed to carry one third of a combat
brigade.  They are Assault Riders, three of the carriers attaching to a
mother that has all the jump drives.  (This keeps the jump drioves at a
safe distance from any nasty surprises.)

You need roughly five of these babies (complete set) per division.
Thirty-odd divisions per Field Army + 1 Corps.  *150* ships per AssaultRon.

The problem is that "one-time pads" is that they are *not* suitable for
this sort of application. They work great for point to point
communications, because you only have to make sure that the two points
involved get their "pads" securely.

But for this, EVERY SINGLE BANK BRANCH on *thousands* of worlds has to
have a copy. There\'s *no* way to guarantee security of the key that
way. 

Sure *we* use "one time pads" for diplomatic communications with
embassies. But each embassy has its own "key". So even if you can
intercept and copy the "key" for the embassy in Nairobi, it\'ll be
useless for anything but messages sent *between* Nairobi and
Washington. Only Washington has all the keys, and they\'re *really* well
guarded. 

But since a bank doesn\'t know *what* world a ship will show up at, it
has to be able to read & verify stuff at *all* the worlds it covers. 

BTW, it occurs to me that unless the ship is required to make payments
at a specific world, there\'s going to be *weeks* of lag time between
when they pay up and when the bank finds out about the payment. Makes
it rather hard to tell if a payment is late or not.

Actually, "nuclear winter" is rather likely. But not certain.

The key is *not* the explosive power of the bombs. It\'s determining how
much dust the explosion kicks up (ground and airburst differ *wildly*
on this), and what sort of smoke if produced by the fires started by
bomb flash and direct blast.

These are all *strongly* dependent on season and worse, on targeting of
the missiles. 

Last I heard the range of answers generated by more or less reasonable
simulations ranged from "it\'s gonna get *really* chilly" to "yeah, we
didn\'t have a summmer that year and lost a lot of crops" (which
happened in 1815, due to a volcano!). 

It\'s also fairly certain that if either the US or the USSR had cared to
launch a suicidal first strike, they had more than enough warheads to
wipe out civilization. Especially given that once such a launch was
confirmed, the other side would cheerfully nuke any cities or
installations that the "enemy" had left. This where subs come in. Until
recently, they weren\'t accurate enough to take out missile silos and
the like. But they were more than accurate enough to take out cities,
factories, transport nexuses and the like. 

And the effects on anybody who *didn\'t* get targeted wouldn\'t be
pretty. 

Remember those lovely displays of "escalation" in the missile launch
displays near the end of "Wargames"? I recognized enough of them to
suspect that they were using open literature defense/offense scenarios
as the basis. They didn\'t *have* to exaggerate much.

"Limited" nuclear war is possible. But nobody considers it *likely*.
It\'d require someone in charge with the guts to say "We are going to be
beaten. Badly. But there\'s no point in taking the rest of the world
with us." Leaders like that are too rare to count on.

And if they try that, you can show *your* copy of the contract, along
with your receipts for payments made. And since such contracts get a
copy deposited with a "neutral" third party, unless the bank was able
to suborn *them*, they\'d be the ones with a contract that doesn\'t match
the "official" copy.

And the crew will at some point acquire a new NPC, who, unkown to the
PCs (at least at first) will be an IMOJ agent. After all, the IMOJ
wants the escapees, and if they are the sort to attempt revenge on the
PCs then detaching an agent to watch for attempts (so they can be
traced back and the "fugitives from justice" captured) is a good
investment. 

Of course, depending on the PCs involved this could be a boon or a
major handicap. Especially during the initial phase before they figure
out that Jo Shigulli is actually James Alkaloi, IMOJ!

There was. This was a POW "camp". A *Naval* POW camp (Space Navy, not
Wet Navy). Let *that* sort of person start refining metals and the like
and next thing you know, they\'ll be shoooting down the picket ships!

Just look at the sort of thing WWII POWs managed. Sure, they won\'t be
able to "extort" (or steal!) things from the guards. On the other hand,
they won\'t have to *hide* what they are working on. At least not any
small pieces.

That depends. There *are* a lot of criminals with pretty high levels in

I once came across a story that had the prisoners more or less
"running" a prison on a rockball. They\'d been given adequate
technology, just *way* out of date. Enough so that the visting ships
weren\'t *really* worried when they dropped off prisoners. Among other
things, they didn\'t have the tech for stardrives and would take a
*long* time to build spaceships.[1]

It was a society that seemed to have a "one-strike" policy. The *stupid*
bullies tended to die rather quickly. They didn\'t pay attention when
told how to wear a suit properly. The cons running the place just
hauled the suit in (no point wasting air) and the body got dumped into
the "compost heap". 

The *smart* hardcases ran the place and protected any "white collar"
criminals that had useful skills. So you had an odd sort of fuedal
society. I think it could have worked, though at some point, it would
have enough of a knowledge and industrial base that they could tell the
"jailers" to quit dumping people on them, and become an "independent"
world.

No, just your typical sneaky Naval officers and ratings doing their
duty to escape a POW camp.

[1] Just as an example, if we find enough water and a few critical
minerals on the moon, you could set up a "Victorian" tech level colony,
and they\'d be able to get by and even expand to the limit of their
resources. But it\'d take a long time before they had anything more
dangerous than some guns. Nothing to worry "21st century" tech if you
take a few simple precautions and make it clear what will happen if
they do anything stupid.

The problem is that most of the simulations, even the "worse" ones,  result
in _less_ material being injected into the stratosphere than was injected by
the Taupo explosion, and it is documented that while this was noticeable on
the other side of the planet for several months, it did not have a huge
effect on life in the southern hemisphere, and did not last for more than a
few months.

Exactly, though the 1815 explosion was a small one compared to Taupo.

Again, I disagree. I estimate there was no more than 20,000 warheads
available total at any time during the last thirty years, and no more than
5,000 ICBMs and SLBMs. This is not enough to wipe out civilization. Put a
serious dent in it, yes, but not wipe it out.

<snip>
> "Limited" nuclear war is possible. But nobody considers it *likely*.

Talk to any military scientist and most of them thinkit it _is_ likely that
at least one limited nuclear war will be fought at some time in the near
future. The US is unlikely to be involved, except in a "diplomatic"
capacity.

In most likely scenarios there is no way the particpants _can_ take the rest
of the world with them, so that decision, and the person to make it, is
irrelevant.

An example is a limited nuclear exchange between Pakistan and India, or even
India and China, though that would be more damaging . Both _have_ to be
limited exchanges because the combatants do not have enough warheads for it
to be anything else.

Well, they got a lot of the good ones as the "mystery characters" in
Citizens of the Imperium, and the other similar group I seem to recall
them doing a while later. 

But there\'s been a lot of SF written since then. I\'ll nominate a few
deserving "recent SF" characters, and let you guys do the stats. :-)

Harrington, Honor. Admiral, Royal Manticoran Navy, Admiral, Grayson Navy.
	Not only is she an interesting character, but we\'d "need" to at
	least place the Manticore system and Grayson somewhere on the
	fringes of the Imperium. And add Sphinxian Treecats to the list
	of races. :-)

Naismith, Cordelia. Captain, Betan Survey Service (retired)
Vorkosigan, Aral. Ex-Regent, Barrayar. Viceroy of Sergar(sp?)
Vorkosigan, Miles. Imperial Auditor. (see appendix for other honors)
Vorkosigan, Mark. "Businessman"
Taura (no last name). Sergeant, Dendarii Free Mercenaries.

(I couldn\'t resist throwing in Taura)

Oh yeah, throw in the Quaddies from "Falling Free", and Athos from
"Ethan of Athos" (Athos has to be *at least* an Amber zone). Heck,
throw in Ethan as an NPC. I want to watch the first time he asks a
female PC if she\'d be willing to donate an ovary. :-)

Several things:
	Terrorist Attacks: High yield, small package, easy to smuggle that way.
	Infrastructure destruction
	EMP: Under traveller rules, most tech is subject to EMP even at TL 15
	Sensor Blinding: H-Bombs are VERY effective at short term blinding of
		sensors; Orbital Flashing should cover even a massive jump-in
	Fragmentation of Asteroidal bodies; You can laser a tube, pack with
		bombs, and scatter the pieces.
	Subsurface detonations can cause wonderful seizmic effects.

Nukes are one of the best energy for mass demolition tools. In an
atmosphere, the conversion is particularly effective. And the cost, if the
production facilities don\'t have to be kept under as tight a set of
restrictions as current Terran ones tend to be, aren\'t particularly
expensive.

To my knowledge, the US Army has only fielded one type of 8" gun since the
\'Nam, an 8" howitzer, in two versions: Towed and SP-Tracked. The Roomie in
question was dual MOS\'d: 8" Special Munitions/Artillery, and Property Issue
Clerk. (The latter due to a medical condition which removed him from the
combat arms during sencond term... after he re-upped. It eventually
resulted in a medical discharge.) All his books mentioned howitzers.

To my knowledge, Field Ordinance comes in 3 flavors of Slug-Thrower:
Guns: Primarily Direct-fire, breach loaded.
Howitzers: Indirect Fire, BreachLoaded, low-high angle capable; most
capable of limited Direct Fire.
Mortars: Indirect Fire, Mid-high angle. No Direct fire capability,
typically Muzzel Loaded, and round impact initiated.

Non-Slug throwers, IIRC, are classed into:
Guided DF missiles
Guided IF missiles
MRL\'s (limited guidance or unguided, AFAIK)


Special Munitions includes CBR of all types, plus ADM and CBM rounds, as
well as FAE rounds, again IIRC and AFAIK. (CBR Chem/Bio/Rad; ADM: Artillery
Dropped Mines; CBM: Cluster Bomblet Munitions) From what I gathered, the 8"
arty has been pulled, since 5" pieces can be airlifted on smaller aircraft.

Ob Trav: I havent seen much on any of these options outside striker/Striker
II. MT had some nuke stats.

Unless you\'re Russian, then they include semi-auto, magazine feed

Cool.  The original point was total destruction of "...all life on earth
...".  Societies ?  Sure.  All life ?  Not a hope in Hades.  Nature has
tried several times and failed.  Nothing we\'ve done up until now can
duplicate the power of nature.  Nothing, zip, zilch, diddly-squat.  The
power of St Helens was, what, about 4MT ?  And that affected such a small
area of the surface of the Earth as to laughable.  In 1000 years time,
there won\'t even *be* any evidence for the eruption.

My point is, we have seen displays in the past from good-old Mother Nature
that make all our purported power look like a joke.  Several species
die-backs have occured throughout time.  The most notable being at the K-T
boundary.  Assuming the much-beloved "comet theory", you\'re talking energy
far in excess of what we can develop or deploy.  Ergo, I think the argument
that we can "destroy all life on Earth" is flawed.

ObTrav : At what point does the TL of the society drop as a result of
population loss ?  Presumably some systems develop (biological) viruses and
greeblies that kills lots of introduced species, including sophonts.  Ditto
wars.  How much of your populace do you have to lose before their way of
life becomes irretrievably disrupted and they drop in TL ?

Hmm, nice try, but wrong.  True, yer average volcanic eruption doesn\'t get
up to the temperatures found in nuclear detonation (which, BTW, only get to
a couple of thousand degrees Kelvin).  It does, however, emit large doses
of radiation, depending on eruption type.  Even better, it vents all sorts
of lovely gasses which if manufactured by man would be outlawed.  Rarely do
volcanoes in the middle of a city go off because humans are not so totally
moronic so as to build on the flanks of too many active hilltops.  When
they have, they\'ve discovered their mistake and not lived to tell of it.
Eruptions ala \'Volcano\' are historically rare.  However, can you say
Pompeii ?  It doesn\'t have to spew forth lava to be deadly.

As for spitting up ash, wrong again.  We find a fair few ash layers in
sedimentary rocks that must have been many, many metres thick when they
were laid.  Often, we find the same evidence from the same eruption
hundreds of kilometers from the eruption point itself.  One eruption in
recent history altered the climate across the globe.  Krakatua.  One single
eruption.  Heard as far away as Sydney in Australia where the Governor
thought Russian warships were bombarding his coastal defences.  Show me a
nuke that can do that !

ObTrav : Imagine a system where the populace of the mainworld is sitting on
the flanks of a volcano they think is extinct.  Say, Olympus Mons on Mars.
Big bugger.  What are they gonna do when it appears that it isn\'t extinct ?
 How do up and move millions of people, even in a high TL Third Imperium ?
Imagine the PC\'s fighting people off because they\'re the last ship out

Response:

I\'m not really all that familiar with cryptography but would the following
work:

Each "branch office" would receive at scheduled periods a unique code which
consists of two tables of simple equations whose results are non-repeating
decimals i.e., like Pi?.   Each table would be sent by separate secure
messenger.  Three digit blocks in the first decimal (from the first table)
starting at a value determined by the first eight digits of a second decimal
(from the second table) represent letters, numbers and other symbols deemed
necessary.  Each line of the message resets in the sequence in the first
decimal the value of the next eight digits in the second decimal and thus
resets for the required symbols. Repeat the procedure for each following
line.   Each day/selected time period or even, for the truly paranoid, new
message a new pair of decimals are used.

Even if individual messages or even the code tables for a single branch for
a specific time period are compromised,  the larger system is still secure.

The home office would originate and have all the keys.  It thus would be the
major security risk.

Just an idea for a relatively low tech rather unsophisticated message system
which doubtlessly has sufficient flaws for ingenious PCs to exploit.

Don\'t forget Mount Ranier and Mount Shasta as they were the expected
candidates before St. Helens blew.  By the way you want to see what calderas
looks like in the lower 48 check out the pair in the Jemez Mountains of
Northern New Mexico.  The larger of the two lies partially over the first
and if memory serves correctly has a measured crater over 7 klicks across.
I have a geologic map of the area in a box some where.  There are pumice
beds over 50 feet thick some miles distant from the rim.  When it blew...
well lets just say that the future St. Helens eruption of recent memory was
a popcorn fart by comparison.  There is also a rather large caldera in the
Med whose last explosion is said to be tied to the Atlantis myths.

Also, you can create *shaped charge* nukes. So far, this is more of a
theoretical possibility than a practical one. But much the same
techniques are used in "radiation management" in multi-stage weapons
(fission triggered fusion bombs, and fission-fusion-fission "enhanced
yield" bombs). 

Personally, I can only see two uses for this. *Massive* engineering
projects and "bunker busters" for deep meson sites. And for the later,
you\'d probably have to use multiple blasts. Which means some poor Corps
of Engineers slobs get to climb into a *fresh* blast crater to emplace
the second (third, fourth, etc) charges. Nuke damper would help by
suppressing the nuclear radiation, but those craters are gonna be
rather warm *thermally*. 

Oh, wait, there\'s a third use. A sort of Orion-style propulsion for
moving asteroids. But they may be too expensive for that.

That reminds me of something we\'ve been discussing in another thread.
Ortillery, specifically a Thor style orbital system.

A friend had been playing Morrow Project, and was getting ready to GM
it. He wanted something leftover that\'d keep the players on their toes.
I would up helping him draw up the "parameters" for a still functional
(or at least *partially* functional) Thor system. And luckily this was
about the time Scientific American did an article that included a color
photo of several ICBM warheads coming down at Kwajalein Atoll. I showed
him that and explained that the Thor projectiles should look pretty
much the same (bright white *straight* lines from the sky to the
target) and between their speed and persistence of vision effects, we
both figured that to the PCs it\'d look like some sort of monster beam
weapon.

Right here in Portland, we\'ve got an "extinct" volcano (Mount Tabor)
pretty much in the middle of town. It\'s pretty well overgrown (grass,
trees) and they blockedup the caves (some lava tube segments?) *years*
ago. 

But if it ever *did* get active again, we\'d be in a *world* of trouble.
Most of Portland\'s water supply comes from a "reserve" on the slopes of
Mt. Hood (another "extinct" volcano, only it still has hot springs, and
the lava dome is warm enough to melt snow in places! Climbers often
pause for a rest there because its warm...). 

The pipes come up at Mt. Tabor and fill several *big* reserviors at
various levels on the slopes. And from there, it\'s distributed to the
rest of the city.

So if Mt. Tabor became active, there goes our water supply. And no,
*don\'t* suggest drinking the Willamette or Columbia Rivers. We aren\'t
set up for the required purification. 

If Mt *Hood* goes active, the only good thing is that the prevailing
winds blow *east* away from town. But we\'d still lose our water supply.

And please keep in mind that there are different *kinds* of volcanos.
Ones like Vesuvius (the one that got Pompei and Herculaneum) and Mt.
St. Helens don\'t do lava except in the actual crater. The lava isn\'t
fluid enough to flow very far. Instead you get ash clouds burying the
surrounding areas in meters of ash, and the nearby spots have to worry
about pyroclastic flows. 

Other volcanos are like the ones in Hawaii or Iceland. the lava is very
fluid, and you get large flows.

Frankly, I\'ll take either over the *third* "type". That\'s where you get
massive cracks in the crust and *thick* flows of lava covering
*thousands* of square miles. That\'s what formed much of Central and
Eastern Washington/Oregon and a fair chunk of Idaho. 

Just to give you an idea of the *scale* involved, some of the basalt
layers are *hundreds* of feet thick. And the total thickness of the
various layers is *thousands* of feet. 

Have a geologist discover that a populated region of a planet is going
to undergo *that* and watch the fun. Massive quakes, and then the
ground starts cracking into wide fissures, *miles* long, out of which
lava flows as fast (if not faster) than any lava flow you\'ve seen films
of from Iceland or Hawaii. 

Well, there goes the neighborhood. 

And *here* is an adventure seed. These sorts of magma flows create
massive mineral deposits (stuff like the Idaho copper and silver mines
or the Comstock Lode in Colorado(?)). They also tend to be ongoing for
hundreds or more likely *thosands* of years.

So picture someone getting the idea of building mining "platforms" that
can float on the lava, and use CG to cross the solid stuff. Equipped to
sample the fresh lava and *pump* (scoop?) it aboard for processing when
you find flows rich in valuable minerals. 

Some may even "drill" into the flows to find the internal "pools" or
the magma chambers where the *really* good stuff forms. 

Just imagine the possibilities. Imagine the profits. Imagine the things
that can go wrong. With or without "help". 

For an even *more* extreme version of this, you need a *young* planet.
Well under a billion years. Just after (most) of the "bombardment by
planetesmals is over. One where the surface is blocks of lighter
crustal material floating on top of molten magma. The blocks haven\'t
really consolidated, and new ones form as bubbles of lighter material
work their way up from the deeper areas. 

You\'ve at least got solid (if rather hot!) "bases" to work from. On the
downside, there\'s *no* oxygen, and the air is going to be the most
godawful mix of stuff, including lots of sulfur oxides and the like. 

This is a *prime* location because first, the planet is still
seperating into crust, magma, and core. The mix of elements is more
uniform, though there will still be large chunks of stuff that *had*
differentiated before impact. But more importantly, because it\'s so
young, the planet still has most of its initial supply of
radioisotopes. Definitely worth the trouble to seperate out of the
molten rock, even if they *are* more uniformly distributed.

Even better would be trying to harvest radio-isotopes from the
planetary nebula of a system wuile it was forming. But that\'s *really*
dangerous (such nebulas would resemble a cross between a *Star Trek*
"nebula" and a *Star Wars* "asteroid field". Ouch! And besides, you\'d
have to melt the rock yourself. :-)

ps. I gotta say it before somebody else does. Do you suppose that these
guys "mining" lava/magma would be called "soft rock miners"? :-)

I live within sight of Mount St. Helens. We\'ve *seen* those meter thick
ash layers. Even hundred of miles away. But the trick is that the ash
has to get into the *stratosphere* to affect climate. That 1815
explosion caused *more* of that effect, even though it was smaller than
St. Helens (and Kratatoa, and that Taopura(sp?) blast someone was
talking about). That\'s because it  went more *up* than out. And it may
have produced finer ash, which stays up longer.

Nukes, because of the fireball, are *much* better at getting
particulates, especially *fine* particulates, into the upper
atmosphere. Sure, each one puts up less *indivually*. But they raise it
higher, and because there are a *lot* of them, widely spread, they
distribute it more evenly. 

Then there\'s the smoke from the firestorms. Anyplace where you get a
firestorm, the severe updraft in the center that drives the firestorm
will also carry smoke particles (quite close to "ideal" size for
staying up a *long* time) into the stratosphere. 

One of the big arguments regarding attempts to calculate the effecs of
a large, widespread attack is just how big the firestorms would be, how
many there\'d be, and how long they\'d last before spreading to far to
sustain the winds that drive them. 

The USSR would have had a lot of them, because they liked to hide silos
in *thick* forests. Cities with lots of older buildings are another
prime candidate. 

BTW, I forget who it was who kept harping on "there weren\'t enough
missiles to carry all those warheads". Well, I spent a lot of years
living next to a SAC airbase. Those B52 crews would have done their
damnedest to get their "warheads" (bombs, and later stand-off
shortrange missiles) thru. And I think a lot would have succeeded.
Ditto for their Soviet counterparts. 

And I have to wonder about the bombers that\'d get shot down. We know
that our bombs can survive explosions and crashes IF THEY AREN\'T ARMED
at the time. What happens if they *are* armed. For that matter, is
there a way the crew could detonate them in the time between "We\'re
going down!" and impact?

Check out a bunch of John Brunner\'s early SF. He had "involuntary"
colonies scattered all over the place. They were all ZFPs (Zarathustra
Refugee Planets". The only title I can remember off the top of my head
is "The Pirates of Zan".

Basic concept was that centuries back, it\'d been discovered that
Zarathustra\'s sun was going to nova. Soon. A massive evacuation attempt
took place, and towards the end, as the day side started to cook, the
last few hundred ships were launching from night side and trying to
stay in the planet\'s shadow as long as possible while trying to get up
to speed for hyperdrive (In traveller terms, make it to the 100
diameter limit).

This meant that due to the planet\'s position, they were headed out into
unexplored space (in Traveller, make it that the radiation from the
nova not only *caused* the misjumps, but biased them in that direction)

They were badly overloaded. So badly that there were almost immediate
life support problems. So when they came out of hyper (exited jump)
they *had* to head for any planets that were nearby, just to replenish
the air supply. 

Some ships forcibly unloaded the passengers, promising to bring help
and were then lost when their engines or crew weren\'t up to making the
return trip to civilized space. 

Other ships were in too bad a condition (or had lost too many of the
operations personnel due to life support and fighting with the
passengers. When they landed (or often "crashed" in a manner that let
enough people survive) they were *stuck*. 

Thus as folks expanded into this area they were always finding colonies
in the damnedest places. Planets that were "livable" but only just. And
sometimes, the folks that discovered them would keep it a secret. In
one book, someone had found a ZFP that was still a fair ways beyond the
"border" (misjump!) and when he got back, the megacorp he worked for
kept it a secret. they infiltrated the local theocracy, and
"redirected" the way sacrifices were done. In short, they used the
planet as a "spare parts" depot. 

Anyway, you\'d get some of the same effects (overloaded sgips,
passengers and crew fighting over life support, critical systems
getting damaged). Alas, you wouldn\'t be likely to get the massive
number of mis-jumped ships. :-(

 In a thousand years, most of the surface evidence will have eroded/rotted 
away unless another eruption comes along and puts a new surface on the area 
(which would cover over and preserve the fallen trees, for example). The new 
shape of the mountain, however, will remain until another eruption changes it

many decades/centuries/millenia it is allowed to by the magma mass beneath 
St. Helens...

There are no "simple" equations for irrationals like that. Or, rather,
there are "simple" equations, and there are equations that will easily
let you produce the XXth digit of the number.

The simple equations can take *hours* to give you "merely" the 10th
digit of the number. 

But that really doesn\'t matter.

> Each table would be sent by separate secure messenger.

The problem that you are missing is that every branch you add to the
network adds another set of code keys OF WHATEVER FORM to be
distributed. And since they all have to be the *same* that means that
intercepting *one* gives away everything. The simple fact that there
are more *copies* makes getting hold of one (either by sneaking a peek
at one "in transit", or by bribing a clerk at a branch).

Dividing the keys into parts, only helps a little with the interception
problem. It doesn\'t help *at all* with the "insider leak" problem. 

> Even if individual messages or even the code tables for a single branch for

You missed the fact that *all* the branches have to have the *same*
keys, because they have to be able to verify or issue the stuff that
the ship has or needs. Remember, there\'s *no* way to determine *in
advance* which branch a ship will be at several months from now. So
they *all* have to be able to deal with it.

Except that as I pointed out above, to be of any use for dealing with a
ship whose future location can\'t be predicted, *all* the branches have
to have the keys.

It\'s too insecure for anybody to try it unless they don\'t bother
talking to anybody familiar with security and cryptography first. And
in that case, they\'ll *quickly* get taken for all they\'ve got.

In essence, the problem biols down to needing some "token" that the PCs
can carry that can be verified (to prove that contract terms are
correct and thus that *neither* party has cheated) and that can be
modified/updated (to note when, where, and how big the payments were).

This requires a "key". And whatever it is, *any* branch that the PCs
wind up at has to have it, or they can\'t verify the contract terms, nor
record the new payment on the "token". 

And frankly, the customers are going to be a lot happier if *two* keys
are required. One for them, and one for the bank. That way there has to
be *mutual* agreement before any new info goes into the "token". 

*Reading* the token shouldn\'t require a key, or else should require a
publicly known key that isn\'t easily usable to determine the pair of
write keys.

This sort of thing is *ideal* for the various "public key" ciphers. The
problem is that as computers get better you have to make the keys
longer. Luckily, adding one *bit* to a key generally makes it *at
least* twice as hard to crack. So if you add 8 bits, that\'s 256 times
the effort. Etc.

There is one *bad* problem that could crop up. Adding bits makes things
so much harder because the keys are based on certain mathematical
operations being *much* harder to reverse than to do.

semi-silly example: it\'s easy to determine that 5+4 = 9, but the only
way to determine that the 9 was produced by adding 5 and 4 and not 1
and 8, would be to try both as "keys". (say it was a 2 digit combo, and
you knew that it had to add up to 9) You\'d have to try 0 & 9, 1 & 8, 2
& 7, 3 & 6, and 4 & 5.

Now imagine it with 10 digit numbers. Bad huh? Even so, it wouldn\'t
take a computer long to search, simply because given a total of 65, and
a key of 23, it\'s obvious that the other value has to be 32.

But what most of the public key systems use involves multiplying pairs
of prime numbers instead of merely adding "normal" numbers. So while it
is possible to determine the *product* of my public and private
keys, to determine my private key you have to be able to *factor* that
product. 

So for a *trivial* example, try figuring out which two primes were
multiplied together to produce 1147. Then consider trying to do it with
a number in the billions.

The problem is that there\'s no *guarantee* that there isn\'t some *easy*
way to determine the factors of a number. Nobody has found one, but
mathematicians haven\'t proved that it\'s impossible either.

An early public key system depended on a math problem (the knapsack
algotithm) that someone found a fast solution to. And that rendered
that *method* of encryption invalid. Instead of adding 8 bits making
the things hundred of times harder it only made (say) 8 times harder.
Which meant it was just as hard to generate a longer key as it was to
crack one. Which was no good.

However, even if factoring becomes easy, there are other principles
that public key ciphers can be based on. So as long as there are
ciphers based on different *types* of "hard problems" we are ok. 

In reality, quantum computing could make *all* the hard problems easy.
Luckily, it makes enough *other* things easy that we don\'t have to
worry about it in Traveller. Because it\'d rip the Traveller universe to
shreds.

Thus I\'m confident that a Traveller type universe would have workable
public key encryption. Though they may have to use fairly long keys,
and the Imperium\'s history should include at least one time when they
had to scrap a widely used system and switch to another. 

This would either have led to major hassles during the changeover, or
if people had been smart, it\'d be a damned nuisance. You get the
"damned nuisance" level by *not* using the same algorithm for
everything.

Say you have three different cipher types. One, like PGP depends on
Factoring being hard. Another depends on X and another on Y. So if you
are smart, you use all three. So if one becomes worthless, you\'ve got
the other two to use. 

In the case of ship\'s mortages and payment records, when the bank finds
out that cipher A is no good, they\'ll switch anybody who was using it
to Cipher B. And paranoid types will have insisted in doing things in
triplicate anyway, one in each cipher.

Sound a bit umbersome? Maybe. But if they had a cipher become worthless
and *werent* doing things that way, they\'d lose *everything*, Heck,
that could be a the reason for a major depession or two. But once you
learn that lesson you aren\'t going to forget!

 You aren\'t going to get the really precious minerals this way, since they 
don\'t form until cooling. With the right hardware this _might_ be a decent 
way to extract the common elements, pulling iron, aluminum, silicon, 
magnesium and similar out of the liquid state instead of needing a furnace. 
You just aren\'t going to find gold, silver or copper in this state unless 
you\'ve developed a way to process the entire flow as it goes by down to a 
part-per-trillion molecular level. Those elements tend to stay deep (being 
heavier) and come up through the cracks under high pressure MUCH later.  And 
a carbon-rich magma chamber is still a millenium or so from being a diamond 
mine...

Since we\'ve found the crater, the big question is was it a commet or an
asteroid.

But you forget that "Nature" has used brute force, and concentrated at
one point, at that. 

We can, regrettably, do better. We can exert our force in just the
right places to maximize the damage.

Even so, it *would* take quite a bit to wipe out the critters around
the deep ocean vents. And forget wiping out the deep rock bacteria.
Short of remelting the entire crust I don\'t think they *can* be wiped
out. 

But wiping out all the animals and most of the plants is much easier.
Even easier if you ignore the really small stuff.

Thera.

But getting back to the US, there\'s a place in California (Long
Valley?) that was dicovered to be a *big* caldera a few years back.
It\'s got a lot of people living in it, and it is *definitely* only
"dormant". USGS has sensors all over the place.

        Hi, Leonard!
        Yellowstone or Yosemite (the one with the "Old Faithful" gyser in
it) is sitting on top of what you call a "third type" of volcano.  I goes
every hunfred thosand years or so, based on geologic record.   We\'re about
due, apparently, and the orbital sattilites have detected a 1m upwards
change in that areas altitude.  Based on the geologic record, we\'re talking
about an eruptive area the size of Rhode Island and flow distantces ten
times that.
        This was all in a Time or Popular Science magazine that came out
shortly after the "Coast is Toast" movie.

Check out the Enigma machine.  New wheels can be distributed on a
regular basis.

When deciding upon what type of code to use there are several factors to
consider.
1. How long do you want to delay the decoding? (Only single use code
books do not apply here)
2. How much information do you want to transmit?
3. How much effort can the remote person afford to take?  (Check out
PALVERSTON code used in
   the American cival war for an easy to use example.)

Try using a newspaper for the single use key with a simple substitution
code that is then run
through a transposition pattern.  This will provide some error recovery
for the receiver while
providing for ease of use and good security.  A search of the remote
site is less likely to
reveal what is being used as a key.  The reomte also runs less risk of
being compromised by
continually coming into contact with someone to get a new book.

	[Steve Lieb]  Sorry, I had to de-lurk for a moment to engage this
"debunking".

	Not sure how such a statement could be made, but here\'s the numbers.
	At the height of the cold war, there were approximately 50,000
warheads in various stockpiles, averaging (WAG) probably less than 10
megatons.

	Now the damned statistics.  50,000 warheads x 10 megatons means, if
they were scattered perfectly in perfect conditions, they would effectively
destroy 25 mi^2 x 50,000 or 1.25 mio square miles.  Would this wipe out a
country the size of France?  I don\'t know the size of France, but California
is only about 150,000 sq miles.  
	Now, is this likely (perfect distribution, perfect condition)?  No,
in fact, impossible.
	But I\'m pretty certain that if even a decent fraction of these
warheads landed, France would be functionally obliterated.

	Of course, it depends also on how you define "wipe out"?  If you
mean "disintegrate to atoms" - you\'re right.  But a single 50mt
lithium-cobalt doped warhead could, over the span of a half-dozen years,
wipe out human and animal (and a sizeable fraction of vegetable) life on
this planet.  Leo Szilard pointed that out in what - 1957?  Basic physics
hasn\'t changed since then, and our understanding of the catastrophic
consequences of even small amounts of radiation in the natural environments
has only gotten better.

Asteroids are denser and contain a higher percentage of metal. Comets
are mostly water and frozen gasses.

warhead yield was initially high only because RV CEP was so high.  As the
cold war progressed, american yields dropped to fractions of a megaton
because CEP had also dropped.

This doesn\'t change the number of warheads of course.

        Hi, Jeff!
        Right, which means that a \'roid is more liable to "punch through" a
thin part of the crust and not kick up as much particulate matter as a comet
which will vaporize its own mass plus what it lands on...  much more
particulate and therefore more severe climatoligical effects.  Again, I
think.  =)

        PS:  Stupid Canadian Trivia Fact -  The magificent nickel mines of

is a few hundred thousand or million years ago.  They\'ve been mining the
results for almost a century, I believe.
        <TIC>  Careful attention to detail has led the local mining industry

Ho Michel!
I think it would depend on where the object would hit. If it hit in an
ocean I don\'t think it would make much difference. Many megatons of
water would be instantly vaporized. "Hammer of God" anyone?

That reminds me of "The Mists of Avalon." IIRC Excaliber was forged
from the metal of a meteorite. An interesting twist on the sword in
the stone.

Of course, many asteroids whose density has been measured (Eugenia
and Mathilde, for example) have densities around 1 g/cm^3, which is probably
close to a comet.

One big impact difference is velocities; comets are likely to have higher
velocities than asteroids.

Ah yes, of course, should have thought of that one.

Hmm, this is a posibility if you\'re not worried about the side-effects, the
target is not hardened, and don\'t care if you take out everythng around the
target as well. In recent wars it has been shown that precision-guided
conventional munitions are much better for this purpose.

> EMP: Under traveller rules, most tech is subject to EMP even at TL 15

I suspect that\'s one of those silly archaisms, as most military tech _now_
can be proofed against EMP, assuming they want to pay for it, and how is EMP
going to effect laser or maser comms anyway? (unless the burst is in direct
line of sight for lasers)

Of course, if no-one uses nukes, maybe they didn\'t bother, but I suspect
spaceships are going to be EMP-proof by nature, given all the radiation they
have to put up with normally.

This could be considered a draw-back of nuclear weapons, as it does the same
thing to your sensors, though yes, if you need to blind everybody\'s sensors
for a short time for some reason, they are good.
But again they\'ll only affect electro-magnetic sensors, mass detectors would
be unaffected, for example.

True, for demolituion work where the side-effects don\'t matter, they are
good.

Which is why I asked the question :-) It is really hard to distingues between 
asteroids and comets after the discovery of the centaurs and the Kuiper Belt.
Are centaurs and KBO (Kuiper Belt Objects) asteroids. The Centaur (2060) Chiron
even has periods were its more of a comet with tail and coma, while other
times it acts like a regular asteroid. A widely accepted theory is that 
short period comets come from the Kuiper Belt. 

>One big impact difference is velocities; comets are likely to have higher
>velocities than asteroids.

I guess that would depend on the comet/asteroids trajectory. A comet
coming up behind the Earth in its orbit might have lower relative
velocity than an asteroide hitting head on ?

ObTrav: Other than the obvious, a rescue mission to an asteroide 
        were that asteroide is starting to develope a tail and 
        coma. A ship investigating the asteroide has chrashed when
        hit by a jet eminatting from the asteroide and their 
        communications are breaking up due to the interferrance
        of the tail and coma.

The problem is that EMP proofing is very expensive compared to building a
bigger nuke. What it boils down to is that you can harden your material all
you want, and all I have to do is build a little bit bigger nuke, then all
your hard work is for naught.

Not to mention that Mexico City\'s surrounded by the things. And New

and on a number of extinct volcanos (and Mount St. Helens was extinct, 
remember?) And how about assorted islands? Pelee anyone?

They would also be a more efficient \'power plant\' for detonation

add more Lithium Deutride).

eruption, here\'s a reference:

http://www.gns.cri.nz/earthact/volcanoes/whitei.html#BACKGROUND ON THE TAUPO
VOLCANO

As you can see, the 181 AD eruption is estimated to have put around one
hundred cubic _kilometres_ of material into the atmosphere, and according to
other sources I\'ve read, several of those cubic kilometres were blown into
the stratosphere.

This is far more material than even a large number of nuclear explosions
could throw up. And it is the material in the stratosphere that will cause
any "nuclear winter" as the ash from firestorms and lower level injections
will fall to earth relatively quickly except in very unusual circumctances.

Think about this paragraph (taken from the above web site) for a bit :

"At the climax of this eruption, about 30km3 of pumice, ash and rock
fragments was erupted in only a few minutes and travelled horizontally as a
liquid flow, moving at speeds estimated at between 600-900kmh. It crossed
every obstacle in its path except the top of Mt Ruapehu."

(Mt. Ruapehu is another volcano nearby that got famous a year or so ago when
it\'s last eruption was put on the web, it\'s the second tallest mountain in
the North Island. )

Anther item I can\'t find a web reference to is the pyroclastic cloud (of
super-heated steam) from the 181AD explosion (that went out in front of the
above pumice/ash flow.) . There is evidence that this reached  reached the
Bombay hills some hundred miles or more from Taupo, killing (by scalding)
everything in that radius.

So you didn\'t have to worry about being boiled by the ash flow, you were
dead of the steam before you even heard the explosion.

What size nuke do you need to kill within minutes every exposed living thing
in a radius of one hundred miles ?

OB TRAV:
Just describe these events to your players as they lift-off, get them scared
as their ship barely outpaces the superheated steam and pumice flow.

And then, after they complain that this cannot be possible or natural, give
them the above reference.

Anyone interested in buying a fishing lodge on Lake Taupo ?

Comet = Mostly ice and frozen gas. Some have used the fanciful term
"dirty snowball".

Asteroid = Very Large Rock.

The largest asteroids are several hundred miles across; if I recall

I would think it would be very easy for a bank to determine which branch
a ship will be making its\' payment at.  When the loan is first applied
for the bank would want an exact business plan & itinerary on how the
ship will be used to make a profit.  They would determine that the ship
would have to stop off at a specific branch to make payments every so
many months.  If the ship didn\'t show, it would automatically be
reported to the authorities and a repo list.  A bank wouldn\'t approve a
loan on a wide, far reaching, or risky route.
That way the key system of encryption would be very useful without
giving all branches all of the keys.

That is the way it works IMTU anyway.

If you EMP-proof something, the size of the nuke doesn\'t matter.

For instance, one means of avoiding EMP effects is to not use wires to link
devices, switch to fibre-optics for data transmission and fluids for power
transmission. Can you explain how a bigger nuke is going to affect that ?

EMP-proofing processors is not done just by sheilding them, but by ensuring
they are built with small enough tracks that the pulse can\'t generate high
enough voltages to destroy anything, and by error correction mechanisms to
deal with any spurious data caused by the spike. .

If you\'re just talking about EM-sheilding, then yes maybe a bigger nuke will
generate a larger spike that might get through, but that\'s not true
EMP-proofing, that\'s just waht you do to try and protect existing old
equipment, an EMP-proof system needs to be designed from scratch. .

Well, based on my knowledge of the fiigures, and the references I\'ve been
able to come up with, 50,000 warheads is way too high.

My current estimate is that there was unlikley to have been more than 20,000
warheads at any one time, and it\'s more likley to have been much less. It is
quite possible they may have _produced_ 50, 000 warheads by then, but as
previously mentioned, early warheads were unstable and had to be regularly
scrapped.

( BTW, what do you consider the "height of the cold war" ? There were
definitely more warheads around in the late 70\'s than in the 60\'s, and I\'ve
always considered the Cold War was effectively over by the 70\'s )

I\'ll admit my choice of France was random with no real thought to the actual
figures, it was a bad guess
However you\'re right, even with my warhead numbers, France ( 211,000 squae
miles ) could be destroyed twice over.

But not the whole planet.

Even your 1.25M square miles represents only about 1% of the earth\'s
surface.

So I have to admit I was wrong about it being only a country the size of
France, maybe you could take out India (1.26 M sqm). But the basic point of
my statement is proved, at no time did we have the capability to "destroy
all life on earth ten times over", and we also have never had the capability
to destroy all life on earth even once over.

Exacltly.

1950 I think.

1957 was when the Windscale accident in England proved the "Szilard
complication"

However, talking about what might be possible is a completely different
thing from actual capabilities.

Only one cobalt-salted bomb was ever produced, and was exploded  by the
British at Maralinga, Australia. It was considered a failure, and the
cobalt-60 "doomsday"  device, while theoretically possible may still not be
prove to be workable.

This is far more material than even a large number of nuclear explosions
could throw up. And it is the material in the stratosphere that will cause
any "nuclear winter" as the ash from firestorms and lower level injections
will fall to earth relatively quickly except in very unusual circumctances.

Thanks.  That about sums up what I was getting at.

<Frankie>
Anther item I can\'t find a web reference to is the pyroclastic cloud (of
super-heated steam) from the 181AD explosion (that went out in front of the
above pumice/ash flow.) . There is evidence that this reached  reached the
Bombay hills some hundred miles or more from Taupo, killing (by scalding)
everything in that radius.
</Frankie>

There is evidence of this flow (or p\'raps anothery from same hill, I forget) reaching as far as the Eastern Australian coast.  That\'s what, 500km or so ?  Considering they travel at something around supersonic speeds, makes a hash of "Don\'t look back - it\'s a pyroclastic cloud !"

Of course the death and destruction from nucelar weapons in only the primary
kill, what follows, the secondary kill is likely to be muchworse. Disease,
famine, destruction of social order etc. So even if the nuclear exchange
killed only a few percent of the total population the pandemics that would
follow would kill many more. It is unlikely though that the total human
population would be wiped out, but it could be centuries before portions of
the planet would be safe to enter.

It\'s a bit more complex than that. There are three types of asteroid
(and likely some combinations). 

Nickel-iron. Mostly nickel and iron with various amounts of other
elements in the mix. Think of them as giant, natural chunks of armor
steel. Average density around that of iron (7.8).

Stony. These are basicly big chunks of igneous rock. They can\'t be
sedimenitary or metamorphic, because those processes require a planet.
But simply *melting rock and letting it seperate into different
minerals as it cools can happen in a quite small body (tens of km,
maybe as low as a km or less). They\'ve got a density like rock. (2-4?)

Carbonaceous chondrites. These are basicly what you get ice you let a
ball of methane/ammonia/water "ice" bake in the sun long enough. The UV
hitting the surface forms more complex compounds, and volatiles get
driven off. These are low in hydrogen, but rich in carbon and nitrogen.
What hydrogen they have is tied up in complex organics. These are
rather porous, and somewhere between tar and charcoal in structure.
They are very low density. 

Comets that hang around the inner system long enough will become
chondrites.

The way you get these types is that planetary systems form from clouds
of gas and dust. The gas tends to form ice particles as the cloud gets
thick enough to shield the inner regions from starlight. And the gases
and other elements react with each other. 

Soon you have clumps of ice with embbeded dust particles. And they
collide and clump farther. 

Since these clouds tend to be formed at least partly from the aftermath
of supernovas, they are rich in shortlived radioisotopes. So even
fairly small "dirty snowballs" will generate enough heat to melt the ice
in the inner layers. Remember, when an object doubles in size, the
volume goes up 8 times but the surface area only goes up 4 times. So
you have 8 times the heat from decay trying to get out thru only 4
times the are. Which means the thermal flux at the surface goes up
linearly as the size increases. Expect there\'s a limit to how much can
be radiated, and it take time. 

So the ice melts and the "dust" settles to the center. There it
consolidates into rock. Especially since ity tends to contain more of
the heat generating elements than the ice does!

If the dirt/rock ball in the center is big enough, *it* melts. And the
nickel iron (and various elements that disolve better in iron than in
rock) settles to the center. After a while, the radioactivity has
dropped off enough that things solidify. 

So now you have small balls of dirty ice, bigger balls of "clean" ice
with dirt/rock centers, and still larger balls of ice with a thick
layer of rock over a nickel iron core. 

Meanwhile, these balls have continued to sweep up dust and gas and
collide with each other, getting even bigger. But once they get to the
stage where the smaller ones have solidifying, the collisions are just
as likely to knock chunks off. And it\'s easier to break a chunk of ice
free from the rock than to break off a piece that includes the ice
*and* more than a trace of ice. So you get most bare rockbals, and
various sized chunks of ice. 

Likewise if rockballs collide, they are more likely to fracture at the
stone/iron boundary. So you wind up with chuunks of ice, some of which
have small amounts of stone still attached. Chunks of rock, which are
somewhat more likely to include chunks of nickel-iron from the
boundary, and chunks of nickel-iron, a few of which may still have some
stone adhering. 

Meanwhile, the gas cloud has flattened into a disk, and some of the
larger chunks have been vacuuming up the smaller ones. You start to get
infant planets, small gas giants, brown dwarves, and finally a star or
stars. 

Once a star lights up, the gas and dust are driven out of the inner
system by the solar wind. And the heat from the star starts evaporating
and melting ices in the inner system. So the smaller bodies lose their
volatiles, which get swept up by planets farther out. Eventually, the
icy bodies get baked down to chondrites.

And the infant planets have gotten big enough that ice flows under
gravity, rocks accumulate under it at the center, and even at the lower
levels of radioactive decay there\'s enough heat to melt rock (and the
pressure helps. 

And any chunks left close enough to the star that haven\'t consolidated
into a planet wind up as asteroids, which the types I listed.

> correctly, comets top out at several miles, not several hundred...

Actually, there\'s no reason there can\'t* be comets that big. But they\'d
be *very* rare.

Well, I\'m hardly a Latin scholar, but I did take it in
high school.  I don\'t have my dictionary or grammar
book with me here, so you\'re getting my very rough
shot at it:

DOMINATUS:  noun, nominative case, rule or dominion
HOMINIS:  noun, genetive case, of man or of mankind
SPLENDET:  verb, third person singular, present
indicative or possibly subjunctive; splendere
SPLENDIDE:  adverb, splendidly
AMPLOIS:  no idea
OUAM:  probably "quam", which
GLORIAM: noun, accusative case, glory
ASTRIBUS: noun, genetive plural, of the stars

the rule of man splendidly did something of which the
glory of the stars 

That\'s so rough that it\'s not quite coherent.  Maybe
it should be run through that language translation
software on the web.  There are probably better Latin
scholars than I on the list, anyway.

I don\'t know, but here are three addresses that were valid at one
time.  

rodge@digestgroup.com

rodge@cyberspace.com

dgpinfo@cyberspace.com

They might still be valid, but then again they might not.

BTW, if you do find out anything how about letting us know about it.

I can\'t comment on the Rogue or PI careers, but I _can_ comment
on the Police career, since my job puts me in daily contact with
police on the job in all aspects (I\'m not a cop myself, but I
work for the NYC PD).

I\'ll take it section by section:

(1) Enlistment: OK as written, although you may want to consider
reducing the reenlistment roll to 4+.

(2) Automatic skills: Police should get Gun Cbt (Pistol) at level
1, and Vehicle (appropriate to local conditions) at level 1. This
represents the effect of initial training, and regular retraining
(in NYC, firearms retraining is once per six months; vehicle
retraining is annually while deemed necessary due to accident
statistics).

Also, automatic skill levels should be granted as follows (See
revised Rank table at #7):
 - Leader 1, upon achieving the rank of Sergeant, if the
character doesn\'t already have it.
 - Liaison 1, upon achieving the rank of Lieutenant, if the
character doesn\'t already have it.

(3) Assignment: Change _one_ of the \'Desk Job\' entries to \'Beat
Cop\'. By and large, the primary duty of the police is to patrol
with the intent of acting as a deterrent to crime, rather than to
actively interfere with attempts at crime - although that is part
of their duties as well.  You want low incidence reported, with
most of those being caught, rather than just a high arrest/
conviction rate.

Change \'Homicide\' to \'Detective\'.  Detectives are actually a
separate track from the rest of the department up to a point, but
investigation of \'major\' crimes is left in that bureau\'s hands -
Major crimes being, generally speaking, Homicide (causing the
death of another), Rape (use of \'sexual\' activity as the method
of a crime), assault (a.k.a. assault and battery) (causing severe
harm to a person), Grand Theft (high value - jewels, lots of
money, expensive property, etc.), Robbery (theft with force
directly from a person), Burglary (removal of property from a
premises), and Auto Theft (theft of a Vehicle).

Change \'Vice Squad\' to \'Elite Force\'.  Vice focusses on things
like gambling, prostitution, unlicensed bars/clubs, and so on.
There are other special units, such as SWAT (anti-terrorist,
hostage situations, etc.), Street Crime (gang activity, drug
activity, fencing, etc.), Task Forces (any crime, if it\'s showing
up as a \'hot spot\'), and so on. Of course, it includes Vice Squad
(now often called \'Public Morals Division\').

Change \'High-Tech Investigation\' to \'Elite Unit\'. These are the
people that don\'t really go into harm\'s way - in addition to
investigating white-collar and high-tech crimes, it includes
things like ceremonial units, publicity units, details assigned
to public events, and so on.

Change \'Down or Out\' to \'Disciplinary\' (explanation below).

(4) Resolution: Homicide/Detective and Vice Squad/Elite Force
should have it slightly easier to get a skill - it\'s not unusual
for a cop transferred in to those units to get special training
in whatever they\'re concentrating on at the time of the transfer.
Promotion should also be slightly easier for these units.
Optional change for Beat Cop should be slightly harder; a
character in Desk Job should be forced back to Beat Cop on a roll
of 12. Limit promotion to once per 4-year term.

(5) Skills: Forgery and Bribery should not be \'Desk Job\' skills.
Substitute Liaison and Legal.  \'Desk Jobs\' are generally not
directly involved in day-to-day crime fighting; rather, they
represent the administrative and logistical support for the
day-to-day crime fighting represented largely by Homicide/
Detective and Beat Cop.

Drop \'Brawling\' from Detective/Homicide. Substitute Legal.  This
is mostly an investigative position, rather than an active
go-get-them position. Once the detectives gather the evidence for
an arrest, they generally make it on a warrant and a quiet visit
- - \'Mr. Smith, I have a warrant for your arrest, please come with
me.\' Since detectives often work in plain clothes, it\'s not
unusual for a \'Beat Cop\' to accompany them; his purpose is to do
the brawling if necessary - and it usually isn\'t, surprisingly.

Drop Liaison from \'Beat Cop\' - they don\'t get the chance to
\'liaise\'.  A better one to substitute would be Carousing.

Drop Carousing from Elite Force/Vice Squad. This makes room for
Gun Cbt (long firearm).

Change \'Instruction\' in \'Beat Cop\' to \'Jack-of-all-Trades\'. The
street cop isn\'t going to get much chance to teach while on the
job; rather, he\'ll find where the teachers failed to deal with or
appreciate the _reality_ of the street - training is often
simplified over reality to drive home a point.

Change \'Jack-of-all-Trades\' in \'Desk Job\' to \'Instruction\'. The
trainer typically hasn\'t gone on the street in years, because
they discovered he had a talent for explaining things pretty
clearly - which is what you need when you\'re dealing with the
average street cop.

Change \'Bribery\' in Elite Force/Vice Squad to \'Vice\', which
cascades to Bribery, Forgery, or Intrusion (which covers things
like lockpicking, safecracking, and fingerprinting). Note that
the police cover these skills less from the point of view of \'how
to do it\' than from the point of view of \'how to detect when it\'s
being done\'. Intrusion also covers things like computer
cracking(hacking), wiretapping, and other high-tech
information-gathering techniques, but these would not be the
preferred skills in Elite Force/Vice Squad.  See the next
comment.

You really need a seventh slot in Elite Unit/High-Tech. Since we
can\'t get that, drop the Jack-of-all-Trades and substitute
Intrusion, noting that the high-tech versions should be preferred
over the low-tech.

(6) Specials: One of the Corruption entries should be On Trial.
Regrettably, cops aren\'t immune to committing crimes other than
those things that are normally thought of as \'corruption\'.
Consider, for example, the Rodney King case (Los Angeles), the
Amadou Diallo case (New York), the Anthony Baez/Frank Livoti case
(New York; Livoti was the cop accused of killing Baez), the Abner
Louima case (New York) - none of these were \'corruption\'; they
were outright criminal assault (called \'brutality\').

If a character gets a special of On Trial or Corruption, and does
_not_ end up discharged or jailed, or as a Hero, the next year\'s
assignment should automatically be Disciplinary. See
Disciplinary, below.

(7) Ranks: If a player has ever been assigned to
Detective/Homicide, Rank 1 should be Detective, otherwise Police
Officer.

Rank 1 - Detective/Police Officer
Rank 2 - Sergeant
Rank 3 - Lieutenant
Rank 4 - Captain
Rank 5 - Inspector
Rank 6 - Chief

(8) Assignment: Disciplinary. This is usually a \'Beat Cop\' type
of assignment, but the character is on probation, and must keep
squeaky-clean. Resolve as normal for Beat Cop, but do not roll
for promotion, and apply the following changes:

	When rolling for special, ignore results of 4+.

	When resolving On Trial or Corruption, DM-2.

    Do not roll for Change; next assignment will be Beat Cop
    without these modifications.

If the bookkeeping can manage it, this character should
henceforth have a permanent DM-1 for promotion.

Depends. We\'ve yet to have a "small conflict" where we needed to take
out something big and sturdy. Closest we\'ve come were some of Saddam\'s
bunkers.

Well, there\'s a difference between radiation (gamma rays, x-rays, and
high velocity particles) and EMP. Shielding against radiation won\'t do
diddly against EMP and vice versa. 

Unless a ship spends a lot of time *close* to a *very* active star,
their protection against EMP is going to be fairly minimal.

There\'s also the question of "what do you mean by \'blind\'?". Some
sensors suffer permanent damage from overloads above a certain level.
Other\'s just quit working until the signal gets reasonable. And some
have a period after the overload where they have to "recover" before
reaching full sensitivity. 

Woe unto the attacker who thinks the enemy sensors are the first kind,
or even the third kind if they are actually the second kind. Sort of
like attacking at night and then finding out the enemy has IR and
nightvision gear. Oops.

Maybe. Sufficiently advanced mass detectors (mass detectors generally
detect *density* variations, rather than actual "mass") might have
trouble with the rapidly moving density changes due to the shockwave
and the like.

Sorry, but that\'s equivalent to requiring an *independent* long haul
trucker to file an itinerary months in advance. Just like Free Traders,
they go where the cargoes are. 

If you want them to pay at a specificplace, then you\'d better give them
a several month window.

> That is the way it works IMTU anyway.

There\'s still another problem with anything that uses one-time pad
technology. Say the ship is going to be someplace 4 or 5 jumps away for
his next payment. Ok, that\'s 5 weeks to h\\get the proper key there. But
if something goes wrong (ship carrying the key disappears, branch
manager suspects it was compromised, etc) 5 more weeks to get word back
to HQ. It\'ll take *another* 5 weeks to get the new key there. And 5
more on top of that to be sure it was ok. That\'s *20* weeks. For a
*quarterly* payment. 

Also, the key for the contract/payments has to be "fixed" because you
can\'t contact the ship to arrange changes. So that means that every
single branch the ship has used has a copy of the key. Which makes it
vulnerable, especially since it is "old" and "unimportant".

For that matter, I just realized that we *have* to use "public key"
type method. Conventional encryption can\'t protect a message (or data)
from someone who already knows the un-encrypted version. And since the
owner of the ship *does* know, you\'re screwed already.

Not really. The EMP output of a nuke goes up a lot slower than the
yeild does. Also, since EMP is "merely" a magnetic field "spike", there
are limits to what it can do. There are also *inherently* EMP resistant
(or even immune) technologies. 

A faraday cage will ground out any practical amount of EMP. Of course,
it\'ll also shield against radio, and make it rather hard to use wired
links. But a fiber optic link between the indide and the outside is
perfectly safe.

This is because EMP works by inducing current in any conductors aligned
at an angle to its direction of propogation. Since optical fibers are
non-conductive, they aren\'t affected. 

The *voltage* induced in a conductor depends on the length of the
conductor, measured at right angles to the pulse propogation. So a 10
mile power line aligned with the path of the pulse might get less of an
induced "spike" that a metal yardstick at right angles to the pulse. 

Thermionic devices ("tubes" or "valves") are *highly* resistant to EMP.
This is simply because they are already designed to handle high
voltages, and the sort of high voltage, low to medium current spike
that EMP induces will merely cause a momentary arc between elements in
the tube after which the tube continues operating as before.
*Lightning*, being high voltage, high *current* tend to melt wires. EMP
doesn\'t.

Semiconductor devices are so terribly vulnerable to EMP because the
various sorts of "junctions" that they use for switching and amplifying
are effectively *solid* dielectric capacitors. And it takes very little
excess voltage to do permanent damage by "burning thru" the junction
(that\'s why anti-static precautions are so important). 

If we develop small, fast "optical switches" then we can merely place
the (laser?) light source inside a small faraday cage along with its
power supply. An optical fiber can carry the light to the "photonic"
devices. And EMP won\'t do a damned thing to it. 

Also, back in the late 50s/early 60s, the military developed some quite
interesting thermionic devices. Basicly, they miniaturized the tubes to
the size of a *dime*, and built the whole device as a "solid" block of
metal and ceramics (the only hollows were the insides of those dime
sized tubes, and maybe some capacitors). I\'d say the size of the
devices compared favorably with transistorized printed circuit devices,
or even early IC based devices. Rather than have to deal with tubes
failing because of filaments burning out, the whole block was run
inside what amounted to a small oven! By using the proper metals and
ceramics this worked just fine. 

These were known as TIMMs (Thermally Integrated Micro Modules, or
something like that). Besides being immune to EMP, they also tended to
be very resistant to high radiation environments. And, given their
design, they *loved* high temperatures. Red hot was just fine. Orange
hot might degrade their performance some (resistanaces and inductances
tend to change at those temps). 

Still, this "lost technology" really deserves to be revived. There are
a lot of places where it\'d do nicely. Smelters, instrument packages
intended to operate inside active volcanos (What do you mean we have to
insulate it becayse the volcano isn\'t *hot* enough! :-). And, of
course, it\'d be great for a Venus or mercury probe. 

But given that we have one technology that\'s EMP immune and are making
significant progress in another, I think the Imperium can deal with it.

This eruption took place from a vent or vents near the Horomatangi Reefs, now
submerged on the eastern side of Lake Taupo. The eruption lasted between
several days and several weeks and produced a sequence of pumice deposits that
blanketed the landscape east of Taupo. In total about 100km3 was erupted.

...
At the climax of this eruption, about 30km3 of pumice, ash and rock fragments
was erupted in only a few minutes and travelled horizontally as a liquid flow,
moving at speeds estimated at between 600-900kmh. It crossed every obstacle in
its path except the top of Mt Ruapehu.

- ----
- ----

From this I would interpret that while one hundred km3 of material was
erupted, most of it didn\'t go "into the atmosphere" except in the sense of
flying upwards or sideways a few meters. If a typical eruption speed was the
600-900 km/h described above, the highest altitude the debris could
reach would be 3000 m or so, so I\'d be interested to see the "other sources"
suggesting several km3 made it into the stratosphere. (Elsewhere the
website does mention a column 50km high, so some fraction does make it
into the stratosphere.)

More fundamentally, how long particles persist in the atmosphere depends
strongly on their size. Even if several km get into the stratosphere, if most
of
it is pebbles of pumice, they\'re going to fall right back down again. It\'s
the ash and similar tiny particles that count; figuring out the ratio of ash
freed up by nuclear explosions/fires vs volcanoes is non-trivial, and a
direct comparison of material volumes isn\'t helpful.

More likely:

DOMINATUS HOMINUS SPLENDET SPLENDIDE AMPLOIS OVAM GLORIAM ASTRIBUS

My guesses:

DOMINATUS HOMINUS SPLENDET SPLENDIDE AMPLOIS OVAM GLORIAM ASTRIBUS
dominion  man                                     glory    stars (stellar?)

The splendet/spledide pair are obviously something to do with
"splendor" possibly verb and noun forms or adverb forms.

Sometimes a V is a V. Latin as written in Classical times didn\'t
distinguish much between U and V or I and J.

A more liberal translation (Glenn, check me on this):

I\'m doing this as a best guess from Glen\'s literal and my experiences with
Church latin (and 1/2 semester of college latin).

The problem lies more in the fact that the voltage requirements for
microcircutry to be blown WILL be generated with sections as low as 2CM
long consistantly if you are anywhere within the LD10% radius...
(Scientific american had something on this when I was in Jr. High... about
1980). Any conductive metalic substance will generate current from EMP. The
smaller the circutry, the smaller the spike needed to cause a failure. Note
the term failure doesn\'t mean it stops working; it means that it no longer
works as designed. If there is current flowing during the spike, you may
wind up with gates frozen in one position. Memory is even more prone to
this kind of failure. The static charge built up is also a problem.

The smaller the circutry, the lower it\'s voltage tolerances. Vaccum tubes,
mind you, are recoverable. Solid state, in most cases, is replace. Put 5w
through most 2W processors, and it\'s time to buy a new one. Put 50W
through, and you definitely need a new one.

Currently, EMP resistant processors use a combination of a faraday cage and
radiation shielding, along with spike resistant design. None is EMP "PRoof".

The FIB computers, in traveller, are the ones with a completely optical
secondary system which parallels the main one. If you look at the HG and MT
rules, EMP is not limited to just vaping computers.

EMP also has other fun effects: Fillings &/or orthodontia will generate
current & static charges. Surgical Pins, Plates, Screws, and meshes will
get hit with a charge, too. At high enough levels, even the Iron and trace
metals in your body will generate some current (But you\'d prolly be well
cooked by then).

One other thing: The primary route of EMP current generation is going to be
the power feeds. No computer operates without power. Even if you isolate
the system, using a battery, you will get some EMP effects.

>
Unless you have a completely secluded system, any faraday cage (the best
defense against EMP from all that I\'ve read) will have some holes, even if
they are filled with fiber cables. You need a power feed... Either a
battery or generator inside the cage, too.

One other thing: Solar flares can and do generate EMP. In Alaska, it
sometimes gets strong enough (Courtesy of the polar magnetosphere gap) to
shut down computers and other sensitive devices. Especially in the
fairbanks and barrow areas. Strong enough that during high solar flares,
induced current has been known to make phones whose line is severed at the
house (non-payment) ring. If EMP-Proof equipment was feasable, it would be
in use north of 70deg N. As it is, most people just take the risks... Even
worse, the magnetic pole is close enough that it makes navigation a problem.

The youth in CT desperately needs one more Clique: Musicians.

	Carousing-0/2+

4: +1 Int (Musical training improves Intellectual function. Established by
multiple studies)
5: +1 Edu (From wide exposure to additional languages and music/Audio theory)
6: Instrument or music skill
7: 1d6 Instruments

Keep in mind most serious musician types really do dedicate about 2/3rds or
more of their high-school free time to practice. Most are good by high
school.

You might also want to add a "Cadets" type clique.
Military Cadet Programs have a wonderful advantage upon completion: they
should grant a bonus to acadamy enlistment, grant easier entry to a
military career,
Skills should include Gun Combat, Leadership, and Liaison and/or admin
(Those would be what most cadet programs stress on the high school level;
I\'ve been in two [NJROTC and CAP], plus in a Fire Dept Explorer post).

Artist might be another good clique... Artists are a breed unto themselves.
Good chance of drug use, too... in search of inspiration.

Overall, this looks like an improved version of the Children In
Megatraveller article from DGP\'s Traveller Digest.

 Hello!
 I was going through my MT stuff and on one page I find the good old Rule
 of Man quarter-credit coin. I guess the reverse side says something like 
this:
 
 "DOMINATUS HOMINIS SPLENDET SPLENDIDE AMPLOIS OUAM GLORIAM ASTRIBUS"

I always translated it along the lines of "The splendor of the Rule of Man

In Wales and Cumbria in the UK there are still sheep farmers who are 
not allowed to sell the products or meat of their livestock because 
of the level of contamination from Chernobyl.

As an interesting aside, one of the first indications of Chernobyl 
having occurred in the UK was the tripping of external alarms at 
Sellafield (the Nuclear fuel reprocessing complex in Cumbria in the 
NW UK) during a rainstorm. One of my former colleagues in Health 
Physics (I always want to add \'and mind control\' to that) said that 
that they had some worrying moments when they were trying to work out 
why the alarms had gone off, but all the plants were registering as 
normal. Similarly, steam on site is backed up by a gas turbine CHP 
plant. Originally, the plan was to use coal from local sources, but 
it was realised that the natural radiation levels of the coal would 
set off all the site external alarms if any dust blew around.

I think "The dominion of man shines shinier more than the glory of the
stars".  Assuming "ouam" is for "quam" and you don\'t mind my intentionally
overliteral cheesiness.  Hm.  I also forget all the tense/aspect junk in
Latin and can\'t remember which "splendet" is; I\'m wondering if it\'s not
one of them future forms.  

In any case, this makes me wonder: what do other interstellar polities
(like the SOlomani Confederation, or the Zhodani Consulate, say), call
their "Credit"?

The closest thing to what your suggesting would seem to be the rules 
for automation in T4, which do reduce your crew requirements. this 
idea works fine unless your in TNE, when Virus rears its ugly head.

Actually, that should be "solar flares IMPACTING THE EARTH\'S
MAGNETOSPHERE can and do generate EMP". Out in free space, all you have
to deal with is the trapped flux in the solar wind (much lower field
strengths) and the *huge* blast of high energy protons (think of it as
a badly out of focus CPAW beam). 

It\'s those protons crashing into the field lines and atmosphere near
the poles that cause the effects William describes. And it\'s the
similar (but more localized) particle fluxes from high altitude nukes
reacting with the magnetosphere that cause the widespread EMP. 

You will get *localized* EMP if you are close to *any* nuclear blast.
But you won\'t need to worry about it as you\'ll be well within the
lethal radius of the blast!

I\'ve known some CAP people. My patrol leader in Boy Scouts was one. I\'d
consider some skills that go with all the SAR (Search and Rescue) work
they do. Or at least they did a lot in *our* area. 

For that matter Scouting started out as a "paramilitary" organization
modeled after certain aspects of the (British) Army. I dare say that
Scouting should continue on into the future. Maybe even wind up as a
sort of "cadet" program for the IISS.

I\'ve never been happy with computer hardware and software rules, and
being determined to get the Mae Lee\'s stats up on the web, I was
working on them this weekend.  Hoping I wouldn\'t have to reinvent
the wheel, I worked backwards through the versions looking for
something I liked...

First, GT.  GURPS has computer hardware and software rules that look
very good.  I don\'t like the 2xlog10 complexity, though.  Your TL-4
MainFrame (TL-10) complexity 6 can run 6 Complexity 6 programs, 120
Complexity 5 programs, 1200 Complexity 4 programs...argh!!!  I
forsee too much bookkeeping, but the idea *is* appealing.

T4, FFS2, CSC.  Sorry, but I\'m still scratching my head.  CSC comes
close, but...I just can\'t get into them.

TNE and FFS. Nooo, afraid not.

MT.  I\'ve got MT, first printing, and the amount of errata in my
books is such that I\'ve never been able to figure out how to use the
computer rules.  Heck, I don\'t think they work at all...as they
appear in my book. <sigh>

CT.  Forget High Guard, it\'s just a simplification of Book 2.  Hum,
Book 2...I think Book 2 had the beginnings of a good system.  There
were too few computer models, no rules for creating other models,
and we all know the volume, power and price problems, but I *really*
did like those individual programs, the juggling the PC\'s had to do
to get the right ones running at the right time, and the effects
they had on gameplay.  If only there *were* rules for creating new
hardware and software for the Book 2 model...

Surfice it to say, my final choice for computer rules was CT,
suitablly tweeked, of course.  I\'m going to (and frankly, I hope
someone out there has already) come up with hardware construction
and software writing rules eventually, but for now I just WAGed a
bunch of new models and new software programs to pick from.

Tweeks.

    1.  Shrink the volume of Ship Mainframes to 2 dtons or less.
        Although they are smaller, they continue to be larger than
        you might expect for several reasons: 

        a. they are *heavily* shielded from radiation and EMP
        b. they are constructed to be self-correcting and massively
           redundent
        c. they also include space for an occupied workstation
        
    2.  Reduce the power and cost to ~10% of the price listed in
        LLB2. 
        
    3.  Multiply the CPU by ~100 and Storage by ~500.  Now, you have
        room at the bottom of the scale for mini and micro
        computers.
        
    4.  Have the volume and cost drop, while capability (processing
        and storage) increase as the TL\'s change.

    5.  Include mini computers for optional dedicated procressing.
        Put one in the Astrogation station, in the Pilot\'s station,
        the Sensor Ops station, etc, and let them run the programs
        for that station..or, of course, keep the stations as smart
        terminals served by a big mainframe.  You get trade offs in
        cost, reliability and flexibility going either way.
        
    6.  Add many more available software packages.  Specifically,
        packages that reduce the number of technical personnel you
        need to operate the ship.  You trade off the cost of
        installing and maintaining more computers with the cost of
        hiring and maintaining Engineers and Techs.
        
I don\'t know how well all this works.  The added models *are* WAGs,
the software list is short and still in flux, and getting from the
guesses to a *system* of construction isn\'t a sure thing, but I\'m
pretty pleased with it as a first pass. 

I\'ll post the tables in my next post.

That\'s actually an adapted list; the complete list would be as
follows:

Recruit
Police Officer/Detective
Corporal/Detective Investigator
Sergeant/Detective Sergeant
Lieutenant
Commander
Captain
Deputy Inspector
Inspector
Assistant Chief
Vice Chief
Bureau Chief
Chief of Department

The Detective track and the rest of the department merge at
Lieutenant.  Departments that do not have their own police
academy normally omit Recruit; most municipal departments omit
Corporal/Detective Investigator (usually, State Police have this
rank).  Commander is generally omitted, but does occur in some
departments that don\'t have all four \'Chief\' ranks. Really small
police departments (rural villages, for example) may not have any
rank above Captain, and the Captain will be called \'Chief\'.

NYC omits Corporal/Detective Investigator and Commander, but has
all four \'Chief\' ranks.

Ranks are Civil Service (promote by examination and seniority) up
to Captain; ranks above Captain are political appointments.

There is a nominal distinction equivalent to Enlisted and
Commissioned, but in practice, it normally is meaningless.  Some
departments have strong policies against fraternization with
anyone of subordinate rank, others limit such policies to direct
chain-of-command, others have no policy.  NYC has a
chain-of-command fraternization policy, enforced only when there
are clear problems because of it.

I think Kenji\'s translation has the right "feel"; the trick with latin mottos 
(IMO) is to keep the flavour right.  Thus I would go for:

"The Rule of Man shines brighter than the glory of the stars" or

"The Rule of Man outshines the glory of the stars"

I think I should add a micro or perhaps a small mini for
entertainment software for the crew and passengers.  I suppose it
could be served though the mainframe, but personally, I\'d have a
separate computer *not* networked to the ship\'s systems for
passenger use and entertainment.  That would keep potential
hijackers out of places they shouldn\'t be.  Maybe I shouldn\'t have
mentioned that.  <g>

     Hm.  What I\'d really like to do with it is read "amplois ouam 
gloriam astribus" as "amplius quam gloria astrorum," which would make the 
whole thing translate to "The Rule of Man shines more brilliantly than 
the glory of the stars."  Unfortunately, while I can imagine "amplius 
quam" being misread as "amplois ouam," the last two words are beyond my 
ability to rationalize. <shrug> Perhaps the only book on Latin grammar to 
survive until the Rule of Man had some errors in it?

The long awaited collection of the Keith CT supplements came in a
nice folio, with a big \'Keith Brothers "Lost Supplements Collection\'
sticker on the side.  Inside there are 8, 8.5x11 stapled books, and
an envelope containing several small "goodies." 

The books have manila cardstock covers with Keith drawings on the
covers and "blurbs" on the back.  The pages inside appear to be a
good heavy stock and are *filled* with pen drawings interspersed
within the 2 column text.  The only shortcoming I can see is that
the covers don\'t quite cover the inner pages.  I suppose the only
way to make that work would be to have inner pages progressively
narrower, and I can\'t really blame Cargonaut Press for this...I
wouldn\'t have thought of it either.

I\'ve just finished reading the first two of the eight books, "Letter
of Marque" and "Scam", volumes I & II of the Rogues in Space
series.  There is a very large book "Faldor:  World of Adventure",
adventures on a primitive planet.  "The Arctic Environment", with
rules and adventures in that sort of environment.  "Starport
Planetfall", a collection of rules and encounter tables dealing with
starports and landings on planets. All these books were authored by
J. Andrew Keith  There is also "Reaver\'s Deep", a complete
sourcebook for the named sector, written by Paul Sanders, the
"Imperial Calender", mostly a book of large drawings, by William H.
Keith, and "The Volentine Gambit", a 30 page set of instructions and
background to a computer game, by Jim Long.

The envelope includes an adventure by Hans Ranke, "Hellion\'s Hoard",
the disk for the game mentioned above, maps of charted space and
Faldor, and cardstock forms for use with the two Rogues in Space
books.  It also contained a bumper sticker for Far Frontier Tours
advertising their tours on Faldor, a tri-fold brochure for Arctic
Adventures advertising their expedition cruises, a very ornate (and
official looking) Letter of Marque and Quitclaim Deed.  Finally,
there was a credit card sized (and plasticized) Bar Chit "Entitles
bearer to one free drink per day in any Imperial Starport
Establishment." <g>

I already own the earlier version of "Letter of Marque", and I don\'t
see any major changes in this second version.  Even so it is *much*
better.  The layout and organization of material makes it much
easier to read and use.  There are rules for generating pirates and
detailed rules for "commerce raiding" in all forms.  Additionally,
there are rules for damage control, repairs and breakdown though the
addition of a "Reliability" rating for various ship systems.  There
are 5 very complete adventure setups, and 4 ships complete with
deckplans. 

"Scam" is a complete treatment of con games and stings done for
Traveller.  Andrew extends the system to include 6 new attributes
detailing the personality and behavioral profile of the character.
His Universal Behavioral Profile (UBP), adds Persuasion, Charm,
Insight, Gullibility, Character and Will to the mix in the familiar 1
1 to 15 range, but also gives ways to "fake it" using the old UPP
characteristics.  These new characteristics, and a number of new and
changed skills form the heart for a set of rules covering lying,
intimidation, mimicry, bribery, haggling, blackmail and many other
nefarious and not so nefarious activities.  A complete character
generation system is included for the Con-man career.  Finally, 4
complete adventures are included.

Wow!  This is *good* stuff!

Actually, a bit farther back then that. This is what I
know of the published materials:

Supplement 1: 1001 Characters
On page 43, it has 9 scifi characters redone for Trav.
Supplement 4: Citizens of the Imperium
On page 42, 8 more scifi characters are covered.
Imperial Lines 1
On page 5, 3 more scifi characters are covered.

There may be others covered in later editions of
Imperial Lines or even JTAS or Challenge; I don\'t
have alot of these issues so its possible more may
be listed that I don\'t know about. For those who
don\'t have S1 or S4 I believe I saw that material
posted on somebodys website. I don\'t remember
whose...sorry :-<

One other note: I believe in one of the early JTAS
issues there was an article about a particularly
nasty xenomorph with acid for blood.....I can\'t wait
till those books get reissued :-) :-) :-)

Digging this stuff up has conjured up some shallow
thoughts:

What would happen if Barbarella met Harry Mud?
                                and
       Ming the Merciless vs. Darth Vader:
      Heavy Weight Championship Title Fight?
                                and

I missed the start of this thread, but if you look at GURPS Traveller: Far
Trader, pp. 82-85, you\'ll find just such a system spelled out for GT, at
least for merchant characters. Templates are mostly designed for newbies,
because the character generation system for GURPS is so detailed and
baroque. I had to implement a certification system to show what the minimum
qualifications for various positions would be. GT: Starships will repeat
and expand this system somewhat -- I am open to suggestions on
qualifications I need to add (Able Spacehand is already on that list).

Good stuff folks!

There is another good, albeit small scale,
example of vulcanism near urban areas:
Montserrat. Pyroclastic flows, explosions,
earthquakes and other assorted nastiness.
IIRC when they had the last big pryo flow
there they lost 19 people and had the major
city, Plymouth, get plastered with flow and
ash. Real ugly.

ObTrav: The usual things, evacuating people
and or vital items, monitoring and surveying
the area to try to predict volcanic events
(degree of predictability depending on TL
and ability of surveryors). Merchants, don\'t
forget those sightseeing tours for your passengers
(and hope nothing goes wrong...<eg>).

Yes, this the sort of thing we were talking about.  Of course, this
is for GT.  <g> William\'s list was more MT.  The same sort of things

Look at BlackICE and William\'s posts.  If you missed them, contact

Darn. I thought you\'d have a better story than this one... something along
the lines of "Now I have to call salesmen salespeople" or something like
that. No, you\'re not seeing a pretty much dead and dusty language being
changed, you\'re seeing borrowed english words being changed, most likely for
brevity and simplicity. Since lots of folks already go around shortening the
word to "alum" anyway, it\'s not a real big deal.

Nah, I doubt the language is going to change... pronunciation might though.
I took three years of Latin and learned one set of rules for pronunciation,
but it seems that the rest of the world learned an entirely different set of
rules for pronunciation.

That can be somewhat disorienting.

My biggest problem with designing craft with Traveller computers
has been there doesn\'t seem to be any scaling effect.  It doesn\'t 
seem right that a particular computer will operate the same whether
it\'s in a 1000 ton cruiser or a 100 ton scout.  Other than that,
I agree completely with your assesment of computers in Traveller.

As for the WAG\'s on numbers, the first thing that stuck me was that
most of the storage numbers were in or near the thousands.  Could
the thousands be dropped off?

Yeah, I thought about that too.  I think there should be some sort
of size factor, but I\'m not sure how to work it in.

Possibly, the reason I did that was to give a low end range for
smaller programs that would run mostly on micros.  Wordprocesers,
spreadsheets, games, system utilities, communication utilities and
so on.  I might could drop from thousands to hundreds and have the
mid range programs in the hundreds and the low end programs in the
tens and single digits. I\'ll think about it.

I don\'t find any Latin words in Langenscheidt\'s that have "oi" or "ui"
following "ampl". Amplus is an adjective meaning "of large extent,
ample, spacious, roomy"; "strong, violent," "splendid, magnificent,
glorious, honorable," or "esteemed, distinguished, honored, ilustrious,
excellent, noble."  "Amplius" is a noun meaning "a greater amount; a
larger sum"

the stars."

We humans are modest, if nothing else.

Actually, that\'s the usual mistranslation favored by the legal
profession.  "Ipsa", however, is not a reflexive object, but rather an a
nominative case pronoun in apposition with the main subject "res".  The
meaning is "The thing, itself, speaks."  (As a member of the
aforementioned profession, I am somewhat fond of these narrow
distinctions of meaning.)

I\'ve also thought about the computer scaling problem with traveller. The
only way I see to get around it, if you go with the programs, is to have to
have more programs on larger ships. The combat programs are the easiest to
do this with. If every gun or perhaps battery requires another program then
we now will need more computer. If you then consider the program feeds a
gunnery program must have we end up with even more computer needed. Of
course to do this you have to take a look at all the programs your planning
on having in the game because we find that each helps and hinders the other.
Can you have a target program that is of x level if the sensors are of x-1
or even if the maneuver program isn\'t giving enough significant digits for
that matter.

The bottom line of course is that a small computer can run a very large ship
but not one that needs to do a lot of things. This means you can have a bulk
freighter that has a small crew but couldn\'t fight it\'s way out of a paper
bag.

I know this isn\'t keeping with the tread but I think of ships in traveller
much like the Sailing ships of old. If we are looking at ships of the line,
they were way over manned, had more sail and shot than they could use, and
had tall masts and extra rigging but ran out of water quickly and spent a
considerable amount of time in port. For having this large mast their
effective horizon was further away, they had plenty of people to keep up
with many things going on at the same time and had the equipment to meet any
contingency. The small brig that was trying to make a profit however had
barely enough people to keep up with the weather and would took so much time
to come about that the guns would be useless even if they were manned. In a
battle type situation they were simple overloaded with all the tasks that
needed to be performed.

Computers and manning levels in traveller should be the same way.

The same sort of event seems to have occured in Franklin, New Jersey as
well. This little town in northern NJ is the only source on the planet for
several phosphorescent (sp?) minerals.  They are named after several of the
local towns: Franklinite, Ogdensburgite, and others which I can\'t remember
and are all found in a single "vein" that\'s oblong and roughly a mile long.
 The mine for these oddities is no longer active, but I can\'t remember if
it\'s played out or if there\'s no longer any commercial demand for the
products.  This is all from memory - I visited the place once, about 20
years ago.

One thing to consider, the larger the ship, the larger the I/O
requirements.  The greater the I/O requirements, the greater the storage
requirements.  Ponder this, for the equivalent of a PC the deciding factor
is the user interface, well that and making it big enough that you don\'t
easily loose it.

On the other hand a computer dealing with ships sensors is going to have to
have some pretty fancy interfacing hardware, and it will deal with all
kinds of inputs.

Same thing with the computer that deals with the Jump drive.  In fact for
the jump drive you may have individual inputs from points all over the jump
grid.  This could be a good reason for increased size and expense with
larger vehicles.  Each one of those sensors costs money, each one requires
an interface to the computer.  It adds up.

Then there is environmentals, failover systems, etc.


Think about the differences between Microcomputer, and
Minicomputer/Mainframes.  As an example I\'m typing this on a G4 PowerMac,
by todays standards it\'s a very powerful system, however, I\'ve got 3 PCI
slots, and one AGP slot.  Though I can hang a lot of stuff off it with
Firewire and USB, I can add SCSI and hang still more devices off of it.
But, a microcomputer really isn\'t that great and handling massive I/O
loads.

On the other hand off to my left is a PDP-11/73 Minicomputer, by today\'s
standards it\'s painfully slow, but it\'s got a 12 slot backplane, and I
could chain other backplanes to it in order to get more slots.  I can stick
an unbelievable range of I/O cards in it, that just aren\'t possible on a
Microcomputer.  As an example I could easily hang a dozen terminals on the
PDP-11 without any difficulty.  Or I could have a bunch of Analog to
Digital cards in it, and have it monitoring machinary.  I could have a
fully functional system with just three cards, but I could have a total of
20 cards in just this chassis.  The Mac is the size of a normal tower PC,
the PDP-11 the is size of a short filing cabinet, it makes a good endtable.

The real difference between Micro\'s, Mini\'s and Mainframes isn\'t the speed,
it\'s the I/O and storage capabilities.  You want something built for speed,
you go with a system built specifically for speed.  I think by a certain
tech level most all processors will pretty much be the same speed, speed
differences will be based on the number of processors (we\'re already
starting to see this).

Also, sometimes you don\'t want the greatest level of miniturization
possible.  Larger is easier to work on, and it might be more reliable.  The
smaller a device, the harder to repair, and the more specialized the
equipment needed to repair it.

Oh, and all those sensors hooked up to the computers generate logs.
Someone cycles an airlock, it\'s logged, someone turns on the lights in a
compartment, it\'s logged.  The larger the ship, the more you log.  The more
you log, the greater the storage requirements.  You might want redundant
storage in different parts of the ship on in case something happens to one
part of the ship.

Oh, and as for software costs.  Standard pricing schemes once you get out
of PC class computing seems to be the greater the size of the system, the
more it costs.  For example the software to backup said PC might cost $150,
but the *exact* same software being used to backup a 1.5TB fileserver migth
cost
$30,000.  Specialized software such as video editing software is likely to
cost $1000, yet you can get a Encyclopedia for $35.  There is no reason to
believe this won\'t continue on into the far future.

Just some random semi-disorganized thoughts.

Ah, good point!  And one I hadn\'t considered.  So, you could have
Sensor 1, 2, 3 etc, representing the processing power needed to
track multiple objects.  You could also have multiple programs for
things, it takes Target to use turret weapons *and* Launch to
control missiles or sand, and Gunner Interact to add the Gunner\'s
skill to the task rolls.  You could have Sensor to *use* the sensors
and Track 1, 2, to n to allow 1, 2..n objects to be tracked with
those sensors.

It also might be possible to have a multiplier for some of the
programs based on the size of the ship.  Say, 50 x Size_Mod, so a
Size 1 vessel needs a 50 CPU program, a Size 5 vessel needs a 250
CPU version and a Size 9 vessel needs a 450 CPU version.

There are 32 novels in the Dumarest of Terra series and they should be read
in the following order:

The Winds of Gath
Derai
Toyman
Kalin
The Jester at Scar
Lallia
Technos
Veruchia
Mayenne
Jondelle
Zenya
Eloise
Eye of the Zodiac
Jack of Swords
Spectrum of a Forgotten Sun
Haven of Darkness
Prison of Night
Incident on Ath
Quillian Sector
Web of Sand
Iduna\'s Universe
The Terra Data
World of Promise
Nectar of Heaven
The Terridae
The Coming Event
Earth is Heaven
Melome
Angado
Symbol of Terra
The Temple of Truth
The Return

Tubb originally intended for five other novels to be set on Earth after The
Return( although only recently published in the U.S., The Return was
written over a decade ago). Due to his advanced age, it is unlikely that
they will ever be written. I am currently hammering out a deal with Tubb\'s
agent to commission Tubb to write a 12,000 word novella set on Earth as a
follow up to "The Return" - keep your fingers crossed. Hopefully, if
written, this novella will at least tie up several of the loose ends that
still remain after Dumarest finds Earth at the end of The Return. 

Cordially,
Paul

Hmmm, just took another look at your list.  You need to include databases
in it.  When the sensors pickup a target, the you\'ll need to have databases
for identifying things about it.  For example, on the Solomani Rim, you
wouldn\'t need the Zhodani Ships Database, but you might want it if you were
bouncing around behind the claw.  Other databases would included things
such as known weapons systems and sensors.

For example, you\'ve jumped into a system near the Zhodani boarder.  Your
sensor operator picks up a incoming track.  The computers would start
searching your Ships recognition databases.  Then if the operator clicks on
that track, the computer will display its best guess (or possibly guesses
(should be software selectable)).  Then the operator decides it\'s hostile
and queries about weapons systems, based on the data in the Ship
recognition database the computer pops up a list of suspected weapons
systems, and the operator can click on one of them and the computer will
pull it up from the weapons database.  All the while the computer is
processing sensor output, trying to get a better idea of what the track is,
and how it\'s configured, as time progresses any variances from the norm
would be displayed in a different colour.

Since this kind of tracking would suck up the CPU cycles, you\'d want to
also designate a target as display only, don\'t analyze.  On friendly ships
you\'d get most of this info from the transponder signals.

Software and databases would have a minimum of two quality levels, civilian
and military, and in reality, would probably have more.  For example, there
might be a level above military that includes data not normally available
to the military (spy ships of some sort might fall into this catagory).

Now here is a scarry thought, because all this is computer controlled the
Imperium might very well be able to arrange for certain classes of ships to
remain undetected simply by having the software not display the tracks!

BTW, what was the purpose of your list?

Doesn\'t that become

once the "poetic English" filters are in place? :-)

I don\'t have much problem with that. IMO the controls (in FF&S, MT, 
etc), which are volume dependent, represent the parts of the computer 
system that vary in size with the size of the ship. I see no real need 
to make the CPU and memory change in size with increasing ship size. 
However maybe it should cost more (for extra HD space, more expensive 
software, etc).

Here\'s a list of the one\'s I\'ve got or know about, in order:

1.	The Winds of Gath
2.	Derai
3.	Toyman
4.	Kalin
5.	The Jester at Scar
6.	Lallia
7.	Technos
8.	Veruchia
9.	Mayenne
10.	Jondelle
11.	Zenya
12.	Eloise
13.	The Eye of the Zodiac (I don\'t have this, and my copy of _Jack of 
Swords lists it as number 12, and _Eloise_ as 13, however my copy of 
_Eloise_ claims to be number 12, and claims to be the original 
paperback edition).
14.	Jack of Swords
15.	Spectrum of a Forgotten Sun
16.	Haven of Darkness (Two copies)
17.	Prison of Night (I don\'t have this)
18.	Incident on Ath (Don\'t have this, either)
19.	The Quillian Sector
20.	Web of Sand (Don\'t have it)
21.	Iduna\'s Universe
22.	The Terra Data
23.	World of Promise
24.	?? (Don\'t have it, don\'t know its name)
25.	The Terridae

That\'s all I have, and I haven\'t seen any around lately, more\'s the

Is it possible that it\'s Church Latin, rather than classical? IIRC 
Church Latin has some weird differences from Classical.

So, did you get taught "v" as "v", "v" as "w" or "v" as a sort of mix? 
At school we got told that the "v" should be slightly soft, at 
university that a fairly hard "v" was OK as there are no Romans left to 
hear, but one of our lecturers used some horrid mixture of a soft "v" 
and a "w".

That and that agricola means farmer is about all I can remember, though.

Latin was a living language for a long time, so it\'s not surprising that
there are different ways to pronounce it.  My imperfect understanding is
as follows:  Classical Latin was spoken a very long time ago, like
before 0 CE.  Vulgar Latin and Church Latin are the more recent use, and
are pronounced somewhat like Italian.  Legal Latin differs from country
to country, and only vaguely resembles Classical or Vulgar Latin (that
is certainly the case in English).  Italian is known to some people as
Latin for regular people to use.

Gee, too bad it doesn\'t translate to something like:

"The splendor of the Rule of Man outshines the Empire of the Stars"

I would expect the Solomani (nee Terrans) to gloat at least a little bit.

Actually, Gary, this isn\'t changing it on the altar of PCness, it\'s
changing it on the altar of grammaticality.  Referring to female graduates
with a male-gendered pronoun was ungrammatical in classical, vulgar, and
(so far as I\'ve been told) medieval latin.  Cicero and Sallust, if they
were alive and kicking today, would be major PC-ifiers, by this standard

Those would probably fit in as different library modules. Off list, in
the Akus Moby PBEM game we\'re having the same discussion, and a question
I asked was \'what\'s\' the Library...Eris answer was, essentially, that
they were databases of different types.

So to answer your question, we have to buy \'Janes All the Imperium
Starships\'.

However, if the Imperium started playing games with what is and isn\'t
detected, well, then we get into the fun stuff, like collisions between
civ ships and these undetectable spy ships. Also, these things don\'t
control the sensors, just interface with them to provide more info. That
unknown will show up as an unknown, not as nothing. More likely, though,
it\'ll show up as a oohh, fishing trawler or something ;-)

My point is that it becomes more viable for a PC who is not otherwise independently wealthy to own a ship by making smaller ships, not that the ship becomes any more economically practical.

IMTU banks don\'t make loans to traders who want to just "follow the
market".  It is too risky.  Especially when you factor in elements like
skipping, piracy, communications lag, misjumps, and so on.  The only
really independent Free Traders are ones that are old and paid off
already (by working the small but regular trade routes and freight lines
for many years).

	My take has always been that the added computer requirements
	of larger ships are provided for in subsystems located
	around the ship, and additional computer systems that are
	part of the \'bridge\' tonnage.  This leaves the Main
	Computer free to deal with jumps, targeting, etc.

<snipped>

	IMTU, a fully-equiped turret includes it\'s own computer,
	which interfaces with the Main Computer.  Apart from a
	Multitarget program, a separate Predict program would
	have to be run for each separate target (but not for each
	turret).  A fighter without a full \'small bridge\' needs
	to have special Small Craft Maneuver and Small Craft
	Sensor programs to function (these are functions normally
	carried out by computer systems integral to the bridge).

One question would be, to what extent is what we consider Hard Drive space
simply Computer memory at a certain techlevel?  Hard Drives are a thing of
the past, even for us, to many moving parts so reliability is a problem.
The future is most likely Holographic storage(1), or some form of RAM disk
along the lines of what a lot of digital cameras use.  This is current
tech, though not widely available or even known, who is to say what they\'re
using in the Imperium.

In any case the larger the ship the greater the requirements for CPU and
memory capacity.  Each thing the computer is keeping track of will require
at least a little memory, and the more things you keep track of the more
CPU horsepower it will take to track everything.

			Zane

(1) Holographic storage and optical computer have been around for over 10
years.  Recently some serious advances in Laser technology have seriously
increased the storage capacity of such things.  IIRC, 10 years ago a piece
of material the size of a sugar cube could hold the equivalent of a CD-ROM.
Unfortunatly this tech is still in the laboratory as far as I know.

Well, presumably the spy ship would simply move out of the way.  If they
got to close the computer would probably sound a colision alert.  Or
<bwahahaha> just blow the ship up :^)

As for controlling the sensors, they would to a certain extent, but mainly
they\'d be analyzing and displaying the data.  You want the person setting
at the computer to be able to turn on/off sensors, or focus them on a
specific object.  You also want the computer to handle the majority of the
work.

I generally try to stay out of this type of thread; however, I
really must protest.  The New Testement is one of the
most studied books ever and is the best authenticated
document in the history of man.  The last portion of the
New Testement (commonly called the Revelation of St.
John), was probably written before 70 AD (less than 40
years after the death of Yeshua (Jesus).

There is a complete manuscript of the New Testement
that dates back to c. 100 AD.  It contains the same 27
books that are in the modern "canon."  While it is true
that there is some dispute over certain "additions/
deletions" in some of the ancient manuscripts, it is also
true that none of those disputed passages are the only
place where the things added/deleted are included.  If all
of the disputed passages were deleted, nothing would
change.  If all of them were included, again, nothing
would change.

By comparison, for the next best authenticated historical
document, the oldest manuscript was copied over 400
years after the completion of the document in question.

I\'m not saying that you should become a christian;
however, I am saying that as a historical document,
there is not a better documented/authenticated one
extant.

Quite simply, most of the people who pay serious attention to the Bible
believe that it is accurate (or at least truthful) before they even learn
to read, much less learn how to study history. It\'s pretty hard for a
skeptic to give that kind of apparent bias the benefit of the doubt.

"The Acadian"

I would appreciate suggestions!  Post them to the TML or
email me at eaglesto@nortelnetworks.com

This adventure assumes the PCs have a small starship (100 to
400 dtons), and a more or less normal crew.  I am also assuming
they are wandering around District 268, Glisten, Trin\'s Veil or
some other place with useful backwaters.  Our group has used
their characters in the Chamax Plague and Horde.  I guess these
characters are the Hard Luck PCs.


Scene 1. The Set-Up

[This scene is stolen material from Jens Rydholm... it looks good enough
to use!]

The PCs are hired by a megacorporation (SuSAG?) to take some
"medical supplies in sealed containers" to a research station somewhere
Far Away (TM).  They get paid well, but are ordered to keep the fact
that they are working for the company secret.

When the ship gets to the destination, they find out that the storage
limitations at the base requires the containers to be split inside the cargo
hold, and the smaller cases inside to be unloaded separately.

Inside the containers are several boxes about 2.5x1.0x0.5 meters. They
have some electronics attached to them, and look suspiciously like low
berths.

As the last cases are being transported out of the hangar using an old
four-wheeler of some kind, the PCs recieve their payment from an officer.
Suddenly, one of the cases crashes to the ground. The plastic breaks, and a
something shows through. A human hand. The officer rushes the PCs into
their ship, adds about 25% or so to their payment, gives them a warning
look, and leaves. They are more or less ordered to leave the station as
soon as possible.

After this, a number of things could happen. If the PCs go to some kind
of bigger media, they won\'t be believed. If they go to smaller, more
honest media, or perhaps seek rumors in bars or somesuch, they will hear
rumors of horrible experiments...

In any case, no matter if they talk about the affair or not, the officer
that paid the PCs will regret (after orders/threats from his superiors)
that he let them go. Agents of the corporation will begin to look for
the PCs. Depending on how public they have made themselves, they will be
more or less easy to find...


Scene 2.  Shock Value

The PCs arrive in yet another backwater system, to hear a GK
broadcasting from the outsystem.  They of course load their weapons
and sneak into the outsystem, where they find a Corsair drifting amidst
the wreckage of another, comparably-sized vessel.  The ship does not
respond to hailing.  Analysis of the Corsair reveals it has functioning
life support, though it appears to have only low levels of power.  Unlikely
as it seems, the ships appear to have collided, and the corsair somehow
survived, while the other appears to have been ripped to shreds.

Analysis of the wreckage indicates that the other ship was a 400
dton unstreamlined vessel.  Residual power signatures indicate it
had a standard drive/power system.

Boarding the corsair, the crew are randomly attacked by disgusting
parasitical? creatures lurking on board... which also, by the way, are
casually eating the corpses of the corsair\'s former crew.

The crew were wearing Imperial government uniform -- plain navy
blue with brass and a starburst.  No ID, no name tags... and no
ship\'s log.


Scene 3.  The Acadian

The PC\'s ship arrives in yet another backwater system.  Doing a
routine scan, they detect two other ships: one is a lab ship, hanging
out just on the edge of detectability, and the other is a trader, in the
inner system.  As is common out here, there is no data on either ship.
The crew notices that the trader is underpowered, and its transponder
is off, it is not accelerating, and its vector is off the plane of the system;
in fact, it appears to be adrift, and all attempts at communication will
result in dead space.

It\'s not necessary for the players to investigate, but it\'s most of the
work I\'ve done so far... the ship is the far trader Acadian.  Its
power plant is in sleep mode.  It has one laser and one sandcaster.
Its hull is in fine condition -- no signs of battle scars recent or old.

The ship is of a classic Vilani design -- the casual observer can\'t
really tell, but captains generally can -- and boarding the ship will
confirm the ship\'s construction.  Her registry is of the Aakkaad
Shipyards of Vland.  Vilani traders are known to be annoyingly
low-automation ships, with coded jump tapes, manual power plant
controls (i.e. control rods, flow valves, and mechanical pressure
gauges), an analog cockpit, and mechanical air compressors,
filtration systems, etc.  That said, it is noted that all these pieces
work beutifully well, giving a cool, smooth, metallic feel to controls
that would otherwise be digital-in-plastic with solid-state blinking
lights (Das machine control is nicht fer geverken by das dumkopfen!)

One divergence from the classic Vilani design is in the sensors --
they are excellent, better than most traders would bother with.
Of course, in these systems, having good sensors is understandable.

The PCs have two opportunities: they have salvage rights, which
entitles them to posession of the ship.  The ship is probably worth
MCr10... unless they take it to Vland, in which case it\'s worth maybe
MCr20.  However, a little digging will unearth the identities of the
former crew of the Acadia -- they look normal enough -- and the
interesting fact that there was a MCr50 policy taken out on the crew,
originated from a bank on a world a few parsecs away.  However, no
more data is forthcoming.  Perhaps it would be interesting to see what
the bank knows about this.

One of the crew opens the \'fridge, only to find that all the perishables
- -- stocked only a few days ago -- have gone badly rotten.


Scene 4.  Those Wacky Droyne

The next system has a few obvious ships: a system defense boat
or two, a trader or two, and another lab ship, which seems to hang
right on the edge of detection range.

One trader is a Droyne ship.  The Droyne are very friendly, and
a bit silly.  They have an annoying habit of buzzing the PCs ship.
At any type of contact they become obsequious to the extreme,
bringing gifts and interesting food on board if allowed, and inviting
PCs to their ship to dine with them, play video games, whatever.
Most are young, but even the older members of the crew seem a
little daft.  From the innumerable slide shows, party games, and
magic tricks, the PCs may conclude that the Droyne brain isn\'t
geared for focused thought.  A number of ship systems aboard
the Droyne trader are in disrepair and show signs of obvious
neglect.


Scene 5.  The Bank

The next system is empty, except for a lab ship in the inner system,
heading outsystem at a constant 1G in a straight line.  Should the
PCs trader take a close look at lab ship, they will see Droyne markings
plainly on the hull, yet the ship maintains communications silence.

If the PCs manage to make contact with it, for some reason (faking
an emergency and forcing interstellar assistance laws?), they will find
the ship crewed with humans, not Droyne, who will render as little
assistance as possible to the trader before scurrying off on their way.

When the PCs reach the bank which issued/holds the insurance policy,
they will find out that the policy has already been cashed in, by a
megacorporation... say, SuSAG.


Scene X.  Now We\'re A Concerned Party

Imagine their surprise and concern when the crew turns out to have
a policy placed on them by SuSAG!



Questions for you.

1) How and when do they find the policy taken out on their ship?
2) Where to go from here?  What new enigma should be thrown
on them?  It\'s been pretty innocuous up to this point...
3) How can I massage these scenes to blend better?  Or do they
work together fine?
4) Should I give them a framework to work within?  For example,
should they be working for a megacorporation delivering mail between
these backwater systems and a regional center of commerce?
5) Should Scenes 1 and 2 be switched in order?  And should Scene 1
be merged with, say, scene 3 or 4?


Answers from me.

A) No, I don\'t quite know where it\'s going.
B) Yes, I\'m trying to make this gritty and X-files-like

Kenji, you\'ve been told wrong.  The convention in
Latin, followed today in other gendered romance
languages, is that, in general, if a plural inflected
word (typically noun, pronoun, adjective, or past
participle) refers to both men and women, the gender
of that word is masculine.  So Smith can have an
alumnae association, but Swarthmore must have an
alumni association.  (Exempli grati:  compare "Jean et

Different organization entirely.  Sheriff\'s Departments are
generally at the county level, and often focus on _code_
enforcement rather than _law_ enforcement, and deal in civil
actions.  Thus, the massive ticket-and-tow operations when double
parking gets out of control in an area are usually under the
Sheriff\'s command; so is the service of subpoen or eviction
notices - even though there will be cops involved with both.

If you feel that it\'s _absolutely_ necessary to shoehorn
Quick-Draw McGraw and Dippity Dawg into the rank structure I\'ve
given above, treat QD as \'Captain\' in a department with nothing
higher; DD becomes \'Officer\' or \'Sergeant\'.

Not where the Sheriff\'s department is the primary law enforcement
agency. In New York City the situation is pretty much as you describe,
even in much of suburban (to NYC) New York it\'s similar (since NY has a
large State Police force) I remember how surprised I was once, driving
along in NYC, to see a Queens County sheriff\'s car. ("Theres a Sheriff\'s
Department here??? I\'ve never heard of them. What do they DO???!!!")

OTOH, Los Angeles County has a very large Sheriffs department, which
handles the entire range of police duties, from parking violations to
homicide investigations. They cover the vast areas of the Los Angeles
Metro area that isn\'t _in_ Los Angeles proper, though you couldn\'t
easily tell it on the ground.

Here the Pima County, the Sheriff\'s department is about as large as
Tucson\'s PD, with all the same responsibilities with a much larger
geographical area to cover. (FWIW, about 1/2 of the total population of
Pima county lives outside of the Tucson City area, though mostly still
in the so called \'metro area\' around Tucson, the rest of the county is
pretty sparsely populated, and a great deal of it is Indian lands, which
have their own police forces.) There\'s a LOT of interagency stuff going
on, and there\'s also been talk of combining county and city agencies
into a single metro-area government.

Same here in Texas. The City PD is responsible for about 40 K folks, while
the Sheriff has to cover the entire county and the other 300K folks.

The Constables tend to handle a lot of the civil stuff you mentioned. I
think each county has several constable districts and they even get neato
cars too :)

The Return is still in print. The URL is:

For the other two, I\'d sugest one of the online used SF bookstores - I
personally prefer Pandoras, their URL is:

You bring up a very good point.  Being one of those \'bible\' people myself, I
do tend to look at it from the paradigm that is biased towards its accuracy.
However it has been pointed out to me that VERY biased people did the
translating.

The sheriff is an elected position, typically the highest in a county (or
parish). Small sheriff departments have several deputies who may or may not
be civil servants. Large sheriff departments, (in Chicago, for example)
provide court bailiffs, serve court papers, and staff  jails. Large
departments have deputy ranks  like chief deputy, lieutenant deputy,
sergeant deputy, etc., sometimes including investigators.

Not entirely true. In point of fact, for about the last two centuries
theologians have been all over the map concerning whether or not the Bible
is accurate or truthful. The assumption that you\'re making is inaccurate. To
say that over the course of 200 years everyone who\'s had an interest in
studying the Bible was brainwashed before they got there is something of a
slander.

What *has* happened is some fantastic reading, if you\'re into that sort of
thing. In the late 17th (maybe early 18th) century a (now) little-known
theologian named Reimarus stood the theological community on its ear when he
presented his commentary on the passage of the Israelites through the Red
Sea. The other shoe dropped when Spinoza introduced a naturalist
interepretation of the miraculous. So, then, after decades of theological
skirmishes, Strauss pushed the mythical interpretation... and so on and so
on to the modern day.

Keep in mind that Jason said the Bible is *authentic*, not that it\'s an
*accurate history*. There\'s a *very* important distinction there.
Considering the fact that, nowadays, the majority of Biblical scholars don\'t
actually believe it\'s an accurate history. There are some who feel that
certain parts of it are accurate. There are also those who, although they
believe that much of it portrays actual events, believe that those events
were of a wholly rational nature.

Okay. Sorry \'bout the rant there.

For a different take on the Police, see my version of Police for MegaTraveller.

Go to my website, then ==> Tavonni Repair Bays ==> Police Characters for
MegaTraveller.

This is actually based on the UK model portrayed in "The Bill". For those who
want a US-based version, use Jeff\'s ranks. For example, there is no "Lieutenant"
or "Captain" in the UK system, and the US uses "Chief of Police" rather than
"Commissioner of Police", since there is no monarch to receive a commission
from.

Naturally, since local law enforcement _by definition_ is local, there is no
problem for one world using the US notation, another using the UK notation,
another using something completely different (eg. "commisars" or whatever). You
can even split the ranks more, and have a "Customs Branch" ranking system with
various "Customs Officers", or a "Riot Brigade" that uses a more military
ranking system (good ideas for a big force on a Hi Pop Hi Law world). Jeff\'s
original article in 1995 even skipped ranks if the force was small.

The point about planetary police is that they ARE different. With subsector
police, I cheated a little to reduce the number of ranks. You can expand them
again to allow detectives at the subsector level, if you want. After all, It\'s
Your Traveller Universe.

Oh, and the query about "officer" and "enlisted" is a hard one. After all, every
policeman is a "police officer". Therefore, I use the terms "officer" and
"commissioned officer", which at first glance seems a tautology, but remember
that the military has "non-commissioned officers" as well.

BTW, one of my sources was "Law Enforcer Characters", a TML article by none
other than Jeff Zeitlin back in 1995. To be fair, I used it as a reality check
on the skills I was giving out, rather than for the ranks. Also, I don\'t really
know if the UK has a "Station Sergeant" and "Area Sergeant" or whether some
sergeants are just more senior than others (eg. Bob from "The Bill"). However,
they seemed convenient titles to allow me to create the E6 and E7 ranks.

For the record, I think that the "Law in the Imperium" article from Challenge
could be said to be based on SOTE and the d\'Alemberts (note that IRIS hearkens
back here as well!). I agree with a previous poster who said that one MoJ
officer per 100,000 people was too many. This is closer to the SOTE structure,
where the Empire has closer controls over its member worlds than (IMO) the
canonical Imperium has.

Having said that, however, feel free to adopt the article for YTU, since it is
by no means an unreasonable approach. It goes back to your view of your
Imperium, as the Trav Geek Code recognises. The Imperium only has to be slightly
more "hands-on" for an organisation like SOTE (or IRIS  ;-) to exist.

Which brings up something I\'ve been thinking of... I
recently read an article where some people studied
what makes a good sportsperson, was it genetic, etc...
and they found the most common predictor of
national-level performance was plain old practice.
That level is reached by about 10,000 hours of
training, usually 20 hours a week over 10 years
(sounds a lot, but as Will said, many can reach this
quite early.) I\'ve a sense the same would be true for
musicians and other artists. The article also said
that sometimes the person was a master of their sport,
but had less training, but it was usually found they\'d
trained elsewhere in other sports, eg a famous
pole-vaulter in Australia began as a gymnast...

So what skill level does this correspond to in Trav?
I\'m imagining Level 6 for T4... 

Sorry to bring up the whole "realism" question, I\'m
just trying to associate real skill levels with game
mechanics ones...

Ah, so that\'s where it comes from!

Anyhow, we *do* have Commissioners here in America. In Gotham City there\'s
Commissioner Gordon (he should be hitting retirement any day now). There was
also a short-lived TV series on one of the major networks called "The
Commish", which concerned itself with the exploits of a pleasant, lovable
and awfully *round* Police Commissioner. I think that Philadelphia has a
Commissioner, but now that I think of it, I\'m not all that sure.

Different organization entirely.  Sheriff\'s Departments are
generally at the county level, and often focus on _code_
enforcement rather than _law_ enforcement, and deal in civil
actions.  Thus, the massive ticket-and-tow operations when double
parking gets out of control in an area are usually under the
Sheriff\'s command; so is the service of subpoen? or eviction
notices - even though there will be cops involved with both.
>>>

Depends where you are. In New South Wales , Australia , the whole system is
different.

Ranks:
1. Probationary Constable
2. Constable  / Detective Constable (one ceveron)
2. Senior Comstable / Detective Senior Constable (two ceverons)
3. Segeant / Detective Sergeant (Three ceverons)
4. Station Sergeant (Three ceverons and a crown, similar to Army Senior
Sergeant)
5. Inspector /Detective Inspector
6.Chief Inspector / Detective  Chief Inspector
7. Deputy Comisiorner
8. Comisioner

The NSW police is a state base organisation (State Trooper in US Terms) but
there is no local police force (Local Governments use Rangers, these are low
level enforcements).

The Courts however, has Sherrifs (a bit like the Sheriff of Nottingham in
mentatlity) used to protect the court facilities, as well as enforcing court
orders outside the perview of the Police (generally evictions).

IMHO , in Traveller this is a better system , as it differentiates from military
ranks but is equivelent to military ranks. Other nationalities have different
rank systems, and can be subsituted if desired (The French police ranks could be
fun if I knew what they where).

Before we get too far into Yanks-and-Brits in Space,
let\'s remember that law enforcement can occur under a
large variety of paradigms.  In rural areas today, for
example, law enforcement may be in the hands of a
locally-based person or organization (sheriff,
headman, constable), or of a representative of the
central government (like a U.S. Marshall), or of the
military, or of paramilitary organizations (and not
just death squads).  To what extent can character
generation give different flavors to these
experiences?

Try using Function Points. A single program is probably going to be less than
100 FP\'s. A big, integrated editing suite might be 1000 FP\'s. Almost no supplier
makes a suite larger than 10,000 FP\'s. An entire set of software (that is,
everythng from m/f systems to minis to client/server to PC apps) for a large
government department may be over 30,000 FP\'s.

Kyle adds:
But one Connery can be proud of is "Outland", set on a
mining colony on Io where he\'s Sheriff. I liked it for
the dull, industrial feel of it, which I think more
accurately represents what space travel is likely to
look like and be like for the people doing it: more
that than the toothpaste-tube cleanliness of Star Trek
or Star Wars.

Reminds me of that great scene in "Armageddon" where
the Russian cosmonaut claims he can fix the American
equipment, they say, "No, it\'s American components,
you won\'t know how to use them." He barges in and
starts hitting the equipment: "American components
(bash!) Russian components (bash!) all (bash!) made in
(bash) Taiwan! (bash! machine starts up again)" Sounds
right to me.

Also explains why IMTU, as in another thread, ships
are much cheaper than in T4, et al!:)

Actually, when I was first hearing of Traveller back
in 1978 or so, my good friend James Polk showed me the
business plan he had drawn up for his Free Trader.  A
lot of the D&D people that we hung out with said that
Traveller was the most boring role-playing game ever. 
"All you do is, you go around and pay your debts,"
said one.  

I never ended up in a boring campaign, but then I
never put myself in the position of having to draw up
business plans.  I left that to the players who liked
it.

And with budgets to match.  When it comes to power, follow the

the public school system, and in some it is even higher.

I live in a small county, 100,000 people.  Three towns, Jay with
2,000, Milton with 8,000 and Gulf Breeze with 10,000.  The rest of
us live outside any municipality.  All of our law enforcement is
through the Sheriff\'s department.  There is a new 40 deputy
sub-station located a half kilometer from my house.  

Before we got the sub-station this year we were serviced by rolling
patrols working out of the Sheriff\'s headquarters 10 km away where
close to 200 deputy officers were based.  It is costing more, but
now there are 4 sub-stations sited strategically within the 4,500 sq
km of the county.  By spreading the deputies out we are getting
faster response in our outlying areas, and hence better protection.

And outside the big cities this is common all across the US.
Frontline law enforcement from deputies of the county sheriff\'s
departments.  Quick Draw, Boss Hog and Sheriff Andy are all figments
of urban imaginations when they suggest that\'s the way things are
today in non-urban America.

Ob Traveller:  
1.  Have the PC\'s run into jurisdictional problems between two or
more law enforcement agencies.

2.  Confront the players with a different system of law enforcement
than they are used to in their real lives.  If they are urban, put
them in an area where there are *no* city cops, only deputy
sheriffs, or vice versa.

My brother ingested some alum once when he was young, and it had that exact

ingest it, but to no avail...

Amplois is definitely church latin, or a common corruption. I\'ve
encountered that exact word in a latin dominican-rite Catholic
sacramentary. (was an alterboy at a dominican run parish, son of the
deacon, and later a music major, and did a bit of research on gregorian
chant... and encountered the term. Was told it translated to "to be ample".

Sheriffs Departments, rural or otherwise, are a parrallel department. THe
sheriff is (Usually) the Chief of the Department.

In most useages, Police Officer means city or municipal law enforcement
officer. Sheriffs are  usually elected to head the county sheriff\'s
department, and sherfiff\'s departments typically replace "Police Officer"
with "Deputy".
State Troopers typically use "Trooper" in the same place.

Let us look at a typical american "big city", Detroit, Michigan. Detroit
really is a collage of small cities (typically under 64mi^2). The detroit
metorplex straddles 3 counties (Wayne, Macomb, and Oakland), with the City
of Detroit (proper) being in Wayne County. You have the Detroit Metro PD,
the Wayne County Sherrif\'s Department, the Macomb County Sheriff\'s
Department, and the Oakland County Sheriff\'s Department. In wayne county
alone, you also have the following other police departments: Trenton PD,
Wyandotte PD, Allen Park PD, Licoln Park PD, Taylor PD, Garden City PD,
Dearborne PD, and Livonia PD (I\'ve seen cars from these in wyandotte; there
was a Police Officer\'s funeral a day after my grandfather\'s funeral), plus
possibly 5 more PD\'s. Each county has a number of townships and
incorporated cities in it, and all of them fall under the Metro PD\'s
jurisdiction, as well. The sheriff\'s are elected by their county, the Metro
PD Chief is appointed, but I don\'t know how. I do know the city manager of
Wyandotte appoints the Wyandotte PD\'s chief. I also know that on a robbery
call, DMPD, WPD, and the WCSD all responded, as did a Trenton PD officer
(The named suspect was from trenton, which was 2 miles down the road.)

In almost all cases, for state crimes, the State Police or State Troopers
can get involved. Also, most state trooper agencies are specifically
charged with highway patrol duties. (California also has a separate highway
patrol, if I understand california correctly).

Bringing this back to Traveller:

At least here on Terra, advances in medicines have often been aimed at
reducing the side-effects of otherwise-effective drugs.  Thus, paregoric
(which was often prescribed to relieve diarrhea, as opiates tend to
cause constipation) was replaced by compounds which also relieved
diarrhea, without the narcotic side-effects of paregoric.  Similarly,
there has been a trend in antihistamines toward compounds that are less
likely to cause drowsiness.  Presumably, as a general rule, as TL
increases, drug side-effects decrease.

The question then become:

To what extent (if any) does the Imperium regulate the interstellar
transport of medicinal compounds between worlds, if said compounds are
legal on the world of origin?  If there is no formal Imperial regulation
of such compounds, does the Imperium at least attempt to help worlds
maintain their own regulations on importation of medicinal compounds?

In other words, are PCs who purchase laudanum on a TL-4 world subject to
Imperial sanctions if they sell said laudanum on a TL-13 world that
strictly regulates opiates?

I would suspect that the Imperium might have to involve itself in this sort
of scenario. Introduction of addictive drugs into a society can have grave
economic consequences. Even the distant Imperium doesn\'t want an industrial
world to be turned into a crack den. Historically, this tactic was used
deliberately by the British during the Opium Wars. On a smaller scale, the
introduction of alcohol to the American Indians was devastating.

Because of real world examples, I\'d have to go with "yes."  Here in
Australia for example, there are drugs commonly found in the U.S., U.K., and
Europe for such things as diverse as impotence to cancer related
pain-relief, that are not "approved"  by the AMA (the Australian Medical
Association).  This means that such drugs cannot be imported (or
manufactured here) for sale here.  I also believe you cannot take
paracetamol into Turkey and Middle Eastern countries, just as the
un-approved drugs cannot be brought legally into Australia?

I would say that a whole swag of drugs and alcohols are banned from various
worlds for as many different reasons?  Some of the un-approved drugs here,
have been on sale in other countries for decades and are not approved for
such reasons as "not been proved," "are snake oils," or "dangerous unto
themselves" (for a long time here, you couldn\'t get sunscreen with and spf
of more than 15, as it was said the extra chemicals to obtain such ratings,
were more harmful to the user than the added protection factor was worth...
it was several years for spf15+\'ess with less harmful chemicals to go on the
shelves here.)  Similar reasons may apply for bans in other countries (and
in Traveller, on other worlds), plus with the addition of social and
religious reasons...?

this whole issue brings up the game design issue of Stats vs Skills in
resolving actions. Musicians, as a general rule, require a good bit of
manual dexterity, a high level of intellectual capability, a lot of
discipline, plus a number of distinct skills. Reading music is nearly
essential for serious musicians. (No offense here, but most rock and roll
is VERY musically simple.) A knowledge of one\'s instrument is also
essential. Ability to memorize, also useful (essential for solists and
vocalists). Ability to hear and relate to other musicians in the ensemble.
Ability to follow the conductor and read the music.

Skill with an instrument is a rote-learned series of associations of notes
to fingerings for most instrumentalists. On the stringed instruments, there
are several sets of fingerings per note, and are state-dependant upon arm
position (at least if you\'re going to make it). After a few years it
becomes reflexive: see the note, and if hand is in 1st position, use finger
X on string y; if in 4th position, yse finger V on String W.

When performing, most performers have at least partially memorized the
pieces (especially the page turns), and will alternate rapidly between the
music and the conductor. Vocalists typically are required to memorize their
whole program, usually by rote, and sometimes must also memorize dance
steps as well.

Writing music is little more than creating a melody, and plugging  in
whichever set of musical formulae you choose to use. Traditional classical
music is remarkably formulaic. Given the Bass and Soprano lines of a Bach
chorale, the average colege sophomore in a music program SHOULD be giving
you the exact same thing as Bach used. Soliere and even Motzart used the
same formula. Paul McCartney\'s music uses it, too... but not as tightly.

>So what skill level does this correspond to in Trav?
>I\'m imagining Level 6 for T4...
using t4 levels:
To be honest, most "Prodigies" should be about skill 4 (Professional) by
start of career (age 17/18), and gain probably about 1 level per two years
in their primary focus, plus pick up additional foci at the rate of 1 per
term. (The few I\'ve met who followed it on really aren\'t much better
rounded than they were in Junior High School... but they are really
impressive with their specialty).


>Sorry to bring up the whole "realism" question, I\'m
>just trying to associate real skill levels with game

If you want realistic music skill rules, here\'s a patch for ANY edition
(except GT):

The music skill level is a representation of the overall level of musical
expertise of the character. To represent more realistically the wide range
of capabilities possible with similar levels of training, let us define
some sub-skills. Sub-skills do not count towards skill limits in CT/MT, but
the general music training level does.
The Sub-Skills:
	Strings - Viol Family
	Strings - Lute Family
	Strings - Harp Family
	Percussion (tuned)
	Brass
	Woodwinds
	Keyboards
	Singing
	Music Theory
	Conducting
	Interpretation
Each level of General Music Skill gives you two levels of subskills. You
may take any combination. When resolving tasks, use the subskill level,
rather than the general skill level. In general, the first level will be
put into the  interpretation and chosen instument subskills.
General Music at level (CT/MT 2, TNE/T4 3) provides level 0 in all
subskills, simply due to eventual exposure.

A note on the strings subskills: The Viol family includes the Viols, plus
the modern descendants known as the (double or String) Bass, the
(Violin-)chello, the Viola, and the Violin. All viols are typically played
with a bow drawn across the strings. The Lute family includes Guitars,
Mandolins, and Balilaikas, and are generally played by strumming or
plucking. Both the Lute and Viol families have a few strings, whose tone is
changed by pressing the string down against a neck. The Harp family is
generally comprised of instruments with a wide number of strings, and each
playable note is a separate string (although most modern concert harps have
foot pedals which shift a series of strings up in pitch by a small
ammount). All three strings skill serve as level 1 in the other strings
subskills if held at level 2+, level-0 if held at level one.

A few notes on the "Non-performing" skills:
Music Theory is writing music. Generally, each level should include one
style of music whose formulae are known, as well as a general knowledge of
how to write, transpose, arrange, and edit written music.

Interpretation is the ability to read music and to get more than just
mechanical notes from written music. It is generally not used much except
by soloists and conductors, but a basic knowledge is essential to a good
performance. If this subskill is not posessed, any solistic work should be
one level more difficult.

Conducting is the ability to get a group of performers to perform based
upon the conductor\'s interpretation of the music. It also includes knowing
how to arrange  musicians themselves for best effect.

My point was that many of these things don\'t go up in volume much with 
increasing capacity, as most of the volume is for cooling systems, 
maintenance access and user interfaces - things that won\'t grow in size 
very quickly with increasing computer power. However the cost will 
increase quite quickly.

That was the *good* thing about a few of the original Trek episodes.
They actually had a few where the aliens *didn\'t* fall all over each
other to immediately accept advice from these "aliens" (the crew) that
was contrary to centuries of the native culture. "Let That Be Your Last

Just for the hell of it, here\'s a different take on it. 

Originally, "sheriff" was "shire reeve". That is, he was the "reeve"
(an office appointed by the Crown) of a "shire" (fair sized geographic
area, not under the direct control of a noble). 

So, is this "sheriff" a US style elected enforcement "officer" or a
Olde England style appointed by higher nobility enforcement officer? 

Note that in both cases they are responsible for "law enforcement" over
a large area (county/shire). But the US style is responsible to the
*people* (or at least to the local government of the area). But the
*appointed* variety is responsible to a high noble first, with the
locals only being a consideration to the extent that the law and the
noble say they are.

There\'s something *seriously* wrong here. Light sails, without laser
boosts or the like *can\'t* do even *1* g. 1/10th or even 1/100th g is
more like light sail performance. They are *not* high accel!

And just how *big* is this sail? And what does *it* mass? I bet you
forgot to add the mass of the sail to the mass of the ship before
calculating acceleration.

C.S. Lewis is one of the foremost Christian apologist of this century. His
stories are seeped in Christian allegory and morality. For example in the
Chronicles of Narnia the lion Aslan is a direct representative of Jesus
Christ. (And yeas that\'s probably where the name Aslan came from for the
Traveller race.)

No. He\'s a US Marshall. Big difference. Both are law enforcement, but
Sherriffs (US type) are elected and paid for *locally*. The type of US
Marshall Connery plays is supplied by a central government for a town
(or mining camp, back in the old west *and* in Outland) that doesn\'t
have its own police or sherriff.

Starwars was famous for the *grunge* on all the privately owned ships,
and places like Mos Eiseley. 

Star Fleet ships look good because these people are professionals, and
they *want* to be there. And in the Academy, they problably got
demerits for untidy rooms. :-)

With civilian ships, you\'ll see a lot less "spic and span", but most of
the time you\'ll see *neat*. Even when things are greasy and grimy. Why?
Because improperly stowed gear onbard a ship can *kill* you. And even
if it\'s "merely" lightweight personal possessions in your cabin, you\'ll
stow them or fasten them down securely so *they* don\'t get damaged.

*Any* experienced seaman is going to take one look at a sloppy ship and
decide that he\'s got better (and less painful or quicker) ways of
committing suicide than shipping with people who leave gear unstowed,
or who don\'t keep the things that *need* to be clean clean.

The same should go for spacemen. Even moreso. On a habitable planet, if
things stink, it\'s a nuisance. In space, if things stink it\'s either
fault life support, or somebody not cleaning up stuff that might
compromise life support later. After all the "scrubbers" are supposed
to be removing trace chemicals, many of which are toxic *long* before
you can smell them. So if you can smell "stinks", even if they are
harmless, it means the filters aren\'t working. And what may be in the
air that you *can\'t* smell?

When you get to things like living quaters in a sealed environment
(like the "camp" in Ooutland) you\'ll find folks a lot more casual. But
either there will be frequent accidents or loss of life from
carelessness, or there will be *enforced* standards for "neat" in areas
where it matters (basicly anyplace where "clutter" or "dirt/filth"
could cause an accident kills/injures folks *other* than the person
responsibly for the "junk" or "dirt"). 

Also, the "old-timers" will be *really* leery of anybody who hasn\'t
learned what rules are *important*. I\'m reminded of Belters in Niven\'s
universe (and a few others). Newbies (immigrants, or kids just getting
old enough to go out on their own) are *required* to complete a "term"
running a one-man prospecting ship before they can work at *anything*
except clerical stuff or very, *very* "non-critical" jobs.

Why? Because until they\'ve proved that they can follow rules and be
*careful* enough to keep *themselves* alive, they aren\'t going to be
allowed into a situation where they can take somebody else with them
when they make a mistake. 

In spite of training, *most* kids/immigrants *don\'t* live thru this
term. The kids haven\'t learned they aren\'t immortal yet. The adults
from habitable planets haven\'t learned that in space *any* mistake is
going to be fatal. They aren\'t "paranoid" enough about safety checks
and the like. 

Spacers from belts or other "artificial environment" worlds are going
to be *real* sticklers for details that matter. And tend to be *real*
suspicious of folks from places where you can walk around on the
surface without artificial aids. At least until they\'ve "proven"
themselves. 

Y\'know, that ought to be a "world classification" like Non-industrial"
or "Agricultural". Say, "habitable", "marginal", "artifical". With the
"habitable" types and the "artifical" types *really* not understanding
each other. The marginals won\'t take things for granted, the way the
habitables do, but they aren\'t as paranoid as the artificals. (after
all, on a marginal world, forgetting (say) your filter mask may
"merely" put you in the hospital.

A semi-rational attitude. If you *need* the equipment, it\'s not
working, and you don\'t have "proper" tools or instructions "bashing" it
(not hard enough to break it, but hard enough to jostle loose
connections and stuck valves) *is* a reasonable response. If you *do*
have tools, manuals and parts, you go by the book (unless you\'ve
learned the book is wrong,, or that 90% of the time the problem is a
bit of corrosion on a connector. Then a "bash" may be the "right" fix
again. :-)

A consultant brings a valuable, or even unique set of skills and knowledge

Without a personal belief that the Bible is a highly significant 
document, you will not study it rigorously enough to produce any
insights sufficiently developed to be accepted by respected Bible
scholars as significant. The majority of people performing these studies
are of a religious bent, even if they are currently in a doubting or
skeptical phase.

How about this: the majority of those studying the Bible have a 
spiritual bent, as those without one generally dismiss it out of hand.
With a spiritual bent - either for or against Chrisitianity - the Bible
has value, either as a basis for a belief system, or as a weapon
against belief systems (including Christianity). If spiritual matters
are unimportant, then the Bible is a historical and literary artifact,
more valuable as a source of indirect historical/social information 
(as the Greek myths provide context to Mediterrenean cultures) 
rather than for it\'s limited direct historical references.

The impression *I* have always gotten is that the Imperium doesn\'t care
much about local restrictions. You can haul anything that isn\'t under
*Imperial* proscription (say, thionite) from anywhere to anywhere. But
at your destination, if their isn\'t a port (complete with extrality,
which BTW seems to be an idea borrowed from Norton\'s SF) then you are
subject to local laws as soon as you leave the ship. Possibly as soon
as you land. 

If there is a port, then as long as you are inside the extrality line,
you aren\'t subject to local laws. You can sell your cargo to anybody
*inside the port*.

If you cross the extrality line, you are under local law, and could get
arrested for selling the wrong thing to a local. 

Thus, there will be notices listing the more important contraband
posted near the exits with terminals (high TL worlds) or printed lists
(low TL) giving the entire list. Even so, it\'s still possible to run
into a situation where you are the first person to discover that the
locals consider the harmless X you are trying to sell to fall into
prohibited category Y.

Unless things are really bad, being the first person *should* get you a
warning, and the product confiscated. You *may* be abler to petition
for its return if you promise to take it offworld. 

After all, in most cases neither the locals nor the Imperium want
traders to get surprised. But there may be times when it isn\'t that
simple. :-)

The Imperium will *always* want trade to go smoothly. Thus they\'ll
always be in favor of local laws being *clear* about products and
activities that are forbidden, so as to avoid surprise for traders and
visitors. 

Most worlds will agree, since even under "guilty until proven innocent"
type legal systems, it\'s both harder to get a conviction, and *very*
bad publicity if someone can legitimately claim that they had no idea
that the law meant *that*...

Some worlds won\'t like visitors. And they\'ll resent the Imperium. So
there, you\'ve got the local Imperial officials trying to keep an eye
out for legal boobytraps even as the locals try to construct more of
them without being obvious. Just the sort of place a GM likes to make
players visit. 

And, of course, even if the contraband list is posted and clear, there
are people who will smuggle things across the line because of the
profits. The Imperial officials are likely to give reasonable amounts
of help to the locals, unless the locals are some sort of fanatics, or
otherwise annoy the hell out of the officials. 

So on worlds where there are good relations, the exits from the port
may have "average Interstellar" tech sensors scanning for contraband,
even if the local TL is lower. The locals will have either paid for the
installation and maintainence, or they\'ll have made some sort of
concession to the Imperials.

On worlds with strained relations there may be "customs inspectors"
*manually* searching everything going in or out of the port.

When I was training for a job once, we were using citric acid in
*bulk*. And since this was training, they were using the cheaper "large
crystal" form. Instead of being like granulated sugar, this was lumps
the size and shape of rock candy!

Which led to a prank. Citric acid *is* very sour, but it\'s not going to
hurt you to eat a crystal or two of it. 

So we offered some friens some rock candy (and popped a piece or two
ourselves to allay their suspicions). If you are *expecting* this
super-sour taste, it\'s no big deal. Thus we smiled away as we sucked on
them. Our friends were expecting *sweet*... <eg>

	[Steve replied]  I\'d dispute this very stronglt - there are a number
of historians, sociologists and anthropologists (ignoring for the moment the
obvious religious scholars, who quite clearly don\'t HAVE to be religious to
study the development of religions, etc.) that study the bible and related
texts as it is useful for them: the compilation of oral histories of a
single ethnic group over the span of thousands of years.  No matter your
religious bent (or non-bent, as the case may be) it is a priceless
ethnography and historical text, as much for what it says as what it
doesn\'t.  Same goes for any number of religious writings (Book of Mormon,
Tripitaka, Qur\'an, etc.) - one simply does NOT have to be religious to
appreciate what these texts have to say, or to value them for other reasons.
That\'s like saying you have to be a communist to read Lenin or Engels, or an
American to appreciate the Federalist papers.

Nobody understands us.  It\'s why we\'re all in therapy.

But yes, we do have a seperate Highway Patrol.

Along with their duties patroloing the highways of the state, the CHP also
serves as backups for local LEO.  The state also has a tiny State Police
force, but they don\'t do much outside of Sacramento, the state capital.

Interestingly, there\'s a corner of San Francisco that is under the
jurisdiction of no less than five different police agencies.  The Presidio,
fomerly an Army base, now a National Park has the following agencies in it:

San Francisco PD
San Francisco Sheriff
National Park Police
US Army Military Police (some units remain, along with some housing)

In CT the original Type-S had a  nuisance  fault  with  its  life

Hmmm, how about this:

    Mod = local Pop digit + TL digit - 17
    (more than zero equals 0, less than -8 equals -8)

    Apply  Mod  as  penalty  to  reaction  rolls  of  spacers  to
    outsiders.  Local Pop digit is *local* pop digit (so if on an
    orbital base of 500  people  then  local  pop  digit  is  3).
    Reduce penalty by sum of Zero-G-Environment skill, Vacc  Suit
    skill, and years of service in Scounts or Navy.

Thus, the higher the TL the more robust the  environment  is  and
thus the less paranoid spacers are.

Yes, you used the term biased. On the other hand, you also made the claim
that, "...most of the people who pay serious attention to the Bible believe
that it is accurate (or at least truthful) before they even learn to read,
much less learn how to study history."

In my estimation, such a statement goes beyond mere bias into the realm of
"brainwashing". My apologizes for the mischaracterization if the above
statement is not what you meant, and yes I do find that to be "something of
a slander" on those who have participated in the scholarly study of the
Bible.

How I read your statement was that it is impossible for anyone who studies
the Bible to be incapable of being in anyway impartial.

> Without a personal belief that the Bible is a highly significant
> document, you will not study it rigorously enough to produce any

What do you mean by that exactly? I\'m not trying to trip you up here, but
your statement can be read in several ways, and there are many levels within
Biblical study: theology, biblical archeology, and the fuzzy areas where
several disciplines merge.

>The majority of people performing these studies

With all due respect, I\'m unsure how any student of history, specifically
Western and Middle-Eastern history could dismess the Bible out of hand. Even
those who don\'t follow a faith or creed that is based on the Bible can see
that it is the work with the most influence on Western culture. The Old
Testament alone is central to three of the world\'s major religions. I\'m
betting you said that with a straight face, too. ;)

It also has value on many, many other levels. Which was my original point.
Even in theology, which is perhaps the study of the Bible at its most
"religious" is marked by a great debate concerning interpretation itself.
Still, the statement above is a complete turn around from your original
statement.

>If spiritual matters
> are unimportant, then the Bible is a historical and literary artifact,

This is the case for many people to whom spiritual matters *are* important
as well. It\'s been that way ever since the early 18th century! Even so, it\'s
not a terribly indirect document. There is no doubt that the Bible was
*written* by people who lived in antiquity, and has over the course of
millenia remained pretty much unchanged. If my memory serves me well, the
fragments and books of the Old Testament known as the Dead Sea Scrolls don\'t
differ significantly from other later versions of the books of the Old
Testament. This is of real importance, as you\'re dealing with a text that
has remained unchanged nearly from the beginning of recorded history.

If that\'s not a direct voice from the past, I don\'t know what is. ;)

Now, on the other hand, the study of the Bible\'s "limited, direct historical
references" is only one small part of the study of the Bible, even though it
is the one which is most popular. Everyone loves books like "The Passover
Plot," and the evidence of the "real" flood discovered in the Middle-East
makes for great news filler...

Ach, this is terribly off topic. ;) If you want to move it to private mail I
surely won\'t object.

Yes, you\'re right, and I phrased my response poorly -- the original post
about PCness was referring to singular forms, which is what I meant to be
replying to.  To which I meant to be replying, as long as I\'m being a
pedantic idiot.

	Your reasoning works for explaining why some drugs may be
	illegal on some worlds and not others, but I can\'t see the
	Imperium being interested.  IMTU, even Psi drugs are not
	explicitly banned by the Imperium, though any significant

Honestly, I really wasn\'t getting to the point where I was going to blow my
top or anything. It just so happens that right now, literally as we speak,
I\'m composing a paper for class which is concerned with biblical
interpretation. I didn\'t see you as attacking anything, but it seemed as if
you were painting a picture that was at odds with reality.

I\'m not offended, although raised in a Christian household, I\'m not overly
zealous of it, and frankly, I\'m not too terribly fond of the concept of
religions in general. *However* there is a heck of a lot of discussion out
there that\'s been going on over the last two centuries or so on this
subject, and I honestly feel that you mischaracterized this in your first
post.

I really liked what you have proposed and find several new ideals which I
may integrate
into MTU. I\'ve also been working on a Police career system for several
years.
Here are some of my ideals:

There are local (planetary) and Imperial police within my game. I am
dealing here with the
Imperial Police Force (IMPOL). It is a comprehensive organization with
many responsibilities.
I see the Imperial Police operating only on Imperial worlds and starports
and not just any planet. IMPOL functions like a national police force. I
have
studied many different law enforcement organizations: the FBI, Interpol,
ATF, DEA, Secret Service,
Bureau of Prisons, NYPD, LAPD and Scotland Yards and have added many of
their duties and
roles to my system:

Imperial Police Force

Enforcement Branch - Uniformed patrol officers

     Enforcement (Traffic and Foot Patrol / Police Storefront Operations)
     Bomb Squad (Bomb & Explosive Ordnance Disposal)
     Hostage Rescue & Negotiation (Special Weapons & Tactics Teams /
Hostage Negotiators)
     Animal Teams (Formerly K-9) (there may be other types of animals used
in police work)
     Air Patrol (may include a Parachute Wilderness Rescue & Recovery
Team)
     Harbor Patrol (may include a Water Rescue & Recovery Team / Scuba
Team)
     Liaison Affairs (Special Details / Ceremonial Units, Community
Relations)

Investigative Branch (Detectives)
    Major Crimes (Homicide / Grand Theft / Robbery / etc.)
    Career Felon Apprehension Teams
    Gang Unit
    Vice Squad
    Special Task Forces
    Cyber Crimes
    Sex Crimes
    Behavioral Science (Psychologist, Profilers)

Security Services Branch
     Executive Security (includes Court Security and Special Executive
Protections Details)
     Witness Protection (protection and relocation of witnesses)
     Corrections (Imperial Prisons & Jails)
     Parole Office (monitoring progress of released prisoners)
     Customs / Immigration (generally at starports)

Special Branch (Criminal Intelligence)
     Internal Affairs
     The Inspectorate (police with noble titles dealing with crimes
involving other nobles)
     Terrorism / Counter Terrorism Task Force

Support Services Branch
     Communications
     Motor Pool
     Evidence / Property Room
     Crime Lab
     Personnel
     Accounting
     Logistics
     Contract Services (licenses and overseas Private Investigators and
Bounty Hunters and assigns
            felon recovery and other cases as needed)

Imperial Police Academy
       Instructor

Office of the Commissioner
        Special Liaison or Aid


New Police Skills:

Truth & Identity Analysis - Using techniques and technology that help
identify either victims or criminals
by standard laboratory techniques such as fingerprints, dental records,
DNA matching, rental patterns,
brain waves, etc. as well as using polygraphs, stress detectors, hypnosis
and truth drugs in determining facts
and data.

Surveillance / Counter Surveillance - Using a variety to surveillance
technologies to monitor and record criminal activities.

Forensics - Crime Laboratory

That\'s only sometimes true, and only in very recent
times.  The history of drugs -- and medicine in
general -- is by no means a simple, linear advance.  

>Thus, paregoric (which was often prescribed to

Of course, before paregoric, one treated diarrhea with
large amounts of water (to replace fluids lost) and,
if I recall correctly, ginger and chamomille, which
are stomach tonics.  Water, ginger, and chamomille
have no side effects at all, and they don\'t stop the
diarrhea very quickly.

>Similarly, there has been a trend in antihistamines

>drowsiness.  

Of course, you won\'t get drowsy at all if you don\'t
take anti-histamines.  Acupuncture, vitamin C, and
water all help clear the sinuses with no side effects.

>Presumably, as a general rule, as TL increases, drug 
>side-effects decrease.

It can go either way, actually.  It depends on the
drug culture more than anything else.  As TL
increases, it\'s possible to isolate more and more
specifically what extrinsic chemical is affecting what
part or system of the body.  Isolated effects can
cause severe side effects in other systems.  On the
other hand, as understanding of the body\'s systems
improves, it\'s likely that treatment will focus on
helping the whole person be healthy, not just getting
rid of a particular symptom.  

>The question then become:
>To what extent (if any) does the Imperium regulate 
>the interstellar transport of medicinal compounds 
>between worlds, if said compounds are legal on the 
>world of origin?  

I\'ve said it before, and I\'ll say it again:  The
Imperium does not regulate drug traffic, except to the
extent that drugs become a threat to the security of
the realm.  If opium is legal on Efate and illegal on
Pyasadi, Efate and Pysadi have some tension to work
out between themselves, but it\'s not the Imperium\'s
problem.  

>If there is no formal Imperial regulation of such 
>compounds, does the Imperium at least attempt to help

>worlds maintain their own regulations on importation 
>of medicinal compounds?

Nope.  That\'s why you have the Imperial Rules of War. 
If Pysadi hires the PCs to take out the drug barons of
Efate, that\'s not a matter of Imperial law nor a
subject for Imperial intervention.

>In other words, are PCs who purchase laudanum on a 
>TL-4 world subject to Imperial sanctions if they sell

>said laudanum on a TL-13 world that strictly 
>regulates opiates?

Nope; see supra.  

How about this situation?  

A plant grows in a certain rich soil on a certain
world.  When cooked properly, the plant makes a tea
that is very effective in treating a certain serious
disease.  SuSAG, LIC, makes a drug utilizing different
chemicals that is also effective in treating that
disease.  SuSAG\'s drug is far more expensive than the
plant, but it can be manufactured anywhere.  SuSAG\'s
drug may or may not have severe side effects.

1) SuSAG has been able to get the world where the
plant is grown interdicted.  The PC are hired by a
rival company to bring back seeds and soil samples, so
that the company can compete with SuSAG in this
market.

2) An epidemic of that disease has begun, and SuSAG is
unable to manufacture the drug fast enough.  Can the
PCs harvest enough of the plant to help?

3) SuSAG started the epidemic.

4) The interdicted world where the plant grows
regularly gets its stuff off-world and onto the drug
market, which drives SuSAG crazy.  SuSAG hires the PCs
to wipe out that world\'s agricultural sector.

Yes again! In my locality we have at least 15-16 seperate
public and private law enforcement organisations ranging
from the city police to National Park Rangers to the
Secret Service and state game wardens. On the lakes
we have city, county sherrif, and Coast Guard Auxilliary
boats (although I don\'t know what the extent of the
Coast Guard Auxilliaries powers are).

Twilight:2000 (1st ed-I don\'t have the 2nd) always had
good rank tables for different services and countries--
I\'m especially thinking of the RDF Sourcebook. Any
examples of police ranks in a similar fashion? Also,
you gotta know that the Vilani did things different from
us upstarts; how might they have done things?

The games I\'m getting rid of are:

2300AD boxed set                  7.00
Earth/Cybertech Sourcebook    4.00
Equipment Guide                      4.00

Colonial Atlas                          4.00
Ground Vehicle Guide             4.00    or 25.00 the lot

Star Cruiser Boxed space combat game for the above, all counters, 1 map
missing (but the 2 maps were identical - a big photocopier will rectify
the missing map)  4.00

Star Trek RPG (Games Workshop printing)    7.00
Star Trek III Sourcebook                               3.00
Star Trek IV Sourcebook                               3.00
Mr Scott\'s Guide to the Enterprise                  5.00
The Federation Sourcebook                           4.00
Trader Captains & Merchant Princes Source  4.00
Demand of Honour scenario                           3.00    or 25.00
the lot

Bushido boxed set + Valley of the Mists campaign pack, plus selection of
Dragon magazines with oriental RPG articles, say 10.00 the lot.

OR if you want to take the whole lot off my hands (go on, you know you
want to!) shall we say 50?

Now to the trade part....I\'m looking for GDW\'s Striker game, the
Twilight\'s Peak and Signal GK adventures, and Robots book (all for
Classic Traveller).  Give me a yell with what they\'re worth to you and
I\'m sure we can do a deal....

named a leonine race, about whom we concluded that they must smoke Camels,
wear turbans and have sandy claws, so Merry Christmas.

It is.  CS Lewis took it from Turkish; the Traveller author in question (I
forget who it was) probably took it from CS Lewis, and *within the OTU
history* it\'s not stated whether the Solomani were thinking of CS Lewis or
were Turks when they gave that name to the Fteirle.

The first time I saw Star Trek: the Next Generation, I thought they had a 
lounge instead of a bridge.  The tactical station is a perfect location for 
a DJ, and I always thought that an ensign should walk in with some drinks 
for the well connected lounge lizards in the big chairs watching the wall 
sized tv screen.


ObTrav:  The Scout Service functions via peer review, and it (like all 
systems) has a potential for abuse. How many Scout ships/teams are turning 
a blind eye to the abuses of their fellow Scouts so that those others will 
turn a blind eye to their own abuses?  Beyond the ISS Lounge Ship 
Enterprise, what about more serious violations?  What if other scouts (the 
PCs) stumble on a group that is involved in grey market smuggling and 
discover that they can profit if they don\'t report them to their 
superiors?  What if they discover that those superiors are the ones 
organizing the smuggling ring?

Well, remember, part of the paranoia is something that I don\'t think TL
advancements are going to change. Namely, the fact that it\'s *very*
hard to protect against morons whho *think* they know what they are
doing. Such people will cheerfully ignoring warning signs, flashing
danger lights, and even tell interactive voice systems that yes, they
really *do* want to dump the atmosphere from cargo bay two (this while
they are *in* cargo bay two!). 

The problem is that the very same functions that a moron will use to
kill people unintentionally are also functions that may be needed to
*save* lives (or property) in an emergency. And short of the sort of AI
Traveller doesn\'t have, you *can\'t* "limit" the controls enough to
prevent this sort of stupid user error.

Or set off some *embarassing* alarm. Say the PC hits the Nav console
and the ship\'s collision alarm goes off.

That\'s a good point.  Anyone want to take a crack at
Vilani-style police organizations?  The underlying
philosophy would probably emphasize mediation and
crime prevention over crime-solving and conviction
rates.

I\'ve heard it called "percussive maintenance" -- not

Ah yes, the barbaric "Tap Test", a time-honored tradition among
engineers, particularly *mechanical* engineers where the tap was
generally administered with a nice heavy wrench. Eventually, passed on
to the general public with the widespread use of consumer
electronics.  

Okay, admit it...how many of you whack the TV/radio/etc with the palm
of your hand to "encourage" the darn thing to work?

I don\'t know about a list, but it could be compiled. 
I think 1 billion adherents in the Imperium is still a
cult, although one large enough to be dangerous.  How
about 1 quadrillion members as the cut-off for
mainstream?

actually fixed it. More frequently than not, when dealing with electronics,
I cajole and / or curse instead of smash.

    'body' => 'As a Marxist and Democratic Socialist, I often find it amusing to see how 
other people treat Marx as some sort of demigod especially by those who have 
only made a cursory reading of his numerous writings.  For Marx, it must be 
remembered was many things and naturally there will be countless 
interpetations of his work.  But, I must laugh at the attempts that make 
East Europe, Russia or China the prime examples of Marx\'s thought put into 
action.  Marx would be the first victim of the gulag as were many Marxists 
in those above mentioned countries - for an economy which which relied on 
state-control and primacy given over to the military industrial complex and 
controlled by a small narrow elite was certainly not Marx or what has been 
termed Classical Marxists had in mind.  For Marx, he foresaw the emergence 
of a society based upon freely-associated producers (by which he meant the 
workers would have a stake in running industry or the economy) coupled with 
a dramatic redistribution of the world\'s net wealth (which he hoped would 
would lead to abolishing one class which was the most numerous in his time 
and ours - the poor thereby making everyone part of the Rich or the 
bourgeoise - fancy french name for the middle class)and prosperous content 
society which would be able to maximize production toward social ends 
(otherwise allow each individual to maximize her or his potential as a human 
being).
    How does this all relate to Traveller.  Traveller like all other 
cultural artifacts is product of the time in which it was made and out of 
the experiences contained therewithin.  RPGs, including Traveller, were 
created in the aftermath of the American defeat in Vietnam.  Many of the 
creators also served a tour of duty in S.E. Asia so for them a society 
ordered around the military or state service was a natural outgrowth (look 
at how CT had 4/5 of the six "careers" to be in the military and even when 
Citizens came around we had flyers & wet navy etc filling the gaps left my 
the Other - the mysterious outsider akin to the hippie experience for many 
growing up in the 1960s).  Soon Traveller developed an Enemy befitting 
America at that time which were the Zhos or the (Sov)iets.  But, reflecting 
the ever changing world around it Traveller by its flexibility absorbed 
other influences around it.  Trade and Commerce the life-blood of capitalism 
or any other society it seems gained in importance.  Even the "Alternative" 
lifestyle found a niche in the form of the career of the Scouts.  The 
mutations into the other forms of Traveller be it MT, TNE, T4, G:T all 
reflect a fundamental anxiety which is at the heart of American or the 
societies of the West. Which has gripped the Western and now the globe since 
1973 oil crises and the resulting paradigm shift that has occurred as 
Capital went global and asserted it\'s independence from the nation-state, 
along with other things such as the failures 1968 which led to the formation 
of New Social Movements, etc. As it was expressed by Gramsci when he said,
	"The crisis consists precisely in the fact the old is dying and the new 
cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms 
appear."

   What that new is?  That is the subject for contestation.  For some it may 
mean good old fashioned values, others it may mean revitalized neocapitalism 
which seeks to dismantle the old welfare state-form and others something 
fundamentally new which goes by the old fashioned name of Socialism (the 
definition of which may be incorporating some of Marx\'s above stated ideals 
in addition to new challenges).  Without exception if Traveller is to 
survive, it will have to coast along these turbulent waters to remain 
credible to all its fans without choosing one side or another but all the 
time tapping into the ziegest of angst of the time.  Marx\'s much vaulted 
Stage theory of History was not his creation rather he was following the 
example of English economic historians, like Marx when he was writing 
Capital, saw that societies appear to be individual but go through similar 
stages of development which may abstracted from actual history.  Marx never 
meant this to serve as a master blueprint for the development of humanity 
but rather as a guide for human action to change the world by observing that 
things are not the same as they have always being therefore humanity has the 
ability to change its order.  Marx sought these changes as Social 
Revolutions.  He reasoned that the extension of the franchaise would allow 
in sufficiently democratic countries such as Britain or the United States 
that Socialism could be achieved through the ballot box.  As a consquence, 
Marx did not forsee the collapse of all government but the transformation of 
the State into one where popular will could be exercised without the 
repression that dominated 19th century and much of the third world today 
exercised by the State and Capital.  Therefore, what one is essentially 
taliing about is a different kind of State which has yet to be realized.
    Traveller canon aknowledges that workers\' governments have formed but 
all fall to into decay and decandence.  Which perhaps is due to American 
perception of the Soviet and Chinese experience.  Following those examples 
one would have to agree that Workers\' control is doomed but remember Marx 
saw that socialism would have to become a global system much as capitalism 
is today for it to be effective.  What we see in China as we saw in the 
Soviet Union earlier, is a capitalist class emerging from a country which 
remained very much feudal despite the presence of rapid industrialization 
protected by the state.  Much as the English genty began the the enclosure 
movement, thus privatization of state industry is going on now in 
"socialist" countries.
   The vision of the Far Future provided by Traveller is sufficiently 
diverse to accomodate real socialism on one world.  But, to believe that the 
3I is going to evolve into a socialist state is highly unlikely. As we see, 
in the official and variant timelines, reformers are cast aside.  Impeutus 
will have to come from those who pull the strings which are too much tied 
into existing power structures to want to change the status quo - an irony 
the same quandry that we find ourselves in today as we enter the next 
century.  One should always remember in the 3I that democracy is a 
subversive word that even those who suggest it in the end perish.  The 
situation resembles France before the Revolution however, there still is 
great deal of fluidity between the classes.  So the better analogy is 
America today.  In short, Traveller is what you make it but its twists and 
turns reflect very much the reality of the times in which it was created.  
It will be interesting to BITS contribution as the British experience of 
combining a "feudal" or inherited wealth-based aristocratic society with a 
dynamic capitalism is long part of the British experience.
    For those interested in further readings of late 20th century American 
culture from a Marxist perspective.  I would recommend books by Frederick 
Jamerson, Mike Davis, and rather dated Michael Harrington for US readers.  
For British, E.P. Thompson and much of what came out the Cultural Studies 
Group in Birningham.  Others, not much as Marxism has long been dominated by 
varying centres of influence be it Moscow or Peking or elsewhere.  But, I 
would wholeheartly recomend independent Yugoslav Marxists(part of the Praxis 
group)such as Branko Horvat or Svetozar Stojanovic\'s:  The Fall of 
Yugoslavia - Why Communism Failed.

From the pages of Walter Benjamin:
...an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is 
fixedly contemplating.  His eyes staring, his mouth open, his wings spread.  
He is the Angel of History.  His face is turned toward the past.  Where we 
can perceive a chain of events, he sees a single catastrophe keeps piling 
wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet.  The Angel would 
like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed.  But, a 
storm is blowing from Paradise; it has caught in his wings with such 
violence that the angel can no longer close them.  The storm irresistibly 
propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the debris 
before him are piled skywards.  This storm we call progress.

One assumes you mean Wyndham Lewis, rather than the infamous Christian C.S.

Strewth !  Does this lead to the odd discussion over jurisdiction ?  If you
include only "traditional" Police Agencies here, we have one per State and
the Federal Police, plus a few other agencies who don\'t have "Powers
Constable".  Nice \'n simple.

Is it possible for list-members from other countries to give a basic run
down of their police agencies for people to use in their TU\'s ?

And before any other Australian pipes up, yes I know there\'re other
agencies out there.  They don\'t, however, carry firearms, nor do they have
the arrest powers the traditional police forces have.

Actually, some US jurisdictions use Commissioner _also_, as a
_civilian_ political appointee who sets overall policy for the
department.  The Chief of Department is in _operational_ control
of implementation.  NYC is one such; all appointments to rank
above Captain are made by the Commissioner.

Just out of curiosity, what _are_ the titles in the British
system?

IIRC, that was also a TNE-centric article, no?

Point taken, from both of you.  In that case, it\'s pretty clear
that the "Sheriff\'s Department" is really the Police Department
with a "funny" name and rank titles.  There will, logically, be a
one-to-one mapping in there somewhere, and I would expect a "real
cop" (i.e., one from a PD that calls itself "Police") to feel
right at home, no real difference.  Note that what I described is
not just NYC and Metro; it\'s statewide, as we have a New York
State Police Department that handles law enforcement
responsibilities for municipalities that do not have their own
department.  In the past two years, the Town of Putnam Valley and
the Town of Cortlandt Manor have abolished their police
departments as more of a financial drain than a help; police
services are now provided by the NYSPD.  But the Sheriffs for
Putnam County and Westchester County, respectively, handle the
kinds of civil enforcement I\'ve described.  True, both are
technically in NYC Metro, but I know some folks in the Finger
Lakes region that say it\'s the same way up there.

FWIW, "Gotham" was a fictionalized NYC, which does indeed have a
Commissioner - Currently, one Howard Safir; previously, William
J. Bratton (yes, the one that made the news).

In addition to NYC, Boston is known to have a Commissioner;
Bratton was Commish there before coming (back) to NYC to take it
here; and Philadephia does indeed have a Commissioner as well,
currently one John Timoney, former Chief of Department, NYPD.  I
believe Chicago does, as well.

Good point. There\'s also the police force of a functional
anarchy: The Free People\'s Vigilance Committee of East Backwash.
One can definitely have fun with different models of law
enforcement; the question to ask is "what\'s going to best further
the adventure?". :)

I\'d suggest that proper tuning of the skills available and the
likelihood of getting them, plus the types and descriptions of
the assignments, can flavor the chargen for any particular need.
Remember, for example, that LBB Book 4 handled both Army and
Marines, and even though there was a lot of overlap (hence
handling them in a single book), they had distinct flavors.

I\'d tend to play it in the other direction - the Imperium will
not get involved in what is clearly a matter of local law
enforcement, unless they are specifically asked to be involved,
and even then, there will be limits to the assistance they will
provide, and often a cost to the requesting world.

I\'d probably make this one \'Non-sentient Assistance Division\';
that would also cover robot handlers and motile vegetation that
perhaps can be found. In many Terran-based traditions, this will
probably still be called \'K-9\'.

>     Air Patrol (may include a Parachute Wilderness Rescue & Recovery Team)

NYC combines these into "Harbor and Aviation"; you might want to
consider "Special Environment Division", dealing with
environments not \'standard\' for a society - for example, a belt
society might need a \'Space\' or \'Zero-Gee\' R&R unit, but won\'t
need a \'Harbor\' unit.

I think you should expand on this, into another article like
what\'s asserted to be mine from \'95, or The Article That Started
This Thread.  Enough different takes on this one concept, and we
may be able to do \'Classic Traveller Book 9 - Police\'.

IMTU, the scout service itself turns an institutional blind eye towards
small scale trafficing in recreational materials, provided the work gets
done, done right, done on time and no-one gets caught or complains.

Then again, IMTU, scout brew also requires certain chemicals barred by the

I understand what you mean, and I was generalising, reading the question on
a more "world specific" Imperium, not as the Imperium per se.  My ideas go
from system to system, even from specific worlds to specific worlds.

However, using the Psi example, I figure that if psionics is illegal
Imperium-wide, and Psi-drugs are illegal within the Imperium, then the mere
possession of said illegal drugs is an offence and punishable if caught...
but that is just "my" take on it and everyone else is free to think
otherwise.  I can\'t see any kind of "positive" control of psionics if you
can possess the drugs anywhere other than on actual worlds unless psionics
do not exist in space travel where the drugs would then be useless?

    The organization of the sheriff\'s department is almost always a choice
made by the elected sheriff and the local county commisioners.  In areas
such as New York, Chicago, and L.A., they tend to be police support
organizations as mentioned elsewhere in this thread.  In largely rural
areas, the sheriff\'s department will be the main police force in the
county and the constables, marshalls, and police of the towns will
usually defer to them.  It\'s still not an uncommon practice for a sheriff to
deputize a town marshall or constable or for a small community to
ask the county sheriff to station a deputy semi-permanently in the
town, thereby directly and formally subordinating local law enforcement
to the county.  Many large countys with full civil service-style sheriff\'s
departments will also include detectives, investigators, and specialist
forensic experts who are not in any way considered deputies, although
they are subordinate to the elected sheriff (or sometimes the county
coroner).

    Actually, U.S. citys sometimes have a Police Comissioner as well,
although
it is a completely different concept from the Police Chief.  A Chief is
usually
a political appointment (although, rarely, it may be a civil service
position)
but is usually, if not almost always, a career police officer who has worked
his way up the system to Captain\'s rank or above.  He handles implementation
of policy and standards and is analagous to a U.S. military Chief of Staff.
A Commissioner, either individually or as a member of a Police
Commission, is always a political appointment and almost never from
within the department.  Instead he is a "civilian" charged with either
making
policy decisions or conducting "outside" investigations of the police
department.  He is more analagous to the U.S. Secretary of Defence, the
"civilian" boss of a para-military organization.  Commisioners will usually
only be found in the largest of cities, however.

Then fire off a letter to SJG and get GURPS space errataed, because that\'s
where I pulled the numbers from. Just a simple thrust/mass=acceleration
calculation.

I can see no reason why a light sail couldn\'t be a high-acceleration
vessel, assuming that the sail was big enough. GS/3 doesn\'t give sizes, but
I suppose you could do a backwards calculation from the thrust and average
solar energy in earth orbit.

Looking at page 21 of "Starsailing" (by Freidman), I see that F=2P/c
(force, power, speed of light). Given that F=ma, then we can derive a=2P/mc
(acceleration, power, mass, speed of light)

The mass of the yacht includes the mass of the sail (check the numbers).
Dividing tons thrust by tons mass should give me the acceleration in
gravities, right?  (I usually work in Newtons and kilograms, not American
units, so may well have made a mistake here.)

In any case, we can calculate teh area of the sail because we know the
force. 145.1 tonnes thrust is 145100 kg times 10 m/s/s (approx), thus
1451000 N. Rearranging the first equation about to get P = Fc/2, I get P =
1,451,000 x 300,000,000 / 2 = 2.2 x 10e14. The Square root of that is about
10e7, so the sail is a square 10000km along a side.

According to GS/3, the sail is 240 square miles per space. I see that I
forgot to multiply the thrust by 0.5 (for the half space) but GS/3 lists
the thrust as 160 tons/space.

I think we\'ve found an errata in GS/3.

A 1-G solar-sail powered craft that is only about 33% (by mass) sail?
Not even remotely plausible with any concievable technology; the formulae
(or your interpretation of them) must be messed up. Could you post the
exact formula from GS/3?

I was once a DJ at an unbelievably small radio station, some of the

SWAT Team Name Generator
(c)1999 by Keith J. Potter

QRT, ESU, GSS, HRT, ETC, etc etc--it seems like every police department
in the US wants their own special operations team, and in the
euphemistically-driven spirit of the times nobody wants to call it a
SWAT
team anymore.  To that end, I offer the following to those Keepers who
find
their PC\'s in a strange city and suddenly forced to call forth police
assistance in the face of some Mythos threat...  Why have the plain old
SWAT
team show up when you can, with just a few rolls of the dice, bring out
a
new and excitingly-named unit such as the Rapid Entry Group, the
Emergency
Tasking Division, or the Situational Equipment Squad!

   Simply roll 1D10 on each of the following tables...  For easy
variations,
simply juggle the word order, or roll more than once (or not at all) on
any
of the tables:

   First Word:
  1. Special
  2. Emergency
  3. Crisis
  4. Quick
  5. Rapid
  6. Standby
  7. Incident(al)
  8. Department(al)
  9. Situation(al)
 10. Tactic(al)

  Second Word:
  1. Equipment
  2. Management
  3. Response
  4. Reaction
  5. Tasking
  6. Support
  7. Services
  8. Entry
  9. Duty
 10. Rescue

 Third Word:
  1. Team
  2. Unit
  3. Squad
  4. Troop
  5. Division
  6. Column
  7. Crew
  8. Force
  9. Group
 10. Posse

   Gotta go now...  The Tactical Rescue Posse just took the front door
off
its hinges...

Doh! I should be shot for forgetting him! I was just going off Jeff\'s comments,

Wasn\'t "The Commish" set in the suburbs? Different jurisdiction from the city

Oh well, just another example to prove that you can make cops IYTU as diverse as
you please...

Precisely my point! I said:

(To be honest, I used Brit/Oz notation because Jeff\'s "Lieutenant" and "Captain"
was too US-based for me. Presumably the reverse is also true. ;-)  I didn\'t have
time or inclination to create alternate naming systems, just creating the one
chargen system was hard enough!)

My suggestion is to use more than one generation system (if you\'re keen enough)
to create the various NPC police you may need in your campaign. At the same
time, another method you can use is to create NPCs from different branches, and
simply substitute an alternate rank table.

OK, so would people now like to come up with a few alternates for E1-E7 and
O1-O7?

Hum, well as I understand it, C. S. Lewis was an atheist as a young
man.  Then well into adulthood, and after a long spiritual journey
he had a Christian conversion.  I suppose you could say he became
something of an infamous Christian.

"Surprised By Joy" is C. S. Lewis\' autobiography.  Within it he
charts his spiritual journey, describing it as a search for joy.

Well, you do have to remember that it had been a "serious" thread up

Never. But I owned one of the *infamous* Seagate ST-251 40 meg drives
with "stiction" for many years. Since I rarely turned the system off,
it wasn\'t much of a problem. But if I *did* turn it off, I had to
unbolt the drive and give it a quick, *hard* tist to break the heads
free. then quickly rebolt the drive and apply power.

Right. now stop and consider this. 2.2e14 m^2 for sail area. If that
sail weighs a *miilgram* per square meter, that makes it mass 2.2e11
kg. or 2.2e8 *tons*. That sail with a 145.1 tonne thrust masses 220
*million* tonnes. 145.1/220e6 = 660 one-billionths of a g accel.

Major league. Alo note my figures above regarding the *mass* of the
sail as it relates to area.

And nukes, as terrorists *will* be able to get them, given how "common"
the missile rules require them to be. :-)

Also, here\'s a lovely thought. Just imagaine what a bunch of terrorists
with a nuclear damper could do. Set it to speed up decay and aim it at
those nice granite government buildings.

360 mi^2 = ~932 km^2

And it looks like your table makes the mass 68.0 (tonnes?). 

Which gives the sails a mass of ~73 *micrograms*/m^2. Yeesh!

217.7 tonnes thrust?

That gives ~233 micrograms of thrust per m^2.

times 9.8 should give us Newtons. 2.29e-3 N/m^2

Therefore:

P=F*c/2

P= 2.29e-3*3.8/2
P= 343e3 W

That\'s 343 kW/m^2!

Sheesh! Solar flux at 1 AU is abou *1* kW/m^2

My isiters and I used to pull a similar prank on our friends. My 
parents have a fine assortment of citrus trees, including mandarins and 
limes. One of the lime trees produces orange limes that are very 
similar in appearance to a mandarin fruit (the only difference is a 
point on the bottom of the lime). We\'d mix a few limes in with the 
mandarins when our freinds came round...

However this doesn\'t (unless your acupuncturist (?) is a whole lot 
better than the one I tried) help much with hayfever. For that 
antihistamines or, more recently, steriods are the way to go.

22.7 tonnes for 2.2 x 10e14 m^2

is about
	10e-13 tonne/m^2
	10e-10 kg/m^2

make it out of something with a density about that of water (1000 kg/m^3)

thickness

	10e-10 / 10e3 m

	10e-13 m

that\'s not a lot. Now compare to a carbon atom. its "diameter" is

	1.5e-10 m

Houston, we have a problem!


Unless someone spots the error, I think your sail needs to weigh at least
20,000 tonnes.

If you want an odd situation, look at the Sheriff of San Francisco County.
SF County and the City have the exact same borders.. water on three sides
and Daly City/San Mateo County to the south.  So there isn\'t any of the
traditional unincorporated areas for the Sheriff to patrol.

This has left the Sheriff\'s Department mostly in charge of the jails.
Still, Mike Hennesy remains a fairly powerful figure in local politics.

Current evidence-based treatment for sinusitis :-
- - a non-sedating antihistamine (e.g. loratidine) ;
- - a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (e.g. paracetamol/acetaminophen
or ibuprofen) ; and
- - don\'t blow your nose - recent experiments suggest that this merely
inoculates the sinuses with the causative virii/whatever.
(You can generate pressures in excess of 200mmHg when nose-blowing ;
this is not to be sneezed or coughed at!).

Steroids for sinusitis are a bit of overkill, but they would work.

Acupuncture is good for migraines and tension headaches and some
analgesia, but there is no evidence of benefit for sinusitis.

Ditto for ascorbic acid.

Maintaining adequate hydration is a great general symptomatic relief
measure for a variety of problems.

Remember that you\'d have to ramp up decay rates by a factor of at least
a million times to get a significant radiation release (so the occupants
would warm a little as their K-40 decayed, though not as much as when
the walls got \'hot\').
	Although I\'d rather build with gravitic-modulated buckminsterfullerene
or a variety of superdense than granite if I wanted a building to *last*
and look impressive at those sort of tech levels.

Any significant installation would be damper screened to prevent \'fun
with nukes/nuke dampers\' in any case - because nukes are so common.

The ambit of the bomb squad really includes NBC warfare at typical Trav
levels (or perhaps the relevant military services could be summoned).

I generally try to stay out of this type of thread; however, I
really must protest.  The New Testement is one of the
most studied books ever and is the best authenticated
document in the history of man.  The last portion of the
New Testement (commonly called the Revelation of St.
John), was probably written before 70 AD (less than 40
years after the death of Yeshua (Jesus).

There is a complete manuscript of the New Testement
that dates back to c. 100 AD.  It contains the same 27
books that are in the modern "canon."  While it is true
that there is some dispute over certain "additions/
deletions" in some of the ancient manuscripts, it is also
true that none of those disputed passages are the only
place where the things added/deleted are included.  If all
of the disputed passages were deleted, nothing would
change.  If all of them were included, again, nothing
would change.

Oops! I seem to have caught a dose of the \'constant inflation\' that has
appeared on the list.

If we posit a whole body dose of 100 rem as that which will cause acute
radiation sickness in 50% of humans, then decay rates need to be
increased by between 1000 to 10000 times. Granite would tend to contain
more of the relevant isotopes, so would require less acceleration.

C.S. Lewis was a "famous" Christian apologist, but he reached that
distinction after being the infamous and outspoken atheist who made it his
life\'s goal to discredit and disprove the existence of God.  That is why his
autobiography is titled "Surprised by Joy".  He was one of the early
expositors of the humanist idea that getting rid of theism would greatly
improve the human condition.  He found that quite the opposite was true...
I\'d better stop before I spoil the read ;-)

Hmm, I have a TV set which fails to properly tune in the channel while

Not officially.  Best bet might be Jewell; the UWP codes aren\'t changed, but
that doesn\'t mean they\'re correct.  Jewell is also big enough to have more
than one starport, so maybe only one of the ports in a landing zone suffered
that much damage. 

Arguments in favor: we know Jewell suffered a prolonged siege by Zhodani
forces; I\'d have to look at SMC, but I recall at least two episodes of
landing operations.  The first was pushed off, and the second on another
continent was apparently more successful, if I remember right.  In any
case, Jewell never fell completely.

Actually, in most cases, not at all. Interagency cooperation (teevee
reality notwithstanding) is generally quite good, and as a rule
practiced pretty effectively, at least here, where it\'s possible to have
all of those agencies working at the same time. They tend to have fairly
distinct jurisdictions, eithere de jure or de facto. (Foex, technically
speaking, the Pima Co. Sheriffs department has jurisdiction over the
entire county, including Tucscon. Practically, though, the only time you
see a Sheriff\'s vehicle in town is either them going to and from court,
or commuting to work in their county issued cars. (A lot of deputies
pretty much work entirely out of their cars, depending on their patrol
area,  and where they live. A buddy of mine used to make it into his
station house only about once every two or three days...he lived about
25 miles away, and his patrol are was even farther away in the same
direction.)

There are also a number of interagency task forces here, particularly
between the Sheriff\'s Dept and PD.

I think you got the weight wrong -- a one-space sail module is 50T, 50 MCr, 160T thrust.  I think GURPS Space may have also gotten it wrong, it has 240x the thrust of a similar module designed with VE2.

Actually, it does give a size, and requires an energy density of 400 kW/m^2 to reach the listed acceleration.

Engineering is an exercise in constrained optimization, with the constraints

does not vary significantly across the Traveller universe, so with the same
laws of physics we should not be too surprised to find similar (note that I

We should expect to find greatly different man-machine interfaces, however,
since the interface will reflect a particular race\'s way of processing

find a Vargr manuever drive fairly incomprehensible even though it performs

The only situation in which you will have competing technologies like that is when there are two or more technologies which are roughly equal, or which one or another group is philosophically opposed to using.  In many cases, the \'standard\' systems are just plain _better_ than any competing technology.

Without question the bible is a significant document. Three of the worlds
most pervasive religions are based upon (parts) of it. It\'s contents and the
interpretations of its contents have dominated first western, and then world
history for at least 1800 years.  Anyone who could persuasively refute the
contents would instantly become both a pariah and potentially incredibly
wealthy (based on magazine, book and movie deals), and possibly hunted as
well. (Some of our Right Wing Christian and Islamic brethren don\'t always
play nice when their beliefs are threatened.)

The fact is that many scholars who study the bible are not of a religious
bent. It has simply had too great an effect on the development of western
culture to not be studied.  Any study based on sound scientific principles
(as practiced in historical, archeological and anthropological disciplines)
will be taken seriously by all true biblical scholars. (Of course they won\'t
agree on the researchers results, interpretations, or conclusions, why
should they be different from any other field :))

Steroids?  They can weaken the male sex drive; personally, I\'d prefer to
sneeze.  

Moving to the San Francisco area improved my hay fever far more than any
treatment, and I\'ve done many of them -- nasalide, scratch test/allergy
shots, seldane, non-prescription antihistamines, and the three I
mentioned above.  I think that there are just fewer plants to which I\'m
allergic here.  (I didn\'t start acupuncture, etc., until I moved here,
so I don\'t know if that regimen would have been as effective in the
Rocky Mountain states where I had the worst problems.)

Ob Traveller:  Organisms (not just humans, or just sophonts) can be
allergic to a lot of things.  Maybe some mold is growing in some part of
the atmospheric control system of the ship, high port, or sealed city. 
Not everyone or everything is affected.  Maybe the livestock in the hold
are suffering and losing value, or maybe suddenly everyone aboard ship
except the Aslan is incapacitated by violent respiratory convulsions. 
Maybe one PC has it really bad for a few days aboard ship after visiting
a high port; it goes away; they visit that high port again; and a few
days later he\'s blind and sneezing blood again.  It could take a while
to put 1 + 1 together.

This is something I have concitered at times as well. If you look even at
earth\'s history and at the "technological" diversity that some isolated
cultures derive, you do come up with "commom denominators" when it comes to
tasks.

As for any species approach to space travel, there are common denominators
to conciter:

Power Plants: Although the technique may be different, in a traveller
universe, there is one fuel above all else that will eventually get looked
at - Hydrogen - and thus one type of power plant will get developed -
Fusion. Pre fusion technology may end up being very different between any
two species, so this could get fairly diverse. ("Hey Pete, what do we do
with all these cow droppings?" -- "Toss them in the converter, we have to
get to orbit somehow!")

Control System: Our human concept of silicon/optic crystal computational
systems may or may not be developed by an alien species. Here is where the
most diversity would be found. Organic neural networks could be developed
easier by one species than we could, and some may actually develop life
forms to act as computer cores. In traveller terms, however, it\'s the
rating that counts, not the material. IYTU, a computer of a given number
may or may not need be silicon based.

Thrust: Here is where the most thinking can come to play. The laws of
physics will be your guide. It\'s logical that rockets of some kind, solar
sails, and subatomic thruster units are technologies that any space-faring
civilization must develop along with (in the traveller universe) jump
drives. It is the construction techniques that will be the real diversity.
I can imagine some very beautiful architecture going into solar sail
construction.

Hulls: It\'s got to be strong, it\'s got to be airtight, and it has to resist
outside radiation. Thus the material used must be able to form hulls that
fit the above rules. If you can get a type of wood to do that, then you
have a race that can use wooden hulls. Translate it into traveller
compatable hull ratings for YTU and have fun with your players reaction to it.

As far as weapons, you may run into races that have different ideas on
weapons. Some may never arm ships, some may arm ships with weapons no one
has seen before. Here is where you, as a GM, have freedom. If it fits you
traveller universe, open fire. Just make sure it\'s something you would want
your players to get their hands on. If you know one of your players would
use this weapon to get his backside seated on the Iridium throne, don\'t use
it (unless you want him to be Emperor or get him killed trying).

Just my thoughts :)

In the UK we have a number  of  county  and  metropolitan  police
forces who all cooperate with each other fairly well, and who use
a central crime database  called  the  Police  National  Computer
(enquiries to which are called PNC checks).  Within these  police
forces there are various specialised units  ...  Special  Branch,
T-Branch (anti-terrorist), the  Vice  Squad,  the  infamous  West
Midlands Serious Crime  squad,  the  Serious  Fraud  Office,  the
Complaints Investigation Branch, Criminal Investigation Division,
the Transport Police (for railways), etc.  In addition  there  is
Customs & Excise ... mostly visible at seaports and airports, but
able to pursue investigations anywhere in the  country.  Finally,
since the end (?) of the cold war MI5  (counterintelligence)  has
been trying to  gain  responsibility  for  counter-terrorism  and
anti-drugs (hoping to justify no  budget  cuts  for  itself).  In
general patrolling officers are unarmed.  Less well known is that
rail ticket inspectors (or the "Revenue Protection  Squad")  have
the powers to  formally  *arrest*  someone  travelling  by  train
without a valid ticket, although they usually just  give  out  an
on-the-spot fine.

IMTU I have different local police structures for each planet ...
with different rank titles.  A senior detective on one planet may
be a Constable, on another an Investigator,  on  yet  another  an
Arbiter, or even a Sherrif, and so on.  On some planets  suspects
are  considered  "innocent  until  proven  guilty",  others  have
innocent / guilty / not proven.  Basically,  no  standardisation.
Interstellar crimes fall under the jurisdiction of the  MOJ  (and
also the Imp Navy and IISS in the  case  of  piracy).  And  where
local criminals move to another planet the MOJ act like  INTERPOL
and coordinate different planet\'s local police forces.

I agree, but we also know that many roads can get you to the same
destination.  ForEx. look at the many different types of power generation
plants in the world.  Gas, coal, nuke, solar, wind, etc... they are all
optimized (the best they can be at existing technology) for their function.
However they all still provide power.  That doesn\'t answer my question of
how the different races all developed the same solution to the engineering
problem produced by space travel.

Back to this...

Actually, they all look like Solomani ships - that\'s where they
copied the jump drive from, they probably copied the maneuver
drive (which the Terrans copied from the Vilani) and so on.

> Hivers: Grown ships (like the pentapods (sp) from T2300)

Hm, early Hiver ships probably looked semi-different (although
as another poster pointed out, their laws of physics are the
same as ours and there are a limited number of "optimal"
designs for ship hulls, etc).

Once the Hivers "invented" regular jump drive and stopped using
the "inferior" version that they really invented, they probably
started using standard thrusters, power plants, etc.

> Others?

All the same too. The Vilani discouraged regionalism during
their rule(s), thus forcing out local & regional technologies
in favour of "standard Vilani" designs.
 
Have I posted this lately? Stop me if you\'ve heard this one before...

Grandfather invented the jump drive, the gravitic maneuver/thruster
drive and probably perfected the catalyzed fusion plant before 
moving on the antimatter power generation and dimensional gates.

In the process of seeding humaniti far and wide and visiting the
homeworlds of the various non-human "major" races, he (or his
children) left behind samples in the from of semi-broken or abandoned
ships. Most of the "major" races made a decent push into their
near space (the Vilani and Hivers being the most successful, followed
by the K\'kree, then down to the real copycats, like the Solomani,
Zhodani, Aslan and Vargr) during which time they lucked upon a
derelict Ancient ship which they proceeded to copy with impunity.
(without impunity?)

The Vilani, Hivers and K\'ree all get extra credit though. The Vilani
colonized several worlds via sub-light generation ships before 
discovering jump. The Hivers actually invented the darn thing themselves,
perhaps proving them the smartest race in the galaxy, but droped their
own version, which was inferior to the real thing. The K\'kree
seem to have discovered gravitics independently in their quest to wipe
out the race inhabiting their nearby moon or planet (I forget which
it was). 

The only race to ever have been "caught in the act" are the Genoee,
who were originally considered a "major" human race during the early
Vilani period, until the Vilani also discovered the ship the Genoee
had copied. Having copied jump drive instead of "inventing" it reduced
the Genoee to a mere "minor" race in the Vilani taxonomy (and of course,
at the time, the Vilani were the only "major" race).

Whether the discovery of the Ancient derelict ships was covered up
on purpose by the "race at large" or whether the "inventors" of
the jump drive simply wanted all the fame and fortune is unclear
and probably unprovable one way or another.

Scotland Yard *was* the address of the original headquarters  for
the London Metropolitan Police (the "Met").  Some  time  ago  the
Met relocated to an office tower block called New  Scotland  Yard
(it had its name on a revolving silver(ish)  triangluar  sign  at
the base of the tower).  During the last  year  the  local  press
have dropped the "New" from the name  so  I  don\'t  know  if  the
original Scotland Yard still exists.

In Ground Forces I\'m using Jewell as one of my "sidebar worlds".. examples
of what TL 12 combat feels like on the ground from the grunt\'s point of
view.  So it would be a good candidate.

for all of the races to yield only one viable solution.

I think a good example is the construction of nuclear weapons. Imagine
different cultures developing nuclear weapons without the ability to spy on

be amazingly similar in construction. Same problem, same physics, same

Two problems here:

- - First, the resource availability (mineral and otherwise) varies
  from planet to planet which will affect the economics of  using
  different technologies.  (eg. A lack of local radioactivies may
  mean  fission  reactors  are  economically  unviable,   leading
  instead to a dependance on solar power, etc.)

- - Second, for isolated worlds (outside the 3I or similar)  it  is
  possible to progress to medium TL without fully  exploring  all
  technologies technically feasable to low TL.  (eg. Romans  with
  SMGs)

Okay, high TL multi-world empires would move  towards  technology
homogeny so the 3I and Zhos whould be similar, but below that ...

Seriously though, I don\'t like that idea very much. It was bad enough
remembering that a K\'Kree stateroom is 25Td, and a Droyn SR holds 2, etc.
The basic technologies of space travel are unlikely to be as varied as you
suggest; effective travel requires certain key functions, best provided by
the stadard tech.

through the atmosphere and the concussion was enough to 
penetrate the crust and break the planet up from inside.

Well, here is a 6 cf, Radically Streamlined, Highly Armored Dead-

slow it down for reentry so aerobraking is not necessary.  You just 
drop it from orbit and when it hits, it does massive amounts of 
damage (5dx2000 (2) ... more than a 0.0001 kiloton MicroNuke and 
almost as much as a 0.001 kiloton).

I will try to list all locations where I found appropriate rules.

17402 lbs of thrust from gravity. VE2/157, Falling.
Terminal Velocity in conjunction with the Reactionless Thruster 
(which is the top speed) is 15780 mph. VE2/157, Falling

According to VE2/164, Space-to-Ground Capability, a vehicle must 
decelerate by (orbital velocity - top air speed) / 1500 minutes before 
it can enter the atmosphere.  Earth\'s is 17800 so this missile must 
decelerate for 1.3 minutes if it were aerobraking.  As it is not (it shall 
use its Reactionless thruster), we don\'t have to worry about that.

According to VE2/164, Space-to-Ground Capability, the vehicle is 
approximately 15,000 miles up when it enters the atmosphere.

According to VE2/157, Falling, a vehicles gains 20 mph per second 
until terminal velocity is reached.  Well, we are already at terminal 
velocity so we don\'t have to worry about that, either.

We now have a 8.7 sTon hunk of metal screaming throught the 
atmosphere at Mach 21 (more in the upper reaches of the 
atmosphere).

According to VE2/159, Hitting Buildings and Immovable Obstacles 
(I assume the planet should suffice for this definition), we use the 
TBone Collision rule from VE2/158 which directs us to the top of 
the page.  Effectively : (120 (the HPs) x 15780) / 200 Dice of

Lets round to 10,000 and we have 5dx2000(2) points of damage.  
That\'s 70,000 average points of damage.  A standard missile only 
does 16,800 average points of damage (assuming the armor 
divisor of 10).

Of course, this missile is a lot heavier and a twice as expensive as 
the standard, but considering you don\'t have to worry about 
guidance or targeting, just drop and forget, you could lay thousands 
of these in an upper atmosphere and wreak all kinds of havoc.  And 
most important of all, it works with the standard missile launchers!

It\'s mainly because the wonder technologies of Traveller (contra-gravity,
reactionless thrusters and small fusion power plants specifically) eliminate
any and all competition. They are also cheap enough to be really pervasive
in the Third Imperium setting.

Personally, I\'m in the same boat as you. It becomes a real problem when
you\'re designing ships and vehicles because there\'s no reason not to use
those technologies. As a result, two ships of the exact same size built by
different cultures will tend to be, at least functionally, *exactly* the
same. That may work for other people, but it doesn\'t for me. What\'s the
point of visiting strange new worlds and civilizations if they\'re all going
to be exactly the same?

Subject: Deadfall Ordnance


With the discussion of Dead-Fall Ordnance going on on the
GT:Navy playtest group, I got to thinking about Babylon 5 and the
weapons that the Shadows (or was it the Vorlons ...) used to kill
planets.  They simply dropped large chunks of streamlined metal
through the atmosphere and the concussion was enough to
penetrate the crust and break the planet up from inside.

Well, here is a 6 cf, Radically Streamlined, Highly Armored Dead-
Fall missile.  It has limited manuevering capability, just enough to
slow it down for reentry so aerobraking is not necessary.  You just
drop it from orbit and when it hits, it does massive amounts of
damage (5dx2000 (2) ... more than a 0.0001 kiloton MicroNuke and
almost as much as a 0.001 kiloton).

It *is* the Turkish word for lion, which is where Lewis got it from.

What we (on the TML) thought was that Marc (or J Andrew Keith - BTW, who wrote
"Contact! The Aslan" anyway??) either (a) knows Turkish and therefore used the
same source, or (b) knew the Narnia books and took it from there.

What we (on the TML) concluded as an ObTravRef was that the first humans who met
the Aslan were of Turkish descent!!

	Just my Cr 0.02: There are differences in power generating
	plants around Terra, but most of these are either minor
	variations on the same technology, or based on resources
	that vary considerably in availability.  It could also be
	argued that TL differences contribute.  Nevertheless, how
	many different kinds of cars are there?  Sure, they may
	look different (actually, they mostly all look the same to
	me), and a mechanic might take a while figuring out the
	details of some foreign cars, but almost all of them use
	metal frames, rubber tires, and internal combustion
	engines.  That despite the wide range in environments in
	which these vehicles must operate.

	An interstellar civilization is, IMHO, unlikely
	to have drastically different resources available than 
	another such civilization.  There are probably many
	minor variations on power plant design, but I expect that
	even in the Imperium.  Heavier, more reliable designs
	might be popular for stations/planetside; light, low-power
	designs for mobile bases; light, expensive, high-power
	designs for starships, etc.  I could see some races putting
	more emphasis on reliability and having heavier power plants,
	but they would probably still be fusion plants and probably
	not unlike some models that would be familiar to an Imperial
	engineer.

Don\'t know about the setting for the show, but in the NYC Metro
Area, each municipality has its own PD, separate from NYC proper.
In Detroit, there seems to be a slightly different arrangement,
based on my understanding of the post that described that area,
and I suspect that Los Angeles is Yet Another Model.

In addition, don\'t overlook the fact that there may be
_overlapping_ jurisdictions with multiple departments, and not
just city-contained-in-state-type of overlap - going back to NYC,
we have the following:

New York City Police Department: Jurisdiction within the legally
defined boundaries of the incorporated City of New York

New York State Parks Police: Jurisdiction within all State Parks,
including those within NYC.

MTA Railroad Police: Jurisdiction on the property of the
railroads operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority
(of NY State) - Metro-North Commuter Railroad and Long Island
Railroad.

New York City Sanitation Police: Jurisdiction over waste-disposal
violations within the legally defined boundaries of the
incorporated City of New York.

New York City Environmental Police: Jurisdiction over New York
City watershed and water supply protection.  This includes over
the reservoirs upstate that serve the City.

Up until a couple of years ago, there was also:

New York City Housing Police Department: Jurisdiction within
housing projects owned or operated by the City of New York.

New York City Transit Police Department: Jurisdiction within the
New York City public transportation system (busses, subways, and
Staten Island Rapid Transit).

Both of the latter agencies were merged into the NYCPD a couple
of years ago.

Yes - but I sort of figured that a \'nuke\' would be explosive, and

First off, my earlier post with equations is wrong. Never to math on an
empty stomach, after an 18-hour day. :-/

The problem is with GS3/e, I think.

A light sail module takes up one space. At GTL8 it has an area of 15 sq
miles, at GTL9+ an area of 240 sq miles.  It provides 10 tons of thrust at
GTL8, 160 tons of thrust at GTL9+.  Mass is 50 tons at all tech levels.

Another try at the equations:

Force = 2 x Power / lightspeed		NOTE: assumes a perfect reflector

The solar power constant for Earth (the baseline GS3/e uses) is 1400 Watts
per square metre. Assuming a square mile (1600 m x 1600 m) the equation
becomes:

Force = 2 x 1600 x 1600 x 1400 / 300,000,000

This will be in Newtons per square mile.

(Please check the next bit for boneheaded math error, because I hate
conversions and aren\'t that good at them.)

To convert Newtons to tonnes-force, I used F=ma where m=1000kg and
a=9.81m/s/s, to get:

1 tonne-force = 981 N

Thus:

Force = (2 x 1600 x 1600 x 1400) / (300,000,000 x 981)

Finally, there are 0.907 tonnes in a ton, therefore I get:

Force = (2 x 1600 x 1600 x 1400) / (300,000,000 x 981 x 0.907)	NOTE: in
tons/sq mile

Crunching the numbers (I kept them whole to avoid dumb transcription
errors), this is:

Force = .02685347213 tons/square mile.

Thus, for the 15 square mile sail I get 0.4 tons thrust, while for the 240
square mile sail I get 6.4 tons.

Have I made any boneheaded mistakes? Please let me know, so I ccan update
GT Shipyard to create realistic lightsails.

True, I was ignoring that. I suppose that as a lower limit on mass we could
assume a sheet a single molecule thick, and see what that gives for mass.
If it\'s reasonable, then I think we could handwave some form of "molecular
bonding" to get the material at upper-end tech levels. Of course, the first
cloud of thin gas and your sail would be ruined...  If even a single
molecule sheet is too massive, then we\'ve established a definative
\'impossible\'.

(As a matter of principle, I dislike the word "impossible" when applied to
engineering.)

Actually, I got the thrust wrong. I decided to code with half-size sails,
so I could have an integer number of modules. I added a listing of sail
area to alert people (not that these will be big items).

Yeah, I found that the next time I opened the book.

Still, we\'ve definately discovered an errata for GS3/e.  I suggest claiming

Note that in GVE2 the thrust is 5.26 lb/square mile (9e-6 newtons/square meter) or 0.63 tons for the above sail.  Assuming a solar flux of 1,400 watts/square meter the actual value is 9.3e-6 newtons/m^2, which is reasonable enough.

Bear in mind that we\'re talking US tons, not tonnes, and thus, it is 8900 newtons/ton.

Factor of 10 error in newtons/ton.  Also, note:
A 1-space (50T) sail is 250 square miles with GVE2.  Thrust is 0.66T.  Maximum area is 360,000 square miles (1440 modules).
A 1-space (490T) TL-8 sail is 15 square miles with a thrust of 0.038T (it has marginally lower thrust); maximum area is 3,600 square miles (240 modules)

Bribery is knowing who to bribe, how to pass it along, and what levels of
squeeze are needed for any given situation.  It differs slightly from
Streetwise in that many "legitimate" citizens might by in a situation where
bribery becomes a part of daily life.  (Anybody here every get pulled over
by the Sonora State Police?  A US $10 bill, discreetly passed, and suddenly
the officer forgets he ever saw you or your car.)

People who work in heavily mob-controlled industries, for example, might
have high levels of Bribery to know how much of a kick back the family
gets, and how to launder it.

Ah, the perils of television.. every summer San Francisco gets planeloads
of tourist in shorts and t-shirts, who proceed to develop hypothermia while
waiting for cable cars.

Y\'see they\'ve seen "Baywatch", which is filmed in California, so they know
what the weather is going to be like...

Here in NZ there\'s a pharmacy only (until recently prescription only) 
nasal spray that my doctor told me was a steriod (shortly before 
spending five minutes reassuring me that it wasn\'t like all those 
"evil" steriods). It\'s called Beconase and seems to have Beclomethasone 
Dipropionate as its active component.

Well, yes and no. The same idea may be at work with nuclear plants and coal

I know you said "almost all", but if you head up north where there\'s a good
deal of snow and you\'ll find lots of vehicles which use a combination of
skies and treads, not rubber tires. These vehicles fill the same role as
cars, but they\'re not cars.

To go a step further than that even, Buckminster Fuller designed the
Dymaxion (sp?), a three-wheeled car that was quantifiably better than most
cars of the time, but an unfortunate accident caused funding to dry up.
While the Dymaxion was not radical in the sense that the difference between,
say, using solar power on a starship and using fusion power would be, it\'s
still a design which is different enough to be notable.

To stick with automobiles as an example, even with very similar technology,
cars themselves can come in a variety of different shapes and sizes.
Sometimes, as with the popularity of compact and sub-compact cars, the
change is a result of *function*, while at other times the change is purely
a result of aesthetics. Take a look at the rise in popularity of the SUV
among America\'s "soccer moms".

To further complicate issues, you\'ve got things like motorcycles on the
roads as well, which look and feel very different from automobiles. If
everybody in America started to drive motorcycles, for whatever reason, the
country would look and feel quite different.

So, even using the same core technology, you can have any number of
permutations which, in most cases, are functionally different in a
quantifiable way.

These are above and beyond *mere* differences in tech levels.

One thing that\'s interesting, which nobody has mentioned yet, which is not
surprising given the rational and optimization-happy nature of this list, is
that something which may be functionally and quantifiably better may be, for
whatever reason, unpopular, or the idea might not catch on. Look at the
Betamax / VHS brawl, as an example, or look at the story of the Tucker car,
or even the military vehicle that Tucker and his team designed for the U. S.
Army. Laserdiscs are another good example. Let\'s see... what else? Ah! Fax
machines owe their popularity in the 80s and 90s not to their being "better"
than other forms of technology, an email system has many advantages over the
fax machine, but to the fact that Japanese executives conduct their business
in a specific fashion, and the Japanese both make and consume lots of
electronics.

So, even on a single planet it\'s quite possible to have many different
approaches to a problem. People\'s priorities can also be very different.
While many on this list may lean toward optimization, most people *don\'t*.
Tradition and industrial inertia are very powerful forces, even for those of
us who aren\'t Vilani.

In some cases, even very brilliant people can\'t think far enough "outside
the box" to see that there may be a different way of doing something. The
rise in popularity of "alternative medicines" in the West is a good example.
Acupuncture, which just came up on the list in another discussion, is quite
different from other methods of dealing with certain medical problems.
Similarly, the difference between the therapy dominated field of psychology
and the empirical approach of psychiatry are really very different.

I could go on and on, but I think that I\'ve made my point. ;)

Streetwise would tell you to pass a $10 to the cop. 

Bribery would tell you that it\'s ok for a Sonora Federale, but NOT a
CHiP. 

Bribery is knowing the fine details of how much and the particulars of
bribing someone, as Doug says. 

Foex, offering too much will generate differing responses. 

Will the bribee:

a) assume you don\'t know what you\'re doing and pocket it anyway 

b) take the usual and politely give the rest back (don\'t laugh, an old
National Geographic article on Bombay described that exact thing) 

or c) assume you\'re up to something much worse, that they should be much
more suspicious of.

Streetwise will tell you to walk into a congresscritters office with a
briefcase of cash. 

Bribery will tell you to walk in with an appropriately laundered check
made out to his re-election committee, or better yet, his favorite
PAC...

Streetwise leans heavily towards the folded ten in the palm. 

Bribery is a delicately dropped insider tip.

Bribery, at it\'s best, and as a skill, consists of the art of paying
someone off while simultaneouosly offering them plausible deniability.

Ha! one of my Japanese teachers (loooong time ago, I hardly remember any
of it) was from Japan. Her father was initially concerned about her
coming to Tucson because it was a dusty cow town with daily gunfights
and Indian raids...

Wasn\'t it Mark Twain who said \'The coldest winter I ever saw was a
summer in San Francisco.\' ? I know, we still have the thick sweaters we
ran out and bought the first time we went there...

Yes. Actually that stuff works pretty well, I\'m taking it, since the
generic companies can make it now, and the HMO\'s think it\'s just peachy
keen to prescribe because it\'s cheap.

N.B. Steroids are a VAST array of compounds sharing a common base
chemical structure, with hugely varying pharmacological effects.

Only a tiny fraction of them have _any_ effect on the male sex drive.

It\'s on the order of syaing \'hydrocarbon\' == \'gasoline\'; whether it\'s
methane or coal.

It\'s all in the side chains, folks, all in the side chains.

I would hope so!  35,000 (2) points of damage is nothing to sneeze 
at.  That\'s enough to take out a 20,000 dTon ship with 30,000 points 
of DR.

Drop a couple hundred of these over a ground-based starport and I 
don\'t think there would be too many ships left.

But, you are right.  I am not sure it bust up the planet.  You would 
probably need a 10 cf one for that ;)

The problem is that Fusion is simply better than any sort of power
generation system which does not involve antimatter or other highly
exotic, *very* high TL solutions.  Fusion power uses easily available fuel
(hydrogen) and generates a huge amount of power for a small amount of fuel
(and in a relatively small space in Traveller). Nothing else works nearly
as well. 

The case for Thrusters is even better.  Fission drives, solar sails, and
most other solutions are honestly fairly pitiful for getting around a
solar system in anything resembling a reasonable amount of time. 

Fusion rockets & Heplar both work OK, but are incredibly inferior to
Thrusters, since they require considerable amounts of fuel or reaction
mass and thrusters do not.  Thrusters are the only way you can do 1 G
continuous thrust boosts from one planet to another.  With that sort of
advantage everyone who came across such things would drop their existing
technologies and adopt thrusters as soon as they could buy or duplicate
them. 

Some technologies are simply better.

Here\'s the only problem with your analysis, and why I didn\'t go this route.

Armor and framework don\'t have any volume in GURPS Vehicles. This is an
abstraction, to avoid iterative volume calculations. It works okay for
hulls that are thin relative to their volume, but it breaks down pretty
rapidly if you push it too far.

In this case, you have to consider the volume of all that steel. Say that
steel has a density of 8 g/cc (I don\'t have CRC to consult, so don\'t take
this literally). Your armor and framework together would take up 35 cf, on
top of the 6 cf of contents -- which throws off your drag and airspeed
calculations, and prevents the missile from using standard launchers.

Well, I thought that the three-hour Mandatory
Continuing Legal Education (MCLE) workshop I recently
attended on Bribing Public Officials was extremely
helpful, and I\'m looking forward to the follow-up,
Successful Solicitation of Bribes, this winter.  (The
MCLE folks are also planning "Defending the Briber",
"Defending the Bribe-taker", and "Soliciting Bribes
for Declining to Prosecute Bribery Cases".)  

Unfortunately, I don\'t have any more constructive
comments at the moment.  What makes a skill for
Traveller, anyway?  It\'s a thorny question.

That is when the engineers can get their units right. ;)

Then again, anyone who thinks that engineers build solely with optimization
in mind need only look at the American automobile industry during the 70s,
or any one of a thousand different examples.

TNE Rules: Law Enforcer Characters
By: Jeff Zeitlin <jeff.zeitlin@execnet.com>
From: traveller@mpgn.com Tue, 04 Jul 95 [Digest 338]

Subject: TNE Law Enf. Career

I was looking through the Traveller: The New Era character generation sequence,
and decided, based on my personal real-world experience, that the Law
Enforcement career could be improved somewhat.

For the record, I live in a small town (about 15,000 people) and work for the
New York City Police Department (about 40,000 uniformed members of all ranks,
serving a city of 12,000,000 people). I have made it my business to be familiar
with police operations to the greatest extent possible in both departments. I
have also heard about other departments from police officers who have
transferred in, or who have done exchanges with other departments.

In general, there will be two kinds of Police Departments for the purposes of
character generation: small departments and large departments. The mission is
not dependent on size, but the department table of organisation will be strongly
affected, as will the ranks and some skills attainable by members of the
service.

A note on terminology - a "member of the service" refers to any individual
working for a police department. A "UMOS" (Uniformed Member Of Service) refers
to any member of the service that is issued a shield and a sidearm. A "Cop" is a
UMOS of rank below Lieutenant; an "Officer" is a UMOS of rank Lieutenant or
above.

SIZING THE DEPARTMENT

For the purposes of determining whether a department is considered large or
small, some information about local population _density_ and area covered by the
department must be available. For the purpose of discussion, interpret the
population density level (PDL) number as you would a population number, ie., as
an exponent of ten, but with units of people per square kilometre rather than
just people. If you\'re one of those people who likes to compute this by using
the "log 10" key on your calculator or in your computer program, round down.

My rule of thumb: If the PDL is less than 4 in the area covered by a single
department, _and_ the area covered by a single department has a population level
less than 5, the department is small. Departments that have other departments
operating partially or totally within their jurisdiction are automatically
large.

As an example, Westchester County, New York has several towns, cities, and
villages:

- - The Village of Pelham has a population of about 6,000 in 2.25 square
kilometres. This yields a PDL of 3 (3.42, actually). The Village of Pelham has a
small department.
- - The County of Westchester has a population of 867,000 in 1192.50 square
kilometres. This yields a PDL of 2 (2.86). However, the population level is 5,
almost 6, _and_ there are departments operating in smaller areas of Westchester
County. Therefore, the Westchester County Parkway Police Department is a large
department, as is the New York State Police Department.
- - The City of New York has 12,000,000 people in an area of about 1,000 square
kilometres. This gives a PDL of 4 (4.07). This alone is enough to make the New
York City Police Department a large department, as is the population level of 7.

TABLE OF ORGANISATION

Small departments are generally unitary, with no division into bureaus for
functional separation, nor into precincts for operational separation. Large
departments frequently have both. The typical small department can be treated as
a single precinct for its table of operation.

The typical precinct is commanded by an officer of rank O2 or higher. This
individual is responsible for overall coordination of activities that occur both
within the police station or out in the operational area, for the entire 24-hour
period of the standard day. In large departments, or in jurisdictions where
there is a lot of crime, he may be assisted by an executive officer whose rank
in small departments is at least one lower than his (but still at least O1) or
in large departments may be equal in rank.

There are three "platoons" in a precinct or a small department - one for each
eight-hour period of the standard day. Platoons are generally lettered in the
Anglic alphabet, with each platoon being listed as on-duty over a specific
eight-hour period. Each platoon is led by a Lieutenant, who is responsible for
coordinating operations in the operational area for the period during which his
platoon is on-duty.

The Lieutenant is also responsible for reporting his platoon\'s activity to the
commanding officer, and for passing on information to the following platoon
about conditions requiring special attention. Staffing of the police station
(ie., ensuring that a sufficient number of Police Officers are in the station at
all time to take walk-in reports of crimes and to process arrests) is the
responsibility of the Lieutenant, as well.

Each platoon is divided up into several squads. Each squad works a sequence of
days on-duty, followed by a shorter sequence of days off-duty. Squads work so
that there is sufficient coverage each day, and so that over a long period of
time, each squad\'s on-duty time is twice its off-duty time. Squads are headed by
Sergeants, who are responsible for ensuring that all information required by the
platoon commander is collected from the police officers, and for monitoring the
performance of the Police Officers in his squad.

In small departments, the Detectives are usually considered a squad on special
assignment, but see the notes on Detectives in large departments.

Administrative duties may be handled by Police Officers given a "special
assignment" of Staff, or by civilian bureaucrats (unranked clerks) specifically
hired for the purpose.

Large departments may have additional levels of command - for example, a
Division Command may have oversight and data collection responsibilities for
several precincts. Large departments always have a headquarters separate from a
precinct, which has ultimate overall responsibility for operational oversight
and strategic planning for the department as a whole. Large departments are
generally divided up into operational bureaus, as follows:

Patrol Service:
     responsible for day-to-day patrol operation of uniformed officers. These
officers are the ones that respond to emergency calls and crimes-in-progress,
and who act as a deterrent by their presence.

Detective Service:
     responsible for investigation and information development of
crimes-completed (in the past). May also arrange and execute "sting" and
under-cover operations.

Internal Affairs:
     responsible for investigating allegations of misconduct by members of the
service. Responsible for proffering specifications for departmental hearings.

Information Systems:
     responsible for maintaining computer systems and software, and development
and purchase of same.

Physical Plant:
     responsible for maintenance of physical facilities of the department.

Quartermaster:
     responsible for supply and maintenance of equipment and consumables
required for department operations.

Information Systems, Physical Plant, and Quartermaster may be contracted out to
non-governmental firms, or to other government agencies. Patrol Service and
Detective Service operate "round-the-clock" (but see below). Other bureaus
generally operate only during "normal business hours".

Detectives are not generally organised into platoons and squads as patrol
officers are. Instead, each detective sets his/her own hours based on the needs
of any cases and/or "stings" or under-cover operations he/she is currently
working on. Hours spent on-duty must conform over the course of one fiscal year
to the same ratio as is required of Patrol Officers.

RANKS AND TYPICAL TITLES (as used in the United States)

There are two "classes" of UMOS, similar to the "enlisted" and "officer"
division of military forces. Typically, they are referred to as "Patrol
officers" (cops, or enlisted) and "Supervisors" (officers). In this
classification, Patrol officers includes detectives of rank E2 and E4, and
Supervisors includes all ranks O1 and above.

The table below gives the rank number and rank title for all ranks. Where
"----" appears in the Detectives column, it means that the Detective Service
bureau does not use that rank. Ranks marked with "*" may be omitted by some
departments; see the notes following the table.

Rank  Standard Title      Detectives
E1*   Cadet               ----
E2    Police Officer      Detective
E3*   Corporal            ----
E4    Sergeant            Detective Sergeant/Investigator
O1    Lieutenant          Lieutenant
O2    Captain             Captain
O3*   Deputy Inspector    Deputy Inspector
O4    Inspector           Inspector
O5*   Assistant Chief     Assistant Chief
O6*   Deputy Chief        Deputy Chief
O7*   Chief of Bureau     Chief of Detectives
O8    Chief of Department ----
O9*   Commissioner        ----
* rank may not exist; see Notes

Notes:
- - Ranks O3 and above are generally considered political appointments from within
the ranks in large departments.
- - Small departments never have Cadets (rank E1) and generally omit ranks E3, O5,
O6, and O7; rank O3 may or may not exist.
- - If ranks O5, O6, and O7 are _all_ omitted, rank O8 is called simply "Chief".
- - Some large departments omit ranks E1 and E3.
- - A department that has rank E1 will also have a Police Academy of its own; a
Cadet will be a prospective Police Officer in the final phase of his/her
training, or, in the largest police departments, may be a college student who is
on a work-study program with a major field of study of Law Enforcement or
Criminal Justice.
- - Small departments never have Commissioners (rank O9). Large departments may or
may not; if a Commissioner exists, it is as a civilian political appointee
setting overall policy, not involved in operational matters.

UMOS are civil service employees until they achieve rank O3. As such, officers
must have come up through the ranks. Do not roll for Commission. Promotion
should be rolled for regardless of SOC and world government if current rank is
below O2, with a +1 DM for each _2_ terms served (count the current term) in
addition to the stated DMs and no SOC benefit. Term DMs are no longer added once
a character achieves rank O2, but at that time, the SOC benefit _is_ added.
Thus, a player with SOC 9 who achieves rank O2 in his 5th term did so with a +2
DM on the promotion roll in addition to any DM for CON, but no SOC DM is given,
even on Low Gov worlds. In subsequent terms, the character has a +2 DM for
time-in-service, _and_ a +1 DM for SOC 8+, for a total DM of +3. The automatic
promotion on Gov High+ worlds applies once a character is attempting to promote
beyond rank O2.

All characters enter the career as rank E2. Time spent as E1 in departments that
use this rank is covered by initial training and possibly Undergraduate
University as well.

Characters may leave the career and then choose to come back. If a character had
rank O2 or below at the time of departure, roll 2D6 for the total number of
terms in _all_ careers up to this point. the result is _greater_than_ the number
of terms served in all careers, the character may re-enter with no loss of rank.
If the result is _less_than_or_equal_to_ the number of terms served in all
careers, one level of rank is lost for _each_ term _not_ served in Law
Enforcement. If the character had rank O3 or above at the time of departure,
roll 2D6 for 10+, DM +1 for SOC 8+, DM +1 for each _2_ terms served in Law
Enforcement. If the roll succeeds, the character is reappointed with no loss of
rank. If the roll fails, the character may not return to Law Enforcement.

SKILL PACKAGES

Small departments:

The supplied skill packages in the basic rules are OK as written. However, the
"Detective" skill package is not used for being "commissioned". Instead, roll
1D6 for assignment each term; on 1, the special assignment is "Staff", on 2, the
special assignment is "Detective". On any other roll, the character is a
uniformed officer.

If the assignment is "Detective", use the Detective skill package instead of the
Uniformed skill package; if the assignment is "Staff", the skill package
consists of Vehicle, Interaction, Charm, Language, Perception, Economics, Social
Science.

On "Staff" assignments, the character gets one Government and one Law
Enforcement contact instead of one Criminal and one Law Enforcement contact in
that term.

Large departments:

Roll 1D6 each term for bureau assignment:

1 - Patrol Service;
2 - Detective Service;
3 - Internal Affairs;
4 - Information Systems;
5 - Physical Plant;
6 - Quartermaster.

If the bureau assignment is Patrol or Detective, roll 1D6 for assignment; on 1
or 2, the character has been assigned to "Staff" and gets the staff skill
package above. Otherwise, Patrol assignees use the uniformed skill package;
Detective assignees use the Detective skill set. For other assignments, use the
following skill packages:

Internal Affairs
     Determination, Charm, Interaction, Perception, Vehicle, Economics, Social
Science.

Information Systems
     Economics, Technician, Interaction, Charm, Perception. Contacts as "Staff",
above.

Physical Plant
     Engineer, Artisan, Construction, Technician, Vehicle, Economics. Contacts
as "Staff", above.

Quartermaster
     Charm, Determination, Interaction, Vehicle, Economics. Contacts as "Staff",
above.

Under the paradigm of the times (before the Arab oil embargo of 1973),
the American auto industry _was_ optimized.  In other words, American
auto manufacturers gave their target market (the American public)
exactly what it wanted:  big, fast cars, that would last until the next
major style change (3-6 years).

Once the paradigm shifted (gasoline costs and availability became
important concerns), the American auto industry initially quickly
shifted to small, [relatively] fuel-efficient cars, that would last
until the next major style change (3-6 years).  It took a few more years
for the industry to shift completely to the new paradigm (reasonably
fuel-efficient vehicles, built to last at least 6 years), but the
American auto industry soon adjusted to the current paradigm.

Thus, within ten years of a major change in conditions, the American
auto industry was able to make a radical shift in focus, and therefore
once again became an optimized industry.  That seems pretty agile to me.

ObTrav:  The transition from one TL to the next will probably seem
disjointed at the time.  A couple of centuries later, OTOH, the
transition will appear to have been much smoother.

It depends, if that optimization takes the form of doing one thing because
that\'s the way it has been done then it\'s tough to call it optimization.

Even so, my point is still supported, as there is the possibility that
things which are quantifiably worse may be in use, although something better
is out there.

In the original post you responded to, that\'s the claim I made, and I think
I\'m going to stick with it. I mean, come on, we\'re talking about a world
where people actually consider the inclusion of a bicycle with a car a
selling point. A world where most people are more interested in whether or
not a car has a CD player, not how many miles it gets to the gallon.

That would be kilometers to the liter to the metric folks on the list,
right?

Actually, you\'re supporting my original point quite nicely.

The industry may have been "optimized" as far as profit may have been
concerned, but it wasn\'t optimized as far as *technology* was concerned,
which is what was at issue in the thread. After all, there is something of a
question concerning whether or not designing an automobile to last 3-6 years
can be considered "optimization".

Still, to wrangle that point back to Traveller: What\'s your average Far
Trader\'s useful lifespan? My own bet, given the nature of the Imperium, is
that it\'s only a little longer than it takes to pay the ship off.

I must have touched upon a sore point. The agility with which change *can*
come is not in question.

It depends on how tech level is defined. With the appearance of certain
technologies (such as the computer, jump drive, contra-gravity and
reactionless thrusters) the transition will not only appear "disjointed" it
will actually *be* disjointed.

IMHO, you missed at least two other reasons for "visiting strange new
worlds":

1.  Simple curiosity.  Terran monkeyboys will often travel to unusual
places just to see what\'s there.  Charles Darwin\'s voyage aboard HMS
BEAGLE is a pretty good example of this motive.

2.  "Been There, Done That":  An even more potent motive for human
exploration has been the desire to be the first to visit some place. 
Sir Edmund Hillary [Mt. Everest], Admiral Byrd [the North Pole], and
Neil Armstrong [Earth\'s Moon] are all good examples of this motive.

Neither of the motives which I have mentioned directly involve wealth or
conquest.  They are, nonetheless, powerful reasons for human exploration
to date.

Worlds and civilizations are a lot more than just the
technologies they use (although these technologies
have some significant effects on culture).  If the
places to which you travel are homogenous, it\'s the
referee\'s fault, not the technologies\'.

Just to throw you - here in NZ it\'s offically L/100km. However most of 
us use km/L or miles/gallon (Imperial, not American).

Actually, I think Marc _told_ Joe Fugate of the "Aslan Secret", and then Joe
wrote it up. Remember, the only place that DGP material is considered
"non-canonical" is in official GURPS Traveller material. I\'m sure that Marc et
al  are free to use the *concepts* created by DGP; this was part of the original
licence.

So, for example, "jump dimming" is still canonical, even though Joe (DGP)
invented it simply so that the lights could go out in one of his scenarios ("The
Gold of Zurrian", Traveller\'s Digest #4). [Actually, I\'ve just realised that is
*not* a good example, since it found its way into the MT Encyclopedia - but you
get the general idea!].

"Some" significant effects on culture?

Industrialization, television, the telegraph, the telephone, the computer,
the personal computer, the internet, hybrid seeds, the wheel, domestication
of animals, the knife, the spear, gunpowder, the plough, the camera, the
movie camera, the record album, audio and video cassettes, penicillin, LSD,
steel, the assembly line, the printing press, the photocopier, the
transistor... etc... etc...

Technology has a little more than "some" significant effects. It can even be
argued that technology, to one extent or another, actually goes a large way
in defining the various cultures on earth.

Same thing happens in the legal and medical

medical school thinking they\'ll soon have lots of

I thought that *nobody* could use the stuff that *only appears* in DGP
products. I remember the problem going back before GURPS: Traveller was even
around.

Yep, it was printed in a GDW product, so it\'s okay to use in future
products. Personally, I\'ve advocated the de-canonization of DGP\'s products
in the past, and I still do, for one very simple reason:

It\'s really rather absurd to insist that authors for Traveller products be
familiar with material that is only in the hands of a few and legally cannot
be reprinted, copied, or used.

Others may disagree, and indeed they have disagreed in the past.

Properly designed deadfall ordinance shouldn\'t reach terminal velocity on the

velocity for a highly streamlined object is pretty high, anyway.)

Traveller ordinance benifits from being fired from farther away than orbit;

True enough. I was using the GURPS Space version originally.  It _does_

I thought I\'d corrected for that just below:

Duh, yup.  &^%$$% calculator has ruined my slide rule ability.


Also, note:

Both the thrust and the maximum module limits changed. Interesting error.

Back to the code (again). This time I\'ll use the GVE2 modules, as you\'ve
shown me that they are plausible.

It was a group effort -- I was involved, although  forget if I actually got 
credit or not (it was a _long_ time ago). Marc named the Aslan, however, 
before the Contact article was written, in the (now almost impossible to 
find) Traveller Aliens Handout.

A not illogical conclusion.

Trim your followups. Tim\'s post was justifiable, if slightly rantish
and topic-drifted, but it didn\'t really need to be requoted in 
its entirety for your one line addition.

It\'s especially annoying to those of us who read the digest version
of the TML, where we have to scroll through all of that to read the
next post.

Well, I don\'t really buy your line of reasoning here. Traveller has its
roots planted firmly in the soil of the libertarian sci-fi tradition, which
focuses heavily on trade and big guns. "The Other," at least in my
estimation, is not really akin to the hippie experience, the skill set seems
more along the line of shady rogues. Perhaps a 60s revolutionary might fit
the mold, but I\'m not sure that your average hippie would[1].

[1] Actually, I stand corrected! In preparation for this email, an anonymous
source sent me the following from the unpublished "Book 8: Other,"
originally to be published as "Book 8: Higher Guard". The book was never
published, not because of its controversial nature, but simply because the
author referred to the Imperium as the Hemperium throughout. This is from
the section concerning new skills:

"Bogartry: The character has experience in taking more than his fair share
in situations where substances are shared in a communal fashion. Bogartry
skill does not guarantee success, but does minimize bad effects if the
individual is caught in the act of bogarting."

"Bowl Construction: The individual has a degree of proficiency in the
construction of small pipes for use in smoking tobacco, as well as other
substances which must be burned and the smoke inhaled for the effects to be
felt.
    "Bowl Construction experience enables a character to make a bowl out of
almost anything, from fruits and vegetables, to scraps found in any kitchen
or engineering section, to the body parts of fallen foes (and comrades).
Generally, the skill is a DM applied to the throw to devise such a device.
Higher levels of the skill allow the construction of advanced pipes, such as
bongs and hookahs.
    "Referee: Specific throws for specific situations must be generated.
Obviously, some throws will be more difficult than others, and some will be
impossible without an accumulation of of DMs based on education,
intelligence, dexterity and the available parts and tools. To generate a
specific throw, the referee analyzes the circumstances and selects a number
to be thrown (usually throw that number or greater to succeed). A DM may be
applied if the individual is "jonesing"; this DM is usually a penalty, but
if the situation is severe enough, it could merit a bonus. Bowl Construction
throws are restricted to one per specific time period, an hour, four hours,
a day, or a week, as appropriate. Characters\' die rolls should not be
divulged when constructing a pipe; instead, the success or failure should be
revealed on its first use."

Wow. Metro Detroit with a zillion different police departments... 

Anyway, up here north of the border, it\'s much simpler. In Edmonton, we 
have the city police department and the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police). There is an Alberta Highway Patrol, but that\'s merely a division 
of the RCMP in Alberta.

The RCMP has federal, national jurisdiction. (In Canada, criminal law is
a federal matter, unlike the USA where it\'s at the state level.) However,
in areas that have their own local police departments (generally, 
communities legally incorporated as a City), the Mounties will generally
defer responsibility for law enforcement to the local PD. Towns, villages,
and the spaces in between and outside the communities, the RCMP handles
local law enforcement.

The exception: two provinces, Ontario and Quebec, have their own provincial
police forces (the OPP and QPP, respectively); in these areas, the OPP / QPP
handle the law enforcement outside cities that have their own local PDs,
leaving the RCMP to handle anything of a multi-jurisdictional nature, like
the FBI in the USA.

As far as I can tell, the different departments do co-operate very nicely.
If for example I was wanted for a crime committed in Ontario, the Edmonton
PD could arrest me, then hand me off to the RCMP, who in turn would turn 
me over to the OPP (or the city police if the crime was in a particular
city)... we don\'t seem to get the jursidictional turf wars that I keep
seeing on American police televison dramas...

Are there canonical or widely-published rules for starship decrepitude
in Traveller? 

I was just going to plug mine again:

I\'ve chosen Louzy/Jewell as the world. A class D starport on a population A
(10 billion) world? And according to Behind the Claw (GURPS), Louzy has a
great deal of heavy metals - a prime export. So why is the starport class D?
It is canon that Louzy was occupied by the Zhodani as a staging area for the
Siege of Efate (re: Spinward Marches Campaign) - a class D starport isn\'t a
useful staging area, no refined fuel or repairing abilities.

So, I offer this possibility: Louzy was class A or B (doesn\'t really matter
which) but was reduced to calss D due to fighting by the Zhodani and the
Guerilla defence forces (again, from SMC).

Doug, Louzy might also be a useful sidebar - if the Starport went from A or
B to D, the damage was quite extensive. And canonically, the Zhodani placed
a garrison on Louzy - so there was ground fighting for certain.

Anyone see any holes in my plots?

I can do that with just the above... Take every third word:

grunge kill need enforced important very most real need

Grunge = local dialect for Gushemege, the sector next to Ilelish, where
Dulinor comes from.

Enforced = rearrange the *sounds* by pronouncing the second syllable
backwards then adding the first syllable forwards: Strephon!

"Important, [a] very most real need" to kill Strephon. It\'s all there
in black and white.

Not knowing Turkish, I thought it was from the books.  I like the Turkish
idea, but am happier in my ignorance with thinking it\'s from the books... as
it is human nature to name things like that :^)

Actually, the measure we use up here is litres per 100 kilometres -- the

The only problem I have with this is that, at least as far as GT is
concerned, the Humans on Terra, who would someday become the Solomani,
invented the jump drive on their own, without any help. The GT rulebook
makes this point very clearly and emphatically. I don\'t know if any
other canon Traveller source says anything about the subject, but the
GT declaration is close enough to canon for me. :)

Well, just keep in mind that many granite buildings actually have
higher background counts than are allowed outside a nuclear facility!

For that matter, "seed" the place with something that\'s harmless until
the damper hits it.

Which leads to fun when a VIP from a TL-9 world enters the building and
suddenly keels over. Why? You neutralized the Pu in the powerpack for
his heart pacemaker! (real technology, folks!)

Well, the trick is that everybody is dealing with the *same* universe.
So the "best" way of doing something is the same for everyone. Chinese
"junks" are *very* different than Western multi-masted ships in
construction. Yet they are bother sailing ships and operate much the
same.

Like I said, if any of these are more efficient than what the others
use, then it won\'t be all *that* long before the others switch to it.

The only exceptions will be cases were a race can\'t *physically*
tolerate something about the drive/device. 

And the rare cases where there\'s a social "taboo", such as Imperials
using psi. So you might be able to have a race using "grown" ships
because it\'s against their principles to travel via machine.

My point was that "optimization" is a cultural phenomenon, of which
technology is only a part.

That depends on the manufacturer.  Just as Terrans in the last years of
the 20th century expect certain makes of automobiles to last longer than
others (note the varying lengths of warranties on cars, depending on
manufacturer), so should Imperial citizens expect some shipyards to
build longer-lasting ships than others.  For instance, <blatant plug>
AuricTech starships are built to a higher quality standard than, say,
General Shipyards on Regina.</blatant plug>  Of course, AuricTech
starships _cost_ more than the cheap trash that General puts out, but
you get what you pay for.

Maybe I\'m missing something here but everything you describe as bribery is very
basic common sense to everyone I know. If  I have Streetwise I would know the who,
what, when, where and what of bribery. I can\'t see any clear and convincing reason
for bribery to be a unique skill.

Sure it does. Almost all those power plants you listed work *exactly*
the same way. They convert rotary motion into electricity by spinning
coils in a magnetic field (or spinning magnets inside coils, same
difference). What\'s different is where they *get* the rotary motion. 

Solar is the one exception, and it\'s *damned* expensive. It directly
converts light to electricity. 

Everything else uses moving fluid to turn blades. Wind generators use
giant propellors. Hydroelectric uses turbines driven by water flowing
downhill. Modern gas fired (and a few oil fired?) plants use gas
turbines, basicly a jet engine with the shaft coupled to the generator.
The rest use various forms of heat to generate steam, which drives a
steam turbine. 

Fusion (when and if it arrives) will likely be used to generate steam
as well. But there are a couple types of fusion that *may* be able to
produce electricity more or less directly. Those will have to be a
*lot* more expensive to not drive the others out of business. That\'s
because they\'ll both be more *efficient* (ie more of the energy
produced in the reactor will wind up as *useful* power), and because
they\'ll be *far* less complicated.

The "spear thrower" (aka atl-atl, aka woomera) has been invented at
least three seperate times. Bagpipes have been invented *four* times.

At lower TLs, nuclear power *is* an option for power plants on board

Well, as an example, if there was a race that was affected by *heavy*
radiation doses about as much as were are by excessive heat, they\'d not
need much radiation shielding on the ship, and, likewise, they might
not *bother* with fusion power. After all, since they\'d not need all
that *heavy* shielding, for them a fission reactor might be preferred
because it\'s *compact*. 

Mind you, they don\'t get a lot of passengers from other races. :-) 

Another possibility would be aliens that are far more sensitive to
jumpspace than humans. They know about J-space, they just can\'t *use*
it. Giving them a different FTL drive might be a problem as far as game
balance goes. Giving them a manuever drive that lets them get to
relativistic speeds is even worse. But if they live long enough, they
can just use normal manuever drives to travel between stars. So what if
the trip takes 100 years. If you live 5000 years, that\'s merely
inconvenient. 

But just because aliens have thrusters, jumpdrive, lasers, etc
*doesn\'t* mean that the "technologies" are the same. So far we know of
at least 5 ways to build computers. Mechanical (Babbage engines),
thermionic (tubes), semiconductors (transistors/ICs), fluidics and
optical (still being perfected). And that\'s for *digital* computers.

Consider aliens who prefer to use *analog* computers. Analog computers
of all the above types are (or should be) available. And they work
*very* differently.

A digital computer crunches away and returns an answer, to however many
places. The answers are "exact" within the precision limits. But they
can also be *very* wrong if you are "outside the range" of the
algorithm or the program has a bug.

Analog computers return answers *immediately*. That is, entering the
imput values causes the output to assume the value of the answer. But
the answer is "fuzzy". That is, the value of the answer depends on how
closely you can read the scaler that the pointer moves along. 

A slide rule is an analog computer. So are the gunnery computers on the
New Jersey!

Electronic analog computers are mostly based on op amps, not gates. 

Analog computers do require "programming, but it\'s a lot different from
digital computers.

Aliens using analog computers might actually have *better* "gunnery"
than the players with their fancy digital computers. But their
"predict" function might be fairly lousy. Or maybe not. 

But both sides would drive themselves nuts trying to get anything
useful to *their* setup from examining the other guy\'s setup. :-)

Now consider construction techniques. We bolt things together when we
may want to take them apart later. What might aliens use? What might be
"just as good" as screws, nuts and bolts, but *different*? 

One possibility I can wrap my head around is some sort of glues. But
that doesn\'t mean there aren\'t others. One I just remembered from some
SF story  is fasteners based on magnostriction. Basicly the "bolt" is a
simple rod inserted into the holes in the parts to be joined. When you
remove the tool that you used to insert it, the rod *expands* enough to
be about as immovable as a nut and bolt. Why, because it\'s an alloy
sensitive to magnetic fields, and the tool was magnetized. Though there
are better ways to use this sort of metal to fasten things. 

Picture the PC\'s poor engineer trying to figure out how to open up
pieces of a equipment on the alien ship the players are trying to
salvage. :-)

Same *function*, different methods.

No, there\'s more to it. I used CT\'s Bribery to model the parody Bogartry in
a previous message concerning hippies and the Other career. Bribery lessens
the negative effects of a failed bribery attempt.

From what I can gather, this requires:

1.) Knowing whether or not you can bribe a given party safely, often with
little or no prior knowledge of how honest that party is. The person
offering the bribe must have the ability to read people with some degree of
effectiveness, or they simply can\'t be said to have the skill.

2.) Knowing how to offer the bribe in a fashion which doesn\'t tip off the
party being bribed if they are honest and won\'t take bribes.

Your observations are right on target.  The thing that I
found amazing was the number of skeptics who, in
attempting to disprove that credibility, were converted to
true believers.  I remember one fellow I met about 20
years ago, who was an athiest.  When he went to
university, he had an athiest Greek teacher who scoffed
at the "low brow" (koine) language of the New Testement
and encouraged his fellow scoffers to translate portions
of the text to see just how childish it was.

My friend did just that.  He chose the Gospel of John,
because it was the shortest gospel account.  According
to him, by the time he had finished translating it, he felt
that he knew Yeshua (Jesus) as well as he knew anyone
else and had come to believe that maybe there was
something to be learned from this ancient text.  The more
he translated and studied the texts, the greater his
understanding and belief became.

Like the US\'s intervention in Serbia.  Those people have
been fighting for centuries.  The only reason that one side
hasn\'t wiped the other out is that there have been outside
interventions to prevent it.  The only way that conflict will
be settled will be for them to fight to the bitter end or for
one group or the other (or both) to be relocated.  A hand
full of PC\'s or an army of NPC\'s just won\'t change
anything.

This is a bit of a different situation.  One man can make a
difference if the rest are willing to allow the difference to
be made.  I saw a rerun of a Star Trek Voyager episode
last night in which Capt. Janeway was allowed to judge
the Q.  Both sides agreed to allow her to judge and
agreed to be bound by her judgement.

True, some of the best scholarship has come from those
who were biased against the book, but not dogmatic in
thier bias.  This is actually true for those scholars who
were biased toward the book as well.  Dogmatism has
no place in science (or IMHO, in religion).

Also, keep in mind that Jason was talking about the New
Testement.  As to the *accuracy* of the Bible as an
historical document, the New Testement covers very little
ground (historically speaking).  Only the first 5 books
have much to do with history.  Although, there are a few
nuggets here and there amonst the remainder that point
to the then current events.

The last I heard, with the exception of Theophilos (to
whom Luke wrote his account of the gospel and what is
now referred to as the Acts of the Apostles) every
notable name (political figures, etc.) mentioned in the
New Testement has been found in other historical
documents.

I doubt that there will ever be an historical Theophilos
found.  While the use of terminology like "most excellent"
or "O" (a term used in formal address) would seem to
indicate that Theophilos was a dignatary of some sort or
other.  However; there is another interpretation that I think
to be more likely.

I believe that Theophilos was not a specific person, but
rather a group of people.  In most societies, names have
everyday meanings.  Some English examples would
include names like June, Skip, Mason, Alley and
Hammer, just to name a few.  In Greek, Theophilos
means "Friend of God" or "Lover of God."  So for Luke
to write to "most excellent Theophilos" or "O Theophilos"
would be like my writing a letter in this forum that started
out something like "Dear Traveller," or if I was attempting
to indicate my respect for the members of this forum, I
might make the greeting, "Most Excellent Traveller:".

You would understand that it was written to you.  If you
thought about it, you would also know that I was writing to
all the other travellers on this list.  That\'s why I believe
that Luke was writing to me (and other lovers of God),
and not to some historical figure.

There have been several items that seemed at first blush
to contradict the New Testement (historically speaking);
however, further examination of the historical documents
have vendicated the authenticity of the New Testement
(as a historical document).  Again, I am only speaking of
the New Testement.

When we come to the Old Testement, its authenticity as
a historical document is also well documented.  Parts of
it are quite ancient.  As to its historicity (value as history),
most archiologists that study in areas covered in it use it
as a first in text.  Over and over, the historical accuracy
of the Bible has been vindicated by those digs.

It\'s amazing the difference that book has made in many

As long as we are bringing up old TV series, let\'s not

Another posibility is Narval. It was colonized by Imperials before
and was captured by the Zho. The Imperials thought it was too 
important to be left to the Zho and using a deep thrust assualt, 
destroyed the starport and most of the cities with mass drivers.
The attack was so severe it blew away most of the atmosphere.
The Zho saved the people they could and have rebuilt the starport. 

I don\'t know what it was before so it may qualify.

On another subject, would that kind of an attack against these 
people be a violation of the Laws of War? Devistating the civilian 
population intentionaly, using weapons of mass (forgive the pun) 
destruction. Include the fact they were subjugated Imperial 
citizens. For that kind of hidious crime, IMTU, some navy 
officers would have stood trial for crimes against sphiontry. (sp?)
There would have been a HUGE stink. Just because the enemy have
captured your people is no excuse to kill them. The starport and 
any military vessels were fair game but they crossed the line when 
they tried to kill all the civilians.

Opinions?

Not to mention the creation story used by the Judaic, Mohamedan, and
Christian faiths is shared with several other persian religions. One other
key thing about these religiouns that is shared is Persistance...
Zorastrianism (*the oldest of the lot) still has over a million
followers... One of whom was known world wide... A gent named Farouk....
better known by his "Brittish" name... Freddy Mercury.

The peoples of the book are a very diverse set, and I wonder about their
survival into the 3I.

Zorastrianism is already some 5000 years old, as is Judaism. Christianity,
as a whole, is a derivative of Judaism. Mohamedan religion (Commonly called
Islam), is some 14-16 centuries old... All these religions emphasise
ritual, belief, and (except for certain sects) educated self-interpretation
with the assistance of the leadership.

Ob Trav: Gabreelism, from Traveller Chronicle, is one very plausible
outgrowth of the phenomena of the "Peoples of the Book". Anybody have any
others?

I didn\'t read closely enough. This was in the third frontier war.

IMTU the following space propulsion methods are used:

1) CG:   good out to 10 planetary diameters, extensive use on small
craft.

2) Thrusters:  good out to 1000 solar diameters, used by everyone who
gets outside the 10 planetary limit.

3) HEPLAR/Fussion Rockets:  secondary drive for anyone who gets outside
1000 solar diameter limit (military and scouts mainly)

4) Solar Sails:  Idle rich (solar sail races)

The distinction is that bribery, typically, isn\'t the streetpunk paying off
a cop. It\'s more often the punk\'s supplier offering the cops stuff in ways
that are
A) Not easily traced/tracked
B) discreet
c) not likely to be connected directly with the actions desired.

I\'ve done a little bribery myself... of Maitre\'d\'s at posh restaurants.
There are distinct skills for doing this. Like placing your hand on the
podium, with just a corner of the bill showing, watching to see if he
notices, asking if there is a table available, and seeing if he\'s looking
in the book or your hand, and then leaving the bill so that only he sees
it. Not quite sleight of hand, but not far from it, plus the nuances of
seeing whether he smiles or not at seing the bill. It\'s in the details of
doing it. The streetwise may tell you which cop will take a bribe, but no
cop is going to take an obvious bribe on a righteous bust unless severly
compromised already. An obvious approach to bribery often gets rebuffed.
Also, it\'s like knowing that Claude, the Maitre\'d at the crows nest for
many years, knows you know how to behave, and that the tip is for
overlooking your underage status and sending the wine-steward over... he
knew me, and knew my folks wouldn\'t raise a stink for dinner at a 4-star
restaurant to be eaten with a light wine. And, that for a C-not, he\'ll let
you in without reservations. And knowing that you mustn\'t let the other
staff see, otherwise he only gets 10% of it. Likewise, Michelle, from the
Corsair, will seat you for $50, but will put you with the waiters in
training, won\'t even think of sending you a wine steward for less than $500
(He\'s been popped on serving to minors before), and that you must pass him
the bribe to his palm, rather than letting him close the book on it, and do
so as you thank him for the seat. Then again, there are 3 four-star
restaurants in town... and Marx Brothers, the last of them, had a much
higher standard, even if they had a FAR less restrictive dress code... The
one time I offered the bribe to get a seat, I was offered a "Tour of the
staff lounge", whereupon I was threatened with a police call in exchange
for my $100 bill. I later heard rumors that that Maitre\'d was an ex-cop...

Likewise, birbery of government clerks is a matter of knowing how to offer
them what they want without costing them their job.

In all cases, it requires a set of skills at reading both their
receptiveness, as well as knowing how to deliver without compromising the
safety or job of the bribee. Streetwise will tell you who\'s corrupt...
bribery tells you how to get them on YOUR payroll. And how to keep them
where you want them while paying them.

In societies where graft is common, yeah, substitute either carousing or
streetwise... it\'s just part of normal life. But where it\'s prohibited (or
at least severely frowned upon) it requires a certain set of skills to pull
off. Which, unless you have more interpersonal skill IYTU than I have IMTU,
seem to best be summed up under bribery.

The Police Officer\'s Funeral was attended by representatives of 46
different officers, according to the press release to the local news.
Likewise, some other areas have similar levels of overlap, all with
jurisdiction for all crimes.

I was lucky enough to be able to read a few of the cars, and then asked a
few locals about it. And saw a response near the house where I was staying.
(Anyone in the detroit metro area, it was on 9th street in wyandotte).

While LA is often claimed to be 100 villages in search of a City, Detroit
really is 20+ cities who just happen to fill their turf right to the
borders, with a muni gov\'t thrown on top to FORCE cooperation.

Likewise, Portland, Oregon, really is six cities under a municipal
government. (And crossing at least two counties). I don\'t recall seing
local police there (Portland Metro, plus two sherrifs departments, those
I\'ve seen). Detroit is an extreme of the US system.

The city where I live (and grew up) is much the opposite. Alaska has no
counties, only Burroughs and Municipalities. In Alaska, a Municipality is
when a City government merges with a Burrough government. Burroughs are
physically HUGE. Burroughs are forbidden tohave police forces of their own,
but municipalities may. Cities may have PD\'s, too. And we have the State
Department of Public Safety, with 4 divisions (State Troopers, Airport
Police, University Police, and Fish and Wildlife... the first and last are
one administatively and training wise, the middle two have separate
training and hiring, but answer to the state director of public safety).
When Achorage was young, it had 3 neighboring "Incorporated Cities", plus
housed the "Greater Anchorage Area Bourough" (GAAB) government, separate
from the city government. As anchorage expanded, it surrounded, then
absorbed the Cities of Mountain View, Spenard, and Jewel Lake. The
Incorporated Townships of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peter\'s Creek, Girdwood,
Indian, and Turnagain were too far away for this to happen. In 1976,  the
city and the GAAB sought a municipality. All the above now fall under the
jurisdiction of the Municipality, and in theory, could have APD services.
Girdwood then became a city, but doesn\'t have a mayor since that would
confuse the titles with the Mayor of Anchorage, who is THE mayor for all
the residents of the former GAAB. Several townships are not covered by APD
even though they are surrounded by areas that do. Girdwood doesn\'t since
there\'s 60 miles of nothing between the south end and girdwood. Eagle Rive
does, as do Chugiak, Peter\'s Creek, and Eklutna (Those run North from
anchorage, in the order presented) even they are streched along the glenn
highway between 10 and 25 miles north of the North-east corner of Anchorage
proper. Mind you, the APD doesn\'t police the highway itself, even though
that\'s the only way to get between anchorage and the "Valley" (Eagle River
Valley, properly). State troopers have no "Routine" authority inside city
limits... but they may pursue, investigate, or arrest anywhere.... BTW,
Girdwood, 60 miles away, has Anchorage Fire Department Service, while
Chugiak , 15 miles away,doesn\'t have AFD, and isonly five miles past Eagle
river which does have AFD services...

Which brings me to another Ob:Trav diversion....
IYTU, how common is it to integrate the various emergency services?
