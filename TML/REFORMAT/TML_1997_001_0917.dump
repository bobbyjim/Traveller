Unlike the Zhodani, Lensmen don\'t go around reading minds
indiscriminately. And they don\'t "re-adjust" people unless they\'ve done
something criminal.

Unless your players are as bad as some folks I used to game with,
they\'d be far from Boskonian. 

BTW, one interesting point from the Lensman books. From the precautions
taken at the start of "Gray Lensman" it would appear that unless
special precautions are taken, the standard "screens" have *no* effect
on visible light. 

So a big visible light laser would give them a *nasty* surprise. :-)

Nope. As a gamma ray source, it must still have a bit of a nebula
around it, *and* have a high rate of spin. Both of which disqualify it
for being BVS-1. They also make it hazardous at rather large distances.

Arrgh! I used to *own* a copy of that... I can\'t believe that I forgot it.

But I think that I\'d rather have a Kzinti warship hailing them :-)
(And for that matter, I\'d make the Trek ship be Cardassian, Romulan,
Klingon or Borg. And the Bab-5 would be better with either a
"spidership" or a Vorlon ship...)

Yeah, but neither do the Zhos.  Their definition of criminal is perhaps a
little more liberal than ours, but the intent is (I gather), much the same,
i.e., to get people to stop doing that which you find unacceptable.

Hi All,

I don\'t know if anyone has posted something like this yet, but 
I want to be able to use that long MT weapon list for T4 in my
upcoming campaign.  So I\'ve worked out some conversion
rules of thumb.

Note - this is a quick+dirty system only, decimal point fetishists
beware!

T4 RANGE = MT RANGE - 2 RANGE STEPS

e.g. a MT weapon rated as max Long Range becomes Short
range in T4 (range mod of 2 for aimed attacks)

T4 DAMAGE = MT DAMAGE + P,
where P = MT PENETRATION -3, but P is never less than 0

eg a Pistol with a MT Damage of 3 and Penetration of 1
has a T4 damage of 3 + 0, as P=1-3=-2 but has a min of 0

Weapon e.g. 1 
a PGMP-12 (yesssss!) from MT is rated as Damage 12, 
Penetration 20 and Max Range Distant.
In T4 this becomes damage 29, range Long (+4 on aimed attacks)
(perhaps this weapon is beyond the workable range of the conversion
rules but I included it anyway)

Weapon e.g. 2
a Gauss Rifle in MT is rated as Damage 4, Penetration 7 and
max range V.Long
Thus the T4 stats are damage 8, range Medium

Weapon e.g 3
a custom pistol with MT stats has a Damage of 3, Penetration 2
and a max range of Medium
The T4 Damage is 3, range V.Short

All the other stats such as mass, number of rounds etc can be used
directly.  These rules of thumb are really only checked for personal
weapons, but go ahead and use it for your startship lasers if you
want!

Any comments welcome.

It has been pointed out that my previous postings on DGP sounded rather
negative. Yup, they were. Totally my fault (and not my intention) because I
wasn\'t thinking straight and getting too het up about my pet subject.

I\'ve apologised to Roger (Sanger) for the inconvenience this may have caused
him; as I explained in my previous e-mail, the focus of my anger was about
getting one\'s butt out there and doing things to promote Traveller rather
than just moaning about the current situation (an awful lot of which has
happened on this list) and *hoping* that things will get better just like
that. I shouldn\'t have dragged DGP into this. I also said a few things that
were potentially out of date and I foolishly didn\'t put in the usual
caviats, "to my (limited) knowledge", etc.

I have every hope that DGP will be allowed to use their previous products
(through new writers, etc.) to help make Traveller the success it deserves
to be. Roger and I both believe that we (DGP and CORE) can make a positive
and coordinated contribution to Traveller and Imperium Games. We do not view
each other as competitors and we will try to maintain consistency and
compatibility across our products.

That\'ll teach me for writing replies when I\'m hassled at work!

I would assume that this is a rule in much the same way that we currently
make rules about how much cement should be mixed with how much sand when
building a house. 1:20 is a non-optimal mixture. As a result at least one
entire housing estate has been recommended to be pulled down pronto within
only a year or so of it having been constructed... "rules" are made to be
broken. The resulting dangers may be minimal or they may be great. Previous
versions of Traveller have had plenty of compact inflatable rescue balls,
cheap emergency vac suits, etc. without having to dedicate any specific
space to them...

After a short while of eating each other, some of the Vilani started going
"Mooooo" and falling over a lot. The government screwed around for 10-20
years, knowing pretty much that a killer prion virus was to blame, but being
too indecisive (and pressurised, since they had substantial back-handers
from the wealthier land-owners some of whom actually cultivated criminal
farms to feed the rich) to do anything. Eventually there was public outcry,
but the government showed how concerned it was by saying that only young
babies shouldn\'t be fed the \'contaminated\' meat. A minister even fed his own
child some Vilani carcass to show how safe it was. However, after more
outcry, a mass criminal-burning campaign was begun and the scientists worked
out that it was all too late and up to one third of their population was
probably at risk of dying from this disease. They wouldn\'t know for certain
for another 10-20 years because of its long incubation period.

A telling story. A pity they didn\'t learn from the history of Terra...

You\'ll have to imagine the following advert written in gothic script for a
suitable TL 2-4 Vilani society:

*****

BUY KUSHGENKI!
At Kushgenki Meat Products we use only the highest quality corn-fed
Ghuski[1] in our delicious pies, burgers and steaks. Fast-fattened Ghuski
enjoy a quality free-range existence[2] which gives them that unique
Kushgenki taste. We frown upon the chained slavery practices utilised by
cheaper down-market producers. BUY KUSHGENKI! BUY QUALITY!

*****

([1] Ghuski being the Vilani word at that point for criminal, drifter,
down-and-out, accountant, etc.)
([2] within the high security Kushgenki farming enclosures, with well-armed
guards and the highest perimeter palisades this side of the Yeon tower)

For those who use full size (like, 1"=1.5m  squares I think) deck plans, I
highly recommend the seeker deck plans.  I picked up the whole bunch at
GenCon this past year (paid a pretty penny too!) and did not regret the
investment.

Be sure to get the mega-packs, not the individual ones (saves some money).

Detail is down to chairs and bunks, and with a little imagination
condiment stands and salad bars.

I just got into T4, having played a little CT way back, but not MT or TNE.
I found a used copy of FFS for cheap, and have been playing around with
that.  So, here\'s my question: is there any conversion ratio for damages
generated for TNE, into T4 damages?  Specifically, the damage for a small
laser pistol I worked up seems a little high.

This has been suggested before, and I think it\'s an excellent idea. If 
the \'owner\' then writes up \'their\' system, then it\'s even better.

A slight variation on the idea, how about IG selling Imperial Noble

desirability of the area governed).

It\'s about the same length as the Barrett M82A1 .50-cal rifle. Not the

Grin.  You\'re not the only one to stumble onto this idea.  Somewhere around
here I\'ve got a design of the _Doradus_, a twenty-million displacement-ton
jumpram, built for that very mission, using FF&S rules.  

The idea was that it could accelerate up to ramscoop operating speed, and
use the interstellar hydrogen to refuel the jump drive.  I think it could
manage a jump after three days of refueling, giving a flight time of about
250 years or so.  The assumption was that it could travel in a straight
line and stay in the Magellanic Stream of hydrogen, and that it was dense
enough to work out.  The ship was tech-15, jump-6, a truly unbelievable
black-globe added just because I could, and cost something like TCr 20.
(Yes, teracredits, one-followed-by-nine-zeros.)  I think it had eight of 
the largest PEMS detectors I could find, configured as two fixed arrays 
of four, one for navigation and one for scientific research.  

I recall there were some design problems I never fixed before I abandoned
it.  Jump-drive surface area was almost certainly one of them, and might
be a show-stopper.  It uses a ramscoop, which might be a problem; luckily
for the storyline fusion rockets are sufficient for normal STL travel, 
but ramscoops are needed for jumprams to work.  I don\'t remember what I
did about the maintenance problem; some way to get a starport aboard 
would be ideal.  :)  Flight time shouldn\'t be a problem, again because
the Vilani and Solomani both managed long-duration conventional STL trips
this long at only tech-9.  Real-space velocity wasn\'t any faster than
those ships either, so that also wasn\'t a problem.  I\'d have to dig it
up and look it over to figure out just what needed to be fixed.

Not that I\'ve ever heard.  Don\'t look too closely at relativity and jump
drive at the same time, or you\'ll start to find inconsistencies and get 
confused.  :)  For instance, don\'t start asking questions about how long
a week in jumpspace is at hyperrelativistic velocities.

Yes, relative to the planet of departure.

FF&S had optional rules, if you want to allow them.

I don\'t think he was designing a concealable weapon.

5 feet, while long, is not unbelievable.  Especially if the weapon is to
be used as a medium to long distance (150 to 1000 meters) shooting.
Remember, the longer the barrel, the more time the round has to stabilize
(and accelerate, of course).

Civil war rifles and muskets were probably not much shorter.

At the same time, better leave this item behind if you are hunting the
two-legged type of game in a starport warehouse (which is the kind of
hunting usually happening at our game table), I don\'t think you could slew
it around very fast.

But that still implies that within 20-30 parsecs of Sylea at least one TL 
14+ civilization existed not so very many centuries ago. That alone is so
interesting that it would have a major impact on the background. At the
very least the Hightechian civilization would be known throughout the
Imperium (in name if nothing else) and deserves a note in the history
books.

Btw. what are the prices quoted on these TL 14 items? Are they a lot higher
than CT/MT prices for the same items? If not, then there is at least one
major mistake right there. Such relics would be _valuable_.

>I see them as adventure hooks and ideas for new gimmicks. 

I see them as the same. I\'m working on an adventure set in the Sword Worlds
in 71 and one gimick is an amazing, never-before-seen laser pistol WITH AN
INTEGRAL POWER PACK!!! Zowie!!!! (Reverent whisper: "That\'s a Darrian Old
Technology weapon!!! Where did that come from?")

>If this doesn\'t fit into you campaign, don\'t use them.

That comment and variations on it really bugs me. I\'m fully aware that I
don\'t need anyone\'s permission to change anything I damn well want in my
own game. That\'s not the issue. The issue is that FLT radios and warp drives
and magically appearing high-tech relics don\'t fit into the _official_ 
Traveller Universe. The magic of the Traveller experience is the high
degree of consistency which (despite some major mistakes) it still retains
after 20 years of work by multiple authors. I know it\'s not perfect, and that
mistakes are inevitable, but that dosen\'t mean we shouldn\'t try our best to
avoid them. I know I can "just" filter out the mistakes, but then, I could 
also "just" write my own background. But I want to be able to draw on more 
material than I can manage to create on my own, and any mistakes I have to 
correct is just so much more unnecessary bother. Wouldn\'t it be better if 
the mistakes weren\'t made in the first place?

Aaargghh!!! I remember it well! I\'d never allow it in my

That was something that jarred amongst a generally vastly 
better product. The Companion Bot. According to the 
Traveller time and Tech lines, at TL 12 robots of any sort 
are _just_ practical. By this we mean bean cans on wheels 
with a "yes <clank> master" mentality. But here\'s this illo 
and write-up of a pseudobio robot only a hair less 
convincing than AB-101! At the beginning of TL-12! 

OK, if the stated aim is to cover all milleux. But it 
isn\'t, all the stuff released so far is supposed to be for 
M0. BTW, was there some blurb about persecuted psionics in 
the JTAS adventure - haven\'t it to hand? I thought anti-PSI 
prejudice was about 700-800 Imperial. 

Still, more like CSC and JTAS please! I _especially_ like 
the landscape B&W art in JTAS. More! Bigger! Colour! :) IG 
are on the right track again.

She was integral to the computer systems and when she

"Mostly"????  :-)

Three problems.  One is that barely adequate food supplies are
not rare on the Earth either.  So if this reasoning were
correct we should be equally cannibalistic.

Also, the cannibals can\'t dominate and keep up cannibalism.
If the fittest are surviving better they become more and
more and more numerous compared to the non-canibals.
Then they either have to give it up or turn on each other.

Finally, the fact is the _anticannibalism_ is locked in genetically
and is why humans don\'t, in fact, resort to such things unless
faced with imminent death (and usually, exceptions not withstanding,
not even then).  Even if we ignore the previous, the fact that
cannibalism isn\'t good for social species would assert itself
after the population adjusted itself to meet the food supply
(and it will, cannibalism or no).

While the _relative_ lack of diseases (diseases won\'t be non-existant,
just less common) lessens _one_ of the problems the others
still remain.  Also, the main driving force is that the
dynamic of cannibalism make it hard to use for species
survival and nearly impossible for social species.

I think you miss my point.  Rather than trying to invent reasons
why the Vilani would be cannibalistic, it would be better
to say that such reasons are simply anti-Vilani propaganda.
That way it doesn\'t matter if they are flawed or
not and they still cast the same light on the Vilani.

>We\'ve had our Donner Pass and Andes soccer team incidents.

True, these are examples of how humans only resort to
cannibalism when faced with imminent death.  They didn\'t
do it because they want more protein in their diet.  What
is more these incedents are, in fact, the exception (which
is why they are so well known :-) and, even in the face
of starvation, on a few people will resort to cannibalism.

Now, faced with anti-Vilani propaganda the Vilani might
respond with counter charges, exagerating such incidents
among other branches of humaniti.  This might lead to
the prejudice amoung other races that humans are
prone to cannibalism.

Well, let\'s see.  The J-Drive is going to be broken up into zukkid (I\'m at
work, so I\'m not sure that \'zukkid\' is the correct name) crystal mounts,
controls, power supply, and fuel supply.

The fuel lines are going to be big, to accomodate the high demand just
prior to jump.  They will also be well insulated.  I seem to recall that
the crystals are cooled by the L-Hyd fuel as well, so there will be feeder
lines to and from the crystal casing, as well as valved to secure the flow
for crystal maintenance and replacement.  While most of the fuel
routing is probably accomplished prior to entry to the J-Drive room,
there will be some rather large, brightly colored emergency fuel
switches to prioritize fuel flow to the J-drive.  

The fuel pumps are going to be high speed jobbies and are going to require
a lot of power.  There should be primary and secondary fuel pumps to allow
for maintenance work and failure redundancy.  Again, there will be valves
for fuel control.

I don\'t have a lot of detail worked out for the crystal casing.  There
will be fuel pipes running in and out of the case, as well as high tension
power lines running into it.  There will also be Lanthium web connections
running to it, but I imagine it would be more of a buss running to another
control panel where the actualy timing and activation is controlled from.
I would anticipate that there will be viewports (possibly armored) so that
the crystals could be inspected visually.  Each crystal should have a
separate access plate or door for mainenance, possibly it\'s own
fuel/cooling line running in and out.

The jump reactor, from what I have read, is a reactor that runs for short
periods of time, generates a heck of a lot of power, then releases it in
controlled bursts.  It would have to be a fusion reactor (keeping with the
fuel type) feeding into a really large bank of accumulaters.

Your control station could easily be a standard workstation, but I would
imagine that the discrete parts also have guages and idiot lights for
redundancy.

Hope that helps, and I look forward to any further detail the I am sure
will be added!  :)

Actually, conservation of momentum is a well defined physical
concept and it say that velocity and orientation are
preserved in you reference frame (any frame, as long
as it\'s inertial and you keep using the same one).
The fact that you are displaced several light years
in the reference frame is irrelevant.

No.  You are 100 dia. away from World B, moving a 20 m/s with
respect to World _A_.  (Or more exactly, with respect
where World _A_ was, and was headed, a week ago when you

I\'ll weigh in and agree.  I think part of the fun with Traveller is
fitting things in between the cracks.  I run a fairly high tech game,
probably beyond the scope of most.  Nevertheless it is consistent with
Imperial Traveller TL15-16, and although I\'ve dragged players across
various VERY high tech worlds most Traveller players would be
comfortable.  No  FTL radios or tons of ancients artifacts here.

The modularity of players and concepts makes it interesting to me,
almost as if people were running in the same game.  Too much
inconsistency breaks structure down, because the shared universe isn\'t
really shared anymore.

Courtney called me tonight, and we discussed some stuff that might be of 
interest to you:

1)  All future T4 products will be reviewed by MWM at each stage of the 
process (on a chapter-by-chapter basis).  In the past, Marc wasn\'t passed 
a copy of the products in time to do a full review, when he was given 
them at all (as I understand it).  Now, Marc will be able to provide the 
benefit of his incredible imagination and knowledge as the products are 
created.  

2)  IG has some great stuff planned for Traveller this year.  

    a)  JTAS will go to slick stock with color interiors, and will 
generally look a lot more like a high-quality, mainstream magazine.  
There will be a monthly comic strip, an editorial, a letters page, and so 
on. 

    b)  Citizens of the Imperium will be beefed up with an ID card, online 
"inside info," product discounts, and so on and so forth.  Details still 
being worked out.

    c)  He\'s looking into an all-Traveller convention being held at some 
point.

    d)  Art for all future products will be produced specifically for 
those products; no more "generic" art!!  

    e)  The web site will continue to be expanded.  More links.  Also, a 
Sector-type map will be put in, with each of the fan sites appearing as a 
solar system on it which can be clicked on to go to that site.  Expanded 
support for the IRC on the website.  And so on.

    f)  Professional editing and graphic design will be used for all 
future products!

    G)  This year\'s Gen-Con will see Traveller with a far, far bigger 
presence.

In short, Courtney believes in Traveller, and he\'s devoting a lot of his 
attention to it.  With Tim Brown doing the day-to-day product 
management, and Marc Miller being involved at every step of the product 
design process, 1997 will truly be the year of Traveller.

According to page 116 of the main rulebook the risk of a misjump is 1 in 36.
(Which, btw. I think is a mistake. You could propably run an interstellar
economy with such a risk, but it would be a far cry from the one portrayed
in Traveller). 

With 1 chance in 6 of a misjump jump-1 travel becomes impossible and jump-2
travel a bad gamble (An average misjump puts you 10 parsecs away from your 
point of jump; once a jump-1 ship misjumps it\'s chance of ever making it 
back home is rather bad while a jump-2 ship may just make it back before
it misjumps again. most of the time, anyway).

    'body' => 'Gridlore Technologies, LIC, today unveiled their "Revelation" .666 calibre
hunting rifle to the press.

"Our competition said it was impossible, and wimped out with a \'compromise
design\' that was still unusable." said founder and near-legend Sir Arameth
Gridlore. "We at GT rolled up our sleeves and just built the damn thing!"

The Revelation is a conventional bolt-action rifle, firing a caseless 16.9mm
round.  Using advanced materials, the weapon is quite light for its size,
weighing in at a mere 19kg loaded (42lbs).  The rifle is 1.31m long, and
presents an oddly bulky appearance.  

Standard with the Revelation is a Mil-spec Electronic Sight, a bipod, and
mounting brackets for attachment to vehicles.  The weapon is designed to be
broken down into three groups for long distance portage.

GT deals with the problem of the rifle\'s large recoil by adding safety
features to prevent injury.  The safety will not release unless the weight
of the rifle is resting on the bipod or the system has been mounted on a
solid bracket.

Penetration and damage from the basic ball round were impressive, and GT
promises full support for the system by producing a variety of specialty
rounds for the end user.

Near the end of the press briefing, Sir Arameth became quite angry with a
reporter who asked if this wasn\'t simply a "can-opener" to be used by
anti-Imperial forces against Battlesuited Marines.

After a tense moment of silence, Sir Arameth commented that "If you want to
kill a Marine, just wait until he takes his helmet off and use a damn rock."


The REVELATION Hunting rifle (designed using 3G3)

Damage   TL    Range    Shots   Mass (loaded)  Cost
  8      12    Long      8(i)      19kg        cr 10424

If you still use signature from MT, this one is High.

Design notes.

This one took a few days, most of the work being done on CalTrain going to
and from doctor appointments.

The ball round is a 3:1 16.9mm lead shot.  It weighs 111.2g and uses 34.5g
of powder.  Muzzle velocity is 1076mps  3G3 DV for the base round was 169.

The rifle is simple.. most of the mass is in the barrel.  I chose to reduce
the weight by 25% at a cost of doubling the price..this is a rich man\'s toy.

The magazine is internal, and has to be hand fed.  The barrel is a bit
longer than necessary to get better range, and also to give me a little
breathing room on the Traveller damage figures.

If somebody disables the safety, and tries to shoulder fire this puppy,
break their shoulder.  I figure a *minimum STR* of 11 to even have a chance
at avoiding injury.  The weapon will automatically adjust for a new grav
field to determine what its "load on the bipod" should be.  Just let it sit
for about fifteen minutes in local gravity.

Do NOT use this weapon in 0-g.. unless you want to become an a very small,
fast bogie on somebody\'s sensors.

I\'m currently niting away at the specialty rounds.. DS rounds are giving me
the fits.  I might upgrade this design, but other than the novelty of the
calibre, it\'s not that great.

        Well, the Solomani progressed to civilization on a planet on which
they\'d evolved, and whose flora and fauna provided a broad and varied diet
that was extremely well suited for feeding humans... or rather, humans were
very well suited to eating it.

        The Vilani, OTOH, were abandoned on a distant planet whose flora
and fauna they\'d not evolved beside, whose biochemistry was sufficiently
different that it required extensive processing by specialists before it
became edible; not just palatable, but actually non-toxic.

        I\'d think that this completely undermines comparisons with Terran
cultures; the Vilanibbalism Hypothesis is based precisely on the fictional
fact (?) that conditions were different on Vland.  Just how different, we
don\'t know, since AFAIK nobody has ever written a treatise on the
biochemistry of Vland\'s flora and fauna or the nutritional value of early
Shugilli cooking.  We do "know", however, that there were warrior cultures,
and that humans were the only comprehensively nutritious foodstuff walking
around that didn\'t require extensive processing before it became edible.
And Canon does not say that the Vilani were *not* cannibals.  The record
doesn\'t further speak to us, and so we\'re left with what I think is a
strong prima facie case for the Vilanibbalism hypothesis, but no way of
conclusively proving or disproving it.


**************Reality Check!*****************

        What we are discussing is only a game, or more precisely, a
fictional background for a game.  Without more evidence, we could all flog
this horse until it was a crater a mile deep (and I for one don\'t feel like
wasting all that time and energy).  And unless someone comes up with canon
that\'ll solve it one way or another, I think we\'re better off leaving it up
to the powers that be to decide in future products.  If Marc wants to make
it canon, I\'d be pleased.  If he doesn\'t, big whoop.

        Furthermore, this is a roleplaying game.  Even if Mileu 0 had on
its cover a full-colour plate of a bunch of bloodspattered, drooling Vilani
wielding nasty sharp serrated steak knives on a well-done roast suckling
baby with all the fixings and a bunch of human body parts on meathooks in
the background, if you didn\'t buy the Vilanibbalism Hypothesis, you could
simply state that in your universe the Vilani were all exclusively
vegetarian, proceed to run your game that way, and more power to you.  In
my soon-to-begin Milieu 0 campaign, the fact that the Vilani were
cannibbals a long time ago but grew out of it is a minor part of the
background, and more power to me.  And that\'s all I\'m going to say.  I have
better things to do with my time than argue this one to death.

        Like design a set of HEPlaR-propelled rollerblades.  Or, more
precisely, a HEPLaR fanny pack to be worn while rollerblading; I figure
that it\'d be somewhat safer to have the center of thrust in the small of
one\'s back; that way you could accelerate real hard without your feet
flying out from under you.

The *real* killer is that the thrust/drag ratio is such that the drive
maxes out at a speed that isn\'t really worth the trouble. This is even
with the assumption that you can fuse regular hydrogen and convert all
the released energy into thrust.

    'body' => 'Hey everyone,

I\'m a memeber of this screenwriting list and I stumbled across this 
today.  I have no idea if this is a real Traveller movie, or if it is 
just a movie called Traveller.  But, it caught my attention because 
the name "Traveller" used two l\'s.

The author of this post that I copied this excerpt from is speaking 
about screenplay winners from competitions that have been made into 
movies.

You decide.

So, I\'ve heard some talk that there may be a Traveller movie.  I 
haven\'t heard any talk that the movie is already completed as stated 
in this post.

Does anybody know if this is the Traveller near and dear to our 
hearts or just a movie named Traveller?

To sustain the power grid, you have to use MW! That is to say I don\'t

I\'ve read somewhere that 35% of JD was an HPG (in FFS!). Seems to be this HPG. 
Several hours to load it? I don\'t have the FFS values in mind, but for a
200dt ship with jump 3 (might be usual) jump drive volume is around 120m3.
So the HPG is 40m3. Let\'s take 2MJ/m3 (which is oversized), the total is
80MJ which could be loaded in 2s allocating 40MW to the Jump drive HPG!

Remember, if you measure your *own* mass, it never changes. Only the
"apparent" mass of things moving very, very fast *relative* to you.

So I\'d say that the J-Drive has no problem as long as the apparent
density of the interstellar medium doesn\'t get high enough to interfere.

There are two schools of thought. One is that you emerge from J-space
with the same vectors (velocity, momentum, angular momentum, etc) as
you entered with. This requires the least "handwaving" to make things
match up to reality.

The other school has you emerging at either "rest" with respect to the
destination, or at whatever speed you choose to have when you entered
J-Space. The "at rest" optiuon isn\'t too bad. The other is just too
damned messy.

Note that matching the velocity of the new star system isn\'t all that
serious. Average difference is 50 km/sec. Extreme cases are several
hundred km/sec. 50 km/sec takes about 85 minutes at 1g to match. 300
km/sec would take about 8.5 hours. Not terribly demanding of your
average ship. 

And low thrust ships can make their "run to jump" in a direction that
will result in a more favorable entry vector at their destination.

You make some good points, but we don\'t know what the relative velocities 
of two star systems are. Sure, we could make it up, but then there\'s the 
work of converting from one to another.

Since we\'re changing universes, going from normal-space to jump-space, I 
don\'t feel the need to stick to Isaac Newton\'s or Descartes\', or even 
Einstein\'s frame of reference. For simplicity\'s sake, in my game 
jumpspace automatically transforms your reference frame to be based upon 
the nearest gravity well. This is jumpspace. Momentum is irrelevant. 
Physics is irrelevant. Resistance is futile.

What exactly are the ramifications of ignoring the law of conservation of 
momentum in this case? What kind of hairy paradoxes does it invoke? Am I 
truly out to lunch here?

Yes, according to DGP\'s SOM:

There is a high risk the jump field will not close if more than 10% of 
the ship\'s hull net is missing in any one location. How could this happen?
1. From any critical surface hit in starship combat.
2. Compute percent of hull net damage = (number of surface hits x 100) / 
hull disp
   If this number is greater than 10, then high risk.

High risk means more chance of misjump, and possible ship destruction.

I\'ve always assumed that energizing the grid is *highly* stressful. 
Thousands of times is *very* optimistic. Since the thing requires annual 
maintenance, and one can only jump (ie. charge the grid) 52 times a year 
maximum, my impression is that any more than a hundred jumps without 
maintenance and you\'re really cruisin\' for a bruisin\'

Another thing I\'ve assumed is the "thickness" and spacing of the grid is 
pretty much fixed, so you get a consistant and fixed (by whatever 
pseudo-jump-laws govern it) particle density. The geometry of the grid 
(squares, hexagons, swirls) doesn\'t matter, but spacing and density do.

The only argument I have against that is that is sounds *increadibly* 
wasteful and inefficient. Do you start with a 800 ton vessel, then 
progressively "evaporate" it down to 100 tons?

You really got your heart set on getting to another galaxy, eh?

That\'s why I\'ve never liked this interpretation. The problems you bring 
up start making things really messy. Fooling with the space-time 
continuum is, well, dicey. What if the ship blew up while making the 
hole? Can things be sucked through the "hole" because they happen to be 
in the way?

DGP\'s description of the Lanthanum Grid solved these problems for me. A 
light went on in my head when I read the Starship Operators Manual. 
There\'s no "hole". The grid creates a field around the ship which allows 
matter within the field to "blink out of existence" in this universe and 
enter jumpspace.

The only hole left is the vacuum in space where the ship was, which 
rapidly implodes btw. The ship doesn\'t "travel through" some hole it 
projects in front of it, like those nifty effects in Babylon 5.

Since the transition is instantaneous, if the ship blows up the only 
question is "did it blow up in this universe or in jumpspace?" If the 
answer is this universe, there\'s a neat cloud of debris orbiting the 
system it was jumping out of. If the answer is jumpspace, then a 
bajillion particles misjump across several dozen parsecs of space... :-)

See, these are the kinds of questions that can really *ruin* a 
thoughtfully crafted universe. Destroy an entire star system with a 
kamikazi and a jump drive!?!? That\'s just nuts.

Beings in jumpspace?! That\'s way too soft for me. :-) I like my Traveller

Excuse me? *Where* in CT does it say this?

Stars are moving *relative* to each other. Average velocity diff is
about 50 km/sec. So if you jump with a 50 km/s velocity "north", and
the destination star is moving 50 km/s north, you come in at rest
(relative to the star, you\'ll need about 20-30 km/s to match the
orbital velocity of the planet).  If the star was moving south, you\'ve
got to kill 100 km/s, then match orbits.

Now add in the uncertainty in *where* you come out. If you had a good
vector for coming out ahead of the planet, but your jump has you
exiting *behind* it, you\'ve got to make a big velocity change.

Best bet would to be to aim for a point "above", "below", inward, or
outward from the planet, and make your run to jump so as to help get
the right velocity on exit. 

Your velocity when you enter jump depends *entirely* on what you
measure it relative to. So it can\'t matter. After all, you may be
moving at several thousand km/s relative to the galactic core, or a
large fraction of c relative to some galaxies.

Just remember that it is *very* hard to get that hi-vee *pointed* at
the destination. You can\'t control your jump exit point that well.

I like the "galactic north" model because it explains *how* pirates can
be lurking. Fopr best fuel efficiency, folks jumping to a given star
would all head out for the same point on the 100 diameter sphere.
That\'s because accelerating out to *that* point would give them a
"good" vector for the destination, and save some extra manuevering upon
arrival. So that makes it a good place for a pirate to hang out. 

I\'d have to look up the rules on how uncertain jump exits are to see if
a similar trick can be pulled on incoming ships.

BTW, note that the preferred jump "point" moves as the planet moves in
its orbit around the star.

No, it\'s not. However, it *is* Megatraveller and TNE. Both had tractor

I meant to say that they were not much *longer*.  I seem to remember a 6

Make PCs and NPCs alike roll morale each time they are fired at with
weapons that can penetrate their armour. If they fail their roll the PCs
will go prone, run for cover as appropriate and the PCs should have an
initiative penalty that will make them do the same. These rules can be
extended to melee combat as well. The reason so few get get killed in
combat is that they will rather flee than stand and fight if the enemy
seems to have an advantage.

My system has used rules like this for the past 6 yeras and when we started
using them we noticed a dramatic reduction in the number of NPCs and PCs
that got killed.

    'body' => 'Folks, one thing I\'ve discovered very rapidly after getting my hands on
an FF&S weapons design spreadsheet was that with the advent of FF&S, the
entire Traveller universe -- design-wise -- shrank by an order of
magnitude. Most of this can be traced to the trashing of the
time-honored but annoying system of \'hard points\' -- now, if it fits,
you can put it in there, and screw the structural integrity. But the
greatest discrepancy I noticed is in the size of the ship it takes to
hold a spinal mount weapon.

Case in point: look at a MegaTrav-era TL12 E-class spinal mount PAW, the
smallest possible. Along with a power plant of sufficient volume to feed
it, it displaces a total volume of 120,000m3, or more than 8,000 tons!
Even if one were to make a battle rider of which about half was the gun
itself, you\'re still looking at about a 20,000-ton ship. In FF&S, I can
build an NPAW that does basically equivelant damage that will fit quite
handily in a 4,000-tonner. 

Whoah, said I, feeling the sands of gaming reality shift under me.

So I tried to build a 1,000,000 ton monster that mounted a gargantuan
NPAW, but I could not make a gun that would do more than 22-22-22-22
realistically fit into it. A meson gun did even less damage. The costs
of the armor and screens to defend against such weapons is far less than
the weapons themselves. Little guns on little ships do as much damage as
really big ones, until you get completely into the realm of the bizarre.

So where does that leave the dreadnaught? 

I\'m not picking at the rules; just wondering why, in the \'real\' world,
anybody would really build a military vessel bigger than, say, 30,000
tons. For that, you can have a decent-sized spinal mount, decent
manuver, decent armor, decent fighter compliment -- decent everything.
30,000 displacement tons is only a little bigger than the USS Nimitz,
but not quite enough to qualify as stargoing-dreadnaught size, at least
not in my imagination. I picture these things as massing at least
100,000 tons and perhaps sevral times that, each requiring the resources
of several systems to assemble & maintain. Empire hath its privelages,
and one of them is an economy of scale.

But as far as undiluted military applications go, a purebred warship
seems to top out around 30,000 tons. After that, you\'re just sort of
adding extra stuff that could just as easily go on a second ship. And
that kind of sucks, because massive dreadnaughts whaling the tar out of
each other is near and dear to the hearts of us all; and the biggest
crowbar in the fleet has always been the dreadnaught with some kind of
hellacious spinal-mount gun that was usually the rationale for building
a ship around it in the first place. Not any more, apparently.

The only rationale I can think of for the dreadnaught is station-keeping
capability; simply put, bigger ships can carry more stuff, and can stay
out there longer. A big enough ship can carry enough supplies to keep
itself out there for a year or more, perform disaster relief, show the
flag, carry out extended patrols, carry a small army in its belly for
suppressing rebellious worlds, etc. -- and still mount a healthy
offensive punch. I call this the \'system-control ship\' concept; sort of
a fleet-in-one. It\'s the difference between the Starship Enterprise and
a U-boat -- one handles all sorts of useful errands, plus fleet combats.
The other just sort of snoops around and blows things up. 

Can anyone else think of a good reason to justify the dreadnaught? I
haven\'t studied whether or not the bloody things are actually more
economical to build -- do you save significant amounts of money building
a few big ships rather than scads and scuds of little ones? That could
be the battlewagon\'s salvation right there... but if not, we\'re worse
off than before... geez.

So compare your little ships against the big gun-toting Goliaths you\'ve
built (of the same TL), tell me costwise where it\'s at, and otherwise
give me your informed commentary. Together, we can save the dreadnaught!
at least in my campaign....

Wrong.  I had this discussion with one of my players a 
while back.    He\'s an ex-Marine (the player, not the 
character), and he made a good   point.    The bayonnet has 
been standard military issue for over 200 years.    There\'s

his point.   <<

recall correctly. God! Must have been terrifying for the 
poor Argentines!

Hi folks,

Courtney called me tonight, and we discussed some stuff that might be of 
interest to you:

1)  All future T4 products will be reviewed by MWM at each stage of the 
process (on a chapter-by-chapter basis).  In the past, Marc wasn\'t passed 
a copy of the products in time to do a full review, when he was given 
them at all (as I understand it).  Now, Marc will be able to provide the 
benefit of his incredible imagination and knowledge as the products are 
created.  

2)  IG has some great stuff planned for Traveller this year.  

    a)  JTAS will go to slick stock with color interiors, and will 
generally look a lot more like a high-quality, mainstream magazine.  
There will be a monthly comic strip, an editorial, a letters page, and so 
on. 

    b)  Citizens of the Imperium will be beefed up with an ID card, online 
"inside info," product discounts, and so on and so forth.  Details still 
being worked out.

    c)  He\'s looking into an all-Traveller convention being held at some 
point.

    d)  Art for all future products will be produced specifically for 
those products; no more "generic" art!!  

    e)  The web site will continue to be expanded.  More links.  Also, a 
Sector-type map will be put in, with each of the fan sites appearing as a 
solar system on it which can be clicked on to go to that site.  Expanded 
support for the IRC on the website.  And so on.

    f)  Professional editing and graphic design will be used for all 
future products!

    G)  This year\'s Gen-Con will see Traveller with a far, far bigger 
presence.

In short, Courtney believes in Traveller, and he\'s devoting a lot of his 
attention to it.  With Tim Brown doing the day-to-day product 
management, and Marc Miller being involved at every step of the product 
design process, 1997 will truly be the year of Traveller.

Yup, I noticed that right away.  The good news is, IG is bringing on 
_professional_ editors, typesetters, layout specialists, and graphic 
designers.  So, future products will be far, far better in these areas.  
In the design area, Marc will be helping to design each and every book, 
providing the benefit of his knowledge, experience, and imagination.

On a related note, Marc Miller finally got to see the proofs for Milieu 0 
and First Survey.  He spotted several typographical errors and one 
glaring error (the sector in Milieu 0 is completely different from the 
representation of the same sector in First Survey).  [As an aside, the 
CORE group was told to use one set of sector data for the M0 book, and 
that the First Survey data would be changed to reflect that; 
unfortunately, that did not happen after the manuscript was turned over 
to the folks at AP&D.]  The books were about to be bound (again, MWM 
wasn\'t included in the process until recently; his inclusion now is one 
of the positive changes IG is making), so the process has been stopped.  
The erroneous pages will be re-designed, re-typeset, and re-printed, 
then the books will be bound.

The books will begin shipping the first week of February.  

Imperium Games and Marc Miller DO care about the quality of their Traveller
products, and they\'re doing everything within their power to affect the 
changes necessary to bring about top-quality Traveller supplements, 
adventures, and supporting materials.  You\'ve seen huge changes in the 
quality from T4 and Starships to Aliens and CSC.  You\'ll see another 
positive change with the release of M0 and First Survey.  Products after 
that will have the full benefit of the new processes and people that are 
now being brought on board.  In short, things are changing for the 
better, and they will continue to do so.  

Mark my words; 1997 will be the year of Traveller! :)

Yes, indeed, there is! :)  I\'m happy to hear you\'re having success with 
the games you\'re running on CIS.  I\'ve heard reports from others who have 
had success at conventions, and I\'ve heard from folks who have seen their 
FLGS sell out of T4 time and time gain.  The distributors are re-ordering 
the main book at a good clip and have been all along; they\'re starting to 
re-order CSC and Aliens at a good rate, too, now that their initial 
orders have sold through.  

OTOH, there are still spots where T4 doesn\'t sell well at all.  We\'ll 
just have to fix that by running some demos at those game stores. ;)

Nah, it\'s not our Traveller.  Someone just used the British spelling of

It\'s just a movie named Traveller; only Sweet Pea Entertainment has the 
rights to making a movie based on our favorite RPG, and that isn\'t it. :)

Has anyone who has seriously suggested this considered the food chain
implications? I mean, you all know the classic pyramidal structure with
plants at the bottom and man at the top (I presume) -- and the fact that it
takes a *lot* of plants to feed a herbivore to produce meat, which is more
efficient a food for men than plant matter and so on.

Well, OK, then consider this. Cannibalism in the form everyone seems to be
taking for granted misses the major problem. What do the "munchies" eat
*before* they become munchies? In other words, its mathematically
impossible to have a situation where cannibalism plays a significant role
in the Vilani diet *unless* there is a lot of *other* ("non-Vilani") food
to feed the "victims" in the first place.

In other words, its a chicken and egg argument. If you have to rely on
cannibalism for a significant portion of your food supply, then what do the
victims (who must also be cannibals) live on?

In other words, cannibalism as anything more than an interesting cultural
anomaly -- much the way it is on Terra -- is impossible.

Look at it another way, food supply is *the* limiting factor on population
size. Ergo, if there is not enough food to go around, then population will
be limited to whatever the food supply will support -- and there will be no
excess humans for "dinner".

And another factor. Did you know that eating humans (or other animals) that
have died of starvation is a *bad thing*? You get what is called *protein
poisoning* ... and it can kill you! Evidently all that is left in such a
case is too much protein. So, even in famine situations, unless you
slaughter people for food *before* the famine actually bites, the use of
"long pig" is not on.

A nice theory overall, but (almost) completely insupportable on any form of
logical basis!

From: Bill Prankard
To: Traveller
Subject: Planet X site to move this weekend.
Date: Tuesday, January 21, 1997 9:45AM

The following is a News Release from DSS-X "Planet X"

*FLASH**For Immediate Release**FLASH**
Dateline 021-0001 Re: Crisis at Planet X

Transcriped from the Commanders speach...

"Ladies and Gentlemen, it is with heavy hart that I anounce that Planet X 
has come under foul times.  Our new station, and our company, has been hit 
by an asailant as you know,  we believed that the computers and comm network 
were reinstalled, but apparently the agent had impregnated the system with a 
"time-bomb" virus program.  As a result, we are cut off once again from the 
outside, only our intrepid crew of Scout/Couriers will be able to get the 
e-mail through to our brethren at Sylea.  In the meantime the core will be 
dumped into space and destroyed. "

"But there is good news, we will be aquiring a completely new system, where 
all communications and computer control will be connected directly to me.  I 
will have total control over this new system, and because it is wired into 
me, I will be able to sense any attempts at intrusion if and when they 
occur, and be able to act accordingly.  If the hackers and slicers want a 
fight, lets see how they can handle our new cyber-link!"

Cheers can be heard within the vast auditorium within Deep Space Station X. 
 Everything from "Give \'em hell commander! to chants of "X" "X" "X".

This concludes this Press Release from X-TEK of DSS-X  "Planet X"

And now a reality check....

The people who so graciously allowed me to use their unused site area 
"Opp-Mag" aka my roomate\'s company, have apparently yanked the plug without 
so much as a warning to me.  It seems that when my roomate bailed out of 
that company to persue a new job offer, they thought that they no longer 
neede the account.  The account is currently on hold, meaning that I have no 
access to the site, nor can i get an IP connection at home for IRC.  The 
site is still there, but it might be wiped soon by the ISP administration.

But the good news is that by friday(payday) I will be creating my own 
account on Magicnet(this is the ISP opp-mag was on, there the good guys, and 
opp-mag is the badie!)  everything will be transfered there and i will have 
complete control over all(Muhhuhahahahaha!)

Mind you I knew this would happen eventualy. So I\'m not upset at this, much.

So this Saturday change your bookmarks for Planet X to
http://www.magicnet.net/~cmdrx
and the new email should be (by then) cmdrx@magicnet.net

Sory for any inconvienece this may have caused, but   "..Its not my fault! 
 They told me they fixed it!"

        I think that there\'s a differenceargely incompatible
biochemistries, remember...  This, IMHO, throws the Terran comparison off.
You could have any number of situations: foods where the caloric profit
after processing was so minimal that most energy was simply spent on
processing with little energy left over for anything else (and recall that
experimentation could often be fatal), food where certain key nutrients
were lacking, leading to malnutrition, foods that were plenty nutritious,
but led to a slow buildup of toxins in major organs, etc, etc.

        Or start farming people, or applying the death sentence to
increasingly minor crimes or types of deviance, or reserve the long pig
supply to the upper classes, etc.  Lest you plead inhumanity, I can point
to numerous 20th-century instances of group behaviour that were worse, and
completely wasteful of good protein to boot...

        Dude, have you got a reference for anticannibalism being "locked in
genetically"?  I did my BA in anthropology.  WHile that was four years
back, or so, I don\'t recall coming across any such thing.  Current wisdom
is that a lot of humanity\'s evolutionary success to date is simply that we
*don\'t* have much behaviour "locking in genetically"; we constantly
innovate, culturally speaking, and can adapt to almost any set of
circumstances.  And some of the innovations we\'ve come up with have made
eating deviants, criminals, and POWs as a dietary supplement look like a
Boy Scout badge project.

        And even if we have such a thing as a genetic predisposition to
avoid cannibalism, it does seem to be programmed to break down when needed
to survive, doesn\'t it..?

        I\'m not entirely sure what you\'re arguing in support of your
alleged "fact" that cannibalism isn\'t good for social species 100% of the
time is... but try and apply your arguments against slavery, or ethnic
genocide.  If they sound equally convincing, there\'s probably something
wrong with them, since history is rife with instances of both.

        It didn\'t stop the Aztecs... and they were one of the more
successful civilizations around until the Spanish showed up.  If you
recall, they were sacrificing people by the tens of thousands to their
gods.  While they weren\'t eating their sacrificial victims _wholesale_, it
isn\'t much of a stretch...

Without disagreeing with your conclusions, I seem to recall that the Nimitz
was roughly 30kt in earth water displacement.  Converted to Traveller
13.5m^3 tons, it comes a bit closer to 2kT in Traveller terms.  If I have
the displacement wrong, apologies.

I do think, though, that you have found a problem in the rules.  Fighters
have been made more practical, but big ships just do not have the role
which the game sort of seemed to imply for them.

I see several reasons for "Huge Ships" (IMO, >250KTd):
1)	Psychological Factor (two fold). Bigger ships make crews think they
might survive longer in combat... and impress civilians with the might of
the navy fielding them, whether civies in question are friend or foe.

2)	Huge ships are capable of carriage of HUGE numbers of small craft
and large craft (100-400 Td), and small craft can be carried in deep bays,
so the limit is launching capacity... hence launch tubes. DN\'s should be
hybrid "Combat-Carriers", with heavy numbers of defenses.

3) Also, most of the defenses are "unit" items (IE: they don\'t decrease in
effect due to increase in size of mounting craft) under MT; Under TNE, some
shifts occur, and the base size of defenses seems to shrink (but I haven\'t
done the math).


Under Bk5:HG (CT): Dampers are a true "Unit Item", as are force fields (TL
15+), and meson screens are a unit item, but POWER cost is proportional to
size. Sand is unit item.

Under MT:
	Unit Items: Dampers, Black and White Globes, Proton Screens,
sandcasters
	Semi-unitized: Meson Screens

Under FF&S
	Unit Items: Sandcasters, Nuke Dampers,
	Semi-unitized: Force Fields
	Proportional: Meson Screens, ERA, ESA, Tractor/Repulsor

	Notes:
	Force Fields are Black or White Globes.
	Semi-Unitized: Unit item to mount, proportional power by size

So large units get the scale efficiency of single unit mounts and multiple
sandcasters. Smaller units must spend proportionally more volume to protect
an equal total displacement than a single large vessel, assuming same
desired protection level.

    'body' => '     Before I left in December for my XMas break I already knew that
"Starships" had been released (and had read the bad news), but when I finally
made it to a game store a week or so after getting home I was very surprised to
find "CSC" and "Aliens Archive" there as well.  Now that I have all three
books, and am back at school, I don\'t know what everyone else thinks of the two
new ones, so I\'ll give my unbiased opinion:

GENERAL:  These IG books are WAY overpriced.  I don\'t know if they\'re getting
screwed by their printers or are making up for small print runs or what, but--
regardless of quality, by page-count and production values alone-- all three
supplements so far have been overpriced by about $10 (or more).  I have to
imagine this is scaring off potential buyers-- heck, I\'m a die-hard Traveller
fan and collector, but I had to make three separate trips to the store over the
course of a month before I accumulated all three books.

STARSHIPS:  I already have read what people had to say about this book before I
got it, and, unfortunately, I have to concurr.  With the SDS rules, the ship
stats (are they any different from the ones in the rulebook?) the
"personalities" (aka filler), and some smaller-sized illos, this could have
been a passable 48-page $8-10 supplement; instead it\'s, quite frankly, a really
terrible $20 one.  Those deckplans are truly a liability, as they\'re not only
practically worthless but also give a bad impression. Grade: D

CENTRAL SUPPLY CATALOG:  I really liked reading this book, with all the
anecdotal stuff and extra rulesy tidbits and such.  It\'s a shame, however, that
such good content was saddled with such bland production values and such an
outraeously high pricetag.  Had this book cost $10-12 and had slightly better
production values I\'d give it an A, as is it\'s only a B/B-

ALIENS ARCHIVE:  Admittedly, I haven\'t read all of this yet, but what I have
read seems "pretty good, but not spectacular."  Hopefully, some of these
seemingly one-trick races will get further development and depth added to them
through adventures and such (like was done to the original Major races).  Once
again, the boring layout and cartoonish artwork are a detraction, especially
since the price is so high (more apropriate would be $12-14, I think).  
Grade: B-

     Since resubbing this afternoon, I read that IG from now on is going to use
professional graphics and layout people, which strikes me as very good news. 
In two out of three of these books, the content is there, and just needs to be
presented more effectively.  I\'m still guardedly optimistic.
     What\'s everyone else\'s take?

	FWIW, the two ways I\'ve always considered doing it was:

	a) Each time you succeed at a hard task (i.e. low chance), you get a hash
mark. The hashes can be built up, and used as DMs on a task to gain a skill
level. The hashes aren\'t lost until you actually gain the skill

	b) Experience points are awarded _after_ a session using my own judgement.
Each player identifies a few incidents that _they_ feel showed good
roleplaying and use of skills, and I decide how much they\'re worth to the
relevant skills.

	Or possibly even the Air Force Academy (aka Denver Day Care Center for
Delinquent Youths). AFAIK, it\'s possible for a graduate of one  academy to
choose to be commissioned into a different service, although only a few
each year do so. I\'ve worked with Naval Academy guys who decided they
didn\'t want to go to sea or some such, and chose Air Force commissions.

	IIRC didn\'t CT have repulsor beams? Why, yes, my near-critically-used Book
5 lists repulsors as a defense against missiles!

	Although I agree--"classic Traveller" (as opposed to Classic Traveller)
never had much in the way of repulsors used as "tractor beams." And
definitely no FTL radios.

I have the ship emerge in the new system with exactly the same velocity and
vector as the largest local gravational source...the primary star.  The
difference in velocity and vector is dumped in jumpspace and as a photonic
discharge during the period just before the ship emerges from jump space. 
I don\'t attempt to conserve momentum, I just let jumpspace average
everything out.  

Just the way I do it.

Also, highly skilled crews can, using my misjump calculations, nurse along

The secondary effects I seldom roll; I just "feel" for it [note to PN: All
the time dialations over a week have been random rolls, not GM cruelty]
with an eye towards storyline.

Also, I usually impose a 1 point penalty for a previous misjump until an
inspection is made; normally I just have one of the following problems:
- --	"a Zuccai crystal is cracked, and will need to be replaced"
- --	"You need to clean the deposits off the Fusing Chamber"
- --	"You\'ve got hairline cracks in your Lanthanum grid"
- --	"Your jump governor has bad algorythms... it doesn\'t seem to match the
	specified part numbers for your drive..."
- --	"Your Fusion Chamber Gravitics are going
	out-of-alignment/phase/synch/unstable [pick one]"
The first: They are 0.5% of Jump Drive Volume, at 4MCr per Ton
displacement, and I assume them to mass 10 Tons per cubic meter (thus they
mass 0.675 tons, and take 67.5 Litres per Td of Jump Drive). The volume is
from High Guard; the mass from my common sense, and figuring what felt
right out of MT\'s 27T per 13.5 KL (TNE/T4: 0.7 Tm and 0.07 Td per Disp ton
of JD). Only a yard or spare crystals will do to negate the modifier.

Deposits can be cleaned any time the Jump drive is cool... IE, anytime more
than 24 hours after entering jump. Routine Engineering and Dex.

Hairline Cracks can be fixed with Lanthanum Alloy Solder, and EVA. Long
(1d6*1d6)+1d6 man-hours per 100 tons hull displacement.

Jump Governor: Replace or re-program. Reprogramming: Formidable, Computer
or Engineering, Int. Takes about a week.  Fatefull, Hazardous, Uncertain.

Gravitics: I assume gravitics have some role in Traveller Fusion plants
(after all, so many engineers get gravitics). So I assign some gravitics
roll to repair the gravitics involved with the JD\'s Fusion Plant.

Also, I assume that Jump Drives operate  by exciting a lanthanum (or
irridium) hull grid to a certain minimum quantum energy state, then pulsing
it in some pattern to "weave the tumble", then finally pushing it up to a
high level. The energized grid forms a bubble around the ship, which keeps
J-space approxamately  1m away from the hull, and also, the bubble has a
minimum curve radius of 2m. As the energy bleeds, it can be monitored. Due
to J-Physics, the bleed is almost trivial until return to normal space;
when it drops below threshold, the bubble collapses and the ship returns to
N-Space. The "bleed" is a quantum state change with a decay time of 1 week
in J-space, and measured in Plank units in N-space.

As a side note, a player once used this to sabotage a ship: he snipped a
path 4.2m wide in JUST the L-Grid, all the way around the ship, just behind
the bridge, then hid in engineering (Type T patrol cutter, BTW). When the
ship left dock, he overpowered the engineering crew, and  triggered the
jump drive. The ship was cut in half, then the aft (PC included) was
hollowed out by the Jump Field. They found pieces fo the ship over a 10pc
line.

Another Side Note: In my games, I assume that Irridium was used by the
solomani and vilani for their early (J-1, J-2) jump drives, and heve became
a very valuable metal. But it required half the spaceing interval, and thus
4x the area, of lanthanum, as well as 4 times the power (and thus drive
mass and volume). This assumption was made to justify the use of irridium
as the backing of imperial currency rather than lanthanum, which is more
strategic. Also, I assign Irridium drives a 2 point bonus versus misjump
chances, but they also take twice the penalties when figuring out how bad a
misjump is...;-)

There is no good reason to build dreadnaughts. . . . and there never
was.
Even in the days of High Guard it was more efficient to have smaller (10
- -
50 kTons rather than 100+ kTons) ships.  You got more bang for your
buck.

The rationale, IMO, for the classic 100kTon+ Dreadnaughts is that the
Navy/Governments like big, flashy ships.  They don\'t want decent
components,
they want the best components.  Size goes up accordingly.  When every
official is finished adding spec and chrome you end up with a monster
ship.
Not a very efficient monster, but a very, very flashy one.

Don\'t forget the Imperium is not continously at war.  As a matter of
fact they
are quite peacable when the long view is taken.  It is not a matter of
life and
death that their forces be the most efficient possible.  Inefficient
designs can
and will exist.  I\'m sure the military heads on this list can point out
any number
of currently in use weapon systems that could be better designed.  

The Traveller players obsession with efficiency comes from the
competitiveness
of the games (TCS, BL, BR etc.) and the simplistic models used in these
games 
(which allows us to very effectively measure the effectiveness of a
design).  
Political and economic factors are rarely if ever taken into account.
Perhaps
the dreadnaught sized warship is more effective as a political tool.
You don\'t need
a totally efficient fleet if you know that your neighbours cannot attack
you without
ruining their economy.

In short - my reason for the existance of the dreadnaughts (if you like
them).  They
look good, they impress the locals and . . . . why not?

it would be nice for people to tear it to shreds and tell me why it could

As far as i can see the only thing stopping us having laser weapons at the
moment is not having a power source strong enough to supply the power, i
think this is bulshit, 

My weapon would look a bit like a semi auto shotgun but instead of loading
it with buckshot cartridges load it with high charge capacitors, each
capacitor supplies one shot, there may or may not be enough energy released
in the discharge to trigger a brief burst from the laser to be of use, once
discharged the capacitor is ejected exactly like the shotgun cartridge.

Ok this is now open for ridicule, but if anyone wants to spec a Milleu 0

Well, what it\'s doing is changing the net momentum of the *universe*.
If you are using a reaction drive, the momentum of the "exhaust" and
that of the ship cancel. But if making a jump changes the ship\'s
momentum, they don\'t balance anymore. This may not sound like much, but
it changes the value of the "stress energy tensor" which means it is
changing the curvature of space and even of the entire universe.

As stated before I\'m Member of the English Civil war reenactment, my Musket
is a reproduction of a 17th Century Matchlock muzzle loader, the barrel is
48 inches long with a further foot and half of  stock, in the civil war
they didn\'t use bayonets, musketeers carried swords, muskets were aimed if
standing by using a rest (4-5 foot pole with a U shaped piece of metal on
top for the musket to rest in and a point on the other to stick in the
ground), maximum range was about a mile, maximum accurate range was about
150 yards, rate of fire is about 1 round every 2-3 minutes (less if your
not as careful and don\'t mind risking it blowing up in your face) the
reason for the length of time is that you have to readjust the match (a
piece of lit string) so that it is positioned correctly to set the powder
off in your flash pan, Flintlocks were faster to load and use, (due to no
lit match to worry about) but as we have found out they fire only about 1
in 5-10 tries (the sparks don\'t always light the flash pan, regardless of
what films show), the whole point of this post is to say that your hunting
rifle is not too long but im not sure about the weight, although it sounds
like an ideal sniper weapon.

Not so I\'m afraid. Before contact with Europeans the
NZ Maori regularly practised cannibalism. The practice
was highly ritualised and restricted to enemies who
had been defeated in battle (either as a mark of
respect or lack of respect depending on which
historian you read), but it was none the less a very
real fact of the culture. Most anthropologists agree
the root cause was the lack of high protein sources
native to NZ. What does this show about the Vilani?
Not a heck of a lot, but it does show that a highly
developed advanced culture can practice
cannibalism and in fact make it an intergral part
of their culture.

Sorry, but this *isn\'t* a fact. Far from it. The human species has a
*long* history of cannibalism. And of *taboos* to prevent it. If there
truly was a "genetic" reason, then you wouldn\'t have cannibalism
occuring in emergency situations. 

I\'m afraid that you are confusing your cultural conditioning with
facts.

Whether or not cannibalism is good for a social species depends
entirely on the conditions under which it occurs. And *being* both
social and intelligent humans use taboos to set those conditions.

I suggest that you take a good look at one of the *most* social species
known. Ants. Dead ants are eaten... by the other ants.

Killing members OF YOUR OWN SOCIAL GROUP is bad for the group. Killing
members of OTHER GROUPS is only bad for your group if it hurts your
group. And this is regardless of whether you eat them.

Let\'s just examine the *first* part of that statement a bit.

I suggest that a study of the existing antropoligical and archeological
record will show that cannibalism (if only ceremonial) not only
*occured*, but was rather common in primitive cultures. *All* primitive
cultures.

In fact, that\'s *why* it\'s a universal taboo. To quote Jubal Harshaw in
Heinlein\'s "Stranger in a Strange Land": "I can think of a lot of
people I wouldn\'t dare turn my back on if we didn\'t have a taboo so
strong you thought it was an instinct".

Which means that if nothing else, I rather suspect that the standard
means of disposing of the bodies of those who had died by natural
causes would be by eating them. This would conserve a valuable source
of nutrients, and be little risk. 

Given the "fact" that there weren\'t any diseases brought with them
*and* that they weren\'t at all related to anything else on the planet,
it\'d be a *long* time before anything evolved that *could* infect
humans. Much longer than has been available.

The only "diseases" present on Vland would be some bacterial/fungal
infestations where the organism was using the body as *food*. The
earthly equivalents are athletes foot, various "yeast infections", and
gangrene. Given the trouble the Vilani have making things edible, I\'d
say that such things would be relatively rare. 

And given the lack of true pathogens, the types of "infections"
described above would be easily defeated by simply washing regularly,
and in the case of "infected" wounds, merely by reopening the wound and
cleaning it with the one "antiseptic" known to primitive peoples....
Urine! (No, I\'m not kidding)

So while I don\'t see Vilani "hunting" for each other. I can see them
eating those slain in combat. And it would be their equivalent of an
honorable funeral. I suspect that the *worst* insult possible would be
to declare that someone *wasn\'t* fit to eat (much like the Catholic
practice of denying burial in consecrated ground to those guiltry of
certain offenses).

This give Vilani "cannibalism" a very different slant than the word
normally has. Strangely, this is actually *closer* to the way groups
like the New Guinea "headhunters" treat the matter.

This could rather surprise the first Solomani invited to a funeral, but
it wouldn\'t surprise one with a good grounding in anthropology.

If folks don\'t want to go this way, that\'s fine. Just don\'t try to
justify the decision with "facts" that aren\'t. :-)

Sorry this has taken me so long to reply to, but I\'ve been rather busy
recently.

I currently run a campaign set just outside the RC, and so
occasionally develop ships, personalities, etc for the RC.  Can you
tell me what you do, and how I could help out.  I have limited net
access (it basically consists of a mail gateway), so although I know
you have a web site somewhere I have yet to be able to visit it.

As an aside, do you know of any FF&S ship design spreadsheets I can
get someone to mail me?

they be able to \'grow\' non-toxic fungi and such on human hosts, where

a certain fungi that grows into enormous, painful lumps on his back,

you can feed the victims with the local flora/fauna, and feed the

It would be extremely unusual for a refugee from the Colorado Institute for
the Investigation of Prolonged Expouse to Low-02 Enviroments (aka
Brain-Damage High), to become a Marine.  USAFA doesn\'r begin to provide the
training in combatives that even USNA does.

CoC has gone through at least 5 editions.. nothing major, just refinements.
I think it has earned it\'s spot at the top.

To be honest, if Traveller had been rated by the four different sets of
rules that it has been, we might not have made the top Ten at all.

This issue reminds me of an excellent little CT adventure, "Annic Nova",
which featured a starship with a very alien jump drive that did not
require jump-fuel. Nothing was known about the strange human minor race
that created it. I believe somewhere the referee is told that they had a
civilisation far away coreward.

If you drop your assumption that the artificers lived 20-30 parsecs from
Sylea, then these gimmicks become more plausible. And more rare.

I am under the distinct impression that most of the anti-Vilanibilism

subsequently-formulated reasoning than by any real evidence to the 
contrary.  What do we \'know\' about the Vilani?  That NOTHING WHATSOEVER

which we are mutually pleased, I\'m sure) and this list (which I will 
regret to my dying day).  I have to PLAY in the environment he is 
developing, complete, no doubt, with slavering proto-Vilani on some

Famille Spofulam Yards.  If *I* can live with this stuff, you people

of misfires was supposed to be about 1 in 8 shots. On the field

It\'s actually in the supplement More Guns! (grin).  It\'s about the size of a
professional TV remote unit, and requires a heavy battery belt. Lasts about
30 seconds and does about equal damage to a 9mm.

Having spent much of last night bashing out a railgun, let me just say that
RESISTANCE is a pain.  So much of the battery-storage bank-beam energy gets
lost as heat!  This is how the real world works, so I\'ll kep working with it.

Using capacitors availible right now, this just possible.. but the disads in
weight and heat make a slug thrower just that more effective.

You need to remember that the capacitors are going to need to be \'shelled\',
and that they will have a considerable weight.  I could do a one-shot sniper
weapon like this... I\'ll give it a whack.

>Lets see you chew on this one.

Munch munch munch..

OK, a 1-shot, TL 8 laser with the stopping power of a 7.62mm NATO round..
I\'ll try it.

This what should have been happening all along!  It also explains much about
the Reign of Error.  No offence to Ken whitman, but I was appaled by the
thought that Marc Miller was approving of what was happeing.  Now I know he

I truely considered 325 a test run, and actually got more than I expected.
I\'m about to send of my first few submissions.. anybody else?

You know, I really need to hear more about this before I join.. I\'d love to
get Arameth Gridlore "registered" (he\'d howl with fury at the thought), but
I want to know exactly what i\'m getting for my $15.

YES YES YES!!!  Might I suggest someplace near a major NASA facility or

Does this mean the end of the Foss era?  Perhaps getting some talented new

So far I heartily approve of the new website.  It\'s informative, fun and
growing!  The map sounds beautiful.. I can\'t wait to see a star labeled
"Duck\'s Traveller Gateway".  Thought: Will the sites on the Web Ring be
linked by X-boat routes?

It\'ll be a nice change.

If GenCon happens.. evidently T$R is in big trouble.. but that\'s another
story.  Is IG interested in having demo teams?  I wiil work for t-shirts and
playtest copies!  now I just need to figure if I can make GenCon this year.

Tim Brown is a name I trust.  If I could pass one message to IG, it would be
Do It Right.  I was willing to wait months for the Regency Sourcebook, and
was not disapointed, so if it takes a few weeks to make sure the product is
good, take it!

OK, another question: Will there be a bug-stompted edition of the T4 rules?

        Which we know there was.  Admittedly, of lousy quality that
required extensive processing to render non-toxic, and which, in the early
years, may or may not have been ideal, but it\'s obvious that there was
enough to survive on or the Vilani never would have reached the stars and
given the Solomani that inferiority complex they\'ve been compensating for
ever since.

        Not at all; you\'re in a situation where you can live on pounded
fermented Blekk root and dried boiled Kuukietaass leaves, and possibly some
local animals.  Food processing may or may not (we don\'t have any
indication) require significant labour.  And then you\'ve got these annoying
individuals in the next valley over who taste pretty darn good (as they
should, they\'re the only naturally compatible protein source/nutritionally
complete food you\'ve got) and who may be competing for valuable resources.
What do you do?  You eat them.  An interesting cultural anomaly brought on
by Vland\'s unique food-chain situation.

        Well, it\'s insupportable if we posit a diet that\'s insufficient to
support humans.  However, if we posit a diet that supports humans, but does
entail ailments due to low amounts of key nutrients or slow fixation and
buildup of toxins or whatever, and tastes really vile to boot, then it
still stands up quite nicely.  As for the closed system argument, of
course; however, we are talking about a planet here, at a stage where human
society on it had not become globespanning.  Local groups had plenty of
room to expand by eating their neighbours.

        We "know" that there was enough food on Vland to support humans.
We know that it was a) of alien biochemistry and b) required special
preparation by a class of ritual specialists.  We know that the body of
knowledge held by these specialists was not acquired overnight, and we know
that the Vilani tend towards extreme conservatism.  We know that no local
microorganisms can infect the Vilani.  We know that the Vilani reached the
stars before any other branch of Humaniti, and established dominion over
the rest of Humaniti until the Solomani came along.  And we know that the
Vilani are no longer cannibals (at least in public :>).

        So here is my restatement of the Vilanibbalism Hypothesis that I
believe answers all the objections raised to date, and matches the facts
I\'ve just set out above:

       IMHO, in the very early days, I think that cannibalism almost
certainly had to have occurred on a pretty regular basis until a few bright
Vilani figured out how to process some of the less nasty local plant life.
However, it is doubtful that at least initially, the diet was ideal; enough
to support human life, but took a lot of energy to process or was lowish in
vitamins or you died at age 35 because your liver or brain got clogged with
alien proteins and stopped working.  And it probably tasted pretty
unpleasant to boot.  So I\'d think that cannibalism would have continued to
happen; this coupled with a need to acquire control of resources (including
slave labour), would have driven certain groups to expand, and groups
benefitting from a long-pig supplemented diet would have had an advantage
in such expansions over groups that didn\'t.

        In passing, I think that my model of the early Vilani diet is much
more likely than the alternative, i.e. that the Vilani, after abandonment
by the Ancients, immediately developed a fully nutritious, complete and
100% balanced diet based on foods whose biochemistry was totally alien and
which in the natural state were toxic.


        Meanwhile, the relative scarcity of long pig, and the quest for a
gruel that didn\'t taste like spiced formaldehyde, would have driven the
Shugilli to keep on experimenting; one doesn\'t become an expert
toxicologist/organic chemist/nutritionist overnight.  They would have
continued to improve the local food menu.  And since the Vilani didn\'t
carry any disease pathogens, the kuru/mad cow situation did not arise.

        As they began forming small states, they would would also have
begun encountering the social problems associated with statehood; larger
populations and the concomitant increase in crime and deviance that this
brings.  So, aside from putting their neighbours on the table, they also
began to feed on their criminals and deviants (thus bringing about the
well-known Vilani "the group comes first" orientation; model altruistic
citizens don\'t get eaten).  Eventually, as states grew, absorbed one
another and reached the point where long pig needs could no longer be met
by external wars, and crime was dropping because of deterrence and
elimination of recidivism, long pig became increasingly expensive.  By this
point, the Shugilli would have managed to assemble a menu that although
still vile-tasting, was much improved, and that could sustain humans
without resort to long pig.  Cannibalism would become much rarer,
continuing probably for taste reasons among the upper classes.

       However, in the meantime, it would have served as a psychological
incentive to innovate technologically (better-armed and equipped groups
rarely get eaten) and to expand (dominant groups are the ones doing the
eating; therefore you want to be the dominant group in your neighbourhood).
So, the extremely rapid Vilani technological advance and their drive to
subjugate the rest of Charted Space are explained: psychological and
cultural hangovers from cannibalism.

        So, I think I\'ve got the objections (food chain, closed system,
kuru/mad cow) covered here, IMHO.  I can still make a case for
vilanibbalism and do so in a way that a) matches the "historical facts" and
b) explains Vilani conformism/communitarianism, their rapid technological
advance, and their drive for conquest.

        **************REALITY CHECK***************

        My god I can\'t believe I\'m still doing this :).  I\'m behaving like
a philosophy prof and spending my morning fiercely debating unprovable
elements of a totally fictional fact situation :).  Seriously, folks, I
think that given the state of our "knowledge", this baby is unprovable one
way or the other (although I still think Vilanibbalism more likely than the
alternative; it fits too nicely).  So this whole discussion, although
amusing, is getting increasingly silly and pointless...

We took this chance to upgrade to Majordomo 1.94.1 which should address

Relative speeds between starsystems tend to be on the order of 50 km/sec
or so. This means that a 1G free trader will have to spend 1-2 hrs
matching velocities either before or after jump. Not a big deal, most of
the time.

Note that planetary orbital speeds are typically of the same order.

Well, the hairy paradoxes you get are no worse than the ones you get
from other Traveller voodoo technologies. If you want to play this way,
that\'s fine with me. But I don\'t think your rules jibe with canon;
whether you care about this is, of course, entirely your business.

	This isn\'t too far out of line. TNE had chemical cartrige lasers
which were essentially what you describe, but IIRC they were mostly quite
large, vehicle or tripod mounted weapons.

	The problem with carrying a bunch of capacitors around with a huge
charge is on itty-bitty hit on your capacitor supply and you go
Ka-BOOM....all that energy goes out very quickly.

	Second, while capacitors can store a charge for a very long time,
in practical terms, such high charges can only be stored for a
moment...what the power pack does in classic Trav lasers is charge the
capacitor for the laser which then fires.

This has been suggested before, and I think it\'s an excellent idea. If 
the \'owner\' then writes up \'their\' system, then it\'s even better.

A slight variation on the idea, how about IG selling Imperial Noble 
titles? Say, $50 for a Baron, $500 for a Duke (with modifiers for the 
desirability of the area governed). >>

Actually, thinking about this in bed last night (yes, I agree, that is 
really sad...), we could take it further. For a start, titles could be 
awarded as competition prizes, and for \'services to Traveller\'. Second, 
it could work almost like a vast PBM, with Nobles making trade 
agreements, marriages between families, feuds, etc - PCs could even 
interact with the \'real\' Nobles! JTAS could publish details of births, 
deaths, ennoblements etc, with contact details for the \'Player\'.

Thoughts?

I am not sure about these numbers.  Have you done volume/mass
calculations?   My brother, the scientist of the two of us, has done
calculations on the size/displacement of large Traveller ships.  He has
found MAJOR problems with ship size(Traveller in general.)  

The problem is the cube term.  As ship size lengthens, the volume goes
up roughly as the cube(obviously not directly.)  This gives a ship like
a Sylea 200,000 ton or a 750,000 ton dreadnought as depicted in MT
Fighting Ships a much smaller size than the artwork shows.  With current
ship sizes, Traveller\'s art has not depicting the correct ships.

My understanding, garnered from my bro, is that the Nimitz is about
75,000 tons.  That is the size of a 75,000 ton Planet Class cruiser. 
(For a depiction see Dave Golden\'s page under Naryanganjo Corridor.)

To get Star Wars size ships, the displacements must be on the order of
1- 30 million tons, for a conical/wedge configuration of 2km length.
Comparisonwise, a Star Destroyers is supposed to be 1km in length.

Feel free to comment on this-I need accurate and crosschecked info
before I go designing 1-30 million ton ships.  If need be I\'ll contact
my  brother, but he is currently at sea.

Today issue #25 of JTAS was delivered and I like it quite a lot.  It
arrived just in time to prevent me from unsubscribing from this list and
forgetting about Traveller (since AA and CSC have not reached my local RPG
store there is not much to keep me interested). 

Actually I like the looks and the contents of the magazine quite a bit.  I
believe that someone stated that the magazine is about the quality of a
typical SOTK publication but I really believe that it looks a lot better.
SOTK magazines (I usually read the Earthdawn journal) don\'t look that
slick and are somewhat rougher around the edges if you get my meaning.

I also miss the things that others already have commented on (e.g. a
column with some inside information from the designers about their work,
their plans, the thought processes that went into the creation of a
product, etc. would be very nice).  The illustrations on pages 37 and 48
are a bit... well... mediocre but all the others are wonderful.  The maps
are a little rough but it seems that Ashe Marler is slowly (very slowly)
learning to use his software.  Without having read the magazine I\'d give
it a 7 out of 10.  Good work.  

I\'m quite surprised at myself that I\'m now looking forward to CSC and M0,
but they got me interested once more :-)

I have to disagree with this statement.  This has been a long-prevalent 
Traveller myth, that the bigger ships were a waste of money.  The reality was 
that they were not cost-effective in High Guard/TCS matches.  The difference 
being that High Guard/TCS matches had a specific scenario and goal, and had no 
other factors involved.  Thus, you could get away with a ship design that was 
very cost effective in terms of bang for the buck, but served no logical "real" 
world function.  

For example, the famous EURISKO designs included a number of ships with one 
carried fighter (a mini-Battle Rider, really).  This set of designs did great 
in the TCS tournaments against other ships designed under similar constraints, 
but in reality a fleet is expected to serve many roles.  The Eurisko design 
might do well when attacking a similar squadron, but it could not transport 
Marines or land them on a hostile world, provide fire support for such a 
landing, or use clouds of fighters as a sensor screen around an interdicted 
world.  The Eurisko squadron would also not stand up to a 8-10 ship Battle 
Squadron of more "canon" Fighting Ships designs, simply because the EURISKO 
squadron was badly outspent, outgunned and outmanned.

Bigger ships do deliver a good "bang for the buck," but a lot of that bang is 
intangible in terms of your average TCS tournament.  An Empress-class 
battlewagon provides more than just ship-to-ship firepower; she can serve as a 
command ship, carry invasion troops, serve as a carrier and (perhaps most 
importantly) serve as a means of "Showing the Flag."

Actually, the plan is to send each work to Marc on a chapter-by-chapter 
basis for his review, as the chapters are completed.  That way, he\'s not 
given 117 pages a few days before it\'s supposed to go to the printer.  

Now that Marc\'s involved, and they\'re bringing on professional editors, 
typesetters, and graphic designers, I\'m confident that they can maintain 
their production schedule, while at the same time keeping product 
quality at the highest level.

I don\'t know how well that corresponds with real life.
Perhaps for trained and experienced infantry, yes.
But I know for a fact the #1 failure of un-tactics-trained
people or people who panic or forget their training in gunfights
(police, criminals, individuals defending themselves, etc. in the US)
is failing to seek cover and merely firing from where they were when
the incident started.  Any combat shooting tactics course will emphasize
training to go for cover before or as responding with a weapon,
and even some people who\'ve gone through those courses and train
that way don\'t do it in real gunfights.  Too many people get what\'s
called "tunnel vision" and concentrate on one or few attackers and
shooting to the exclusion of doing anything but shoot back themselves.

A "Ton" by any other name is still a ton...NOT!  

Folks, there are several terms all called "ton" that all mean something
different.  For example. . .

Mass tons:

	The Metric TON  =  2000 kg

	The Short TON  =  2000 lb

Displacement tons:

	The Traveller Displacement TON  =  14 stere (cubic meters)

	The Ship Register TON  =  100 cubic feet

There are others, but I don\'t have my references with me today.

Earth\'s sea going ships DO NOT use the Traveller Displacement Ton as a
unit of measurement.  My understanding is that the US uses the Ship
Register Ton.  It turns out that there are roughly 500 cubic feet in 14
stere (actually 494), and you can compare Traveller ship sizes to *real*
seagoing ship sizes by using a 5 to 1 ratio.

So, the USS Nimitz is about 80,000 Ship Register Tons, or about 16,000
Traveller Displacement Tons.  A 200 Traveller Displacement Ton Free
Trader, is compariable in size to a 1,000 Ship Register Ton Tramp
Freighter. A 10,000 Register Ton Cruiser would be listed as a 2,000 Ton
Traveller Cruiser.

A 30,000 Traveller Ton ship is a monster, with twice the volume of the
largest current warships.

A 200,000 Traveller Ton ship is the same size as a 1 million Ton
Supertanker.

If you want to compare ships from one game to another...or to real world
ships then you have to make sure you are using the same terms when you
make the comparisons.

BTW, you mentioned SW ships that are 2,000 meters in length.  Here are a
couple of approximations for ships of that size.

If we assume they are long thin cylinders, say 20x1, then your
dimensions would be:

Length: 2000 meters

Width:  100 meters diameter (width)

Volume: Length * (pi * r^2)  =  2000 * (3.14159 * 50^2) = 15,707,950
stere

Traveller Tons:  1,121,997 dt

If we assume they are triagular wedges say with, a base of 400m, a
length of 2000m, and a constant height of 20m then the dimensions would
be:

Length: 2000m

Width:  at stern, 400m; at nose, 0m

Height: 40m

Volume : 1/2base*length*height = 200*2000*40 = 16,000,000 stere

Traveller Tons:  1,142,857 dt

You\'ve all missed the *real* reason why you *Have* to have *really* bid
ships. They\'re ACVs ("Admiral Carrying Vessels") -- can you imagine an
Admiral being satisfied with the quarters that are likely to be available
aboard even a specially fitted out Cruiser?

And this is not being entirely smart alecky either -- Admirals require
large numbers of staff officers and related specialists -- and specialist
facilities for *them*. In other woirds, *BIG* ships are not really intended
for Combat per se, they are Squadron/Fleet Command vessels capable of
carrying large numbers of non-combat personnel and lots of C3I stuff
(Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence).

So there\'ll always be DNs.

Doug,

You are absolutely right.  As a representative of that esteemed mountain
resort, I can tell you straight up that the training isn\'t there to kick
someones butt on a continuous basis.

However, several points.  I would have gone to the Marines in a
heartbeat if I could have gotten a pilot slot there (I looked into it
when I was a C2C.) I believe every troop should be a soldier all the
time, and know the finer points of the art.  Like how to shoot and kill
unarmed if necessary. Unfortunatly, my eyes were slightly less than
20/20, the Marine cutoff(and Navy too.)  All I got offered was NFO(Naval
FLight Officer), the guy in back.  USAF gave me the pilot slot, for
which I am eternally grateful.  And thats why most people go to USAFA.

Although I am definately not a monster in unarmed combat, (and do not
box my copilot on a routine basis,) I have probably killed more enemy
troops in  than most ground pounders have seen.  I use technology to
destroy the people that my government tells me to, from as far away as
possible with maximum lethal force.  I am a hiver.  

Hivers are mean-if you don\'t believe so, read up on the result of the
little conflict they had with the K\'Kree.  The point is getting the job
done.

Now, who are the most powerful people on the planet:the burly SAS snake
eater killing Iraqis in the swamps(former) near Basra, or the pencil
neck geek studying for his EE class in a silo in North Dakota?  

One can kill in a heartbeat in 1000 nasty ways.  The other pushes a
button and our civilization ends. Just a thought.

I would imagine all references to "Auto Pistol" should be changed to

Ask any Navy or Air Force driver what type of ship they\'d rather attack
in the real world:  a light frigate or an AEGIS cruiser(usually
neither-ships is BAD.)  I go for the frigate if I had a choice.

The problem is that Traveller does not adequately simulate the
differences between small and big ships.  The amount of firepower a
dreadnought should be able to put out is MINDBOGGLING.  Ever been
barraged by 10,000 hadronic tipped missiles at a shot?  I\'ll bet a
EURISKO can\'t do that.
  
The one/two spinal mount limit is also wrong.  It is a game rule.  As
long as the mounts are put along the spine of the ship you should be
able to mount as many as you can fit.
  
Power is another item.  Big ships have lots of reactors.  Compared to 2
on an old chopped up US cruiser I am a bit familiar with, the big
carriers have 8+ nuclear reactors.  That is a lot of power to put not
only into spinal/bay/turrets but also into your sensors.

And there is the rub-where are the sensors of a ship in Traveller-in
cute little arrays?  No- the ENTIRE HULL is the sensor.  Bigger hull
equals better resolution equals deader enemies.  And big ships don\'t do
it alone.  They link with other ships in the fleet to become one large
sensor array and fire control grid.  He who has the better computers has
a distinct edge.

Look as US carrier battlegroup for further info.  Travelller is great,
but the issue of how the Imperial Navy really works has NEVER been
adequately addressed.  The game system was designed around the small
ship, and just doesn\'t model the scale of efficiency that comes with
size.

I am quite eager to hear any rebuttals, as my brother and I are in the
process of addressing this area.  Anybody interested?

Comprehensive feedback from the visionary and creator behind Traveller

Hopefully, the details will be worked out an announced within the next 
month.  Hold on tight; it promises to be worth the wait (as we\'ve all 
learned, it\'s better to take the time up-front than to rush something 
along just to get it out the door).

Oooh.  That would be very cool.  All I\'m hoping is that it\'s not too far 
away from where I live...or at least that it\'s held during one of the air 
fare wars. =)

I have no official word on whether Foss will continue to have a role in 
Traveller.  All I can say for sure is that all these changes will take 
time, and may indeed be phased in over the next several supplements (not 
including M0/First Survey, which (as mentioned previously) are already at 
the printers and almost ready to be bound).  And, remember, Ken 
Whitman mentioned a while back that there are some Foss pieces (both B&W 
and color) that were done specifically for Traveller supplements that are 
upcoming.

Well, since I\'ve already pre-registered for GenCon, it\'d darned well 
better happen. =)  And, not to spark a usenet-style debate, but I think 
TSR is going to be able to handle whatever difficulties it has; it\'s more 
like IBM (which was widely reported as being down for the 10-count a few 
years ago but now things look rosy for the computer giant) than, say, 
Atari or Commodore. [G]

That\'s the lesson that has been learned in the last 6 months.  We\'ve seen 
some changes already (shipping methods, the web site, CSC and Aliens, 
just to provide a few examples), and they have a lot more planned.  By 
the time GenCon rolls around this year, IG will have a solid line-up of 
more than a dozen products, all produced to the highest degree of 
quality.  That\'s my humble prediction anyway. :)


> OK, another question: Will there be a bug-stompted edition of the T4 rules?

Yes.  The official word is ... "Eventually."  So, I have no official 
date for that.  But if it were me, I\'d not announce a date for a version 1.1 
until I\'d sold out of 1.0.  But that\'s just me. :)

This would cause the population to just plain die off.  It
make little difference if nutrition is scarce because food
is not nutritious enough or it can\'t be found at all.  In
either case the population will adjust to meet the available
nutritional resources.

>food where certain key nutrients

If they are lacking, then they are lacking.  If they can be
synthesized in another member of your species, then they
can be synthesized in you.

But his kills off the people you want to eat.  If they
can survive in spite of this, then so can you.

To farm people, they have to be able to survive.  That means
you can survive.  If you can survive, then you are no worse
off than any other group on Earth that has gone through
periods of poor nutrition.

OTOH, in human history cannibalism is _rare_.  People that will
engage in mass murder won\'t resort to it.  There is a huge
aversion to cannibalism that occurs in all social species
and results from the evolutionary undesirability of cannibalism.

More importantly, the fact is that since the Vilani have not
more reason to resort to cannibalism (see above) than humans,
what reason is there to believe it would be more common there?

Gee, I haven\'t seen any references on _either_ side. :-)  However,
just look at human history, as you yourself have pointed out,
humans are willing to do any number of horrible things a lot
more readily than they will
>I did my BA in anthropology.

And I have a pH. D. in Chemistry, would you automatically give
in to me on anything regarding the physical sciences regardless
of how strong my justifications were?  (I would hope not...)

Also, think back to your study.  What happens to a society
that faces shriking resources?  There population shrinks
to fit the available resources?  Can you cite a single
group in human history that was ever maintained even
a subgroup of a society via cannibalism?

Yet we continue to be unwilling to engage in such acitivities
while persuing the others.  This just points to the strength
of the aversion to cannibalism.

Well, if you look at people that have gone through starvation, it
usually doesn\'t break down.  However, in any case cannibalism
can\'t help a species survive over any significant time scale.

Slavery doesn\'t reduce the number of the species.  Ethnic genocide
doesn\'t face the kind of aversion that cannibalism has.  As you
point out, humans are all to willing to engage in such practices,
but cannibalism of your enemies is very rare and never conducted
for nutritional benefit.

Actually it is.  Murder of your tribe\'s enemies is not only easy, but
seems to be a natural action for humans.  However, cannibalism is
rare.  Why should it be any more common on Vland.

development and publicizing of Traveller, what strikes me most is the shock of
realizing that these things were not done from the start.  Did the folks at IG
really think that they could put out quality products without professional
layout and design people, and without consulting the man who\'s name goes above
the title?  Especially at the rate of one a month?  If so, I guess we\'re lucky
that they got behind schedule so quickly and realized their errors before we
got loaded down with a dozen rushed and shoddily produced supplemets instead of
three (plus the rulebook, which I didn\'t think was all that bad).  
     Assuming that all of the mentioned changes actually go through, and that
the professional production staff is compotent, we shouldn\'t have to worry
in the future, but the problem remains that we\'re still stuck with one
god-awful supplement and two more "well-intentioned rough drafts".  Are there
plans in the works for a sort of T4.1 to fix these early botches once the
professional crew is in place? (and, if so, are those of us who went out and
sunk our money blindly into the 1st eds going to get some sort of preferential
treatment or are they just going to say "ha, ha, that was a joke, now give us
$20 more for the REAL Starships book"?)
     As I\'ve said before, I\'m guardedly optimistic about the future, as long as
the changes actually affect a positive change (which I can\'t imagine they
won\'t), and the folks in charge are able to effectively get the word out that
1) Traveller is back and, by golly, it\'s pretty good! and 2) the first products
were a sort of test-experiment and future ones will be better.

quite possibly could have driven the final nail into the Traveller coffin

I work for an animation company, and I got the president (well, his secretary) interested in 
the idea of Traveller as a cartoon. Unfortunately, I haven\'t heard back from them (sweetpea) 
in a while. Maybe if this list expressed its interest in such a project, things would get 
moving again. I cannot guarantee that this would work, but I can guarantee that I will try my 
hardest to get this going

Well, not quite. The ref ruled (and I kept to his ruling)
that at least 25% of the original object had to be
undamaged. Then there\'s the time requirement for the
rebuild based on the amount of damage. Rather than, say,
8d6 days for heavy damage, the ref changed it from days
to weeks and made the device use *any* molecules in
reach, not just free molecules. We actually lost a PC
during experimentation with the device when he got a
little too close. Since even light damage would take
1d6 *weeks* to repair, the device was rarely used; we
just couldn\'t afford to be without a ship for that
long.

Three things that determine a books price:
1-Small print run-Exactly right, the only cure is to spread the word and make
Traveller the hot publishing property it deserves to be. Or use the threat of
physical violence to force people to buy.(Not recommended) 
2-Extras in the book itself-Extras like glossy covers and colour plates. Ask
yourself if you really need a colour section, then respond to the publisher.
Most of them have web sites. The publishing industry has been promising lower
costs for illustrations and plates for ten years now, we should live so
long.....
3-What the market will bear-We as Travellers will just have to stop buying
products until they concede to our demands. AS IF!

Seriously, spreading the word and feedback to the publisher are the way to
keep costs down. I don\'t think prices will drop, but perhaps they will hold
steady. And before you curse the owner of your FNGS, the markup on books and
printed materials is just about the worst there is in the world of retail,
about 40%. As opposed to clothing (200%-400%) or jewelry (300%-800%). People
do have to make a living.

BTW, the list generally does not flame you because you post. I would hope that comments 
and criticisms are taken in context (yeah, I know, I should talk...I sort of flipped a long time 
ago because I was unused to the etiquette of netspeak and ordinary statements seem very 
hostile)

Seriously though, the US Army has  laser rifle now. It can only be used for blinding 
attacks, but the neat thing is the only defence is to close your eyes and keep them closed. It 
can rapidly cycle through various freqs to counter polarized lenses.

Well, I\'ll be the first. A metric ton is 1000 kilograms or 2200 Imperial
pounds.
All metric measurements are in powers of 10.

   First, great analysis.  Second, you do not have Gearhead Virus. 
Anyone with "gearhead" would have finished his or her demonstration with
a theoretical displacement for the Death Star (the original, not that
stationary gun platform in the third movie).

   I once speculated as to what *that* number might be, but then
regained my sanity.

P.S. First, you\'d need to know the diameter, after that, its a pretty
straightforward equation (volume of a sphere).  Of course there are all
the landing bays, laser turrets, and that Ultimate Spinal Mount....oops!

Thank you Eris, you make a great point, that being,
   "A TON is not a TON is not a TON"

I had to jump in here cause it is one of the few things I know about. :)

Registry Tons actually varry from country to country, but here in the US it
is 100 Cu. Ft.

Just a side note to those of you who keep up, the company I work for could
build a 1,000 Reg Tn. ship in 9-12 months and that would be the same as a
200 dt Traveller ship.  As I\'ve said before, I figure the times for the
future to be slightly less since we are talking about a much more detailed
desing and a completely enclosed hull.  Anyway, my formula figures the Free
Trader, the Yacht, the Safari, and the Far Trader all at 6m29d to 7m20d.
Unfortunately the Patrol Cruiser figures in at 4y5m12d and I\'m not really
sure why. :)  I\'m still working on it. :)

I suppose I should very briefly re-iterate the evolution of IG for those who 
missed it in times past:

The group that was doing all of the work for T4 (from designing, to 
editing, to laying out, to selling, to shipping) are a different group 
than those who will be doing it in the months to come, with a few 
exceptions (Tim Brown, Greg Porter, et al).  Once upon a time, the game 
designers were running the business end; as of November 15, 1996 Sweet 
Pea Entertainment took over the business aspect and in essence became 
Imperium Games.  Tim Brown started running the shipping department, and 
doing overall project coordination.  And so on.

So, those mistakes of the past were made by a different set of people 
than the ones who are in charge now.  Yes, those mistakes should have 
never been made.  But, please keep in mind that we are seeing the new 
policies of a different organization that simply has the same name as the 
one before ("Imperium Games").  

I hope this helps explain why things are changing.  It\'s not that 
Courtney woke up one day and said, "Dang, I\'m running this company into 
the ground."  [G]  It\'s more that, since Courtney took over the 
leadership of the company, he\'s been listening to us, the customers, as 
well as Marc and Tim, and putting into place the structures that will 
ensure that the pre-changeover mistakes never happen again.

Yes, there are.  Starships is being re-written (with REAL deck plans, and 
SSDS-designed ships).  I\'ve been told all of that will be freely 
available on the web site, as well as being included in a new version to 
be printed sometime in the future (don\'t ask me when, \'cause I don\'t 
know when they\'ll be doing a re-print).

T4.1 will be produced sometime in the future as well, as I\'ve mentioned 
in another post today.  Comprehensive errata is maintained on the 
website, and will continue to be expanded as new errors and 
inconsistencies are found.

Well, since they\'re making the new material freely available on the web 
site, I don\'t know that that would be necessary.  Of course, it would be 
a nice gesture on IG\'s part.  There\'s a location on the web site for 
sending feedback to IG.  Perhaps you should do that, and suggest it to 
them; it can\'t hurt.

The idea is to first make the product line complete (it still needs M0, 
First Survey, a GM Screen, and Emperor\'s Arsenal to be a truly full-line 
product).  Then start printing up posters and flyers for distribution to 
game stores.  Then make a huge splash at GenCon \'97.  That is, make the 
product as good as it can be, then make sure everyone knows about it. :)

BTW, yes, sales are very good even now.  Not just sales to distributors, 
but sell-through.  T4 itself is reordered heavily, multiple times, by 
distributors.  That means stores are selling out and reordering.  (Yes, 
it could be better; yes, there are places where T4 is a "shelf queen"; 
but sales are good now, and they will improve in the near future).

Right.  It\'s an example of the changes at IG.  First they fix the 
products that are in process.  Then they get better editing on the next 
products, and find someone to do better layout.  Then they bring on an 
artist to do book-specific art.  Then they ... well, you get the 
picture.  Like they say in all those Total Quality Management seminars, 
product improvement is a never-ending process.  T4 will just get better 
and better.

We\'ve played a role in that improvement in the past, by providing 
feedback to Courtney on the _Starships_ product.  We can continue to help 
make T4 the best role-playing game (not just the best Sci-Fi Role-Playing 
Game; the best RPG _period_) by doing the following:

- -  Provide feedback to IG through their website.  They\'ve got a tentative 
product schedule for 1997 there, and are asking for our comments.  Let 
them know what you want to see in those products!  Waiting until after 
the products are out won\'t be nearly as useful.

- -  Write articles for JTAS; submit art for JTAS.  If you don\'t, who 
will?

- -  Say good things about Traveller on the usenet, in game stores, and at 
conventions.

- -  Ask your FLGS owner if you can run a Traveller demo at his store; if 
s/he says yes, then do it!

- -  Run a Traveller game at a local convention, if possible.

- -  Most importantly, get some friends together and play!  If you don\'t 
have anyone local to you who wants to play, you can always start up a 
Play by eMail game, or run one on IG\'s IRC server.  If you need help 
learning how to do this, drop by the #traveller channel and ask; there 
are folks who frequent that channel who are experienced at running PBeM\'s 
and IRC games.

- -  Any other ideas for helping to make Traveller the most enjoyable and 
successful RPG of all time?


Marc Miller and Imperium Games will make T4 the best version of Traveller 
yet.  Let\'s help them wherever and whenever we\'re able.

Yes, please!

In my case, it isn\'t the phone bill, or even the time of night that\'s my
problem.  It\'s that I work until 9pm Central Standard Time on Thursday
nights, so I\'m not available when the Thursday night sessions take place.

But what happens if 50 trillion credits worth of EURISKOs goes up against

Does anyone have the EURISKO squadron available online?  Before I run off

I don\'t see this as much of an issue - you design p-plants large enough for
your weapons/sensor load.

But you get a better sensor picture from two small arrays with a lot of
seperation that communicate with each other than you do with one bigger
array.  I don\'t recall the exact term, but it\'s the technique used in
astronomy when they have a bunch of tiny dishes rather than one big dish.

Don\'t naval battlegroups coordinate defensive fire so that the whole group
engages incoming missiles?  I\'ve always thought that that should be the
model for the next generation of traveller naval combat, since my players
always seem to bring it up.

This argument falls apart - sure, a 30K cruiser is going to be able to
carry less cargo, but it needs less cargo as well.  Individual cruisers may
carry less troops/fighters/fill in the blank than a DN, but you don\'t
deploy them individually, you deploy them in squadrons.  As far as showing
the flag, the Navy doesn\'t send just the Nimitz somewhere, they send the
whole carrier group the Nimitz is in.

My personal design philosophy in HG (which was current the last time I
designed a bunch of ships) is to make a bunch of specialty ships, each as
small as practical - all other things being equal, I\'d rather have 4 50Kton
carriers, each with 900 fighters than one 200Kton supercarrier with 3600,
for flexibility of deployment, even if I end up paying 10% more due to
redundant systems.  Sometimes, suboptimal as it may be, it becomes
strategically necessary to control two systems, and it sure is nice to be
able to send half the squadron.

The systems are called dazzlers.  They have taken out pilots before, as
the Russians were fond of flashing nearby recon aircraft with them to
fry the pilots eyes.  Worked, but as far as I know the guys landed
safely.

Looking into a laser is like looking directly into the sun.  Of course
you don\'t see anything for a while after that.  Use of lasers against
personnel is illegal in the US Military, as far as I know.

I find this dubious.  Ritual cannibalism is not
unknown, but it has little to do with nutrition.
Also, I don\'t see how NZ is lacking in protein
sources.  As you yourself point out, the
cannibalism had to with attitudes toward
enemies (for example, we eat them to show
they aren\'t human).  This is known in other
parts of the world.  OTOH, I can\'t see how
the protein idea could ever be more than
speculation.

>What does this show about the Vilani?

Well, in fact the point still remains either way
that the Vilani have no more reason to resort
to cannibalism than humans.

Actually, bacterial infection would no more rare on Vland than
on Terra.  At the level bacteria work at, if humans can live
on Vilani foods at all then bacteria can live on them.  Also,
viral infections would not unknown either.

At primitive tech levels bacterial infections are just as

Axial Tilt 5=BA
Rotation period 918 standard hours 13 minutes
Year length 312 Imperial Days, 14 hours

        Skrunge is a small, old, dim world orbiting a G5 red dwarf, much of
whose radiation is towards the red and infra-red system.  Available survey
information, which is fragmentary and dates to IY -1900 (around the date of
the foundation of the Protectorate of Sylea) indicates that it is no longer
tectonically active.  Geologically, its relief, due to megayears of wind
erosion, is rather low and eroded.  Skrunge is becoming a smooth world.  As
it lacks any significant resources to be exploited, lies five parsecs off
the main trade routes, and is not blessed with a particularly salubrious
climate, to the knowledge of the IISS it has not been visited by humans
more than temporarily since the end of the Rule of Man.

        The most significant fact about Skrunge is its extremely long day;
it rotates once around its axis every 918 hours and 13 minutes.  Thus,
there are (roughly) only 7 days per year.  This has significant effects on
its weather patterns: night brings deep and cold winters, where
temperatures can plunge to -60=BA or worse at the equator; during the day,
they can reach approximately +40=BA.  Thus, the average temperature figure i=
s
deceptive.  It does not reflect seasonal variations, but rather daily
variations.  A typical day on Skrunge does not dawn; rather, it brings
clouds, snow and winds under a semi-permanent cold front along the sunrise
terminator as cold air rushes towards the day side, drawn in by a
semi-permanent low pressure area caused by insolation.  Naturally, these
effects are more pronounced in the tropical and equatorial regions; towards
the poles the weather patterns tend to be less predictable.  The poles are
permanently capped, although they naturally recede to a large degree during
the day; the subpolar regions are characterized by large runoff channels.

        The early morning snow rather quickly runs to rain, the
precipitation being fed by meltwater.  It dawns over flatlands broken only
by low hills and shallow, recently thawed sloughs.  Much of the land area
is swampy.  Taking advantage of the brief period of warmth and sunlight
(dim and ruddy as it is), the local life begins to emerge from hibernation.

        Throughout the midday, from the tropic to the temperate zones,
precipitation is rare, although occasionally weather systems do detach from
the semipermanent storms along the terminators and drop rain over the
noonday  regions.  By this time, plant life has carpeted the fertile areas,
and the herbivorous forms are harvesting it.

        Afternoon brings drought, as the surface water has evaporated from
almost all the deepest waterholes.  Plant life begins to wither, and many
animal life forms in the equatorial zones exhibit estivation responses as
the temperature rises towards 40=BA.  Late afternoon brings autumn rains,
which turns to snow in the evening.  Temperatures plunge rapidly after
sunset, which remains invisible from the surface in any event as a massive
semi-permanent blizzard redeposits water evaporated during the day on the
surface.  However, after 60 hours of blizzard, the skies have generally
cleared, and the stars look down over pure white snowfields frozen under
temperatures that dip to -60=BA at the equator and to -150=BA at the poles. =
 By
midnight the air is quite still and conditions remain ideal for stargazing
until morning.

        Skrunge is home to a wide variety of plant life, various parasitic
fungoids, and a number of animal life forms which are taxonomically rather
unique.  Most are herbivorous, although there are some filter feeders.
There are a few large predators, none of them weighing over 40 kg.  Many of
the animal life forms are low to the ground, huddled under heavy carapaces.
These seem to have evolved as much as protection against the wind as
against predators.  In general, the long Skrungian winter night has
directed evolution; many life forms simply freeze solid overnight and thaw
out in the morning.  Other burrow, some cluster, and some exhibit
combinations of all of these responses.  A variety of gestation strategies
have been noted.

        Archipelago, as all Imperial citizens know, is a favoured vacation
destination for wealthy Imperial citizens.  Although possibly the most
pleasant and salubrious world in the Imperium, and blessed with gravity,
rotation periods, and sunlight approaching the Terran norm, its distance
from Sylea and Ordun (3 parsecs) required at least a month round trip time
until the advent of Jump-3.  This naturally imposed restriction on visits,
combined with certain other impediments imposed by the Archipelagan
government (see below) has kept much of Archipelago unspoiled.

GEOLOGY:

        Archipelago is a water world; approximately 80% of its surface is
covered by shallow, warm seas; the remaining land surface is composed of
long, crescent-like islands with high ridges forming their spines that are
remnants of impact craters.  Other islands are of volcanic origin;
Archipelago is a young planet, geologically speaking.  Small polar ice caps
are present.  Its minor axial tilt does induce some slight seasonal
variation in climate; however, this means that winter evenings in the
temperate zones are only slightly chilly; the oceans act as a heat sink,
limiting the range of temperature fluctuations.  Regular trade winds are a
notable feature of Archipelagan weather.  Coriolis storms in the lower
southern hemisphere can reach fairly significant proportions, as there are
no crater rim barriers to impede their progress; the northern hemisphere,
on the other hand, has several crater rims that provide natural
breakwaters.

HISTORY:

Although settled early in the First Imperium (and named Miiliik, after a
Vilani mythological figure), Archipelago\'s position slightly off the main
trade routes and relative lack of valuable resources kept it from becoming
heavily settled.  By the fall of the First Imperium, the population was
approximately 2 million, and the major industry was farming Xuukaah algae
for export.  This Vilani plant form escaped into the wild; it is thought
that it has displaced many native Archipelagan algae.

        This was to change when the Solomani burst upon the scene.
Archipelago\'s potential as a nature preserve was recognized; Terra\'s oceans
were becoming increasingly polluted and innumerable valuable species were
threatened with extinction.  After occupation and renaming, the algae
farmers were allowed to continue, but intensive ecological terraforming was
begun; the Rule of Man government began a program of introducing terran
plant and animal species, geneerered where neccessary.  Notable introduced
plant life includes numerous varieties of bamboo and palm trees, among
other Terran tropical vegetation.  Animal forms include krill, plankton,
corals, and algae, numerous fish species (including sharks), and several
forms of cetaceans.  The ecosystem did not stabilize immediately, but
careful monitoring and adjustment over the centuries by several ecological
stations has managed to smooth out the worst of the population fluctuations
although long-term chaotic fluctuations cannot be ruled out.

        As with the rest of Humaniti, the Archipelagans, both the
descendants of the Vilani algae farmers and the Solomani biologists, found
themselves cut off from the rest of the universe.  Obviously, their
continued survival, or at least maintenance of a decent quality of life,
was dependent upon creating and maintaining as diverse an ecosystem as
possible.  The work of the biological stations was continued.  Over time,
the Vilani and Solomani populations interbred.  By the time of recontact by
the Sylean Federation in the middle of the Long Night (-900), the agency
responsible for running the biological stations, the United Worlds
Ecological Transplantation and Preservation Agency (or UWETPA), had assumed
governmental functions.  Seeing advantage in encouraging limited tourism;
the Agency, as it had become known, began opening resorts and expanded its
aquaculture activities for export.  This furnished it with the foreign
exchange necessary to purchase needed technology and raw materials.  This
role of resort and luxury seafood supplier has continued to the present.

SOCIETY:

        There are currently approximately 15 million native Archipelagans;
transient population is usually around 100,000, spread among Farrier, the
only starport, at the center of a rim island in the low tropics in the
northern hemisphere, and approximately 60 resorts scattered across
Archipelago.  Farrier has a population of roughly 2 million living long the
seashore and the base of the ridge near the tip of its crescent-shaped
island.  It is a major boatbuilding center (one of Archipelago\'s major
domestic industries, next to aquaculture and tourism) and the planetary
capital.  It is also the capital.

        The Agency maintains a rather benign and distant rule over the
population; the overall law level is rather low.  Many restrictions are
simply not neccessary, as Archipelagn culture has retained the traditional
Vilani communalist orientation, blended with an environmentalist
sensibility derived from its Solomani biologist forbears.  Crime is rare,
food is plentiful, and the climate and circadian patterns do not lend
themselves to seasonal affective disorders.  The one area where the Agency
rules with a heavy hand is in environmental regulation; as Archipelago\'s
artificially implanted and structured ecosystem is not as robust as
naturally evolved ecosystems, this is understandable.  Archipelagans go to
extreme lengths to recycle, use renewable, non-polluting energy sources
wherever possible (wind and solar generation is extremely common, although
=46usion+ units are becoming popular), and in general have a highly develope=
d
ecological sensibility.

        This preoccupation with environmental protection will become quite
apparent to off-worlders at disembarkation.  Rigorous customs controls are
in place when exiting the starport (although they will not bat an eyelid at
armament that would be illegal on Sylea, discovery of non-native biological
specimens wil result in immediate deportation and stiff fines), and
departure taxes are high.  As well, although refined fuel is available, it
is quite expensive, as it is mined from the local gas giant by subsidiaries
of Ling Standard and Famille Spofulam.  Local law prohibits ocean
refuelling.  Finally, a high departure tax is imposed.  These measures
serve to increase the cost of a voyage to Archipelago, and are a deliberate
disincentive imposed by the Agency to limit the number of visitors.

        However, once past the formalities at the starport, Archipelago is
an extremely pleasant planet.  The predominant means of transport is by
water; Archipelagan naval architecture tends towards catamaran and trimaran
multihulls.  Sail-powered vessels are extremely common, taking advantage of
the trade winds that blow through the most densely populated latitudes of
the planet.  Architectural materials use local stone, along with coral
blocks, bamboo, and other woods.  Modern materials tend to be reserved for
use where they are most needed.  Farrier offers some of the best seafood
restaurants anywhere in the Imperium, and its low pink and white coral
houses and winding streets contain many pleasant little boutiques.  The
many resorts in the Out Islands are sybaritic in the extreme.  And the
Agency is determined to keep it that way.

        In the tradition of the Sunday Follies and Grand adventure posts,
I\'ve decided to post events occurring in my newly begun Milieu 0 campaign
to the TML.  I\'ve titled it "Long Day\'s Journey..." for reasons which will
eventually become apparent.  I\'m using the vanilla T4 rules, with some of
my own SSDS-designed ships and FF&S weapons.  The only supplement to the
basic rules that I\'m using is Glenn Grant\'s hit location table.

THE CAST:

Isaac Xyroli: a young, brash, and arrogant ex-Scout, currently working for
Ling Standard as pilot on the Frozen Glory, a FSY Mouffette-Rapide class
far courier.  Played by the TML\'s own Ross Coburn.

Leemcha Quo: Ascetic no-nonsense 35-year-old Asian/Vilani ex-Navy
Astrogator.  Carries a pair of FSMOMAE Gunchaku-2000\'s (description to
follow) in her luggage.  Played by a non-TMLer.

Dr. Ilbren Dinaskir: A Vilani archaeologist of humble origins, specializing
in the Rule-of-Man period, who rose to his present recently tenured
position due to his own brilliance and not to his humble origins on an
algae farm.  Played by TML\'er Glenn Grant.

Lt. Jack 23: A strong, silent, dangerous type with "military" written all
over him; formerly a marine, now working for Ling Standard Security.  Has
manged to overcome his underprivileged youth as an orphan in a Solomani
Genetic Collective rather nicely.  Again, played by nobody you know.

Lt. Kyle Deschenko: A nice, genteel thug from one of the best of families.
Despite coming from a well-off family (SOC A), he nevertheless managed to
get sent to a military academy for his youthful misdeeds.  After a stint in
the Navy, he spent some time as a Rogue before getting hired by Ling.  Has
every weapon-related skill save Heavy Weapons.  Likewise, played by a
non-TMLer.


THE SETTING:  Sylea, Year 0 Day 1: Cleon has just made the Restoration
Proclamation, the Imperium is hours old, and the parties are going strong!
Some months ago a small company of gas miners launched a massive
artificially constructed comet made of specially treated exotic ices.  At
the moment of Cleon\'s coronation, a grid of explosive charges blows the
insulating carbonaceous crust off its surface, and what looks remarkably
like an Imperial Sunburst begins to bloom over Sylea.


EPISODE 1: Grav Bikes and Gauss Guns are Tools of Ill Omen.


 Scene 1:       The game began with Dr. Dinaskir and Dean Dr. Dr. Dr.
Hengabar Zuukaash riding a grav lift to the roof of the Imperial Institute
for the Advancement of Learning.  Dr.^3 Zukassh, a short, portly
whitebearded individual who looks like a sinister Santa Claus is telling
Dr. Dinaskir that his chances for tenure track access have substantially
increased due to unexpected corporate largess, and that their colleague
Dr.^2 Hereish has unexpectedly departed for a sponsored dig.  They arrive
in the rooftop gardens in time for a massive academic bunfight; those
members of the Astronomy department who brought their own telescopes to
observe the comet are particularly popular.  Dr. Dinaskir becomes engaged
in conversation with a pleasant young teaching assistant, and we switch
to...


        ...Scene 2:  Lts. 23 and Duschenko meet at Ling Standard\'s Security
offices and are briefed on their mission of industrial espionage; armed
with Gauss SMGs and heavily disguised, they are to meet a mole in a Tukera
weapons-research subsidiary who will pass them a disk containing vital
information.  They will be sent in instead of the usual case officer
because there is some risk that the drop will be compromised.  Alternative
getaway routes are to a secluded spot on a neighbouring noble\'s estate, or
as a last resort, to geosynchronous orbit, where a ship will be waiting to
collect them.  They proceed to arm themselves and are disguised
accordingly.

Scene 3: Isaac and Leemcha board the Frozen Glory, taking delivery of the
brand spanking new vessel from Famille Spofulam Yards at Sylea\'s high port.
The crew is rounded out by the engineer, Kliraad Yraesh, a convival and
friendly ex-Navy 04, and Shikaaraashii Maabaashii, the shy and retiring
gunner/steward.  They take possessions of the ship and launch for a
shakedown cruise.

Scene 4: Lts 23 and Duschenko arrive at the site of the drop (a trendy
rooftop eatery closely modelled on Montreal\'s Club 737).  Duschenko arrives
by the elevator, Lt. 23 flies a hotwired FSGT Ludaccel-20 grav bike in.
The mole is met, the disk is handed over, and then an Iliant Lion, with a
laser-rifle wielding passenger, suddenly flies up the side of the building
and pops into view.  The mole expires in the first laser drive-by in recent
history.  Lt. 23, who was handling the drop, dives over the bar.  General
panic ensues; diners mill about screaming.  Lt. Duschenko does nothing
until the grav car confirms its hostile intentions by further firing upon
Lt. 23, at which point Lt. Duschenko hauls out his SMG and hoses it down
with remarkable effect.  The car drops out of sight behind the building,
its driver trying to ground it before his emergency power supply fails.
Fleeing the scene, Lt. 23 is forced to dissuade a diner from Blurring Lt.
Duschenko by pulling a gun on him.  In a commendable display of
self-restraint, he doesn\'t fire.

        Running across to the other wing, where the grav bike is parked,
Lt. Duschenko trades shots with a laser-armed grav cycle, but to no effect.
Boarding the grav cycle, with Lt. 23 driving, they dive off the side of
the building, with roadgrid control and safety cutoffs disabled.  On the
way down, a shot from the hostile grav cycle perforates the coolant housing
on their power plant.  They experience a near-collision with a grav truck
as they dive through the traffic stream.  Realizing the seriousness of
their situation, Lt. 23 tries for the orbital extraction, by pointing the
cycle straight up and accelerating at 15 Gs, thereby breaking the sound
barrier in city limits and rendering himself and Lt. Duschenko unconscious.

        Some blocks away, Dr. Dinaskir witnesses their sudden and
spectacular departure.


Scene 5: Meanwhile, in low Sylean orbit, the crew of the Frozen Glory is
putting her through her paces when they recieve a call from Orbital Control
requesting that they rescue an out-of-control grav cycle that has gone on a
ballistic trajectory.  The trajectory in question being uploaded to them,
Pilot Xyroli hastens the ship to the scene, overloading the thrust plates
by 100% (a capability which those funloving guys at FSY designed into the
craft), and puts the ship into hover right at the grav cycle\'s expected
apogee.

        Lt. 23 comes to in a rather overheated and crowded grav cycle
interior that smells of burning insulation; the power plant has given up
the ghost and his nav computer shows them to be on a lovely parabola that
will land them in the ocean several hundred kilometers downrange.  Lt.
Duschenko awakens shortly thereafter, and offers him a slug from his hip
flask of Varg spirits as a means of making re-entry a more pleasant
experience.  They stoically admire the comet as they approach apogee.

        At apogee, however, they are snagged by a line fired from the
Frozen Glory, and Maabaashii, the gunner, reels them in through an open
cargo door.  the doors close, and Maabaashii holds them covered with a riot
gun.  The fact that this might not be their designated pickup filters
through to both Lieutenants.

        Approximately 10 minutes thereafter, the flight crew of the Frozen
Glory detect unauthorized boarders; figures in battle dress appear in both
airlocks.  Pilot Xyroli immediately applies full 100% overloaded thrust and
cuts the intertial compensators, and begins corkscrewing the ship all over
the sky.  One boarder tumbles the full length of the spiral staircase
connecting the bridge and crew quarters to the lounge, doing severe damage
to the woodwork.  Everyone down in the cargo hold kisses deckplate hard and
long.  Lt. Duschenko loses consciousness yet again.  After some minutes
spent like this, with loose objects getting thrown all over the ship, a
boarder manages to finish hacking into the ship\'s computer system and cuts
the drive.  The boarders blur the pilot, stuff Lts. Duschenko and 23 into
rescue bags, and EVA them across to their waiting Moonshine RI/ESS.

        As it happens, the boarders were actually 23 and Duschenko\'s
pickup, who had to make an unexpected descent down to LEO and board the
Frozen Glory in order to complete their mission. They remove Duschenko and
23 from the bags, stuff them into grav tanks, and proceed to rendezvous
with their transponder, which they\'d left in another orbit entirely.

        The Frozen Glory, piloted by Leemcha as Isaac is still Blurred,
proceeds back to the high port for questioning by the authorities.
Everyone is debriefed.


Scene 6: Roughly a week passes.  Lt. Duschenko convalesces, the crew of the
Frozen Glory go over their story one more time with the police, and Lt. 23
enjoys his hazardous duty bonus.  Then, Dr. Dinaskir is summoned to the
Dean\'s office.  The Dean informs him that Ling standard has a) suddenly
endowed a chair in Rule of Man Archaeology for Dr. Dinaskir, and b)
requested that he begin excavations on a dig at Skrunge (planet description
to follow) at once, laying on a courier ship and providing him with all the
equipment required.  He rushes of to pack, flush with the heady realization
that he is now tenured.

        Lts. Duschenko and 23 are summoned to their superior\'s office, and
informed that they will be leaving at once on a mission to Skrunge, posing
as company reps.  It seems that the disk they collected contained archival
data pointing to a Rule of Man era secret Solomani weapons research
facility there.  They are to stop for refuelling at Archipelago (planet
description will follow) en route to Skrunge, and pick up some security
troops and gear from Ling\'s subsidiary there. They are to preserve secrecy,
ensure that the mission remains uncompromised, and to generally ride
shotgun.

        Xyroli and Leemcha recieve comm calls to the effect that they are
to take on passengers at the high port and proceed immediately to Skrunge
via Archipelago.

        Meeting at the ship, the archaeologist and the Lts. board.  Takeoff
ensues.  Conversation is at first awkward as the Lts. are quite aware that
Xyroli was responsible for their being slid all over the cargo hold floor
at 8 Gs a week previously.  Xyroli, never having seen them, has no clue.
At any rate, they depart at 4G\'s for jump point.  A Vilani meal cooked by
Maabaashii (which proved to be almost edible) serves to loosen tensions.
Conversation centers around Dr. Dinaskir\'s speculation that his colleague
Dr. Hereish might be headed for the same site, and the session ends with
Dr. Dinaskir and Lt. Duschenko drinking late into the night.

        And that was that.  Next game is next Wednesday.

concealing four barrels of 13 X 65 mm shotgun carnage!*  To the uneducated
eye, the Gunchaku-2000 appears to be a simple pair of nunchaku, with
textured plastic grips at each end.  In reality, the grip at the chain end
of each chuck twists and retracts to reveal a custom-built individually
loading shotgun reciever, then slides forward to cock the action.  Twin

You\'re welcome, Paul.  I started trying to compare historically ships to
Traveller designs 20 years ago and noticed *something* wasn\'t quite right.

I didn\'t know they vary from country to country.  All the numbers I\'ve seen
have been in US or British publications, and I think they both use 100
cuft/reg ton.  And thanks for correcting me, it is Registry Ton not
Register Ton.

Just because something occurs doesn\'t mean that we aren\'t
genetically predisposed against it.  In any case, as
it becomes irrelevant.  A poster arguing in favor
of cannibalism talked about cannibalism being "a taboo
so strong you would think it was an instinct".  Well
not only are instincts difficult to sperate from
other causes, but the relevant point is the strength
of the taboo, not the source.

The fact is that a species, regardless of conditions, can
never make up for nutritional resources over any significant
time scale by cannibalism.

>Killing members OF YOUR OWN SOCIAL GROUP is bad for the group. Killing
>members of OTHER GROUPS is only bad for your group if it hurts your

But if cannibalism is the edge you need to survive or propsper,
that other group will die off and you still have the same
problem.

Cannibalism is, for a species, the same as eating yourself to
avoid starvation.  It can never help except in the very
short term.

Gee, and I\'m under the impression that the other side is basing
their arguements on the desire to invent reasons for Vilani
to be cannibals so they can add another gimmic rather than any
real justification for believing it would be true. :-)

(The "motivations for posting" arguement always cuts
both ways and never proves anything....)

On the other hand what support is there for the idea that
cannibalism did occur?  There is a rule of thumb that you
get on suspension of disbelief to set up the setting.
After that, if you keep asking the reader to accept things
"just because" things start getting hokey.  To me, this
applies here.

The problem is that the energy stored in a capacitor is:
	E=.5*C*V^2

E = Energy in Joules
C = Capacitance in *Farads*
V = voltage in Volts.

While you *can* buy 10 Farad capacitors (about the size of a beer can)
they can\'t handle more than about 50 volts. That gives a total energy
of 12.5 kilojoules. Which won\'t do more than give you a nasty burn (if
that). The dielectrics that allow such high capacitances *can\'t* handle
high voltages.

Weapons grade lasers require *megajoule* energy levels. And you can\'t
cram that much power into a capacitor that you can carry. Also, if I
managed to hit such a capacitor with a round from an ordinary rifle,
the results would be about the same as a satchel charge going off. 
Or at the very least, a grenade. 

The problem is energy *density*. That is, how much energy you can cram
into a kilo of "battery". And we just can\'t do it with current
technology. As it is, the best energy densities known are explosives,
and liquid fuels. 

So not only are laser (and gauss!) weapons ruled out, so are electric
cars with decent performance and range.

	Go to Orc\'s Nest, 6 Earlham St, just off Cambridge Circus, the junction of
Charing Cross Road and Shaftesbury Avenue. It\'s not far from Virgin. Take
the south-east road and it\'s just a few yards down there. Don\'t rely on
Virgin as they\'re not very specialised and don\'t always have a clue. Orc\'s
Nest had all the four T4 books in the last time I looked; T4, AA, CSC and
Starships. Call them on 0171-379-4254 to get them to hold a copy. Also,
Leisure Games in Finchley has the books in too. They\'re on 0181-346-2327.
Good luck!

	The Virgin Megastore in Oxford Street is local to me too, I work in Euston
at the top of TCR. Fancy lunch sometime? ;-)

	See ya...

As Steve Charlton says, I over emphasised my point about DNs being
useless
in the first paragraph of my mail.  I maintain however, that I pointed
out later
in my mail that the real purposes of DNs are not modelled by games such
as
TCS and BL.  These purposes being political and economic.  For example,
"Showing the Flag" as pointed out above.  Another reason for their
existance I
mentioned being the fact that the designers and clients want their ships
to be
the best, the biggest and the flashiest (the Admiral factor brought up
by Phil
McGregor).

I actually think we are all in agreement.  In time of war with an
approximately
equal or superior enemy your navy should consist of fleets which are
most
efficient at destroying enemy warships (the scenario modelled by the
various
Traveller tactical games).  There is no real place in these fleets for
DNs.

However the 3rd Imperium has never been in this situation (neither the
Zho\'s
or the Vargr were a real threat to the survival of the Imperium as a
whole).
Since this is the case the navy is more multi-role.  It\'s purposes
include the
ones mentioned by the various posters (ferrying around admirals in
luxury,
impressing the natives, increasing internal morale and boosting civic
pride).


Addressing some points by Tom Lane (since he specifically asked for
rebuttal,
although this is realy just comment)

>Ask any Navy or Air Force driver what type of ship they\'d rather attack
>in the real world:  a light frigate or an AEGIS cruiser(usually
>neither-ships is BAD.)  I go for the frigate if I had a choice.

I won\'t be suprised if I\'m corrected since most of my knowledge of
modern
naval warfare comes from reading Tom Clancy, but . . . .
Is it not the case that we (that is the global we) no longer have
Dreadnaught
class ships?  and as a matter of fact most navies are downsizing their
ships?
Based on the name I\'m fairly confident that the Aegis class is not a DN
class.
The question is not really relevant then, since both ship types
mentioned
would have a place in a TCS type squadron.
I would restate the question as \'Which would you rather attack, the
Bismark
with updated point defence systems and all the modern naval toys or a
battle group of (say) 10 Aegis cruisers.\'

Because of the way hardpoints worked in High Guard/TCS the basic rule
was that if you did a good design job you always got the same firepower
when you spent a certain amout of cash (and used the same secondary
criteria such as Jump and Maneuver ratings).  Putting this all into
larger
ships had two effects, reducing your flexibility and increasing the
chances
that a lucky critical would take you out.  Someone should confirm but my
understanding is that this is still basically true under FF&S.

>The one/two spinal mount limit is also wrong.  It is a game rule.  As

Very, very true.  Spinal mounts are the gods of the battlefield in
Traveller.
Under High Guard/MT where a ship could have only one spinal weapon
it was incredibly wasteful to have a large ship with one SM when you
could
have two smaller ones and therefore double your SMs.  With FF&S it\'s not
as bad since you can add more SMs to the one large ship.

In High Guard, once you go above a certain size, there is no point in
going
any larger.  There is no economy of scale.  Increased size just reduces
flexibility.

If you want reasons for the existance of DNs don\'t look to the mechanics
of
ship combat for them.  As has been said the only feasible reasons are
not
modelled by the various ship combat rules, but rather are in the
roleplaying
area.

On the point about how the IN works.  They key thing to remember is that
the Imperial Navy has many purposes.  One of these is to impress people
(both citizens and outsiders) with how large and powerful they are.  DNs
fulfill that role well.  
Another purpose is to provide a credible defence against agressors.
Super-
efficient ship killer squadrons do this best.
There are many other tasks which might be assigned, some of which have
already been mentioned.  These various tasks can be completed most
efficiently by task specific ships or squadrons, or, in the main, by DNs
or
other large ships types.  Perhaps with less efficency, but maybe with
greater
flexibility.

Oh, wrong game.

Anyway, until I put more detailed notes in Emporer\'s Arsenal assume that most
pistol-class weapons have ammunition at 25Cr per 100 shots and 1kg per 100
shots. Rifles will be 50Cr per 100 shots and 1kg per 100 shots. Military ammo
is usually APDS and is double cost and half weight, most of modern ammo mass
being the projectile, and if you use a subcaliber penetrator, mass goes down
drastically.

Assume if a planet\'s Law Level heavily restricts or regulates a weapon that
ammo cost is doubled again, at least.

Imperial Squadrons, 112 Pages	October 1997

That isn\'t an assumption, it\'s a deduction. If such artifacts are present in
sufficient numbers to be sold (albeit at inflated prices) on the open market
then where did they come from? Not umpteen parsecs to coreward.

I\'ve had a chance to page through a copy of CSC and it appears that these
relics are salvaged from derelict Rule of Man ships. The notes claims that
the technology is understood by the Syleans, and that they just don\'t have
the technological support to produce them. This implies that RoM was at
least borderline TL14, which is _a mistake_ (Or, since CSC is an official
publication, I suppose I have to call it a change of the canon). I
personally think it is a bad change since another canonical fact is that
the Imperium dosen\'t reach TL 13 until Year 300 and TL 14 until... (was
it 700?). Making the RoM TL 14 and the Sylean Federation borderline TL 13
is, IMO, a Bad Idea.

Besides, isn\'t one of the points of doing Mileau Zero to make it different
from the other Traveller settings? Why then erase as much of the difference
as possible this way?

But we, outside of the game, also know that the Ancients set up the

in which it would not have evolved naturally. The Vilani may have
not had to learn everything the "hard way".

Now, I may not be 100% right here, but the thing with kuru/mad cow
disease (I can\'t spell Croitsfeld-Jacob) is that it isn\'t a bacteria
nor is it a virus - it\'s some wierd protien thing that can only be passed
through eating other people... even when the meat is cooked, frozen,
boiled and blanched (with a touch of bernaise sauce) the dan thing is
still there. That\'s why this whole "mad cow" thing is such a problem -
the only way to prevent the disease is not to eat meat that might
contain it! "Canon" says that there were no problems with bacteria 
or viruses on Vland, to a major extent, e.g. no flu, no black plague,
no chicken pox, etc. But again, mad cow disease works through a
completely different and distinct mechanism and cannibalism may be
the cause of one of the few diseases known on ancient Vland!

Well, I think kuru is still a problem, though it\'s only a problem for
"large-scale" cannibalism - it still might happen now and again on
those old inter-village attacks.

Well, in all actuality sniper fire has a different effect than when an
M-60 is spraying bullet after bullet in your general vacinity.
When a shot is heard (as in from a sniper), you either:
Drop where you are and find cover
Run like hell until you find cover (of course only staying up for 3
seconds at a time)
or start unloading everything you have in the general area you believe
the sniper to be in (this is really only effective at squad and platoon
level).

Another use of the Russian (ex-soviet) military of lasers is in the more
modern tanks.  They use a high powered laser for rangefinding
capabilities, but the laser shoots farther than the tank round, so the
would frequently use the lasers to blind enemy troops, tank commanders,
anything.
Or at least that was in my briefing before I rolled into Iraq.

No member of CORE can do so at this point.  We developed the CORE sector 
in the manner we were directed to; however, there have been changes, as 
previously announced, due to inconsistencies between the M0 manuscript 
and First Survey.  Perhaps Marc will tell us what it will be like.

As for me, I\'m happy waiting another couple of weeks until I can see it

Frankly, I\'d rather attack the AEGIS cruisers-one or two hits and they
go down to Davy Jones Locker, if I can choose my method of death. Just
as many missiles are going to be flying.  You can hit a Bismark many,
many times and it will not sink(except for specific critical hits by our
redoubtable allies, the Brits.)  Depending on how it is built it may not
even be disabled.  This has to do with increased armor, although the
superstructure is not heavily armored.

I ask myself why dreadnoughts came into being in the first place, if
they were so "useless."  At the time from the late 1890\'s to 1914, ships
were the only masters of the sea.  A cruiser historically could not
stand in the line of battle, as the larger guns(equalling range and
firepower) the dreadnoughts carried would simply chew them to pieces
while the cruiser shells bounced off the dreadnoughts armor(if they
could even get in range.)  Ships got larger for BOTH prestige and real
physical reasons, as in wartime smaller less armored/gunned ships would
lose.  

The US last design for a  US dreadnought was USS ALASKA around 1946. 
Designed towards the end of WWII, she was 1000\' long, had eight main 20
inch guns and a plethora of sub guns that would be considered main
armament on smaller battleships.  Her purpose: 

To engage TWO Yamato class Japanese (18inch gunnned-biggest in
world-ever) battlewagons and defeat them in single combat.  THAT is a
dreadnought.  I\'ve seen the blueprints.

Put 10 cruisers against her and you\'ll have ten dead cruisers. 
Traveller doesn\'t even come close to simulating this-the people who
designed it did a good job, but not in this area. 

Why are there no dreadnoughts in the US Navy now?  Well, in a sense,
there are.  Arleigh Burke and Tycho class AEGIS cruisers are called
cruisers. They are really the modern battleships.  Currently missiles
are the vogue, not guns. You don\'t need a huge ship to mount the
enourmous barbettes for the old turrets anymore, just a large ship to
carry the VLS and replenishment magazines.  Airplanes are today\'s ship
guns-very long range and precise. Battleships today specifically refer
to older gunned ships.  This may not be soon in the future.

(It was pretty well known in the US Navy that if they had to go toe to
toe with a functioning(big assumption) Russian boat they would be
hurting.  The Russians knew how to pack weapons on a ship.  They just
didn\'t know how to keep them functioning.  They were called crusiers,
but could have wrecked a US Iowa class with the huge weapons they could
employ!)

Did you know the USAF is soon to build the first airborne laser missile
defense?  In a 747. (Laser Turret TL7-8.)  I have a good rumor that at
least one US carrier has a space specifically provided to mount a
particle accelerator(obviously not fielded yet.)  The US Navy is
designing smart hyperballistic guns with 120 mile range.  You need to be
fairly big to carry these, and have lots of juice.  Maybe not a classic
dreadnought, but still the sea superiority ship that has always ruled
the waves.  Crusiers by definition cannot stand in the line of battle
against a superior ship.

A gameism not resembling reality. I agree with the loss of flexibility,
but dreadnoughts are designed for one main pupose: to defeat the
enemies\' best in a head to head engagement the line of batttle.  

TCS is very much a game, designed to be an approximate simulation of
reality.

Additionally, you are assuming the equal interstellar economies of TCS,
that everyone has the same amount of cash to expend.  This is just not
true, otherwise the US would be in the slagheap the FSU is in.  Economy
is just as much a part of war as the military.  Buy what you can, the
best you can.  If the enemy can\'t match you they lose.

Yeah, but why make them smaller if you don\'t really have to?  The
example of the Alaska is my submission.

> Another purpose is to provide a credible defence against agressors.

They may have a better presence, but again if your opponent throws
invulnerable ships against them they DIE.  Invulnerable ships?  No such
thing?  Well, it depends on your universe.  While it is possible the
future may conclude battleships to be wasteful and worthless, that is
not what caused the governments of the early 20th century to engage in
the greatest naval buildup in history.  It was so scary they got
together and wrote the Washington Naval Treaty to slow down the arms
race-the arms control talks of the day.

Simply put-if you go by the rules of TCS(and maybve HG) you deny the one
principle the 20th century showed about ships- the big ship is basically
invulnerable to smaller ship armament.  

What\'s my fix if you want to see the game more resemble reality? 
Reengineer the system so that larger, particularly longer spinal mounts
have more range and much more firepower.  Make screen effectiveness
dependant on hull surface area-it should be!   Then you will see the
results I\'m talking about.I freely admit Traveller isn\'t like that. 

And it is wrong.

Look forward to further discussion on this.  I would like to see a way a
cruiser can really make a difference, as it would help my players a bit
in theri upcoming campaign.

You\'re probably right, but since the Vargr in question a) had a stupidly

Yeah.  Did you know that one of those "designators" will boil the skin
off your face and light your clothes on fire at fairly close range.  Not
sure that is a handheld designator, but I know USAF designator pods
will.

They will also permanently cook your retina if you survive the fire. 
USAF issuyed us laser protective visors over in the gulf, although they
probably would only work against one spectrum of light.  

This is a big issue in the USAF now.

Not really.. a sniper won\'t shoot until he has a target, and that target is
going to be a worth-while one.  (Radioman, leader)  Supressive fire makes it
clear that you *will* die if you try it.. part of the effect is the noise
which makes it hard for the pinned troops to get organized.  If you pin the
guy with the radio 3 meters from the leader who can call for support.. well..

If you have a good choke point (a hallway, narrow cleft, bridge, etc.) than
one or two marksmen can provide an effective holding force.  You won\'t
really be supressing them, since the enemy will have the ability to try and
shoot back, but you can deny them access to their route of advance.  And
never forget that Mr. Grenade is your friend.. nothing causes morale checks
like having a metal baseball bounce into your immediate area.

It\'s usually called "aperture synthesis," though a lot of other names are
used for particular flavors of the technique.  And the key realization is
that you *don\'t* get a "better picture" from two small separated arrays
than from one bigger array.  Aperture synthesis allows you to get (most
of) the *resolution* of a single array of diameter X using two (or usually
more) smaller arrays separated by distance X.  You still can\'t match the
larger array for sensitivity, though...the big one will be able to "see"
sources much fainter than what\'s visible to the ap-synth version.

To put it another way, resolution is a function of total cross-beam extent
of your collector; sensitivity is a function of total cross-beam area of
your collector elements.  Extent is easy; area is hard. 

It\'s also worthwhile noting that doing ap-synth requires that you know the
precise relative placements of the collector elements to within (at most)
one-quarter-wavelength of the emission being detected.  For radio/radar,
that\'s pretty easy, as the wavelengths run from a millimeter up into the
meter scale, and even at the short end, TL8 technology can put multiple
sensors on a single vecicle to the required tolerances.

However, doing ap-synth between multiple mobile platforms, maneuvering in
combat, separated by significant lightspeed delays (as has been suggested
on this thread) strikes me as highly unlikely.

That\'s always been the concept.  Before Aegis, the coordination of
defensive fire was to be handled by human fire-control teams constantly
chattering back and forth between the vessels, and nobody really expected
it to work very well under a truly intensive missile attack; you\'d always
end up with five defensive weapons engaging incoming missile A, while B
through E sailed in unmolested.  The Aegis system is intended to overcome
this problem by putting target selection for an entire cruiser or carrier
group under computer control, but the system has never been tested under
live-fire circumstances.

You\'ve got a contradiction in terms here. G stars are Yellow, not Red. Size
II stars are HUGE. Dwarves are tiny. Your hospitible zone you list later of 8
makes more sense if this were indeed a Size II star. I don\'t have my MT Ref
Manual with me (I\'m on my lunch break at work) so I don\'t know where the H
zone is exactly. Dwarves put out so little heat that at orbit 8 the temp

A type G star isn\'t red; its brightness peaks around the green part of the
spectrum, and it appears yellow-white to the human eye.  Our own sun is an
example.

I\'m not sure what you mean by "Size II".  If Rhonk is a G5 II in the
astronomical sense, it\'s a giant star, similar to Canopus.

Otherwise a very well thought out world, by the way.  Make Rhonk a K5 V or
so and you\'ll be in business (I have serious problems buying non-tidally
locked habitable worlds around M V stars, or I\'d suggest that -- though
it\'s clear Skrunge is on its *way* toward tidal locking).

Which in turn adds more weight.  How much are you willing to haul around?  I
don\'t know if you\'ve ever worked with liquid nitrogen, the bottles are heavy
due to the insulation needed.  Add to this the *very* heavy capacitor, the
lasing apparatus, the "furniture".. you are starting to look at 30 or 40

Well, if I can get a team to your silo, breach it, and disable your ability
to launch, I win.  Specwar does train for that you know.  The British had
plans to sieze civilian targets near Soviet SRF bases and threaten to
slaughter the civilians if the forces launched.  Scary stuff.

We\'re working from different viewpoints - I\'m not talking about an equal
numbers game, but an equal cost game, ie your 5 trillion credit DN vs my 5
trillion credit squadron.

USS Stark is an example of what I try to avoid - at least with the old HG
rules, a cruiser can be made with the same armor factor as a DN, for the
same volume percentage.  The whole concept of Virus disgusted me enough
that I didn\'t get any TNE material, so I can\'t speak for FF&S.

Except that DNs are not nigh invulnerable, and never have been.  In HG/MT,
the squadron\'s multiple spinal mounts will do the job quite nicely on the
DN before it can really hurt them back - if it is lucky, the DN may take
out one squadron member with a lucky critical hit before it is finished off
by her sister ships.  From what I\'ve read on the list, things only got
worse for the big boys with FF&S.

I\'ll concede that one on one, a DN can take a cruiser, but cruisers and
battlecruisers are only going to be deployed in squadrons, especially in
war time, and the squadron is going to do in the DN just about every time.

I went to my first computer conference at the New York Hilton about 20
years ago.  When somebody there predicted the market for microprocessors
would eventually be in the millions, someone else said, "Where are they

Years later, I went back to the same hotel.  I noticed the room keys had

He\'ll be soorrryyyy......  I once fired a Barrett .50 that had sand in the

There must be a purpose for each naval design.  What is this design going to
accomplish.  The Traveller style dreadnaught has always been a multi-purpose
ship.  Sent to a troubled area, it can be a display of force, land troops for
various purposes, provide in system escort duty by way of carried fighters,
support ground troop operations, stay at duty station for an extended period of
time, provide help and support during natural disasters, etc.  Along with all
of this it can put up a heck of a fight in a major battle.

If your looking to outfit a run and gun quick strike force a smaller more
speciallized ship may be what your looking for.  If you want a multi-purpose
general use vessel the dreadnaught is worth taking a look at.

Excellent post on synthetic aperture, but jump drive, artificial gravity
and nuclear dampers are highly unlikely too.  So were microcips in every
doorknob 20 years ago.  In 3000 years these problems have been resolved,
even though it may seem ludicrous to us.  

I think of what is possible and go three or four steps further.  The
fleets forming that array also fight as one entity, guided by jacked in
human command and nonAI AI systems the Imperium won\'t acknowledge as
being intelligent.  You don\'t want to be in a naval confrontation in my
Imperial Rebellion-it is ugly.

So, he\'d like us to test the following system out, and send our comments 
to him at his email address (btrc@aol.com).  Here\'s the system:


Ammunition costs
================

None of the weapons in Traveller, Central Supply Catalog or Emporer\'s
Arsenal have ammunition mass and cost explicitly listed. Unless
characters are constructing an ammo dump or are so poor that reloads are
a major part of the budget, it shouldn\'t be a major concern. If you want
general guidelines on how much various reloads mass and cost, see below.

Mass - Ammunition is usually listed and sold in 50 round quantities. The
mass for one round is generally:
     
     ((Penetration + 1)/(13 - Penetration)-8))4 kilograms 

with a base minimum of:

     (Penetration/200)kg per round.


Because we don\'t actually expect you to figure this out every time, see
the following table:

(Figures are rounded to the nearest 2 digits or .1kg)

Pen.    Mass(50 Rds)   Pen.    Mass(10 Rds)   Pen.    Mass (1 Rd)
 1         .3kg         9          4.8kg       17        26kg
 2         .5kg        10           10kg       18        32kg
 3         .8kg        11           21kg       19        39kg
 4        1.0kg        12           44kg       20        47kg
 5        1.3kg        13           94kg       21        57kg
 6        2.4kg        14          124kg       22        68kg
 7        5.3kg        15          160kg       23        81kg
 8         11kg        16          200kg       24        95kg

Modifiers
APDS ammunition               x.5 mass
TL9+ ammunition (caseless)    x.5 mass
Rockets                       x1 mass (do not use caseless modifier on
                                 rockets)
HE ammunition                 x.5 mass
HEAP or HEDP ammunition       x.25 mass (use only one of HEAP or HE)
Multiple proj. (shotgun)      x2 mass
Guided weapon                 x2 mass

Example - Lets say you want 50 rounds of TL12 APDS ammunition with a
Penetration of 5. The base mass is 1.3kg, times .5 for APDS, and times
.5 again for TL9+ ammunition, for a total of .325kg, rounding to .3kg.

Example - You need to know how much each HEAP reload for a Penetration
27 TL8 cannon is. This is off the table so you have to figure it out.
The base mass is 150kg, times .25 for HEAP ammunition is 37.5kg,
rounding to 38kg.

Now, these don\'t exactly match the figures given for reloads for each
weapon in Emporer\'s Arsenal, but are close enough for most purposes. For
most applications, just use the mass of a listed weapon reload, since
when you are on the move, what you can transport is the important part.
On the other hand, if you are buying in bulk and want to ship or store
the stuff in a limited amount of volume, use the figures from this
table. Bulk ammunition has a mass of 3 metric tons per cubic meter for
shipping purposes.

Cost - Now this is more near and dear to most character\'s credit
accounts. The basic cost per round for most ammunition is ((Penetration
+ 2)/10)3 Cr per round. As for mass, you don\'t have to figure this out:

Pen.   Cost (50 Rds)      Pen.    Cost(10 Rds)      Pen.   Cost (1 Rd)
 1         Cr1.4           9         Cr13            17      Cr6.9
 2         Cr3.2           10        Cr17            18      Cr8.0
 3         Cr6.3           11        Cr22            19      Cr9.3 
 4         Cr11            12        Cr27            20      Cr11
 5         Cr17            13        Cr34            21      Cr12
 6         Cr26            14        Cr41            22      Cr14
 7         Cr36            15        Cr49            23      Cr16
 8         Cr50            16        Cr58            24      Cr18

Modifiers
Previous TL surplus ammo      x.25 cost (but makes weapon automatically
                                   unreliable)
APDS ammunition, TL8-         x6 cost
APDS ammunition, TL9+         x3 cost
TL9+ ammunition (caseless)    x2 cost
Rockets                       x4 cost (do not use caseless modifier on
                                 rockets)
HE ammunition                 x3 cost 
HEAP or HEDP ammunition       x5 cost (use only one of HE or HEAP)
Multiple proj. (shotgun)      x2 cost
Guided weapon                 x4 cost per DM+1, minimum base cost of Cr5
Proximity fuzed only          x2 cost or +Cr5, whichever is more
Buying in lots of 1000+       x.8 cost
Buying in lots of 10000+      x.6 cost
Availability/legality         x what the market will bear

Example - You need some APDS reloads for a TL8 Penetration 21 cannon.
The base cost is Cr21, times 6 for APDS ammunition is Cr126 each.

Example - You need reloads for a TL7 Penetration 19 shoulder fired HEAP
rocket launcher. The base cost is Cr9.3, times 4 for a rocket, times 5
for HEAP is Cr186 each.

Example - You have a TL13 cannon firing caseless guided HEAP rounds with
a DM+3 and a Penetration of 28. The base cost is Cr27, times 2 for
caseless ammunition, times 5 for HEAP, times 4 three times for the
guided bonus is Cr17,280 per shot. Make them count...

As with most goods, manufacturing and sale cost will vary with the local
political climate. If APDS is the normal type of ammunition used,
competition will drive the price down. If it is brand new and there are
limited manufacturing facilities, the price will be higher. Availability
of ammunition depends on three levels: Tech Level, Law Level and
Population Level. The base 2D roll for easy availability at a major
population center is the planetary Population Level+2, levels A and
above needing a roll of 12-. Each Tech Level difference between the
ammunition and the planetary Tech Level is a DM-3 to this roll. If there
is a source, but the Law Level is past the legal to own on planetary
surface  level for the weapon firing this ammunition, it requires a
Difficult (2.5D) Streewise task to find said source, with a DM-2 for
each Law Level the weapon is illegal by. A critical failure means you
get in trouble of some kind. This could be immediate, like being present
during a police raid or having the supplier think you are an informant
or spy, or delayed, like buying from a sting operation, where the
character will be busted at some later date for the recorded and
witnessed illegal transaction.

Example - Characters touch down on a TL10 world with a Population Level
of 9 and a Law Level of 4. Wisely, they leave their heavy weapons on the
ship, but someone decides they need extra ammunition for a TL11 vehicle
autocannon. The 2D availability roll is 8- because of the DM-3 for Tech
Level difference. If there is some to be found here, it is a Difficult
Streetwise roll with a DM-2 for the illegal nature of the ammunition to
get an appointment with someone who can provide it. The haggling over
the price is left to the GM and player to work out.

Subject: January Traveller Contest

Hi,

This month\'s contest involves starship design, and it will be judged by 
Guy "Wildstar" Garnett.  The constraints on the designs are laid out 
below.  As usual, send your entry to me (ransom@iconnect.net), and I\'ll 
strip the header and forward it to Guy.  As it says below, entries are 
due by January 31.  The contest winner will be announced on February 1.  
Although there are some specific design specifications laid out below, 
keep in mind that Guy is the sole judge of what constitutes a winning 
vessel, and that his decisions are final.  Oh, and please put "contest" 
in the subject line of your entry so I don\'t miss it. :)

The prize for this contest is a copy of _Central Supply Catalog_ (but if 
you want another book - say, if M0 is out by the time the contest is over 
- - - the winner can negotiate for another book after winning).

______________________________________________________________________________
Ship Design Contest!

You play the role of the chief designer of a major shipyard.  You have to
respond to the Scout Service\'s request for proposals (below) with a complete
ship design for a vessel that meeds the mission requirements.  If it\'s
impossible to meet the requirements, the ship should meet as many as possible,
and the notes should explain which ones weren\'t met, and why.

You can design the ship using either QSDS or SSDS, but be sure to note which
system was used, so that the designs can be checked for accuracy.  Double
check your math, because illegal designs may be disqualified.

There\'s no need for deckplans; the designs will be judged solely on the USP
and the accompanying descriptive text.

The Scout Service assumes that the ship\'s active lifetime will be 50 years,
with at least one refit to update equipment before the ship is retired.  They
will judge the total cost of operating the ship for 50 years (including
purchase price, maintainance, and crew costs).  The lowest-cost ship that
meets all of the requirements will probably win the competition.

All designs should be suitable for Milieu 0.  Since the IISS is an Imperial
service, equipment up to TL-12 can be used.  Small craft and vehicles
can be custom-designed for this ship, or standard designs can be
specified (from the basic rulebook, or from _Starships_ or the _Central Supply
Catalog_).

Be sure that your notes and other descriptive text points out the unique
features of your design.  Be creative!

Day 031 is January 31st, so don\'t wait!


Agency: Imperial Interstellar Scout Service, Bureau of Ships
Request for Proposal: IISS/BuShips RFP-90037/03x7

The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service, Office of Exploratrion, has issued
requirement number MIL-TD/41 for an exploration and recontact starship.
BuShips requests that all interested shipyards submit detailed proposals that
meet this requirement no later than Day 031.  An IISS evaluation team will
examine the proposals, and announce the winer by Day 032.  The successful
design will be practical to construct with current starship building
technology and shipyards, meet all of the requirements listed below, and
have the lowest full-lifecycle costs to the IISS.  The evaluation team will
take into consideration any special features of the design, and will also
include servicability, habitability, and potential growth in their
evaluation.

Requirement: IISS/OffExp MIL-TD/41

The Office of Exploration has an immediate requirement for starships that can
carry a survey and recontact team of six to eight specialists (in addition to
the crew required for the safe navigation of the ship) and their equipment of
up to 16 displacement tons.

The ship must have an additional cargo capacity of 1 displacement ton per
person (crewmember and specialist) to store additional supplies and
comsumables for a long-duration voyage.

The ship must be capable of a 2-parsec Jump, and 1G maneuver performance.

The ship must be armed, and carry a gunner as part of the crew.

The ship must be capable of wilderness refueling, including the purification
of raw fuel.  If the ship is not capable of skimming, it may meet this
requirement by carrying small craft that can skim the required amount of fuel
in 24 hours of operations.

The ship must be capable of landing on undeveloped planets, including
NOE (Nap-Of-the-Earth) flight.  If the ship itself is unstreamlined, it may
meet this requirement by carrying small craft that can deliver the
specialists and at least half their gear to a planetary surface (6 to 8
persons and 8 dtons, in addition to the crew of the craft).  This gear may
include a small vehicle.

The craft\'s primary purpose is long-range exploration and recontact.  Due
to the extended duration of these missions, the quality of the quarters
aboardship will be important to maintaining crew efficency.

>BTW, you mentioned SW ships that are 2,000 meters in length.  Here are a
>couple of approximations for ships of that size.

Actually, the SW RPG shows an Imperial-class Star Destroyer (might as well
start with the classic) as being 1,600 meters long, in a wedge
configuration.  Using FF&S to figure the hull size, I get a base hull
length of
		1600 / 2.5 (the LM for Wedge config) = 640 meters.

Since FF&S hull sizes are based on a sphere of a diameter equal to the base
length, the volume of the hull is about 
		320^3 * pi * 4/3 = 137,258,277 cubic meters. (wow, that\'s a lot)

Converting this to standard Displacement tons at 14 kl per Dton, I get
		137,258,277 / 14 = 9,804,162 Dtons.  Round it to 9.8 million tons.

Its external dimensions (based on a pyramidal wedge) work out to
	Volume = 1/3 b * h
	Length = 1600 meters
	Area of base = 257,359 square meters
	Length of each base edge = ~507 meters
	Base w:h ratio = 2:1 (guessing)
		Height = ~358 meters
		Width = ~717 meters

That\'s a damn big ship.  I\'m pretty sure the math is accurate; if anyone
finds any errors please tell me.  I haven\'t gotten around to actually
/building/ the thing yet, though.  Good luck to anyone willing to try.

I\'m still waiting to have CSC and AA arrive over here in my local shop :-}
I was a little shocked when I looked at the 1997 product list at the IG
website.  While an impressive amount of stuff is planned the prices seem
to be excessive (everything is priced at $20+, isn\'t it).  Also I got the
impression that most supplements will be in the range of 100-110 pages.  I
hope that my memory is failing me but for these prices I expect glossy,
full-color supplements.  Nothing else probably could justify these
excessive prices.  I\'m really curious about how Traveller will fare in
1997.

30000 sold rulebooks sounds awfully high.  Maybe they were sold to
distributors.  Judging from what I can see about Traveller sales over here
in Germany I\'d bet that not more than 10000 rulebooks actually were sold
to humans.  This might show up in further orders by distributors in a
couple of monsters if shops notice that the stuff is sitting on the
shelves (I\'m still the only person who bought a Traveller rulebook in my
local area... and the shop has a lot of customers of all tastes and
ages... pretty frightening).

Thomas Biskup.

P.S.: Did anyone have a problem with the Traveller website?  The last two
times I visited the new site I both times had the problem that I received
black background and black text for most of the stuff (product
announcements, etc.).  This happened both under Netscape 2.something under
Windows and Netscape 3.0 under SunOS.  It\'s somewhat annoying having to
read the HTML sources to get the information :-)

Tell me a date and location and I will:

   1. Find a babysitter for the trip
   2. Request the days for vacation
   3. Find a way to get there.

I\'m all for this.  Hey, I may even work on a Vargr or Hiver costume to wear. <g>

Well, different countries measure different parts of the vessel to register

I\'ve had the same problem here in the States.  Game stores either had (or
had heard of) T4 & Starships, but not CSC or Aliens.  The comics stores had
heard of T4, but didn\'t stock it.  None were interested in doing a special
order either!  

I did get a copy of Starships from my NSFLGS (not so friendly local game
store), but it was like pulling teeth to get it from them.  

I asked the clerk if they had a copy, he said "Yes, but only one.", and
just looked at me.

After realizing that he wasn\'t going to get it, tell me where it was, or
anything else, I asked, "Well, can I see it?"

"Um, OK.", he said reluctantly and rummaged around UNDER the counter
finally pulling out a copy, "It\'s really expensive, you know."  It was
pretty obvious that he didn\'t *really* want to sell it, but I bought it
anyway! <g>

Getting me to buy from those guys again won\'t be easy.

I finally found a Friendly Cards and a Very Few Games Store (FCVFG) hidden
away downtown.  I was shopping for a birthday card when I *discovered* a
dice display and followed my nose <g> to the back of the store.  There I
found some wargames, a rack of TSR stuff, a few GURPS books, a handfull of
old TW2k books, and 3 old dog-eared _Challenge_ magazines.

"Oooo!", thinks I, "Maybe they\'ve got CSC hidden around here
somewhere."

So, heading back to the cash register, I asked the clerk about T4. She
hadn\'t heard of it.  The last she\'d heard GDW went belly up, and Traveller,
TW2k, et al went down the drain.  

"MT didn\'t sell, so they\'d stopped carrying much of the Traveller stuff
years ago.", she said

"But,",she continued, "if our distributer has what you\'re looking for we\'ll
special order it for you."

She called her distributor, who told her they had plenty of copies of CSC,
and they could get it here in 2 days.  

I said, "Do it!", they did, and I\'m the proud owner of CSC!  :->

BTW, this FCVFG is now *my* store.  Not only did they go out of their way
to find me a copy of something they had never heard of, they gave me a 10%
discount on it when I paid for it!  The next week I got the same store to
special order GURPS Vehicles II for me, took 3 days and they gave me the (I
realize now, standard for games) 10% discount.  

The moral of the story is, find a friendly store with helpful and
intellegent employees and see if they will special order you a copy of
whatever you\'re looking for.  


Eris

ps.  As soon as First Survey and M0 hit the distribution channels I\'ll be
heading back to my FCVFG store to special order copies for me!  I don\'t
know if I\'ll be able to talk them into *stocking* T4 stuff, but I just
might.  ;->

No, there is no established date for a version 4.1 of Traveller.  There 
will be a version 4.1, but no date has been set.  

As soon as a date for that, and for the new version of _Starships_, has 
been set, it will be announced on the web site as well as here on TML.

[end snip]

Now that we\'ve all agreed what supressive fire is and isn\'t, and what it can
and can\'t do; does anybody have any models or ideas of how it can be
implemented in traveller??  I believe that that was what the original writer
of this thread wanted to get at.  -IMHO

Like what are some methods that other systems use, and how they can be
converted over to traveller.  Or how a supressive fire task might be handled
in traveller.

For example, would the PC\'s and NPC\'s just roll a willpower check (at
different difficulties depending on if it\'s a grenade, a HMG, or a mini-gun,
etc.)  Or might they roll a combination of attribute checks???  

What I\'m really asking is if anybody has a playtested style they found
worked, or if there has been errata (sp?) written on this, etc.   Some
system that maintains game balance...

Thanks in advance,

I\'ll bet you guessed-I am a B-52/B-1 driver currently training in the

No air force will ever hold ground or completely win a war, unlike what
some of the USAF\'s overzealous leadership seems to believe.  We will
kill a lot of people, but I don\'t believe we can win a war, unless it is
completely defensive. Maybe not even then.  Not enough staying power.

I am a big believer in combined arms warfare, with each component doing
its share to complement the combat environment.  I think there will be
few major conflicts where aircraft will not be of great use, but
anything below that the air vehicle takes on marginal utility.

        Good... I was hoping somebody would pick out any glaring errors; I
was going by the MegaTraveller Referee\'s manual, and was unable to find any
information on what the size classes and orbits actually meant.  That\'s
where the Size II Orbit 8 comes from.  As far as the G classification goes,
I was basing myself on this rather pop astronomy book that claimed that
Barnard\'s Star was precisely that...

        If you could tell me what the proper spectral class, size class and
habitable orbit number for something analogous to Barnard\'s, I\'d be
grateful.

You are assuming that a cruiser can have the same practical armor as a
dreadnought.  Maybe in a game, but not so in reality.  That is why
dreadnoughts came into existence-to fend off heavy guns of other big
ships with big armor.

BTW, this debate has been raging 45 odd years in reality and 3000 years
in Imperial space, and there really isn\'t a definite answer.  I don\'t
think we can come up with one, either, because reality is really the
only way to decide the truth.

Any game is necessarily a model of your desired effect-I go for the
WWI/WWII appraoch, preferring the feel of enourmous ships with mind
numbing power.  You seem to like the feel of loose fleets of deadly
cruisers.  I RUN a crusier squadron in my game, and feel the huge power
gradient between cruiser and battleshipmen.  I think it adds a lot of
spice.  And I have yet to prove a bunch of cruisers can defeat a a
single dreadnought.  I\'ll get back to you on that after the dust
settles!

Let us know if you\'re able to, Eris. :)  I feel as though I\'m banging my 
head against a wall with a few of the stores local to me.  Maybe you can 
help me with my technique. :)  I\'ve told them how well it\'s selling, I\'ve 
told them which stores are selling it in the area and recommended the 
call and simply ask how its selling.  I\'ve recommended they ask their 
distributor how well its selling.  None of these things have helped any 
more than my passionate pleas for stocking it simply because I\'m a 
customer who wants it.  They\'ll special order it, but they won\'t keep it 
on the shelf to sell to those who don\'t know about it yet.  Sigh.

        Many thanks...  It just occurred to me that rather than rely on a
table of star data in the back of a book, I should have just looked at the
nice big full-page full-colour Hertzsprung-Russell diagram in the middle.
D\'oh!

        Quick consultation of said H-R diagram reveals that a K5 to M0 star
would indeed be the closest to what I had in mind.  I will issue an errata
notice to my players :).

        And as far as tidal lock goes, you\'re right... that\'s exactly what
I had in mind.  Small dim plant slowly spinning down...

Thats my prblem, Jeff.  I was pretty content with the current Traveller
dimensions until my brother did some of these calculations based on
approximate size from MT art.  The ships came out a lot bigger than
200,000-850,000 tons, and I wanted some gearheads to check the math. 
Basically if you stay with previous ships sizes, the art depicting some
of the biggies in the Trav Imperial universe is wrong.  

What guides the game, vision or numbers?  I say vision, which the
numbers should model for usage.  Some may disagree, but I have a
particular need to get this one right.  If Trav needs to boost the
systems power to describe these ships I need to know.  Traveller needs
vision to get new players, and keep the old ones interested.  I\'m going
to try to provide it, but to prevent another Starships I need support
from the gearheads and a starship combat system that works at the
massive end of the scale.

   I\'m afraid we are faced yet again with a bit of "IG Revisionism".  As
it is a result of a basic ignorance of established canon (as are most of
their story slips), my tendency would be to either to declare the number
\'14\' errata (which means that they meant to say \'13\', which would fit
canon), or to just ignore the item altogether (explaining it away as
something that the Third Imperium develops later--sorry, wrong book).
Hopefully the inclusion of Marc Miller in the creative process will
eliminate similar mistakes in the future.  

   You cannot simply declare previous canon as "one interpretation of
events" (as I have heard someone who may or may not be associated with
IG say previously).  That is a cop out, designed to allow people avoid a
lot of what they consider to be "unnecessary" reading before they start
writing for a previous storyline.  I wonder if George Lucas considers a
detailed knowledge Star Wars optional when an author proposes writing an
officially sanctioned novel involving the characters from that
universe?  I already know what the answer is, and so do the members of
this list.

I
personally think it is a bad change since another canonical fact is that
the Imperium dosen\'t reach TL 13 until Year 300 and TL 14 until... (was
it 700?). Making the RoM TL 14 and the Sylean Federation borderline TL
13
is, IMO, a Bad Idea.

Besides, isn\'t one of the points of doing Mileau Zero to make it
different
from the other Traveller settings? Why then erase as much of the
difference
as possible this way?

I noticed in working through the BR damage rules that most of the MILITARY
ships listed had hull armor that would barely, if at all, stand up to the
damage done by their own class of weapons. 

I vaguely remember reading somewhere that one of the design criteria used
for the classic Terran Wet Navy dreadnaughts was to be tough enough to
survive MULTIPLE HITS BY THEIR OWN MAIN GUNS. The Missouri was designed to
take multiple 16 inch shells, I belive at 2.5 tons of HE per shell. 

Perhaps we need to develop some kind of easy, rule of thumb test for
projected survivability in combat?

Basic idea:

\'Light\' accepts hit from standard turret weapon at given tech level at long
range without penetration.

\'Medium\' accepts hit from standard bay weapon at given tech level at long
range without penetration.

\'Heavy\' accepts hit from standard spinal mount at given tech level at long
range without penetration. This last one creates an interesting split when
the tech level shifts spinal mounts from particle to meason. 

It isn\'t always who shoots first, fastest or most, but who is still standing
when the shooting is done.

Sure, you can enter as many times as you like.  The only catch is, each

I see that <DMSEF@aol.com> has found and posted them.  I may be one of
the few here who\'s read Lenat\'s paper in _Artificial Intelligence_. It
must be the only academic paper where JTAS gets "J. Travellers Aid Soc."
as a footnote!  JTAS originally published the designs way back when.
If you\'re interested in Lenat\'s paper, check out _Artificial Intelligence_, 
volume 21, pp. 73-83; the paper is longer, but that\'s the part most of
you would be interested in.

EURISKO was an experiment in AI written in Lisp.  It didn\'t just work
to find heuristics for TCS fleet design, but also to play other games
and solve various other problems.  It spent about 1300 CPU hours (in
the early \'80s) designing and fighting; one round took two to twenty
minutes.  Heuristic culling was apparently not ideal; Lenat intervened
to cull "obviously counterproductive" rules every few hours.

It was good at finding loopholes and anomalies in the rules.  One 
evil tactic it stumbled on was to build a single, unarmored, very
fast, very small, *very* agile ship with an incredible computer; 
it turned out to be unhittable.  As old timers know, _High Guard_
had you form ships into the Line, which fought, and the Reserve,
which was screened and not attackable.  If the Line was getting
too badly damaged, EURISKO put the unhittable ship in the Line and 
the rest of the fleet in the Reserve to repair.  The Line was not
breakable, technically, and the Reserve was safe.  In later years,
battlefield repair was not allowed.  :)  This is probably the "Wasp"
class escort posted.  Another rule limited the use of drop tanks;
look at the designs and see what use was made of them.

Another silly tactic was to have one, count it, one laser turret.
It wasn\'t a serious weapon.  It was meant to be destroyed by enemy
fire, instead of taking out a *useful* battery.  Another loophole.

EURISKO was matched primarily against 20 ship fleets with low armor,
high agility, lasers, and spinal mounts.  We\'re basically talking
about a BatRon like those you could assemble out of Battle Rider.
In fact, EURISKO itself started by testing fleets like that one.

It went with a different model.  EURISKO first fielded 96 ships,
most with only agility 2 and heavy armor.  One was the super-agile 
boat.  The medium-sized ships with low armor, minimal drives, and a 
huge PAWS spinal mount were meant to hunt the most agile enemy ships, 
as accelerators had the best chance to-hit.  The bulk of the fleet 
consisted of 75 small, armored missile cruisers without spinal
weapons, meant to overwhelm the enemy with waves of fire.

It came up with some interesting heuristics that Lenat mentioned,
some of which may still be valid:

"If the weapon can\'t hit at Long range, it\'s not worth having too
 many of them."  (The fusion gun lesson.)
"Fusion guns can be effectively armored against.  Once this is
 discovered, ship armor will rapidly be increased to defeat them".
 (The other fusion gun lesson.)
"Armor is more useful than agility."  (Check out the configuration
 of the Eurisko-class ships; to get the armor factor as high as it
 could, EURISKO used buffered planetoid hulls.)
"More small ships are often better than few big ships."  (I think
 this had to do with increased redundancy and to-hit difficulty.)

Think a flashy poster design would help?  One with a lot of starships in

We can make Dreadnaughts the preferred weapon platforms, but only if we
structure the environment correctly. 

The things that made the Dreadnaught the "queen of ocean" from 1890 to 1940
were relative speed, armor, size and range of weapon fire.

The Dreadnaughts were slow, but no less than 1/2 the speed of the fastest
platform packing weapons that could hurt them.  Airplanes changed that,
they were 10 to 20 times faster.

The Dreadnaughts carried an armor belt, and an armored
superstructure that could take a tremendous pounding from naval gunfire and
keep fighting, lesser ships went under with a few hits from the big guns. 
Aerially delivered bombs changed that.
Dive bombers delivered "ship killer" bombs straight down on the ship\'s
decks...their weakest spot.  Torpedo bombers sped in 10 to 20 times faster
than the fastest torpedo boat delivering explosives that attacked below the
Dreadnaught\'s mighty armor belt.

Due to their size, Dreadnaughts carried many redundant systems. Multiple
boilers in multiple engine rooms, knock one out, it kept going.  Several
screws, you can slow it down, but stopping it\'s very hard.  Several
well-armored magazines, hitting one (and penetrating the armor) would
destroy a smaller ship, the dreadnaught was damaged but keep fighting. 
Multiple control rooms, for Fleet Control if nothing else.  Larger crews,
to make up for loses, and to carry out more and faster damage control. 
Smaller ships just didn\'t have the space for all this!  I don\'t think this
has really changed that much.  Large ships still have these advantages.

Dreadnaughts, because of their size, were able to mount naval guns much
larger, and longer ranged, than any other ship. Smaller ships couldn\'t
mount those guns, or match the range.  Advances in missile and bomb
technology and delivery systems changed this. 

If you want Dreadnaughts to play a dominate role in T4 naval
systems, then you need to duplicate the things that made them
dominate, pre-war:

Speed:  All ships (and weapons platforms) need to have similar top speeds,
or accelerations anyway.  A Dreadnaught should be slower than a Destroyer
or Frigate, but we can\'t have a situation where *fighter/bombers* can fly
rings around the big ships.

Armor and Size:  Armor needs to make a big difference, particularly in the
number of hits a ship can take before it loses effectiveness. A Dreadnaught
must be able to take a real pounding and keep
fighting, while Cruisers can be taken out with a few hits from a
Dreadnaught\'s *main* weapons.  Increasing size should make critical hits
increasingly less likely, and allow a ship to take more and bigger
"punches" while continuing to hit back.

Big Gun:  There needs to be a, "big gun" weapon that only real ships can
mount.  This weapon\'s effective range needs to be increase with increased
size and increased power.  This way a Frigate\'s "big gun" can outrange and
outgun a Destroyer "big gun."  A Cruiser\'s "big gun" can outrange and
outgun a Frigate\'s, and a Dreadnaught\'s "big gun" outranges and outguns
anything short of a Shore Battery! Whatever this "big gun" is, it must be
mountable only on larger ships, fighters need not apply.  Well, at least, a
fighter\'s weapons should be totally ineffective against Dreadnaughts and
Cruisers, and only marginally effective against Frigates and Destroyers.

Can we create these conditions?

Do we want to?

I can\'t imagine ship-to-ship aperture synthesis working before about TL14,
more likely 15 or higher; figuring out the relative position of two ships
separated by 100,000 km to within a centimeter or so is a *tough* job.
Doing it when both ships are accelerating is even tougher.  It becomes
impossible if the two ships don\'t continuously alert one another on
planned maneuvers a few seconds ahead of time, and even then fails if the
actual maneuvers diverge by more than a few thousandths of a percent from
what was planned -- which puts a rather heavy burden on both the pilot and
the engineering staff!

If, however, you decide to try the trick anyway, you\'ll have meson
communicators, which are effectively jamming-proof.

By the way, the same positional-determination problem is why I can\'t buy
the whole Project Longbow concept.

Where is the mass per 1m3 for sensors? I have not found it on in the
sensors section or on the worksheet. I have used the same mass as
communicators.

Item 4:
Page 68 under communicators it states that vehicle comms "These numbers are
for full capability starship-equilavent units,... Does this mean that
vehicle comms are or are not equal to military grade? To me it does seem to
be very clear?

Item 5:
page 69 Laser Comms do not get the options of Directional Antenna and
Direction Finder, but Maser Comms seemly can.???

Item 6:
I take a Disp 100t, radically slope all surfaces except top and bottom, its
remaining volume puts it in the Disp of 20t. Its crosssectional area is
closer to Disp 20 rather than 100. This was also an issue in Striker I.
Would not sloping increase the surface area available?

I would love to see a system like this.  I posted something earlier on
dreadnoughts, but don\'t see it on the list yet.  You are correct. See
the USS Alaska for example.

A classic battlecruiser is, for example, the Graf Spee of the German
Navy of early WWII.  As heavily armed as a battleship, it was the size
of a large cruiser of the day.  Graf Spee could barely stand in the line
of battle, but the Germans wisely chose not to confront the nasty little
British Navy.  The British had true battleships waiting to butcher the
ship, and as I recall the captain of the GS scuttled her in Montevideo
Bay, Argentina rather that surrender or fight the Brits, who had him
bottled in.  That actually have been her sister ship, whose name eludes
me at this late hour(San Antonio,Texas, United States of Texas)

The battlecruiser occupies a station below battleship and above cruiser,
to my knowledge wtih obviously increasing power.  I do not think they
existed prior to just before WWII, when they were invented by the crafty
Germans as a way to violate/elude the naval tonnage treaties of the day.

As a footnote, an excellent movie I saw said that the "battleships" were
just three cruisers bamboozling the GS. So mabye cruisers can take on a
battleship and win  :)

Seriously, I do believe this argument boils down to the philosophy of
the universe you want to model.  The real world tends to say bigger is
better, while a game says what it wants to.  GM\'s choice!

Craig,

I buy your argument, but  what I see is the exponential effect of
technology.  Again, the universe is what we make it, but I think these
problems can be solved.  As a general rule, when humans are able to
envision something, it is only a few hundred years to realization.  We
underestimate ourselves.


On the other hand, you may be right about Longbow.  Anyone for virus?

This way a Frigate\'s "big gun" can outrange and outgun a Destroyer "big gun."  A Cruiser\'s "big gun" can outrange and outgun a Frigate\'s, and a Dreadnaught\'s "big gun" outranges and outguns anything short of a Shore Battery! Whatever this "big gun" is, it must be mountable only on larger ships, fighters need not apply.  Well, at least, a fighter\'s weapons should be totally ineffective against Dreadnaughts and Cruisers, and only marginally effective against Frigates and Destroyers.

What other precedent do we have to draw from?  Remember,Traveller is
probably closer to science fact than most other SFRPGs.  Fighters don\'t
whiz around battleships blowing them up with single shots.  They follow
vectors and accelerations, and are basically limited to 6G like the rest
of Traveller canon.

The same applies to cruisers.  The argument against is that you get more
chances to hit with large numbers of cruisers than with small numbers of
battleships.  I posit that the success of these methods is a gameism not
based in precedent from the only thing we know-actual combat in
WWI/WWII.

Cruisers could not stand against battleships, except in limited
circumstances.  True line oif battle warfare never occured because the
Japanese eliminated the US line at Pearl Harbor.  We soon fund out that
fighterbombers made great long range artillery.  

This will change in space.  Nowhere to hide, and about zero evasive
capability for all ships.  God takes away the air and makes it that way.
Of course you can jink, and that may be effective, but by and large the
big gunned, sensored and armored ships should win.  If only by
precedence.

My ideas to point:

1)Excess power and hull surface area determine screen effectiveness, not
a modular black box.  This increases the larger ships survivability,
more accurately simulating line ship precedents.

2)Increasing length directly increases collating power in spinal mounts,
boosting range and yield.  My brother has calculated yields on the order
of 1-100KT from various designs, based on meson conversion to energy at
the dump site.

3)Speed in Traveller is acceleration.  There is nothing more.  6g=6g on
a cruiser or fighter.  A dreadnought with enough excess power(which
these big ships are engineered to have) can maneuver just as well as a
fighter(assuming equal accelerations.)

In my mind we have to use precedent and compensate for the loss of water
and air, trying to figure out the most likely outcome.

4) You don\'t want to come to a gunfight with a throwing knife-not even a
lot of them.

I know we have been over and over Marc\'s objectives for Traveller, and I
thought we had the issue settled, but apparently, Mr. Porter has no regard
for Marc\'s goals and designs for Traveller.

What am I talking about, you ask?

Marc has made no bones about telling us that he does not want to see
Traveller descend into tight suited Babes wielding just enough technology to
make it sci-fi.  Marc is looking for a game that is decent and not smutty.
I believe that I have accurately represented what Marc said regarding this.

What did Mr. Porter do to blatently defy Marc\'s wishes on this?

I direct your attention to the critically acclaimed Supplement # 3: Central
Supply Catalog.  Page 29 of this otherwise wonderful volume.  The second
item in the right hand column is labeled sleeping bag-5, but it could just
as well be labeled gratuitous smut!  I quote directly from the reference...

"Allows user to ... engage in meaningful cultural exchanges that would be
otherwise hindered by such clothing. [bulky cold weather clothing]"

Now I ask you, what activities would the user of a SLEEPING bag-5 be
involved in that would 1) require a sleeping bag, and 2) be impractical
while wearing bulky cold weather clothing?

I need not explain what smut Mr. Porter is refering to here.  It is quite
obvious that Mr. Porter has a true lack of family values and is trying to
undermine the true morality with this surreptitious reference.

I say again, I am appalled!!!

I suppose it also could have been the Only one), which gets me completely
caught up with all the T4 releases, and after a quick skim-through, here\'s my
impressions:
     
     In general it seems like about like the better issues of "Traveller
Chronicle", which is fine as a starting point.  I have to wonder, though, if
there\'s a need for two Traveller magazines that are so similar.  Does anyone
know if Kevin Knight is planning to still publish TC and, if so, how (or even
if) he\'s planning to differentiate it from it\'s "official" cousin?
     I don\'t have the mag with me now, so I\'m going from memory as regards the
individual articles.  The first adventure looked pretty good from what I
skimmed of it.  Haven\'t yet read the first story.  The biotech thing was okay,
but nothing special.  The Aliens Archive teaser was worthless since I\'ve
already got the real book.  The second adventure seems to have a pretty good
basic story except for the huge error with the FTL radio and the fact that the
task descriptions seem to be working under a rules system other than T4.  The
"Free Trader Beowulf" story was quite good, but I noticed a few niggling
errors-- Sylea consistently spelled "Silea," the captain "dawns" his vac suit;
it seems like there were a couple others but I\'ve forgotten them now.  The 101
cargoes were also good; especially the background story-info that was thrown in
with them.  Interior art was adequate, especially since this was issue #1
(anyone remember what TC#1 looked like?).  Cover art was fine, except that it
was a recycled picture from the rulebook-- I\'ve got nothing against the
Foss-style.  All in all I\'m perfectly satisfied and give it a B+ grade (or 4.0
on the old JTAS rating scale).  Who knows, I might even get off my lazy butt
and subscribe.

Trent Smith
P.S.  People have been mentioning their experience with T4 sell-throughs.  As
far as I can tell, the rulebook is selling quite well at stores I\'ve been to,
but I can\'t speak for the supplements.  It seems like they\'re getting a single
copy, waiting for it to sell, and then not restocking it-- but I haven\'t really
talked to the owners so I may be wrong about that; perhaps the distributors
have been slow or something.  (As a sidenote for people wanting more specifics,
I\'ve recently been to 2 stores in Indiana: one a games/comics shop and one a
games/hobbies shop, as well as a "just plain games" shop out here in CA.  All
three have about the same selection: good for brand new and major-company
products, a bit dodgy for older, more obscure titles.)

Hmm.  Take a large sensor drone, have it tow ten or twenty klicks (hell, we
have the materiels tech for superdense hulls, one or two hundred klicks) of
Sinclair molecule chain with sensor pods every X meters, communicating with
the mother ship via comm laser.

Hmm.  Take a large sensor drone, have it tow ten or twenty klicks (hell, we
have the materiels tech for superdense hulls, one or two hundred klicks) of
Sinclair molecule chain with sensor pods every X meters, communicating with
the mother ship via comm laser.

A trifle difficult to jam a comm laser, no?  The geek in me says to use
multiple lasers, in different wavelengths, mounted on the extreme ends of
the ship, with some sort of cryptographic secret splitting algorithm (which
exist today) so that as long as any N-x out of N comm lasers are unoccluded
the data gets through.

This becomes especially hard to jam when your opponent has more than 2
ships in their squadron, each of which maintains links to all the other
squadron members.  It becomes more difficult by orders of magnitude if you
allow for several comm shuttles/drones standing off a couple of hundreths
of a light second relaying information in to the battlecruisers.  You can\'t
possibly carry enough sand to interdict all the comm links in a large
squadron.

Which brings me to the topic of sensor drones - why wouldn\'t a cruiser
carry several small unmanned sensor drones - it can\'t be too hard to build,
and even if you only deploy them a few tens of kilometers from the base
vessel you\'ll increase your sensor baseline a lot more than just bloating
your ship up to 500ktons or more.

Preventing the enemy from tapping your communication laser is easy - Niven
& Pournelle describe a suitable method in either _The Mote in God\'s Eye_ or
_The Gripping Hand_ - it boils down to the laser target being surrounded by
several concentric rings of sensors, and if the beam strays into the outer
rings, the system passes back a command to cut the link.  If the beam is
interrupted for more than N milliseconds, the back channel tells the
originating ship to cut the link.

If I remember the Royal Navy cornered it with 1 heavy cruiser and 2 light

I have seen the HMS Hood called a battlecruiser.  When it was built it was the
longest ship in the Royal Navy.  The examples of battlecruisers that I can
think of emphasized speed and armament over armor.

	I believe that these TL 14 Vac Suits from the Rule of Man (high 
TL 12) can be explained (if you WANT to explain them) as being an 
example of an Achievment Tech Level in Spacesuits of Tl 14 which was 
above the Second Imperiums Hich Common Tech Level of 12.

	This would explain the Tl 14 Vac Suits without declaring the 
Central Supply Catalog to be wrong AND preserve the cannonical 
information that the Rule of Man was TL 12.  The Second Empire was TL 12 
it just happens that they had a few planets that made a few experimental 
TL 14 Vac Suits.  (In much the same way that the Tl 15 Imperium (circa 
1100) put TL 17 experimental AI computers (a very bad idea...) on its 
otherwise TL 15 Kinunir ships.)

	The MegaTraveller World Builders Handbook (pg 83-86) provides 
the ability to detail the Tech Level into the High Common Tech Level (TL 
8 on Earth in 1997 AD in the 1st world), the Low Common Tech Level (TL 5 
on Earth in 1997 AD in the 3rd world, 11 Achievement Tech Levels in 
specific areas: Energy, Computers/Robotics, Communications, Medical, 
Environment, Land Transport, Water Transport, Air Transport, Space 
Transport, Personal Military, and Heavy Military and a novelty Tech 
Level which is the highest of one of the following: the highest 
Achievment Tech Level, the previous Tech Level on the planet if it has 
regressed, or that of imported novelties.

	I suggest that (if we so desire) we can consider the TL 14 Vac 
Suits listed as being products of the Second Imperium Achievment Tech 
Level of 14 in Spacesuits.  This would them mean that Syleas Novelty TL 
is 14 which would represent these suits.

	The Price of these suits is_very_wrong however. 

	I normally treat products of an Achievment TL above the High 
Common Tech Level as costing (x+1) x 2 times the normal cost IE 2 x cost 
for +1 TL, 4 x cost for +2 TL\'s, and 8 x cost for +3 Tl\'s if they are 
currently in  production.  For Artifact type items I usually charge the 
product of the higher Tech Levels.  IE at TL 12 Mileau 0 the 1700 year 
old Rule of Man TL 14 artifacts will cost  192 times (13 x 14) times 
their initial price.  

	This explains why the suits will be rare !

	This system  should not  be used to obtain a price for Ancient 
Artifacts but only for previous human achievments.

I think that if IG printed up some sort of flyer or other advertising 
materials, and shipped them off to the distributors (who would then ship 
them with each game store\'s weekly order), that would help.  And it\'d be 
cheap.  That way, all the game store owners would know that T4 exists, at 
least.  Posters would help lend credence to the claim that T4 is here to 
stay.  And, of course, if the FLGS owners put the posters up, it\'d help 
sales.  

Maybe IG will do that sometime soon...I hope.

  When a star forms out of the interstellar gas it will be (after a short
initial phase which isn\'t that well understood) a main sequence star. Why?
It\'s because hydrogen compressed in that way behave in a certain way, 
fusioning at a certain rate which keeps the star in equilibrium between
the gravity which wants it to contract and the fusion which wants it to
blow up.

  So for a certain mass of gas you will get a star with a certain radii and
a certain brightness, which in turn determines temperature which in turn
determines color.

  White dwarfs are too faint for their color (IIRC:) because they have very
little hydrogen left after burning it all up in their time on the main
sequence.

numbers (7000 grains in 1lb).
This means that small high velocity rounds don\'t come out so well. BIG

A company here in Australia has just started producing a rifle based on a
old tiger hunting design from India. It fires a slow moving 4 Bore round

The speed of the larger rounds would give them tragectories like rainbows
but most big game would be shot at close range. Most of the big game rifles
used to be double barrelled so as to have a second shot ready if a second
animal appeared at the sound of the shot and charged.
All of the above is based solely on reading, I don\'t think rabbits could be

Welcome to the nuthouse!  And now a patented Doug Berry rant on:

Stupid Questions.

There is no such thing here on the TML.  We are lucky enough to have

often I learn the most fascinating things just from the commentary.

I can\'t answer your question.  I\'ll bet Craig or Leonard will have a

Oh, just the fact that it\'s a common feature of "primitive" cultures

In the same vein, back in the early 60s, "You Asked For It" showed a

Great site!  Well put together, visually engaging.. a solid 8 out of ten.

Under the conditions existing on Vland, a culture that practices ritual
cannibalism as a means of disposing of the dead will have a lot more
readily available protien and nutrients. 

This won\'t support them in the absence of "adequate" suppkies of
treated local food. But as an *addition* to those supplies it will give
the groups practicing it a definite advantage, Not a *large* advantage,
but an advantage, nonetheless.

Consider two groups, one that doesn\'t eat their dead and one that does.
Both get the same amount of nutrients from the local foods. And that is
enough to survive on. Possibly on the edge of malnutrition, possibly not.

The first group is essentially "throwing away" the *concentrated*
vitamins and other nutrients in the body. The second group gets some
"free" extra nutrients when a member dies. And that quite literally
strengthens them. Because they are getting *better* nutrition.

There *is* a difference between the minimum amount of a nutrient that
you can survive on, and the amount that is ideal. And *that* is the
area whether even ritual cannibalism can make a difference.

This actually applies to the places where it was practiced most
recently on Earth. They believed that you got the strength of the enemy
warrior by eating him. Well, that *extra* protien in what is
essentially a *subsistence level* society *does* give some extra
strength. 

ps. Cannibalism in humans *societies* has *alway* been "ritual".
Because as you note, wholesale killing of humans for the prposes of
eating *does* have problems. But eating people killed for other puposes
is a quite different matter.

Don\'t worry, JTAS #26 will differentiate itself from TC and JTAS25. :)  
Glossy pages, color interior, an editorial, a letters column, possibly an 
"excerpts from TML" column, a monthly comic strip, etc. etc.  Oh, and no

And a fact I came across today that will help scale things:

Thge external tank on the Space Shuttle is over 2.5 kilosteres or about
90,000 cubic feet. That makes it 900 registry tons, or about 180
Traveller displacement tons. I find this interesting...

It\'s actually rather simple to figure (and a *lot* smaller than they\'d
have you believe). As I recall it works out to *well* under 20 km. 

I used a 19 inch TV and a tape of the movie. You freeze the picture
when the Death Star is almost full screen, and measure the size of the
DS, and the size of the equatorial trench. Then you freeze again when
the trench is almost full screen, and measure the width of the trench,
and the width of the area with the landing bay. Repeat until you
measure the size of the landing bay "door" and the size of the
Millenium Falcon as it goes thru. Simple calculations will give you the
diameter of the Death Star in units of the thickness of the Millenium
Falcon. Plug in a "reasonable" value for the thickness, and you have
the size. Which, as I noted, is rather puny.

Me, I want to build a planetoid hull ship... Starting with Ceres (500
km diameter)...

Oh? Various tribes in New Guinea, most of Polynesia, various African
tribes, various Native American tribes, the Aztecs. That\'s for "recent"
history. Archeological evidence from Europe and Asia isn\'t exactly
scarce.

And people will engage in it that won\'t engage in mass-murder? So?

Cannibalism is virtually always *ceremonial*, in addition to whatever
nutritional value it may add.

Cannibalism isn\'t evolutionarily undesirable. I there are a number of
fish and amphibian species that are their own major predator. And a lot
of carnivores will cheerfully devour members of their own species who
crowd into their territory.

They *do* have more reason. If nothing else, it\'s a *major* waste of
usable nutrients to dispose of a dead body by any means *other* than
eating it. That *conserves* nutrients that would otherwise be dispersed
back into the environment.

Killing people to eat them is counter-productive. Eating your dead (in
the environment on Vland) *isn\'t*. 

And this is *not* the same as eating people who have died of
starvation. I\'m talking about death by accident or old age.

The only culture on *Earth* that got as far as writing and still had
cannibalism seems to have been the Aztecs. It\'s usually a trait of
*tribal* cultures. As such, it won\'t be in *history*, as that
*requires* writing.

Contrary to others in this, I don\'t see cannibalism as a major food
source, except possibly while groups are at war with each other. But it
*would* be an important dietary factor.

        Unless, of course, you start building fighters with HEPlaR
auxiliary drives.  With drop tanks for reaction mass and G-tanks for the
crew to supplement their I-comps, things could get quite interesting.

Don\'t forget meson comm.  Nearly unjammable in Trav. All this is way
beyond us.  I do believe in sensor drones.  (In fact, I believe the
Terrans used stutterwarp and the Vilani used J drive.  Definitely
non-canon, and I won\'t posit further.)

There should be rules for drones.

To circumvent militarily restrictive political agreements. Earlier comments
in the list brought up the Graf Spee, a \'battlecruiser\', which was designed
by the German Navy after World War I and prior to World War II. The treaties
that ended WWI limited the size (tonnage) of ships in the German Navy. they
did not limit the size or number of weapons however. So a \'cruiser\' sized
hull was loaded up with \'dreadnaught\' class weapons: Battlecruiser!

Welcome to the TML!  And Hugh, if you consider these "stupid questions,"
you\'re clearly new to the Net as well. :)

All white dwarfs (dwarves?) evolve from main-sequence stars.  A white
dwarf is basically a star with the Sun\'s mass (more or less) crammed into
the Earth\'s volume (more or less).  Start with a cloud of prestellar
matter of around the Sun\'s mass, let it collapse gravitationally, and
you\'ll get...the Sun.  The white dwarf stage only happens after the star
burns for a *long* time, exhausting its core hydrogen and most of its core
helium as well.

It just occurred to me that if your prestellar cloud was massively
hydrogen- and helium-depleted, you might get something like a white dwarf
from the start, though it wouldn\'t be quite as hot.  Of course, clouds
like that don\'t exist in our neck of the woods, and probably don\'t
anywhere other than as exceedingly rare freaks -- the universe hasn\'t been
around long enough to leave severely depleted clouds lying around.

So, any planets of a white dwarf which are original to the system (i.e.,
not captured late in the game) will have been seriously toasted during the
preceding red giant phase; the innermost ones (as you suggest) will have
been entirely vaporized.  This latter might include everything out to 1 AU
for a star like the Sun.

Hope this helps!

Absolutely right.  Measures can be taken.  However, the problem is not
really overcoming a 6g load.  The problem is overcoming inertia, or the
relative closure velocity.  

These velocities may be as high as 200,000 mph between opposing fleets,
and even 40g drives cannot allow a fighter to match vectors then buzz
around a bship.  

Think of submarines instead of aircraft, and you\'ll see a better match. 
By the way, I\'d love to visit your shipyard.  Are you the inventor of

Two words: "Money talks." My FLGS is now among the elite who stock
_every_ IG product so far (even _Starships_) because the Sunday Follies
demo is getting people to _buy_ here. My money, and Vic\'s, and Rodney\'s,
and Will\'s, and the dough of at least five other guys all said the same
thing to my FLGS owner: "Stock T4!"

No FLGS owner can ignore results like these.

While I can see your store owner\'s point about ordering vs. stocking --
look at recent hobby history (CCGs) and a Frank Chadwick _Challenge_
editorial for the disgusting details -- the caution he is showing must
be overcome by evidence to the contrary. He has written off the evidence
you\'ve tried to show him so far as hype, and there\'s also the effort
factor: you\'re asking him to research the facts and so forth. He may
also be thinking that the coming _Babalyon 5_ and _Exile_ games from CEE
and WWGS (gag) are going to be Trav-slayers.

Of course, we disagree: B5 is a lively newcomer and _Exile_ will be
WWGS\' usual triumph of style over substance . . . Trav is the Real Thing
in sfrpgs. Now to convince your UFLGSO . . . .

The problem is that our canonical magic tech for Traveller explicitly
excludes FTL comm...and that\'s precisely what you need to make ap-synth
work over light-second distances and high relative speeds/accelerations.

Congratulations, you\'ve reinvented the towed array! :)  That\'s precisely
how modern subs and ASW surface ships operate, though in this case the
total array length is <mumble> and the sensor spacing more like <cough>
(used to work for Rockwell Marine Systems Division, and I don\'t want the
FBI paying me a visit...). 

One of the major problems faced in using towed arrays is (big surprise)
maneuvering.  When you\'re on a constant course and speed, the array
stretches out behind you nice and straight, it\'s easy to model the
relative placement of the sensors, and life is good.  Turn the ship, and
the array gets a bend in it...it almost acts like there\'s a pulley in the
water, around which the array turns.  Until you drag the whole array
through the turn, it\'s very *hard* to figure out relative placement of
your sensors...not impossible, but hard, and prone to errors.

Of course, in space you wouldn\'t have this problem; dynamics are a lot
simpler in vacuum, as is positional measurement.  And putting your array
on a string rather than as free-flying drones means you don\'t have to put
engines and the like in the sensor pods.  Hmmmmm...you may be onto
something, here!

BTW, if you\'re using Sinclair thread, no need for comm lasers.  It\'s a
superconductor; just multiplex your sensor signals up the cable.

Well... I DO have a copy and it IS for sale!  It seems that my current

        Thanks for the helpful information.  The next question is what would
be the range of the star\'s increase for class M9 through B0 of sizes VI
through Ia?  Has anyone figured this out or is there a formula for
determining this?   I was working on a star system with a type MD star when
my wife brought up the question as to if I could have planetary bodies in
the closer orbits.   
        Also as the star begins to collapse back into itself, would the
gravitational pull of the star drag planets from the outer orbits back with
it into the closer orbits?

The computer\'s use delayed vector/postion information predicted/tracked
by each ship\'s computer to come up with targetting assignments, not the
"real" stuff.  This does not require FTL, just a sacrifice in
information accuracy. Secondly, you are assuming the system works
perfectly.  I am not. This is a great element to add fog and friction to
the game, as parts of the fleet sensor array are more adequate than
others.  

I have posited fleet displacements of 50,000 to 1,000,000 km, rougly 5
ls at max.  I think a system should be able to synthesize valuable
targetting data from this spread, even though inaccuracies are bound to
occur.  The larger the fleet, the larger the error.  This would be an
incentive to keep a fleet tight, rather than spread it all over the star
system.

Of course, nothing ever happens like this with real military hardware;)

1) Very fast heavy cruiser

2) Oversized CA, with enhanced armaments

3) Overpowered CA (larger hull, PP, and proportional armaments)

4) generic term for any cruiser designed for primary fire line (archaic term)

The uses vary; these are from 20th century gaming.

They are striker compatable; by comparing designs with what is shown, they

Is this really true, though?  Suppose you have a fighter, and a 
dreadnought, with identical acceleration capabilities and hull
configurations.  The distance between the ends of the dreadnought\'s
hull, and the point upon which it pivots when it changes its heading,
is going to be considerably longer than the corresponding distance
for the fighter.  Shouldn\'t a dreadnought\'s frame experience more
stress than the fighter\'s, when conducting similiar maneuvers?  Crew,
and acceleration-sensitive equipment, might not fare well close
to the bow and stern of a rapidly-turning dreadnought.  Yes, 
wonderful esoteric materials will make "stiffer" hulls, capable of 
taking more self-inflicted maneuver-related punishment, possible, but
for a dreadnought to maneuver like a fighter, a larger fraction of its
available volume is going to have to be dedicated to braces, inertial
compensators, G-tanks, and so forth...

A problem: big maneuverable dreadnoughts ought to be spherical.  
Being spherical, in a universe with meson guns, is bad, however, and
it\'s also bad because it limits spinal weapon length.  Heavy and
redundant meson screening would help, and if you used a *circular*
or *spiral* "spinal" mount (the "equatorial gun"), you could have
the best of both worlds...

We, cannibalism never started (in that is was never widely

Well, *actually* the "Graf Spee" was called a pocket battleship.  ;-> It
was built the size of cruiser because of size restrictions placed on
Germany after WWI.  It was, for all intents and purposes though, a small
Battlecruiser.

Not even barely!

Oh boy, I get to put my history hat on! ;->

"Graf Spee" was doing commerce raiding in the South Atlantic during the
early days of the war.  She had captured or sunk a number of merchantmen
and the Allies had 20 warships out hunting her, including a carrier and a
couple of battleships.  A British squadron caught up with her off the River
Plate.

The Battle of the River Plate, 12/13/39.  

"Graf Spee" with 6 11-in and 8 5.9-in guns against a British
Squadron consisting of the heavy cruiser "Exeter" (6 8-in guns) and two
light cruisers "Ajax" and "Achilles" (8 6-in guns).  The German Captain,
confident that his guns could blow the lighter British ships out of the
water, closed with them.  He *should* have stood off and destroyed them at
long range because his main guns outranged them by almost 10,000 yards.  He
may have suspected heavier forces were closing, though, and wanted to
quickly silence this group.

The British maneuvered expertly not allowing the German to
concentrate his fire, but they were still badly outgunned.  At the end of
the 80 minute engagement:  "Exeter" was silenced, dead in the water, and on
fire; "Ajax" had lost half her guns and was listing badly to port;
"Achilles" was severely damaged, but still operational; however the "Graf
Spee" had also been badly damaged, cutting her speed severely.  "Graf Spee"
broke off the engagement and limped into Montevideo hoping to make repairs. 


The British light cruisers followed while the "Exeter", after putting out
the fires and relighting her boilers, limped for Port Stanley in the
Falklands.  The Uruguayan government refused to allow the "Graf Spee" to
stay longer than 3 days, and that wasn\'t enough time to complete the
repairs.

Her Captain learned from a German merchantman that a large warship (the
British heavy cruiser "Cumberland" with 8 8-in guns) had joined the
blockade.  He assumed from the description that it was either a
Battlecruiser or a Battleship and he didn\'t think he would be able to
outfight or out run his opponents.  He left most of his crew aboard the
German merchantman in the harbor, sailed out and blew up his ship.

Oh yes, Battlecruisers were around earlier, before WWI in fact.  BC
squadrons were the main contestants at the Battle of the Dogger Banks in
1915 and were heavily featured at the Battle of Jutland in 1916.  

Battlecruisers were a design theory running counter to the heavily armored
Dreadnaught theory.  They were build along side the
Dreadnaughts during the pre-WWI period. They never were really very
effective.  After WWI they continued to be built mainly because they came
in below the naval treaty tonnage restrictions.

The pocket battleships were Germany\'s invention to get around the treaties. 
Germany was more heavily restricted by treaty than the other powers.  "Graf
Spee" and "Admiral Scherr" weren\'t even *real* Battlecruisers, just
up-gunned heavy cruisers.

BTW, I assume you\'ve heard of the "HMS Hood" sunk by the "Bismark." "Hood"
was a Battlecruiser, and "Bismark" took her out with a single shot at over
25,000 yards..that\'s 14 miles!  Ok, that\'s over 23km for all our metric
friends.

Oh, and it took the British 3 battleships, a carrier attack and several
torpedos to put the "Bismark" under.  The big
Super-Dreadnaughts could *really* take a beating and stay afloat! And as
long as they stayed afloat they could make repairs and continue to fight.

[Stuff about not throwing away the nutrition in your dead.]

The fact is that if this was true on Vland, it would be true
on Earth.  Societies were the numbers are limited by the
food supply are not hard to find.

Ritual cannibalism is usually carried on a scale that makes
little difference in the amount of food available.  Also,
it often involves eating parts with symbolic attachement
(such as the heart) and throwing away most of the nutritial
value.  Lastly, there is no clear correlation between
ritual cannibalism and how well feed the society is.

And these are basically almost all the instances world wide.
In fact they only represent a very small portion of the
societies that have existed on the planet.

Exactly who engaged in cannibalism to preven mass-murder?
The fact is that the killing of your enemies in as great
a quantity as you can (be it war or genocide) is an
almost universal trait.  Cannibalism isn\'t.

Human cultures have similarly pressed.  After all, cannibalism isn\'t
prevalent in artic or dessert climates.

The problem occurs on some Browsers because they don\'t support background

I pointed out that IMHO that wasn\'t very extensive, he didn\'t reply back

I\'m using Ibrowse for the Amiga so I can edit the HTML whilst it\'s

Thinking in terms of aerodynamic fighters is not correct here.  Todays
fighter gains advantages through an order of magnitude speed
differential over ships, and the same increse in maneuverablity.  Take
this away and you have a situation akin to Iranian gunboats attacking US
ships in the Persian-strike that-Arabian Gulf.  

A dreadnought will have to have more bracing and icompensators, but 6g
is 6g.  Time to turn and put the thrust vector on the desired point will
be variable depending on the moment of inertia of the craft, roughly
related to the mass.  Fighters and other small ships will always be more
nimble.  But what if the ships WWII fighters were attacking were able to
fly and at the same speed of the fighter?   Much different situation. 
Thse ships will probably have big Vc on each other, which is read "Vee
sub Cee"  and stands for closure velocity.  An attacking fighter will
probably have one chance to attack with short range weapons, then it can
take all the receding shots it wants.  It will take hours to rematch
vectors.

BTW, the vaunted aircraft has probably met its match with directed
energy weapons-I know this threat and it scares the hell out of me. 
Matching vectors in close range to an Imperial fleet is not a good
idea-relative speed is life.

   Except that vac suit technology is an extremely narrow field, which
requires major advances in environmental control, electronics, materials
technology and every other field that goes into putting a suit like that
together.  Otherwise, it would be like having discarding sabot rounds
for a rifled musket.  That might fly on an episode of the "Wild, Wild,
West" (American TV show) but not here.

   As I recall the problem with making an AI computer/robot in the
pre-TNE days was not building it (synaptic processors were expensive but
available) the problem is that the technology isn\'t there to build one
that can keep its sanity for very long (remember the story of the
scientists who keep being put on trial for new crimes their rougue
courier robots committed while on the loose?).  It is not until TL 16
that stable AI becomes possible, and "smart" AI at TL 17.

   Also, the generally accepted tech level of the Second Imperium was
12, with some worlds (presumably Terra being one) that managed to
achieve low TL 13.  By way of comparison, many worlds in the Third
Imperium achieved high TL 15, and several were already TL 16 by 1116.

   My impression has always been that even "novelty tech level" was
suppose to cover one of the broad areas you just mentioned, not
something as specific as a vac suit.  While I might buy a TL 14 robot or
medical scanner (areas that the Second Imperium was supposed to be
"highly advanced" in according to canon), even these would probably not
be available around Sylea, and certainly wouldn\'t have been mass
produced.

>  The Price of these suits is_very_wrong however. 

   Not that I agree that the suit should even exist, but assuming such a
thing were available, I would think that the government would want to
round up as many as possible for study.  An analysis of the wiring alone
would would lead to major breakthroughs in the field of Electronics. 
Thus, it is unlikely that such suits would be available on the open
market.  Also, let me get this straight--people are willing to trust
their lives to equipment that is over 1,000 years old?  Granted, at TL
14 seals are made of better, longer lasting stuff, but they would hold
up for that long?(!)  If you were to buy such a suit (again, assuming it
were available as described), it would be like owning a bottle of wine
corked in 1697--you don\'t intend to ever use (drink) it, but it makes a
lovely conversation piece in the den.

Regards,

Harold

P.S.  Many of you are probably wondering at this point, "is a bloody TL
14 vac suit worth raising a major alarm over?"  The answer is of course
not, unless you look at the larger picture.  My fear is that the
creeping historical revisionism (which began with the changes to the
Sylea subsector) is going to continue, intentionally or unintentionally,
until the background history contained in the pre-TNE books is basically
worthless.

        Well, actually, I have heard from a source who heard it from a
White Wolf staffer that Exile is having some problems.  Firstly, somebody
else copyrighted the name, so it is now The As Of Yet Unpublished RPG
Formerly Known As Exile (TAOYURFKE).  Secondly, WWGS unloaded TAOYURFKE
onto another company and are wishing them the best of luck.

        I\'m not too worried about Exile.

        But as far as WWGS goes, I\'ve got to say that I really like their
system.  I think that how they handle mental and social stats makes a lot
more sense than T4\'s for example...  you have stats for Intelligence,
Perception and Wits (mental horsepower, perceptiveness, and ability to
think quickly in a crunch), and Appearance, Charisma, and Manipulation.
Education is subsumed into the Knowledges branch of skills, and social
status is under a completely different area of the charsheet called
backgrounds.

        I was seriously considering doing a houserule switch to a 9-digit
White Wolf based UPP in my T4 campaign, but I figured that I might as well
give the basic system a whirl before I started retrofitting stuff to it.

        Guilty as charged :).  The pogo stick was indeed my design.

        As far as the fighters go, well, I had in mind something just
barely large enough to pack a small NPAW, with full EMM, that would close
at high acceleration, popping out missiles and countermeasures as it went,
opening up with its NPAW when in range, continuing to fire as it passed,
and continuing to fire once passed.  Of course, this might no longer
qualify as a fighter by Trav standards.  The missiles, would be
accellerating at the same number of G\'s as the fighter, so the enemy
defenses would be presented with a wave arriving at the same time, and
would have to choose between shooting at the missiles or the fighter. The
missiles would only go into hi-G boost at the last minute, to avoid point
defense systems and not have them going off too close to the fighter.  I\'d
think that a successful attack with a wing of these would depend on timing;
you\'d want your capital ships coming within range at about the same time as
the fighters are over-running the enemy line, so that the other side is
rather...occupied as you open up on them.

        Given that I have absolutely zero experience with T4\'s fleet combat
system (I have played SFB and love the ISC ships), it has occurred to me
that I could very well be out to lunch in the Oort on this one, though.

that sacrificed protection for speed.  Their purpose was to screen ahead =
of the main battle line, and to pursue an escaping fleet.  Admiral =
Beatty (IIRC) commanded a battlecruiser squadron at the Battle of =
Jutland in 1916 that got in a completely separate action with the =
battlecruisers of the German High Seas Fleet.
	The HMS Hood, which was mentioned in an earlier post, was built in 1918 =
and represents the ultimate development of the battlecruiser.  She =
displaced 42,000 tons (that\'s water, not hydrogen) as compared to 35,000 =
tons for the best contemporary battleship class, the Queen Elizabeth, =
and was armed with 8 15in guns (IIRC). She was not only the longest but =
the largest warship in the Royal Navy until WWII.  The Hood also played =
up the weaknesses of the battleship when she was destroyed by a single =
salvo from the 14in guns of the Bismarck, one round of which struck the =
top of her "B" turret (that\'s #2 from the bow) and set off the cordite =
charges kept in the ready magazine.  A pretty big debate still revolves =
around whether planned improvements to her armor would have saved the =
ship...check out the WWII newsgroup (soc.history.war.world-war-ii, I =
think) for the continuing discussion.
	The U.S. never really built any battlecruisers, aside from the "Large =
Cruiser" class of warships, numbering two, including the Guam and also =
the Alaska (I think, but someone else mentioned the Alaska as part of a =
planned superdreadnought class that was never built, and I\'ve never =
heard of).  These ships were built near the end of WWII to fight a class =
of Japanese heavy cruisers that turned out not to exist.  They were =
essentially scaled-down versions of the Iowa class, mounting 9 12-inch =
guns and 12 (I think) 5in/38s.  Because they were protected relatively =
well, they probably don\'t count as true battlecruisers.
	The ex-Soviet Kirov-class missile cruisers are sometimes called =
battlecruisers, but these days the term just doesn\'t have the same =
meaning.  The Kirovs (I think they have been renamed now) are big and =
nuclear-powered and pack a tremendous punch in the form of big =
surface-to-surface missiles, but protection isn\'t a key issue in their =
design.  \'Battlecruiser\' in this case sets them off against smaller =
cruiser-type ships.
	In Traveller, I see battlecruisers playing much the same role as they =
did in WWI.  Protection can be sacrificed for speed, but in this case it =
could take the form of a better J-Rating.  There are implications of =
arriving insystem without the support of the heavy ships that need to be =
addressed in this case, though.  The important thing to note is that a =
battlecruiser doesn\'t have to be smaller than a battleship, and the =
firepower could be comparable.
	I hope that this sheds a little light on the question.  Rebuttal is =
welcome!

How about linking some Hi-G missiles to the sensor drones?. As soon as
an aggressor lights up his Active EMS to pick off the drones (assuming
he\'s dumb enough to do this), the attending missiles auto-lock and home
in. Allocate about 6 missiles to each drone and any non-capital ship
gets a nasty surprise.

   There are no stupid questions.  Well, maybe a couple, but they
involve near light rocks and the combination to Strephon\'s person
safe....

   For pretty much all practical purposes, white dwarfs stars evolve
from main sequence stars.  No star starts out as a white dwarf, in any
event, period.  Stars like our Sun start life evolving rapidly from
condensations in nebula to proto-stars and onto the main sequence, where
they remain so long as they have hydrogen to burn.  Once the hyrogen
supply runs out, they begin to expand into the red giant phase, where
they burn helium (the byproduct of all that hydrogen fusion).  Once all
the helium has been expended, the star begins a process of rapid
contraction (which is sometimes accompanied by a violent explosion
called a \'nova\') which results in a white dwarf.  A white dwarf isn\'t
burning anything--the collapse of all that matter into a space much
smaller than the star was originally ensures that the mass (called
degenerate matter) will remain rather hot for many, many years. 
Eventually (and we are talking here about billions of years), the white
dwarf will lose the last of its residual heat and become a black
dwarf--a dead body in space waiting to be recycled by the Universe.

>And could someone please explain "why," either way?  The

   In a star system in which a white dwarf exists, you should place
planets and asteroid belts as though the white dwarf were a small red
giant star.  Why?  Because at one time in the solar system\'s life that
white dwarf *was* a red giant star, and it is highly unlikely that any
new planets would be formed after the red giant contracted into the
white dwarf phase.  This of course is contrary Traveller rules, but then
we are talking about a bit of canon that is just flat wrong, thus I have
no problem disposing of it in the face of scientific reality.

Harold

1.	LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT OF IMPERIUM GAMES
	DELUXE T4 RULES HARDBACK LIMITED NUMBERED EDITION:

	We at Imperium have received lots of complaints and requests for
	a new and improved edition of the Traveller Rule book due to
	grammatical errors, missing errata, and other such mishaps.  As
	many of you know, it was not the current management that was
	responsible for this book, however, in the interest of showing
	you, the patrons, that we care we are considering reprinting a
	new hardback version of the T4 Rule book.  Having read the
	comments from you we are thinking about releasing a new version
	which would incorporate the following:

	A hardback (properly bound version) correcting all of the
	grammatical and typographical errors, as well as, reorganizing
	the layout of certain difficult to follow sections.  Including
	as much missing essential errata as is economically possible
	(i.e. the jump potential table).

	As a bonus, and to partially make up for Starships we would
	include a "Starship design System" within the main rulebook
	which would include all necessary information and would be
	designed by Marc Miller.

	The book would be a one time special edition, with a gold
	foil stamp and individually numbered by the printer.  The
	limited version would only be 1500 copies and could only be
	ordered via the internet.  Delivery would be within three
	business days of our receipt of the book from the printer
	(i.e. priority mail) and would be safely secured and shipped
	in a bubble envelope to protect the contents.  The book 
	would be over 200 pages, and we will have a bunch of new
	Traveller relevant artwork done, and you will finally find
	out how the existing Foss work fits into the Traveller
	Universe.

	Finally, and best of all, we are making this a limited print
	run, internet only offer, so that we can give all of you a
	discount on your purchase to make up slightly for the
	mistakes of the past.  Unfortunately, the cost of redoing 
	this is high, but if you want it done right, then it generally
	costs more.  The cover price would be $32.95, however, for
	people who can show proof of purchase of the first hardcover
	or soft cover rulebook released by IG, we will give a $10.00
	discount so that the price would be $22.95 (the same as one of 
	our ordinary books) + S/H $5.00 in the US, $10.00 
	International.  Proof of purchase can be as easy as you
	E-mailing us and letting us know your name so that we can
	check our records for your first purchase.  We wish we could do 
	better, however, there are economic realities with which we must
	all live within.  

	We are thinking that we would try to have this out sometime in
	March.  As such, we would need to know from you now (i.e. in
	the next 10 days) whether you would order such a product.  We
	would not charge anyone until we 100% confirm that we are
	printing the book, but in order to justify doing it, we must
	first know that this is what you want.  So, please E-mail us 
	and let us know if you would be in or out.  If you have
	comments about what you would like added, please address such
	under a separate E-mail.  The E-mail about your interest should
	be addressed "T4 Deluxe Edition".  On a final note, if interest
	is significant enough, we will also work towards getting each book 
	signed and personalized to the buyer by Marc Miller (BTW ours 
	will show up signed as promised).  Thanks for listening and
	sharing your thoughts about the T4 rulebook with us.

	Courtney Solomon
	President Imperium Games Inc.

2.	TRAVELLER GAME SCREEN EARLY BIRD
	Time to make your gaming experience easier.  IG is proud to
	announce a special product which did not appear on the 1997
	release schedule - "THE TRAVELLER GAME SCREEN".  In
	February, IG will be releasing a four panel, full color, 
	Traveller game screen designed by Marc Miller.  The screen 
	will include essential tables for playing Traveller such as 
	combat tables, Starship Operations, etc.  The screen will be
	easy to read with all of the information presented in a way
	that Marc believes would be the most functional for easy access
	to essential information during game play.  In addition, the
	screen will contain a mini-adventure "Memory Alpha" designed
	and written by Marc Miller.  The screen will be selling for 
	$12.95, but early buy purchasers will receive a $2.95 discount
	making the screen $10.00 even.  Also, due to the light weight 
	of the screen we can ship to you in the US for $4.00 and
	internationally for $8.00.  Also, unlike the previous internet
	orders, you can be assured that you will be the first to
	receive your screen (no more my store has it and I don\'t) as
	we will ship all future internet orders immediately upon our
	receipt from the printer.  So, order your TRAVELLER PLAYERS
	SCREEN NOW!

	Orders must be entered through the online ordering system (which
	will be updated this weekend).  Ordering through e-mail will not
	work.

3.	HARDBACK COUNTDOWN
	There are only 10 hardbacks remaining.

4.	MILIEU 0 / FIRST SURVEY
	The release of Milieu 0 and First Survey will be delayed until
	February 10th, 1997.

5.	CD ROM
	Imperium Games request that I extend a hearty "THANK YOU" to
	everyone that responded to our request for comments and input
	on the Traveller CD-ROM.  IG very much appreciates the input
	and is evaluating the comments.  As IG is now evaluating the
	comments, if you haven\'t put in your comments yet, then now
	is the time.

6.	IG WEB MAILING NEWSLETTER
	We\'re now up to over 390 members.  If you\'re not getting your
	copy and you\'ve signed up for it then your email address in
	our file is probably wrong.

The above was in the latest IG website newsletter. I was wondering; does
this mean that the present design systems, which were done so lovingly and
under pressure by members of the TML and Beta lists, being scrapped? (The
above refers to a potential new Traveller hardcover for those who don\'t get
the list. See the IG website for details). I hope not, as I really like
those systems. Yes, they could stand some re-editing and reconciliation, but
they work and are very good. I wouldn\'t mind seeing Marc help with the above
process, but I hope we won\'t be losing our design systems...

 Dreadnaughts can still be as fast as fighters, but not as manouverable.. 
 Also, this would make for some interesting ships, as you would have some
dreadnoughts that are more manouverable(for evasive manouvers) but not as
powerful and some dreadnaughts that are needles with *massivley* powerful
spinal mounts capable of cracking other dreadnaughts in a couple shots but
that are pretty nice targets.. Altho, you could just stick a unmanned
spinal mount into a sphericial hull(like a apple with a long, skinny pencil
through it).

Does he realize that background colors in table cells isn\'t part of the
HTML 3.2 spec?  Methinks eager-beaver artsiness is here running ahead of
technical (and sensible, and commercially wise) compatability.  I don\'t
want the Netscape 3.0 Mac version hogging my CPU -- I use 2.0.  On my
Amiga, I use Voyager, which also has the problem.  Why would he
deliberately make life hard on customers, when the trick he\'s pulling
isn\'t even that crucial to the page layout?  (Hell, if he\'s so wound up
about colored boxes, he could write a cgi script to serve two different
versions of the document.  THAT would be the responsible way to do it....)

Good idea.  I don\'t believe in g limits though.  Very artificial.  A
good game system should allow versatile design, perhaps allowing much
higher than 6g for fighters and much higher for missiles-depending on
energy/conversion formulas I wonsder if 100g is possible for missiles
with a burst fusion reaction.  Don\'t look for this in rulebooks, it
hasn\'t been written.  For personal edification base your gearheading on
e=mc2 and about a 95% efficiency, weapon the size of a modern torpedo.


Anyone know where Trav\'s 6g design limit really comes from?  Was it an
arbitrary game decision?

We\'ve had an uproarious time playing a homebrewed (pun intended) Star Wars

It\'s even possible to graduate from an academy and end up in the _enlisted_ 
ranks, or so I was told by the Zoomies with whom I went to grad school.  I 
believe you have to screw up fairly badly for them not to comission you, but

Beg to differ.

The Graf Spee was widely described as a Pocket Battleship, but might be
better described as a large armoured cruiser than a battle cruiser.  It was
indeed developed during the period of the Washington Treaty, as a solution
to the problem of developing an effective fast surface raiders.  They were
designed to run away from Washinton-Era battleships, not duke it out with
them.  After they abandonned the treaty, the Germans also developed a couple
of quite good real battleships, which were considered far more dangerous --
the Bizmark was one of these.

The Battle Cruiser was invented at the turn of the century by Admiral Jackie
Fisher during his term as First Sea Lord.  Fisher was also the inventer of
the Dreadnaught itself.  Because early dreadnaught designs were too heavily
armoured and engines were not pwerful enough to pull much over (if memory
serves) 21-22 knots, Fisher specced a ship with the same weapons but far
less armour capable if a good turn more speed.  The idea was that it could
outfight anything which could catch it, and run away from anything it could
not fight.

They were very effectively deployed at the Falklands (1915? - the mind goes)
where they cleaned up the most dangerous fore of German suface raiding
cruisers.  9.2 or so guns against 12" is no contest.

The major problem of the battlecruisers was that they LOOKED like
Dreadnaughts.  When Beattie tried to face the German battle line with them
at Jutland, he was handed his head on a platter.  Beattie\'s squadron was not
known for the quality of its gunnery, which did not help.

They were basicly made obselete by the developemnt of the Fast Dreadnaught
(such as the King George V class, already in service at Jutland).

	I believe it was an arbitrary game decision held over from the time of
Classic Traveller. Note, however, that it was lifted in TNE/FF&S (and, by
extension, in QSDS/SSDS). The only limits now are the ability of the crew
to withstand Gs. And that\'s apparently gotten a boost in the vehicle
system, as well.

Make sure you RELOAD or REFRESH the pages when you go to view them.  I set
meta tags in all of the pages to eliminate page caching, but it\'s up to the
browser to honor the tag.  I\'ve made changes to all the affected web pages
that have been tested under SunOS and Netscape 3.0.  If you\'re looking at a
cached version of the page you\'ll get the old HTML code.

Well <smile> it\'s more testing than most webmasters do, and part of my
qualification for extensive is that I continually check the pages as
they\'re being developed and when they\'re done.  To be honest I simply don\'t
(yet) have a sun box at my disposal to test the pages.  Hopefully that will
change at some point.  In the meantime I do a lot of email exchanging with
the people who do let me know of problems until I can get the site to the
best possible solution.

Maybe I can save my reputation here <grin>.  Your client probably won\'t let
you edit your live html, in which case you can also try turning off
"auto-image loading" to prevent the starfield from showing up.  I\'ve set
the non-graphic page background on the affected pages to a light silver
color to show the black text clearly.

The classic battlecruiser combines the speed of a cruiser with the big guns of 
a big-gun battleship (aka "dreadnought"), in a package about the size and 
displacement of a battleship. [BC Tiger, 1913, 28,430 tons, 704 ft long; BB 
Queen Elizabeth, 1913, 27,500 tons, 645 ft long]  If you think about this for 
a second, you realize the only way to do this is to sacrifice armor, and 
sacrifice armor they did.

Discussing the tactical justification for battlecruisers is difficult, because 
it was such a moving target -- which is somehow fitting for the ship for which 
the saying "speed is armor" was coined.  Initially, BCs were designed to 
harass enemy cruisers operating either as commerce raiders or as fleet scouts.  
They were able to beat anything which could catch them, and run from anything 
which could beat them.  

The problem, of course, was those big guns.  It takes a fleet commander of 
incredibly strong will to order a ship with 8x13.5in guns _away_ from the 
battle line.  As a result, battle cruisers were consistantly called upon to 
perform missions they were not designed to do and doctrinally weren\'t supposed 
to be doing.  As a result, they were not very effective and had a tendency to 
take high casualties.  Whether they were cost effective for doing the missions 
they were designed to do, however, is another question entirely, as those huge 
engines made them almost as expensive as a battleship.

Note that, at the time, BCs and BBs were often grouped together as 
"dreadnoughts" in reference to their all-big-gun nature, despite their very 
obvious tactical differences.

The data on Tiger and QE came from _Conway\'s All the World\'s Fighting Ships 
1906-1921_.  For an excellent discussion of dreadnoughts, see _Dreadnought: 
Britain, Germany and the Coming of the Great War_ by Robert K. Massie.  

For a not-so-excellent discussion, see _Sacred Vessels_ by Robert O\'Connell.  
O\'Connells problem, I think, is that he is unable to separate BCs from BBs -- 
since they were both called dreadnoughts, he treats them the same way, and 
reaches conclusions that may apply to one and not the other, and does not 
differentiate between cases where sound doctrine was ignored and cases where 
the doctrine was not sound to begin with.  As a result, his conclusion (that 
battleships were _never_ effective) is overstated  at best.  It is still worth 
reading for some of the _design_ discussions, however, such as the increases 
in horsepower necessary to achieve incremental increases in speed at peak 
performance, and why someone might conclude that more smaller guns firing 
rapidly are better than big guns.

As well as I am recommending naval books, I cannot recommend _Fleet Tactics_ 
by Wayne Hughes highly enough.  It is a must-read for anyone designing fleet 
engagements.

 It comes from MegaTraveller .. altho in TNE, and as far as I know it does
not apply in those(and it is rather silly), so the only limits on speed are
what your powerplant and crew can take.

   Now see, here\'s someone with Gearhead Virus!

   BTW, 20 km??!  I\'d say it\'s far larger than that, at least 30 km,
based on how large it appears in relation to the Rebel fighters and how
long it takes them to traverse its surface.  Someone around here I\'m
sure has the proper Star Wars RPG sourcebook with the correct answer.

	Please _DON\'T_ do this!  The last thing T4 needs is another ship
design system!  The QSDS and SSDS systems that appeared in the Main Rules
and Starships, respectively, were well received by the Traveller
community.  Though no design system is perfect, they are not only easy to
use but are compatible with each other and with the forthcoming
re-release of FF&S.  Introducing a new, incompatible, system would defeat
the purpose of these previous systems and simply create more confusion
about spacecraft in T4.
	Perhaps the one thing that the buying public did _not_ 
universally despise about the Starships book was the design system.  What 
we couldn\'t stand were the ships that Don Perrin put into the book that 
were not compatible with the design system, and the totally useless and 
amateurish deckplans.
	While we all look forward to Marc Miller\'s greater involvement in 
the T4 product line, his unique contributions would probably be of 
greater use in detailing the background, history, culture, and overall 
"vision" of Traveller.
	Thank you, and Happy Travelling.

   First, you don\'t need to worry about planets around size VI stars. 
That\'s because they are inherently metal poor (and other elements
heavier than helium), and unlikely to have anything other than a few
small hunks of dirty ice orbiting them (probably accidently stripped
from a main sequence star system during a "close" encounter).  If you
are familiar with TNE, that\'s why size VI stars suddenly disappeared
from stellar generations charts carried over from Book 6: Scouts.  I\'m
not sure about a source for the other expansion information, but I\'m
sure the Astronomer down at your local natural history museum will
know.  I have harassed/talked with the gentleman in charge of such
things at the Dayton Museum of Natural History a number of times over
the past several years, and he has been very helpful.

   Something that you should be aware of though: main sequence stars are
highly unlikely to have M type white dwarf companions (contrary to
previous Traveller rules).  Aside from the fact that M type white dwarfs
are basically pretty rare (we have yet to detect more than one or two
despite extensive searching for even fainter objects), it would be the
equivalent in human terms of being introduced to two men, one 25 and the
other 85, and being told they are brothers (have the same mother and
father).  Companion stars are routinely the same age or very close.

>Also as the star begins to collapse back into itself, would the

   Nope, because the gravity of the star would not change.  The pull of
gravity is measured from the center of mass, not the edge of the
object.  Thus, it would be possible to have a star with a sufficently
low density that safe jump points could be calculated from inside the
star (though I wouldn\'t try it).  On the other hand, if that collasping
star novas (blows off a bunch of material all at once), that *might*
change the mass of the star sufficently to cause an outer planet to
change its orbit, making the orbit highly elliptical or even allow the
planet to achieve escape velocity and be thrown out of the star system
entirely (a so-called \'rogue\' planet).  Of course the debris from a nova
can wreak other kinds of havoc as well, though it is unlikely to result
in the kind of "stellar billards" (throwing planets into radically
different orbits) you may be looking for.

Uh, well, I wouldn\'t agree *entirely* with this. The "stock" ships from the
T4 Main Rulebook cannot be designed with QSDS as presented in the Main
Rulebook. So a redesign of the ships with whatever system they *do* decide
to use is probably a must.

And, as far as I can tell, the QSDS/SSDS systems are *not* universally
loved by those people, like myself, who thought FFS stank to high heaven as
an overly (and needlessly) complex and basically useless system. It taints
QSDS/SSDS simply by virtue of being the basis for them. I (and a
significant number of others) would much preferred to have had a High Guard
based system. Were we a majority? Who knows! Would it be a good thing to
change horses in mid stream? I don\'t know -- *I* would say "yes", but I\'m
just as biased one way as you are the other

OK, I think we have a confusion of terms here.  Aperture synthesis is a
trick used to make many small sensors separated by distance X behave like
a single big sensor of width X in terms of resolution.  Its only advantage
is this increase in resolution.

You can easily (well, not at *all* easily, but you *can*) do ap-synth
across 5 ls distances; the trouble is that useful data will be delayed 10
seconds (at minimum) from "real time" because of the requirement of
correlating positional info from all ships involved along with the sensor
data.  In combat, when using sensors for weapon targeting, a 10 second
delay equals utter uselessness.  See the existing impact of flat
round-trip lightspeed lag in BL/BR.

On the other hand, I can readily see a fleet going to a coordinated
deployment for ap-synth sensor sweeps while not in combat.  This would be
a good way to run patrols of a system, for example.  In this application,
the time delay is not harmful.

Ap synth is only the most extreme case of a broader technology called
"sensor fusion," the art of taking data from multiple sensors of many
types at various locations and "fusing" the data into a meaningful picture
of the battle environment.  Sensor fusion is good at finding targets in
noise; you may have seven suspicious IR sources, and fifteen unusual radio
sources...but only two bogies which are both at once.  Suddenly things get
a lot simpler.

Sensor fusion is the Big Thing among a lot of military gearheads just now,
and it\'ll likely be bigger still as computers permeate battle more and
more in the future.  I\'m sure intrafleet comm is abuzz with sensor feeds
from ship to ship during a battle, most of which consist of some variation
on "Our IR sensor sees a 1700K source at 322/184...do you see anything
thereabouts?"  All asked and answered by computers, of course.

    'body' => 'I\'ve seen a lot of disscussion about Battleships,
Battlecruisers and Dreadnaughts and their appears
to be a little confusion as to what each term means.
So here goes my understanding of the terms:

Battleship: The term is derived from the sailing
era \'ship of the line of battle\' or \'line of battle ship\'. It
refers to a ship designed to defeat other ships by
weight of their fixed battery (the modern Russian
Kirov class are battleships).

Dreadnaught: A particular variant of battleship,
distinguished by having it main armarment of
allt he same calibre (to increase the accurate
range of the guns). With a very few exceptions
(a few French and Swedish ships), all battleships
designed after 1905 were dreadnaughts.

Battlecruiser: The term was first used in 1912 by
the RN (the type itself was the brain child of Lord
Jackie Fisher in 1906). It was initially simply an
extension of normal cruiser philosophy, in fact the
first battlecruisers were called armoured cruisers
like their predecessors from 1906 to 1912. Their
original role was simply that of cruisers (scouting,
commerce raiding and protection). The first
battlecruisers combined the speed and level of
protection of a regular armoured cruiser with the
firepower of a battleship. This lead to their use as
a fast division of the line of battle (and the destruction
of three of them at Jutland and subsequent radical
revision of the design parametres). The later
battlecruisers grew to be considerable larger than
battleships, combining the speed of a cruiser with
a level of protection only slightly inferior to that of a
battleship; they sacrifised firepower instead of
protection. If one looks closely at the last US
battleships (the Iowas) one finds that they are in
fact battlecruisers. Same level of firepower and
protection as the previous North Dakotas and South
Carolinas, but with 10,000 extra tons used to get
cruiser speed. A traveller battlecruiser might be say
a jump 5 or 6 capital ship.

Incidentally, the Admiral Graf Spee (and her two
sisters Deutschland and Admiral Speer) were
not battlecruisers. They were simply large
commerce raiders (12,000T, 6x28cm guns,
3 inch armour, 28 knots), that Graf Spee was
defeated by three cruisers is hardly suprising.
Even the two light cruisers were faster and far
better protected.

When the first Europeans arrived in the late 18th
and early 19th Centuries, one of the major things
they noticed was the extremely poor diet of the
Maori. NZ had only one large animal suitable as a
major protein source (the Moa), which had been
hunted to extinction by the Maori about 100-200
years earlier. The only other sources of protein
were a small rat, a small (and compartively rare)
dog (neither native to NZ), various birds (none
larger than a small parot) and some poorly
exploited coastal resources (The Maori lost their
sea going abilities with a few generations of the
migration). The Maori practiced cannibalism to a
far greater degree than any other polyinesian
culture (not just enemy warriors, but their women
and children too were killed and eaten). There is
evidence to support that the Maori raided with the
object of gaining captives to eat (much as the Aztecs
made war to gain captives to sacrifice). Every
anthropologist who has studied them has come to
the same conclusion: the root cause of this was a
lack of protein sources. The cannibalism was
justified by the ritual element, but it was neccesitated
by the lack of alternatives.

>>What does this show about the Vilani?

>Well, in fact the point still remains either way

Or no less reason than the Maori. (aside: don\'t you
mean Solomani? the Vilani are humans). One thing
that would be likely to be different however is that **if**
the Vilani were cannibalistic at one point, it would have
probably been quite widespread and they would be
unlikely to be ashamed of the fact. It would not be a
\'Dirty little secret\', more just a dispassionate fact.

Here\'s an interesting idea to bounce off people. One
factor which might restrain cannibalism in Vilani
culture: the Shugilii. Their power came from control
of the food supply, other Vilani could be eaten without
their intervention.

Not quite right, recent evidence indicates the cause
of her loss was detonation of lose stored 4inch AA
ammunition amidships which then detonated the
six 21inch torpedoes in the tubes, which broke
her back (a clear flash amidship was seen from
POW a few seconds before the main explosion,
and Hood\'s turret armour was proof against the
15inch shells at the range of engagement).

The Iowas themselves are battlecruisers, 10,000Tons bigger
than the North Carolinas and South Dakotas with the same
level of protection, same firepower and cruiser speed. A classic
battlecruiser.
However the US did plan and start six battlecruisers after the
1st WW (argueable the six worst ever designed). They were
killed by the Washington treaty, but two became the carriers
Lexington and Saratoga.

The problem is that you have to combine and correlate the data streams.
Which means that you can\'t have both large distances *and* real-time
performance. 

For example, at 5 ls, you have ship A sending data to ship B, which has
to know "exactly" how long it took for the data to cross the gap, as
that\'s one of the parameters in the calculations. 

If it\'s "exactly" 5 seconds, then each ship "combines" the data it
receives directly with the data received 5 seconds later from the other
ship. The combining involves various things like trig and other messy
stuff. But it all boils down to "A saw X1 from direction Y1 at time Z1, B
saw X2 from Y2 at Z2". You combine the info and triangulate. 

So at 5 ls, you have a "data lag" of the 5 seconds it takes the signal
to cross the distance *plus* the processing time. 

And since the distance *will* vary, even if only by a little bit, that
changes the point in the your datastream that you are comparing with
the datastream from the other ship.

A good rule of thumb to remember is that light moves at about 1 foot
per nano-second (actually 11 point something inches). So 1 nanosecond
error anywhere is about a foot.

Reading the latest Scientific American gave me a weird idea for a
weapon. They were talking about very high energy cosmic rays. For
instance aparently about once a year a square km area will get a cosmic
ray of about 50 *joules*. 

In other words, a *single* atomic nucleus accelerated so close to light
speed that it has the energy of a well thrown *rock*.

Lord only knows *how* you\'d do it, but I pictured a weapon that fires
such particles. Upon hitting air they\'d induce a *huge* shower of
secondary particles. So in effect, the output is a narrow cone of very
high energy particles.

While the initial particle stops in a matter of cm, the secondaries
will go for km....

It isn\'t practical, but think of it as a way of testing the design
limits of your weapons design system. Treat it as a gauss weapon or a
mass driver, with a projectile of infitesmal mass, and incredible
velocity. :-)

Ah! But the rate at which the ship can change orientation has little do
do with the rate at which the ship can change *direction*. As long as
the ship can manage a 180 degree flip in significantly less than a
turn, rotational speed has no effect on course changes.

This is a consequence of the lack of air that folks keep overlooking.

Spiral isn\'t a possibile configuration. But *circular* IS!.

Also, going by what hass been learned in building particle accelerators
for *research, it\'s safe to say that the beam(s) can go around the ship
several times. It\'s easiest to have them exit at a tangent to the ring,
but that\'s not really a problem. 

Also, with decent amounts of "standby" power, and a good design, you
can do several interesting things. First, you can maiuntain a
"circulating" beam. That is, many many bursts, oor even a continous
stream, circling all the time. And you can have multiple firing ports
for one ring. So with one ring, you could fire several shots at the
same time! But they\'d have to be in different directions. Still, it\'s
useful.

If the design rules *don\'t* allow for this, they *should*.

For an account of such weapons taken to extremes, read Fritz Lieber\'s
"The Wanderer". It has battles between *planet* sized ships, using
particle beams from things like linear accelerators running clear
through them, and circular ones wrapped around them.

Um, isn\'t that _South_ Dakota and _North_ Carolina classes?  <g>

The "Iowa\'s are battlecruisers" argument is one I have heard before, and I 
just don\'t buy it.  The key distinction between BBs and BCs is in the areas of 
armor protection.  As you pointed out, the Iowa-class were just as well-
armored as their predecessors (belt armor was .1 inches thinner, but turret 
armor 1.armor was 1.7 inches thicker, and bulkhead was .3 inches thicker) -- 
they _could_ stand in the battle line and absorb punishment, whereas a 
battlecruiser could not. If you call a ship as heavily armored as a BB a BC, 
then you might as well designated the South Dakotas as being "slow BCs".  

I think the fuzziness here is due to two factors.  First, the role of the 
battleship had changed by the time the Iowa class was laid down, when it was 
apparent that if a battleship was to have a meaningful role (and hence a 
reasons to be built), it had to keep up with the carriers, and that meant 
speed, which in turn (for hydrodynamic reasons) meant a longer hull.  Second, 
the US was committed to being able to fit its ships through the Panama Canal, 
which meant that the ships could not get any wider (they have about a foot 
clearance in the locks as is), which further optimized the ships for speed.  
And so a new category, "fast battleship", was born.

What does this have to do with Traveller?  I think it serves as a bit of a 
lesson.  Traveller players have always been better than the designers of some 
other games (e.g., _Starfire_), about simply running WW2 through the science 
fiction converter to get space combat.  It\'s always good to analyze what the 
ship is supposed to do and rate it that way than simply use an historical 
system.  Such systems become obsolete with time.

Judging by the lack of a fighter\'s survivability under Traveller\'s
ship-to-ship combat system (any version previous to T4), a fighter
seems to be pretty useless as a primary offense. The caveat for T4
is just because I\'m waiting for the fixes to be published.

Basically, if you see a fighter, it\'s *dead*, and so is the badass
pilot/gunner your enemy paid big credits to feed, house, and
train. Hi-G missiles, even at TL 10, should be just as smart as any
living pilot for target acquisition purposes without the cost and,
more importantly, *time* for training. One of the great things
about a detailed design system like FF&S is that we were no longer
limited to the arbitrary 6G accel limit. Having this limit apply to
a merchant as an IComp threshold was acceptable. Applying it to an
unmanned missile was not. After all, there are fighter pilots today
who experience 6Gs in aerial combat with no IComp other than their
flight suits and keep fighting. Heck, some have gone past that and
still kept going, *extremely* unpleasant though it is.

Yes, missiles are limited in fuel/power regardless of the TL.
So, what? Lower TL missiles can have the same performance as
a TL15 missile; they\'ll just be alot bigger. Any design
system worth the money paid for it will allow for this.
For that matter, a TL15 dreadnought with the same capabilities as
a TL12 dreadnought should be and would be smaller than the TL12
version.

IMO, *fighters* are a waste of time and wouldn\'t exist in any
kind of decent space navy. Unmanned sensors drones and missiles
would be used extensively with DE weapons in a secondary role.
And what would be the meanest ship around? The one that carried
the most missiles, the best point defense, and could take the
most punishment, i.e. a dreadnought. Telling a corsair a system
contains a squadron of fighters will start him/her thinking of
how to avoid them. Saying there\'s a fast, hostile dreadnought
based in the same system will make *anyone* think long and hard
about even jumping in.  Geez, even the name gives me the creeps!

I haven\'t played T4 yet so I don\'t know how this could be adapted but you
could probably assign a crit distance and a morale to NPC groups as a
whole. I would be in favour of letting PC\'s make up their own minds about
ducking.
By the way I read the other day that as far as police type shootings go the
most common wounds recieved in gun fights was to the hands. Under the
stress of a gunfight peoples vision shrinks to a tunnel and the focus on
the gun pointed at them and shoot at it. Apparently they also loose their
hearing, I don\'t just mean from the shots.
Looking forward to any other ideas on how to implement this in T4 as I will
be playing/running some soon.

If you\'re collecting errata for CSC, please get in touch with David

errata should get in touch with David Bullock

John, I agree so much with your points that I copied your post verbatim,
added my support for it, and resent it to IG. The only reason I\'m not
using SSDS and QSDS is that I\'m *tired* of penning in fixes into a

I thought that a circular PAWS was extremely susceptible to battle
damage, i.e. a single hit which disrupts the circle takes out the
weapon. Someone on the TML did post FF&S-based design rules for such
a weapon and I believe it mentions this weakness.

I have a query in to MWM about it.  Hopefully, it just means that Marc 
will be re-editing the system and explanations to make it more usable, 
and more clearly and completely described.  Changes like putting all he 
starships data in one place, rather than strewn over several chapters, 
with some paragraphs seemingly inserted at random places as it is now 
(witness the final paragraph on p 98, which contains vital information 
about travelling in normal space, yet which does not belong under the 
overall heading "Trade Customs" which it has been placed beneath).  

As soon as I find out what was meat by the statement in the web 
newsletter, I\'ll post it.  Or maybe Marc will see all this and let us 
know. :)

These are classic Battleships.  Fast battleships, but battleships
nonetheless.  See below for qualities fo a battlecruiser.

Arguable.  Kirovs are "cruisers" because there is simply no "line of
battle" for a battleship to stand in anymore.  If you define battleships
as simply the larges class of ship which uses direct fire (as opposed to
aircraft), they are that.

Sorry, everything I\'ve ever seen about battlecruisers says they are
intended to "bridge the gap" between Battleships and Heavy Cruisers.  They
require high speed to match cruiser classes, battleship armaments, but
other factors (such as armor) are less important.

The word "cruiser" imnplies long distance cruising ability, and is usually
associated with ships capable of commerce raiding (which they rarely did)
or as scouts for the battle fleet.  Battlecruisers, as originally
concieved, were meant to be able to sink these cruisers.  In practice, the
battlecruisers were putinto the line of battle with full, properly
armored, battleships.  This was to their detriment at Jutland (one of the
only major multiple battleship engagements of any war).

Really we should be asking on Sci.military.naval where there are some
serious "battleship gearheads".  Everything I\'ve said has been hashed and
rehashed over there.

And since no one has mentioned it in awhile, both the sci.military and the
sci.military.naval (and rec.aviation.military) are excellent sources of
info on new technologies in the military for use with our favorite RPG.

Actually there are solid reasons for the pages being layed out the way they
are.  The starfield background is a crucial part of the look/feel for the
Science Fiction aspect of the site.  For small amounts of text, it\'s OK to
use white text on a black background.  For "acres" of text like the library
pages or price lists, it is a proven fact that black text on a light
_solid_ background is easier on the eyes.  Reading white/light text on a
black background with stars is definitely a big nono for something like the
year 1112\'s TNS news.  Neither decision was random at all, but carefully
thought out.

Maybe at some point I will have the time resources to do that, providing
that I can determine which user agents can\'t handle the codes, and have
have time to rebuild and maintain multiple page layouts.

In the meantime I\'m not deaf to the issue, on the new splash screen there
is now a line at the top that says "click here if you have problems" and
will carry you to a plain page going over the problems and possible work
arounds.

"Honor Harrington" series, -David Weber.  Some of the best military SF
written since Starship Troopers.  Even my wife, who dislikes militaristic
stuff, loves these.

The works of Bruce Sterling.  Best known as a cyberpunk, his
Shaper/Mechanist universe has some interesting ideas for a Traveller GM.

"Hyperion", -Dan Simmons.  The best SF novel of the 1980s, IMHO.  There are
two sequels, but they drop off in quality.

"Legacy of Herort" and "Beowulf\'s Children", -Niven, Pournelle, and Barnes.
Wonderful novels set on a newly colonized world.. today\'s lesson is don\'t
mess with the ecology.

Spider Robinson\'s "Callahan\'s Place" stories.  Great fun, and your bar
encounters will never be the same.

"Flandry" series, -Poul Anderson.  Multiple stories of the ever-resourceful
agent of the Terran Empire.

"A Fire Upon the Deep", -Vernor Vinge.  This book is beyond description.
I\'m on my second reading, and I\'m still in awe.

"Worldwar!" series, -Harry Turtledove.  what if the aliens invadedduring
WWII?  three books so far, and it\'s getting better.

"Retief" series, -Keith Laumer.  some of the best, funniest SF ever.

"Midshipman\'s Hope", -David Feintuch.  First of a seies, haven\'t read the
rest yet, about a very young officer.  Age of Sail in space.

The reason I brought this battleships thingy up here was to get the
"feel" of TMLers for this subject.  How are ships employed in the Third
Imperium?  Is WWI/WWII the precedent or should we be looking to our
wargames to give the answer.  

To me all games are based on assumptions.  Basing conflict and combat
sytems to model a historical  event is as likely as not.  The only thing
we really know from history is that it probably won\'t look like we are
depicting it.  And we won\'t be around to care(probably.)

So let\'s have fun!

	Very true. I had a friend married to a zoomie who\'d wound up serving as an
Airman First Class instead of a Lieutenant. It\'s also possible for ROTC
students who wash out of the program for one reason or another to be called
to active duty as an enlisted.

	I think that was his point... the "stock" ships that were in both the

The last assignement anyone wants in my campaign is the  coveted
"fighter jock."  Read missile pilot.  Fighters exist to strike and
screen, while the cruisers and tougher do the heavy fighting. Ships go
through magazines of missiles like there is no tomorrow. Which there
won\'t be.

This is an idea I came up with last night, based on the address MM sent
his last message to the list from.  (cardsharks@aol.com)

T4 is coming out with several new products over the next few months. 
People seem to be awaiting them eagerly, especially with anticipation of
increased quality.  

As the starship building and combat system matures, supplements will
probably come along detailing Imperial and other forces.  In the past,
these have been in a book, such as Fighting Ships.  What if in addition
to the book, a card set was put out.  Basically something like the
"Magic" type games floating around lately?  

The edge is that these cards would not only be playable as a relatively
simple card game, but would ALSO have the SSDS stats for use as a
supplement to the Traveller RPG.  As such they could be used in multiple
ways, and possibly draw new players in.  

This is just an idea, but I would like to see the interest in it.   Has
this been brought up before?

Could we presume that vessels operating together would have some type of
synchronized timekeeping, such as an atomic clock, in each ship, with each
message between ships being time & velocity stamped so that each receiver
could adjust the data for integration to local data? 

We should also assume a really good (and closely gaurded) encryption on the
interchanges, or enemy intercepts would be right dangerous.

Adventure possiblity: trying to obtain a given unit\'s encryption code or
seeking to recover said code.

I liked both HG and FF&S; instead of another system, I would like to see a
refinement of what we have. Perhaps after the errata and presentation
problems in SSDS & QSDS are fixed and the revised FF&S (naval architects
handbook?) are out, a short form design sequence that boils the QSDS down
further into a more HG format can be developed. 

Players and refs are going to have one of several approaches to ships:

1) Just gimme the ship and let\'s get on with the game.

2) That\'s a great ship, but I want to (add/change) <whatever>, can I do it?

3) I want to make my own ship, where is the catalog of parts?

4) I want to make my own ship, where is the drafting table?

We need to take the material we have and provide an integrated methodology
for each of the approaches, not keep redoing it in search of a \'perfect\' system.

Systems are only perfect as long as the sales rep is within shotgun range.

Andrew,

I don\'t think this is worth much debate, but the Iowa class ships were true
Battleships, not Battlecruisers.  They certainly were as fast as many
previously built cruisers, but they did not sacrifice armor protection to
gain that speed.  They gained their speed with larger engines, a longer
hull, and lower weight/strength armor than previous BBs. They still sported
a very thick armor belt and heavily armored decks and superstructure. 
Cruisers just didn\'t have this sort of protection...and battlecruisers were
really just cruisers built to the same displacement and carriing the same
weapons as BBs.

Look at the Bismark:  41,000 ton displacement, 30+ knots speed, 8 15-in
guns, massive hardened steel armor belt...she certainly was a battleship! 
Now look at the Iowa:  45,000 ton displacement, 30+ knots speed, 9 16-in
guns, massive STS steel armor belt (Special Treatment Steel was introduced
during the war and has up to 30% more strength/inch as hardened
steel)...also a true battleship!

If the US had built BCs during the 42-45 period they likely would have been
40+ knot ships.  They also wouldn\'t have had the thick armor belt at the
waterline that the Iowas sported.  You can\'t compare Iowa class to the
North Carolina class and say just because the Iowa was faster it wasn\'t a
BB....*every* class of ship was getting faster, and every class of ship was
getting better armored too!  They weren\'t getting up-gunned because the
technology had maxed out at 16 to 18-in guns.

The distinguishing feature between BBs and BCs is really armor
protection...the armor belt in particular.  BCs sacrificed that protection
to shed mass, thus to gain speed.  Other than that BBs and BC were *about*
the same size and mounted about the same
weaponery.  OTOH, it is true that BCs tended to be longer than BBs, in fact
they had about the same length to beam ratio as cruisers. (That\'s another
reason to call them battleship sized cruisers.)

An interesting thing to me has to do with the Length to Beam (width) ratio
of various classes of ships.  Historically, ships have been growing longer
and longer, SOLs of the 18th century were about 3x1, the DNs of WWI were
around 6x1, WWII BBs were up to 7 or 8x1, and modern carriers are 9x1, 10x1
or more.  Simply increasing this ratio has tended to increased ship
displacement because the ship\'s beam really haven\'t decreased.  The
increases in length have come about because, all things being equal, in
water longer means faster. Smaller classes of ships usually have a ratio
somewhat bigger than larger contemporary ships.

However, what a ship is *called* isn\'t really worth an argument.  

What I\'m concerned with is finding a way to bring the 1880-1920 ship combat
flavor to Traveller.  I\'d *prefer* a model closer to 18th century "age of
sail", but I don\'t think we can get that.  What I don\'t want is an 1940+,
"age of airpower" flavor.

We need ships of about the same speed. IMO: Six to one from slowest to
fastest is acceptable, but twenty to one isn\'t.

We need armor to play a bigger role in ship design.  IMO:  Can the Meson
guns, and require weapons that penetrate thick armor hides. 

We need to be more aware of mass.  IMO:  The *mass* of armor should play a
dominate role in ship acceleration.  Certainly we can base most of that on
an abstract mass based on displacement, but armor should be calculated
seperately and needs to be specific not abstracted.

We need to match our guns to our armor.  IMO:  Weapons and armor design
systems need to be rationalized somehow so they work together better.

Before Imperial Fleets jump they spend a good bit of time syncronizing
jump vectors.  Timing is essential.  I still think useful data could be
passed and used for target allocation and sensor applications.  The
rewards are too great to write it off as "unfeasible."

Addmitedly, I only know a bit about sensor fusion, I just drive \'em not
build \'em.  How accurate could a system like this be?  

If two ships in close proximity(100 km for example) use ap syth, how far
out do you go?  Maybe packets of ships use the system, then simply relay
their findings to the rest of the fleet for correlation.  That way you
overcome c-lag.

Theories, thoughts, suggestions or anti-six limbed prejudice?

   I prefer to think that Marc Miller has in mind some minor adjustments
in layout--the final numbers will still come out the same.  The plain
fact is that dumping the current system for a completely new one would
make IG the laughing stock of the RPG industry.

First of all, the animals listed (and you left out
lizards and insects, both of which are quite poplar
in some cultures) are perfectly good sources
of protein.  Second, if protein was that big
a deal, why didn\'t they find a way to exploit
coastal resources (other cultures don\'t have
any problem)?  Lastly, it for many cultures
people would exist indefinately without meat
and there are cultures that have given it
up _voluntarily_.

This is a very good point.

When designing a naval force, rollplay the naval high command.  What is the
political situation and how does it effect the military situation.  Is a new
ship needed to counter a new problem?  Is a new ship needed to give an
advantage over a particullar opponent?  What is the current or future military
doctrine?

Design the ship for the current or possible future needs.  Clasification is
great for comparison with another force.  Instead of building a battleship or
battlecruiser, build a ship with a powerful meson spinal mount and high jump
capability.  Afterwards you can classify you ship as a battlecruiser, strike
cruiser or whatever.  Your opponent will probably call it something else
entirely. ;>

Each ship should have a purpose ... or multi-purpose.  A balance navy will
probably have ship capable of patroling shiping lanes, ships for anti-piracy,
main line ships designed to survive heavy combat, strike ships designed for the
purpose of carrying the war to the enemy, and many types.

I have enjoyed reading these posts.  I knew this was a subject that would
produce as many diffent ideas as there are people interested.

This is a great idea!  I would be very interested in this.  I might make
something like this now for my current game.

David,

I have been trying to gather up the errata for CSC and VDS. I have sent
several messages to Greg asking for clarifications that I have found so far.

Hey, I like this! Back when I was using High Guard, I wrote ship
stats on 3x5 cards for reference during combat, making it easier and
faster to run. The cards described above, *if done properly*, could be
used in such a role, as well as trying to tap into the card-trading
market.

IMO, these cards should include detailed Travelleresque external views
of the ship being described on one side with the SSDS stats on the
other.
What I\'d like to see is a side view with fore and aft views. Don\'t know
if it\'s cost effective, though.

From what I\'ve gleaned from the previous posts on DNs, BBs, and
cruisers, look to the available technology, then the environment
the tech is going to be used in. For example, PAWS will lead, IMO,
to capital ships with a great deal of redundancy among surface
installations, heavy armor, and power dedicated to weaponry,
resulting in relatively slow ships and naval slug fests.
Meson weapons will lead to light armor and power dedicated to
screens, resulting in faster ships and an increased change of
hi-g, passing engagements. Hull shape would be whatever gives
the best chance of survival in the most commonly expected types
of engagement.

Big secret Dave, I have been doing superb renders of Traveller starships
for a long time.  I\'ve been working loosly with DGP.  The art, if
desired by someone willing to produce it, is not a problem.  It is done
by me, and I consider it nearly BAB5 quality. 

I specifically render in a painting-like manner, because of various
constraints. I love Traveller and want to see it triumph. This is my
motivation, but I want to do this RIGHT.  Check out Dave Golden\'s page
under Naryanganjo Corridor to see what I mean.  That was my first good
render several months ago. 

I don\'t do Foss.  Just Traveller.  THAT is why I need to know the way
starship combat is going to work

- -BECAUSE I HAVE TO DEPICT IT.

Hope this brings some light to T player eyes!

I agree the future will not mimic the past, particularly not in
space(WWII example.)  The problem is that we don\'t want to use a system
that doesn\'t represent reality to any degree.  (i.e. The question does
it give a bunch of lightly armed ships advantage over bigger, better
armed ones due to numbers?  Is this reality?)

What is the precedence or justification for this, other than "that\'s
what the game system says happens?  These are difficult questions, and
it comes down to how do you want to establish your universe?  The
fundamental assumptions of the game come from this basic question.

Seeing as the T4 book, to my knowledge, isn\'t very wieldy for the design
of very large high-tech ships, T4 has all the space in the world to
evolve.  I\'m not even sure Sylea has any truly big ships to test this
out...yet.

But they will come, and all of those glorious battles throughout our
shared history will get to be fought.  We need to have an idea of the
governing ground rules behind these fleet engagements-who is fighting
and with what?  What is the "Dreadnought" that shakes the navies of the
46th century?

Again-we decide, but our decisions have tremendous ramifications.

As a side note, I DO NOT want to rengineer systems or whatever.  I just
want it to work with as little effort as possible, producing results I
can say "Yeah, It probably would work that way."

OK, here\'s my two cents worth.  Note that this is NOT an Official Answer,
just my point of view at the current time.

> as individual munitions?

From a practical point of view, there is (currently) only one official T4
space combat system.  That\'s the basic one that\'s included in the T4
rulebook.  

There is an additional, un-official (but IMHO, highly recommended) system
that\'s available from my Web site http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar/rpsc/

This system is aimed mainly at small battles between a limited number of
ships, and treats missiles in volleys (a group of identical missiles, all
fired from the same ship at the same time, targetted at the same enemy ship)


When other official combat systems are available, and what options
they will offer, is something I can\'t speculate on with any certainty.
For purposes of designing NAH, I think most of the members of the Beta
list are envisioning something like the T:TNE BL+BR system, with revisions
and extensions.

In RPCS, it\'s pretty simple: the number of tubes (launchers) you\'ve got is
the limit on the size of a volley.  For purposes of saturating the defense,
you want to make the volleys as large as possible (launch enough missiles,
and the target won\'t have enough lasers to shoot them all down).

The maximum number of missiles you can have in flight is limited by the MFDs
available.  Ideally, this limit should be large enough that you can fire
your maximum volley each turn and controll all of the missiles for their
entire flight duration.  Frequently, that ideal won\'t be attainable (and,
similarly, a present-day US Navy Aegis missile cruiser with a VLS launcher
can launch more missiles at once than it can provide terminal guidance to).

The assumption as that CT/MT/T;TNE missiles were \'controlled\' (under control
of the firing ship up to the point of impact) unless otherwise specified.

I think other people have this pretty well covered, but the basics are that
a ship\'s ability to Be Elsewhere when it\'s being shot at have to do mainly
with it\'s ability to spin around it\'s axes.  THIS in turn is inversely
related to the ship\'s size (overall length, actually), so that larger ships
are inherently slower; and the ship\'s G-compensation, so that ships with
better G-compensation can afford to turn more quickly.

A ship designed with QSDS or SSDS today will be in reasonable shape as far
as this type of agility goes; and on par with most other ships of the same
displacement and configuration.

This is not going to happen.  In QSDS/SSDS/NAH, a ship that\'s rated at 5G
DOES actually make 5G in combat (as opposed to High Guard, where a ship that
was rated at 5G Agility-0 actually couldn\'t move when in combat).

This was a major pain in MT.  I think we\'ve got a reasonable way to avoid it
in NAH.  MOST starships will mass less than 15 metric tons per displacement
ton; if so, the default calculations will work just fine.  IF (for example,
due to very thick armor) you exceed this amount, then you\'ll need to go back
and re-figure the maneuver rating.

In MT, the power plant was a major source of mass in the ship\'s design; in
T4, it won\'t be such an important component of the ship\'s overall mass.
This will also help reduce the number of times you have to iterate the
design.

I used to use a spreadsheet for designing MT ships; it was set up so I
entered the desired performance, and pressed the \'recalc\' key until the
design either diverged (quickly inflating to infinite volume), or converged
on a workable maneuver drive and power plant.  I recall having to hit it 15
or 20 times for most ships; if I\'d had to do that by hand, I\'m sure I would
have gone mad.

I certainly don\'t want to have to do something like that with NAH.

   Actually I was just using sabots as an example.  I could have also
said an afterburning jet engine on a WWI vintage biplane or a Roman
Centurian carrying a flintlock musket.

   For sake of argument, sabots are something that doesn\'t exist for
firearms in 1855.  Had someone actually developed one (and I would still
argue that you are trying to put 20th century thoughts into a 19th
century head), their expense would have kept them from being massed
produced.

   Agreed, otherwise the Chinese would now rule the world, having
developed firearms a hundred years or more before everyone else even had
gunpowder.  My point is that the development of a TL 14 vac suit isn\'t
possible until all the other things that go into it have been
developed.  No A-bomb without advances in explosives technology, no
light bulb without advances in the understanding of how electricity
works.  Saying, "well the Second Imperium just happen to be that
advanced in this one area" doesn\'t wash with me.

	Do you know any good sources of information on "Atlantis Warrior"

I\'ve lurked too long on this subject I think.

It has always been my observation that in Traveller, in all its forms, 
ship detection was never a really big problem.  Considering the sensor 
capabilities of most of the published warships ( and the Donosev class 
scouts ), locating your enemy insystem should be insanely simple.

This should affect the ships in a large way.  Speed is not necessarily a 
problem.  I think ships would be bigger, heavily armed, and certainly 
heavily armored.  It seems that the naval strategy to have in Traveller 
would be to think big.  I think that since hiding is nigh on impossible, 
you would want a ship designed to take as many hits as possible.  A 
high manuever drive, high jump drive, and as much area and energy as 
possible for weapons.
	If you\'re going to be seen and known for what you are almost 
immediately, then you need to to have every ship able to take as much 
punishment as possible.  Most planets are going to be arsenels themselves 
(read meson gun emplacements ).  I agree that fighters ( and for that 
matter, Gazelles ) would be practically useless.  Why do you need a 
small, fast ship to scout things out for you, if you can see everything 
anyway?
	Maybe I\'m totally off base with this, but I just think that 
starships would just keep getting bigger and bigger and able to withstand 
more hits and be able to dish out more firepower.  It is space after all, 
and why should we be constrained to a million tons?  Build a Death 
Star, put a J-6 drive in it, put a M-6 drive in it, armor it as heavily 
as possible, put every gun you can possible fit on it and send it forth.
The only restraint I can forsee is how much the navies wish to spend for 
their behemoths.

Thats my opinion, I could be wrong.

As one of the people who originally claimed the TL 14 vac suit was not
"worth raising a major alarm over", I now have to agree with Harold. The
solution I used was to postulate the TL 14 items were not actually relics
from the Rule of Man, but from a contemporary TL 14 civilization. This
explained the source of the high-tech equipment, explains how "ancient
relics" were still functional, provided lots of neat adventure hooks, and
remains compatible with pre-Third Imperium history. In fact, it was to be a
major theme in my campaign.

However, as another poster pointed out, the existence of a TL 14 planet in
Mileu 0 does not square with earlier published material and the Third
Imperium timeline. Normally this would not bother me, since it is after all
my campaign. For example, I never felt compelled to try to reconcile events
in other GM\'s campaigns with my own. But now I\'m not so sure. The
difference with Traveller is that it *does* have a well-planned timeline,
and I would like to remain consistent with it if I can. The Third Imperium
is so vast that I could imagine that all the Traveller campaigns are really
taking place at the same time in the same universe. In this light, Mr.
Hale\'s fear is well-founded; inconsistencies in the published canon can
lead to wildly diverging campaing histories and make the claim that the
Imperiums in Mileu 0 and Mileu 200 are the "same one" a farce. Is this a
problem? I don\'t know. For example, Chaosium made no effort that I am aware
of to force their 1890s, 1920s, and 1990s Call of Cthulhu adventures to
follow a single timeline, yet each Cthulhu mileu is enjoyable in itself.
Does Imperium Games want to make all their adventures follow a single
timeline? Can they? I don\'t know, but I would appreciate hearing other
player\'s thoughts on the matter.

Use a "long card" format, like SJG\'s current "Dino Hunt."  (I think some
art cards have used it too).  On one side, a class name and logo with
line-art isometric views (computer-readout style?) of the ship: fore,
side, and top.  On the rear, give a third to a half of the card over to a
high-quality painting or render of the ship "in action," and the rest to
the gaming stats.  (Hmm, do we need to leave room for flavor text?  It
would be nice.  But agate type is so hard to read... :-)

If you\'re going for simple card game mechanics, definitely go for the
larger card size.  You could print colored buttons in the corners of the
card (one or both sides) with the relevant numbers for play prominently
displayed there.  And if you need more than four numbers, it\'s not such a
simple card game.

   The Remington 700 ML
   By: Rick Kindig, Log Cabin Sports Shop 
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   [LINK] 
   The Remington Arms Co. of Ilion, NY, an American icon for over 150
   years, is back in the muzzleloading business. The recent release of
   their new model 700ML, previously mentioned in our article "Buying a
   Muzzleloading Rifle", has caused a flurry of activity among black
   powder hunters across the country. Based on Remington\'s famous 700
   bolt action cartridge rifle, the 700ML enters into a market al-ready
   flush with in-line models from such well-known companies as Thompson
   Center, Knight, White, C.V.A., and others. Based on the results of a
   morning on the range with the 700ML, I predict it will compete
   successfully.
   
   At first glance it is hard to distinguish the muzzleloading 700 from
   its cartridge firing parent, except for the black aluminum ramrod
   under the barrel and rod carrier band 4" in back of the muzzle. The
   round, 24" long stainless steel barrel is mounted on the well-known
   bolt action receiver, which includes a thumb safety and is drilled and
   tapped for scope mounts. Other features include adjustable rear sight
   and a white bead front sight mounted on a ramp. The black synthetic
   stock has a pistol grip, monte carlo cheek piece, sling swivel studs,
   recoil pad and molded checkering at the wrist and forend.
   
   The overall length of the 700ML is 42-1/2", trigger pull is 13-1/2",
   and it weighs 7 lb. 10 oz. Included with the rifle is a hand full of
   accessories including a nipple wrench, breech plug wrench,ram rod
   extension and handle, Allen wrench and foul weather nipple shroud. A
   detailed instruc-tion book also comes with each gun, as does a
   firearms safety video. While this safety video is not particularly
   geared to muzzleloading, any shooter, no matter how ex-perienced,
   could benefit from viewing it once in a while as a refresher.
   
   I found the 700ML to be dependable, easy to operate and clean,
   accurate, and fun to shoot. I opened the bolt to check that there was
   no cap or cap residue on the nipple, and dropped the rod down the
   barrel to be certain there was no load in the barrel. Then I fired two
   caps to be certain the nipple was clear (holding the muzzle near a
   blade of grass will give visible proof of a clear channel when the
   grass moves). I measured 80 grains of G.O.I. 2F black powder, an
   arbitrary load that I believe to be on the lower end of reasonable
   hunting loads. I picked a Hornady 240 gr. XTP bullet and sabot for my
   first group. The sabot loaded with firm but manageable pressure of the
   aluminum rod. My second group was shot using the same 80 grain charge
   and a 385 grain Great Plains bullet. Again, this loaded with relative
   ease. The rod mounted with the gun is quite adequate for field use. It
   will accept any 10-32 threaded attachment. For loading on the target
   range or cleaning, there is an extension and handle that makes the
   whole process easier.
   
   At the firing line, I placed a CCI #11 cap on the nipple, pushed the
   safety to the fire position, and touched off the first shot. Cap
   placement was not a problem when shooting with open sights. However, a
   scope on top may limit access to the nipple such that an in-line
   capper would be necessary to conveniently place the cap.
   
   Recoil with the saboted load was no problem. However, after numerous
   shots with the heavier Great Plains bullet, I started to notice the
   recoil from the comb on my cheek. The stock is rather straight,
   however most shooters will probably want to use a scope, and the extra
   height of the scope will ease this situation.
   
   The adjustable trigger comes preset from the factory (not user
   adjustable), and provides a very crisp hunting level let-off. The
   trigger guard is standard 700 size and pro-vides less access than a
   T/C Renegade Hunter guard. The trigger has a wide face and would be
   accessible with most hunting gloves on.
   
   Rem 700 ML Target Firing from a bench at 50 yards and using open
   sights, I was able to keep five (5) sabot rounds in a 1-1/4" circle,
   with four of the five shots touching. With the Great Plains bul-lets,
   I maintained a 3" circle, but I think these bullets could turn in a
   better performance by adjusting powder charges. Based on this limited
   test I think the 700 will be an outstanding shooter within any
   reasonable black powder hunting range.
   
   Back in the shop, faced with the prospect of cleaning the rifle, I was
   pleasantly surprised with the ease of dis-assembly. An Allen wrench
   removes the bolt retaining screw and the bolt can then be withdrawn
   from the receiver. The long nipple wrench slides into the receiver and
   easily removes the 1/4 x 28 nipple. Reverse the wrench and the breech
   plug can be removed just as quickly. I was pleased to see that the
   plug was a simple affair that resulted in a very short flash channel.
   This allows fast, dependable ignition with little room for
   fire-stopping fouling to build up.
   
   With the bolt and plug removed, a solvent-soaked cleaning patch can be
   run through the bore from the breech. This task is facilitated by a
   factory provided rod carrier tube that slips into the receiver and
   helps get the wet patch into the bore without getting solvent into the
   trigger unit.
   
   The bolt assembly comes apart for cleaning in one step. A quick wipe
   down and a very light oil is all it takes here. I have seen cases with
   other in-lines where excessive lubri-cation of the bolt will prevent
   firing in cold weather because the frozen lube stops the firing pin
   movement. I don\'t know if that could happen with the 700ML (the spring
   is quite stout) but if you keep the lube light there should be no
   problem.
   
   After cleaning, re-assembly is quick and easy. One acces-sory I didn\'t
   make use of was the nipple shroud that comes with this gun. This
   simple tube can be pressed in place on the face of the bolt when out
   of the gun. In use it pro-vides additional protection to the nipple
   during wet weather.
   
   The Remington 700ML comes in .50 or .54 caliber, and in standard
   length or carbine style. And the $400.00 price tag (subject to change)
   makes the 700ML quite competitive with other quality in-lines. Anyone
   looking for an effective muzzleloading deer rifle should consider this
   piece. Ac-curate, dependable, easy to maintain, resistant to wear and
   weather damage and just plain fun to shoot, the Remington 700ML will
   become a major player in the muzzleloading hunting rifle field.

The concept of the Discarding Sabot was used prior to 1700, with smoothbore
artillery firing subcaliber balls by placing them upon a solid wooden
board. Not particularly effective, but the concept is extant, and doable
with pre-modern tech. Just because *W*E* didn\'t do it doesn\'t mean it
cannot be done.

Vacc Suits, like many other specialty sub-fields are not (we can presume)
as narrowly defined as DS rounds... but as you said are multiple tech
threads.

Plausible way of TL 14 vacc suits in TL12-13 societies, IMHO

Biggest points of issue:
	1) Material
	2) Atm Recyc
	3) Pressure cylynders

1) Material- is there really that much change from TL12-14 in wearable
materials? Most such developments are semi-accidental (AFAIK), and each
leads to other spin-off technological materials; a corporate blunder could
have resulted in a matrerial whose effects are known, but whose mechanism
is not wholely known (much like the Silica-Titanium Heat shielding being
made on Jaquard Looms currently).

2) Atm recycling: aside from pressure handling and power requirements, is
there THAT much difference? We don\'t have much need for it, therefore
little development. Most TL 12-14 cultures will have had star travel for
QUITE some time, so better techniques based upon extant TL 12 theories may
have been developed, but not distributed.

3) Pressure Cylinders: AFAIK, we can get o2 into the pressures for TL 14
bottles now... we just don\'t want to hit them... again, it is materials,
which see above.

If some corporation happens to gain knowledge of those three
"specialty-experimental" items, which, again, are withing the cannonical +2
limit upon experimental tech, they could feasably (and expensively)
manufacture almost tl14 vacc suits; they would be just a hare less durable,
more expensive to own and operate, and ever so much more to purchase.

Also, we can CURRENTLY manufacture a vaccum suit that isn\'t bulky... but it
leaks some, and is hard to move in, and provides none of the radiation and
thermal protections the NASA ones do. It\'s a matter of trade offs.

AGAIN: Just because it hasn\'t happened that way doesn\'t mean it couldn\'t
have been!

The majority of the vocal-minority like the current design systems... but
they DO NOT, as they claimed during the clamor some 6 months ago, represent
the whole of the populace, according to their own defence against the
surveys that said "No! Don\'t do that, do this Other Thing". Mind you, there
were 7 or 8 options; in the surveys, the current systems together didn\'t
win a majority, and I\'ve heard as much criticism as praise for them. Please
don\'t break your arms patting yourselves on the back as of yet.

This is not to start a war, but I HATE the system from basic T4, I strongly
DISLIKE Starships\' system (no offense dave and guy, it\'s better than pure
FF&S). I also THOROUGHLY DETESTED FF&S. I liked MT; but felt it needed a
little reworking to pull it out of its HG roots... and that it needed to
have all the additions pulled together and integrated into one set of
tables. [nb: I have these in WordPerfect, for anyone who needs them for
PERSONAL USE ONLY].

MT was, unlike the other systems mentioned in this missive, in a sequence
that was useable, easy to follow (I\'ve explained the basics to 8th graders
and watched them build ships that were excellent, while I can barely follow
FF&S), detailed enough to have role-playing flavor (Lacking in T4\'s
systems), flexible enough to handle all sizes of craft with one main
sequence, and able to be put (all combined aspects except watercraft) into
a mere 30 pages at reasonable (9pt helvetica) type.

And for those who though MT was too detailed, it was merely HG and Striker
combined, less the weapon design sequences. HG designs use the exact same
weapon and screen values as MT designs. MT\'s space combat was, I freely
admit, almost as broken as T4\'s... TNE\'s was too complex... HG became MT,
thus is equally broken, and Bk2/Mayday was no good for large ships.

a half dozen over the years) but it seems to me that the QSDS (and possibly the
SSDS, which I haven\'t studied too closely) is more complicated and less 
logically intuitive than "High Guard" and is simultaneously less flexible,
which is a sure-fire sign to me that the system isn\'t as Ideal as some people
would have us think.  I think that the problem arises from the fact that the
designers\' idea of "simplifying" FF&S was really just to strip away a lot of
the flexibility and decision-making, but not really doing anything to make it
easier to follow or really "simpler" (which is somewhat intangible but would
include, I think, such things as tables made up mostly of whole-number amounts,
logical explanations for why the numbers are what they are, and such).  As it
is, the QSDS is really only suited to "gearheads who are in a hurry" and
doesn\'t do that much for "us regular folks".  I\'d like to see a ship design
system for Traveller that\'s no more complicated than "High Guard," but which
maintains enough flexibility that I can use it for all of my (amittedly, pretty
small) ship-design needs without having to resort to a more complex version,

Am I missing something or just being completely obtuse?

The \'risk\' of a misjump is only 1 in 36 for those without an engineer or
using unrefined fuel.  The \'interstellar economy\' (i.e. the vast majority
of ships?) is going to have an enginner and/or refined fuel which as I
understood it reduced the chance of a misjump to 0  (As you can\'t throw
less than 2 on 2d6).

I appreciate that situations are going to arise where the engineer\'s
missing, unrefined fuel\'s being used, you\'re several weeks past your annual
maintenance and so on...  but surely no captain\'s going to let that
situation go on and on and on and let the odds stack up like that.

Bad comparison. Tiger was built and designed under the 1911
estimates, Queen Elizabeth under the 1913 estimates. Tiger\'s
Battleship partner was Iron Duke (25,000 tons, 622 ft, 10 x 13.5
inch guns as against Tigers 8). Queen Elizabeth\'s Battlecruiser
partner was Hood (42,670 tons, 860 ft, with the same armour
and guns)

          I must admit this is what I\'d thought.  In Southampton, my local

          (nice image, huh?), had T4 and Starships (and sold out) but had not

          in

          They had several copies of all *four* of the IG books (including AA,
          and
          CSC).  What\'s more the Starships book was cheaper than it had been in
          Virgin.

          While I appreciate there won\'t be many who can just pop over to

with me. As many have pointed out this does not
really belong here so I\'ll try to keep this brief and
relate it to traveller.

The basic definition (as I see it) is not one of design
parameters but one of intended role. The first
battlecruisers (Invincible, Indomitable and Von der
Tann classes) were simply extensions of the
traditional armoured cruiser role (and initially
designated as such). That is scouting and
commerce warfare. However they rapidly evovled
into another role, that of a fast wing of the battle
fleet, using their speed to gain an advantagous
position in battle, hence the change in designation
in 1912. This change lead to a change in design
philosophy. They became much larger than
battleships, their protection improved markedly
and their firepower decreased in comparison (vis
Tiger  class  and her battleship equivilant the Iron
Duke class [both from the 1911 estimates]: 15%
bigger, 80% of the protection, 80% firepower) and
reached it apothetis with HMS Hood (compare to
Queen Elizabeth class BB, same protection, same
firepower, 40% bigger). The same is true for almost
all the many battlecruisers which were killed by the
Washington Treaty (the USN\'s Lexington class stand
out as the exception).

Essentially the battlecruiser evolved into the
fast battleship, and had done so by 1914. Later
clear examples of battlecruisers are Scharnhorst
and Dunkerque classes (Battleship protection,
cruiser speed, firepower somewhere in between).
This was the role of the Iowas when they were
designed in 1936-7 (long before the supremacy
of carriers, or the need for battleships to keep
station with them was realised) and they stand
out as exceptions to the normal US design
practice (compare with their successors the
Montanas).

Under CT and MT these ships can not be built (the
6g limit prevents them), but they can be built under
FFS (and by extension QSDS and SSDS). However,
as has been pointed out, the original large armoured
cruisers can be built (big jump with sacrifices
elsewere) for commerce warfare. Here however the
comparison would be with the \'monster\' frigates
built by the British and US in the early years of the
19th C (USS Consitution or HMS Leander are good
examples).

I think it is an error to compare Traveller naval
warfare with 20th C naval warfare. As Eris
has pointed out, a much closer parallel (well
as close as one can get in an abstract game
of the far future) is to the classic age of sail
(and much more fun too, IMHO).

That\'d be the "official" answer. That doesn\'t mean that it is
*correct*. Mine was based on *measuring*. The official sizes of the
Falcon are rather silly in places. Why should the Death Star be any
different?

I think you have a few details wrong, unless there have been
developments I haven\'t heard about.

A main sequence star is burning hydrogen in the core. If it is
sufficiently low mass, when the core has run out of hydrogen, the
resulting contraction of the star *won\'t* result in helium burning in
the core, though it could result in some hydrogen burning farther out. 

Most stars have enough mass for helium burning to start after the core
runs out of hydrogen. This requires *much* higher pressures and
temperatures than hydrogen burning. So the non-intuitive result is that
the outer layers of the star expand greatly. This makes it a "red
giant". 

The helium burning core will be surrounded by a shell that is burning
hydrogen. 

For some stars, this is as far as it goes, when the helium runs out in
the core it collapses to a white dwarf. This will tend to blow off the
outer layers, but I\'m not certain that it results in a Nova. More
likely a small supernova. But I\'m not even certain about that. I
thought they contracted rather tamely.

Heavier stars will be able to reach core pressures that allow fusing
heavier elements, but much the same applies. At some point, they hit a
limit where they can\'t fuse what\'s left in the core. And they\'ll have
shells surrounding the core "burning" successively lighter elements as
you approach the surface.

The big limit comes when the core is producing iron (Fe56) as the
output of the fusiion reaction. Fusing iron into heavier elements
*uses* energy, it doesn\'t release it.

So when the fuel at the core runs out *this* time, there\'s nothing to
stop the collapse. The core winds up collapsing to a neutron stars and
then as it tries to expand again, the outer layers of the star fall in
on it and detonate. This *does* make a supernova. And it pretty much
wipes out any planets.

There is evidence that new planets can form from the nebula created by
the supernova. But they will be *very* odd...

At 300 km/s the tau factor is .9999995. That means that clocks will be

Well, I\'ve recommended the Mageworlds series by Doyle and MacDonald
before. While it isn\'t Traveller compatible in some ways, it *feels*
like Traveller.

And while not Traveller at *all*, I\'ve just finished a book that would
make a great source for an adventure. "Jed the Dead" by Alan Dean
Foster. I\'d *love* to see the fun if some M0 players exploring a new

One *big* difference in Traveller. Fighter pilots will be taking the g
forces "lying down". Due to the lack of aerodynamic forces for turning,
you have to use thrusters to change orientation, and the main drive to
change *vector*. 

Since the big forces *always* come from the main engine, you are taking
Gs in the "chest to back" direction rather than the "head to toe"
direction. 

This should *greatly* increase the number of Gs you can pull. 40 g
"bursts" in this direction are *known* to be survivable, and 10 g for a
minute of so shouldn\'t be difficult.

We\'d need NASA centrifuge testing data to find more accurate limits.
But 3g for extended period should be *easy*. Which gives us 9g if
g-comp is limited to 6g.

That would be a consideration, but given that you have to be able to
handle particle streams at several different stages of acceleration (on
a multipass ring) you\'ll have emough "redundant" magnet capacity to
handle small breaks. 

Also, you can sacrifice some diameter for armor. In other words, build
the ring deeper inside the ship. That\'ll make it harder to hit.

Heck, for a design that never lands, a toroidal (donut shape) ship
might be a good idea. The ring would be in "middle" of the torus, and
quite well protected. And the torus gives a lot more surface area for
mounting turrets and docking bays and the like. 

Among other benefits, any missile that comes from the "face on"
direction is going to need special programming, or its attempt to hit
the center of the target will cause a complete miss! :-)

And think of the number of point defense weapons that can bear on a
target coming in from that direction....

The _Exordium_ novels by Dave Trowbridge and Sherwood Smith.  [My apologies to 
those who ghave seen this post before.]  Here are the backcover blurbs from 
the series, which are presented on Dave Trowbridge\'s web page (can\'t get to 
the URL just now, but I found it by searching for "exordium" on Alta Vista):

The Phoenix in Flight (ISBN 0-812-52024-6) 

Humans have colonized a thousand worlds, and empires have risen and fallen. 
Now the Phoenix House rules the Thousand Suns from their planet Arthelion. And 
now the Panarch Gelasaar has won the mortal enmity of Eusabian, Lord of 
Vengeance, Avatar of Dol, the ruler of Dol\'jhar. 

In one swift instant that has taken more than twenty years to plan, Eusabian 
will strike, slaying Gelasaar\'s sons and taking the Panarch himself captive. 
And then Eusabian will sit on the Emerald Throne, and Dol\'har will rule the 
Panarchy of the Thousand Suns. 

But Brandon nyr-Arkad, the Panarch\'s scapegrace son, has chosen this moment to 
defy protocol and evade a ceremonial duty. And so he escapes the death 
prepared for him, and lives. Now the hope of the Thousand Suns rests in the 
sensual, surprisingly capable hands of an aristocratic fugitive with an agenda 
all his own. 

Ruler of Naught  (ISBN 0-812-52025-4) 

Jerrode Eusabian, Avatar of Dol, sits uneasy on the Emerald Throne of the 
Thousand Suns, while Brandon vlith-Arkad, rightful heir to the throne, is 
harried across space. 

Brandon was meant to die, along with his two older brothers. But he escaped by 
merest chance--now he is the only hope for the restoration of the Phoenix 
House and the salvation of the people they once ruled. Brandon and his allies, 
the crew of the Rifter ship Telvarna , must flee from peril to peril in search 
of the one haven no Rifter would ever willingly seek: Ares Station, heart of 
the Panarchy\'s military power. 

And across the unthinkable reaches of space, the scattered Fleet of the 
Thousand Suns is slowly learning that their Panarch has been taken, and their 
home worlds sacked. 

A Prison Unsought (ISBN 0-812-52026-2) 

Brandon vlith-Arkad is safe on Ares, the Panarchic Navy\'s HQ. The sole heir to 
the Emerald Throne must now fight a battle of symbols and deadly political 
intent, if he is to win the power to order the Navy into battle, to rescue his 
father, and win back the Panarchy now usurped by Eusabian of Dol\'jhar. 

With him in this prison of velvet ropes and poisoned gifts is the crew of the 
Telvarna , the Riter pirates whose loyalty Brandon has won in battle. 

Meanwhile, Brandon\'s father, the Panarch of the Thousand Suns, is being 
transported to the prison planet Gehenna. On board the ship he is fighting his 
own subtle war with his former fosterling, Eusabian\'s son, Anaris. If Gelasaar 
can discover any hint that Anaris can rule as an Arkad would, the captive 
Panarch will aid Anaris to overthrow Eusabian himself. 


The Rifter\'s Covenant  (ISBN 0-812-52027-0) 

From Pirate to Emperor... 

Young Brandon Arkad has been brought by war and disaster to a duty he never 
expected: Panarch of the Thousand Suns, Emperor of the human worlds beyond the 
Rift. But his Empire is in shambles, as the implacable Jerrode Eusabian and 
his Rifter allies continue to pillage whole planets, and the Emerald Throne is 
out of reach on occupied Arthelion. 

The surviving nobility of the Panarchy have gathered aboard Ares , the 
headquarters of the Panarchic Fleet. Now Brandon must grasp the power given 
him in the moment of his father\'s death, and wield it to wrest his empire from 
the hands of the usurper. But he must win the faith of his people before he 
can hope to win a war, and that will not be easy. 

For there is a traitor at the heart of the Panarchy, thwarting Brandon\'s every 
move with poisonous rumor and murderous plots--a traitor at the center of 
Brandon\'s councils, close enough to be invisible--a traitor who will stop at 
nothing to destroy the Arkad dynasty. 


The Thrones of Kronos  (ISBN 0-812-52027-0) 

The final battle for the Thousand Suns is at hand. Brandon hai-Arkad is 
Panarch, yet still uncrowned, for his throne remains in the hands of his 
enemy, Jerrode Eusabian of Dol\'jhar. The fleet has been gathered, the order of 
battle drawn. Brandon will reclaim his father\'s empire, or die.

Trowbridge says:
"I like to think of it as a sort of weird hybrid of the Lensman series and 
Dangerous Liaisons."

This series is great (I rank it with _A Talanet for War_ and _Dragon Never 
Sleeps_), and has some wonderful touches.  Examples:
1) The Panarchy is vast, with no FTL communications.  As a way of getting 
around this, some trusted individuals (we don\'t know how many) are given ONE 
veto over actions by local officials.  Nobody knows who these officials are, 
though, until they exercise their power.  All the computer systems in the 
Panarchy (which are programmed by computer virus), however, have a list of 
eligible people, and when one of them (they are called the "<something> 
Covert" and "<something> Overt", depending on whether they have used the power 
or not) says that he is invoking his veto, he immediately takes total control 
over all the computer systems within range.

2) Battle computers are controlled and display informaion by means of a system 
of glyphs which, like Chinese, can display huge amounts of data with only a 
few characters.  This is a problem for the good guys, as the bad guys have 
acquired FTL communications (this is revealed in the first 100 pages of the 
3000 page series, so I don\'t feel bad about revealing it <grin>), and the 
system of glyphs used in Panarchic tactical systems has no way to deal with 
this.

3) Everyone carries a combination personal digital assistant/terminal/
communication system known as a "boswell".

4) Ships carry two types of weapons, disruptors and "skipmissiles", a photon-
torpedoe like energy/plasma burst which skips in and out of hyperspace.  
Skipmissiles are especially useful in assaults on planetary shields.  The 
planetary shields transfer the energy they deflect directly to the crust of 
the planet.  If a siege is long and intense enough, eventually the planet must 
surrender or it will be torn apart by earthquakes.

After about 100 pages I cam to the conclusions that this series was everything 
that Classic and Mega-Traveller should have been.

SECOND MESSAGE(27 Jan 97)

Looks like the folks on the TML are a bit more educated that the LM
folks!

Yes.  Of course I\'ll contribute!

The reply to your message was largely correct, if not completely.  The
NIMITZ class carriers are rougly one half the displacement of the
Traveller
PLANET class cruisers, but my understanding is that the register ton is
NOT
an exact measure.  I have no documents to support this information.  As
you
know, I have conducted extensive studies of ship structure and
displacement
progression.  Ship sizes are largely a function of maximum material
strength,
but since the mid 1800s there has existed another determinant, the width
of
the locks of the Suez and Panama canals.  PANAMAX vessels are vessels
with a maximum beam such that they can safely pass through the locks of
the
Panama Canal.  This is an artificial restriction, but a real one
nonetheless.

The US is currently considering constructing carriers much larger than
the
NIMITZ class although. I don\'t think this will happen for reasons I
do not care to
elaborate on.  The REAGAN (CVN 76) will displace 106,000 tons. 
Supertankers 
displace upwards of 250,000 tons.  Also, the volume to displacement
ton  ratio is inexact.
My calculations are based on computer analysis of the LPD 17 hullform
and the French
Foudre hullform, which differed in their exact ratio.  The ratio for
LPD 17 was about 4.7.


Why bigger starships?  Becasue the ship is actually built around the
spinal mount,
not the reverse.  The ship class will be engineered bottom up around
the spinal
mount as it\'s central system.  If you can shoot farther than your
opponent and see far
enough to shoot him, the battle is one before the first shot
(theoretically).  The argument
about maximum efficiency is also wrong.  Efficiency wins battles, as
does equipment excellence.
Witness the number of US combatants sunk since WWII and "other"
combatants.  It
is 0 to some number in the teens I belive.  Big ships kill little
ships.  Eat \'em for breakfast.
Stealth throws a monkey wrench in this, however.  The Arleigh Burke\'s
are the most awesome warship
ever conceived or built.  There is no weapons system in the world,
except for a submarine, that can defeat them.  A new Arleigh Burke
can defeat any known surface or air threat, even an entire air force
(up to the number of missiles the ship carries).  It\'s not even a
match.  That\'s how awesome a ship can be when you trade quantity for
quality.   Quite a payoff.

Gotta go.  I\'ll write more later.

That\'s too bad to hear. I go to a Comics/Games shop.  They didn\'t have
AA in but did have CSC.  I picked up CSC and asked about AA.  Manager
asked if she wanted her to order it for me.  Of course I\'ve been doing

The only trouble with death stars is that million to one shot by a young 
rebel pilot down the exhaust tube:-). No really all you are really making 
with these big ships is a sign saying Shoot ME. If they can\'t take you 
out using capital ships they\'ll find another way like the 
infamous Zohdani(sp?) teleporting commandos with suitcase nukes(tm).
Or destroying its line of supply, can you imagine the maintainace a ship 
that big will need, not to mention feeding the crew.

considerable argument over whether big-gun battleships, cruisers, 
torpedo boats, submarines, or rams would be the ships of the future. 

It is easy to be blinded by the World Wars into thinking those are the
only models. I think the Anglo-Dutch wars of the Seventeenth Century - 
perhaps the only purely naval wars in history - might also provide
an interesting model.

Phantasm, of course!  Optimal ship design will change, perhaps radically,
depending on the "rules" in place.  I was just pointing out features of
High Guard that EURISKO discovered.  They may or may not be true with the
TNE ruleset, and we don\'t know about T4.  But it would probably be worth
looking into.

The core collapses into a Neutron star if there\'s sufficient mass, if not

Those planets might be odd but for beings that live on them they\'ll look

My point was that these TL14 Vac Suits are common enough, 1500 years after
the collapse of the Rule of Man, to be sold on the open market on Sylea.
This implies that they have been recovered in significant quantities. I
don\'t know what the odds are of any one suit surviving for 1500 years, but
they can\'t be good. If they had been experimental suits there might be one
or two carefully preserved specimens in Sylean museums, but surely not on
the open market.

Not according to the text on page 116. Drive failure is affected by using
unrefined fuel and/or lack of proper maintenance, and a drive failure may
affect the jump drive, but that means the jump drive won\'t function at all
(a result far more desirable than a misjump). Misjumps seem to be a separate
hazard and occurs on a roll of 2-. DMs: +1 if using unrefined fuel, +5 if
jumping from within 100 diameters. Furthermore, unlike in Megatraveller, 
where most misjumps just resulted in a bit of nausea and time distortion,
any T4 misjump results in a 1-36 parsecs jump in a random direction (As an
added feature misjumps now keep you in jump space for 1-6 weeks). There\'s
no mention of any negative DMs for adequate maintenance. (Unless it is
mentioned elsewhere in the rules. I won\'t claim to have read the book from
cover to cover).

Hmm. Trav has always had a special knack for making assertions about its
own universe (like tidbits about the Droyne, Zhodani, and Aslan) which
slowly but surely get contradicted by later evidence. IMHO, this is THE
aspect of Trav which makes it so special. Nothing is certain; question
everything; keep an open mind.

As I recall, very litte was said about about past TL\'s in CT. MT, with
its love for endless detail, said more than made sense about TL\'s and
just about every other aspect of Trav. When MT came out, its new
detail-ridden universe was bound to contradict in at least some respects
every detailed campaign already being run by CT refs, as well as CT
canon. Examples include:

1) Jump fuel use in MT contradicted CT rules on the subject.

2) Needless detail about lanthanum grids made necessary excruciating
rationaizations of previous ship designs.

3) New details about the Moot make this political body\'s existence
ridiculously improbable.

And other irks and quirks which just didn\'t make sense. So if MM wants
to abandon some MT canon which abandoned previous CT canon, I cannot
fault him for that.

	This limit isn\'t true any more.  In the November \'96 issue of 
Automotive Engineering (pg. 36), ultracapacitors are described in 
some detail.  These devices had originally been designed by Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory for use in SDI weapons.  Carbon
aerogels, a low density, high-pore-volume material, allows the storage
of higher charge per volume.  These devices have capacities up to 
40 farads/cm^3.  The power densities have been shown to be more 
than 7kW/kg, and using aqueous electrolytes have been reported at
4W hours per kg.  These devices also hold their charge for weeks 
at a time.
	One company, Maxwell Laboratories, Inc., have already 
fabricated and tested 24Volt cells with specific energies of 4.5W hours per
kg and holding 1kW/kg of power.  These devices are about the size of
a grape.  They have also built a 2300farad 3V device capable of 
delivering more than 100Amps.  I still don\'t think this is small enough
to power lasers very well though.  I\'ll do the math tonight.

The problem with MT design system was that it was not the designsystem
itself but rather that all this detail put into design was meaningless in
the combat system.
BTW Has anybody on the list actually used the space combat system as put
forth in MT? I couldn\'t figure it out. The rules as written seemed so silly
I thought there were large chunks of rules misprinted or whatnot but the
errata didn\'t touch spacecombat much.

Agreed!

Well, the "Vision" I always had for Traveller space combat (from CT
primarily) was more of the Napoleanic model.  

Think about the following assumptions;

Fighters manuver only incrementally better than larger vessels (as opposed
to an order of magnitude better like present day fighters).

Large ship combat generally favors the larger vessel over the smaller.
i.e.  A 10,000 ton vessel will almost always defeat a 5000 ton vessel.
Although the smaller vessel has a not insignificant chance of defeating
the larger.

With the exception of spinal mounts (of which only one exists on each
ship[in CT]),  armament is in large banks of identical weapons fired in
unison.  

Communication is at the speed of the ship carrying the message.

Nobility is a major component of Imperial Society.

All of these seem to me to contribute to the "Hornblower" model of space
combat in terms of flavor.  The high guard system also contributes to
this, especially the critical hit tables, rare as they are (in equal
battles).  In CT as in the Napoleanic Era, to fight a vastly superior
opponent was simply to waste your men\'s lives (usually).  In WWI and WWII,
on the other hand, a destroyer was a valid (though unlikely) threat to a
BB.  and a submarine was even worse, in spite of on occassion being a
small fraction of the size of their victim.

T4, I think, moves a bit away from that vision (as did FF&S logically).
This accomadates the gearheads since the CT system doesn\'t really allow
good designs to beat bad designs as readily.  But I will still use
Hornblower and Aubrey as the models of Traveller Naval life, and try to
interpret combat systems as "Old Ironsides in Space".

Well, RPGA people weren\'t the only ones to get the ax before
Xmas.............

AND the rumor I got was that T$R, quite recently, had to give Gary Gygax
a big chunk of $ due to royalties they owed him (or LW owed him) for
their premire game system.  Which is kinda nice IF Gary was the one of
the factors that put them in their financial straits.
AND
They\'ve sold off their buildings and are now renting office
space..................

BUT 
I doubt GENCON would be cancelled, it\'s too big a moneymaker for T$R, and
that IS their main concern ($)..........IMO.

This is a very good question. I can only come up with one: the
food-processor guys (Shugilli) would, in something of the same tradition
of us terrans using occupational names like, uhm, "Miller." I wonder if
this is a play on MWM\'s name . . . .

In one or another of the MT books is a chart to generate Vilani words;
this might allow one to generate a lot of common Vilani words that can
translate to name-elements.

What we really need is a Vilani-English dictionary in the tradition of
MAR Baker\'s  Empire of the Petal Throne. Mr. Baker once published a
Tsolyani-English dictionary for his game world . . . .

Just a thought of my own . . . .

20km? 30km? You\'re /both/ way off... (and this post proves I\'m way off,
too, but that\'s a different story).

According to the Death Star Companion book for the SW RPG v2, it has a
diameter of 250 kilometers.

That makes its volume about 8,181,230 cubic /kilometers/.  I make it
8.181230869 E15 cubic meters for a Traveller displacement of 5.84376335 E14
dTons.

Well, /someone/ had to do it.

JTAS 17 gave the common first names for Vilani -- I\'ll look it up in my

I found out what was meant by the "new ship design system" mentioned in 
the IG Web Newsletter.  At this point, it is planned that QSDS will serve 
as the basis, but it will be modified based on the complaints they have 
on file (i.e., what members of this list have said about it).  Absolutely 
nothing is certain at this point as to what may or may not change.  My 
guess is that Marc Miller and Guy "Wildstar" Garnett will work closely to 
make the version of QSDS that appears in the Deluxe Edition of T4 the 
best it can possibly be.

I\'ll put in my two cents here - 

The Honor Harrington series by David Weber (who worked on Starfire, btw). 
Great for space combat ideas.  The Mote in God\'s Eye.  Pournelle\'s John
Christian Falkenberg series, for Mercenary campaign inspiration.  Starship
Troopers.  The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.  Lois McMaster Bujold\'s Vorkosigan
series.  L. E. Modesitt Jr\'s Ecolitan & Forever Hero trilogies.  Daniel
Keyes Moran\'s The Long Run (excellent treatment of advanced computer
networks).  Poul Anderson\'s Flandry series.

I wanted the sensor mounted on a drone so that I can lob it in the general
direction I suspect the enemy fleet is in, and let it coast through and
burst transmit the data back over a laser.

Additonal benefits of drone mounting are that you don\'t need to worry about
your evasive manuevers snapping your array cable, or (as has been suggested
already) have a 6 pack of missiles ready to nail enemies who light up their
active sensors.

I went to my first computer conference at the New York Hilton about 20
years ago.  When somebody there predicted the market for microprocessors
would eventually be in the millions, someone else said, "Where are they
all going to go? It\'s not like you need a computer in every doorknob!"

Years later, I went back to the same hotel.  I noticed the room keys had
been replaced by electronic cards you slide into slots in the doors.

There was a computer in every doorknob.

a vessel would only need to fire its energy weapons a few times, and
wouldn\'t need to keep its defensive screens energized for very long,
either.  Wouldn\'t some kind of extremely high output rechargable "battery" 
(I\'m using the term loosely) be a better source of power than a large
reactor?  Such vessels *would* have a small conventional power plant, one
just adequate to power its maneuver drives, and allow it to keep up with
the rest of its squadron.  Power for energy weapons and screens, however,
would come from a substantial "battery pack," enabling a very small ship
to, if only very briefly, produce an unexpected amount of energy.  Perhaps

That is why I suggested a time and velocity stamp. If we know what the time
stamp of the sending ship is, and the velocity it is travelling at when
sending the data packet, adjusting for the tau factor biasing the incomming
data should be relatively simple; analogous to compensating for wind in the
days of sail.

Yes. The design philosophy will change as the tech level of the weapons
systems changes. What is a dreadnaught at tl 10 may barely qualify as a
cruiser by tl 12 and slip to a destroyer class by tl 14. As I mentioned in
an earlier post, the classification of armor will change as the power of
whatever standard weapon a navy uses changes with tech level. 

Bigger ships can sustain more damage than little ships; however if the
little ship that was expected to be built around at tl 10 3600mj npaws,
turns out to have built around a tl 12 3600mj npaw, the bigger ship is going
to be hurt badly.

IIRC, Vilani was a tonal language, with each element having six different
tonal varieties.  Thus you get 

E(2)ne(5)ri(1)= A common man\'s name vs.
E(5)ne(6)ri(1)= Bread pudding

Any attempt at Vilani trnaslation would have to account for this, plus the
fact that many terran tonal languages also incorporate verb form into the
pitch.

Well, that\'s 3 of us! <g>  

So, let\'s talk...during the "age of sail":

Ships could stay at sea for *long* periods, they were forced into port
mainly for food and water.

Damaged ships could usually be repaired by their crew, even in primitive
conditions.  Ships carried carpenters, iron mongers, sail makers, and the
tools they needed to keep a ship in trim.  Heavily damaged ships could
sail...or be towed to most any port where it could be repaired.

Weapons for almost *all* ships, from lowly merchantman to mighty SOL, had
about the same range and did about the same amount of damage.  The SOL just
had *lots* more of them.  Hitting at range was *heavily* dependent on
gunnery skill.

Warships could take lots of punishment.  You could pound holes in the
wooden hull, wreak the masts and sails, sweep the decks killing crew,
silence the cannon, and the ship would still be afloat.  

Most losing ships ended up being captured along with most of their crews,
not being destroyed.  The captured ships ended up refitted, renamed, and in
the navy of the other side.

Ships could be sighted at much longer ranges than you could shoot at them,
and long stern chases were common.  Speaking of speed, all ships were
within a few knots of each other, so ships and fleets could often simply
attempt to refuse battle by sailing off and losing themselves in the night,
the fog, the distance.

The ship\'s maneuverability was important in single combat, and was
*heavily* dependent on the skill of the crew and sailing master. Before and
during combat ships maneuvered to achieve an advantage, mainly to be able
to cross the other ship\'s bow or stern (crossing the T), or to gain the
"weather gauge" (get the wind so they could sail away from the opponent).

Individual ship maneuverability was less important in fleet actions. They
combat consisted of long formal lines of ships sailing in line, so as to
maximize broadside firepower and minimize the chance of the other side
being able to defeat you piecemeal.  Most battles didn\'t destroy entire
fleets, when one side saw it was going to get whipped it would break off,
and usually could sail away.

Most combat seemed to take place near ports, not on the open ocean. Colony
ports on strategic islands were often captured and lost a dozen times
during a war.

What else?

How does all this compare to the environment and the kind of
technology we have to deal with in the Traveller universe.

most certainly could be adapted to T4 as well.  Your comments should
come back to me directly, or can be posted on the mailing list.

Fishing (Explore--INT): Ability to catch aquatic lifeforms, using hook
and line, traps, nets, or other similar devices.  Catching fish (or
alien equivalent) without adequate equipment is normally a Difficult
task.  Catching fish with adequate equipment is normally an Average
task.  Fabricating proper fishing equipment is an Average task, provided
proper supplies are available.  The referee should adjust the difficulty
of these tasks according to the size and orneriness of the aquatic
lifeforms the fisher is attempting to catch.

Gunsmith (Technician-AGL): Ability to construct, modify, and repair
small arms.  Gunsmith is a cascade skill, which breaks down according to
type as follows: Archaic Firearms (which includes all black powder
firearms, and crossbows), CPR Firearms (which includes all firearms
which use a conventional fixed cartridge consisting of a bullet(s),
propellant, and a primer), Gauss Weapons, Laser Weapons, and High-Energy
Weapons (which includes both plasma and fusion weapons).

   The difficulty of Gunsmith tasks varies greatly with the task the
character is trying to accomplish, and what tools the character may or
may not have at hand.  Most normal tasks (fitting and sighting in a
telescopic sight, reloading CPR Firearm rounds) are Average with the
proper equipment.  Some tasks, like constructing an improvised CPR
Firearm (aka "zip gun") or making adjustments to the internal ignition
lasers on a plasma rifle are normally Average tasks, but become
Difficult, Uncertain tasks with potentially fatal results if not perform
the proper tools.  In all cases, the referee should carefully evaluate
what task the player wants his character to perform, and advise against
particularly risky actions ("mounting that on your gauss pistol is
probably not a good idea").  

Scrounging (Explore-INT): The character is skilled in finding relic
items such as spare parts, vac suits, weapons, etc.  Scrounging involves
more than just randomly searching through ruins.  An individual with
this skill is familiar with the kinds of ruins to search for a
particular relic item and where within those ruins that item is most
likely to be found.  In the case of a previously contacted inhabited
world, the individual will have knowledge of the proper inhabitants to
contact regarding the availability of relics, local laws governing their
sale and possession, and be aware of specific areas on the planet where
relics are most likely to be found.  When a character attempts to
scrounge for a specific object, the referee determines difficulty based
on his or her opinion of the likelihood the object is where the
character is looking.  The higher a character\'s Scrounging skill, the
more likely he is to find useful things in unlikely places.

Scuba (Explore--CON): Ability to use an aqualung, rebreather, artificial
gill, or other devices that enable an air breathing individual to obtain
necessary oxygen underwater.  This skill may not be acquired at a higher
level than the character\'s Swimming skill.

Security (Perception-INT): The individual is knowledgeable in the area
of security procedures.  It is broken into two cascades: Physical
Security and Anti-Terrorism.  
   Physical Security reflects a familiarity with the proper use and
placement of a variety of physical security devices, including
mechanical and electronic locks, alarm systems, and a wide spectrum of
sensors, including infrared sensors and cameras.  While it is the job of
experts in this skill to prevent break-ins (usually by individuals with
Intrusion skill), their special knowledge can be of great assistance to
someone attempting defeat a physical security system.
   Anti-terrorism covers a broad spectrum of security procedures
designed to deter terrorism and other similar criminal behavior.  These
include the proper deployment and use of scanning equipment (bomb and
weapon detectors), "hands on" physical search techniques, correct
procedures for establishing security patrols and escorts, check points,
motorcades, and convoys.

Maybe we have too many choices for our major ship weapons.  From 1650 to
1820, there wasn\'t much change in the cannon on ships, and the cannon on a
merchantman was pretty much the same cannon as on a ship of the line. 
There wasn\'t much difference in range or hitting power.

Well, I don\'t know about the destroyer.  A squadron of destroyers could try
to get into torpedo range, but the 5-in guns on destroyers couldn\'t dent a
BB\'s hull.  The 8-in guns of a cruiser weren\'t a threat either.  

In the 17th & 18th centuries ship handling and gunnery skills played a
bigger part in combat than it does now, and inferior forces *could* prevail
through skillful maneuver and accurate gunnery.  The fat merchantman
couldn\'t outrun or outgun a corsair in a stand-up fight, but a good gunner
*might* take out the corsair\'s main mast, and a good sail master *might* be
able to keep the corsair at bay until night and the chance to slip away.

If we want *this* feel, then not only the combat systems, but the
technologies need to support it.  Not only support it, but make it the
optimal solution for designers and players.

case of Mercenary) will be notified by e-mail to submit a final bid.
They will have until 1200 AM, MST, February 7, 1997 to submit the
final bid.  Winning bidders will be the person who bids highest.  He
will pay $1 more than the next highest bid regardless of what he bid.
For example:

Bidder A bids $17
Bidder B bids $14
Bidder A wins the item and pays $15 ($14+$1)

2)  Bid prices do not include shipping

3)  Minimum Bid increments are $1

4)  Payment will be taken by check or money order in US$ only.
Payment by check will require a 2 week holding period for the check to
clear.  Money orders will be shipped the following day.

5) Bids will be accepted by e-mail only to:
sdollar@goodnet.com

6) Updates to the auction will be posted daily to USENet and the list.

This series gives a kind of magical twist to Psionics yet I found things in

	Why not ?  1500 year old artifacts are sold every week of every year
right here & now on Earth (at auction at fine Antiques places), they
just cost an arm & a leg.	If we are still selling 2000 year old TL 2
Roman artifacts that have been stored in atmosphere all this time, why
can\'t the Syleans be selling the far better made Tl 12 or Tl 14 space
suits (many of which were probably stored in space).

	When I said that the suits were experimental I was thinking that
perhaps 1 in 10,000 (0.01 %) of all Second Empire spacesuits were made
at TL 14.  The third Imperium had a population (circa 1100) of about 11
trillion people (1.1 x 10^13), I have never seen population data on the
First or Second Imperium but I am going to assume that their population
was at least 1 trillion (1 x 10^12). If 2% of these people had Vac Suits
this is 20 billion (1 x 10^10) suits.  If 1 in 10,000 of these suits was
Tl 14 that makes 2 million (2,000,000) Tl 14 Vac Suits. If 0.5% of these
suits survived that makes 10,000 suits surviving.  The Second Empire
covered an area about equal to 250 full subsectors & if the suits were
randomly spread out this would make about 40 suits per subsector.  If
50% of these were sold every century this would mean that 1 suit was
sold every 5 years in the Sylean subsector alone & if suits were
imported from other subsectors they would sell even faster.

	Now one sale every few years may not seem like a lot BUT if the suits
are expensive enough this may enough to establish a market.   Original
works of art are (by definition) unique but they sell all the time (they
just cost millions), maybe the market for TL 14 Vac Suits is similar.

	Or we could just make the simple assumption that 1 medium size ship
whose crew were all issued TL 14 suits was recently (within 50 years)
found (maybe in a deep cometary orbit) around some nearby planet.  As a
matter of fact I am tempted to do a write up for JTAS describing this
type of situation...

	TL 14 Vac Suits do fit within the generally Tl 12 background of the
Rule of Man - if you want them to - if you don\'t want them in YOUR
campaign just ignore them.  Besides the suits can fill the role of a
neat gimmick in a Mileau 0 game while being about 5 orders of
magnitude_less_unbalancing of a campaign then most of the Ancient
Artifacts which turned up in the published CT & MT adventures.

I agree with that point : The mass limit between White dwarf an neutron star
evolution is 1.4 sun masses. Density is around 300kg/cm3 and radius is 1/100
of initial value.

By the way and simply for curiosity, does any one knows the ratio between
the star radius and the supernovae radius?

A Neutron stars are very small, their spin velocity and their magnetic field
is very strong. This focuses high energy particles (I think e- or may be
simply photons). I\'m not sure that those planets could accept life because
of radiations. Neutron star seems to be a mega PAWS, doesn\'t it?


Finally I\'m quoting a part of a previous mail from Leonard Erickson, related
to Neutron stars.

No, I mean that planets can form orbiting the supernova remnant! One
example is PSR B1257+12. The planets orbiting this pulsar are thought
to have formed from the debris cloud left behind by the supernova.

*Those* will be strange planets!

And could during the course of a campaign cross the Atlantic several
times. On its way to Trafalger the French fleet left Brest, sailed to the
West Indies and then back towards the Meditterranian. The very art of
Naval strategy was to guess where the enemy was going.

Ships could reprovision and repair without any shore facilities, all that
was need was fresh water, some food and good strong tall trees. There
was great resistance to the introduction of steam because of the cost
of building the neccessary shore facilities to support world wide
deployment.

One word (said with a look of manical glee) "Cannonade". The

Ships which were sunk in battle were usually sunk by either catastrophic

Boarding actions were a ***major*** factor in naval combat. (Just why

Um, the \'weather gauge\' was getting up wind so you could bear down on
the enemy, it made it harder to run away; the French through out the period
traditionally refused the weather gauge.

A long period of stable technology with ship design fixed and altering only in
detail.  Which combined with ships of this eras basic durability, lead to
extremely long life for warships (100+ years).

The vast bulk of the SoL\'s laid up in reserve during peace.

The vital role of the cruising ships (frigates and sloops)

Ships on the high seas are virtually immune to detection and
therefore attack, as well as being totally isolated (very similiar
to being in jump space).

Vast lattitude for \'minor\' ecentricities on the part of senior officers.
Very harsh disipline for the rank and file. Seperation of combat
command functions (the Captain, a career officer) and day to
day running of the ship (the Master, a senior ranker who had
worked his way up). Extremely \'honourable\' code of behavour
and respect for your enemy (defeated captains entertained in
the victors mess).

You\'ve also got piracy and letters of marque, features absent
after this period.

>How does all this compare to the environment and the kind of
>technology we have to deal with in the Traveller universe.

Strategically I think its very similar. Its not as close tactically,
but still close enough to draw parallels; and its a damn sight
mor fun too.

The discussions going on about the max G forces allowed in ship design,

Is G taken as the force on a body relative to the surface of Terra, or the
Surface of what ever body is causing the Gravity well.

cos\' if its from Terra, then the relative speed of G6 from a body the size
of Jupiter would be about 1000 times slower, where as G6 from Lunar would
be 5 times what it is from Terra,

If on the other hand it is from the nearest body then From Jupiter about
100th of a G would kill a Human.

The point of this is that if you are in interstellar or even inter system
space the gravitational forces on you are variable upon distance from
celestial bodies and therefore talking about 6G is really a waste of time,
especially since if you are having ship combat mid system and you hit 6g
you are probably a couple of light days/months/years from where you wanted
to be or as the Hitchhikers Guide says moves like a fish, steers like a cow.

G is an acceleration value. If a body accelerates with 10m/s, then this
is 1G. It is always 1G. This is how I understand it -- well and it\'s
some time ago (bout 12 years) since I\'ve learnt it at school.

Well, my favorite Traveller music isn\'t realy Traveller, unless you consider 
that t was partialy it\'s inspiration.  That would be all the music done by 
JOhn Williams for Star Wars.  Imagine if you will, dite the hard times MT 
era, you see Emperor Lucan stroll towards the Iridum throne to make a speach 
on "destroying Dulinor" and in the backgound you hear "Imperial March" (Da, 
da, da, da de dum, da de dum!)

Or the Rebel Aliance Anthum done when Norris does a speach in Mora!
(think Arrival Vengence)


I also like to use "cyberpunkish" music for when the pc\'s enter a tough bar. 
 Efate back in the times i was playing TNE was a "Bladerunner-ish" world in

Just some of my stuff I like peronaly :)

I only came in at TNE, so I have no idea what the thruster plates do with different gravity wells.

1 g-turn is a velocity of 60000kmph, or 0.1 light seconds every half hour.
from the sun to the earth is 5 light _minutes_, or 125 days for 1 g-turn used, 62 for 2 g-turns. space is BIG.

here is a similair question - the Regency handbook describes the rape of Trin, and how forces were diverted from gas giants to a planet to try and prevent the virus ship from refueling. How do you cross a system that quickly? I guess it only takes a day or two to land, scoop, and refuel enough to jump out.

But there are two kinds of mistakes: Those that are reasonable and those that
are not. That Imperials believe some thing about the Zhodani that turns out
not to be the case, is one kind; but saying that the Rule of Man only reached
TL 12 when it actually reached TL 14 is another. In one case the evidence is
missing or it is plausible that it was ignored; in the other the evidence 
would be much too widespread to miss. Usually the trouble is not with a
single fact, but with the ramifications of that fact. For example, the
problem with having four _Kinunir_ class cruisers be a significan slice of
the Regina Subsector forces is not with the cruisers themselves, but with
what it implies about overall Imperial strength levels and, through that,
the Imperial tax base (Hint: You need a lot fewer people than 15 trillion to
pay for four 1200 T ships per subsector). OTOH until the Zhodani refrained
from attacking the Domain during the Rebellion, the ramifications of them
_being_ evil bastards and of the Imperials just _believing_ that they were
evil bastards were precisely the same.

(Also there is two kinds of information: Referee info and Player info. Player
info should be what is generally believed while Referee info should, IMO, be 
"true". I\'ll grant you that it is not always easy to determine just what is
what.)

But the fact that MT introduced some wild shoots that ought to be pruned 
does not automatically mean that one should throw out everything that MT 
introduced. IMO only those MT stuff that dosen\'t make sense should be
corrected. Anything else should be kept. The various TLs reached by the
various civilizations mentioned in _Referee\'s Companion_, for example, does 
not contradict anything established in CT. So why change it?

It\'s one thing if Marc Miller decides that some hitherto canon bits should
be changed. It\'s another when an author ignores or forgets previous canon
and changes things without even realizing it. I prfectly aware that the 
Traveller Universe is so big by now that mistakes are inevitable (though I 
do think that one could reasonably expect a new Traveller author to be 
required to read the main books of the three previous systems). In any case, 
whether the discrepancy is anyone\'s fault or not, it ought to be corrected 
(or, ideally, but not always possible, explained in a way that fixes the 
problem). To go from the general to the specific, the suggestion that those 
pesky vac suits came from a single high-tech world fairly close to Sylea is, 
IMO, a pretty decent fix. But that means introducing another fact into the 
canon: the existence of this planet and that it had a thriving trade in vac 
suits (and propably other things) with Sylea shortly before the Long Night.

Opinion alert: In my opinion facts that dosen\'t contradict previous canon
should not be changed, even by Marc Miller Himself, unless there is an
overwhelmingly good reason for doing so. Not just a good reason; if some 
aspect of the Traveller Universe has been established to be one way, 
changing it just because the new version is slightly better is not worth 
the loss of internal consistency. If, however, said facts are contradicted 
by other facts or if they are so implausible, that the increased 
versimilitude gained by changing them would outweigh the loss of 
consistency, then it is OK. (And who is to be the arbiter of what is 
plausible and what is not? Marc Miller, of course, but I reserve the right 
to have my own opinions on the subject).

It seems clear to me from the Traveller history that tech advancement does
_not_ proceed the way it does on Earth today when you reach higher TLs.
The Imperium is in contact with a former TL 16 civilization (The Darrians)
no later than 148 (much earlier, IMO, but that controversial), yet it 
dosen\'t reach TL 13 till 300, TL 14 till 700 and TL 15 till 1000. And it\'s
not _just_ lack of the industry to build the things, though that is no
doubt one of the reasons (My personal take on planetary TLs is that it 
denotes the TL that 90% or more of its population enjoy; the TL of an
interstellar civilization would then be the highest TL of its major
planets). Even in 1100 there are things about the Darrian TL 16 artifacts
that just isn\'t understood.

Besides, I\'d expect Sylea at least to be such an economic powerhouse that
it would be able to produce anything they could understand fairly soon
afterwards, which implies to me that Sylea\'s _knowledge_ TL dosen\'t
precede it\'s _achievement_ TL by more than a generation at most. YMMW.

Oh, and do we really want Sylea to be able to build a few TL 14 couriers
in Year 0? I mean, even if they can\'t build enough for everybody, surely the
government would spring for pretty inflated costs for a couple of dozens 
jump-5 couriers if they could?

>Thus, it is unlikely that such suits would be available on the open market.  

Once the government has had a few of those vac suits analyzed and realized 
that the can\'t duplicate them, the rest may well be allowed to go to the 
open market. Of course, this presupposes that there are many more available...

Heavily damaged ships in Traveller might be in a far worse plight, but 
the rest does sound like Traveller - a lot of things can be jury riggged.

Yes, but size of guns could make a big differnce. Actually, most SOL
actions in the Nelsonic period were fought up close - range was less
important than volume of fire. On the other hand, going back to the 
sixteenth century, the ability of the Venetians and the Knights of Malta
to hit at extreme range with the guns in their galleys was vital to 
their survival and their tactics. Listening to some of the discussions 
here, it seems to me that the old debate between firepower and boarding
enthusiasts continues in Traveller.

I would like a bit of fleshing out on what\'s found in a typical engineers
toolbox.

I\'ll start out with some of my own ideas;

Crystaliron Aligner; TL 13, Cr. 120,000, 24Kg
	This device is a large, handheld fusing and unfusing tool which
bonds two pieces of crystaliron by aligning their crystalline structure in
concert.  It uses a combination of high-intensity magnetic and gravitic
fields, and an electric current to polarize (or depolarize) the
crystalline molecules at the edge of a prefabricated sheet of crystaliron.
	Power is supplied by a standard power adapter and cord which must
be attached to any 10Mw or higher power source to operate.
	This device can only bond at the edges of a manufactured piece of
crystaliron, since the forces used to make the sheets is much greater than
can be projected through a handheld unit.  Bonds created by the unit can
be unbonded by the unit as well.

Crystaliron Cutter; TL13, Cr 220,000, 310 Kg
	A mounted piece of equipment found in many machine shops, the
crystaliron cutter is the equivalent of a band saw for crystaliron.  It
may use either a focussed laser, or a superdense cutting blade (at TL14)
to slice large pieces into smaller pieces.
	The model priced here is intended to be able to make straight or
curved cuts on relatively small pieces of material.

Structural Analysis Scanner;  TL10 - 15, Cr 12,000  (+1000/TL over 10),
12Kg
	This handheld unit with integral power supply (Per TL; batteries
or fuel cells?) uses sonics and low power radar emissions to probe the
interior of almost any enclosed structure.  A specialized computer
analyzes the signals and displays a schematic of the object.  Resolution
at TL10 is adequate to detect fractures and other details of more than 1mm
to a depth of 5cm of steel.  The sensing probe must touch the surface 
of the item being probed.  Other sensors are added or improved at higher
TLs so that;
At TL11  Detection size .5mm, Depth 10cm
At TL12  Detection Size .2mm, Depth 20cm
At TL13  Detection Size .1mm, Dpeth 40cm
At TL14  Detection Size .05mm, Depth 80cm
At TL15  Detection Size .01mm, Depth 160cm (1.6m)
Use toughness factor to figure out penetration of other materials (divide
penetration by toughness).

Note that this sensor is specialized to detect microfractures and
weaknesses, particularly in fusion chamber walls and conduits, or ship
hulls.  Similar sensors are in use for specific purposes, such as scanning
for voids in thicknesses of materials, finding defects in crystals,
determining whether bones are broken in the sick bay or field.
[editor\'s note; if you believe Megatraveller, densitometers make this
thing silly. I never like densitometers, so I rejected tham, as TNE and T4
did after me.  This is a more reasonable version of a densitometer]

Doug sits stunned in front of the computer.. his life has ended.. no longer
a Traveller Guru.  Slowly he gathers the books, maps, and notes that have
defined twenty years of Traveller playing, and donates them to an orphanage.

Then, dressed in sackcloth, ringing a bell to warn passers-by of his status
as a gaming leper, he comes to the store..

"Ummm... where do you keep the.. A.. AA... AD&D?"

Cibo Matto is very very odd and good for that \'alien\' feeling.  Harvey has
a lot of almost subliminal base lines that are neat as background.

Industrial Music; **Depeche Mode**, New Order
Depeche mode is the best traveller music I\'ve heard.  It\'s almost all
synthesizer, giving it a futuristic feel, the lyrics are relatively quiet,
and of plot-usable themes, the beat is fast, without being loud or
driving.

Background; Alanis Morisette, Tori Amos, Peter Gabriel (older stuff and
the Birdie soundtrack esp.), occassionally a disc of Star Trek themes,
once the "Hello Dolly" soundtrack (don\'t ask).  Occassionally a plot
specific piece of music (theme from Ponderosa would be this weeks choice).
Annie Lenox, Eurythmics, "Boys on The Side" Soundtrack. 

Combat; Sisters of Mercy, Shubert (not my idea), Melissa Etheridge,
Wagner (you can guess what piece), Holst; "The Planets".

Ok, Colin,

What we\'re talking about here as G-forces is acceleration, not
gravitational pull. 1 G is the effect of acceleration at a speed of 9.smrf
mumble (can\'t rememebr it right now) meters per second squared. It is a
defined constant equal to the nominal gravitational pull at Terra\'s
surface.  It has nothing to do with the gravitational attraction of bodies
in space, which is what you\'re talking about. 

We use the same units, because thanks to good ol\' Albert, we know the
force due to acceleration on a body is indistinguishable in that body\'s
reference frame from the force due to gravitational attraction. That means
if you\'re in a six Gee field, it doesn\'t matter if you\'re standing \'still\'
on a really big planet, or are in your Famille Spofulam KillMyself hot rod
Grav bike going way over the speed limit, the force exerted upon you (and
your surrounding reference frame) are the same.

Hey, I like this! Back when I was using High Guard, I wrote ship
stats on 3x5 cards for reference during combat, making it easier and
faster to run. The cards described above, *if done properly*, could be
used in such a role, as well as trying to tap into the card-trading
market.

IMO, these cards should include detailed Travelleresque external views
of the ship being described on one side with the SSDS stats on the other.
What I\'d like to see is a side view with fore and aft views. >>

"Carronade", actually. The TNE/T4 equivalent is a non-grav X-ray laser,
which is shorter ranged than big lasers but nastier...

>What else?

In space, as in the Age of Sail, it\'s much easier to cripple a ship than
to sink it - previous iterations of Traveller have actually reflected this
pretty well; laser just punch holes in ships, and ships don\'t have anything
onboard that will explode (or at least explode with enough force to destroy the
whole ship) - as a result, battles will mostly consist of punching away with
lasers until enough of the target\'s systems are disabled that it can\'t fight
any more - remarkably similar to punching away at a wooden ship until most of its
cannons or sails are gone. Disabled ships would strike their colors (surrender);
I tend to use that sort of terminology/behaviour in Traveller as well - and
as a result, surrendering when disabled wouldn\'t be seen as dishonourable but
would be fairly common...

In another thread people are asking about book recommendations - I would like
to take this opportunity to recommend to *everyone* Patrick O\'Brian\'s
wonderful Aubrey/Maturin series of Napoleonic Naval novels - great source
materials for a naval campaign.

Here\'s the latest from the Nitpick Department:

G is a unit of acceleration, namely 9.8 meters per second per second (or 
- -9.8 m/sec^2, depending on how you\'re writing the equation), which is the 
force of gravity here on Earth (of course, it\'s not exact -- the force of 
gravity actually varies from place to place).  An object at rest on Earth 
will be subjected to a constant accelration of 1G towards the planet\'s 
center.  Without getting into a complicated discussion about the 
relationship between mass and weight, suffice it to say that, when you\'re 
experiencing 1G, your weight appears to be \'normal.\'  If you were to 
experience higher G\'s, your apparent weight would increase accordingly.

Higher G\'s are experienced when you suffer any acceleration than that due 
to gravity, such as the \'pressing into the seat\' you experience after 
stepping on the gas in your Ferrari and before an irritated policeman 
pulls you over.  The discussions about G-forces during space combat 
primarily have to do with how much additional acceleration (above 1-G) 
that human crews can take over time without suffering ill effects, or 
with the G-forces that starships can take without suffering structural 
damage.

For reference, the human body can take nine positive (downward) G\'s for 
short periods of time (seconds) provided that the proper conditions are 
met (a pilot in good shape with strong leg muscles wearing a flight suit 
designed to prevent blood pooling) but only two to three negative 
(upward) G\'s under the same conditions.

Any physics nobs out there will no doubt correct any errors in the above.

Great skils, but fishing, according to the basic rules (pp. 201) is a part
of Survival.  Unless this is used as a less general type of skill, for
secondary skill and character development purposes.  But In general Survival
is broader and therefore more usefull.  

I also really liked the Gunsmith cascade skill.  But one thought, shouldn\'t
large caliber CPR guns (mortars, recoiless rifles and howitizers) be another
cascade like Heavy Guns.  Along the same lines, shouldn\'t Heavy Weapons be a
cascade (for explosive devices like grenades, mines; and missiles like LAW,
tac missiles, unguided artillers rockets, etc.) too.

just an idea.

One more note, also according to the basic rules (pp. 127) the skill
swimming also grants the knowledge and understanding on how UBA\'s work
(underwater breathing apparatus) work.  New skills are great, but if you
have to spend a slot on every type of ability, ttne character gen. doesn\'t
give enough slots.  

Making a character that is adept at _something_ should be possible without
too much one dimensioning of skills going on.

Just another idea.

Yes.  G = 10 meters/second*second.

The Traveller usage of G is as a unit of acelleration, approximately equal to
the surface gravity of Terra.  The surface gravity of Terra is 9.8 meters
per second per second.  Like many Terran-based units (Gs, Seconds, Days,
Hours, Years), this unit was introduced by the Terrans during the Rule of
Man.

In Traveller, 1G is equal to an acelleration of 10 meters per second per
second.  This differs slightly from the nominal Terran standard (for ease
of calculation, and the error is only about 2%).

No.  In Traveller, 6G _always_ means 60 meters/second*second.  You\'d express
the surface gravity of a planet in terms of a standard G (for example, the
surface gravity of Fooworld might be somewhere around 2.5G, and the surface
gravity of Barplanet might be 0.43G).

interest there is in Traveller, especially since T4 came out...

I save the daily list digests on floppy.  Looking back through
my collection, when I first joined, back in the MegaTraveller
era, it was possible to save an entire month\'s worth of digests,
plus, on a single floppy.  There was no XBoat list at the time.

When GDW collapsed, about a year ago, the list usage wasn\'t
significantly different (and I\'m including XBoat traffic in
that).

Since the announcement and release of T4, the list has been
averaging four to five times the volume of what it had been
prior to the collapse of GDW - I\'m averaging one megabyte to one
and one half megabytes per week.

In addition to that, I\'m seeing discussion (not a lot, but it\'s
there) of Traveller on rec.games.frp.misc - and I think I may be
missing some of it; I do a vgrep on subject lines, rather than
letting the computer find them for me, plus, I have suspicions
about the veracity of my provider\'s feed\'s statements that my
provider is getting a _complete_ feed.

Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe that reports of the demise of
Traveller are greatly exaggerated.

G is used as shorthand for the mean gravitational acceleration at sea
level on Terra, which is about 9.8 m/s^2, or 32 ft/s^2.  By the relation
F=ma, you may translate acceleration into the force applied to a body of
mass m.

> Is G taken as the force on a body relative to the surface of Terra, or the
> Surface of what ever body is causing the Gravity well.

It\'s critical to realize that G\'s are measure in units of acceleration
(distance over (time squared)), not force (mass times distance over (time
squared)).  For small objects dropped in a large gravity well (say, a 1
gram BB and a 1 kg brick dropped from a meter above the surface of Terra),
the accelerations are identical (1 G each), but the force on the brick is
1000 times that on the BB.

The phrase "the relative speed of G6" is meaningless; it\'s an error on
exactly the same level as "the relative distance of 20 km/s."  You\'re
comparing apples and oranges (or functions and first time derivatives),
which is a losing game.

Somehow, I doubt that 0.23 G (1/100 of 2.3 G, the gravity at Jupiter\'s
cloudtops) would hurt all that bad. :)

Hope you now understand that it\'s a fixed acceleration, hence not a waste
of time.  And, of course, it\'s purely arbitrary (just like 1 bar is
Earth\'s mean sea-level atmospheric pressure -- highly terracentric, but
heck, it\'s convenient for *us*).

Getting a light-day off course is quite a trick, even at high acceleration
(assuming you start out more or less at rest, of course).  Realize that
with BL/BR 0.1-light-second hexes, one light day is 864,000 hexes.  Think
about that for a while.  Then realize that a light year at the same scale
is roughly 316 *million* hexes.  Space is *big*.

By the way, just for comparison, on the same BL/BR scale Earth and Luna
are about 12 hexes apart.

short commings.

Most relating to the UCP setup.

The TNE setup is too detailed and cumbersome at times. And it takes
too much time to set up when it comes to damage location and hit point
calculation.

T4 Lacks information. A TL 15 ship ain\'t much better than a TL 13 in
combat as most values are "abstracted" A single laser turret usually
end up in the 2-0-0-0 or 2-2-2-2 area. And the TL 15 turret will be
"over powered" as 41% of the effect is lost by the abstraction. And
then we are talking about a 750Mj nongravitic x-ray laser. That\'s
quite a lot for a small turret. A 250Mj turret would be of the same
use, and that is 33% Mj-vise.

And the notion of a puny UCP 1 laser destroying a maneuver 1 drive
with one shot doesn\'t wash. Especially if the drive are fitted to
30,000 ton craft.

I would like to see a system where the components has hitpoints as the
lasers and Spinals mounts has them. And a simplified hitlocation
system from the TNE. Not as elaborate as the one in BL but something
similar. Just based on the whole hull. Example:=20

I have taken the percentage of the main section and found how much it
would make out on a D20. I started with the side arc as we asume that
most components would have equal chance to be hit. The I adjusted for
front arc by substracting 2 from the Engineer section and added one to
Quarters and one to electronics. On the aft section I added two and
took two from quarters as electronics should at least have one hit.

When a laser hits check for antenna hits. Antennas should have the sam
number of hit poinst as their surface area. An laser can maximum do 5
points of damage to an antenna, as most antennas would likely surviva
and fuction with a hole in the aperture. However with poorer
resolution. Rest damage is penetrating the hull and doing damage as
usual.

Hi just a quick question that came up during the weekend\'s
session I\'m GM\'ing.
When a ship exits from jumpspace is there any information
obtainable from the energy discharge it makes? ie when a 
(for instance) Patroling ship insystem detects the energy
discharge can they determine 
- -the size of the ship
- -what direction it jumped in from
- -how far it jumped
also what info if any can be determined when a ship jumps out
Thanks
Dave

Design Workshop I - QSDS 101 was a great success!  The turnout was 
not as large as I might have hoped, but Commander X was an 
outstanding teacher and everyone who attended seemed very pleased 
with the class.  Thank you, Commander X for your time and patience!

Design Workshop II - SSDS 101 will be held on Saturday, February 15, 
1997, 8pm EST on the IG IRC server.  Mark your calendars now!

spreadsheet for TNE starship design I have found that both has its
short commings.

Most relating to the UCP setup.

The TNE setup is too detailed and cumbersome at times. And it takes
too much time to set up when it comes to damage location and hit point
calculation.

T4 Lacks information. A TL 15 ship ain\'t much better than a TL 13 in
combat as most values are "abstracted" A single laser turret usually
end up in the 2-0-0-0 or 2-2-2-2 area. And the TL 15 turret will be
"over powered" as 41% of the effect is lost by the abstraction. And
then we are talking about a 750Mj nongravitic x-ray laser. That\'s
quite a lot for a small turret. A 250Mj turret would be of the same
use, and that is 33% Mj-vise.

And the notion of a puny UCP 1 laser destroying a maneuver 1 drive
with one shot doesn\'t wash. Especially if the drive are fitted to
30,000 ton craft.

I would like to see a system where the components has hitpoints as the
lasers and Spinals mounts has them. And a simplified hitlocation
system from the TNE. Not as elaborate as the one in BL but something
similar. Just based on the whole hull. Example:=20

I have taken the percentage of the main section and found how much it
would make out on a D20. I started with the side arc as we asume that
most components would have equal chance to be hit. The I adjusted for
front arc by substracting 2 from the Engineer section and added one to
Quarters and one to electronics. On the aft section I added two and
took two from quarters as electronics should at least have one hit.

When a laser hits check for antenna hits. Antennas should have the sam
number of hit poinst as their surface area. An laser can maximum do 5
points of damage to an antenna, as most antennas would likely surviva
and fuction with a hole in the aperture. However with poorer
resolution. Rest damage is penetrating the hull and doing damage as
usual.

I prefer movie soundtracks such as Terminator,
Predator, the theme to "Robin Hood, Prince of

from New York (Snake Pliskin, the one and only),
and various war flicks.

Traveller is an action game (usually) so I go
with action movies.

Not in Traveller. Two weeks max is assumed for the vast majority of
ships.

Crews can perform repairs using any parts/tools supplied by the ship.
Heavily damaged ships may not be able to Jump or maneuver and there
have never been any rules published for towing a ship by anything
other than a specialized tug design.

There are definitely differences in weapon performance (i.e. lasers vs.
PAWS vs. Meson guns).

You can do the same to any Traveller ship and it will still float in
space.  ;-)

Applicable to Traveller only if you take out the power plant and M-drive
rather quickly.

Possible in Traveller if realistic relative velocities are brought into
play and accel is limited to 6Gs.

The above, AFAIR, was truly applicable only to Brilliant Lances. Systems
like High Guard, QSDS, etc. simply didn\'t allow for the kind of detail
required for maneuverability being that critical. They certainly weren\'t
detailed enough for tactic movement to be a consideration.

Now this definitely sounds like High Guard.

"Ports" would translate to starports or critical star systems. This

Convoys were actually a viable consideration in BL but not in the more
abstract combat systems. I could have sworn Spain used convoys for
protection from pirates along the Spanish Main. Or was it just for the
trips back to the home country?

Hi, Harold.

I like the skills selections you\'ve posted but I\'m thinking that the
Fishing skill should be cascaded to individual worlds, depending on
the kind of critters you\'re trying to catch. Each environment could
have radically different creatures which would require skills a
Terran fisherman wouldn\'t have a clue about.

Like those new wide-mouthed beer cans that are being advertised everywhere
right now? <gd&r>

I know what you mean, the carronade...yes? 

The British introduced and had great success with the carronade. It was a
shortrange cannon hurling a 32+ lb ball with much superior smashing power
than the standard 12, 16 or 24 pounders.  It was cheaper and easier to
manufacture than the conventional cannon too.

The British were successful with it as long as their ships had the
advantage in speed and maneuverability.  They used their maneuvering
advantage to get in close and pound their opponents, while avoiding the
long-range fire of their enemies.

In the War of 1812, the Americans used *their* speed and
maneuverability to stay out of range of the British carronades and cut them
up with accurate long-range fire.

I guess the carronade is the fusion gun in Traveller...nice and powerful,
but *very* short ranged.

I always write cannonade, and then have to go back and change it to
carronade.  Does anyone know why they\'re called ca_rr_onades?

Yeah, I can buy that.  <g> 

The fusion or plasma gun is a more colorful carronade though, and if I
remember ranges right it certainly would shorten, short range.

That\'s true, they are good books.  Don\'t forget the old Hornblower books by
Forrester either.

I\'ll second Weber\'s, Harrington series too.  Balisk Station has a ripping
good single ship to ship sequence, and Flag in Exile has a good fleet
action for example.  The technology is certainly not Traveller canon:  300
to 500 G acceleration ships; drives use "impeller wedges" (some kind of
gravity thing) that work *partially* in hyperspace; sailing around FTL is
*sailing* on hyperspace currents; fleet battles are between massed and huge
"Ships of the Wall"; and weapons seem to be mainly missles (laser head),
but lasers, grasers, paws, and "grav lances" are also mentioned, but it
fairly consistent.

For a cannon of size x, that is partially true (improvements in the quality
of gunpowder doubled range; improvements in metallurgy increased the size
and strength of weapons - and in the power they exerted).  However...

o  Warship decks were built strongly to withstand the pounding by many heavy
cannon.  A several-ton cannon (36 lbs weighed a few tons and required a crew
of 8 to man-handle the thing into firing position) firing would tear a more
lightly built merchantman apart after a few rounds.

o  Warship sides were built think to withstand the pounding of enemy
cannonballs.  This (and the guns and enough men and ammo for the guns) left
not much floatation for cargo.

o  Merchantmen hulls were wide (to increase cargo capacity).  While the
difference between 4-6 knots (merchantmen) and 8-12 knots (warships) may not
seem like much, note that this is a difference of 2:1 or 3:1 - similar to
the difference between M1/M2 and M4 ships (old style if these are no longer
used.)
 
Note that the analogy begins to fall apart here for Traveller; the crude
mechanics of th weaponry used no longer has a bearing on vessel speed
(although desired armor level does)

Actually, gunboats existed in the Napoleonic era (and featured highly in US
Naval defense plans!), consisting usually of a specially strengthened rowed
vessel mounting 1 large gun, usually pointing forward.  They were used as a
portable harbor defense battery, and were only dangerous to larger war craft
in harbors and bays where handling larger craft was ungainly or in a lack of
wind.

More likely two swift ships with little difference between them might make a
good race of it - such as a packet and a corsair (both built for speed), or
a merchantman fleeing a merchantman turned privateer. In such cases, being
able to better balance your particular ship in the particular point of the
wind you were sailing in gave you an additional knot or two; having a crew
that could change/reset sail fastest could help.  A general merchantman had
little chance fleeing anything built with speed, rather than ladening, in mind.

Gunnery skills for such sniping gave you a chance - but no more than that;
the weaponry was simply not that accurate.  Your vessel still had to get in
range, and you could sight much further than range; sail handling counted
for much more.

The more common gunnery skill was the speed with which your gun crews could
reload - and the degree to which once battle started they could ignore doing
everything but loading and firing!  Like the infantry tactics of the day,
ships were designed to fight by firing quantities of ammunition at the
enemy, figuring that the odds of hitting something that would damage the
enemy would increase as you fired more shots...

It was anything BUT meaningless in a roleplaying context to know exactly
which sensors you had, how many SR\'s, which commo, etc. FF&S made even more
detail required, namely WHERE is iit,  and Where can it fire?

I have; it was basically you can move a number of squares per turn equal to
your agility, and rages in squares converted to close, long, and disengaged
brackets from HG.

I always used mayday movement with Personal Combat System stats for weapons
(except for mesons and disintigrators, which don\'t convert by the tables in
PH). This works well, if you extrapolate the Fire Control Table for more
range bands.

Traveller Reads, er.. Traveller Related Reading (sorry, my Cerebus habit
is showing):

 -Poul Anderson\'s space books. All of them.  This includes the Flandry/
  Imperium cycle, the van Rijn/Falkayn/Polesotechnic League books, and the
  "incomplete" (but actually rather extensive) Psychotechnic League books.
  Not to mention some stand-alones like The Avatar, Tau Zero and Orion Shall
  Rise.

 -Lois McMaster Bujold\'s Vorkosigan cycle.

 -Elizabeth Moon\'s Hunting Party trilogy.

 -Robert Frezza\'s "McLendon\'s Syndrome" and its sequel "The VMR Theory"

 -David Drake\'s "Hammer\'s Slammers" series, though just the first book
  will give you a good idea...  Much of Drake\'s other work is readable in
  a Traveller context.

 -Melissa Scott\'s Roads of Heaven trilogy. Variant (uses magic in space)
  but very Traveller feel besides this. She has also done some other things
  I recommend but can\'t remember the names of...

 -Anne McCaffrey\'s Dinosaur Planet cycle, including "Death of Sleep",
  "Sassinak," "Dinosaur Planet," "Dinosaur Planet Survivors," and "The
  Planet Pirates".  Also read the Crystal Singer books and the Ship Who
  Sang cycle.

 -Andre Norton\'s space books. This includes many pairs, trilogies and
  series as well as singles.

 -Benford and Brin\'s "Heart of the Comet."

 -Greg Bear\'s Eon trilogy, "Eon," "Eternity," and "Legacy."  Legacy is
  the most Travelleresque of these, but they are all worth the read.

 -David Brin\'s Earthclan books: Sundiver, Startide Rising, Uplift War,
  Brightness Reef and Infinity\'s Shore.

 -Brian Daley\'s Hobart Floyt trilogy: Requiem for a Ruler of Worlds,
  Jinx on a Terran Inheritance, and Fall of the White Ship Avatar. Sadly,
  Mr. Daley died a couple years ago, so we will never see more of this
  quintessentially Traveller series.

 -Robert Heinlein\'s too-numerous-to-mention library of books.

 -Alfred Bester\'s "The Stars My Destination."

 -Douglas Adams\' Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy trilogy, though only
  the first three are really worth it.

 -Joe Haldeman\'s "Forever War."

 -David(?) Weber\'s Honor Harrington series, which is at six books and
  growing.

 -Arthur C. Clarke\'s "The Songs of Distant Earth" as well as the 2001
  trilogy.

 -C.J. Cherryh\'s Chanur books, as well as the Downbelow Station/Cyteen/
  Forty Thousand in Gehenna cycle.

 -Alan Dean Foster\'s Humanx Commonwealth stuff. All of it.  This includes
  the Flinx books.

 -Phil Foglio\'s Buck Godot series. Actually a comic book. Very funny and
  worth the effort to find and read.

  That will have to do for now. These are not listed in any particular
order of preference, but are presented in the order they drifted to
the surface of my tired brain. I\'m sure more will surface...

Well, I\'ve avoided them like the plague, but the demo we ran at OrkCon had
me fixed. Jo Grant (originator of the game), James Burdick and I spent ages
playing and coming up with new ideas, rules, etc.

The proposal is with IG for taking this further; we\'ll have to see what
Courtney thinks (he has a lot on his hands just getting all the products out
this year).

Whether or not it makes it to a product in the near future, BITS/CORE intend
to run demo games of the CCG at both the US GEN CON and Euro GEN CON. So, if
you\'re interested, turn up and see us!

We\'ve also been contributing to the GEN CON discussions with Tim Brown and,
hopefully, there should be big Traveller tournaments and everything you\'d
expect of a successful games company at both GEN CONs!

The two *big* differences are that jumps have a duration proportional
the length. You can drop out early, if you don\'t care about being quite
a ways from your destination. And of course, that means that you can
make a "microjump" and pop out quiclky (instead of a week later).

The other big difference is that they have FTL communications. But this
isn\'t all that important for reasons that will become clear when you
read the books.

But your velocity is always *zero*. It\'s everyone and everything else
that is moving. Which means measuring *your* velocity *relative* to
another ship requires bouncing radar or lidar pulses off them. And
between time lag and the like, the gives you more uncertainty.

If the ships are both *coasting* (ie moving at a constant velocity)
then after a few exchanges of ranging pulses, they can get a decenet
figure for relative velocity.

If either ship is accelerating (changing velocity in magnitude *or*
direction) then you can\'t do this. But you *can* determine
unequivocally *which* ship is accelerating. :-)

This is rather interesting. Enli is an Assyrian name[1]. And the rest
look rather Assyrian as well.

Hmmm. I wonder which part of the world Grandfather stole the

Well, one thought that has occured to me is that this would make an
interesting battle rider design. You have the "carrier" be a cylinder
that fits through the "hole" easily. You just "stack" the riders onn
the "jump bus".

And if tractor beams are allowed, it makes a good design for customs
work, and the like. You "grapple" the other ship with the tractor beams
and pull it into the center of the "hole". So you have *lots* of
weapons showing, and you have it "surrounded".

It might also make a good design for a miltary cargo hauler or escort.
Wrap it around the cargo. 

For that matter, with properly designed drives, it could use "the drop
tank from hell". A *big* drop tank that fits thru the center of the
ship. I could even see a ship dropping a partly full tank to drift
while it sneaks in to raid. It\'d still have enough fuel for jump 1, but
if it *does* manage to get back to the tank it has a *lot* more fuel.

This design could also be useful for stealthy approaches. Both gravity
and heating can be handled by spinning the ship. That helps reduce the
signature a lot while it imitates a piece of space junk on approach. :-)

This is also what made piracy *possible*. Pirates didn\'t *need*
shipyards or large fuel supplies.

My posts (many months back) about the sort of "fabricator" type
technology that ought to be avialable even at TL 10 or so makes this
possible again. If you have the "design specs" to feed into the faber,
power, and a supply of the right elements, you can replace it. 

So only *major* components would be a problem. Hull plates can be
repaired by "welding" in sections. Otherwise the limit is that the part
has to be able to fit the output of the faber.

Not true. Bigger guns *did* do more damage. A 12 pounder would bounce
off a ship that a 42 pounder would punch through *both* sides of.
Ranges *were* limited. Hitting at range was next to impossible for
broadside weapons. Only the bow and stern weapons were designed with
range in mind, and crewed by people who could use them effectively at
range.

Well, you can\'t "sink" a spacecraft. But destroying them is possible.

This isn\'t likely to happen. Heck, it\'d take *major* efforts just to
intercept crippled ships before they left the system. Consider a ship
that\'s been accelerating for an hour. It\'s travelling at over 200
km/sec. After a few hours, finding it after the battle could get *real*
ugly.

This checks out ok.

Manueverability *should* be closely tied to acceleration.

Interesting. The old microgame "War War" gave Assyrian names to their star

Well it should be cascaded into fishing equipment like Fishing(Bendor)
Net-3, Fishing(Wurzburg) Float&Sink-5 et c ;)

No seriously, fishing is included in sSurvival as is (should be) Hunting.
Gunsmith should be included in Mechanic et c. If a character wants to flesh
out his guy with arcane splitcanerod flyfishing Terra/V=E4nern then let them
but keep the skills general. More skills does not make a rpg better,
more rules for skill use does.

Speaking as the guy who is doing Planetology 101 in a few weeks on IRC..
because it is much easier this way.  When I say that a planet has a gravity
of 1.4g, my players don\'t have to convert from Sylea\'s .87g (or whatever) to
figure out how much they weigh!

I believe that Sylea is anear twin to Terra in terms of day length, mass,
yesr, etc.  this would explain its prominent place in the Rule of Man.  It
was probably easier to keep the Solomani units as a standard through the
longNight/Sylean Federation period.

Heh.  Take a look at the Solomani Rim, where there are more Mesopotamian

Yes, I usually get about 3 or 4 digests each morning - it takes
me quite a while to wade through it all!

Hm, well, now I don\'t know if that\'s such a good thing. I\'ve been
reading these threads and they\'re by no means all pro-Traveller.
One thread is Michael T. Richter, who panned T4 on his RPG review
web site. His criticisms about T4 are not totally unfounded, but
he\'s more or less a loud-mouthed anal git. (who doesn\'t read TML I
hope). Someone criticized the aliens in AA and was met with the response
"go out and buy the old books" which was met, in turn, by "what kind
of f*cking game requires you to go buy out of print supplements to
be playable?" which quickly degraded into a typical Usenet flame-fest.
But as they say in the ad industry "There\'s no such thing as bad press".

If there\'s one thing I\'ve noticed about r.g.f.m, it\'s that the delays 
of the Bablyon 5 RPG haven\'t really upset anyone drastically - IG would
do well to imitate Chameleon Electric - wait until the product is 
_done right_, then release it. But I shouldn\'t beat a dead horse.

I think I heard my T4 hardback wheeze yesterday and I could have sworn
I saw it pop an ibuprofen, but dead it most certainly is not. :)

This really boils down to a discussion of how many suits constitutes 
"significant quantities". As such it is unlikely that we\'ll ever agree
because we\'ll tend to stretch definitions to suit our preconcieved 
notions. But i\'ll give it a whirl.

>	When I said that the suits were experimental I was thinking that

OK, let\'s assume that.

>The third Imperium had a population (circa 1100) of about 11 trillion people 
>(1.1 x 10^13), 

15 trillion according to _Rebellion_.

>I have never seen population data on the

>was at least 1 trillion (1 x 10^12). 

That\'s propably as good an asumption as many others.

>If 2% of these people had Vac Suits 

This, OTOH, is not reasonable. The text in CSC says that the suits were
recovered from derelict ships. It takes money equivalent to the naval
taxes of 7400 people (at Cr 500 per) to provide the investment needed for 
one Free Trader with a crew of 10-12 people. That would be 1/6th of one 
percent of the population and the ratio becomes much worse the bigger the 
ship is.

>this is 20 billion (1 x 10^10) suits.  If 1 in 10,000 of these suits was
>Tl 14 that makes 2 million (2,000,000) Tl 14 Vac Suits. 


>If 0.5% of these suits survived that makes 10,000 suits surviving.  

Where do you get this assumption? You start by estimating how many 
derelict 2nd Empire ships survived to be found by the Syleans. You 
then multiply that with the odds that any one of them happened to be
those experimental devices. And you _then_ estimate the chance that 
any one of them survived 1500 years intact.

IIRC he text says that those suits go for 2-3 times their base value, but I
dont\' have the book to check.

That\'s a much better idea. It surmounts all my objections and only leaves
Harold\'s point that a TL 14 vac suit, even an experimental one, wouldn\'t
exist in a vacuum (so to speak), but implies extensive tech 13 knowledge
(and some manufacture) in a host of related fields. And as we all know
(by now) the Rule of Man wasn\'t even TL 13, it was TL 12.

>As a matter of fact I am tempted to do a write up for JTAS describing this

A good idea. Just make sure you explain where the level 13 support
technology came from, too.

Balderdash! I\'m not arguing about MY campaign or YOUR campaign but about
The Official Traveller Background (Ta-dah!). That I\'m quite able to filter
out any mistakes for my own use is completely irrelevant.

(I\'m sorry to be rude, but this comes just a couple of days after I\'ve
responded politely to a similar argument. It comes up every so often as
a last ditch defense and it never fails to irritate me.)

>Besides the suits can fill the role of a neat gimmick in a Mileau 0 game 

IMO they would be a lot neater if you couldn\'t buy them on the open markt
for 2-3 times the base price.

The British were rarely faster than their opponents - typically  their
ships were so fouled from long duty on blockade that they were much
slower
than their French and Spanish adversaries. Also, it should be noted that
the American frigates had much larger hulls and so could absorb more 
punishment.

As the other half of the Richter-Berry flame war, let me say that I\'ve never
seen a more unreasonable person.  He seems to think that because something
doesn\'t work the way he wants it too, it\'s a broken mechanism.  When you
quot e the rules to him, he insults you.  Amazing.  I am offcially ignoring
him from now on, BTW.. He and Terry Austin can scream at each other until

        In Canadian vernacular, Newfies (abbreviation for citizens of
Newfoundland) tend to be the butt of jokes ridiculing their alleged general
cluelessness.  A typical joke revolves around a Newfie-designed parachute
that opens on impact.

        The above idea about donut-shaped customs vessels reminds me of the
back of the old Canadian $50 bill.  It had a scene of the RCMP\'s Musical
Ride (basically, crack horsemen doing the equestrian equivalent of
synchronized swimming) all gathered around in a circular formation with
their lances pointed inward.  That particular formation is nicknamed the
"Newfie firing squad".

        A Tim Horton-class Customs Cruiser would definitely require
extensive armouring on the *inside* of the torus :)...

Oh, I don\'t dispute that a 42 pounder did much more damage than a 12
pounder. <g>  What I was trying to get across was that there were a
standardized and limited number of weapon sizes. You had  the 12, 16 and
24 pounders for long range and later the carronades (I think they were
usually 32 pounders), in the British navy. There were other guns, but
they were rare...standardization was important...it *still* would be
important in 3,000 years.  Merchant ships mounted the same standard
sized weapons, so you could fit them into the same firing carrages, use
the same balls, the same powder loads (more or less), and they were all
operated the same so a gunner trained on one could pretty much fire any
of them. 

As far as firing at range was concerned, it depended on the situation. 
In massed fleet actions, the lines closed to very short range and
pounded with their broadsides, but in individual ship duels there was a
case to be made for standing off and taking out your opponents masts and
sails. Of course, individual ship duels were generally between frigates
(the cruisers of the period), not SOL. I don\'t think an SOL went
anywhere on it\'s own, always part of a squadron.  During the War of
1812, the super frigate, Constitution, had great success with the
tactics of maneuver and fire at long range. It was faster than most
British frigiates (and more heavily armed as well), and her gunners were
much better shots.  The Constitution would stand off from the British
ships,  I recall that on a number of occasions there were multiple
British ships, and fire at their rigging. Once her opponents were dead
in the water she would move in closer across bow and stern raking them
with fire until they surrendered.  For our British friends here, we
American\'s are pretty proud of the Constitution\'s accomplishments, but
she was only a frigate and certainly couldn\'t have stood in a line
against your fleet.  I guess you could say she was mainly a commerce
raider who was lucky not to be caught and defeated by the overwhelming
British numerical superiority.

Under normal Traveller maneuver rules I agree with you.  This is one
reason I\'ve been toying with the idea of using "stutterwarp" STL-only
drives instead of regulation T4-thrusters or more realistic reaction
thrusters.  If you knock out a "stutterwarp" drive the ship *is* (more
or less) dead in space, and I\'ve even rationalized a way to do it that
fits in with the regular jump drive. I think I also have the
super-maneuverability "problem" presented by stutterwarp drives handled
too.

The problem with pseudo-velocity drives is, and always has been for me,
the need to include a *real-drive* so ships can match orbits with
planets, land and take off.  The candidates for that are reaction-drives
(fusion, heplar, realistic) and the low powered version of the grav
drive.  All I\'m wanting from the real-acceleration drive is something
like 30 to 50 kps delta v over a period of several hours, so a ship can
match vectors, and maybe enough thrust to get a ship up a few kilometers
so the stutterwarp can be turned on.  But this is a different topic,
isn\'t it? ;->

Of course, there are flies in the ointment -- and adventure hooks, of course.  First, in 
order for this to be cost-effective, you\'ll hire local labor at slightly higher than the 
prevailing wage to build the roads and do all of the other dangerous and dirty work.  
The wage differential will guarantee that you\'ll get employees, but it will also 
slightly destabilize the local culture (as will your major offworld presence in other 
ways).  

You\'ll have to relocate some local populations that are in the way, and you\'ll use local 
forces to do so.  The local forces will of course use too much force; that\'s where their 
job satisfaction comes from.  That\'s ok with you, because then you can pay them less.  
Maybe there is a local political dispute about who actually owns that particular place 
where you\'re putting your particular infrastructural element.  

Some of the employees or their kids will get higher educations with those higher wages 
before the government taxes them back into submission, and they\'ll have all sorts of 
ideas about organizing labor and changing the status quo.

The government will see this as a great opportunity to get rich for doing nothing but 
signing papers.  It will insist on cash payments for other projects to be carried out, 
or to pay your local laborers, or for licensing fees or building permit fees or 
whatever, and will skim off as much as the government skimmers can skim.  The offworld 
money will go to offworld banks as quickly as ships can carry it.

This situation will become well known to the ordinary people, who will see themselves 
remaining in poverty while the governing class gets rich -- although actually the lot of 
the ordinary people will be improving dramatically.  The rise of their expectations 
faster than their conditions actually improve will be the real destabilizing force.  
Soon, you\'ll have a civil war and the PCs will be caught in the middle, scrambling for 
their sidearms and trying to protect the local spouses that they\'ve been shacking up 
with from the mob.  Hmm ... I\'m getting to like Milieu 0 more and more.

Named after a chap named (if I recall correctly) Carron, who invented them.
(A "cannonade" is a hybrid - shorter than a real cannon, lighter than a 
carronade - that never really worked very well; used on merchant ships, 
I believe.)

Unfortunately, if you think about it, fusion bolts travel far too slowly to
hit evading targets in space (hit probability against an evading target
goes as weapon velocity to the 4th power - at tens of km/s, fusion guns
loose too badly.) It\'s a pity - fusion guns were colorful - but xray lasers
will have to fill the same niche.

Here is where the analogy breaks down.  The specialized parts and equipment
required to significantly rebuild a battle damaged ship is generally beyond
the capability of teh shops and equipment carried onboard a ship - and
should be (by cannon); otherwise, any twit class D world could (and should)
be capable of producing starships.  A better analogy would be naval craft
from say 1900 on - equipment on board can fix or patch somethings, but major
component replacement needs a shipyard.

Here again, the analogy breaks as the amount of systems you replace goes up
(and I believe Starships are a lot more complex than sailing ships), teh
effort required to rebuild teh ship makes capture... less economically
useful.  And the weapons requried to hurt an exemy vessel do too much damage
to make capture useful...

Losing people that don\'t have teh curve of teh earth to hide around is

Boy have you a bit to learn...

1. "Crossing the T" was WWI batleship tactics designed to have you entire
battleline run in front of the enemy\'s line, bringing to bear you entire
combined broadsides (and smashing his front ships) while he can only answer
with his forward-pointing turrets, and then only with his front fwe ships.

"Raking" was the napoleonic era ship tactic of running across teh opponent\'s
stern or bow and unloading your boradside, sending balls coursing down teh
entire length of the enemy\'s gundeck.

2. The "weather gauge" (being upwind) meant that you could choose how and
when to swoop down on your enemy - or force him to slowly reach or beat
upwind to get at you while you can keep your broadside pointed back at him
(throwing more cannonballs at him than he throws at you).
 
Frankly, in a game where a turn = 30 minutes and most maneuvering is nearly
ineffective, this kind of maneuvering has no bearing, again breaking the
analogy.

Convoys were used frequently by many countries in the napoleonic era, since
it was the most cost effective way to protect merchantmen while carrying out
military duties.
Usually, teh convoys were rather rough affairs, mostly the merchies going in
the same direction within fairly spread area and a few warships trying to
keep them together and zipping about to frighten off privateers when needed.

Actually, I have a weapon that will beup on my weapons page (coming the next
day or two) that is a shaped charge with a sensor that only detonates
against soft targets.  It won\'t breach a wall, but it will splatter a Vacc
Suit..

Very nasty indeed...

Traveller Ship Designs?

My fellow Travelers:

I don\'t know if it is my perception of the way SSDS and QSDS are written or is there a serious problem here with fuel consumption?

1-	In QSDS it states that a ship will use fuel equal to 10% of its Displacement tonnes (Dt) 
	for each parsec jumped. This means that a 100 Displacement tonne ship will use 
	10 Dt of fuel for each parsec traveled. If you have a jump 2 capability this means that 
	you need 20 Dt of fuel on board your ship. 

	In SSDS this is stated in cubic meters per parsec jumped, which when divided by 14
	equals the same thing.
	
	Now, in SSDS you maneuver engines have a fuel consumption rating that is not taken 
	into account in QSDS. For the same ship with a maneuver of 2G the consumption is 
	0.70 cubic meters per hour, for a fusion drive, and 25 cubic meters per hour ,  for a 
	HEPlaR drive.

2-	If, let us say, that you have a 100 Dt Scout ship, and you have to explore a system that is 
	two parsecs away from any system that has either a Gas Giant or a planet that has 
	water , or a High Port. And let us say that there is little or no information available to you 
	about the system that you are to explore. 

	Therefore you cannot accurately plot where in the target system would put you 
	within either 2,000 solar radii (whatever that is) to be able to use Thrust Plate 
	technology nor 10 planetary diameters to use ContraGravity tech. 
	
	If you cannot plot to be able use either of these technologies, then you will require a 
	second maneuver drive system, either HEPlaR or Fusion.

3-	Now, let us say that the above ship has two different types of maneuver drives.

	OK. You plot what you think is a reasonable plot and jump. OOPS, somehow you have 
	miss jumped. You are in the wrong parsec, there is nothing in this parsec and your 
	Astrogator tells you that the nearest system is two parsecs away. How are you
	going to get home? It will take 6.52 years for a radio message to reach the closed 
	system.

4-	Most ship designs do not have, given the current design guide lines, enough hull
	capacity to hold the fuel to handle an additional  two parsec jump plus fuel for the
	maneuver drives.

5- 	If the guide lines were changed from 10% of the Dt, or Volume to 1%, any current ship
	design would be able to handle such an emergency with ease, which given the finality
	of the above case, seems most desirable.

Your thoughts, please.

        Interesting one.  However, let\'s not forget that Mandarin is not
the only Chinese dialect.  There are literally dozens; Putonghua and
Cantonese and Shanghainese and the list goes on.  Of the bunch, Mandarin is
the easiest to learn, AFAIK, only four tones as compared to anywhere from 8
to 12 or so for Cantonese depending on who you believe.  It\'s apparently a
very refined and courtly dialect, and has been the common language of the
Imperial bureaucracy from (I think) the Ming Dynasty straight up to the
currently tottering Mao Dynasty.  However, the situation in China is that
they have to subtitle films (the characters are shared among the various
dialects) in order for them to be accessible to Chinese of all dialects.
Mandarin is far from universal.

        As well, from an Asian business perspective, if there\'s a lingua
franca on the Pacific Rim, it\'s English.  The Chinese when dealing with the
Japanese would rather die than speak Japanese, and vice versa for the
Japanese. English is simply the most widely spoken second language around
out there.  And, let\'s not forget, it\'s the international language of ATC,
lends itself extremely well to creolization, is fairly easily learned and
so forth.  I suspect that in 300 years or so, it won\'t have lost any of its
currency as a trade language.

        This doesn\'t mean that the Chinese, as well as the French, German,
African, Latin American, Indian, etc, etc, etc Solomani would not have had
significant influence in terms of vocabulary on Galanglic; it\'s just that
the common language, the second or third language spoken by most of them,
would probably be English, and this would, I think, be the skeleton that
bits of the Vilani and other Solomani languages would be grafted onto to
make that lumbering beast Galanglic.

Perhaps in your universe, but not in mine.

IMU, a starship capable of wilderness refuelling can operate indefinately
as long as there is a ready supply of food and water. (and gas giants or
oceans :-)

WRT battle damage, well, it depends.

WRT annual maintenance, it depends on how often you want to misjump. ;-) 

I use the basic power plant endurance as an indication of the ship\'s 
endurance. In CT, about one month. In T4, about one year.

You know, now that you mention it, Leonard, a lot of Vilani looks strangely
like it\'s related to the languages of the \'Fertile Crescent\'. Akkadian,
Babylonian, Sumerian. They all basically used the same pantheon structure
and each civ. borrowed heavily off the previous one. I wonder if you haven\'t
unlocked the secret to Vilani. :)

Not intending to jump on Anders post here, but it is bringing up that slight
metallic taste in the back of my throat and I figured I\'d better say
something before I really lost it.

Recently I\'ve noticed a number of posts about the lack of Traveller-ness in
TNE, or how un-Traveller TNE was.

I\'m sorry, but this annoys me.  Why is it that even with the coming of T4,
people still find it necessary to condemn TNE?  It bothers me.

Let me apologize to Anders before he thinks I\'m picking on him, but his post
was just the most recent.

I DO NOT WANT TO STAR ANY ARGUEMENTS AS TO WHETHER TNE IS OR IS NOT TRAVELLER!!!

TNE may not be Traveller to some of you, that\'s fine, I can accept that.  To
me, CT is not Traveller enough for me, and MT barely so.  Before the cries
of Sacralige come to me, let me explain.

I did not have the privelege of growing up in an enlightened household.  My
parents saw Role Playing games as evil and I was not allowed to play them.
Sure I still did, but not nearly as much as I wanted to.  I played maybe 2-3
games before college.  Then in college (spring 1989) I got in with a group
that played MT and RoleMaster.  After that semester, I didn\'t get to play
any until years later, just after I got married in 1992.  It was then that I
bought and reffed TNE games for  some friends.

Now I am very sorry that I didn\'t get into Traveller in 77 when it was
introduced.  I really wish I had been given that opportunity, but that
didn\'t happen, and I\'ve made the most of what I did have, and that was TNE.
To me, TNE is Traveller, but other than an occasional post like this, I
don\'t shove it into everyones face.  Nor do I put down CT or MT because I
know there are people here who don\'t like TNE but really enjoy CT and/or MT.

Am I asking for you to like TNE?  NO!  Absolutely not.  I hope Marc likes
the setting enough to keep it around eventually, but for now, I\'ll work with
what I\'ve got and with T4 (which I find very Traveller BTW).  I like TNE,
and all I am asking is that we try to continue to get along and not Bash
each other\'s games.

Thank you for your time and I\'m sorry for the length of this post.  I am
also sorry if anyone takes this in the wrong tone.  It is not meant to be a
condemnation of anyone, just a simple request with an explanation.

But Colin, you misunderstand. Terra\'s gravitational pull is 9.8m/s.  A G in
Traveller is defined as 10m/s...and as all Syleans know *our* gravitational
pull is 10m/s! ;-D

Now the Astronomical Unit (AU), is another subject!  Instead of measuring
in-system distances in the terracentric AU why don\'t we use the more
universal light second (LS)?  We already use .1LS in range and movement
calculations for space combat, so we are already half way there.  And while
we\'re at it, let\'s use the Sylean kilometer for measurement so the LS will
be exactly 300,000kps rather than the 298,XXX of the terran kilometer!

   True, I was thinking in terms of fishing for pleasure or sport, not
so much for survival (though it could be used for that).

   I think the assumption was that the controls for all Heavy Artillery
are pretty much the same regardless of tech level (insert/mount round,
adjust for bearing and distance, push button--or in the case of a
mortar, adjust for bearing and distance, drop round down tube, keep
hands clear of tube mouth).  True, howitzers also need powder charges,
but then mass drivers need to have energy inputs adjusted, and rockets
and missiles need fins mounted, etc.  Adjusting between the different
procedures shouldn\'t take much effort.

   Also, Heavy Weapons does cascade to Autogun, Heavy Guns, Energy
Artillery, Grenade Launcher, and Tac Missile.  This might not be what
you were commenting on, but there it is....

you\'re getting (too few), simply make Special Assignment automatic each
term.  The result is a better balanced character.

   As for the other skills I chose to add, Gunsmith and Fishing are
direct imports from Twilight:2000, updated for TNE.  Scrounging also
comes from T:2000, but is somewhat modified.  Security is a new skill,
and I thought it was appropriate given that there really isn\'t a skill
in Traveller that deals with the issue (despite the fact that player
characters are constantly being hired for such duty).

>Making a character that is adept at _something_ should be possible 
>without too much one dimensioning of skills going on.

   OK, let\'s say then that Electronics is the applicable skill for
installing infrared sensors.  How does an electronics expert know where
the best place to put them is?  My impression has always been that
someone skilled at Electronics knows just that--Electronics.  He or she
probably doesn\'t know beans about what constitutes the best place to
install a sensor to provide the maximum protection for an installation
(the answer isn\'t always next to the front door).  An infantry soldier
knows all kinds of things about perimeter security--for his infantry
platoon.  But he probably isn\'t up to speed on the most likely places a
terrorist will plant a bomb.  For both reasons and others I felt a new
skill was in order.  You could argue that Security shouldn\'t cascade,
but I felt that there was enough of a difference between Physical
Security and Anti-Terrorism that a cascade was justified.

   As for Scrounging, it seemed to me that poking around ruins and
talking to natives about them could become a skill all its own, in much
the same way that Streetwise is.  It is a skill that could also come in
handy in Milieu Zero, though I\'m afraid that with ruins as old as the
ones from the Second Imperium are in that era, you may be better off in
most cases with Archeology.

   My goal is to add another aspect to the game, not make characters who
end up with skills that read something like: Vehicle (Ground Car,
Hydrocarbon-powered, Automatic Transmission, Power Steering, Anti-lock
Brakes)-1, Research (Computer-based, GUI Interface, Color Monitor,
Standard American English Text)-3, Research (Book-based, Standard
American English Text)-2.

Now that it seems that a truly revised T4 edition might be possible (is
there already any definite word on this) and that Marc Miller and Derek
"Wildstar" might get together to rework the basic ship design rules I\'d
really would like to put some points to discussion that I did not see
before.

Disclaimer: I was not on this list when MM took over and therefor I do
not know if this was discussed at that point.  I sadly don\'t have enough
time right now to read the old log files and anyways believe that it might
be agood time to discuss this again.  I\'m also new to Traveller (but a
long-time roleplayer), I own *many* (read: more than 100) roleplaying
games and have spent a lot of time tinkering with designs in general and
pondering the philosophy of roleplaying mechanics.

[Comment: since this is a pretty long text, pease skip to the last parts
if you get tired of my line of reasoning at some point -- I\'d really like
to see some discussion on this and my last comments in this text are a
base to start from]

Now that the stage is prepared...

<climbs his soapbox>

What I\'m asking for is a ship design system that is a *lot* simpler than
QSDS (and SSDS especially).  Theere are several reasons for this (and
from now on I\'ll just refer to QSDS since SSDS really is only for
gearheads):

1. The T4 rules as a whole: they are very simple (in some parts
simplistic)  rules.  Take a look at skills: most of them are in the 1-5
range.  Take a look at attributes: most are in the 5 to 10 range, Take a
look at the combat system: weapons do from 2 to 7 dice of damage (most are
in the 2-4D range), armor absorbs some of that (again mostly in the 1-3
range).  Weapon ranges are handled by abstract range bands.  To sum this
up: the basic system of T4 is *very* simple, very easy to understand and
pretty abstract for a so-called "hard SF" game.  QSDS in comparison has
lots of tables, *requires* a pocket calculator, uses fractional numbers
and is easiest to use with a spreadsheet.  Notice the difference? 

If there ever is a weapon design system created for T4 there also would be
no reason to use FF&S as a base.  It just makes no sense design-wise to
juggle with formulae and lots of tables just to convert all the numbers to
a range of 2-7 and "short" to "extreme"; e.g. in my opinion a weapon
design system for T4 should run along the lines of: small weapon: 2D,
medium weapon: 3D, large weapon: 4D; very powerful weapon: +1D, killer
ammunition: +1D; adjust as necessary (and some similar system for weapon
ranges).  *That* would be in line with the current rules.  If you feel to
add something more difficult you can do it in a supplement.


2. Goal #1 as stated by MM himself: "A return to the simpler strucure of
Classic Traveller while allowing multiple levels of complexity depending
on he needs and interests of individual players and referees."  This
simply does *not* show in the ship design rules.  There are exactly two
levels of complexity: a design process of medium complexity (QSDS) and a
complex design process (SSDS); FF&S probably would rate as *very* complex. 
Where is the simple layer I ask?  I paged through the copy of Classic
Traveller I purchased and I really believe that T4 is still in need of
some system similar to the ship design process in those rules.  They were
short, they were elegant and you didn\'t need a pocket calculator to use
them.  And such a system needs to be in the *basic* rules.  A system that
requires a pocket calculator is *not* simple. 

(watching the list makes me believe that many others seem to think so,
too, but don\'t voice their opinion: look at what is discussed.  People
like to talk about the background, people were eager to provide fixes for
the "broken" task system... and lots of them; starships are only posted
every once in a while and they don\'t receive many comments [and I don\'t
refer to the casual "Starships" bashing we all engage in at times];
most people don\'t seem to enjoy getting involved in this).


3. Playability: as I grow older (heck, I\'m still one of the youngest
members on this list with my 25 years) Real Life(tm) more and more takes
away from ones free time.  Getting a job and having a life does such thing
to ones schedule.  I no longer have the time to sit down for many hours
just to construct one or two starships.  I have a life, I have a
girlfriend that wants some attention (and rightly so ;-), I have other
hobbies... the point being: I believe that there are many other people out
there like me and they really *deserve* a system that allows for quick
designs in about 10 minutes.  Needing spreadsheets, endless tables, a
calculator or whatever really is a sign for having a lot of free time on
once hands.  This is not true for everyone.


4. Appeal to new players: this is directly related to #3.  Take a look at
the type of games successful these days.  Most of them are designed around
easy-of-use and the "you can understand me in 3 minutes" principle or
rather KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).  The average attention span of new
gamers seems to be lower than it was 10 years (or 20!) ago.  Therefor T4
really needs a simple ship design system since the rest of the basic
system is already *very* simple (once the editing improves; I\'m hoping the
best for the deluxe edition of the T4 rules and I\'m willing to pay once
more in good belief).

This does not mean that the system has no room for more complex systems
like QSDS or SSDS - they just belong in separate supplements.


5. Realism: You don\'t create a realistic game by using endless columns of
mind-boggling numbers.  To have a realistic feel you need a stream-lined
and internally consistent system.  This can be a very simple system like
CT or it can be a very complex system (I won\'t say like FF&S since I
personally -- after long thought -- don\'t believe that it was realistic in
any way... it was simply complex and cumbersome).  Really think about
this: what guarantee for realism do all these numbers provide?  None.
There are lots of them but there is next to no foundation in reality for
all the jump drive related stuff.  As far as I can see the only things
related to real science are the formulae used to determine volume, etc.

Just look at Rolemaster for comparison: there are endless tables and
thousands of numbers and still the game is not overly realistic.  Despite
the cumbersome it\'s not even possible to make called shots without fudging
the rules.

If you feel the need for a complex system put it into a separate
supplement.


6. System integration: examine the rest of the starship related systems in
T4: the combat system is very simple (maybe a little too simple), the
travel rules are pretty simple -- in comparison QSDS is *very* complex
(note that I said *in comparison*).  This shows a certain discrepancy
which should not show up in a well-designed and well-integrated system.
As an example I can quote the typical Greg Porter rules system (e.g. CORPS
2nd edition).  The rules are very well-integrated, they all use the same
basic system and they all use the same *philosophy*.  In T4 this still
mostly is a patchwork.  As someone said on rec.games.frp.misc: "Greg
Porter seems to be the last *real* designer.".  This is *not* a flame or
an insult at MM (please don\'t read it this way), just the observation that
Greg Porter obviously put a lot more work and a lot more thought into what
he did.

Given the circumstances of the birth of T4 this was not possible but *now*
there is the chance... probably the last one.  Don\'t miss it.


7. The final opportunity: people complained about several things being
broken in T4.  This is probably the best time to fix it.  The revised
rules could go into the deluxe edition and they also could be used in the
next standard printing.  If you want to fix things, do it *now*.  In two
years you no longer will have the chance to do it, since by then the
system will either be dead or established (hopefully the last).  At that
point you\'ll only aggravate folks by suddenly changing core mechanics.
Now you can do it and build upon that.  Consider this, too.



To come to an end (yes, finally ;-) -- what I\'d really like to see are the
following things:

A. A much simpler ship design system in the basic rules (similar to CT but
with more options).  I don\'t own any of the other rules systems so I can\'t
comment them but the CT system nicely fits into the rest of T4 -- it just
could need more options and some more ship sizes.

B. A starship supplement with both QSDS and SSDS.  You\'d start out with
QSDS as an intermediate level system and then could add detail in all
areas involved.  This would be in line with goal #1 as stated by MM and it
would really allow players to customize the system to their taste.

C. Comments on this (especially from Marc Miller since he is [or at least
*should* be] the driving force behind the general design -- Joe, if he
doesn\'t make up his mind about this publicly, please nudge him into it --
I really believe that this is important ;-).  I\'d also like to see *a lot*
of comments from the members of this list


The bottom line of all this is: if someone would like me to get involved
in designing a *truly* simple ship design system (be that Derek, be that
MM :-) I\'d really be willing to help with this.  My diploma thesis is
nearly completed and I\'ll soon have quite some free time on my hands (at
least for a couple of months).  I know can decide whether I\'d like to
spend most of that time with Chivalry & Sorcery 3rd Edition or with a
revision of the T4 ship design process.  I\'d really like to help out (and
if it\'s just to be able to say \'we tried our best\'.  I\'m really willing to
help out but I need an opportunity (and now, I won\'t start any private
efforts until I get at least some sign of "yes, this might be a worthy
attempt we are going to evaluate" -- as I mentioned: I no longer have as
much free time as I had in former years). 

Thanks for listening.

Probably true...certainly true given the canon Traveller view, but I\'m a
well-known heretic, so I don\'t pay much attention to
canon...cannons yes, canon no. ;->

In that vein let me say that we don\'t know how *bad* damage has to be
before it can\'t be repaired, and as you say.  .  .

During the steam period, most things on a ship could be patched well enough
to keep the ship going until it got to a port, and most *non-structural*
damage could be repaired in most any port if the ship\'s Engineer could
scrounge up the parts.  Certainly, 100 meter rips in the hull or massive
explosions in the boiler room could sink a ship outright, but bilge pumps
could handle a pretty big hole and keep a ship afloat as long as the
engines kept running, and boilers could be patched and gotten back online
even after pretty heavy damage.  Pipes could be repaired.  Wiring restrung. 
A ship didn\'t *have* to have a radio.  Major structural damage required a
dry dock and that\'s where a ship yard came into play.  I suspect it\'s the
equivalent of a dry dock that separates the B\'s from the C\'s and D\'s, but
port classifications are just a game artifact after all.

We don\'t know how robust a starship built 2000 years from now will be. 
Certainly, present day electronic gear is much less repairable than
mechanical components, but who\'s to say how much of the *required*
equipment on a starship is electronic, how much is mechanical, and how much
is gravitonic..and we don\'t know how
fragile (or robust) gravitic technology will be.  Leonard posted sometime
back on ideas for robust electronics equipment using some sort of hot tube
technology, so even *that* might not be too
fragile.

Maybe, probably, but not certainly.  With 2000+ years of development
starship components might be tougher, more repairable than you imagine.

Ah, now that\'s the sort of thing I\'ve drive at!  Why?  Suppose it makes
sense IN THE GAME to capture ships, because you can repair them and get
them back into action on my side.  You\'ll want a weapon that *doesn\'t* blow
the hell out of the other ship.  You\'ll want one that knocks out its drive,
silences its weapons, *encourages* its crew to surrender, but doesn\'t wreak
it completely.  What weapon is this? Laser?  PAW?  Meson?  Missile?  I
suspect it\'s none of the above, but I\'m still looking.

Sure, but there is *jump* space!  <g> If you can beat your enemy to the
jump limit you can really disappear, and if you don\'t make it easy to
follow a jumping ship it can escape.

Oh please!  <g> If by WWI you mean the Anglo-Dutch wars of the 17th century
then OK.  The  actual tactic "crossing the T" is over two hundred years
older than 1914.  Now I\'ll admit that the *term* "crossing the T" only goes
back to the late 19th century, but the basic idea is just a refinement of
raking.  It doesn\'t matter if it\'s one ship or a line that crosses an
opponents bow or stern, it\'s still"crossing your enemies "T", and it\'s
still your massed fire against his bow or stern.

Yesss, raking is firing on a column down it\'s length, to enfilade. So, if
you "cross a single ship or a line of ship\'s "T" you can "rake" them. It
applies to ground combat too.

In *your* game a turn is 30 minutes, not in *my* game!  I won\'t run a space
combat with 30 minute turns.  Joe and I talked about this while we were
designing the RPSCS.  I didn\'t like 30 minute turns then, and I don\'t like
\'em now.  

I\'m still looking for a way to reduce that to...oh say...3 minute turns. 
Yes, I\'ll have to change ship speeds, yes, I\'ll have to do something about
weapons and ranges, and no I won\'t want to deal with major fleets.  What
I\'m looking for is "Wooden Ships and Iron Men" in space, or I guess, "Star
Ships and Crystaliron Men."  ;->

We should be able, like in the olden days, to choose a level of 
complexity which suits us best, and right now, a simpler system is 
missing. Those systems (attn: Radical thought) don\'t even have to be 
fully compatible, since once a GM chooses a sstem, he will most 
likely stick with it, and having a balanced game.

My first ever ship design was something like this: 
"So there\'s this freight carrier, see? I has a laser and can make a 
Jump two and is pretty slow in combat. It can carry about 100t of 
cargoe and 15 passengers including crew!"
That was all the information the players needed at first, and on this 
basis, i was free to expand upon later on.
A ship doesn\'t have to be complex, it just is supposed to be fun.Just my 2 EuroCents,

The book reads like a Traveller alien module.  It starts off by detailing 
the formation of a double planet, describes the evolution of the sentient 
lifeforms on both worlds, their rise to civilization, and eventually to the 
point where they notice each other and make contact.  It isn\'t really a

Depends on the star.. from SSDS:

Our sun has a radius of 432,000 miles.  So a thruster equipped verssel
retains usefulness out to 864 million miles (9.29 AU), or almost to Saturn\'s
orbit.  Beyond that, you need something else, like HEPLaR.

This has some serious implications for naval combat.. all of a sudden, Terra
has *one* useful Gas Giant to defend.  The others our out in the "badlands",
where thruster equipped ships are helpless.

        I read you loud and clear, Glenn.  SO far, I haven\'t done a ship
that doesn\'t have 50-100% more fuel than required for its normal jump
range, and most have had HEPlaR auxiliary drives backing up their T-plates.
However, I decided to completely disregard the 1000 diameter limit on
T-plates in my campaign.  Thus, the HEPlar auxiliaries in my ships are
there as a) afterburners to get more acceleration, or b) in the case of my
submission to the scout ship design contest, to clear landing zones where
there\'s too much crud over the bedrock.

        Well, count me in as someone who likes SSDS.  I\'ve also been
mucking around with FF&S, and like that too.  I think that the complexities
in the design system translate into interesting quirks in the end product
that enhance the roleplaying.

        And with regard to T4, if anything I find that the combat system
could do with some extra complexity.  Recoil ratings would be nice for one;
with the standard weapons, this is probably not needed, but when you start
mucking about with autoshotguns, they\'d sure make the game a little more
interesting.  Also, better rules on autofire; I\'ve already done a house fix
on the autofire rules for an RF gauss SMG one player is packing: 5 rounds
per burst struck me as way low, so I doubled that and the damage multiplier
too.  And a hit location table like the wonderful one Glenn Grant did would
help, too.

        Other than that, good post.  I think that a Really Simple Ship
Design Sequence, so long as it retained consistency with SSDS and QSDS,
would be a really good thing to have.

Actually, raking is what one ship does to another. Crossing the T,
although it 
may be a later term, is widely used by historians to describe what
Nelson did - 
it is what one fleet does to another.

Perhaps we could introduce a combat system with shorter turns in which 
maneuver is important. Like everything else about Traveller, it should 
be modified by players and gamemasters when it does not meet their
needs.

Hey, heresy is great! 

Anyway, have you considered using Ironclads as a model - it provides a

Bravo, Paul. I too am tired of the TNE bashing. People don\'t realize that
there are folks on here who get involved with Traveller in the first place
because of TNE. Like it or not, TNE happened.

>I DO NOT WANT TO STAR ANY ARGUEMENTS AS TO WHETHER TNE IS OR IS NOT
TRAVELLER!!!

You may not, but I do. Here\'s my opinion (keeping in mind the old Hiver
adage "opinions are like colaca\'s; everyone has one"):

1.) In terms of the rules systems, yes, TNE was not Traveller,although the
GDW House system did use some elements of Traveller. It was the T:2000
system and therefore was probably not the best choice for Traveller.

2.) In terms of the BACKGROUND (and leaving aside the issue of the viability
of Virus), it was every bit as Traveller as anything else that\'s been done.
yes, there were flaws, such as Short Nap that was way too short. But I
enjoyed (and still enjoy) the RC setting when it is run with the proper
emphasis. I don\'t care for military settings anyway, which is why I don\'t
give a rat\'s ass about ships above 5000 tons. I ran my RCES campaign as a
Scout Service with teeth, which is what I think was originally intended anyway.

3.) The Virus Era (as it\'s now being called) may undergo revision, but it\'s
here to stay. You\'re free to ignore it of course, but that puts you in the
category of folks who still believe the Earth to be flat. It isn\'t going
away. Deal with it.

In my opinion (flameproof suit on); for a list which is about an RPG, there
are an awful lot of imagination-impaired people on here.

As a non-space gearhead, let me say that while I like having detailed
starships that I can describe in "real world" terms, Having QSDS around is
nice for me when i just need another pirate ship or whatever.  The more
advanced design sequences come into play when I think of what a friend who
is a merchant marine engineer told me:

"There are no two identical ships afloat anywhere in the world.  They have
all been modified from the day their keels were laid."

I\'ve been mucking about with T4 combat myself.. If you look at 3G3 Greg has
seperated Penetration and damge again.  3G3 actually has a couple of nice
fixes tucked into the conversion notes.  My weapon pages (coming soon! I
hate doing tables in HTML!  Help!) will include Signature and Recoil,
although I\'m just going to use Low, Med, High ala MT..

Since I do my own weapons (Greg, am I plugging 3G3 enough?) I use the damage
of individual pellets of a shotgun attack as seperate attack at anything
beyond Very Short range.  Auto-Shotguns are therefore a form of extreme
nastiness, and to be encouraged as ship defence weapons.

Another thing I\'ve stolen is Cyberpunk: 2020\'s three-round burst rule:  +2
to hit, roll 1d6/2 for the number of rounds that hit.  "Double tapping" a
pistol; make one to-hit roll at +1 level of difficulty.  If sucessful, the
rounds count as one attack for purposes of damage.  (Picture double-tapping
with the -9 triple damage roll and making it..  10.5x2=21 points for the
d-t, x3 for the triple damage.. 63 points of hurt in one shot.  Ouch.)

I\'m not overly enamored of hit location tables. They seem to slow things
down a bit.. YMMV.

As the thruster plates push against a gravity well, it would imply
that the thrusters also would work outside the stellar radii limit,
but close to a planet. Probably limited to a few hundred diameters.

I *hate* to get into this but it\'s been annoying me for some time.  I\'m
sorry to say that I have to support Michael T. Richter as far as his
complaints go (yes, he could be a lot more polite but others started
yelling, too): he basically (if you get past all the flame stuff)
complainging about several broken T4 mechanics and he is *right* about
that.  He basically states that they are broken *as presented* in the
rules and he\'s right about this.  You up to now (from what I have read)
only stated that the GM can fix it and you are *right* about that.

Since I\'d like to prevent the TML from becoming yet another battleground
I\'d propose to continue all further discussion about this via email.

population were taken from Terra by the Ancients three hundred thousand
years ago, there sure weren\'t any Assyrians running around back then.
Coincidence, I figure...

Speaking of Vilani, does anyone on the list know of Traveler linguistic
material that\'s been created?  Either canonically or privately?  Is anyone
*interested* in this subject?  I am -- in Vilani and/or Zhodani, at least.
Traveler, with all its hard-science feel, is pretty soft on the
socio-cultural side of things -- we shouldn\'t let those lumpy-browed
Klingons get all the attention for having their own language <G>.

I\'ll try to shut up about TNE\'s unworthiness from now on.

Still, are there anybody out there that know about CT, MT based fiction. I
think the one or other of the Keiths write under pseudonym and also that
John M Ford has written some fiction. Finally, you gearheads out there;
take a look at GURPS Vehicles 2:ed. It is by far the best design system for
anything BUT starships and guns.
Also very good rules for using the vehicles.

One BIG problem with FF&S and MT design system was that all those
interesting details that were put into a design was then abstracted away
into something like "add TL to the number of sensors and divide by 2"
If there is a sensor, gadget and whatnot in the design system there should
be rules for it.

Uhh, Thomas, you just did it...that\'s part of the GM\'s job. If all the
detail your players want or need, just tell \'em that: they have a small
freighter, jump 2, a laser battery and 100 tons capacity. There is no need
for a \'design\' system rewrite.  However, I don\'t think that QSDS needs to
be taken out of the main rulebook. Cleaned up, with design examples, yes,
but removed? No , not at all. Just because YOU like a minimalist approach
does not mean that that is all that should be offered...this isn\'t a
personal flame, just an observation. Given the state of RPG\'s today, a
simple, minimalist approach, like the original CT will vanish from the
marketplace in a hurry. People just don\'t seem to tolerate LBB\'s anymore.

At the risk of sounding like a scratched record, a scratched record, a
scratched record...

The rules are what you make of them, the rules are not a straightjacket,
the rules are to be discarded as you like.

Starships, (from what I\'ve heard...I haven\'t even looked at it yet) was
badly flawed. what it should have been was a large compendium of
predesigned ships for GM\'s like you who don\'t want to bother with
designing ships, as well as a more detailed system than that in the main
rulebook, ie: it should have included SSDS. The flaws were more in
execution than conception. This would have, at least partially, made
everyone, gearhead and non gearhead alike happy, which is what you have to
do in producing an RPG that will survive: make the greatest number of your
customers as happy as you can.  This necessitates some compromises.

You don\'t like, or want formulas. Fine, you truly don\'t need to use them
to play the game, AS WRITTEN. You do want formulas for everything. Fine
you can use them by the rules AS WRITTEN(at least whenever FFS II,whatever
it\'s called) comes out. That\'s the beauty of a \'object-oriented\' game
system, like the qsds/ssds/ffs sequence.

	If you can\'t do that, then the rules need to be fixed, but I for
one, would prefer a system with scaled complexity; sooner or later my
players are going to ask, just how long that little freighter is, and what
are the dimensions of the cargo hold, and how fast can the run from the
bridge to the engine room, for which I need the detail provided by
qsds/ssds/ffs.

get a discount on items 6 or 7.  Are these shipping costs realistic?
It\'s more than 50% the price of some of the books.

It seems that a fairer system would be x% of total price or some minimum

items separately, do they? 

I don\'t think I\'ll be ordering anything from them anytime soon.  It\'s too
bad none of the local stores carry T4.  

Joe (Walsh), perhaps you can answer this (or get information).  I already
tried emailing IG, but haven\'t heard back.  I\'m looking for the name of
Canadian distributors who carry T4.  This is part of my efforts to get the
somewhat clueless local hobby stores to pick up the game.

That would probably be "First Cycle", from a manuscript by H. Beam Piper,
"edited and expanded" by Michael Kurland.  My Ace paperback is (c) 1982,
so it fits your timeline perfectly.

assuming the same rule holds true.. the thrusters would work out to about
2000 planetary radii, you still have a serious problem.  Lets put an invader
fleet around Saturn, using thrusters.  Saturn\'s radius is 35,500 miles,
giving us a "thruster horizon" of 71 million miles.  The invader fleet is
contained in a sphere of about 1.5x10^24 cubic miles, which compared to the
area reachable from Jupiter (inside the Sun\'s t-horizon) is immense.
(2.7x10^27 cu miles, if I\'m using my calclator correctly.. 1.8 million times
as large as Saturn.)

That fleet is going to be bottled up in a convienent location for the locals
to launch strikes against.. the Invaders can\'t cut and run unless they can
jump, since anyone going \'over the edge" and out of the t-horizon will becom
a nice ballastic target for long-range pot shots.

 NO!  DON\'T DO IT!  Twenty years of Traveller is too much to
 sacrifice for one small missed observation!  I\'m sure that even
 Stephen Hawking, Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and
 (dare I even think it?) Bill Gates (yup, I dare - in a
 microsecond!) have all missed obvious things - they didn\'t pack
 it in!  Don\'t set penance for yourself; you\'ll be too hard on

 For _this_, I think you\'d better visit the \'fresher and wash
 your mouth out with soap.  Yes, we have some in there, along
 with real water; the sonics are on the fritz at the moment.

 Mentioning _that_ product, or in fact any product by _that_
 company, Feh!  On _this_ list, double Feh!

 \'sides, I missed that connection, too - I made the "Baker"
 connection instead - "Miller" didn\'t seem to me to do _enough_
 to turn crude Vilani vegetables into something edible, and I
 know that even on Terra, there are some vegetables that just
 have to be _cooked_ to be eaten (ever try raw asparagus or
 Bruxelles sprouts?  Worse than cooked, and that says
 something).

Neither. AFAIR, in all past and present versions of Traveller,
fuel carried usually defaults to basically one maximum range
Jump plus enough fuel to get to/from the Jump point in both the
star system of origination and the destination star system.
If a ship misjumps to deep space while using up all its Jump
juice, its crew pretty much is dead because whatever fuel is
left probably (but not always) isn\'t enough to allow any
cold berths onboard (if any) to be powered until the ship
drifts into another star system.

It\'s virtually impossible to have a high Jump-/Maneuver-rated
ship because of the fuel constraints.

Yes! A great series for running a team of Special Ops characters
and also development of character personalities.

OK, I\'ll ask:

Simpler HOW?

QSDS\'s design goals were:
1) To require nothing more complex than a pencil and a single sheet of
   paper to design a starship, and
2) To enable a first-time user to be able to design a complete starship
   in under an hour, and an experienced user to be able to design a
   ship in less than half that time.
3) To be reasonably accurate (within 5% of the "correct" values).

I\'d love to hear feedback from people who\'ve used it to design ships.  How
long does it take, and which steps are the hardest, most time-consuming, or
most confusing?

> QSDS in comparison has lots of tables, *requires* a pocket calculator,
> uses fractional numbers and is easiest to use with a spreadsheet.

OK, I\'ll grant you that it has a lot of tables.  But requires a calculator?
WHY?  I designed the system so that there are only three steps that require
multiplication (*); all the rest is addition.  What steps do you feel
require a calculator, and what sort of spreadsheet have you been using?
What operations does the spreadsheet automate?

* They are:
1) Jump Drive fuel.  Jump Drive fuel is given as a percentage of the total
   ship volume; you have to multiply by the ships volume to figure the
   jump drive fuel in tons.
2) Cabins.  You have to multiply the size and cost (and, for very large
   ships, power requirement) of cabins by the number of crew to be housed.
3) Workstations.  You have to multiply the size and cost (and, for very
   large ships, the power requrement) of a workstation by the number of
   crew that require workstations.
These involve multiplying decimal numbers; it\'s approximately middle-school
arithmetic (6th or 7th grade level).  That\'s it.  Everything else is adding
up columns of decimal numbers, and requires elementary-school arithmetic.

10 Minutes, hmmm ... well, it\'s a goal.  Once you\'ve got six or eight
designs done, QSDS should take about 15 minutes (20 minutes if you\'ve got to
use the horribly dis-arranged tables that IG printed; get a new copy from my
Web site; it\'s much better organized).

> "Greg Porter seems to be the last *real* designer.".

I have a lot of respect for Greg\'s abilities, and I have yet to see a game
or suppliment from him that I\'ve been dissapointed with.  However, I don\'t
think the fine art of game design is _quite_ dead yet; Steve Jackson is also
still out there, publishing good stuff.

That was the design intent of QSDS.  What items in QSDS do you feel are too
complex, or provide needless detail?

> Does anyone know how you figure out what the dif
> between laser bays and normal turrets? As it is, there ain\'t one!

Laser bays are much larger (50 displacement tons, versus 3 or 6 for
turret lasers).  Bays can traverse to track targets, but the arc is more
limited than turrets.  Since the T4 basic combat system doesn\'t provide
rules for firing arcs, this feature can\'t be simulated with it.

The optional (and, IMHO, highly recommended) Role-Playing Ship Combat System
does feature firing arcs.  In that game, turrets have a 360-degree arc of
fire, while bays have 180 or 240 degree arcs (depending on where they are
locaed on the ship).  Bays are also much more powerful weapons. 

Example: A TL-12 light laser turret rates at 3-2-0-0 (if at ROF 100); a
batery of 10 of these weapons rates 7-5-3-2 (again at ROF 100).  A TL-12
laser bay rates 3-3-3-2 at ROF 100 or 6-6-6-5 at ROF 800.

Note, however, that lasers aren\'t large weapons; it\'s only at low TLs do
laser bays enjoy a large advantage over turrets.  Because there is a limit
to the power-handling ability of lasers, some of the large laser turrets at
TL-13 and higher are as powerful as the bays.  The tables in SSDS don\'t
carry lasers below TL-11 (at TL-10 and below, bays are about the only way to
mount an effective laser weapon on a starship).

> And, for that matter, how do you calculate the factor of multiple lasers?
> the way it is worded, if I have 10 factor 2 lasers, I make a battery of
> 20 damage (why bother with bays, and spinal mounts for that matter)

The instructions for converting multiple-weapon batteries into USD codes is
wrong in _Starships_ (specifically, you get the problem noted above).  Here
is the correct rule:

1) Turret weapons can be grouped into batteries for increased fire-power.
   Each battery may have up to 10 weapons, and MUST be controlled by a
   Master Fire Director.

2) To determine the base USD factor of the battery, determine the damage of
   a single weapon (this is the last number, after the dash) at the ranges
   10, 20, 40, and 80 (these are standard for T4 basic starship combat).
   The range number is the first number, in front of the colon.

   Example: A TL-11 light laser turret is rated at
   5:1/7-21 10:1/5-15 20:1/2-7 40:1/1-4
   We can ignore the fractions, and then determine the ratings at the
   standard ranges:
   10:15 20:7 40:4 80:0
   Since the we will work with the standard ranges from here on, we\'ll
   drop the range numbers (and show only the damage, as 15-7-4-0).

3) We NOW multiply the damage values by the number of weapons in the
   battery.
   
   Example: A 1-weapon battery of a single TL-11 light laser has damage
   values of 15-7-4-0.  A 10-weapon battery is 150-70-40-0.

4) Use the USD conversion chart in SSDS to convert these damage values
    to USD codes.

   Example: a single TL-11 light laser converts to 0-0-0-0.  A battery
   of 10 TL-11 light lasers converts to 4-2-2-0.

5) Modify the damage value by the ROF of the weapon, to produce the final
   damage value.
   USD code.  Codes of 0 remain 0, no matter what the ROF is.
	ROF	Modifier
	10	-1
	50	 0
	100	+1
	200	+2
	400	+3
	800	+4

   Examples: a single TL-11 light laser is useless no matter what ROF
   it fires at, the USD remains 0-0-0-0.  A battery of 10 TL-11 light
   lasers, when firing at ROF 100, has a final USD of 5-3-3-0; if run at
   ROF 10, it has a USD of 3-1-1-0.

   NOTE: All lasers in SSDS have a listed ROF.  Any laser can be used at
   any ROF lower than the value listed (reduce the power input requirement
   proportionally to the ROF reduction - for example, if you run a ROF
   800 laser at ROF 400, it will use only half the power listed in the
   table; all other values are unchanged).
   Any laser with a ROF less than 100 may be used at up to ROF 100, by
   providing more power.  Therefore, laser turrets with a listed ROF of 10
   may be run at ROF 50 for 5 times the listed power consumption, and ROF
   100 for 10 times the listed power consumption.

        Here, as promised, is the second instalment in our T4 campaign.
Festivities this week got off to a slow start as Ross had to work late and
another player couldn\'t make it, but the bunch of maniacs that I have the
misfortune to referee soon made up for the delay.

THE CAST:

Isaac Xyroli: a young, brash, and arrogant ex-Scout, currently working for
Ling Standard as pilot on the Frozen Glory, a FSY Mouffette-Rapide class
far courier.  Played by the TML\'s own Ross Coburn.

Leemcha Quo: Ascetic no-nonsense 35-year-old Asian/Vilani ex-Navy
Astrogator.  Carries a pair of FSMOMAE Gunchaku-2000\'s (description to
follow) in her luggage.  Played by a non-TMLer.

Dr. Ilbren Dinaskir: A Vilani archaeologist of humble origins, specializing
in the Rule-of-Man period, who rose to his present recently tenured
position due to his own brilliance and not to his humble origins on an
algae farm.  Played by TML\'er Glenn Grant.

Lt. Jack 23: A strong, silent, dangerous type with "military" written all
over him; formerly a marine, now working for Ling Standard Security.  Has
manged to overcome his underprivileged youth as an orphan in a Solomani
Genetic Collective rather nicely.  Again, played by nobody you know.

Lt. Kyle Deschenko: A nice, genteel thug from one of the best of families.
Despite coming from a well-off family (SOC A), he nevertheless managed to
get sent to a military academy for his youthful misdeeds.  After a stint in
the Navy, he spent some time as a Rogue before getting hired by Ling.  Has
every weapon-related skill save Heavy Weapons.  Likewise, played by a
non-TMLer.



EPISODE 2: What?  Only Three Days And We\'re On The Ten Most Wanted List?
(subtitle: why you don\'t want a disgruntled postal worker as a pilot).


Scene 1: The session began on board the Frozen Glory about 5.5 days into
jump towards Archipelago en route to Skrunge.  Shortly after dinner, Xyroli
and Lt. 23 develop a nasty purple rash around the mouth and nostrils, start
projectile vomiting, keel over and pass out.  After much fuss, Dr. Dinaskir
and Maabaashii (the NPC gunner and cook) determine that it\'s an adverse
reaction to a Vilani dish that Maabaashii had prepared for dinner.  After
administering first aid and doing everything possible to make the
unconscious sufferers comfortable, it was decided that as Maabaashii had
cooked the offending food, he should be the one to vaccuum it out of the
rug.  Shortly thereafter, Xyroli regained consciousness to a degree (after
Ross, the person playing him, arrived).  Some time thereafter, they emerge
from jump on time and on target and proceed to land on Archipelago.  Xyroli
being unfit to fly, Leemcha handles the landing.  Customs and ambulance
personnel meet the ship, customs inspection is made, and the sufferers are
carted off to hospital.  Lt. 23 remains unconscious and is hospitalized,
but Xyroli manages to finagle a 3-day rest prescription from the doctor and
proceeds directly to the beach, where he lolls about in his TL-12 SPF
3,000,000 sunblock, his TL-12 Speedos, and his TL-12 shades.  The gulls
avoid him like the plague, but he manages to hook up with an unattached
(presumably colourblind) female.


Scene 2: The members of the crew not suffering from severe food poisoning
take a catamaran ferry in to Farrier, the capital (the port being on an
artificial island off Farrier).  Kliraad, the engineer, having been to
Archipelago several times, invites the crew to dinner at a little seafood
restaurant he knows.  After a trishaw ride into one of Farrier\'s less
congenial neighbourhoods, he leads them to a sidewalk cafe where they gorge
upon a wonderful seafood dinner.  Leemcha being rather devoted to duty,
leaves first, with Kliraad escorting her back to the ship.  Lt. Duschenko,
Dr. Dinaskir, and Maabaashii head for the beach, where they find a party
and proceed to get stinking drunk around a bonfire listening to a steel
drum band whose instruments are made up largely of old drop tanks (being
drummed from the inside) and the like.  Leemcha, after having headed out to
the ship, checked things out, and so forth, returns to the beach to get
some exercise and encounters the rest of the crew.  She behaves herself and
does not overimbibe.  Dr. Dinaskir and Lt. Duschenko, on the other hand, do
overimbibe, and dawn finds them asleep along the base of the seawall, Dr.
Dinaskir festooned with seaweed from an accidental dip in a tide pool.
Their hangovers are immense.  Xyroli, having awoken in a strange hotel
room, saunters by; his humour goes unappreciated by his suffering
shipmates.


Scene 3: Leemcha wakes bright and early and decides to head into town.
After buying breakfast fixings, she rents a small sporty watercraft as
transportation, because the local water taxis charge an arm and a leg.  She
manages to ding the paint job a little, and breaks many of the Rules of the
Road, but does not sink it on the way back to the port.

        After hangover recovery, that is to say around 14:30 the next
afternoon, a somewhat less zombie-like Lt. Duschenko and the ever-alert
Leemcha had in towards Ling Standard\'s Archipelago headquarters to put in
their supply requisition.  After meeting with the Veep of Supply, a young
yuppie by the name of Fanderbrees, they are told that unfortunately, they
can only be spared an open air raft, not an enclosed one, and that there
are only four security guards available, not an entire platoon.  Alarm
bells start ringing in their heads.  A quick comm call to Xyroli results in
him refusing to have them on board his ship, which is too crowded as it is.
Lt. Duschenko decides to override this.  The crew is much perturbed by
this news, as the question of why a dozen security troops, ostensibly on
board as labur for the archaeological dig, would be needed, is raised.
Leemcha decides to meet up with Xyroli back in Farrier (Xyroli, having
decided to tourist to the max, is and the Boom Tchikka Boom Club).  Xyroli
hatches the Baldrickesque cunning plan of breaking into Ling\'s motor pool,
stealing the air raft, and departing immediately.  However, Ling\'s HQ
proves impregnable, or at least closed for the day, (and their motor pool
was out at the port all along), so they return to the ship, where they find
an air raft parked by the ship.  Xyroli runs it inboard and everyone beds
down for an early departure, save Maabaashi and Kliraad, who are still out
on the town and are not responding to comm calls.


Scene 4:  The next morning, Kliraad and Maabaashii are nowhere to be seen.
Xyroli begins running preflight checks, determined to depart before the
security contingent from Ling arrives.  However, preparations are
interrupted by a call from the Port Authority.  The local law enforcement
officials have found Kliraad\'s body, his throat slit, floating in the
harbour.  Lt. Duschenko and Leemcha proceed to Agency law enforcement HQ,
where they indeed find poor Kliraad laid out on a slab.  Maabaashii\'s
whereabouts remain unknown, and he does not respond to comm calls.  During
discussions with a law enforcement officer, Leemcha lets slip that it might
be megacorp competition over the site on Skrunge that led to the murder,
and that Maabaashii might be a double agent in Tukera\'s employ.  Lt.
Duschenko is displeased with her blurting out of company secrets, and while
he lectures Leemcha on keeping her lip zipped, the law enforcement official
steps outside for a moment to place a quick comm call.  When Leemcha and
Lt. Duschenko return to the ship, they find a local police G-carrier parked
by the ship.

Scene 5: After some threats on the part of the law enforcement people,
Xyroli let them in, after having set the ship\'s anti-hijack program to be
triggered by the words "all right, that\'s enough!".  While the rest of the
crew cooperates with the police officials, who are searching the ship and
interrogating them, Xyroli is feeling rather disgruntled... and after being
pushed around a little too much, triggers the anti-hijack system (!).  As
it was late, I called it an evening there.

        Tune in next week as our gallant bunch of coconuts try and pull
themselves out of this mess...  As far as the absent player for Lt. 23
goes, he can either arrive just in time to bribe their way out of this mess
at the beginning of next session, or still be comatose when they leave if
he can\'t make it.  Either way it promises to be entertaining...  and who
knows what awaits them on Skrunge?

   I would not allow my local auto mechanic to mount a folding stock on
my Mossberg shotgun, nor would I allow a gunsmith do a transmission job
on my Dodge Omni.  Just because two jobs are done with tools does not
make them essentially the same, otherwise TNE would not have a seperate
Jeweler skill.  I would place Gunsmith in the same category as
Jeweler--related to Mechanic but definately different enough to be a
seperate skill.

Well, after re-reading what I wrote, I really felt bad about picking on you.
:( I was less than pleased with the TNE Novels.  I think they were Traveller
as far as background, but I don\'t think the writing was a good as it could
have been.  (This is spoken by a reader and not a writer, not a critique,
just opinion.)

Man, I sure am hedging alot. :)

	The surface gravity of Capital/ Core (ie Sylea) is given (in Travellers
Digest #9 pg 12) as 0.69 g.

	1 gravity is approximately 9.826 m/second therefore 0.69 g is
approximately 6.780 m/second which is close enough (for non scientific
purposes) to two thirds of 10 meters per second that Syleans might think
that  1 Traveller (10m/second) G = 150% of what I am used to weighing.  
	
	For those of you out there on starships that don\'t allow the crew to
control the gravity in each cabins seperately one good way to encourage
party bickering & petty conflict is to have different members of the
crew all want the ship gravity to be set equal to the gravity of there
home planet (sort of the way that your annoying coworkers always want
the heat lower (or higher) than you prefer).  If you wish to play an
annoying (or low Charisma for TNE people) whining about the gravity is
an excellent trick, but do not take it to far or the other_players_will
become annoyed. ):

Marc,

 I know I haven\'t said it lately and I\'ll never say it enough, but I will
say it now...

1. THANK YOU!!!  Thank you very much for the Traveller Universe.  You are
the mind behind Traveller and ever since I found it, I loved it.  I made
some comments about CT and MT not being Traveller to me, but please
understand, that is my opinion of the rules, not the background.  I don\'t
mean any offense to you about that, and I wanted you to know that I truely
appreciate what you have, are and will do for Traveller in all of its
incarnations.

2. THANK YOU!!!  Thank you very much for putting up with us on the list and
dropping in every now and again to talk to us.  I know I appreciate knowing
that you are still here.  I also am glad that you still make the time to
talk to us.  It would be very easy for you to say, "That bunch a lunatics!"
and unsubscribe and never come back, but no.  You stick around and put up
with our petty bickering and fussing and fighting.  Thanks.

Sorry for the break, but I just had to say this.

It took me about 30 minutes for the first one and 20 to 30 for each one
after that...and I did them while I was watching Babylon 5 and DS9 on the
TV.  <g>

After I did the first one, I made up a worksheet like form so I wouldn\'t
forget anything and just went down the list with vol in one column, power
in another, and crew in a third.  I remember doing a subtotal of power and
vol part of the way down, but that wasn\'t required, it was just because I
wanted to build in some redundency and wanted to make sure I had room left
when I was through.

I *did* use a pocket calculator to add up the numbers, but I think I did
most of the multiplications in my head.  I don\'t guess I\'d reject a
spreadsheet, but it seems like it might be overkill for QSDS.

> 10 Minutes, hmmm ... well, it\'s a goal.

Probably doable for a really simple ship...don\'t worry about crewing, or
workstations, or exact volumns, and no weapons.

Yeah, I like CSC.  I like CORPS.  I don\'t own Guns^3, but if I can find a
copy I\'m gonna buy it.  Greg does good work.

You might not be able to say it, but I can...Guy Garnett does
good work too! I think QSDS *very* good.

I\'ve said before and I\'ll say again...we need a detailed system so we can
build more components for the QSDS system, we need the vehicle and starship
systems to "jive", and Guy, you need to extend QSDS to any sized ship. 
Then all the ships in all the books need to be designed using the systems
and include DECKPLANS!!! ;->

That\'s what I think we need on the ship design front.

Thomas, if you can create a more simple system than QSDS that
produces ships compatable with it, SSDS, and the forthcoming FFS then go
for it. Best wishes in the attempt.

    'index' => 'bf368',
    'body' => '     Since I raised similar points a couple days earlier (but not at such
length or so insistently), I\'ll try to ennumerate a little more closely the
inadequacy I feel within QSDS.  Note that I don\'t have Book 2, High Guard, or
MT here with me so all comparisons with those are made completely by (probably
faulty) memory.
     I\'ve designed exactly one (1) ship with QSDS and while it wasn\'t too
terribly difficult or time consuming (I think it took the better part of an
hour while simultaneously watching tv), I didn\'t feel all that satisfied with
the end result, either.  The main thing I didn\'t like was that we\'re given
pages and pages of tables to chose components from, without any rationale
ebehind the numbers to allow us to extrapolate in-between values.  Rather than
a big list of parts with seemingly-random numbers attached to them, I\'d rather
have had a few flexible guidelines which could be expanded as per the referee\'s
needs (such as, for instance, expressing more values as percentages like "the
jump drive typically takes up xx% of the ship\'s total volume per j-level, with
a mass of xxtons and cost of xxMCr per cubic meter").  I don\'t know if the 
values from FF&S lend themselves to such linear/geometric expressions, or if, 
in fact, anyone besides me would be any happier with the extra math involved, 
but I would much prefer something like that to the current arrangement.  The
same goes for hulls, m-drives, power plants, and maybe even weapon systems.
     As for adding up big columns of mass, volume, and power-usage, it seems
that more approximate values would serve just as well for our (or at least my)
purposes.  I especially don\'t see why we need to get down to tenths and
hundreths of points for power use.  In fact, I seem to recall that Bk 2 and/or
High Guard didn\'t require adding up power points at all, and had a simple "x
drives require y power plant" rule that would suit me fine.
     I can\'t recall specifics here, but I recall being somewhat confused by the
weapons-systems in QSDS and all of the different values on all the tables.  
Once again, I\'d have prefered, instead of a big list of components, a basic
explanation of how the numbers are formed which would allow me to generate my
own components.
     The jist of all of this is that I thought the current arrangement (copious
lists of parts without any explanation of how the values were generated)
combines the worst of complexity vs flexibility.  Having to look through all
these lists to find the appropriate parts and then min-max and crunch numbers
to get appropriate final values is complex, maybe not As complex as the full
FF&S rules, but still more tedious math than I, for one, care to do.  And, for
all that, we still don\'t have that much design flexibility-- we can\'t build
ships above TL-12 or 5k tons, and with all other components (including hulls)
we\'re limited to what\'s on the tables, whether it fits our needs or not.  My
distant memories of High Guard tell me that it definitely was more flexible in
design (up to 1M tons and TL-15 (+?) with a large variety of component systems)
and, whether or not it actually was, seemed easier (in memory).  I think that a
really useful simple design system should attempt to match that.
     As a final note, assuming that a system which suits my needs better
doesn\'t come along, I\'m planning to use the SSDS for all future ship designs. 
The simplicity of the QSDS just isn\'t enough to make up for its lack of choices
and flexibility.  When/if I want to build ships larger than 5k tons (to make,
for instance, the navy of a non-Imperial pocket empire) I don\'t know what I\'m
going to do, but I won\'t worry about that yet.

Hope this helps the ship-design folks to see where my complaints are coming
from,

Hum, well gravity is gravity and radii are radii...so if thrusters work out
to 2000 stellar radii, then they should work out to 2000 planetary radii as
well.  <g> 

For Saturn that would be ~60,000*2000 = 120,000,000 km radius with Saturn
at the center!  Now, that\'s the better part of 2 AU across, and I *think*
Saturn\'s 2000r limit overlaps Sol\'s so maybe you can get to Saturn on
thrusters after all. <bg>

An invading fleet could consist of a mix of craft using various types
of drives. Something like this:
Heplar/Fusion rocket:
 - Escorts
 - Battle tenders
 - Dreadnaughts

Thrusters:
 - Interface/aerospace fighters
 - Battle riders
 - Drop shuttles

The composition would be determined by starsystem configuration, and
defending forces.

You can actually do something else besides stare in gross captivation 
while B5 is on?  

I\'m just helpless when that show comes on.  There\'s no way I could do 
something like design a Traveller ship while I\'m watching B5.  

If it can\'t be done during a commercial break, it just can\'t be done.

Hmm, Eris, it must have been a rerun.

I don\'t know. I think the rules suited TNE. Is it Traveller? Arguable. But

I think the background is wonderful. It allows a large variety of styles.
While, the mechanics of the propagation of Virus is kinda wonky, I can
cobble up enough bullshit to make it less wonky while maintaining the

 This also has an interesting effect on jumpspace. The 100 diameter limit for
the Sun is, according to the above numbers, at 86.4 million miles (.929 AU).
Earth\'s orbital distance averages at 1.00 AU (this is the definition of the
AU, by the way).
  What this means in our system is that a ship can jump once it gets beyond
Earth\'s immediate gravity effect. What it means for the rest of the Imperium
is that the Primary\'s effect on Jumpspace is easily findable if you have a
table of Stellar Radii that defines Sol as 1.00.  The Stellar Radii multiplied by .929 then gets you the distance in AU to the Primary\'s 100 diameter limit.
Comparing this to the orbital distances chart will tell you if the mainworld
is under the primary\'s jump shadow or not, which in turn tells you something
about the shape of jump traffic in the system.
  If you are a lazy sort, or don\'t have a calculator handy, just use the
stellar radius straight (multiply it by 1.0 to get AU).
  Where do you get a table of Stellar Radii?  For those of you with a good
Classic Traveller library, one can be found in Book 6:Scouts on page 45. This
book also makes the above rounding simplification (on page 46), so the table
of Stellar Radii is useful without a calculator (well, you still might need
one for the interpolation of stellar class).

However it seems to me what you need is a Modular system, that has three
depth\'s to it.

Stage 1. Basic Design system.

This Designs the basic hull and body of the ship using bog standard
modules, such as Jump drive, Cabins, Sensor Arrays.
i.e Its 200t Freighter with Jump2, fifteen passenger approach.

Stage 2. a QSDS type system which designs the Modules
such as the sensor array has this feature and this widget.

then for the REAL techno freak gearheads

Stage 3. a long winded design the boards that make up the modules to tweak
the extra 0.000000001% efficiency out of the fresher type system. 

The idea being you go through the steps in a logical order starting with
the hull and moving on down and into the gubbins of how it works as far as
you want/require.

IF the existing design systems can be tweaked into this sort of
configuration, I have no idea.

This is my thoughts, the floor is now open.

Thanx Wildstar for pointing this out.  While I was preparing for my next
IRC lecture on SSDS, I discovered these facts on my own. I was
converting QSDS wepons to SSDS and vice versa.  I found that QSDS
military batteries have the number of wepons listed, a MFD and a
workstation.  The power discrepency bothered me untill I noticed the
ROF\'s in SSDS. I multi by 5 to get QSDS values and it worked.  Nice to
see my maths were correct! :)  Now I can take(practicaly) any FF&S
weapon and convert to T4.  I was going to submit this question, as
someone sugested, to the, what was it....GDW Beta list?  Anyway, looks
like you beat me to the punch.  Good show!

I was just making the point that there should be, as MM himself 
postulated, there should be multiple layers of complexity, the 
simplest being presented in the main rulebook. And up to now, what is 
really missing is a simple STEP-BY-STEP design system, that is 
plainly understandable the first time U use it.

I liked the MTdesign sequence for it\'s step-by step design, i 
disliked it for being not consequent enough and requiring a lot of 
extra work to make it go.
I disliked FFS for being way to complex and unhandy for a first time 
user and requiring too much work to get what you wanted.

Finally, I am not saying that my opinions are right for everyone, but 
I feel the need to voice them. Not all of us are "Gearheads" (which 
is not meant in any sense, demeaning), to us, the technical detail of 
Traveller is just second to the unlimited adventure and s.o.w.

>>Speaking of Vilani, does anyone on the list know of Traveler linguistic
material that\'s been created?  Either canonically or privately?

Almost all the CT Alien Modules had charts for random generation of "words": 
 Vargr, Darrian, K\'kree, Droyne, Aslan, and I think Zhodani (but I don\'t 
have that one :-( ).  The DGP MT Vilani & Vargr and Solomani & Aslan have 
this info too, I think (I need to check).  Maybe even Hiver & Ithklur has 
one for Ithklur (need to check this too).

Rob Prior (I think) has made a nice program (several in fact) for the Mac 
that will allow you to get letter frequencies from a sample list of words 
and create a chart like the ones in the Alien Modules, and he even has some 
samples from real-world languages.  I don\'t know the URL off the top of my 
head, but I think Rob is an active member of the TML, right?

There\'s another good program for DOS that has the same kind of charts in it 
for many Traveller languages called Trwords.exe, and I think you can add 
your own charts.  It\'s by Leroy Guatney of HIWG, and I think you can get it 
at http://ouray.cudenver.edu/~lwlguatn/index.html.

Still another is included as part of Dennis G. Landsem\'s MT GM Aid for 
Windows.  It may be available, but I don\'t remember the URL.  Ask 
dennis@lise.unit.no.

>>Is anyone *interested* in this subject?  I am -- in Vilani and/or Zhodani, 
at least. Traveler, with all its hard-science feel, is pretty soft on the
socio-cultural side of things -- we shouldn\'t let those lumpy-browed
Klingons get all the attention for having their own language <G>.

I am also interested in this subject.  After spending some time looking into 
the possibility of using the Traveller word generation chart system to try 
and make random English-sounding words just to test how well the charts 
simulate words in other non-English languages, I found out the following:

1) Traveller word generation charts attempt to represent sounds, not 
spelling.  You can confirm this by carefully reading the chart descriptions 
in the Alien Modules.  The authors either couldn\'t print phonetic symbols or 
didn\'t feel them to be necessary, but they are trying to spell things so 
that there is a 1 to 1 correspondence between sound and spelling.  Spanish 
almost does this, and Japanese does it if you are consistent in the method 
you use to transcribe it into the Roman alphabet, but languages with much 
spelling variation like English are far from showing a 1 to 1 sound to 
spelling correspondence.

2) Because of (1), you cannot expect good results with a computer program 
that analyzes word lists for letter frequencies unless 1) the language you 
are analyzing has a 1 to 1 spelling to sound correspondence or 2) you 
rewrite the entire word list so that there is a 1 to 1 correspondence or 3) 
you do everything with phonetic symbols (effectively same as 2).

3) I read that phonotactics (the branch of Chomskyan linguistics that tries 
to analyze phonological structures as generative grammar analyzes sentences) 
is not very successful.  When you use the Traveller word generation system, 
you are essentially using watered-down phonotactics.  The sounds are put 
into charts according to their frequency as vowels or consonants, and their 
frequency in the beginning, middle, or end of a syllable.  Types of 
syllables are also assigned frequencies (very hard data to find for 
English!).  Phonotactics fails because it does not consider the function of 
sounds - conveying meaning.  That requires you to consider morphemes - the 
smallest parts of words that have meaning (affixes and root words).

4)  Without morphemes, all you have are random strings of sounds 
(surprise!).  Not every possible sound combination in English sounds like 
English.  If you want to simulate a language, it might be better to create 
lists of morphemes using the Traveller word generation tables (to keep the 
sounds of the language), assign the morphemes meanings, and then use the 
morphemes to create meaningful words.

Sound time consuming?  It is.  But if you want to develop Vilani or Zhodani 
closer to the level of Klingon, you have to do it (and more - you\'ll need a 
grammar too).

Well, while I agree that this is fine and if you want to use it in your
campaign, go ahead, I don\'t think it makes a good standard system rule.

First of all, a ship design system allows us to determine what\'s a valid
ship. Without a ship design system, we coud just say "Yeah, it\'s a 100 Td
scout, with Jump-, um... 4 and, ah... 60 Td of cargo space, with 12 staterooms.
Yeah. That\'s it." I don\'t think that this kind of \'the referee will 
determine the subsequent ship design\' is particularly useful.

Second, it gives players from different campaigns the ability of design
ships using a standard set of assumptions, so Ship A from my campaign
can can be used in your campaign without having to worry about
whether or not I\'m a goof when it comes to designing ships.

Finally, as I seem to recall from \'The Traveller Book\', Traveller is and
always has been a game that can be played in a group or alone. Alone?
How? World design, vehicle design, ship design, rolling up and detailing
NPCs are all the kind of things that can be a lot of fun and can be done
even if your group isn\'t around. I think from that point of view, systems
like SSDS are really cool because I\'m trying to find both the time and
some people to get a Trav game running, but until then, I can still
play around and design ships and such.

I think compared to the old CT basic ship design system, QSDS is about
equal in terms of simplicity. SSDS is good for more detailed ships of
moderate size, but I don\'t know if I\'d use SSDS for that 50,000 Td 
dreadnaught (I know there aren\'t any 50,000 Td hulls listed, but you could
extrapolate one).

To sum up, my thoughts on ship design are very Vilani in nature - take the
existing QSDS system and polish it until it shines so bright you can\'t
stand to look at it. All the pieces are there, what the system needs is
typesetting, good layout and some good examples so that people don\'t
think it\'s complex because it ISN\'T!

As far as the right to choose, you\'ll have QSDS, SSDS and (soneday) FF&S/NAH
which will all be more-or-less compatiable, which I think is a pretty good
set of choices.

It took me 10 minutes to design my first High Guard ship (If you don\'t
count the 30 minutes it took me to read the rules). After that it took
me about 5 minutes per ship. In my heyday, I could knock off a design in
1 minute if I skipped tallying the price and USP (and, as a ref, I could
always make the buyers tally the price for me, and make the belligerents
lookup the USP values).

Traveller is a /game/, it shouldn\'t have /chores/. HG ship design simply
was never a chore for me.

Well, I don\'t hate to get into this because some of Richter\'s complaints
are valid, some aren\'t and he has a very antagonistic style which gets me
riled up too, but I\'ve seen the blood (so to speak) so I\'ll just stay out.

The 3 things MTR has brought up (to my knowledge are):

1) T4\'s task system makes \'Impossible\' tasks too easy.
2) T4\'s character generation system makes it easy to min-max.
   (Specifically, being able to get a duke or somesuch in 1 term)
3) T4\'s combat system is unrealistic.

To which my responses are:

1) Yep. \'Impossible\' tasks are too easy. I\'d use a slightly modified system.
2) So what? If a player really wants a Duke, go ahead. It\'s a random
   system, stupid stuff will happen. I just plain don\'t care about this.
3) If I wanted ultra-realistic combat, I\'d play another game. I want
   a certain sci-fi backdrop, so I play Traveller. I want characters to
   be reasonably afraid of gumplay, but I don\'t want to kill them off
   like Call of Chthulu (sp?) characters.

IMO, Richter has one valid criticism of T4, aside from all the other 
ones we\'ve heard here over and over again - bad layout, missing tables,
art, etc, etc, etc. Which aren\'t criticisms of the game mechanics but
complaints about product quality, which are a separate category.

> Nonetheless you failed to address all his objective complaints.

I think Doug has given some reasonable responses, but has gotten 
sucked into the Usenet Flame Machine(tm), which I don\'t approve of,
but can forgive him for, as it will happen to everyone who reads Usenet
sooner or later. Thankfully on TML, mass Traveller love-ins are the order
of the day and no one gets their nose out of joint, except maybe Phil.

> Since I\'d like to prevent the TML from becoming yet another battleground
> I\'d propose to continue all further discussion about this via email.

Well, if it\'s criticisms about Traveller, please continue the discussion
here. If it\'s about forcing people to take two Valiums and wait an hour
before posting to Usenet, by all means, take it to email.

You reckon, what about in Indonesia there are a lot of very angry 
tribespeople out there who are quite annoyed at their forrests and landf 
being destroyed to build roads etc. Of course the road is alsp so the 
nice government can move troops around quicker to protect the populace.
Or for an example closer to home how about the Zapatistas in Mexico. 
A good adventure seed would be for the government to act all nice and 
fluffy when the off worlders are around to get the aid and be bastards 
when the PC\'s backs are turned. What happens when the PC\'s find out/get

This sounds like a classic Dr. Forward novel <grin>  He has a series of
which \'Roche World\' is one.  Basically humans go to Alpha Centauri  and
find a very strange star system with some rather implausible worlds, on
of which is a contact binary planet system (you heard me
right--darnedest thing I ever saw)

On the trips *to* the New World there wasn\'t anything on the ships
worth stealing. They did tend to stay together simply because the
Spanish weren\'t exactly the greatest navigators in the world.

It does get my vote for the best SF series in history.  Second place to Star

A few minor corrections. Since only *thrust* forces affect the pilot of
a space fighter (unlike airplanes where aerodynamic forces dominate),
the g forces will be *tranverse* (front to back). 

Tolerances for tranverse Gs are *much* higher. The Saturn V subjected
the astronauts to 9.5 transverse Gs. Tests in the 50s using rocket
sleds subjected test subjects to brief periods of 40 to 80 Gs. 40 Gs
(for a few seconds) resulted in nothing more than than some bruising.
80 Gs resulted in injuries, but wasn\'t lethal.

One interesting fact discovered during the tests (which started as part
of the program to design ejection seats) was that the rate of change of
acceleration (called "surge") was important. Keeping surge low made
high accelerations more survivable.

The person in charge of the research was a Col. Stapp (USAF). I know
there was a published report giving the limits for not only
acceleration but also for things like high and low temp and pressure.
If anybody locates a source, please let the list know. I suspect it\'d
be *very* useful, not only for answering our questions about fighter
acceleration, but also all those nagging little problems about what
happens if players get subjected to environmental extremes.

Not quite true. Damage to the *engines* or propshaft could be a real
problem. Crack a cylinder or break a piston and you\'ve got some real
problems unless the port has shops capable of repairing them.

I\'ve also designed (in my head) some *long* life electronics for a
generation ship, based on trying to figure out a realistic way of
implementing controls equivalent to the ones Heinlein had on the ship
in "Orphans of the Sky".

It\'s possible to build long life semiconductors by using *large*
junctions and good grounding procedures. And there are ways of creating
controls that are activated by touch (capacitance switches, like the
ones in elevators). Since the "switch" has no moving parts, you get
long life. 

For adjustment type controls (as in replacements for potentiometers), I
came up with a design like this. Feel free to use it as "alien"
technology. :-)

So for example, if you want to increase power you\'d hit the square on
the right. To decrease power you\'d hit the button on the left. Im you
wanted to adjust the "granularity" of the adjustments (ie change from
Megawatts to Kilowatts) you\'d hit range increase/decrease the proper
number of times (or just hold it down until it got close). The four
select buttons should be obvious.

I put the high/low *value* squares as far as possible apart, that\'s why
they are diagonally opposite. Low value got placed there by looking at
"decrease range" and "decrease value". Obviously to decrease *both* (to
the limit) you pick the square between them. :-)

Highest value got picked the same way. The other two went in what\'s
left.

The laws of physics say that there\'s going to be a definite gravity
wave generated by a ship jumping in *or* out. And the strength will
depend on the mass. Of course, that doesn\'t tell you how far away the
ship is, just the direction. So just like anything else you need a
distance to get the mass (or observations from two different
locations).

So that much should be true *regardless* of what the rules may say.

But that won\'t tell you how far the ship jumped, or from what
direction. Some sources say that there\'s an energy discharge associated
with jump entry/exit. But people disagree about what info about the
jump you can get from this.

If you feel (as I do) that momentum is conserved when jumping, the
ship\'s velocity at entry exit will *suggest* some possible
source/destination points if you look up the relative velocity of the
stars within jump range. 

But basicly, it\'s up to the ref.

That\'s why I would like the right to choose :-)  A simple design system is
what I currently need (due to lack of time).  I believe that with more
practice and more time I\'d also be interested in the more complex versions
but for now that\'s simply too much (especially for my basic needs -- I
would like to create some ships with the basic data, so that my players
could use it... I don\'t want to get messed up in endless details I right
now *don\'t* want).

No question.  I really would agree with this.  It would be nice to have a
separate supplement for this, too.  I always liked the way Shadowrun did
it: you get all the required basic stuff in the basic rules and then can
add the Rigger Black Book if you want detailed combat rules for vehicles,
you can add the Grimoire if you want an extended magic system with a lot
more detail, you can add the various cyber supplements if you want more of
that, etc.  What Traveller should be doing differently is, that the
adventures and setting material should not necessarily depend on those
supplements (which is sometimes a little annoying in Shadowrun).

This would make for a really flexible, scalable RPG system, something I
yet have to see to this extent.  Maybe the folks at IG can do it...

Consistency is necessary although I\'d really by willing to live with minor
inconsistencies (e.g. junk all the fractions and generally get more
intuitive numbers).  If the details are slightly wrong this is not too
much of a problem (players and GMs interested in a simple system won\'t
care if the fuel consumption is off a little bit while the others could
use the more detailed systems with more "edge").  The stats for ships
still could be derived from the detailed systems (maybe each ship going
with a small box giving a short summary of the stats for the basic
system).

Even the collection of quotes, puns, jokes, etc from the series ("Off

Don\'t forget that the Polesotechnic(sp) League stories are set in the
same universe as Flandry, only a few centuries earlier. They are great
source material. So are the few stories set *after* the Flandry stories
(the only one I can think of at the moment is "Starfog")

*Any* of Anderson\'s SF is worth having. And a remarkable amount of the
older stuff works well for Traveller ideas. 

BTW, he gave A.Bertam Chandler permission to "borrow" Flandry for a
crossover with Chandler\'s Rim Worlds stories. And those stories are
worth reading too, even if some of them depend on oddities of the
several different star drives used in that universe.

Laumer comes by his knowledge of such things from *personal*
experience. He used to be in the US Consular Corps! There\'s a photo of
him in a CDT outfit in an old Analog. If I stumble across it, I\'ll have
to scan it in. :-)

James H. Schmitz wrote a lot of good stuff. Most of it set in "The Hub"
a group of worlds set somewhere in the galaxy. Many deal *heavily* with
Psi. 

"The Witches of Karres" is a *classic*, and it begs for a sequel. But
the manuscript he\'d started got lost during a move in the 60s and he
never recreated it. Arrgghh!

Oh yes, a paperback published a few years back bears looking at for you
RC types (and the rest of us). It\'s "Unwillingly to Earth" by Pauline
Ashwell. It\'s a collection of stories she wrote in the 50s and 60\'s.
They deal with a girl who is being trained in "Cultural Engineering".
Yep! Hiver manipulation ideas! The last story has some good ideas for
how the Scout Service might handle recontact with a world that has a
couple of superpowers about to blow each other up. Another has a
colonization effort gone wrong and should be mandatory reading for refs
dealing with the colonization of "perfect" worlds. :-)

Oh yeah, if you get past the sex, Elf Sternberg\'s Pendor stories
(available on his web page at www.halcyon.com) have some neat ideas.
One of the most recent has to do with the discovery of aliens in cold
sleep for centuries after their world blew itself to hell in a nuclear
war. 

Pendor would be a fun place to drop in a *high* tech Traveller game but
you\'d need Elf\'s permission, and the tech is probably in the 20s for
some things. Hmmm. Maybe not. I just remembered that they *can\'t* build
Ringworlds anymore.

I\'ve read on the list the past few days that there are some people that
don\'t like ttne.  Since I\'m new to the list I\'ve missed the past discusions
on this, and don\'t understand the references to the poorness of the game.  

I myself am new to traveller and only play ttne.  I love it, and the group I
play with never fails to be ammusing.  It\'s the most I\'ve had since my first
D&D game way back when, and think it\'s the best thing since sliced bread.  

Just wondering if some of you gurus out there could fill me in, on why it is
thought to be lacking and what it is lacking in.  Just the ups and down of
it ocmpared to other Travellers.  Not trying to start any flames, just
trying to round myself out.  

Thanks or appologies in advance.

It should probably be "stellar radii" (the radius of a star; "solar radii"
means the radius of the Sun).  No matter what you call it, it\'s referring to
the useful distance for thruster plates.

Thruster plates are gravitic technology, and require a gravity field to
"push against" (that\'s a poor analogy, but it works for our purposes).  As a
rule of thumb, the gravity field is strong enough out to about 1000
diameters (2000 radii, since radius is half of diameter).

Ususally the central star is the biggest object around; anywhere within 2000
radii of the system\'s star, the thrust plate drives will work.  They\'ll also
work within 1000 diameters of anything else, but for interplanetary travel
amoung the outer planets of a system, thrust-plates are pretty useless.


Dave Strebe asked:
> So then what is the limit in AU\'s or Light Seconds of thruster plates?
> 2000 solar radii=?

Here\'s some tables to help you out:

This first table lists the diameter of a star (in light-seconds) by the
star\'s spectral class and luminosity.  For example, Sol (our Sun) is a 
a main-sequence (Luminosity class V) G-type star.  The diameter of a G5 V
star is 4.2 light-seconds; the thrust-plate limit is 4200 light-seconds.

The limit for thrust plate drives is 1000 diameters (2000 radii).  Multiply
these values by 1000 to determine the distance in light-seconds.  If you
want to convert to AU, divide by 500 (500 light-seconds is 1 AU).

Here are the "standard" orbits, in AU, millions of kilometers, and
light-seconds.  To use this table, look up the limit value in light seconds,
to find the orbit numbers that are inside and outside the limit.  For
example, Sol\'s limit is 4200 light-seconds.  This falls between orbits 6 and
7; therefore, in our solar system Jupiter is inside the limit, and Saturn is
outside it.

Planets

The limit also applies to planets, so it is sometimes useful to know what it
is.  I\'ve pre-computed the limit, in light-seconds, for each size world.

middle of the size range, and are generally larger than corresponding worlds
in Earth\'s solar system.

Right.  1000 diameters will do as a rule of thumb.

 _top-notch_ grist for the Traveller adventurer - Even dragonkin
 doesn\'t break Traveller (much); these are psionically active
 animals (Telepathy and Teleportation) that become sentient or
 marginally below when in psichosymbiosis [sic] with a human
 being.  The only problem with their abilities (which are key to
 the _stories_, not the background) is their ability to teleport

 Definitely.  Less Travelleresque in some respects, but

 _Xenocide_, and _Children_of_the_Mind_.

 You\'ve missed a couple of things -

 First, English is the most common _interlanguage_ today (there
 are still more speakers of Chinese (any dialect), and possibly
 Spanish (though if not, it\'s a close third)), and is the
 language of international communication (including air traffic
 control, universally, and diplomacy - if the German and Russian
 foreign ministers meet, and neither knows the other\'s language,
 they\'ll transact business in English).  It\'s also the most
 commonly used language in the United Nations, which in the
 Traveller canon eventually evolved into the Terran Federation
 and the Rule of Man, and indirectly into the government of the
 Solomani Confederation as well.

 Second, Terra was never part of the \\Ziru Sirka\\; Vilani was
 the language of "the enemy", and hence not likely to have been
 widely studied - and since it was the language of a _defeated_
 enemy, it was incumbent on the losers to learn the winner\'s
 language.  Had the Vilani beaten the Terran Federation instead
 of the other way around, it\'s quite likely that your scenario
 would have come to pass to a certain extent - i.e., the
 Mandarin speakers would have been at a potential advantage to
 learn the conqueror\'s tongue, and to influence it.

 I wrote a RICE paper on pretty much this topic; it gives my
 viewpoint on it - but I also explicitly note that Emperor
 Hiroshi\'s/Admiral Estigarriba\'s Anglic would have been no more
 recognizable to our ears than our English would have been to
 an English king of the ninth or tenth century AD, and the
 Galanglic of the Third Imperium probably would have been
 equally unrecognizable to Estigarriba/Hiroshi.

 Languages _do_ evolve over time, absorbing vocabulary and
 influences from other languages that it comes in contact with.
 A dominant language will be changed less than a subordinate
 language; the conqueror\'s language changes less than the
 conquered\'s. Shakespeare\'s English had been a conquered tongue;
 it absorbed many changes from Norman French. Louis XVI\'s French
 was not as different from ninth century Norman French as
 Shakespeare\'s English was from ninth century English; French
 was a conqueror\'s tongue; it absorbed few changes from any of
 its neighbors.  Your English and mine was a conqueror\'s tongue;
 it absorbed no more than some vocabulary from the Native Tribal
 tongues, or from the languages that immigrants have brought
 with them. Cleon\'s Galanglic (a conqueror\'s tongue) will have
 been affected by long contact with Vilani, and will have
 absorbed some Vilani (and possibly some Vargr) vocabulary and
 usages - but "street Vilani" or "star Vilani" (a conquered
 tongue) will probably have absorbed more Galanglic, possibly
 shedding _some_ of its tonality by the time of the
 Proclamation, and certainly incorporating some Vilanicizations
 of Galanglic words (As Japanese has done today - go see a
 "besuboru" game and then stop off at "Makadonado" on the way
 home, for example).

 More, rather than less.  I recall once upon a time giving him
 the list address and instructions, after he bitched about no
 Usenet presence of (the early) IG - I told him about their
 quite explicit presence on the TML, and suggested that he would
 do better to subscribe to the list - from IG\'s point of view,
 it had to be a "more bang for the Internet buck" situation.  He
 started smartmouthing about "elitists", and suggested that
 there were probably more people on rgfm than on the list.  I
 was going to tell him point-blank that he was full of shit;
 that the list was advertised pretty well on the Web, and by
 word of mouth; by the way, did you notice that I gave you
 complete information on subscribing, asshole?; I decided at the
 last minute not to; while I don\'t mind posting the occasional
 inflammatory message that causes _other_ people to get involved
 in flamewars, I don\'t play in them myself.

 I did suggest, in the same message to him that carried the
 address, that he\'d be welcome on the list if he could engage in
 rational discussion and constructive criticism; but if he was
 going to be an asshole, he was welcome to rant all he wanted -
 on rgfm, not the list.

 I suspect very much that since we\'re too elitist for him, and
 capable of reasoned discourse without being assholes, that he
 would have no fun here, and hence doesn\'t subscribe.  If I spot
 the occasional reasonable person who I don\'t know is already on
 the list, I drop them a private with the list info, and an
 invitation to join.

Sumer\'s two orders of magnitude too recent: 3,000 BC vs. 300,000 BC.
Though Sumerian is non-Indo-European, as I recall, so perhaps they were
merely the last speakers of the tongue that also spawned Vilani.

Me, I\'m convinced the Roswell Incident was really the crash of a Vilani
corporate scout... far better to spread rumors of little bald guys (or
were those one of the minor races serving within the Ziru Sirka?) than to
have the public face aliens who were human....  Which makes the Solomani
not a major race, and thus has been covered up for millenia.

I read the usenet articles too, but I wouldn\'t post into that
meat-grinder on a bet!  ;-> I think Stu, Jeff, and Doug (until MTR baited
him into a flame war) have done a good job in there.

MTR, got his wind up *way* back when T4 first came out, had troubles with
IG over a credit card order, and gave the basic rules a very vocal bad
review.  Shortly thereafter he made an off-hand crack about IG "going out
of business" when he couldn\'t connect to their webpage or get them on the
phone, and Ken Whitman made his infamous reply.  (For those that don\'t
know, Ken basically said IG wasn\'t going out of business and he didn\'t
appreciate people making cracks like that or slamming a game, or company,
before it had a chance get going.)

I guess it wasn\'t a very polite response, and it probably wasn\'t the
diplomatic thing to do, but personally I think Ken had every right to post
what he did.  I don\'t think MTR meant any real harm with his crack, and up
to that point he appeared to be willing to reasonably discuss his
complaints, but Ken\'s post seemed to \'pop his cork\' and the flames burned
brightly there for several weeks.  Since then, I don\'t think MTR has said
*anything* remotely kind about anything Traveller, and he\'s had quite a lot
to say.

I\'m not suggesting that MTR\'s review, or subsequent comments, were biased
by his disagreements with IG or its management.  Others are free to think
that if they want to, but *I\'m* not going to suggest it.  ;->  

I also think Michael *enjoys* trolling, and he\'s been using
criticism of T4 as bait.  Doug, trying to answer reasonably, got slammed,
replied, double slammed...and hooked...sorry Doug.

Sure, a lot of us agree with this.  There are other nits we can pick with
the task system too, but we\'re in here fixing them...or developing and
using our own house rules.

I don\'t much care either, and this sort of min/maxing only takes place it
the GM allows the pick/pick method of CG anyway.  I think CG could be
improved (like I don\'t think *anything* can\'t be improved <g>), but it
isn\'t as "broken" as MTR thinks.

 3) T4\'s combat system is unrealistic.

Oh Pleeease!  :-> Does *anybody* think T4\'s combat system is

combat system works.  

Personally, I like a more detailed system, and eventually we\'ll have one. 
Knowing this list we\'ll have several, so I\'m not worried about it.  Hum, I
think I\'ll pull my old copy of "Snapshot" out...;->

Yeah, I agree.  That\'s why I don\'t post in there.  First time
somebody flamed me I\'d end up doing a 5 mile hike to cool off...and as much
as I might *need* to be doing 5 mile hikes, I\'d prefer not doing them just
to calm down. ;->

But it makes perfect sense. Why would the reborn Sylea use Terran measures,
other than for player convinence? 

I do believe that the meter is based on some atomic measurement, so it may
not be location relative like solar radii.

Last week I sat in on Bill Prankard\'s QSDS walkthrough on IRC, and
discovered that it\'s not as bad as I feared. QSDS is very similar, in
terms of complexity, to the original starship construction rules
found in CT Book 2. The main differences come from the addition of
tracking power consumption and use of the ship\'s surface area (simple
enough to tabulate along the way), and some additional details
regarding things like sensors, communications equipment, and the
like.

Overall, I find it a very simple system to use. It may need a little 
sprucing up, but it\'s quite usable.


I\'ve posted a QSDS walkthrough (loosely based on Bill\'s discussion, 
with several of my own modifications, comments, and suggestions) at:

Yes!  Absolutely!  Why didn\'t I see this before!  What other explanation
can there possibly be? <G>  *Obviously* the Sumerians must have been
extraterrestrials -- how else could they have invented writing and
ziggurats and all that stuff, eh?  Eh?

I haven\'t got any Traveler materials on hand -- I\'m doing this by memory --
but the Vilani had a fairly extensive interstellar society around 3000 -
2500 B.C.E., isn\'t that right?  Sounds like it might mesh with the canon...
well, sort of...

This also neatly explains why no one has been able to make a really solid
case for the linguistic affinities of Sumerian -- it\'s ALIEN.  Heh heh heh.

Great idea.  This one definitely goes in my mental file of cool consipracy
theories.

Because, I didn\'t want somebody jumping all over me for suggesting it.  I
*knew* the gravity of Core (ie Sylea) had been listed as something like .7g
in an early JTAS.  Got jumped anyway.  <g>

As for the light second, it *is* a good idea, but I don\'t think it\'ll
happen officially.

Yeah, it has something to do with the spectral wavelength of some element
or other...I think.  OTOH, we could just say the meter is the length of the
Emperor\'s septre, or the width of his Iridium seat or something.  <g>

yes, relative to yourself, your velocity is always zero which explains the
way many people drive. However, since we are usually within a star system,
the simplest point of reference, for everybody, is the primary. If it is a
binary or trinary system, the largest star is used. So we can both time and
velocity stamp any synchonization packets in the data stream, based on the
velocity relative between any ship and the primary. Since we know our
velocity relative to the primary, and the data packet has the velocity of
the sending ship relative to the primary, we can then make any adjustments
to interchanged sensor data to account for tau factor.

This is certainly going to be one major difference between civilian and
military sensor suites. Law abiding civies aren\'t going to need this kind of
co ordination ability and the computational power to go with it.

Maybe the actual sensors are no different between military and civilian, but
the underlying support equipment certainly will be. Any be one of the things
that customs and patrol inspects will be looking into.

        I love it!  Make brilliant sense in an Erich von Daniken sort of

deNada. real simple explanation:

During this past month, I\'ve been stuck at home while my oncologist tried to
treat Yet Another Problem related to my Hodgkin\'s Disease.  This involved
massive doese of Prednisone.  This is a strong steroid.  I was going nuts

Of course, being this psychotic helped me write four article for JTAS, along

        Absolutely.  I hope that Milieu 0 will have picked up on the themes
arising from the "imperfection of progress":  while some people in the
expanding Imperium will be overjoyed at their brand new 300-channel
holovision, others will not, and will see themselves marginalized...  It\'d
add a certain grittiness to the setting.

It got covered a few months back here on TML -- Marc posted the original
outline, which I still have somewhere or other on disk....  It was to be a
campaign outline for a group of Terran Confederation Marines, infected
with a virulent and incurable illness (or radiation poisoning or some
such?) who were thus forced into coldsleep, waking up periodically to see
if they could find help.  They end up popping up in the midst of the
Second Imperium, Long Night, Aslan Border Wars, Sylean Expansion, Solomani
Rim War, Rebellion, etc.  Probably would have been neat, though a
challenge to avoid patness.

Traveller when TNE came out. 
CT was set in the Third Imperium, so it has a more space opera feel to it,
but it also offers "hard science" stuff for gearheads like me. The rules
are fairly simple and clean, so gameplay is pretty fast. Also, there were
some very high quality stuff produced by other companies like FASA, DGP
etc. And not to mention JTAS, which I think is probably the first of its
kind. That is, a magazine that publishes a lot of fan contributions and
offers a very dynamic feel to the game setting.
Along came Frank Chadwick, and he almost totally changed the game setting
and rules with TNE. In is Virus and RC and out with the Imperium (yeah,
there\'s the Regency, but its not the same Imperium). I guess a lot of
people don\'t like what Frank did, because things have changed. A lot of
people feel that TNE has too much emphasis on combat, and rules, and
techno stuff. Well, they\'re right to a certain extend. The gritty feel and
the gearhead stuff is what I like about TNE, along with the RC. 
Different people have different tastes. If you\'re having fun, then by all
means, keep doing it.

Nope.  The meter was defined during the French Revolution as 1/10,000 the
length of the meridian of Paris between the north pole and the equator.
Later, it turned out that (a) they\'d used the wrong radius and shape for
Earth, and (b) this sucked as a practical definition...so the next
standard was defined as the length of a particular carefully machined
iridium bar.  Besides being an ideal throne material, iridium has the nice
property of having a tiny coefficient of thermal expansion -- meaning the
meter didn\'t change length (much) when the room got warm.  The Standard
Meter was housed at a lab (again in Paris, I believe) and used to create
copies which were in turn copied to satisfy the world\'s craving for meter
sticks.

Eventually, it was decided that this standard sucked almost as bad as the
first one had, and the modern definition was born:  N wavelengths of the
emission from a He/Ne laser.  This has the massive advantage of being
exactly reproducible on demand anywhere.  But, at root, the meter is
derived from good ol\' Terra in the most direct possible way.

Actually, holed boilers couldn\'t be patched very well at all.  That is why
ships ran on multiple boilers; (there was also a limit on the size of a
boiler that could be practically built and moved to the shipyard; There was
also a limit to how large a boiler could be serviced by men with shovels).
Not to mention that flooding the coal bunker would stop the ship (no way to
restart it).  Also, hitting an engine or drive shaft did permanent bad
things to carefully machined parts (like causing them not to move) that
coul.  In short, a few big hits in teh wrong places and the vessel could
well be permanently out of action until towed somewhere with a shipyard.

Also, in space, several small leaks would do just as well to erode teh
ship\'s atmosphere, which could kill the crew in a few days.  As could major
damage to a food service system, a water system, or a power system.

See, the problem with spacecraft is that they have to carry INTACT a whole
environment.  There\'s many pieces that once damaged are gone - and repairing
the system won\'t help bring back lost components.  And rememver, your spares
are just as vulnerable as teh rest of your ship.

Sure we do.  That\'s not hard to judge based on TL extrapolation.  And other
than you, we all seem to have severe doubts about robustness.

Think carefully.  I\'m using weapons that knocks out it\'s drives and power
systems,
CinC centers and weapons - the vulnerable items hidden in the most protected
parts of teh ship.  I get there by blasting very hard to reach into the ship
to hit these components.  There won\'t be much else left.

besides, what do I want with a damaged ship that I have to tow, feed power
to, replace substantial chunks of its systems, not to mention require
specialized vessels to haul it through jump to a major shipyard? Not to
mention depleting my crews trying to figure out foreign control systems
designed using different design paradigms.  Bot to mentioning sitting still
in the midst of an action to send bording units (in small vulnerable craft)
across to the surrendered vessel.  Sounds like several wates of time,
energy, and manpower to me.

I\'m not syaing ships won\'t be captured, but as a space naval commander, i\'ll
be more interested in rendering these vessels functionally in capacitated so
I can carry out my mission (or stop them from carrying out theirs).  The
fasted way is to incapacitate those systems we mentioned, which are kept as
safe as possible to keep a warship functioning as long as possible, will be
to blow the ship away as fast as possible.  Which is why there were so few
boarding actions in WWI & WWII.

If it\'s taht long to the jump point, the follower usually has a weapon or
missile taht will catch him first.

[points of displayed ignorance about historic naval tactics skipped to save
several Mb of discussion that has little to do with space combat]

>In *your* game a turn is 30 minutes, not in *my* game! 
I did not write space combat for CT, MT, TNE, or T4, so don\'t look at me. I
only report what it is.  Logically though, until you are very close,
maneuvering won\'t matter a lot, as long range will cause short term
maneuvering to disappear as a matter of scale.

When you writea space combat game, do post the rules.  

Until then, save teh bandwidth.

"Crossing the T" is applied to Nelson only by modern historians.  Histories
from before 1900 call it "breaking the line". And in using the more modern
term, they miss teh key to Nelson\'s victory at Trafalgar:

Crossing the T is simply running your battleline in front of the other
fellows line, and bashing his front ships while only a few of his ships can
only use half their fire power on you.

What Nelson did was to cut into the French battleline, severing it. The back
half of the French fleet stopped - as teh English sailed by raking the
french in turn.  By teh time the front half of teh french fleet could turn
around and return, the brits had beaten up the back half and could turn
their whole strength on the front half.

But doesn\'t that take us back to that "sucked out it to space through the
hole in the wall" thing. And why use weapons on the ship when the ship is a
weapon. Besides the mess you have to clean up:-)

   This theory only holds water if you find ziggurats on Vland.  

   Of course this plotline was used by Battlestar Galactica to explain
the ancient Egyptians and Greeks.  Anyone remember the opening

Flashback was never released, but it had some interesting story ideas

and Marc Miller even chimed in with what he knew of it, but I appear to

I\'ve recently obtained a copy of T4 and used it for converting
my new CT campaign back from GURPS, which I used for the first
2-3 adventures.

Like many others, I didn\'t like the task system published in
the manual, and I\'m trying to substitute it with something which
retains some of its basic virtues:

- - Simple, fast, uses only D6 (or fractions of them!) 

and also attenuates some of its problems:

- - Too easy for PC and NPC, skills count a lot less than attributes.

What I came up with is a system lifted from the old Traveller 2300
system, and adapted to D6 and the T4/CT attributes scale. It\'s
probably similar to MT e TNE, but I don\'t own these games, so I
can\'t check them out. I dropped many of the more subtle aspects
of the original system (time for completing tasks and so on)
because I wanted something simple and fast.

Here is a first draft, please comment on it freely: I could have
missed a lot of obvious points, and I\'m still playtesting the thing.
Also, I read the Traveller list in digest form, so allow some
time before any answers to queries. 

I can be reached by e-mail at different addresses: the fastest
is mc4799@mclink.it.


Yatts: Yet another T4 task system. 
- ---- Beta Version ----

Basically, you divide the relevant attribute by half, rounding
up. You add the relevant skill (if any) and finally add 2D6,
trying to beat a task number.

The task scale becomes:

Easy      Auto/9+ (Automatic for skilled characters, like in T4)
Average     12+
Difficult   15+
Formidable  18+
Staggering  21+
Impossible  24+

Critical Failures
- ---- 
Rolling 2 on the 2D6 becomes a critical failure. If your
stat+skill is high enough to still get a success, the referee
may decide one of the following interpretations:
- - You succeed, but incur some related problem (i.e., you hit the target,
  and *then* the weapon jams)
- - You fail out of bad luck, no matter what.
- - You reroll but raise the difficulty by one level (e.g. from
  Difficult to Formidable). This one can be repeated up to
  Impossible and beyond (Just add 3 for the next level)

Critical Successes
- ---- 
Rolling 12 on the 2D6 becomes a critical success. You can apply
the same (vague) rules used in T4, for example a critical in
combat situation will double damage/halve armor.
You may also apply one of the following effects for tasks
unrelated to combat:
- - If you roll a critical and are still short of the task level,
  due to low skill/attrib., you can add another D6 to the roll.
  It\'s basically a semi-opened roll, but you can\'t add more that 1D6.
- - You reroll reducing the difficulty by one level (From
  Impossible to Staggering, for example). This can continue to reduce 
  the Difficulty level down to Easy 
- - You get it right, no matter what.


A small roundown of success chances will help you decide if the
system looks sound.

An average character (stats at 7) with professional level skill
(Skill level 3), will be column 7.

(Stat/2)+Skill |   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12
- ----|----
Task Difficulty|
Easy       (9+)|  42%  58%  72%  83%  92%  97%   A    A    A    A    A    A   
Average    12+ |   8%  17%  28%  42%  58%  72%  83%  92%  97%   A    A    A
Difficult  15+ |   I    I    3%   8%  17%  28%  42%  58%  72%  83%  92%  97%
Formidable 18+ |   I    I    I    I    I    3%   8%  17%  28%  42%  58%  72%
Staggering 21+ |   I    I    I    I    I    I    3%   8%  17%  28%  42%  58%
Impossible 24+ |   I    I    I    I    I    I    I    3%   8%  17%  28%  42%  

Where \'I\' means "Impossible without a critical success" and A
means "Automatic without a critical failure". 
Remember that skilled characters will not need to roll for Easy tasks.

Uncertain Tasks
- ----
Due to the new task system, some of the other basic mechanics
should be modified. For uncertain rolls, (like finding bugs in a
program or deciding if a given info is true) the referee and
player should each roll the 2d6. The referee roll should be secret.
Result:
Both fails: Complete failure, in the example, some or no bugs were found,
            and the program is still buggy.
Both succeed: Complete success. All the bugs are identified and
             no further problems will manifest.
One fails and the other succeed: Partial success. Some of the
bugs are found, but the program is not stable (and the player
will not know what the referee roll was, so he will be uncertain
of the true result.)

Known problems
- ----
High attributes will still help you a lot. The present system
doesn\'t penalize unskilled people using default skills. This way
Level-0 is not really much worse then Level-1, while the
original T4 gave quite different results on this.
For example a Skill-0 Brute will probably trash easily a
Brawling-1 amateur boxer. This is probably fine (and subtracting
the brawling-1 from the brute rolls will help a little, like
specified in the combat chapter), but perhaps some other
mechanics, like adding a flat "unskilled" penalty could be useful.
For now I prefer to keep things as simple as possible. 
On the other hand, "unskilled" and "Level-0" where not the same
thing in CT, and some of this still lingers on in T4.

Any suggestions?

   References to the "poorness" of TNE inevitably come from individuals
who disliked the plotline (Virus, rebuilding civilization), the more
complex game mechanics (D20, FF&S), or both.  Of course there are those
individuals who shall go nameless that hate *everything* released after
the original three little black books, but then they wouldn\'t know a
good sci-fi RPG if it bit them on the ass.

   My group splits time between TNE and Star Wars.  I run the TNE
games.  We use the Solomani Rim setting I created and had published in
Traveller Chronicle.  *Everyone* has a good time, and we are unlikely to
switch to T4 anytime soon (if ever).  TNE is quite simply the best
sci-fi RPG *ever* IMHO.  This is not to say that one day it won\'t be
topped (I had this same opinion of classic Traveller at one time), but
it is the best for now.  Is it perfect?  Hell no, but its flaws are
easily overlooked or fixed.

>it is thought to be lacking and what it is lacking in.  Just the ups 
>and down of it ocmpared to other Travellers.  Not trying to start any
>flames, just trying to round myself out.  

   What TNE needs (IMHO): 

1)  A new star system generation sequence.  The original version that
appeared in Book 6: Scouts was OK (and in some ways brilliant), but had
some big flaws.  TNE addressed some of the flaws, but in light of all
the new information we have about the way the Universe works, even the
revised B6 rules are now broken beyond repair.  This is an area where IG
can make T4 a superior product to TNE, if they are willing to do what is
necessary and don\'t just reprint B6 in another form.

2) Streamlined design systems for newbie and "gearhaters", and
automation in the form of official computer game aids for true
"gearheads".  This was probably the greatest shortcoming of the TNE game
mechanics.

3) Watercraft design rules.  None were ever put into print.

4) Better robot design rules.  Your typical Robot should not weigh
several hundred of kilos and consume more power in a day than many small
towns in the 20th century do in three.  Another area where T4 can
surpass TNE.

5) Minor tweaks to the small arms combat system.  Probably the most
suggested item is to find someway to make guns more lethal (roll D10
instead of D6 for damage, etc.), but there are other things that could
be done to make it better. 

   I have always been of the opinion that had TNE used the post-war
Spinward Marches c. 1200 as its primary setting and had a storyline that
revolved around the reunification of the Imperium without nuking the
landscape with Virus (though Virus could still have been used as a plot
device), TNE would have been much more popular with established fans. 
It may even still be in publication, if not by GDW then by IG or some
other company.  

   Ending one story and beginning a new one with, "and then everything
blew up", is no way to ensure customer loyalty, even if the basic plot
premise is a sound one.  TNE gets a lot of undeserved flak for this
reason.

Harold

Well, that was one reason, yes.  Boilers that were *holed* by weapons fire
probably wreaked the entire engine room when it happened.  At that point a
hole in a boiler wasn\'t the ship\'s biggest problem. ;->

OTOH, parts of the power train often went offline in an attack, or were
taken offline to prevent an explosive situation in the engine room.  When
the damage wasn\'t too severe they could be patched and restarted.  Didn\'t
one of the US carriers at Midway lose it\'s boilers during one of the
attacks, only to get them going again causing the Japanese some confusion
as to what they had or had not hit?

Sure, and a ship could take massive damage and keep steaming too. Just
depends on where those big hits landed.  

Mitchell, I\'m not saying you couldn\'t cripple a steam ship to the point
where it couldn\'t be repaired outside of a major ship yard. I\'m saying that
ships could take a lot of damage without be stopped, and that they *could*
make many repairs even in the heat of battle. You don\'t dispute that do
you?

Finally, the steam ship isn\'t what *I* would like to model here. I\'ve been
talking about an Age of Sail feel, and how to achieve that feel in
Traveller.  Someone else brought the steam era up, and pushed as being more
similar to Traveller technology.

Oh?  I don\'t recall seeing everyone posting their "severe doubts" about the

I suppose that means *you* couldn\'t think of a way to silence a ship\'s
weapons or take it\'s drive systems offline without destroying them.  That\'s
what I was asking for, and no I\'m not sure I\'ve got a way to do it either,
but I\'m still "thinking carefully." ;-> 

Hum, I think we\'re talking totally at cross purposes here.  You want to say
how things ARE, and perhaps convince me that that that\'s the only way they
can be.  I want to find a way to make things work the way I WANT them to
work, and perhaps I won\'t find a way.  I intend to keep looking though.

It appears we have different ideas about what we want from the game, and
different historical interpretations of naval warfare.  I think, perhaps,
we should just agree to disagree and leave it at that.

I haven\'t been able to run down Ironclads, what can you tell me about it?

You\'ve probably guessed that what I really want to do is find a way to make
boarding actions a viable option.  ;->

I don\'t want ships turning each other into useless hulks at k^5 ranges. 
Somehow or other, I\'d like to find a way for ships to have their drives
and/or weapons disabled without being completely wreaked.  That way there
would be both the opportunity and reason for close in and boarding actions. 
Any ideas?

There are *far* more complex things than that done *routinely* to make
food edible. 

Consider manioc (I think that\'s the name). You have to pound it to a
pulp, then dump the pulp into something like cheesecloth and rinse it
with water until the water is clear. Otherwise it\'s *poison*.

I rather suspect that this got discovered as a poison source
originally, and someone\'s kid got into the "leftover" pulp and
surprised everyone by living!

Not true! There is a hypothesis that inertia *is* "caused" by the
gravitational attracation of the rest of the universe! If I remember
correctly, this is known as "Mach\'s Principle".

Yep!

Actually, the *second* is defined as so many cycles of the frequency
produced by some specific energy transition in a specific isotope of a
specific element. The meter is a *derived* unit now. You get it by
using the value of a second and the *defined constant* for the speed of
light. Light is *defined* as moving at a specific velocity now. So one
meter is 1/299.... of the distance light travels in one second. 

The did this because the speed of light can be measured in a lab and so
can the period of that energy transition. That means that a lab can
check their gear fairly closely *without* having to bring in a
"certified standard meter stick".

I can actualy give a "good" reason for keeping the AU!

You see, the *parsec* is defined in terms of AU! Seriously! A parsec is
the distance at which a 2 AU baseline gives a 1 second of arc parallax.
(therefore 1 parsec is *exactly* arctan(1") AUs).

Since the parsec is a "critical" measurement, AUs stick. 

The above is true, though humorously intended. But I can actually make
a case for keeping AUs *because* of the relation to parsecs. When
conducting an *astronomical* survey of a region you intend to move
into, that 2 AU baseline letting you *directly* measure distance in
terms of parsecs.

I forget the details of the calculation, but this is
why astronomers use both Parsecs and AUs. Using the 2 AU *diameter* of
Earth\'s orbit makes both AU\'s and parsecs "exact" units. That is, you
can specify distance in terms of AUs and parsecs to high accuracy, even
though you aren\'t certain how long an AU is!

So, since determing the distance of other stars from your starting
point is a *fundamental* step in getting ready to visit them, setting
up observatories (or at least well equipped ships) *exactly* 2 AU apart
(measure with laser interferometers) would be something that the
terrans would have used for a long, long time. Given that jump 1 works
out to be about a parsec means that the unit would stick. So therefore
the AU would stick.

Anybody want to publish an article on *why* the Imperium uses parsecs,
AUs, days divided into 24 hours, years divided into 12 months, etc? I
bet I could write one....

Yes, they were. They were spread out amongst 2 or 3 Challenge

That was the idea. Here is the basic draft as it was proposed:

Fast Forward

The crew of the starship Traveller is contaminated by a slow acting poison
with no known cure. Captain Mark Leonard has put them all into cold sleep;
they come out every century or so to see if a cure has been found.

Brief Summary
Commander Mark Leonards exploration squadron, exploring the depths of the
just conquered Vilani Empire, has discovered an abandoned naval base on a
remote world, and in a repair facility: a huge Battle Cruiser. While
preparing to take it back to base, they are attacked and all of Commander
Leonards crew are contaminated by a deadly, slow acting poison.
Theyll all die within five years unless an antidote can be found. They do
some searching, but they find no one has the answer.
So he puts everyone into cold sleep, and a skeleton crew comes out every
century or so to see if the answer has been found. As they Fast Forward
through the future, they have a long list of adventures.

During the next 2000 years (about 2300 AD to 4500 AD) the crew of the
Traveller will come out of cold sleep every so often in search of a cure.
Along the way, they will witness the broad expanse of history as The Rule of
Man collapses and the Long Night begins. Much later, the Long Night ends and
the Third Imperium begins. At every important point in history, Leonard is
there helping, shaping, creating history.

The Rule of Man	2317 AD	to 2745 AD
The Long Night	2745 AD	to 4521 AD
The Third Imperium	4521 AD	to 

Threads for Adventures include:
7 The Medical Research Foundation
7 The Archives
7 The Ship
7 Grandfather
7 Unfolding History
 
The Foundation
Commander Leonard loads up equipment from the abandoned base and sells it to
generate money. He uses that money to create and endow a medical foundation
(Lishun, meaning Health) to research the cure. While he and his crew sleep,
they should be working feverishly for the answer he needs.

7 Leonard visits the foundation and finds it has committed its limited
resources to an environmental problem on Sternin, and within a few years they
will have a cure that will save millions of lives. But not the crew of the
Traveller.
7 Leonard visits the foundation and finds that its investments have gone sour
with the collapse of the Rule of Man. The foundation will have to close its
doors.

The Archives
The Vilani Empire maintained massive archives (by which it controlled access
to knowledge). This AAB has repositories on many worlds. By visiting the
archives, Leonard may be able to find clues to a world which already has the
cure he seeks.

7 An archive visit leads to a world with faith healers.
7 The opportunity to transcend physical bodies and become one with the
universe. Some of the crew will take that option rather than face certain
death.
7 An archive visit leads to a world with non-corporeal solutions. Those who
choose it become disembodied and move on to the next level of existence.
7 An archive visit leads to a world with robotic solutions. Those who choose
it have their minds transplanted into artificial bodies.
7 Transplant personalities into a computer universe.

 
The Ship
Initially, Leonard and his staff think the ship was built by the Old Empire
as a secret project or a prototype.

7 They discover the ship does not match any ship in the records of the Old
Empire. It is not a Vilani ship, but instead created by someone else.
7 They discover the ships computer has artificial intelligence, and slowly
puzzle out its memory.
7 Discordant signals within the ship prompt Leonard to explore a vast hidden
closed off area and find new properties for the ship.

The ultimate answer: the Traveller (the huge ship) was originally created by
the Ancient Yaskoydray (Grandfather) for a special project. It is controlled
by an artificial intelligence that 

Grandfather
The being that put humans on many worlds is Grandfather. He still roams space
and interacts in the lives of humans from time to time.

7 Find an Ancient Site... a massive, high-tech place on a world, now
destroyed by some long-ago war. Establish who the ancients are.
7 Find an ancient ship drifting in space. Note some similarities with the
Traveller.
7 They are enlisted by a robot emissary of Grandfather to ....

Unfolding and Shaping History.
As time passes, the current government and society collapses. Leonard and his
staff can see it coming, and they want to help delay that until the cure is
found. Although they are unsuccessful, they have a hand in several key events
in history.
  
Restatement
INTROM Commander Mark Leonard\'s Deep Space Squadron 489, exploring the vast
territory of the just conquered Vilani Empire, discovers an abandoned naval
base on a remote world, and in a repair facility: a huge Battle Cruiser.
While Cdr Leonard\'s squadron crews prepare to take it back to base, they are
attacked by armed raiders from TTT (Terran Trade and Transport), a shady
combine with more regard for profit than for morals. Leonard drives them off,
but the BC is damaged and his entire crew (with the exception of Leonard) are
contaminated by a deadly, slow acting poison.
Faced with the certain death of his entire crew within five years, Leonard
puts them in cold sleep, keeping out only a few dozen out to help run the
ship. His initial strategy is to search the empire for an antidote, but that
plan soon changes: Leonard finds a world, brings in a cargo worth a lot of
money, and uses the funds to endow a medical research foundation to research
a cure. He takes the ship and hides it, coming out every 100 years or so in
hopes that a cure has been found.

Well, after double checking my design, the 10mm snub really ends up at a 6,
which will still punch through most armor, but not bulkheads.  as for those
damn Marines boarding you.. good luck.

There might be any number of reasons why one would need to use handheld
weapons onboard ship.  Perhaps the computer is being finicky or has been
damages, rendering the old "crank up the Grav plates" option useless.  Maybe
the bad guys already have Engineering, and you need to take it back.

Not IMO. There\'s a gravity pulse (plus any signals the ship is 
emitting), but you\'d only see it if you were looking.

You get a huge energy pulse, proportional to the size of ship and 
distance jumped. Assuming you know the stats of the ship, you can 
estimate the distance (but not direction).

No.  It\'s the job of a scalable system to provide a level for low detail
which still has *some* foundation in the game system.  As I stated before:
I\'m new to Traveller and if I\'d start to create ships from my imagination
I probably would add up with stuff incompatible to the Traveller rules.
Should I decide at a later point that I want more detail I would have
created a big mess.  My players probably by then are accustomed to those
ships and to some detail and now -- when they want more -- they have to
learn that my made-up stuff just doesn\'t work within the system.

Not a good approach.  Please note: I\'m asking for a simple system for new
players... you old-time fans probably have no problems winging it.  For us
newbies it\'s just not possible.

That\'s your opinion and it is as valid as mine.  It\'s not more true pr
false by any means though.

I *never* said that I wanted to only have the minimal approach (and I took
great care to do that).  Reread my post.  Marc Miller simply stated that
T4 should be scalable and current the ship design system is missing a
basic level.  Sorry, but you simply can\'t scale it down to quick-and-dirty
designs (except by practicing a lot... maybe... but that\'s scaling by
practice).

You should take a look at recent roleplaying games.  Most of them try to
become simpler.  Gamers *want* simple and easy to learn games.  If the
games allow to add more complexity later, that\'s fine.

Look at the SAGA System, Over The Edge, Castle Falkenstein, Feng Shui,
FUDGE and many other systems.  All of them are very simple to learn and
they all are selling to some extent or another.  Even Champions/HERO will
be released in a simpler system (ok, that\'s their intention -- if they
succeed is another question).  Games these days are more targetted at
providing enough mechanics to tell a good story in a reasonable frame of
reality... the mechanics-heavy games right now seem to be on the decline.

> The rules are what you make of them, the rules are not a straightjacket,

But the rules should allow various levels of detail... at least if the
designer states that this is one of the five primary design goals.
Otherwise this goal probably should have been omitted.

Where is my place in that system?  I want a simple, quick\'n dirty system
for occasional ship designs which don\'t need to be *that* close to the one
true set of values.  QSDS simply doesn\'t fit the bill, sorry.

Telling me to wing the rules is as good as telling me to write my own set
of rules.  I want a somewhat consistent system and not something made up
from air.  Then I\'d be playing FUDGE or Over The Edge.

Yes, me too.  But the most simple level still is missing.

That\'s the reason why I don\'t weant to simply make up numbers.  I want to
start with basic numbers and as soon as my players (and I) get interested
in more detail I\'d like to upgrade to QSDS and if we want even more detail
we\'d be using SSDS and if we would like to go totally overboard we\'d be
using FFS.  Currently I have nothing to start out with.  Remember: I\'m
looking at this from a newbie\'s point of view.  Most people on this list
sadly seem to be too experienced with Traveller to see the problems a
newbie can have with the current systems.  Sad but true over and over
again.

That\'s also a problem I think I have failed to mention up to now.  I just
can voice this concern, too.

This is probably an interesting alternative to using much simpler numbers:
use percentages (not wildly broken ones like 57,34% please; use simple
ones like 10%, 15%; this keeps the numbers in a somewhat state).

Definitely.

That\'s also one of the main problems I see.  I sketched out some
simplifications in an email to Derek concerning this (e. g. drop the power
requirements for quarters, adjust the cost factors a little bit so that
all the math can be done *very* quickly; don\'t even think about the cost 
for bunks -- it\'s just too much hazzle, etc.).

    'body' => 'I just went over to David Blustein\'s rendition of Commander X\'s qsds
walkthrough, and it looks quite nice, except for one thing. This will also
address other complaints regarding QSDS involving interpolation.

QSDS started life, lo these many eon\'s ago (like last March or so ;-) as
one version of \'FFS Lite\', a way to modularize FFS into a table-driven
design system. The theory is that you build your starship by picking one
from column A, two from column B, and with parties of 8 or more you get
Spinal PAWS. 

The cost reductions of QSDS, as stated clearly in the design system, are
due to using standardized plug \'n\' play componentry. 

The design for the scout/courier in the walkthrough follows QSDS until it
comes time for putting in the power plant. Then Cmdr. X interpolated
between standard components in the power plant tables to arrive at a 133
Mw powerplant. This isn\'t kosher...you can only use the powerplants shown
on the tables, so for the scout courier, you end up with the closest whole
10 Mw power rating over 133Mw you can get, by installing a 100, and 2 20
Mw modules, for a total of 140 Mw. 

An analogy would be walking into Checker Auto Parts and asking for an
alternator for your 86 Chevy something-or-another. They may ask you if you
want the 50 or 60 amp model...you\'ve calculated that you need a 55 amp
one, so you aske them to shave some of the windings off the 60 amp one to
make it 55 amps. They\'ll look at you like you were insane, back away from
the counter a bit, and say you have a choice, 50 or 60 amps...which is it?

This makes a difference in fuel ratings, volume used, and cost, because,
if you install a custom 133 Mw power plant, you pay full nickel for that,
not the QSDS discount!

Plant	Volume	Fuel	Cost(actual, after QSDS discount)
133 Mw	4.8	1.4*	13.3
140 Mw	5.0	1.5	10.5

*Using corrected QSDS v1.4 stats, and T4 errata, using uncorrected T4
rules, both plants use 0.7 dT.

	So, you get 7 Mw extra power, at the cost of 0.2 dT cargo space,
and at a SAVINGS of almost 3Mcr.

In short, interpolation is a no no in QSDS design. You may not get the
highest design efficiency of using custom-fitted components, but you do
gain the relative ease of design that lookup tables can provide, if you\'re
not someone who finds using formulae easier than tables.

This is not to say, of course, that the Imperium had a standardized 133 Mw
plant for all those gazillions of Scout/Couriers out on loan to
disgraced...errr, I mean  <RETIRED> scouts littering the spaceways. When a
Government agency buys that many of anything, no matter how weirdly
designed, they become \'standardized\' components, but that\'s another issue
entirely, and doesn\'t have to do with QSDS.

Depends on the weapons used. :-)

If the torus is big enough, a fusion gun with short range would do

And there\'s your mistake. If you have a scoutship like that, you can
determine the target star\'s position *more* than accurately enough with
the help of another ship sitting an AU or so away. You can do this for
stars *far* outside your jump range (say 100 parsecs).

All by yourself you can determine if there are gas giants, but an
observatory 10-20 parsecs away (an observatory in *space*) can do
better. It can detect planets. Heck, it can *image* planets at that
range! Heck, working from under this thick atmosphere *we* can detect
gas giants at those ranges!

So even a scout making the first Imperial survey of a sector will know
where there are gas giants and have *some* idea of whether or not there
are planets of decent size.

The 2000 solar radii is *easy*. Not a problem at all. 10 planetary
diameters is not going to happen simply because you can\'t jump that
close to *anything*. The 100 diameter limit works both ways.

Not a problem since even a scout working alone can get close enough for

If the misjump is due to a malfunction, you are generally screwed
regardless. I assume that you are thinking that the ship "misjumped" by
jumping to the wrong spot (ie it wound up where they aimed, but that
wasn\'t where they thought they were aiming). As I show above, that
requires *extraordinary* incompetence. Much like a modern day navigator
making a 1000 mile error in determinig his position. It can happen, but
it\'s not anything people are worried about.

It could *majorly* destabilize the local culture. I refer you to
Christopher Anvil\'s story "The Royal Road". It\'s one of his many set in
his "Interstellar Patrol" universe. Unfortunately, almost none of his
stuff ever made it to paperback. 

Anyway, the idea is that if you pay wages to the natives for work on a
major project, this means that they aren\'t out there growing crops.
After all, in low tech societies the pool of people willing to drop
what they normally do to do the sort of manual labor in question are
the farmers, not the craftsmen! Though you\'ll get some "craft" people
on the jobs that use their skills. But the unskilled labor will be
farmers. 

Remember that it isn\'t until you get fairly high tech (Renaisance to
Napoleonic era) that you can *have* large numbers of non-farmers.

So why does this disrupt the culture? Well, if the farmers aren\'t
farming, what do people eat come harvest time?

In a "subsistence" level economy (typical of just about everything
earlier than the late middle ages) diverting *anyone* from food
production is going to result in starvation. 

Cultures that do better can support cities, and even rulers, etc.
But they can\'t support armies during planting and harvest. Not without
famine. 

We tend to overlook this. But it\'s why the fighting in Africa *leads*
to famine (also why the food sent for aid tends to get stopped by the
government, they know that it will let the rebels fight longer even if
none of it goes to any combatants) 

Most *rulers* will know this. And they won\'t *let* their people work
for you except at the slack times for farming. If they can\'t stop it,
they\'ll fight, because they know (better than the people do!) what will
happen when everyone who figured that they could leave the farm and buy
food from the *other* farmers realizes that the "other" farmers did the
same thing!

The high-tech folks who overlook this "minor" detail will be faced with
the choice of importing *huge* amounts of food (and doing so until the
farms can get back on their feet) or facing some *very( angry locals
who figure that the high-tech folks are responsible for them starving.

Hell, most of the people in the State Department don\'t realize this
effect exists. I think every single one of the countries that gives
"economic aid" in the form of financing local infrastructure work has
done this at least once. And I\'m talking about since WWII!

A smart local ruler can even take advantage of this by offering higher
grain prices to his farmers and otherwise "discouraging" his people
from working on the project, but allowing people from neighboring areas
to work on it. Thus, he\'ll wind up with the project done, and a corner
on the food market. Shortly after that, he\'ll be ruling those
neighboring areas. :-)

        Not ever having played TNE, I\'m curious as to why you think it\'s so
good.  I\'ve been pondering game systems for a while, trying to come up with
a truly universal, flexible system that has the best features of the games
I\'ve played so far...  I tend to lean more towards a certain amount of
complexity (at the moment I\'m leaning towards a success-based system like
StoryTeller, but with d20\'s and more resolution in the stats).  What, in
your opinion, makes TNE so good?

        Not neccessarily; if we postulate a small group of Vilani getting
the h*** out of Dodge for whatever reason, without much gear, ziggurats
still make sense; given primitive materials and construction techniques,
building a tall building by piling up rocks in a pyramidal shape is a
no-brainer.  The Aztecs did it that way and so did the Egyptians.  The
Vilani-inspired Sumerians merely put more noticeable steps on theirs
because it gives more usable surface area.

        Well, according to the info I have, the Vilani developed jump drive
at approx 4750 BC.  It\'s a stretch, but not impossible, that a bunch of
dissident Vilani who didn\'t want to get eaten (or whatever :>) managed to
grab a ship or two and head for Splitsville, in time to influence the
Sumerians or Assyrians...  my recollection of the history of that area is
fairly fuzzy, tho.

I agree. I felt, when I first saw his complaints on RGF.Misc, that he
was basically just one the many upset customers who, if IG simply took
note and made the appropriate changes in their way of doing business,
would come back into the fold, satisfied that he had done his part to
nudge IG into becoming a better company. Instead of listening to his
complaints, however, IG\'s response was... in my opinion... somewhat
less than satisfactory.

Hmm... interesting thesis. Since Michael isn\'t here to defend himself,
maybe it would be appropriate to simply repost Ken\'s remarks and let
people judge for themselves.

pound for pound on manpower, Imperium Games spends more time informing the
Traveller fans then most other RPG companies.  If some of you really are
TRAVLLER FANS LIKE YOU SAY YOU ARE, THEN WHY DO YOU NOT SUBSCRIBE TO THE
TRAVELLER MAILING LIST.  Then you would have been informed of our moving
plans.  

Next, IG does not tell everyone of our day to day business.  Therefore,
when we moved, we did not expect people to panic.

Secondly, we are not late on our future products, our release date is
SEP.  I belive there is a week or so left.  As for hard covers, we are
having Marc Miller sign them, and it is taking some time.

I feel that others who like starting rumers are only showing their own
insecurities and anger to the world.  Just because you have failed several
time in you life, dont belive everyone else is like you.  GET A GRIP!

Now, put yourself in Michael\'s shoes for just a moment. He\'s plopped down
a lump of cash and has been been waiting X # of months for T4 to arrive
in the mail. He\'s been waiting... and waiting... and lo and behold, IG\'s
website mysteriously vanishes and they stop answer their phones. What
would be your conclusion? What would be anybody\'s conclusion? In his
mind, IG took his money and then folded. He\'s a little annoyed. So,
he decides to post his theory to the net, citing his evidence as is
appropriate. Was this wrong to do? Wouldn\'t you do the same thing?
And then, pretending that you\'re Michael, when IG\'s _President_ posts
the response I\'ve included above, just how would _you_ feel? How
would _anybody_ feel?

Take this as a rhetorical question if you like. I\'m not really expecting
a response, but before you or anyone else decides to bad-mouth Michael on
this list while he isn\'t even here to defend himself, I would like you,
for just one moment, to appreciate the position he was put by IG\'s actions
with respect to taking his money months prior to shipping (which is,
incidentally, illegal) and then responding to his concerns in a fashion
which can only be described as... well... as TSR-like (which is fitting,
considering that\'s where Ken was once employeed).

Y\'know what? The whole thing could have been nipped in the bud if Marc
Miller had gotten online back in September and said, "I can\'t believe
what Ken just wrote. Michael, on behalf of the company, I\'d like to
apologize, and I\'d like to offer you a little something extra with
your order. Please contact me via email." That\'s all it would have
taken, and IG would have had a customer for life.

There\'s a moral to this story that I think is worth learning, and it\'s
not that Michael Richter is a jerk. The moral is that if you piss off
one customer, and allow them to stay pissed off, they can drive away
a hundred others, and the only loser will be you. The corollary,
fortunately, is that the reverse is also true. If you show a customer
respect, show them that you actually do care about their business,
they will bring their friends to your store, and you will grow
prosperous. In short, it\'s all about respect. Now back to our
regularly scheduled flame-fest.

PS: Ken, my apologies for reposting something that you probably
never wanted to see again. This wasn\'t meant an a personal attack

something that I feel shouldn\'t have happened in the first place.

Some circa 2000 AD Terran cultures use measurement systems that were 
in use circa 1 AD. That\'s about the same separation one finds 
between The Rule of Man and The Third Imperium.


There\'s not much reason to abbreviate _pounds_ as _lbs._ other than 
for historical reasons, is there?


After Alexander the Great, some regions adopted aspects of Hellenic
culture, because that culture was considered to be "better".

After the Roman Empire, later cultures identified themselves 
with that culture for similar reasons.


The Syleans seek to emulate Terran culture, since everybody knows
that the Terrans conquered the Vilani. (and who wants to be a
*loser*!? :-)


With respect to other measurement systems, like calendars,
planet-locked cultures normally choose dating systems based on the
appearant movements of satellites (like the Moon) or stars (like the
Sun). Most historical Terran calendars are Solar or Lunar. (I\'m sure
someone out there can find one that isn\'t, so ... :-) A Solar or
Lunar calendar is useful because either of these objects are
*easily* observable from the surface of the Earth. (with the
notable exception of bad weather :-)

It seems to me that a mature interstellar culture would create a
calendar based on some phenomenon that is easily observable from
every world in the area (subsector, sector, domain, or empire-wide).
What interstellar phenomenon do we know of that can be easily
observed *from planetary orbit or higher* in multiple star systems
with TL-9+ technology?

	If you can\'t accurately plot to come out around the star within 2000 times
the star\'s radius, then you shouldn\'t be flying a starship. 2000 times the
Sun\'s radius gives you a sphere out ot the orbit of Saturn. Plenty of room!

	Incidentally, when I wrote that paragraph, I could swear I\'d put it as
2,000 solar DIAMETERS, which would let you get all the way out to Uranus.

	You won\'t require a second maneuver drive unless you plan on skulking
around in the far outer system. Like a military ship. And most military
ships probably WILL have an auxiliary HEPlaR drive for an extra "oomph"
during combat.

	The fuel requirements for jump were chosen deliberately to be the same as
for Classic and MegaTraveller. Your average ship does NOT and never has
carried sufficient fuel for multiple max-distance jumps. This is intentional.

	The only reason TNE changed the jump fuel requirements was because it did
not have thrusters as the standard drive system, instead using more
"realistic" reaction-mass based drives which required huge quantities of fuel.

	The only valid concern mentioned above was a misjump into deep
space--that\'s always left you in deep smelly stuff in Traveller. You don\'t
have the fuel for a second jump, and even with reactionless thrusters that
aren\'t affected by gravity, it\'ll take you longer than you have power to
get anywhere. So it\'s not a change at all to the "feel" of the Traveller
universe.

	If it really bothers you, you can rule that a jump exit MUST be made at
the same gravitational stress level as the jump entry, guaranteeing that
the ship reenters in a star system.

 I don\'t know of anything beyond the random sound-combo
 generation stuff that appears in the Alien Modules/
 MegaTraveller Alien, plus one document with translation
 from Gvegh (a spinward Vargr language) in the GDW Vargr
 module.  I\'ve had a nagging idea that this should be something
 that gets done, but I\'ve never gotten to it.

 If people are interested in actually tackling a project of this
 type, send me private e-mail - if there\'s enough interest, I
 can start up a list, and we can have at it.

 Just briefly - a language must have a set of sounds that are
 anatomically possible for the beings that speak it, and it must
 have rules for combining them in ways that are anatomically
 possible. It must have a writing system (or at least a
 reasonable and consistent method of transcribing into the
 common language of those who are studying/creating it).  It
 must have a grammar, and it must have a vocabulary - and the
 grammar and vocabulary must be compatible with the phonology.
 The grammar and the vocabulary should be internally
 self-consistent, and consistent with the psychological
 world-view of the speakers.  When you have all that, you have a
 language that feels realistic and can actually be used - Marc
 Okrand\'s Klingon (tlhIngan Hol) is an example of this, as
 contrasted with most other partially-developed Star Trek
 languages, which are only funny encodings of English, if even
 that much.

 I\'m game if you are...

My fix for the task resolution system is to replace the raw Characteristic
with (5+ (characteristic/4)), with fractions rounded off normally; e.g. A
character with a Dexterity of A and Pilot-2 will have a target number of 10
(5 + (10/4) +2).This closes the competency gap between less gifted
characters and savants, and puts more emphasis on skills.  

Additionally, I use a sequence of 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, and 6D for Average,
Difficult, Formidable, Staggering, and Impossible Tasks, respectively. 
Even a character with an F characteristic will need a high skill level to
succeed at an Impossible Task.  

The highest attainable skill level is 12; a character with a skill-12 will
have a target number between 17 and 21.  He will be able to routinely pull
off Impossible Tasks; which, given the rarity of such characters in my
campaign (read: none), doesn\'t bother me.

The standard sizes (according to Charles Derrick\'s "Rise and Progress
of the Royal Navy", 1806) the standard calibres were 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24,
32 and 42 pdr cannon and 32 and 64 pdr carronades (see even a dyslexic
like me can spell sometimes <g>). The 3, 6, 9 and 24 pdr cannon were
abandoned in 1743, the 42 pdr in 1781 (it was less effective than the 32
pdr due to ROF) and in 1825 the RN standardised on only 32 pdr cannon
and 64 pdr carronades, with differing barrel lengths depending on the
deck the guns were mounted on (longer barrels on lower decks). The
Carronade was largely abandoned on warships after 1800, its
disadvantages outweighed its advantages in a strict military sense
(most warships would still carry a few, but the main weapon was the
cannon). But it remained a very popular weapon for merchantmen.

Even a dyed in the wool pro RN nut like me can acknowledge that the
Constitution was (and still is, by all accounts) a very fine ship, with a
very fine crew. Our US cousins have every reason to be proud of her.
The main advantage of the Constitution (and the other large frigates
such as Constellation, President et al) was their size, 50 guns as
against the usual RN 36; when the RN deployed their own 50\'s in
1813-14 the US ships acted a lot more circumspectely. Here is an
example of the advantages the "lesser" naval power can exploit: the
RN with its world wide commitments had chosen to build a large
number of frigates sacrifising individual fighting ability for quantity, where
as the USN without the world wide commitments was able to build for
individual quality, giving them fewer superior ships (a situation similiar
to that of the Japanese during the 2nd WW). The USN could not have
hoped to challange the overall RN command of the sea, but could put
a very serious crimp in it, making it too expensive for the British to fight
them (the "Riskflot" strategy). Interesting the US long range tactic were
in a large part dictated by their own inferiority in boarding actions. The RN
crews held a slight edge due to experience and even if a USN ship won
a boarding action, the crew casualties would have forced her back to port.

Its important to remember that the lessons of the War of 1812 are
likely to still be valid in space even some 3000 years from now.
The dominant Navy is going to have to go for quantity to meet all
its obligations, the lesser navy can afford to go for quality. As long as
the lesser navy sticks to commerce warfare (heres were you want
those damn battlecruisers <g>), it can theoretically make it too costly
for the dominant power to fight it. Lesser Navies will not build battlships
(well the smart ones won\'t), they\'ll build large commerce raiders.

Jeff, I looked through my Challenge magazines and discovered those wet
navy rules were written for MegaTraveller. My apologies; I would have
bet money they were written for TNE. If you still interested in them,
they can be found in Challenge #53, 54, and 60 (they were published in
three parts).

An additional MT rule set for *early* tech (sailing ships, catapults,
cured hide canoes, primitive reciprocating steam engines, etc.) can be
found in Challenge #61. This last issue also has an adventure in which
the player characters end up on Aramanx/Spinward Marches and, thanks
to Ling Standard Products, mix it up with a TL6 wet navy fleet,
including a nuclear sub, light cruisers and a freaking aircraft
carrier!

   Wrong.  The stuff that appeared in Challenge was created for
MegaTraveller, not TNE.  The author was Terry McInnes, the same guy who
wrote COACC.

WHOA!  I did _not_ do this!  I used  75Mw+50Mw palnts to come up with
125Mw.  Apparently David did not understand something in the
walkthrough(bad student! no biscuit! <g> ), or decided to come up with
the interpolation himself.  I understand that QSDS is a "modular"
system.  One reason I like it is so that I dont have to do equations and
such (I am a typical gamer, very lazy <g>).

Bruce, I thank you for pointing this out to me, I did not notice it the
first time I saw David\'s page. 

David, I still love your work on the page, it is excellent HTML.  It
might have been something I would do if i had had the time.  But I would
have words with you on IRC, in short, you did good with the page, but
did bad with the power, so........aw ok, I\'ll give you 1/2 a biscuit! :)

Hey spare a though for us out here in the colonies. We\'re

Here\'s a really *sick*, *twisted* lost colony scenario that occured to
me when coming up with the scenario outline for the above bit.

Assume that some of the humans Grandfather transplanted were given
actual *training* and education by his children. That may even be *why*
he went after them. So they *started* with a low level of civilization
and legends about the "Gods".

Given Grandfather\'s anger, he\'d naturally have to go after these humans
as well. Some of the grandchildren would trained them managed to send
them out of reach using a sort of cross between jump drive and
Grandfather\'s "gates". But not before Grandfather sent some
semi-autonomous robots after them, but due to the experimental nature
of the gate, the robots came out a sector or so away from the humans.
But the robots have some idea of where the humans are.

So the robots have to set up shop on a planet and make more ships and
robots so that they can find and wipe out the humans. Building the
infrastructure takes a few thousand years.

Meanwhile the humans establish themselves on the worlds of a cluster of
a dozen close stars. They quickly gain slower than light travel between
their systems (a thousand or two years). And they advance even more in
technology. 

Finally their expansion meets the wave of robots who want to wipe them
out. Battles are fought, one side or the other pulls back to regroup
and rebuild and then expand again years later. So the war goes down the
centuries. And both sides trade with aliens and sometimes ally with
them. 

Finally a human allies with the robots and helps them convince the
leaders of the humans that peace is possible. The human leaders show up
for the signing of the treaty and are wiped out along with most of the
colonial fleets. 

A major ship escapes and returns home only to find that the colonies
have been attacked as well. They organize an evacuation of the few
survivors using any ships that will fly, jump capable or not. 

They then try to find their planet of origin (Earth) which they have
dim legends about, while evading the robots and fighting only when they
have to. 

They were far to rimward, but are approaching the Solomani Sphere...
Your players are making contact. It\'d be even better if you can get
another group to play the refugee fleet.

Of course, they\'d use slightly different rules, and so would the
robots. :-)

For anyone who hasn\'t figured it out yet, the above is putting a well
known SF TV program into Traveller... Battlestar Galactica! 
(Are there any RPG rules for it?) The robots are the Cylons. The
refugees are the Colonials. 

Hey, I *warned* you that it was sick and twisted.

Recoil is a big problem there. I\'d use the Acme Industries Fusion
Lance. 

The Fusion Lance originated when a crewman on a salvage ship didn\'t
have a weapon handy and grabbed one of the salvage tools. The tool was
descended from the TL-7 "thermal lance" and the TL-7 "plasma arc
torch". It it was intended for *quickly burning thru superdense hull
plates and bulkheads. The "flame" is adjustable from a few cm to
several meters. And it cuts thru superdense faster than a chainsaw cuts
thru logs! Naturally, it cuts thru battle dress almost as fast as you
can swing it. 

The weapon version has a flame limited to only a meter, so as to make
accidently cutting the hull less likely. And they have limited
duration. Only about 5-10 minutes. But it can be used in "bursts".

The lance looks like a 2 meter length of thick pipe (about 10 cm) which
some cables and a backpack with quick release buckles (as you want to
get rid of it *fast* when it runs empty). 

This *should* be a possible device, but will the rules allow it?

I\'ve often wished for such a design sequence! But I\'ve never tracked

Frankly, the stereotypical "human sized and shaped" robot (C3PO, for
example) is going to be *weaker* than a human, unless made of
"unobtanium".  

You see, motors and the powerpacks for them weigh more than the
equivalent body tissues. And bone is *stronger* than steel. You see,
bone is a *very* advanced composite material, developed over a biliion
years of stress testing. :-)

So the robot *will* be heavier, or it will be weaker. Or the material
it is made of will be *so* superior to anything we have that they\'d
make noticeable differences in other areas like weapons and vehicles.

One of the Mayan calendar cycles is 260 days long. It\'s composed of two
sub-cycles one is 20 days (the Mayans used base 20) and the other is 13
days.

Pulsars have relatively constant periods, but they are *way* to short.
(seconds or less) The only other periodic phenomenon observable over
wide distances is a a Cepheid variable. But they have periods depending
on their mass. So you have a *wide* range to choose from.

But there\'s a slight problem. Speed of light lag means that every star
sees the Cepheid you pick at a *different* part of its cycle. Now add
in relativity and the fact that the stars are moving at different
speeds. "At the same time" is a *meaningless* concept when dealing
with places any distance apart.

You know, this could make a *wonderful* adventure for the right time
period. The players stumble across some old Vilani records of a missing
expedition that was checking out a clue found in some Ancient
artifacts. What really gets their attention is that adjusted for star
movement, the target looks to be somewhere in an area that included Sol.

Then one of the researchers forgets to limit *which* databases to
search for other references to the crew and ship. One of the partial
matches that turns up is some Sumerian mythology. This leads to one of
those "No, it can\'t be... can it?" moments.

Meanwhile, archeologists on Terra have found some *very* strange
artifacts at a dig and cryptic references that may point to another
site... SolSec is *not* pleased with some of the possibilities, but
they support the research because if there *was* Vilani contact, they
want to be able to grab the evidence!

But the researchers don\'t like the secrecy imposed. And they are upset
about the comments their colleagues keep making about their silly
"Danikenite" theories. Which tempts them even more to let the secret
info slip.

Will one group find the proof first? Will they run into each other at
some remote site? The possibilities are endless. And more fun than
"Raiders of the Lost Ark".

of Sylea 219-112)

History tells us that the first contact between the Solomani
and Vilani was around Barnards Star in -2,422 (2096AD in the
Solomani system). But is this the whole truth? Terra lies just
2 parsecs outside the limits of the Ziru Sirka, a mere 6.52
light years; Gashidda, the provincial capital, just 22.82 light
years away. The Vilani absorbed the Vegans in -4,404 (114AD)
and that the Ziru Sirka had stopped expansion by -4,000 (518AD).
Is it reasonable to believe that for approximately 2,000 years
the Vilani and Solomani remained blisfully unware of each other?
That for 2,000 years not one curious Vilani trader ventured
over the border, that for 2,000 years not one ship misjumped to
Terra, that during the conquest of the Vegans not one scout
ventured out to check? It would seem very unlikely that Vilani
eyes did not look on Terra at least once before 2096AD.

However, is ths significant? Probably not. The Solomani for
most of this period would have appeared to be just another
primitve minor race, their industrial revolotion did not
begin until about -2,870 (1784AD). Who amongst the Vilani
could have predicted that over just 300 years the Solomani
would leap from Tech level 3 to Tech level 9? Some have
claimed that the Vilani are in fact responsible for the first
Solomani civilisations (based on a superficial similiarity
between Vilani and Cuniform), but this is unlikely. The
Summerians achived their civilisation in about -7,520 (3000BC)
and are clearly the decendents of a long line of predecessors
on Terra. The Vilani did not develop jump 2 technology until
- -5,430 (912BC) and did not reach the Solomani rim until much
later. It is likely that the Vilani did visit Terra before
2096AD; and if one were to do a thorough search of the records
of the Argushiigi Admegulasha Bilanidin one might just find
a footnote recording Terra; but it is doubtful that the Vilani
would have shown much interest in the primitive Solomani.

But before one totally dismisses this line of thought, let us
look at the other side of the equation. Were the Solomani
aware of the Vilani? At first this might seem like a ludicrous
statement. How could the prestellar Solomani have any idea of
the mighty civilisation that lay just beyond their doorstep?
They certainly could not have contacted it, the Vilani appear
not to have contacted them (at least not in any meaningful
sense). The answer comes in one word, radio. The Solomani could
have heard the Vilani. Farfetched you say? On the face of it yes.
Vilani radio transmissions were not aimed at Terra, just
background noise in all the millions of other radio signals that
exist in the universe; they were in a totally alien language,
using totally alien protocols; surely any Solomani who acidentally
stumbled across these signals would not have realised their
significance. This is the conventional wisdom, but my recent
research has shown another interesting possiblility. There existed
on Terra during their 20th Century an organisation called the Setii.
A brotherhood of Solomani astronmers who were actively searching
the heveans for just such signals! It is inconceivable that these
Setii could have missed so many worlds so close, but one can find
no record of any such success; in fact one can find virtually no
record of the Setii at all. All we know of them is that they were
initially funded by various governments of the prestellar Solomani.
But they abruptly terminated the program in -2,321 (1995AD). One
has to ask why? Why did the Solomani suddenly stop looking, why did
the governments of Terra suddenly start dissmissing the Setii as
quacks? One has to ask, did the Setii find what they were lookng for?

 [Prof Shang continued her lecture detailing the evidence she had
  amassed on the Setii and other later indications that the
  Solomani may have been aware of the Vilani from the 21st Century]

the battle of Jutland using the Battleships and Battlecruisers of the time.
Believe me, you DO NOT want to get a Battlecruiser into a slugging match with a
Battleship, the Battlecruiser dies QUICK!

    Let\'s go back and look at the history folks.  Battleships evolved as part
of Naval arms race.  The Germans built theirs with more slightly more armor in
response to the British "fear" of not having enough Battleships and thus trying
to match the Germans at a two to one ratio.  Almost bankrupted Britain at one
point, if you believe to opposition politicos. ;)
    The British invented the Battlecruiser not to take on Battleships per se
but because they were afraid the Germans would manage to get fast Cruisers out
to sea to go Commerce raiding.  A very legitimate concern for an island nation
unable to feed it\'s self.  Battlecruisers were intended to track down such
raiding cruisers and have such superior armorment as to finish them off
quickly.
    This fit in perfectly with the British Naval tactics, strategy and
philosphy which was to chase down the enemy and bring them to battle.  The
British always built for as much speed as it was possible it design in,
endurance too.  The Germans were more worried about maintaining a fleet in
being to keep their coastlines safe.  What robbed these ships of a real use in
WWI was the submarine which proved so effective so early on.

    Navies are NOT designed in a vacuum, ships are built to fulfill objectives
of a Strategic, Opperational and Tactical nature in accordance with Naval
doctrine.  If your Navy believes in tracking it\'s enemies down and bringing
them to battle as soon as possible the ships it designs are going to be
different from that of a Navy which believes the primary purpose of a Navy is
to defend worlds.
    Navies also respond to technological advances and inovations.  One of the
important new weapons the British (sailing navy of 1814 if memory serves on the
year) had at Trafalger was the Carronade which flung massive ammounts of metal
at enemy ships extremely fast for the times.  We would not have or need the
Aegus Cruisers of today if missile technology had evolved as it has.

    What we need to do is determine what the Navy of the Third Imperium is
intended to do and THAT will determine how it\'s ships are design and for what
purposes.  Massive 1,000,000 ton ships may not be terribly efficient in battle
terms but they make a lot of sense in other terms.  Like carrying Marine
divisions, LOTS of fighters and small craft, impressing lower tech worlds and
so on.  So let\'s ask this question...

    What are the duties of the Imperial Navy?

> 
>     What are the duties of the Imperial Navy?

In my campaigns (as far as the pre-Rebellion Imperium is concerned),
the Imperial Navy has the following responsibilities:

1) Respond quickly and decisively to any external threat.
2) Maintain close watch over planetary conflict internal
   to the Imperium (i.e. ensure no nukes are used, trade
   wars don\'t get out of hand, Articles of War are adhered
   to, etc.)
3) Provide support to system/subsector forces as necessary.
   (piracy suppression, show the flag, etc.)
4) Protect those assets of the Imperium designated as critical.
   This would be naval depots, Imperial military bases, worlds
   classified as Imperial reserves, Imperial prisons (the
   Ministry of Justice would oversee these), etc.

Given the above, the Imperial Navy consists mostly of fast cruiser
squadrons (i.e. high Jump capability) with only a few BatRons
(battleship/dreadnought squadrons) per sector. These BatRons are
assigned to critical subsectors only with some sectors having only
CruRons assigned to them. I can see some battlecruisers being
designed and assigned to potential trouble spots to "slow" down
any troublemakers until the battlewagons show up (I never got
around to designing any, though). The Azhanti High Lightning-class
cruiser is adequate for this role but the Gionetti-class cruisers,
with their Jump 5 rating and 5G acceleration (High Guard), excel
at it.

Any "close watch" situations are covered by *many* smaller ships,
such as SDBs, planetary monitors, fighters, etc., the very numbers
of which serve to more effectively monitor the situation while
allowing any overwhelming force to be harassed until some of the
fast cruisers and BCs could respond.

Gee...kinda sounds like the 5th Frontier War, huh? :-)

In Milieu 0, the Navy has a more "expansionist" role so high
Jump, fast response warships become even more critical. Slower
battleships (assuming they\'re slower) will take on a more
supportive/monitor role. A fast cruiser would definitely be a
very sought after command.

BTW, I\'ve said in the past that fighters are useless as a
primary weapon platform but I\'m resurrecting a role for
fighters...that of a highly mobile, independent weapons
platform.

No, I haven\'t lost it. :-)

I\'m allowing fighter squadrons to coordinate their fire in order
to concentrate their lasers/missiles on common targets, emulating
the effects of a battery through strafing runs. With the
communications possible in Traveller and the length of time for
each combat turn (30 minutes), coordination would be easy. The
problem is they have to get in close for volume of fire to be
effective.  Simply take the number of weapons in the squadron
and convert them to a single battery. Casualties to the squadron
reduce the effectiveness of the battery. This also allows fighters
to take on a standoff anti-missile defense role. Admittedly,
at the speed of combat, most fighters will get only one strafing
run but they can then move on to another target, effectively
acting as a roving pack of wolves, adding joyful chaos to any
engagement! Makes carriers a very mean ship.

The above idea was actually taken from an old CT article in an
out of print gaming magazine. For those of you who have played
classic Traveller during the last decade or so, look to the old
material you may have. Alot of the questions that are now coming
up were answered some years ago.

Wildstar is working on it.  There were a lot of entries at the last

You\'re right, if we want to account for the cost of the custom power
plant I installed, the discounted cost becomes MCr37.795 (an increase
in cost of MCr 3.325). Though, a stricter interpretation of the rules
might disallow the discount altogether. ;-)

As a referee, I like to give the design discount to standard designs
(as opposed to giving the discount for simply using standard
modules), since standard designs produced in quantity deserve a
discount. Your mileage may vary. :-)

Actually, during Bill Prankard\'s walkthrough, we installed a 50 Mw
power plant and a 75 Mw power plant (with a combined volume of 4.5
tons, and a combined fuel use of 0.7 tons.

I used T4\'s QSDS while following Bill\'s discussion. When it came time
to tally volume, power, cost, and area, I found 0.3 tons of waste
space in my notes.

After that walkthrough, I checked my figures again (using T4) and
came up with the same discrepancy. Looking at the completed design, I
could only find two items that could fill the 0.3 ton void, TL-13
Military Controls or a bigger power plant.

My goal is to reproduce a design that results in a Universal Ship
Profile (USP) that matches the one given in T4, if possible.

So, since I wanted to keep the design at TL-12, I chose to add the
spare tonnage to the power plant and see what happened.

My power plant requirement became 4.8 tons volume, 0.7 tons fuel, and
between 125 Mw and 175 Mw power. The only way I could find a way to
duplicate the design shown in T4 was to make a custom power plant. If
there\'s another way to produce the design using standard components
and still duplicate what\'s in T4, I am very interested in seeing it.

BTW, clarifications have been added to my web page. I figure if I
(basically) satisfy the 500 to 600 souls here, I\'ve done well. :-)

  Actually, no.  Subs and torpedo boats were tasked with coastal defence - the
purpose of the High Seas Fleet was to deter the British from interfering with
German overseas aspirations by threat of mutual destruction of battlefleets.

  A very good point.  Do SDB\'s and battlerider/tender combos still work in T4?

  Carronades are actually rather low velocity weapons, which is why they\'re
light and cheap enough to be very attractive for merchants wanting some
heavy iron - neat for turning boats of Malay pirates into rapidly sinking 
abbatoirs.  The actual broadside guns themselves were built for the highest
velocity practical given metallurgy and gun accuracy in 1805.

Because the Third Imperium is using the Second Imperium to establish its
legitimacy. If you don\'t have some of the same cultural references (such as
language/measurement), it becomes harder to establish  believable
authority.

Basic concept is you control a planet that has achieved jump technology. You 
set out to explore, and colonise, or conquer.
Your starting ships are based on your population, which gives credits to buy 
ships with.

We use traveller rule concerning ship design and jump times etc.

We, to make it more fun, are using faster ship building rules and larger ship 
types, up to 1,000,000 tons.

As a starting preferance I have informed the GM that I would like to have all 
my battleships "carried" in jump to the destination system in open frame hull 
ships. I also whent for mobile assault platforms, massive jump capable 
stations, a bit like the death star, just not as impresive. Along with system 
defences like orbital weapon platforms.

I have ships that are 1,000,000 tons in size have jump 2 G 1, they are used to 
jump into a system carrying 3000 15 ton fighters and up to 500,000 tons of 
other ships docked or clamped to the hull.
+\'s for this
No need for jump drives on battle cruisers, more room for high G performance
More room for extra weapons, thus making my ships tougher than my opponents of 
equivalent tonnage.
- -\'s are that
dependant on carrier ship, carrier ship will be expensive to buy, so I will 
have less ships.

Other options I have considered are
Laying siege to a planet by mining its orbit, done by providing my 15 ton 
fighters with jump drives (which is great value for tonnage) and no laser 
turrets, instead have mine racks.

Jump 3000+ fighters into system, 1/4 will have lasers and provide a screen for 
the mine layers. What this achieves is cutting off a planets ship building 
capabilities, unnerving population, causing control problems for government.

Other options, are to use ships to tow asteroids into a planetary system and 
drive them into surface after containing system defences. This would be quite 
awful, causing tectonic clashes, and destroying a great deal of casualties, 
effectively neutralising a planet, especialy useful if a planet cannot be 
controled, too near enemy reinforcements, or took too many casualties during 
initial assault on system.

If anyone actually spent time reading all this, well i\'m impressed, thanks all 
for the help and advice in advance.
Bearing in mind I cannot respond to anything untill I hear of it at my home 
system. That will make the game very interesting...
So response tactics, harrasing tactics, and all out nastiness are required.

And paralleling a route with minor variations that I have begun to take
within a few days of acquiring Fusion, Fire & Steel (a very dangerous book).

Variant aspects.

In the war between Grandfather and his children, Grandfather died and a few
of the children survived, injured and very very concious of their mortality.
They became the Imperious Leaders, which always appeared to be some organic
life form jacked into the base ships. They are now very paranoid. Of all the
former servant speciies, Aslan, Vargr, K\'Kree, Hiver and Humanity; they see
their former human servants as the most dangerous. Humans are too
unpredictable, uncontrollable. 

The \'cylons\' are not mechanical men. The surviving Children have fallen back
on the Droyne as the perferred servants, and begun to enhance them
cybernetically (knew I would find a way to sneak that section of FF&S in).

The Cylon-Droyne are not interested in expanding or developing; the war with
Grandfather made them very defensive, concerned with maintaining their
safety and security; so they go hunting humans only when and where humans
have developed sufficiently to present a threat. 

The PCs would be part of one such human civilization that had become
perceived as a threat and must help defend or find allies to help against
the Cylon-Droyne.

I figure this would be a great setup for those who like the military side of
the game. Lots of space battles, planetary incursions, raids behind enemy
lines and such like adventures. Area would be in the classic Spinward
Marches area, so I could exploit the maps and just alter the
description/alliances.

Stacked about here on diskette somewhere are notes for Traveller:Dune,
Traveller:UFO, Traveller:Invader, Traveller:Above & Beyond, Traveller:
Federation! and Traveller:Babylon 5. Incomplete and sketchy, but there.

Now if I could pay off the mortgage somehow, so I could be on them 24 x 7,
would that be fun.

Sorry about the delay but here it comes.
Hull Displacement is say 100.
Hull_Displacement*14=1400 Hull Volume
ROUND(((Hull_Volume_m3*3)/(4*PI()))^(1/3)*2,1)=13.9 Diameter in meters.
ROUND(4*PI()*(Hull_Diameter_m/2)^2,2)=606.99 Surface Area in m2
Hull_Surface_Area_m2/100=6.0699 Hull Factor

No, you\'re not wrong. However, the following was taken from the
definition of Bribery under the *old* Classic Traveller rules (taken
from the Traveller book):

"Note that the roll for accepting a bribe varies inversely with
 the law level of a world; the more stringent the laws, the greater
 the corruption."

So this rule assumes that harsher laws will result in more people
being willing to break the law and accept bribes. Personally, I
don\'t agree with this.

IMO, it should also include modifiers based on the prevalent TL.
Basically, the higher the TL, the easier it is to monitor the
population and catch someone breaking the law. This would result in
a decreased chance that someone would be tempted to take the bribe
and a corresponding increase in the person\'s willingness to report
the bribery attempt to the local authorities.

   Don\'t tease me like that...I know that an illustrated version (done

the idea of a revival around Hollywood.  If you have heard anything

    'body' => 'To be honest, I know very little of Traveller fleet tactics in any of
its various incarnations. At any rate, I\'m sure you\'ll be up to your
ears in good advice from everybody else.

HOWEVER.... one tactic that has never failed me (in any game system,
from CT to various computer simulations to an AD&D campaign that spanned
three continents) is to go for the economic jugular -- deep interdiction
raids on his factories and commerce. Why dink around breaking milk
bottles in ersatz fleet actions when you can kill the goddam cow?

Accordingly, I suggest you design a deep-interdiction cruiser especially
for the purpose. I\'m not familiar with whatever variant on the rules
you\'re using, so I can\'t advise you on the particulars, but I would
suggest the following characteristics:

1) Firstly, this sucker has to be MOBILE. It has to be able to penetrate
deep into enemy space and run away from big things and catch little
things. Accordingly, it should carry the best jump drive you can stick
in it, along with enough fuel for a two way trip. It should have the
best manuver drive you can reasonably fit in it, too. And it should
preferably be small enough to hitch a ride on your battle carriers, so
it can hitch rides and go even further.

2) Secondly, armaments need not be of the battlecruiser calibre, but
they should be enough to take on several smaller military vessels, so it
can take out armed outposts and won\'t be driven off by a few measly
system defense boats. A single squadron of fighters can add to its
firepower, and serve as eyes and ears to pick up targets throughout the
system you intend to terrorize. And since your object is commerce
raiding, a whole bunch of the mine racks you mentioned wouldn\'t hurt. I
bet a capital ship could carry LOTS of those lovely little suckers...

3) If you want to carry this concept to its ultimate conclusion, build a
class of ship tenders on the same hull, whose sole job it is to supply
and refuel these ships so that they can stay out there virtually
forever. This should drive the enemy to utter distraction after he\'s
staked out every gas giant in the neighborhood and you\'re STILL beating
him to a pulp in his own backyard.

Think of this beast as an interstellar U-boat, and employ it
accordingly. Avoid fair fights at all cost. The enemy will not only be
taking a beating economically, he\'ll have to channel a considerable
portion of his front-line forces to try and track them down. Such a
strategy always reaps disproportionate rewards. 

If you have the balls to actually subordinate your fleet strategy to
your U-boats, instead of simply viewing them as particularly nasty
auxiliaries, you can reduce any enemy to helpless screaming jelly in
short order. Make a show of front-line force in one system, then
another, requiring him to take time away from hunting your U-boats to
fend you off. Then you retreat and step up your U-boat activity again.
About the time he\'s convinced they don\'t form a serious military threat,
you form them into wolf packs and hit a big target -- then disperse (the
old \'ninja! vanish!\' routine). Wait until he responds by stepping up his
system patrols, then move up a nasty threatening fleet up where he can
see it, forcing him to siphon resources away from his wolf-hunt to
defend himself....

And so on, over and over, yanking his strategic chain back and forth
until he\'s so totteringly weak that you can just cruise in and take all
his turf at a single stroke. Beats hell out of a slow grinding war of
attrition. Makes him busy enough that he can\'t really attack you,
either. Sun Tzu would approve. Give it a try.

What\'s weirder than the Vilani adopting the Terran calendar: jumpspace
adopting the Terran calendar! Notice that a jump, regardless of distance,
always takes *one week*! Now there\'s an astounding coindidence. :)

Obviously it\'s a not really a week *exactly*, but close enough for game
purposes. Seems to me the Imperium would adopt the jump-duration as the
standard time unit. All other measures could be derived from that unit.

	I agree completely.  In fact, this is a subject I\'ve been planning
on bringing up.  
	There is a real tension between the justification of the QSDS
discount and the usefulness of QSDS as a design system.  The justification
for the discount is that QSDS is made up of a small number of standardized
components that are mass produced and used widely.  The usefulness of QSDS
as a system, however, is dependent on how flexible it is and the number of
different options it offers.  But the more hull sizes and power plant
capacities that are offered the less the "mass production" discount makes 
sense.
	I propose that all components in all systems be given the same 
pricing.  Then, after the ship is designed, the ref can decide whether 
the ship class qualifies for one of the "bulk" discounts.  Truly 
ubiquitious ships like the Scout Courier and Subsidized Merchant should 
get the 75% price, while common ships with big production runs would get 
the 85% price.  Ships that are unique to one company or planetary navy 
get the full price.
	Comments?  Derek?

   Probably not all the reasons, but here\'s a good start:

1) Flexibility: I can play any kind of sci-fi game I want, from hardcore
Asimov-style to Star Trek to Starship Troopers to Battlestar Galactica
to Twilight Zone, all with the same set of books.  Hell, I can even play
non-sci-fi settings if I don\'t mind doing a little research and
designing my own weapons (or pick up copies of some of the Twilight:2000
sourcebooks to save time).  American Civil War RPG anyone?  No problem. 
"Guns of the South" RPG (where a bunch of white South Africans go back
in time and give the Confederates AK-47s in an effort to change
history)?  Absolutely.  How about a later Harry Turtledove novel about
an alien invasion of Earth in 1942?  Why not?  My point here is that TNE
is so inherently flexiable there is no limit to what you can do with it.

2) Task Resolution System: Most tasks are one die (even when I roll
multiple dice, each die represents one round).  I don\'t have to count
out dice everytime somebody wants to take an action, or figure out which
one is the "crazy dice" or "wild dice" or which is the half dice this
time.  No tipping off to the players how difficult something is when I
don\'t want them to know (at least not until after they\'ve tried).  The
"to hit" number (the number I must roll or lower) is always my skill
level plus attribute.  No "divide this number by two then multiply this
other one by three and then perform the ritual referee dance to
determine if player opens door".  The odds of performing anything follow
a natural progression and don\'t artifically top out at a certain level. 
Don\'t like the odds?  Mods to the system are simple to perform too.

3) Detailed Design Sequences: Aside from watercraft (which you could
figure out if you wanted to, based on the MT watercraft design rules
that appeared in Challenge), you can build almost anything.  This is a
big help when you\'re doing alternative settings (see above) or you just
want to build a better battleship, or the ultimate battledress.  I think
only GURPs comes even close in the level of detail and choices
available, no other system is even in the same ballpark.

4) Depth of Background Material: Everything that happened in classic
Traveller happened in TNE, and it is perfectly permissable say to your
players "its 1105 and you are at the main starport on Trin in the
Spinward Marches with Cr 1,000 and no job, good luck."  TNE contains no
historical "revisionism", and any classic Traveller scenario can be used
with TNE with little or no adjustment required.  You can even start in
1116 with your characters present at the Imperial palace thwarting
Dulinor\'s coup, and progressing the timeline from there, or start in
Year Zero, and see if your player characters can become heroes of the
new empire, with starships and whole planets named after them.

   Ultimately TNE delivers what the designers at GDW originally
attended: a game that is both flexible, yet complex enough to hold your
attention.  My one regret is that GDW didn\'t have the funds on hand to
make TNE into more than just the story of the post-Collapse era.  There
is so much more that it can be.

   Mines would only be useful if they were in fact short range
missiles.  That way they can hit targets as they take off from the
surface and can give you planetwide coverage.  Stationary mines can be
easily avoided once their orbits are known (even orbit is a big place). 
Placing anything like in mine in orbit though requires that all
planetary based defences be neutralized, because while orbit is big,
there is also no where to hide, and sooner or later the bad guys on the
ground are going to pick off all your mines.

 What your forgetting is that while you are busy spending X% of your
military budget on these intersteller raiders, you are taking X% from your
defense and his ships(while they might not survive for *years*, they can
survive for many months without going to port and refueling at gas giants
and asteroid belts) and just wash over your empire. It would be a pyhrric
victory at best.
 THis type of thing where you over-concentrate your \'push\' into one
strategy works best against stupid computer opponents :)

The problem with that is that it\'s variable...  within hours, of course,
but still I doubt that it has the consistency required of a std. time
measurement; unless canon were "changed" to support this theory...  which
has merit!

In my Rebellion era campaign the calender has 365 days of 52 weeks and one
holiday outside of the weeks. Each season is three months long where each
month is 4 weeks, 4 weeks and 5 weeks. My players and myself has a calender
where they note their travels, important events and so forth. This makes
refereeing much easier and in one instance made an extremely important turn
of events.

What calender a culture uses has more to do with religous or political
factors than reason as can be seen on earth today. The Islamic year doesn\'t
conform to the "real year" and most modern, western countries have decided
to turn their clocks back part of the year for what I can tell mystic
reasons.

The good about all this is that societies doesn\'t get more rational or
scientific as their TL increase which gives the referee ample opportunity
to invent interesting cultures and adventure hooks.

Last week I posted to the List about a TL-16 planet in Gateway Sector that was 
mentioned in the Megatraveller Journal 4. Here\'s some more info on it, with 
thoughts on how this could be tied to the \'TL-14 ROM Space Suit\'.

- ----

Alphaaric, Gateway 1133. 1120 stats: A996220-F N Fl Lo   932 Na M1V M4V
(yup, I got the TL wrong).

An independent system, just outside the Imperial client state of the Galian 
Federation, jointly managed by the Federation and the system\'s own native, 
nonhuman civilization, the Faar. The UWP is for Faarview, a human colony/station 
circling Mashan, the system\'s primary gas giant.
Alpharic is inhabited by the Faar, a highly advanced civilization which has 
never bothered to develop jump drive or explore beyond it\'s own world. A brisk 
and highly lucrative trade in high-tech electronics, novelties and recreational 
devices continues between the Galian traders and the Faar Domains.

- ----

The next highest tech achieved in the Gateway sector is C, so it is possible 
that the Faar achieved their tech level slowly, and may have been at TL-14 
around the start of the Third Imperium. 

Gareway was colonized just after the start of the Long Night, and began 
exploitation of the sector through Corporations in -500. The imperium contacted
the sector officially in 64, but there may have been trade between the Gateway 
Corporations and Imperial Traders before then. It wouldn\'t be unreasonable to 
suppose that some Faar TL-14 parts or suits were traded, and incorporated into 
Vacc Suits that were traded as Rule of Man Suits, to get a better price as 
antiques, also protecting the source of the High-Tech suits.

Not an eligant solution to the Suit problem, but a possibility.

Well, you cannot beat GURPS in flexibility. Most capaign settings are

GURPS doesn\'t have a task system but has much more rules than TNE which
somewhat alleviate this problem.

FF&S is randomly cobbled together with high detail in some parts and no
detail at all in others. Also, most of the detail in design system is lost
when playing as there are no rules for most of the stuff you put in.

The heplar thrusters and semi magical virus changes the underlying reality

The only real disadvantage with GURPS is that there is no Traveller
gameworld for it, otherwise I reccomend any beginning Traveller players to
buy GURPS, GURPS Space, GURPS Vehicles and any old background mtrl from CT
or MT.

I agree that TNE was the best game system for Traveller by GDW but the
setting was more space fantasy than old traveller, perhaps to lure Vampire
players to traveller?
(Oh no! I did another TNE bash :)
The problem is that I\'ve yet to meet a Traveller referee that uses any GDW
system.
I\'ve always* had my own combat system, design system et c so my preference
for MT lies solely on the setting.

*We played Snapshot with homebrew rules before Traveller and have therefore
never really used Travellers org systems. The only org system I\'ve used was
High Guard for a couple of weeks but as it was very uninspiring when
fighting out Scout vs Pirate battles we only used it as a design system.
When Striker I came out I scrapped High Guard and made my own design system
which I\'ve been rewriting constantly up until today.

Its called "Guerre de Corse", a strategy probably as old as
warfare itself. Its the traditional strategy of the lesser power.
And it has failed far far more times than it has succeded. It
only has a chance of success if you have no LOC\'s the enemy can
attack in their turn. If you have vunerable LOC\'s the enemy would
have to be a first class dimwit not to follow suit (this is not
to say that you need to look very hard to find such dimwits).

If they are small they won\'t work. A raider has to be at least
cruiser sized to have any chance. Any smaller and it will be
creamed by the enemies patrol forces.

They have to carry sufficent armarment to overwhelm any small
opponent very quickly, not defeat but crush. Remember any
damage and the ship is toast. Mines are good, mostly due to
their threat rather than the actual damage they will do. The
enemy can not know how many there are and must devote resources
to sweeping all possible contacts. But then again, remember that
the enemy can do the same to you. During the 1st WW the British
held off deploying their very effective magnetic mines because
the Germans could do far more damage to the British with them.
A few mines around your bases can really put a crimp in your
raiders operations.

The tenders are a good idea, but they are high value targets
with only very limited capacity to defend themselves; and they
will be the first priority of the enemy.

Its not a submarine, its a surface raider. It doesn\'t have the
degree of stealth to make a sub. The problem with this type of
ship is that a much smaller vessel can force it to break of its
mission. If it gets damaged it loses its advantage and has to
run home, so even when it wins against an enemy ship it will be
forced to abandon its raid if it has suffered even mild damage.
Therefore it can\'t aford to fight anything capable of inflicting
damage. Therefore the enemy can counter it with a large number
of smaller ships. If it tries to raid surface facilities it runs
into the fact that anything worth hitting will have defences quite
capable of hurting it.

Your raiders need bases to operate from and those bases have to
be fairly close to the front. Those bases are going to be a prime
target for the enemy. These bases have to be defended or the enemy
will come waltzing over the frontier and take your bases.

Unless your the minor power without significant LOC\'s, don\'t base
your strategy around it. Commerce raiding is a vital part of an
intergrated naval strategy, but its only part.

I couldn\'t help notice the above and wondered if I could beg for help!
Please could you give me details of Memory Alpha for a forthcoming
bibliography BITS is publishing?

What I\'d like to know is:

the *full* title (including any subtitle)
the author as given on the title page (1st choice) cover (2nd) e.g. Marc W.
Miller, Marc Miller or whatever
the publisher [GDW?]
the date of publication
the number of pages [the last numbered page, or if there\'s no page
numbering a page count]
the size of the volume (in inches) although if it\'s a Little Black Book
size or regular \'large\' size, that info would suffice
a yes or no on the inclusion of any of the following:
     Maps (not counting deck plans)
     Tables
     Diagrams (non-\'illustration\' graphics or deck plans would be included
in this)
     Illustrations (not counting the cover)
     Glossary
     Bibligoraphy
     Index
A note on the location (if any) in Imperial space
Short contents note

Any further comments you\'d be willing to add although I do have a few notes
as I have a reprint of the thing in a magazine (which of course doesn\'t
tell me any of the above for certain.)

Your help would be much appreciated and of course, you\'d get a mention in
the acknowledgements of the bibliography.

Many thanks, sorry to trouble you

Sorry dave, but MT used a different formula for jump fuel than CT/T4

CT: fuel for 1 jump of J-n = 10% size times n

MT: fuel for 1 J-n = 5% volume times (n+1)
	as Jdrive volume is (n+1)%
	and J-N fuel is 5 times volume of jump drive.

TNE: Same as MT

T4: same as CT

Actually, one of the Pre-Euro Meso-american cultures had an Astonomical
callendar. The solar year and the astronomical year are close, very  very
close, but slightly different.

	Solar observed year is either equinox to same equinox or solstice
to same solstice. due to days not snyching exactly to orbital period, there
is a difference from:

	Astronomical year is 1 complete orbit. not day-linked.

	astrological year is time to have a given constellation rise or set
over a specific arc range; stonehenge may have been used for this, in
addition, or in place of, solar year, at same or different times.

terms are taken from an anthropology text, in a sidebar.
all these are related, but all share a period of around 365.2xx terran real
days of 23:56:06.7 (HH:MM:SS), with solar observed year being 365 or 366
days, as it is an integer system; it is the actual system in practical use,
and requires correction factors (leap days ever x years, with a leap day
skipped every x years, and every so many x years, you add one back in.

said pre-euro-contact meso-american calendar was more accurate than the
revised gregorian in current use... and was based upon astological
observations in conjuction with solar observations... and heavy base 20 and
360 mathematics.

so much for the "technology beats anchient wisdom" paradigm... ;-)

My apologies, I guess there\'s a first time for everything.  (that\'ll wipe
the smirk off my face when others do the same!)



While I\'m here - those interested in languages in Traveller might also be
interested in the following book:

Aliens and Linguistics: Language Study and Science Fiction

Because at law level 1 there are very few laws, and they take them

At law level 1, the only things that are illegal are rape, murder and
theft.  There is probably no legal system per-se, just a bunch of angry
neighbors who will lynch you.  Now, try bribing your way out of that.

At law level 10, imagine a place like Singapore.  Chewing gum is
illegal.  Not flushing a toilet is illegal.  With so many crimes, the
average person will be arrested every month or so (no clue if this is
true in Singapore).  Punishments can\'t be all that severe, or there
wouldn\'t be any people left.  Similarly, bribary would be quite easy
since nobody really cares.

the ship only uses 104.7Mw IIRC.  Why do you need the extra power?

rules changes, but...

The target number for the "saving throw" (does that phrase show my age, or
what?) is supposed to be the tens digit of the character\'s age, beginning
at age 35, and then every five years thereafter for STR, DEX, END, and
INT...

In effect, just alternating target numbers between 5 and 0 every five
years... 5 at 35, 0 at 40, 5 at 45...  which seems a bit silly at this time

boarding was still possible, and the expansion set for IC particularly 
takes this into account - including provisions even for actions with
infantry on river banks and forts. The critical hit system also gives
a WSIM type feel. 

The reason I brought it up is because the overall feel is similar, but
it provides a means to handle armor and engine-based propulsion. Also,
like Traveller, there is a lot of attention to different weapons types. 
My one complaint with the system is that the guns are too accruate for the
period.

series of capacitors, then released, or does it come directly from the

	Huh! Shows you how long it\'s been since I used MT. Actually, I only ever
designed one ship for MT, and (after six straight hours of playing, at 2
am), the referee managed to walk away with it. We spent the rest of the
campaign chasing that damn thing all over the Imperium!

No, as you said, it\'s the _tens digit_ that becomes the target number.  
Thus, at age 35, the target number is 3.  At age 40, the target number is 
4.  And so on.  Of course, unlike with all other tasks in the book, if 
you roll less than or equal to the target number on an aging throw, that 
means you lose a point (i.e., what would be thought of as a successful 
throw in the rest of the book is, in the case of aging, a failed throw).


Hope this helps,

Actually, in our solar system, gas giants vary from 50000 km diameter
(Neptune/Uranus) to 140,000 km (Jupiter). 

Interestingly, Jupiter has about the maximum radius possible for a 
nonstellar object; as you add more mass, the core becomes slightly degenerate
and the radius stays about the same (or even decreases). 

I\'ve always assumed that things like "1000 diameters" were just rules-of-thumb,
and the actual radius depends on the mass (or mass^1/3) - maybe we should
write up a table based on that.

There was a short treatment about the Vilani language in Vilani & Vargr,
although not much.

Alien Module 3: Vargr had vocabulary, grammar etc. for \'a relatively
obscure Vargr language\': Arrghoun.

Alien Module 8: Darrians had a (very) short article about tezlodh (the
Darrian language).

Travellers\' Digest issue 3 had an article about \'Vargr Language and
Culture\' by Gary L. Thomas.

Travellers\' Digest issue 17 had an article about \'Trokh: Language of the
Warriors\' by Gary L. Thomas. It ran 3.5 pages.

IIRC there are no other canonical treatments of Traveller languages,
besides the standard word generation tables.

Hope this helps.

the thought:

A ship exits jumpspace.

It scans astronomical "markers" to find its current location in 
space. (i.e., answers the question, "where are we?")

Is scans astronomical "markers" to find its current location in time. 
(i.e., answers the question, "when are we?")  [note: these "markers" 
may or may not be the same as the first step]


A ship *can\'t* rely on its own clock, because (in some versions of 
the rules) minor mishaps can cause a time distortion during jump. 
(i.e., in jumpspace the ship\'s clock runs off more or less time than 
passes in normal space)


I\'m simply interested in knowing if we\'re aware of any astronomical 
phenomenon that could be used in the manner I\'ve described. I\'m 
completely uninterested in replacing the Imperial calendar. This is 
more of a "what if"?

The results could be used in Traveller with the Imperial calendar, or 
in other settings with different calendars.


I\'m looking more for a "date/time reference" than for a replacement 
calendar. (Though, the new reference system *might* eventually 
replace older calendars - depends on the culture. :-)

Accuracy need only be light-seconds or minutes (initially) for its 
location in space, and seconds or minutes for its location in time. 
Initial observations should assure an astrogator that all is well. 
Continued observations should allow greater accuracy in space/time 
location.

I figure it should work something like WWV radio broadcasts 
available here and now.

Thoughts? Comments? Astronomical Knowledge?

"Battlestar Galactica" referred to the Egyptians, the Toltecs, and the

calender- and dynasty-obsessed starfaring Mayan progenitors is sorta
nifty, in a colorful "space-opera-ish" kinda way.  Hey...something just
occurred to me.  The Mayans had, I believe, *three* different kinds of
years: the 365-day "vague year," probably used for ordinary administrative
purposes, a 360-day year used to determine chronological distances to a
reference point at roughly 3100 b.c., and a 260-day "calender round," used
to assign "day names" to each day, in part for divination.  The 365- and
360-days years make a moderate amount of sense, but why a 260-day year?
The answer is obvious: Precolumbian Mesoamerican civilization (the Aztecs
also used the "calender round," and so did the earlier Olmecs), was either
descended from, or inspired by, a minor human race whose homeworld had a
260-day year.  Ha!  Yes, I know, this has nothing to do with \'Traveller\',
so I\'ll drop it.

Oh, if I recall correctly, the "real" human homeworld in "Battlestar
Galactica" was called Kobol.

60 digests in order to be able to read the last ones...

        JTAS 25 has finally arrived to Spain (that meaning me, I do not know
of anybody else receiving it in this Traveller-Free country...)

        The fiction is good, the Vestiges adventure is great, the Asym
excerpt is also good, I love the issue, but.... what is this "Silver Moon"
thing????

        It seems to me that "Silver Moon" is a Star Wars adventure hurriedly
adapted to Traveller... and I do not like the result. But, worse, nobody
else can like it, because IMHO nobody else can use it. Either I am
completely mistaken, or this adventure is of no use because it violates the
basic principles of Traveller.

        Let me explain. The PCs travel from a "starbase" to a planet 4
parsecs away, following a mission given by the commander of the Starbase. If
they make some mistake, then the Imp.Navy is waiting for them when they
arrive... that\'s strange, because they are jumping immediately there and
information cannot travel faster than them, but O.K., let us ignore this.
        Please, guys, take a look at the last box in page 19, under the
title "Encounter Six - The Arrest". The Imperial Navy has captured the PCs,
and then they are releasing them because they have "called" Starbase and
have had a "conversation" with the commander of the Starbase (Armontillo).
They exchange at least four sentences... IN TRAVELLER, THIS MEANS AT LEAST
FOUR WEEKS!!! Ther is no interstellar phone! Information travels in ships!
If this is not so, I have been completely mistaken for years... So, please,
tell me that I am wrong and that I am not reading this "adventure" well. To
me, it seems that one of the most basic assumptions of Traveller has been
violated.

        But, that\'s not all. The adventure starts speaking of a new
MEGAcorporation, Baabac Enterprises. Funny. I thought all the megacorps were
already accounted for in the Referee\'s Companion (?), so a new one is a
major departure from early developed background. O.K., I thought, although
there is no word about it, this must mean that this adventure is written for
Milieu Zero, not for 1100. But, at the beginning, the adventure speaks of
"transponders...". I was under the impression that transponders were
developed around 1100, after Dr.Rushorin research about the Cymbeline Chips.

        What is happening here? I better not mention all the other little
facts, like this surprising "Imperial Navy Military Police" never mentioned
before in Traveller, or the incredible situation where an Imperial Navy
officer investigates about Scout ships and even provides one of them (I
thought the IN and the IISS were different organizations), or the fact that
no UWPs or reference to the location (not even sector) of the named worlds
used in the adventure are provided (Oberon/Puck, Loviatar... where are these
worlds, and what are the stats?).

        I humbly insist: this seems to me a Star Wars adventure badly
camouflaged as Traveller, and I also humbly think that stuff like this has
no place in JTAS.
        If Lewis Wright is around there, I would appreciate some answers
about this...

No, sleeping through high school algebra, trig, college calc I & II, etc.
are what caused my lack of understanding...  It would have helped had I
noticed that the example age was 50 not 35 (which I, for some
alien-infested reason thought it was)...  *bonk self*

I\'m not sure I like this new rule...  It begins INT degradation much
earlier than previously, and it makes ALL characters equally likely to age,
rather than those with higher ability scores...  Hmmm.  If INT degradation
is supposed to reflect senility et al, and it begins at age 35 along with
weakening STR, DEX, and END...  Oh, that explains my predicament handily. 
;-)  But..

RFC:  is the new rule more realistic than the TNE/House rule?

	Canon (TNE, and FFS IIRC, derived from DGP Starship Operators
manual)states that the power for a jump is generated by a special fusion
plant that dumps a LOT of power into a huge bank of zuchai-crystal
capacitors, which then power the jump drive. T4 states nothing like that
AFAIK, but since T4 more-or-less follows canon, I would guess that this is
what happens.

It\'s worth noting that QSDS 1.x, as published, gives you this option without
a lot of trouble.  All of the tables in QSDS show the full price for every
component; the QSDS construction rules tell you to give QSDS ships a
discount once they are constructed.

With this organization, it\'s easy to change the procedure and do as you say:
certain designs (designated by the referee) qualify for discounts, based on
the number of examples produced and current market conditions.  All other
ships are built at full list price.  IF you know that a ship was built with
QSDS rules, you can use the discounted price to figure the full list price,
and then apply whatever cost modifier is appropriate to your campaign.

This is true, and in the next version of QSDS, I want to give ship designers
a lot more options than they have now.

It\'s an open secret that I\'m working on a new version of QSDS.  The comments
from people who have used QSDS 1.x over the last six months have been
invaluable in shaping the new edition, and I\'m strongly considering doing
several things differently.  Your point is very valid, and one thing that
I\'d like to do in the next version of QSDS is to give ship designers a lot
more options than they have now (*).

One option under consideration will be to provide a list of _TRULY_ standard
components: in other words, I\'ll go through the published "standard" designs
and pull out the components used in those ships.  Only these components
would qualify for the mass-production discount (which would be pre-computed
and the discounted price listed in the tables).  Thus, you could construct a
ship with (say) a 100-ton Scout/Courier hull, install a jump drive from a
Far Trader and see what kind of performance you\'ve got.


One thing I can do to provide more options without increasing the number and
size of LITs (Large, Intimidating Tables) in the system is to provide some
of the formulas, so that non-standard components can be custom-designed.
These formulas would be simpler than FF&S (though based on the formulas in
that book, simplified by removing detail and combining related steps).

There would still be tables of standard components (just like the current
QSDS), but the tables wouldn\'t grow significantly in the new version.  The
formula approach would similar to Classic Traveller\'s "High Guard" design
system, and would also allow you to build ships larger than 5000 dtons,
or smaller than 100 dtons.


(*) Note: I\'ve gotten three general kinds of comments about QSDS: the first
is when someone notifies me of an error in the system.  These are very
useful, and the next version of QSDS has all the errors (at least, all the
ones I know about) fixed.  The second kind of comment (and by far the most
common) is a request for more options and more flexability.  The third kind
of comment is a request to make QSDS even simpler, because it\'s too complex.
I\'m not sure I\'ll be able to satisfy _everyone_ with the next version, but I
think it\'ll be greatly improved.


Here\'s the outline of what I\'m working on; comments are greatly appreciated:

QSDS 2.0
  1) Introduction and explanation of terms
  2) Quick Starship Design
     The design goals for this iteration of QSDS is to allow most or all
     "standard" [*] ships to be built with Quick Design.  A Quick Design
     ship should take well under an hour for the first-time designer, and
     ten to fifteen minutes for an experienced designer.  No tools except
     a pencil and a single sheet of paper (no calculator), and the only
     math required would be addition and subtraction of decimal numbers.
     A) Hull Table
        Much like the current table, though length will be noted for use
        with an expanded table of spinal mounts.  There will be more TLs
        represented, but probably fewer hulls at each TL (only those 
        hulls that are used by standard designs).
     B) Drive Tables
        Much like the current system, although perhaps with fewer drives
        in total (to match the hulls presented).  Perhaps add a table of
        pre-computed jump fuel requirements, to eliminate multiplication.
     C) Avionics
        Re-organized, to include:
        - Avionics Packages (avionics, sensors and commo together, like SSDS)
          Packages will be designed to match sensor installations in the 
          standard ships (eg: a basic package, a scoutship package, etc).
        - Add-on Sensors (add individual sensors to Packages)
        - Add-on Communicators (add individual communicators to Pacakges)
        I\'m considering moving the add-ons to the Custom section.
     D) Weapons
        Similar to the current QSDS, but with re-designed (more efficient)
        weapons.  This version will include a table of standard missiles (so
        your missile launchers now have ordinance to fire).  Missile weapon
        systems combined into all-in-one packages like lasers are now.
     E) Power
        Power plants and fuel purifiers in standard sizes.
     F) Controls
        Much like the current section, with rules for determining the number
        of crew.  To eliminate multiplication, I may add a set of tables
        that give standard (2-crew, 4-crew) cockpits, and standard-sized
        bridges.
     G) Quarters
        Crew accomodations in standard-size units for installation in
        modular ships (probably in sizes convenient for the standard
        ship designs) to eliminate another multiplication.
  3) Custom Starship Design
     Custom ship design is intended to give advanced designers a MUCH wider
     spectrum of options than either QSDS or SSDS do currently.  The system
     (used in conjunction with Quick Design) should be usable with only a
     pencil, paper, and a basic scientific calculator.  An experienced Quick
     Design user should be able to build their first Custom Design ship in
     under an hour, and experienced Custom Design users should be able to
     construct ships in half that time.  Custom Design will require
     multiplication of decimal numbers.
     A) Rules for building QSDS hulls (including <100 and >5000 dtons).
        This section will include a table of hulls ranging up to a million
        tons.  A calculator that can take cube roots would be required to
        build hulls of sizes that are not on the table.
     B) Rules for installing drives in hulls of any size.
     C) Carried craft, hangars, launch tubes, docking rings, etc.
     D) Weapons:
        - Weapon system components, and rules for building systems
          (individual turrets, MFDs, and other weapon components).
        - Bay and Spinal Mount weapons.
     E) Rules for building custom-sized power plants.
     F) Controls
        - Table of workstations at each TL.
        - Rules for constructing bridges and other control rooms (Combat
          Information Center, Flight Operations, Fire Control, Flag Bridge).
        - Rules for small craft crew (under 100 tons) and large ships
          (over 5000 tons).
     G) Quarters
        - Table of quarters by size and comfort level
        - Guidelines for military and civilian crew quarters, and passenger
          accomodations.

[*] Currently, I\'m considering the following ships as "Standard": 100-ton
Scout/Courier; 200-ton Free and Far Traders, 400-ton Subsidized Merchant,
Corsair, System Defense Boat and Patrol Cruiser; 600-ton Subsidized Liner;
800-ton Mercenary Cruiser.  Any suggestions or changes for this list?

    'body' => 'Well, I\'m almost halfway done with converting the races from Aliens
Archive into GURPS templates... and thought I\'d point out a few oddities
that I haven\'t yet seen mentioned.  I have no idea how much of this is Tim
Brown\'s doing, how much is Ashe Marler or Wildstorm Production\'s (whoever
they might be), or whether the fault lies elswhere entirely.  Note that
I\'m not slamming the book itself or the aliens therein -- I rather like
them, aside from Tim Brown\'s propensity for beings with more manipulative
hands than the human norm (are we that bad off? :-)  Rather, the art
included in the book is execrable, filled with inconsistencies with the
descriptive text. 

Anyone noticed anything strange about the pictures of The Controlled? 
Page 21 claims "Guy-troy have a heavily muscled, spherical torso."  But
directly below this sentence (!) appears a sketch of an almost elfin
purported Guy-troy skeleton.  The next page states that both arms and legs
are jointed in three places below the shoulder/hip... but the picture\'s
arms only have two.  Further on, we\'re told that "they do not have a rigid
spine."  Not according to the graphic artist -- it\'s right there, on the
distorted humanoid frame apparently dragooned into service, with minor
variations, for each species covered in the volume.

On to the Denaar.  It looks like they inherited the Controlled\'s missing
joint: p. 29 says "each [hind] leg is jointed at a knee and ankle," but p.
28\'s illustration seems to have an extra.  Most notably, though, "aside
from the limbs and an extension of the digestive system in the hind-
quarters, the Denaar essentially lives within the carapace." (p. 29). 
Look again at the illo on the page previous.  WHAT IS A HEAD DOING THERE?
For that matter, why do we see a ribcage instead of the constantly-
referred-to carapace?

How about the Graytch?  "The Graytch foot has three manipulative toes,
each opposed against the other two" (sensible for such extraordinary
brachiators).  But p. 37\'s illustration takes the "spidertaur" label
far too seriously, presenting an all-too-arachnoid single-boned foot (not
too mention a carapaced abdomen rather than the internal skeleton
described -- perhaps they\'re interbreeding with the Denaar?)  Tim Brown\'s
a little indistinct with his terminology, here listing Graytch arms as
having joints in "three places: at the shoulder, an elbow, and the wrist."
Again, the skeletal exhibit has an extra.  And while we\'re at it, the
hands have developed an extra finger.

Need I proceed to the Hana Saka, one of the worst artistic offenses?
These super-evolved starfish receive an extended narration about their
lack of a standard skeleton: instead, they have a distributed and
reconfigurable bone network that allows formation of a joint anywhere
desired.  Why, then, the standard skeleton of p. 46\'s anatomical drawing,
complete with internally-boned pre-jointed arm- and leg- bones?  No hint
here that these beings, like the Hivers, are descended from radially
symmetrical stock.

That\'s as far as I\'ll go for now.  Again, I like these aliens: they\'re
strange but wonderful, and don\'t distress my suspension of disbelief too
far at once.  My only quibbles with the text would be the Bye-Ren\'s
unreasonable mass (did someone forget to convert pounds to kilograms
correctly?), and the literally in-credible speed the average Controlled
can achieve in flight.  I\'m also distressed that no modifiers to
statistics are included in the character generation suggestions, even for
super-strong species like the Bye-Ren and Hana Saka.

I\'m half inclined to finally sit down and teach myself how to use blobs in
my ray-tracing package (Imagine, by Impulse), to create better drawings
for myself.  Anyone artistically inclined could certainly do the Traveller
community a service by providing these neglected sophonts more artistic
justice.

If anyone wants to check out my new Traveller webpage, it\'s available at
http://www.io.com/~jlockett/RPG/Traveller/.  So far it\'s just links to
existing GURPS:Traveller material, the AA racial templates I\'m working on,
and my January contest entry, but I hope to keep adding to it.  I\'ve also
tried to produce the prettiest link list in Traveller webdom.  :-)  As
soon as webring.org revives, I hope to get linked into the current
network, with which I\'m much impressed!

Again, if others have already raved over these poorly thought-out and
executed illustrations, I apologize.  I\'ve been going over each
description with a fine-toothed comb for the conversion process, and am
just distressed that the artist apparently didn\'t do the same.

        Well, on the strategic level, I\'d agree.  The DIC idea you\'re
responding to is IMHO a neat idea and any decent navy ought to have an
equivalent, but basing your entire strategy around them without reference
to the geography or the opponent seems like the sort of thing that would
work on a subroutine, not a human.

        Sir Basil Liddell-Hart\'s take on how to go about winning a war
(followed to some extent by Guderian in developing the Blitzkrieg and to
the letter by Schwartzkopf in the Gulf) is roughly as follows: grab an
enemy strategic resource right off the bat (obliging him to predictably
attack you to get it back), attain air superiority and pound the crap out
of his logistics and communications with it, and then hit one of his
flanks, isolate, and mop up...

        I can certainly see DIC\'s fitting in to pounding the crap out of
logistics and communications, and just general hell-raising, annoyance and
demoralization of the civilian populace (imagine a leaflet drop using one:
"Citizen, what you are holding could have been a nuke!  Your government
cannot protect you!  Undermine the evil regime\'s war effort and save your
children!" etc).  As the whole cornerstone of your fleet, no.  And it
shouldn\'t be forgotten tthat the higher the jump rating, the bigger it\'s
going to have to be; SDB\'s of an equivalent size will be able to defeat it,
since all that volume going to J-drive and j-fuel will instead be going to
weapons, power plants, more weapons, some boarders, a few more weapons,
bigger weapons, etc...

First-order check (to see if you\'re in the right system)
  -spectral type of the primary star
  -relative position of supergiant stars

If you\'re in the right system:
  -position of planets (especially your destination planet, which should
   be pretty close)

If you\'re in the wrong system:
  -use positions of supergiants to determine which system you\'re in
   (fortunately, misjumps will only take you 36 parsecs or less away...)

>Is scans astronomical "markers" to find its current location in time. 

Inside a known system, positions of planets and asteroids should give
a reasonably acurate time (as well as locations of features like
continents; a P1 sensor can resolve features a 40 metres across at 
1,000,000 km ranges.) Of course, in a well-known system you\'ll just tune into
the Imperial equivalent of GPS.

In an unknown system or an empty hex, getting a precision time measurement
will be harder - probably relative motions of a whole bunch of nearby
stars would give you time to within an hour or so; if for some unimaginable
reason you need a more precise time, I\'m not sure what you\'d do.
Possibly, Imperial standard navigation tapes would include records of 
various transient events that only last a few seconds - gamma ray bursts,
pulsar glitches - and the time of the event as measured in various 
hexes; in a hex further away from the event you could wait until 
you detect it and calculate when you should have seen it based on light-travel
time. Of course, you have to wait for a suitable event, but gamma-ray bursts
detectable by a P1 PEMS (TL10+) sensor suite probably occur several times
a day.

On low law worlds, it isn\'t bribery; you\'ll be charged what the market will
bear. Also, on low law worlds, those few illegal items will be so offensive
as to take really cold, obnoxious, B*st*rds to sell it to you, or enough
cash that the seller or permitter will be willing to overlook the heinous
nature of whatever it is you are trying to obtain.

On high law worlds, LOTS of insignificant stuff is illegal, and so it is
easier to get someone to overlook "nuisance" laws, as the perception of the
value of a prohibition drops. Also, it is seemingly assumed thatmore and
more common things require permits, and thus getting them, no matter how
innocuous they seem, is harder to do legally, but slip some cash and
someone will point you to a black market, paperless source.

Basically, as the rules get tighter, people become more willing to overlook
them. As more activity becomes criminal, the punishments must either become
LESS harsh (if not, you reduce your population of available workers) or
non-lethal, non-lazy (IE, non-US, more USSR, more labor camps) work til you
drop. if everyone is under punishment, punishment seems less imposing...
which is why murderers kill murderers in prisons... what are you gonna do,
spank them??? One man I\'ve heard of locally (alaska) said that after his
first month in solitary, he preferred it. So he kept acting up to escape
his undesireable cell-mate by getting sent to solitary. He\'s out now, no
parole, but released, since he did nothing they could add time for, but
just enough to get sent to solitary.

Examples: it is easier to bribe prison guards (source: 3 different PG\'s I
know, invalid sample, yes, but anyway) in  rough High security facilities
than in facilitys than in permissive facilities with carpet and cable TV.
The guards I knew all admitted that they felt more compassion for the
prisoners in the harder prison than the soft one. Why? the softer prison\'s
inmates don\'t get enough punishment, in the eyes of the guards.

In buisiness: the more powerfull the individual, the more money he makes,
and thus the more money it takes to influence him. However, in high-control
societies, the ability to rise in income generally is lower, as is the
number of  clerks and enforcers at the lower end of the pay scales; thus
the less money is needed to bribe them. If the pay is low enough, they feel
they SHOULD be paid more to "just to their job", and many will get this by
graft, the collecting of bribes to "just do one\'s job". Only a few fields
in america suffer graft as a rule: Exotic Dancers, Bouncers in Strip
Joints, Dealers in certain casino games, politicians.

American Politics: The higher the political scales, the more we legislate
the ethics. the more we legislate, the more money is spent trying to
influence the politicians; the more you learn how they can be bribed, and
what to bribe them with, by eliminateing the other possibilities, the
easier it is to figure out HOW to bribe them... but it may not be CHEAPER...

Let\'s see, I think I remember the momlogue went something like this....

"Some belive that life here, began out there.  With tribes of humans, which 
may have been the ancestors of the Egyptian\'s, the Toltec\'s, or the Myan\'s. 
 Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man fighting to survive, 
beyond the heavens!"

Wow! Not bad for memorising something neary as old as Traveller itself!
(did that show come out in \'77? or \'78?)

and the closing monologue...

"Fleeing the Cylon Tyrany, the last Battlestar, Galactica.  Leads a rag-tag 
fugitive fleet on a lonely quest.  A bright shining planet, known as Earth!"

It is very posible to make a traveller/battlestar campain if we say that 
Cmdr. Adamma\'s lot are the last few surviving Vilani, have to tweak the 
history just a bit tho. ;-).

Yes!  I want to see a new Battlestar Galactica NOW!  If they can do it to 
Starwars, they can do it to BG!  But please wait untill B5 is done, or put 
it on now, but ghods forbid they put it in the same timeslots on diff chans!

Commander X from his office.

The snub pistol is a very low velocity weapon.  with a fairly large mass,
the recoil is negligble.  (About half what you would get from a .22 pistol)  

That\'s the reason for the HEAP round.. the ball rounds don\'t have enough
*oomph* to really penetrate, and the hollow-points, while providing an
adequate wound cavity, will pancake on tin foil.

<Description of Fusion Lance snipped>

I\'d be real wary of using a device designed to cut hull metal in the stress
of a combat situation.  You don\'t get a second cahnce with a weapon like that.

>This *should* be a possible device, but will the rules allow it?

My crack techs from GT are on it.

        Hey... this is a really great idea!  if you put a big fusion
generator and some T-plates on the asteroid, and start it going from way
out in the boonies in the Oort cloud, say, you could just pulverize entire
planets!  Woo hoo!


        <don\'t worry Harold, I\'m just kidding!>


        But seriously, though, if you\'re into mass planetary destruction
(and who isn\'t?), I\'d highly recommend Greg Bear\'s _Anvil of
<somethingorotherIforget>_:  alien Von Neumann robots invade Earth, start
building a series of *huge* fusion bombs along the undersea rifts between
the tectonic plates, and then drop a big lump of neutronium and a
corresponding lump of anti-neutronium into the planet:  they eventually
sink through to the core (not reacting with the planetary matter since
they\'re composed of neutral particles), and collide at the center of
gravity, thereby annihilating each other in a particle/antiparticle
reaction, timed to correspond with the fusion bombs detonating along the
fault lines...

        Pop goes the planet!

You are ignoring several real world considerations, like most chairborne
wargame lawyers usually do.  Sometimes these types of opponents are even
worse than stupid computer opponents.

Attacking an enemy\'s LOC has been successfully used throughout history. 
Hannibal, Moresby Raiders, Wolfpacks, French Resistance, Desert Rats,
VietCong, and Desert Storm are all example of the successful employment of
attacks against the enemy lines of communications.  Just because none of
the Traveller Combat systems take command and control (C2), lines of
communications, nor public opinions into account, does not detrack from
this being an great strategy in many instances.  Two examples: a delaying
action by an inferior force; and a supportive strategy as part of an
economy of force campaign.  They are many other examples, when this could
be effectively used.  The Yugoslav Resistance Fighters tied down 10 German
divisions during the war.  The wolfpacks and surface raiders tried up the
majority of the American and British fleets during the Battle of the
Atlantic.  Think of the ratio of tonnage for the battle.  The mere
possibility of a surface raider sent fear through convoys.  

Just because Traveller Rules don\'t accurately portray this doesn\'t mean
that it is a poor strategy.  It might very well mean that they are poor
rules for large scales operations (hmmm).  Imagine that!

II.  Missile Warheads

Nuclear Warheads

  X-Ray laser nuclear detonation warheads are the standard military weapon
system.  They are extremely destructive, expensive and effective.  Because
of this, they are restricted in sale to military units.  All values listed
below are taken directly from Fire, Fusion and Steel.

Yield:  Damage:    Volume by Tech Level:
                   9-10   11-12  13-14  15     MCr
 20kt   1-0 (x1d6) 0.195  0.160  0.132  0.103  0.60
 50kt   2-0 (x1d6) 0.265  0.220  0.188  0.147  0.90
100kt   3-0 (x1d6) 0.505  0.388  0.358  0.247  1.20
Ranged Damage      0/0    0/0    0/0    0/1    x10, vol x2

Volume:  in cubic meters
Mass:  warheads mass 1 tonne per kl
Range:  Normally, nuclear x-ray warheads only damage targets within the
same hex as the detonation itself.  At TL-15, the range can be extended to
the six hexes adjacent to the detonation hex by doubling the volume and
mass of the warhead.  The number of hits is reduced to 1d6-3 and damage is
halved (1-0, 2-1 and 3-1 for each size).  The warhead\'s price is multiplied
by x10.


High Explosive Warheads

  HE warheads are used in missiles available for civilian use.  Using them
requires considerable gunnery skill.  They have a blast radius of only 4
kilometers, and require a short-range fuzing laser to arm the warhead for
detonation.  Maneuvering the missile into prime detonation range is a
Formidable Gunnery task, modified by the following DMs:
     DM -2 per MP spent by defending ship on evasion
     DM -1 per 1/2 light-second (5 hexes) of range between each ship
     DM +1 per MP spent by gunner in missile maneuvering
Outstanding results cause 1d3 additional hits to the target.  If more than
one ship is in the target hex, the gunner must choose one to attack.

Mass = 2500 kg (2.5 tons)
Volume = 0.5 kiloliters
Type = HE Proximity Fuzed Prefragmented
Damage = Contact: 9  Distance: 1
         Blast Radius = 4000km
FFS Damage Stats: C:400 B:4000
Price = Cr125,000

Fuzing Lidars

Range            Power    MCr   Volume by Tech Level     Area
                                8     10    12    14

III.  Missile Propulsion

  Two types of propulsion are available for missiles; HEPlaR at TL-10 and
Thrusters at TL-12.  HEPlaR requires fuel and has a limited endurance, but
the engines are inexpensive and take up little space.  Thrusters are often
used in military missiles and have longer range, but are much more
expensive.  All values listed below are from Starships.

TL  Type       Thrust    Mass  Volume  Area  Power  MCr    FC
10  HEPlaR     100 tons  0.5   0.5     1.0   5.0    0.005  1.25 kl/hour
LHyd
12+ Thrusters  100 tons  5.0   3.0     1.0   2.5    0.600  power plant fuel


IV.  Power Plants

  All missiles use inexpensive Fusion+ power plants from the Central Supply
Catalog.  Often they carry more fuel than is necessary to power the missile
for its operational duration.

TL  Type    MW/kl  Mass/kl  MCr/kl  Area/kl  FC/kl    Fuel
                                             (100hr)

15  Fusion+ 9.8    1.0      0.010   9.8      0.150    H2O+


V.  Electronics
 
  Electronics is a catch-all category for guidance systems, communications,
sensors and computers.  All electronic systems are added according to
values listed in the Central Supply Catalog.
  Communications systems installed are typically military grade, small
vehicle Maser or Laser comms (regardless of military or civilian design). 
All missiles require at least one communicator for telemetry and command
guidance.  Redundant systems may be added if deemed necessary.
                                                     Volume

  Guidance computers must be installed for the missile to have any
independence.  Without one, the missile must be targeted and guided by a
live gunner.  Guidance computers must be of Rating-3 or better, at the
appropriate tech level.  Intelligent missiles have a Gunnery skill level
equal to the rating of the computer minus 3.
     Rating 3 Computers:                Rating 4 Computers:
     TL-10  60kg  0.060kl  MCr0.060

     TL-13   7kg  0.007kl  MCr0.007     TL-13   35kg  0.035kl  MCr0.070
   
  Sensors are military grade, small vehicle sensors.  The sensor type
required is determined by the role of the missile.  All missiles require a
Fuzing Lidar (listed above) for the gunner to place the missile within
optimal detonation range, but better sensors are installed at the
designer\'s option.
  Passive sensors are used in "silent kill" missiles.  They home in on
either the enemy ship\'s electromagnetic or Infrared emissions or use the
firing ship\'s active sensors to track the target.  Combined with
Thruster-based propulsion, passive seeker missiles can be an extremely
fast, stealthy, deadly weapon system.

  Active sensors are installed in independently homing missiles.  They
enable the missile to track and home on a target without the necessity of a
gunner\'s commands.  
  Gravitic sensors can be installed if the missile is intended to be used
as a semi- intelligent space mine.  The missile can loiter at the edge of a
mined system operating on minimal power, only becoming active when a
Thruster-equipped ship is detected by the missile\'s sensors.
  All missiles have IFF (Identify Friend and Foe) systems installed as part
of their guidance and sensor systems.

Guidance Type    Requirements
Command only     Fuzing Lidar, Laser/Maser Comm, MFD on ship
Active Seeker    Active sensor system of Orbital range or better
Passive Seeker   Passive sensor system of Orbital range or better

Yes, there are.  Pulsars.

As I understand it (and I\'m no astronomer, so I\'m ready to be corrected by
some of the astronomers on the list), the things are radio objects, and can
be observed by a radiotelescope (or passive EMS array, on a Traveller
starship).  Each one produces radio pulses with a distinct pulse rate, and
they (very slowly) "run down" over time.

Pulsars are located all over the galaxy, so a ship can emerge from jumpspace
practically anywhere and measure the angles and distances to known pulsars.
Since the pulsar\'s pulse rate is a known function of time (or distance from
the pulsar - which is really the same thing), the ship\'s location in time
and space can be computed by triangulation, and by comparing an accurate
timebase with the pulsar\'s pulses.

One of the little-publicized, but very important jobs of the Scout Service
is the benchmarking survey.  In such a survey, a scoutship jumps to a star
system, and collects data.  In addition to determining the basic
characteristics of the star and it\'s planets, they also observe pulsars, and
take very careful observations of nearby stars with known locations. 

This allows the Service to publish navigational information that lists
the pulsars that can be observed from that system, and their
characteristics.  The scout service can also compute the star\'s motion
through the galaxy, and the planets orbits around the star, to enable later
navigators to make accurate jumps into the system.

The scout service probably also undertakes deep exploration missions,
outside the borders of the Imperium, in the directions of the most useful
pulsars.  This allows the Scout Service to verify their projections of the
pulsar\'s changes in pulse rate, and allows accurate charts within Imperial
space for decades to come.

This should be do-able ... any astronomers out there want to check me?

Funny, that was one of the things I was going to suggest you change in the
next version of QSDS. I think the 25% discount should be _included_ in the
prices. Otherwise you get into trouple when you build a ship partly from
standard QSDS parts and partly from custom-designed parts because you can\'t
then apply a blanket 25% discount to the whole ship (unless you first 
multiply the price of the custom-designed bits by 1/3rd, which, I think
you\'ll agree, would be ugly. Besides, why impose the extra calculation of
the 25% deduction if it isn\'t necessary? 

One suggestion about discounts for multiple ships: Remember that in _TCS_
you get a full _40_ % discount for second and subsequent ships:? I suggest
that for single QSDS and part QSDS ships you only get the 25% discount on
the QSDS parts, but that for second and subsequent ships that are part of a 
production run, you get a further 20% price reduction. That would make the
total discount for such ships 40% (80% of 75% = 60%). Finally, let all
ships, including custom-designed ones, count as if made of standard modules
if they are part of a production run of more than some minimum size, say 20. 

That way you get a situation not too far from the old _TCS_ rules (The only 
place where there would be a difference is with custom-designed ships produced
in quantities less than 20 (or whatever). And my impression is that most
_TCS_ designs were produced in big lots. 

Another advantage is that the Free Trader (which with QSDS costs roughly 25%
more than an old CT Free Trader) with a further price reduction of 20% comes
down in price to something close to the CT price. I haven\'t tried to check
the designs of the other standard ships, but I would suspect that they, too,
would be somewhat more expensive than their CT counterparts.

What do you think?

   Assuming that you can find them.  It\'s been my experience that Steve
Jackson Games releases a campaign setting, then allows it to go out of
print pretty quickly.  It you don\'t catch it in the game store the first
time around, chances are you won\'t see it again.

   More rules are a good thing?  My biggest beef with GURPs has to do
with the 1 second combat rounds, which seem unrealistically short.

   If you aren\'t using all the stuff you\'ve installed, it\'s because you
don\'t have a group of players trying to get everything they can out of
their ship.  I have found that my players are constantly looking for new
ways to use the equipment that is on their ship, and from time to time I
reward their creativity.

   I have found the opposite to be true: SDB are nasty vessels when
they are used correctly.  They are employed best when *surprise* they
are used for ambushes near planets or in asteroid fields.  Simply equip
them with a really good passive EMS array, give them some sensor drones
and missiles to deploy, and they can take out ships many times their
size.

   Virus is only semi-magical if you ignore the classic Traveller
adventure Signal GK.  Virus is nothing more or less than a logical
extension of the silicon-based lifeform featured in that story.

   Given the egg that MT laid (let\'s face it--the DGP stuff was good,
but MT overall did not live up to classic Traveller\'s sales figures),
and the prevailing mood among the staff that something *different* had
to be done in the way of storyline, the post-Collapse milieu was one
possible logical result (though as I have previously indicated, it was
perhaps not the best result for customer retention purposes).

>The problem is that I\'ve yet to meet a Traveller referee that uses any

   Well I\'m one.  If by this comment you mean that no referee runs a
*pure* by the book game, you\'re probably right.  I have added my own
little touches here and there like everyone else.  Some of them come
from other GDW games (i.e. equipment from Twilight:2000), but others are
my own creation (i.e. sniper rules).

Is there a minimum AV required of starships as protection against
cosmic radiation, micrometeoroid, etc.? If so, shouldn\'t it be
required of missiles to ensure their electronics don\'t get damaged
until detonation?

Does the number of hits reduction mean that a successful Gunnery roll
can
still result in no hits (not sure I like this, especially when using an
expensive, effective nuke) or is a minimum of one hit assumed?

Why have a fusing laser? Why not have the missile arm automatically soon
after being launched or as part of the launching procedure? Per FF&S,
each
missile turret contains its own target guidance laser. Also, the text
lists a blast radius of 4 km but the stats after the text list a blast
radius of 4000 km.

Hmmm...I\'d personally want any missile I fire to be able to maneuver
regardless of the distance from a gravity well. Thrusters degrade
rapidly
in the outer reaches of some star systems. They would be stealthier
than HEPlaR, as you stated elsewhere, but only if the target doesn\'t
have
gravitic sensors.

Combine a PEMS array with the gravitic sensor and the missile becomes
much
more flexible with a wider possible range of targets.

All in all, I really like the direction your post is going. Enough
detail to
satisfy the gearhead in me and fast-moving for my referee side. Can\'t
wait
to see the rest!

Right! :)  And all joking aside, I think there\'s plenty of room for more 
MegaCorps in the Traveller universe.  Think of the number of major, 
multinational corporations in our own world.  Known Space is huge; 
there\'s plenty of room.

Another aspect is that, over the history of the Third Imperium, several 
MegaCorps could have risen and fallen prior to the years in which we\'re 
used to playing.

>How does the armour in CSC (Central Supply Catalog) equate with the armour

	They don\'t. Not at all. And that\'s unfortunate.

	During the rather hectic one week in which we had to design SSDS for Don
Perrin, we repeatedly asked which portions of FF&S were going to change
significantly. The only areas we were told to change were: fusion plant
minimum sizes (below TL12: x10), thruster plates (back as official
technology; cost x0.25), jump fuel (back to 10% per Jn) and contragravity
effects (back to providing lift AND thrust).

	I (and others) knew that Greg Porter would be designing Vehicles and
Weapons. Knowing that he was the author of "Guns, Guns, Guns," we figured
he would probably have a different perspective on weapons performance (and
hence armor ratings) than FF&S, and we asked (ad nauseam) for some guidance
as to how to handle them.

	All we got back from Don was "Stick with FF&S, with minimal changes as
absolutely necessary. We\'re coming out first; everybody after us will have
to conform to what we do with Starships. Greg will live with it." It was
frustrating, because I already had an idea as to what was coming, but I
hoped it was true.

	That was quite apparently NOT fully subscribed to by everybody at IG. For
what it\'s worth, at GenCon Greg showed me how he came up with the
(thickness)^0.33 factor, and it seemed reasonable. He had some research
results showing the penetration in steel of various size solid projectiles
at different velocities from just after WWII, and that\'s the equation that
matched best.

	However, he also chose quite different values for all the toughness
ratings for the materials. His rationale was that those values made things
work out the way he wanted. Originally, he didn\'t see any need to have
consistency between starships and planetary combat ratings--how often would
anybody shoot a personal weapon at a spacecraft? The list tried to convince
him, quite often.

>So, what is the answer? If I fire my CSC heavy tank\'s main gun at a QSDS or 
>SSDS starship, what happens?

	You ain\'t gonna like this answer:

	1 Take the SSDS armor value from the USP, convert it back to the original
rating (if necessary). That gives you the equivalent centimeters of steel
that FF&S used as its rating system. 

	2 Look up the material toughness for the armor type from FF&S

	3 Divide the armor rating by the toughness rating. This gives you the
actual thickness of the armor.

	4 Raise that thickness to the 1/3 power.

	5 Look up the material toughness rating from Vehicles.

	6 Multiply the new toughness rating by the result of step 4. That gives
you the new armor rating.

	As for what the results of the hit will be, can\'t say.

This disconnect is something that needs to be fixed in NAH, but how hasn\'t
been determined yet. It shouldn\'t require any serious changes in the design
sequence itself--that\'s just based on the hull thickness and material type.
But how the armor is rated at the end should be fairly easy to change.

And we may have the opportunity... remember the announcement about planned
fixes to the Starships book.

The "Imperial GPS" is what I have always done in my campaigns; or more 
precisely the "Local System GPS", as I have always thought that a 
universal time for an empire that it takes years to traverse was pointless.
When you come out of jump, local time is all that you (usually) are concerned
with....

I have also always pictured the 3rd Imperium\'s version of Western Union (the
xboat messaging service) as having a bank of readouts like the walls of 
clocks that you used to see behind the newscasters in ancient TV 
broadcasts... the ones with all the different times and the labels that read 
"Paris", "Rome", "London", etc... Only these would be calendar dates, two
for each planet on the xboat route: one listing the date for any incoming 
packets, and one for the date of any outgoing packets. F\'rinstance, for a 
planet 2 jumps away "Now" on that planet for any incoming messages is 
Jan 20th, and "Now" for any outgoing messages is Feb 17th (estimates, of 
course, unless your house rules define jump time exactly).... While any ol\'
space dog worth his salt knows this intuatively, it helps remind the yokels 
about relativity and all that....

Congrats, you\'ve just made my "You Know You\'ve Been Up Too Long When"

The saving throw (ah, memories) involves the *tens* digit, not the

Hmmm...  Not sure if the would SOP even on military ships unless the
likelihood of time distortion was "relatively" high...  [All puns should be

I\'m not an expert on pulsars, but I believe that they have a variable
period over time, and it would require a sufficient measurement interval to
determine "when" in the flux table we were...

This could be problematic...

GM: "Your jump took slightly less than the normal time, about six hours,
according to the ship clock.  It should be 211-13, 17:00 localtime..."

<interlude>

GM: "Welcome to HighPort Donnelly.  It is 204-13, 20:00 localtime.  What is
your cargo and destination..."

<pregnant pause>

PC: "@#$& it!  We\'re here before we left again, guys..."

That is all assuming that with the general and special theories of
relativity that we could EVER get any clock synchronized on an
Imperium-wide scale...  ;-(  Could just be that the local time/date
variance is about 24 hours...

I think that Mr. Blustein has a very important and valuable question...  If
the Xboat network is too unreliable to set the time, what do we use?

Can\'t think of any...

I\'d use the Xboat network to set these things...  but then I\'d recommend a
standard, unwavering "Jumps take 164.37896...<ad naseum> hours.  Period."

Come to think of it, that could create an entirely new mathematical
constant...  Anyone know of a nonterminal, nonrepeating decimal in that
general value range?  Didn\'t think so...  Now you do!!!  I hereby dub it
_Reed\'s j_, the universal jump time constant.  Heh.

Well, if you\'re in a surveyed system which has several stars, moons, or
planets, and have a good onboard navigational or astronomical program
which includes an ephemeris for that system, you can observe orbital
positions of the bodies and work back to a time.  The time obtained can be
as accurate as desired (down to hours, easily) given decent sensors and a
good ephemeris. 

You might have noticed that Data used this method to determine the current
time after following the Borg vessel into the past in ST:FC.  First he
gave a year, then when pressed he quickly narrowed it down to a specific
day and time.  I thought it was uncharacteristically sloppy of him to give
such a low-precision initial answer. :)

Given that this trick is specific to each system, it\'s not especially
useful as an interstellar standard.

Getting down to that time resolution is a *little* bit trickier, but
doable, especially with a couple hours\' observation of the system.

This very much fits that description.  You start with eliminating "Whoops,
um, Captain, Rhylanor is supposed to be way over *there*", and work
downward from that.

Oh, if you have a civilized system, then you just tune into the
equivalents of atomic clock radio and LORAN/GPS, and have a martini.  No
challenge at all to that. :)

One thing that could be done to set up the "Imperial GPS" is to have the
Imperial
Time Keeping Transponders(TM) reset by each xboat that comes through 
carrying a packet from Core (Sylea). Any xboat that goes out from Sylea has 
its internal clock set with the official Imperial Time Stamp(TM) and sends a 
burst to the Transponders upon arrival in system. This once again opens up the
problem of time passing at different speeds in different ships, but for
those who
choose to be "official" they just have to put up with the inconveniences of 
possibly having "official" time change with each xboat arriving. And since this
only concerns a few unimportant beaurocrats in the Office of Imperial Time
Keeping(TM), almost no one ever bothers to notice :-)

  Fleet orders were _pre-plotted_ a number of jump period turns
ahead equal to the strategy rating of the admiral in question,
e.g. a very good admiral had a rating of 1 or 2, and a 6 was a
liability.
  Also, the OB\'s can add info on 3rd Empire naval doctrine, as
I believe that most of the really furry BatRons arrived from

Doesn\'t that assume that you\'re within the correct solar "year"?  How big a

Wouldn\'t you have to have some referent time frame?  That might simply be

It gives you more flexibility. You know then that you can feel free

I\'d say no. The total distance travelled by a missile is a miniscule
fraction of that travelled by a spacecraft. Micrometeroid erosion of 
the hull would be so small as to be inconsequential.

This makes a LOT of sense, and will help reduce the cost of the commercial
ships (like the Free Trader and the Subsidized Merchant) to the point where
they could be reasonably profitable.

I think that, unless someone comes up with a REALLY good reason wny not,
this system (or something like it) will got into QSDS 2.x.

It does sound interesting...I\'m an old wargamer going back into the 60\'s. 
<g> I could go pull out Jutland, but it\'s a little later (and larger scale)
than I\'d prefer.

BTW, I\'m still thinking about how a ship can be temporarily
disabled...consider the following, but keep in mind that I\'m
currently battling the flu so I might not be to lucid right now.

Some portion of the maneuver drive has to be located outside the ship\'s
armor in order to work...that only stands to reason, and this applies to
thrusters as much as Heplar too.  Hits on this exposed part (call it the
"grommet" for now) degrades and eventually disables the drives until the
"grommet" can be repaired.  The "grommet" doesn\'t *have* to be expensive,
or even hard to repair, maybe it just takes *hours* of work to fix it.  Not
something you can fix during the heat of a battle, but pretty easy to fix
after one.  The expensive, impossible to fix part of the drive is buried
deep behind ship armor.  Now, a pirate has a way of stopping a merchant
from running (ie changing vector) without having to blow it to heck and
back...but they still need to board the merchantman to actually *take* it. 
Doesn\'t even *have* to break canon..(yuck, putuee)!  ;->

Doing the same thing with *cannon* might be a little harder.  ;->

OTOH Lasers have to expose focal, *maybe* fragile, arrays to fire. PAWS
have to expose their, *maybe fragile, channel bores. Missiles are harder,
but *some* part of the launcher must be external to armor or maybe an
access port has to be able to open...how hard is it to jam?  Meson cannon
are a real problem both offensively and defensively, because they fire from
*inside* armor and tear up the *inside* of a ship where the expensive,
can\'t be field fixed parts are located.  

IAC, for most weapons it might have fairly easy to damage parts (or
environments) that take them offline, but don\'t *destroy* them...things
like damaged aiming mechanisms, external hatches or ports blocked with
debris, turret jammed so they can\'t turn, cut power cables, or electronics
offline due to a shorted circuit, blown fuse, or whatever.  Any of these
things could take a weapon out of the fight, temporarily, until the problem
is fixed, but most of them *can* be fixed given time.

Ok, I know a warship will build in redundancy, and it will make it as hard
as possible for minor damage to disable a weapon.  I said this is harder. 
<g> But you know, many a tank has been knocked out of action by a jammed
turret, a blown barrel, or broken tracks only to be recovered, repaired,
and ready for action after a few hours of repair.
 
Folks, don\'t jump all over me about this, OK?  I\'m groping toward some
reasonable rationale here, and maybe some damage tables too. Maybe
something like:

                     Turret Laser Damage Table

Damage                          Task to repair
=============================================================
Circuit Breaker Shorted......Average, Electronics, (10 min)
Pointer, Off-line............Average, Sensors, (30 min)
Cut Power Cable..............Difficult, Electronics, (30 min)
Jammed Turret................Staggering, Mechanical, (60 min)
Focal Array Misaligned.......Staggering, Mechanical, (120 min) Cracked
Focal Array..........Impossible, Mechanical, (180 min) Grav Focus Unit
damaged......Replace, Difficult, Mechanical, (30
                             min) 
                             Fix, Staggering, Gravitic, (300 min) etc..                            


[Harder if done faster, easier if done more slowly.]


Do you see where I\'m going with this?  Am I making sense, or has the fever
clouded my brain?

I *know* this isn\'t canon, but I\'ve never been happy with the
"special fusion plant" explanation.  If this super-high energy plant can
power the jump drive, then why can\'t it be used for other things needing a
*huge* burst of energy.  Just imagine putting all that power into a pulsed
meson cannon...shudder!

Over the last 20 years, I\'ve settled on the following..  

0.  The ship has to sail out to an area of very low gravitational
influence, I require this to be about 200 stellar diameters, but others may
want to use the 100 diameter limit.

1.  Using energy from the ship\'s main power plant, the jump nodes (several
coils arranged, externally, in a ring around the ship\'s bow) create a
weakened region of space that extends like a shell around the ship.  This
requires a good deal of power from the power plant.

2.  The pinch nodes (several disc\'s, mounted externally and matched one for
one with the jump nodes, are arranged in a ring around the ship\'s stern)
pinch the jump shell shut behind the ship.  This part of the system
requires very little power, but is absolutely required.

3.  A quantity of matter equal to approximately 10% of the ship\'s volume
(maybe you can get by with 8% if you\'ve got a masterful Astrogator) is
rapidly injected through the jump nodes into the shell.  This is where
*all* the jump fuel goes in my system.

4.  The injected matter (let\'s just say purified hydrogen works best to
stay closer to canon, but personally I use absolutely pure water) interacts
with the jump field opening a rift between normal and jump space.  This
rift persists for 2 to 3 minutes (or until the ship actually jumps
whichever is shorter), looks like a shimmering shell, and then it and the
ship within disappears like a bubble bursting.

5.  During the 2 to 3 minute window, the Astrogator looks into the "jump
tank" and finds the grav source of the body he wants to jump to (I only
allow jumping from star to star, so the grav sources are all stars, but
there\'s no reason that you couldn\'t jump to a planetary grav source...if
you can pick it up.)

6.  The "distance" the ship can jump isn\'t primarily dependent on the
amount of fuel injected, power expended, or volume of the jump drive
components.  The "distance" a ship can jump depends mainly on the *quality*
of the ship\'s sensors and the skill of the Astrogator! At progressively
higher tech levels the specialized jump sensors used by the Astrogator are
able to *resolve* grav sources at greater and greater distances.

7.  The Astrogator has to complete *tasks* to locate the proper grav
source, lock the grav pulse generator on the correct grav source and fire a
correctly aimed pulse.  The instant the pulse is fired the ship is
committed, and for it the universe disappears.

8.  The grav pulse links the ship to the grav source and the ship "jumps"
from here to there in an indeterminate amount of time. Theory says the
transfer is instantaneous, but no one can say for sure because..

9.  The jump field created by the injected matter takes 160+2d6 hours to
disperse.  Until the jump field disperses, the ship is isolated in jump
space completely cut off from the rest of the universe, neither here, nor
there, but *everywhere*.

10.  While the ship is isolated in Jump Space, it\'s hull grid must remain
powered and functioning to protect the ship from destruction.

11.  When the shell disperses, the ship emerges at the "jump limit" (define
it however you want..maybe x number of stellar diameters from the star, or
x number of planetary diameters, or whatever) with 2 to 3 minute surge of
photons and a massive gravity disturbance.

12.  If a misjump occurs, (due to damage, failed task rolls,
unpurified fuel, etc) several things could happen.  The ship could reemerge
right where it attempted to jump from.  It could take much longer for the
jump bubble to disperse keeping the ship in jump space for several weeks. 
The grav pulse might miss it\'s target and the ship will end up near *some*
grav source...somewhere and/or sometime.  Worst of all the ship might end
up dispersed over a 1296 square light year area as lots of high energy
particles. ;->


The biggest change this system makes is the amount of "jump fuel" used. 
It\'s not (10%_of_Ship_Volume x Jump_number), it\'s just
(10%_of_Ship_Volume).  Of course, you could require more matter be injected
to "make it possible to find and lock onto distant
locations" if you want to.

Another thing is there isn\'t *A* jump drive.  The jump system is made of up
a number of parts scattered all over the ship where all the parts have to
work if you are going to jump.  The reason I have the jump nodes and jump
ring composed of several units is so the system can be degraded and still
*partially* work..it can also be used as a stl maneuver system running in a
different mode, but that\'s a different post.  ;->

It\'s a different way of doing things, but variety is good.

You\'re correct, William.  T4 uses the same calculation as Classic Traveller.
MegaTraveller reduced the jump fuel requirement because of the vastly
increased size of a ship\'s power plant and power plant fuel consumption.
Traveller: The New Era kept MegaTraveller\'s lower jump fuel requirement,
because the fuel-comsuming HEPlaR drive was the only official starship
drive in that game.  T4 returned to the Classic-Traveller style maneuver
drives, and consequently increased the jump fuel requirement.  This was a
deliberate (and carefully-thought-out) change.

Dave is correct in that ships don\'t generally carry fuel for multiple
maximum-range jumps, and (for jump numbers over 4), cannot do so.

Okay, here goes:

QSDS is the Quick Ship Design System (written by yours truly).  Version 1.0
appears in your copy of the _Marc Miller\'s Traveller_ main rulebook.  The
current version (1.4 as of the current writing, but 2.0 is under
preparation) can always be found at: http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar/qsds/

SSDS is the Standard Ship Design System, written by Dave Golden.  It appears
in the _Starships_ suppliment for T4.  A version may be available on the
world-wide web, too.  Check Dave\'s homepage, http://www.usa.net/~goldendj/
for more information.

VDS is Greg Porter\'s Vehicle Design System, which is aimed at vehicles (such
as cars, tanks, aircraft, and orbital craft) rather than starships.  VDS
appears in the _Central Supply Catalog_ suppliment for Milieu 0.

FFS (or FF&S) is _Fire, Fusion, and Steel_.  This was the design system for
the previous version of Traveller, _Traveller: The New Era_.  It was
published by Game Designers\' Workshop, and is now out of print (although I
believe many game stores and distributors still have copies in stock).  FFS
was the basis for both SSDS and QSDS.

NAH is the projected _Naval Architect\'s Handbook_.  It is currently being
prepared, under the direction of Dave Golden, and will be a complete
revision of FFS for T4.  The project is not complete, although draft
materials for some parts of NAH may be available from Dave\'s website.

Well, all my rules are written in Swedish and so is my design system. The
design system BTW consists only of some spreadsheets in Excel, there is no
paper version.

Are there any Swedish Traveller users that might be interested in a
personal combat system, task system, space combat system, ship design et c?
Let me know by e-mail so people not fluent in swedish don\'t get mad.
Just a warning: I my own TL progression and take on starship weaponry and

For instance, a traveller displacement ton represent aprox 5 kl in my system.
I felt that starships were too big for my tastes and also made the old
deckplans usable but with 1x1 m grid and 2.5 m per deck. I also have some
deckplans of Scout, Free trader, FarTrader, Lafayette colonial transport et

> How does a starship generate the energy sufficient to engage the jump

In T4, the ship\'s power plant is used to charge the jump drive (presumably
some type of energy storage device, roughly equivalent to capacitors;
depending on your campaign, it could be homopolar generators,
superconducting energy storage units, or other PSG*).   Typically, the
entire output is used for 10 or 20 minutes to charge the drive.

The main use of the power plant rating number (in Traveller starship
descriptions) is to determine the charging time for the jump drive:
if the power plant rating is equal to the jump number being attempted,
charging the drive requires 20 minutes.  Higher or lower power plant
ratings require more or less time (thus, a power plant rated at twice
the jump number chan charge the drive in 10 minutes; one rated at half
the jump number takes 40 minutes to charge the drive).

It\'s a long-standing Vilani tradition (practiced in the Sylean Federation
and the Imperium, but not by the Solomani) to divert all power possible
to the jump drive (to the point of running the life support system on
minimum power, and shutting off most of the interior lights) to reduce
the charging time to a minimum.

Once the drive is fully charged, the jump sequence begins, and the ship
enters jumpspace less than ten minutes later.  During the jump sequence,
virtually all of the jump drive fuel and virtually all of the stored power
are expended (before the ship fully enters jumpspace).  Delaying the jump
once the drive is fully charged is risky - there\'s a chance that the energy
storage will break down, possibly damaging or destroying the ship.

Once the ship is in jumpspace, its course is set and it is out of contact
with the rest of the universe.  It will re-emerge in normal space at the
appropriate time and place.  Some spacers claim to be able to tell a ship
has misjumped before the ship re-emerges (unusually high rates of space
sickness while in jumpspace, and an abnormally long time spent in jumpspace
are considered signs of a misjump), but ships can\'t determine their position
until they re-emerge from jumpspace. 

The jump drive needs a small amount of power (easily supplied by the power
plant, since maneuver drives are powered down in jumpspace) and fuel (the
amount remaining in the jump drive\'s internal surge tanks is sufficient) to
maintain the jump field around the ship while in jumpspace. 


* Note: PSG stands for Pseudo-Scientific Gobbledygook.  It\'s a technical
  term for science-fiction sounding terms that don\'t particularly mean
  anything, but sound as if they explain some facet of the game.


>  My research so far has turned up conflicting answers.

The answer has changed in the various editions of Traveller.
The answer above is for T4.  In MegaTraveller and Traveller: The New Era, a
jump drive was a miniature power plant that produced it\'s own energy for the
jump (by rapidly fusing the jump fuel).  In Classic Traveller, jump drives
required power from the ship\'s power plant (just as they do in T4).

Jeff, 

Don\'t use those types of armors in missile contruction, instead use
structurecomp unless you need the volume. The superdenses and crystalliron
add too much mass which will affect your design. I use a converted to
CSC/VDS armor called Chain Polymer that has a Toughness of 7, mass of .55t
and a cost of .016MCr/ton.

Have you looked at the article that Bertil Jonell and Guy Garnett put
together called "More Missiles For Traveller: The New Era"? It has lots of
good stuff in it like Kinetic Kill Missiles(KKM), KKE(HE), Cannisters, and
Proximity Nukes. It also has very good rules for using them.

Why not just use the primary sensor and have it trigger the warhead via

Hmmm,,, CSC/VDS allows automated firecontrol skill/rating of halve TL
rounded up, that is I use for the targeting of the warhead and I use the
CSC/VDS rules for Autopilot Computer for getting the bird to the target.
Also are the above computers dedicated?

Hmmm...small vehicle sensors??? sensors are either civilian or military in

Einstein was an old Solomani scientist whose theories were popular during
the 20th century (terran reckoning). When jumpdrives were developed (or a
bit earlier than that in fact) his theories were proven to be only
applicable to special cases, especially his rather naive philosophical
musings about measurements with clocks and rods.

Very interesting suggestions. More heretics on the list please.
One problem though; Is it possible to jump to the quite large grav source
known as Andromeda galaxy despite its large range? It is very dangerous to
allow long jumps because it may invalidate the reasons why the Imperium
looks the way it looks.

One idea (not original I confess) I\'ve been toying with is disallowing
jumps to deepspace. One has to (in my campaign) travel out to 128 000 km x
SQRT(m-planet) or 0.5 AU x SQRT(m-sol) in order to jump and your astrogator
has to be able to hit the shell this radius creates at the target therefore
making it easiest to jump to stars, then gasgiants and last planets. Maybe
one shouldn\'t be able to do deepspace jumping at all.

This would make the mains more believable and also make great adventure
hooks as the only way of crossing a 7 parsec rift is by sublight. Old
spacemen tell stories about the great planet engulfing behemoths that live
in interstellar space, untouched man in their tiny jumpships.

The main reason for a Task system is to help the ref devise rules on the
fly. The more easy to find rules there is the less important a task system
become.
1 second combat rounds are realistic but perhaps unplayable. GURPS has
tried to alleviate this with rules for "lulls" and "exchanges" where
combatants spend some time doing nothing between bouts of frantic action
but those rules seems hard to use with "rules lawyer" players.

Look at GURPS Vehicles, they have rules for air to air dogfights, ground
combat, car chases, sensors, off road travel, breakdowns et c that actually
use all the little details you put into a design. FF&S seems to be a system
for designing military starships and TL 7-8 MBT and then the guys went

SDBs are supposed to lie in wait in the outer system to pounce from behind
like wolfpacks. With Heplars time taken to go from GGs to mainworld is much
longer than jumping there so SDBs need J-drives. I like SDBs a lot but with
TNE Heplars I\'m afraid they\'re out.

My take on that is that you should design a RPG that you love to use and
play no matter what the market forces say. People go for quality no matter
the setting and any lack of interest on part of the designer will permeate
to the customer. There is also the problem of production time. If you
design something to fit the taste of the moment then when your product hit
the market the hip game will be out and your product will look like a
"rippoff of a game whose time has passed".

No really, I haven\'t met (in the flesh) any Traveller referee that used the
org combat system at all. I\'ve seen Traveller refs using GURPS, Runequest(!),
Azhanti High lightning, Phoeni Command, En Garde(!) but most of all entirely
homebrew systems. In my original small hometown (Mariestad) it was me and my
schoolmates that started roleplaying and maybe we set the style of gaming
from that.
In the army and when I did my physics studying I met a few refs but they used
homebrew systems as well.

My take is that it is a system of producing power over a very
short time tightly coupled so that the power goes right
into the jump field.  Producing the jump field is a huge
sink that the energy goes into so you don\'t have to find
a way of storing all that energy the way you would if you
were going to use it for something else.

I always pictured them as sources that operate at only a
fraction of the efficiency of a "normal" power plant but
are used because they can produce high outputs for short
periods.

ton carrier.
It will contain
3000 x fighters 15 tons
2 x 100,000 ton battle cruisers
3 x 50,000 ton heavy cruisers
10 x 5,000 ton cruisers
50 x 1,000 ton frigates
5 x defence stations

supported by a squadron of 2000 jump capable fighters 15 tons


This set up will be significantley large enough to pose a major threat to any 
system. Tactics, jump to the outer system, all ships leave the carrier, and 
fly to the inner system. Dropping probes in the outer system to create "noise" 
to make it look like I have a lot of reserves in their outer system.

The other bonus, the outer system is a safe place to leave the unarmed carrier 
ship, and if the system is heavier defended than expected, jump on to another 
system.

The mines I was going to employ in orbit were going to be scanner equipped.
They would drop out of orbit onto surface of planet, targeting industrial and 
agricultural and population centres. 
If any object of reasonable size came within distance x of it
If any 1 mine was tangled with
If any one was destroyed
If a signal from one of my ships was sent to it.
Or if a signal from another mine was sent to it

This would realy piss off the planets population, especialy when they find out 
how stranded they are, piss off the player as well, lost contact to a planet, 
no income, no ship docks to work with e.t.c

What do you think???

The u-boat idea would take up too much money for me, my carrier ships have 
taken any cash that would have funded this operation.

One other idea, an expesive one mind.
Set up in deep space a station capable of repairing and refueling ships, fuel 
would be shipped via special carriers to the station, if it is in deep space, 
provides a safe haven for raiding ships, an unknown base of operations to 
strike from.
take fuel ships with fleet, to allow multiple jumps, say to by pass a 
fortified system, jump to deep space, refuel and jump again. By passing his 
primary line of defence, and making him think you have superior jump 
engines.... Any thoughts on this one.
The high guard rules are being used for ship design. If that interests anyone.

Setting 3: The New Era & The Geonee Pocket Empire (1201)

Allegiance: Gc = Third Geonee Confederation

Rigaal   0928 E100367-8     Ni Lo Va    414 Gc   M1 V M8 D
	An outpost of the Confederation, established in 1196.

Hiponee 1027 A686674-B     Ni Ag Ri     221 Gc    F3 V
	The population descends of refugees from Hard
Times. Having nothing but an empty, pleasant planet before
them, the population actually start growing immediately,
once the TL drop was accepted and the scarce present
nobles lost all influence. Recuperation was speed up in
1182, when a secret naval research station dating to
Rebellion times was discovered. Today, seven different
"Cities" manage their affairs independently, although limited
cooperation is possible through the City Confederacy. Most
of the traditional Geonee culture is maintained. The Starport
has been constructed in the last five years using resources
from all the Third Confederation. The old orbital complex is
partially active again.

Dreva 1028 E300847-7     Va Na       210 Gc     F1 V M6 D
	When the Virus struck, this TL 7 world suffered no
catastrophic, immediate effects. But, with all interstellar
trade gone, there was simply not enough food for the whole
population to survive. A revolution ended with the
assassination of all bureaucrats. Many people died from the
fighting and from starvation. Some cannibalism cases
occured. After a while, people started eating Chirpers as
meat. Later on, when the population stabilized and the
production of vegetables in the tunnels was significant, it
was obvious that Chirpers were the only source of food. The
survivors have already become used to eat them, so, rather
than become vegetarians, they developed the practice of
herding chirpers and using them as food. A determinant
factor was also that nothing totally unproductive could be
keeped, so, in order to allow Chirpers to survive, their meat
had to be consumed. This practice is viewed with disgust by
other Geonee worlds.

Lagna 1029 D110369-9      Ni Lo     531 Gc     G3 V M8 D
	A Permanent Salvaging Station of the Confederation
has been established to obtain technological items from this
once heavily populated, industrial, TL 16 system. Whole
starships have been recovered and refitted.

Stenardee 1130 E110261-8    Ni Lo     314 Gc     F3 V
	A Confederation base is under construction.

Ashavakuna 1131 C567654-9   Ni Ag Ri  810 Gc  F4 V M7 D
	This planet was not very heavily affected by the
Virus. The economy, based on exporting agroproducts,
receded greatly, but, although the production dropped, it was
far enough to sustain the local popualtion. The Central City
was only abandoned after 5 years, causing the collapse of
the democratic system. This left a power vacuum which was
later filled by  the  establishment of The Producers\' League,
an alliance of technocratical landlords which still governs the
planet. Most of the traditional Geonee culture is intact, with
the landlords taking the place of the nobility.

Prindee	1330 D443469-7  Ni Po O:1430  624 Gc  G2 D M6 D
	The low gravity and tainted atmosphere of this
planet have always made it unappealing for the Geonee.
Nevertheless, a new colony of Shiwonee was established in
1198.

Shiwonee 1430 BA86841-A  Ni An Ri  333 Gc  F7 VI M9 D
	Home of the Shiwonee minor human race, with 1.3
Gs and 1.5 atm presure. Geologically very active, with
frequent earthquakes and an important number of
volcanoes.
	The planet was left in complete chaos after the
artificially provoked earthquakes in Hard Times and the
Virus infection. The social organization disappeared almost
completely, substituted by practical, survival criteria. Twenty
years later, a Female Revolution re-unified the planet,
completely changing the Geonee culture. Shiwonee is now
governed by an egalitarian democratic system. The females
are granted equal rights, a fact that strucks Geonee from
other worlds.

Lost Geonee: The failed migration attempt towards Delphi in
Hard Times and the slavery practices associated to
Marquess Tanzer\'s Geoneecide left many Geonee stranded
in strange worlds when the Virus struck. It has been
speculated that some groups of Geonee could have survived
far away from the Geonee worlds. Some voices are claiming
that the Confederation should attempt to find the "Lost
Geonee".

sensor can be used as a neutrino communicator.  The plant could be
modulated to provide a modulated neutrino emission which could be picked
up on sensors elsewhere.  Since neutrinos don\'t like to interact with
normal matter, you can go right through planets with this.  Unlike a
meson communicator you don\'t have to aim it, so you don\'t have to know
exactly where the other ship is.

Baud rate might be a problem, based on how fast you can modulate your
fusion drive.  A maximum of a couple baud might be reasonable.  This is
similar to the ULF communications used for submarines.

I don\'t think this can be jammed.  If my particle physics is correct,
then neutrinos are quite expensive to produce.  Unless there is an
efficient mechanism to make neutrino-antineutrino pairs in an
accelerator, the only way to make them is through weak interactions,
such as in a fusion plant.  I don\'t think you could optimize a fusion
plant for neutrino yield without buring as much fuel as a regular plant
of the same neutrino yield.  Thus, in order to jam the signal you\'d need
a power plant much bigger than the transmitting ship.

I also can\'t think of any way to make a fusion plant give you a beam
of neutrinos.  Once they\'re created, you can\'t lense or reflect them.
Of course, SOM says that superdense reflects a few percent which might
be enough.  Gravitic lensing might be another option.

______________________________________________________________________________
The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service, Bureau of Ships, is pleased to
announce BuShips has selected Phoenix Corporation\'s submission as the 
winning proposal for IISS/BuShips 90037/03x7, an exploration and recontact 
scoutship meeting Office of Exploration requirement MIL-TD/41.  Their
proposal met the specification at the lowest cost, and included several
important habitability and growth features that will keep the P-200EX at
the forefront of the Scout Service\'s exploration and recontact efforts for
the forseeable future.

The Office of Exploration has an immediate requirement for these ships, and
contracts will be let for construction of ships as soon as the formal
specifications have been prepared by Phoenix Corporation and approved by
BuShips.  The Bureau will also be contacting several other yards of proven 
capability to provide a second-source manufacturing capability for these 
ships. 

A recap of requirement MIL-TD/41, and brief commentary on the successful
proposals follows this announcement.  The USP entries of all of the ships
are included in this announcement.  The full text of the proposals will be
made available shortly.

IISS OffExp Requirement MIL-TD/41:
Ships meeting the specification must:
- - Carry a Survey/Recontact team of 6 to 8 specialists.
- - Provide 16 dTons of cargo space for specialist equipment.
- - Provide 1 dTon cargo space per crewmember and specialist for consumables.
- - Be capable of one Jump-2 and 1G maneuver.
- - Be capable of wilderness refueling (skimming and purifying fuel).
- - Be armed and carry a gunner.
- - Provide for landing the Survey/Recontact team and their equipment.
- - Provide for long-term habitability for the crew and specialists.

JUDGE\'s NOTES: It\'s worth noting the things that the requirement does NOT
say: there is no mention of shops or labs, and there isn\'t a requirement for
a sickbay, redundant systems or high combat performance.  Since this contract
is going to be let to the lowest bidder, extra-cost items (like labs,
sickbays, or heavy armament) will make the design less competitive.  The
assumption is that the Scout Service doesn\'t see a need for this equipment in
_every_ starship (and so doesn\'t particularly want to pay for it).  If an
individual mission needs equipment, shops, or labs, these can be installed in
the specialist equipment area (which provides 16 dTons for this purpose).

The winning design, and the runners-up both follow a minimalist design
philosophy that meets the requirements without a lot of extra items (which
add extra cost to the design).  This is pretty much what I envisoned when I
wrote the specification: I was thinking of a big Scout/Courier, and not a
lab ship or a heavy patrol ship.

A general-purpose ship like this would have many uses in your Traveller
campaign.  By varying the eqiupment load (and the mix of skills in the
specialist personnel), the referee can tailor the ship to a particular
mission.  I would like to add that all of these designs are good, many are
quite imaginative and well-thought-out.  All would make useful additions to
almost any campaign.  Without further ado:

WINNER: Phoenix Corporation - P-200EX Exploration Scout (QSDS)

JUDGE\'S NOTES: This is the winning design, even after my errors in QSDS
(which affect the cost of the ship, increasing it to 64.5MCr, due to
the wrong costs for T-plate maneuver drives and jump drives) have been
taken into account.  This design is very similar to what I envisioned
when I wrote the specification.

In particular, the full large stateroom allocated to each crewmember, and
the use of the additional ("waste", or "extra") space as living spaces,
makes this design very attractive for long-term use.  The extra space
also helps the service lifetime of the ship: additional equipment can be
added to this space without compromising the overall design.

A NOTE ON USPs
As you can see from the rest of the submissions, there\'s a lot of variation
in the way people present USDs.  Here is the way I would have formatted
the USP for this ship:

Type P-200EX Exploration Scout

                                              Armor 0, Structure 6

I\'ve left the rest of the submissions in the format they were submitted,
because I haven\'t had a chance to re-format all of them.  The complete
submissions will be made available later.

JUDGE\'S NOTES: This design is very similar in may respects to the winning
entry.  The main functional differences are the provision of emergency low
berths and the observation raft (there are also some differences in the
electronics).  This design was better-liked than the Phoenix entry bu the
Exploration Office personnel; there is talk within the Exploration Office
of issuing a requirement for a second-source on the Survey/Recontact
starship contract so that examples of the Sunrise design can be purchased
as well.

                            1 Armor 12 Structure

JUDGE\'s NOTES: This design is similar to the above two, and has a better
sensor suite (which itself is part of the reason for a higher cost) and
extended jump range (the ship can perform 2 jumps between refueling).
However, habitability suffers since most of the crew and specialists are
required to use small staterooms (which is not good).  The lower
habitability, combined with the higher costs, was enough to cost Portsoy
Yard this contract.

The rest of the entries follow, in no particular order.

by civilian racing enthusiasts, the firm has yet to make a military sale.  ;-)

JUDGE\'S NOTES: This is a good, solid design for a very capable ship.  Ships
like this will probably be procured by the Scout Service, but not under the
current Survey/Recontact requirement.  The Scout Service may recommend that
GSbAG re-submit their proposal as a long-range Exploration/Survey ship.
This ship also had one of the best pieces of supporting text of any entry.

JUDGE\'s NOTES: I was wondering how many 300-ton ships would be submitted.
The size is a natural for the requirement, but is unfortunately not
cost-competitive with a 200-ton ship.  For the Scout Service\'s requirements,
a 200-ton ship also has a crew cost advantage: a 200-ton ship can be
operated on routine missions by a crew of 2.  Scouts are usually
cross-trained in a number of areas, so that if an emergency arises, the
survey specialists can be called upon to man additional crew positions.
Ships larger than 200 tons require full crewing for even routine
operations.

JUDGE\'s NOTES: Some of the Scout Service evaluators were wondering if this
ship was intended for the Navy\'s Long-Range Patrol requirement, instead of
the Scout Service\'s Survey/Recontact mission.  This is a highly capable ship
(particularly in terms of combat performance), but is much too large and
expensive for the MIL-TD/41 mission.  Such a ship might be operated by the
Navy, though.

JUDGE\'s NOTES: I wasn\'t able to determine which desigh system (QSDS or SSDS)
this ship was constructed with (the rest of the submission was as scrambled
as this USP is), and from some of the text it appeared that it may have been
designed using one of the FF&S design spreadsheets out there.  In any case,
the ship is too large and too expensive to be competitive.

JUDGE\'s NOTES: Another 300-ton design, this ship\'s cost is too high to be

respect to the RFP resulted in a high cost.  Famille Spofulam would do well
to offer this model for sale to corporations as private explorers.

Dave, does this mean that the final actual changes to FFS have yet to be
determined?  I see the list above (PP, T-Plates, J-Fuel, and CG) and I think
I remember these items being mentioned before.  Were these the only changed
made to FFS to do SSDS and QSDS?

Now, however, I interpret your statement above about NAH that there will be
additional changes made?  If that is correct, what are they (if you know
yet)?  Thanks for the help

    'body' => '        In my quest to write adventures for JTAS, I had to search high and
low for issue 25, in order to get a feel for what was being published, the
format, etc.  After many misadventures, I managed to get a copy this
weekend, and after reading both adventures, I must agree with Mr.
Alos-Ferrer\'s assertion.  Both adventures seemed to have serious problems,
though "Silver Moon" was by far the worst.
        The main problems with "Vestiges" is that it didn\'t seem very well
thought-out.  For instance:

        1.)  The research foundation carved an installation into the living
rock of a mountain, and no one noticed?  Who did the work, Secret Research
Installations Unlimited?
        2.) The researchers developed psi shields and a psionic dampening
field at TL 10?  Didn\'t think that was possible until TL 14 or 15.
        3.) The attack by the Order of Investigation (not appearing in this
adventure):
                a.) Since when do "sophisticated military teams"
spray-paint their logo all over their target, especially
                     considering that they\'re planning to bury the place
when they\'re done?  I suppose they could have
                     resorted to the graffiti before the decision to bury
the place was made- during the initial attack, say.
                     (Cover me, Jim- I\'m going to paint the logo!)
                b.) The team suffered two casualties.  Instead of recovering
the bodies and taking them back, they were
                     buried at the site ALONG WITH THEIR PERFECTLY GOOD
EQUIPMENT?  Maybe they got killed
                     painting the logos, and the LT was showing his
displeasure with them.
                c.) You have a well-armed, highly-trained commando team
attacking a site that they know is used for 
                     psionic research, yet they are unable to turn the
Nefarious Psionic Creature into chopped liver?
        4.) Show me a creature that can hibernate for 94 years and I\'ll show
you a beast with a serious obesity problem.  "Stasis" doesn\'t mean it simply
switches itself off and on at will.  There has to be some modicum of
neurological interaction going on to maintain minimal life.  That requires
energy, which would have to be stored in the body, which normally takes the
form of fat cells.
        5.) Finally, if the fusion reactor is "leaking" radiation from it\'s
magnetic bottles, doesn\'t it stand to reason that it would be leaking the
real high-energy stuff, like X-rays?  If the bottle is strong enough to
still contain the fusion reaction, it stands to reason that only the
upper-end radiation is going to be able to get past the magnetic field.  In
which case any character entering the reactor room is going to die, swiftly
and gruesomely.

        I won\'t even go into "Silver Moon".  Did anyone else notice that the
skill rolls used in both adventures were in MT format, not T4?  Were these
adventures submitted before the authors even had a chance to look at the T4
rules?
        Like T4, I think JTAS has great potential, once it gets past some
serious teething troubles.  I\'m doing my best to make my adventures as close
to canon as possible, as well as being both logical and entertaining.  If
and when they are published, I hope you guys will go after them hammer and
tongs, poking and prodding them for inconsistencies.  If any get past me, I
need to know, because it means I\'m falling down on the job.

Imperium\'s perspective, or even a tabloid-esque paranoid rant about the 
dangers of expanding interstellar civilization - \'look what happened to the 
Rule of Man....\' and \'do we really want to emulate the Villani Empire?\'

A ship plan would be nice, as would a new or old  minor human or alien 
race - maybe a report on the Vargr.

The TNS would be vital, though possibly under a \'new\' name.

One large and two-to three small adventures would be ideal, the large one 
would have to be pretty innovative, and really get the players into 
Milleau 0.

Apart from that, a personality or a list of new equipment wouldn\'t be bad.

Of course, if I saw art from Rob Caswell, Blair Renolds, or any of the 
\'old\' traveller artists, I\'d be pleased with almost anything (well, 
almost pleased.)

Well, I thought I\'d put it up on the web for two reasons, as opposed to
asking to get it on the list:

1) Too big. It would really flood the list if all the designs were
   posted, I think.
2) I wanted to make sure I had permission from all the authors to post
   the designs publically. Maybe everyone doesn\'t want the world to see
   their great design...

> >in QSDS/SSDS/etc? And how do the weapons equate?

Dave is quite correct: they don\'t really equate.  However, Greg Porter (the
author of CSC, and the designer of the T4 weapons and armor) has suggested a
procedure.

Dave Golden (goldendj@usa.net) wrote:

> [The conversion procedure suggested by Dave]

Greg Porter suggests in CSC that the armor be converted on the basis of
eqiuvalent thicknesses of hard steel.  This procedure is a little easier
than the one Dave outlined (*).  Here\'s the recommended (official)
conversion procedure for armor values:

1) If using QSDS (T4 starship) values, divide by 10 to get SSDS values.
2) Convert SSDS armor to cm of steel (eqivalent) using the table in SSDS.
3) Convert centimeters of steel to CSC (vehicle/personal) armor values
   by taking the cube root of this value, and multiplying the result by 6.

You can convert starship weapons to the personal/vehicle scale by taking the
short-range damage value by the same procedure.  NOTE that QSDS (T4
starship) weapon damage values do NOT need to be divided by 10 (just armor
values).

I\'ve prepared a table to handle most of the conversions you\'ll need in
the typical Traveller game.  Use the "SSDS Armor" column to convert
weapon penetrations.  See below.

David JAQUES-WATSON asked:
>If I fire my CSC heavy tank\'s main gun at a starship, what happens?

You can use the following table to convert the armor values.

QSDS	SSDS	CM	T4
Armor	Armor	Steel	Armor
0	0	10	13
10	1	20	16
20	2	40	21
30	3	80	26
40	4	120	30
50	5	160	33
60	6	200	35
70	7	250	38
80	8	300	40
90	9	400	44
100	10	500	48
110	11	750	55
120	12	1000	60
130	13	1250	65
140	14	1500	69
150	15	1750	72
160	16	2000	76
170	17	2500	81
180	18	3000	87
190	19	3500	91
200	20	4000	95

Example: A starship is being fired on by a grav tank.  The starship\'s USP
lists the armor as "20"; for purposes of resolving the fire, treat the
tank\'s target as (T4 personal/vehicle scale) armor value 21.  If the tank
penetrates, the referee should implement an internal hit.

It\'s also worth remembering that starship weapons and vehicle weapons are
very different beasts (even though the converted penetration may be the
same).  A laser-armed tank\'s main weapon fires a beam with a diameter
measured in centimeters.  A starship turret weapon fires a beam nearly
a meter in diameter.

While the tank\'s laser may hole the starship, the starship\'s return fire is
going to put the tank in a whole new world of hurt.  I\'d suggest that small
(vehicle) weapons firing at starships:
1) Not reduce starship armor factors, and
2) Not produce critical hits.

For starships firing at vehicles, IF the vehicle\'s armor rating is higher
than the damage value of the weapon, then the referee should implement
massive surface damage (antennas melted, firing ports fused shut, etc) but
no penetration of the interior.  If the starship\'s weapon penetrates the
armor of the vehicle, it\'s almost certainly toast.

For starships firing at personnel, the main question is wether or not there
are enough large pieces left to positively identify the casualty.


(*) Note: there are two valid approaches to converting between the armor
    systems.  Dave\'s approach is to re-rate the armor, as if the armor had
    been constructed using the CSC (vehicle) rules.  This approach will
    result in different amounts of protection before and after the
    conversion; thus, if 100cm of some type of armor were worth (say) a 
    meter of steel in one system, the same 100cm of armor may be worth
    750cm of steel in the other system.
    Greg\'s approach is to maintain the reletave protection of the armor, and
    ignore the actual thickness of the material.  This way, if the armor
    was equivalent to (say) a meter of steel in one system, it would be
    equivalent to a meter of steel in the other system.  Greg\'s conversion
    method has the additional advantages of being several steps shorter,
    and it is possible to use this method when you don\'t know the type
    of material the armor is made out of.
    The table I included (above) was computed using Greg\'s method, and is
    valid for any type of armor material.

Press Release:  034-0001  DSS-X "Planet X"

In gentlmanly conduct this morning, our glorius leader, Commander X, 
congratulated Andrew Vallance of the Phoenix Corporation in recieving the 
Emperor\'s Favor.  Mr. Vallance\'s company produced the  P-200EX Exploration 
Scout, which proved to be the most worthy design.

Wither the "Voyager"?  It is believed that the Commander has plans for that 
design as he was seen talking with the infamous "Men in Black" of Imperial 
Intelegence.

Press Release: 035-0001 DSS-X  "Planet X"

The Commander anounced today that the IIA(Imperial Inteligence Agency) has 
concluded an investigation of X-TEK Industries Incorporated and discovered 
some minor violations, especialy in submitting what was a corsair design 
,modifyed, as the "Voyager" ,to gain His Magesty\'s favor.  Cleon was not 
completely antagonised by this, as a matter of fact, as the Commander says, 
Cleon and more importantly the IIA have expressed an intrest in the Corsair 
design, but suggest adding top secret devices to the "Shaddenpanzer" Class 
corsair.  This ship is to be used eclusively by the IIA and is not to be 
sold to anyone not of proper security clearence.  It was either do this, or 
loose his buisness licence!  Of course the Commander agreed.  Production of 
this vessel, codename "Fnord" is now underway.

(The man comes out from behind the curtain)
(Character mode off)

I wish to express my congratulations to Andrew Vallance.  May he continue to 
keep the Traveller tradition, style, philosophy, comraderie, and most of of 
the FUN of the game alive, as do we all.

Well done, well done indeed!

something I\'ve always wanted.  Allow me to explain:

Traveller has always had numerous ships, but they all did different things -
I\'ve wanted a number of designs which did the same thing, with minor or
significant differences due to the design methodology.  Also, STARSHIPS
sucked...

So, I\'d like to propose that we, the TML, take the standard CT/MT ship
designs, starting with the old 100-ton Scout, develop a "specification"
for that design, and run a contest for that "specification".  The winning
design, and the others, represent everything from the standard Scout
procurement, to what they would buy in a pinch...

And with the Free Trader design, well, there really should be some 
significant differences between the way General Starships and Ling Standard
build their craft, while matching the same "specification".

Also, with the merchant ships, the new "specification" should match the
efficiencies of the trade/merchant system, and not necessarily the old
ship (although if they agree closely, that would be great).

And - we get 6 to 8 good scout designs...

I loved the contest - just wish I could understand QSDS enough to do this...

(1) This is really a topic for the gdw-beta list, because there\'s going to be
a *lot* of argument about the details (which is part of why no-one has 
discussed it yet.) I\'m sending this to both traveller-list and gdw-beta,
but I would recommend future discussion go only in gdw-beta

As others have pointed out, there\'s no reason to streamline them. Also, we
should have options for quarter-ton and one-ton missiles.
And armoured missiles.

The problem with these is that the target ship\'s own lasers can\'t possibly 
miss the incoming missile at ranges of 4 km. (Or, in fact, out to about
5000 km.) People have worked on design sketches for "BB" missiles with
fragmentation warheads that detonate at ranges of a few thousand km - those
are somewhat more practical (though still have trouble overcoming good point
defences.) 

>Fuzing Lidars
It\'s not clear why you need this - the main missile sensor will tell you when
to detonate.

We should also allow EAPlaC propulsion; although it\'s somewhat miraculously
good, it fits well with everyone\'s mental models of what a missile should
be like (cheap, moderate delta-V, expendable.) To get good performance
with EAPlaC (or even HEPlaR) you need to calculate delta-V 
correctly.

>12+ Thrusters  100 tons  5.0   3.0     1.0   2.5    0.600  power plant fuel
Thrusters have a minimum volume of 10 m3 (from CSC, and generally agreed
to by the beta-list.)

I would use the sensors from FFS, which are somewhat more realistic for
starship weapons. Note that a FFS PEMS implicitly includes gravitic sensors,
I think.

The historical origin of the meter is as 1/1000th of the kilometer,
which was defined to be one centigradient of arc of the earth\'s surface.
So the earth is defined to be 40,000 km in circumference.

More precise definitions have replaced this old standard.

My understanding is that Syleans do not use terran measurements, but
nobles, and the Imperium, being descended from old Terran naval rulers,
do.

  As I and Wildstar showed in the Missile article that scared GDW, 4km
is a looooong effective blast radius in space even for *nukes*.

My Cr 0.02:

	The duties of the planetary navies: defend their homeworlds.

	The duties of the subsector (duchy) navies: keep the spacelanes
open and trade going so the nobles can get rich.

	The duties of the Imperial navy: keep the subsector and
planetary navies from rebelling, strongarm client states into
compliance.

	All three kinds of navy serve the emperor (as per their oaths of
fealty) during times of interstellar war.

I\'ve a couple of questions about the formation of solar systems that I came
up with after downloading the source code for Accrete from the 3D 
starmap webpage (http://www.clark.net/pub/nyrath/starmap.html).  I set about
modifying the program so that it would generate the planets and moons after
prompting for solar mass and luminosity, but ran in to a few things I wasn\'t
sure about:

1)  What is the lower limit for the mass of a brown dwarf?  I\'ve found mention
of an upper limit on the \'net of .08 solar masses, but I didn\'t find a clear
mention of a lower limit.

2)  Are there any guidelines for the size of a world\'s satellites in relation
to the world itself (such as: a moon of a solid planet should mass less than
X% of its parent world, while the moon of a gas giant should mass less than Y%
of its parent world)?

Those are the only pressing questions I\'ve run into so far . . .

Any responses are appreciated.

I\'d assumed that missiles would occasionally be used in atmospheric
operations (orbital bombardment, etc), making streamlining desirable. 
Also, streamlined hulls minimize the amount of "jaggy things" on the
surface, making them easier to auto-load.  Seems to make sense to me;

The hulls designed in my post were built using VDS; I think an average VDS
armor value of 2 should be enough to protect against small micrometeor
hits, but I see no reason individual designers shouldn\'t increase the
armor.  The base AV won\'t provide any protection against lasers, and it
would be kind of hard to get any protection without decreasing the
missile\'s performance.

The hit reduction only applies to hits outside the det hex.  I think I may

Sorry about that; I wrote the system over several days and forgot to clean
up the typos.  The FF&S blast radius of a 2500kg warhead is 4000 meters,
not 4000 kilometers.

The fuzing laser is required on HE missiles for terminal guidance, to give
it the extra precision required on such systems.  That\'s also where the
guidance computer bonus comes in; a smarter missile gives the gunner an
edge in maneuvering the missile to its optimum detonation distance.  Nukes
don\'t need it; all you have to do is get the missile into the same hex and
then set it off.

It\'s worth noting that the Imperial Navy did indeed have a requirement for
just such a ship.  They classed them as Fleet Intruders (or "FlInt Boat";
and they generally had superior jump performance and unspectacular maneuver;
otherwise the ships generally resembled heavy cruisers.

Perhaps the most famous of the Fleet Intruders were the Azhanti High
Lightning class.  Although they were few in number, as the recipients of the
most bizarre naming scheme to come out of BuShips they were memorable, and
their exploits in the Solomani Rim War and the Frontier Wars have been the
subject of numerous books and popular movies ever since).

These ships were constructed at TL-14, and had J-5 performance and 2G
maneuver drives.  In the Fleet Intruder role, they were armed with a large
spinal gun, bay missiles, and turret lasers.  The ship also embarked two
squadrons of heavy fighters, in a 60,000-ton hull.  Full deckplans of the
ship were printed twice; once as part of the Azhanti High Lightning
boardgame, and once as part of a MT folio adventure, _Arrival Vengeance_.

The general idea was to mount hit-and-run raids on the enemy\'s rear
in an attempt to suprise lightly-escorted or unescorted civilian
ships or Naval auxiliaries in locations where there were few or no system
defenses.  Many Fleet Intruders came to sad ends when they were forced into
engagements with heavy SDBs or were trapped in situations where they didn\'t
have enough fuel to jump to safety; ideal operations would provide enough
fuel for insertion, with sufficient reserve so that the ship could jump to
a refueling point if system defenses were too strong.

The effectiveness of the FlInt Boat is arguable (and a good number of ships
operating in this rule were eventually lost), but the knowledge that enemy
Fleet Intruders are operating forces convoys to include large escorts (heavy
cruisers or battlecruisers) whenever they are operating in an area that
doesn\'t have heavy system defenses.  If nothing else, this draws a number of
capitol ships from offensive missions to defensive escort duty.

JTAS should go back to similar content to the original JTAS\'s.  That is:
 
     Contact: 
     Ship\'s Locker:
     From the Management:
     Just Detected:
     Beastiary:
     Casual Encounter:
     Traveller News Service:
     Feature Articles:
     Amber Zones:     
>
>Firstly I\'d like to see at least two Milleau 0 articles

Under the old JTAS format, there were typically four Feature Articles, and
two Amber Zones (varied from issue to issue).  JTAS(new) could devote two
articles to Mileau 0, and rotate two others thorough the other areas.  The
nice thing about past JTAS articles, in particular Amber Zones is they were
not highly tied to dates and times.  The two Amber Zone\'s could be split
with one for Mileau 0, and one rotating through the other eras.

Contact: was always one of my favorite columns.  Ships Locker could be
expanded to include deck plans for a new ship in each issue as well as
other equipment.  (We have to justify that 8x11 format).

>The TNS would be vital, though possibly under a \'new\' name.

TNS should be split between Mileu 0 and other eras as well.  I think
keeping it the Traveller News Service is essential.  Changing it in TNE was
a bad thing (IMO).  There are four years of time missing between 1112 and
1116 that could (should) be covered.

Typically the Amber Zone\'s were the small adventures, and you could devote
one of the major articles to be a big adventure.

>Apart from that, a personality or a list of new equipment wouldn\'t be bad.

Casual Encounter and Ship\'s Locker fit these bills.

True, but the arguement here, it seems to me, is whether one\'s entire army
should be made up of forces designed for this strategy.  The examples
cited above clearly do not support that more narrow contention.  Attacking
enemy communications and resources are good, but that\'s not the way to
victory.

A more correct statement is that the Russian Army tied down so many German
troops that defeat of the Yugoslavs was not possible.  Yugoslavia was
liberated when the German field army was defeated by Allied efforts.

					            ^^^^^^^
Please note that the losses caused by the German fleet came primarily
before the implementation of the convoy system - Allied naval commanders
managed to forget the lessons of WWI rather fast.  Escorted convoys had
far less to fear.  By the way, the Germans lost that particular war.

All damages are in CSC/VDS armor values. By the way a penetration of 135 is
equal to 800 cm of Toughness 15 armor material.

Cannister and prox nukes can be used in the antimissile role as well.

Tactics: Missile is guided to target area at cruising speed of 4-6Gs and
upon aquiring target sprints at max speed of 30G\'s. It will use it Gunnery
skill of 8 to hit the target, and its Pilot skill of 8 to get there.

Bertil or Guy
Is that missile article posted somewhere? I got mine via email.

Well streamling will allow your missile to be more usable under a variety

Well will EAPlac allow the missile to get evasion DM\'s? Using Contragrav
and Thruster plates will let you do that.

I take exception at the statement generally agreed, the reason for making
thruster plates to have a minimum size was to keep the planet killer
missiles/vehicles at from being rampant, but with a minimum size you just
get bigger planet killers. It has been shown on the GDW-Beta list that the
minimum size has no effect if a planet killer is designed, it just makes it
a bigger target to hit hopefully.

FFS sensors more realistic? Well tell us what a PEMS-10 resolution down to
in meters?

That is one item that needs to addressed in NAH, at what ranges can we read
the hull numbers off the target. We have been told that if you can
"resolve" it you can do that, but I believe that to be optimistic hand
waving. Take for example on the VLA at max range has resolution of one
Pixel that is x kilometers across, but the VLBA at max range has resolution
of one Pixel that is y kilometers across, x and y are not close to the same
size. But in FFS a range 10 sensors has the same resolution as a range 5
sensor ie they both can read the date on a large coin as an example. 

Also I believe that you are in error in stating that FFS PEMS inclued
gravitic sensors, densitometers are a separate sensor.

The one nice thing that the VDS sensor system is that you can detect and
track a target at max range but you generally do not have enough resolution
to use direct fire weapons on the target, example a TL 15 sensor say Lidar
with a range of far orbital 300,000km will be able to get a resolution of
15km, not good enough for a firing solution unless the target is really
huge. But you can engage the target with missiles and have chance of
hitting at that range. The VDS system restores missiles to the place that
they should be in long range attacks.

I will be following this message with missile/torpedo that I have designed
using VDS and all of its features.

In my system, the answer is no.  You can\'t jump directly to Andromeda,
nor can you jump from Core to the Galactic Core.  The limit is the
quality of the sensors available, and at levels of technology available
up to "Grandfather\'s" that limit is 6 parsecs.  [I may be a heretic, but

I don\'t allow jumping to deepspace, period.  In fact, I don\'t allow
jumps to anything smaller than a brown drawf.  I use 200 stellar
diameters as the jump limit for jumping out (the Astrogator can push it
and try to jump a little nearer at big DM\'s), and a 200 stellar diameter
as the drop out limit when jumping in.

One reason I require jumps only be between stars is to force ships into
star systems as choke points. The location of chains of stars (the
mains) is an important piece of geography and should play a big role in
the game. A fleet, or even a single ship, can\'t skirt around systems
jumping through deep space.  Of course, I also allow the possibility  of
"dark bodies" in the rifts that allow ships to cross them, but finding
one is virtually impossible...like searching for the "northwest
passage."  

Another thing that I do is define the subsector maps as JUMP MAPS. The
maps don\'t correspond directly to real space coordinates, but to jump
space coordinates.  This is how I handle the "but space isn\'t flat"
argument of players. ;->  I have wavered on just how this works,
sometimes there isn\'t any real relationship between where stars are in
normal space and where they appear to be in jump space (from A to B is a
Jump 1, but they are 43.4 ly apart in real space, and from B to C is
also a Jump 1, but they are only 12 ly apart), sometimes I\'ve pretended
that there is...just a loose relationship.  

I currently favor the no relationship model.  This way, simple
astronomical observations don\'t tell you anything about where you can
jump. You have to do your observations *inside* a jump field, and your
knowledge is limited to the range of your sensors...maybe only Jump 1
away in all directions.  Certainly, you might have maps, but the "jump
routes" slowly change over hundreds of years in unpredictible ways, so a
really old map is next to useless. Maps have to be updated regularly,
and exploration really does mean exploring the unknown.  It also means
some stars just aren\'t accessable at all...for unknown reasons, and
occasionally some at the edge of a jump level move *beyond* it and
become impossible to reach.  

Of course, before running a game you have to decide *how* you want to do
these things, and stick with it in that game. I write this kind of stuff
down, along with how the technology differs from the present day (and
the published material), and distribute it to the players as background
knowledge.  I also write up stuff that I *don\'t* tell them, and parcel
it out as they learn it. 

Deep Space Life

I\'ve also thought about the possibilities of space cows, and whales and
the orcas that feed on them.  I\'ve never actually used them in a
game...not yet anyway.   The deep space creatures would probably need to
*feed* near a star for energy, or would they haunt the Ooot belt eating
cometary bodies?  Maybe they only come into the warm to give birth? 
Could they use chemical reactions to produce enough energy to survive
out there? How could they have a fusion power source built into
themselves...could *that* evolve?  Can they jump?  Do they live mainly
*in* jump space?  Lot\'s of questions! Lot\'s of possibilities!

Well will EAPlac allow the missile to get evasion DM\'s? Using Contragrav
and Thruster plates will let you do that.

I take exception at the statement generally agreed, the reason for making
thruster plates to have a minimum size was to keep the planet killer
missiles/vehicles at from being rampant, but with a minimum size you just
get bigger planet killers. It has been shown on the GDW-Beta list that the
minimum size has no effect if a planet killer is designed, it just makes it
a bigger target to hit hopefully.

FFS sensors more realistic? Well tell us what a PEMS-10 resolution down to
in meters?

That is one item that needs to addressed in NAH, at what ranges can we read
the hull numbers off the target. We have been told that if you can
"resolve" it you can do that, but I believe that to be optimistic hand
waving. Take for example on the VLA at max range has resolution of one
Pixel that is x kilometers across, but the VLBA at max range has resolution
of one Pixel that is y kilometers across, x and y are not close to the same
size. But in FFS a range 10 sensors has the same resolution as a range 5
sensor ie they both can read the date on a large coin as an example. 

Also I believe that you are in error in stating that FFS PEMS inclued
gravitic sensors, densitometers are a separate sensor.

The one nice thing that the VDS sensor system is that you can detect and
track a target at max range but you generally do not have enough resolution
to use direct fire weapons on the target, example a TL 15 sensor say Lidar
with a range of far orbital 300,000km will be able to get a resolution of
15km, not good enough for a firing solution unless the target is really
huge. But you can engage the target with missiles and have chance of
hitting at that range. The VDS system restores missiles to the place that
they should be in long range attacks.

I will be following this message with missile/torpedo that I have designed
using VDS and all of its features.

The Table in CSC/VDS list Thruster plates as having a thrust of 40tons,
power of 1Mw, mass of 2tons, and a cost of .25MCr.

No rules are hard to use with "rules lawyers" players. When they start in
arguing about rules, just pick up your rulebook, slam it down HARD on the
table to get their attention and say in a loud voice:
        "I AM the rules!"

I\'ve only had to do this once; no more rules lawyering :) And no one quit
either.

P.S. I\'ve run GURPS for years. 1 second combat rounds are not unplayable.
They work like any other combat round in any other game. I think Traveller\'s
3 second rounds are probably a little better though.

Damn good question - and one that there isn\'t a good answer to. In part it
depends on your definition of a "brown dwarf", and in particular how you
distinguish it from a large planet. My personal favourite definition is that
a brown dwarf forms like a star - collapsing out of its own little
chunk of a molecular cloud - while a planet forms like, well, a planet - 
accreting out of planetesimals in the protoplanetary disk surrounding a 
already-mostly-formed star.

Since theoreticians don\'t understand how well either stars or planets form
to predict their masses, that definition doesn\'t actually help much, 
unfortunately.

Observationally, Marcy et al have discovered ever-increasing numbers of 
jovian planets - while brown dwarfs remain extremely rare (except possibly
a bunch of somewhat questionable detections by Mayor et al) (and one or
two direct imaging detections, GD165B and GL229B.) The putative brown 
dwarfs seem to trail of at 10-20 jupiter masses (0.01 - 0.02 solar masses)...
so maybe that\'s the cutoff.

Certainly nothing solid - all you can really go on is what we see in
our solar system. It\'s probably hard to accrete a earthsized planet and then
get it to be a moon of a gas giant, but not impossible...

Dammit, Joe, you just blew the cobwebs outta my brainbox once again!
Thanks!

A possible way to explain/justify things in M0 is by postulating a
period of megacorporate warfare in the last century of the Sylean
Federation era, with Cleon\'s Campaign being both an expression of
Imperial ambition AND a way to divert the megacorps from cutthroat
competition -- in the literal sense!

Well, there are also _regional_ megacorps -- business organizations with
megacorp-level influence in one domain/sector/subsector, but less in the
hinterlands.

Hmmm... I smell a GREAT idea for a T4 supplement and/or an extended JTAS
article: Megacorps of M0: Detailed writeup of a megacorp, specifying
such things as history, economic and astrographic spheres of influence,
operating style, assets, key personalities, ownership, etc.

This would also be a great Internet project, come to think of it. With
all the parallel-processing creativity and brainpower available on Da
List, it just might work as a collaborative project.

Yes, you\'re right. It\'s a 40% reduction in construction time, but only a 20%
reduction in price. But IIRC _High Guard_ gives a 40% discount.

Besides, in Year 0 any mere sector-wide corporation would also be Imperium-

The damage/pentration for the KE and KE(HE) is well under what it should be
the original missiles in the article had a mass of .85tons. If Bertil or
Guy could send me the formula(e) hopefully in a lesser form of math I will
work it out.

50000           121       96
100000          135       108

All damages are in CSC/VDS armor values. By the way a penetration of 135 is
equal to 800 cm of Toughness 15 armor material.

Cannister and prox nukes can be used in the antimissile role as well.

Tactics: Missile is guided to target area at cruising speed of 4-6Gs and
upon aquiring target sprints at max speed of 30G\'s. It will use it Gunnery
skill of 8 to hit the target, and its Pilot skill of 8 to get there.

Bertil or Guy
Is that missile article posted somewhere? I got mine via email.

If the prices given in the QSDS are already "discounted" they aren\'t

It\'s like going to one of those stores where everything in the place 
has a sale price on it every day of the week, every day of the year.

I\'d prefer to have "full" price available directly, so that it\'s
easier to figure repair costs and the like. (Designing ships is but
one use for the system. Things occasionally break, don\'t they? ;-)

*Book* 8 was a classic traveller product.  Probably not something they\'d
be advertising in COACC - a Megatraveller sourcebook (and a good one!).

I actually went to look at my copy when I saw this to confirm - looks like
something that never left the drawing board to me.  COACC was 1989, T:TNE
basic book was 1993 - seems like enough time to get a robot book out
(especially f much of it is cribbed from the CT book) probably too many
others got in the way before Megatraveller\'s end.

I cc\'d this to Loren Wiseman, maybe he\'ll be able to tell us (maybe
there\'s millions of copies unreleased in asecret warehouse...next to area 
51:)

        Excellent idea!  I whole heartedly concur, would be heavily into
it, and even if Wildstar would not be into it, would propose the following
if Wildstar and IG don\'t want to do it: a TML-run contest, with the judging
being done by the entrants.

        Somebody (let\'s call him the judge) would volunteer to coordinate a
contest (winner would recieve cookies, biscuits, huzzahs, and threats of
lawsuits from Famille Spofulam; the admiration of his or her peers,
basically).  Procedure would be one classic ship class per contest; the
ship class in question would be chosen by vote of those who intend to
submit designs.  A mission statement would be developped by TML\'ers (or
handed down from above by the powers that be; you know who you are) to
establish criteria for judging.  Submissions would be mailed to the judge.
Judging would be by those who submitted ships; the judge would collate the
entries into one document, and mail a copy out to each entrant.  Each
entrant would rank all the ships (save his own!) ordinally (i.e. first,
second, third, etc), giving comments where they found something
particularly cool or unbelieveably boneheaded, and mail the judge the
results of their ranking; the judge would average the numbers, anonymize
the comments and declare a winner, posting the results plus each design and
the comments on it.

        We could call it the TML Highly Unofficial & Democratic Design
Derby (THUDDD for short) or something.  I\'d be willing to handle the first
one.  The procedure I\'d proposed to follow would be as follows:

Day 1: Declare TUDD open; invite votes on ship class.

Day 7 (or sooner, as the case may be): Tally votes.  Open debate on precise
mission requirements, if need be (for a 200 td free trader, for example,
this is a no-brainer and this step could be skipped).

Day 14: Close debate on mission requirements, tabulate them, and post them,
declaring the TUDD open.

Day 28: Collate all entries, and mail a copy to each entrant.

Day 35 (Or earlier if all entrants return their ranking and comments
sooner): add up rankings, declare winner, post designs (anonymously if the
entrants so desire) plus anonymized comments.  TML\'ers applaud the winner,
and somebody else takes over the job.

        So... what do people think?  I think that the end result would be a
whole bunch of useful designs for us and a more developed and varied
universe for us to play in...  we might even want to think about JTAS
submissions or something.  And, the entire thing is democratic; the judge
just handles the mechanics, and the actual judging is done by the entrants
(in fact, if other TML\'ers wanted to join in they judging, I don\'t see why
they couldn\'t).


        Just one thing though: everyone ought to specify hull configuration
in the USD; it\'s easier to visualize that way.

Ah, the power of a selective quote. <g>

Refering to the table on page 64 of CDC, Thurster Plates also have a
minimum volume of 10m3 and a minimum thrust of 400t.  "While the minimum
volume is a solid lower boundary, the thrust can be manipulated to lower
levels..."

I think you\'re going to have to up your missile size if you want to use
thruster plates *and* stay official.

Considering the approach we all seem to have taken for our introduction of
ships, etc, we already have a good start.  Gridlore Technologies is based on
a character I started player back in 1978, and he\'s got a long history of
being a pain to Imperial offcials, he\'d port well to M:0.

I already know what that page says, but page 74 in FFS has no lower limit.
What I said above is why it was shoehorned into CSC/VDS, not that it was
"Canon" or "NonCanon".

Is 10 cubic meters before or after I take all surfaces radically sloped and
reduce the volume and crossectional area down to 2 cubic meters? The hand
waving for the 10m3 as with all hand waving does not withstand analysis.

With a 10m3 missile no point defense will be able to stop it, but the main
batteries will. Any upgunned point defense to deal with it will no longer
be point defense which could have some interesting twists. 

If the 10m3 had "valid" reason behind it would be more acceptable, but that
lower limit shares many things with the TNE AI Virus and the Chatterbox
Circuit. All of them not very well though thru, more a "Knee Jerk" solution
to a perceived/exagerated issues/problems.

If we change the equations for Meson Guns & PAs so that the bigger the gun
gets, not only do they do more damage but range is increased, DNs ought to
become viable again.  If DNs can get off a few rounds of fire before the
battlecruisers get into their own firing range, they should be able to
cripple or kill enough of the cruisers to make it impractical to take
cruisers up against an equal (financially anyway) concentration of DNs.

Power consumption can be twiddled so that as range increases, power goes up
enough that you need a *big* fusion plant to power it.  Properly adjusted,
you won\'t be able to fit a DN scale PA or MG and the necessary power plant
in anything less than a 250Kton hull, larger if you want fun stuff like 6G
plants, defenses, etc.

Right.  Dave and the rest of the GDW-Beta list are in the process of writing
the updates to FF&S (working title: Naval Architect\'s Handbook).  Until it
is completed, changes to the systems are possible.

Definite changes (used for SSDS and/or QSDS) include:
- - Power Plant (minimum size x10 for non "Fusion+" TLs.
- - T-Plates (cost reduced to 25% of FF&S, and now back in the canon).
- - Jump Drive (fuel now 10% of the hull volume per parsec, as in CT).
- - CG Lifters (now possible to produce lift and thrust, as in MT).
- - Lasers limited to a maximum energy of 50Mj*TL.
- - Nuclear Damper Screens (in SSDS).
- - New crewing levels (in QSDS and SSDS).

The crew calculations can also be different, depending on the level of
automation and computer support available.  The various options are detailed
in SSDS.

Also under consideration for revision are rules relating to weapon construction
including particle acellerator desigh, bay design, missile design, and
general revision of the entire work (adding descriptions and definitions,
cleaning up loopholes, and a general going-over).

> Now, however, I interpret your statement above about NAH that there will be

There will almost certainly be additional changes.

 If that is correct, what are they (if you know yet)?

We don\'t know yet.

This story has a very Milieu 0 feel to it.  Basically, an exploration team
goes to a low TL world after the Long Night and one of the members is
killed, butchered and eaten by the locals.  It turns out that due to a
genetic aberration, at puberty, male children need to eat the testosterone
rich flesh of an adult male (one male will suffice for 4 children) or they
won\'t become sexually mature.

Anderson\'s explanation is that in the early generations after the fall,
this mutation sprang up and the gene pool was so small that eventually
everyone carried it, and no one noticed because of the widespread
cannibalism caused due to lack of human consumable food.

To make a medium length story short, the high tech explorers eventually
figure out why their teammate was killed, and a solution (hormone
supplement pills).

I\'ve butchered the story, but it\'s a nasty little trick to spring on some
players.

"FSY announces modified ISS submission design for corporate market:

        Today, Hengabar Spofulam, head of FSY, announced the release of the
Lalemant-class Exploration Vessel.  Based on FSY\'s rejected Brebeuf-class
Recontact Scout BuShips proposal, the Lalemant features several
modifications to its initial design.  While based on the same 300td
airframe wedge hull, and similarly armed and armoured, the Lalemant\'s jump
range has been increased from jump-2 to jump-3, and the main maneuver drive
has been downrated from 3G to 2G.  The auxiliary 1G HEPlaR drive has been
removed altogether.  The Emergency Low Berth and sickbay have also been
removed.

        Stated Spofulam, "...these changes have permitted us to create a
vessel that has longer jump range, 17% more cargo capacity, vastly improved
accomodations, smaller crew, and identical sensors and armament, for a
price that is 10% less than our original ISS RFP design.  Any
resource-extraction or other corporation whose business requires the use of
exploration teams will doubtless find a Lalemant an invaluable tool that
will render them more competitive".  Our staff, while noting that one could
purchase 7.3 Type S Scouts for the price of a single Lalemant, state that
the longer jump range, larger crew and cargo capacity, on-board laboratory
facilities, superior sensor capabilities and greater endurance of the
Lalemant do indeed make it a far more capable exploration platform than the
inexpensive but minimalist Type S Scout.

        The accomodations on the Lalemant are reportedly more luxurious
than the orignial design; small staterooms are provided for the two
gunners, while all other crewmembers (one engineer, a sensors operator, a
pilot and astrogator, up to nine mission specialists, and a captain) rate
large staterooms, and an 84 cubic meter lounge is also provided (given the
limited, semi-custom production run expected, some of this space may be
convertible to cargo or laboratory space as needed).

        Our staff report that much of the reduction in price is due to the
removal of the 1G HEPlaR auxiliary drive and concomitantly oversized power
plant.  This design feature, while enabling some FSY designs to reach 9G
accelerations, is, according to our analysts, worthwhile only at the
high-performance end of the spectrum.  When used in lower-accelleration
vessels, the added expense and  power and volume requirements do not
justify their limited utility.

        Finally, the design staff at FSY have apparently been packed off en
masse for a 15-day "corporate team-building retreat"; it is rumoured that
higher management at Famille Spofulam are displeased at FSY\'s total
disregard for costs, and worry that this might impede their planned
expansion into the mass-market segment of the industry.  When contacted,
they refused to issue a comment, stating only that "the vicious allegation
that the retreat is being held at a prominent Sylean detoxification center
is base and groundless".

Repair costs should be based on the discounted cost.  The rationale is that
these things are manufactured in such quantity that you get a price break on
them.  Presumably, they break in such large quantities that you also get a
price break on the repairs (rather like getting repair parts for your Ford
versus your DeLorean).

Agreed.  I was merely trying to keep it in the "canon" (Grud, but I hate
that word) spirit of things.  As a matter of fact, a while ago I used FF&S
to build a set of 1-cubic meter EAPlaC missiles that had the same
performance as missiles of the same yield (10 and 20 kiloton).  It made for
a hellishly powerful fighter design.

And, as others have pointed out, 4000 meters is a pretty darn huge blast
radius even for nukes.  The numbers are straight out of FF&S; I hadn\'t
thought of the realism of it until now.  Maybe its the maximum saturation
distance for the thousands of scattered fragments...

>>Fuzing Lidars

True, unless the missile has no other sensors installed.  At low tech
levels, space limitations force a choice between "eyes" (sensors) and
"legs" (fuel tonnage).  The Fuzing Lidar is a way of putting some sort of
sensor on the thing without sacrificing range.  And civilian systems may
not necessarily have large, expensive military sensor systems installed.

Definitely.  When the T4 specs for EAPlaC are decided, I\'m sure many of us
will rejoice.

However, in SSDS they go all the way down to 100 tons of thrust, with NO

I agree with this as well.  However, I was trying to design a system that
/any/ player or GM can use, whether they are new to the game or are part of
the "old guard".  That meant using the most current material available,
wherever possible.

I\'m not sure that the FFS PEMS has gravitic sensors, though.  Let\'s see...
page 52... "...uses large antenna arrays to detect any electromagnetic
emissions from a potential target, such as heat or radio waves,...".  Nope,
nothing about gravitics.

   I totally disagree.  Were there design sequences that could stand
improvement?  Of course, otherwise we wouldn\'t have seen all the
backtracking they did over plasma and fusion weapons.  But that was an
exception to the general rule.  If anything, people complained because
things were *too* realistic: laser weapons don\'t look like WW II naval
guns, manuever drives require reaction mass, hand held lasers that
wouldn\'t penetrate rigid armor, etc.

   While classic Traveller mentions the Oort cloud as one possible
hiding place, remember a couple of things: first, just because Sol\'s
Oort cloud is so far out doesn\'t mean that the Oort clouds of other
stars are a similar distance away; second, there\'s nothing wrong with
designing SDBs with drop tanks so that they can cover longer distances
faster (particularly if they are intended to travel to the outer
system), or even prepositioning secret fuel depots to be used by SDBs in
case of invasion.

   Signal GK is a classic "Cold War" scenario, and I don\'t recall any

   You cannot completely ignore market forces.  GDW largely did, and you
see were it got them.  As for quality over style, I think the members of
this list can name at least a couple of high quality games that didn\'t
make it but should have, and a couple of games that were full of style
but were of weak quality and made it big anyway.  Quality may keep
people around (which explains why we\'re still here), but style keeps
them coming in the door, and as long as the number coming in exceeds the
number leaving, you\'ve got a successful game on your hands.

	You really thought VDS sensor section was SIMPLER than FF&S? I thought the
exact opposite from the early draft I saw. If I want to design a TL13.5
Mucosal Sensor, I\'d much rather go to the Mucosal Sensor table and look it
up, instead of going to the "Generic Sensor" table, looking up some
factors, and then reading through a page or more of text to find more
specific factors to multiply everything by.

	OTOH, VDS did provide more detailed descriptions of the sensor
capabilities as far as resolution, etc.

	However, I also felt the limitations of fixed range bands were less than
ideal. For space combat, I\'d really rather have the option to choose a
short range anywhere from 1 to however many hexes are available, based on
power and volume available, than be shoehorned into fixed range bands.

	\'Course, I hate fixed range bands anyway.

	I don\'t know. I\'m still waiting to find out exactly what involvement we\'ll
have with NAH, and how official it will be. However:

	- The original idea was that those changes were INTENDED to be the only
ones to be made to FF&S. FF&S2 was to be cleaned up & reorganized
version--any further changes had to be either absolutely critical, or in
areas that didn\'t impact QSDS/SSDS. We didn\'t want to build in
inconsistencies.

	- That idea was based on the assumption that later products would hew to
the party line given to us originally, which is why we so frantically tried
to get more detailed guidance. That didn\'t happen, and from the early draft
of the VDS I saw, there are some definite disconnects.

	- Given the disconnects between QSDS, SSDS and VDS, I think some more
changes _should_ be in the works. I really hate invalidating the original
stuff, but our efforts to avoid that seem to have come to naught.

	- What those changes will be I don\'t have a handle on yet.

as the Games club that i belong to used to be only RPG\'s and have between
40 and 70 people turn up, now it has a CCG night as well, the attendance
for RPG\'s has dropped to between 30-50 and CCG night is always above 60 and
has reached 100, if this trend keeps going and more people give up RPG\'s in

that between a quarter and half the rpgers also play CCG\'s).

        Are the weapon design rules going to be tweaked?  I noted that it
seems that guns are made of pretty much the same stuff from TL 3 onward
(light reciever weights at least ought to have composite materials as an
option to lower weight and boost price once they come in at TL-7, and for
the rest of the weapon as well as improved ones become available), and the
bipod rules are pretty bowbed.

While CCG contributes to the dimise of RPGs in general, much of the blame
must fall on the decisions those TSR people made. Remember that
Spelljammer tv show? Boardgames? VCR games? Etc.. The list goes on. Simply
put ADND is the only line in TSR\'s catalogue that makes money. They\'ve
tried to expand their horizon, but have met only failure. I heard there
are actually people who play that dice game inthe States, but that\'s only
rumour. Here in Toronto, I\'ve NEVER seen anyone play that game, even
though there are many CCG players. 
However, don\'t count them out yet. No matter how you look at it, they\'re
still the giant within the RPG industry. Their RPG products have gotten
much higher quality in the recent years. They are going to produce less
for even better quality in the coming year (although HOW they\'re going to
do that when they\'ve fired some of their best people remains to be seen).
I\'ve heard Mayfair Game have gone belly up. In the slim chance that some
of you don\'t know what Mayfair Games did, they\'ve produced/import some of
the best board games. For example, the "Rail" games, Cosmic Encounter,
recently Settlers of Catan. They\'ve also produced RPGs such as Chill and
Underground. 
I think there\'s something wrong with the gaming industry. While CCGs might
not be the sole contributor to ther downfall, the timing of the start of
the fall and the introduction of M:tG is perhaps more than just a
coincidence.

After complaing about QSDS I set out to create a faster system based on
QSDS 1.4.  The current results of this are available at
		ftp://members.aol.com/Brannalbin/t4/bsds.zip 
(BSDS stands for Basic Ship Design System).  The file is a zipped Winword
6.0 archive (I\'ll be happy to provide it in other formats if someone could
point me to any decent converters).

Most of the simplifications currently consist of rounding numbers (the
only fractions left currently are prices and I\'ll get rid of them,
too).  In a few tables the power costs for the equipment wwere removed
because they were too minor.  The layout has also been changed somewhat
and all calculations concerning surface areas have been changed to Hull
Strongpoint references (at the rate of about 1 to 100).  All this is
IMHO still not enough to have a truly fast system but it\'s a point to
start from.  I\'d really be interested in ideas and comments for further
improvements.

In the next days I\'ll tackle the prizes for the components involved and as
soon as I\'ve got a little more time I\'ll also add a customized design
sheet (a sheet more usable than that ugly thing included in Starships).

The resulting ships are less efficient than those created with QSDS but
that was to be expected.  I\'m not quite sure whether my simplifications of
numbers were too serious (being a newbie dies that to you) and therefor
would like some comments concerning this topic (not from the gearhead
point of view -- I know that it\'s too vague for you; please point out
other problems ;-).

First of all, TSR is definitley having troubles. They cancelled the Winter
Fantasy gaming con they always had here in the US due primarily to the fact
that they laid off so many of the people running the con from the RPGA that
they didn\'t have enough people to run it. TSR\'s problems seem to be due to
infighting and their inability to come up with any successful game other
than AD&D, plus a general downturn in the publishing end. I do not think
CCG\'s are involved; TSR has a CCG (Spellfire) and Dragon Dice, which I hear
is quite popular (and designed by GDW alumnus Lester Smith, who was also in
on the creation of T4).

Secondly, I think it is patently unfair to blame CCg\'s for the troubles of
the roleplaying game market. There is no question that from 1993-1995, CCG\'s
ate a large share of the gamer\'s money. I believe this was due to a number
of factors but chief among these were that they were the new thing, and
frankly there was nothing new and exciting in the RPG market.
White Wolf had pretty much exhausted the wave of enthusiasm for Vampire and
it\'s related games, and their arrogant attitude as displayed in their books
and magazines ticked off a lot of people. (Anyone remember "hey,
net-punks"?) Vampire was the last truly different RPG idea I remember. By
1996, however, the CCG market began to even out; one retailer I speak with
frequently said that other than Magic, Star Trek (all versions) and Star
Wars, most of his other CCG\'s fell to a trickle. This has had some effect on
the general gaming market, as distributors and retailers that OVER-invested
in CCG\'s paid the price for their overenthusiasm. Have RPG sales gone back
up since CCG\'s went down? I don\'t know. 

There\'s a new trend in RPG\'s; revival of classic games. Traveller, Chivalry
and Sorcery, Bushido. Villians and Vigilantes, and other games have returned
to the market, some in revised printings. There are some good new games out
there; FENG SHUI is one of the neatest games I\'ve seen in some time, and
shows a trend away from complexity and dark angst.
Steve Jackson Games continues to support GURPS, FASA seems to be doing ok,
and R.Talsorian/Hero\'s new FUZION system shows promise. Don\'t cry for RPG\'s
yet. TSR\'s problems (which have probably been amplified somewhat by the
Internet Disinformation Superhighway) are of their own making. I do not
think they spell the end of RPG\'s. Scapegoating CCG\'s is an easy thing to do
(GDW did it frequently toward the end) but, in my opinion, is inaccurate.

I think the idea behind the "discounted price" is like buying the stock 19.9
cu.ft. refrigerator rather than having a custom 20.3 cu.ft. one built.  The
items listed in QSDS are the most popular of the most popular and are
sitting on a shelf waiting to be installed, whereas the FFS unit is
non-standard and custom built.

Pick up 3G3.. that seems to have become the standard for T4 weapon design.
It\'s what Greg Porter is using, anyway.

I get much more realistic results with 3G3 than I ever did with FF&S.. in
that my M-16 came out at about 15lbs!

Well, I don\'t know if you are making a joke here or not, but BAB5 
really does get my vote for the best SF series in history, and I am a 
big Star Trek fan.  Heck, I grew up with Trek, but B5 is a pull no 
punches kind of show.  Any SF fan who gives it three or four shots 
will become hooked.

As for Dr. Who and Star Cops--this is where I thought you were 
joking.  I thought both of those were cheap space rip offs not even 
worth watching while you are working on your Traveller game.

If you are not joking, then to each his own.  I\'m glad you like B5 
though.

See ya,

yes, it sure does mean that all are equally likely to age. I agree that Int
Saves should start about 60, though.

All aging using same saves for given age is similar to CT/MT, but the
fomulaic method is easier to remember than 8/7/8 34-52, 7/6/7.....

>RFC:  is the new rule more realistic than the TNE/House rule?

*I* don\'t think so... but I do think TNE is just as broken a MECHANIC. In
TNE, characters linger on until ridiculously old ages since it averages 7
terms to reduce a 1111xx-x-x character to one attribute at 0, where aging
crisis occurs. Lucky players can have a 1111xx-x-x character for 28 years?
I doubt it.

I like the idea of aging saves NOT being tied to attributes (Heck, I played
CT all through puberty...), even though the results I see in T4 are too
steep a grade for my tastes. That is why I don\'t think T4\'s are more
realistic.

BTW, in MegaTraveller, Solomani have a different aging save table than
normal; it is one point easier across the board. Vilani use standard to 5
points easier. Chew on that...

Question for the answer team: how will vilani and solomani aging
differences be applied in T4?

I entered the Ship Design Contest, ( I did the Centaur Enterprises
Wayfarer), and even though I didn\'t win, I had alot of fun.  Its really
 neat seeing how other people approached the problem.  I think the
standard USD is lacking in detail.  It doesn\'t include many of the
details of the ship, such as what type of sensors the ship actually
has, just the range of the sensors.  But I guess that is what is in the
ship description.  

I guess I, like several other people, got caught up in giving the ship
nifty gizmos, rather than going for a totally bare bones approach.  

Another neat thing, is seeing how people came up with different names
for the same type of ship. I called my a Scout Cruiser, becuase I
thought that sounded really neat.  

I\'d definetly be interested in doing another contest of this type. It
doesn\'t even need to be a contest, maybe just a bunch of us designing
the same type of ship.

How do I put this...  i ran the largest independant Dr. Who fan club in
North America for several years, have met most of the actors, and still
enjoy the show.  It isn\'t hard SF, it\'s just fun.

Star Cops made an attempt to be hard SF.. it wasn\'t their fault they had no
budget.

Hi Peter,

Yes, actually there has been a bit of work done, but not much other than 
editing, typesetting, better explanations, and so on.  

I\'ve offered it to MWM for inclusion in whatever product he sees fit, 
should he be inclined to do so (and sent him a spiral bound hardcopy of 
it).  I haven\'t heard from him yet either way - but he\'s a busy person so 
I don\'t expect to anytime soon.  [G]  At any rate, I\'ve stopped work on 
it for now, since if he does want to include it he may have his own ideas 
for changes, in which case it would be rather counter-productive for me 
to have made changes from what he has in his hands. :)

So, there you have it.  I do hope you enjoy the version that is on the 
web site.  And if you have any suggestions, please do let me know; while 
I\'m not making changes, I am archiving suggestions for such a time as I 
may be able to return to work on the system.

        Just because we\'re quiet about it doesn\'t mean we don\'t like them.
Keep up the good work.

        IMHO, the more people post their homebrew material here (ships,
weapons, vehicles, TL-17 fusion-powered chainsaws, background, etc), the
better a resource the TML is.  This list has what... 500 subscribers?
There\'s going to somebody who\'s going to save it, and maybe even use it...
So don\'t worry.

there\'s enough interest in doing an unofficial and perhaps even
semi-organized design competition.  So, without further ado, I\'d like to
announce...

<fanfare of kazoos>

        ...The First (and maybe not the last) TML Highly Unofficial &
Democratic Design Derby (THUDDD)!

<larger, triumphant fanfare of kazoos>

        The winner will recieve a magnificent ASCII biscuit stamped with
Commander X\'s corporate logo (which I\'m sure he\'s gonna donate, right?
Riiight?) and whatever glory winning this sort of thing is worth.  I\'ll run
this THUDDD, after which any of you guys that want to try it are more than
welcome to do so.


        Step one is determining which classic ship we\'re going to take a
stab at redesigning.  So, first off, let\'s have a vote:  what would people
like to work on first?  Ethan Henry has suggested that we do the 600 td
Mercenary Cruiser.  I suggest that we discuss this until Sunday, at which
point I\'ll tally the votes, and we can all start designing.  I think that
as we\'re going to be working with classic designs (because that\'s what Don
McKinney suggested), with fairly obvious mission requirements, we shouldn\'t
have to spend any time discussing mission requirements.  So, the schedule
for this looks to be as follows:

        -Sunday 9 February: Ship Class votes tallied and competition opened.
        Contestants email me their entries.

        -Sunday 16 February: Competition closes.  I collate and post to the
        TML all entries.  TML\'ers rank entries according to whatever
        criteria they like (brutal coolosity?  Number of really really big
        guns?  Low berths to hangar tonnage ratio?  The design actually
        making sense?) and make comments if they so desire, and email
        results to me.

        -Saturday 22 February: I tally up the results, post all entries,
        with comments if any, announce the winner, and email him the
        biscuit (which I\'m sure the Commander will have done up in the
        meantime).  The winner basks in the applause of his peers,
        and we all carefully snip and save the resulting alternate
        designs for use in our campaigns. And if anyone else wants to
        launch another THUDDD, go right ahead!

        Hopefully, we\'ll all have fun, see multiple perspectives on what a
given sort of ship should look like and do, further explore the
implications of its mission requirement, and get a whole bunch of USDs with
which we can make our game universes a little more varied.

        So... which classic Traveller ship are you dying to redesign?  Let
the list know!  At the moment the vote stands at 1 for the 600td
"Basketball of Death" Merc Cruiser. This one might be worth doing since we
know that as it\'s presented in the T4 rule book it\'s broken, but whatever.
You guys call it.

This may not be the perfect forum to ask this, but I don\'t know of any

written up stats for the computer-link implant he had?  Could you send me
the stats and write-up for it? 

I\'ve looked at all the West End Star Wars books in my local stares and

radically different from, and significantly more complicate than ordinary
contragrav.  This rule helps make that distinction more clear.  However,
unlike nearly everything else in T4, Thrusters are unaffected by
increasing TL.  How about changing this so that thrusters can be made
smaller at higher TLs? 

TL:		Minimum Size	Minimum Thrust
TL 11-12	10 m3              400 tons
TL 13-14	 5 m3		200 tons
TL 15-16	 3 m3		100 tons

Uncoincidentally, the TL 15-16 version is the minimum size listed in
Starships on page 97. 

As for missiles, EAPlaC works great.  I back-of-the-enveloped a FF&S
design, with for a 7 m3 missile.  6 m3 of EAPlaC, and 1m3 of 500 KT
det-laser and guidance systems.  This nifty little toy can do 21! Gs for
640 seconds.  It can boost (and evade) continuously for 43,000 km and has
a final velocity of around 480,000 kph (135 km/sec).  With a good evasion
program it would be hard to get with a point defense system, it would do
lots of damage, and other than the warhead cost it would be *very* cheap. 

Sure, top-of-the-line military vessels might be using HEPlaR missiles, but
those are going to cost *lots* more.  This type of missile (likely with a
cheaper, less damaging, warhead would IMHO be standard for Scouts and
Merchants, as well as for many military support vessels. 

Btw, what the heck is EAPlaC?  There is no description in FF&S and I\'ve
never heard of it before.  My assumption for the name is this is some way
of turning solid fuel into a low grade, one use, plasma jet.

I think Allen is right here TSR problems are its owen.  IMHO it seems 
that their main problem is the loss of game designers.  With Gaygax 
gone GrayHawk died with him.  Now Tim has moved over to IG (smile) 
and TSR is not planing to put out in more Dark Sun this year last I 
heared.  Also Dragon Lance has died yes I the orginal better.  

As far as CCG I was talking to my Brother who knows a few of the

profit.

I also agree here and FENG SHUI is the next game on my reading list 
it looks really good.  I dont mind seeing old games revised thats one 
reason why I got T4.  Remember that we are the first generation to 
grow up with RPG and the marketing people who know there jobs are 
hoping to capture our money.  So just like the a few years ago  when we 
started to get 70s stuff back and movies made out of 50 TV shows the 
gamming industry well move to publish things we remember  happly.  If 
you dont belive me just remember where you were Friday night, making 
Mr Lucas 38. something millions more off a move you have most likely

I realize that this is a Traveller mailing list, and that everyone is
entitled to his own opinion, but I have to take issue with the above
statement, at least in relation to Doctor Who. I loved this show from the
first time I laid eyes on it. I am somewhat atypical for an American Whovian
as I actually prefer Peter Davison to Tom Baker. In truth, I like all 8 of them.

Doctor Who is a SCIENCE-FANTASY program, which is why it may not appeal to
the more hardcore science-fiction fans on this list, but I love it for the
immense possibilties that traveling through space AND time provides for
adventure. Doctor Who (at it\'s best) also has a sense of fun and whimsy that
makes it a totally enjoyable experience for me.

I cannot for the life of my figure out what Doctor Who could be a rip-off
of, The show premiered in 1963, BEFORE Star Trek, long before Star Wars. How
could it be a rip-off? Indeed, with it\'s awesome background of the Time
Lords of Gallifrey and the ability to replace it\'s star and reinvent itself
through regeneration, I consider Doctor Who to be one of the most ORIGINAL
shows on television anywhere!

Just my 0.02Cr worth...back to talking about Traveller.

Andrew, I  just want to say good job on the ship.

use of SSDS instead of QSDS, along with having _three_ custom-designed
cutters aboard rather than the substantially discounted standard models,
significantly inflated the price.  Okay, so I went a little overboard on
sensor packages too....  :-)

In the meantime, since that was my first ship design using SSDS, I\'m going
back to look at some of the ships already published.  I\'m hoping y\'all can
tell me whether that\'s a mistake in and of itself.

I\'m looking at the "Military Destroyer" (apparently designed by Don Perrin
himself?), published in "Starships," p. 60.  I used to do deckplans back
in my CT days, and thought this looked like a fun project while getting
back into the game.  So I\'ve tried to use the existing write-up to work
out the SSDS design of the vessel.

I can\'t fit four fifty-ton laser bays into the design -- only two.  My
price is MCr1240 rather than the MCr413 listed: three hundred percent?!. 
Crew is only 45 rather than 50, though I\'m not so worried about that. 

Given my fiscal troubles with the ABELARD, the cost is what worries me the
most.  What design system produced the Destroyer?  Am I totally misreading
the costs or rules for same in SSDS?  I\'ll make my worksheet available for
anyone who wants to check it out.  Right now I\'m just confused and a bit
shaken.

Good point. We do not want thrusterbased gravcars etc at lower TL\'s.
I prefer size limits like 10m3 + 0.025 x Th where Th is thrust in tons.
This makes the absolute min size a bit mor blurred. There will be a
theoretical min size and an economical min size.

What warhead cost? Any space missile would either have a nuclear warhead or
use kinetic energy. Each kilogram of mass on impact would pack the
equivalent of 2 tons of TNT at 135 km/s. HE and HEAP warheads are as silly
as wings and fins on vacuum only spaceships and nuke warheads are out
because of the Imperial Rules of War unless you design for the Imperium.

I\'m afraid to say it wasn\'t the lack of people to run it... my IISS Scouts

I think the CCG thing goes much deeper - the games are short sharp and
snappy - no waiting around for long descriptions, having to think through
cunning referee plots and certainly no actual \'thought\' about long-term
player development. CCGs are symbolic of the whizz-bang
32-pictures-flashing-by-in-a-second sort of TV and computer games that have
built up over the last 5-10 years. I know that I\'ve read articles stating
that the attention span of most youngsters is now significantly shorter than
previous generations. The idea of them having to sit down and read a fiction
book is abhorrent to them. So how do you get them into a RPG where at least
one guy (the ref) has to have read at least 300 pages odd (T4 rulebook plus
an adventure or background supplement) before you can start playing? CCG\'s
are *not* the problem, it\'s the whole mentality of the youth of today. About
all we can do is rebel by throwing that damnable satellite dish in the bin
and not letting your children out of the house each day until they\'ve read
at least a chapter from a decent sci-fi book! :-)

The simple answer is, the number of potential young RPG customers has
dramatically declined. This needn\'t continue to happen, and can be
counteracted to some degree by people getting out there and *demonstrating*
them to newbies. CCGs didn\'t just appeal to RPGers (thus draining part of
the RPG market cash) but also to lots of youngsters, because of the concept
of collectability; as a child I saw my fellows avidly spending cash on the
footballer collectable cards and the Trump card packs (these latter being
the clear predecessors of CCGs).

As Allen pointed out, at least Traveller does have a good following of many
years, with a background that isn\'t too difficult for new players to
understand. My one worry is that the revival in Star Wars this year will see
more newbies buying that than Traveller. Let\'s hope we can hold on to the
coat-tails!

Enough boring waffle.

moralistic like a lot of Trek is, B) its a five year storyline, unlike Trek
which at most is a two episode storyline, with occasional bad guys comeing
back in Future episodes (Q and the Borg for 2, and if you count the films
as well then add in Khan, who was in a CT episode then the main baddie in
Wrath of Khan)

So far i have the Pilot and the first 11 videos of BAB5 and still
collecting (this is just into season 2)

    'body' => 'I\'ve been thinking about how the various weapons
work and the more I look at sandcasters the more
I draw a blank. Just how do sandcasters work? From
what I understand they work by physically placing
a large number of smallish highly refractive
particles in the path of a laser; and they also
work against missiles by acting as a physical
barrier. Seems simple enough, a giant shotgun
sort of weapon (a comment in Striker about their
use as an antipersonnel weapon seems to bear this
out).

But heres the problem: they\'re an active defence.
How do they detect the incoming laserbeam? Any
sensor can only detect a beam when it arrives, so
you only see it when it hits you. Any sensor which
detects it at a distance can only get the
information back either at the same moment it hits
or (more likely) slightly after.

Now thinking about it, I\'ve come up with three
possible methods of operation, none of which appear
to be particularly convincing.

1) They are in fact a passive defence. A ship fires
its sandcasters more or less at random, providing
a sheild which effects any incoming beam. From what
I remember of the original Book 2 rules, this is
how it was implied they worked. However everything
since then contradicts this. As far as I\'m aware,
every system since then uses them in response to
specific incoming fire.

2) Laser weapons require the target to be illuminated
by a lower power targeting beam and the sandcaster
fires in response to this. This seems reasonable on
the face of it, but would lead to some interesting
tactical situations. A ship could mount additional
targeting lasers which would illuminated enemy ships
encouraging them to "waste" their sand canisters,
greatly reducing the effectiveness of sandcasters.
Or a ship could fire its lasers "blind" preventing
the enemy from using sandcasters at the cost of
reduced accuracy.

3) Sandcasters have some form of FTL detection
apperatus, possible working on the principle of short
range electron tunneling. The sandcaster detects the
laserbeam a short distance away from the hull and
automatically fires. The detection method is very
short ranged and therefore has only a few very
limited applications. However it does mean that
sandcaster would have to be a very advanced weapon
system, certainly not tech 7 as the rules indicate.

Can anyone else come up with any other explainations?

	This analysis assumes that an average person will be generated  with a
UPP of 7777xx.  This analysis assumes that no attributes are raised
during charecter generation.
  	
	While this assumption is obviously false it will simplify our work &
besides since charecters die when any attribute hits zero they would
need to be in a service where they could raise all 4 stats for this to
affect their aging (Agent, Entertainer, or Rogue - not counting
mustering out bonuses).

	Next I would like to propose a method for handling aging for charecters
with Vilani blood.  In MegaTraveller a charecter with some Vilani blood
received a bonus to all aging throws of between +1 and +5 with a +4
representing an average pure Vilani (Vilani & Vargr by DGP).
I suggest that in T4 the bonus should instead be a negative modifier to
the Aging Target number. Thus if you are 50 years old (age on a 5 or
less) but are a full bolooded Vilani (+4 bonus) you will age on a 1 or
less and therefore you are unaffected by aging.

	Using this system I have calculated how long charecters with dfferent
amounts of Vilani blood will live.

Ammount of	Bonus to	Mean Age
Vilani Blood	Aging 		at Death

Mostly non-Vilani	+0		100
Mixed Lineage		+1		109.39
Mixed Lineage		+2		119.24
Mixed Lineage		+3		129.34
Average Pure Vilani	+4		139.24
Bloodline renowned	+5		149.24
for longevity 

	These results approximate those given in Vilani & Vargr which says that
"Genetically pure Vilani often have natural lifespans exceeding 130
years in length."  They do not match some CT references which said that
some Vilani live up to 200 years but I suggest that the 200 year figure
repesenta people secretly using anagathics, pro-Vilani propaganda, or
the Imperial record for long life.

	My next analysis will determine how old a charecter will_look_
This analysis assumes that humans with mostly non-Vilani blood are the
norm.  It further assumes that charecters who are at ages where they
will have lost the same ammount due to aging will look the same age.  In
other words if a 65 year old Solomani percon will have average stats 0f
5.193 a Vilani who has average stats of 5.193 will look 65 to the
average Solomani on the street. (Which presumably includes most of the
list.)  Age 15 through 35 are interpolated.

Setting 2: The Rebellion & The Geonee Cultural Region (1120)

Rigaal 0928 B100679-E	Ni Va Na  714 Li  M1 V M8 D
	In the surface of this small planet there are several
independent cities built using different techniques: domes,
underground and even one closed, mobile gravitic city.

Hiponee  1027 B686351-B  N  Ni Lo  721 Li  F3 V
	Traditional holidays residence of the Geonee
nobility, this planet is almost a paradise divided into private
states. Planetary affairs are managed by a council of
administrators designed by the nobles. A huge orbital
complex is home of the Naval base and the starport.

Dreva  1028 E30089D-7  Va Na  610 Li  F1 V M6 D
	600 million people live in underground cities and
tunnels in this pre-stellar technology planet, governed by an
oppressive paramilitary bureaucracy whose key positions are
usually in the hands of the Geonee nobility.

LAGNA	  1029 A110A97-G  Hi In Na   231 Li  G3 V M8 D
	This heavily populated system has a developed,
flowering hi-tech industry which uses raw materials from the
rich asteroid belts and exports products to dozens of worlds.
The Geonee nobility is strongly involved with the
bureaucratic government.

Stenardee  1130 B110346-D  Ni Lo   114 Li  F3 V
	The system is just an outpost, a starport maintained
for the convenience of interstellar commerce. The whole
population works in the starport facilities.

Ashavakuna  1131 B567622-9   Ni Ag  810 Li  F4 V M7 D
	The 8 million inhabitants are governed through a
decentralized participating, democratic system, with frequent
public votes on specific questions. They maintain huge
agricultural exploitations and export non-synthetic high-
quality food to other planets

Prindee	  1330 D443578-9  S  Ni Po  524 Li  G2 D M6 D
	The low gravity and tainted atmosphere of this
planet have always made it unappealing for the Geonee.
Nevertheless, the system is the only one that can be
reached from Shiwonee by Jump-1, and so has always had
Geonee presence. There are seven different political entities
here: four noble states, an independent democratic country
(home of the starport and the scout base) , a mining
company, and an arcology governed by an impersonal
bureaucracy.

Shiwonee  1430 AA86831-G N  Ni An Cp  433 Li F7 VI M9 D
	Home of the Shiwonee minor human race, with 1.3
Gs and 1.5 atm presure. Geologically very active, with
frequent earthquakes and an important number of
volcanoes.
	Short and stocky built (average 1.5 m tall, and 65
kg), the Geonee firmly believe that they are the Ancients. In
fact, the planet has an important Ancient site and a sizeable
Chirper population.
	The Geonee culture is oppressively male-
dominated. Protection of the women is seen as compulsory
(and so they are kept under lock and key!). Men must attract
a Chirper as a pet before they can marry.
	Shiwonee is governed by the Meraloo Council,
formed by 18 married men. Nowadays, in practice, all
members belong to the nobility. The most important member
is the Duke of Shiwonee, who holds the representativeness
of the Geonee worlds before the Imperium.

Tlasov  1328 A100663-F  Ni Va Na O:1430  903 Li  G0 V
	This is not a Geonee world, but it has been closely
associated to the Geonee history. In 626 the subsector
capital was moved from Tlasov to Shiwonee, and then
Tlasov economy collapsed. Geonee commercial interests
started to be very much involved in local affaiis, and, in 796,
the Imperium acceded to settle Tlasov economic\'s debts by
converting the planet into a Shiwonee\'s colony (the official
title is "Protectorate").
	Geonee nobles and banks own all public firms and
all rights to the system\'s resources. The starport is, in
practice, a subsidiary of Shiwonee\'s. Some Geonee

need for advertising and the lack of it in the RPG industry. To be honest
with you, I haven\'t seen any ads for T4 in any GAME magazines, let alone
science-fiction magazines like ANALOG or mags like STARLOG, which you think
would be a prime place for Traveller to be advertised. This could be a major
limiting factor.
Yes, advertising costs money. You have to spend money to make money.
        And I also agree that the lack of back-cover text on the T4 books is
very anoying. One of my players picked up my copy of Central Supply Catalog
the other day and looked at the back and said "so what is this?"; the
significance of this only occured to me as I was reading your message.
        So, maybe we should put some gentle friendly pressure on Imperium
Games to do some advertising and explain what their books are all about on
the back.
They might even listen to us :)
        As for the state of the RPG industry; I refuse to abandon my
optimism even in the face of unassailable logic such as yours. <g>
Seriously, my take on Feng Shui wasn\'t that it was going to save the
industry; only the people who run it can do that. I merely meant that it
showed a trend in RPG design that I approved of; a FUN game without needless
complication and not set in a dark, depressing enviornment. That alone will
not prop up the industry.

You cant pre-deploy the sand, because manuvering will take you out of your
own protective cloud..unless you bring the cloud with you.

I see two possibilities (I do not believe there is canonical source for
sand explained to this level);

1).  The sand particles or pieces (I see them as larger, myself) are
"ionized" .  This allows them to be "towed" or "tractored" using
electromagnetic energy from the defending vessel.  Violent manuvering
(commonly used in combat) will eventually attrit the sand so that it gets
used up.  Sand is concentrated along the likely path of incoming fire
(i.e. where the bad guys are).

This has several possible hooks or implications (depending on how you look
at it).  First, a special munition or bean weapon should have (by now)
been developed which would disrupt or deionize the particles just prior to
laser fire (it could be said that this possibility is represented by the
random likelihood of penetrating the sand field).  Second, the sandcaster
turret now has an integral magnetic field generator which, I\'m sure, we
can all think of other uses for.

2).  Sand is launched *after* the initial beam hit.  Beam weapons in this
explanation require several seconds of contact to do real damage (not an
unlikely possibility).  The random factor of the sand intercepting the
beam represents how quickly the computer or operator can deploy the sand
in the right place. (in a matter of milliseconds, hopefully)

I like the first one better, although it has more opportunity for "player
abuse".  The second explanation is neater, but requires laser turrets to
change from the typical picture somewhat.

In an adventure once some players fired the sandcaster while on the
ground.  The referee described it as "A huge shotgun full of fragments of
broken glass, and as imprecise as it sounds."  In a half a second a field
full of gun-toting drug dealers (with whom we were conducting business)
and two player charaacters were reduced to so much hamburger.  It was not
pretty.

"Basketball of Death?"  We always used to call our 800ton Broadsword Class 
Merc Cruiser the "Happy Fun Ball", as in "Do not taunt the..."

I would like to build that sucker, I always did like the HFB(Happy Fun Ball) 
starships, and I have modified those thing to no tommorrow in CT,MT, and 
TNE!  Ah CT/MT...those were the days.

I will give but one secret to an old design I had for the TRUE HFB Merc 
Design
Do you realy need 2 50 ton mod cutters, or could you drop one and mayhaps 
make some room for lets say, a 50 to BAY WEAPON?  loose both and you get a 
100 ton bay!  Now stick a 100 ton PA bay or something in there.  Now do you 
know why we don\'t taunt the Happy Fun Ball?  );->   <---- the devil made me 
do it!

Yes my vote is for the 800Ton Merc Cruiser, I want to convert my HFB class 
cruiser to T4 and submit it.  this sounds like great fun.

Subject: 	What are sandcasters?

I\'ve been thinking about how the various weapons
work and the more I look at sandcasters the more
I draw a blank. Just how do sandcasters work? From
[munch]

This brings up the issue of ammunition for the sandcasters. Do you need
to buy new canisters of particles when you\'re in port? Or does it just
use the ship\'s waste and convert it into tiny particles?

But heres the problem: they\'re an active defence.
How do they detect the incoming laserbeam? Any
sensor can only detect a beam when it arrives, so
you only see it when it hits you. Any sensor which
detects it at a distance can only get the
information back either at the same moment it hits
or (more likely) slightly after.

How\'s this for an idea? With lasers, you don\'t aim and then shoot. You
shoot and then aim. If I have a beam laser and I\'m firing at you, I turn
on the beam when it\'s pointing somewhere in your vicinity and then move
it until it\'s focussed on you.

This gives rise to the possibility of detection of laser beams by the
energizing of interplanetary hydrogen before it hits you. I\'m anyone with
a better knowledge of physics than I (which will be just about everyone)
will point out why this can\'t work though.

A larger amount of energy is absobed via vapourisation.
The computer detects the change in the field due to missing sand
particles and informs the gunner, who must decide within milliseconds

This obviously means that the sand particles must be magnetic, and a
sancaster turret must produce a magnetic field to control the particles.
(1MW of power should be sufficient, I hope), and finally, such fine
detail of control of a magnetic feild must be possible (I envisage

I was a bit behind, so I didn\'t get a chance to respond to your post. I
am definitly interested in more on the Geonee.  I don\'t know much about
them, except that they are short, and think that they are the Ancients.
 My campaign is also set in the Reformation Coalition, so I am
definetly interested in what you have going on in Massilia sector.  

More information on the Confederation, would be useful.  What makes it
different from all the other pocket empires that people make up.  Were
those the only worlds  in the Confederation?  

Don\'t be discouraged, if you don\'t get many responses when you post
something big.  Most people just file things away for latter use.  Its
only if you make a mistake or make some kind of really wacked idea,
(for example Pogo Sticks :) )

        One of the less obvious problems with Starships is that some of the
designs are impossible; the Luxury Liner having more cubic meters in high
passage staterooms alone *than its entire hull displacement*, that sort of
thing.  As I\'ve already noted, somebody took a look at the Merc Cruiser and
found that it shouldn\'t physically be able to pack as many guns as it does.
And the ship prices are oddly low, too.  Methinks that they weren\'t using
the same system they gave us to do those ships.

        As for price discrepancies between QSDS and SSDS, I can\'t really
comment; I never bothered to learn QSDS.  Intuitively, SSDS ships do seem
more expensive, but hey... I don\'t think that you could have done the
Abelard with QSDS; I think the flexibility makes it the better system, even
if the prices are higher...  After all, this is a roleplaying game, and so
long as the ships are economically not unreasonable, I\'m not going to let a
slightly higher price tag bug me.

        By now you\'ve probably seen my THUDDD announcement post; any
suggestions as to what we should design first?
