Well, does that mean that magazine capacity can be calculated based on
the food storage rules in FF&S2?

Good thing that most of my warship designs under FF&S2 carry 26 weeks of
rations per crewmwnber/passenger....

Sure, if you follow the storyline as set out in the book. Personally, in my

Flame-throwers become a scary thing when you\'re not encased in a powered

Apologies to people who think this detail is boring but...

In a (possibly vain) attempt to talk Traveller, maybe I can share one
of my solutions to a problem put forward in one of our games.

The group were having to fly from an inner world in a system (A), to
a gas giant to refuel, jump out, pick up supplies from another world (B)
some 6 parsecs awayand then return to (A) refueling again before they
went in-system.

All this while being chased by system (A)\'s defending forces while in (A)\'s
system space. We were using DGP\'s Starship Operators Manual, and
the rules contained therin to calculate tansit time, by checking the
relative
positions of both worlds. My pedantic player piped up with the argument that
since the GG was outer system, with a much longer Orbital period then the
inner world, the course to use would be different. (We stopped the game for
about 5 mins while I worked orbital periods out - then used an arbitary hand
wave and said that at year 0, all worlds were in alignment all over the
galaxy)

(I know - big handwave,  but we were in a rush!) I then calcuated the position
of each world from the remainder left from the number of orbits done by each,
by using MOD(x) on a spreadsheet, divided by each by 6, and found out their
relative positions at each time concerned. In the end it saved them about 30%
of their transit time, and saved them from a good ass kicking by my SDB\'s.

Why, I hear you ask, didn\'t you just arbitrarilly make it up? Well I like to be
as detailed as I can, and it was a life or death situation for them..Plus it was kind
of fun for me too - good to have the old grey matter working occasionally.

I have since thought that a possible better alternative would be to use the earliest
date known in Traveller which IIRC is -300,000 to get plenty of variation in system\'s
postitions.

Again my apologies if this is boring trivial nonsense.

Wishing you all a happy and peaceful New Year.

I think that may be pushing it a little? How about a Penguin Launcher?

BTW must add the text saying \'No penguins were harmed....\' to the credits.
And tell James to hide the wrappers. Do we need an indirect fire diagram
for penguins?

This is an example of how this is somewhat subjective.  In my
campaigns a Gunner just needs 3 or 4 Gunnery skills (maybe on
or two at a high level) and some basic Armory.  A ships Engineer
needs 3 or 4 Mechanics skills (primarily Jump Drive, Maneuver
Drive, and Power Plant).  It sounds like, in your campaign,
a charcter was expected to be able to do anything.  In such
a campaign a skill of 16 might be as high as you will likely
go.

I\'ve seen campaigns like this.  The only thing I will say is that
I\'ve not seen skill 16 or 17 considered legendary.

I think I shall let brother Jesse answer this...  But, if you have a

Don\'t forget the Eidetic Memory advantage.  It makes mental skills much
easier to learn.  And computer (except Computer Operation) and engineering
skills will be boosted by the Mathematical Ability advantage.

That\'s sort of my point.  ;-> Those of us with lots of Traveller
experience, but little GURPS experience don\'t have a solid feel for
sufficience.  Of course, some of this depends on how difficulties
are set.

<whistle>

Looking at the 3d6 odds, I would think that a 14 or 15 would be
impressive.  You must modify difficulties a good bit more than I
would have thought.

Ok, 12 gives an unmodified 74% chance of success.  I\'d agree that
that is competent.

Interesting. 

So, in a comparison between GURPS and CT, do you see the progression
of skill levels for unmodified tasks resembling something like
this...

          3d6           2d6
         GURPS         Trav  
 Default   6    9%       3    8%

The 3 Mechanics specializations make sense, as would Gravitics and
Electronics.  Hum, my reading of the GURPS Engineering skill was
that it was concerned with the design of equipment rather than
repair/maintenance, perhaps a Mechanic (spaceship systems) is
needed for the general things.

I meant something different.

In Traveller we have Trader and Broker, two distinct skills with
different effects and uses.  In GURPS, both seem to be subsumed by
Merchant.  I suppose I could use specializations here just like with
Mechanic Merchant (trade), Merchant (brokerage), etc.

<grin> I don\'t run, especially, combat heavy games, but I don\'t run
especially safe ones either.  Characters are more apt to get killed
in non-combat situations than combat ones.  I\'d say it\'s more
important for the Engineer to be *really* good at Mechanic (Power
Systems) than something like Pistol.  I do get your point, though.

<grin> Differences in semantics.  To clarify for anyone not familar
with this subject.

In GURPS, to succeed at a task you roll under your skill...as
modified.  The unmodified skill is its chance of success at "normal
tasks."  More or less difficult tasks modify the skill level up or
down a few points.  From my reading of GURPS materials, the number
of points you modify a skill by is very much a "case by case"
situation.

In most versions of Traveller, all if you extend CT with the DGP
task system, we have a more formal system for grouping difficulties
into named "Task Difficulty Levels."  This is one area where I think
Traveller is *far* superior to GURPS.

From the scale you give below looks like you might agree with me. ;->

>-2 tricky
>-4 hard/difficult
>-6 very hard
>-8 formidible
>-10 almost impossible

First, I see only negative modifers here.  Are you saying that, for
you, a "Routine..if you know that skill you ought to be able to do
that" tasks roll at unmodifed skill levels?  If so, I can understand
where you would want higher skill levels than I would have expected.

Second, does a 2 point spread between difficulties work well?  I\'ve
been working with 2 and 3, 2 is a much cleaner mechanic, but 3 seems
to give better distributions of probablities.  Anyway, let me put
out two scales that use names familar to most fellow-Travellers...

Steps by 2

  +4 Simple         If you have any skill you should succeed.
  +2 Routine        Dabblers will succeed most of the time.
   0 Normal         Professionals will succeed most of the time.
  -2 Difficult      This is where most hard tasks fall.
  -4 Formidable     Most will fail, most of the time.
  -6 Staggering     Even the best fail almost all the time.
  -8 Hopeless       Not impossible, but next to it!

Comments

  1.  That\'s a whole lotta skills you\'ve got there!  At 36, it\'s
      about 20 more than most Traveller characters.  Is this unusual
      for a GURPS character?
      
  2.  I also didn\'t see any skills above 15, and only a few there.
      Most were 11 or 12.  That seems to mean he is *far* from
      guaranteed success on most tasks, even the normalish ones.

Well, I\'d say that my experiences with my own personal railgun
(for defensive purposes of course), show that a can of green
beans will work... IF it\'s the same size can... However, you may
have to adjust the figures a bit to allocate for the weight difference
between the two cans.
Of course, if you get a double barreled railgun, then you could have
a 3-course (Ravioli, Beans, Target) meal ready upon impact :-)

Later.

That\'s *8* skills you have to buy up!  <whistle> A competent 
Engineer probably won\'t have many skills outside the Engine Room at
this rate.  That\'s not *nessecerily* a bad thing, but...

Gravitics have to come in here somewhere.  It would be more
realistic to have specializations for different kinds of maneuver
drives Chemical Rocket, CG, TPlate, Fusion, HEPlaR...whatever.  The
character would only need one or two, usually, and you could default
on the others at some minus value.

That\'s how I read it.  A run of the mill Ship Engineer is a
different animal.

>Shouldn\'t there also be some sort of professional

I guess it depends on the number of skills and what levels they have
to be built up to.  Ideally, I\'d like each of the Ship Professions
(Engineering, Bridge, Steward, Medical, Gunnery) to have a set of 5
or 6 core skills that define competence within their profession,
with another few associated skills.  Then the character would have
another 8 to 10 skills providing flavor for the character.

Examples:

Engineering Core Competencies
  Power Systems (specialized)
  Manuever Drive (specialized)
  Jump Drive
  Gravitics
  Electronics (general, with various specializations)
  Mechanics  
  Life Support Repair

Steward Core Competencies
  Liasion
  Service (passenger care)
  Cargo Handling
  Administration
  Life Support Ops (perhaps Cooking & Cleaning fall here)
  
Medical
  Diagnosis
  Treatment
  Surgery
  Pharmacology
  Xenobiology
  
Bridge
  Pilot (Jump)
  Pilot (maneuver - specialization)
  Astrogation
  Sensor Ops
  Communication Ops

Gunnery
  Gunner (offensive - specialization)
  Gunner (defensive - specialization)
  Sensor Ops
  Comm Ops
  Ship Security


What do you think?

I might not call 16 "legendary", but I tend to agree with you.  I
think really competent characters should come in at 14 to 16 on
their *best* skills.  Of course, if you look at the descriptions on
the infamous p45 you will see SJG officially calls 12 Rather-skilled,
14 Well-trained and 16 and above Expert.

Maybe we can apply FUDGE skill descriptors here, and compare them to
the GURPS values from page 45 for reasonability?

Legendary*  18+
Superb      16     Expert
Great       14     Well-trained
Good        12     Rather-skilled
Fair        10     Average
Mediocre     8     Mediocre
Poor         6     Inept
Terrible     4
             3     Abysmal

*Which PC\'s aren\'t supposed to get to anyway.  ;-> 

I think this matches up pretty good.  It would match up with the
Step 2 Task Difficulty Levels I posted earlier too.

And because I have something of a block when it comes to creating

Of course, but then if you are using chemical drive, then you would be

It is. Actually, it can get worse than that. Character points are limited to
2 times the character\'s age ... but not the number of skills. Since GURPS
gives a player the ability to give a character 1/2 point in a skill, this
means that a potential munchkin can have 4x his age in skills ... *very*
annoying.

   I\'ve been tinkering with the trade model a little recently. 
   I decided to adapt the TNE model, and classify speculative trade goods
as raw materials, processed materials, manufactured goods, information, and
novelties. 
   I added a table which gives the chances of a cargo being one of these
types, depending on the world\'s trade class and influenced by the size of
the cargo. (Major cargoes tend to be natural resources; Incidental tend to
be information or novelties). Another table gives supply/demand modifiers
to purchase and sale price, also based on the world\'s trade class.  Types
of cargo are cheaper to obtain and sells for less where it is already
abundant; they are more expensive to obtain and sell for more where they
are scarce.  
   The base purchase price of all cargoes except raw materials is computed
as with the normal rules. For raw materials, Ignore the TL modifier and
instead, use modifiers based on the planetary Resources score of PE\'s
Economic extension to the UWP.  A price multiplier is rolled for, so that
not all cargoes cost the same. Raw Materials get a negative modifier so
that on the average they cost less than the base price. Manufactured goods
get a positive modifier so that they tend to cost more. The Supply/Demand
modifier of the market world for the type of cargo applies to this price
modifier.
  Base selling price for everything but raw materials is determined as
according to the "vanilla" rules, except that the price multiplier which
was determined with the goods were purchased applies. The marketworld
supply/demand modifier affects the role for actual sale price in addition
to the broker skill.
For raw materials, ignore TL effects on base selling price and use the
resource score of the marketworld instead. Apply the price multiplier and
roll for actual sale price as above.

Under the vanilla rules, a lot of two-way trade links are money losers,
since the expected profit on goods carried one way is more than offset by
the expected loss going the other direction. High brokerage skill only
partly compensates. 
Under this system, a trader who knows to carry food or forestry products
from a low TL Ag world to the neighboring high TL In HiPop world and
tractors and radios back has a chance at economic survival.

I just recently began working with this system and don\'t have extensive
experience with either it or the "vanilla" one. I can post the details if
anyone would like to try this system out and comment on it.

Organization of information is usually at least as much of a

Could I borrow the soapbox and make a heartfelt plea of my own?  Could

some of us pay for downloading it.  Look how Andrew selected the

I am not sure of the distance you could cover in a given period using this
method. How long would it take, for example, to "draw" a 10 miles line
using a laser? Would it be significantly faster than working on the surface? 
Also, what about collateral damage (like starting forest fires, or
accidentally killing natives, travelers and so on)?
Given the low TL the local people would perhaps prefer something they
understand (i.e. a fence-like structure, a series of posts) than a magical
death ray which neatly cauterizes everything on its way. I suppose that
some parties would be already enraged/suspicious by the fact that the team
is using "proprietary" tech to define the line, and this could create
political problems.

This will be the reason to use the scout over you as a mobile "reference
point" which could be used to define your position on the surface. This way
the calculations are made for you by the ship\'s computer/sensor, and you
just go on drawing the line over the surface.

The real fun starts when the line crosses a small town... or the sacred
burial ground of native ... or neatly bisect a gold mine...

My approach would be much the same, except that I\'d likely use Julian
Day #0 (1 Jan 4713 BC old style), since all my date related coding uses
that as a common base.

I think the idea would be really good as a start for an adventure. I\'ve been
a gamemaster for Traveller for over 20 years now. The concept is good and it
sounds like a regular technical mission that a group of scouts could get
assigned or hired to do.
Unless you have really technical minded players, keep the actual physics to
a minimum and focus on the activities involved in getting to the various
areas.
Things to think about:
Wild animals
border guard disputes
technical equipment failures (like grav belts)
:)

That time is halved with a teacher.  I would assume a 4 year degree from the
merchant marine accadamy (or an applied sciences collage or trade school)
with the sudent having a 10 + in many skills and a 12+ in his specialty
followed by a lengthy period as a junior grade in his proffession during
witch he is learning while he works under a \'master\' with a skill in the
neighborhood of 20+  At skill 15 or so he might go out on his own or he may
stay with a good teacher to get real good before he goes out on his own or
takes over from his master.  The newly minted crew man would of course
continue to learn in his proffession over the course of his curreer or he
could become complacent and take a less demanding position like on a tramp
freighter.

As to skill levels, there are \'helper\' your PC can use.  Computer programs
of varios types, detailed schematic, better tools, ect.

If I was running this type of charater I would put in the budget money for a
belt mounted computer with a wireless headset.  It it would have a very
detailed schematic and trouble shooting guide for every piece of equipment I
was responcible for maintaining (a +4 or more bonus), a high grade expert
system (+4 more), top of the line tools (+2 or more), robot assitances (+2
as helpers and good for when multiple easy jobs need doing but check behind
then),  a damned good technical library ( +1 and up), and I would implement
a schedule for increased maintainence to get both familiarity bonuses and a
bonus for have the equipment well maintained.  Even assuming only so of the
above you are looking at a 4+ bonus for a 16+ effective skill.  With good
but not great gear 20+.

Most professionals in highly technical fields do not reach the level of
professional recognition of their competence until they are in their 30s
unless they are wonder kids.  The first thing a new collage graduate learns
when he gets into the real world is just how much more he has to learn.
Your above comments and mine prove the reality of the situation.  A 21 year
old Space tech grad is a danger to himself and those around him.  At 22 he
should be good for basic maintainence if he is still alive.  At 24-26 a
reliable crewman.  At 26-28 a crew leader.  At 30+ assistance chief.  At 35+
chief.  At 40+ a \'breaker in\' for green Space tech kids.  At 50+ master
engineer.

You do not see shipping lines put 20 year olds in charge of Super tankers or
army generals 20 years old.  Some professions need youth, those that require
the physical parameters of youth and most of those are sports related.  In
most professions, experience counts.   Whether that experience comes from
\'book learning\' or on the job training is not all that important, but the
experience itself counts.

Perhaps the ship your character is on is hoping your character will \'grow\'
to be the person they need and can depend on.

Yes I am still around.  I just did not have anything meaningful to add

Also I am in the process of adding a new lady into my life and that is

Just curious, as you mentioned that your text had been published in 1996
and I noticed that mine had the same date on it.  Can\'t be *that* many
worthwhile texts on astrophysics published in the same year. . .

    'index' => 'dc486',
    'month' => '12',
    'body' => 'To all Scouts and World-Builders interested,

In the WorldBuilding thread, someone requested some information
comparing WBH and GS/GC.  In response to that request, I ran a quick
comparison of MT\'s WBH (World Builder\'s Handbook) vs CT\'s GS (Grand
Survey) and GC (Grand Census).  This is what I found out.

Most of the general material is very similar, although WBH changes
some of the wording and formats (sidebars, bulleted lists, outlines.)
 Beyond these general differences, I found the following:

The Donosev Survey Vessel is detailed under High Guard stats in GS 
and MT stats in WBH.  Also, some slight cosmetic differences in 
deckplans exist, but the layout remains the same.

As Extended System Generation is part of the normal MT system
generation procedures, all WBH utilize the Scouts formulas,
presented in a much more structured format using outlines.  GS and
GC offer Basic system generation alternatives.

Under Size-Related Details:

In determining Planet Density, WBH defines Heavy Core as a Core Type, 
achieved on a modified 1- on the Core Type Table.  The relavent 
densities for this type are (3d6):

3   1.10
4   1.15
5   1.20
6   1.25
7   1.30
8   1.35
9   1.40
10  1.45
11  1.50
12  1.55
13  1.60
14  1.70
15  1.80
16  1.90
17  2.00
18  2.25

Rotation Period:  To further define rotation periods expressed as 
days, WBH adds (1d6-3) X 4 hours, while GS adds 1d6 X 4 hours to the 
base rotation.

Seismic Stress Factor:  Heavy Core mods are 1d6-2.

WBH also adds the following under Size-Related Details that is not 
covered by GS:

*Gas giant UWP size generation, with a UWP table for both small (2d6) 
and large (3d6) gas giants.  These UWP size values enable primary 
calculations of mass from the density table, and satellite orbital 
period and rotation, for mainworlds that are satellites of gas giants 
in Habitable Zones.

*Asteroid/Planetoid Belt Profile generation (pg 61, WBH:  includes
Predominate Body Diameter, Max Body Diameter, Predominate Zone Type,
Zone Composition Tables, Belt Orbit Width and Belt Profile Notation)

Under Atmosphere-Related Details:

WBH determines Type F Atmosphere Surface Atm Pressure as a roll under 
the Thin column, minus 0.20 atm.  The referee just chooses one under 
GS.

WBH has a very easily utilized presentation of the Scouts Surface 
Temp calculations, and includes reference tables as needed.

WBH Resource information is slightly changed from GS:

*Heavy Core type has been added to the density sections of the 
Natural Resources and Processed Resources tables. 

*Terrain was removed from the Resource tables under WBH.  Density no 
longer effects Manufactured Resources under WBH.

*Under Natural Resources, Petrochemicals changed to Compounds.

*Under WBH, Processed Resources defines:  Agroproducts, Metals, 
Non-Metals.

*Under WBH, Manufactured Resources defines:  Parts, Durables, 
Consumables, Weapons.

*NEW to WBH:  Information Resources, which defines:  Recordings, 
Artforms, Software, Documents.

*Some DM differences between GS and WBH based on differences in 
Resource types between the two.  All of WBH Resource info is on pg 
71, WBH.

GC includes a means of determining the presence of a minor race on 
worlds with native evolved life.  (3d6: 17+, DM+3 if Pop 6+.  If a 
minor race is present, then it is a minor human race on a second 3d6 
roll of 15+)  WBH does not have a method to determine the presence 
of a minor race.

Under Technology Profile:

The Energy Lower Limit for WBH is High Common TL/2; under GC, it is 
Upper Limit - 5.

The Communication TL Base in WBH is Computer/Robotics TL; under GC, 
it is the lower of Computer/Robotics TL or Energy TL.

The Medical TL Base under WBH is the Computer TL; under GC, it is the 
High Common TL.

The Environmental TL Base for WBH is the High Common TL; while under 
GC, it is the Energy TL.

Under the generation of the Space Transport TL, GC states that if the 
starport type is X, then the TL=Space Transport Lower Limit.  WBH has 
no such indicator.

There were probably more differences, but that\'s all I could find on 
short notice.  I hope this helps out.

Good list, and good explanations.  I think that computer skills need to
be in there someplace at least in the Bridge section, or do Sensor Ops
cover that?  What role does the computer skill play BTW?

As a fan of science, I applaud your sense of detail in the orbital positions
problem, but as a referee, this could have been handled much easier.
Make sure that the players follow your plot line in the game, as you have
detailed it out.
If the SDB needs to catch them in order to make sure they have a few scars
on the old hull, then let it get close enough to do a little damage. If not,
then let the players BARELY escape.
The best times I have ever had as a referee is when my players hit jumpspace
three seconds before a missile with a lock-on strikes them.
Less science and not quite as exacting, but the end result is more cinematic
and intense, which my players always appreciate. After they stop sweating...

No, but if you wrap a ferrous band around them, you could shoot them out of

On looking into my Imp Encylopaedia. I find that, according to it, 4717BC
(Terran dating) is equivalent to 3955PI (Vilani dating), which is when they
(the Vilani) first discovered Jump Drive.

Given that there is some evidence that zero BC, if you wish to take it as
the Birth of Christ -(I\'m not expressing an opinion so let\'s not discuss the
validity of the religion) -is out by some 4 years*, this could shift your
\'Base
Day\' to 4713 BC, and thus it could refer to the VIlani Jump Drive event.

Just a co-incidence, or are you trying to tell us something, Shadow?

;-)

*Note : Having said that I could be out by four years the other way, and
be totally wrong....

The problem is twofold in traveller;

First, any manuverable craft can \'get out of the way\' of any \'ballistic\'
(that is, non-manuvering) object as long as it has time to change velocity
to be one creftlength away from its projected posistion.  A 1g vessel can
move 10 meters in the first second of acceleration from it projected
location, so if the range at which the projectile is fired is less than a
light second (200k km?), and the vessel is larger than 20 meters in all
surface dimensions, a hit is probably likely (Yes, I\'m simplifying).
Increase acceleration, making a hit gets harder.  Decrease surface area,
making a hit gets harder.

Other assumptions; the projectile can be sensed at 1 ls by the target, the
projectile can be accelerated to .9c.

Second, assuming the projectile is the size of a can of, say, chefboyardee
ravioli (beef), any laser can pretty much pick it off.  The projectile is
not manuvering and has a course that is perfectly predictable, and an
aspect which is not changing much.  Tie your point defense laser into a
computer and you can hit the thing, every time.

At that point you can start asking about the fragments of tin can and meat
byproducts which, if they can retain the same vector, can be as damaging as
the whole can.  It is likely, however, that a projectile sufficiently small
that the energy can be generated to accelerate it to near-C can be
generated by another ship, will be vaoprized by the smallest of Traveller
lasers weapons, and the vaporized particles would have many different
vectors and in any case be smaller than one needs to worry about, in
general.

Drop your tech level to where radar is not as good, manuver drive takes
time to fire up, combat happens at 20,000 km, but energy is still cheap and
plentiful and maybe you\'ll get a good railgun-in-space environment.  I
can\'t quite envision that though.

The best kinetic weapon I\'ve seen for Traveller is the BB Missile, which
manuvers until it\'s close to the target then explodes a shaped charge,
scattering 1 gram to 1 kilogram balls in a cloud around the targets
projected position.

This subject has been "done to death" in various forms, but basically this
weapon too will fail if the target can manuver or fire point defense.

Another possible use is as a last ditch anti-boarding weapon.  Assuming
that boarding actions are possible IYTU, once the attacker comes into
*really* short range (like 100km), they are (depending on your assumptions)
probably vulnerable to a rail-gun like weapon, the mass driver.  At that
range and with that weapon, the damage done will not be as serious as with
a near-c can of ravioli, but it is an example of a Kinetic weapon in
starship combat.

  Quite true. (In fact our ship\'s astrogator/economist has Mathematical

Also, in literature and in the real world, legendary-ness has more to do with
events than with skill levels.  Scotty may not be the greatest engineer in
space; he\'s legendary because he\'s the chief engineer on a legendary ship.  He
certainly has an "expert" skill level -- but experts may not be terribly rare.


In my PbeM, we have a pilot with Piloting-13 and another with Piloting-9.  But
the skill-13 is specialized in a different ship type, and so is an effective
skill-11.  Miss Piloting-9 is going to make for some excitement, sooner or
later.

We also have two engineers with various Mechanic skills from 10 to 16.  But
they are computer-aided, which helps.

The gunners have Gunnery-14 and 15.  They\'re fairly hot shots -- but hardly
legendary.

Too bad the ship\'s Cook and Merchant (Broker) is only a hireling.  The crew is
beginning to suspect she\'s about a 25-point character... and they haven\'t
discovered all her disadvantages yet...  heh, heh...


One of the premises of GURPS is that player characters normally start out at
100 points, which makes them "heroic."  My NPCs average 0-25 points, and range
from -50 to 150...  from total losers to moderate badasses.

In SF terms, I would guess the stars of Star Trek are in the 200-point range.
The redshirts might be about 25-50.  Star Wars characters are also "cinematic"
characters in the 200-300 range.  Coming down the scale, I would guess Scully
and Mulder are my idea of 100-point characters: impressive, fairly heroic, but
hardly legendary.  SF starring 25-point characters is usually comedy, or
perhaps cyberpunk.  500 points and you\'re material for Marvel Comix.

And something to remember is that even a negative-point character can make
real trouble.  Ever see "Home Alone?"

I was referring to ways of building characters solely with the GURPS rules.
Yes, you can convert characters, although there are some problems associated
with this. One of the problems is that, using the system given in GT, you
will often wind up with skills that rate out at well BELOW the minimum level
you can buy for 1/2 point, which then (if you desire compliance with the
rules) requires you to raise those skills to the minimum level anyway, thus
making the character "better" than it should be at that skill. If you\'re
going to do that, might as well just build it with GURPS anyway (IMO). But
conversion is an option for those who want a more lengthy character creation
process. Me, I prefer the template system.

Steve Jackson saying that the MegaTraveller task system was one he really
liked and something like that would be something he\'d consider doing for
GURPS 4th, if it ever appears.

I believe that David Summers\' article on GURPS Traveller had some methods of
converting at least TNE task levels to GURPS modifiers; that might be a good
place to start. I believe it is still available in the GURPSNet archives at
www.io.com/GURPSNet/Archives.

As I think about it, it almost seems that GURPS was the last major gaming
system released that didn\'t have some kind of task system. I agree that it
should have one, and a well-designed one would probably make a great Pyramid
article :)

    skills is par for GURPS!"

actually, it is, but most of the time this is not a problem. For one thing,
at 100 points, most GURPS characters will have attributes in the 10-12
range. If you bought 30 skills at 1 point each, you\'re looking at skills of,
say 11 for average skills, 10 for hard skills, 9 for very hard skills. You
would miss your rolls a fair amount of the time even on average tasks, much
more if there are modifiers. Most intelligent people won\'t do that. The
other problem lies with the GURPS default system; most skills default to
attributes or other skills. Buy your attributes up high enough and you
become a real jack of all trades. They did limit that somewhat with a cap on
default rolls, I believe any roll over 14 on a roll that defaults to an
attribute fails (I\'m not sure of that exact number as I don\'t have my book
with me).
    On the average, a GURPS character at 100 points will have between 10 and
30 skills, usually with 1 point or 1/2 point in a lot of them, and the major
ones bought higher. It really depends on the player though. One thing the
template system does is control this and produce very reasonable characters,
which is why I require it\'s use in my GT game.

Eris: since a lot of this might be considered off-topic, I invite you to
feel free to e-mail me with any questions you might have on GURPS Character
Creation, and I\'ll see if I can\'t at least answer your questions.

Well, I\'ll confess, not only do I use that, but somewhere, lost now,
I had compiled every Task ever described in various publications into
a "Task Library", sorted by skill.

I haven\'t been able to find that compilation in some time; if anyone
else has such, please let me know where I can find one...

I do not really consider most of this off topic. I\'ve used GURPS in the

The TAS posts implied that the jump sickness was a result of being exposed to

Assuming that you are referring to the (normally-fatal) effects of
direct exposure to Jump space, it is, as far as I can tell, neither
contagious nor caused by pathogens.  From the TNS (year 1112 Imperial):

"A dispatch from Terra/Sol (0207-A867A69-F) dated 121-1111 reads: \'The
first known victim known to survive direct exposure to hyperspace
arrived at Terra today, suffering from what medical experts are calling
"Hyperspace sickness".\'"

I see nothing in the above entry, nor in subsequent TNS entries, that
would indicate that Jump sickness is caused by any kind of
microorganism.

If you have other references that indicate that Jump sickness is an
infection of some sort, I would be interested in seeing it.

<Snip everything>

Why can you not lead the target?  I mean if it will work with the mk1
eyeball & mgs in WWII, then would it not work with supercomputers & rapid
firing rail guns?

Plus by your own admission, then you might as well not arm your
starships...  As any weapon you put on it, will not be able to hit its
target no matter what you do...  If your target is say 1 ls out (c. 300,000
km) then 3 second delay in targeting...  One second to get there, one
second for the pulse to return, & one second for the beam laser to hit... 
This is not including time to bring the laser on target, etc.  And missiles
now become almost useless, as they would travel much slower than a slug
from a rail gun...  By the time a missle gets close enough to its target,
the target is gone...  So what is the use of weapons systems then?

Could you please be a bit more specific? Where are you getting the
reference to Jump sickness from? It doesn\'t ring any bells on it\'s own,
from Trav canon. IMT star ship crews experience a disorientation effect
from jump that can affect their reaction speeds for a period of time
after leaving Jump, but that\'s my own rule. I really like to know more
about what you are referring to.

Freelance Traveller.

Calendars in Known Space

Of course, the question to ask is "why worry?".  The answer, as
with so many other things, is "it\'s fun, and it adds local
color".  It makes the universe of Traveller feel "more real", and
it makes aliens just a little bit more alien.  But then, when
does a true Traveller fan really need an excuse for something
like this?

Calendars are a major part of our lives, and have been for
millennia.  For the most part, they began with agricultural
societies, and crude observations of stars, seasons, and tides.
From there, they progressed to more refined observations, and
often took on religious significance as well.  Further refinement
and social progress led to use of calendars for advance planning,
and fiscal accounting - but the calendar is always there.

In spite of the large number of cultures that developed
independently on Terra, there has been a remarkable similarity
among the calendars, with the same numbers appearing time and
again.  Many of these numbers are tied to natural rhythms or
other Terran phenomena; others have mystical significance due to
mathematical properties.  But what if you\'re not starting on
Terra?

This article looks at other calendars.  We don\'t try to analyze
the reasons behind them, only to give the rules governing the
count of days in them.  It is up to the referee, or background
author, to develop the history of the calendars and of the
societies.

It is necessary to define some terms that will be used in the
rest of the article, to reduce confusion.  The term \'day\' is
reserved for the standard Imperial day of 24 hours; a local
planetary rotational cycle, regardless of length, will be
referred to as a \'sol\'.  Similarly, the term \'year\' is reserved
for the standard Imperial year of 365 days; a local planetary
revolutional cycle will be referred to as an \'ano\'.

All of the information here is derived from published material
generally held to be canonical, from GDW and DGP, during the
Classic and MegaTraveller eras.

The first calendar we will look at is the Imperial calendar
itself: this calendar is based on a year of 365 days.  Each day
is subdivided into 24 hours, each of which is divided into 60
minutes, and each of those is divided into 60 seconds.  The days
are numbered sequentially from 1 to 365.  There is a semi-formal
subdivision called a \'week\', consisting of seven days; the days
are named \'Oneday\', \'Twoday\', \'Threeday\', \'Fourday\', \'Fiveday\',
\'Sixday\', and \'Sevenday\'; these are normally elided into
\'Wonday\', \'Tuday\', \'Thriday\', \'Forday\', \'Fiday\', \'Sixday\', and
\'Senday\'.  There are exactly 52 \'weeks\' in a year; day 001 is not
part of any week, and is traditionally a holiday, called
"Holiday".  Day 002 of any year always falls on the first Wonday.
Dates are normally written in the form \'001-1105\'; the number
before the hyphen is the day number; the number after is the year
number.  001-0001 is the date of the founding of the Third
Imperium by Cleon Zhunastu.

There has been some confusion about the structure of the Vilani
calendar; two different lengths for both the sol and the ano have
been given by different sources.  When information given about
Vland is checked against the formulæ given in the World Builder\'s
Handbook, it is revealed that the correct information is that a
sol is 32 hours, and an ano is 500 sols.  A sol is divided into
four quarters, or ten tenths; each tenth is further divided into
100 mils.  Traditionally, the Vilani count the dawn-to-dusk
period separate from the dusk-to-dawn period.  Thus, there are
1000 half-sols in a Vilani ano.  The ano is considered to start
at dawn; this is half-sol 001 of the year; at dusk, half-sol 001
ends, and half-sol 002 begins.  Dates are written in the form
\'3882.001\'; the ano number is before the decimal point; the
number of the half-sol is after.  There are two correspondences
given; both cannot be correct.  Either Imperial year -4045 is
Vilani ano 1, or Imperial year 1120 is Vilani ano 3882.  Vilani
ano 1 is the date of founding of the Vilani Grand Empire of the
Stars (Ziru Sirka).  An exact match between specific dates on the
Imperial and Vilani calendars has not been given; for simplicity,
assume that the beginning of the corresponding year (whichever
one is chosen) matches on both calendars.

The Solomani dating system is a close match in terms of sol and
ano lengths to the Imperial and Sylean systems.  The sol is
equivalent to the day, and divided similarly; the ano is
generally 365 sols.  However, the Solomani calendar is still
closely tied to astronomical phenomena on Terra, and, as the
Terran ano is not exactly 365 Terran sols, some adjustment to the
calendar is needed.  There is a complex rule that adds an extra
(intercalary) sol to the calendar in 97 out of every 400 anos.
The ano is divided into 12 \'months\' of varying but roughly equal
lengths; each month has a name and a fixed number of sols. The
month names, in order from the beginning of the year, and the
number of sols in each, are: \'January\' (31), \'February\' (28),
\'March\' (31), \'April\' (30), \'May\' (31), \'June\' (30), \'July\' (31),
\'August\' (31), \'September\' (30), \'October\' (31), \'November\' (30),
\'December\' (31).  The extra sol, when needed, is added to
February.  Sols are counted sequentially from 1 in each month.
There are several common forms for writing dates, some of which
are potentially ambiguous.  The two most common unambiguous forms
are \'January 1, 5641\' and \'1 Jan 5641\'; the year is the last
number, and the month name may be abbreviated to its first three
letters.  1 Jan 0001 is held to be the traditional date for the
religious initiation of a significant religious figure on Terra.
It is generally accepted that Imperial year 1120 corresponds to
Terran/Solomani ano 5641, but, as with the Vilani calendar, no
exact date match is given.

Less is known of the Zhodani calendar than of others.  The
Zhodani sol is 27.02 hours in length, but how it is subdivided is
unknown.  The ano is 244.44 sols in length.  The ano is divided
into six named \'seasons\', each of 40 sols.  Within a season, sols
are both named and numbered, although the names are not generally
used.  There are also four sols that are not part of any season,
and are individually named.  Each group of three anos is called
an \'olympiad\'; the third ano of each olympiad has an intercalary
sol added, and the third ano of each third olympiad has an
additional intercalary sol added.  The translated names of the
seasons and extraseasonal sols, in order from the beginning of
the ano, are Sunbright (sol), Rain, Moon Day (sol), Heat,
Sunflight (sol), Waning, Harvest, Thanksgiving (sol), Chill,
Olympiad Day (intercalary sol), Double Olympiad day (second
intercalary sol), Thaw.  Dates are generally written \'3471.1 Rain
1\'; the number before the point is the olympiad number, the
number following the point is the year number within the
olympiad, the name of the season or extraseasonal sol follows,
then, at the end, the number of the sol within the season
(omitted following an extraseasonal sol).  It is known that
3471.1 Sunbright corresponds to Imperial date 289-1112.  1.1
Sunbright is simply the date that the olympiad system of dating
was instituted.

The Aslan calendar is based on a sol of 36 hours and an ano of
212.2 sols.  The sol is divided into 16 parts, each of which is
further divided into 8 parts, each of which is further divided
into 64 parts, each of which is divided into 8 parts.  The ano
adds an intercalary sol every fifth ano.  Each sol is named, but
for simplicity in dealing with extra-Hierate operations, number
the sols from 1 at the start of each ano.  No standard format for
writing dates is known; it is generally accepted to write the
dates following the Imperial format, but with the letter \'A\' or
the word \'Aslan\' following.  001-0001A is held to be the date on
which the Aslan Council of Twenty-Nine convened for the first
time.  Aslan ano 3644 is held to correspond to Imperial year
1111, but no exact date correspondence is given.

The K\'kree sol is 28.6 hours long, with 368 sols in an ano.  The
sol is divided into four \'watches\' or ten parts, each of which is
further divided into tenths, hundredths, and thousandths.  The
ano is divided into ten parts of 37 sols each; the fourth part
contains only 35 sols.  Part-anos are numbered from 1.  Sols are
numbered within a part starting with 1.  No exact match of
Imperial and K\'kree dates is given; it is generally held that
K\'kree ano 7713 corresponds to Imperial year 1110.  The K\'kree
have not objected to the common Imperial practice of writing the
date as \'7713.5 23\'; the number of the ano is placed before the
point, the specific tenth-part of the ano is placed after, and
then the number of the sol within the part is given.  Note that
as tenth-parts of the ano are numbered from 1, 7713.1 1 is _not_
the same as 7713.10 1.

The Hive Federation calendar is based on a 30 hour sol,
subdivided into 6 intervals.  There are 143 sols in an ano,
numbered from 1.  Dates are written \'1401/001\' with the ano
number before a slash and the sol number after.  0001/001 is the
date of the selection of Glea as the administrative center of the
Hive Federation.  Hiver ano 1401 corresponds to Imperial year
1111, with no exact date match given.

I have a challenging question for anyone who\'s willing to take up the 
gauntlet.  This question centers around the expansion of Terrans 
prior to the 1st IW, and requires extensive knowledge of the 
capacities of both the Terrans and Vilani during this time period.  
(Heck, I\'d even welcome some wild-haired guesses, so long as they\'re 
backed by some logical thought and support.)  If you feel up to the 
challenge, here goes:

What worlds within the Solomani Rim were surveyed by the Terrans 
between 2096AD and 2110AD, before the 1st IW broke out?  Which worlds
did they colonize?

Mick Bailey\'s Unbroken Pride article indicates that the 1st IW was 
primarily fought over Fenris and Barnard.  That same article 
indicates that the worlds of neighboring Dingir subsector were the 
battlefields for the 2nd through the 7th IW, while Arcturus wasn\'t 
settled until well into the Rule of Man.  From the sounds of it, 
Terrans stayed within their subsector and pushed somewhat spinward, 
before kicking Vilani bu...uh, er, uh, resoundly defeating the Vilani 
coreward and pushing into Ziru Sirka territory.

I assume that the Unbroken Pride information is based off of the old 
Solomani Rim supplement.  Does anyone have any other information to 
offer?

For a bonus question, what worlds did the Vilani explore/colonize
during this time period as well?  (Please restrict all references to
within the Solomani Rim sector.)

Thanks in advance for whatever assistance can be extended.  I and my 
gamers appreciate it.

In Gratitude,
Jason,  who keeps wondering why he ofttimes mistypes "Vilani" as 
"Villain".

You can. You just won\'t hit much. Look at it from a gameplay
standpoint for a second, as well. You fire a railgun with a muzzle
velocity of 32km/s. In most iterations of traveller starship combat
it will take a few turns for your shot to get to the target hex.
Then you need to figure out how you spread the shots out to cover a
large area. So each shot will need a counter that moves slowly by
ship standards. Once it gets to the target hex, you roll so to-hit
roll that is very easy unless the target is using drives at all,
then it is very hard (unless your gun spits millions of rounds
you\'ll need to bracket the possible positions the target could be in
in the sensor lag (1s) plus the flight time----say 2.5hours, that\'s
9001seconds to ensure a hit). it\'s possible, just not all that
playable.

Only the return and laser pulse matter in that calculation, so the
delay is 2s, not 3. The rationale is that (for evading targets) you
shoot *many* shots into the possible volume the target could be in
after 2s of maneuver, and only a few actually hit (if any). If the
target is not accelerating, it will get hit easily, even with a rain
gun.

Huh? Missiles are guided towards the general area of the target
(easy to do), then once they are close enough to actually attack,
the lag is pretty small. And a 12g12 missile caould be going very
much faster than most railguns (I missed the ravioli stuff, what was
the quoted velocity? More than 200km/s (12gs worth of burn)?

	It didn\'t always work with the mk1 eyeball and MGs in WWII, that\'s
why it was so hard to shoot down planes, even kamikazes. And leading
the target assumes the target will continue on the same course and
speed.

	Not true. The further out it gets, the more lightspeed lag works in
favor of the defender. Closer in, you just physically cannot move out
of the way of a laser beam. Missiles, although they can maneuver, are
much easier to dodge, and become almost trivially simple to shoot
down with lightspeed weapons when they get close. Railgun projectiles
are essentially ballistic, and only a blind man or a crippled ship
couldn\'t avoid one.

>km) then 3 second delay in targeting...  One second to get there,
one
>second for the pulse to return, & one second for the beam laser to
hit... 

	There\'s some fairly detailed statistics on my site. First, it\'s not
three seconds, it\'s two. You don\'t care about how long it took the
radar pulse to get to the target, only how long it takes the pulse to
return to you and your laser beam to return. Justification: The pulse
is carrying the target location *at the time it left the target*.
Note this also applies to passive sensors--the signal you receive
carries information as of the time it left the target.

	Case 1 (Best Case): The ship is ballistic (does not maneuver). You
can simply project exactly where the ship is going to be when your
shot hits, within limits based on sensor accuracy, etc. Bullseye out
as far as you can see.

	Case 2 (Worst Case): The target initiates a maximum G maneuver, at
right angles to the line of sight, an infinitesimal moment AFTER the
sensor signal you\'ll fire on leaves the target. This provides the
target the maximum time to move itself AWAY from its "ballistic"
point. If you still aim at the "ballistic" point, the target MUST
move itself at least half a ship\'s length away from that point or
it\'ll still get hit. A slightly better strategy for the attacker
assumes you\'ve been observing the target (or in combat long enough)
to know what its maximum acceleration is. You can then draw a
projected circle around the ballistic point and know the target MUST
be somewhere in that circle. It\'s not possible for it to get any
further*. You then randomly fire shots within that circle. Your
chances of hitting range from 94% for a 1G target at 30,000km, 73%
for a 6G target at 30,000km, to 7% for a 1G target at 300,000km and
0% for a 6G target at that range. This assumes the target is a 100Td
sphere. *Unless you\'re wrong about the maximum acceleration ... but
there is STILL an upper limit, and being wrong about it only hurts
the attacker once--as soon as the target displays greater
acceleration, you know...

	Note this "worst case" also is not representative of most cases.

	(a) The target cannot instantaneously change its direction of
thrust; it takes time to slew around. This reduces the possible area
in which it can be found

	(b) With good sensors, you should be able to resolve the target.
This\'ll tell you many things.
		1. You\'ll have a good idea what kind of ship it is, and hence what
its maximum slew rate and acceleration are.
		2. You\'ll know which way it was pointing. Now you know exactly how
far he can slew and accelerate. You\'ve just cut down the target
circle considerably.
		3. You may or may not be able to get an approximation of how much
power his plants are producing, based on radiator output. This\'ll
help again with the max accel guess.

	(c) The target may not know exactly where you are. Kind of hard to
lay in a right-angle course if you don\'t know right angle from what.

	(d) If there are more than two attackers, with some separation,
it\'ll be impossible to lay in a right angle course to all of them.

	Other considerations apply as well, but I haven\'t thought of all of
them.

, (b) may not know exactly where the threat is to choose a right
angle thrust, and (c) CANNOT move at right angles to the line of
sight from TWO attackers. One will get a better shot.

	With decent sensors, a

type (and still be able to interact with the rest of the world) you either 
needed to be a 300 pt character or have all kinds of IQ enhancing 
advantages.  And as we are all Engineers or Programmers, we 
could come up with some really esoteric fields that a character had 
to specialize in. :)

Although GURPS can be very realistic when it comes to engineering 
and tech skills (they can be broke down 500 different ways) it didn\'t 
make sense for playability.  If you have any doubts, look up Math on 
Amazon.com and then then look up Engineering.  There are by far 
MANY more Math related fields than there are engineering.  And 
Math is only one skill in GURPS.

So we changed the rules...

(The HR stands for Home Rule).

HR Engineering/Tp/TL

This is the ability to design and build complex machinery.  Time 
required for each attempt is up to the GM.  See the Technician for 
the repair skill.

Electrical - M/VH
Mechanical - M/VH
Civil - M/VH
Chemical - M/VH
BioMedical - M/VH
Nuclear - M/VH

HR Technician/Tp/TL

This is the repair component of the Home Rule Technical Skill Set.  
See the engineering skill for design information.

Electronics - MH
Mechanics - MH
Photonics - MH
Construction - MH
Armory - MH
Starshipbuilding - MH


HR Operations/Tp/TL

This skill allows use of all gear within a known specialty. For normal, 
everyday use of equipment, no skill roll is required. Rolls should be 
required in emergency situations, or for "abnormal" use of 
equipment, or for use of complex gear by the unskilled.  

Examples: Someone is jamming your radio transmission. Roll a 
Contest of Skills in Operation (Communications) - (radio vs. jammer) 
- - to see whether or not you can get a clear signal out.

You\'re trying to pick up a speedy target on radar. Make your 
Operation (Sensors) roll. The GM might also assess (for instance) a 
penalty due to the target\'s ECM gear.

A specialty must be chosen. 

Computers - MH
Sensors/EW - MH
Drives - MH
Comms - MH
Security - MH
Medical - MH

By increasing the cost of the skill, the skill level goes down but the 
character can manipulate a broader range of equipment.  There are 
also some defaults and prereqs that we have come up with that 
have been play-tested and they seem work.  And now I (the GM) 
don\'t have to come up with a different skill category everytime the 
player wants to do something a little different.

Example - to build an escalator, the character would need:
Engineer/Mechanical and Engineer/Electrical to design it.
Technician/Mechanical and Technician/Electronics to build it.
Two success rolls: the average of his two Engineering skills and the 
average of his two Technician skills.  Or he could use the defaults 
off his Engineering skills to build it.  Entirely up to the player.

I guess in a nutshell, this much simplified system substantially 
reduces the number a skills a Techie Character needs to do his job 
and still lets him do some things that outside his chosen specialty 
(like wear a Vacc Suit).

Which has the amusing effect of making the two calendars out of sync:

that the year 0 Imperial corresponds to AD 4518 instead of AD 4521, which

That is mostly where "it depends" comes in.  In a very cinematic
campaign a skill level of 22 would let you respond to the GM
telling you that it is dark (say a -2 to hit), you are hurt
(say a -4 to hit), and your foe has cover (enough to get a -4
to hit), with "I shoot the bastard!".

Or if you are trying to land a ship in middle of rubble and
the GM tells you "that\'s a -4 to land", you feel a lot better
if you have Piloting at an 18.

This would work (I don\'t know where you came up with the
%ages for "2d6").  The one in the book works too.  There
is a bit of judgement here....

I actually used Engineering in my GURPS Traveller
(before the book came out) at least partially because I had the
feeling that the Engineers I saw portrayed could build what they
were working on (though I guess that designing would be another
matter) and I wanted it to be something that you had to put
an effort into being good at (Engineering is Mental Hard).
I had those three specializations and a general "space ship"
one for all the other misc things you might fix on a ship.

However, as you point out, mechanic makes sense.  I don\'t know
why they started using "Engineer (Vehicles)" in the templates.
It may have been an attempt to sweep up all the other things
you mights need to fix (though I don\'t know why they didn\'t
make it "Mechanic").  Sean Punch (Dr. Kromm) wrote them
so maybe you could ask him on the GURPS mailing list.

Once you get into sensors, gravitics, life support etc. the
list can get sort of long.  You can either let the ships engineer
fix misc things on his ship that need fixing (with the three
specialties or with Engineer (Vehichles) (maybe it is
an Engineering skill because it covers a lot of things
that would be in another specialization).  The idea is
that you can learn to fix the artificial grav plates
without knowing how to fix everything on a grav vehcile.
Or you can simply have the Player rely on the fact that
the Mechanic and Electronics skills default to each other
(I pretty sure they do, I don\'t have GURPS in front of
me).  You can then use them to fix anything at a -4 of
of your best one.

You would normally just use Merchant.  If you think the makes
Merchant too broad, you can require specializations or just
make new skills.  Now, since Broker is a prominent skill in
Traveller, GT made it a seperate skill from Merchant (I don\'t
remember a Trader skill).

You\'ve just provided a textbook example of the difference between the 
Dramatist (you) and Simulationist (Derrick) styles of gaming.  The third
recognized style, the Gamist, would make the decision based on whether
the PCs had faced a challenge lately.

One possible motivation for Derrick wanting to dice it all out is that,
whatever happened, his players might see it as more "fair" and not the
result of arbitrary decision(s) by the GM/storyteller.

For more information on this model of gaming styles, see the newsgroup
rec.gaming.advocacy.

They are handy until you have a feel for what a modifiers you
want in a different situation.  Then it doesn\'t make so
much difference.

I just wing postivie modifiers (my players never complain about
getting a +2 :-) so I didn\'t formalize it.  (Note: in GURPS
"routine" has normally been used to describe things that you
don\'t need to roll for, though that is not a formal defination).

I\'ve seen 3 point ones to (I even made up some).  This is what
I like to use.  To me "Almost Impossible" is nearly the same
as saying "you need a critical to succeed" so I make that a
- -10.  Then 2 points steps filled in better.

This is a bit more generous than I would go with.  Someone
with a skill of 16 (very good, but not outlandish) would
suceed at a "Hopeless" task 25% of the time.  To low for
me.  Though in a more cinematic campaign (where protagonists
are suppose to do "impossible" things all the time) it might
be fine.  [A lot of this is a GM getting things tuned for
his style of play.]

Well, for me it depends on what you mean by (for example)
"Staggering".  I guess this works beter for my approach
since if something was "hopless" it means to me that even
a crit may not do it.  Something that is "Staggering" says
to me that you do need a crit.  (which, again, I call a -10
since the baseline is that if you make a roll by 10 you may
have critted).

In my conversion article I was even tougher :-)
Easy         +2
Routine       0
Difficult    -4
Formidible   -8
Impossible  -12

>...this looks *too* hard, but maybe not, if GURPS characters are

Also remember, it depends on how the words are applied.  If
a GM thinks that everything that is harder than normal
is "Staggering" things will be a lot different than if
he apply the "Difficult" modifier all the time.

I suppose one could try and get more objective an try
and compare the task labels for various specific exmamples
in MT to the modifiers in GURPS Basic.  I don\'t know if
that would get you anywhere.

He does have a lot of skills.  (Because of the Jack of all

of everything).

Right.  He can do a lot of things but his weakness is he can\'t
do them very well.  Whenever something needed doing, my character
was alway offering that he could do it (notice the Overconfidence).
The other PCs didn\'t generaly take him up on the offer (esp
when it came to flying their starships, etc.)  I\'m not sure why
(since he had actually always done OK in the thing they had let
him done.  Maybe they were psychic sensing that he wasn\'t as
good as he thought he was :-

training are to provide a reasonable set of rules for letting
the players use time to train their charcters, but extending
them to these sorts of exercises is pushing that too far.

        In a combat zone, you are more liable to have someone put a

One additional factor is that most warships have multiple weapons per
battery (at least of the light stuff), which enables you to program your
shots with a spread per battery.  Out of ten triple laser turrets in a
common HG battery, you can significantly increase the "basket" of
probability for hitting your target with at least a couple of shots.

I think that the astrogator probably needs the scientific skill Computer
Programming/TL.  (The ChEng might need it, too.)  Computer Operation/TL is
a professional skill which "is the ability to operate a computer, call up
data, run existing programs, play video games, et cetera."  Sounds to me
like something which would be required for *everyone* in a starship\'s crew!

Incidentally, GURPS Compendium I lists the professional skill Sailor/TL
(Mental/Average, defaults to IQ-5):

       Professional sailors require a body of additional knowledge
    beyond that required to steer the vessel.  This normally covers
    the basics of map reading and navigation, practical meteorology,
    nautical laws and regulations, and so on.

I would say a similar skill, Spacehand, should be required for all members
of a ship\'s crew.  This would include things such as basic damage control,
operation of ship\'s systems (IC, the galley, &c - and could include
Computer Op), the basics of interstellar law as applicable to the type of
ship (military, merchant, free trader), &c.  (What odds that on military
starships, at least, crew members will be required to go through a
qualification programme similar to that which earns a submariner his
dolphins?)

And don\'t forget that Gunnery skill just gives the ability to operate the
weapon - maintenance and repairs will require Armoury (specialisation)
and/or Mechanic (specialisation).  Why "and/or Mechanic"?  Say number one
fusion turret is OOC.  Is it the weapon that failed?  Call an armourer.  Or
is it a problem with the turret\'s drive mechanism?  Call a mechanic.  I\'d
say that each of the different starship weapons would be a different
specialisation, both for gunners and for armourers, but Mechanic/TL
(Starship Turrets) should cover everything not related to the weapon itself.

According to the board game _Imperium_ (semi-canon, at any rate), the
Terran setup for the first campaign places World markers at Sol
(obviously), and Alpha Centauri A and B.  Outpost markers are placed at
Junction, Barnard\'s Star, and Proxima Centauri.

The Alpha Centuari system, from looking at a CT map of the Sol
subsector, seems to become Prometheus system.  I can\'t figure out where
Proxima Centauri ends up....  <shrug>

Again, according to _Imperium_, the Vilani have World markers at Dingir,
Gashidda (listed as the provincial capital), Ishkur, and tree other
primanry systems (possibilities are:  Lagash, Amarku, Nusku, Tau Ceti,
Epsilon Eridani, and Mirabilis), plus 7 Outpost markers, placed at
systems to connect (by Jump 1 or 2) all worlds.  In _Solomani Rim_
terms, Lagash and Amarku are two worlds in the binary Lagash system, Tau
Ceti appears to become Iilike, and Epsilon Eridani apprears to become
Shulimik.  Other Vilani settlements are not addressed.

Well, according to the label on my handy can of Chef Boyardee Mini
Ravioli [CBMR] (best suited for rapid-fire ravioli Gatling guns), CBMR
has both beef and cheese, thus making it non-kosher as well.

to degenerate.)

3.  How many weeks/months are in a turn in _Imperium_?

Holloway how old he is, and he gives an answer and adds he hasn\'t a
clue how much to allow for hyperspace differential), and it\'s
explicitly mentioned in one of the other books (Space Viking?). And
there may be other mentions.

  I recall hearing about the Argentine soldiers and the sheep (get your
mind out of the gutter! - they\'re not Scots, after all); at first they
would walk up, give them a hug, and take them home for dinner. As time
went by the remaining sheep got warier and they had to be recruited by
fire from progressively longer ranged firearms...

Nope, the figure given in Space Vikings was a Ly an Hour, time ran thesame
for both. In empire he mentions faster drives.

Yeah! Loved it! As a matter of fact, this past weekend I picked
up the 3rd(?) generation of the game written for a 486/50. Per
the box, it\'s greatly expanded and is almost a low-end version
of the Privateer/Wing Commander games. Unfortunately, it\'s
written strictly for DOS and I can\'t get it to boot under any
version of Win9x. :-( :-(  Oh, well, $6.00 down the drain.

Has anyone, by chance, played Privateer/Privateer II?
*Lots* of ideas/screen shots for Traveller!

I think Dom was thinking of Black Arrow, the UK\'s satellite launch
system that got through testing only to be cut :<

Blue Steel (and the whole V-Bomber force) was a strategic instrument,
since it was targeted at the (then) Soviet homeland; not at troop
formations in Germany. For those, we had the Lance missile (albeit under
US control).

>Which reminds me, anyone know if elements of SAC are still "out there"

No. SAC has been disbanded, with its forces rolled into Air Combat
Command. The standing airborne alert is also stood down. however, if the
worse should happen, the US has a Strategic Command structure that can
claim nuclear-capable forces from the pool.

The Pak would win the same way they won on Wonderland.  After infecting all
the high population worlds with tree of life virus the new Pak fleets would
simply overwhelm what\'s left of the Imperium.  Remember Brennan took over a
multimillion person colony by himself.
