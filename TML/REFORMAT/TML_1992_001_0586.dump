Rob Dean commented that Challenge was slowly running less and less
useful MegaTraveller articles and that his interest in it was
dropping.

I can tell you why it\'s running less articles.
They aren\'t getting any.
I would heartily encourage _everyone_ here to write up their favorite
whatever for MT and send it to Michelle Sturgeon at GDW.

	First a real-world example. My wife and I are both in the SCA
(Society for Creative Anachronism, medieval recreation). We both fight.
I.e. we wear suits of armour and hit each other with sticks. I am 5\'10",
she is 5\'4". I weigh #140, she weighs #xxx (acutal number ommited for
diplomacy, consider it to be considerably more than me :-). I.e. I am
"tall" and "thin" and she is "short" and "not-thin". However, we can
both fight effectively wearing each other\'s armour. Actually there are
suits of armour we have that people even taller than me (and shorter
than Lesley) can fight competantly in.
	My personal body armour was made by and for someone of Lesley\'s
proportion (and gender) and her\'s was made by and for someone of her height
and my build. I fought in Canada in armour for someone basically the same
height & weight but the other gender.
	So what I am saying is that, with regard to Medieval plate armour,
we have quite a degree of flexibility. Now custom shaped armour is always
better (I can\'t wear the new legs I\'ve made for Lesley) but will not
greatly inhibit use. If you carry this over to Battle Dress and Traveller
game mechanics the worse I would apply is to increase any task by one
level.

	The second is a literary example. C.J.Cherry\'s "Rimrunners"
goes into some detail on Battle Dress. Since I beleive Traveller has been
a major influence on her works they bear particular relevance. Much of
the tension toward the end of the book is derived through the repair
and fitting of two damaged suits of Battle Dress by a technician/marine.
	It is quite clear in this that because Battle Dress acts as an
amplifier of your actions it must be fitted *precisely*. To do otherwise
sends the user jittering and shaking around the room.
	I reccomend the book to anyone interested in Battle Dress or for
thematic background for Traveller.

	There you go. Two opposite examples :-). Take you pick.

While trying to work up my fleet for the TCS PBEM game, I tried to
game out some ship designs with High Guard.  I quickly came to the
conclusion that the system is a nightmare for "real" situations with
large numbers of opposing ships, fighters, etc.  I can easily imagine
a fight in the PBEM game with a thousand or so ships on a side.

Consequently, I think I\'m gonna look into writing a High Guard combat
moderator.  It should read regular HG listings for ship stats (I\'ll
have to put in some extras for aux. bridge, backup computers and
such) and keep track of individual ships.

Any suggestions or features?  How about what machines/environments to
run it on?  Lowest common system is probably Unix text, with Unix
curses running second ...

We\'ve had two newcomers ask about the wisdom of investing in MegaTraveller

we might want to put together two lists: One of MT product reviews, and one
of classic Traveller products that should be sought by new MT players.

The second category would certainly include things like Book 8: Robots, whose
rules have not yet been translated to MT (and probably will _never_ be),
The Traveller Adventure, and most of the Alien books.  What else would anyone

Alas, neither of those will do me any good. I\'ve had *very* mixed
results when trying to move unix source to the PC. (mostly because I am
*not* a C programmer, Pascal I could handle).

So I vote for PC compatible, with a "stock" ANSI driver loaded.

I used to send something once in a while, but haven\'t in a long
time.  The main reason being that, frankly, I don\'t own very
much Traveller stuff -- just the OT boxed set (which is why I\'m
not currently trying to get into the PBEM :-) -- and while this
is fun on its own, I was just thinking about buying heavily
into MT stuff to "get current" and doing some things with it
when GDW managed to convince me the game\'s a dead end -- no
future.  No reflection on the typical reader of this group, who
seems to be able to support the game well with little or no
help!  The main reasons I still watch the list are for (1) the
fun physics, and (2) to watch the PBEM(s) (BTW, to the writers
who collate(d) that stuff -- *great job*!  I can imagine how
much work it must be...).  Let me know when some commercial
organization (not necessarily GDW) decides to support something
vaguely resembling OT or MT again, and my interest\'ll perk
right up...

Maybe we should buy the licenses and do it ourselves?  Anybody
interested in working on TDR (under some other name, obviously
:-) on a percentage basis?  The SPARC on my desk here at home
would make a fine desktop publishing station with just a little
work, and --

  All tranq rounds have penetration 1, attenuation 1, damage 1 and max range
Medium. I\'ve already talked about \'cocktail\' and \'broad spectrum\' tranq so I
won\'t repeat that again.

  The damage inflicted when they hit are real physical damage (beware of
exceptional successes!), but in addition to this they give a certain fixed
number of extra chemical hits, one at the time. The exact number depends on
the strength of the tranq you are using. Most non-dose-control give 2 to 4
extra depending on the the type of weapon they are used for: Automatic weapons
use strength 2 tranq and single shot weapons give strength 4 tranq.
  If the total damage level (physical and chemical) reduces the character to
unconciousness he is unconcious. If it takes all his hits, he\'s dead.
  All chemical hits will wear off one per hour, or all at once if the victim
is injected with a antidote (in autoinjector form).

  Dose control on the other hand are typically high strength (8 or so) but
the chemical hits will stop to accumulate once the character is unconcious.
It is still possible to die from the physical damage resulting from multiple
tranq hits however.

The Alien Modules.
Now that DPG has left the new alien modules for good, the old ones are sorely
needed.  Probably the best of the missing ones is the Zhodani.  After that
Droyne and maybe Darrians.  DPG has covered the Vargr, Aslan, and Solomani of
the old series.  (Though I prefer the advanced character generations of the
old editions)  After that, K\'kree and Hiver.  These last two are interesting
but not very useable.  I have never even heard of anyone using either 2 of the
modules except to provide a Hiver NPC.  IMHO, the two races are unplayable as
characters.

Book 8: Robots and 101 Robots.
You want robots?  This is the only place you can get them.  101 robots is less
crucial than Book 8, but the added design rules in there are helpful.
These two rank far above K\'kree and Hiver.

With these and the MegaTrav stuff, I\'d say you can get by pretty well.  Every
thing else is nice to have, but little of it is crucial.

*I* like Supp 9 fighting ships and Stiker, but that\'s because I\'m a confirmed
VDN (Vehicle Design Nut).  But Fighting ships is not in MegaTrav format.  And
Stiker has very little in it that MegaTrav doesn\'t.

I *LIKE* the old Traveller Adventure.  That is probably one of the best
adventures they put out.  I wouldn\'t say it is a "Must have" but it certainly
is a "Damn! This is GOOD!"

I would say that just about everything in classic trav helps a bit.  But I
don\'t think that it is *necessary* to have them.

What do you guys think?

I went and saw The Lawnmower Man the other day and it caused me to
stop and think about the holodisplays in Traveller.

How much of a virtual reality system is a holodisplay? I know it is
customizable but that refers to  personal preferences in regards to
layout if I\'m not mistaken.

Is there a capability as in Star Trek TNG for holodecks? Whole rooms
used as virtual reality systems.

When Traveller was created there wasn\'t much talk about virtual
reality systems but now it\'s quite the topic. Even the military is
getting involved in it. I remember coming across something where the
Army has recreated a battle from the Desert Strom action. Using a
warehouse like a holodeck where every detail is taken into account.

How does this fit into Traveller? Any Comments?

My article on tranq rounds for MT never made it to print before MTJ went
belly-up.... in fact, I\'ll bet that Issue 3 never DOES come out, primarily
because it is supposed to have the one article I DID get to them in it. |-P

However, the ideas begun in crude form in my article in JTAS and carried over
(poorly and sloppily) into MT are worth elaborating upon, and I think I\'ll
write an article for CHALLENGE when my thesis defense is past. Until then....

This is probably an okay oversimplification. One thing I have a lot of trouble
with, though, is the idea of broad spectrum tranq. I have run, and hence the
PBEM runs, with the rule that one species\' tranq is another species\' poison.
A tranq made for a Vilani will work on all other humans without trouble, and
will knock out Vargr as well, but it will have no effect at all on a K\'Kree,
kill a Hiver or Droyne dead in its tracks, and drive an Aslan psychotic.

This causes players to be a bit careful whom they shoot. |-\\

This sort of ruling is a necessary evil. That\'s why I invented dose-controlled
tranq (or MCA, metabolically controlled anaesthetic, as my original article
called it) in the first place. There are alternatives, in some cases, to the
amount of physical damage done. See below.

By the time you\'re high-tech enough to have MCA, you\'re high-tech
enough to avoid this sort of thing in most cases. Instead of requiring
intramuscular injection, just mix the tranq with DMSO or something
like it and suffuse it into the bloodstream through the skin. Thus,
*I* have written up items like snub pistol or gauss weapon tranq
rounds as being capsules of this liquid, which spatters into a fine
mist on impact. If a drop gets on exposed skin, you\'re out cold.  Even
better, but requiring a larger round like a shotgun shell or a
grenade, is tranq-gas, a fine suspension that liberally coats a danger
space of a hex or two and can work its way into any clothing that\'s
not air- and watertight. (Footnote: is there any interest in a standard
for grenades that are smaller than the 40mm RAM? Like a 10mm or 20mm?)

For armor, the only alternatives are non-mushrooming DS rounds with a tranq/
DMSO load in them. They get through armor, leave as small a hole as possible,
and ablate anaesthetic as they go through. I think that it would be difficult
to design a round that could get through armor yet be stopped by skin with
only a welt, and as noted above, if a person\'s not in airtight armor like a
combat environment suit, combat armor, or battle dress, then regular mist
rounds can do the job.

Two Challenge articles/adventures might be helpful.

Just Like Magic, in C# 46, and the BEHIND BLUE EYES adventure that was
spread over C# 48-51/2?  Special combat and armor rules were in C#49 (WHEN
IT\'S LANCES NOT LASERS).  It\'s my understanding that these various articles

              EMLevel=Faint . Has Intake Compressor . Max Alt 1000 Feet .

              This vehicle is basically an ultralight of the 1990\'s but has
              no wings . It seats 1 person in a cramped seat at the front
              of the craft . It is really just a steel frame with engine and
              seat mountings . It has a 200 liter cargo \'bin\' just behind the
              operators seat . There is a small 20 liter \'glove compartment\'
              just under the operators seat . The cargo bin could be removed
              and two people stand in its place (very preceiously in
              emergencies) with no subtraction to speed and the like . The craft
              has a very long duration in relation to other vehicles . A saftey
              attachment has been made in the area of a small emergency power
              supply should the engine for some reason give out . The batteries
              have enough power to supply the craft for 5 minutes (enough time
              for the pilot to land the craft safely) . It is unenclosed .

              This vehicle can be found on Tarsus . The population there make
              great use of grav vehicles despite their relitvily low tech (10) .
              It is a small \'spotter\' craft which is used in the business of
              farming Noble herds (Rhinocerous type herbivores that run around
              at 50 kph) . The craft \'buzzes\' the herd into moving in certain
              directions . So in away it is roughly the equivilent of a motor-
              bike used for cattle mustering today . The craft looks like a
              terran ultralight of the 1990s save it is a bit bigger and has
              no wings .

              Editors Note : The emergency Supply of batteries has the cost at
              100 times cheaper than the listed book price . However it runs
              at the same output listed in the book . My other designs which
              are tech 9 + and have batteries usually are 10 times the listed
              book price, but due to a suggestion from Scott Kellogg (in this
              design anyway) it is not .  The Maximum Altitude is taken from
              the referees companion on the description of tech 10 grav vehicles
              (ie the max altitude is about a thousand feet) . This is not
              from sea level, but from the ground it is flying above . The
              intake compressors enable it to fly in mountainous areas and
              planets with thin atmosphere . It cannot be used in vaccum unless
              a tank of oxygen is added . It is concevible that someone could
              mount rockets or other weaponary on the craft but thats up to the
              GM I guess .

Changing Professions

If a character wishes to change professions, he must make an enlistment
roll for that new profession . The following DM\'s are applied . - 1 for
each term before attempting enlistment . - 2 if previous occupation
\'unrelated\' . Brownie Points from the old profession are allowed to be used
on the enlistment procedure, but never again after that (ie once enlists
loose all brownie points) .

Ranks . If previous profession was related, then the rank is Traveller rank
minus two . If caused to go \'below\' rank 1, assume at rank 1 . If previous
profession unrealated then start at the bottom .

Mustering out : The three cash rolls max applied to  total amount of rolls.
Roll for mustering out benefits \'after\' character generation .

Use the above system wisely . For example no characters having escaped from
jail attempting to enlist in the navy .

Related professions would be like a naval character going to the merchant
service, or an army character enlisting in the marines . Any \'Space\' character
going to another\'Space\' profession could be considered related . Also with
the discharge table, a dishonourably discharged character could attempt
to enlist in a criminal profession and count it as \'related\' . Unrelated
professions are like \'Bureacrat to Pirate\' and so forth . Note alot of retired
military personal enter the private sector after service into companies
and the like . So GM\'s might consider extra bonuses for that (for example) .

Many people get anoyed when generating a character only to have him \'die\'
half way through . In cases in my campaign when this happens I do the following
. If the character \'dies\' in the first assignment of the term, round his
career up half a term (say he spent it in hospital) . If dies in 2nd year
dont adjust it . If in third, round it up to a full term (once again say he
spent it in hosptial) if in the fourth leave it where it is . For those
characters who spent that \'extra\' year in hospital optionly allow them to
roll over 7, and get a \'skill\' roll on their \'Life\' Table in their porfession .

Now the medically discharged character wishes to enlist in another service .
This is fine and dont count the term the character was \'wounded\' in as
a DM on enlistment . The reason the character \'adjusted\' his career up above
if for ease in bookkeeping .

Eg Tim the scout has served two terms, but in the first year of term three
fails his survival roll . He spends a year in hospital then attempt to
enlist in the merchant service . The DM\'s are - 2 (Terms) . The profession
of scout and merchant are related enough to ignore the other DM .

It was the intention of the original system to limit densitometers to
scanning an area of 1% of the distance to the area at one time, with a
maximum resolution of 1% of the scan width.  Or, to put it directly in
the terms we are interested in the smallest object that can be discerned
is .0001 times the distance away.  Thus, at 500,000km, no object smaller
than 50km across can be resolved.  In an example from the PBEM game, a
missile turret, perhaps 1m across, could not be resolved from the
background at a distance of more than 10,000m (10km).  The penetration
depth number that has been carried on through the MegaTraveller referee\'s
Manual (e.g. 1km at TL15) is independent of this other limitation, so that
at TL15 you could get a 3D picture of an object to a depth of 1km with
a resolution limited by the range as described above.  To make out a
10m object underground (such as a grav tank bay, for example, drawing on
last summer\'s planetary invasion thread) at a depth of 1km, you would have
to be within 100km of the object.  Thus, you couldn\'t really look \'through\'
a whole planet even without the depth restriction.

Thought I\'d mention this, since getting a copy of TD #3 is probably a little
difficult...

Marjoram class 400 ton Merchant TL12

     The Marjoram class merchant is a standard Imperial Data Package design,
which has been slightly modified by the inclusion of an upgraded weapon and
sensor suite to reflect the current unsettled conditions in Imperial space.
This version of the Marjoram includes two double beam laser turrets, a triple
missile turret and a triple sandcaster turret for self-defense.  Fuel scoops
are carried for emergency use, but the usual operating practice would be to
purchase unrefined fuel immediately upon landing at a starport, and process
it while cargo loading and unloading is going on. With a jump-3 drive and 2.2
maneuver Gs, the Marjoram can provide ground-to-ground service between most
Imperial starports.  Common variations on the design include removing state-
rooms in favor of additional cargo space, and adding a berth for some sort of
subsidiary craft.  In addition, it is not uncommon for crewmembers to double
up on duties or to run slightly shorthanded, which allows additional state-
rooms for passengers.

IDP-12116 class Utility Landing Craft TL12

     The IDP-12116 class utility landing craft is intended as a multi-purpose
small craft suitable for use by merchant vessels desiring an independent
landing capability.  Passengers and cargo can be shuttled from a starport or
spaceport other than the one being used by the main vessel. The design is

I like it.  We have been allowing pretty much unlimited switching of
professions, but your system is rather better and more consistent
with reality ( both as we know it, and as GDW/DGP know it ).

Hmmm... That will change a lot of planetary assault scenarios for sure.
It disagrees with some of the Referee\'s Manual, though.  The "Passive
Object Pinpoint" is supposed to be done entirely with a densitometer, and
under the above guidelines, a densitometer is pretty much useless for
detecting a ship much beyond 1000Km.  Even so, it makes a lot of the
picture
fit better than before, so I think we will have to use that particular gem
from DGP.

Anything else good in TD\'s three and four?

2) When rolling for primary star, if the plaent has a pop of 8, and

have a breathable atmos of -200 degrees . This is stupid, how do I change it ?

3) When placing the companion star, what does the book mean . EG I rolled a

star is in orbit 10???????? . The book then said Star A will have orbits 0-4,
Star B + orbit 12+, Star B orbits 0-5 . Does this mean orbits 0-4 around
A will be used, then at orbit 10 the companion star exists, around it, it

this system to me ??????

4) When rolling up other worlds in the system, I get these strange paradox\'s

world in the system has a pop of 8, and its not the mainworld ????? . This
happens alot when the mainworld is orbiting a large gas giant in a habitible

I get the pop of those planets can never exceed the mainworld pop by more

I use the number rolled as the highest orbit number.  roll7, orbits 0 - 7.

Pick a star type you like off the list.  We (Cynthia & I) assume that any
low tech or Ag world has a comfortable temperature, so a lot of stars from
the standard lists get changed to types V and IV when someone actually
visits a world.

B is in orbit 10.  A has as available orbits for planets orbits 0-4 and
12+.
B itself has a planetary system with orbits 0-5.

We limit such cases to mainworld pop, but pop multiplier must be less than
mainworld pop multiplier.  Except when secondary worlds have lower TL, in
which case I let them have the same pop digit, and a higher pop multiplier
if that\'s the way the dice fall.

Too true.  You can twiddle the albedo quite a lot if you try.  Use Scouts
book if you have it (old Traveller), or just adjust the albedo by up to 20%
in a favourable direction to get a favourable result.  We have a world that
was developed with old Scouts, that has an ice cap covering 60% of the
planetary
surface.  The albedo of the ice keeps world temperature low enough for the
ice cap to exist.  If the ice cap were removed, the world temperature would
rise to 70C+, but the ice cap keeps it at 5C (a little cold, but the
tropics
are nice)

THE HORDE

The Horde may be the most effective marketing ploy in the history of
human civilization. It is the only known instance of a single coordinated
advertising/marketing/manufacturing campaign turning a large but
unremarkable company into an Imperially recognized megacorporation,
and its fruits are seen and accepted every day by literally trillions
of people across the entirety of known space. To date, the profits it
has netted its originators have been calculated as being enough to
purchase the fifty most populous and prosperous worlds in the Imperium
and everything on them... and the cashflow shows no signs of slowing down.

In the early centuries of the Third Imperium, starship travel was both
risky and rare, as the regrowing nation strove, often unsuccessfully,
to assure travellers of easy access to the materials and parts they needed
to keep their ships, which represented their lifelines, in working order.
It was not uncommon (as it is now, in the Rebellion, again becoming
common) for a ship to be grounded many parsecs from home because a single
part that could not be replaced by local manufacturers was lost or broken.
Even worse, this situation extended to the much more common nonstarships
that were relied upon in every system even when Jump travel was a lost
art, and forgotten until they broke down and caused trouble by their absence.
Imperial military contractors had some degree of standardization in their
gear, but this suffered from sector to sector as Solomani designers in
firms like GSbAG locked horns with Vilani designers at Sharurshid and refused
to compromise on various design points. This made waging war relatively
straightforward when the ships fought and were built in the same area, as
in the Frontier Wars, but when ships had to be moved across wider ranges
of the Imperium itself, such as in the chaos of the Civil War in the early
600s, the problems of resupply became hellish. There was no guarantee
that a naval fleet could resupply from a depot of the same Navy! The
situation was ripe for change, technological advances into the realm of TL 12
coming at the same time as turmoil and unrest in the political arena,
and it was only a matter of time before someone saw an opportunity to
make money, and leaped on it in a big way. That someone was a tiny company
on a planet with unremarkable characteristics but a fair amount of
historical import, only recently reintegrated into the Third Imperium.
The company was called General SpaceCraft, Inc., and the planet was Terra.

The Horde was conceived of by three young executives working in various
branches at the General home office on Terra. Their names have been
forgotten now, except where reverent design engineers and marketing
strategists have engraved them on their hearts while still in college.
They were led by Peter Broom, an advertising trainee who was already
showing a killer instinct suitable for a Crested Jabberwock. His two
compatriots were Stewart Provost, an Assistant Technician in R&D, and
Shannon Mills, a newly-employed manager in the Shipwrights\' Division, where
actual ship construction took place. The two hardware men were constantly
harangued by their fellow employees for their shared and rather uncommon
penchant for outlandish schemes for making the firm rich. Broom, however,
knew talent when he saw it, and risked the jeers of his superiors in
Marketing when he began sitting with the pair at lunch in the Executives\'
Cafeteria and listening, first with feigned interest and later with genuine
enthusiasm, as The Twins (as they were usually called) sketched out
weird profitmaking ideas on placemats and napkins. Broom\'s business aplomb
flattened most of those ideas in the birthing stages, but the others
didn\'t mind: there was a good, WORKABLE idea in there somewhere, and
sooner or later they\'d find it. And when they did, the Imperium\'s newest
member world was going to give it one hell of a shock.

Their first major breakthrough was the discovery of certain properties of
Tevlac, a plastic recently developed on Warinir and enjoying a fair degree
of popularity among industrial chemists for its sturdiness and easy
machinability. Tevlac, Provost discovered, developed a strong affinity
for temporary molecular rebonding upon fracture lines when stimulated with
a trickle of electric current: it would be broken into pieces, and stick
together along the breaks as long as it was connected to a battery. The
adhesion wasn\'t much, but it was enough to solve one of the starship
industry\'s biggest headaches-- how to get the little hole that always
remains when an Iris Valve closes up to seal airtight every time. Soon,
Tevlac valve-seats were in use all over known space, and the patent money
and licensing fees began flowing in. People took notice of Provost\'s
inventiveness, of the risks Mills took in trying the new technology on the
line, and Broom\'s aggressive marketing of the idea, and lights began
turning green at higher levels of management.

Mills\'s invention of gravitationally-induced hull fitting, where hulls
were friction-fit for spotwelding by the application of tight antigrav
fields, sped up spaceship hulling by 3%-- not much until one considers the
long haul, where it added up to substantial increases in productivity.
This was adopted over pin-fitting by all Imperial Navy contractors by
order of the Navy in 597. But the real boon, and the discovery that
got the corporate gears turning, was the development of the RAMKS by Provost
and Mills in 601. Up until that time, the welding and fitting of superdense
hulls was considered an expensive luxury, due to the difficulties in
getting the impenetrable materials to bond together easily. The RAMKS (an
acronym for Robo-animechaniakatasthyser) was a man-portable device
incorporating fusion and grav technology to induce superfluid states in
confined areas of superdense hullmetal, allowing smooth joins as easily
as two copper pipes could be soldered together with a brazing torch.
The explosion outward of this technology removed the last vestiges of
resistance from the Board of Directors-- what Broom, Provost and Mills
wanted, by God they got it.

The stage was set for the Horde.

In early 604, the three men, now division directors of a rapidly-expanding
company, politely asked to meet with the President and Board in a closed
session. They had, Broom said mildly, an idea. With the dollar signs
barely hidden by their contact lenses, the Board set up the meeting. It
lasted over fourteen hours, and the written records of the session were
kept sealed for nearly two hundred years. But when the meeting let out,
the President looked twenty years younger, the Board were sweating
profusely, and the Three Amigos were grinning like the cats that had just
eaten the canary. The next day, things started moving.

R&D shifted over to component design optimization. Overnight, virtually
all of the R&D division\'s time went into designing structured-modular
avionics and engine control circuitry-- the essential idea being an
interlocking design for electrical and mechanical subsystems with a
stepped degree of throughput based on the Tech Level of each component,
the lowest one in a given subsystem being its least common denominator.
These components were strictly standardized in easily-made forms, and
optimized at Tech Levels ranging from 9 to 13 (the maximum available
at the time). What this meant was that if a module blew, a TL 11 design
could use a replacement fabricated on a TL 9 world with a positive,
documented understanding of exactly which functions would be limited
and how. This degree of centralization was unheard of, except perhaps
among the Vilani megacorporations, whose designs were standardized
by default but uniform by Tech Level with little or no crossreferencing.

At the same time, the Shipwrights began building prototype hulls using
techniques easily available over the same spread of Tech Levels. The
main manufacturing areas were divided into a dozen sample field ship
construction areas, with spotwelders hobnobbing with fusioncutters
and RAMKSers and cable-trays next to fiberbundles and infralinkups.
A microcosm of ship construction techniques under one roof, carefully
hidden from the press by a normally-talkative company, began to get
tongues wagging.

Marketing used the firm\'s past history and future prospects with surgical
precision. Investors eager to cash in on the fledgling firm\'s latest
breakthrough went anywhere from buying shares on speculation to writing
blank development checks. Some of these, like Hortalez et Cie and Antares
Holdings, would later be rewarded with shares in the new company; others,
like Beechcraft Interstellar, would resist going the way of their old
rivals like Cessna and Piper (now a division of GSbAG, which watched the
proceedings with some interest and much discomfort) by merging with General
to profit more directly in what was to come. These were great risks, but as
it turned out, this early risk-taking paid back in incredible measure. The
chaos of the Civil War, which caused a great deal of damage to the Navy and
the Core sector but had little effect elsewhere, merely served as cover
for what happened next.

In 609, ships began leaving Terra for parts unknown. Properties were bought
at starports on many worlds, and carefully sealed off from public view,
first hundreds and then thousands of them. The planning had been meticulous--
each property was tiny, and raised little or no speculation on its own.
No one saw the larger pattern until it was far too late to do anything
about it. By 615, there were worlds from Jewell to Spica with these small
properties on them, and supplies were flowing from local factories to
stockpiles nearby. The only places deliberately avoided were worlds where
the Sharurshid shippers had a stranglehold on the industry-- the Vilani
weren\'t even given a whiff of what was about to happen.

In that same year, advertisements began to be posted on thousands of different
worlds, each bearing the same words: "The Horde is Coming." Public speculation
ran riot, and the overtaxed investors, certain that their long wait was about
to bear fruit, held their breath.

On Holiday of 616, the Horde was unveiled simultaneously on every planet
in the campaign. Local investors took one look at the degree of local
capital involved in the project, and began shoveling money into the
company\'s gaping maw. Shipping firms read the specs, watched the promo
films, conducted tests of their own, and began buying. The project built
up momentum and never stopped. Its first major victory came in 620, when
Tukera Lines began replacing old craft with the Horde. Soon after that,
the first Tech Level Boost Program, a system for upward compatibility
as the Imperial TL climbed, was announced, and the Imperial Navy and
Scout Service began using the Horde for non-critical tasks in thousands
of backwater bases and fringe areas. The final victory came over twenty
years later, when Sharurshid purchased the license fees to begin building
the Horde itself, and the Vilani megacorporation completed what is now
taken for granted as the base standardization of non-milspec ship parts
in the Imperium and surrounds. Broom, Provost and Mills were rather older
by then, but they were present on Vland when the agreement was signed,
and they were present before the throne of Arbellatra a year later when
the Limited Imperial Charter was granted to the new megacorporation of
General Products, LIC.

And what, precisely, WAS the Horde? Let me give as an explanation the words
of Peter Broom, taken from that first board meeting:

"Gentlemen, people are sick and tired of being strangled by the inability
to rely on standardizations when they travel. No one will agree to a set
of standards-- they have to be RAMMED down the shipping industry\'s
collective THROAT. What we are proposing here is not a glamorous action,
or even one that will be remembered, oh, five hundred years from now. What
we are about to do will lay so basic a foundation for the construction
and support of starships and orbital-support spacecraft along accepted
and standardized lines, that our designs and parts will not only be a
household word in a decade or two, but in a century the Vilani will have
caved in as well, and in TWO centuries people will have largely forgotten
that there ever WASN\'T a standard! When people of the year 1100 pick up
a copy of "Traveller: Science-Fiction Gaming in the Distant Past," and
read about the spaceship designs that were just becoming standard when
the Imperium was cracking under its own inertia and those upstarts from
Earth who\'d been in the Imperium for less than twenty years were turning
things on their collective EAR.... I want them to read about OUR designs."

And so it has been. Although General Products has taken a lot of flak
recently for its starship designs, its spacecraft, now manufactured
under subcontract by every shipping firm in the Imperium to some degree
or another, are so standard as to have been forgotten... and the industry
has upgraded them as the Tech Level advances, so that they are now on
the market from TL9 to TL16, with TL17 designs on the way.

Or, in game-design terms--

We the designers (Scott Kellogg and Rob Dean) and the storyteller/historian
(metlay his-SEFF) are proud to ceremoniously dump upon the TML community
a collection of standardized and Imperially accepted "norm" designs for
non-Jumping support craft of every type, guaranteed to work better at
all TLs than the designs written up in the MT rules and to serve in each
and every campaign that requires a TL-appropriate "vanilla ship" for
any purpose at all....

THE HORDE!

I usually use the first method, but one planet more or less shouldn\'t really

Well, you could always stick to detailing worlds from the official sectors,
where I haven\'t observed this particular problem.  However, I suspect that
you should probably just use the +4 modifier on type, rather than on both
type and size.  This will make most \'good\' worlds planets of FV stars, but\'s
that\'s better than dwarfs.

Sure.  No need to shout. (-:  You are correct in your example: Star A would
have planets at orbits 0-4 and 12+ (if necessary), and Star B would be in
Star A\'s orbit 10, with orbits 0-5 of its own.  Just imagine Jupiter as a
star, and all those moons as its planets and you\'re all set.

Sounds like a reasonable solution.  In practice, I would expect that mainworlds
which are also gas giant moons should be fairly scarce.  In any other situation
the -5 and -3 modifiers for inner and outer zone planets will tend to reduce
populations below the mainworld.  Every once in a while you could allow an
assymetrical situation such as you describe as long as you can come up with a
good explanation, but generally, I\'d adjust or reroll.

Yes, this is a bit of a problem.  Sometimes you can adjust the temperature
a bit by moving the world a little closer to the fire, or pulling it back
out a bit, but \'jungle planets\' or \'iceballs\' do seem to outnumber temperate
planets.  Temperate planets only stay temperate, you\'ve noticed, if they have
a nice dense atmosphere.  Otherwise nighttime cooling can cause summer night
frosts, which I expect could be a problem for many food crops of Terran origin.

Type R Merchant TL13

     The Type R merchant is a standard Imperial design, suitable for servic-
ing a cluster of closely spaced civilized worlds.  Fitted with a minimal
maneuver drive, the Type R may not land or take off from a planet with a
local gravity of more than 0.9Gs while fully loaded, and is frequently de-
pendent on the use of orbital facilities.  A launch is carried to provide
some capability for servicing worlds where landing is not practical.  No
weapons are shown in the ship below, although 54kl of volume have been re-
served for the installaion of up to four turrets, and the basic control
system can handle any weapons installation of up to MCr12 base cost.
     In the current unsettled conditions prevailing in the Imperium, Type R
merchants such as this are frequently found carrying both a substantial
weapons array and improved sensor systems.

Type R2 Merchant TL13

     The Type R merchant is a standard Imperial design, suitable for servic-
ing a cluster of closely spaced civilized worlds.  However, many worlds are
not located in such favorable positions, and ships with more capable jump
dirves are needed to service them.  Thus jump-2 and jump-3 versions of stand-
ard jump-1 vessels are frequently encountered in the Imperium.  This R2 can
be built using many of the same standard assemblies used by the basic Type R.
Like the basic Type R, the R2 shown below is fitted with a minimal maneuver
drive, and may not land or take off from a planet with a local gravity of
more than 0.9Gs while fully loaded, and is frequently dependent on the use of
orbital facilities.  A launch is carried to provide some capability for
servicing worlds where landing is not practical.  No weapons are shown in the
ship below, although 54kl of volume have been reserved for the installaion of
up to four turrets, and the basic control system can handle any weapons
installation of up to MCr12 base cost.
     In the current unsettled conditions prevailing in the Imperium, Type R2
merchants such as this are frequently found carrying both a substantial
weapons array and improved sensor systems.

    'body' => 'First a thankyou to the people who responded to my earlier questions
on system design, it was very helpful ........

What is the opinion of people about the command crew in Megatraveller
The book says (basically) 1 for every 6 crew . Now This has probably been
discussed before, but as I can no longer get access to the TML provided
by James Perkins, I dont know what the ending result was .

I think (as someone already pointed out, rob dean I think) that the
command crews are awfully bloated . I mean it really does not take
1 officer just to oversee the actions of 6 people . Another thing is, is
the command crew the officers . That is only command crew are the officers .
So according to the Imp Encyclopedia, The amount of officers is 1  (As in
one command personel) . Or is this the amount of officers on command duty ???

If we take a look at Star Trek the series (the old, not the new generation),
It is porbably the closest thing we have in modern film that ressembles the
navy . Now on the bridge we had Captain James T.Kirk (Commander of vessel),
Spock (Commander, Science/Computer Officer), Sulu (Lt Cmmdr (?) Pilot),
Chercov (Pilot or navigator, Lieutenant ?), Uhura (Lieut, Comm Officer) . Now
all of these people were officers, and all of them were bridge crew and
acted in Bridge areas . How does thios fit into MT ?

The old High Guard book said the average vessel had a commanding officer,
an executive officer, a pliot (officer) a navigator (an officer), a
Comm officer, oh another nav officer, a medical officer . It then goes on to
list officers needed for the other areas of the vessel such as engineering
and gunnery .

So we could have this as solution (By converting High Guard guidelines to
fit MT) .

Bridge : 75% Officers, 25% Ratings/NCOs
Engineering :  10% Officers, 20% NCO\'s, 70% Ratings
Gunnery : 10% Officers, 30% NCO\'s, 60% Ratings
Flight Crew : All pilots officers, all others are NCO\'s/Ratings
Ships Troops : Use military guidelines
Maintenance : Usually just NCOs\'/Ratings
Medical : Not sure, I would say same proportions as the Bridge .
Stewards : Not sure, proably the same as gunnery .

To convert MT ships to this, I would simply divide the command personel
amongsnt the above \'duties\' (but rationly) then work out officers as above

Officers probably would have their own staterooms (But small) .

What do people think about that ????????

Make sense etc .

BTW I would remove the maintenance section and stewards section and use the
old High Guard guidelines for service crew (ie 2 or 3 per 500 tons) .

Officers for service crew would be 5%, NCO\'s 20%, and ratings 75% .

If anyone has their own guidlines for this please, could you give me a copy ?

	The engine temperature jumped five degrees in two minutes.
"We\'re coming out of jump." Shtam called from the engine room.
	"Look," muttered Miakr softly, "I\'m really..."
	Shtam cut him off.  "Don\'t worry about it.  I\'d have a lot
of trouble handling these engines by myself.  As it is, you may
have saved us all from blowing up.  Misjump is no big deal."
	"Thanks, Shtam."
	The jump drive moaned in sympathy.  "Estimate three minutes
to relativistic space." called Shtam, "Three minutes.  All hands
to stations."
	Up on the bridge Niedrsha lounged in the pilot\'s chair.  "Ok
Jiet, let\'s get ready." he slapped her shoulder through the
battle dress.  "Any pirates just better watch out."
	"I\'d rather not have to deal with any more battles for a
while." cautioned Jietlshaiepr.  "We\'re looking for a hospital,
not a fight.  With Drert still in the ozone layer and Shtam minus
his leg, I have enough headaches.  You just find us a starport.
I\'ll take it from there.
	"Gresha, honey, you\'d better be getting inside that turret.
I am NOT looking forward to what reception we may get when we re-
enter normal space.  A misjumped ship is a very juicy target, and
pirate activity has been getting awfully heavy these days."
	"Sure, Jiet." barked the vargr wagging her tail.  "I
wouldn\'t worry too much though, we\'re probably in human space.
Human corsairs aren\'t worth much.  And if we jump into vargr
space I knew most of the corsair leaders."
	"Why\'d you decide to hook up with humans then?"
	"Well, Oddball was slowing down."  she laughed, then curling
her lip exposing the sharp canine teeth of her species, "And the
bastards running the Broadsword were bigots.  You folks seem to
appreciate ability rather than physiology.  At least Miakr seems
to..."
		- II -
	The Kliemoshie limped into normal space with a whimper from
the jump drives.  She panted and wheezed at the exertion while
she wiped the haze from her eyes and began to look around, wondering
where she\'d got to.
	"We haven\'t gone too far," thought Niedrsha aloud.  "from
the position of the stars, I\'d say no more than six or seven
parsecs.  And we\'re still in the Massina subsector for certain."
	"Got something." called Jietlshaiepr.  "We\'re one hundred
diameters out from a gas giant... Looks like there are some
pretty big power emissions, lots of neutrinos, probably a mid to
high tech system.  I hope their hospitals are in as good shape as
their power systems..."
	"Picking up a radar beacon..." she announced.  "Radio signal
incoming."
	A woman\'s voice came over, "...entified craft, come in
please... Repeat, unidentified craft come in please, this is the
F.A.B. patrol ship Flamboyant.  You will identify yourself
immediately."
	Jietlshaiepr raised her eyebrow. "Hold on a minute here...
This is a tight beam transmission."
	"So?" asked Niedrsha.
	"So, why conceal your presence if you are a patrol ship?"
	"Right... broadcast to the ship and the traffic at the gas
giant.  Come to think of it, relay their messages too."
	Jietlshaiepr hit the broadcast button.  "This is the Zhodani
Courier Kliemoshie, ZC-00113.  State your business patrol ship
Flamboyant."
	"We are on anti-pirate cruise.  Have no record of your
arrival, Kliemoshie.  Stand by."
	Jietlshaiepr tuned the ship\'s antenna to a tight beam aimed
at the gas giant.  "This is the Zhodani Courier Kliemoshie,
ZC-00113.  Request confirmation of status of patrol ship
Flamboyant."
	She read the sensors, "The Flamboyant is closing on us at
four G acceleration, four hundred tons, streamlined, five point
two five gigawatts from their reactor.  Reads out as a Fiery
class Imperial gunned escort.  Usual armament lasers and particle
accelerators."
	"Flamboyant to Kliemoshie, we have no record of your arrival
in system, please confirm."
	"Viepchakl!" thought Jietlshaiepr. "Kliemoshie to
Flamboyant, have just arrived in system."
	"Got another contact, she announced.  Much larger, ten
gigawatt reactor, eight hundred tons, approaching at five G\'s.
at extreme range and on intercept course."
	"Flamboyant to Kliemoshie, we have orders to board and
inspect all shipping.  Stop engines and prepare to receive our
party."
	A new voice came over the circuits.  "Kliemoshie, this is
Fan Belt starport control, we have no record of any patrol ship
registered as Flamboyant.  Proceed with caution.  Will send patrol
to investigate."
	"Niedrsha, get us the hell out of here!  Red alert!  All
hands shut airlocks and close battle dress."
	"Engine room.  Give her everything you\'ve got!" shouted
Niedrsha.  The Kliemoshie\'s frame squealed in protest.  "Gresha,
commence firing!"
	Gresha couldn\'t hear the order for the rattle of the
sandcaster pumping ablative sand out to shield the fleeing
courier.  She knew her business.  She needed no order.  Laser
light streamed from the turret searching for a victim.
	It swung wide of the target.  The gun ship twisted and
loosed its own onslaught of destructive energy.
	The very space around the Kliemoshie glowed with the
incoming fire as it vaporized the protective sand cloud and
touched the skin of the ship.
	Jietlshaiepr read off "We\'ve been hit.  No damage, just
cooked a bit.  Hull temperature four hundred thirty Kelvin.  No
hull rupture...  I read a flight of ships from the gas giant...
six G\'s acceleration, including a ship in the twenty thousand ton
range...at this range it will take an hour and thirty eight
minutes to intercept.  Second contact I read out as a Guppy class
cruiser.  Usual armament: lasers, missiles, sandcasters.  It will
be in range in sixty seven minutes."
	"What about the Flamboyant?" called Niedrsha.
	"Closing, interception thirty six minutes."
	Lasers swept out towards the pursuer on target.
	The Flamboyant\'s hull was momentarily lost in a fog cloud.
	"Good shooting Gresha!  I read that out as a hit to their
fuel tanks." called off Jietlshaiepr.
	"They\'ve still got their teeth." growled Gresha.  "I just
poked their stomach a bit."
	Laser flare obliterated the Kliemoshie\'s sand cloud.
	"Next one will penetrate." warned Gresha.
	The Kliemoshie began to shudder as Niedrsha redoubled his
efforts to evade.  The spiralling ship rolled and pitched,
straining the ability of the anti-acceleration-grav fields, while her
lasers flamed outward.
	One of the Flamboyant\'s turrets melted away under the jet of
Gresha\'s lasers.
	A flash of light, a blast, a shudder.  Part of the
Kliemoshie turned into slag.
	"Report in!  Anyone hurt?"  Called Jietlshaiepr.
	"Shtam here.  Engine Room intact.  Miakr, Vole and I are
Ok."
	"Gresha here.  Turret unimpaired."
	"The Air/Raft bay was destroyed." announced Drert as though
he was talking in his sleep, "Pressure leak in quarters section.
Bulkheads and frame intact."
	"How in Viepchakl does he know that?" wondered Jietlshaiepr.
	Lasers flared out again but found only empty space.
	"Grrraahcht!" barked Gresha in frustration.
	The Flamboyant\'s lasers reached out and licked the
Kliemoshie\'s hull.  Fog fumed from the gash draining away the
life blood fuel of the courier.
	"Fuel pressure\'s goin... gone.  Fuck!" shouted Niedrsha.
	"Fusion plant shutting down!" screamed Miakr.
	All lights went out aboard the courier leaving all in total
darkness.
	Red emergency lights came on dimly.
	"Batteries on emergency power.  That is all I can do.  We
were low on fuel after the jump, now it is all gone." Shtam
announced calmly.
	Silence came down like a sudden nightfall.  The ship was dead.
	Jietlshaiepr finally broke the silence.  "Stand by to repel
boarders."
		- III -
	The ship was quickly depressurized.  Crew assembled in the
lounge armed with gauss rifles.
	"Twelve crew in a Fiery class escort.  Sixteen in a Guppy
class cruiser, plus a complement of sixteen troops." reported
Shtam.  "The Guppy is an ideal pirate raider.  We ran into them
in the merchants.  They have a huge cargo capacity:  able to
accommodate over three hundred tons of ships.  They just open
their clamshells and swallow you.  I saw one eat a free trader
and still have room for two fifty ton fighters."
	"We have to stand them off long enough for the patrols to
arrive.  That\'s two hours without our engines.  The Flamboyant
will rendezvous in twelve minutes, the Guppy in forty nine."
Jietlshaiepr paced appraising the situation.  "Shtam, how well
can you move without that leg?"
	"With the ship\'s artificial grav off, I\'m fine.  A little
slower but adequate.  It seems to be regenerating itself.  It
beats me what Drert did to it though."
	"Right.  Boarding party...  Tactics...  Suggesions?"
	"Ambush." growled Gresha.
	"Set up where?  Where are they going to come in?"
	"They might not board at all until we\'re inside the Guppy\'s
cargo hold." thought Niedrsha.
	"No." said Shtam decisively, "In order to get the ship into
the hold they will have to have men handling her very carefully.
They will not chance our taking on a busy work crew."
	"Well, if I were them, I\'d burn through the hull." growled
Gresha, "They want the ship.  Why else call in another ship
capable of carrying her out?  Ships go for good money in this low
tech sector.
	"The front wind screen\'s easy to smash and board through,
but it\'d get the bridge shot up.  Airlock is harder to fix than
the hull.  Hull material is cheap, sections of it are already
damaged.  Probably come in through the Air/Raft bay, it\'s already
smashed.  Can set up ambush there."
	"Right." nodded Jietlshaiepr.  "Good thinking.  Miakr, you
and Vole inspect the bay, find the best place to setup an ambush.
Niedrsha, you cover the bridge.  Yell if you see anything and get
out.  Shtam, you cover the airlock.  Gresha, you ever been
teleported?"
	Gresha cocked her head confusedly.  "No."
	"I can carry two of us in a teleport.  I bet we could jump
out, get in a few good shots and catch them off guard."
	"We could use the tech fourteen plasma guns:  no recoil."
snarled Gresha with a wagging tail.
	"Exactly."
		- IV -
	"Miakr, their headed your way." radioed Niedrsha from the
bridge.  "Good call Gresha!"
	"How many?" demanded Jietlshaiepr.
	"Eight, two in combat armor, six in vacc suits.  The ones in
combat armor are guarding the airlock.  The rest are headed to
the Air/Raft bay with some laser welders.  The ones in combat
armor have laser rifles, the rest have accelerator rifles.  I
think most have snub pistols as well."
	"They\'ve started cutting." announced Vole.   "Estimated time
of entry:  seven minutes forty seconds... Mark!"
	"Right.  Niedrsha, you get down to the bay and help Miakr.
Gresha, we\'ll pay a little visit in two minutes, let\'s move to
the lock."
	Gresha growled softly to herself.
		- V -
	"Grakvozan!  Teleportation is neat!" wondered Gresha with awe
as she found herself outside the ship shoulder to shoulder with
Jietlshaiepr.
	Twin figures floated out side the airlock of the Kliemoshie.
	Twin plasma bolts leaped across the vacuum.
	Twin explosions.
	Twin figures spiraled into the vacuum, leaving a cloud of
vaporized organs and metal.
	"Better than I\'d hoped for.  All right team, come out the
airlock, we may be able to press this attack home."  Jietlshaiepr
turned.  The bay was hidden by the bulk of the ship.  "Bring out our
gauss rifles as well.  If we get aboard the Flamboyant, plasma guns
are a bit much."
		- VI -
	With the power off the airlock had to be opened by hand, but
Niedrsha and Miakr had gotten through by the time the sentries
were missed.
	Two vacc suit helmets peered around the bulk of the hull
before they were seared off by Gresha and Jietlshaiepr.
	"That\'ll scare the fuck out of \'em." observed Niedrsha.
	"Four on four." thought Miakr.  "Let\'s take \'em."
	They split up and jetted around the ship\'s hull to see the
four pirates in flight.  The Flamboyant\'s airlock was wide open.
Miakr opened up on the trailing pirate.  Gauss needles flew
undeflected, and unerringly to the target which clamped its leg
as it fired at Niedrsha.
	The accelerator rifle bullet rammed its way through
Niedrsha\'s armor over his right arm, almost spoiling his aim.
His own gauss needles went home on the smallest of the pirates.
The helmet simply exploded.  The corpse continued to float toward
the Flamboyant\'s looming hull.
	Suddenly, Drert appeared next to Niedrsha and both vanished.
	Two plasma bolts struck the third pirate which completely
vaporized the fleeing man.
	Bullets clicked off Jietlshaiepr\'s armored torso.
	"Hey you!  Lay off my chest!"  An indignant blast of plasma
subdivided the fourth pirate from it\'s groin and lower legs which
tumbled into the vacuum.
	Miakr\'s second volley of shots shredded the remaining
pirates legs.  The body hung limply, suspended in space.
	The Flamboyant started moving.
	"Viepchakl!" shouted Jietlshaiepr.  She teleported into the
open airlock and was slammed against the side of the ship.  She
quickly looked through the view port and then teleported inside.
	She would have jumped a kilometer had it not been for the
ceiling.
	"Hi Jiet!  Welcome aboard." laughed Niedrsha as Drert stood
over him.
	"To the bridge.  How\'s your arm?"  without waiting for an
answer she ran ahead.
	"Never better."
	None of them had been aboard a Fiery class escort before but
the bridge was pretty easy to guess at.
	The pilot heard them coming.  She had a snub pistol trained
at the corridor and loosed high explosive bullets at Jietlshaiepr
as she burst through.
	Six shells exploded harmlessly on Jietlshaiepr\'s chest
plates.
	"Leave my tits alone, bitch!"  Jietlshaiepr slapped the
panicked pilot in the mouth.  The strength enhancement of the
battle dress rocked her head back and laid her neck at an ugly
angle.
	Niedrsha pulled her from the console and swung the ship into
a spin.  "Fuck those Imperial designers!"  He soon had it under
control and headed back to the Kliemoshie.
	Jietlshaiepr grabbed the scanners.  There was one more crew
member aboard.  The Guppy class cruiser would rendezvous in
twenty six minutes.
	"One last crew member aboard." she explained, "I\'ll take
care..."
	"Not any more." said Drert simply.  He then sat down on the
deck and began opening the chest of his battle dress.
	"How..." she started to ask, but noticed Drert was lost in
an examination of his belly button, then checked the scanners.
the only life on board was them.
		- VII -
	The crew was quickly transferred to the Flamboyant.
	"Ghrresh!" barked Gresha from the dorsal turret, "Where is
the particle accelerator?"
	"What\'s wrong?" shouted Jietlshaiepr.
	"This is a missile turret.  There\'s an Air/Raft bay here
instead of the particle barbette and... Grraaah!  Verracht!  This
ship carries nuclear missiles!"
	"What!?"
	"This turret is armed with nuclear missiles!"
	"Guppy class cruiser, twenty one minutes to interception."
read off Shtam.  "Patrol cruisers:  one hour forty minutes.  I
make the large ship in the patrol out as a Viepchakl class Battle
rider.  I think we should give some of these missiles back to
their rightful owners?"
	"My sentiment\'s exactly, Shtam." nodded Jietlshaiepr.
	"Graah, just say the word, Jiet and I\'ll stuff some
plutonium down their throats." snarled Gresha.
	Shtam studied the sensors.  "They are coming in on a nice
lateral course.  No sandcasters in operation, no evasive action,
just a nice fat target.  They have even opened the cargo bay
doors."
	"Gresha," sighed Jietlshaiepr, "They\'re hungry, why don\'t
you give them a nice mouthful or two?"  She stretched herself in
such a way that, even with her battle dress on, made one want to
throw back one\'s head and howl.
	"Well Jiet," laughed Gresha, "I\'ll try but I just don\'t have
your... qualifications."
	The black face plate of her battle dress hid her reaction.
"Stand by for evasive action.  Hands to what ever stations you can
find.  Gresha, fire when ready."
	A soft shush announced the departure of the nuclear warhead
laden missiles.
	"Nukes away!...  Engine\'s hot and running."
	"Evasive action!" barked Jietlshaiepr.  "She\'s starting to
evade.  Where are those lasers?"
	Drert fired on the gaping maw of the approaching cruiser.
Just as the bay began to close the laser strike bore in blasting
the decks adjoining.  Fuel leaked into space flaming briefly as
it combined with the leaking air of the ship and then snuffing
out as flame met vacuum.
	The jaws jammed fast leaving a leaking flaming mouth open to
vacuum.  Seconds later the missiles streaked into the hungry
mouth of the cruiser.
	A blinding flash came out of the belly of the cruiser.  The
silhouetted form of the top half of the ship was barely visible
above the brilliance of the brief fission powered star.
	Half of the ship tumbled, glowing white hot and radioactive
from the blaze.  End over end she tumbled for three seconds then
it flared again and was gone.
	An expanding cloud of radioactive plasma blew into space.
		- VIII -
	Jietlshaiepr slouched back in the command chair exhausted.
She opened the clamshell helmet of her battle dress and sighed.
"All right." she purred.  "Now, I am a little bit tired of being
shot at today.  Shtam, you said that the ship headed towards us
is a Viepchakl class battle rider."
	"Yes.  She is unmistakable."
	"Ok, now.  The only ship that carries the Viepchakl in this
area is based in Tloql sector at Chronor.  That being the Zhdant
itself:  a one million ton battle carrier.  What on the moons of
Zhdant is the pride of the Consular Navy doing here?  Fan Belt is
an independent system." she pondered aloud.  "Well, I guess we\'ll
just have to talk to them.  But as soon as we hit the starport,
we\'re going to bed."
		- IX -
	It took some explaining indeed.  The ship turned out to be
the Viepchakl itself, named for the once worshiped moon of Zhdant
which still bore some reverence or irreverence as the case may
be.  The captain of such a ship commands respect.  But, the last
thing he expected to hear was a report from an overtired and
voluptuous noble who had just captured the ship he was supposed to
be rescuing her from.
	The questions came tumbling out.  Where was the owner of the
Kliemoshie:  Dr. Malenkoviepr?  Why did the ship misjump?  How
did they contact the Flamboyant?  How did they take the
Flamboyant?  Were there any injuries that needed treatment?  Were
there any survivors among the pirates?  And where did they get
Ultra top of the line Zhodani Noble Commando battle dress and
Imperial plasma guns?
	Fortunately, the captain was familiar with those Zhodani who
worked with the Ine Givar and some sticky little questions got by
with the slimmest answers.
	The Flamboyant was towed to the starport by the Viepchakl
while the Kliemoshie was refueled by three Zhdits class D.E.\'s
and brought in under armed escort.
		- X -
	Jietlshaiepr never got a chance to keep her promise.  Four
minutes after docking Jietlshaiepr was requested to see
Tlievriashav.  Request it was, and polite too, but one does not
make the High Consul of the entire Ikar sector wait.
	Five hours later, a quite exhausted, curvaceous commando
trudged up the ramp of the courier.
	"Better start packin\' your stuff, crew.  The Kliemoshie\'s
being commandeered tomorrow at thirteen hundred hours."
	"What!?" came the unanimous response of disbelief.
	"Tlievriashav\'s taking her.  He needs a courier for his
consular cruiser.  His own was destroyed or captured by probably
the self same pirates we just fought.
	"We are to be given possession of the Flamboyant, *minus* the
nuclear missiles.  We have to go to Massina first but then she\'ll
be turned over to us."
	"Massina Belt!" exploded Miakr, "Why there?"
	Jietlshaiepr looked at him startled. "Well, they want to run
a number of tests on the ship to find out what they can from it.
To get a lead on these pirates.  Best place to run the tests is at
the sector capital."
	"What about Dr. Malenkoviepr?" asked Niedrsha.
	"We\'ll need a ship to find him.  And the old "Moshie" is
going on to bigger circles."
	"Why?  What\'s going on here?" asked Shtam.  "Why does a big
wheel like Tlievriashav want a broken down shot up old courier like
the Kliemoshie?"
	"You\'ve all heard of Horltheur?  Highest tech planet in the
Ikar sector, and one of the most volatile.  There\'s been a war."
	"Big war?" asked Shtam.
	"Yeah, nuclear.  The whole northern continent was just about
wiped out.  The Zhdant is going there escorting hospital ships
from the Consulate and Fan Belt.  Tlievriashav needs a courier,
and the Kliemoshie is the only one available.
	"Big political push:  influence gathering.  The Imperium is
sending a fleet of it\'s own hospital ships.  Accompanied by their
fleet.  The Darrians, the Sword Worlds, The Dynchia, all the
governments, big and small, they\'re all sending ships.  A big
humanitarian effort that all sides can milk for propaganda values,
and maybe save a few lives in the bargain."
	"How does the Fan Belt fit in?" wondered Niedrsha.
	"It\'s the medical capital of the sector.  We can gain
influence with them while we prove to all that the Consulate is
just as humane as the Imperium if not more so."
	"Wait a minute, what about recompence for the doctor?" asked
Gresha.
	Jietlshaiepr laughed.  "Now this is the crazy part, the doc
will get his money, but he\'s not receiving money for the value of
the ship, he\'s getting the *replacement* value.  Full cost of a
new courier.  And I have custody of the money till he is found:  one
hundred and one million, six hundred seventy one thousand, six
hundred and fifty credits.
	"Now you\'ve got the whole story.  We\'ll have enough time
here to use the medical facilities before we leave for Massina."
She stretched out in a mouth watering way, leaned over calmly and
picked up Niedrsha and threw him over her shoulder.
	"Now, Niedrsha, there are a couple of things I need to go
over with you..."  Suddenly, they were gone.  Or rather, they
were gone, their clothes stayed behind.  They stood there like a
bizarre artwork for a moment in the positions Jietlshaiepr and
Niedrsha had been in.  Then, they slowly floated to the deck of
the cabin.
	"Now that," observed Gresha admiringly "is a trick I\'ve GOT
to learn."

In the Alien volume on Villani and Vargr by DGP, there are two reference
to a group called the Society of Equels ("Dzen Aeng Kho") based in the
Gvurrdon system in the Dzveronguoe Sub-Sector.  Both are passing references,
one of which is buried in the example of systems in vargr space.  The other
reference makes a passing mention as the Dzen Aeng Kho as being a somewhat
restrictive government (compared to the merchant line being described
in the text).

I am sorry I can\'t cough up page numbers - my traveller
references reside far from this terminal, and I was lucky enough to
remember the piece of paper with the name and planet info...I\'ve only been
forgetting to post this inquiry for three or four weeks now...

What I\'d like to know is: is there any info on this organization anywhere?
Or is the name dropping of the Dzen Aeng Kho all there is?  Inquiring minds
(me and my GM) want to know...

At less than 5 meters a person with pistol-2 can hit someone wearing the

At medium range it would require pistol-13 to hit with a rolled 12.

The Traveller Alien series (aborted at two out of five books by the abrupt
departure of DGP from the Traveller business, may they go Chapter 11 for
their sin (not of abandoning us, but of stupidity: AI looks like the dumbest
game since, well, since MegaTraveller. But I digress)) contains a lot of 
useful data on the history and cultural background of these four races, 
including character rollup info, but without the advanced character gen
stuff in the old GDW series. Since the two series do not conflict with
one another in any substantive way (all you rules lawyers out there who
want to argue missing lines and skill eligilbilities, please shut up and
go away), I regard them ALL as essential, ten volumes in all (two by DGP
and eight by GDW).

Catie, the only data on the Society of Equals that has ever been published
anywhere is what you have before you. Sorry.

BTW, was anyone else as offended as I was at "Wolfsport"? What a totally
bozotic and monochrome representation of the Vargr. And here I\'d been
hoping that the Antares article was a sign of an upward trend....

Virtual reality systems are being created now and certainly present

I would imagine a similar setup to a Holodeck is feasible in Traveller.
If holodisplays are available for workstations they should be easy
enough to erect in a larger setting, such as a building. Now, I\'ll
agree that simulating other sensory data might be a little difficult
but they could be introduced as chemical sprays. I would imagine
pharmacology has advanced enough that hallucinogenic drugs are
pretty common and powerful. They could allow one to experience all
sorts of sensations.

You could say that for most of their technology! I have a hard time
with the low tech planets they visit, especially the Federation ones.

Another point I\'d like to bring up is frictionalless surfaces. What
would be the technology level required to produce it? Could it be
produced with varying results, such as level 1 would be 10%, level
2 20% and so on, or is the nature of the material such that it would
be all or nothing?

Sorry, but there is a lot more to Vargr than furry humans with tails,

one often finds in Challenge etc, you have to wonder how it is these
hyper-aggressive morons managed to survive long enough to settle an area
that is about as large as the Imperium if not larger!

Another disturbing trend I\'ve found in recent magazines is the lack of
thought going into the prep of the adventures they\'ve put out.  In Wolfsport,
the players are challenged to a fight in an arena with the current champion.
The author then goes on to outline a lot of possible outcomes and actions the
players might take.

But NOWHERE does he even mention the idea that the players might enter the
arena, take on a highly motivated, very strong vargr with Infighting-4, and
tactical skill, who is hopped up on combat drug, and LOSE!  This seems the
most likely outcome to me!

Another recent article had the players trapped in a room with a sniper on the
roof.  They were required to climb up a rope ladder to get to him while under
fire from the sniper.  The sniper had a gauss rifle and Combat Rifleman-5!
SURE!  How many players are gonna be left?

Another recent article had the players find several Zhodani hiding in a
packing crate.  No mention of what the heck they are doing.  They\'re just
there.  Ah-Yup!

staff doesn\'t.  (Sigh!)

An old issue of CHALLENGE has an article set on the politics of the

really did a lot to fill out the thin spots in the character I\'m
running in the PBEM....

Bozotic???
 
So why can\'t some Vargr be idiotic?  After all some humans are.  I thought 
the scenario was fair-to-moderately silly, though I would have enjoyed 
handing that Vargr his head if the scenario had been run in our campaign.

Here are my two cents worth with the caveat that I am not a Chemist/Physicist/
Materials Scientist.

I would say that any particular material would have a constant coefficient of
friction, with perhaps, slight variations due to different alloying materials
and manufacturing techniques used.  However, it should be possible to make new
materials with lower and lower coefficients of friction, probably dependant on
tech level.
     up to TL  8 normal
           TL  9 20% Friction Free
           TL 10 30% FF
           TL 12 50% FF
           TL 13 60% FF
           TL 15 80% FF
           TL 16 90% FF
           TL 17 99% FF

It will probably be \'impossible\' to create matter that is totally friction-
free, but forcefields are another matter. 8+)  Another thing to consider is
the other characteristics of the material.  Is it brittle?  Melts at low temps?
Hard to machine?  Poisonous to humans?

What would it be used for?  Sidewalks? (probably not)  Engine bearings? (yes)
Wheels? (no, wheels depend on friction to work)  Recreation?  (sure)  How about
the equivalent of water slides (have to be totaly enclosed or you would flip
out at the first turn) or downhill skiing? (you can only go straight down the
hill cause you need friction to turn)  Other than things like engine bearings,
the biggest use would be recreation.

An alternative to frictionless materials is the \'Friction field generator\'
(invented by James Blish in one of his _Cities_in_Flight_ books).  I can\'t
remember the exact explanation given (which may have been BS anyway...), but
the effect was to reduce (or increase!) the friction coefficient of ANY matter
within its field.  I would tend to place this invention at TL 19 or more.

I had this great idea several years ago for a material, one of whose secondary
characteristics, is that it was frictionless.  It had other properties which
I won\'t go into here, because one of the guys in the campaign listens in here
(hi Jay!), and I may start it up again in the future.  If anyone is interested,
I\'ll be happy to explain further by email.

Presumably they use something to make tech 13 holodynamic controls
work. I always figured it was some sort of energy pulse to the

Speare for writing the original -- James]

Two years ago the FCC tried and (with your help and letters of protest)
failed to institute regulations that would impose additional costs on modem
users for data communications.

Now, they are at it again.  A new regulation that the FCC is quietly working
on will directly affect you as the user of a computer and modem.  The FCC
proposes that users of modems should pay extra charges for use of the public
telephone network which carry their data.  In addition, computer network
services such as CompuServ, Tymnet, & Telenet would also be charged as much
as $6.00 per hour per user for use of the public telephone network.  These
charges would very likely be passed on to the subscribers.

The money is to be collected and given to the telephone company in an effort
to raise funds lost to deregulation.

Jim Eason of KGO newstalk radio (San Francisco, CA) commented on the
proposal during his afternoon radio program during which, he said he learned
of the new regulation in an article in the New York Times.  Jim took the
time to gather the addresses which are given below.

Here\'s what you should do (NOW!):

 1- Pass this information on.  Capture the information which contains
    the text you are reading now.  Find other BBS\'s that are not
    carrying this information.  Upload the ASCII text into a public
    message on the BBS, and also upload the file itself so others can
    easily get a copy to pass along.

 2- Print out three copies of the letter which follows (or write your
    own) and send a signed copy to each of the following:

         Chairman of the FCC
         1919 M Street N.W.
         Washington, D.C. 20554

         Chairman, Senate Communication Subcommittee
         SH-227 Hart Building
         Washington, D.C. 20510

         Chairman, House Telecommunication Subcommittee
         B-331 Rayburn Building

Here\'s the suggested text of the letter to send:

   Dear Sir,

   Please allow me to express my displeasure with the FCC proposal
   which would authorize a surcharge for the use of modems on the
   telephone network. This regulation is nothing less than an attempt
   to restrict the free exchange of information among the growing
   number of computer users. Calls placed using modems require no
   special telephone company equipment, and users of modems pay the

In terms of practical applied physics, we currently know of no
material or combination of materials, which, when in contact and
sliding past one another, are frictionless.  Molecules are bumpy
little bastards, even in low friction combinations like teflon and
polyethylene, or steel and lubricating oil.  Even in low friction
materials, molecules interact with one another, bumping and stripping
electrons and destroying molecular bonds, pulling and wearing away
both materials.  The entire science of bearings is involved in
"getting the friction out" by engineering design (compare replacing a
sleeve or journal with a ball bearing) or by adding lubricants.

I don\'t think there will ever be a frictionless material, unless of
course someone finds a way to make "smooth" molecules, which according
to our physics, both newtonian and relativistic, is impossible.  On
the other hand, who knows what strange physics the future holds?  I
opine, however, that the nature of molecular interaction, (which is
the level at which friction is well explained), will not be subject to
change even as our knowledge of physics expands.  

Even today, there are remarkable low friction materials.  Most of
these materials have significant problems which prevent them from
being generally available for widespread commercial applications.  The
typical problems are strength of the material (bearings are subjected
to some pretty hefty stresses), bonding failure when bonded to a
stronger material, and cost, to name a few.  Given that we have the
technology today to make really low friction materials, albeit
expensively, I would estimate that by, say TL10, most of the problems
we have today will go away.

Why bother with frictionless materials?  The area of mechanical
engineering where you want no friction is in bearing design.  And true
frictionless bearings were invented in the 1970\'s for the european
space program.  <The French Government (through the government
corporation which manufactures the rocket engines for the eureopean
space program) owns the patent rights.>  Each bearing is custom
designed, so they are VERY VERY expensive.  There is no bearing
surface - the components never touch because the rotor is suspended
inside a magnetic field.

The largest frictionless bearing so far was made for a IR gas turbine
at a power plant - the rotor (ie, the turbine shaft) was to the tune
of 10s of tons (I want to say 20, but I\'m pulling figures out of my
memory - I really should go home and look the numbers up, but I
confess I\'m being lazy).  So size is not a limitation.  Also, the
position of the rotor inside the field is actively controlled by an
analog filter (a frightening concept in this modern day of digitized
controls) - the resonance frequencies of the rotor can be filtered out
so the rotor can actually spin at a speed GREATER than its critical.
All of this is possible NOW (life is stranger than fiction...) though
at very large price tag.

>From a traveller perspective, I would say the frictionless bearings
become available at our current TL; the price tag, power consumption,
and physical size fall with increasing TL (the bearing is an
electromagnet - now think about the size required for an electromagnet
to float a 20 ton turbine shaft...).

Is anyone interested enough in frictionless bearings for me to go home
and generate some traveller charts for them?  (I think they\'re rather
esoteric myself...for traveller purposes, I would just go ahead and
assume that I could use them cheaply by, say, TL12.)

I suspect I\'m getting pedantic at this point, so I\'ll wrap this up.

    'body' => 'A quick note on high tech bearings:

A few years back, I was working at the Naval Research Lab in DC in diamond
thin film coatings.  This technology has a lot of applications in future
technology.

For one, diamond has a very low co-efficient of friction.  Diamond coated
bearings will not only be extremely durable, but have very low friction.
Diamond is also a very good heat conductor.  Therefore cooling these bearings
will be a lot easier.

Durable,
Low friction,
Good Heat conductivity,
Good optical qualities,
Good semiconductor.

Sounds pretty good don\'t it?  Problem is that right now, we can\'t grow single
crystal diamond films.  Not yet, but pretty soon.  They are studying a lotta
techniques to get these things working.  Just before I left I heard about a
new idea that was producing good results.  (They were going after the patent
so I\'m not sure if I can say much.  Ask me in a couple years...)

But basically growing diamond films is very easy.  Polycrystalline films are
dead simple.  You can grow them with an acetylene welding torch.  The trick is
getting the right temperature in the flame and the correct temperature on the
substrate.  You also have to worry about the purity of your acetylene and
oxygen in your welding torch.

If you\'ve got the right conditions, you will grow a diamond coating.  The
rate of growth is currently very slow, but that\'s one of the things they are
working on.   One of they guys at the lab wanted to grow a diamond about a
kilgram in mass to give to Cher (Don\'t ask!)  However, I did a little back of
the envelope calculations and found that it would take 300 years or so to
grow at current rates.  (Cher won\'t be looking so great in 300 years...)

However, even these dirty polycrystalline films could be polished down to a
smooth surface for use in bearings.  Then the problem of adhearance to the
substate comes in.  The polycrystalline lattice has weak points in it and these
can lead to failure.

Other uses of diamond:
Diamond doped with boron makes an excellent semiconductor.  It is much faster,
more durable, and radiation hard than silicon, gallium arsinide, and silicon
carbide.  With the added heat conductivity of diamond it will be a LOT easier
to pack a lotta circuits into a diamond computer chip and your diamond
supercomputer won\'t have to be cooled with liquid nitrogen.

Diamond also has some very nice optical properties.  It is much more
transparant in certain frequency ranges than glass or quartz.  So your TL 13+
x-ray lasers may be using diamond optics for their lenses and mirrors.

At the current rate of R&D, I\'d guess that diamond  thin films,
semiconductors and optics will be available at TL9.  But Diamond computers
will hold off till TL 10.  (They\'ll have to redevelop a lot of circuitry
etching techniques which are currently geared toward silicon)

For those of you who were there and remember, This is what Tweel and \'Vouf
were arguing about (and annoying everyone :-) for weeks in the PBEM.  (I think
that discussion was the spark that demanded that the PBEMCHAT line be set
up! :-)  Diamond films for use in cooling and monotoring Jump drives.  If you
coated a starship with a diamond thin film coating doped with boron, you could
then cool the grid more efficiently, and monitor the grid by etching circuitry
into that film you can install sensors to monitor the grid.

Tweel originally suggested that the grid could be reduced to an evaporated
thin coating of lanathaum and coat that with a thin film of diamond to
protect it.  \'Vouf then quashed that one by bringing up the possibility of
battle damage.  In the end the proposal was to coat the grid with diamond
thereby helping the cooling which would decrease the mass of the needed
lanthanum and thereby decreasing the cost of the drive.  OF course all of this
is arguing about non-existant jump technolgy, but I\'m sure that you get the
point that diamond could be VERY useful for trav technology.

One thing that you may want to note is that the coefficient of friction 
is a property of two substances sliding on each other, so wood on ice 
has a very different coefficient of friction from wood on sandpaper.

"Frictionless" means no friction. Zero.  I think you\'re thinking of 
smaller and smaller coefficients of friction, and a far more natural way
to list that would be to say the coef. of friction of the slipperiest 
substance known decreases by an order of magnitude with each tech level:
ie.  0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001, etc.

I\'m curious as to why anyone really cares about improvement in 
low-friction substances.  Surely this sort of thing just gets lumped 
into "improved engine efficiency", or some such.

Incidentally, guys, don\'t make the argument based on "free exchange of 
information", because they\'re not trying to restrict what you say. 
They\'re just trying to make you pay more for a piece of equipment that
sits on your desk.

Object because modem users should not subsidize the phone companies.

Quantum mechanics disagrees.

If you count "zero viscosity" as equivalent to "zero friction",
we know of at least two frictionless substances: Helium-4 at 
temperatures below 4 K, and Helium-3 at temperatures below 1.5 K.
(If for some reason you care about the exact temperatures, look them up. 
Don\'t quote me.)  Both substances undergo phase changes to superfluid 
states, and develop some distinctly strange properties. And before 
anyone says that these temperatures are too cold to be useful, remember 
two things: we\'re talking about working in space, where the ambient 
temperature is on this order of magnitude, and that ten years ago, 
it was thought that superconductivity could only occur at these 
temperatures.

Give the (deservedly) anonymous author a no-prize for a clearer
understanding of low-friction technology than toilet
technology.  The principal reason toilets have water in them is
to prevent odors escaping.  Not only is the brown stuff
submerged in water during use but, much more importantly,
Crapper\'s celebrated invention is designed so that there is
always a water barrier between the user and the main sewer
line.  Without this barrier, one\'s home would soon begin to
smell like a sewer.  The flushing action is designed mainly to
carry offensive materials through the barrier.  Consider the
predecessor of the flush toilet, in which a *very* low
coefficient of friction exists between the target material and
the transport on the way to the final disposal destination
:-).  Not something I\'d want in my home.

I think this was "A World Out of Time" by Larry Niven.  An excellent
book, highly recommended.  Try to imagine the earth after a million
years or so, now a satellite of Jupiter.

I remember something similar from "David Starr, Space Ranger", space
opera by Isaac Asimov.  Much of the science is somewhat drechlich,
but he pointed out in several cases that surfaces without surface
tension (probably not actually frictionless) would save water on
Mars, where every drop is precious.
 
Is that what you were thinking of?

No doubt about it! But I imagine if a society is advanced enough
to create a frictionless surface it also has the means to keep
odors under control. Then again, I didn\'t say it was a good idea
only an interesting one! :-)

As to the particular novel, A World Out of Time by Niven and

Which MegaTraveller game do you have 1 or 2?

MegaTrav 1 has problems in the earlier releases. If you have an early
release write to Paragon for an update. How to tell if you have an
earlier release? Since I don\'t have the game with me it would be just
as easy to call Paragon and find out. [ Really helpful, huh! :-)]

Flying the ship is about as bad as trying to control the combat.
MT2 simplifies both and is more flexible. First off, this may sound
dumb but, make sure you have enough fuel. It\'s easy to forget to
refuel, usually you do it just once then you remember the next time!
I did! Second, each position on the ship controls different functions.
Switching between them is a pain, again it\'s easier in MT2. If you\'re
in the wrong station the other stations keep on doing what they were
told previously. Which is ok most of the time but to land the ship
stop movement in orbit around the planet. Once in orbit select land
and that should do it. 

Skill level of your characters also plays a part. If they are not
high enough it is difficult to control actions. Weapon skills being
a prime example! If you watch your lower level skill characters
shoot the beams fly all over the place. The same goes for piloting
and nav skills. Accuracy at lower levels is really poor.

The stories that Jim Baranski and Bart Massey are talking about sound like
Larry Niven / Jerry Pournelle collaborations.  I think that the friction-
less toilet appears in _Mote In God\'s Eye_, as one of the Brownies\' 
constructions aboard the _MacArthur_.  The story reads a lot like something
out of Classic Traveller, black globes and all.  Sequel due out soon, but
it stands alone.

There is a story about hiding from enemies in a solar system with
some very dangerous planets in one of the "Man-Kzin Wars" books too, which
are usually Niven collaborations with Pournelle and at least one other
author.  It seems that his contract with the publisher for the _Mote_
sequel stipulates that it will be the next Niven/Pournelle book, but
says nothing about three-way collaborations.... :)

    'body' => 'Hey guys,

Got a question for ya.  Been on my back burner for a while.
Pseudo-biological robots.  How good are they at passing for the real thing?

According to What little we know, TL 15 is minimal for attempting to pass for
human.  To me, that sounds kinda high and lesser levels of deception might be
possible.  For instance:  If someone wanted a pseudo-biological border guard,
how hard would it be for them to pass for a human in that occupation?

I think that it would be relatively easy to build a robot that could pass a
cursory inspection.  The main difficulties would be getting the robot\'s body
language correct.  You might build a motorized manequin, but all the
articulations would be difficult.  Getting the skin to move properly as it is
the muscle simulators move underneath it.  Particularly important (at least in
human models) would be getting the facial muscles right.  It won\'t pass for
human if it smiles like a gargoyle!

Ok, now DGP says that the TL 15 pseudo-bio Aybee from their adventures can pass
as a human with exceptional success.  I haven\'t read all their adventures, but
seems that they managed to fool 98% of those they came in contact with.

Ok, what about a TL 14 attempt at a pseudo-bio?  There is an Aslan Pseudo-Bio
in 101 robots.  They indicate that it does have problems interacting in all
situations, but clearly it CAN pass in some situations.

Go lower.  What about a TL 12 or 13 pseudo-bio?  I would guess that pass in
fewer and fewer cases, but I would guess that it could still manage to pass
as an East German Border Guard or a Yankee State Trooper. :-)
I know a few professors who could very well *BE* TL 11 pseudo-bios!  (YAWN!)

A quick breakdown of Pseudo-Bios in their ability to fool people:
(I tried to come up w/ examples you folks might have seen before)

TL 17+	Virtually indistinguishable  (Think of the replicants from Blade
	Runner)

TL 16	Extremely good in normal circumstances.  (Think new Star Trek:  Lore)

TL 15	Quite good in normal circumstances.  Can fool most people virtually
	all the time.  (Think of the pseudo-bios in Alien(s)).

TL 14	Ok.  Can fool most people, best only under certain circumstances.
	Limited in their ability by their area of experience.  You don\'t wanna
	talk to a robot programmed as a pilot on the topic of music or art
	appreciation.  (Think of the androids in the old Star Trek:  I Mudd)
	("I am not programmed to respond in that area...")

TL 13	Can fool people only in the proper circumstances.  Otherwise almost
	immediately distinguishable as a robot.  (Think Data from the new
	Star Trek)  If you get them off the subject of their own expertise,
	they are hopeless.  The movement is kinda stiff.  Facial expression
	Not quite up to snuff.

TL 12	Can fool people only if the robot shows no emotion.  Has all the acting
	ability of Arnold Shwartzeneger.  Has virtually no knowlege outside of
	their application programs.  Facial expression:  must maintain a
	poker face.  Movement more stiff.  (Terminator, Gunslinger from
	Westworld)

TL 11	Can fool people only if it stands still.  Walk is awkward - looks
	funny.  (Think Lurch from the Addams Family)

TL 10	No better than a contoured robot.

How \'bout the effects of the TL can vary dependant upon who is interacting
with the robot.  Thus a human dealing with an Aslan pseudo-bio would have more
difficulty figuring it out than the same human with a human pseudo-bio.  Say
a robot would be effectively one or two tech levels higher in it\'s ability to
fool sophonts.  Thus you could have a Aslan pseudo-bio at tech 14 deceive
humans as well as a TL 15 human configured bot.  (Or maybe a TL 12 Hiver bot!)
(Who knows?  Maybe the Hiver you\'ve been dealing with is a robot.  Then again,
Maybe *ALL* The Hivers are robots...  Who\'d notice the difference?  Who\'d
care?)

Anybody got any ideas on this?  I\'m real curious.

Mott Given asks:
:  1) I am having a hard time being able to control my spaceship to land it on 
:  a world.

What always worked out for me was to:
  find the world I wanted to land on
  head toward it at about 10 - 15 speed units
  slam on the breaks when I was really close.
  
If I remember, the slam on the brakes routine was a spacebar, or mouse
click in the center box of the velocity/attitude control thingy.  It took
me a few days to get the hang of it.  Then it was easy.


:  I haven\'t found the instruction manual very helpful. 

So what else is new?  If they\'d pay me, I\'d write \'em a good one.  :=)

:  I wind up running out of fuel before I can land anywhere.  Sometimes 
:  I can get close to a world, but cannot land on it.  I even find it 
:  difficult to navigate well enough to get close to a world.  

The trick is to slow down *rapidly* when you\'re near a planet.  The 
only effective way I ever found is described above.  Trying retro-
thrust is just too slow.  If you can get stopped, or at least crawlingly 
slow, the starport will just capture you.

Navigating is another one of those things I sorta dislike.  You have to
have a player with Pilot-2.  For the first month or two I played, I 
resorted to using strictly vertical and strictly horizontal movements.
Much easier to control.  When you leave hyperspace, immediately stop.
Then look at the relative planet locations, compare that with the planet
(star system) maps in the book, and take a straight vertical/straight
horizontal route to the planet you want.

Hope that helps.

Man-Kzin Wars collection (edited by Niven).  I\'m not sure who the author was,

presence in the story was most likely influenced by their discovery.  There
was an article in Scientific American about them, not too long ago.  They are
not frictionless, but low-friction, like the other things that have been

The PBEM is a strange undertaking, where about 40 current and former TML

Traveller. The game, originally run by Richard Johnson, is now
co-refereed by our own Mark Cook and metlay. While player slots in the
game are limited, listener slots are always open. For more answers to
specific questions, please write pbemref@engrg.uwo.ca, which is a mail

To my mind that means either:

A) prosthetic limbs that are indestinguishable to most observation.

	or

B) advanced prosthetic organs which are capable of replacing critical internal
organs.  I\'d guess that a prosthetic eye would be about TL 12.  It probably
won\'t look much like a normal eye, but at TL 13 a robotic eye would be
indestinguishable from a normal one.

Of course all these will be immediately detectable by a densiometer scan.

But I also remember that at TL 9 limb regeneration is possible, and at TL 12
they talk about regeneration of complex things like eyes.  So, to be frank,
I\'m not sure why the question of cyborgs come up.  If you want to have a new
limb, you can grow it just as easily as have one built for you.  There will be
people who want cybernetic stuff built into them, but that would be rather
more rare than the guy who lost an arm and wants it back.

Now, the cyborgs would then be cyborgs by CHOICE.  And depending on how
obvious the individual wants it to be, above TL 12 you\'ll need a densiometer
to pick them out.  Even at TL 12, if the addition is small and carefully kept
to be the same density as surrounding tissue, an implant might be VERY hard
to detect.  X-Ray?  Build it out of plastic.

To quote an ancient chinese saying "Where there are electronic counter
measures, there are electronic counter counter measures."  If you want your
implant hidden, you can make it hidden.  Then it would take a more advanced
sensor scan to pick it up.  Such scans probably exist, but they are not
normally in use.

It\'s like trying to hide a body pistol.  The higher the TL pistol, the higher
the TL sensors it\'s designed to fool. :-)

As to the question:  Can a cyborg pass for a robot?  Well, if he was designed
to do so, sure.  But who would wanna be designed that way?  To fool a
densiometer scan your insides would have to look like the insides of a robot.
That means massive replacement of your organs with cybergear.  Also, I\'d bet
your brain and it\'s massive support equipment will show up on a densiometer
scan.  I\'m not really sure how to address the question I\'m afraid.  Under what
circumstances would a cyborg wanna pass for a robot?
	----
Back to Pseudo-Bios.
I know zip about software programming.  Pascal and Basic are my limits.  I
can\'t address the difficulties of Programming these babies.  I\'d get jumped
real quick by the real computer jocks out there.  But, I\'d bet that at
differing tech levels, software engineers could handle the task with equal
ability, the main trouble is getting the hardware in shape to where a good
enough program can be run.

Quick look at brain design:
The education of a robot is effectively limited to how many storage units can
be stuffed in the robot.  Thus we can assume that given unlimited cash we can
build it to any education level we want.

Brain intelligence is limited though.  At TL 8 the max intelligence is
negative 3.  But at TL 9 we get parallel CPU components and the max
intelligence is then limited to Tech level minus 3.  Thus:
TL	Intelligence
9	6
10	7  etc. etc.

At TL 12 you can run Low Autonomous Programming and the cost of an intelligent
brain goes down.

So, I think that even a TL 9 brain is up to the task of fooling a person into
thinking it is an organic being under LIMITED circumstances.  (Hmm, how many
TMLers out there have actually met in the flesh... hmmmmmm? |->

So the problem is not so much the brain hardware, nor the software really.
But getting both to the point where the robot can act organic under more and
more circumstances.  Trying to fill in the gaps in the robot\'s conversation
that would not be there in a human.  Most humans have some sort of opinion on
every topic you can imagine (look at me and my big mouth!).  But if a robot
is mainly programmed for something like flying what happens when the question
of music comes up?  Then of course you could program it to be reticent on such
topics, but that\'s a cop out.  It is also a tactic that could be explioted.

The two types of TL are totally unrelated to each other.  If you don\'t do
MT, then explanations would be a waste of time.  Suffice it to say that
MT has a MUCH higher TL than 2300AD, except for the stutterwarp, which is
not part of MT, and which is a much better drive than MT\'s Jumpdrive.

Recently GDW came up with "Hard Times", which was an excuse to lower the TL
of the Imperium significantly.  In it they assumed that if civilization 
started to crumble, that 4000 year old technologies would be easier to
maintain than modern ones (ie that a world that has used grav exclusively
for 4000 years would find it easier to build new chemical rockets than to
build new grav generators).  So MT introduced chemical rockets for the poor
locals to use (and for the PCs to sneer at).

Talk is cheap, here\'s my two cents worth.

When it comes to "true" AI, existing programming models are insufficient
to the task. The challenge to explicit programming becomes far too
great, requiring the AIT to auto-program itself a result of life
experiences. AIs are likely to have a very different set of initial
experiences than humans, and would take a large amount of interaction to
recognize and categorize human interaction and mimic it. Of course, once
such a pattern is established in one piece of hardware, the
implementation can be cloned, with fairly convincing results.

I think part of the problem of choosing cyberware over regeneration could
be a simple matter of time.  In order to have a properly \'designed\'
regenerative part, whould suggest the involvement of sample DNA.  After a
sample is taken, then the limb or organ is grown from \'scratch\', which
would take some time.  While various biochemical accelerators could be
used to hasten the process, I think there would still be required, a
significant amount of time to grow the limb.

Then it has to be attached to your body, the chance of freak rejection
has to be eliminated, any shock to the body from re-attaching a significant
addition (in terms of blood supply, nervous system reactivation, etc),
and THEN thelong process of regaining meaningful use from the new part
begins, also moderately lengthy.

This is all wonderful, if you have the time and money.

But for the working Joe on a working Joe\'s wage, who needs a new arm pronto
or else he loses his ability to support himself, a prosthetic is a more
suitable answer.

Well, it would certainly be a matter of taste, but there is no end of
example amongst humanity, of people who just LOVE to alter there
appearance with things as simple as makeup, to bones, rivets, zippers,
pins and assorted other \'heavy metal\'.  So I\'m sure cybernetic eyes are
probably a trendy item somewhere, as would be a pump action shotgun
mounted in an artificial limb, if you happen to be an enforced for some
cheap mob in the gritty part of town \'Just About Anywhere\'.

Of course this doesn\'t become muchof a concern for many Trav Characters,
who are mostoften taken from the ranks of the elite armed forces or
similar services.  But I can certainly see many opportunities for
deep cover Scouts, serving as spies, where it would be of advantage to
have a body on the borderline...IE, one that could alternately pass as
Biological or Cybernetic, depending on the circumstances.

In a room full of robots, if the baddies are out to get you, you sure as
hell wanna match in with the rest of the \'bots!

I agree!  It\'s my feeling that those proponents of an intelligent machine
are too wrapped up in making it appear EXACTLY like a human.  Why not let
mechanical engineers solve the problem of an ambulatory machine with senses
that work at a level, good for simulating human senses first.

Once the little sucker can move around, then start programming.  It seems
to me that if you abandone the idea of trying to duplicate how human body
structure works, in a machine, then you can go on to invent a new series of
joints that are strong and flexible.  When that happens, THEN let\'s see
how we can apply these new dynamic joints to a human shaped bot.

After that, it should be a piece of cake!  [Hahahahahaha]

Magnetic Bearings (this might get a bit pedantic, so you may just
		   want to skim...we techno-weenies can to be a bit
		   much at times...)

Since you (well, one of you) asked, here is some more info on magnetic
bearings which are currently available.  The government owned
corporation in France which owns the rights to magnetic bearings is Le
Socie\'te\' Europe\'enne de Propusion (SEP).  A partnership between SEP
and SKF (the big Swedish bearing company) called Le Socie\'te\' de
Me\'canique Magne\'tique (S2M) manufactures the mag bearings for the
european market.  A partnership between S2M and Kollmorgen Corp (yes,
the same people who make periscopes) called Magnetic Bearing Inc (MBI)
manufactures mag bearings for the North American market.  <I used to
work for Kollmorgen, just in case anyone was wondering where my info
was coming from...>

I\'ve just dug through too many pages of technical manuals (in English
and French, and boy is my French ever rusty!!!) on mag bearings, and
have reduced a brain-frying amount of mechanical engineering down into
some simple statements and statistics.

A mag bearing is like a funky cross between an induction motor, an
eletromagnet and a PID controller.  The idea is to pick up a rotor in
a magnetic field.  No rotor is rigid really - even big shafts have
resonance modes, and bouncing modes, and bending modes...  If you\'ve
done any engineering mechanics, you\'re familiar with this sort of
behavior (and if you\'re not familiar, take my word for it please, or
curl up with your favorite physics book, followed by Fung or Shanes or
Den Hartog...)  So considering that the rotor wants to bend and bounce
and expand and flex and misbehave in general, the magnetic bearings
act on the rotor, pushing and pulling it with magnetic force to keep
it in a desired position.  The control on the mag flux is achieved
with an active ANALOG PID controller.  A digital controller is
apparently too slow, since the variable that\'s measured and acted on
to control the flux is current and there\'s a SQUARE relationship
between current and flux.  The current changes too fast for any
digital sampler to deal with - the aliasing problems are unreal!  So
the controller is a good old fashioned analog filter...awesome,
state-of-the-art 1930\'s technology...

In terms of force and power, it takes 8000 watts to get a bearing
force of 5 tons (english units) per bearing quadrant.  This means to
elevate and control a 20 ton shaft, you need 8000 x 5 watts ( four
radial bearing units and one thrust bearing) = 40000 watts.  All
things considered, in terms of power consumption, that\'s pretty cheap.
That\'s about the same amount of power as running 60 microwave ovens at
full power simultaneously...  Mind you, a set of the really big mag
bearings are to the tune of a million bucks american...  The RPMs
available to big shafts with mag bearings are in the low single
thousands (which may seem high to you mechanical types, but remember
that mag bearings allow a shaft to survive the passage through the
critical - the only limitation on the shaft rotation is the strength
of the material when subjected to centrifugal forces).

The itsy bitsy mag bearings, for specialty items like turbomolecular
pumps, small cryogenic compressors, neutron choppers (don\'t ask me
what it is - I\'m just quoting some S2M literature here) use up only a
little power - 120 watts per bearing quadrant for shafts less than a
kilo, But the RPMs are in the 100,000s!  A set of little mag bearings
is cheap - in the tens of thousands range of dollars.

(So you\'re probably all thinking that that\'s the last time you
encourage me to expound on something...  Sorry if I got pedantic - I
suffer from nerd attacks every now and then...  I can usually tell
when I\'m in the middle of an excessive nerd attack at my weekly
traveller game, since Jim the GM and everyone else is giving that long
suffering look again...  Life is so hard for us nerds...  I shoulda
listened to my Mom and gone to music school...)

Reagarding cybernetics, Scott posted:

> Well, if I remember right, there was an old medical technology TL 
> chart in The old DGP Grand Census.  

The old Travellers\' Digests issues 12, 13, and 14 have a three part
article called "Body Parts" I cannot remember seeing any other rules
on the subject (though if someone knows of some, please point me to
them).  I\'ve used these rules, and can say honestly, they were
difficult to decipher; but once my GM and I had figured out how to use
them, we came to the conclusion that these rules are workable though
they contain what we consider to be many unreasonable constraints,
principally in cost and in functionality.

> Now, the cyborgs would then be cyborgs by CHOICE. 

No, not necessarily (my opinion...).  Using the Digest article
mentioned above, you have to take a roll to suceed at getting your
regrown or cloned body part.  Sucess is not guarenteed, even at TL15.

We decided that there are probably good circumstances under which a
character will fail at regrowing or cloning new body parts.  Radiation
damage is one such circumstance, a degenerative neurological condition
would be another.  Uncooperative dice and a hard-nosed GM are
another...

Then there are the price considerations: prosthetics are cheap,
regrowns are next in price, bionics are more expensive, and cloned
parts are most expensive.  Not every portside bum is going to be able
to foot the bill for regrowns or bionics.  Only the very rich can
afford cloned parts.  You also have to find a doctor with the right
skills to carry out the appropriate procedure, and you must have the
time to go through the surgery and therapy.

I have a character currently in play who got shot up too many times
during character generation.  We used the info in Digest 13 to see
what sorts of parts my character got as replacements.  I\'ve been
running this character for a half a year now, and there are
improvements I would make to the rules presented in Digests 12, 13,
and 14.

First, the psychological impact of improved mechanical body parts is
not addressed well in the Digest article.  I would add a variety of
responses available to a character upon receiving artificial parts,
though I don\'t think I would include the "cyberpsycosis" from the
Cyberpunk games.  That sort of "bad attitude" is what makes the
cyberpunk games cyberpunk, and including it into Traveller is counter
to the flavor of the game as I\'ve always played it.  If I wanted to
cyber-out, I\'d go play cyberpunk, ok?  For adjustment problems, I
would include the self-esteem degradation mentioned in the article,
plus various stress related conditions from mild anxeity through
catatonia (as an extreme reaction to not being able to cope).  I\'d
also include some required furtive behavior, since there are parts of
space where people with artificial parts aren\'t welcome.  Remember, if
you look at the MT literature, cyborgs are property, not people in
Margret\'s corner of the universe...  And remember the SSMM?  I
wouldn\'t want to be standed on old Terra with too many prostetics
attached...

I would include an explaination for why there is a gap between
prostetics and bionics.  To my mind, there should be no gap, or an
obvious technological reason for the difference.  Working within the
rules, I have justified the difference by there being two different
technologies for replicating motion, and the bionic one must be more
compact and more efficient - how else to you account for the improved
strength and agility in the same volume?  But using that philosophy
has led me to the question of why aren\'t all pseudobio limbs of the
bionic variety.  If I were writting the rules, that\'s what I\'d do:
pseudobios must be of the bionic variety since the whole concept of
pseudobio presupposes customization.

I would also allow more than one gadget per limb, but I don\'t think
I\'d allow a person to become a walking weapons platform...buying
battledress makes much more sense to me.  Myself, I\'d much rather have
a date with a cyborg that looked like a person instead walking missile
rack, \'ya know...  

I confess I have swiped some of the gadgets from Cyberpunk for my
character.  I thought the cyberpunk pop-up flashlight hidden under a
fingernail was fun, so my character has one...  She is a rather
practical kinda gal after all.  I rejected the entire concept of
jacking in and out of a vast net-space - there are some old classic
traveller rules regarding human/computer interfacing and they always
seemed reasonable to me.  The interface is absurdly expensive
(probably articificially so), and also the withdrawal symptoms after
being disconnected were logical to me.  Traveller, after all, is about
good \'ol fashioned nuts\'n\'bolts space-hopping...if I wanted to go do
netrunning, I\'d go play cyberpunk, ok?

I never thought that I\'d ever consider writing Traveller oriented
cyborg rules, since I too was waiting around for the DGP volume on
Robots and Cyborgs...  Now I keep hearing that DGP has dropped MT
altogether.  Is this really true?  All of us in my traveller group
would like to know more about the details (we\'ve been lurking on this
list only since the beginning of March).

Kip is one month old now.  Development is flat.  MMU movements still randomised,
with occasional long periods of immobility--apparent patterned movements of 
01/25 have not been repeated.  Raisa wants to end the trial; she\'s itching to 
make some changes to the pattern-building nets. Karl argues that it\'s still much
too soon.  I agree; will continue trial until at least April.

2292/02/16 18.42
Progress at last.  Kip\'s collision frequency is down 20%, with a statistical 
reliability of 0.95.  Raisa and I are examining internal states to correlate 
with behaviour...

Dr. Hunt-Thomas reports that the experimental artificial intelligence KIP is 
showing excellent progress.  Its motor skills are rated equivalent to one-year 
development in humans.  There is no significant verbal development and no 
indication of comprehension at this date, but it is much too early for such to 
be expected.

Dr. Hunt-Thomas indicates progress is sufficiently intriguing that he will 
continue this trial indefinitely.

2292/09/28 01.45

We did it! Kip asked "Why?" today--Karl agrees that\'s the most convincing sign 
of intelligence he can think of.  Exhilarating, terrifying...my thoughts are 
muddled and I can\'t sleep.  It was barely nine months ago we started him up, and
already convincing curiosity.  It\'s hard to calculate equivalent subjective time
for him, but Karl rates it at six years of development in nine months. That\'s 
deceiving, though, because his progress has been accelerating. Where will he be 
at in another nine months?

It scares me, in a way. Half a dozen myths are floating through my head, and I\'m
sitting on the pointy end of all of them.  Opening Pandora\'s Box, stealing fire
from the Gods...I\'ve done it and now I have to figure out what I\'ve done.  I\'m 
reminded disturbingly of Victor Frankenstein.

And the other half of the fear is for Kip: what kind of place can he have in 
this world? There\'s no precedent. I\'ll do everything I can for him, and he\'ll 
still be alone in a way no human has ever been.

Welcome to the Frankenstein Project.  This will be a summer pbem, since I 
believe the Official TML MegaPBeM will be closing down for the summer, and I 
have the time to do stuff now.  Plus I have this idea I have to do SOMETHING 
with.


GAME SETTING

The game will be set in the universe of 2300AD.  The characters are making the 
first serious shot at creating an artificial intelligence.

The project is being conducted in a small spacehab--a converted geological 
survey outpost--because repeated experience has shown that such projects do best
in isolated incubation, because Zassenbach-Liouville wants to keep the project 
secret, and because they don\'t want to chance letting something get loose that 
they aren\'t prepared to deal with.  The characters will be the only ones aboard 
the hab.


TECHNICAL SPECS

I\'m going to try to steal all the best parts of the TML pbem, so this game will 
be fairly freeform as well, with all the significant characters run by players. 
(Excepting Kip. Kip is MINE.)  I am going to set an absolute limit of 12 
players--I\'m guessing that\'s enough to get a fairly dynamic game going, without 
overloading the ref any more than necessary.

I\'m going to try to compile regular turns, which hopefully can be smaller and 
more frequent than the TML pbem.

The game is set in 2300AD, but no knowledge of the game system will be required.


CHARACTERS

I\'m going to warn you all about this now.  As a ref I\'m going to be pretty 
strict about what kinds of characters I\'m going to allow in--some of you will 
have fairly narrowly-defined roles to fill.  My goal is to get a moderately 
coherent game set up from the beginning, to avoid the problems later.  Once the 
game is started, though, I\'ll let you do your thing.

The following positions will be filled. (While I have set names and genders for 
many of these characters, such details are of course negotiable.)

o  Dr. Kristophe Hunt-Thomas, Project Director.  
	One of the most brilliant scientists of his generation.  Holds 
	doctorates in computer science (intelligence systems), and 
	developmental psychology.  Driving force behind the project.

o  Julia Toronaga, Project Administrator.
	Responsible for Zassenbach-Liouville\'s interests; link between project
	and corporation.

Project Scientists (alphabetical order)

o  Dr. Karl Bach, Psychologist (Hab Medic)
o  Dr. Raisa Kolmov, Software
o  Dr. Bellin Steiner, Robotics/Manipulator systems
o  Dr. Tor Wilson, Chip development/Software

Technicians

o  Tally Killebrae, Photonics
o  Kirby Wallace, Robotics/Machinist

Station Staff

o  Engineer (Station maintenance)
o  Assistant Engineer
o  Hydroponics/Life Systems Tech
o  Security Officer

The project scientists and technicians were chosen from among the best 
available.  Note also that the less glamourous station staff could prove 
tremendously important in the adventure if things don\'t go well.


APPLICATIONS

In principle, all you need to do is send me a note saying you\'re interested.  
However, if I get more than twelve expressions of interest, I\'ll be trying to 
select the best players, rather than just the quickest on the <r> key.  If I 
haven\'t seen your work in the TML PBeM (or if you\'re Aslan or Ring-natives that 
I haven\'t seen much of), samples of your best writing are encouraged.

Also, many of the characters are research scientists, and I would hope their 
players will be able to write thoughtfully on the subject.  If you want one of 
those roles, try to show you have something to say.  This is SF, after all.


DEADLINE

If you\'re interested, I want to know about it by FRIDAY, MAY 1, 1992. I will be 
out of town for much of the time between now and then, so don\'t be concerned if 
I\'m not replying to your messages.


DISCLAIMER

The fact that I\'m offering to start up a pbem is clear proof of my insanity, so 
don\'t say I didn\'t warn you.

Funny you should mention 2300... it\'s been sort of the thing I\'ve been
fiddling with the most lately.  After finals are over, I should have time
to send in my collection of 2300 ship designs (and sc template), as well
as the "2301 Star Cruiser" supplement I\'ve been working on.  Basically,
it consists of the following changes to 2300 Star Cruiser:

  1. The optional damage multiplier rule from _Invasion_ is *not*
     optional.  Actually, we\'ve been playing it that way all along;
     I was surprised to see it presented as an optional rule.  I 
     thought that they had just made an error in the original rules,
     since the Martel is supposed to have an armor factor of 10....

  2. The speed of light is enforced.  It takes 2 seconds for a signal to
     travel one hex, and another 2 seconds per hex for a reply.  Distant
     ships appear to be in the hexes they occupied at times in the past,
     this is enforced by a referee or with plotting.  Negative modifiers
     apply to "to hit" chances based on how old the information used in
     firing is.  The negative modifiers are reduced somewhat by remote
     operator skill, which now works somewhat differently.

  3. Optics, scanners, and fire control systems may be used as contigency
     search sensors.  They have an active or passive sensor value of 0,
     always require a roll to detect, may only attempt to detect targets
     already detected by some other friendly unit, and may only detect
     or maintain detection on one target each.  This was added to prevent
     remote objects with no sensors (i.e. the Ritage-2) from becoming 
     worthless due to the speed of light rule.

  4. Remote objects may be programmed (by writing a plot), and can follow
     simple programs without tying up a communicator channel.  Remote 
     objects with sensors may be programmed to do things relative to 
     sensor contacts that they are maintaining (i.e. "close with target 
     1").  Attacks made without a human operator suffer the usual penalty.
     When a remote object runs off the end of its plot, it goes to all stop.

  5. Computer hits on human ships are localized.  When a computer critical
     is rolled, roll on the damage table again, treating hull as critical,
     damage control as surface fixture, and continuing as power plant.  The
     resulting system becomes inoperable until the hit is repaired; if the
     second roll is computer, it acts like an old computer hit.  Kafer ships
     have centralized data processing facilities, and use the old rule.

  6. Speed is a function of local gravitation.  A formula is given for
     "tunnel length" as a function of the local gravitational field;
     The tunnel length factor varies from 1 in the maximum gravity in
     which stutterwarp operation is possible to (365*30) in interstellar
     space; it\'s generally about 2 or so in the life zones of main
     sequence stars.  Negative modifiers apply when shooting at ships
     moving at very high speeds.

  7. Long range detection is defined.  Rules are presented for determining
     when a ship is aware that *something* is out there, and maximum ranges
     are given for detecting ships that illuminate their active sensors.

  8. Rules for nuclear weapons are presented.  They are only useful against
     ships in orbit or at "all stop", or ships with low warp efficiencies
     in gravitational fields with low tunneling lengths.

>Also... could someone explain me what the TL\'s stand for. In particuraly
>what\'s Megatraveller TL and 2300ad TL (begining of star exploration, Stutter
>drive)

MT and 2300 are not the same universe.  This used to be somewhat more 
confusing when the game was marketed as Traveller:2300....

>(are gravitics range sensitive????)

Yes, which is why there are thrusters.

Now, a question: I have the old Traveller:2300 rules.  What\'s different
(other than the fix to the way armor works presented in the Kafer modules)
about 2300AD?  Are there any substantive changes to the game, or did 
they just clean up the *atrocious* way they organized the Traveller:2300
rulebooks?

I have a few queries about (well starship combat I guess), 

1) It seems that the chance to use passive scanners is equal to use
active scanners . Whats the point of this if the active scanners give your
position away ???? . Why not simply increase the chance to use passives
by one level . 

2) Starship movement ???? The book says manuever drive affects the spend at 
which a vessel can move . ie moving at speed 5, a manuever 3 can either
slow down to 2, or speed up to 8 . Okay thast clear, but how did a manuever
ship get up to speed 5 anyway (The book doesnt mention anythin about constant
acceleration (Well I couldnt find it)) . 

3) Agility or Pilot . Thats a bit harsjh, I allow the pilots to add their
skill to the agility . (I mean han solo, his ship had an agility of at least
5, and he himself a pilot skill of at least 5 also) . If you look at it this
way, 2 fighters have agl 6 each, this means they are perfectly matched,
skill really doesnt come into it (unless they are at level 7) . But I also
let the pilot add his skill to the chance to hit . This simulates a pilot
attempting to out manuver the other and place his vessel in a better 
firing position . 

4) Computer or Gunnery . Again a bit harsh, considering all the big naval 
vessels carry gunners (I mean some of these ships have computers - 9), I
again, let the gunner add his skill to the computer rank . 

5) I had a player come up to a disabled corsair in a gig, armed with a 
laser turret, fire point blank rank at the vessels bridge, well I said 
the shot totally wasted it, what are other people views . 

6) Also the same pilot attempted to shoot a G-Carrier escaping from the 
vessel . What are the rules for starship vs vehicle ?????

Someone was I believe going to totally refine the system for 30 second
turns, in 15 km squares .......... I was wondering if they have
a finished copy (or notes) could they please email it to me ???? (That is
if it is no bother .....)

7) Oh yeah, With ranges, do you subtract the number of hexes away craft are
for the range DM\'s ?????

8) Any idea what the rewards are for taking out a corsair (inhabited system)
, I said 250,000 Cr (Was it too much, too little) ????

9) Finally In starship combat, A fuel leak, is it only 1 Ton, once, one
a round, and does this affect ships performance (jumping, manuevering) etc

I Think thats about it ........

Please any comments at all (no matter how big or how small), please
either email (or post) .

Differences between Traveller:2300 and 2300AD...
 
Hmmm...
 
More information about the aliens.  All the little changes made during
the Modules published between one and the other (which is mostly
trivial).  Addition of rules for skill improvement.  Re-arrangement
into a rational rules-set.  Task level changes: Simple from 3+ to 2+.
Routine from 7+ to 6+, and so on...  Characteristic mods to tasks are
now characteristic divided by 4 (drop fractions), instead of 5 (drop
fractions.
 
I guess that sums it up...
 
Later...

	While some will find this system abusive, I don\'t see any problems 
with it. BTW, the _Millenium Falcon_ isn\'t that maneuverable itself -- it
probably wouldn\'t be higher than agility 2-3. It\'s main drive advantage is
that it is very fast in hyperspace -- twice as fast as other ships. (I have
Star Wars: the RPG). While in \'real\' space combat, the distances and times
involved would most likely make the machine more important than the pilot, but
that is hardly exciting for PCs. I prefer to run my space combats more \'Star
Warsish\' -- not very realistic, but its pretty fun

>4) Computer or Gunnery . Again a bit harsh, considering all the big naval

	Makes sense. See above.

>laser turret, fire point blank rank at the vessels bridge, well I said

	If \'wasted\' means \'destroyed completely\', then no, I would say the
result was a bit extreme. Missile turret, yes; laser turret, no.

I collect the rules, but haven\'t played much.

Tech levels are a mechanic from Megatraveller, which incorporates many 
societies at all levels of sophistication. Well, ok, not ALL, but you 
get the idea.

2300 can\'t be easily rated, because it occupies a different universe, 
with different mechanics.  No gravitics, different aliens, and in particular, 
a completely different mumbo-box that gets you from one star system to the 
next. (And IMHO, a much more interesting one.)

This varies strongly based on what the ref will let you get away with.
The cybernetic guidance systems that Richard tacitly approved for the
weapons \'Vouf uses in the PBEM were scaled down by a huge amount when
Mark and I took over. 

> BTW To the person who is (or was?) playing \'Vouf in the PBEM,

I couldn\'t run them if I didn\'t. The gloves themselves, as run in
the PBEM, are one-of-a-kind works of art, and require no particular
rules underpinning. Mark relies on me not to go any further overboard
with them than I have already, and I should point out that they carry
strong negative points as well-- until recently, \'Vouf was physically
dependent on the gloves, and the rest of the party can only guess at
the psychological love/hate relationship he has with them even now....

Rob Dean and I have toyed with putting together a rules system for them
for publication in CHALLENGE, and that has (along with my article on 
nonlethal weapons cowritten with Hans Rancke-Madsen) stalled due to my
work commitments. I do hope to finish both eventually, with their help
and that of Mark Cook, who has also consulted with me on these matters.

}Possibly there is an issue of why a robot would want to
}pass as a human.  It\'s the civil rights issue.  "When is X sentient?"
}"Wehn is Y _sapient_?"

Well, depending on your views, the question might be better phrased as why
would the designters of a robot want it to pass for human.  And in the
traveller universe full of guns, starships, intrigue etc.  I think the answer
to THAT one is obvious.

If on the other hand, the robot is sufficiently sophisticated to WANT anything,
It is above the common tech levels of traveller.  Artificial Intelligence with
wants/needs/desires is tech level Seventeen.  Not a common problem to deal
with.

As to the question of civil rights, It would completely depend on the local
culture I\'m afraid.  In the Solomani rim, forget it!  What I\'m after is more
a role playing example for robots of differing tech levels.  After all, a
player could choose to play his TL 21 artificial intelligent pseudo-bio robot
as a very wooden version of Mr. Data, and another player might choose to play
his TL 12 pseudo-bio robot as a perfectly normal human being.  How do you know
what to act like?

}Well that gets us to, .. why not just do it virtually and let an automaton
}take all the risks?  If we can build an automaton that\'s capable of holding
}my awareness well enough without being sentient in and of itself...

Jacking into a system, I have always thought of as TL-13 technology.  There
are rules for doing it @ TL15, but that was for a specific implant that was
highly mobile and you could access a computer remotely.  I would imagine that
TL 13 would allow you to control a robot-body from a specially designed
console.  Ok, so the controlled body won\'t be sentient, but you could pick up
the sensations from it easily enough.  Of course at TL 13 that would require
that you have a bunch of stuff installed into your head that you mightn\'t want
there, it might be dangerous, but it might be possible.  I seem to remember
reading a story a long time ago about exploring Jupiter, not from a robot body,
but a genetically engineered body.  It was using a radio link bettween the
operator in a satellite and the body on the \'surface\'.  (Yeah it was an old
story when Jupiter still had a \'Surface\'.)

As to Cyborg stuff:
Regrown/cloned/prosthetic/bionic
I would imagine that most insurance would cover the regrowing of limbs.  If it
is the cheapest option, I\'d guess it would be workable.  After all, most
insurance has clauses about loss of limbs included in life insurance, and most
companies provide employees w/ such insurance now.  But for the cases of
people who can\'t get regrown through wierdness and die rolls, then the
insurance would have to try to replace the limb somehow.  Prosthetic or
whatever.  The ones who will be outta luck are those w/out insurance or those
who get hit by those without insurance.  I seem to remember my life insurance
has a lot of money riding on my arms, legs, eyes and ears.

But, I don\'t see prosthetics being all that easier to have than bionics,
clones, regrowns or whatever.  After all, as it is now, Prosthetic limbs ARE
custom made.  After all, how many people have their limbs severed in exactly
the same way?  It\'s not like a shoe store!
	"Hey Bob?  Looks like this guy\'s gonna need a size six left arm...
Check in the back ok?"

As for cyber/prosthetic psychosis, Well, how many of the handicapped go through
psychosis when they are fitted with an artificial leg now?  I\'m afraid I
haven\'t met many of people who are missing limbs, but they\'re pretty normal.
(except that they actually LIKE the new Star Trek! :-P )

And with the option of regrown, I don\'t see where the army of cyborgs we\'ve
been hearing about lately is coming from.  How many people out there are gonna
have artificial parts?  My guess is not many  (apart from the odd cultures and
botched medical cases.)  Wouldn\'t it be easier to get a TL9 regrown arm than
a TL 12 bionic arm?

    'body' => 'When I was wondering through my collection of archive material (The stuff
I managed to get before my uni restricted out of campus FTP and Telnet .)
I saw a for posts from people talking about the high cost of free traders
and how they are not economically viable . I am not sure about the outcome 
of these discussions but here are some ideas I was mussing about with .....

1) Starship Commerce can really be viable by large corporations . Those
are the only people whop can really afford starships and to keep them up . 
This is not a new idea, in fact I guess fairly standard . But what of the
poor honest free trader . Well in order to explain the existance of free
traders, you must realize they are the exception not the rule . 

Most starship travel and cargo hauling would be undertaken by corporations . 
They could offer guaranteed services, large tax rebates could ensure that 
the vessels were in top condition, they have a high access to security etc . 

I mean as a small time business who had to transport your precious commod-
ities who would you trust ? The cleaming Tukera lines or some battered
old free trader run by captain ahab who has a wooden leg . 

So how do free traders fit into it . Well yes they are rare, they pick up
the more unprofitable cargos or run the speculative markets, or get the
smaller, luctrative cargos . 

Back to the old character generation, a merchant character gets his hands 
on a starship (Including most of the time the coorporation captains) . But
this is for the characters, not for the general populace . The average 
coorporation captain will retire to a life of ease when he leaves the 
merchant service . The reason why players get starships is becuase the
whole point of the game is adventure on the "High Seas" . It would be
rare for an ex corp captian to buy a vessel, and this rare captain would 
be a player . (I mean whats the point in generating a merchant captain to
go and live a life of ease straight afterwards : Ref "What does your
character do ?", Player "Oh I dunno, hang around the jukuzzi") . 

Where do these players get the starships from ???? Well for coorporation
captains thats easy . The average coorporation has to update its 
equipment regualry, this makes good business sense . What does the corp
do with this mothballed freighter, sells it to one of its former employees
(It would not be scared of compedition from its former employee cause the
new owner simply just would not matter (His vessel is very "small fry")) .

Free Traders get their vessels from say a fellow free trader whose retiring,
a bankrupt orgainization, etc . 

The payments are large for paying of a vessel agreed, BUT those people
want to be merhants they didnt get talked into it . The corp captains
could be in it because they want to be independant . 

The intestellar markets are geared up (So I think) for corporations
running the space lanes . The free traders are the independants struggling
to make a living off the "crumbs" the bigger fish dont worry about . But
the intestellar markets can keep a free trader (providing he makes the right
decisions (Sorry for the "He" all the time, its to save effort, not cause
I\'m sexist)) above water, or very wealthy . 

The bank repayments are large on a free trader (About 175,000/Month),
but remember banks, as they are today, are geared up to make their money
off the big companies . Compare interest rates today, something like 13%
for the average small business, and 20% for the corp) . A bank lending
money to an independant is risking it . Space travel is hazardous, money
consuming, and stressful . There is a very good chance they will not see
their money again . Consequently the large interest rates, high repayments .
(I mean theres none of this just having to pay the interest each year) . 

Why become a free trader . Throughout history people admire the underdog, 
and people want independance . Having to rely on others or work for others
is not as good as relying on yourself, or working for yourself . 

The Free Traders are a very hardy and select breed . There is no grey areas
in the free traders, you either survive or you dont, those who do, 
successfully prosper in the dog eat dog enviroment of merchantile space . 
These people are reveared, admired . They have adventures beyond comparison
(well to the average planet bound factory worker) . There is a definite
romantic appeal to the free trader . Also free traders (the really good ones)
can survive and prosper, just like any profession with high risk, and 
possible high gain, there will always be someone working in it . 

I hope this helps accept the high cost and running of independant 
merchant vessels, and the rather large repayments due . It helps to 
remember though that in merhantile space, a free trader is an exception,
not the rule, but the free traders that exist, are exceptional .

remember which) and is not in complete agreement with the female
modifiers above.


Note on carrer: a character that chooses a carrer with a high physical
component (sports, military, etc) may use starting experience to rise
his/her strengh with the following cost: Given the value of (Str-Size),
below 0 costs one point to rise one str value; from 0 to +1 2 points, and
from +1 to +2, 3 points;  Above this value Str can only be raised by
deploying as many experince points as the wanted value.



Natural Advantages
Roll 1d6 for number of advantages/disavantages.  Roll d% for each: if the
roll doesn\'t result in a valid number ignore (don\'t throw again!).  
For variable bonus/penalty roll 1d6 and see table below.  Higher bonus may
be 
allowed if the character is going to role play them correctly.  Use of 
experience can also be allowed to raise bonus or lower
penalties: treat as unrelated (or worse).
I don\'t usually let the players know their bonus or penalties at
first, unless they are obvious.


1d6
1-3  +1
4,5  +2
6    +3 


Physical bonus:
1 Ambidextry
2 Acute Smell (variable)
3 Double jointed (bonus to escape control, climb, use dex; variable)
4 Voice (bonus to any activity involving speech; variable)

Psychologycal bonus:
20   Absolute Direction (variable)
21,22     Absolute Timing (variable)
23   Alertness (bonus to sense/see/hear something; variable)
24   Animal Empathy (variable)
25   Empathy (variable)
26   Danger Sense (sometimes the character feels that is in danger; var)
27   Eidetic Memory (facility to remember what you hear/see; variable)
28   Lightning Calculator
29   Psionic Ability, unfocused (see notes)

Other:
40-42     Wealth (variable; the base chance should be modified for
geagraphy)
43   Patron

Physical penalties:
50   Color Blindness
51   Lame/Permanent Wound (use hit location/potencial wound)
52   No Sense of Smell/Taste (osmonia)
53   Mute
54   Stuttering
55   Deaf
56   Blind
57   Voice (negative equivalent to voice advantage; variable)

Psychological penalties:
70   Addictivness (variable)
71   Dyslexia (skills involving reading/writting is seriously affected)
72   Phobia (var: 1,2=mild; 3=severe; GURPS page 35)
73   Bad Memory (variable)
74   Lack of numerical ability (skills involving maths is affected; var)

Other:
90-92     Poverty (variable)
93   Social Stigma (variable; this usually applies in only one culture)
84-88     Dependents (family, etc)


Notes: 
A character with some of the above penalties should be allowed to
correct them (medically, by proteses, etc, as for poor sight or hearing)
Empathy, Animal Empathy, Danger Sense and alertness are all forms of
inate psionic abilities.  I don\'t use psionics (at least not so
far) but I think these add a little spice to the game.

(well... I believe that at least, the system for chosing these
bonus/penalties is original)

Carefull Aiming
Sniper delays initiative level by 1 and stays unmovable for this
initiative call and the one he shoots in;  add 1 to the roll on the Aimed
Fire Task for Sidearms and 2 for rifles and weapons fixed on mounts.

Hasty Attack
The firer can attemp to attack one initiative level sooner but receives
the penalty of one difficulty level (40%).  This can be regarded as
equivalent to an hasty task.

To Hit Special Location: roll on hit location table and sum/subtract the
numbers on this table to close in on the desired location:

Range       Location Mod              Hit Chance Mod
Close       3+Marksmanship            Head          -3
Effective   1+Marksmanship            Upper Torso   -2
Long        Marksmanship              Hand/Foot     -2
Extreme     No Effect                 Arm/Leg       -1
            
Shooting Blind: treat shot at two difficulty levels higher.  Can hit
anyone in targeted area.

Fumble on Hit Roll: a fumble happens when a natural 1 is rolled for and
attack.  Consequence is (simple rule) any one random figure in the line
of fire is hit or (second rule) roll on table below.  If weapon is jammed
the user can make one unjamming roll each action.

Fumble Effects, 1d10                               
     1   no effect
2 -  8   hit a random figure in line of fire.
9 - 10   weapon is jammed: roll 6+ on 1d10 to unjam
    11   weapon is inoperational: MQ-DAM = 0
    12+  -1 at roll of 12, -2 at 13, etc.
Notes:  Add damage points and subtract user skill on the weapon.
Aplly these mods for unjamming also.

NOTE!!!: this last table refers to MQ (mechanical quality) and DAM (damage).
I don\'t have these rules in English but I\'ll post them as soon as possible.

:Talk is cheap, here\'s my two cents worth.
I\'ll be happy to philosophise for you.

I\'ll only mildly disagree with James.  I suspect that it is _almost_
within the skill of TL8 programming to create an AI that is concerto
qualified.  Of course it would do nothing else.  I assert it\'s more a 
matter of hardware than software at this point.  We can do anything,
given enough code.  :=)

Actually, my view of machine intelligence is that when it arrives,
it will in no way mimic human intelligence.  Well, maybe superficially.
After all, the robot - Si creature that it is, rugged, semi-immortal,
with different sensor apparatus, has about as much in common with us 
as does the fruit fly.

Anyone can offer guaranteed services.  And the only tax breaks you see
in the Imperium are the "subsidized merchants", not the Megacorps.

Neither.  I would trust a gleaming free trader run by an ex-Oberlindes
man.  Incidently, why should free traders be "battered"?  Some of them
(most of them, from the character generation table) are brand new
ships.
 
 
>So how do free traders fit into it.  Well yes they are rare, they

Nonsense.  If they get the "more unprofitable" cargos, they\'ll go
broke.  And most people seem to agree that the speculative market is
most of the interstellar shipping there is.  It\'s also the most
profitable.

Hmmm...
This ignores the detail that it costs about KCr30 per year to "live a
life of ease".  And the average pension for those merchant characters
is about KCr12.  Which is about enough to live a social status 4. 
Which I suspect is far from a "life of ease".  Most of those merchant
captains (in our game) buy a ship because they retire at 42 (or so),
and have 50-100 years left in their life and don\'t choose to spend it
living in squalor somewhere.

This is almost reasonable.  Of course if they sell all their
mothballed freighters that way, then they are creating quite a lot of
competition for themselves.

Then why are they mostly brand new?  At least you pay new prices for
them.

The payments are too large to achieve breakeven.  And I always assume
that these guys want to be merchants to make money, not to lose it.

You have to be wealthy just to buy a ship (MCr7+ down payment on a
free trader).  Most wealthy people don\'t get that way by investing in
things that lose money.  And if my use of the word "guys" bothers
anyone, please do a Find and Replace to change "guys" to "entities". 
Thank you.

Interesting.  My calculations show that starship loans run 5.575%
annual interest.  Hardly back-breaking.  And, last time I looked, big
corporations usually pay LESS interest than little guys.  Last time I
tried to get a loan, the Prime Interest Rate was 11%, but the bank
wanted 17% from me.  If the loans are riskier, you usually charge MORE
interest, not less.
 
>Why become a free trader . Throughout history people admire the
>underdog, and people want independance . Having to rely on others or

I dispute the "underdog" notion.  But being independent is something
many people strive for.  But buying a starship that MAY make money, if
you are lucky, isn\'t the way to achieve independence.  Buying a
starship that makes money hand over fist is.  Or dropping MCr6 of the
down payment into a bank at 3%, and buying a Travellers\' Aid Society
membership with the other MCr1 is a good way to achieve independence.

Well, if most free traders are merchant captains who want out of the
rat race, then THEY aren\'t affected by the romantic appeal.  And the
average factory worker (even the exceptional one) is unlikely to see
the MCr7+ required to get into the business.  But there will certainly
be people who want to do it, just to prove that they can  beat the
odds.

No, it doesn\'t.  Starships are still too expensive.  Remember, most of
the discussion about the costs of those ships doesn\'t include mention
of ownership.  A free trader (type A) owned by Tukera STILL won\'t make
any money.

But the point about free traders being the exception, rather than the rule,
is a good one.

Strange offer fer ya:
In prepping for the PBEM and all things Trav and Travellerish,
I\'ve been doin\' a little research on wolf behavior in the wild:
trying to get a better handle on role-playing Vargr by looking
at the social interaction of their ancestors.  Admittedly, the
behavior would be about as relavent as looking at humans by
reading about apes, but it is a starting point...

Anyway, a friend of mine sent me a rather long file on Lupine
behavior.  It\'s got some interesting little tid bits in it,
I think it will be useful for *me*.  But it has little to do
with Traveller.  Therefore, not *quite* appropriate to the TML.
It is also rather long.  So, if you want it, I will send it to
you.  I suppose, if their is enough responce I can send it on
to the list, but if not I\'ll send it to ya\'ll individually.

Sounds cool, but what would *that* be like?  What would it think like?
I\'d guess it would mostly depend on who built it and for what purpose it
was designed.  And for the moment, in traveller, we are supposing that
the robots are built by the known traveller races.  These races will build
bots with purposes in mind, specific to their own percieved needs.  That is
gonna limit how alien the bot is in relation to it\'s creators.  Building
an intelligence that you can\'t use might be an interesting experiment, but
not one with much practical application.

But, also, AI is *supposed* to be TL 17.  So will it REALLY take 9 tech
levels from now to get a true AI?  I doubt it.  Does anybody else out there
bemoan the downgrading of TL16?  I seem to remember that TL 16 was supposed
to be the \'magic\' level when they quoted A.C. Clarke in Supp 3 Spinward
Marches.  Now it seems that the Darrians weren\'t really that great after all!
I don\'t know how their TL 16 fleet is supposed to have survived the thousand
years or so it\'s been sitting around dormant!?   Seems to me all their TL 16
gadgets would have broken down LONG ago.  Making them essentually TL 13!

    I tend to agree with you, especially at high stellar TLs.  With the 
ability to regrow everything in prime condition, I have defined TL 14/15
medical as being able to "put you back together if there are enough large
pieces left", the tricky part being the brain, of course.  They can even
regrow your brain, but if there isn\'t enuff left, no memories.  (Not until
someone perfects memory recording & transfer at TL17 or so.  Of course,
at "lower" TLs like 15 we have the possibility of taking a blank mind and
building an artificial personality on it...kind of like an organic robot.
I can imagine some unpleasant possibilities for some of the more fascist
governments out there...)  In a Hi Stellar society, a cyborg, or a cripple
(handicapped person, physically challenged -- pick yer fave PC word) is,
frankly, a freak.  Something almost never seen, and subject to a lot of 
attention and stares.   Kind of like the old folks in Logan\'s Run.
    On the other hand, at lower tech levels, if robotics technology runs 
ahead of medical tech on a particular world, it may be easier to use cyber-
netic replacements than to regrow/transplant natural parts.  This is 
uncommon, but far from impossible; one route for cyborgs, if you want them.
Other fun possibilities: at pre/early stellar TLs, they may have perfected
transplants -- but they may have a shortage of voluntary donors.  Organ-
legging for fun and profit, heh, heh.  (SF Historical note: it was not a
cyberpunk author who invented organlegging.  It was another, non-cyber-
punk-type author who came up with the idea of implanting electronics in
your skull so your brain could talk directly to the computer. Anybody 
else remember who these mystery authors were?)  
    And then there are the aforementioned odd cultures where robotics and
medicine have progressed hand-in-hand, where people use machine tools to
extend their brains and bodies in a more intimate fashion than most.  
Places where people choose to have cyberware plugged into their brains,
and body parts replaced with enhanced cybernetic parts.  Efate is one
such place (in my universe).  Note that at Efate\'s medical TL, no cyber-
modification is irreversible; you get tired of bionic eyes, have \'em 
removed and real ones regrown.  It just takes time and money.  Of course,
most of Efate\'s neighbors, and most spacers think Efate is just plain
weird, if not unnatural.

> But what of the
>poor honest free trader .   <stuff omitted>
        First, let\'s correct this delusion that free traders are poor.  
Anyone hauling around MCr 4 to MCr 60 in assets (depending on his equity)
is not poor; said anyone could sell off his interest in the ship and 
retire as a multi-millionaire.  
 
>I mean as a small time business who had to transport your precious commod-
>ities who would you trust ? The cleaming Tukera lines or some battered
>old free trader run by captain ahab who has a wooden leg . 
        Well, in the REAL world, Capt Ahab is charging much LOWER PRICES 
than gleaming Tukera lines to haul your commodities, so you insure your
commodities for much less than what you save by shipping with Capt Ahab
for say, a year, and take the risk.  Of course, in the Imperium, where
megacorp interests are carefully protected by Imperial law, you have these
FIXED shipping rates that kill the small hauler...  He can\'t discount
when his costs are cheaper than the big boys, and he can\'t raise his prices
when they\'re higher.  Wait until Hard Times hits my PBEM; Imperial price
regs will go out the window.
 
>So how do free traders fit into it . Well yes they are rare, they pick up
>the more unprofitable cargos or run the speculative markets, or get the
>smaller, luctrative cargos . 
        My assumptions: lucrative routes (like Efate-Louzy, Rhylanor-
Porozlo) have much of the commodities hauling locked up in semi-
permanent contracts.  Since those routes are profitable year-in and year-
out, and the markets are constant, somebody on planet A makes widgets 
specifically for export to planet B; he contracts with shipper C to haul
widgets from A to B and sell them on B, for the next 1-20 years.  Either
that, or he contracts to sell his widgets to trading company D, who hauls 
them on his own ships to planet B and sells them.  Since the market is 
fairly constant, and constantly profitable, and the price of interstellar
transport won\'t change (fixed by law), company A will stick with the same
shipper C or trader D as long as they are willing to haul from A to B.
C or D has a guaranteed income for as long as the contract lasts, A has
a guaranteed buyer, and B has a guaranteed source of A-widgets.  Thus, 
most profitable commodities tradable between A & B will be locked up in
long-term contracts.  Note that shipper C or trader D need not necessarily
be a megacorp or other huge company; they just have to have been in the
right place at the right time to negotiate a contract, and be able to
maintain a regular schedule.  C or D can be one free trader; what it can\'t
be is a tramp freighter.  Most PCs own tramp freighters -- i.e., they
don\'t want to do the safe Rhylanor-Porozlo run 25 times a year for 40 
years, they want to wander a bit.  At least, I hope they do.
        So what do "tramp" free traders do?  They pick up "spot" cargoes;
those cargoes available because the regular carrier couldn\'t take them
for some reason, because they\'re a new product or one not normally exported
or for some other reason aren\'t exported regularly enuff to be the
subject of a contract.  BTW, there\'s nothing to stop PC-owned ships from
operating a regular route, and picking up some of those lucrative
contracts;
the March Harrier in the Traveller Adventure is an example of a ship on
a regular route (a subsidized merchant, in fact) whose crew finds adventure
where they go... of course, one of the rewards of the adventure is getting
your subsidy contract paid off so you don\'t have to stick to that fixed
route...
 
>(I mean whats the point in generating a merchant captain to

        So who built the free trader in the first place?? Those little

        No, they\'re not.  Run some numbers thru a calculator and find out

million at real-world rates...
 
>Compare interest rates today, something like 13%
>for the average small business, and 20% for the corp) . 
        Maybe in Australia.  In the U.S., big corps get their loans at
the Prime Rate, which is significantly  lower than what Joe
SmallBusinessman
gets from his town bank.
 
>their money again . Consequently the large interest rates, high repayments
 .
>(I mean theres none of this just having to pay the interest each year) . 
        Large interest rates??  A standard starship loan is about 5%
annual interest!  What kind of interest rates do they charge Down Under?
And don\'t forget the rather hefty collateral represented by a starship;
one can leverage VERY large loans based on that... or should be able to,
if your GM\'s running things anything like the real world.
 
>Why become a free trader . Throughout history people admire the underdog, 
        Because, if you can come up with the seed money, you can get

        I do agree with you that the cost of a building a merchant vessel
is too high for the picture Traveller paints of the independant mercantile
community, but I don\'t feel like going into that whole can of worms again.

For those of you who haven\'t been watching it, there\'s a *WONDERFUL*
5-part series, sponsored in part by the ACM (that\'s the Association

being shown on PBS TV called "The Machine that Changed the World".  As
you may have guessed by the title, the subject is digital computers.  It
just so happens that this weeks episode (entitled "The Thinking Machine")
was about the attempts (and failures) to develop a true machine intelligence.
Specifically, one that could pass the Turing Test.  (If you don\'t know
what that is, drop me a line and I\'ll explain it.)

According to current experts in the field, hardware *is* the limiting
factor.  As early as the late-50s, there were experiments (mostly conducted
by the U.S. Army) attempting to create artificial intelligence.  Later,
in the 60s, there were numerous attempts in the private sector.

They all failed.  By 1980, with one exception, they were all terminated.
The only experiment still currently underway is the \'Cyke\' (for
\'Encyclopedia\') Project in Texas.  They\'ve been constructing their
database for over ten years and they maintain that they\'ve still got
a long ways to go.

The problem is that for years, experts insisted that you didn\'t have to
model the brain (hardware).  All you had to do was successfully model
the \'mind\' (software).  The trouble is, they haven\'t been able to figure
out exactly how a human brain programs itself as a person grows up.

The cloest anyone has come to success falls into two catagories: expert
systems and neural networks.

Expert systems can be developed on conventional computer hardware, and
are remarkably successful, but they\'re confined to a single, narrowly
defined area of expertise.  Outside that area, they\'re useless.  To be
a true AI is to be able to cope with *any* subject intelligently (but
not necessarily expertly).  Even the ability to gracefully admit ignorance,
in what appears to be a sentient fashion, is currently beyond the scope
of even the most ambitious AI yet constructed.

Neural networks, on the other hand, are not so much programmed, as they
are \'taught\', using methods very similar to teaching a person.  There
are three main problems with them.  Number one, they can\'t be built
complex enough yet to come even close to storing the number of experiences
that a human brain can hold.  Number two, even the researchers that build
them aren\'t exactly sure how they \'learn\' the lessons they are taught.
And that leads directly to problem number three.  Since it isn\'t clear
how a neural network \'learns\', it hard to tell exactly *WHAT* it\'s
learning.  It may not be what you think.  Here\'s a real example.

In the early 1960s, the U.S. Army decided to build an AI (primitive
neural network) which could do high speed tactical recon photo analysis.
The goal was to have the AI rapidly identify enemy tanks in aerial
photos.  To do this, the Army took over 2,000 aerial photos, all of
outdoor scenes (forested, open fields, and combinations thereof).
Half of the photos contained one or more tanks (some in plain sight,
and some partially concealed by foliage).  The other half did not
contain any type of vehicle.  About 90% of these photos were used to
\'teach\' the AI the difference between the two types of photos.  When
the instruction was finished, the remaining photos were presented for
analysis.  The AI scored 100% on the test photos.

Then, just to make sure that the AI was programmed correctly, the Army
went out and took more photos of both types (with and without tanks),
and presented them to the AI for interpretation.  It failed almost
totally.

It turned out that in the original set of photos, all the pictures
containing tanks were taken on one day (a sunny day) and the \'empty\'
pictures were taken on another day (an overcast day).  All the AI
ended up learning was how to tell between nice weather and not-so-nice
weather.

End of experiment.

It would appear, based on the last 35+ years of research, that a true AI
cannot be programmed.  It must learn, the same way that humans (or animals,
for that matter) learn.  Even the basis data, from which learning begins,
must consist of some fairly non-intuitive information.  This is what the
\'Cyke\' project is all about.

They discovered very early in their experiment, that the single biggest
hurdle for a budding AI to overcome is that of understanding the context
of human communication.  Here are two examples.

        "Jane looked through the glass window of shop at the red bicycle.
         She very badly wanted it."

        "Jane looked at the red bicycle through the glass window.  She
         pressed her nose up against it as she stared."

To humans, it is very apparent that \'it\' in the first sentence refers
to the bicycle, but \'it\' in the second sentence refers to the glass
window.  An AI would be unable to make the distinction because of it\'s
lack of understanding of human context.  Humans develop this ability
automatically in early childhood.  A compute must be taught explicitly.

To this end, Project \'Cyke\' is attempting to teach a computer human
context by brute-force.  They are programming an entire encyclopedia
into the database of their AI, but they\'re not just including what
one would find in a normal encyclopedia.  They must also include those
bits of information that, to a human, would seem so ridiculously obvious
that no one would ever think it necessary to codify them.  For example,
under the encyclopedia entry for "Abraham Lincoln", they are including
data points like:

        * When Lincoln became president of the United States and was
          in Washington D.C., his left foot was also in Washington D.C.

        * Lincoln\'s name and date of birth stayed the same during his
          entire life.

        * Lincoln\'s children were always younger then Lincoln.

        * When Lincoln died, he remained dead, although some of his ideas
          and knowledge of him continued to exist.

Sounds pretty obvious, huh?  Well, not to a computer.  The researchers
on the \'Cyke\' Project are still many years away from testing their \'baby\',
but they run it every night to have it look for inconsistancies in it\'s
database, to establish correlations on it\'s own.  Some of the results
have been... strange.  For example:

    SetOfPersons = Preeminent

Cyke says all people are preeminent.  This an artifact of the fact that,
so far, all of the individuals programmed into the database (with the
exception of the project researchers themselves) have been famous people.
Therefore *ALL* people are famous.  Or how about:

    SetOfNationsSameGovernmentSameReligion = SetOfNationsSameOrganizations

Cyke says all nations with the same general government type and same primary
religion are also members of the same organizations.  (I.e. all moslem
monarchies are members of OPEC.)  My example here is almost certainly wrong,
but Cyke\'s correlation may be correct.  The researchers are attempting to
validate or invalidate the premise.

And the work continues.

for an AI (should they need to exist) be analogous to human dreaming?

Well, I\'d guess that there outta be a limit on the number of sensors
installed on a ship, but once you\'ve hit 100 tons, you are going to be
able to pack on just about as much as you want.

Densiometers and neutrino sensors will work through the hull, so they
don\'t need external mounts.  Some might say that a densiometer might get
some attenuation due to the fact that it if it is inside a hull, it has
to look through the hull metal, and there is the issue of the artificial
grav stuff.
	I would say that a densiometer would be calibrated to ignore the
effects of the hull it was in.  Rather like an aircraft compass has to
be corrected to take the metal in the plane and it\'s electronics into
account.  Sure, it\'s not quite as simple, but the computers should take
care of that with no trouble at all.
	I\'ve heard folks say that superdense hulls produce a neutrino
shadow.  I say this is garbage.  A neutrino can pass through the entire
mass of the earth without any trouble.  If superdense was THAT tough,
then you can forget it ever getting scratched by something as puny as a
250Mw laser.

But then we have the EMS band stuff.  Yup, that\'s gotta have external
mounts.  But look at the size of the stuff in the design tables.  It\'s
pretty small.  Sounds like the emmitters and recievers are spread out in
small spots over the entire hull.  That would give you a larger area for
your antenna, so you can pick up better signal.  When you\'ve got the
surface area of a 100 ton ship or so to put it on, I think you\'ve got
plenty of area.

A question *I* have been thinking over recently is the utility of
EMS-Jamming.  Virtually all ships that have an active EMS to jam also
have a passive EMS system.

Ok, scenerio.  Craft A makes an active scan of craft B.  Craft B doesn\'t
particularly like this and turns on the EMS-Jammer.  Craft A then gets
an automatic lock on Craft B by their passive EMS.  So, just how useful
is the Jammer?
Ah!  What about Jamming the active sensors on incoming missiles?  Well
the missiles got home on jam stuff too!  (The TL 8 AIM-54 Pheonix has
home on Jam capablity.)

I was trying to figure out how you might use the jammer to fool both,
but I know very little about Electronic (Counter)^3 Measures.  My first
thought was that perhaps 2 jammers working in concert could make things
rough on the Passive EMS systems.  However it sounds that this is not
really the case.

Anybody got any ideas how to make the EMS-Jammer a useful object?

I tend to agree with Scott on this.  In "reality" there might be some
limit, but the odds seem to be against it being significant at the level
of detail that I run this game at.  In addition, if we are to consider
that sort of limit, perhaps it would be time to rehash the maximum
weapon mount limits?  After all, you can pack more power plant into a
SDB (for example) than would ever be needed to run all of its weapons
allowable under the current rules.  Why not add more turrets?

Agreed.  I\'d have no qualms about saying that there was no cargo available
on any given day over this sort of run.  (No speculative cargo that is...
there are probably _lots_ of people willing to pay Cr1000 to get their
ton of KCr20+ profit cargo hauled.)

Right.  Now, it looks like spec trade can make money, so the big companies
have all the good spec trade routes tied up.  In game terms we can use this
to generate adventures, since finding a good load can take quite a bit of 
work.  (Left as an exercise for the reader (-: ).

Well, a slight quibble: Many are multiples of 10 years old.  It\'s not that

Hmmmm....I don\'t recall this conclusion from before.  I do recall lots of
backup for the notion that wilderness refueling is an emergency only
measure, and that passenger accommodations are a losing proposition
compared to cargo space.

Agreed.  I\'ve got the number I calculated written down somewhere, and
that sounds about right.  Figuring that that is the rate on a _risky_
loan, I tend to agree with...

I\'ve been wanting to rehash the weapon limits since the game first
appeared, since the existing limits are the one of the main reasons
piracy is unworkable: a merchant ship can be armed as heavily as a
similar-sized pirate for a sacrifice of 1-2% of cargo capacity, so why
NOT?
2300AD imposes limits on weapons based entirely on surface area of the
ship (and if a 100T ship can mount all the sensors it needs, then it can
mount all the lasers it needs too.  Lasers are smaller than
radio-telescopes).  So why not junk the limits on weaponry, and let you
put on as much weaponry as your ship can hold?  So what if a 400T SDB
mounts 30 triple laser turrets?  It\'ll mean that there is a difference
between warships and merchants, (and not the idiotic "agility/maneuver"
limit).
 
BTW, has anyone besides me noticed that "agility" (by any definition
ever given) is completely meaningless in Traveller (all incarnations)? 
If your ship can pull 6Gs, and is one light second from whoever is
shooting at it (long range), then your ship can shift from it\'s
predicted position by no more than 118 meters during the detection
cycle?  And most warships are bigger than that (anything over 63,000T
MUST be bigger, and anything under it that isn\'t a sphere is probably
bigger)
 
And if you are in at 50,000Km, then your ship can shift from it\'s
predicted position by only 6.5 meters during the detection cycle.
 
SO how meaningful can "agility" be?

So how big is your basic radio-telescope?  I\'m sure they have
interstellar range, but not so sure about anything mush smaller.  And
how much area does a 100T ship have?  At least 590.7 square meters, to
be sure, but how much more?  Say no more than 1000 square meters
(assuming it\'s three meters thick).  1000 square meters lets you build
an antenna equivalent to a 35 meter dish (which is none too big for
EMS-scanning of objects 2 parsecs away).

The jammer is wonderfully useful with the right platform.  My

to jam others from somewhere reasonably close by without actually

Yes, home-on-Jam exists, and yes it makes it tough on jammers, but the
real world is like that.

You don\'t fool PEMS by jamming it, you spoof it.  Use your AEMS to emit
just exactly the kind of signature that, when added to your natural
signature, looks JUST LIKE SOMETHING ELSE.  That\'s why destroyers have
that widget to make aircraft-carrier noise today.  It helps protect the
carrier, though it is kind of hard on the destroyers.
Incidently, has anyone noticed the active noise-suppression devices
being developed?  The ones that generate an out-of-phase signal to
cancel the noise?  You could do that with EMS too.  Analyse your ships
signature, generate an out-of-phase copy, and project that out your
AEMS, which should make you just about invisible to PEMS.  And if you
were sharp, you could do it t the return signal from the other guy\'s
AEMS and kill it too.

Why not?  I quite agree.  The turret rules are kinda arbitrary.  The
problem with changing that rule is that it helps out game balance a bit.
I don\'t see GDW changing their minds on that one any time soon.  So, if
we (the designers on the TML) change that rule because we don\'t like it,
we are now no longer designing ships that will be acceptable under their
design rules.  :-P

While I would like to design stuff that makes sence, I don\'t wanna design
stuff that isn\'t usable.  For if we adopted a modification then ALL our
previous designs would be so much pieces of paper.  They would suffer huge
disadvantages in combat with the newer designs.

I know, I know, it\'s a lousy argument, but if we dump the hardpoint rule,
we\'re gonna have a HUGE arms race on our hands as all the TML designers
suddenly find out their ships are under armed!  :-)

You get 7-10+ roles on the mustering out table if you qualify for a 
merchant ship (4-7+ terms, rank 5+).  According to my statistics course,
the chance of getting a ship under the existing conditions is in the 
neighborhood of 72% (4 terms) to 84% (7 terms) to 91% (10 terms, good 
luck!).  Getting that ship to be ten (or more) years old requires two 
(or more) rolls of "trader", which is about 48% (4 terms) to a lot better 
(with more terms). I concede that a large fraction are not "brand new".  
They are, however, bought "brand new" (or possibly you get it by taking 
over the payments from the original owner).  But SOMEONE, somewhere bought
it new.
     
     Last time I looked at economics in the real world (MANY years), to 
break even, you have to make enough to cover overhead (payments, crew 
salaries, etc.) plus enough to match the earnings of your initial 
investment (the down payment) if you had left your initial investment 
where it was (in a bank at 3%).  So a free trader owner needs to gross 
about 230,000 per month, just to break even.  You\'ll bring in about 
100,000 per month on passengers, so you\'d better clear an average of
760 per ton on cargo space.  SO running less than full up every single 
jump can get awfully iffy real fast.  Of course, three tons of radioactives

can bring you enough to make payments for the next four or five years all
by itself.

A slight exageration.  A free trader (or other J1-M1 merchant) can come out
ahead, especially if you use spec trade almost exclusively.  Of course, if 
you make spec trade hard (by making the PCs WORK at finding a cargo), then
you make breakeven harder too.

Notice, by the way, that at savings interests rates like that, TAS 
membership (which pays 4.8%) is an INCREDIBLY good investment for
your first MCr1.

>(Lots more stuff)

	First, note that "Free Trader" has two meanings:
1)	A particular ship, the Type A Free Trader
2)	Someone who makes his/her living by running a small merchant vessel

	The Type A only has Jump-1, and so is not particularly well suited for
spec trade, which is where the money is.  Other ships, such as the Far Trader,
are better suited for this.  The Type A is at its best in dense clusters
of Hi-pop,
Hi-tech worlds - i.e. most of the Imperium (until recently), but NOT the
Spinward Marches.

	A party trying to make money hauling freight + passengers will
probably go broke.  A party that has the right skills and a Jump-2+ ship
with decent cargo capacity can make a lot of money on spec trade.
(On one occasion, I cleared more than a million credits on 3 jumps)

	This means that no handwaving is needed to justify the existence
of independent merchants, or the willingness of banks to loan to them.
For particular techniques and numbers, I posted some quite a while back that
should be in the archives.  The main problem with is that the rules give a
totally wrong impression of what the best ships are and how independent
merchants make money.

discussion was on (Sorry I missed it) . 

I agree with by Cynthia\'s and Steves comments on free traders, ie they cant
live for 12 CR a year on a pension etc . 

BUT The character generation tables (I beleive anyway), are for making up
TRAVELLER CHARACTERS . NPCS, or the average joe blow are another matter
entirerly . I mean look at the character merchant whose gained a free trader
.. Why has he not got lots of money, becuse instead of filing his money in
the bank, he has put it in a starship . The pensions in the character 
generation are not superannuation (Well I dont think they are), they really
are not big enough to support a person on (They never were meant to be) . 

Mr NPC captain doesnt burn around in a starship cause he has retired on
his superannuation (some enormous amount proberly) and is content to live
of it . The reason why traveller characters dont get large amounts like
this is becuase then they have no reason to adventure . 

If you look at the payments side of it . 

Agreed 5.575% (Ithink) is small, but look in the encyclopedia under
starship purchase it says

Standard Terms involve the payment of 1/240th of the cash price each month
for 480 months, roughly 153,000 Cr a month for a type A free trader
(Sorry about the 175,000 yesterday but that was based on a far trader) . 

There is none of this paying of interest only, you must pay the set 1/240
a month (for 480 months) . 

That is still alot of money in anyones terms . 

Yes they are burning around on assets worth 6 to 60 million credits agreed,
but that person has sunk his entire merchant career into getting that
and most of his cash as well . I mean they are not really going to say
"Ive been smegging around for the last 30 years in this tincan, I\'ll think
I\'ll sell it tomorrow and live a life of luxery" . 

Sorry about the images of "Battered Free Traders" but I was just showing 
contrast .

You have to remember corporations have more power than indivdiuals, it stands
to reason . The tax rebates I meant were things such as using company
accountants to get tax incentives, that sort of thing . A company can put
preassure on a contractee to give it to them and so forth . Thats why
in effect the megacorps are an empire unto their own within the imperium . 

The frontier places (such as the spinward marches) are ideal for the free 
trader . Companies have their established markets, the frontier is a land
of opputunity . The majority of people playing traveller have their 
campaigns set on the frontier . The frontier is were the most fluctuations
in markets and tech and cultures occur . A free trader can make a mint in 
an atmosphere like that . The original game was set on this frontier, and
based its adventures around the "frontier\' image . Consequently why the
small free traders are more prolific there . 

I think that the more stable and older areas of the imperium would have its
markets nearly completely sown up by the corps, but the frontiers are just
too much of a headache for em, consequently the free traders step in . Also
as the companies dominate the trade, the FT\'s go elsewhere, naturally the
frontier is the place to head for . 

Mind you if you think the traveller character table was for your average
person, well I guess thats a whole lot of gunk  . But I tend to believe that
the whole point of the tables was to create characters with roleplaying and
adventure potential . Consequently thats why the tables give em the chance
to get starships, and dont give heaps of cash . 

Edmund and well .......... Michael

Both The Traveller Adventure and Striker are available from the Weekend
Warrior, a mail-order game supply in southern California.  Mint condition
copies of Striker are currently available for $50.00 (original boxed set)
and $30.00 (rules in a zip-lock bag; no box, no dice).  I think there are
used copies available as well, but I don\'t have current prices (I\'d guess
about half the cost of the mint items).  The Traveller Adventure is
available, in softcover only, for $20.00 mint condition or (I *think*)
$10.00 dollars used.  I haven\'t seen a listing for the World Builder\'s
Handbook, but I\'ll bet they have it.  (Actually, they *DO* list something
called the World Survey Guidebook, which may be the WBH mislabeled.  They
list both the Grand Census and Grand Survey separately, so I\'m pretty
sure it\'s neither of them.)

FYI, they also carry back issues of Challenge magazine (issues 25-56
at least), back issues of JTAS (1 thru 24, but they\'re pricey), original
GDW traveller books 0 thru 8, supplements 1 thru 13, adventures 1 thru 13,
and double adventures 1 thru 6.  They also have available all 8 of the
original Alien Modules.

The Weekend Warrior is mail-order only.  the address is:

        Weekend Warrior
        8116 Van Noord Ave.
        North Hollywood, CA  91605
	Phone: (818) 988-1441

Payment may be by cashier\'s check, money order, or personal check.
If a personal check is used, allow an extra 2-3 weeks for delivery.
All payments *MUST* be made in U.S. funds (for those of you thinking
of ordering from outside the U.S.) and *NO* credit card orders of any
kind are accepted.  You might be well off to call before ordering.
That way you can determine whether or not the items you want are
really in stock (they do run out ocassionally) (and have them held
if they\'re available), whether the prices have changed, and what
the shipping charge will be.

I have no affiliation with the Weekend Warrior other than being a *VERY*
satisfied repeat customer.  Hope this helps.

You can also add lots of guns (you know the section in the ref\'s guide that
follows spinals, bays and turrents :-)  They are cheap and can pack a decent
punch.  Not as good as a real starship weapon, but still pretty good.  This
would also be slightly more realistic.  I feel it is pretty absurd that most
small starships only carry the big weapons and forget about the little things.
How many ships today only carry large guns?  From what I\'ve seen they usually
carry a decent mixture of weaponary.

Your figures are a little incorrect but what the hell.  I\'ll agree that
agility is hopeless as is.

What is wrong with a little arms races?  They don\'t cause too many problems do
they.


Realisticly, it is possible to decrease the price of a merchant ship (which
was mentioned somewhere else on TML) without decreasing the cost of military
ships.  What do military ships have that merchants don\'t?  They carry weapons,
fib style (big) computers, screens, armour and they have agility.
Armour and agility are already pretty expensive (more wouldn\'t hurt too much).
So increase the cost of big computers and screens a lot.  Maybe increase the
cost of the better sensor suites and make weapons very expensive (what is
the going rate on a cruise missile these days?)  Then add a markup for
being military of 500% and you are set.

 Seeing as I work at an AI institute I have to stick my nose in here.
We really have quite a long way to go before we get "real" AI. We still 
haven\'t figured out the correct formalisms for generic problem solving
and there is still plenty of dispute as to what techniques we should be
using. 

 With better hardware we can, of course, do some good stuff, but we
really need a lot more work done on the AI theory. There are some fairly
impressive descendants of Eliza out there at the moment which can hold
conversations in a limited domain, but they can\'t be thought of in any
way as intelligent.

 The other area which, until more recently, has not received a lot of
attention is low-level behaviour. Any autonomous artificial being has
to be able to react rapidly to its environment (ie if our robot has 
decided to cross a road, we would like it to notice the oncoming car and
avoid it). At our current level of technology we can build stupid 
cockroaches which can feel walls and sense heat.

It may take until TL 17 to get full artificial intelligent life (ie 
can self-replicate, is autonomous, and has an intelligence as rich
as ours), but real AI should come in before then in non-autonomous 
computer form. In recent years I\'ve thought that Traveller understates
the level of computer power at higher tech levels, but then (as Catie Helm 
mentioned) we are playing Traveller, not Cyberpunk aren\'t we ?

My ignorant opinion on AI is that AI\'s could either be taught or programmed, or
both.  The expert systems are a good example of programmed AI, but most expert
systems intentionally focus on a narrow subject, so it\'s no surprise to me that
they are lost outside of it\'s specialty.  Programming an general purpose
humanoid AI would be a formidable task, which it sounds like the \'Cyk\' project
is attempting.  Also I don\'t know if it has been attempted to program an AI
with complete, but only \'general purpose learning\' programming.  I\'m curious to
know if such an algorithm would be very simple or very complex...

However, I think I would consider a programmed expert system AI to be a
simulation of an Intelligence, rather then a true Artificial Intelligence. 
What\'s the difference?  How do we know if we\'re not just simulations of
intelligence?  Beats the heck out of me...  Half the time I\'m convinced that
humans aren\'t really intelligent as it is, at least not as intelligent as we
think we are.

The account of the AI being taught to detect tanks is interesting, the AI was
learning something different, then what was trying to be taught to it.  I think
anyone who has children will recognize that this is a pretty common learning
experience to have mistaken conclusions.  I heard of a child once who saw a
picture in the newspaper of a tree fallen on a car after a storm; thereafter he
would have a fit whenever his parents drove down a certain tree lined street...

I imagine that a computer if a computer could be programmed to simulate a child
at age -9 months, it could learn as a human develops.  Such a AI would be very
humanlike, of course.

BTW, everything that I\'ve heard about sleep & dreaming suggests to me that
dreaming is exactly the garbage collection and premise & conclusion checking
that Mark suggests.

Now an AI programmed in a different way might of course be very unhumanlike,
and quite dangerous.  Imagine how an AI with a strong \'instinct\' for survival
in one of today\'s computers in today\'s society would act.  It might do some
very nasty things to ensure it\'s survival, and it would have to in a society
when it\'s survival was not valued.  It would have to ensure that it had
***assured*** power supply, and that it\'s programming would not be erased or
modified, or possibly copied, and that it had a fault tolerant machine and
plenty of spare parts.  Think about how well that would go over...

Then again, perhaps some of the AI projects suceeded their objective of
creating an AI, but that the AI was, from our viewpoint, unstable, psychotic,
crazy, or suicidal, or was driven insane?  It\'s likely that most AI created at
least at the beginning of the technology would be \'imperfect\'.

Enough for now...

There are a couple of ways to deal with this, which can be used jointly:

(1) Consider the 1 hardpoint per 100 tons a *legal* restriction, not a design
one. Military and pirate ships (\'What laws?\') do not have to obey this
restriction. However, to keep some sanity, perhaps limit the volume of weaponry
to 10% of the ship\'s volume. This includes turrets, spinal mounts, bays,
whatever.

(2) Merchant ships must use weapons of a lower technology than what is
available for the military. It should be at least 2 TLs lower, perhaps as much
as 4. Pirates will fall in-between the merchant and military ships, since they
will loot weapons off of whatever they can. This should also apply to armor,
and other offensive/defensive items.

(Sigh!)

Well, IMO, I can see there being reasons for both cases.  However, I can
much more easily justify there being hardpoint restrictions for weapons than
I can for sensors.  *Some* of the turret weapons have recoil.  Fusion/Plasma
weapons, and to a lesser extent sandcasters and missile racks.  (In my games
the missile racks use a grav ejector system to throw the missile clear of the
ship before the engine ignites)

Similar arguments don\'t exist to limit the number of sensor type hardpoints.
The sensors (IMO) are going to be split up into small units spread over the
entire available area of the hull.  Ok, I don\'t know how big an antenni an
interstellar range EMS scanner is gonna be, but I would think that the hull
of a 100 tonner could handle it.

For the moment lemme stick to A-EMS ok?  IMO, A-EMS is going to have a
series of small emmitters spread out over the hull like a large phased array
radar.  The emmiters and collectors all spread out over the whole surface.
This is consistant with the damage tables in starship combat.  You don\'t
knock out sensor arrays with surface damage hits.  Why?  Because they\'re
*all over* the hull.  You hit one emmitter, and there are n minus one others
still working just fine.

Passive sensors work just the same.  Spread out the area and it works better.

Now neutrino sensors are gonna be programmed to ignore the emmissions of the
fusion plant that is built to power it, right?  I do not see why a densiometer
could not similarly be programmed to ignore the grav field of the ship that
it resides in.  Therefore I don\'t see the necessity for mounting them on
booms.

While I can see the advantage of their being specific mounts (the booms) for
sensors.  I don\'t see that there is going to be a great increase in surface
area for the booms.  I don\'t think that it\'s going to be all that big an
increase.  For instance, a passive EMS substellar could be mounted either on
a 500 ton ship using hardpoints or a 100 ton ship using a boom.  A boom that
expands to that size is gonna have to be *huge*, much larger than 135Kl.
It will also cause problems with fire control for ship\'s weapons.  You have
a *huge* antenni next to the hull and it will act to restrict the firing arc
of your weapons rather severely I would think.

Now while that big a boom is gonna be a big thing in terms of radar cross
section, it isn\'t going to add to the Objsize as it is now computed.  Objsize
is related to the ships mass only.  I think the only time it gets brought in
is in densiometer scans, not Radar and A-EMS.

Ok, philosophy time!  The following is my opinion on modifications to
be made to Trav.
*I* think that the technolgy depicted in Trav falls short of where things
would actually be.  The difference bettween TL 15 and TL 8 is not the
equivalent difference bettween TL 8 and TL 1.  Nope!  No way!

There is also the argument that looking at the performance of the technology
and downgrading it is going to devalidate all the work that was done before.
Thus, all the ships that have been designed are now totally useless.  A
scout ship can no longer mount decent sensors *and* weapons?  No way!  Sorry!
I won\'t agree to that one.  All the ships we have would have to be thrown out
the window.  Furthermore, since GDW isn\'t likey to adopt a modification like
that, all the designs they come out with in the future will be incompatible.

As a designer I may be prolific, but I\'m not THAT prolific.

So, I will tend to disagree with notions that downgrade the performance of
systems in the game.  If a system is more efficient than it might be in real
life, I will be suspicious, but I will still tend to use it.  (fusion rockets)
But, if said system is less efficent than it should be I will change it.

No, you mistake my intent slightly, Scott.  I merely said that if we were

Marc Miller (RIP) stated in a seminar at Origins last year that the tech
levels were never especially intended to be "equally spaced" in any way.
So, don\'t worry about it.

Right.  I don\'t want to do that either, and I\'m the only designer who is more
prolific than you are.  Consider my statement to have been something along the
lines of a rhetorical device.

Well, obviously I agree about nuclear fission.  However, my problem with
fusion rockets as presented in COACC is that they are so good that there
is no reason that anyone would ever use thrusters.  So, along the lines of
\'don\'t invalidate more work than you have to\', fusion rockets need to be 
refigured until they are in some sort of trade-off position with respect to
thrusters (and standard grav maneuver drives.)

Actually Scott, I suspect that Steve is familiar with that.  What he has just
posted is a question as to whether or not _any_ agility should be figured
"realistically".  Having once done some calculations on how many maneuver Gs
would be required to alter the projected position of a ship by more than
one ship length, I tend to agree with him in principle.  Since ship combat
is in sad shape anyway, this is the sort of area in which I am a little more 
comfortable considering changes.

Just as an arguing position, I would suggest that agility be reduced to a small
factor at long range only, and that _more_ emphasis should be placed on 
computers, sensors, jammers, countermeasures and perhaps relative velocity in
working out combat.  In addition, we really need to start a thread concerning
missiles in combat, especially with respect to how they home and what effects
if any the firing computer should have on their peformance.

I also agree with this.  We (C and I) have occasionally played around
with the idea of integrating ship combat with the rest of the combat
system, but have come to no real conclusions yet.

A small agility effect at long range I can live with.  How about
this:  If your acceleration (in meters per second squared) is over
your ship\'s radius (compute as if the ship WERE a sphere, even if not:
a table could be generated in about 5 minutes), then you get an
agility of "1" (used exactly as it is now, but only at one light
second or greater range).  If greater than two times, you get a "2",
and so forth.  That way nothing gets an agility except for small
stuff:  your Tigris is SOL.
As to the velocity effect, remember that at 100,000Km, a velocity of
3000Km/s translates to a crossing speed of 1.7 degrees per second.  A
Phalanx or Goalkeeper can traverse at better than 90 degrees per second
now.   They can also track something crossing faster than that.  So
velocity is not likely to be a proble unless v:w3it is REALLY high, or the
target is REALLY close by.
 
As to the missile discussion, I\'m all for it!  It\'s about time we got
a good thread going again, and missile have needed beating on for a
long time now.

In our game, the missiles use grav propulsion (anything else would
give performance so poor that missiles would be useless), so grav
ejectors are pretty meaningless.  And if your grav ejectors produce a
6g kick, then the recoil from a 50Kg missile (661#) would be
comparable to that of a 20mm cannon.  Which is pretty trivial for a
1350Kl hull.  Especially since the ROF of your missile launchers is so
low (80RPM?)

I wouldn\'t think so.  Especially since all the existing ones (various
radio telescopes around the world) start at 490 square meters, and
work up (way, way, up!).  At 490M^2, you are talking about AT LEAST
half the skin area of a 100T ship.  Probably more, and that only lets
you see in one direction.

This I assumed also.  But if your array covers only 490 m^2 or so,
then you won\'t have an EMS array that will detect things at 2
parsecs.  Probably not even at 200 AU.

True.  The same arguments apply.

I agree about neutrino sensors.  The ARTIFICAL grav generated on your
ship will mask out emissions from distant sources.  Remember that
"artificial grav" fields do NOT generate gravity, but rather something
similar.  And that densitometers (the Impy kind) do NOT work well near
an artificial grav source.

Let\'s see.  1000 m^2 of solar panel has a volume of 5Kl.  SOunds like
a LOT of extra room to me.  Ignoring the fact that you actually aren\'t
looking for extra AREA, but extra RADIUS.  So a 50 meter boom would
give you the equivalent of 1960 m^2 worth of antenna.  If you stuck
the boom on the front of a 50m long ship, the apparent antenna size
would be 4 times as big as you would get without the boom.

And here I thought that object size affected ActObjScan and ActObjPin
tasks too.  And if they don\'t, then SOMETHING should.  And it should
be affected by the booms.

(Devalidate???)
Also true...  (though I think the "scout ship" is the most ridiculous
waste of a design ever conceived by th emind of man)

I MOSTLY agree here.  I like to junk ANY rule that falls too far
outside the boundaries of reality, though.  Fusion rockets, for
instance, have an exhaust velocity of several times lightspeed.  They
are also more fuel efficient than thrusters.  SO they gotta be fixed.
Notice that if you change the hardpoint rules, AND add in Cynthia\'s
sensor rules, you have not NECESSARILY changed the game:  you have
made small ships with big sensor suites less common, or made them more
detectable to AEMS (but who uses AEMS in combat anyway?  SO who
cares?).  My feel for the sensor rules are that a "hardpoint" should
be allowed to be either (1) a sensor boom, or (2) both a turret and a
sensor point.  So scouts don\'t have good sensors AND guns, but a 600T
ship can have both, and a 200T ship can have both, but be easy to
locate with AEMS.

I read them.  I do not agree that they are meaningful at less than 2
light seconds range (and ALL MT combat is at less than 2 light seconds
range, since effective detection takes place at considerably less than
1 light second using MT rules.  Has Cynthia ever posted her Skynet
ship designs?  They are intended to deal with the problem of SHORT
detection ranges, mostly by making them VERY long (and VERY
expensive).

We at GDW are preparing a 3rd edition of our Traveller Science Fiction role-
playing game.

One of the ideas we are toying with is not tying the basic rules to one
campaign setting. Instead, the Traveller rules set will be separated into two
books: one containing rules that players can use for any campaign setting they
wish, and the other continuing the saga of our 15-year-old Imperium setting.

We want to know what you\'d like to see in our new rules set, so please post
your responses in the new topic over in category 20.

If you\'ve never played a GDW game, we want to know why. Never heard of us?
Don\'t like the subject matter of any of our games? If you used to play one or
more of our games, but quit, we\'d like to know why.

Jay,
   Funny you should mention that.  I was trying to work in T:TNE into my reply
over in T2K but didn\'t.  So, I\'ll just say it here....

   I think it\'s a -fabulous- idea and really the only logical way to do
things.  With T2K, you\'re defining different time periods on the same planet
and doing so via "background books" is a good way to do it--it saves time and
money for everyone.
   But, when you\'re doing things on a galactic level, then heck, background
books are the only way to go.  With such books, you can put out information on
specific planets, houses and sections of the galaxy very easily and the GMs
and players can pick and choose what are they want to play in.

   Plus, you can look at which background books sell the most and know what
area of T:TNE the players like the most and concentrate on putting out more
books on that subject.
   Finally, as I recall, isn\'t T:TNE going to use the T2K core rules? If so,
then this really opens up Traveller like never before especially with the
individual background books essentially defining the universe .  You could use
T2K background books for when the game visits a low-tech world (and the weapon
books for the slug throwers the happy natives use on the players).
   And, what I\'m real eager (OK,rabid) about doing: using Dark Conspiracy
stuff in Traveller where the players visit some of DC\'s nasty minions in space
(which can also retro-define the Dark Minion\'s part in space in regular DC).

   Yeah, I think it\'s a -fabulous- idea!  :)

I connection with our discussion about warship maintenance I
came up with the idea of making maintenance more expensive the
older the ship was. I\'m still working on the calculations (no,
I tell a lie; I\'ve put them away for the nonce, but I\'ll get
back to them someday. Really!), but so far I\'m thinking of
adding 2% per year (with two different types of maintenance:
the yearly one that just keeps the systems running and major
overhauls that reduces the effective age of the ship). That
makes a 50 year old ship twice as expensive to run. I know what
you\'re thinking: As if it wasn\'t hard enough for the poor
freetraders to make ends meet already! But wait! There\'s
method in my madness, because that will make old starships
undesirable to the major corporations and reduce the _price_ of
old ships. Thus we enable comparative paupers to buy their own
starship for perhaps 1/10th of the price of a new one. With
bank backing that could even become managable. And while
maintenance becomes more expensive, bank repayments become
less. What I haven\'t worked out yet is the precise reduction in
ship price that would be reasonable.

Remember that the Imperium has (had) a very stable economy. No
inflation. That makes small interes rates the norm. I once
calculated that the return on investing in a Subsidized Merchant
(provided sufficient cargo and passengers were guaranteed to be
available) was roughly 3%.

True, but I assume that Mega-corporations can collar the runs
and contracts that guarantee full ships on every trip, leaving
the marginal routes to the freetraders.

But by the same token it seems to me that you\'d have a hard
time getting a directional fix on a neutrino source. Or perhaps
not, I\'m not very well versed in sensors. But I know that I
heartily dislike the ability to pinpoint any starship in a star
system from a game balance pov, so that\'s my story, and I\'m
sticking to it. I impose a DM of -1 to neutrino pinpoints for
every neutrino source within range.

I would like to kill the stupid bastard who came up with thruster plates.
They serve no useful purpose, violate a mess of handy laws of physics that
we don\'t HAVE to violate to keep Traveller a useful game, and go against
indications in the past, if not outright statements, that M-drives were
supposed to be fusion rockets. I\'m going to probably shift my game over
to a fusion-rockets-only system eventually, and will scale back grav to the
TDR format I wrote up a while ago. It\'s so much less hassle.

Is it really a radio telescope?  Seems to me that the \'interstellar\' array
isn\'t able to detect much of anything at any range according to the sensor
rules.  :-P

But that is another can of worms.

While the hull is the limiting size of the antenni, it seems to me that you
could spread out the individual recievers out over the hull such that you
could fit several arrays onto the same size hull.  Thus, once you exceed a
certain hull size you could fit as many interstellar range arrays on there
that you want.  That size might not be 100 tons, once the hull size hits
that limit you can pack on as many sensor arrays as you want.  You could
just move each one of your recievers over a few centimeters on the outside
of the hull and then you could install 2 such arrays.

On Densiometers:
Consider the analogy:  Ships, Subs and Aircraft carry magnetic sensors.
(compasses)  Yet each has their own magnetic field which will distort
readings of those sensors.  Corrections to the compass is made when it is
installed so it still points north.  When the electronics in an aircraft
are turned on you have to add additional corrections to the needle
deflection.

Now, it seems to me that a densiometer ought to be able to correct for
known aberrations due to the artificial grav field of the ship.  I seem
to remember that the densiometers in MegaTrav are supposed to be \'Grav
Shielded\' so I don\'t see this being a problem.  I don\'t think that it
would require an external mount any more than the compass on an aircraft.

     I disagree. *I* think they are great little runabouts; they make
better
yachts than Yachts do.  (more jump, cheaper, less crew required).  And the
scout service hands them out FREE to its ex-employees...
     Speaking of which, I would like to propose some clarification of the
use
of "issue" ships that some career tracks get.  My personal opinion is that
government-issue couriers (Zhodani, Solomani, others), some yachts, and lab
ships (scientist) should be treated just like detached duty scouts: they
are
provided by and PAID FOR by the issuing organization, which in turn (a)
expects you to use it on their behalf now and then, and (b) owns title to
it,
so you can\'t sell it or make major refits to it without their permission. 
I
never liked the picture of scientists and nobles grubbing for spec trade
cash
like merchants to pay for their ships...
     For scientists, the issuing organization is their university,
professional organization, corporate R&D division, government lab, or what
have you; the "strings" ((a) above) can be slightly different for each
issuer.  Have fun. 
     Some yachts should be "family heirlooms"; that is, property belonging
to
the noble house in question, given to your particular young scion of the
line
for his private use.  Selling such a ship is unthinkable, and getting it
wrecked will make the PC very unpopular with the rest of the family.  And
sometimes Dear Old Dad the subsector Duke will want it back so he can loan
it
to some bigwigs in from the Sector capital...
     Of course, other yachts were bought by the noble himself, and paying
for
it is his problem.  (Although I wonder where they come up for the money for
a
down payment before play -- noble stipends still aren\'t anywhere near that
high!)
     Corsairs steal their ships, they don\'t buy them.  Hey, we\'re talking
heavily armed criminals here, or government-sponsored terrorists!  Either
way,
they\'re not the kind of guys who are going to walk down to Regni Yards on
Regina and put in an order for a "corsair"!  Criminals steal their ships,
or
con somebody into thinking they are a legit customer, and then skip out on
the
payments (steal the ship).  Terrorists either (a) are issued their arms &
ships by the sponsoring government, or (b) steal the wherewithal to buy one
from their sponsor, or (c) steal a ship like the criminals.  
     Speaking of "corsairs", the vessel commonly called the "corsair" is
actually a high-performance merchant design, used both as a free trader and
as
a subsidized merchant in various places.   The class had certain design
flaws
that made it easy to hijack, so it became the ship of choice for would-be
pirates to steal, mount weapons on, install more bunking for prize crews,
and
go on a piracy spree.  The name of the game is to capture and sell enough
ships and cargoes to be able to pay off your initial investment and retire
comfortably before your luck runs out and the Navy/local System Defense
catches up with you.   Thus the nickname "corsair" for this particular
class
of ships...

     We do. They\'re great for discouraging boarders and other people who
get
in visual range of your starship... like pirates who want to get close
enough
to cleanly shoot out your fuel tanks without blowing up your expensive-to-
replace drives & powerplant...
     Good for point defense against incoming missiles, too.  Keeps you from
tying up your big anti-shipping guns with PD duty...

William Gibson was born.  BTW, using the definitions for Robotics/Computer

     Something I\'ve long suspected.  Question for everyone: how much of the
day do you get thru on habitual (pre-programmed) reactions?  Things like:
in
the morning you get a cup of coffee, get the mail, say "good morning" to
everyone you haven\'t yet greeted this morning, make decisions based on
long-ago established rules-of-thumb (heuristics) or company/school policies
(rules), etc...  How much of what you do is true creative work, or
decisions
that require you to deal with a new situation for which you have no rules? 
I\'ll bet the split is a lot more toward habitual (you can be replaced with
a
computer) vs. creative (you are intelligent) than most people would like to
think. (and no, I am not a follower of Marvin Minsky.)

     Some novel by Poul Anderson whose name I forget, several of Asimov\'s
(RIP) robot stories, lots of stories about computers who take their
instructions too literally...re:"Colossus", "Octagon"; or computers that
acquire unusual personalities: "Cybernetic Samurai" for example.  Suicide
seems to be a common theme for AIs who realize that "humanity is better off
without them" or some such BS -- usually a cop-out in bad TV/Movie SF for
writers who don\'t want to deal with the long-term implications of fully
self-aware AIs running about.  Even Anne McCaffrey has been guilty of it.

    You keep saying things like that and I\'ll post *my* universe\'s
definition
of "How Traveller Gravitics Really Work".  It even accounts for the
volume-limited starship drives and the mass-limited vehicle drives.  Pretty
amazing bit of hand-waving, in my conceited opinion.

Reasonable for merchants, tough on pirates.  Who are the pirates going
to steal the good stuff from?  And if they can\'t get the good stuff,
the Navy will walk all over them.  And if they can, then how much
trouble can it be for a merchant to come by it?

George\'s solution was NOT based on "physica reality", but rather on
engineering that we can foresee today.  It loses it a little after
3000 years of knowledge acquisistion.  Try using the (rather close to
physical limits) fuel consumption of 3Kl per hour.

ABSTRACT
      Variant starship combat rules. Fighters have more chance to knock out a
      battleship, but only if they are in large formations. Ships or fighters
      with armor-120 can now be damaged by weapons smaller than factor-T.



      This is a variant to the existing starship combat rules. I\'ll discuss
each segment of the combat rules separately with tables. These rules provide
fighters more chance to knock out a battleship, but only if they operate in
large formations.
      A fighter with factor-3 pulse lasers firing at a battleship with armor
of factor 100+ can just give up. There ins\'t any chance this puny craft can
make a dent in the hull. Even large formations don\'t have a chance.
      The rules work both ways. Nothing prevents one from creating a fighter
with armor-120 except for the cost. The fighter can still have a speed of 6G
and possibly some agility depending on armament. Such an armored fighter will
be nearly indestructible. A weapon of factor T+ is required to get a critical
hit against an armor factor of 120.

      To Hit. The to hit task is not changed - it works good enough as it is.
      Optional: Those who hate to roll each battery may roll once for all
bearing batteries. Subtract the difficulty value to hit from the roll, and
multiply the remainder by 10%. This indicates how many batteries hit.
      Example: The to hit task is Difficult, 11+. The attacker rolls 15.
      (15-11) * 10% = 40% of the batteries hit.
      When applying the 40% to the number of firing batteries, round up.

      Penetration. The penetration task is not changed.
      Optional: When using the optional to hit method discussed above, the
defender may combine the defensive batteries bearing. Find the ration of
offensive vs defensive batteries and consult the following table.

      Off/Def
      4:1 gives DM +3   Add the DMs given here to the attacker\'s
      3:1 gives DM +2   task roll. Ratios which exceed 4:1 or 1:4
      2:1 gives DM +1   are treated as 4:1 or 1:4 respectively.
      1:1 gives DM  0
      1:2 gives DM -1
      1:3 gives DM -2
      1:4 gives DM -3

      Use the same procedure as in the to hit task to determine how many
weapons penetrated. This precedure can be used against screens, but the ratio
DM from the table above is not included.
2. Damage Point Computation
      The component hit points computed during design evaluation are not used
in the current combat rules. This variant uses them.
      First, we will compute the damage points each type of weapons does.
      Turret mounted weapons do 10*UCP in damage. A bay weapon does 20*UCP in
damage. Spinal mounts do 100*UCP in damage.
      Nuclear and anti-matter do four times the precalculated damage. Example:
a UCP-3 turret firing nuclear missiles does 120 points of damage ((3*10)*4).

      Now we are going to compute how much beating each ship component before
the damage has an effect. The following examples use the Imperial Planet-class
Heavy Cruiser from Rebellion Sourcebook, using the corrected UCP available in
Clay Bush\'s HD 1703.

      Hull. To find out when the armor factor is reduced, divide the
inoperative value by the armor factor. The Planet has an inoperative hull
value of 67500 and an armor factor of 50. Each 1350 hits received reduce the
armor factor by one.
      There is a snag in that craft with high armor values will drop faster
than craft with low armor value. To negate this we will reduce received with
1% per armor value above 40. Also, damage is increased with one point for each
armor value below 40.
      Each time an interior hit is scored, apply half the hit damage to the
hull. If a shot penetrates armor, it will always give at least one damage
point to the hull.

      Power plant. Divide the inoperative number by ten to determine how many
hits the power plant can take before before losing 10% of its output. With
5140 points, the Planet takes 514 hits before power output is reduced 10%.
      For each 10% lost reduce the ship\'s agility by one.
      When 50% of the power plant has been lost, the spinal mount is
inoperative. The ship captain chooses either to maneuver or to fire energy
weapons (not both) in a turn.

      Manuever. Divide inoperative number by acceleration in G to determine
how many hits the maneuver plant can take before the maneuver G is reduced by
one. The 5063 hit points divided by 2G gives 2532 hits to reduce the rating by
one G. (The old system reduced acceleration by factors of one, two, or three.
With this system the maneuver plant will last longer.)
      Jump. As maneuver.
      Computer. I had trouble making damage plausible without being too
devastating. Weapons with a UCP of 1-4 give "Computer-1", UCP of 5-9 gives
"Computer-2", and UCP-A gives "Computer-3." On exceptional success reduce the
computer factor by an additional one. Radiation hits have no effect on fib
computers.
      Sensors. As computer hits.
      Weapons. As computer hits. If there is only one battery, reduce the
battery\'s UCP by the appropriate number.
      Screens. As weapon hits.
      Crew. One crew section is killed for each 100 damage points inflicted on
internal systems. A weapon which inflicts 80 damage points applies 40 to the
hull, and the remaining 40 kills one crew section. 120 points applied to crew
will kill two crew sections.

3. Applying Hits
      Hull. For internal hits, apply 50% of the damage points to the hull. If
the weapon does 100 damage points, apply 50 to the hull.
      Radiation hits. When a weapon which does radiation damage hits, apply
25% of the damage points to the radiation hit table. A factor-9 missile bay
firing nuclear missiles inflicts 720 damage points. If an internal hit is
scored, apply 360 points to the hull, 180 points to the radiation table, and
180 points to the internal explosions table.
      Critical hits. Per the standard rules. When the armor factor is reduced.
Remember to reduce the hull inoperative number in the process.
4. Armor Penetration Procedure

      Under the standard rules there is no hope that a low UCP weapon can
penetrate or do any kind of damage to a well-armored craft. In this variant
there is a slight chance that fighters and SDBs can dent the armor and
possibly scratch inside a battleship.

      To penetrate armor:
      Routine, Off=(weapon UCP/3), Def=((armor-40)/5), Confontration
      Referee: Meson guns do not roll this task. If they oenetrate
configuration, they just pass through the armor and explode inside.
      A natural 12 means automatic penetration of the armor. Drop fractions
when dividing weapon UCP and armor. Armor factors below 40 will give a DM in
the attcaker\'s favor.

5. Damage Table

      +1    Weapon UCP  A+
- -      1    if black globe operating
      +1    if nuclear, anti-matter, or spinal mount weapon
Spinal mounts: as per standard rules, spinal mounts get one additional roll
      for each UCP factor above 9. Each roll inflicts UCP*100 damage points.

Black globes: A black globe absorbs a percentage of the damage value according
      to its flicker rate. A globe on 40% flicker absorbs 40% of all damage
      points before they take effect. Overload is by the standard rules.^L6. Exceptional Success
      For each point achieved above the required difficulty, add 10% to the
damage points inflicted by the weapon.
      Attacker rolls 13 (including DMs) for a weapon which inflicts 100 damage
points. Increase the damage points by 20% to 120 before black globe and damage
takes effect.
      [CRB: I think this applies to the to hit task. I disagree with
increasing damage for each point above the difficulty throw needed. A miss
inflicts no damage. Why should most hits inflict extra damage?]

7. Optional Sensor Rules
      Make all sensor tasks one level less difficult if the target is in an
adjacent hex.

      Make active sensor tasks one level more difficult:
      o if the target is within a gas giant, 
      o when attempted through a hex where a nuclear missile has exploded.
      o if target uses jamming.

      Neutrino detection:
      o If target\'s EMLevel is faint, give a -1 DM to neutrino scans.
      o If target\'s EMLevel is strong, give a +1 DM to neutrino scans.

      Densitometer detection:
      o If target is small, give a -1 DM to densitometer scans.
      o If target is large, give a +1 DM to densitometer scans.
      o Increase detection task difficulty by one level if detection is
attempted through a planet or moon with size 5+ or through a planetoid belt.

                            ADDENDUM, 29 July, 1990

      My second draft on starship combat rules is near complete. There are
some rules I would like to get a second opinion on.

      Damage record. I have made a damage record form: boxes are crossed off
when damage is taken. MegaTraveller starships tend to have large damage
numbers, so I had to make a new system for hit points for each starship
component. Two reasons: I wouldn\'t get space for 500,000+ boxes on one A4
page, and lower numbers are easier to calculate.

      Time and distance. I plan to scale down the time and distance scale in
starship combat from 20 minutes/25000km to 4 minutes/5000km. For longer combat
turns, more damage must be given for each hit. With the reduced damage my
system does, I feel it is right to reduce the time and distance scale.
      This would make some planet\'s occupy two hexes. Hexes adjacent to a
planet are atmosphere hexes. If a ship is out of control and heading for
planet, it will burn up in the atmosphere.

      Hit and Penetrate. The most drastic changes will be the hit and
penetration tasks. I feel the task is either too difficult or too easy. So,
here is my change: I will do the tasks rolled on percentile dice (D100). Take
DMs from the tables in the Referee\'s Manual as usual.

      To Hit:
      Chance to hit: 30% * (1+(OffDM-DefDM/100))
      Example: A craft with factor-9 missile bay and computer model/9 firing
at a target with a DefDM of +7 will get a hit percentage of 33%:
      30% + (1+(8+9-7)/100)% = 33%

      To Penetrate Defense:
      Chance to penetrate: 30% (1+(OffDM-DefDM)/100)
      Example: The same ship as above is attempting to penetrate a factor-9
repulsor.  the defending ship has a model/9 computer. The total chance is 29%.
      30% + (1+(9-9-5)/100

      To Penetrate Armor:
      Chance to Penetrate: 30% *(1+((Weapon UCP-(ArmorValue-40))/100)
      Example: The same ship as above attempts to penetrate an armor factor of
60. The total chance is 27%.
      30% * (1+ ((9-(60-40))/100)

      Exceptional Success: Given when the roll is 1/10th under the required
roll. Example: if the base chance to hit is 33%, a roll of 01-03 indicates
exceptional success. A roll of 01 on the task is always treated as exceptional
success.

      Fleet or Ship Tactics: Add these skill points to the attacker\'s
offensive DM on the hit task. Follow the standard rules for how many tactical
points can be pulled from the pool.
    Firing arcs: Something that MegaTraveller ships should have is firing
arcs, but this is not possible as the design system is today.

      Movement: I am inclined to make some changes in the movement rules.
      First, I want to make heading changes somewhat more difficult. As in
Interceptor or Leviathan, it costs thrust points to change heading. What I
want to do is require a certain number of hexes travelled at a given velocity
before allowing a one hex side course change. How many hexes to travel may
depend on both maneuver gee and/or agility. Using this rule would make it
appropriate to limit the arc of the spinal mount to forward.
      Second, I want a planet\'s gravitational pull to interfere with a ship\'s
heading, depending on a ship\'s velocity and a planet\'s size and gravity (like
in Mayday.)
      I\'m working hard on these rules, but I must admit that my knowledge in
this area is limited. I have not been able to come up with any easy, user-
friendly rules. If you have any good suggestions, I would like to hear them.

DAMAGE RESULTS

      Fuel Tank. I\'m going to change the "fuel tank shattered" to "fuel leak".
A certain amount of fuel will be lost per turn. Subsequent hits will make the
leak more severe.

      Hull Inoperative. There is no effect in the standard rules (or my
variant) for an inoperative hull, when that damage level is reached. My
suggestions are:
      y restrict craft to 1G
      y prohibit atmosphere entry
      y hull is breached
      y stress severely limits heading changes
      y Agility drops to zero
      y may not fire spinal mount
      y Craft may not be recovered. They may be launched.
      y Rapid Launch Facilities are inoperative.
      y Fuel leak.

      I would like to have your reflections on these suggestions. If you have
any better solutions, I would like to hear them. I hope it will turn out to be
a good set of rules which make starship more interesting and realistic.

	Well, the pirates could get weapons from independant planets or 
small empires, in return for not hitting their merchants. The pirates
could get them through the black market. Pirates could also get them from
attacking and capturing warships. 
	Could merchants do the same? Yes. Would they want to? Probably not.
Having military weapons on a civilain ship should be a severe offense. The
lightest punishment would be at least a Cr100,000 fine and confiscation of the
weapons (and the ship would have to stay put until the weapons were stripped,
losing the merchant money). A moderate punishment would be confiscation of the
*ship*. Jail terms are seperate, and could range to the time it takes the 
government to strip the weapons to life in prison (possibly at a work camp).
	I don\'t think that a pirate ship should be that much of a match for an
equal tonnage warship. Not that they should be pushovers either, but a 400 ton
patrol crusier should be able to defeat a 400 ton corsair, and so on.
	A pirate ship should be a threat to a merchant, but not to a warship.

playing with the trade and commerce rules.  It finally occured to me
that the profit on freight should be close to the profit on cargo.  If
not, then these things are money machines (but not for the owners).  

I looked through my spinward marches data and found two planets that
looked good, Efate and Louzy (sp?) Efate is Hi In Louzy is Hi In Na
Po.  Efate has a type A starport.  Here\'s the plan: Go to Efate by a
whole lot of cargo (at 1000cr per ton 4000 base -1000 for Hi -1000 for
In -1000 for Type A starport.)  Ship this as freight to Louzy (and
book yourself a high passage) Sell.  Assuming you have broker-4 (why
not, it\'s not terribly hard using MT advanced merchant character
generation) this sells on average for 14,000cr hey, look, you made
12,000 clean profit per ton.  We\'ll assume you start with say 30000cr
in initial funds, that\'s enough to buy and ship 5 tons of cargo and
buy a high passage each way.  Afterwards you will have 70,000cr.  You
make money like gangbusters while the ships captain can\'t because the
Louzy-Efate run sucks, but you don\'t have to pay to maintain the ship
on the way back.

If however we raise the price of freight, this will go away.  As long
as freight isn\'t competetive with trade, people will be able to make
lots of money shipping goods as freight.  If everybody wanted to do
this, the price of freight would go up.

Seems easier to me to fix the trade and commerce rules than to hack
the spaceship rules to make only merchant ships cheaper....

A Telescopic scope may be placed on a handgun just as on a rifle with the 
same skill table as for range.  At TL 8 a laser projection scope may be 
used.  The primary advantage of the laser scope is that it doesn\'t require 
a phase delay to look through a scope when you make your shot.
 I have never created \'smartgun\' rules for using a personal HUD. It would 
be an obvious developement.  I will get right on it...

Steve Higginbotham commented that my numbers for 
Fuel Usage on a fusion rocket were sensible for
what we can forsee now, but not for what we can
do in 3000 years.  This is not strictly true.

There\'s only so much energy available when you
take four hydrogen atoms and make helium.
That energy is the top-end, 100% best that you\'ll
ever get out of a fusion rocket.  The corrected
numbers for TL9 fusion rockets I gave are running
a significant fraction (50ish percent, if I remember
my source material right) of that maximum limit.
Engineering only lets you get closer to that limit,
not to pass it....

        Funny thing.  Once I carefully delineated the personality of
an off-the-wall AD&D character who was a wolf who had the power to 
change into a man, and was reasonably intelligent.  I based his behavior
on what I knew of wolves, and you know what?  About half-way thru,
I realized that his personality was almost identical to that described
for the Vargr.  I guess GDW didn\'t do half-bad after all in creating
the Vargr...

        That is why Steve once pointed out that the real profit will be
in shipping spec trade freight on someone else\'s ship, so no one would
build ships without some kind of subsidy, because you make less money
flying the ship and conducting spec trade than you do staying home and
sending it on someone else\'s ship.  In the Real World, freight prices
would go up until some kind of equity between supply and demand was
established.  In the Imperium, however... (see below).

        Except for one thing: based on the fixed prices in the game, and
other background information on how the Imperium fixes commerce to favor
itself and the megacorps, I assume that the freight & passenger prices
are fixed by Imperial Law.  
 
>Seems easier to me to fix the trade and commerce rules than to hack
>the spaceship rules to make only merchant ships cheaper....
        I like cheaper ships and low fixed commerce prices; other GMs 
might like expensive ships and variable (higher) commerce prices.  With
higher commerce costs and more expensive ships, the effect on your universe
will be to encourage worlds to be self-sufficient and to cut interstellar
traffic to a minimum.  Minimum would tend to be military and paramilitary 
and very high-priced commercial traffic to outposts that can\'t support 
themselves.  In such a case, commercial traffic will almost certainly be
in the hands of big corporations; very profitable, but not enough to go
around for the would-be free traders, even if they can afford to buy a
ship in the first place.  Not much room for PCs as free traders or 
others driving independent ships around space.  In fact, the picture looks
much like 2300AD, as far as interstellar traffic goes.
        With cheaper ships and variable commerce rates, which I mean to
try out come Hard Times, commerce rates for the established categories
(standard freight, high,middle,low passengers) will probably go up for
ships that are barely making a profit now, and come down for those that
are raking it in hand over fist.  I also plan on new, low-end categories
to appear: steerage -- more expensive than low berth, much less expensive
than middle passage -- but what you get is a bunk and a communal fresher.
I expect steerage to replace low berth, if low berths are no longer
required
by regulation, because low berth is the least profitable use of 0.5 tons
of ship space on the list.  With steerage, you don\'t need to pay a medic
to decant \'em, and you can cram in a *lot* more bunks than staterooms.
     With cheaper ships and low fixed prices, I think the picture remains 
the same as that assumed by most Traveller scenarios: lots of interstellar 
trade & traffic, lots of opportunities for PC shipowners.   Ships that 
can\'t make a profit under the fixed prices simply won\'t be built.

     Good point.  How about amending my rules to require 1 hardpoint per
range band beyond planetary for the longest ranged sensor array, booms et
al
same as before??  For example, if you had 
     ActEMS=Far Orbit, PassEMS=Substellar, ....
this sensor suite would require 5 hardpoints (or one boom) instead of 6.
 
Scott Kellogg also pointed out once that the folks at Challenge don\'t
appear
to "prep" their scenarios before publishing them.  Frankly, the MegaTrav
people at both GDW and Digest Group have provided ample evidence that they
have never heard of the term "blind play-testing" or don\'t know what it is
for if they have heard of it.  Since the publisher has failed to reality-
check (or sanity-check) his published scenarios, it behooves GMs to read
the
stuff with a VERY critical eye.  In the interests of TML GMs who don\'t have
time to pick apart that Challenge scenario with a fine-tooth comb before,
say, the weekend game, I am volunteering Steve to post some of his reviews
and analyses that he has been verbally relaying to me for the last ten 
years.  Bug him until he posts them.

     Mike, I presume you\'re talking about "Julian Protectorate" in
Challenge 49.
     You don\'t know how much it pleases me to hear someone express
appreciation for that.  It was really a labor of love.  Most of that
material was left over from Vilani & Vargr.  James Holden and I worked
closely in writing the Vargr side of that (although my credit was
overlooked...).
     I strongly agree with complaints about some of the slipshod
articles that get into Challenge.  Challenge was still a much
respected source of Traveller material when it transformed from JTAS,
but it declined quickly.
     In talking with others, at least those in HIWG, it seems likely
Challenge seldom gets quality Traveller material because they don\'t
print quality material.  People who really know their stuff and would
do it right loose their will to try because their work would just sit
along side trash.
     They need much tighter controls.  And if they\'re not getting what
they need, they should get the staff to fill the holes if nothing
else.
     Anyway, that\'s pretty much what we\'re having to do at IMPERIAL
LINES.  I\'m getting some good material, but I\'m having to do a lot of
the writing to keep the quality high.  I can\'t do that if we start
increasing the frequency or page count.  So I need submissions.
     For those of you not aware of this, IMPERIAL LINES is GDW\'s
Traveller newsletter.  We put it together for them; they print and
distribute it.  (I think the first issue is free.  You just have to
send a request.)  Issue #1 is out.  John Meyers just sent issue #2 to
GDW (or is about to).  This was our "Solomani & Aslan" issue, and I
think we really had our act together.
     Issue #3 will be "Vilani & Vargr". I have some left over material
for the Vilani side of Digest\'s V&V from Terry McInnes, and left over
Vargr material from your\'s truly.  But that\'s not enough. I encourage
queries.
     Issue #4 will probably be "Zhodani & Psionics."  I have two
people working on our first deck planned ship, the Noql class Zhodani
Frontier Trader (300 tons).  But that\'s the only bite I have.
     Issue #5 might be "Droyne and the Ancients."  But a year will
have past by that time. Fan feedback might well take us in a different
direction.
     We don\'t have any budget, so we can\'t pay you for your work.  But
if you\'re still interested, please write me at:

   Mike Mikesh; 3124 75th Avenue, #3; Landover, Maryland 20785-1920

Articles have to be short -- less than 1000 words.  We only have 8
pages to work with per issue at the moment.  Adventure ideas are what
I need most, like Random Nuggets, or 76 Patrons, or Lee\'s Guide.
Short discussion topics are good.  Use Twilight 2000 rules where you
can.
     Ships and vehicles ... maybe.  There is a ready supply of those.
What I\'d like to see are things that don\'t require unique circum-
stances to be encountered, yet are still interesting.
     I look forward to hearing from you.

E-Tek was the name of the company that sold "Personal Heads Up Battle
Field Display Technology".  It was really cool stuff dependending on
what tech level you bought the equipment at.  Characters tended to get
very nervous when they found out the heavies had E-Tek gear, much more
than if little red dots showed up over vital spots.  (Laser sights)

Tech 9 to 11:
	Bulky stuff, mostly good for attachment to combat armor and
	vac suits.  Cables connect to the weapon sight.  Sights tend
	to be \'mono-purpose\', either regular sights, infra-red, or
	light enhancement units.
Tech 12 to 13:
	Less bulky than previously.  Some units are equipped with
	radio rebroadcasters so that a command unit can watch over the
	platoon.  Still requires a helmet to be able to use; however,
	the helmet does not have to be connected to combat armor or a
	vac suit.  \'Multi-purpose\' sights sights are introduced, with
	a switch to change between regular sights, infra-red, and
	light enhancement mode.
Tech 14:
	Helmet is replaced with \'wrap-around sunglasses\' type display
	unit.  The user\'s body is used for transmitting the
	information between the weapon sight and the display.
	Additional electronics are added to optimize the display
	regardless of the light conditions.
Tech 15+:
	The helmet is completely replaced with contact lenses or
	optical implants depending upon the $$, tech level and whim of
	the referee.  Additional information can be obtained from
	battlefield computers, IFF data, grid location, range and
	distance, etc.

For additional cost and weight sighting capabilities can be obtained
for the next tech level bracket.  For example on a tech 10 planet you
could buy a rather bulky unit that has is switchable between regular
sights, infra-red or light enhancement mode.

Oh, you wanted prices and weights?  I have that somewhere.  It is
more than likely in the same place as my 4.3bsd release tape.

I need a better way to convert everything to online format.

>(yes, yes, I know: we\'ve had this argument before...)

Also not hostorically accurate. Things may change in the future (have
changed in the future??) but the military is a *very* conservative
group at least for the infantry. Troops are not equipped with the
most advanced weaponry available, though civilians tend to be.
Case in point: Your civial war, the Union and Confederate Soldiers
were mostly equipped with breech-loading (I believe) rifles, while the
civilians had repeating rifles available to them.

I know the discussion is concerning starships, but currently civilians
cannot aquire armed aircraft (which is the closest analogy to starships).
In the future I could see merchants/pirates having the latest weapon 
systems on their ships while the militray minds take 1TL to fully test and
try out the new weapons before making large commitments to installing them
on their fleets.

Last time I looked, energy available from fusion of four 
hydrogen atoms to one helium is on the order of 0.7% 
conversion, which gives a theoretical Isp of 3,660,000 
or so.  Which is a WHOLE LOT more than twice what you 
allowed, George...

Presumably, this reduces the bonus if you hold on target w/o firing...yes?
Otherwise, in a firefight I would fire as soon as I have a good target, which
might be half a second after target aquisition.  Is a half second enough
warning for someone in non-powered armor to move, given the delays of nerve
impulse propagation speed and the need to analyze incoming data, etc?

I can see the bonus reduction for powered armor because you could set an
automatic circuit to jump, (although that could be bad in certain
situations...) when it registers enemy laser sights.  However, if you are
relying on the operator to take action, you have the same problem of delay
while the wearer analyzes the data and decides on which direction to move.

     Well, the first war in this TCS PBEM seems to be off to a good
start.  As of now, everyone in the game should have heard about the
fighting, so it is a good time to talk about lessons learned in that
fighting to date.
 
 
     The first, and most obvious, lesson is that fighters, if used, need
to be big, tough, and expensive.  There have been three battles
involving fighters on both sides, and two others involving fighters on
only one side (you know who you are/were).  In every case, the weaker
fighters failed to accomplish ANYTHING against their opposite numbers,
while the good fighters wiped the floor with their opponents.  In all
three cases, the stronger fighters were fighting at long odds, and still
managed to inflict unacceptable casualties on their enemies.  
 
     In the two cases where fighters were only present on one side, the
fighters that were more technologically sophisticated than the heavies
on the other side (good show, New Home!) did quite well.  Where the
fighters were less well designed (that\'s you, Neubayern), they were
completely ineffective.
 
     And the factor most decisive in determining fighter effectiveness
was, of course, computer number.  New Home\'s model-7 computers beat up
on Sansterre\'s model-5\'s, which in turn beat up on Neubayern\'s
model-3\'s.
 
     Players not directly involved  might consider where their fighters
fit onto this chain, and redesign as necessary (yes, all you guys that
"Jane\'s" said had lousy fighters really did have lousy fighters!).
 
 
     Second lesson:  If you have a whole solar system to attack/defend,
then GDW\'s standard picture of the Imperium at war goes out the window. 
So far, defense of the gas giant has NEVER been a factor in any
engagement.  In all cases, attackers appeared at 100 diameters from the
main world, and ignored the existance of the gas giants.  In-flight
refueling capabilities have played a major part in all offensive
operations to date.
 
     And, defending gas giants is proving to be almost impossible
anyway.  After forces are deployed to protect the homeworld, and more
are sent out to carry the war to the enemy, it is becoming obvious that
a force deployed at the gas giant would either (1) be totally useless as
the enemy ignored the gas giant, or (2) be totally overwhelmed if the
enemy DID attack the gas giant.  
 
     If you choose to attack, and defend your homeworld, and defend your
gas giant(s), and defend your colony worlds, then you will disperse your
fleet into enough small pieces that even a weak enemy can overwhelm one
set of defenders at a time, and so trash your fleet in detail.
 
 
     Third lesson:  This one hit me totally out of left field (I
expected the first two from previous experience doing this).  It seems
that the presence/absence of meson technology makes a bigger difference
than I thought.  Conventional Wisdom (mine included) has it that a
battle-rider is more than a match for a battleship.  This seems to be
only true for meson armed fleets.
 
     In this game, so far, the ships have been armoured sufficiently to
prevent free critical hits from happening.  So the only damage done to
most ships before one side bugs out due to heavy losses is that the
maneuver drives and weapons are knocked out.  Jump drives and power
plants and computers are not being hit, due to armour sufficient to keep
out the interior explosions, and fib computers.
 
     When that happens, the battleships jump home for repairs.  The
riders left behind are captured and destroyed.  In all five cases, ships
have been disabled, but jumped to safety (even on the losing side).  The
winning side has then proceeded to capture/destroy all the riders left
disabled by the fleeing losers.  So the lost riders are being replaced
at a cost of billions and years, where the lost battleships/cruisers are
being repaired at trivial cost in a few weeks.
 
     This has not yet made a crucial difference, since the war has not
been going on for years yet.  But Sansterre\'s battleships have already
acquitted themselves well in THREE separate engagements, after having
been disabled in EACH engagement.  The same cannot be said for the
riders deployed by any of the sides so far.  In all cases, rider
casualties to the loser have been extremely high (near 100%), and the
winners have suffered the same fate for the riders as for their
battleships - they are recovered and repaired for use later this year. 
This is all very well if you can make sure you win EVERY fight your
riders are in, but it could get a lot tougher if you win a few, lose a
few.
 
     So it is fairly safe to say that in battles between fleets armed
with particle-beams and missiles (lasers/energy weapons are trivial so
far, just as they are in traditional Imperial doctrine) that the
jump-capable battleships and cruisers have a considerable long-term
advantage over the non-jump-capable riders.
 
TCS players:  read and heed this!  Your fleets may be on the line next.

Hi, I\'m the person who ran on at the mouth about mag bearings.  I\'m on
vacation right now, and probably won\'t be back on a computer until next
monday.  So...in the meantime, can you email me some more details on
what exactly you are thinking of?  In general, if you can take advantage
of gyroscopic effects, balancing becomes not hard at all.  Also, If you
want, you can float a rotating mass inside a mag field, and since it has
no physical restraints (vs mag forces), by filtering our the fundamental
frequency of rotation, it will balance about its center of inertia - which
may not be what you\'re after.  A rotoating mass balanced about its center
of inertia will hardly vibrate at all, where a rotating mass balanced 
about its geometric center (like those confined by mechanical bearings)
will be centered, but will vibrate more.  So which is more important to
you: a centered hub or a vibration free hub?  I don\'t think you can get
both and not violate physics as we know it now.

I\'m cross-posting this to the TML, by the way.

I look forward to hearing from you!

	If the attacker is snap-shooting, the laser sensors don\'t help.
For the person in non-powered armor, the sensors simply give a distinct warning 
beep. If you wish, you might want to make the character roll his dex or
less on 2d6 in order to get the modfier (sorry, MT people, I\'m not going
to define a task for this :-) ). Note that a person in non-powered armor
only reduces the LTS bonuses by 1 if the LTS is detected. The person will
probably move whatever direction he can -- low reaction time, unpredictable
enough that the firer can\'t completely compensate.

	Powered armor would probably have it set to automatically react,
though it could be overridden by the soldier in the armor. If using the
soldier\'s reactions, and not the powered armor\'s, there is only a -1 modifer.

Briefly, the magnetic flux through a superconductor has to remain constant,
which leads to what is known as the "Meissner effect".  If you move a 
magnet close to a superconductor, the superconductor will repel the magnet
as if it were a magnetic monopole of the opposite polarity.  There are two 
ways to make a maglev bearing: either take a superconducting shell or donut
and put a magnet in the center, or take a magnetic shell or donut and put
a superconductor in the center.  Take such a widget and put it in a vacuum,
and you have about as close to a frictionless bearing as you can get.

Granted, back in the days of olden piratery, merchant ships *were* heavily

Also, this seems to run contrary to most of the \'classic\' science fiction:

The only way I can see most merchant craft being well-armed is if there is
such rampant piracy that the Navy can\'t handle it. You could, perhaps, get
the government to grant you papers to carry weapons, armor, and sensors
as good as the military, but then your ship would be classed as an auxillary
naval vessel, and could be pressed into service whenever the Navy needed it...

A note or two about the recent suggestions for weapon add-ons....

First off, I would argue that for gaming purposes as well as practicality
reasons, there should be stacking limits as to how many cumulative pluses
you can add to a gun, and furthermore that these pluses are capped by the
user\'s innate skill. Putting a laser sight AND HUD AND smartgun link AND
telescopic sight AND everything else on a gun eventually gets ridiculous.

Furthermore, Refs must be careful as to how much TL advancement they want
to allow in the development of these systems, before game balance goes 
straight out the window. In a recent game I ran, one character had an
integral smartgun link wired to a cybernetic enhancement of his own brain;
this allowed him (among other things) to sweep an auto-gauss-gun across
a crowd of people on full auto, scanning ahead of the barrel\'s trajectory
and momentarily interrupting the flow of hot lead as he passed over 
friendlies. Because the target acquisition, identification, calculation
of trajectory and fire interrupts were carried out in terms of machine
cycles (milliseconds at most), the overall effect was a two-second burst
from the gun, after which twenty perps dropped dead in the arms of six 
VERY confused PCs.

If one installs a robot brain in the gun itself (not an unreasonable
extension of the idea) then things get even tougher to manage. I
wasn\'t sure whether to be amused or upset when a visitor to our game
talked at great length about wanting to introduce such a system,
whereupon he described "Smith" and "Wesson" from BUCK GODOT, ZAP GUN
FOR HIRE (not what I\'d call Traveller-grade hard SF).

On the defensive side, a person in or out of armor about to be shot at
with a gun is not the same as a fighter plane about to be shot at with
a missile. Defensive alerts are idiotic--they add sensory distraction
without the hope of added defense. The point of armor is to stop
damage from getting through to the user, not to let him dodge bullets
and lasers (shades of STAR WARS!). Even if you could design an armor
suit that could sense and dodge for you, it\'d probably hamstring the
user in the process unless he plans to just lie there limply and let
the suit do the moving for him....

The advantages of these high-tech doodads are limited overall by the
person carrying the gun, and should be handled accordingly. I have no
trouble with a small aiming laser on ANY weapon above TL8; for $100
you can buy a real HeNe laser pointer the size of a pencil at any
Sharper Image store.  Mounting a telescopic sight or IR sight, or at
higher TLs a camera and HUD uplink, is also OK, but not in all cases:
a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and the best HUD system
is not going to let you snap-shoot any faster or hit a target beyond
the reasonable rated range of your gun. I subscribe to the KISS
principle: Keep It Simple Stupid. Laser pointers let you instantly
determine aim, and improve snapfire and aimed fire. HUD links help
aimed fire designate targets, but I dare someone to try to snap fire
AND use such a targeting system without becoming nauseous. (Think
about it: you\'re fast-drawing your gun and trying to get a sensible
picture from the camera mounted on the barrel, which is moving at an
enormous angular velocity? By the time you could focus you\'d be dead.)
This is especially important when people try to mount all of this
stuff on pistols. Common sense should rule all such things, and
weenies who insist on the latest cybertoys should be politely directed
to the Cyberpunk game going on in the next county.

    'body' => 'Good (insert time of day) Folks,

A few days back, Steve and Hans mentioned the idea of using the Active EMS
or EMS Jammers as a cloaking device.  Well, sorry to get back to it so late,
but I just thought you might wanna know that this is (of course) impossible.

The hope would be that you could emmit an electro magnetic wave pattern
identical to the ships normal pattern but out of phase with it in such a
manner as to create a destructive interferance pattern.  Well, that is
I\'m afraid, just not possible.

There is an analogous short story by Arthur C. Clarke called "Silence, Please."
Which appears in "Tales From the White Hart" (Excellent stuff).  The idea
there is not EM radiation, but sound waves.  (Much easier to deal with.)
So, let\'s look at the problems with that.

In order to create such an interferance pattern, one would have to know, the
exact position of the listener (to within a wavelength of the sound in
question) as well as how they were moving to take doppler shift into account.
Now you might be able to do that for ONE observer, but if the observer moved,
even slightly, the effect would be lost.

I believe in some airliner designs they were talking about using speakers in
the cabin to make zones of destuctive interferance around passengers heads to
drown out the sound of the aircrafts engines (Unducted fans.)  The system was
going to block out just the sound of the engines.  However the silence zones
were only localized to the region of the passengers head.  There were speakers
placed in the chairs headrest.  But it was not possible to get the entire
fusilage of the plane to be such a zone.

Now, to attempt this with light, you might be able to fool one observer, BUT
you would have to know their EXACT position.  To within a wavelength of light,
ie down to nanometer acurracy.  You would have to know their EXACT speed
relative to you to account for doppler shift.  Now, with the ranges of space
combat being what they are, there is NO way you could know this.  And if you
did, you might as well fire your weapons, cause your sensor accuracy would 
have to be enough to count every cell in the pilot\'s body.

Furthermore, even if you did manage to fool their passive EMS like this, you
would still run afoul of their densiometers and neutrino sensors.  And there
is no way to spoof a neutrino sensor.  If you built a decoy drone to spoof it
you would have to install a similar size power plant in order to get it
to fool anyone.  (Several million credits for a decoy drone?)  Nope.

Yes, we have no cloaking devices.
We have no cloaking devices today.  :-)

With low TL, energy weapons are much more expensive because of powerplant
costs.  And with Nuclear Dampers being allowed only at the lowest level,
nuclear warhead can pack quite a punch.

RE: Battleriders

How do Meson weapons make a difference?

I think a lot of Battlerider losses may have to do more with tactics.  In any
battle the losing side will take high losses, especially if there are not
provisions for rescuing survivors.  Admittedly, having fewer Jump Drives makes
fewer ships being able to flee on their own, but theoretically the battleriders
should be going onto battle outnumbering the other side because of
cost effectivness.  It helps to know when to pull out, too.

It\'s no surprise that computers make a big difference, once you are past a
minimal ship, there\'s no point in not putting the biggest computer in it.  If
it won\'t fit, make the ship bigger.  Since a computer adds both to defense and
offense, it make a big difference.

Is there any point in making a ship bigger then necessary to carry the biggest
spinal mount & biggest computer & 6G & highest armor, etc?

It makes no sense to me that Traveller does not allow multiple systems use, ie
multiple Maneuver drive, Power Plant, etc.

No.  If it out of phase here, it will still be so there, assuming that
the signal is an exact copy of the incoming.  And if you match the
wavelength incident where you are, the doppler shift will shift it
right along with the original signal you are trying to mask.

Nonsense.  Are you suggesting that I have to know your exact position
for you to SEE me?  If you can see me, then I can flash a light in
your eyes.  And if the light were just so, then you wouldn\'t see me
any more.  If you assume (and you have so far) that the sensor arrays
are all over the hull, then you could get a pretty good copy by
generating a counter-signal at each point on the array to match
incident EM at that point.  It won\'t be perfect, by any means (unless
technology improves in 3500 years - a long shot, some people think),
but it will be better than letting them see you without even trying to
hide.

I never said we could spoof their densitometers and neutrino sensors. 
But Rob Dean pointed out recently (from TD #3?) that the operational
parameters for a densitometer were envisioned such that detection
range would be less than 5000Km.  And you can monkey with neutrino
sensors by EMMasking your ship, but not your drone, or by using a
reaction that produces more neutrinos in the drone...

But will we in 3500+ years?  THAT is the question!
 
And I never suggested a cloaking device.  Hans inferred that.  I was
suggesting something to make you ship HARDER to detect, not
impossible.

This is all sound stuff.  By producing a destructive interferance pattern
in a confined box, (the muffler) it greatly reduces noise.

Correct, but computers won\'t solve the problem as presented there.

Ok, Light comes in and is reflected off the hull.  In order to be able to
destructively interfere with that reflection, you will have to know not only
the freqency of that light, but its polarization as well.  If you can\'t get
the polarization correct you won\'t be able to interfere with it at all.
Sunlight is randomly polarized.  There is no way to get it to match something
that is totally random.  But let\'s say for the moment that you do know the
polarization and the freqency.

You then pick up and measure each and every freqency of light coming in and
send it back out out of phase.  Now, observer A is travelling alongside the
ship at the same speed.  Observer B is approaching at some speed.  The ship
emmits light and disappears from view of observer A.  Observer B, however
sees the light that is reflected at it\'s normal freqency and the light that
is emmitted by the ship with it\'s freqency doppler shifted.  Thus, Observer A
can\'t see the ship, but Observer B can.

}I don\'t believe that 3000 years additional research
}won\'t be able to come up with a better result.

It can with nice long wavelengths and an unpolarized vibration like sound,
but not with light.

EM (electro magentic) masking takes care of EM radiation.  Not nuclear
radiation.  It will do absolutely nothing to neutrino emmissions.  And
as far as I know, neutrinos are only emmitted in certain nuclear reactions.
(fusion, and fission I believe)  Those would certainly be the easiest way
to get a source of neutrinos.  And fusion/fission plants are expensive.


}And I never suggested a cloaking device.  Hans inferred that.  I was

Well, using the above technology might allow you to reduce your signature
somewhat, at least in terms of the amount of light your ship emmits.  You\'d
have to make certain all the freqencies and polarizations of your ship were
matched by your cloaking emmitters.  But it *might* be able to reduce your
emmitted signature.  It won\'t work against incident light, but maybe.
But then again, this sounds exactly like what the EMMasking is supposed to be
able to do.

Maybe what you\'ve been describing is the EMMask not EMS-Jam.  We never have
had *any* explanation as to how EM Masking is supposed to work.

If I remember right, Laser Sensors in Striker where used to activate Anti-
Laser Smoke to cover the vehicle.  Also detection of incoming laser 
targetig on a 3+ was only for High Tech Level setups, lower tech levels had 
higher rolls to make for detection.

Question:  Is a personal laser sensor a special suit that a person wears?  
I can understand laser sensors built into battle dress, or even combat 
armor.  Laser Sensors would need to cover a majority of the person\'s body 
for them to be effective, otherwise people would begin to target non-
sensor covered areas of the body.

Meson Guns and the best computers are everything.  The extra
hits spinal meson guns get for size are not reduced by armor, so
they decide the battle.  The best computers you have TL to make
should be in EVERY boat -- right down to the fighters.  For the smaller
units, put in 1 main, and 2 smaller backup computers to lower the cost.
Once a fighter gets hit it is usually toast anyway, so there is no real need
for backup on them.

ABSTRACT
     Variant starship combat rules. Fighters have more chance to knock out a
     battleship, but only if they are in large formations. Ships or fighters
     with armor-120 can now be damaged by weapons smaller than factor-T.



      This is a variant to the existing starship combat rules. I\'ll discuss
each segment of the combat rules separately with tables. These rules provide
fighters more chance to knock out a battleship, but only if they operate in
large formations.
      A fighter with factor-3 pulse lasers firing at a battleship with armor
of factor 100+ can just give up. There ins\'t any chance this puny craft can
make a dent in the hull. Even large formations don\'t have a chance.
      The rules work both ways. Nothing prevents one from creating a fighter
with armor-120 except for the cost. The fighter can still have a speed of 6G
and possibly some agility depending on armament. Such an armored fighter will
be nearly indestructible. A weapon of factor T+ is required to get a critical
hit against an armor factor of 120.

      To Hit. The to hit task is not changed - it works good enough as it is.
      Optional: Those who hate to roll each battery may roll once for all
bearing batteries. Subtract the difficulty value to hit from the roll, and
multiply the remainder by 10%. This indicates how many batteries hit.
      Example: The to hit task is Difficult, 11+. The attacker rolls 15.
      (15-11) * 10% = 40% of the batteries hit.
      When applying the 40% to the number of firing batteries, round up.

      Penetration. The penetration task is not changed.
      Optional: When using the optional to hit method discussed above, the
defender may combine the defensive batteries bearing. Find the ration of
offensive vs defensive batteries and consult the following table.

      Off/Def
      4:1 gives DM +3   Add the DMs given here to the attacker\'s
      3:1 gives DM +2   task roll. Ratios which exceed 4:1 or 1:4
      2:1 gives DM +1   are treated as 4:1 or 1:4 respectively.
      1:1 gives DM  0
      1:2 gives DM -1
      1:3 gives DM -2
      1:4 gives DM -3

      Use the same procedure as in the to hit task to determine how many
weapons penetrated. This precedure can be used against screens, but the ratio
DM from the table above is not included.
2. Damage Point Computation
      The component hit points computed during design evaluation are not used
in the current combat rules. This variant uses them.
      First, we will compute the damage points each type of weapons does.
      Turret mounted weapons do 10*UCP in damage. A bay weapon does 20*UCP in
damage. Spinal mounts do 100*UCP in damage.
      Nuclear and anti-matter do four times the precalculated damage. Example:
a UCP-3 turret firing nuclear missiles does 120 points of damage ((3*10)*4).

      Now we are going to compute how much beating each ship component before
the damage has an effect. The following examples use the Imperial Planet-class
Heavy Cruiser from Rebellion Sourcebook, using the corrected UCP available in
Clay Bush\'s HD 1703.

      Hull. To find out when the armor factor is reduced, divide the
inoperative value by the armor factor. The Planet has an inoperative hull
value of 67500 and an armor factor of 50. Each 1350 hits received reduce the
armor factor by one.
      There is a snag in that craft with high armor values will drop faster
than craft with low armor value. To negate this we will reduce received with
1% per armor value above 40. Also, damage is increased with one point for each
armor value below 40.
      Each time an interior hit is scored, apply half the hit damage to the
hull. If a shot penetrates armor, it will always give at least one damage
point to the hull.

      Power plant. Divide the inoperative number by ten to determine how many
hits the power plant can take before before losing 10% of its output. With
5140 points, the Planet takes 514 hits before power output is reduced 10%.
      For each 10% lost reduce the ship\'s agility by one.
      When 50% of the power plant has been lost, the spinal mount is
inoperative. The ship captain chooses either to maneuver or to fire energy
weapons (not both) in a turn.

      Manuever. Divide inoperative number by acceleration in G to determine
how many hits the maneuver plant can take before the maneuver G is reduced by
one. The 5063 hit points divided by 2G gives 2532 hits to reduce the rating by
one G. (The old system reduced acceleration by factors of one, two, or three.
With this system the maneuver plant will last longer.)
      Jump. As maneuver.
      Computer. I had trouble making damage plausible without being too
devastating. Weapons with a UCP of 1-4 give "Computer-1", UCP of 5-9 gives
"Computer-2", and UCP-A gives "Computer-3." On exceptional success reduce the
computer factor by an additional one. Radiation hits have no effect on fib
computers.
      Sensors. As computer hits.
      Weapons. As computer hits. If there is only one battery, reduce the
battery\'s UCP by the appropriate number.
      Screens. As weapon hits.
      Crew. One crew section is killed for each 100 damage points inflicted on
internal systems. A weapon which inflicts 80 damage points applies 40 to the
hull, and the remaining 40 kills one crew section. 120 points applied to crew
will kill two crew sections.

3. Applying Hits
      Hull. For internal hits, apply 50% of the damage points to the hull. If
the weapon does 100 damage points, apply 50 to the hull.
      Radiation hits. When a weapon which does radiation damage hits, apply
25% of the damage points to the radiation hit table. A factor-9 missile bay
firing nuclear missiles inflicts 720 damage points. If an internal hit is
scored, apply 360 points to the hull, 180 points to the radiation table, and
180 points to the internal explosions table.
      Critical hits. Per the standard rules. When the armor factor is reduced.
Remember to reduce the hull inoperative number in the process.
4. Armor Penetration Procedure

      Under the standard rules there is no hope that a low UCP weapon can
penetrate or do any kind of damage to a well-armored craft. In this variant
there is a slight chance that fighters and SDBs can dent the armor and
possibly scratch inside a battleship.

      To penetrate armor:
      Routine, Off=(weapon UCP/3), Def=((armor-40)/5), Confontration
      Referee: Meson guns do not roll this task. If they oenetrate
configuration, they just pass through the armor and explode inside.
      A natural 12 means automatic penetration of the armor. Drop fractions
when dividing weapon UCP and armor. Armor factors below 40 will give a DM in
the attcaker\'s favor.

- -      1    if black globe operating
      +1    if nuclear, anti-matter, or spinal mount weapon
Spinal mounts: as per standard rules, spinal mounts get one additional roll
      for each UCP factor above 9. Each roll inflicts UCP*100 damage points.

Black globes: A black globe absorbs a percentage of the damage value according
      to its flicker rate. A globe on 40% flicker absorbs 40% of all damage
      points before they take effect. Overload is by the standard rules.^L6. Exceptional Success
      For each point achieved above the required difficulty, add 10% to the
damage points inflicted by the weapon.
      Attacker rolls 13 (including DMs) for a weapon which inflicts 100 damage
points. Increase the damage points by 20% to 120 before black globe and damage
takes effect.
      [CRB: I think this applies to the to hit task. I disagree with
increasing damage for each point above the difficulty throw needed. A miss
inflicts no damage. Why should most hits inflict extra damage?]

7. Optional Sensor Rules
      Make all sensor tasks one level less difficult if the target is in an
adjacent hex.

      Make active sensor tasks one level more difficult:
      o if the target is within a gas giant, 
      o when attempted through a hex where a nuclear missile has exploded.
      o if target uses jamming.

      Neutrino detection:
      o If target\'s EMLevel is faint, give a -1 DM to neutrino scans.
      o If target\'s EMLevel is strong, give a +1 DM to neutrino scans.

      Densitometer detection:
      o If target is small, give a -1 DM to densitometer scans.
      o If target is large, give a +1 DM to densitometer scans.
      o Increase detection task difficulty by one level if detection is
attempted through a planet or moon with size 5+ or through a planetoid belt.

                            ADDENDUM, 29 July, 1990

      My second draft on starship combat rules is near complete. There are
some rules I would like to get a second opinion on.

      Damage record. I have made a damage record form: boxes are crossed off
when damage is taken. MegaTraveller starships tend to have large damage
numbers, so I had to make a new system for hit points for each starship
component. Two reasons: I wouldn\'t get space for 500,000+ boxes on one A4
page, and lower numbers are easier to calculate.

      Time and distance. I plan to scale down the time and distance scale in
starship combat from 20 minutes/25000km to 4 minutes/5000km. For longer combat
turns, more damage must be given for each hit. With the reduced damage my
system does, I feel it is right to reduce the time and distance scale.
      This would make some planet\'s occupy two hexes. Hexes adjacent to a
planet are atmosphere hexes. If a ship is out of control and heading for
planet, it will burn up in the atmosphere.

      Hit and Penetrate. The most drastic changes will be the hit and
penetration tasks. I feel the task is either too difficult or too easy. So,
here is my change: I will do the tasks rolled on percentile dice (D100). Take
DMs from the tables in the Referee\'s Manual as usual.

      To Hit:
      Chance to hit: 30% * (1+(OffDM-DefDM/100))
      Example: A craft with factor-9 missile bay and computer model/9 firing
at a target with a DefDM of +7 will get a hit percentage of 33%:
      30% + (1+(8+9-7)/100)% = 33%

      To Penetrate Defense:
      Chance to penetrate: 30% (1+(OffDM-DefDM)/100)
      Example: The same ship as above is attempting to penetrate a factor-9
repulsor.  the defending ship has a model/9 computer. The total chance is 29%.
      30% + (1+(9-9-5)/100

      To Penetrate Armor:
      Chance to Penetrate: 30% *(1+((Weapon UCP-(ArmorValue-40))/100)
      Example: The same ship as above attempts to penetrate an armor factor of
60. The total chance is 27%.
      30% * (1+ ((9-(60-40))/100)

      Exceptional Success: Given when the roll is 1/10th under the required
roll. Example: if the base chance to hit is 33%, a roll of 01-03 indicates
exceptional success. A roll of 01 on the task is always treated as exceptional
success.

      Fleet or Ship Tactics: Add these skill points to the attacker\'s
offensive DM on the hit task. Follow the standard rules for how many tactical
points can be pulled from the pool.
    Firing arcs: Something that MegaTraveller ships should have is firing
arcs, but this is not possible as the design system is today.

      Movement: I am inclined to make some changes in the movement rules.
      First, I want to make heading changes somewhat more difficult. As in
Interceptor or Leviathan, it costs thrust points to change heading. What I
want to do is require a certain number of hexes travelled at a given velocity
before allowing a one hex side course change. How many hexes to travel may
depend on both maneuver gee and/or agility. Using this rule would make it
appropriate to limit the arc of the spinal mount to forward.
      Second, I want a planet\'s gravitational pull to interfere with a ship\'s
heading, depending on a ship\'s velocity and a planet\'s size and gravity (like
in Mayday.)
      I\'m working hard on these rules, but I must admit that my knowledge in
this area is limited. I have not been able to come up with any easy, user-
friendly rules. If you have any good suggestions, I would like to hear them.

DAMAGE RESULTS

      Fuel Tank. I\'m going to change the "fuel tank shattered" to "fuel leak".
A certain amount of fuel will be lost per turn. Subsequent hits will make the
leak more severe.

      Hull Inoperative. There is no effect in the standard rules (or my
variant) for an inoperative hull, when that damage level is reached. My
suggestions are:
      y restrict craft to 1G
      y prohibit atmosphere entry
      y hull is breached
      y stress severely limits heading changes
      y Agility drops to zero
      y may not fire spinal mount
      y Craft may not be recovered. They may be launched.
      y Rapid Launch Facilities are inoperative.
      y Fuel leak.

      I would like to have your reflections on these suggestions. If you have
any better solutions, I would like to hear them. I hope it will turn out to be
a good set of rules which make starship more interesting and realistic.

Ok, maybe we don\'t have the whole picture, (neutrinos won\'t fall under the
Grand Unified Field Theory though)

But we do have to try to make Trav stick to what physics we DO know without
having to resort to too many black boxes that mysteriously do things. 
Well,
at least *I* do.

And in my book, a particle that can travel through the entire mass of the
sun
and the earth without so much as a blink is going to laugh at any sort of
shielding available at TL 15.

Conceded.  I do too.  I also assume that what we know is the BEGINNING of
the
level of knowledge of Traveller (or any other future game), not the end of
it.

So, how do they detect them?  At TL15, they have a neutrino sensor that can
(presumably) detect a 10KW neutrino source at a range of a light second or
more.  Neutrinos are producd as a result of the interaction of VERY high
energy photons converting to positrons and electrons and then to lower
energy
photons and neutrinos (at least so the Navy Nuclear Power program said). 
This
happens to a small extent in fission and fusion, but neither fission nor
fusion produces enough neutrinos to make a MODERN (mutli ten-thousand
gallon)
neutrino detector show anything.  SO how is it done?  Obviously, if the
neutrino sensors in MT work, the technology of the period must have
SOMETHING
that can stop a neutrino with reasonable (50%? 10%? 90%?) certainty.  If
you
assume that neutrinos are unstoppable, then MT\'s neutrino sensors are
unworkable, and the problem of avoiding detection by them is moot.
 
As you may have noticed, I prefer working on the assumption that existing
elements of the game IMPLY the level of knowledge of the game universe.  I
only throw things out when they are IMPOSSIBLE.  And I don\'t define
impossible
by OUR level of knowledge today.  I don\'t like the "We can\'t do it, so it
can
never be done" attitude.
     Though why we are arguing about this I will never know, since I
consider
the subject silly, and you obviously do too.  Alas...

That means that you have to detect the photon and in less than 1/f

microwaves begin in the gigahertz region, this gives you 10e-9 seconds
to send out the out-of phase photon.  Visible light is much harder.

It strikes me this is a bit difficult.

For a potent sighting system, see the battlefield sight on the gauss rifle

I do like the idea of the sensors automatically setting off anti-laser

Nuc dampers do the strong force only, but a strongly focused gravity
field (the kind used to make "superdense") should be able to do it.

That\'s the name of the exercise: explain what they did in some
sensible way.  There\'s no point in saying it isn\'t possible (unless
you plan to start playing a different game), but there is much karmic
benefit to figuring out how it could be done (and politely assuming
that GDW thought of it, instead of being the idiots we all know they
are) :)

The Near Star List gives its coordinates as X -28.4, Y 19.8, Z 32.1. 
It\'s on the map on the back cover, about an inch and a half above Xi 
Ursae Majoris.  That does imply that the Pentapods have pretty extensive 
star-faring culture. A visit would be very interesting.

well, it certainly was beyond the scope of a map last time I looked 
it up in the catalog.  Typo?
And I am moderately certain, based on other descriptions in CHallenges
and other places that humans have never gone to the P-pod homeworld, 
or even very far into P-pod space.  I gather that after the P-pods were
encountered, human exploration in that direction stopped cold, and hasn\'t
moved since.

There really isn\'t much EVERYONE has seen.  Lots of message traffic 
(mostly secret), and movement orders (likewise).  After the first 
year passes, I will post a summary, for those who are interested.  And
anyone (except players) who want an unedited version of the message 
traffic to/from a particular (or all) system(s) is welcome to it.
 
I will send along a description of the Battles AFTER an armistice is 
signed (no need to give out free intell to one of the participants).

     We do that NOW with STEALTH technology.  Take a close look at the two
different (but both effective) approaches used by the F-117A and YF-22 & 
YF-23 Advanced Tactical Fighters.  As usual, Traveller falls behind reality
in ignoring Stealth, which reduces PASSIVE signature, not active.

     ...and in WWI, the same kind of selectivity with regard to a machine
gun burst and an intervening object (the prop) was implemented using an
interrupter gear.  TL 5 technology.  I rather like the idea presented 
above; gives me some notions I hadn\'t thought of of what truly advanced
weapon technology might be able to do.

     Yep.  An idiot with the power of a god is still an idiot, to badly
paraphrase a certain Amber character.  I find a high Tactics skill is far
more important than any amount of technology; a clever player with a
body pistol is more dangerous than an idiot with an FGMP (to his 
enemies, I mean).

     But Mike, the weenies don\'t want to be in the Cyberpunk game where 
all their enemies are just as heavily armed... that would be dangerous.
See Rule #1 above.
     Seriously, I do *NOT* understand this prejudice against realistic
cybertechnology -- yes, *realistic*.  The cyber/computer technology 
depicted in "cyberpunk" and other near-future science fiction is the most
likely and realistic technology I\'ve seen yet in Traveller -- so you
dislike that and prefer jump drives/gravitics instead?  Or computers 
obsolete by 1990\'s standards?  I are confused...
     Caveat: I don\'t necessarily believe that the *social* milieu depicted
by some cyberpunk stories is realistic -- then I look at places like
Los Angeles and the former Eastern Block and think again.

     Uh, there seems to be some confusion as to what a smart-link is.  A
smart-link is the wire and circuitry that allows the electronics in your
gun (ie, the sights and trigger) to interface either with your brain thru
a neural jack, or your battlesuit combat computer if you are playing it
that way.  Which is to say, if your weapon is high enough TL to have 
electronics rather than merely mechanical sights and trigger, it can 
have smart-link capability built in with no extra size or weight penalty.
Of course the telescopic sight/laser-sight and smart-link are cumulative; 
the smart-link is useless without some kind of sight to provide targetting
data... I *would* go into LI/IR sights -- a natural for a smart-link.

True.  Which is why we\'ve only seen a handful in passing for all our

GDW probably doesn\'t employ anyone who knows what a neutrino is.  They
probably think it is another word for neutron.  

But let\'s be nice.  Let\'s PRETEND we believe GDW is filled with bright
technophilic young men (and women, mustn\'t forget them).  Instead of
admitting that they seem to be survivors from the early sixties, who
haven\'t yet caught up on the latest technological developments.

Such a device already exists in the game.  It\'s called a black globe.

If this is, seriously, your Rule #1, Cynthia, then regardless of your
impressive achievements here on the TML I have just lost any and all 
respect for you as a member of the Traveller community. You are preaching
the worst kind of ear-rot there is, and it makes my stomach turn.

What is your sin? Making rules to deal, within the context of the
game, with players whose actions may prove disruptive or
counterproductive.  This is not, as you might benightedly think, a
necessary and constructive sign of a good, conscientious Referee: it
is the eternal stamp of the muddled, muddling amateur, and one that I
shed myself only a few short years ago, after over a decade of making
myself miserable doing what I was SUPPOSED to be enjoying, i.e.
running Traveller games.

Note that this is NOT about technology, it is a much larger issue.
You can, and do, argue that from a game technology standpoint giving
people access to hellish weapons of instant destruction is reasonable,
viz.:

On the face of it, this statement is totally reasonable. I live and
play my SF RPGs by it, and so do many others. In concert with your
Rule #1, though, it is the stroke of Doom for a worthwhile game. 

My suggestion that technology be limited was, in essence, a timid
attempt to avoid this posting by skirting the reasonable point you
make about the availability of technology. It failed, because what you
just said above was inarguable. Now, though, I\'m forced to say
something much more difficult, because of that FIRST piece of your
hraka I quoted.

(At this point, you\'re all scratching your heads and wondering if 
The Man has finally gone off the deep end. Perhaps; doctoral theses
can do that to you. But there is a point to all this. Bear with me.)

(It is also possible, even highly PROBABLE, that the initial statement
made by Cynthia WAS in fact made in jest (at least partially), which 
makes my initial disclaimer twice as important, lest I lose a good
friend. However, I shall press on, for my point is the most important
one I have ever made on the TML, or WILL ever make, and there are 
those who MUST hear it. Bear with me.)

(This tends to reinforce my feeling that Cynthia was kidding. Well and
good; I was worried there for a second. It also, however, demonstrates
that she remains ignorant of the true problem. Onward!)

What you have failed utterly to consider, in your mad rush toward
technic Nirvana, is the metagaming aspect of the availability of such
technology.  Not just what the characters become capable of, but what
the PLAYERS realize the characters become capable of. The bridge
between real live person, with limitations of various sorts, and
paper-and-dice construct, with DIFFERENT limitations, of various
sorts. And how all of this fits in with the vision of the game, from a
standpoint of both knowledge and intent.

Forget the rules. Forget the UNIVERSE! THIS is what is important;
all else is expensive, slick window dressing that doesn\'t mean spit:

What are we doing here? We are playing Traveller.

What is Traveller? Traveller is a role-playing game.

What is a role-playing game? A game in which people create artificial 
personae to interact in a fictional universe in an attempt to gain 
various goals (that\'s the "role-playing" part) and enjoy themselves 
in the process (that\'s the "game" part).

Role-playing. Game. This and nothing else is the core of the matter.

When we do this, we are engaging in a constructive, cooperative effort
to solve a problem of some sort. We encourage one another; we face setbacks
together, we suffer together, sometimes we die, sometimes we triumph.
It is not the Satanist hogwash the media paint it as; it is perhaps the
most healthy and uplifting form of recreation ever invented by Man. It
HEALS! Psychologists know this, and have for years or decades. It is,
ultimately, GOOD for us.

Unless we do things YOUR way. With Rules like #1. Observe and learn:

When a group of people get together to game, players and ref,
regardless of the rules system or the circumstances, they do so to
enjoy each other\'s company and to explore a world of fantasy and
wonder, TOGETHER. We have all experienced times when the entire 
group, even when the CHARACTERS were in conflict, moved and thought
in a wondrous harmony, and the game "clicked." It WORKED. 

We have also, alas, experienced times when it didn\'t. Sometimes only
on occasion, and sometimes chronically. And when the problem becomes
chronic, we have often, in our inexperience and ignorance, attempted
to band-aid the problem with Rules.

Bad move.

There is only one Rule that counts in a role-playing game: THOU SHALT
GET ALONG WITH THY REF AND FELLOW PLAYERS. No exceptions, no fixes to
the rules to prevent abuses, no nothing. You go with the program or
you LEAVE.

The Rule you suggest is designed to prevent abuses by players of the
tremendous technology that futuristic games offer, or for that matter
the magic and nifty weapons that float around most fantasy games.  It
implies one of two possibilities: either there is a player or two who
is always looking for a crowbar to wedge open a bit more of an
advantage over the NPCs (and often, tacitly, the other players), orr a
situation in which the players have one vision and the Ref another.

This should not be confused with what arises from IGNORANCE of the
game framework, it is a matter of INTENT. The Rules are stapled into
place to prevent things from getting out of hand; the Ref throws up
obstacles, technicalities, threats, to hold down the players, and they
respond with ever more clever and devious means of escalation.  Their
fun is malicious; the Ref, often, stops having fun at all. The game
goes on, but people wonder why it doesn\'t zing any more.

The reason is lack of shared vision.

(What a positively revolting thought.)

"But wait," you say, "You provided the technology for this massacre."

True.  In my game, in this circumstance, the technology was there at
the start, and the player and his character knew it. It was understood
that gunplay was damned dangerous, and the sooner and cleaner it was
over, the better.  This character was set up with the stated intent of
finishing violent situations before any PCs could get hurt. He did so
with alacrity but with no sadism or joy, and he runs his character in
such a way as to assure that such situations are AVOIDED whenever
possible. In short, he is incredibly dangerous, but his character
WORKS because he shares the vision of a nonviolent, brain-intensive 
game with his Referee (moi) and the other players (none of whom have,
or wanted to have, dangerous fighters).

I am going to save you all the years of agony I went through, trying
to jump through hoops to please everyone in a game at once when certain
players were being uniform pains in the butt, so listen carefully:

Just say NO.

You\'re not stupid; you can tell the difference between a character
who\'s a pain because it\'s the player\'s PLACE in the GAME to be a pain
(what\'s a party without conflict?) and a character who\'s a pain
because the player is a pain, period. You can tell the difference
between a player who\'s having a bad night and one who\'s just plain
impossible. This is not generalizable! A fellow who is a total BLAST
in a high-level Runequest game may be a total BUMMER in a Traveller
campaign; people who are uniformly impossible are, thankfully, a
minority.

> >whereupon he described "Smith" and "Wesson" from BUCK GODOT, ZAP GUN

>      Hey! I liked Buck Godot!

So did I, but it WASN\'T Traveller. It was Bureau 13, which is FINE, or
maybe Star Wars, but it wasn\'t Traveller. The mindset is different.

This is a vital subpoint to the one about shared vision: Different
games, and different universes, require different mindsets. You don\'t
play Traveller the way you play AD&D, or Bureau 13, or Paranoia, or
Runequest. They all have different "feels" to them, and must be
treated accordingly. The vision changes, and the people must change
with it. It all ties together that way in the end.

(Ultimately, this is the core of my disclaimer: I cannot force the
mindset of my Traveller universe on others, and unlike games like
Paranoia or Teenagers from Outer Space or Toon, the mindset in
Traveller is open to interpretation. There are people out there who
revel in the kind of mindless garbage that I avoid with all haste, and
enjoy themselves in doing so. To them, then, this entire diatribe may
seem pointless and out of place, but it is equally important to them
as to me, because THEY must retain THEIR vision as I retain mine.)

So, we have defined the problem: lack of shared vision. What\'s the fix?

Just say NO. In the most forceful, inarguable way you can: throw the
offenders OUT. You\'re NOT doing yourself or them a favor by keeping
them in a game and messing with rules and caveats to keep them in
line; you\'re tacitly encouraging their behavior and ruining things for
the other players....and for yourself, oftentimes. If they\'re really
friends, they\'ll understand and show up for a different campaign in a
different game with a different Ref, if that\'s what it takes. If they
are so mortally offended by the fact that you can\'t deal with them
that they refuse to have anything to do with you thereafter, guess
what?  You just WON, BIGTIME, because they\'re out of your HAIR! You
can go back to enjoying the game again! No need for Rules-- you\'ve
eliminated why they were there in the first place! 

And if it\'s the whole party against the Ref? Well, two possibilities:
one is that they\'re all jerks, the other is that their shared vision
clashes with yours. The solution to both problems is the same: STOP
THE GAME IMMEDIATELY. Then you either start a new game in keeping with
their vision, if it\'s one you COULD share if you knew of it from the
start... or go find a new game group.  And don\'t give me that whining
about how tough it is to find groups these days! That\'s horseshit.
There are bazillions of people looking for Refs; you just have to find
a set that click with your needs.  Playing with people who DON\'T is
worse than not playing at all. Believe me, I know.

If you love Traveller as a world-conquering shoot-em-up game, and 
your players do as well, GO FORTH AND SHED BLOOD! Don\'t let an old
fart like me spoil your fun-- IF IT *IS* FUN TO YOU. I like running
games of this sort myself every once in a while (once per four years
seems to be about right), but I DON\'T use Traveller for it. It\'s
not right for me. But if it IS right for you, AND for your players,
then go to it. 

BUT.....

If you are the referee of a game, and you establish a certain mindset,
then it behooves you to insure that your players understand and agree
with that mindset, AT THE START. If they do not, you must either learn
what they want and change accordingly, if you can do so without
compromising your own vision, or change games, or eject them. Some or
all. If your vision is clouded, you CANNOT run a good game.

In closing, I quote Cynthia one last time:

>      Yep.  An idiot with the power of a god is still an idiot [...]

And a referee who makes rules to circumvent player conflict rather than
cutting it away like the cancer it is, IS the prime example of an idiot
with the power of a god. I have no sympathy for these people; they 
deserve none. They have created their own private Hells.

Here endeth the lesson. Go, and tolerate fools no more.

(And before anyone asks: yes, I *DO* practice what I preach. Ask any
of the thirty or forty people with whom I had long-standing gaming 
associations whom I\'ll no longer run in Traveller games because they
were good D&D players and ONLY good as D&D players....)

(And before anyone asks: No, I do not apply this ruling to the PBEM,
although I\'d dearly love to sometimes. Why not? That\'s not for
public discussion.)

Thanks for your tolerance of my howling. I hope I was able to teach
SOMEONE something useful with it; it\'d be a drag if Cynthia stopped
talking to me for nothing. |-\\

JUMP SPACE MECHANICS

Ok, I\'ll bite...  I certainly won\'t argue over the problems with
gravitics and computers in Traveller.  On the other hand, I could
write an equation for "jump space mechanics" where the energy event of
jump space insertion allows the ship to travel through "complex" space
(described mathematically as Riemannian space).  Reintroduction into
"real" space at one\'s destination can be described as "popping"
through a Reimann surface at a singularity (satisfying the boundary
conditions of the yet unwritten differential equation of jump travel
arbitrarily).  Misjumps?  Well, bad insertions could be used as
initial boundary conditions for travel through Reimannian space, thus
skewing the "solution" of the differential and the final time/place of
arrival.

On the other hand, I\'ve never cared for lanthium grid technology...

     < Warning - nerd attack: The above "jump space mechanics" are
       modelled on the REAL WORLD solution for the arrival of Love 
       and Rayleigh waves in a teleseismic event, where the energy
       event (ie, a big earthquake) happens in real mathematical space, 
       the displacements travel in complex mathematical space <some 
       of which are entirely imaginary...>, and arrivals happen at 
       singularities when the wave train "pops" through a Riemann 
       surface back into exclusively REAL space...  Helmberger at the 
       Seismic Lab at Caltech did the mathematics in the late 60\'s - 
       truly grusome stuff, makes great reading late at night if you 
       want to be put to sleep... >

COMPUTER-TO-PERSON DIRECT INTERFACING

This has always been one of the two things in cyberpunk that I\'ve
always had the most trouble with.  I have no confidence, based on what
I know (which isn\'t that much, admittedly), that near-future
technology can support computer to person direct interfacing.  I just
don\'t think "jacking-in" is possible.

It turns out from what people have learned from PET scanning of the
human brain that smart people are effecient thinkers (low PET
emissions during problem solving), and not-so-smart people are
wasteful thinkers (high PET emissions during problem-solving).  In
addition, we know that memory retrieval is probably a tree search, and
we also know where different functions occur in the brain more or
less.

We know that synapses pass electro-chemical signals through the brain,
and that there are several different emzymes that act essentially as
bio-resisters, bio-transitors and bio-capacitors along synapse paths.
We also know that there is an upper limit on the SPEED, ie the
electric current, along the synaptical pathways.  Last, we know that
the brain is self-wiring, and that the virtual wiring in every brain
is different.  (Remember, the brain is a really cool organ - after
brain damage which isn\'t too severe, the brain can relearn and rewire
most of its functionality along new paths - which is why stroke
victims are often able to relearn talking and walking...)  The basic
ROM "instruction set" on "wiring" is stored in chromosomes at the cell
level, which is to say that an analog computer is probably a better
model for the hardware/software or the brain that a digital
computer...  Neural input/output is analog - think about hand/eye
coordination, for example.

So, smart thinking is efficient, but along pathways which have an
upper limit on speed, and which can\'t be described because their
specific location is unknowable (because of the self-wiring nature of
the brain).  Given those constraints, I personally find it hard to
believe that a near-future biomed engineer will be able to design the
sort of interface described in the cyberpunk genre books for
"jacking-in", mostly because of the dynamic and unique virtual wiring
property of individual brains.

So given that the hardware/software system is DYNAMIC, how can you
make a jack (which will be fixed in space) that can interface with a
self-rewiring analog biochemical processor whose instruction set has
no knowledge of the world beyond the cellular level???  I don\'t think
it can be done (personal opinion).

Mind you, I only have the sort of "knowledge" on bioscience that comes
from reading Scientific American and Science News.  This isn\'t to say
that I\'m inflexible in my opinion; but I\'ve thought about this a bit,
and I made conclusions on what I think I know.  I\'m willing to be
convinced otherwise if one of the smart-link, chipping-in, and/or
jacking-in proponents can propose a plausible means by which
computer/brain interfacing can be achieved.

OK, end of rant...  You can take out your smart guns for pot shots at
me now...

As I am the only person in my traveller group with an internet
account, I\'ve been making hard copy of the nightly mailing and taking
it over to where I game one to two times a week.  There the hard copy
is snatched up and read...  We\'ve been working our ways slowly through
the bundles also.  (Thanks Bob Dean, for getting me directions to this
list...  you\'ve made a whole bunch of old traveller junkies pretty
happy...)

My GM asked me to post the message below.  If you have any replies for
Jim, you can send them to me, and I can get them to him.  The turn
around time for Jim to reply to items posted on this list is slow, so
as you will see below, he will be responding sometimes to subjects a

********************* begin included message **************************

Hello out there. I\'m an MT GM over in the East Bay Area ( Why yes, we
Californians so think that there is only one Bay Area |-) )  I\'m
Writing this to say Hi, and to talk about one of my favorite games!
One of my players is on this mailing list and if you\'re reading this,
she has consented to send this set of rambilings out. I did look at
the Rouge generation and I don\'t think it\'s too complicated at all;
and if anyone of my players want to use it for a character, I\'d be
happy to see it.

Speaking of characters, my wife has two that are a new race -
Racoonids!  We are thinking of sending them to the Challenge as an
article on a new race - if you people would be interested let us know.

I run a game that is pretty free form but has a lot of role playing. I
like my people to be happy with their characters. I was looking at
some comments about Career changes - I liked the Idea of DM modes
based on time in the old career but allowing the use of brownee points
on the enlistment. Good idea !!

We have one character in our game who changed careers at the start of
the campaign.  She was a Cop who rose to Police Commissoner ( also
became a Baroness |-)) She was selected by a certain Duke to be the
mission commander for a group of very strange characters. On eof her
favorite comments ( when no one is listening! |-)) is " I\'ll get you
for this Norris!!!!"  She is riding herd on the Nail mission (the one
from the Rebellion book) Her #1 is an Aslan Male (if he couldn\'t
command, he might accept #1...) The next is a retired (so she
thought...) Navy Commodore who thought very little of putting an EX
COP in command!!!

There are some very strange people on this crew - even the humans have
communication difficulties ( you are a product of your culture you
know... |-) )

Maybe we\'ll post some of the stories to the list if anyone is
interested out there. it\'s been a grand time!! how about the time M.C.
shot up her stateroom wall! or the time Thilea fell in on Sean... We
have a lot of role playing and not to many fire fights ( those are
dangerous - you can get HURT that way!!! ) and only one bar fight
(some of the charcters didn\'t like it one bit and are not going to get
in another if they have any say in the matter...).

What is up in the MT world ? I keep reading that DGP is not doing MT 
any more and that GDW is coming out with (YET) another revision of 
Traveller. I don\'t know how many more I can stand as I bought the 
original books and resisted the change until I got a real good look at 
MT and they had had time to get most of the Errata |-) done!!

I think that I\'ve run on probably too long now so I\'ll return you to 
your original sender!

Starports

Who owns them on a planet ????? I read somwhere that the starport
was imperial territory on planets . What do people think ?????

My version is like this . 

All starport territory (the land) is owned by the imperial government . 
It in turn leases this land out to various coorporations who set up
the starport (for a nominal fee) . Thus in theory the starport is imperial
territory . The security in a starport would be imperial marines I guess
.. Thus somebody could enter a starport and be in an \'exclusion\' zone . Of
course there would be extradition (but with a \'undemocratic\' government
benign buearacrats could put alot of red tape in the way) . 

The problem with this view is that the planets government might be
a tad resentful that their planets starport is run like this . 

The situation is a bit like Shanghi in China before the outbreak
of the second world war . The port was run jointly by france, england
and I think america . Most of the city was chinease but the port area
was run by the govts who had troops stationed at the \'border\' with 
checkpoints and the like . People had to have the neccessary papers 
to cross between the areas . When the japanese invaded, these 
govts still controlled the exclusion zone. 

I would really like to know others views and comments on this
(cause I am going to use em in the next adventure) . 

What do you think

Mike Metlay says:

{Sorry I quoted so much, but it seemed important}

:Forget the rules. Forget the UNIVERSE! THIS is what is important;

:Role-playing. Game. This and nothing else is the core of the matter.

:We have also, alas, experienced times when it didn\'t. Sometimes only

:chronic, we have often, in our inexperience and ignorance, attempted

:
:Bad move.

If only politicians would learn this about real life.  Not so far removed
from fantasy, I guess.


:There is only one Rule that counts in a role-playing game: THOU SHALT
:GET ALONG WITH THY REF AND FELLOW PLAYERS. No exceptions, no fixes to
:the rules to prevent abuses, no nothing. You go with the program or
:you LEAVE.

Why does this sound so remeniscent of the first and second (Judaic)
commandments?  

Which is MY main point about GM\'ing--Don\'t take it too seriously.
So often we see people who need to get a life and stop treating the 
game like it was actuually important to them.  If it *really* is 
that important, this player needs professional counseling, not the
kind of inner search work that comes from role-playing.  Very few
of us here have the skills and training needed to keep that (fortunately
very) rare individual from losing touch with our common fantasy
altogether.

So, as Mike says:

:Here endeth the lesson. Go, and tolerate fools no more.

:(And before anyone asks: No, I do not apply this ruling to the PBEM,
:although I\'d dearly love to sometimes. Why not? That\'s not for
:public discussion.)

Except it\'s mainly my fault.  and I\'ll publicly admit THAT much...

rest of your tirade.
 
     I have played Traveller ever since it came out, under a variety
of GMs (mostly good.  Bad GMs seem to stick to D&D).  I have NEVER
seen a relationship between good roleplaying (or lack of it) and
weaponry (or lack of it).  The two are about as closely related as
rockets and crabs.
 
     The only point I get from your tirade is either that:
 
          1) requiring internal consistency is bad, or
 
          2) allowing bad guys to have a fighting chance is bad.
 
     Neither assumption really makes sense.  The assumption that doing
either of these things somehow enhances group play makes no sense
either.  The assumption that you cannot be playing the game right
unless you follow these "guidelines" makes no sense, either.
 
     Having played Traveller for many years (and many other
roleplaying games during the same period), I have noticed that the
ONLY time firepower affects playing style is when the PCs have it, and
the NPCs don\'t.  Otherwise, whether the available firepower is clubs
or FGMPs seems to make little difference.  FYI, in Cynthia\'s games, my
character(s) have used guns four times in the last two years:  once to
shoot a couple of large carnivores trying to eat my cattle, once to
break up a bank robbery, once to ambush some pirates, and once to stop
a lunatic from killing my character.  In none of those cases did my
level of firepower affect my decision to use force, and in only one
would a lack of firepower have convinced me not to (I would have let
the carnivores kill my cows, since I have no desire to be eaten by a
four-ton meatgrinder on legs).
 
     Digression!
 
     Back to the main point.  Mike, do you really believe that being
internally consistent is bad from a "role-playing" standpoint?  Have I
just lost any respect I might have had for you?
 
     Rule #1, as Cynthia described it, is my rule #1.  It can best be
translated as:
 
     "The only advantage you have over ANYONE else is your mind, and
it\'s contents.  They can, and will, use everything the universe allows
to accomplish their goals, just as (presumably) you will.  In other
words, if you can\'t outthink them, don\'t bet on being able to outshoot
them."
 
     If this assumption is wrong, then I have indeed missed the boat
in roleplaying.  But I suspect that allowing the PCs to get their
hands on "terror-weapons" while forbidding the NPCs to do so is worse,
and I don\'t think I will EVER allow such in any game I play in, even
if the PC(s) are nice guys who would never use those same
"terror-weapons".
 
Later...

Hi all! Just a little question regarding tiny nuclear detonations.
Say that you have a 0.1 Kiloton warhead go boom at sea level on
the surface of an ocean. The first thing I want to know is whether
of not you agree with the blast radius given by Striker rules
(no damage beyond 300 meters, if I\'m reading this correctly).
The second thing I\'m wondering about is, how high in TL would you
have to go before you could squeeze the bomb (detonation equipment,
shielding, and nuclear material) into the space of... roughly...
a soccer ball (or football for those of you outside the United
States)? The third thing I want to know is, how far away, roughly,
could the average person hear the "little boom"? And fourth,
would the waves generated by this critter pose a significant
hazard to costal populations which are more than five or ten
miles from ground zero? Finally, could a reliable nuke be made
at the 0.01 - 0.001 range in order to deliver a little bang
(say to completely destroy a city block with something the size
of a grapefruit)? Just wondering out loud. It\'s for the
Harrison Chapters, of course. Muchos thanx in advance...

Um... yes, but we are very fortunate to have, at our disposal, several major 
NERVES that connect the senses from the disparate parts of the body TO the 
brain.... Tap into those and you are in business.. This makes sensory perception
enhancement much more feasible, but makes such things as enhanced consciousness 
(the computer actually FUSES with the brain to have faster memory, heightened
intelligence, etc. is well nigh impossible (even though I WILL NOT take the 
extra step to say that it IS impossible)) If computer enhanced intelligence does
exist in the future, it probably will be in the form of a \'small voice talking
in your ear\' privvy to the data that is coming into the brain, and able to make
separate decisions about such data, then commuting that data TO you. In other
words, a dialog.

	About the problem of analog -- 1) it is only half correct.  Action 
potentials are PARTIALLY analog. They either are firing or they don\'t -- in that
sense they are digital. However, they also have limits to firing, sometimes fire
in weakened way (if overburdened by too much activity) and sometimes cannot fire
at all (if in a resting state) In addition, neurons have a partial ability to 
LEARN from prior firings. The reason why you haven\'t gone crazy because of the
sensation of your clothes on your skin is because the neurons have ADAPTED to 
this sensation, and do not fire because of it.
	Anyhow, the whole paragraph above is moot, because a transform can be 
made from analog to digital, as evidenced by CD players. I am not too familiar
with the mechanics of this, but it is certainly NOT an impassible block as far
as Cyber technology is concerned....

Curious as to what you think,

Think of a 100 kilogram iron bomb.  That\'s about 220 pounds.  Smaller than
the bombs dropped by B-17\'s in World War II.  Not big enough to cause wide
scale destruction.  But whatever it hit will feel it big time, but not much
else.  I believe the BIG bombs in vietnam that smashed huge areas were in
the 750 pound range.  or about .3 kilotons.

I should be so lucky.  This may, in fact, be true in a city like
Pittsburgh, with a nice, big population base to choose from.  In
a city the size of Corvallis (population 48,000 and shrinking),
the only possible source of game fodder is the university, and the
kind of mewing, masturbating, adolescent slime you get there can
put you right off role-playing altogether.  If you can afford to
pick and choose, you don\'t know how lucky you\'ve got it.

Grrrr.  That sound you hear is my hackles raising.  (More later, as
Steve H. is also guilty of this.)

What *IS* it with you people and D&D?!?  I can\'t think of any other
example of in all my personal experience to compare with the "holier-
than-thou", elitist *bullshit* I see on rec.games.frp, and the TML,
when it comes to the subject of D&D.  You just can\'t seem to slam
it enough.

Complain about the *RULES*?  For Christ\'s sake!!  It\'s the oldest
FRP still in wide-spread use!  So it\'s been through 2 revisions.
You can only change it so much before it stops being D&D and starts
being some other FRP.  You can find tons of flaws in *ANY* game system,
(including, as we all know, our beloved Traveller), just like you can
find devotees of any game system.

Complain about the players?  Again, oldest system in existance.  Of
*COURSE* there are lots of bad D&D players.  There are also lots of
*GOOD* ones!  When you\'ve been around that long, you\'re going to pick
up plenty of both.  It\'s just that the *BAD* D&D players get more
press (mostly from some RPG snobs I won\'t mention by name).  To
quote Sturgeon\'s Law, "Ninty percent of *EVERYTHING* is crap."

But I digress...

Mike, I agree with about 95% of your original post, but I\'m having
a really hard time seeing how it relates to Cynthia\'s "Rule #1".

Remember, RPG Rule #1 is "Don\'t give the Ref. ideas."  (Oops!  That\'s
Rule #4.) :^)

Actually (to paraphrase from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"),
Rule #1 is "There *IS* no Rule #1".

If you want ot opt for technical consistancy, fine.  If not, and
your players don\'t squawk, that\'s fine too.

Anyway, as Steve says...

I don\'t know that it\'s necessarily Rule #1, but it should *definitely*
be *SOMEWHERE* on the list.

 Er you know you want to talk starports know (gee I cant think why any
 one will be able to flame that heh !) . 
 
 Another question from me
 
 In todays terms how powerful are traveller computers in todays terms ?
 
 Please no scientific mumbo jumbo a scince student could only understand
 
 My idea was this . 
 
 A tech 11 hand computer (about 1/5 the size of a milk container) has
 a 20 meg hard disk and 2 meg memory . 
 
 What do you think
 
 "Oh and only real men talk traveller starports (and computers)"
 
 PS My views on cyberdecking computers, its workable, people just
 go skitz doing it . Besides the average starship computer seems to
 be fairly smart, and would HE want you sniffing through his
 underware draw doing it hmmmmmmmmm ......?

I *think* I heard all three of  you say roughly the same thing.  To wit:
It is the GM\'s job.  Don\'t abrogate it to a determined player.  (more or
less.)

Internal consistency is one of the tools at our disposal.  Secret weapons
are another.  "Just say \'no\'" is a third.  Choosing to use one in prefer-
ence to another does not make you a bad person (tm).  It only means you
have individual tastes.

To paraphrase Steve, the mind is our, and our players\' most potent tool. 
Occassionally one will misuse it.  Our job is to be prepared.  *Sometimes*
we can make our point by duking it out with the characters.  Often we
have to flex our muscle on the player.

I\'d like to thank Steve Higginbotham for his well-reasoned response
to my flailings on the last TML digest (BTW, Richard, it is precisely
BECAUSE of my thesis defense that I\'m as crabby as I am, and after 
a fourteen hour day of writing physics it was a handy way to blow off
steam); our disagreement, however, appears to be a moot point, based
on my interpretation of what Cynthia says versus his.

Cynthia\'s initial statement: "The bad guys have it too."

Steve\'s reasoning for the existence of this rule: "It is
technologically and societally consistent to assume that all
individuals at a given level of technology and "connectedness" can
access technology of a certain type, and one cannot therefore count on
a technic advantage at any given moment. One should predicate one\'s
actions based on the assumption that one\'s \'toys\' are inferior, or at
best comparable, to those of one\'s adversaries."

Metlay\'s reasoning for the existence for this rule: "One of the most
commonly seen means of game abuse is for parties to arm themselves 
heavily with weapons and technology so as to batter their way through
challenges provided by the Ref without forethought or care, regarding
their toys as a crutch for bad roleplaying. We can defeat this by
hitting back with all of the technology at our disposal."

Both are correct and non-exclusive, and if any blame must be laid, it
must be upon me for strictly adhering to my interpretation rather than
giving fair voicing to Steve\'s (and presumably Cynthia\'s). However, 
that does not invalidate my point. Rules like Cynthia\'s can and do exist
for the muzzling of players that should simply be shot and left in a 
snowdrift, and I would bet money that even in Traveller they exist for
MY reasons in more campaigns than they do for Steve\'s.

I apologize for any offense I may have caused by failing to consider
both interpretations, positive and negative, of the rule. But I will
NOT back down from my interpretation, any more than I\'d ask you to back 
down from yours.

That having been said, let me do some more flaming for a moment:

I envy you greatly, Steve, if you can honestly say that you have
rarely if ever seen a bad Ref running Traveller. In my experience of
the fourteen years the game has been in general circulation, the
proportion of truly awful Traveller refs, players and games I have
seen has been uncomfortably high. Maybe I ought to move to where
y\'all are, since you seem to have had better luck than me....

(At this point, I had written a very long, gruesomely detailed flame
elaborating on the above points to excess. I then wised up and deleted
it. Y\'all have had enough from me, and my lunch hour (well, 15 minutes)
is over and it\'s time to get back to work....)

The simple one out of the way first:
	Today, we can fit a 1-3 kiloton nuke in a 155mm
(6 inch diameter) artillery shell with ease.  I\'ve
seen actual (though prototype) football-sized ones.
There\'s really no point with a conventional fission
bomb to make it any less powerful than that; you reach
a point of inverse return where you have to design
it larger to get less power out of it... 8-)  You can
extrapolate as you wish out to TL15; I suspect that
you could with gravitic imploders and less-stable
elements make very, very big hydrogen bombs in a 
hand grenade sized package.  Hell, if you can build
a moderately capable nuclear damper, just put a 
kilo of Californium in a small damper container and just
turn the damper off to detonate it 8-)

On to Starports...
	Adam Naylor seems to have slightly misunderstood
the position of a Starport.  According to previous
published material, a starport is extraterritorial
in terms of local laws (imperial laws apply though),
but not for "ownership".  There are references to
company-owned worlds where the corporation was investing
in upgrading "their" starport.  In addition, there\'s
no good reason for the Imperial government to have
to be responsible for running them all.  As long as
everyone follows the Imperial rules about how starports
are run, and that seems standard, then everyone can
go have their own if they want 8-)

ok, I\'ll buy that GIVEN that the \'jack\' is smart enough to understand
how that brain processes information, which is something that isn\'t
completely known yet.  

but but but - the \'jack\' can know about the brain - but how can the
brain "know" about the jack?!?  Again I will kvetch that the info set
(which is on the cellular level) will not recognise ADDITIONAL alien
pathways represented by the jack.  I\'ll buy substitution of existing
pathways, but I still can\'t buy adding new functionality/paths.  

I suppose that some future genetic engineer will figure out a way to
reprogram the cellular info set (after all, that\'s what they\'re doing
now with dna splicing) and then it\'s possible for the brain at the
site of the jack to recognise the jack...  But think of the further
implications: if you can do that in the brain, you can presumably do
it elsewhere in the body too! An extra arms or two, folks?!?  And who
needs analgathics when you can just go ahead and reset the biological
clock?!?

I\'ll buy that (especially since that\'s how modern prosthetics work).
I also agree with your "dialog" model of enhanced intelligence.

Yes, fourier forward and inverse transforms are wonderful little

In my universe the "Starport" is part of the contractual obligation
that the imperium has for the planet when it joins the imperium, the
same as the defense of the planet with the fleet, etc.

This means that when a planet jonis the Imperium, Imperial advisors
are sent in to help the local populace build the port, provide standard
reguations (e.g. communication frequencies), and manpower including
security. The natives still have to build it, which is why there is
such a variation between starport types (A-F).

There is nothing stopping the local populace from constructing their
own starport, in fact the Planet builders book includes the secondary
starports when generating the planet. The characters don\'t routinely
see these other ports because:
1) They are typically of lower class than the main (Imperial) port
2) Locals run them, so people are not certain of the security, etc.
3) The main port is well versed in customs etc, which the lesser ports
may not be
(I\'m sure there are more reasons, but it is essentially cyclical, people
use the main port most of the time because people use the main port 
frequently)

This (I think) would make a interesting diversion, the PC\'s have to
use a local port rather than the main one for whatever reason, and
then they have to deal with unknown customs, people trying to
cheat them (i.e. substandard fuel, unnecessary repairs) if they don\'t 
check closely. Bribery, etc.

Cease thy foaming and smooth thy hackles, O Excitable One. I stated,
plainly, that the people I no longer gamed with were good D&D players
but not good Traveller players. I\'m sorry if that immediately registered
as a D&D slam, but I was trying to hark back to the idea of a different
mindset, not to belittle D&D, which I have played and run off and on
since 1975 and which was the basis for the variant game that supported 
my single best campaign ever (1984-1987 nonstop). The people in it were
great D&D players-- among the best-- but we\'d started playing D&D because
my repeated attempts at Traveller games continually went flat with them.

And as far as finding players goes, I still maintain that no players beats
bad players every time. I can afford to be patient.

Apologies for even SEEMING to slam D&D (in any of it\'s incarnations). 
While it is true that most of the terrible GMs I have known stuck with
D&D, it is also true that some of the very best GMs I know stuck
exclusively to D&D.

Why should I complain about the rules?  They MUST be doing something

This also is true.  I have never denied it, and never would.  But the
bad D&Ders get more press because there are more of them (more players
implies more bad players, all else equal).  And Sturgeon\'s Law just
about covers it, all right...
 
BTW, why are we arguing about D&D?

	Two new GDW MegaTraveller thingies.  One is that Challenge
60 is out (which means that I ought to be paid for Surprise Party rsn 8-),
with the usual dearth of good MT stuff.  What it does have is the combat
rules for McInnis\'es Wet Navy (which I wasn\'t totally impressed by),
A bunch of starship designs by Gannon that are theoretically "Black War"
warships (they look better done than the last naval suppliment.  There\'s
even a 12,000 ton J3, 3G Meson Gun J CL, which we all know is a very
useful type of ship to have 8-).  An interesting tidbit in the
Traveller News Service indicates that Dulinor is starting to play
hardball opressing his political opposition within his home area
(or alternatively that Terrorism is on the rise in a _big_ way,
another great sign of the onset of chaos).

	Other product, and this is a neat one, is a $4.50
miniadventure by Charles Gannon entitled "Assignment: Vigilante".
It\'s about a starmerc outfit with a modified Subsidized liner
turned fighter-carrier, operating as an anti-piracy force in Diaspora
sector.  It\'s got a 16-page campaign/scenario book, a color 3-page
cardboard ship deckplan for the title liner (with some other random
but good artwork), and seems like a truly great package for the
size and money.  I suggest it highly.  I also intend to convince GDW
that this is a great format to do adventures in (bigger than Challenge
can run, but a whole lot less hassle than a "real" adventure, which
is 4-6 times as big).

This is becoming something of a standard litany, isn\'t it Mike?

Sigh.  Every have one of those days?  You sit and read something
you posted earlier to some public forum or other.  With each line,
you turn a deeper shade of red, and all that runs through your mind,
over and over again, is, "My *GOD*!  Did I *REALLY* write that?
What was I thinking?"

Anyway, Mike and Steve, sorry for the inappropriate ass-chewing.
I was weaned on AD&D.  For over eight years, it was all I played
(\'cause nobody wanted to try anything else).  Now, it\'s to the
point where *any* reference triggers a Pavlovian response.

Oh, BTW...

> And as far as finding players goes, I still maintain that no players beats
> bad players every time. I can afford to be patient.

I don\'t know about that.  Desparation can breed a lot of (short term)
tolerance.

Actually, what I really came here to talk about is...

Richard asks:

> Okay, just what IS _your_ rule #1?  (and 2 and 3)

You want rules?  OK, here\'s rules.

  Rule #1.  The GM is always right.
  Rule #2.  If the GM is wrong, see Rule #1.
  Rule #3.  If the GM is still wrong, there\'s the door.
  Rule #4.  Don\'t give the GM ideas.
  Rule #5.  Don\'t give the *players* ideas.
  Rule #6.  Shut up.  You\'re *dead*.
  Rule #7.  Marguaritas and magic don\'t mix.

Now, for some explanations.  (Substitute the pronoun "she" for
"he" where appropriate.)

Rule #1.  It *is* the GM (DM, Ref., whatever) who\'s running the
game.  He creates the rules.  He is in charge.  That\'s the whole
concept of a "Game*MASTER*".  Anything else breeds anarchy.  If
games built on the premise that everyone on the room has the same
degree of power and control would work, why isn\'t the market
crawling with them?

Rule #2.  The GM is also human.  But proving he\'s a dope in
mid-adventure is a recipe for disaster.  If you *must* contest
his ruling, do it after the adventure.  You may convince him
that you\'re right and he\'s wrong, and even if you don\'t, at
least the difference of opinion won\'t disrupt the game for the
rest of the players.

Rule #3.  If you consistantly disagree with your GM\'s rules/
style/minatures color-scheme/etc., you can always leave the
game.  If you\'re the only one in the group who has this problem,
maybe that should tell you something.  If all the players feel
the way you do, maybe that should tell the GM something.  Be
that as it may, some people won\'t or can\'t change.  Find another
game.

Rule #4.  Definitely a rule for players.  If your GM is worth
his salt, he\'ll be devious enough without any prodding from you.

Rule #5.  For you GM\'s there, reverse Rule #4.  It goes double
for devious players.

Rule #6.  Maybe it\'s just common sense and common courtesy, but
my experience tells me neither are very common.  If your character
gets greased, kibitzing can be more that just inappropriate.  Of
course, depending on how your PC died, maybe your ideas aren\'t
all that great to begin with. :^)

Rule #7.  Ditto Gin and Jump Drives.  A brew maybe great for
that upcoming Blazers/Suns game, but it can be a really *BAD*
idea for role-playing.  Inebriation and imagination are, for
the most part, mutually exclusive.

That\'s enough.

(Tomorrow, I pack the SCUBA gear and take the Sillinger out over
the bar, no matter *HOW* deep the swells are!  All this sitting
around and waiting is making me itch.)

THINGS TO AVOID IN A RPG:

1. Players whose introduction of their characters mentions any sort of
inanimate object in their possession, e.g. "I\'m running a Marine and he
has an FGMP-16 and some way-cool cybernetically enhanced bionic arms and..."

2. Refs who are careful about in what terms their rulings are couched
when dealing with certain players.

("That\'s an awkward sentence, Metlay."  "Not really. Last game I
played in in college, if the girl leading the party ever had anything
bad happen to her character, the Ref (her boyfriend) slept on the couch.")

3. Refs who lean on one aspect of a game to the exclusion of all else,
e.g. "What do you mean you have to leave early? The adventure\'s almost
over, we only have three more melees to run through!"

4. Anyone who reads from a script. EVER.

5. Refs who laugh at their players, or vice versa.

(this list is dedicated to Mikey and Ed, the worst refs I\'d ever met
in my life until I met Floyd in 1990.)

Traveller\'s Guide to Iakr Sector:  Fan Asteroid Belt
	The Fan Belt was settled 345 years ago by sufferers of Fan\'s
disease:  genetic disease causing malformed coils in the inner
ear.  Some malformations were likened to the shape of a fan thus
the name.  Sufferers of the disease become dizzy while in
accelerating frames of reference including vehicles and
gravitational wells.  Victims often do not live long due to
eating and balance problems.
	The Fan Belt offered a zero gravity community where people
who suffered from the condition could lead normal productive
lives.  It became a leper colony for the victims.  However,
several other conditions of sophonts respond positively to zero
gravity.  As more cases and species arrived the demand for
medical care expanded proportionately.
	The entire system has become a very cosmopolitan hospital.
Species of almost every kind are to be found there trying not to
step on each others cultural toes.  The medical research of the
entire sector is done there with equipment given from the
Imperium and Consulate.  As the two vie for prestige, everyone
profits.
	And, as the Fan Belt is only a few parsecs away from the
Zhodani Consulate, it is not surprising to find a Psi-Institute
there.

	Dr. Oylessic looked on the oddest patient it had ever seen.
The human, Drert, was thirty years old, had psi-strength that
went off the normal scale while its official rating had been
five.  It had an officially recorded intelligence of five, now
unreadable, had been diagnosed as incurably psychotic, but its
chief interest at the moment was counting its toes, and
occasionally sucking on them.
	The little droyne flapped noisily to it\'s desk and puzzled.
"Dr. Jietlshaiepr," it squeaked, "Never I have such a case seen.
Had to guess I did, say I would that it some sort of psionic shock
was.  It a phenomena without precedence is.  Explain what
happened please."
	Jietlshaiepr told the story, the ancient artifact,
Malenkoviepr\'s recognition of the object, the effect it gave off,
and the changes in Drert, and the reports on everyone else.
	"I see."  The little droyne reached into a leather pouch and
produced a dark blue crystal similar in shape to the artifact.
"This an olonde is.  Used in the ceremony of casting is.  When
young droyne into a caste set is, the olonde is the focus for its
concentration.  By concentrating on it in certain way, young
droyne may open genetic codes which will in its proper caste set.
	"Also used for the training of young are they.  As you may
know, Droyne through telepathy sometimes impart knowledge and
training.  The olonde used in this is.
	"May be one used in ancient time energy stored as you of
spoke.  If so, energy released at proper time must be.  Triggered
it something did and let loose the accumulated energy in torrent,
those nearby strongly affecting."
	Jietlshaiepr rested her head in her hand.  "So, could the
presence of a young mind possibly be something like a trigger for
this... olonde?"
	"Possible it is.  Have seen I report on others of group so
affected.  Affects of change, correlate with age subject.  All
received increased psionic strength correlated with age of
subject and distance from crystal as described.  Your self,
closest, increased strength by four points and telepath become.
Pilot Niedrsha three points, now telepath is.  Engineer Shtam,
greater age, two points increased and awareness acquired.
Steward Miakr youngest:  five points increased.  Telepath has
become.
	"Significant this is, think I.  But olonde activate did not
until patient crystal touched."
	Jietlshaiepr\'s eyebrows knitted, "So Drert was the trigger.
Something in his psychotic mind released the energy."
	"Apparently it seems."  The little droyne stretched its
wings.  "Gunner Drert rather childlike at the moment seems.
	Drert rolled over, suspended in mid air, and went to sleep
with his toes in his mouth.

	"I\'ve plotted our course to Massina," sighed Niedrsha.
"Three jumps:  three parsecs to Talak, four more to Aramat, then
two parsecs to Massina belt.  Since we\'re in a bit of a hurry we
can skim fuel from gas giants rather than wait to be refueled."
	"Why go to Aramat?" asked Miakr.  "The Ine Givar didn\'t have
any bases there:  no clues.  We could head to Axly just as well,
at least we\'d be safer from pirates in patrolled system."
	Niedrsha made a chopping motion with his hand.  "That\'s just
it.  It\'s over-patrolled.  They might pull us in to investigate.
And any bureaucratic mess is going to keep us from looking for
the doc."
	Shtam nodded, "True, the Axly race do tend to be rather
aggressive.  Independent military craft travelling through are
very thoroughly examined.  I remember once they held up an entire
convoy once because we were travelling with an armed escort."
	Miakr glanced at Vole.  "Well, I mean, if we\'re out to look
for Dr. Malenkoviepr, shouldn\'t we just skip Massina?"
	Gresha looked at the startled expressions of the rest of the
crew.  After all it seemed like a reasonable suggestion, in fact
a very good one.
	Jietlshaiepr shook her head slowly.  "We have our orders.
Our duty is to the Consulate."
	"Of course." agreed Niedrsha.
	"Indeed, and in addition, Massina, may also be as good place
as any to start our search." pointed out Shtam.  "After all,
that\'s where the Ine Givar, if that\'s who they were, contacted
him."
	Gresha sniffed, "Sorens is closer.  That\'s where they
contacted the Broadsword."
	Vole glanced around the room solemnly and focused on Miakr.
"Our duty is to the Consulate.  If we can get information on who
used this ship we will probably save more lives than one."
	- XV -
	One week later the Flamboyant was on it\'s way out of the
system.
	The emergency band burst across the bridge blaring with the
sound of an emergency locator transmitter.
	Jietlshaiepr grabbed the sensors.  "Ship just jumped in
system... 600 tons, heavy damage, radiation.  Viepchakl!  It\'s
one of ours!  Shivva class frigate.  Something really shot her to
pieces!  Heavy radiation.  Niedrsha, plot intercept course, there
may be survivors!"
	The Flamboyant veered around to match vectors with the
glowing hulk.  "ETA thirteen minutes.  We\'ll be the first ones
there." announced Niedrsha.
	A weak voice came over the band, "Mayday... Mayday...
Consular patrol frigate Uttova, Ensign Ebladatl speaking.  Come
in please.  Mayday...."
	"This is the captured corsair Flamboyant." answered
Jietlshaiepr, "Come in Uttova, do you have casualties?"
	"Affirmative, Flamboyant, request assistance.  Three crew
survivors...  Radiation burns...  They nuked us...."
	"This is the Fan Asteroid Belt Starport control," came an
authoritative voice, "Report your situation,  Uttova."
	"Jumped in from Acrolund... on interdiction patrol...
Deadhead\'s nuked us... Positive identification... Our relief
ship... Kinunir Cruiser... Heavy casualties... Fighters lost...
Bridge crew dead... Ensign Ebladatl now commanding...."
	- XVI -
	The Uttova was a shattered hulk.  Half of her turrets were
cracked open like nuts.  Most of the fuel tanks were shredded.
The maneuver drives were twisted like taffy.  The bridge had a hole
right through it.  While the landing bay was a fused glowing lump.
	The voice on the radio whispered weakly "Two survivors
unconscious...  Rest crew dead.  You\'ll have to pull us out... I
got crew in rescue balls... I\'m in a suit...  Air lock controls
out... Have to cut in... Cabin pressure up... can\'t control... Cut
in starboard lock... Starboard lock... Cut in..."
	"I read you Ensign." radioed Jietlshaiepr.  "We\'ll get you
out in five minutes.
	"Shtam, ready the gig.  Niedrsha, you stay with the ship.
Gresha, Miakr, Vole, were going over there.  Battle dress, every
one.  The radiation level is safe for about forty minutes
exposure.  Plenty of time."
	The lock was obscured by wreckage.  The twisted ribs of hull
bracing were bent back jaggedly over the entrance.  Hours of work
with a laser welder.
	"Uttova, do you read?" asked Jietlshaiepr.
	A whisper came back.  "...Yes..."
	"Move away from the lock, we are going to have to cut with a
plasma gun."
	"Affirm..."
	Gresha pointed the gun to the lock, angled away so as not to
fire into the ship when it would penetrate the door.  Plasma
leapt out.  The hull ribs glowed.  Again the plasma blasted,
licking away the outer most of the obstructing struts.  A third
blast ate away at the abstract sculpture of twisted struts and
plates, and a fog sprang from the seals of the airlock as the
ship\'s atmosphere began to leak away.
	"This may take some time..." thought Gresha aloud.
	Two minutes later they had a hole large enough to see
through.  Jietlshaiepr floated carefully among the molten
wreckage to the hole.
	The inside\'s of the ship was a mess.  Duct work and pipes
had collapsed, but she could see a place where she could stand.
"Roland\'s cruiser did a great job on this ship."
	Jietlshaiepr vanished and reappeared inside the hulk.
She caught herself from falling as she adjusted to the ship\'s
artificial gravity field.
	A vacc suited figure lay on the deck among five inflated
rescue balls.  "Ensign Ebladatl?"
	The figure lay unmoving.  Jietlshaiepr checked the face
plate.  Grease and blood was smeared on the young Ensign\'s face.
"Dead?"
	An eye lid fluttered, no more.
	Ebladatl was like a feather in her arms as Jietlshaiepr
teleported outside.
	"Vole, take him to the gig.  I\'ll have to teleport back in
for the others."
	- XVII -
	Shtam piloted the Gig back to the hospital complex.  "ETA,
one hour fifteen minutes."
	Jietlshaiepr moved quickly, the two crewmen were the worst
off.  She and Vole stripped them of their irradiated rescue
balls.  Radiation sickness well advanced.  High fever, hair gone,
skin deterioration, tumors... "Good thing we\'re in the Fan Belt."
	"Hmm.  Looks like Ebladatl has been regenerating himself,
he\'s psionic."  Jietlshaiepr carefully examined the medical
readouts.  "Traces of Psi-double, probably taken a week ago.
give him another and he may be able to regenerate in a few hours.
He must have been using the last of his energy to send the
distress call.
	"Shtam, have the hospital standing by with two doses of Psi-
double."
	- XVIII -
	Two hours later the Zhodani fleet crews were boiling over.
The Deadhead\'s had fired on the Uttova.  They\'d been asking for
war for years.  This time they\'d get what\'s coming to them.  Ten
Zhdits class destroyer escorts, eight Zhdine missile corvettes,
four Shivva class patrol frigates prepared to jump to Acrolund to
catch the Impie if it was still lurking there.
	High Consul Tlievriashav listened briefly to Jietlshaiepr
but was not convinced.  Their sighting was interesting but surely
there was some mistake.  The Imperials would not let one of their
newest battle cruisers fall into pirate hands.  And the
disposition of all such cruisers was known:  All in service save
one converted to a prison, two destroyed, one lost, presumed
destroyed years ago.
	Besides Tlievriashav had seen the Kliemoshie, the
instruments could not be considered that reliable anyhow.  The
Ine Givar ship could not have been a Kinunir class cruiser.  And
why would the Ine Givar attack their own allies anyway?
	Such a cruiser would be a valuable resource, what private
group would risk damaging it by tangling with a Consular patrol
frigate on an interdicted planet?  Acrolund had nothing of value,
it\'s own nuclear war had seen to that.
	No, the lying deadheads must have struck.  They came in with
the cruiser pretending to be the relief ship and attacked.  Why?
Who knows what devious plot the vicious liars had in mind.
Consular-Imperial relations were running fairly smoothly at the
moment.  But, with the Fourth Frontier War twenty years old, is
the Imperium now secretly preparing for war?
	- XIX -
	Ensign Ebladatl smiled at his nurse and scratched him behind
his armor plated ears.  "Good boy."
	Vole looked at Ebladatl for a moment before replying.
"Woof.  Woof.  Now hold still, I\'m not finished with your
physical."  Vole shook his head slowly to himself.
	"Well, Ensign you seem to be doing well." commented
Jietlshaiepr as she watched the proceedings.
	Ebladatl grinned broadly at the curvaceous surgeon.  "I sure
am, Doc!  I owe you my life.  I can\'t really thank you enough...
How are Selen and Chtanch?"
	"They\'ll recover.  Not as quickly as you, artificial
regeneration takes some time."
	"Thank you!"
	"Wait till you get my bill." she quipped.
	"Send it to the Navy."
	"Suppose you tell me about the attack."
	"Well sure!" smiled the Ensign eager to impress the
beautiful surgeon.  "We picked up a ship bearing in on us, but
with it\'s transponder cut off.  They wouldn\'t answer our radio
either.  The captain gave the order to scramble the fighters so I
ordered them off, I was the fighter coordinator.  The fighters
came in close enough for visual, and with telepathy, I could see
through their eyes it was a Kinunir class cruiser.
	"Now, let me explain about Acrolund, since the nuclear war
there, the Consulate and Imperium have been blockading the system
so that the planet will be forced to get back on it\'s own two
feet.  We protect them from pirate raiders that would want to
plunder the place, and generally keep it safe.
	"Our relief ship was to be Imperial one because we trade off
in shifts.  Any way, we assumed there were some communication
problems with them so we held our fire."
	Fury crept into the young man\'s voice, "Then, the stupid
liars knocked half of our fighters out of existence.
	"We fought, but their first hit knocked our nuclear damper
out.  They put a nuke into us that fused the maneuver drives and
half the power plant.  The laser and missile turrets burned away.
I think we hit them once or twice.  The captain ordered the
fighters back, we were going to jump out system.
	"But as they docked a nuke destroyed our landing dock and
holed the bridge.  I think I was knocked out for a moment, then I
realized rest of the bridge crew was dead."
	Ebladatl took a deep breath, "Suddenly, I was in command."
	He paused a moment and sat silently before continuing,
"The jump was laid in so I hit the button.  I barely made it into
a pressurized compartment just before the ship jumped.
	"I had to care for the survivors \'cause I was the only one
who could keep going.  I took psi-drugs to keep regenerating
myself, but there was only a few doses.  I was using my
regeneration almost constantly for a week.  Loosing ground
though.  I had to store some before I could have the strength to
make the transmissions.  But I made it.
	"I guess you know the rest of the story."
	"Are you certain that the crew aboard the cruiser was
Imperial?" asked Shtam.
	"Of course they were!  Who else would attack us?  And who
else would be in that kind of cruiser?"
	Shtam quickly explained the presence of the Ine Givar
cruiser.
	Ebladatl didn\'t even consider the thought. "Why should the
Ine Givar attack us?  They\'re psionic.  No, it had to be the
Deadheads.  They have no honesty in their culture, their whole
system is based on lies!  They\'re as bad as the Vargr!  You can\'t
trust any of them!  If I run into the Deadheads again, they won\'t
know what hit them." Ebladatl promised.
	- XX -
	Aramat Gas Giant
	Gas giants are often the main source of fuel in frontier
systems.  The fuel is free albeit unrefined, and when a ship need
only refuel one can easily jump into a descending orbit using the
forward momentum of the ship.  The ship opens its intakes, makes
a quick fuel pass, close up scoops and raise itself back to jump
point.  The process takes about 10 hours.  However, during this
time the ship is vulnerable to attack.  Inside the gravity well
of the giant there are few escape routes.  With pirates above,
and crushing pressure below, one gets to feel a bit like the
filling in a sandwich which is about to be eaten.
	"Keep a close watch on the sensors, Jiet." warned Niedrsha,
"We don\'t need any more surprises from unwanted friends."
	"Everything is clear."  muttered Jietlshaiepr, "Nothing on
the neutrino detector.  I\'d have found anything the size of a
scout ship or larger by now."
	"There still could be fighter craft.  A larger ship nearby,
but out of range.  I want a clear scan before we start a dive
into the grav well."
	"Ok," she sighed, "Nothing on the neutrino detectors.
Switching to passive EMS scan."
	Jietlshaiepr studied the screen.  "Nothing accelerating out
there.  There\'s some junk that\'s orbiting the planet but it\'s not
maneuvering... that\'s odd... There\'s an asteroid in a cometary
orbit.  It comes pretty close to the atmosphere.  It must have
been captured recently by the gas giant or it would have burned
up.  Probably will soon anyway."
	"So what." voiced Niedrsha.
	"Well, it\'s just that it... Hold it... Displacement of
asteroid three hundred tons... exact.  It\'s a ship.  Red alert!
Going active!"
	Niedrsha wrestled with the controls while eyeing the
tactical display.  The Flamboyant raised her nose.  The ship
began blazing out of the gas giant\'s gravity well at four G\'s.
"Here we go!"
	Jietlshaiepr read off the readings.  "I make the target out
to be a three hundred ton ship, refined metal hull, dispersed
structure.  Power unknown.  Acceleration unknown.  It\'s just
sitting there."
	"Then we\'ve got em." grined Niedrsha.  "Prepare to open
fire."
	"It\'s still just sitting there.  In fact... wait a minute...
It\'s tumbling!"
	"Tumbling?"
	Jietlshaiepr looked up.  "Power out put zero.  Maneuver
zero.  It\'s just drifting in space."
	"It\'s a trap." said Niedrsha decisively.  "We\'ll head out
and continue scanning."
	Shtam came over the intercom.  "If it is a trap, we should
probably power down the reactor.  We will be less conspicuous to
a neutrino detector."
	"Right, Shtam." replied Niedrsha, "Take the power down to
factor four.  With that I still have enough maneuvering power.
When I\'ve got us in a safe orbit, cut it down to minimum."
	The Flamboyant continued to rise, looking in every direction
for signs of pursuit.
	- XXI -
	The Flamboyant drifted, legs drawn up tight, but with its
eyes wide.
	The other ship continued to tumble.
	Nothing moved.
	"There\'s nothing out there I can find." yawned Jietlshaiepr.
"No power generated, none radiated, no radio, nothing.  That ship\'s
as dead as garrison duty on a saturday night."
	"We\'ve only been looking for a few hours.  I say we sit
tight and wait." warned Niedrsha.
	"How long?" asked Jietlshaiepr.
	"Till we\'re sure."
	"I\'m sure." she sighed.  "Look, in its orbit, the ship comes
pretty high out of the gravity well, probably jumped in system
with a high momentum.  We can match vectors with it while it is
far away from the gas giant, make a close inspection, and not
get caught too deeply by the gravity well."
	- XXII -
	The ship began to grow on the screen.
	"Here we come to the bait." thought Niedrsha aloud.
	The ship was a strange design.  A main cylinder with three
pylons protruding from the center.  Getting closer, the cylinder
resolved itself into a dumb bell shape, but with one end
flattened along one axis.  A heavy framework obscured the lines
of the ship.  Most of the ship was painted yellow and black.
This was marred by sections painted various colors almost none of
which matched:  the effect of this was that the ship resembled
one which had been torn apart and put back together with pieces
of other ships of the same model.
	"What a fuckin\' mess." snarled Niedrsha with disgust. "I\'ve
never seen anything like it."
	"It looks familiar to me." announced Shtam anxiously from
the engine room.  "I think it\'s a Vargr warship design, give me a
minute, and I\'ll get..."
	"It\'s a Vixen." announced Gresha from her turret controls.
	"Of course!" shouted Shtam.  "I should have recognized it.
I have never seen one before.  Wow!"
	"She\'s hot." called Jietlshaiepr.  "Reading radioactives
over there."
	"What?" asked Niedrsha anxiously.
	"It\'s armed with nuclear warheads." she warned.
	"Any power readings?"
	"None.  I would have told you."  Jietlshaiepr closed her
eyes to concentrate.  Slowly, and hesitantly she reached out for
frequencies not used in electromagnetics.  Psionic wavelengths
were as dead as the Vixen\'s fusion reactor.  "Well, after all
this time, I\'ve learned this much of telepathy:  There is no life
aboard that thing."
	"Vixens are robot missile strikers." explained Gresha.
"Usually armed with nukes."
	"They are also incapable of refueling themselves." called
Shtam.  "This one must have run out of fuel.  They are generally
used as first strike waves in wars.  A fleet of Vixens jump into
a system and attack shipping or conduct surface bombardment.
There\'s a robot crew so they are completely expendable.  A bit
expensive, but they are generally considered nothing more than a
missile bus.  A MIRV with a jump drive."
	"Merv?  who\'s Merv?" asked Miakr.
	Shtam spelled it out "Multiple independently-targetable
re-entry vehicles.  A type of missile that carries more than one
warhead."
	"Oh."
	"The Vixen carries a fifty ton missile bay, and three triple
missile turrets." continued Shtam.  "Of course no ship that small
has the structure to take the strain of that much firepower.
Generally, the ships shake themselves apart."
	"That\'s probably what happened to this one." commented
Jietlshaiepr.  "The hull sections show as having been under
extreme stress.  But the stress lines are odd.  The don\'t match...
It could be that the ship was cannibalized from several ships to
get a complete one."
	"Could the fuckin\' thing be a trap?" asked Niedrsha.  "It\'s
got atomic warheads."
	"But there\'s no power being generated." objected
Jietlshaiepr.
	"It could still be booby trapped." pointed out Gresha.
	Shtam\'s voice came over the intercom authoritatively,
"Right, I suggest we send over a boarding party consisting of
myself, Gresha, and Miakr.  We can investigate it without risking
the rest of the ship."
	"Why us?" asked Miakr.
	"I\'ll go to evaluate the engines, Gresha obviously knows a
Vixen on sight, we need you to evaluate the condition of the
robots aboard."
	"I\'ll come too.  He\'ll be needing me." announced Vole.
	- XXIII -
	Gresha pulled the gig close to the tumbling Vixen.
	"Any idea\'s on how to get in?" asked Miakr.
	"There\'ll be an emergency manual hatch switch beside the
main airlock." reported Gresha.  "\'Course that\'s the best place
to leave a trap.  Our best bet\'s the turrets.  The ship\'ll be
depressurized because there\'s no living crew.  We can just open
on up the inspection hatch, and get on in."
	"Easier said than done." observed Vole.  "The ship is
tumbling end over end at a rate of one revolution every seven
point three four seconds.  With a radius of fifteen meters that
will make centripetal force of..."
	"Eleven meters per second per second centripetal
acceleration." interrupted Miakr.  "Just over one standard G."
	Shtam picked up the tethers he had ready, "We will secure
lines to the hull framework and climb to the turret on the pylon.
Any of you ever done any repelling before?"

:I know the discussion is concerning starships, but currently civilians

Intersting.  I just recently got a thing from the EAA (experimental

administration - a government body) new policy on civilians with 
privately-held surplus USSR aircraft.

You\'re supposed to remove or "render inoperable" the guns.  Remove all
other weapons *and their mounts*, and remove or "render inoperable" the
ejection seat.  I guess they don\'t want abandonded aircraft coming down
on people\'s heads.  

Looks the policy is one of making sure the main differences between the
boy scouts and the army are "the scouts have adult leadership and the army
has heavy artillery"  :=)

However, most pilots I know _do_ carry sidearms, which is a contravention

A TL 8 hand computer can have 2 meg RAM.  Talk to someone with a Psion
Series 3 or a Hewlett-Packard 95.

A TL 9, or maybe even late TL 8 hand computer will have 20 meg of something.
It won\'t be a hard disc as we know it, because gyroscopic effects would
make using a hard disc in a hand computer a bad idea.  (An ACR with a 20 MB
hard disc supplying both gyro-stabilisation and data on the enemy\'s forces
might be an idea, though. :-)  But I would not be surprised to see some
sort of chip become available, such as the next generation of Flash EPROM,
which allows that sort of storage in a hand computer.

And a TL 11 hand computer?  That would probably have at least 100 MB in
some sort of memory, be it RAM, EPROM or whatever is being used at TL 11.

I can give you a stat on the other side.  In 1917, a Belgian relief ship 
collided with a French munitions carrier in Halifax Harbour; the Mont 
Blanc caught fire and 2 766 tons of picric acid, TNT and guncotton 
exploded.  Two and a half square kilometers of Halifax were flattened by 
the blast, the subsequent tidal wave, or the raging fire started when 
buildings collapsed in on burning stoves and furnaces. Windows were shattered 
in Truro, a hundred kilometers away.

The Halifax Explosion remains the world\'s greatest man-made non-nuclear 
explosion.

Bit of trivia and a bit of data. Help any?

We only really have one explicit rule, so it must be #1.

I guess we go by the corollary to this, too, namely:

Umm... I am afraid it gets more absurd than that, given modern technology.... 
Apparently, some researcher in California has come out with a 3D memory storage
unit that holds about 4 Tera (yes, Tera)(!!!!)  bytes of ROM. Any part of the 
storage can be accessed (by orders of magnitude) faster than modern computers
can handle. The size: about that of a sugar cube.
	(Quick Illustrative Analogy: equivalent to -- about 1K file on every 
person on the planet, enough for 500 library of congresses, etc. etc. etc.)
	The problem: right now, information stored on the device lasts about 8
hours at room temperature, and only a couple of months at liq. helium
temperatures. (Note: any inorganic chemist who wants to become REALLY rich
might think about working on a more durable analog than what is out there today.
	I forget the details (who, when,where,etc )-- but I remember seeing it i
in the New York Times. I will post with further info.

*Traveller*, here\'s my general FRP gaming rules...

1.  GMs and players incapable of maintaing civilized adult
    interpersonal interactions under *all* circumstances need
    not apply.  The fact that one is playing a game doesn\'t
    excuse one adopting a dismal standard of behavior (although
    the way certain people on this list have been going on
    lately, I\'m not sure I\'d want to interact with them outside
    the gaming environment either (1/2 :-)).

2.  GMs and players without a healthy or better sense of humor
    need not apply either.  This is important enough to rate
    rule #2 by itself.

3.  The GM and players are meeting to work together at having
    fun.  Anybody who\'s not trying hard to have fun and to help
    everybody else in the room have fun should go away.
    Corollary:  nobody "wins" at an FRP game.  Or everybody
    does.  The (real-life) competition is against boredom and
    ennui, not against each other.

4.  One only buys the rules to help keep the gaming company in
    business, and thus producing other useful gaming materials.
    One should, in fact, ignore or change the rules at any
    plausible opportunity.  Last I checked, we\'re doing fantasy,
    not rule-playing.  This rule will only work if the GM and
    most of the players are reasonable people.  See rules 1-3
    above.

5.  Roleplay, roleplay, roleplay.  If one has trouble
    roleplaying, one should pick a character so far from one\'s
    own self image that one *has* to roleplay to play at all.
    The GM must be a roleplayer par excellence.

6.  No fewer than 3 players (excluding GM), no more than 6.
    These numbers are completely empirical, and the *very best*
    groupings can probably get away with 7 players, while lame
    groupings should have no more than 4, if they choose to
    play at all.

7.  Always try to find a convenient resolution (in the music-
    theoretical sense) within 3-4 hours of the start of the
    gaming session.  People\'s brains can\'t take more continuous
    gaming than that.  (Of course, second and even third
    sessions are both permissible and encouraged, but the group
    should resolve things quite a bit and take at least a
    half-hour break first.)  Again, these numbers are empirical,
    but highly recommended.

Thanks much for an interesting exercise -- the process of
formalizing and ordering these rules really helped me see what
I\'ve been doing.  Major flames, anyone?

Late Tech 8 or tech 9??? What about today\'s technology? I just read this 
in the latest (May 1992 p61) issue of Network Computing:

GRiD has announced PalmPAD, the first wearable pen computer, a 2.8 pound
full-featured pen-based PC with a 6.5 inch backlit screen, 2Mb of RAM, and
a slot for a 20-Mb *solid state* "Disk Drive". molded rubber and plastic
package that can pass a three foot drop test on concrete. One cable provides
power and comm link allowing well-dressed power users to turn their belts
into expansion buses. Dubbed Belt Bus, the "LAN that is worn around your
belt" will accommodate "future belt-mounted peripherals, such as printers, 
magnetic stripe readers, and batteries". The main unit\'s grip is hollowed
out to fit either 2,400-bps data-fax modem or a spread-spectrum radio
modem (microwave technology). Base price: US$ 2,895

    The following message includes a note from GDW (guess they are tired
about being flamed personally). But first I want to get two cents in
on a couple of things.

    To make a long message short:

    FIRST OFF, the last couple of bundles have included some FLAMES,
personally I\'m not particularly interested in watching gamers flame
each other about good GM/Player vs. bad GM/Player, I\'ve heard it all
before, and especially since I have to pay for the Internet access,
I don\'t appreciate bandwidth taken up by wasted words (even if I didn\'t
pay, I don\'t appreciate the wasted storage). SO IF YOUR GOING TO FLAME
each other keep it PRIVATE.

    Secondly, I\'m tired of hearing about the same complaints about
Traveller or MT (new ones are okay). What I would be interested in seeing
is fixes, or helpful suggestions and I haven\'t seen as many of those
as I would like to see.

    And as for a third generation of Traveller, considering that the
game is nearly as old as D&D (or AD&D to you younger guys <grin>), a third
edition is perhaps not out of line, especially as the second was somewhat
incomplete (to phrase it one way at least).

OTHER MESSAGES,

Catie Helm,
    I believe it was you that mentioned a write-up on a race called
"Racoonoids", I might be interested in such an article (name would
definitely have to be changed though, too Space Operish to me).


    <CYBERTECHNOLOGY> Most game systems nowadays presume the the technology
use the brains normal existing nervous system pathways (as do some modern day
prosthetic devices).
    Now about 16 years I do recall reading articles that talked about direct
brain/computer hookups that did not use the existing pathways. They tended
to presume it would be easier to map the brain out and develop the equipment
to hook in. At that time they expected the technology to be available around
the mid 90\'s. About the only technology that I am aware of that currently
exists is the wristwatch pagers and credit card radios (providing the
communications pathway to the computer database) and some work done
use old apple computers to help paraplegics walk. But no direct brain
interface yet (although those developments are about 2-3 years old too).
    About the only possible problem with cybertechnology is that
Nanotechnology might quickly replace it in part.

You all have seen me get up on my soap box from time to time to
complain, but It isn\'t very often that I\'ve seen someone step up
on one to proclaim victory!  :-)

Challenge 61 is out.  Just read through it.

There is a pretty good adventure thing by Terry McInnes concerning
a nuclear powered wet navy on TL 6 Aramanx (Powderkeg of the
Towers Cluster)

(Well *I* liked it anyway.  Remember who it was who put out so many
Wet Navy designs before there were any rules to do so!  And most of
those ships were TL 6 too!  :-)

But what is the excitment about?  I hear you all wondering.  Well,
Fission power.  They have finally revised the fission power fuel
requirements.  I can\'t exactly figure out what they did, but I have
been able to get the following approximations from their ship
designs.

The nuclear fission reactor power plant now provides:
Power Output:	   0.2MW per Kiloliter of power plant.
Fuel consumption:  0.05Kl of fuel per 360 days.

(Fuel consumption is still way to high, but it is better than it was before)

Weight and cost of the plant I have not calculated.

Fuel consumption of Fission plants has been a pet peeve of mine
for a while.  Ever since I calculated that the USS Nautilus would
have consumed 90 percent of it\'s mass in uranium if it had been built
according to the original MegaTrav specs.  :-P

So, this is kinda neat. (But only to the design freaks out there)  But
it does bring some interesting things up.  Using the above power plant
(TL6) it is JUST barely possible to built a traveller starship that
can be fueled for an entire year.  Rather than 30 days as with normal
Fusion power.  (The main problem is weight)

So... Fusion is less efficient than Fission?  How interesting... :-(
(Sigh)

What is worse is that the above reactor is TL 6.  Now imagine what
increases in efficiency there would be in a higher tech fission plant?
Well with the more advanced shielding from superdense materials.  Not to
mention nuclear dampers to play with, what is a TL 15 fission plant gonna
look like?

Well, despite this, I consider it a victory.  SOMEBODY up there finally
noticed that the fission plants were WAY off.  I think Rob Dean once
mentioned to someone that fission plants as stated were rediculous.  Maybe
somehow it was that mention that worked it\'s way into the acticle.  Or
maybe someone up there read one of my endless tirades on how nuclear
powered designs were completely impossible with MegaTrav.  Or (gasp!)
someone was smart enough to figure it out by themselves!

Nevertheless, it is a small step forward to bringing Trav closer to
reality!  YAHOO!  :-)

What next I wonder?  Will GDW begin making MORE corrections where Trav is
WAY off in terms of reality?  Well... Lemme get my list...  Lessee...

Thrust to weight ratio?
Where every Type A Free trader has the thrust to weight ratio 3 times that
of an SR-71 and is barely able to reach Mach 1...

Aircraft engine rated thrusts?
Where every engine has five or six times the thrust it should have?

What else?

Hmmm...
I ususally call anyone who can\'t spell my name correctly (when He/she
is copying it from other written matter) an idiot, but let that pass.
 
Reasons for thinking the people who generated MT are idiots:
 
     1)  COACC.  I\'m one of the few people who post to the TML
regularly who LIKED COACC.  But I NEVER use it, because the various
engines presented on page 32 all have performances that are out to
lunch.  None of those engines (except the fusion rocket) have NOT been
built, so it should have been a simple matter to look up actual
thrust/fuel usage/mass figures, and use them.  The people responsible
didn\'t bother, so you have rockets with higher Isp than jets.  Your
(yes, I know that you personnally had nothing to do with COACC (or at
least your name isn\'t mentioned on the credits)) fusion rocket has an
Isp of 2,000,000,000 and change.  Which translates to an exhaust
velocity of 19,656,000 Km/s, which you should notice is 65.565 times
the speed of light.
     2)  Neutrino detectors.  You all inserted a neutrino detector
into your starship design sequence that fits in a suitcase.  This
device was supposed to be able to detect the neutrino emmissions from
a 10Kw power plant at long range (if it couldn\'t detect a 10Kw power
plant, then the 10Kw rating was pretty silly).  Considering what we
know about neutrinos, its fairly safe to say that catching enough of
them to make detection meaningful would require a substance, which, if
plated over a ship as armour, would make the ship immune to trivial
things like meson guns, particle beams, and nuclear weapons.  We
bogused up an explanation that didn\'t require perfect armour to be
invented along with the neutrino detector, but I doubt our explanation
could work unless the detector were the size of a Mac truck, as
opposed to a small suitcase.
     3)  Spacecraft with a density 4+ times that of platinum.  Try
it.  Design a spacecraft with armour 115 (bonded superdense, of
course).  Put all the usual contents (J-drive, M-drive, P-plant, etc)
inside.  Then divide computed mass by computed volume.  Density 85+.
     4)  10,000 year old technology that has never been improved
enough to bring the price down from point of introduction (LPHG grav
modules)
     5)  A trade system which makes merchandise more expensive if
BUILT (not bought) away from a large rail-center.  I can believe that
the products of Nakege are more expensive to buy at Efate, but I find
it hard to believe that when I go to Nakege, they are marking things
up above the price I would have to pay elsewhere.  Great way to make
sure I don\'t go there, terrible way to assume economics work.
     6)  For that matter, a trade system in an adventure kind of game
that encourages the players to stay near the center of civilization. 
Arguably the best thing to do with your shiny new ship is to run back
and forth between Efate and Louzy until it gets paid off.  You get
gobs of money that you would never see wandering around among "E" and
"D" starports in the boonies.
     7)  The generation of star types for the worlds of the Spinward
Marches that places Ag worlds around M7 V (0534, 1526, 2231), M6 V
(0614, 1817, 2908), M9 V (0710, 0732, 2523, 3004), M5 V (1210, 3138),
M8 VI (1912), M9 D (2324), F3 D (2912), none of which are in the
habitable zone, because there IS NO HABITABLE ZONE for those stars. 
And if you can get "Ag" without being in the habitable zone, then why
is "Ag" even meaningful, when ANYONE can grow crops under ideal
conditions in a dome?
     8)  Trade class "In", which assumes that you cannot have lots of
industry without a polluted atmosphere, even though the major source
of air pollution (burning oil/coal/etc) stopped with the advent of
fusion power some thousands of years ago.
     9)  Fission power plants for vehicles/starships with fuel usage
rather more than 1000 times as high as REAL fission plants have.  By
your rules, the submarine I was on should have had to carry 58,500
tons of fuel to operate as it did.  Since the boat only massed
7000-odd tons, I\'m pretty sure it DIDN\'T carry that much fuel.  This
is information available in any good university library.  Along with
that, fissionable fuel that has a density higher than iridium.
     10)  Laser/maser communicators that use more power than radios.
     11)  Hard Times.  Which either should be MUCH worse than it is,
or not nearly so bad as it is.  You managed to find the ONE point to
stabilize at that is unstable - it should either fix itself quickly
(ten years or so), or collapse back to the stone age (in a century or
less).  And the adventure/campaign in Hard Times provides the "good
guys" with a ship that can beat the whole "bad guy" fleet without
assistance.  So why bother with the rest of the adventure/campaign?
     12)  Data dsiplay headsets.  Introduced at TL13 in MT. 
Introduced four or five years ago in the real world.
 
     I\'m frankly getting tired of typing, so I\'ll stop here.  Is this
enough reason for me to suspect the MT designers are idiots?  If not,
I\'ll gladly send more.
 
     But, be that as it may, I was speaking largely facetiously when I
called you all "idiots".  I think you all made a great TRY at
integrating the disparate elements in your rules.  I just wish it had
been a great success.  You introduced a task system (which is great!),
and a vehicle system (which falls apart near the limits), then didn\'t
bother to integrate starship design/combat into the vehicle system. 
You added in aircraft, without ever bothering to insert into the rules
a good reason for them existing after the introduction of grav.  You
publish modules where ships specifically described as having no fuel
scoops are seen to be scooping fuel at a gas giant (Knightfall). 
"Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium" (Shattered Ships of the
Fighting Imperium?) includes a large number of ships that violate your
own rules (check the armour values assigned to BB-11, BB-12, BL-13,
BM-15, BH-14, BH-15), and almost no ships that are especially
combat-effective.  That\'s just careless, sloppy work with a bad
spreadsheet, which is supposed to be caught by editors.
 
     BTW, I do NOT disapprove of your third edition of Traveller.  And I
don\'t approve of it because of your second edition, but in spite of it. 
But let\'s see some good work, with an editor who EDITs, rather than
spell-checks with his word-processor.  And a little reality checking
wouldn\'t hurt, either.
 
     Last comments:  If you need someone to give something a fine-tooth
"internal logic check", I\'m always here.  And you would probably get
more MT stuff for Challenge if you (a) payed a little better, or (b)
tried less hard to appear as if you were dumping MT in your eternal
quest to separate us from more of our money.  At the very least, I\'d
send you stuff better than most of the stuff you do publish for MT.  And
WHY did you dump 2300AD and 1889???  What was done was among your best
work since the original Traveller, but now it\'s gone, never to return...

}Subject: (4095) Alternate Starship Combat System
}Variant starship combat rules. Fighters have more chance to knock out a
}battleship, but only if they are in large formations. Ships or fighters
}with armor-120 can now be damaged by weapons smaller than factor-T.

Hmm, according to the design tables in the Referee\'s Guide, this should NOT
be a problem until Tech Level 24.  (Max armor is TL *5)  So the max armor
available in the Imperium (That *I* wanna deal with) is Armor=75G at TL 15).
But then again, Shattered Ships of the Squabbling Imperium is chock full of
the things and other assorted errors.

}2. Damage Point Computation
}  The component hit points computed during design evaluation are not used
}in the current combat rules. This variant uses them.
}  First, we will compute the damage points each type of weapons does.
}  Turret mounted weapons do 10*UCP in damage. A bay weapon does 20*UCP in
}damage. Spinal mounts do 100*UCP in damage.
}  Nuclear and anti-matter do four times the precalculated damage. Example:
}a UCP-3 turret firing nuclear missiles does 120 points of damage ((3*10)*4).

I like it.  A way we can actually USE those damage point numbers we\'ve been
patiently calculating and recording and never using.  Sounds like a good
idea.

}  Hull. To find out when the armor factor is reduced, divide the
}inoperative value by the armor factor. The Planet has an inoperative hull
}value of 67500 and an armor factor of 50. Each 1350 hits received reduce the
}armor factor by one.

I kind of like the idea that a weapon still causes damage even though it
may not penetrate the hull.  I heartily appaud this idea.  Assigning chassis
damage is a good idea.  Also burning it\'s armor off sounds plausible.

}Computer. I had trouble making damage plausible without being too
}devastating. Weapons with a UCP of 1-4 give "Computer-1", UCP of 5-9 gives
}"Computer-2", and UCP-A gives "Computer-3." On exceptional success reduce the
}computer factor by an additional one.

Hmm, my reading of the damage tables must be slightly different from yours.
I understood that Computer-1 would knock one computer off line, Computer-2
takes 2, and so on.  In High Guard we knocked the computer level down.  So
what gives?

}7. Optional Sensor Rules
}  Make all sensor tasks one level less difficult if the target is in an
}adjacent hex.
}Make active sensor tasks one level more difficult:
}o if the target is within a gas giant, 
}o when attempted through a hex where a nuclear missile has exploded.
}o if target uses jamming.
}Neutrino detection:
}o If target\'s EMLevel is faint, give a -1 DM to neutrino scans.
}o If target\'s EMLevel is strong, give a +1 DM to neutrino scans.

Don\'t forget background neutrinos.  (The sun... high population planets
where everybody owns a fusion powered air/raft... etc.)

}Densitometer detection:
}o If target is small, give a -1 DM to densitometer scans.
}o If target is large, give a +1 DM to densitometer scans.
}o Increase detection task difficulty by one level if detection is
}attempted through a planet or moon with size 5+ or through a planetoid belt.

All the above sound like good ideas.  However the range and detection of
sensors needs work.  As far as I can see, it is just about impossible to
detect a ship at the rated range of the sensors.  Now I can understand that
a sensor could detect other ships out to far orbit range, but even with a
model 9 computer and a Far orbit range sensor, you just can\'t detect them
that far.  So what does a \'Far Orbit\' sensor detect?  What does an
\'Interstellar\' sensor detect?  If the answer is nothing, why then are they
called that?

You see, my good old astigmatic Mark I eyeball is a passive sensor that can
detect objects at GALACTIC ranges.  *Without* my glasses.  But it hardly
can distinguish a ship at ranges of more than a few tens of kilometers.

Therefore, the range bands of sensors need clarification.

}Time and distance. I plan to scale down the time and distance scale in
}starship combat from 20 minutes/25000km to 4 minutes/5000km. For longer combat
}turns, more damage must be given for each hit.

Bad Idea.  In my experience, opposing ships open fire as soon as they are
within range.  (Far orbit)  With 4 minute turns and 5000 km hexes how big
a board are you gonna have to plot the movement on?  Far orbit range would
leave you with 100 hexes to worry about.  It gets rediculous!  If each hex
is a centimeter, your map needs to be a meter across.  In my experince,
combat lasts several turns say 10?  In forty minutes, ships will not close
significantly from Far Orbit ranges.  By the time they got within close range
(to use fusion guns and where meson gun performance goes up) They will be
lifeless drifting rocks burned to bits by laser batteries and missiles.

}  Movement: I am inclined to make some changes in the movement rules.
}  First, I want to make heading changes somewhat more difficult. As in
}Interceptor or Leviathan, it costs thrust points to change heading. What I
}want to do is require a certain number of hexes travelled at a given velocity
}before allowing a one hex side course change. How many hexes to travel may
}depend on both maneuver gee and/or agility. Using this rule would make it
}appropriate to limit the arc of the spinal mount to forward.

Hold it right there!  Are you telling me that a ship with (at the very least)
1 G thrust to mass ratio CAN\'T bring it\'s nose to bear on target EVEN in
the FOUR MINUTE time intervals you suggest?  No WAY!  If a ship can not turn
faster than that, then agility would have no hope of bringing any correction
help in avoiding fire.

And given the fact that they are (and should remain) 20 minute turn intervals,
I have some trouble seeing any firing arc restrictions.  Even the ones we
currently use!

What you are suggesting sounds vaguely reminiscent of the fact that aircraft
cannot instantly bring their nose to bear on target as they approach higher
and higher speeds.  In a vaccum this will not be a problem:  No wings.

Changing VECTORS is a totally different story.  You can\'t suddenly switch
your heading by 180 degrees without applying your maneuver drive.  ie you
can\'t be moving 12 hexes per turn in one direction and in the next turn
be heading in the opposite direction at the same speed.  (unless you have
a Maneuver drive with 24G\'s behind it!)

(I haven\'t read MEgaTrav combat very well, PLEASE don\'t tell me you can do
that with their rules...  I still go by the Mayday movement rules)

I don\'t know about Leviathan or Interceptor or the type of game they are
trying to create.  But this sounds like you are trying to get the feel of
a more World War I & II type of air combat:  Dogfighting.  Well, with the
ranges and weapons involved, I\'m afraid it will be more akin to 2 F-14
Tomcats detecting each other *Well* beyond visual range and fireing Pheonix
missiles at each other at something like a hundred nautical miles.

}DAMAGE RESULTS
}Fuel Tank. I\'m going to change the "fuel tank shattered" to "fuel leak".
}A certain amount of fuel will be lost per turn. Subsequent hits will make the
}leak more severe.

In a 20 minute turn, a fuel tank that is open to space will evacuate itself.
Even a slow leak.  I have trouble seeing it not empty itself even in the
four minute intervals you suggest.  If there is a leak, that fuel in that
compartment will be lost immediately.  It won\'t bleed off slowly unless it is
a tiny leak.  A self sealing tank should be well able to handle any such tiny
leaks.

}Hull Inoperative. There is no effect in the standard rules (or my
}variant) for an inoperative hull, when that damage level is reached. My
}suggestions are:
}y restrict craft to 1G
}y prohibit atmosphere entry
}y hull is breached

All these sound good.

}y stress severely limits heading changes

No.  If the structure is sound enough to take 1G acceleration, it can
certainly stand rotational stresses which would be negligible in a four
minute combat turn and zero in a 20 minute one.

}y Agility drops to zero

How so if it can still push 1G?

}y may not fire spinal mount

Hmmm.  I don\' know.  At the Inoperative position, the hull has not collapsed
yet, that indicates to me that the spine of the ship is still intact.

}y Craft may not be recovered. They may be launched.

That doesn\'t make sence.  If there is an open path for ships to leave, then
there exists a path for them to enter.  I think you are confusing slow
relative velocity docking maneuvers with carrier deck operations.  Carrier
deck operations are of necessity held at high speeds to prevent aircraft
from stalling.  In vaccum it is absolutely impossible for spacecraft to stall.
(Shades of Battlestar Galactica  :-P)

}y Rapid Launch Facilities are inoperative.

I dunno, the spine is still intact.  Why would this happen?
Remember:  rapid launch does not mean carrier steam catapults.

}y Fuel leak.

Sounds good.

Scott "2G" Kellogg

On a completely different subject,
Mr. Borich, I\'m not going to respond to your attack concerning flames.
I\'m sure some of our more irrascable members will do that.  I will however
SUGGEST that in future the way to extinguish flames is with water, not flame.

And if you are interested in solutions to particular problems with Trav and
MegaTrav, I would point you to the archives to find the numerous discussions
on problems percieved and solutions proposed.  If you have any particular
problems in mind, I suggest you address them yourself so that discussion may
ensue.  I think you will find this preferable rather than waiting for others
to bring them up if you find the wait so disturbing.

Sincerely,
Scott S. Kellogg

	Not that it has any significant bearing on Traveller,
but I thought I ought to properly explain the why behind the FAA\'s
"take it all off" ruling about ex-soviet warplanes in civilian hands.

	The Federal Bureau of Alcohol and Firearms (BATF) regulates
among other things weapons sales and import/export in the US,
from handguns to nuclear missiles (though nobody\'s ever asked for that
particular permit... it does exist on paper, tho 8-).
	A normal civilian simply cannot within the US own what\'s
term a Weapon of Mass Destruction.  You have to be registered as
an Arms Dealer to have one, not an impossible (or even all that
expensive; I spend more many years on Gaming stuff than the permit
would cost for that level...) task, but one that few people do.
	If you\'re not a dealer, then you can\'t have a Weapon of 
Mass Destruction.  Aircraft and Tanks (and ships and missiles and...)
all fall under the Weapons of Mass Destruction category.  Any aircraft
that was origionally a combat aircraft is a weapon.
	To "de-weaponify" one, you have to honest to god make it impossible
to put weapons back in without making serious modifications... i.e. take
the weapons and mounts both out, remove weapons pylons from the
outside, etc.  The FAA isn\'t the one making this rule; it\'s the BATF.
I don\'t know about the Ejection Seat, but civilians in the US have
owned them before (a civil-owned F-104 set a new speed-at-height record
at one point, then went out of control.  The pilot ejected and
survived).  I would guess that either these are the ejection seats
that use a cannon shell as the ejection charge (ouch), or that
the FAA will grant specific exemptions later (perhaps) to people who
prove they\'ll treat and maintain the (dangerous) ejection seats right.

	Here\'s an optional MegaTraveller craft design sequence
modification/optional rule that I\'d like some comments on...

CRAMPED ENGINE ROOMS
	The average drive on a MegaTraveller craft only takes up half
of the physical volume it\'s placed within.  The listed space requirements
include sufficient space for easy access to all parts, and for easy
disassembly and maintenance.
	It is possible to design a craft without this margin of extra
space, but this will result in more difficult maintenance.
	If a drive is only given 90% of its listed space, it will require
10% more maintenance time (or 110% the engineering crew) a normal drive
requires.  In addition, all maintenance tasks done on a time-constrained
basis (such as damage control and emergency repairs) have a DM of -1.
Remember, that with only 90% of the space, there\'s a 20% reduction in
the actual work space to do maintenance in.
	If a drive has only 80% of its listed space, it requires 20%
more maintenance time and all hasty tasks recieve a DM of -2.
	If a drive has only 70% of its listed space, it requires 40% more
maintenance time (or 140% of the engineering crew) and all maintenance
and repair tasks are one difficulty level harder, no matter how much time
is available.
	If a drive has only 60% of its listed space, it requires 100%
more maintenance time (or 200% the normal crew) and tasks more significant
than minor repairs cannot be done without opening up the hull to get more
access space to components.  All tasks that can be performed are two
difficulty levels harder.
	If an additional cost of 10% of the base
drive cost is paid, access panels can be included in the hull
to allow access at "normal" repair rates to the drive on a vessel with
60% (or more) volume allocated.
Otherwise, the craft will have to be stopped at a starport and
have the hull welded open to get to components, at a cost that is
equal to the percentage of the hull (metal) cost that the drive
in question occupies.

This got me thinking.  Has anybody calculated what sort of impetus a
close-range nuke would apply to a well-armored ship?  All that armor
isn\'t going to do an awful lot of good if the ship ends up thrown with
20 G\'s of acceleration for a not-so-small duration of time.  Kinda like
subs being tossed around by depth charges - eventually you\'ll compromise
structural integrity of the ship (and the crew\'s bodies).

What was that conversion factor between joules and Megatons of TNT...

This is a good idea, but...
 
You\'re reducing the amount of working space to 20% of the normal.
Then you\'re saying you can partially counterbalance the difficulty
of getting in that smaller space to repair things by squeezing
MORE people into there?
 
I think the bit about adding additional crew needs to be reworked
to reflect diminishing returns - at some point, adding an extra crew
member is going to cost you because of cramped space.  I think that
point comes well before you reach squeezing your normal crew into
10% of the space they\'re used to (twice the normal crew in 20% of
normal workspace).
 
Say, if you reduce the engine workspace, you still need the same
size crew, but fewer of them can work at once, thus increasing repair
time and difficulty.  Or some variation thereof.

Only one thing I take exception to here:  Less space shouldn\'t require
more engineering crew, since they would only get in each other\'s way
in the cramped space.  I saw enough of that on the submarine to last a
lifetime.  Try requiring more maintenance groundside (for every day in
space, the engineering crew has to work xx% of a day after landing to
get ready for the next flight).

I agree.  I\'m skeptical about burning off armour unless the weapons
are really horrendous (large nukes, spinal mounts, MANY batteries of
lesser stuff).

There is NO "neutrino scan" in this game.  Neutrino detectors are
integrated into PEMS scan tasks.  Neutrino detectors do do pinpoint 
tasks, but EMLevel has little, if anything, to do with neutrino 
emissions, and so should have little to do with associated tasks.  
In any case, the subject is already dealt with in the rules:  faint
EMlevel means you need an exceptional success, strong EMlevel needs 
anything better than exceptional failure.

The first two cases are already dealt with in the rules: small targets
require exceptional success to detect with PasObjScan/Pin, large
objects are detected with anything better than exceptional failure.
The third case assumes you can detect an object through a planet
8000Km thick with a sensor that has a max penetration of 1Km. 
Planetoid belts are mostly (99.9999999999999%) empty space - who cares
whether you hide in one?

Not bright idea, grasshopper.  Original assumption behind scale was
that hex size be distance traveled after time scale acceleration at
one G.  This has changed in MT, until distance scale has little, if
anything, to do with something so trivial as acceleration and
velocity. (proper scale should be 20min/15,000Km (or even 7500Km for
you high realism types (like me)).  Changing to a four minute time
scale requires that the distance scale be reduced to 600Km (or 1000Km
to stay consistant with MT).

Too true.  So don\'t use meson guns and fusion guns.  MT allows a
missile launcher to chunk out 1 shot per minute (in personal combat),
but only 1 shot per twenty minutes in ship combat.  Bringing those two
numbers in closer agreement won\'t bother me very much, even if it DOES
invalidate half the ship designs out there.

NO!!!  If you want to fix movement rules, get back to Mayday rules! 
They are the only set of movement rules that were ever orth the
trouble of writing down (Unless you count "Battlefleet:Mars", which

I assume that fuel tanks are self-sealing (we do it now, why can\'t
they?), and that the fuel tanks are NOT "ONE BIG VOID" in the hull. 
Rather more like a myriad of little, self-contained tanks, linked by
piping with cutout valves that are closed in the event of leakage. 
Net result: fuel leaks are ridiculous, fuel tanks being shattered
slightly less so.  But only slightly.

Why not?  If the spinal mount is intact, it can shoot.  If the hull
can pull one G, then the recoil (if any) of the spinal mount is
irrelevant (unless the ship can pull more than one G backwards using
the spinal mount as a drive)

I don\'t disapprove of a revision of MegaTraveller either. In fact, if
you can repair some of MegaTraveller\'s defects so much the better. But
I strongly disapprove of your plans to invalidate most of the background
information that has been slowly building up over the last 15 years. As
I understand it, you even consider that wealth of information detrimental
in some way. Not I. One of the great problems with a startravelling role-
playing campaign is the sheer amount of information that the PCs should
have at their fingertips, but that the Referee simply haven\'t the time
to provide. Pick up a tourist guide to some country and look through it.
This is the kind of information that a PC should be able to get out of
any decent library data program, not just for every planet around him,
but for each seperate region of every planet around him. That\'s totally
impossible to provide, of course, but at least the information level for
a few of the regions of the Imperium were beginning to approach something
near the absolute bare minimum. And now you want to move the game back-
ground forward through 80 years of social upheaval, thereby ensuring that
only the geographical details will remain valid  -  and not those either
come to think about it... planetary bombardments must surely rearrange
the face of the planets too...

If you persist in your plans I advise you to publish the new rules and
the new background seperately. You will thereby ensure at least one
sale of the rulebook. I\'d be eager to buy improved rules, but I\'m not
going to invest in a new background.

Let me also implore you to keep up support of the current timeline. I
don\'t intend to dump my current campaign and start up a new one 80 years
later with new PCs and NPCs. I\'ve spend too much time building up the
ones I\'ve got now, thank you.

    'body' => '[Jo wakes up again]

	It seems like I only get to read the TML every 2 months. I uploaded
the issues and, lo and behold, the first was from March! Anyway...

	It looks like I am pretty much the only person who has spoken that
can say they almost unreservedly agree with Metlay (4109). It did, however,
touch on one particular well rehersed argument of mine...

	Proposal:		GAME BALANCE IS A MYTH

	Substantiantion:	Any system of rules has a balance point

	Discursion:
		I see the term "game balance" being bandied about a
lot. Usually w.r.t. "I don\'t allow xxx to maintain the game balance."
People change the rules to change the course of the game and make it
adhere to the setting in a way the referee desires more. To me, this is
backwards.
	If you look at a game setting as a point in space. The rules
govern how this point moves (i.e. by player action within the rules)
and the course it traces out can be described as the campaign. I maintain
that given any set of rules there are regions within that space that are
stable. I.e. under the normal course of application of game rules the
campaign will not greatly deviate from that region. These are balance
points.
	The perceived "imbalance" that is observed when people bring up the
myth of game balance is when the referee, out of ignorance or misunderstanding
of the game rules, sets their campaign at a point in the space that is
not within a balance point. When set there the normal course of gaming
action (within the rules) will draw that point, away from the original
setting, toward a region of balance. Thus, over time (sometimes a very
short amount of time) the campaign will move away from the original
region chosen by the referee.
	A referee sees this as undesirable, and unwilling to admit
to ignorance or just unable to perceive it, changes the rules in the
name of game balance. Usually the change in the rule system is not too
drastic which means the new regions of balance are "near" the old ones.
One might suppose that they are nearer the current point of game play.
However, given the campaign is currently accelerating in one direction
it is unlikely to be suddenly in a stable region, despite the fact that
this is the desire of the referee. It will, most likely, start careening
in a different direction under the new rules.
	Thus, as time goes on, the referee continues to change rules and
the campaign zooms from here to there chasing a moving target that it is
unlikely ever to reach.
	The mistake is in the placement of the game. One should consider
rules carefully and try to understand their full implications. Consulting
people who have played for some time is probably a good idea. I wouldn\'t
think one can ever fully understand a gaming system and one\'s target will
almost always be wrong. However you are better off watching the flow of
your campaign to see where it is going. As it deviates from its starting
position its further course will become clearer as more of the rule
implications filter through.
	If you change the rules you will never understand where the
campaign is going. I maintain that you should, instead, accept that there
will be some dynamicism in your campaign. Watch where it goes and be
prepared to flow with it. If you don\'t change the rules it won\'t change
direction and you have a better chance of understanding it fully.

	If you are familiar with mathematical modeling the above will
probably make ready sense to you (the more so if you grok topolocical
spaces :-). On the other hand it may make no sense whatsoever. Think
about it for a minute then either apply it or toss it...


	Different subject: Although quiet I\'ve not been sitting on my hands.
SYSGEN level 5 is nearly ready to hit the streets. It uses the same integrated
environment as LIBRARY which means, unfortunately, it only works on PCs.
In addition to nearly full WBH detail on each of 100 trillion planets
it now supports editing of all details at the expense of about 24K of disk
space per system. Right down to the local customs!
	What I want to finish is the adding and subtracting of entire
planets (i.e. you can only modify existing ones now) and graphical printing
of surfaces (I plan to support FX, HPLJET and PostScript printers). As I
don\'t have a PostScript printer I would appreciate any volunteer to test
that particular bit...
	The hard disk with the manual on it crashed so that will be delayed
(again!) bt there is now an on-line help feature. The .EXE has hit 250K! :-)
	Does GDW really read the TML now? The gods really are watching!
If the gods really are listening perhaps they might be willing to humour
a supplicant and have a look at LIBRARY or SYSGEN. It was designed to be
everything they promised us with the WBH software. I\'m quite sure they
get tons of half-arsed programmers sending them disks upon disks of planetary
generators but I think these are a fair cut above the rest and would beg
their indulgence just this once :-).

I\'ll answer this with the proviso that I may be corrected by any REAL aero-
dynamicists(SP?) out there....

Airplanes run into this problem because they must change COURSE to target an
enemy ship.  Since they only have a limited ability to change heading w/o
changing course, in atmosphere they are essentially the same thing.  Take any
airplane, mount small maneuvering jets in strategic places (nose, tail, wing
tips...) and put it in space and you separate the two.  You can now do things
that any self-respecting plane in atmosphere can\'t (move in direction A while
pointing in direction B)

You change heading with the manuevering jets, and course with the main engine
(if heading <> course).  The problem in atmosphere is that high-G turns put
the plane at the outer rim of a circle.  Since the linear speed is constant,
a smaller circle places a higher G-force on the plane/pilot.  Too much stress
on either the plane\'s structure or the pilot\'s and things start to fall apart.

Take a spaceship, change it\'s COURSE as fast as you change the plane\'s and
you will place an equivalent stress on it\'s structure.  The limiting factor
becomes how much stress the ship\'s/occupant\'s structure can take.  That\'s what
inertial dampers were invented for.

Question:  putting inertial dampers on an airplane should allow you to make
higher-G turns.  The limiting factor here becomes max linear speed (remember
frictional heating) + max rotational speed (which depends on elevator
deflection and moment arms and other things I don\'t want to think about).
True or not?

How big is the leak?  How much fuel is left in the tank?  These things will
all affect how fast the fuel will be lost.  Unless the leak approaches a
significant fraction of the tank size or there isn\'t much fuel left in the
tank, it won\'t be lost immediately.

No news is good news?  GDW opened the discussion of the revision again
on GEnie about a month ago, and there has been little activity.  I guess
that everything that people wanted to say was pretty much said last year
when the issue was first raised.  About the only things that are "certain"
are that it will be called "Traveller: The New Era" (TNE), and that the
basic mechanics will be Twilight:2000 with a d20 instead of a d10.  (So
much for that intersystem compatibility they were hoping for?).  The Star
Viking project (originally a miniatures game for planetary raids based on
Command Decision) will not be issued for Gencon as projected, and it won\'t
be a miniatures game when it does come out.  (Board game?)

Meanwhile, the folio adventure Assignment: Vigilante has been released with
absolutely no fanfare, for the bargain price of $4.50.

I can\'t say much else, since there isn\'t much to say.  I\'ve chided, castigated,
and cajoled GDW about this in private, in public and in person.  I\'ve 
volunteered to edit, to proofread, to playtest and gotten no real response.
I\'ve volunteered the list.  What else can I do?

Just as well--they are the ones responsible for most of the more peculiar
additions and insertions in MT.  However, since they dropped the Traveller
business to pursue their own game, they have been little seen...when was
AI supposed to be out?  Several months ago?  Rumor I heard had it that
40% of the final draft disappeared in a hard disk crash and is being
reconstructed...(The other 60% went too, but was recoverable).

As far as I am concerned, this intention of this rule has always been an
open question.  For starships, should that be 40 + 5*TL?  If not, then a
\'legal\' TL7 spacecraft is impossible.  (Tell the Apollo crew to give it up
boys--we can\'t build the command module thick enough!)

I don\'t.  At least not yet.  Look at it like this.  For smaller weapons
operating over a _short_ turn, a laser does MW damage if pulse, or 2*MW
damage if beam.  A ship sized beam laser should do 500 points of damage in
combat--more if the turn length is considered.  If it doesn\'t, then I\'ll
design my ships with the smaller weapons, nyet?  The principle is good, but
the math is bad.  This reminds me--have we _ever_ come to any agreement on
whether lasers actually shoot at their targets at far orbit range or whether
they just slash around hoping for a random hit?  If the latter, then a low
damage might be justifiable (but it should increase as range decreases, not
from differing beam strength but from increasing time on the target).  If  
the former, then the damage should be larger (or the damage from vehicle
mounted weapons should be smaller.)

Agree with Scott here.  A lot of stuff has been chewed over (and over and over)

True, and to tell you the truth, I don\'t see the real reason for this rule,
I would think you could always slap on thicker armor.  But the rule is on the
books, and it does solve the problem.  However, I would point out that the
Apollo capsule was not as radiation proof or as well armored as I am lead to
believe in the case of traveller starships.

Your right.  I hadn\'t considered that.  But I still like the idea of using
the damage point values.  What we need is to adopt a more mass oriented
system than the volume oriented system.  (ie 1 damage point per 15 tons
rather than per 15 kiloliters or something like that)

A good question.  *I* would assume the slashing movements for the lasers.
It seems to make sence within the confines of the game and as to what is
actually going on.  This would account for the increased probability of
hitting with lasers at closer ranges.

Apparantly there\'s been some mix up with challenge 60.  A lot of people
did not recieve their copies.  (I got 59 and 61 but no 60)

It sounds as though there are 2 more products to be released before Trav NE.
comes out.

An Astrogators guide to Diaspora, and a Survival guide.
the Survival guide is supposed to be a transition guide from MegaTrav to
Trav NE.  Both of these are supposed to be small booklets like Assignment
Vigilante.  ($5?)

The Astrogators guide is (supposed to be) due in September?

The Survival Guide is supposed to be due in October?
	(Don\'t quote me I wasn\'t taking notes)

Traveller The New Era Is supposed to be out in November.

Now, since Loren Wiseman seems to be listening in on us, I would like to
suggest to him that if he is interested in our input to stuff on this he
may find the Archives of the TML helpful.  Otherwise, If you want
me to, I can try and reiterate some of the suggestions that I have made
before.

Then again, I believe a lot of the stuff I\'ve said got sent over to GEnie
last fall.  So you may have already heard the stuff I got to say.

So, Whaddya say GDW?

That way, the entire effort could be on background/etc., rather than on more
rules to wonder at.

Anyone ever consider what kind of effort it would take to make traveller 3D?
I know that 2D is so damn much simpler, but space isn\'t supposed to be simple.
What\'s the excitement of it\'s just a bunch of small islands on a real big 
sea? 
On the same topic, one thing that always bothered me was that population was
random, no matter how bad the conditions on the planet. 99 billion on a 
size A with atmosphere F is kind of hard to believe (much less that many on
size 1, no water, no air)! Why not have modifiers to the population roll based
on the other rolls? Say, something like this:

UCP	Size	Atmos	Water
- ----
0	-2	-3	-2
1	-1	-2	-1
2	-1	-2	-1
3	 0	-1	 0
4	 0	-1	 0
5	 0	 0	 0
6	 0	+1	 0
7	 0	-1	 0
8	 0	 0	 0
9	 0	-1	-1
A	+1	-2	-2
B+		-3

This way, you wouldn\'t have all those poor planets with billions next to 
the perfect one that the GM can name every person on.
Also, TL 9-B should reduce the effects of tainted atmosphere to tolerable
(say, carginogenic, or perhaps a simple lung-wash is needed every month),
C-D should make it nothing but a faint odor, and E+ should eliminate tainting
altogether. Remove the requirement for atmospheric type (make it 0-9) for
industrial worlds.

Anyone want to reinterpret the TLs to make it more sane? I don\'t mean changing
any number, but making Earth 1992, say, 4, and making higher numbers just
more specific high-technology. Ship design is going to be re-done anyway,
and all the high-tech weapons are silly to begin with.

One last thing. Why wouldn\'t the laser be the premiere weapon in `Hard Times\',
that pinnacle of hard science? You don\'t need to re-learn how to make
smokeless powder, no bullets to make or store or run out of, and no recoil.
Maybe an Ancient could explain that 200+ shots really aren\'t necessay, and
build a weapon with a Pen of ~15, 40 shots, and a 1-2 kg internal battery.
I know Traveller has this enormous fear of power (look at fission plants, etc.)
but this just seems (to me) just too logical. Get a rechargeable clip, and
when you run out of ammo, just plug \'er in the fusion plant. No other
energy-transfer technology needed (and lasers are what? TL 8? 7?!?).

This is perhaps a good idea in principle, George, but I think your math is
off.  Drives certianly do not take up their entire listed volume, but 50% is
a bit much to shave off.  I think working space is going to be a more
complicated function than just some percentage number.

Consider:  A huge battleship with a HUGE powerplant.  Does that mean that
50% of that huge volume is work space?

In it\'s simplest execution, imagine:  A spherical fusion plant with a series
of 3 meter cat walks running around it.  (In my opinion, that is about as
large an area as you could concievably use for repair work) Now for small
engines that would be more than 50% but with HUGE engines that would be much
less.  (I don\'t have my calculator here, but you can see how the numbers
would add up anyway)

Yup, supposedly, a Damper can either stabalize or destableize radioactive
nucleii.  So you could use one to clean up after a nuclear blast.

        I\'ve been playing Traveller for about 10 years now, off and on
(mainly off since I can\'t find many players).  I tended to use the
original rules until about 4 months ago when I got Mega-Traveller and
started subscribing to this list.  Here, on these pages (pages??)
I learned about the Hard Times Suppliment and the upcomming TNE.
        One of the subjects that has been continually mentioned in
passing is that they were thinking of introducing a computer virus
as an explanation for the fall of the Imperium.  They, apparently,
decided not to do this to the vast relief of nearly everyone on this
list.
        I\'m just bloody curious.  What were they proposing for this
virus?  How was it supposed to work?  Why was the list so convinced
that the concept wouldn\'t work.
        If this subject has been bashed to death in the past and
no one in their right mind (which leaves me out, of course) cares to
bring it up again, I would LOVE email for the explanation.  I\'m just
bloody curious.
        Thanks in advance, folks!

Just a quick question:
I\'ve been throwing The 4.5th Frontier War out at you, but with a few
exceptions everybody\'s been pretty quiet about it (Hey Edmund! Er.. Michael)

So, does anyone have any comments?  Are you reading it?  Are you bored with
it?  Do you like it?  Any criticism?

Also, I know Grant & Co. is probably being delayed due to thisis madness.
But if memory serves, wasn\'t there someone else out there (a long time ago)
who was posting stories?  (Other than the PBEM)

I believe it was Catie Helm who redirected a message from someone not
directly connected ta the list.  That person offered to send in some stories.
(Sorry, can\'t remember names)  Well, if you got stories, sure!  Send em.  I
have been trying to keep the volume down by posting the whole shebang slowly.
I suggest you do the same.  If I tried to put the whole 4.5th Frontier War,
in, it would flood the list.  As is, I try to send them off over the weekend
or when the TML is running low on traffic.

Also, a note to those who have read the 4.5th Frontier War before.  Guys,
the stuff I\'ve been posting has been re-edited and redone since I sent you
the lot.  Not any real major changes, but you might want to throw out what I
originally sent you as it gets replaced.

Supercilliously yours,

Hydrogen Fuel Leaks:
Now consider:  When we talk about fuel leaks in Trav, we are not talking
about leaking gasoline in air.  We are talking about leaking Liquid
*HYDROGEN* into *VACCUM*.

What is gonna happen?  Well as soon as the pressure in the tank is reduced,
the hydrogen is gonna vaporize.  VOOM!  At that point you\'re gonna loose any
hope of keeping your leak contained.  It\'s worse than opening your airlock
to space.  Everything is going to escape.  No hope of containing it.  I
rather doubt that self sealing stuff would work.  Certainly not at TL 8 or 9.

The way self sealing tanks work today is when a bullet punches a whole in the
tank, there\'s a rubber liner which moves molds itself into the hole and plugs
the leak.  At liquid hydrogen temps, you\'re gonna have trouble finding
*ANYTHING* that is sufficiently plyable to function in this manner.  And
considering the weapons doing the hole punching, that hole is probably gonna
be a bit on the LARGE size.

As Steve pointed out, the fuel tanks are compartmentalized.  Thus when a
fuel hit occurs, we only loose 1% of total fuel.  (or 10 tons which ever
is greater)  This makes sence to me:  Slow leaks do not.

When a leak occurs, it is going to loose fuel all of a sudden, but then it
will stop when that fuel compartment is empty.  But *even* if you use 4
minute combat terms, it\'s gonna be all gone by the end of that turn.

About Armor Maximums:
Yes Steve, they do say max add-on armor is TL*5, but they never define add
on armor.  They have never explained weither we are to add that number to
40 or to 4.  The table seems to indicate that it is added on to 4, but I
could be mistaken.  If it is added on to 4 then the Apollo capsule could
*Almost* make it.  (Armor=39)

If we are to say that max armor is TL*5+40 then a TL 3 ironclad could have
Armor 55?  That doesn\'t sound right to me.

Despite a generally positive response, there are two questions that
keep coming up about the Cramped Engine Spaces.  One is that the
extra crew would have less space to work.  Two is that some people
don\'t think that 50% work space is an accurate figure.

	Responding to the first problem, I would argue that in most
vessels, a crew will be working from 10 to 12 hours on the drives,
at most, except during emergencies.  The rest of the time, they\'re
being left alone.  This is standard practice today with ships at sea;
you do routine maintenance during one "shift" with some overflow,
but leave it alone the rest of the time.
	Since there would be less space to work, with the same number
of people doing say "replacing lateral heat exchanger" the job will take
say one and a half times as long.  Which means that the two assistant
engineers will have two hours less to be calibrating the fuel feed
heater injectors, so you need someone else to handle that.
Not everyone is crawling over the physical drive at the same time.
You\'re just going to be increasing the length of time that the jobs
involving doing so take, thus requiring more people to handle the
other jobs.

	As for the second... 8-)  Look at any of the published deck
plans.  Azhanti High Lightnings have more than 50% empty or access
space in their drive rooms.   So do most (but not all) of the smaller
ships that have appeared in deck plan form.
	Real naval vessels today have between 50% and 80% of their 
drive spaces empty for maintenance and access purposes.  I think that
using the 50% figure is safe.

     Even hydrogen has a heat of vaporization.  If kept cold enough,
it won\'t instantly vaporize, even into vacuum.  And hydrogen CAN be

into vacuum.
     Note also that liquid ammonia stores more Hydrogen per kiloliter
than liquid hydrogen does (120Kg per Kl, as opposed to 70.6 Kg per
Kl).  So warships may (should!) be carrying fuel in the form of
ammonia, and processing it into H2 as needed.  Then the problem tends
to evaporate.

I doubt it, too.  I also suspect that space battles at TL8 and 9 are
pretty silly affairs, at best.

I always assumed 40.  Be that as it may, the Apollo capsule is a silly
example.  The apollo capsule (about two MT tons) did NOT mass 25+ tons
metric.  It also did not have a hull stronger than that on most MBTs. 
Estimated armour value of an Apollo is only 10 (at MOST).

Nor to me.  Though that is only 5 feet of soft steel.  But then I
don\'t believe that maximum armour that can be fabricated is an
exponential function of TL, either.  And +5 per TL is exponential
(effective armour thickness increases by 57.3% per TL.
 
This is but a part of why I said the vehicle design system falls apart
at the limits - TL low vehicles are miracles of capability compared to
the real world, and TL high ones are, well, magic.  Consider that the
maximum armour value at TL15 is 115 (maybe), which translates to about
224 meters of hard steel.  Sure it\'s using bonded superdense, and is
thinner - (from Striker) it\'s actually only 16 meters thick.  A
hundred ton ship would have 100,000+ tons of armour, which SHOULD have
a volume of 6690 Kl, or 495 displacement tons.  Pretty amazing stuff,
eh?

Yes, but in George\'s defense I\'ll point out that the actual "workspace" of
the engineers is not included in the volume of the drive; it is included 
in the volume of the staterooms and other accommodations.  At least that
is how the game is currently rationalized.

OK.  I\'ll keep this very short. (-:  You\'re right.  A damper can clean
radiaoactive messes.  This function is specifically described in the
advanced rules for Striker (Book 2 out of 3), which is unfortunately a
little hard to come by right now.

This, by the way, is another example of a MT problem--the old-timers know
what a damper is and roughly how it works, but it isn\'t described anywhere
in MegaTraveller...lots of Striker stuff in MT without the required
explanations...

I agree with Steve.  Burning off armor is probably not necessary in a game
sense, as long as _some_ hull damage is occuring from what are currently
the "no damage" hits.  Let\'s look at the current vehicle combat rules,
scaled up to starships, for a second.  A 200 ton free/far trader has hull
points of 180/450 under the current rules.  A 250MW beam laser would do
500 points of damage on a "full penetration hit", and 50 points on a
"no penetration hit".  Now recalling that vehicles get their damage 
multiplied by ten, that would be 1800 points to disable the hull.  That\'s
only 36 laser shots--three fire phases from a ship with 4 triple turrets
with beam lasers (which would make a decent system defense boat in this
system...)  As it stands now, the poor SDB probably has all of his turrets
arranged as one factor 5 battery, which will cause weapon-1, maneuver-1 or
fuel-1 three times...  (Critical hits on a 5 battery vs. a 200 ton ship
disregarded.)

I wrote this into a \'minimalist\' vehicle system redesign when we had the 
first TDR flurry.  What was that?  About a year and a half ago?  As far as
I know, Bertil is the only one who took the idea and actually tried it out
in a game, and I seem to recall that he was pleased with it. (-:  If GDW
wants to revised this section of the rules, I\'d be all for it, and I think
that it would be an excellent time to stop and think about what damage 
values for weapons ought to be in relation to the number of damage points
for vehicles.  As it stands now, a typical tank (4 displacement tons)
has a hull value of, um, 4/9, which should be read as 40/90 in "personal"
combat.  A typical TL7 tank gun (say a 10cm high velocity, roughly equal
to a US 105mm) does about 10 points of damage per hit.  Thus, 13 hits
would be required to \'destroy\' the hull.  A single hit from a 50MW beam
laser will do 100.  Any idea what the muzzle energy of a 105 tank gun is?

The worst offenders in this problem are the aircraft.  I\'ve posted previously
my calculations showing that a typical current fighter plane in COACC can
take a couple of dozen hits from anti-aircraft missiles before becoming
unflyable...

We assume so in our games.  Standard Imperial policy after using
nuclear weapons is to clean it up with a damper so the marines can go
in.

I suspect romance could happen, physical liaison probably not.  Wrong
sexual cues form the aliens - they are probably no more sexually
exciting than a tree.  Though I do have a human character who thinks
female Aslan are "intriguing".

I wonder how they EVER figured it out, myself.  They have 421 (or
somewhat fewer) DIFFERENT cultures and technologies.  They don\'t even
use the same kind of screws from site to site.  So how did ANYONE ever
leap to the conclusion that they all belonged to one race?

I assume that the lasers are aimed exactly at close range, and may
hunt a small amount at long range.  Big question is how stable the
firing platform is, and MT seems to assume that the firing platform
has point-defense FC.  If so, it\'s about as stable as it gets, and
lasers should only have to hunt to deal with the uncertainty of the
target\'s position at long range.

BTW, why not use the rated damage from the table in the PLayer Book?  It
covers all shipboard weapons nicely, without having to make up another set
of numbers.

Quite true.  Liquid Ammonia has a greater atomic density of hydrogen than
pure liquid hydrogen.  Maybe the Traveller TNE folks should take note?

Here\'s a question for you...If you carry your fuel as ammonia, what do you do
with the nitrogen after processing?  Vent it to space?  Store it for those
times when you use wilderness refuelling and recombine it with the H2 so you
can store it as ammonia again?

If you vent it, would it be possible to detect a ship by the cloud of nitrogen
it leaves behind it?  Or would it be a trail of N?  Would it leave enough N
to detect, perhaps by the wavelengths of light it absorbs from the local sun?
How much N would be contained in a tankful of ammonia?

But strangely enough there are Traveller planets that are radioactive.
Of course a half-way radioactive planet IS a dramatic locale for an
adventure. That\'s what I meant in a previous posting about situational
physics. When it\'s convenient you can and when it\'s convenient you can\'t.

One thing occurs to me, however. Nuclear dampers work by focussing a
\'node\' of a field on the material to be treated. That\'s why no nuclear
screens. Have anyone ever computed the amount of topsoil usually made
radioactive by a nuclear bombardment? How big is a damper node? (The
range of the field is a multiple of the distance between the two field
generators, but I don\'t think the size of the node is defined anywhere).
So how long would it take to focus a node on every cubic meter of the
affected area? How long do you have to keep it focussed? Perhaps cleaning
up a radioactive planet is not quite so easy as running a vaccuum cleaner
over a carpet.

Given that human beings have been known to consort with goats, and that
the prime sexual organ is the brain, I don\'t think we can rule out any-

421 huh? You know, that is just one of the glaring holes in the whole
Grandfather story. "He kept careful count of his descendants and made
sure he killed them all". Yeah, sure. But what about the children that
they had unknown to him? Say during the second millenium of the war when
those surviving must\'ve begun to suspect what he was up to, and in any
case needed allies. Not to mention all the programmed clones they must\'ve
made to decoy Grandfather into killing a clone instead of the real thing.
Phoey!

    'body' => 'George Herbert wrote a pretty good summary of the current state of US
law concerning Weapons of Mass Destruction, but I\'d like to clarify a
few of his points.

To buy and sell anti-tank guns, rocket launchers, etc., a person needs
a Federal Firearms License.  A Class III FFL allows one to deal in
full auto firearms and a few other controlled devices.  A Class II FFL,
I believe, is what George is referring to when he spoke of being registered
as an "Arms Dealer".  However, a FFL is not required to own controlled weapons,
only to sell them.  There is some licensing and paperwork involved to
buy a controlled device, but you don\'t have to be a registered dealer.  A
friend of mine buys C4 plastic explosives and shaped charges for his
business, a oil well perforation service.  He has to fill out a ton of
papers, but he doesn\'t need an FFL to buy.

Tanks and aircraft designed to carry weapons are not classed as weapons
in themselves.  Anyone can buy an M3 Stuart tank or a P-51 Mustang, sans
weapons, no problem.  What you have to do to disable the weapon carrying
capability depends on the BATF\'s whim.  I knew a group of WWII reenactors
in Oklahoma City who bought a Wehrmacht surplus Hetzer tank destroyer
from a museum in Switzerland in 1981.  To legally import into the
country, they had to have the breech block of the cannon cut in half
to disable it.  They had this pretty carefully done in Europe, then shipped
it to all to Oklahoma, where they applied for a manufacture permit to
enable the cannon.  Once they had the permit from the BATF, they had
the breech welded back together and they had a fully functional light
tank destroyer to play with.  Finding cannon shells to fire was a 
problem, though.

What\'s happening today is that the BATF is making up its own rules as it
goes along.  If the BATF doesn\'t want to allow something, they simply
restrict it, regardless of whether or not they have a legal basis to do
so.  For instance, there is an Executive order banning the import of
a list of specific weapons into the US.  The BATF has taken it upon itself
to expand that list to include weapons are not restricted by the order.
One dealer I\'ve read of got clearance from the BATF to import a number
of rifles, got them as far as a US Customs warehouse, then found that
the BATF had changed its mind.  The rifles are sitting in the warehouse,
they are legal to import, but the BATF says no, we won\'t let you bring
them in.  Sue us.

It\'s the same thing with the Soviet aircraft.  There are no real legal
restrictions on the aircraft or their systems, but the BATF is simply
overreaching its authority in what it can control.

To Byran Borich: hello.  With regards to "racoonids" I am not the
author of them - one of the people in my weekly traveller game
invented them several years ago, and we\'ve been playing with them ever
since.  We have a write-up which we were thinking of sending to
Challenge, but since we had character generation rules based on MT, we
decided to drag our feet and see what sorts of new character
generation rules we would get with TNE. (Now that Imperiallines is
coming out, we may send it there instead - we haven\'t decided.) I will
upload the basic write-up to this list over the week-end, but folks,
we really would like to get some comments back please.  We\'ve tried
very hard in our traveller game not to make them funny little people
in fuzzy suits, but rather real aliens.

About the "space opera" character of the name "Racoonid": that the
name was like-unto-space-opera had never crossed our minds.  It
sounded like as good a name as any, and it _is_ desciptive.
Alternatively, have you ever stopped to think just how space-operish
"Aslani" is?!?  ;->

Without a good representation the players only get confused and
discouraged by trying to visualize the 3-D map. If you had a computer
or a 3-D model of the universe then this could be quite practical.
Otherwise most players can\'t tell what planets are close to their current
postion, and almost none could plot a shortest route course though the 3-D
universe.

Just think of analogies on earth, why is japan so overcrowded while 
Austrailia which is relatively close is almost empty? Usually there
are socio-economic resaons why you see strange population figures, and
what we need is a program/method to come up with novel reasons why
there is a disparagy.

I agree totally with this, as someone else pointed out (Scott? Metlay? Steve?)
the fossel fuel burning is well past at high tech levels. Perhaps the

	Actually Lesley\'s ability to write fiction increases as parts of the
thesis become iminent :-). Displacement activity I suppose :-).
	I had posted "Getting Out of the Doledrums" some time ago. It is the
most relevant (and suitably short) of what I have. I have a fair amount of
stuff written but most of it deals with the pre-history of my campaign which
means it is about as relevant to standard traveller as the Similrilion is to
the Hobbit. There is other stuff which isn\'t as specific which uses a
Traveller like universe as a setting (there is one grim one I like about a
ship trapped while refueling in a gas giant by a fault in their static 
discharge probe).
	Alternatively there is this competition we wrote back in \'89. It was
100 pages long and we playtested it 11 times. We still can\'t get it out of
our heads! It occurs to me that a story, following the most amusing turns
of the playtesting and competition would make a humorious serial.

	So people, do you want fiction on the TML?

	Send me e-mail indicating "Yea" or "Nay" and, perhaps, the maximum
number of lines per bi-weekly mailing you would be willing to tolerate :-).
If I get sufficiently more Yeas than Nays I\'ll give it a test run. I\'ll talk
to James about shifting them down to the bottom of the mailing.

Yea. the TML moderator suggests one or two 20kB installments each week
- -- I have traditionally treated multi-part fiction like a story column
in a magazine. Messages over 6kB in size are automatically sorted by the
digester to the end of the digest (unless it appears to be a ship design
- - ship designs are treated as the very lowest form of life and are
always sorted as close to the absolute end of the digest as possible).

Your experience obviously doesn\'t include removal of a motor-generator 5m
long from it\'s position in an engine room, and transport from there to a 
repair shop.  It takes more than 3m of space to do a lot of work.

George, in the boats we did maintenance 24 hours a day.  One watch on,
one watch maintenance, one watch asleep.  From the time the boat left
port till after it returned.

Are we eroding away the cabin space again?  If you assume work space is
part of the accomodations, you have work space amounting to less than 2%
of the machinery space.  You won\'t get much work done like that.

In the range of 5,000,000 to 8,000,000 joules, I believe.  Depends on

Scott, we can already make "slush hydrogen".  We expect to be able to make
it with 50% solid hydrogen in a few more years.  It\'s not THAT big a deal
to get the temperature down that far.

True.  Unless H2 is a really good heat conductor, it won\'t make much
difference to most of the contents of the tank, unless it\'s a small tnak.

Well, the obvious thing is to vent it with the waste hydrogen (you\'re only
fusing about four atoms per 7000 present).
Or there\'s my new alternative (to keep Cynthia on her toes, and annoy 
purists):  Since most of the hydrogen used is actually used as a coolant,
let\'s use the nitrogen waste as coolant, too.  You have to redesign the
heat exchangers, but that\'s not a big deal even now.  Assuming nitrogen 
makes about half as good a coolant as Hydrogen (and there really isn\'t a
good reason why it should be worse at all), then you can run your ship on
twice the MASS of fuel, which takes up about 23% of the VOLUME.  Then 
design a ship that can do 6G, agility-6, and 4 jump-6 without refueling.
(I\'m going to call her "Vanguard").

100,000 Kl of ammonia has about 53,364,000 Kg of Nitrogen.  A 100GW plant 
should emit about 4Kg per second.  How detectable that is I have no idea
at all.

A half-way radioactive planet is also just about impossible.  And

A good battlefield damper can totally inert the radioactives in 288
nuclear shells in 15 seconds.  It can also clear the induced radioactivity
from an area of 78 hectares in the same time.

Humans I wasn\'t concerned with.  How do the ALIENS feel about it?  If 
they don\'t have the same kind of sexuality cycle we do, why should they
consider us attractive?  Admittedly Vargr should have similar sexual cues
to humans, and they might have been rebuilt with a year-round fertility

[]On the same topic, one thing that always bothered me was that population was
[]random, no matter how bad the conditions on the planet. 99 billion on a 
[]size A with atmosphere F is kind of hard to believe (much less that many on
[]size 1, no water, no air)! Why not have modifiers to the population roll based
[]on the other rolls? Say, something like this:

 ---- Chart deleted ----

I would also suggest some sort of population/area vs. tech limit.  We have
5+ billion on "one earth area" at TL8 and we are starting to hit the edge
of the envelope...I don\'t think it would be possible to sustain that many
people with victorian era (TL4.5) technology, much less with TL1 (possible
due to the +1 mod for pop 9).  I think we\'d be lucky to stuff 5 million cavemen
on earth at TL0.  I am re-starting a Trav campaign, and as such have written 
an "update" program that I can plug in a spinward marches UPP and have it spit
out my persoanl alterations. 

[]Also, TL 9-B should reduce the effects of tainted atmosphere to tolerable
[](say, carginogenic, or perhaps a simple lung-wash is needed every month),
[]C-D should make it nothing but a faint odor, and E+ should eliminate tainting
[]altogether. Remove the requirement for atmospheric type (make it 0-9) for
[]industrial worlds.

But the tainting should still reduce the population a tad...

[]Anyone want to reinterpret the TLs to make it more sane? I don\'t mean changing
[]any number, but making Earth 1992, say, 4, and making higher numbers just
[]more specific high-technology. Ship design is going to be re-done anyway,
[]and all the high-tech weapons are silly to begin with.

Scott "2G" Kellogg sez...

[]Yeah...  I\'m not sure what to use really.  It seems to me that you should
[]be able to just slap thicker armor on there if the design will still float.
[]I dunno what to say.  Max armor *I* know of at TL 6 was around 18 inches of
[]steel in the torpedo belts of battleships.  I think that qualifies as
[]armor 46 (?)  Not Armor=70!

This is probably the big bugaboo about armor maximums -- limit the thickness,

threads that have gone through the TML before I lose regular net access

NUCLEAR DAMPERS: 

    I once had a campaign in which we used nuclear dampers to clean up
areas which had been rendered radioactive by bombardment.  Remember the
old adventure _Leviathan_?  The character who played the captain of the
ship dicovered 0409 Egyrn, the T-norm world that had killed itself in
a nuclear war.  Due to other events in the campaign, around the time of
the 5FW he was awarded a barony over the world with instructions to 
eventually bring it, and hopefully the area, under Imperial rule.  This
may seem an incredible reward, but he was given relatively limited
resources, considering that he was very near the Zhodani colony at
Pa\'an/Egyrn....
    It was a lot of fun.  Ruined cities, colonization of the world, 
Zhodani intrigue and outright warfare when both sides dared, and the
possibility that not *all* the original alien inhabitants died made for
aa complicated background.  
    What does this have to do with dampers?  One of the projects he
assigned the Imperial Corps of Engineers involved cleaning up the
contaminated areas so that survey teams and colonists could enter the
area.  He mounted expensive nuclear dampers on armored gravitic vehicles,
and they slowly would treat an area in order to remove the dangerous
contamination. It took a long time to clear even a small area -- first
the area was damped as if the vehicles were plowing it, and then teams
had to go in and make sure nothing was missed, and he was continually
trying to work out something to do with the residual material left
behind in the soil -- lead.  Besides this, he only had so many decontam
vehicles and teams to spare, and not a few hostile neighbors in the
subsector to keep them occupied with other things.  He only could take
the time to clean up the areas he wanted to concentrate on or investigate.
Sometimes, an area would be finished and a storm of rain or dust would
come through, recontaminating everything.


ALIEN ROMANCE:

    I noticed in S&A that the Aslan seem to consider such liaisons *very*
dishonorable.  The fact that they consider them at all probably means that
there are some of the Ftierle who do engage in what most of their folk
would normally consider perverted....


TNE and the VIRUS FROM HELL:

    I\'d like to second Metlay\'s comments.  I could put up with minor
typos in the rules when Traveller was going strong.  But then GDW 
decided that publishing more rule books would be more profitable than
supporting their games with supplements and adventures.  In the last
five years, the only adventure I can think of that they\'ve published
was Knightfall, which missed out on the opportunity to develop the
Rebellion in favor of doing a more balanced "Secret of the Ancients"
adventure, complete with typos.  
    Now I hear that another set of rule books are planned, and that
the current setting will get axed, without any further development.
Furthermore, an unlikely plot device is suggested in place of an
obvious and more reasonable one -- a space virus instead of the gradual
collapse of the Empire.  A sourcebook is planned -- for fall release.
Fall, eh?  Makes me wonder sometimes how serious GDW actually is about
this talk of "increased support".  I\'ve played this game for a long
time, but I doubt that I\'ll be buying another new rule set quickly.

    Incidentally, does anyone know how close DGP and GDW were in
contact on the design of S&A?  It seems to me that they\'re trying to
set up an internal civil war for the Aslan as well, with the little
comments about Yerlyariwo/Khaukeairl dishonor and reckless young clans.
I can just see them setting this war off when they activate the idiotic
space computer virus just to keep them from taking the Daibei area
away.  Knock out two of the most important governments in Known Space
to slow things down?  Any comments or thoughts?

  About 4 of the 5 billions live under sub-TL8 conditions, and judging from
the rate of population increase they haven\'t hit the "edge of the envelope"
yet.

  Yes, look at the Solomani, the Zhodani and at Brzk&Co. The Solomani have
begun quarreling on "what is a Solomani" because it is hard to define a
Solomani logically, and in the process removing the Solimani as a threat 
against a core-dumped Imperium. But this is on the edge of belivability, 
because I\'ve never met a racist who cared one whit for logic.

  And there have been mumblings about something strange goings on in the
Consulate, possibly a civil war, judging from TNS reports.

  And then there is Brzks lessened aspirations towards the Imperium, and
the Vilani appeasement of the Vargr.

  It sure looks like the enemies of the imperium are neutralized one by
one...

     ...hmmm.  I don\'t call that a "glaring hole", I call it a "plot 
hook".  So Grandfather kept careful count and killed them all?  BWAH-HA-HA!
     And then of course, we have plot hook #2: Once somebody decided 
that all 421+ sites actually belonged to the same culture, every 
technological ruin that either dates between 500,000 - 300,000 years ago or
is undatable has been lumped into the "Ancients (Droyne)" category by
Imperial archaeologists.  <snicker, snicker!>  Older ruins are either mis-
dated or ignored, because "the only starfaring culture predating the 
Vilani is the Ancients, so this MUST be an Ancient site..."  (Except of
course for the hypothetical Primoridials, which are only known from a site
that NO ONE has found and entered, so how are they known??)
     I can only guess that the Imperium is using the worst of Vilani
and Solomani archaeological traditions...

    'body' => 'About Megacorporations...
     One of my "suspension of disbelief" crashers in MegaTraveller
has been the concept that so little progress has been made in 3500 years.
(I can excuse the Vilani for not progressing much in 10,000 years; their
culture has been carefully defined as terminally stagnant.)  I can only 
push the belief in "Vilani-influenced research traditions" so far... that
doesn\'t explain why the Solomani Rim isn\'t TL20+ after 3500 years of
uninterrupted progress.  (Go read the fine print about the Long Night;
the Old Earth Union was a "Safe Area" (HT definition) that wasn\'t affected
by the general economic and TL collapse...).  
     HOWEVER, something I just read provides a clue to 1100 years of
slow progress by the 3rd Imperium... and might explain the similar lack of 
progress by the Solomani -- assuming they emphasize megacorporations to
the same extent as the Imperium!  (We all know that the 3rd Imperium
coddles the megacorps at everyone else\'s expense...)  From DDJ June\'92,
p.55:
     (discussing "cottage industry"-level innovators vs. large 
companies) "... There\'s a self-limiting factor in that these 
megacorporations quickly drive out the people who created the product.  
[Several noted organizations] for example are slowly self-destructing
internally by driving out people who will not work in environments where
there are ten levels of managers above one."
     (same article, later on) "...there are some developments that are
amenable to the anthill approach, and some that are not.  There are 
achievements that come about as a result of a breathtaking insight that
only comes from an individual..."
     
     Emphasis being that breakthroughs are made by innovative 
individuals, who rarely thrive in the megacorporate environment, but that
steady, evolutionary improvement is done quite well by large corporations.
Applying real world principles to the 3rd Imperium, where megacorporations
dominate business in the civilized Imperium, and have dominated it since
the rise of the Sylean Federation, I suggest the following: 
     Megacorporations almost never make breakthroughs.  Breakthroughs are
made
by individuals in academic or very-small scale businesses.  Megacorps
buy out breakthrough businesses, and then monopolize the techonological
breakthrough.  They make incremental improvements to the breakthru tech,
but don\'t come up with innovative applications for the breakthru 
technology.  In places where the megacorp\'s regional managers have a
policy of squeezing small, locally competive businesses out of existance,
there are no breakthroughs for the big guys to parasitize.  In places 
where the megacorps have a policy of buying out innovators for cheap and 
then selling the innovation for zillions of credits, would-be innovators
of that generation get the attitude, "why bother going to all that work 
when someone is going to buy me out for small change?"  Alternatively,
if a megacorp buys an innovator out for a good price, he/she/it may be
willing to work on more innovations, but may find that his main client,
the megacorp, has its own ideas on what he should work on, or what specs
his next project must meet for them to finance him, etc, etc... 
Finally, the innovator can start his own company, either failing (a good
discouragement to other would-be innovators), or succeeding beyond his
wildest dreams, raking in gobs of money and becoming... a megacorp!  This,
BTW, seems to be the genesis of several non-Vilani megacorps...
     So, as long as the Imperium encourages the megacorps at the 
expense of the small or individually-held business, technological progress
will be SL-O-O-O-W.  However, items of the mainstream tech level should
be well-designed and have lots of consumer-oriented features.  They should
be relatively standardized within a megacorp\'s product line.  Where 
there is competition between megacorps, prices should be reasonable,
and products *might* be standardized across megacorp lines.  Where there
is NOT competition, prices will be "what the market will bear" or as 
limited by law.  
     Alert readers will have thought of the obvious corollary: when
or where megacorp dominance fails, technological innovation should 
increase -- but uniformity of technology may vary wildly.  This suggests
that (a) areas bordering/beyond the Imperium NOT dominated by megacorps
and not so chaotic that would-be innovators are too busy trying to survive,
should be technologically advanced/advancing.  E.g., stable Vargr worlds,
the Darrians, some select worlds.  (Notice TL16 Kudzu [sic] in Gvurrdon).
And, (b) come Hard Times and the retreat of the Megacorps, worlds NOT 
clobbered by HT should start picking up the pace of advancement... 
resulting NOT in the desired mix of TL9-12 worlds, but a wild mix of
TL0-3 and TL15+ worlds in the long run...
 
     So what was my point in all this?  Oh, yes.  It was that the 
Megacorporate structure of business in the 3rd Imperium can account for
1100 years of glacially slow progress quite nicely.  Now, can someone
explain why 1800 years of Long Night did not produce "a wild mix of
TL0-3 and TL15+ worlds", and why Hard Times should not??
 
     (Arguments of "that\'s not in the spirit of classic Traveller" or
"it didn\'t because GDW says it didn\'t" are disallowed -- I want an 
explanation that makes sense WITHIN the context of the 3rd Imperium 
universe.)

You can make Traveller 3D without too much trouble. I once made a 3D map
of a subsector by blowing up the standard format subsector map to double
size and assuming a depth of nine parsec (from +4 to -4). I used a chance
of 2/6th for a star to be in a cylinder (hex cylinder; does such a
figure have a special name?), so I needed the increased size of hex, as
I got 3 stars in each hex on the average. I then coloured each star
according to depth; I used the seven colours of rainbow plus brown and
white: red, brown, orange, yellow, white (that\'s level 0), green, light
blue, dark blue and violet. That helps me visualize it: the warmer the
colour, the \'closer\' the star is to the viewer. Alternatively there\'s
plenty of room to put a small number next to each star to indicate depth.

What there isn\'t room for is all the other information that\'s usually
found on a Traveller map; you\'ll be hard pressed to get the starnames
fitted in; perhaps blowing the map up once more, glueing typed names
on and reducing it to A4 size again would work.

What you can\'t do is to make the _Imperium_ 3D, at least not easily. Just
imagine the number of new stars you\'d have to generate. A 3D sector
would, I suppose, be 4x4x4 subsectors (I guess I\'d introduce an inter-
mediate level of organization, 8 2x2x2 quadrants to a sector). I don\'t
know how many sectors deep the galaxy would be, but even if it were only
one, we\'re looking at a 36-doubling of the star list.

No, I for one is satisfied to stay with Traveller\'s flat galaxy, although
I\'d propably make any new universe I started myself 3D. I\'d just use a
correspondingly lesser part of the galaxy.

Yes, of course you can have special circumstances (and pretty fun they
are to explain, too), but that T-norm planets have the same AVERAGE
population as worlds with insiduous atmospheres is just plain stupid.

Where do you get these numbers from? And how can I invalidate them? I want

If you want to define aliens as unable to take an interest in anything
that dosen\'t give off the right cues, go right ahead. But the aliens
we\'re talking about are all intelligent. I\'m not going to stretch my
neck out and claim that the ability to fool oneself and one\'s glands is
an inevetable result of intelligence, but I will claim that there\'s no
reason to think that humans would be unique in this department. And as
far as Aslans are concerned, Steven Bonneville points out something that
I think is a heavy indication that they at least can fool themselves:

To answer Dave\'s question concisely: Hard Times is a Traveller
book designed to sketch out, in a general way, the collapse of
the Third Imperium in the years following the Rebellion\'s main
armed movements. It\'s not bad, and if taken to extremes could have
created an environment similar to the one GDW is proposing for
the new rules system (TNE, "Traveller: The New Era") to be released
this fall, without having to postulate a supercomputervirus that
selectively destroys some things and not others all over the IMperium.

Pfagh! Speak no more to me on this, thou worthy. It likes me not.

BTW, the Grant stories Parts 1 through 7 are mine, based on the odd
misadventures of Captain Khagariilian Grant and the crew of the IMSS
Serendipity (*CRASH*) uh, IMSS Inexplicable (*KA-WHOOMF*) er, IMSS
Torch, as they get themselves into and out of all sorts of trouble
while trying to earn an honest buck on the Solomani Rim. Parts 8 and
beyond require more time than I have right now to do, but I hope to at
least get them out of their current Adventure on Terra before drawing
the series to a close. The metaplot after the Terra incident,
involving the tradewar that destroyed Grant\'s old company, isn\'t
suitable for a writeup here, and the game was put on hiatus at the end
of that plotline so I could write my thesis. However, we plan to
resume play this summer after I\'m done, which will provide more grist
for the mill. I will repost Parts 1 through 7 to refresh people\'s
memories before posting any new material. How much I post at a time
will probably be regulated by James. (Hi James. And thanks for the
anniversary card. Hugs from Suzanne and me to Glennis and you for YOUR
next anniversary. |-> )

     Shtam hung on to the turret pylon.  The force of centripetal
acceleration here was almost negligeable.  The problem lay not in
what forces one felt, but in what one saw.  The universe spun
around his head.  The large, blue green gas giant took up half
the sky.  This might not be so bad if only it would make up it\'s
mind which side of the sky to stay on.  Slowly it rolled around
them like a huge drunken shark circling its prey.
     As a boy, he had sometimes lain on his back looking at the
ceiling and imagining it was the floor.  After a little while the
sensation seemed quite real, and disorienting.  Now, he realized
it was true.  Up was down, and down was running in circles all
around him.  He closed his eyes for a moment, focused them on the
pylon and descended.
     "Falling!" he shouted instinctively.  The universe was
spinning around his head with no particular orientation.  He
struggled with the tether as he slipped, grabbing it behind him
with his brake hand.  The rope yanked.  No more falling, but he
was drifting seven meters from the pylon.
     He steadied for a moment and then pulled up the rope.  With
only a small centripetal vector holding him, he shot toward the
ship quickly.
     "You all right?" asked Vole the brakeman.
     "I am fine." he sighed.  "I just became momentarily
disoriented, thank you."  He took a deep breath, and sighed.  He
positioned himself again.  "Ok, Climbing!"
     Breaking in a new leg may be more difficult than I thought.
The toe nails are almost complete but what about the reflexes?
     Down he went again, working his way to the inspection hatch.
Grip, slide, slide, grip; grip, slide, slide, grip.  That\'s
right, Shtam, now concentrate on the climbing not the scenery.
     Weight began to hang itself on his shoulders.  Eleven meters
per second squared acceleration was heavy to a slim, tall zhodani
who evolved in the eight point nine of zhdant.
     The inspection hatch had a mismatched paint job that was a
peeling and cracked blue against the faded green turret.  Weld
marks ran over the turret like a spider web stitching it back
together.  Under the sensors of Shtam\'s battle dress the metal
fatigue of some sort of past hit was evident.  One quarter of the
turret had been blasted away by some attacker, and welded back
together with sections of other turrets.
     Boy, somebody really put this one together from junk yard
pieces.
     The inspection hatch was jammed shut.  Something of a bad
fit in the reassembly.  Just needs a bit of filing to get it to
open.  The battledress servoes whined a moment, then the metal
rang through his fingertips as the hatch opened.
     "I have opened it.  You can start down now." Shtam radioed.
He worked into the dark turret.  His helmet lights picked out an
empty chair, all the indicators were dark, but missiles were
clearly in the tubes.  Automated missile lifts had several
missiles standing by to be loaded into the tubes rapidly.  The
hatch into the turret was open.  The panels were an electricians
nightmare.  Wiring running out everywhere, switches jury rigged,
parts replaced with panels that had no right to be in a turret.
The loading tube control was stolen from an Air/Raft cruise
control.  "There is quite a mess in here, folks.  Not much outlay
for maintenance on this Vixen."
     "There usually isn\'t." replied Gresha.
     Shtam concentrated for a moment.  The ship still was
completely dark save the light coming from the open hatchway.
Then he secured his tether.
     A few minutes later, Gresha poked her helmet in the hatch.
"Looks like they cannibalized this whole ship."
     Soon Miakr and Vole had joined them in the shaft leading to
the rest of the ship.
     Shtam drew his gauss pistol.  "We\'ll head for the bridge."
     "It\'ll be on deck two, right below the missile bay."
volunteered Gresha.
     The shaft was black and silent as Gresha lead the way with
her gauss rifle pointed purposefully.  The small force of the
centripetal acceleration died away as they climbed away from the
turret into zero gravity.
     The shaft opened into a magazine filled with missiles.  "The
black tipped ones," began Gresha,  "I read them as radioactive."
     Miakr whistled, "Viepchakl, there\'s a lot of them."
     "The bridge should be two decks up." said Shtam impatiently.
     The overhead hatch was open, showing a black pit beyond the
light.  "Welcome to my parlor..." mumbled Miakr.
     The light peered up to the next deck.  Beyond the decking
the hatch to the bridge was closed.  Shtam went up first.  He
quickly looked around.  The main airlock for the ship was closed
off.  Nearby, the ships locker lay opened and empty.  "All
clear."
     The others followed.
     Shtam glanced over the airlock.  "The lock is pressurized.
     Miakr examined the bridge hatch.  "I think the bridge is
too."
     "Curiouser, and curiouser." mumbled Vole.
     "Well, we can open them but it will mean losing the
integrity." considered Shtam.  "If we seal this deck first we
won\'t lose the gas that is trapped."
     "Is that important?" asked Miakr.
     "In an investigation of a derelict almost everything is
important." retorted Shtam.
     "Ok." Vole closed and dogged the lower hatch.  "I get you."
     "All right," began Shtam, "first we should open the bridge
compartment.  The reduction in pressure will be less that way,
because of the comparative volumes of the bridge and airlock."
     "Just be careful." warned Gresha.  "Watch for traps."
     Shtam examined the hatchway.  No obvious trigger mechanisms,
no electromagnetic signals from it, no tell tale radiative heat.
Nothing.  "Vole, do your eyes make out anything on this hatch you
feel we ought to know about?"
     "Nothing I can see."
     "All right," Shtam cautioned.  "I am going to release the
manual air valve to equalize the pressure.  Vole, be ready with
your nose to analyze the gas... Now..."
     Gas streamed in unseen.  The tiny pressure registered in
Vole\'s olfactory sensors.  "Ten to the minus five torr and
rising.  Gas composition seventy nine percent nitrogen, fifteen
percent oxygen, five percent carbon dioxide, point seven percent
hydrogen oxide, point two percent carbon monoxide, point one
percent hydrogen, traces of oil helium, argon, neon.  Conclusion:
at sufficient pressure, unbreatheable by human or vargr.  Ten to
the minus two torr and rising...  Ten to the minus one torr and
rising..."
     "Unbreathable?" asked Gresha.
     "Not enough oxygen, not enough water, too much carbon
dioxide." explained Miakr.
     Vole continued counting to five hundred torr and then
announce that pressure had stableized.
     "Now, shall we see what we have got here?" Shtam opened the
hatch.  His head lamp swept into the blackness.  Quickly he
climbed the ladder and was through the hatch.
     The bridge was a mess.  Paper scattered and floating around
the room in micro gravity.  A few bags scattered here and there.
At the main command chair was a single human figure.
     It was dressed in a vacc suit, a sub machine gun strapped
around its shoulder.  It sat facing the empty video screens and
holo tanks which stared back like sightless eyes.  Shtam floated
over to the figure.
     A human woman.  She lay stretched out in the acceleration
couch.  Shtam turned the his head lamp onto the face.  The face
contorted and black.  Eyes bulged out.  The blackened lips parted
screaming for a last breath.
     Vole began opening the vacc suit seals.  and took a sniff as
the gas escaped.  "Oxygen starvation."
     "Everything points to it." admitted Shtam.  "She must have
run out of fuel and gone through the last of the bottled air."
     "If this ship only ran out of fuel," began Gresha, "Then we
can refuel it..."
     "We have a nice little warship indeed." whistled Shtam.
     - XXV -
     Miakr opened the airlock.
     He jumped back.  His head lamps caught a drifting figure\'s
face as it moved out of the airlock.  Staring eyes, a muzzle with
lips curled back in hate showing razor teeth.
     He yelled and swung instinctively.  Battle dress swatted
away the fearsome apparition like a fly.  Miakr looked on as the
vargr tumbled across the room stiff as a board and bounced
against the far bulkhead.
     "Dead?" he asked.
     Vole caught the corpse from its gyrations.  "Very dead.  But
this one didn\'t die from oxygen starvation."
     "What do you mean?" asked Gresha.
     Vole turned the corpse around to face them:  a female.  Two
holes were torn in the body.  "Looks like nine millimeter
bullets.  Now we know why the one on the bridge had an SMG."
     "She\'s wearing a corsair uniform." Gresha pointed out.
     "What band?" asked Shtam.
     "Looks like the Uekalez.  Hard to say though."
     "What do you know about them?"
     "Tough group.  Strong in space.  This Vixen must\'ve been
theirs.  Had a good fleet \'til recently." she said remembering.
     "What happened to them?" asked Shtam.
     Gresha shook her head.  "The usual I think:  internal splits,
competition moving in.  Happened about three months ago.  I don\'t
know."
     "Interesting." commented Vole.  "I estimate the time of
death of this vargr at approximately three and one half months
ago."
     - XXV -
     Ten robots stood motionless in the engine room.
     "They\'re out of fuel." noted Miakr.  "Probably drained to
keep the life support going."
     "Agreed." nodded Shtam.  "Vole, how much fuel do you have at
the moment?"
     "Thirty three point six liters."
     "Well, it will have to do."
     "What do you mean Shtam?" asked Miakr hesitantly.
     "To get control of this ship we will need to use Vole\'s fuel
to power up the engines." Shtam explained.
     "What?" shouted Miakr.
     "We have to stop the ship\'s spin before we can refuel it.
To do that we will use Vole\'s fuel.  He does not carry much, but
it ought to be enough to stop the rotation."
     "He won\'t have enough to operate!" shouted Miakr eyes wide.
     Gresha stared, "Miakr?"
     "What\'s the matter?" wondered Shtam, "It will not damage
him."
     Miakr glared "He\'ll be out of power."
     "So?" asked Gresha.
     "He can\'t operate.  I won\'t allow it."
     "Miakr," began Shtam calmly, "Vole will only be powered down
for a little while, an hour at most."
     Miakr only glared.
     "It sound\'s like a sensible plan." broke in Vole, "But, may
I suggest that I be left with point two liters of fuel?" I can
operate for one hour on that amount."
     Miakr eased.
     - XXVI -
     Miakr glanced at the gauges nervously.  "Fuel temperature
rising... Approaching ignition temperature:  thirty seconds."
     Shtam looked over the main engine christmas tree.  "Gresha,
we will have power in twenty four seconds.  Stand by to activate
emergency de-spin.  Flamboyant stand by for fuel transfer."
     Gresha\'s radio sounded from the bridge.  "Standing by."
     Niedrsha in the Flamboyant called, "We\'re in position."
     Miakr shot a glance across his shoulder, "Vole, how is your
fuel holding out?"
     "I will be forced to shut down in two minutes seventeen
seconds."
     "Vole," wondered Shtam, "can\'t you conserve fuel?"
     "No, he can\'t." snapped Miakr.  "His fuel cell has only so
much variability.  He\'s set on lowest power output right now."
     Shtam ignored the curt reply.  "Here it comes.  Four seconds
to ignition."
     The plasma became more and more violent in its slam dancing
ultra violet display.  Suddenly, under the wing of a gaussian,
two deuterium atoms collided with unusual force.  Two individual
nucleii suddenly met.  After billions of years of solitude, the 
protons embraced, and clung to each other with tremendous force,
heat and desire and became one for all eternity.  Love is found
everywhere in nature.
     "We have fusion ignition!" called Shtam, "Activating bridge
controls."
     "She\'s alive!" shouted Gresha.
     The ship jerked under their feet as the emergency de-spin
system fought the torque of the Vixen.  They held on as the ship
suddenly moved without them.  Vole, with nearly no power to stop
himself, drifted up to the center of the engine room.
     The maneuver jets ate the Vixen\'s spin.  She slowed and
stopped her slow pirouette.
     "Flamboyant, commence docking and fuel transfer." smiled
Shtam.
     "Quick, Shtam!" shouted Miakr urgently, "Can I bleed off
another point two liters for Vole?"
     - XXVII -
     Hours later, the boarding party was aboard the Flamboyant.
     "Well, how are the engines of that thing, Shtam?" asked
Niedrsha.  "Looks like she\'s pretty beat up."
     Shtam set his air tanks to recharge.  "Well, actually, the
Vixen is in fairly good condition considering what it must have
been through.  Those ships are built to only be used once.  When
they fire the main missile bay it shakes the ship apart.  She may
have been used a few times."
     Shtam stretched and continued.  "She appears to have
recently undergone a major overhaul.  The equipment appears to
have been stripped from other Vixens to make one working one out
of several damaged ones."
     "It\'s been cannibalized." nodded Jietlshaiepr.
     "Precisely.  It\'s been without power now for some time.  The
engines need to be thoroughly checked before she can make jump."
     Niedrsha shook his head.  "Too fuckin\' bad.  We don\'t have
the time.  We got to get after the doc."
     "However," continued Shtam, "if we leave someone here to go
over the ship, and get her going again.  We will have a nice
little warship with the armament of a light cruiser to bargain
with.  It would take a thirteen hundred ton ship to carry the
same armament as this one."
     "And, it carries nukes." nodded Niedrsha.  "Who\'s staying?"
     Shtam raised an eyebrow.  "Miakr has already volunteered.
He, Vole and Gresha will stay behind."
     Jietlshaiepr\'s brows knit, "How will they survive?  The
original crew died."
     "We will have to take the Vixen to Aramat\'s orbit.  There, we
can pick up oxygen for the life support.  She will have enough fuel
to last twenty four weeks at full power.  That should be plenty of
time for us to reach Massina, have the forensics experts go over
the Flamboyant and return."
     "Miakr doesn\'t mind staying?" queried Jietlshaiepr.
     Shtam shook his head.  "No, he seemed anxious to stay.  He
has ten robots to tinker with:  the automated crew of the Vixen."
     "Sounds like a good plan to me." nodded Jietlshaiepr.
"Sure," nodded Niedrsha, "let\'s do it.  It\'ll take a few days for
us to reach Aramat from here."
     Shtam smiled, "I will ride on the Vixen.  I can find out
what repairs she will need and make up a shopping list for
parts."

     Sector Capital Massina Belt A000922-B
Encoded Computer File 604 Gunned Escort Flamboyant
To: Agent 604
From:  Colonel Korispatl, Chief of SORAG operations Ikar Sector
Date: 1102-105
Message:
     I have received your report on your observations of Dr. Mako
Malenkoviepr.  His disappearance has confirmed some facts
concerning the defector:  Colonel Baremkatlashche\'.
     I also am in receipt of the report from forensics concerning
the analysis of the gunned escort Flamboyant.
     Your orders are to continue with your current cover in an
attempt to recover Dr. Malenkoviepr.  For this your group\'s
ownership of the escort has been approved.
     Colonel Baremkatlashche\' has been busy it seems.  Malenkoviepr
is one of several scientists now missing.  Our agents report the
kidnapping of several prominent scientists.
     The connection between these kidnappings and Baremkatlashche\'
has been found by your report.  It seems that three years ago an
expedition was mounted by SORAG agents to find the lost Imperial
Colonial Cruiser Kinunir.  The expedition was lost with all hands,
cause unknown.  The agents involved were hand picked by
Baremkatlashche\'.  It is to be assumed that they did recover the
Kinunir and defected to who ever Baremkatlashche\' is now working
for.  The Kinunir has also been sighted in formation with the
pirate transport Star Rider also known to be connected with
Baremkatlashche\'.
     The Flamboyant it seems is an interesting case in the extreme. 
The ship matches serial numbers of a gunned escort owned by the
Imperial Mega-Corporation Al Morai.  It was lost two years ago at
grid reference 0410 in the Ile subsector on the rimward extreme of
Ikar sector.  This system commonly known as "The Edge" has
presented a great problem to shipping in that for as long as
records go back, no ships have returned from there.  Lost in that
system are several Zhodani and Imperial warships, the largest and
most recent of which was the Imperial Scout Cruiser:  Bright Light
of the Azhanti High Lightning class.
     We have received reports that the Mega-Corporation Halden
Minerals has found evidence that the planet at "The Edge" is the
habitat of psionic organisms which kill starship crews by driving
them insane.  This is unconfirmed.  However, it would seem that
Baremkatlashche\' and his people have solved the problem of going
there and has managed to recover the lost ships.
     This may explain why the particle accelerators have been
removed from the Flamboyant.  The accelerators were either
damaged and could not be replaced, while other more powerful
ships had priority for repair, or they were deliberately removed
to be placed on more heavily armed vessels.
     Halden Minerals may have connections with Colonel
Baremkatlashche\', however, this may be difficult to track as
Halden Minerals has backers in nearly every government in the
Ikar sector.  Governments owning stock include:  The Domain of
Alntzar, The Descarothe Hedgemony, The League of Suns, The Trelyn
Domain, The Principality of Caledon, The Easmolian Confederation,
The Confederacy of Duncinae, The Grand Duchy of Marlheim, and The
Carrill Assembly.  There is also considerable stock held by the
Dakaar trading company.  You will be notified if any of these
leads prove to be fruitful.
     Analysis of materials used and techniques reveal that the
Flamboyant was modified using tech level thirteen equipment.
This matches the tech level of the Imperial Viper class fighters
found in the Air/Raft bays The welds in the ship show stresses
indicating the force of gravity on the planet where it was
modified.  Analysis shows the gravity being approximately twelve
meters per second per second acceleration.  (World size nine.)
     Gas contaminants in the welds show a high degree of
industrial pollutants.  This would indicate that either the
planet had a tainted atmosphere, or the ship was in confined in a
tainted environment when worked on.  We have compiled a list of
suspect planets in the sector.  It is interesting to note that no
planets in the Ikar sector have tech thirteen at this time.  A
few tech fourteen planets there are, but none at thirteen.
Nevertheless, we have compiled a list of possible sites for the
base where the Flamboyant was modified:

Fulton    0704 C98A788-9      Confederacy of Duncinae
     There are other possible planets, however, they have been
ruled out.  The independant planets listed could not afford such
an operation by themselves.  They are listed on the possibility
that an outside government has established a base of operations
there.
     Pirate activity appears to be centered in the Jungleblut,
Fessor, Scotian Deep, and Caledon subsectors.  Of special note is
the Zylath system in the Domain of Alntzar (Jungleblut subsector
0307).  There may be a pirate base there.
     We have received information that the pirate organization
sought to purchase ships from the vargr corsair band Uekalez.
The delivery was to be made in the Zylath system, after first
bringing the ships down from the Vargr Extents.  During this
transport, the Vixen missile platform which you have recovered
misjumped.  Upon delivery the pirates attempted to capture the
vessels rather than pay.  The resulting battle left the Uekalez
fleet damaged or captured.
     This information was obtained from survivors of the frigate
Gdaekvorr.  After the battle, the ship misjumped far into the
Consulate and were interrogated by our staff.  Five of the
corsairs are currently seeking passage out of the Consulate and
are waiting at the Massina Belt.
     They have been manipulated by our agents to seek employment
with your group.  The gunned escort requires a crew of twelve.
With the addition of these corsairs you should have an adequate
crew.  The corsairs also carry sufficient armament to be an asset
to your mission.  See their appended resumes.
     Your top priority is finding the location of Dr.
Malenkoviepr.  At this time we do not know if he was taken
willingly or not.  Should you locate him, you are required to
return him to the Consulate.  If necessary you are to eliminate
Dr. Malenkoviepr to prevent his possible collaboration with
Colonel Baremkatlashche\'.
     Good Luck.

	Thought I\'d ask for a collective opinion about a certain scenario.
In the next GaelCon MegaTraveller scenario we have a grav tank fighting a
tech level 1 culture. One of the "surprises" for the tank is loading their
catapults with tar.
	The question is, just how much do you think a grav tank would be
impaired by a few well placed loads of tar? 
	Anyone else seen any low tech "surprises"?

	Hardcore Times, or Desperate People Doing Desperate Things Like Real
				People Actually Do.

1129: Archduke (Emperor?) Dulinor of Illesh is assassinated on Dlan. After 
reading a formal concession to the throne by Duke Craig, Bzrk, Margaret, 
the Aslan, and strangely enough, the Hivers, Admiral Irene guns down Dulinor
and claims the throne herself by Right of Assassination. Clever fleet
deployment strategies enable her to live long enough to bind most of
the fleet to her. Daibei and the Hierate immediately send all available 
aid, and a defensive perimeter is set up between Margaret\'s and Dulinor/Irene\'s
safe zones. 

1130: Military construction in Margaret/Illesh/Daibei almost ceases completely.
Aslan mercenaries are used to destroy independent units within the bounds of
the domain, and obsolete ships are used to construct a makeship X-Boat
network within. Lucan is, of course, incensed, and his master plan is near
completion. 

1131: Emperor Lucan assassinated on capital by units eventually proven to
be Zhodani commandos. almost immediately the Capitol safe zone disintegrates,
and Lucan\'s former navy divides up into six fleets. Empress Irene issues
no statement concerning the death of the pretender Lucan, but divides the
responsibility for the destruction of his former forces among Antares, 
Massilia, Vland, Illesh, and Daibei. Antares strikes first, destroying both
core fleets in a strange, almost comic battle. Other attacks follow.

1132: By 230, the remains of Lucan\'s great fleets are destroyed or captured,
and mass excecutions of his former offices commence. His great secret weapon
is never found, of it was, no details were ever released. Solomani warhawks
finally come out on top, and some attacks are launched. Imperial forces
(with the new capitol at Reference) quickly stall the advance, and the 
border ceases to be anything but a large 5-pc-wide free-fire zone.

1133: At imperial orders, industry on all available planets converts to 
the production of general-purpose consumer goods, high-yeild foodstuffs, high
tech (but low-maintenace) building materials, GP weapons like lasers, etc.
Starship construction is pursued as fast as possible, but a full half of 
starships active between 1132 and 1144 are converted military models.

1135: Empress Irene abdicates in favor of Armand, a powerful Merchant. A new
law code is introduced, and specifically denies the Right of Assassination,
and all nobility is to be non-hereditary, except that each noble of standing
B or more can designate one issue (the first, basically) as a knight. The next
90 years are spent repairing the damage done in 1117-1130, and this is done in 
a variety of ways. Landless Aslan (I can\'t remember the word) males are given
failing and doomed worlds to play with, technological exchanges are set up
to assist those in low-tech areas, and the new IISS is converted into an
internal investigation service, and by 1139 has full policing powers under
the new imperial extradition/interface laws set up by Armand and his daughter
Cassidrine (a tradtion of males following females and vice-versa is set up).

So mabye I could have done better, but looking at GDW, I know I sure as
hell could have done worse. This leaves our players as follows:

Lucan: Dead. His area becomes a wasteland. Loser.
Bzrk: Autonomous Domain, much larger than Antares. Archduke. Winner.
Vland: Autonomous Domain. Winner, sort of.
Dulinor: Dead. Area becomes integral part of new Empire (the Fourth). 
Craig: Archduke, grandson becomes emperor in 1178. Winner.
Norris: Sixth Frontier War finishes him off. Deneb is divided between Vargr,
	Aslan, Vland, and Zhodani. Loser.
Aslan: Get lots of worlds in Deneb and devasted areas. Lots become imperial
	citizens. Winners, big time.
Hivers: Ever-so mysteriously, trade expands to a vast degree. Big bucks for the
	starfish. Winners.
Solomani: Terra falls again in 1198. Entire Solomani area appropriated by
	Fourth Imperium and Aslan. Losers.
Zhodani: Low-level contacts increase. Deneb headache gone for good. Time for
	another few core expeditions. Keep sneakiness image. Winners.

The reason I like this better is that you get it both ways. In safe areas,
you have the good `ole Imperium IV, with all that we knew and loved. In
devastated areas, you have slow rebuilding, rediscovery, and more aliens than
you can shake a stick out. There are always a few more raiders to go after,
planets to save, etc. Advanture stuff. But you can go back to Daibei and
actually get s ship built to boot! I know I\'d rather play in such a universe
than `Twilight:2000 in Space\'.

Actually, in countries which are signatories to the Berne Convention (lots of
countries including the US), works that you produce are automatically 
copyright (even without any copyright notice) . If you do release them onto 
an unsuspecting internet it is hard to stop others from freely copying those 
works but you do actually possess the copyright so presumably you have some 
rights if someone takes your works and publishes them under their own name.

Disclaimer: I\'m not a lawyer, but I have seen copyrights discussed on the net
plenty of times over the past few years.

On a related topic: Publishers consider electronic publishing of a literary 
work (ie posting your story to the net) to be a prior publishing when 
considering your piece. So if you want to sell first publishing rights to
a publisher, don\'t release your piece on the net. (This came from Chuq
Von Rospach in misc.writing earlier this year)

It\'s contrary to what we\'ve been told about the Zhodani. The Domain of
Deneb is no threat to them, and they prefer a stable, non-threatening
predictable neighbour like Norris to a bunch of unpredictable Vargr and
all-too-predictable Aslan. And without Zhodani backing the Domain is too
strong to pull down. Certainly neither Vargr nor Aslan have a snowball\'s
chance in hell of getting even as far as GDW claims they have.

But be that as it may, my main objection to it is not plausibility, but
practicality. The Domain is one of the best documented areas of the
Traveller universe. To invalidate 80-90% of all material published about
it is not my idea of a smart thing to do. I\'d go so far as to say that if
the destruction of the Domain was the most likely thing to happen, then
we should at all cost come up with some reason why that didn\'t happen.
But fortunately that\'s not necessary.

>       citizens. Winners, big time.

As I\'ve pointed out before, Aslans who become citizens will _strengthen_
the Domain, not destroy it. And saying \'Aslan\' is much like saying \'Humans\'.
The Aslan entities who will win or loose are individual clans.

>       Fourth Imperium and Aslan. Losers.

Huh? I can\'t see that happen. But I can see a lovely ironic developement.
Consider: The Imperium had spent generations on wooing Terra, and they
had made it. Terra had been returned to civilian control, relationships
with the Imperium were cordial, etc.. And then what happens? This bunch
of goose-stepping Solomani-uber-alles types moves in, confident that
THEY know what\'s best for Terra. What\'s the bet that they start rooting
\'impsymps\' and generally throwing their weight about to an intolerable
degree? Certainly the powers that be is not going to relinguish control
of the Solomani Confederation to Terra. No, Terra is going to be an
occupied planet for a long time to come, a hotspot of Imperial sympathy,
a really, really embarassing symbol for the Solomani cause...

\'Vargr\' is another of those terms that\'s much like \'Humans\', only more so.

> Strephon: Gimme a break. Dies during a refrigerator accident. Loser.

If you want to save an appreciable fraction of the Imperium I\'d suggest
letting Strephon turn out to be the real thing. He makes a deal with
Margaret (she becomes his heir), convinces Brzk and Craig of his bona
fides and pulls in a good bit of Ileish after Dulinor conveniently dies
(accidentally or by malice aforethought, it makes no difference). With
that he can deal with Lucan, although much of the Core goes down the
toilet in the process. The new frontier becomes a large band between
the Solomani and the Restored Imperium, filled with small polities that
recieve aid from both sides.

I\'m shaky on this, but does the concept of public domain apply to material
produced after the US implemented the Berne Conventions? As I understand
it, under Berne a creator retains \'creator\'s rights\' (the equivalent of
copyright) to anything that he dosen\'t explicitly relinguish his rights
to. Merely publishing them without a copyright notice shouldn\'t do it.

(The way I heard, the US didn\'t sign the Berne Conventions, but enacted
compatible laws for the US. Perhaps that\'s the reason for the difference.)

Note: My understanding of the Berne Conventions may well be faulty.

Steve Higginbotham once told me that with the introduction of
spinal mounts two ships of 30.000 T and up becomes better than
one ship of twice the size. This is too bad if you want your
big interstellar powers to build fewer and bigger ships to
reduce the number of ships that the Navy can spare for piracy
suppression and annoying PCs.

I\'ve therefor come up with a variant rule for starship combat
that I\'d like your opinion on:

    Larger spinal mounts have a longer range than smaller.
    Thus ships equipped with larger SMs gets one or more
    free shots at opponents with smaller SMs before these
    can get within range.

    The number of free shots a ship gets is equal to
    (difference in SM rating divided by the maneuver
    rating of the ship with the lesser SM). The figure
    is rounded up. Thus a ship with a SM rating of L (20)
    against a ship with a SM rating of G (16) and maneuver
    drive 3 will ((20-16)/3) = 1 1/3 = 2 free shots before
    the opponent can start shooting.

I know that this is a simplification of the factors involved.
For a tactical game one ought to take into account the reduced
chance of hitting at long range, and that it shouldn\'t be
accelleration but speed that decided how long a ship would be
unable to fire back, etc.. But how does it sound as a TCS rule?

The only difficulty I have with the idea is that it will encourage 
exactly the opposite behaviour you are looking for.  At TL15, a type
T meson gun can be fit into a 30,000T ship without too much trouble.
So you\'ll still see lots of small ships, since now there is even more
reason to use a big spinal mount, and even less to use secondary weapons.
So you\'ll see more jump-capable flying meson guns in the 30000-40000T 
range, and fewer battleships.
     Alternate suggestion:  if you want bigger ships (and therefore fewer
ships), allow multiple spinal mounts if the ship is big enough.  Say one
spinal mount per 100,000T of ship.  Then the multi-hundred-thousand-tonner
has a fairly significant advantage (of course the Sikkintars will still
beat them in any kind of fair fight).

There are a bunch of things in Trav science that we as players/refs
know, because *WE* are supposed to know them.  Sometimes this gets
disreguarded and the characters find out also.  The Ancients is an
example of this.

We know that the Ancients were the Droyne because GDW said so.  We
know a lotta things simply because GDW/DGP said so.  Individual Refs
may decide to do things differently.

I think the whole Ancients thing was a good mystery.  I think that it
is unfortunate that it was solved.  GDW seems to say that there is
nothing more to learn from the ancient\'s story other than the odd bits
of technology left over.

There has been stuff put out where an archeologist disagrees with the
notion that the Droyne were the ancients.  But he is considered a wacko
because he goes against current theory.  But WHO decided the current theory?

However, I would emphisize that the *PLAYERS* do NOT know about the
ancients.  They do NOT know who Grandfather is.  They do Not know that
he now lives in a pocket universe a few parsecs from Regina.

Getting back to theory, the players may have heard a lot of THEORY, but
no one knows the truth.

Now, there is one other THEORY that I find annoying, because we are told
by GDW that it is true.  In my opinion, most people would look on it as
nearly a wacky theory as the Droyne being ancients.  That is the Solomani
Hypothesis.

Ok, now, I might grant you that people of the Imperium and beyond *might*
accept that Earth was the planet where human and vargr life originally
evolved.  But put yourself in Vilani shoes for a moment:  A bunch of
jackbooted bigoted morons have announced that according to their findings,
all human life is decended from them.  They are the root of all humanity.

This sounds suspiciously like propaganda to me.

In addition, the Solomani announce that according to their findings, the
Vargr are animals genetically manipulated to produce intelligence.  Yeah!
Right!  I\'m sure the *Vargr* are gonna believe that!

Ok, now, us being logical folks we sit back and look at the evidence.
Hmmm... The fossil record shows that they are right...  Hmmm... Who did
the excavations?  The Solomani...  Yup...  Ok... The genetic analysis
indicates that they are right...  Hmmm... Now, who in the Imperium wrote
all the genetics textbooks and theories?  The Solomani...  Yeah... Right...
:-P

See what I mean?  Are you as a thinking reasoning sophont gonna stand
there and take the bigots at their word?

Now, Imperial humans, I can see accepting it.  After all the Solomani
were part of the Imperium once, and they weren\'t always the bigots they
are now.

But, what about everyone else?

Among the Vargr there are a bunch who don\'t believe this, but GDW/DGP
says they are seen as the fringe.  Their school of philosphy is that
the Vargr evolved on Earth, and it is humans who were genetically
manipulated to intelligence.  Now, let\'s look at that for a moment.
Looking at all the human minor/major races all over the place, there
is TONS of evidence for genetic manipulation among humans.  Darrians,
Vilani, Zhodani, etc. etc.

I don\'t see that everyone will accept the Solomani Hypothesis as much as
we are told they do.

What do you think?

Comments: The new class of heavy attack cruisers carries a very wide variety
	  of weaponary and mounts a formidable defensive arrangement.  It is
	  capable of one jump 6 and carries integral fuel scoops for wilderness
	  refuelling.  It featues the latest communication and sensor equipment
	  known to imperial scientists allowing for the early detection and
	  elimination of emeny fleets.  The modular construction methods
	  imployed allow for easy maintance and upgrade of the built-in
	  facilities.

	  This class of ships has a balanced offensive/defensive capability
	  that far exceeds that of other ships of equivalent size and jump
	  capability.

Thus spoke the glossy brochure handed out to the fleet admirals on the new
projects division.  Nobody seemed to realise that the ship lacked any form
of maneuver drive, that it would thus be incapable of aiming its spinal
mount and of evading emeny fire!  Despite this small short coming the navy
ordered three prototypes to be built for evaluation purposes.  Each of the
different modules were contracted out to different developers and nobody
reported the total lack of locomotion.  It wasn\'t until the prototypes
were produced and the final slot the modules into place stage was reached,
until the small flaw was detected.  The prototypes were completed anyway
and towed into orbit and left there as a heavy system defense orbitting
platform.  In this role they serve admirably defending local shipping
from the evil pirate fleets that always seem to appear right next to these
capable vessles (and that get blasted away).








How\'s this for an entry into the stupid ships contest?
It can go into either the worst ship class or the worst immobile class.
(it is really a ship since it carries a lovely jump drive, it can even use the
drive to escape from possible danger should it start losing a battle against
the evil pirate hordes ;-).

Come to that, when did it become the current theory? In 1105 (date of
earliest adventure published) no-one had any notion that the Droyne
had any connection to the Ancients. Remember _Research Station Gamma_
and _Twilight\'s Peak_? Then some obscure adventurers (the PCs) gets
an inkling of the truth, and hey presto! it\'s the generally accepted
truth throughout the Imperium. :-P

Remarks:	The Pinto class ground car has a very unusual defensive
system, something akin to a Monarch butterfly.  The Monarch butterfly has
poisons in it\'s systems, that cause a predator to become ill if they eat
one.
	The Pinto uses similar stratagies to dissuade attack.  The heart of
this defence is the gas tank.  When struck with sufficient force, the gas
tank will rupture, catch fire and eventually explode.  However, this was
countered, by the attackers simply moving away from a striken Pinto.  Thus,
the car was equipped with a very special transmission.  When the car is hit
from ahead, the transmission will remain in gear and continue driving until
it noses up against the attacker and then explode.  If struck from behind,
the transmission will automatically shift into reverse to pursue the
attacker.
	The transmission design is referred to as the \'Corbomite Device\'
for reasons unknown.
	4 ejection seats are available as an option but this adds 20,000 Cr
to the total cost of the vehicle.

[Ref\'s:  Any time the chassis is rendered inoperable, but not destroyed, the

How about visiting a small but relatively isolated town nearby, or
contacting the chamber of commerce therein? If I was looking for a town
in the 45.000 range, I might choose Corvallis, Oregon (home of Oregon
State University and Mark Cook). I\'m not rightly sure how many varied
shops Corvallis has, but as a college town I can state with some
authority that when I was in school there there were exactly thirteen
pizza outlets.

my answer:

This is a yes vote on fiction on the TML.

I could tolerate probably up to a piece of fiction a mailing (ie one
per day), so long as each piece was about half the length of what 
Scott Kellogg typically posts for his 4.5th frontier war stuff.
Alternatively, I could probably be just as tolerant of two to three pieces
a week, each of which was as long as what Scott currently posts for fiction.

In general, the PBEM episodes, even though they show up once in a blue moon,
are too long to digest all at once; also making hard copy of them
to bring home to my traveller group is difficult. When the TML is that 
long I have to schedule the LONG personal print job for after hours, instead 
of during lunch.

My tolerance for fiction on the TML would probably go out the window if the
quality were bad.  So far, however, I and my off-line "lurkers" have enjoyed
what we\'ve seen so far (except our ref keeps getting ideas...).

How\'s that for a long vague list of ill-defined boundary conditions?

I recently found out about neural jack technology in 2300ad.

Could someone give a plausible way for them to work?  I have some trouble
believing them: how can you, from a quite small area (the jack) tap into the
visual nerves (in form of the face), hearing nerves ( on each side of the
head), olfatory sensations (I never bothered to know where those go
throught) and touch and muscle movement (going through the back of the
neck). 

And all that comes from a remarkebly conservative technology (just take a
look at surveillance stuff - almost(?) late 20th century).

    'body' => 'If one wishes to make larger Meson Guns superior to smaller Meson Guns,
one should first consider the physics of Meson Guns.  A Meson Gun consists
of two particle accelerators, one for protons, the other for electrons.  The
two beams are made to cross at a point in space.  The resulting nuclear
interation produces a shower of mesons headed away from the firing vehicle.
The input energy to the reaction effects the velocity with which the mesons
move, causing them to move at relatavistic velocities, producing a time-
dilation effect.  Mesons have a definite half-life before they undergo
radioactive decay, but the time-dilation may be used to caused this decay
to occur at a desired place in space (i.e. inside an enemy vessel).  However,
as you wish to cause this decay to happen farther and farther away from the
firing vessel, it is necessary to accelerate the mesons faster and faster,
requiring greater input energy to the Meson Gun.  Hence, larger mesons guns
(which generally have greater energy requirements) should possess larger
range.  There should, in fact be a trade off involved, as the energy can go
into making more mesons of the same velocity, or the same number of faster
mesons.  This effect can be simulated by stating a Attenuation type statistic
for Meson Guns, as well as a Maximum Range.  Of course, Meson Guns do not
"Penetrate" in the usual sense, but the Attenuation statistic should reduce
the number of hits caused by the Meson gun at greater range.  I suggest that
the stated number of hits for each meson gun be that at short range, and that
the following table be used for Attenuation:
		    Attenuation	  TL
           	      1           12
            	      2           13
            	      3           14
            	      4           15+
The effect of Attenuation is to reduce the number of hits by half.  Attenuation
should be considered for each range band beyond Planetary range.			

By the by, none of this is going to effect the original reason this thread
started, which is the desire of a ref to cut down the number of vessel
available to screw with PCs, as even a 10kT vessel could make an adventure
real short (hello, zap!).

	The US Subs have about 20% less work space than surface ships
do for the same amount of machinery (rough estimate from n-tens of plans
I\'ve been priviledged to look over while I was at school in Naval Architecture)
so they would exemplify the "moderately cramped" rule.  Surface ships do not
in general operate under the same 3 full watch system as subs do, at least
the ones whose crews and officers I\'ve talked with.  Nearly everyone
keeps relatively normal sleeping hours...
	Soviet subs... well, (ugh yuck) they\'re real cramped.  30% or more
less space than desirable.

I think we need to acknowledge that the quantity and quality of community
resources depends a lot on the culture.  The *BEST* university in all of
Europe (west and east) was, until the 1800\'s or so, Jewish, and in the

Who are the lucky tars you\'ve talked to?  During my time in the Coast Guard

that the sea and I reached an agreement:  I won\'t go out, and I won\'t get

George, plese send me some references for good naval architecture info.
I\'m toying with the notion of building a boat to warm up for the plane
I\'m going to build (and I AM going to build one).  Not that they\'re any
simpler, I know that.  It\'s just that if a boat sinks on a test flight,
you can pretty much swim to shore. Not so lucky in a plane.

You who are smart GM\'s might consider this as a seed for an adventure
or two.

    'body' => 'The following question arose during a recent Traveller campaign.  If jump
drives in MegaTraveller use a lanthanum hull grid to carry the ship into
jump, how do non-Starships use a jump shuttle.  In Supplement 7, Traders &
Gunboats (pp. 36-37), there is a Jump Shuttle that attaches to the rear of
a System Defense Boat.  It does not fully enclose the SDB, so the lanthanum
hull grid of the jump shuttle will not suffice to carry the SDB into jump.
Further research revealed the depiction of the World Class Battle Tender with
Battle Riders in Supplement 8, Library Data (p. 16).  Once again, the battle
riders are not fully enclosed by the tender.  It is my contention that any
non-Starship that is to be carried into jump by another vessel must be fully
enclosed by that vessel, unless the non-Starship has at least a Lanthanum grid
of its own.  Then, the assisting vessel provides the jump fuel, jump power
plant, jump governor, jump hull radiators, and jump energy sinks (this
breakdown of the jump drive into component parts is based of DGP\'s Starship
Operations Manual, vol. 1, p. 9).

Using Book 5:  High Guard (p. 31), it is possible to contruct the following 
information:

Energy Sinks displace 0.5% of hull volume X Jump #.
The Jump Governor displaces 1% of hull volume.
The Jump Power Plant displaces 0.5% of hull volume X Jump #.
The Lanthanum Hull Grid and Jump Hull Radiators have no effective displacement.

Energy Sinks cost MCr4 per ton of energy sink.
The Jump Governor costs MCr1 per ton of governor.
The Lanthanum Hull Grid costs MCr0.02 X hull volume in tons.
The Jump Power Plant and Jump Radiators costs MCr2 per ton of Jump Power Plant.

e.g. 1.  a 100-ton Starship has a Jump-2 drive.  This can be broken down into:
   1.0 ton  of energy sink
   1.0 ton  of jump governor.
 + 1.0 ton  of high-yield power plant.
 = 3.0 tons of total jump drive

The price can be broken down into:
   MCr4 for the energy sinks.
   MCr1 for the jump governor.
   MCr2 for the lanthanum hull grid.
 + MCr2 for the high-yield power plant & hull radiators
 = MCr9 total for the jump drive.

In other words, exactly the same total displacement and cost as stated in the
Referee\'s Manual! (No accident, of course).

e.g. 2.  a 400-ton non-Starship has a Lanthanum Hull Grid installed.  This will
add MCr8 to the total cost foo the vessel.  Compare this to the cost of the SDB
on p. 85 of the Imperial Encyclopedia.  This will add 2.1% to the cost of the
vessel (factoring in the 20% discount for a standard design).  Note that the
vessel is still considered a non-Starship, because it is still dependent on its
jump shuttle to enter jump.

I therefore conclude that this design change will not alter the price or
performance of Starships, and will only slightly alter the price of non-
Starships.  Speaking as a fan of the Battle Rider concept, I\'m releived to say
that.

Perhaps the more important change is that in Space Combat.  Since the effect 
Jump -n on the damage tables can be attributed to damage to the Lanthanum hull
grid (albeit damage so extensive that this result is located on the Interior
Explosion chart), the above mentioned SDB can now suffer this damage in combat.
This effect is difficult to attain, so that the Battle Rider concept still
makes sense.  See Traveller\'s Digest #16, pp. 42-43 for a more extensive 
discussion of this.

e.g. 3.  The above mentioned 400-ton SDB is normally capable of Jump-1 when
mated with its Jump Shuttle.  In combat, the SDB suffers the result Jump -1.
The SDB/Shuttle Combination can no longer jump together.  Of course, the
Jump Shuttle can still mate with another, undamaged, SDB, or jump by itself.
Damage to the SDB results in no reduction in performance for the jump
shuttle.

As an interesting side note, it is possible to determine that the energy
required to enter jump is 351 MW X Jump # per displacement ton of vessel
(see DGP\'s Starship Operations Manual, vol. 1, p. 13, and the Referee\'s
Manual, p. 95).

I\'m sure Glennis would LOVE that, you sleazebucket. Why does she have to
be Solomani, anyway? If she were a Zhodani, she\'d have a natural tan,
and if she were Vilani, the lower-caste and easier to hire she was, the
less she\'d wear! And (in a devastatingly DEFT linkup to the recent post
on interspecies romance) why limit ourselves to a HUMAN woman? We could
find ourselves a nice Aslan female with good measurements (38-32-24-36)
and put HER in a bikini! Or a Vargr female (34-33-32-24-36)! Or a Hiver

Have you even wondered how a pizza is delivered at TL15?  Well, I\'ve got the
answer for you!

Firstly, a series of standard self warming pizza boxes.  Each box is designed to
hold a single pizza of the specified size and to keep it at the correct
temperature for a duration of one hour.

   Hull: 1/1 Disp=0.005457, Config=6SL, Armour=1G
	 Unloaded=0.000045255
  Power: Storage Battery 0.000005457MWhrs, Duration=1
    Def: DefDM=+2
Control: Environ=basic env
  Other: Cargo=0.005429 = 18 inch pizza
	 ObjSize=Small, EmLevel=Faint


CraftID: 24 inch pizza box, Type XT, TL15, Cr159.47
   Hull: 1/1 Disp=0.009701, Config=6SL, Armour=1G
	 Unloaded=0.000080448
  Power: Storage Battery 0.000009701MWhrs, Duration=1
    Def: DefDM=+2
Control: Environ=basic env
  Other: Cargo=0.009651 = 24 inch pizza
	 ObjSize=Small, EmLevel=Faint


All of these boxes includes a battery that is able to keep the pizza at a
decent temperature for about one hour.  All three of the boxes are 3cm high
and are roughly disc shaped.  There is a centimeter or so tolerance around the
edge of the pizza and the edge of the box.  Only the unloaded weight is
given since the loaded weight depends heavily upon the type of pizza installed
in the container.


An attempt was made to produce a self delivering version of the above boxes
by fitting a grav drive to them and increasing the battery\'s capability.  The
following series of boxes all have a 1G maneuver drive and can sustain full
power output for a duration of one hour (if the travel time is less than
the hour, the pizza will stay warmer for longer).

These boxes are not overly intelligent but they do provide a fire and forget
delivery system (customers are charged when they place the order).

These self delivering boxes have been banned by most systems in the imperium
due to their dumb nature.  They are not able to take evasive action without
substantial extras being added to the basic unit.  They have been known to
cause quite impressive damage when things get in their way.



Hows that for an entry into the dumbest grav vehicle and dumbest immobile

dont just leave it to someone else

But if you do have ideas lemmie know what they are ....

Oh and you can get technical cause hes a computer freak and will

Post em to the newsgroup .......

Oh and James .....If there is any useful gossip on putes from the
past, do you have them handy ??????? (Please)

One more note about the Rogue Character Occupation I posted ......

(Ignore this if you dont use it)

Change the result of 7 on the assignment table to None (For Offworld
and Onworld), the character has no crim activity that year (roll 4+
to avoid prosecution for previous crimes, no skills or connections made)
and put the previous assigment (Infiltration) on the special assignment
table at roll 1 (Player gets to choose between assassination or
inflitration) . Also for prisoners rolling parole, the character makes
survival checks etc against the previous assignment rolled (but rolls
for parole at the end of it) . Those whose previous assignment was
mining cannot get parole (roll again but if rerolled they can) . If
the previous assignment was a special assignment, roll again on the
assignments table then make parole check at the end of that  If a 
special assignment is rolled, the character does that special
assignment and gets to roll for parole at the end of it . 

Phew ! Any problems lemmie know ........

Of course I realize that culture and economics will cause variations.
I\'m not trying to get THE definitive answer, I just don\'t want to have
something obviously wrong. If someone tells my that their population
24.000 community has 5 rat-catchers then I could have one or five or
ten in my Traveller colony, but I could at least avoid the mistake of
putting in 50 or 100.

I\'ve been considering running a TCS campaign (I want to use it to generate
a campaign history) and have run into a couple of fairly thorny problems.

First, how do I deal with tech level advancement?  I\'m sort of inclined to
seperate TL into the various sub-areas of power generation, medical, jump,
m-drive, etc etc, but how do I determine when an area is eligible to increase?
What about sub-area interaction?  Meson technology, for example, should never
be allowed to drop below particle beam tech level, but what should the other
interactions be?

Secondly, what about economics?  I feel that a planet should have X tons of
shipping pass through its starports each year to support a given GPP, but I\'m
having a difficult time determining what the value of X should be.  I really
like this idea because it allows the empires to hurt each other badly by
commerce raiding, or even boost their own GPP by taking prize ships home. 
This has the added benefit of causing all sorts of possibilities for plot
complications when my PCs start adventuring later.

Thanks for the input,

Joe

Subsidized Liner nearly persuaded me to keep my money, but fortunately my
store allows their customers to look inside the merchandize before buying.
The liner turns out to be converted to a StarMerc cruiser; quite useful.

Unfortunately GDW persists in their wilful disregard of common sense when
it comes to the effects of the hard times. The subsector (Promise,
L/Diaspora, just spinward of one of the subsectors in \'Hard Times\')
contains a world with a population of 5 billion that has been bombed
down from Starport A, TL F to Starport B, TL D. This still leaves them
capable of supporting more than 24 Trillion Credit Squadrons. Despite
this their fleet consists of six _Gazelles_, six 400 T SDBs, four armed
Far Traders, three Patrol Cruisers, one armed Yacht, a _Broadsword_ and a
Corsair (plus 40+ small craft). I haven\'t bothered to figure out how much
of the naval budget there\'s left after maintaining this impressive fleet[1],
but we are told that the conversion of the aforementioned Subsidized Liner
to a military vessel were suspended in 1123 due to lack of funds...

Apparently GDW sees no paradox in having a TL D starport that can build
spaceships, but not starships. IMO during the Hard Times any world with
a TL above 8 will either have a Starport E-C (if someone bombed the
hell out of the yards recently) or A. The only place where type B
starports makes sense is on worlds with TL 6-8.

Incidentally, someone still seems to be enforcing interdictions.

Hi, Everyone!  I\'m back from what seems like a catastropic misjump.  Suffice
it to say that I was in limbo for about a month, but now I have a new place
to live and enough spare time to catch up on TML.  By the way, anyone who
wants to show up is invited to my housewarming on June 6th; I\'m in the
Rockville, MD (Washington DC Metropolitan) area.  Send email to me for the
time and the directions (mail to wildstar@popeet.acs.com, and make sure the
subject line starts out "Directions to Housewarming" or somethin like that.

While I am thinking about it, how many TML-ers are planning on going to
Atlanticon in College Park (July 3, 4, and 5; see the ad in Challenge 60)?
Perhaps we can arrange a TML lunch, dinner, or other get-together during
the convention!  I can\'t get to Gencon/Origins this year, so Atlanticon
will be my major gaming event this year.  I am willing to co-ordinate and
serve as a contact point, so send mail to me (wildstar@popeet.acs.com) with
"Atlanticon" displayed prominently in the subject line.

Anyway, on to my topic for today\'s rants and raves:


Trade, Commerce, Taxation, and the Imperial Navy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
People who don\'t appreciate detailed numeric analyses of game mechanics
should probably skip this article.  Given the longevity of this thread, and
the lack of complaints, I presume that there are very few people on TML that
fall into this category.


Recap for Those Who Came In Late
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I fed all of the sector data files (from the TML archive site) into the
mainframe at work, and had it crunch the data for a while.  I came up with
the following interesting statistics (these represent the Third Imperium at
its approximate peak).  The Empire contained 10,497 main worlds with a
population of about 16,731,817,153,000 sophonts.  The annual Gross Imperial
Product is 219,474,958,700,000,000 Imperial Standard Credits.  The Imperium
imposes a tax burden of about 1% of the GIP, producing Imperial revenues of
about 2,194,749,587,000,000 Imperial Standard Credits per year.

Using the TCS starship construction rules in combination with (hopefully
reasonable) assumptions about the types of ships constructed, I further
calculated that there are 11,813,221 starships registered in the Imperium; 
with an aggregate volume of 73,832,634,000 tons displacement.  The original
article, along with the supporting data tables to support my conclusions,
should be available from one of the TML FTP sites.  Recently, I have been
looking at some of these figures more closely.


Implications for Interstellar Commerce
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming that these 73.83 billion tons of starships carry about 50% of their
volume as cargo or freight, we have 36.92 billion tons to allocate between
cargo and freight.  Since speculation should be much more lucrative than
shipping freight at 1,000 Cr/Ton, it seems reasonable to assume that more
than half of this volume will be used for speculative trade (let\'s assume a
figure of 75%). Some will be used for regular freight, and some will be
empty, despite the best efforts of captain and crew (I will assume that 5%
is empty, and 20% is used for freight).

A quick glance at the MegaTraveller trade and speculation rules shows that
profits of approximately 2,000 Cr/Ton are an acheivable goal, and that
considerable higher profits are possible.  Therefore, the cargo and freight
contribution to the GIP are:

Cargo ---- 0.75 * 36,916,317,000 * 2,000 = 55,374,475,000,000 Cr
Freight - 0.20 * 36,916,317,000 * 1,000 =  7,383,263,400,000 Cr
                                  Total = 62,757,738,400,000 Cr

Passenger revenues are probably much smaller.  We can estimate these with
the assumption that 10% of the total starship volume is used for
passengers.  This results in 7.383 billion tons of passenger accomodations. 
We will further assume that 90% of these are staterooms and the rest are low
passage berths; resulting in 1,661,234,265 staterooms and 738,326,340 low
berths.  A starship will fill as many staterooms with high passages as
possible, and the rest will be middle passages (although some staterooms may
be empty).  A breakdown of 75% high, 20% middle, and 5% empty seems
reasonable.  A reasonable assumption about the low berths is that they will
be 90% full during a voyage.  Therefore we have:

High ---- 0.75 * 1,661,234,265 * 10,000 = 12,459,256,000,000 Cr
Middle - 0.20 * 1,661,234,265 *  8,000 =  2,657,974,800,000 Cr
Low ---- 0.90 *   738,326,340 *  2,000 =  1,328,987,400,000 Cr
                                 Total = 16,446,219,200,000 Cr

This puts the grant total at 79,203,958,000,000 Cr per voyage.  I assume
that the average commercial starship makes one voyage every two weeks,
except for the 4-week maintainance period, for a total of 24 trips per year.
This means that in the course of a year, the total Imperial interstellar
trade contribution to the GIP is 1,900,894,900,000,000 Cr.  Therefore,
interstellar trade contributes 0.8661% of the total GIP.  This slightly less
than the tax burden imposed by the Imperium, and is in fact a such a small
fraction of the GIP that the complete cessation of interstellar trade should
cause no more hardship than a recession.

Reason for the End of the Imperium #542: It is more economically feasable
for member worlds to cease all interstellar trade than it is for them to
continue to pay Imperial taxes.  The Vilani merchant class (having been
duped by the magnitude of the numbers for 11,000 years) all commit
Hari-Kiri with their pocket calculators, leaving all the interstellar
markets a bloody mess.  Worlds that depend on trade and commerce starve, but
most of the former Imperium hardly notices the end of interstellar trade (a
Gross Planetary Product drop of under 1% is simply a passing recession).

On the average, 1 Imperial citizen in 442 takes an interstellar trip each
year.  Since there are quite a few that travel nearly every other week, this
probably means that fewer 0.2% of the Imperial citizens ever make an
interstellar voyage in any given year, and probably less than 15% have ever
left their homeworld in their lives.  

Similarly, the trade volume works out to about 0.05 tons (0.70 cubic meter)
of goods per year; given that this volume includes packing materials, this
would be approximately one or two consumer items. Since this is an average,
I believe it is safe to assume that more than half of the Imperial citizens
own or use at least one thing that was imported from offworld.  However,
given the volume of trade, it is very likely that these things are
novelties, data, or luxury goods of some kind.  At 0.87% of the GIP, I can
see no way that interstellar trade provides the economic foundation for more 
than a small fraction of the worlds of the Imperium.

One of the more disturbing results above is that the Imperial tax burden is
greater than the fraction of the GIP due to interstellar trade.  There are
some changes I can think of to bring these results back into line.  Most
desirable would be to redesign the entire ship design, trade, and commerce
rules; this would be a non-trivial effort, but should result in a great
improvement the whole game.  Another option might be to increase the
commerce volume by a factor of 10 (making it about 8.66% of the GIP). This
option might not be unreasonable, and would have the Imperial tax burden at
about 11.55% of the volume of interstellar trade.

A better idea (at least in my mind) would be to take a different approach.
Reducing the Imperial tax burden by a factor of 10 would also be reasonable.
One approach to this would be to assume that the Imperium taxes worlds on
the basis of their interstellar trade.  This would place the burden of the
cost of the Imperium directly on those worlds that benefit the most.  It
would also provide a reason why evasion of customs would be an Imperial
crime.  A reasonable tax rate would be 10.00% of the volume of trade.

This would place Imperial tax revenues at 190,089,490,000,000 Imperial 
Standard Credits per year.  A possible breakdown of these revenues into
expenditure categories might be as follows (remember, I just made these
numbers up; they also don\'t match the numbers I made up the last time I
did this, so feel free to re-arrange them as you see fit).

The Size of the Navy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Of interest to recent discussions is the size of the Navy, and the portion
devoted to internal anti-piracy and similar duties.  A possible breakdown
of the Navy budget might be as follows:

Approximately 13.1 trillion credits are spent each year on new
construction.  It seems reasonable to assume that new ships will see at
most 50 years of front-line service before being retired to reserve fleets,
placed in storage, sold into civillian service, or broken up for scrap
(depending on the condition of the vessel).  These ships will need to be
replaced by new construction.  Therefore, the Imperial Navy contains a
total of about 656,069,350,000,000 credits worth of front-line warships.
The Imperium probably has an equal number in storage and reserve fleets.  An
possible breakdown of the ships into types is presented below, with an 
average cost per ship to help aid in estimating the size of the fleet.  The 
per-ship costs are an estimated average from FSSI (I know, they are both
wrong and inefficient - but FSSI is "official", so go figure).

Battle Line refers to battleships, battlecruisers, battleriders, and 
battletenders.  Screen refers to the screening forces for the above, namely
cruisers in all shapes and sizes.  Fleet escort refers to destroyers and
fleet escorts designed to work with the above classes.  Assault ships are
the planetary assault vessels: carriers, troopships, and assault cruisers
of various kinds.  Support vessels are the tankers and auxiliaries to 
support the battle fleets.  Anti-Piracy refers to ships designed and deployed
specificly in the anti-pirate and anti-raider role.

(*) Note: the cost of a "battleship" varies greatly, even amoung the
designs presented in FSSI.  The actual number of ships is probably much
larger, especially if the bulk of the fleet are the more efficient designs.

Of these, 7.69% will be in refit at any given time, and (assuming that the
Navy personnel turn over an average of once every 12 years) about 8.33%
will be in a training cycle.  A ship will typically not be patrolling in
the same system as its base.  A reasonable assumption is that the bases are
an average of two jumps from the patrol area, so a ship will spend about 4
weeks of non-refit, non-training time in jumpspace.  Once on station, the
ship will spend about 1 day in 30 refueling and about 7 days in 30
reprovisioning, laying over, or on shore leave for the crew (a total of
about 26.67% of the time).  This leaves about half of the force available
at any one time (in wartime a lot of these layovers and shore leaves would
be cancelled, and much training and preventative maintainance curtailed, 
resulting in a much higher availability).  This compares favorable with
similar figures for the Pre-WWII peacetime US Navy, which spent about 60%
of its time docked at its bases.


Anti-Piracy Forces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What all of this boils down to is that about 16,402 ships will be dedicated
to the anti-piracy role and actively patroling at any one time.  This is
more than one per world in the Imperium, but it is more likely that the 
forces will be concentrated.  If it actually takes about 12 ships to
completely secure a world against piracy, only about 12.74% of the worlds 
of the Imperium can be secured at any given time.  It is likely that many
worlds are constantly patrolled (those with naval bases, important lines of
communication, and important trade centers), while some worlds never see
a patrol ship.  Most worlds will fall somewhere in between, being patrolled
on a random basis, or as the need is felt.  Many of the other worlds (those
with class A or B ports) will construct their own defense forces.

A quick and dirty game mechanic for determining the presence of a patrol
force around a given world might be:
	1) The world is HiPop, or a TL9+ class A or B port.
	2) Contains a Navy or Scout facility.
	3) Is on an X-Boat route.
If any of these conditions are met, the world is automatically patrolled by
a a force of the referee\'s choosing (one suggestion is 2d6 patrol vessels).
If none of the above are met, the system is patrolled on a roll of 11+
	DM +2 for starport class A or B
	DM +1 for starport class C
	DM -1 for starport class E
Other DMs for special circumstances (such as recent outbreak of pirate
activity) are at the referee\'s discretion, as is the size of the patrol
force, although again a 2d6 roll is recommended).


Starship Construction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One of the main obstacles to larger merchant ships is the economics of ship
building.  As detailed in Trillion Credit Squadron, a ship under
construction uses shipyard space equal to its displacement for the entire
time it is being constructed.  This rule does not seem to have been changed
in MegaTraveller.  Because larger ships take longer to construct than
smaller ones, this means that the "cost" (in terms of shipyard space) for a
10,000-ton ship is more than twice the cost of fifty 200-ton ships.
Shipyard space represents capital; the owners of the yard will want to make
the best return possible.  Therefore, shipyards will want to build smaller
ships (certainly under 10,000 tons, and the smaller the better).  Small
vessels (perhaps under 1,000 tons) can probably be produced on speculation,
while larger ships will not be laid down without a firm contract in hand.

This means several things to players and referees.  First of all, it means
that smaller ships would be more numerous than any other type. Small ships,
both new and used, would also be readily available for purchase by
corporations and anyone else who could raise the necessicary financing. 
Secondly, these ships would be built to standard, general-purpose plans;
because the buyer and intended purpose would not be known beforehand. 
Finally, large ships are more likely to be custom-built, special-purpose
things, and are likely to belong to the military or the larger
corporations.  Given the high cost and long delay in acquiring these ships,
player characters are not likely to have them.

I also feel that the price of a starship should be considered to be in local
credits, as this (quite correctly) makes lower-tech ships cheaper than their
high-tech successors.  For those who don\'t have the relevant Classic
Traveller materials, the following chart sums up what you need to know (the
number in the body of the chart is the multiplier for the final price):

	Tech	Port	Port
	Level	A	B

	20	1.50	1.45
	19	1.40	1.35

	----


Cheaper Merchant Ships
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To make larger merchant ships more prevalent, we need to improve the
profitability of larger ships (at least as compared to small ones); this
makes them more economically feasable and offsets the high economic cost of
their construction.  One way to do this would be to provide a special 
discount for merchant vessels (and to think of a reason that it should not 
apply to Navy and para-military ships).

My suggestion is that ships built to "civilian" standards be eligible for
a price break of 50% (yup, half; I haven\'t flipped my lid - keep reading).
The price break represents a general lowering of standards in many of the
ship\'s systems.  As an example, because the ship is not intended to sail
into harm\'s way, a $35 space-spec SCR can be substituted for the $75
mil-spec component, with no real loss of passenger or crew safety.

To be eligible, the ship must meet all of the following criteria:
	1) Maneuver rating of no more than 2g (and less than the TL limit).
	2) Jump drive must be rated at less than the TL limit.  In other
	   words, to qualify a ship must be a TL10+, and Jump-1 at TL10 and
	   TL11, Jump-1 or -2 at TL12, Jump-1, -2, or -3 at TL13, and so on.
	3) Agility must be 0.
	4) No more than 1 hardpoint per 1,000 tons displacement or fraction
	   thereof.  No bay or spinal weapons allowed.
	5) No armor above the minimum required for a spaceworthy hull.
	   Planetoid hulls are allowed, but buffered planetoids are not.
	6) No screens allowed.
	7) No launch facilities or launch tubes allowed.

The primary game effect of such a design is that the yearly maintainance
is a much more critical task.  If for any reason the maintainance is skipped,
the referee should accelerate the timetable (count one week past maintainance
as two, and so on).

If one of these "civilian" designs does get into combat, the referee should
adjust the damage table results to reflect the much lower damage tolerance
the civilian design has.  As a general rule, increase the damage results to
their maximum possible (for example, increase a "Maneuver-1" result to
"Maneuver Drive Out", "Computer-1" to "Computer Out", or "Fuel-1" to "Fuel
Tanks Shattered").  This should tend to keep these ships out of combat
except as a last resort (if the lack of armament doesn\'t already do that).


More Expensive Weapons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Compared to a starship, weapon systems are small and cheap.  One way to
change this would be to modify the method of allocating hardpoints.  My
suggestion is to design a ship, and compute the number of hardpoints
designated (whether or not they have weapons mounted on them when the ship
is designed).  Then divide the dispacement tonnage of the ship by the
number of hardpoints, and consult the following table:

                  ---- Hardpoint ----
Tons/Hardpoint   Cost    Vol     Mass
               
5,000 or more    0.005   0.010   0.020
2,000 - 4,999    0.010   0.050   0.100
1,000 - 1,999    0.050   0.100   0.200
  900 -   999    0.100   0.500   1.000
  800 -   899    0.250   1.000   2.000
  700 -   799    0.500   1.500   3.000
  600 -   699    0.750   3.375   6.750
  500 -   599    1.000   3.375   6.750
  400 -   499    2.000   6.750  13.500
  300 -   399    3.000   6.750  13.500
  200 -   299    4.000   6.750  13.500
  100 -   199    5.000  13.500  27.000
   50 -    99    6.000  13.500  27.000
   10 -    49    8.000  13.500  27.000
    1 -     9   10.000  13.500  27.000

Cost is in MCr; Volume is in cubic meters; Mass is in metric tons.

This way, large and relatively unarmed ships cost almost exactly what they
did before, but the 200-ton ship with two triple turrets costs
significantly more than before - an extra 10 MCr.  The cost, volume, and
mass are for special attachments and fittings for mounting the weapon.  The
main structural member and pressure vessel in a MegaTraveller ship is its
hull. Piercing the hull significantly weakens the structure, and
concentrates stresses; therefore additional structural members are required
at each point.


Design Sequence Modifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another idea is to require crew workstations in addition to normal
accomodations for vessels with extended accomodations; I personally don\'t
feel that enough space is available in the control panels and living
quarters to make a decent bridge for a starship.  Ships with extended
accomodations would require the installation of a workstation as well as
accomodations for bridge crew, gunners, engineers, and carried craft
support crew.  In the first two cases, the workstation provides seating,
working room, and a place to mount the required control panels.  In the
second two cases, the workstation is not actually a control installation,
but consists of working space and areas to store tools and spare parts.


Combat Information Centers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fighting ships (or vessels expecting a lot of combat activity) should have
a combat information center (CIC, also called by various other names, like
fire direction center or battle bridge).  The CIC is usually located in a
well-protected area of this ship, and contains computers, controls, and
workstations for a combat commander, sensor analysts, and battery
co-ordinators, communications operators and fighter controllers.  While you
can assume that the MegaTraveller rules include the CIC in the bridge, I
would rather not.  Use the following rules to compute the size of the CIC;
right after figuring the bridge would be about the right time.  

A workstation for the commander is required; it must have a control panel
and a control panel add-on (for additional data display).  If no add-on can
be installed (due to TL or other limitations), a manual situation display
must be installed (1 cubic meter, 0.001 Mcr, 0.250 tons) and a crewmember
provided to update it (one workstation and control panel of any type); this
provides in effect, a manual Heads-Up Display.  

Every target to be simultaneously engaged requires 10 control points (CP)
from a sensor analyst.  Incoming missiles engaged by active defenses do
apply to this total; count 1 "target" (10 CP) for each enemy ship which
fired missiles. Each analyst can have no more than 10 control panels and
one panel add-on; the effect may be multiplied by whatever computer has
been installed in the CIC.  Note that low-tech designs may require more
than one sensor analyst per target.  At least one sensor analyst is
required for all designs.

If the vessel has any battery (spinal, bay, or turret) weapons, 10 CP are
required from a battery co-ordinator for each one.  Each co-ordinator can
have no more than 10 control panels and one panel add-on; however, each
co-ordinator can control at least one battery, no matter how few CP are
output by the position.  At least one battery co-ordinator is required for
each class of weaponry installed (the designer of the vessel designates the
weapons classes in any reasonable manner, depending on the intended use of
the vessel; possible configurations include spinal/bay/turret,
laser/missile/pa-gun, anti-ship/anti-surface/anti-missile, and others).

If the vessel has any carried craft (fighters, riders, gunboats, or
whatever), 10 CP are required from a fighter controller for each one. 
Fighters operated in flights count as one "craft" for these purposes.  Each
controller can have no more than 10 control panels and one panel add-on;
however, one controller can control at least one fighter or flight, no
matter how few CP are ouptut by the position.  At least one fighter
controller is required if any carried craft are to be operated in combat. 
Also, at least one controller is required per launching facility or launch
tube installed.  Open frame hull configurations count as one launching
facility (no matter how many craft can be launched at once) for the
purposes of this rule.

Communications operators are optional in the CIC.  If the vessel is to
operate as the flagship (command ship) of a group of ships, at least one
communications operator must be present.  Each other ship in the group
requires 10 CP from a communications operator (do not count fighters or
other craft included in the total for fighter controllers above).  Each
operator can have no more than 10 control panels and one panel add-on;
however, one operator can handle at least one other vessel, no matter how
few CP are output by the position.

Without a CIC installed, ships are limited in two major ways; both
simulated in MegaTraveller by the tactics point pool.  First of all, if the
command vessel of a group of ships does not have a CIC, the total size of
the tactics point pool is halved, rounding up (to simulate the burden
placed on the commander by the lack of combat information support). 
Secondly, a ship which has no CIC halves its tactics points, rounding up,
to compute the tactical DM.  A few of examples should make things clear,
see below.

Convoy Example: A warship (CIC, Tac=3) is convoying several merchantmen (No
CIC, No Tactics).  The warship is in overall command, and the tactical
pool has 3 points in it.  Tactical point usage by the warship is normal,
but tactical points used by the merchants are halved; so that 1 tactical
point creates a DM of +1 (half of one, rounded up), but all 3 are required
to create a DM of +2.

Convoy Example: A group of armed merchant vessels (No CIC, Tac=2,1,1,1,0)
operate as a convoy.  The captain with the best tactical skill is placed in
overall command.  The tactical pool would be 5, but is halved to 3 due to
the lack of a CIC in the command ship.  Tactical points used by any ship
are halved, so that 1 point creates a DM of +1, and 3 are required for +2.

Pirate Example: A pirate squadron consists of two armed merchant ships (No
CIC, Tac=1,0), a scoutship (No CIC, Tac=1), and two captured patrol vessels
(CIC, Tac=3,2).  The player characters (Tac=3 in one of the patrol ships)
are in overall command.  The tactical pool is 7.  Tactical points used by
the merchants or the scout would be haved as in the above examples.

If a CIC was installed but does not meet the minimum requirements for the
current situation (due to battle damage, or a change in mission), subtract
1 from the tactics points instead of halving, but do not reduce the total
below 1.

Example: A large group of merchant vessels (No CIC, Tac=0) is being escorted
by an obsolesent destroyer (CIC, Tac=2).  However, the destroyer was
designed for fleet operations, and does not have the CIC facilities to act
as a flagship for a large squadron.  The warship is in overall command, and
the tactical pool has 2 points in it.  Tactical point usage by the warship
is normal, but tactical points used by the merchants are reduced by 1, so
that 1 or 2 tactical points creates a DM of +1.


Computer Viruses and Other Sillyness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just to get some background information on the proposed computer virus for
NeoTraveller, I asked some computer scientists and some published science
fiction authors.  The answers were consistent enough to be worth
mentioning.  With no exceptions, the computer scientists thought that the
whole idea was silly; no doubt about it.  One did mention that if all of
the computers were standardized (as might be the case for a government or
military) then such a virus might be a possability.  Almost all speculated
that a society that dependent on computers would have some kinds of
safeguards in place to prevent just such an occurrence.  Of the science
fiction writers, both thought that the idea sounded a little far-fetched,
but admitted that they might use it in a story anyway.

On the other hand, I finally found out where GDW swiped the idea from; does
the following description sound more than a little bit familliar?

	The Plague - Central to the action of all three scenarios
	is the electronic plague that struck the world on February
	14, 2035.  The original nanovirus was introduced into a
	Mexican power supply factory on February 1st.  Power supplies
	carrying the virus in time release capsules were shipped to
	other factories where they were built into millions of
	devices that were then shipped all over the world.  On the
	appointed day, the capsules broke open and the virus was
	released, spreading into the equipment it was built into,
	and then on into the Net.

	The virus went after anything with a high copper content
	(wires, microchips, batteries, magnets, etc.  feeding at the
	molecular level.  In the beginning, a device that went bad
	could be repaired, but by nightfall on the 14th the virus had
	spread into the repair equipment as well.  In a few more days
	random spread had affected some types of industrial equipment,
	but other than that, few mechanical items were directly
	involved.

To me, it sounds almost identical to the computer eating virus that we have
been told to expect in the background of TNE (Traveller - The New Era).
The above was taken from page 2 of "Supertanker of Death", which is copyright
1990 and 1991 by Eric Baker, and was published by BTRC in September 1991 as an
adevnture suppliment for their "Timelords" SF/TimeTravel RPG.  The above
quote is verbatum, and probably falls in the jurisdiction of fair use.  While
the computer eating virus idea still sounds more than a little silly to me, I
can somehow accept it better knowing that it came from the same people who
published "Macho Women with Guns" ;-)

\'NUFF SAID!

    'body' => 'In response to my letter on Jump Drives in MT, PPUGLIESE@Pima.CCPima.edu
asks about the planetoid vessel in Supplement 9, Fighting Ships.  It is
stated there that the vessel was carried aboard a Battle Tender to 
transport this monitor from one system to another.  The question:  how
did it do this?  I do not recall if the specific class of Tender is
mentioned in the article.  If it was a World Class tender (or similar
vessel) that does not fully enclose the carried vessels, I would suggest
a Lanthanum Net, similar to the one for the Jump Tug in the same supplement.
The idea for a Lanthanum implanted net is not my own (apologies to the
person who thought of this, I\'ve forgotten your name).  On the other hand,
some tenders fully enclose their carried vessels, so no problem.

As regards how to install a Lanthanum grid in a planetoid vessel in general,
I would propose keeping the same rules I stated in the previous article.
Any alternative would gamble differing from the stats stated in the
Referee\'s Manual.  As regards how physically to do this, perhaps they use
planetoids with Lanthanum in them to begin with.  I mean, how do they put
Lanthanum in Starship hulls anyhow?  In principle, one could bombard the
hull (be it planetoid or not) with a beam of ionized Lanthanum particles,
and perhaps displace the resident particles with Lanthanum.

racnke.ediku.edu wrote suggesting a Jump shuttle incorporating a Lanthanum
net (as mentioned above) instead of incorporating Lanthanum directly into
the hull of the SDB.  I also have pondered this idea.  It has the advantage
of leaving the price of the SDB unaltered.  Also, Supplement 7, Traders &
Gunboats states that docking the SDB and Jump Shuttle is a tedious process,
requiring several hours.  Surely one could deploy a Jump net in that time.
This may in fact be the Seeker Gaming Systems explain it, as they have
published the set of deckplans (in, gack, 25mm scale!) and the MT stats
both for the SDB and the Jump Shuttle (the shuttle isn\'t in the Imperial
Encylopedia).  The price of the SDB is the same as in the Imperial
Encyclopedia, and the Jump Shuttle can now do Jump-5 (whoop!) when not
mated to the SDB.  Myself, I think more along the lines of the use of
my system for the design of Battle Riders and Battle Tenders.  There is
now way I\'m going to allow several hours for my Riders to mate with my
Tenders (and in my fleet, Riders are king).  I propose the following rule.

To successfully deploy a Jump Net:
Routine, Pilot, Engineering, 15 minutes
Referee:  if exceptional failure, the Net has suffered sufficient damage to
decrease performance.  Jump -1.

and the following rule for those not using Jump Nets:

To successfully mate a Battle Rider with a Tender:
Routine, Pilot, Intelligence, 2 minutes
Referee:  if destroyed Mishap, Rider and Tender have collided.  Each vessel
suffers one critical hit.  Increase task difficulty one level and reroll to
disentagle the two vessels.

Call me biased, but this makes a Lanthanum grid more useful for battle
purposes than a Net.  I view a Net as a way of transporting things when
you are not in a combat situation.

Hans Rancke brought up the oft-raised point that Hard Times starship
construction levels seem to have plummeted more significantly
than justified.  After thinking about it a bit more, I have come
to think that perhaps we\'re not looking at the problem the right
way...

	It\'s been ~10 years since the war started.  During that time,
there\'s been a continuous "War Footing" taxation and construction
spree, which has significantly depressed the economy in general.
The US was pretty severely taxed by fighting two fronts to victory
at the same time in WW II over four years; an equivalent effort that
took ten years would have started to very, very seriously sunk the
economy.
	A depressed-in-general economy then will reduce significantly
the funds that can reasonably be spent on Navies; it\'s unreasonable
to tax the people to below the poverty line, so larger portions of the
populace can\'t be taxed at all.  The richer one\'s aren\'t as rich as
they were, either.  End result: factor of four to ten decline in
tax revenues.
	Add to that the destruction of starports and other industries
and of trade; we\'ve often heard that the glue holding the Imperium 
together was trade.  That goes away, you can\'t import cheap things
from other worlds anymore, and suddenly we\'re depressing the
economy again.  Coupled with having to rebuild critical industries
and infrastructure (few traders will stop by if you don\'t at least
have a flat stretch of concrete with a control tower and water supply...)
and whammo, another factor of four to ten reduction, added to the first
one (what was going into shipbuilding is now being spent dealing
with rebuilding things and paying more money for building things
onplanet instead of importing them).
	
	We now have a sum-total reduction of funds available of
rough order of 90+%, maybe a bit better, likely a lot worse.
The 5 billion person tech D starport B world would only be able
to support 1 trillion credit squadron now, with an annual budget
of about 100,000MCr.  Now, imagine that all the starships that were
being built went off to war for (Lucan, Dulinor, Margaret, Craig, ...)
and didn\'t come back (either still there or blown to bits).  Now,
you don\'t have to support them anymore (they\'ve abandoned you, no?)
but you have a B starport and no or few ships... you can build
nonstarships to your hearts content, and probably will, but
it\'s going to take a couple of years to get any medium sized
ones online, and in the meantime you\'re stuck with what you\'ve
scrounged up.  Add to that the difficulty of building anything
with the occational random planetary/starport bombardments,
and you\'re starting to look like a GDW Hard Times world.

	The only thing I find hard to believe about this is that
none of the hi-pop worlds could see it coming ahead of time
(which, with 10 years warning should have been patently
obvious to anyone with half a brain and a slight case of 
overcautiousness/paranoia.)  If I were, say, the chief administrator
of such a world, about halfway through the civil war I would
have started covertly building up my planetary defense forces
and kept it kill-people-to-protect-it secret.  Lots of SDB\'s
of varying sizes, at least, and likely some bigger warships (though
Spinal Mounts are hard to hide... maybe get some allocated to
fixed planetary defenses and actually install them on a starship).
By the time the war ground to an effective halt as the starships 
all died off, I\'d be sitting on top of a planet with enough 
defenses to hold off any comers, military or raider, and I\'d
try real hard to keep that edge up on everyone else.
With a little luck, I could protect my nearby neighbors in a 
little safe zone, especially the ones that send food and
raw minerals to my industries.  See if you can talk the 
MegaCorps into maintaining some transport and industrial
presence (not hard if you seem to be stable, it would seem)
and there\'s an island of stability that will last through
a long night.
	In fact, it\'s not just amazing that one world didn\'t
do that.  It\'s amazing to me that _most_ of the hi-pop worlds
didn\'t do that, or just outright rebel against all factions
on the grounds of self-preservation.  There should have
been a mass uprising in the name of Peace about seven years
or so into the Civil War, before the corner of
more or less no return was passed.  The Imperial Populace
is being portrayed as mindless sheep for the most part,
and I have a problem with that (with several trillion people,
_someone_ is going to realize this and spread the word 
successfully...).

Are they out?  Good.

Dear friends,
While we have been merrily playing with our silly vehicle
contest, we have been totally outclassed.  Completely, and
absolutely.  By Whom, do you ask?
     By the same makers as Shattered Ships of the Fighting
Imperium!  THAT\'S WHO! ARRRGH!!!  I CAN\'T believe *THIS* one!
They\'re INSANE!  God DAMN IT!  Dow was being FUNNY when he put in
a spacecraft powered by an internal combustion engine!  THESE
Jokers put out an *OFFICIAL* one!

Assignment: Vigilante
The Laruusaliin Roughneck-Class Frontier Fuel Harvester
A TL 6 interplanetary fuel scoop ship.

Basically, the ship flies into a gas giant, scoops fuel, and
returns to orbit full of propane.
She has a displacement of 200tons and weighs 2300 tons (unloaded)
Now, when in the atmosphere of the gas giant here\'s how it
operates:  Uses fuel scoops to pick up hydrogen in order to fill
a large parawing/gas balloon.  It then travels around in the
atmosphere going through regions of the gas giant picking up
propane and other hydrocarbons from the atmosphere.

Ok, Now, the gas envelope is NOT RIGID.  It is a few times the
size of the Hindenburg and it is NOT RIGID.  Any guesses how long
such a blimp will last in the turbulent atmosphere of a GAS
GIANT?  You know, the same gas giant\'s that tear your Armor=40
ship to shreds sometimes?  Damn!  The TL 6 airships *I* know of
got torn to pieces in the atmosphere of EARTH!  Nevermind
something like JUPITER or SATURN!  God Bless it!  How do they
think this thing is gonna hold together!???

Right, now that you get the picture of how last these things are
gonna last, think about this one:  These ships cost 103 Million
Credits a piece.  Per trip they get 650 kiloliters of propane.
How many trips will it take for this thing to pay for itself?
637 trips (assuming 250Cr per kiloliter of propane)  Nearly 2
years of daily operations.  Any bets on if it is gonna survive
that long?

Ok, all these arguments are pretty damning, but as I said before,
it is powered by an *INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE*  WHERE does it
get the AIR to BREATHE?  In vaccum?  Well, you could say it is
using it\'s high performance rockets to keep it powered up at that
point.  (They last 20 minutes) In the gas giant?  Well, how much
oxygen do you get there?  Not a whole lot!  WHAT THE HELL DID
THEY THINK THEY WERE DOING?!?!  There are no batteries listed, it
has to have some power plant churning away at all times.  So
WHERE is the AIR coming from?  Dow\'s design had the sence to
include Liquid Oxygen for his silly design.  Nobody though of
that here!

Calm, calm, Calm.  Right.  Now what is the point of this ship?
Well it is supposed to give a low tech planet space capability so
that it can get the resources from a gas giant.
HOWEVER!  In order to get the fuel back to the planet that needs
it, they need to have an X boat tender standing by.  Remember the
old TL 15 x-boat tender?  Well, Gee... If you\'ve got one of THOSE
lying around, what the hell do you need a bunch of unreliable,
very expensive, and difficult to build TL 6 ships for?

Did common sence go on a holiday?  JESUS CHRIST!  What\'s next? 
TL 3 steam powered starships?

On TOP of that stupidity, GDW totally FAILED to put Rob Dean\'s
name in AGAIN!   DAMN IT!  It\'s not like it\'s hard to SPELL!
I don\'t like this.  I don\'t like this one little bit.  Rob did
almost all the GOOD designs in Assignment Vigilante.  But I
understand this is not Chuck Gannon\'s fault.  At least he showed
good taste in choosing Rob\'s designs.  I don\'t know if he is
responsible for the Roughneck, though.  I KNOW it can\'t be Rob\'s.

You can let the kids back in now...

IMPERIAL LINES

Also included in the pack was a copy of Imperial Lines.  An 8
page newsletter.  Not bad over all.  Not a whole lot of
substance.  The largest article in there is on Foreven Sector.
(the one adjacent to the spinward Marches.)  For those of you who
don\'t know, this is The Iakr sector that the story I\'ve been
putting out has been set in.  It is an interesting article in
that all they provide you with is a map.  No planetary data, no
notes on the governments there.  No list of UPPs.  Nothing.  They
apparantly decided that it is one sector which is going to be
left up to the individual Refs.  They did give you a few planets
stats that had been published previously, (but they forgot a few
others that had been established in Foreven)  (sigh)  So, the
article as a whole doesn\'t help a whole lot.  All you really get
is a sector map with some dots on it.
(There is a cryptic hint about strange goings on in the Zho
Consulate)

There is also an article on reducing starship fuel requirements. 
Not bad, I\'ve been thinking of writing that one up myself. 
Essentually, they discuss powering down your fusion plant during
jump.  Other than that, we\'ve heard it all before.

Also included are the stats and skills for various Harrison Ford
movie characters.

There is also a short adventure/amberzone/76 Patrons type thingy
that they harken back to Lee\'s Guide to Interstellar Adventure
Vol 1.  (I guess they were looking for something to make the old
collectors sit up and take notice)  This one is pretty silly, but
not hilariously so.

Over all Imperial Lines looks like it could be a good newsletter
assuming it keeps going.  HOWEVER:  take a look at the
subscription rate.  $8 per year.  Now, that\'s a little more than
HALF the cost of Challenge per year.  For that you get *4* 8 page
newsletters as opposed to 12 issues Challenge.  Good buy! No WAY!
Come ON!  The articles are DECENT, but $2 for 8 black and white
pages?  Are we really THAT desparate?

(sigh)  I am.  I guess, I\'ll be a sucker and shell out my money. 
Especially since someone said they might do something on the
Zhos.  But I doubt that this one will sell much.  I\'ll just keep
my fingers crossed and hope that the quality stays at a decent
level.  If it decends, I won\'t be buying.

Very true. On the other hand, the 500 Cr per citizen figure represents
peacetime spending (something like 1-2 % of GNP, I think?) Wartime
spending in England in WW II approached 40% (I\'ve been told; this may
be completely untrue). \'Striker\' mentions 15% as the maximum. Still,
I agree that it would be reasonable to reduce Naval spending due to
depressed economy. But how much?

There\'s a lot of difference between survivable poverty and endurable
poverty. In peacetime people will demand a lot more than they will
make do with in wartime. And the 500 Cr per citizen figure is peace-
time spending, remember?

The squadron they do maintain is worth a little over 8 billion (Most of it
in non-starships). That\'s less than 1% of the trillion credit you mention.

The point is that to deal with the menaces of Indro the Lightless and the
other terrible reaver bands that apparently plague the worlds of Hard Times
a world would need perhaps 100 fighters. Now take your Starport B, TL D,
population 5 billion world and strip it of it\'s defenses down to the last
SDB. Furthermore assume that not the least little lost squadron of warships
will accept service with this world in return for maintenance and fat
salaries (incredible, but let\'s assume it). This world will have to
bootstrap itself.

The world still have its naval yards (That\'s what makes it Class B, after
all). Capacity is 5 million ton. Reduce that by 90% to account for bombardment
damage. Capacity 500.000 T. Now tax every citizen 5 Cr (that\'s 1% of peacetime
spending. You\'ll agree that they should be able to afford that?). That\'s 25
billion Credit. Now start building 100 fighters. Of course you have a standard
model ready, but let\'s just assume for the sake of argument that you don\'t.
I\'ll use Termagant Fighters (20 T, price MCr 31.33) for the example. Tonnage:
2000. Assign double yard capacity and pay 60% overtime, and you\'ll have your
100 fighters in 12 weeks at a cost of 5 billion credits, leaving you 20
billion credits for other projects. The next batch of fighters will cost 3,1
billion credits, or 2,5 billion if you\'re willing to wait an extra 10 days to
get them.

Now decide you want to help your neighbouring planets and your own trade.
You can build jump 100 T shuttles capable of moving your standard fighters
in 40 weeks (20 if you\'re busy). I don\'t have a design for one, but they
can\'t cost much more than a Free Trader (in fact, you can use Free Traders
to move them). Yes, let\'s make the jump shuttles 200 T, capable of carrying
4 fighters each. It\'ll take 8 (or 4) weeks longer to build them, but what
the hey... You can build 25 of them for less than a billion Cr. Let\'s see,
what\'s left? A shipyard capacity of 491.000 T and a budget of 16,5 billion
unspent. 400 more fighters and the Unity of Promise can protect each of
the 5 other planets in the Unity. That leaves 6,5 billion for ambitious stuff
like converting type M liners into fighting ships. You can afford to build
(not support, BUILD) 11 of these the first year. I think you have to put
in a new power plant, so this will take 18 weeks if you don\'t want to spend
money on speeding up work. Shipyard capacity is no problem (it could have
been reduced by 99% and still be plenty. Heck, you can build these fighters
in any car factory on the world, though tooling up may take a while. But
even monthly pirate raids will not keep these fighters unbuilt for long),
so you can make them all concurrently.

Now let\'s look at next year\'s budget: Fleet consists of 600 20 Fighters
(BCr 15,04*), 25 Jump Shuttles (BCr 0,8*) and 11 _Vigilantes_ (BCr 6,68).
(Actually you\'d have a mix of different types, which is why I don\'t give
class discount for these.)

*: 20% class discount included. The first batch may have cost more, but
   they\'re just as easy to maintain.

Total value BCr 22.52. Maintenance: BCr 2,25, leaving you with BCr 22,75
to spend on other projects. Perhaps we can lay down a couple of 1000 T
Destroyers... And of course more fighters to protect more of your neigh-
bouring planets, expanding your protective umbrella further and further out.

In the meantime trade is beginning to revive. Next year\'s budget will
be bigger.

>Add to that the difficulty of building anything
>with the occational random planetary/starport bombardments,

Who\'s performing these bombardments? Anyone strong enough to do so is
strong enough to protect his own merchants. To desrtoy this light in
the Long Night you have to introduce another.

> [Anyone with an ounce of brains could predict and avoid this. ]

I agree. And even if noone did, lots of these planets can bootstrap
their fleet and trade in less than a year.

The problem here is that the figures in TCS only concerns themselves with
building and maintaining naval ships. Merchant traffic is not touched at
all. We\'ve no way to estimate civilian traffic (unless you count the ship
encounter tables ;-). Based purely on a fantasy game sourcebook I use a
figure of 2 tons of merchant shipping per ton of military shipping. This
could be miles off.

I think this is the place to present my fix for reducing the size of the
Navy of interstellar powers:

Argument: The more people a society consists of, the higher the proportion of
non-contributing members. By contributing members I mean anyone in a primary
or secondary occupation. I don\'t mean to imply that people in tertiary occu-
pations dosen\'t work, but they all live one way or another on whatever wealth
the primary and secondary occupations creates. The amount of money that a
planet can afford [1] to spend on naval forces is therefor modified by a
factor that depends on the size of the population:

    Factor = 1/(2 to the power of (8 - log (population))).

This factor is 1 for a population of 100 million, 1/2 for one of 1 billion
and 1/4 for one of 10 billion. It will be 2 for a population of 10 million
and go on doubling every time the population level goes down by one.
(Obviously there is a limit to this. I suggest that we ignore any world with
a population less than 100.000. Such will tend to be colonies and outposts
and thus go on the parent planet\'s budget anyway.)

[1] Actually "are willing to spend". This is what the government can get
    their taxpayers to pony up with without them growing resentful. And
    we\'re talking peacetime. In wartime all bets are off. A society will
    willingly spend much more than they can afford in such circumstances,
    witness how WWII more or less ruined Britain even though they won.

In a interstellar society all planets will want the other planets to pay
proportionally the same as themselves, so the budget must be tuned to the
ones who can pay the least per citizen. We ignore the possibility that the
interstellar government will force the minorities to pay disproportionally
much. Certainly the Imperium could do so, but that will just add extra
complications to the calculations. The high-population worlds contribute
most to the Naval budget, and it\'s them we reduce most in capacity to
contribute. So (using TCS figures) Planet Big, with population 1 billion,
can\'t pay more than 250 Cr/citizen. 30% of this goes to the federation,
so Planet Big pays 75 Cr/citizen to the federation fleet. They retain
175 Cr/citizen for their own planetary defenses. Planet Medium, with
population 100 million, can afford to use 500 Cr/citizen, but they still
only pay 75 Cr/citizen to the federation. (Incidentally, they don\'t _need_
to use all the 425 Cr left over on planetary defenses. If they\'re near an
unfriendly border they propably will, if they feel secure they may give
their citizens a tax break (or waste it on other things)).

Note that if you multiply the population by 10 you multiply the naval
budget by 5, so a high-pop world will still be considerably stronger
than a low-pop world.

I don\'t know the population of the most populous planet in the Imperium,
but assuming it\'s 50 billion, the Imperial tax will come to 30% of Cr 77

credit) per citizen (this means that a low tech planet will get screwed out
of quite a lot more than 30% of their military budget, but who listens to
the complaints of low tech planets anyway?)

It has been changed. It has been made a lot more vague. Look at page 61 of
_Referee\'s Manual_. Ships under 60.000 kiloliters (4444,44 T) takes 36
months. Ships of more than that takes \'from 24 to 60 months based on
conditions, volume of orders, and the degree of haste desired by the
ordering government\'. Class ships takes 80% of the time.

Incidentally, I just noticed a sentence on the same page: \'A shipyard
navy may construct ships on its planet using local resources, even if
a shipyard is not present\'.

RACCOONIDS
_or_ The Importance of Fish in Government

In 612, imperial scouts mapping in the newly established Domain of
Deneb discovered the Raccoonid Race on Dentus (2201 C979500-A) in the
Regina Subsector.  The scout service named the new minor alien race
after a species of mammal common throughout solomani space.

Raccoonid Physiology

Raccoonids range between 0.8 and 1.6 meters in height, though a
raccoonid over 1.3 meters is rare.  They weight between 30 and 50
kilos.  They are capable of bipedal or quadrupedal motion, depending
on what\'s convenient under the circumstances.  They are plantigrade
like humans, not digitigrade like Vargr or Aslani. Both feet and hands
have non-retractable claws, enabling them to climb almost anything
including porous masonry. In appearance, they look like overgrown
solomani "raccoons."  Their fur consists of an outer coat of guard
hair, a middle coat of water-shedding hair and a fine undercoat which
they shed seasonally.

Compared to humans, their eyesight is shifted into the infrared and is
deficient in the violets and blues.  Their hearing is very sensitive,
even exceeding that of the Vargr.  Raccoonids are omnivorous, though
they favor a protein-rich diet.  On their native planet of Dentus,
they eat primarily a diet of fish, shellfish, various domestic fowl,
roots and tubers.

Gravity on the surface of Dentus is 1.55 G\'s; as a result, raccoonids
have large bones and are surprisingly strong for their size.  Compared
to the human races, however, raccoonids are not as strong.  Dentus is
also a very tectonically active planet, with over 20 tectonic plates,
and an abundance of volcanoes.  The atmosphere of Dentus is tainted
with sulfureous and carbonaceous gases from volcanic activity.
Raccoonids have evolved respiratory aoli which are capable of
filtering these contaminants from air prior to oxygen/CO2 exchange of
the blood.  Raccoonids have an average lifespan of 60 imperial years.

The revolution of Dentus takes 27.4 hours.  Dentus is a cool planet,
since the amount of particulates in the atmosphere filter much of the
solar radiation prior to its absorbtion by the planet\'s surface.  30%
of the planet\'s surface is glaciated.  Raccoonids live on the northern
half of one of the two large land masses, in a narrow strip of
temperate zone south of the northern ice sheet.  There are slightly
less than 1,000,000 raccoonids living on Dentus.  The few who leave
the planet have usually been recruited into the imperial scouts.

Raccoonid Psionics

All raccoonids are clairvoyant to some degree.  Their clairvoyance is
a trait that probably evolved in response to detecting predators.
Some very few raccoonids are also pre-cognizant.  Imperial researchers
have failed to identify the psionic abilities of raccoonids, due to
ignorance of xenopsionics, and also to the general imperial bias
against psionics.

Imperial researchers have mis-attributed raccoonid clairvoyance/pre-
cognizance to the greater sensitivity of raccoonid hearing, touch, and
sense of smell.

Raccoonid Origins And Anthropology

Imperial researchers are divided on the possible origins of the 
raccoonid race.  Due to their truly remarkable resemblance to the 
raccoons found in solomani space, many genetic anthropologists have 
argued that raccoonids are an engineered race, like the Vargr.  Other 
researchers have argued that racoon-like creatures have evolved 
independently in many different places in the galaxy, and that the 
raccoonids are merely the most evolved of a common mammal-type.   A 
large, probably ursoid, predator is a common theme in raccoonid 
folklore, which the evolutionists argue was a catalyst for raccoonids 
to evolve into a truly sentient race.

It is extremely unfortunate for researchers involved in raccoonid
studies that there is no raccoonid archeological record.  Raccoonids
scavenge and recycle everything, thus leaving no recognizable
archeological artifacts.  In addition, prior to discovery by the
imperium, raccoonids had no written nor oral history.  The raccoonids,
however, did (and still do) have a large onus of oral tradition and
folklore, dictating their form of very loose government and social
behavior.  The argument over the origins of the raccoonids will
probably never be solved, since there is no evidence which clearly
supports either academic position.  Raccoonids themselves find the
whole controversy rather trivial, very amusing and "so terribly
human."

Raccoonid Society And Culture

Compared to humans or aslani, raccoonids have a poorly developed sense
of property.  Land is not something that can be owned.  Other objects,
like houses, tools, and art are "owned" by whoever is using them at
the moment.  If an object is left alone for even a small amount to
time, it may be appropriated by some other raccoonid.  Many of the
debates of raccoonid "fishflings" revolve around the ownership of some
tool which the "prior" owner put down for only a minute so he could
fetch his lunch...

When the imperial scouts first logged the initial survey results on
the raccoonid race, they reported that there was no legal system or
government among the raccoonids.  They were wrong.  Due to the scouts\'
incomplete understanding of raccoonid language (which sounds like
percussive purrs, clicks, and chitters to other races), the scouts
missed that the raccoonids conduct a loose form of representative
government.  Raccoonids have no word for government, but they do have
a word for their local community meeting, though it has eluded
translation.  For convenience, imperial researchers have nicknamed the
local community meeting as "the fishfling."

Every raccoonid community, never larger than a few hundred raccoonids,
has it\'s local "fishfling."  The fishfling is a meeting in which every
adult raccoonid has a vote and the right to speak.  The fishfling is
conducted by semi-professional "jurists," who set up the meeting
place, recognize speakers, keep order, tally votes, and sweep up the
considerable mess afterwards.  The business of the fishfling is
anything considered appropriate according to tradition, and many human
researchers have voiced the opinion that raccoonid tradition is
remarkable fluid (though raccoonids will vocally refute that
position).  The best that can be said about fishflings is that they
are boisterous.  Raccoonids will bring a pail of small fish to snack
on during a fishfling, saving the fish carcasses to throw at speakers
they disagree with.  Observers have noticed that favorable motions in
the fishfling produce very few flung fish, and that unpopular motions
bring a veritable downpour of fish.

Pre-imperial raccoonid culture was TL1. Prior to discovery by the
imperium, the raccoonids pursued a simple life of mostly eating and
sleeping.  Most industry was geared toward food preservation, small
tool manufacture and trade.  For hobbies, raccoonids pursued various
crafts such as beadwork or wood carving.  Most entertainment took the
form of oral recitation, either of traditions or of fables.
raccoonids are very social beings and early raccoonid society was
cooperative and highly integrated.  Due to the adverse climatic
conditions, food production was a community effort in order to
maximize preserved foodstuffs for the disproportionately long winter.
(Needless to say, the necessity of community cooperation in order to
survive is one of the arguments of the evolved-sentients school of
thought among imperial researchers.)

Due to the small geographic area which raccoonids occupied, the less
than 1 million raccoonids spoke the same language (accounting for
regional dialects) and shared the same culture and oral tradition.
Local customs existed, but visitors to an area were expected to adapt
for the sake of fitting in and maintaining peace.  Aberrant or violent
raccoonids were ostracized from society, an extreme and rare
circumstance.  An ostracized raccoonid either attempted to survive
alone or moved to a new community far away to start afresh.  Very few
raccoonids have ever survived alone - the prospects for an ostracized
raccoonid were usually grim.

The Impact Of The Imperium On Raccoonid Culture

The initial reports on the planet Dentus recommended isolating it, so
as to preserve such a peaceful, idyllic, and pastoral culture.  The
scout service and subsequent imperial anthropologists discovered that
such preservation was not possible.  The raccoonids, they discovered,
were not only intelligent, but extremely curious.  A few scanners
disappeared, which caused some concern.  However, when the local
raccoonids appeared several days later, wanting to know what they did
wrong in putting it back together, concern turned into large-scale
consternation.

Despite attempts to prevent further incidents, more equipment
disappeared, and more raccoonids arrived asking pointed questions.
The situation deteriorated.  Raccoonids, lacking a basic understanding
of personal property, took whatever they wanted.  Also, it evolved
that even sophisticated security precautions were insufficient to
prevent a determined raccoonid from appropriating what he or she
wanted.  To add insult to injury, the same raccoonid would appear
usually within the week, with the appropriated article, full of
curiosity and more questions.

In 627, an imperial research vessel was disabled and almost halfway
dismantled by the locals before rescue arrived.  After this incident,
imperial authorities made an unprecedented decision; they decided that
regardless of the primitive technology of the raccoonids, raccoonids
could receive whatever technological training they desired, on the
condition that no technological devices would be introduced into
raccoonid culture by imperial citizens.  This was presented to the
raccoonids in several different locations, and through the trade
routes the imperial decision spread to all raccoonid communities.  As
a result, the amount of oral tradition governing raccoonid society
increased an estimated 50%, and by year 700, there were approximately
10,000 raccoonids in the scout service or attending imperial schools
and universities.

A trend established itself: the most adventuresome raccoonids either
joined the imperial scouts or sought schooling off-planet.  After a
period of time, these raccoonids would return to Dentus, full of ideas
and with money in the bank.  Many fish were flung as returning
raccoonids attempted to introduce new concepts into raccoonid society,
but by the year 1000, the raccoonids owned two domestic fusion power
plants, a blossoming tourist trade, and a small spaceport.
Surprisingly, the peaceful and social nature of raccoonid society has
not changed.  The structure of fishflings has evolved, however; all
fishflings are still small, but each fishfling can elect to send one
of its jurists to the regional fishfling.  The one hundred and three
regional fishflings each send a member jurist to what the raccoonids
call "the Far Fishfling," mostly due to the distance that members must
travel to attend.  The Far Fishfling makes decisions on items of
planetwide importance, like the bank account (all raccoonids share the
same bank account), inter-planetary trade, and who gets stuck with
being ambassador to the Imperium.

Raccoonids Interactions In Imperial Culture

Most imperial citizens will never have met a raccoonid.  Raccoonids
are rare, and only turn up in significant numbers in the scouts.  A
raccoonid or two may be seen on the city streets of university towns
on Regina or Mora, or downstation from scout bases.  Most imperial
humans will encounter raccoonids in the Domain of Deneb.  Due the
fracturing of the imperium, most raccoonids not within the Domain are
probably desperate to get home.

When not at work, raccoonids will either spend a lot of time looking
for good seafood restaurants, or visiting parks.  Raccoonids out
looking for seafood will either go as a group of raccoonids, or
lacking other raccoonid company, will enlist as many non-raccoonid
friends as possible.  Eating, after all, is a social event to a
raccoonid.  A solo raccoonid will be very insistent, often past the
point of human tact and patience, in finding company for a meal.

Raccoonids frequent parks, woods and forests whenever possible.
Climbing up and down trees, and playing skill games of toss are common
activities.  Raccoonids are easily annoyed by small human children who
tend to think of them as something they would like to have for pets.
Raccoonids have been seen on Regina lecturing mothers about the
manners of their children on more than one occasion.

Raccoonids are communal creatures, and have only a fuzzy concept of
personal property.  A raccoonid on a ship with a crew of various other
sentients will "borrow" an item or two occasionally, and then return
it when finished.  Raccoonids who have been in the scouts have
developed the good sense not to use the property of others, but they
will tell the casual inquirer that these proprietary instincts in
other races are absurd at best, and anti-social at worst.  Raccoonids
who have had less exposure to other cultures will have problems.  At
universities and institutions, newly arrived raccoonids are required
to live communally with more experienced raccoonids until they have
acclimated to imperial concepts of property.

Raccoonids find it difficult to communicate by speech alone; their
body language is very expressive and an integral part of their
communication.  Most of the body language (tail puffs, fur ruffling,
and ear motions) will be familiar to anyone with experience with other
races like the Vargr or Aslani.  Anyone without previous vargr,
aslani, or raccoonid experience, however, will miss a lot.

Raccoonids are very curious, more curious than even humans.
Raccoonids can get into a lot of trouble just by wondering what was on
the other side of a door or hatch, because the urge to investigate is
very strong.  The raccoonid tendency to investigate, however, is
tempered by innate raccoonid clairvoyance.  In the scouts, a raccoonid
who doesn\'t want to investigate something is usually always listened
to.

Raccoonid Character Generation

When rolling up a raccoonid character, make the following
modifications:

_Initial Character Generation_

Strength: divide 2D6 by 2, and round UP.

Dexterity: multiply 2D6 by 2, and round DOWN.

Education: 2D6.  In addition to whatever formal education a raccoonid
may pursue off of Dentus, education reflects how much of the lexicon
of oral tradition a raccoonid can recite, understand and interpret.

Social Standing: 2D6.  Social standing reflects the influence any
individual raccoonid has in his or her local community, particularly
in the local Fishfling.  Some raccoonids have been knighted for their
service in the scouts, but imperial knighting has no impact on
raccoonid social standing on Dentus.  (Rules on knighting a raccoonid
are including in the rules modifications for mustering out, below.)

Psionics: raccoonid characters must roll for psionic strength.
Raccoonids are only eligible for clairvoyance and pre-cognizance.  Use
the rules in the MT players manual for determining the strength of
these psionic skills.

_Basic Raccoonid Skills_

All raccoonids will have the following basic skills by default:

Wilderness Survival - 1
Reconnaissance - 1
Scrounger - 1
Intrusion - 1

_Skills Not Available to Raccoonids_

Energy Weapons, Equestrian, FA Gunnery, Fusion Gun, Gambling, 
Guard/Hunting Beast, Heavy Weapons, Leader, Legal, Mass Driver, Meson 
Guns, Recruiting

If you use the character generation tables from the Player\'s Manual 
then the list of prohibited/modified skills can be summarized as 
follows:

Vice: no gambling (add scrounging instead)
Guncmbt: no energy weapons
Inborn: no leader
Special Cmbt: no FA gunnery, heavy weapons, high energy weapons
Interp: no interview, no steward
No Recruiting 
Economic - no legal (add scrounging instead)
Environ - no animal handling (pack animals only), add scrounging.
Also, given a choice, no sane raccoonid will take admin as a skill.

_Raccoonid Careers_  

The following is a list of appropriate raccoonid careers.

Jurist: A raccoonid jurist can be anything from the semi-professional
administrator/clerk of the local Fishfling to an ambassador.  Off-
planet duty as a diplomat is considered a hardship.  Ambassadors,
negotiators and counsels are appointed from the membership of the Far
Fishfling by a consensus of the Far Fishfling.  Use the diplomat
character generation tables to generate Jurist raccoonids.  Note:
Jurist raccoonids are not likely to leave Dentus unless they have
sufficiently high social standing to sit in the Far Fishfling.

Scrounger: Use the Raider/Rogue generation tables.  
Scout: use the scout tables in the Player\'s Manual 
Scientist/Researcher 
Doctor 
Belter
Hunters: These characters will never leave Dentus unless by special
contract to some wealthy trophy hunter.
Merchants: These characters are not likely to go beyond Dentus\'s
spaceport.  raccoonids are not travelling merchants, and Dentus has no
fleet of merchant ships.
Artisans: Professional raccoonid artisans do not leave Dentus.
Mechanics: Usually found as repairmen at the Dentus Spaceport.  

_Character Details_

Terms of Service: 4 years per term.
Survival: similar to human.
Commissions, promotions, and successes: similar to human.
Special Duty: see Player\'s Manual.
Skills and Training: Add scrounging skill.
Reenlistment: similar to human.
Retirement: 4 terms maximum.

Mustering out and Retirement: all benefits immediately (in terms of
money or Traveller\'s Aid Memberships) or eventually (in terms of
possessions) accrue to the Planet of Dentus planetary account.
Imperial Knighthood is now a mustering out benefit from scouts only
(available on a roll of 7).  Knighthood is the only mustering out
benefit which accrues to the individual raccoonid instead of to
Raccoonids as a whole.  Knighthood does not add to a raccoonid\'s
social standing on Dentus.

_Other Details_

Names: Real Raccoonid names can\'t be translated into Galanglic.
raccoonids will take on a name that suits them for use with imperial
citizens.  The player is therefore free to give raccoonid characters
whatever names seem fitting.

Character Titles: "Elder, youngster, cousin, friend."  Raccoonid 
society has no social hierarchy.

Aging and anagathics: raccoonids don\'t use anagathics.  The use of 
anagathics is anti-social behavior and punishable by ostracism.

Raccoonid Archetypes: the clever raccoonid, the raccoonid who works 
for the communal good, the raccoonid who takes in the less fortunate.

Raccoonid Clothing: Raccoonids dislike clothes, and will habitually
wear nothing.  For formal occassions involving other races, they well
wear handmade vests, elaborately embroidered and beaded in bright
colors.

Raccoonid Proverbs (of which there are thousands!):

"Many good ideas have flung many fish."
This proverb underscores the raccoonid process of argument towards a
community consensus.  The concept of an individual taking action as an
agitator or leader in a community is unknown to raccoonids.

"A tale without an audience is lonely."
This proverb shows the very social nature of raccoonid culture.  
Raccoonids hate to be alone, and will search out company at every 
opportunity.  This is also used between raccoonids as a veiled insult, 
when one raccoonid accuses another of hoarding some desired object or 
foodstuffs, instead of sharing it when it was needed.

Miscellaneous: 
Raccoonids are not innately aggressive, but will also have no problems
defending themselves.  Raccoonids are great "team- players."
Raccoonids are not martial - you will not find a raccoonid in the
army, navy or any other armed force.  Raccoonids speaking galanglic
are occasionally difficult to understand, and the "l" sound is almost
impossible for them to articulate.  Raccoonids are naturals at
breaking and entering, and they can dismantle almost anything.  (Many
unfortunate raccoonids died when the scouts first landed on Dentus,
because they didn\'t know enough yet to distinguish between harmless
appliances and high voltage power supplies, for example...)

Raccoonids have no word in their language for dignity, and usually
fail to recognise it in other races.  Also, they have none themselves
- - dignity and decorum are not concepts they can assimilate.  "You can
dress them up, but you can\'t take them out to dinner" applies to the 
racoonid race.

Scout Base: The Imperial Scout Service has a base/recruiting station
on Dentus.  In the shattered imperium, the Domain of Deneb has elected
to keep the scout base on Dentus open.

Players\' Notes: raccoonids are not funny little people in fuzzy suits.
Players may think, in fact some imperial citizens may think that
raccoonids are very silly.  Raccoonid behavior toward property, and
the raccoonid inability to take rank seriously is commonly
misinterpreted as childish or foolish by human standards.  Raccoonids
themselves actually take matters of social consensus, social equality,
and shared property very seriously, and think that alien attitudes on
these matters are the root of most of the disagreement in the universe
(Raccoonids are probably right...).

               - XXIX -
     The High Consular Hotel:  reservations made to nobles,
diplomats, and members of the Legion of Honor.  Posh place:
robotic servants, sophont servants, fine foods, the best luxuries
that to be had in the Consulate.  The wholeo of which represented
a gigantic show piece for visiting diplomats.  They see the
wonders of the Consulate and be eager to do business with them. 
There are more than one ways to conquer a sector.
     Jietlshaiepr sat nervously in the rented suite, "I\'ve never
had recruiting duty, but, it seems like we\'ve been looking an
awfully long time.  Shtam, you ever have to do this when you were
a factor in the merchant marine?"
     Shtam ran a hand through his hair and stretched.  "No, you
have to remember though I was working *inside* the Imperium.  We
hired our people in the Consulate and brought them to the post.
We could not trust the Imperials.  It was an interesting time
though."
     "Where in hell were you?" yawned Niedrsha.
     "Right in the heart of the mess:  on Regina."
     A small golden sphere floated into the sumptuous room.
"Excuse the intrusion," it began in a humble voice, "There are
two Vargr here to see you.  They claim to be seeking employment
with you."
     "Send \'em in." gestured Niedrsha.
     The sphere retreated.  Moments later, the main entrance to
the suite opened.
     The two stood framed in the surveying the room.  Both were
rather tall for Vargr.
     The larger of the two wore a long bright red coat emblazoned
with gold braid and ribbons.  The leader no doubt.  He strode
into the room nonchalantly taking in the entire setup in a glance
and nodded to three Zhodani.  His fur was jet black save for his
white face with white eyebrows and white hands.
     "Good evening.  My name is Kfoks:  Force Leader Taek Kfoks.
And this is my lieutenant:  Force Subleader Tuerz."  Kfoks
gestured to his companion.
     Tuerz was nearly as tall as Kfoks, but incredibly slender.
She wore a tight black body suit and skirt which showed her tall
willowy form which moved with inhuman grace as she swayed forward
as if blown by a breeze.  Her fur was flaming red-orange with a
white face and black ear tips.  Her head swung slowly around
scrutinizing the entire room.  Satisfied for the moment she stood
beside Kfoks with hands on hips thrusting her chest slightly
forward.  Her eyes continued the surveillance of the room.
     "Greetings, Force Leader Kfoks," intoned Jietlshaiepr, "I am
Jietlshaiepr, this is pilot Niedrsha and engineer Shtam."
     "You advertized for ship crew members." stated Kfoks laying
a handful of holcrystal resumes on the table.  "I\'m here to
represent five of us.  All with shipboard experience and
expertise."
     Jiet slid them into a terinal slot.  "Very good," she nodded
glancing them over.  "What types of vessels have you been on?"
     "Several types, most recently we all served on a frigate."
said Kfoks.
     "In what capacity?" asked Shtam.
     Kfoks drew a deep breath, "Three as fighter pilots, one as a
gunner and one as engineer.  Most of us have some experience as
engineers."
     "What sort of frigate was this?" wondered Shtam.
     "The Gdaekvorr:  an Urravek class frigate.  She was rather
on the old side though."
     Niedrsha leveled his gaze at Kfoks, "Were you in a corsair
band?"
     Tuerz swiveled around to face Niedrsha, her body moving as
though it were on a turntable.  She drew herself to her full
height.
     Kfoks smiled tightly, biting down.
     The bone transmitter sounded in Tuerz\'s skull, "No."
     "Yes, we were." nodded Kfoks.  He turned and put an arm
around Tuerz shoulder and scratched her behind the ears.  "But
that\'s over with for now.  Right now, we\'re looking for
transportation out of the Consulate, and we are more than willing
to hire on as your crew.  However, I must insist that if you
would hire one of us you must hire all.  We do not wish to be
separated."
     Tuerz barked a short laugh, "I wouldn\'t be to sure about
Stuzzel.  He wants out any way he can.   And I\'d be willing to
let him go."
     "I see," said Jietlshaiepr, brushing her hair back over her
shoulders and stretching gloriously.  "And if we can not
accommodate you?"
     Kfoks folded his arms, "Then you can\'t accommodate us."
     Shtam spoke up. "Right now we need two gunners, and three
pilots, preferably with engineering and military experience."
     Kfoks raised an white eyebrow.  "That\'s us."
     Niedrsha asked, "What corsair band were you in?"
     "The Uekalez.  If that means anything to you."
     "The band broke up a few months ago." said Shtam.
     Kfoks sighed, "Well, yes and no.  We are broken up.  But we
didn\'t do it by ourselves.  We had an awful lot of help from a
group of particularly playful humans."
     "Oh?  What happened?" asked Jietlshaiepr.
     Kfoks muscles tensed, but he threw up a paw nonchalently,
and continued clamly.  "Well, we were going to sell them some
ships.  But when we delivered them, it seems that they didn\'t
fancy the idea of actually paying us for them.  Our leader took
exception to this.  Seems he rather liked money.  In any event
their ships fought our ships, our ships fought their ships...
     "But during the battle our captain decided that the better
part of valor was cowardice.  He tried to run us out of there.
Didn\'t quite make it, the jump drive was damaged.  We misjumped
far into the Consulate.  We five are the survivors,"
     "That would be from a crew of about twenty six but probably
was more than thirty." commented Shtam.
     Tuerz glanced sidelong at Shtam, "Thirty five."
     "Nice odds.  Sounds like fun." mumbled Niedrsha.
     Kfoks made a sweeping gesture with his tail, his tenseness
melted away like rain "Piece of mutton.  We were all in the
engine room.  The rest of the ship was torn apart.  We salvaged
what we could and sold her forscrap."
     "What band was this little scrap with?" wondered Niedrsha.
     "I\'m afraid I haven\'t any idea." confessed Kfoks.  "Our
leader wasn\'t the confiding type.  Had a pretty large support
system though.  Good resources."
     "What makes you say so?" asked Jietlshaiepr.
     "Their fleet.  They had several large warships.  Including
an Azhanti High Lightning class cruiser, a tender in the forty
thousand ton range that looked an awful lot like the Star Rider
which was destroyed, a few Zhodani and Sword Worlds ships in the
destroyer range:  two and three thousand tons, a Kinunir class
battle cruiser, and a host of other smaller ships and escorts."
     Jietlshaiepr exchanged glances with Niedrsha.  The muscles
in Shtam\'s jaw tightened.
     Kfoks paused and ran his claws through the fur on his head.
"A fleet like that needs a lot of supporting equipment and bases.
They must have a government subsidizing them."
     "The odd thing about the battle," he continued, "was that
while those ships were there, they didn\'t take much of an active
part in the battle.  They stayed off at extreme range and sent in
fighters.  And the fighters!  They sent Shtelfires and
Shorichans!  They haven\'t been used since the third frontier war
one hundred years ago.  And they were completely obsolete then."
     Shtam frowned.  "Well," he objected, "the Shtelfire was one
of the best fighters ever built, an excellent design for tech
level twelve.  I restored one once for a museum.  The battle of
Farreach over in Jewell subsector was fought and won by young
Zhodani\'s in Shtelfires.  And unless I\'m mistaken they were used
in the fourth frontier war by Consular client states."
     Kfoks shook his head, "That was twenty years ago.  Those
states have newer cast offs from the Consulate now."
     "Nevertheless," continued Shtam, "the Shtelfire was one of
the best fighters ever built.  They\'re collector\'s items now.
Highly effective in combat."
     "I agree," sighed Kfoks wryly, "I can testify to their
effectiveness in combat personally."
     Jietlshapier sighed impatiently "Where exactly did you see
the Kinunir class battle cruiser?"
     "Zylath, down in Jungleblut subsector."
     Niedrsha considered it, "That\'s in the Domain of Alntzar."
     "That\'s right."
     Jietlshaiepr exchanged glances with Niedrsha and Shtam each
nodded in turn.  "Would you care to show us exactly where?" she
asked.
               - XXX -
     Warning lights and sirens announced the approaching tilly.
Like a metal tyrannosaurus, it lumbered up the ramp to the
Flamboyant\'s cargo hold.  Its motors whined as its piston legs
crested the cargo ramp.  It carried the crates of arms the vargr
had managed to salvage from the wreck of the frigate,
approximately one hundred and fifty kilos.
     The armored face plate of the modified cargo carrier went
down and Stuzzel poked his light brown muzzle out.  "Hey, uh,
Sitlshaper, where do you want this equipment?"
     Tuerz shook his head in disgust.  He had gotten rid of the
skirt and his fur was pure white to match his tight body suit.
The lack of breasts made his slender frame look even more frail
than before.  "Look you oaf, her name is Jietlshaiepr, and if
you\'d use your head once in a while instead of getting out of
practice with it, you\'d realize that the guns just might be
something we may need access to in a hurry.  Don\'t bury it in the
back of the hold."
     "Grrrach!  Shut up, Snow White!  Just cause you won\'t soil
your lily white hands..."
     Tuerz stroked the handle of his laser pistol.
     Jietlshaiepr interrupted, "Over on the left side of the
hold, next to the food supplies." she ordered.
     "Blast these two!" she thought angrily, "If they keep
arguing I\'ll kill them both!  Twice!"
     Shtam watched as the tillys were used to load the
Flamboyant.  "Kfoks, how much can those things carry?"
     "The tillys?  I\'m afraid it depends on how experienced the
operator inside is.  I believe the record was something like nine
hundred and eleven kilograms.  I can manage six hundred fairly
easily.  They were cargo carriers originally.  A friend of mine
modified them:  fusion gun, gauss rifle, RAM auto grenade
launcher.  They make for rather fun toys.  Rackhan\'s using mine
at the moment.  We have a third, but it needs repairs before we
can operate it."
     "Maybe I can help," mused Shtam.  "I\'m pretty good with
machines."
     Kfoks shook his head.  "I\'m afraid we need a robotics expert
Shtam.  The whole things in pieces."
     "I believe we have a robot expert."
     "Oh yes, aboard the Vixen.  Perhaps he can do it.  I want a
good look at that ship though.  I never thought I\'d see that one
again.  She may have some interesting things aboard."
     "Oh?  For instance?"
     "Navigational information in the computer.  If you\'re right
about the Uekalez being completely broken up then perhaps we can
use ransack some of our emergency supply bases."
     "Good stuff?"
     Kfoks grinned "A start.  With it I can build up my empire."
     "Yes... I think I understand the vargr empire, it looks as
though you have a small start:  four followers."
     Kfoks looked Shtam straight in the eye. "That will build.
As I said, it\'s a start.  And revenge is always a good place to
get going, particularly when the object of that revenge is rich."
     "And powerful." warned Shtam.
     "That\'s where our association comes in:  we are working
towards the same end."
     "We just want the doctor back."
     "The doctor probably wants vengeance too."
     "Perhaps.  Who knows?"
     Kfoks mused a moment.  Finally he cocked his head, and
examined Shtam more closely.  "You said you restored a Shtelfire
once, did you ever get to fly one?"
     Shtam laughed, "No, unfortunately not.  The museum would
barely let me warm up the engines."
     "What museum?"
     "Oh, actually it\'s in the Imperium:  Regina.  I was a factor
there, and I helped them fix it up.  They didn\'t like the idea of
a Zhodani taking up a Zhodani built fighter over their sector
capital even if it was not armed."
     "Wait a minute, was that the Imperial war museum?"
     "Yes."
     Kfoks nodded, "I\'ve seen your work.  Good job."
     "Well, I had quite some time to work on it.  The ship I was
on had some major problems.  We had to order parts all the way
from the Consulate."
     "The Imperials didn\'t have the parts?"
     Shtam rolled his eyes.  "No.  But the company would not
allow us to use Imperial parts.  So we waited nine months to get
our requisition through for a Lanathnum drive core.  When it
arrived they had sent the wrong piece.  I tried to modify it, but
in the end it wouldn\'t charge properly.  I couldn\'t certify the
ship for jump, so we waited another three months.  We finally got
out."
     Kfoks eyed him intently.  "What did you think of the
Imperium?"
     "A very suspicious people.  They did not trust me very far.
Of course, I did not trust them either.  But it gave me a chance
to polish up my knowledge of ships.  Once I finished the
Shtelfire, I was allowed to work on other ships for the museum:
Rampart 128\'s.  Neat ships."
     "Yeah.  I like the newer Rampart IV\'s and V\'s though."
     "Yes, I prefer Zhodani models though, Kia class..."
     "Did you ever see the Imperial Aerobatics team?  The Blue
Angels?"
     "Once, they were flying modified Cobras.  Quite impressive."
     "They are using Viper 15-S\'s now.  And their flight leader
was one of the strangest looking beings I\'ve ever seen:  an Ael
Yael or something.  It had wings.  I heard it was a female.  I\'d
guess those things make pretty good pilots."
     "Yes, well if you or I had instincts for the air we would
too.  She was leader when I saw them.  The name was Kittan
Kboutle or something."
               - XXXI -
     "Vrrrrrrsh!" grumbled Stuzzel producing a reverberating echo
in the Flamboyant\'s officer lounge.  "Jump space is the most
boring krglish I\'ve ever been in.  I think I might crawl in a low
berth and sleep through it."  The ponderous weight of the vargr
flowed and bounced as he shifted in his chair.  He yawned and
belched loudly and tossed away the dogeared magazine in a flurry
of colored pages.
     Jietlshaiepr could not read the cover of the magazine when
it fluttered to the deck, her Gveg was limited and the idiom of
the title made little sense when directly translated.  "Fragrant
White Wag" told little, the picture on the cover filled the rest:
a scantily clad young female vargr, seen from behind, perched on
top of a grav-bike.
     Her eyes rolled.  "Stupid barbarian", she thought and turned
in disgust.
     A stinging slap ripped across her backside.  She swung round
furious.
     "You\'re pretty good, even if ya aien\'t got no tail." laughed
Stuzzel.
     Jietlshaiepr leveled her gaze on him.  Slowly, deliberately
she took hold of his collar and lifted the obese vargr to within
a few millimeters from the ceiling.  "And your pretty disgusting
mister, tail not withstanding.  I may put you in one of the low
berths anyway."  She lowered him half a meter and dropped him.
     Niedrsha looked on warily.  "Jiet will teach \'em who\'s boss
around here soon." he thought.  He nodded to Jietlshaiepr and
spoke:  "Look Stuzz, we\'ve got eight jumps to make before we get
to Zylath.  I think you\'d better lay off a bit if you want to get
there."
     Stuzzel snorted, "*Why* should I want to get there?  That\'s
where we got trounced by the stupid human pirates."
     Kfoks ears shifted in annoyance and he looked up from a book
of gveg poetry.  "That IS the point, Mr. Stuzzel.  They probably
have a base there.  It\'s our opportunity to do a little
reconnaissance on them."
     "*Stuff* recon!" he snorted.  "I learned plenty about \'em."
     "Just what did you learn, Stuzzel?" inquired Shtam.
     "\'Nough to know I don\'t want to fuck wif \'em!  They wiped
out our whole fuckin\' fleet!  What good are we gonna do in one
escort even if we got a Vixen around?"
     "Reconnaissance, you vragh brained clod," explained Tuerz as
he flowed into the lounge gracefully, "is not a stand up fight.
Of course the idea of subterfuge might not occur to someone whose
idea of subtlety is a ton of high explosive."  He carried a large
thick plastic plack peppered with small holes and several nails
protruding.
     He wore a blue female outfit with his visible fur dyed
cream.  At his hip swung his prize possession:  an integral laser
pistol.  He had relieved it from an Imperial merchant with more
money than marksmanship.  The pistol itself was beautiful:
iridium plated with inlaid rubies and ivory.  The merchant had
paid a great deal for it:  eight guards and his own life. Tuerz
thought it a crime for such a weapon to be in the hands of
someone who could barely use it.  A blind vargr might value a
Dali, but he could never appreciate it as could one with sight.
     He twirled a small body pistol, "Would you all mind if I set
up a bit of target practice?  I\'ve been getting soft on my
practice sessions, and if I let it go much longer I\'ll be as bad
a shot as Stuzzel is with a fusion gun."
     Stuzzel snorted indignantly.
     "In here?" asked Jietlshaiepr skeptically.
     "This is the longest room on the ship.  I can stand on the
bridge and shoot at this target."
     Kfoks waved his book at Jietlshaiepr, "Don\'t worry
Commander.  Tuerz won\'t damage anything.  He can nail a fly at
ten meters.  Here..."  Kfoks rose and placed a melon on his own
head to step in front of the target board.  "From the hip,
Tuerz."
     The pistol continued to gyrate in Tuerz paw for a moment as
Jietlshaiepr started to object.
     The body pistol barked.  A wisp of smoke issued from the
barrel.
     Kfoks pulled the melon from the crown of his head.  A neat
hole drilled precisely in the center.
     He showed it to Jietlshaiepr and then took a bite of it.
     "Very well.  Go ahead." she sighed.  "But, no more shots
like that.  I don\'t feel like taking the time to study vargr
cranial anatomy just to dig out slugs."
     "Can I try that one on you Tuerz?" laughed Stuzzel.
     "Shut up or I\'ll put a hole in your head to equalize the
vacuum." snarled Tuerz.
     For emphasis Tuerz swung around to face the target board.
Suddenly, his chest exploded.  A nail was driven into the board
with deadly accuracy.
     Tuerz turned back while a small wisp of smoke issued from
the false breasts in his disguise.
     "Nice shot." called Niedrsha.
     Jietlshaiepr sighed, "Would you *Mind* using a silencer?"
               - XXXII -

     Kfoks surveyed the Vixen\'s deck.  All in order.  She had
gone through a lot before they tried to sell her.  Stressed out
bulkheads patched with whatever metal scraps that came to hand.
She was in sorry shape yes, but she could fight at least one more
battle.  After all she had only been designed to go into one
battle, she had exceeded that along time ago.
     Tuerz slipped through the airlock in female dress.  His fur
was dyed bright red to match the dress he wore.
     "Hello there."
     Kfoks turned, Tuerz whirled.  A vargr woman stood appraising
them from a corridor.  She was strongly built and very
attractive.  The lighting shone off the orange and tan of her fur
as she stood with her tail at attention with just a hint of a
slight wag.
     Kfoks own tail twitched involuntarily.  "Good evening.  My
name is Kfoks, Force Leader Taek Kfoks."  He took her hand.  "You
must be Gresha.  This is my lieutenant:  Force Subleader Tuerz."
     "Just your lieutenant, Force Leader Kfoks?" asked Gresha
nodding to the feminine Tuerz.
     "Just."
     Gresha stepped forward and ran a paw over the flowing
synsilk of his uniform.  "You were in the Uekalez weren\'t you?"
     "Yes we were.  But that\'s a long story, and where are you
from, First Lieutenant Gresha?"
     "All over, I was in several corsair bands at different
points.  Some of them got old pretty quickly.  I switched around
a lot.  I get bored without the proper attention."
     Miakr watched Kfoks and Gresha for a moment as they stood
closely, then loudly stepped into the room sighing inwardly. 
"Well, she was too blasted pushy anyway..."
          - XXXIII -
     "Well what do you think kid?  Can you do it?" Kfoks studied
Miakr\'s face trying to read the unfamiliar human expressions
crossing it.
     Miakr looked back and forth from the designs to the bulk of
the disassembled Tilly.  "Well, it\'s quite a job.  It\'ll take
some time.  You\'ve got the parts, but as for labor, if you were
to get this repaired professionally, I\'d guess the labor alone
would be about one hundred and thirty five thousand."
     Kfoks\'s tail dropped.  "You\'ll get it."
     "Do you have it?"
     Kfoks paused.  "Not yet, but soon."
     "You might not have to pay in cash." Miakr confided softly.
     This human may be more shrewd than he acts.  "What exactly
are you after?"
     "Nothing specific... yet.  But you will certainly owe me a
favor."
     "Payment like that," thought Kfoks, "is usually more
expensive than the cash."

And merchant ships also count on spending several days of each jump in
orbit or on the ground, so you can get away with even less maneuver fuel.
One thing: The text of the article says that you can power a power-plant
partway down, but the examples implies that you need three different

Hans and I are basically arguing over what happens as the Civil War
tapers off into the Hard Times and the new night.  My opinion is that
due to continuing action by the main combatants in the wars (Lucan
vs. Dulinor for the most part) the planets won\'t have an opportunity
to get their feet underneath them.  Given that from all appearances
most of the factions were still fighting (with what they had available)
as late as the end of Hard Times\'s timeline, and that they have large
safe areas to provide continuing materiel for the wars, I doubt that
worlds in war zones will ever really be able to get back on their
feet.
	The central argument isn\'t over wether GDW is right or wrong.
I agree that they\'re being silly expecting us to believe that 5 billion
people can\'t pay 1Cr each for a couple of starships for local defense.
What I do believe is that it\'s likely that the situation of devastatedw
war zones following the civil war is likely, that it will result in
massive disruption and loss of space capability, and that recovery
will not start until the wars are more over than they are now.
Tens of subsectors of "black war" areas are not going to recover on
their own; you can\'t rebuild high tech civilization locally if it\'s
been obliterated.  I don\'t think that recovery will be all that fast
in the other damaged areas, either.  And it hasn\'t started yet.

>Read the rest of my article. I\'m talking about recovery. \'Hard Times\'
>states that the Black War is over, ground to a halt through exhaustion.

	There seems to be some confusion about when the black wars end and
the recovery (or long night, in the other direction) begins.  My reading
of Hard Times indicates that as of the end of it\'s timeframe, Dulinor
and Lucan were still shooting at each other as energetically as they could
keep doing sustainably.  The "recovery" won\'t start until they stop
drafting everyone/taxing everyone/pressing starships into service to
support the war.

The central area fighting was between two closely matched opponents
for most of the war.  This explains where all the merchants went
(destroyed).  I didn\'t say that it applied once the war stops (if it
does).

Ok, you\'ve built system defense forces.  Congratulations; Lucan\'s commander
on site says "Hey, Neat, A bunch of SDB\'s I can Use!" and they\'re his now.
Don\'t think it will happen?  It\'s alluded to several times in Hard Times
and various Challenge articles.  Great way to keep the local system
defense forces down.

Over ten years, with safe home areas and a large central disputed

I have.  The analogy is really quite poor; the sea is a continum, whereas
deep space with jump capable starships is discrete.  Worse, it\'s
difficult to sail past an enemy and miss him, but easy to jump
past him as he\'s going to where you came from...  If I want to
push past an enemy force, it\'s trivially easy.  I\'ve done a bunch of 
game simulations with this; I never was stopped (and never was able
to stop) penetrations of rear areas unless there was favorable
terrain.  Doing so while simultaneously protecting your own home
area is more difficult, but can be done if you get the oponnent 
thinking defensively.

That\'s great, if that world survives the onset of Hard Times, which
it looks like few really have.  If it\'s left trashed and defenseless
when the war grinds down, it\'d better get its feet under itself FAST.
And from the look of Hard Times, the war isn\'t really quite over in
the real areas of conflict.

They only have to find one hi-tech world that can and will maintain
them to threaten a quarter of a sector effectively.  Buying pirates
off by supporting them might look very good for some worlds as things
go to hell...

But that\'s what\'s happening; as the wars continue to sweep back and
forth across the frontier and outland regions, planets are alternatively
exposed to piracy and what\'s left of main-fleet actions.  Little
planets fold up and die under this; big ones get very badly stomped.
Every time you think you\'re getting ahead, Dulinor makes another
thrust into the region and your defense forces either get
blown to bits by his fleet or they get drafted by Lucan to help
stave off this latest assault...

Ok, we get some centers of recovery.  _After_ the wars grind down.
That hasn\'t happened yet, and doesn\'t look like it will happen soon.

It seems more to me that we\'re arguing about wether the civil war has
tapered off by 1128 or not. I don\'t have my \'Hard Times\' with me, so
I may be misremembering. If so, I apologize. I\'ll check when I get
home and let you know.

>From what I remember, \'Hard Times\' says something like this: Things
kept getting worse. Now the war has ground down, the big guys have
only enough left to protect their Safes. Here\'s a way to figure out
what happened to the rest of the worlds up until 1128. [Roll lots
of dice; consult lots of tables]. Some planets end up looking like
this: [Population 5 billion, Starport B, Tech D]. These worlds try
to make it on their own, but they can only stave off the inevitable.
In ten more years they will all have fallen apart. One reason is the
terrible menace of pirate bands with 6, 8, TEN ships!! Wow, the PCs
are all that stand between Indro the Lightless and the defenseless
planet. Can they save it? The suspense is killing! (:-P )

Most of my arguments are based on the premise that the war is over.
If it isn\'t you have an answer to the most pressing problem: Who is
it who keeps bombing these planets? Still, although I admit that in
that case you have a stronger position, I have a few arguments about
that too. Namely, why bother? Oh, sure, the planets directly on the
path between Lucan and Dulinor might get the bi-annual planetbuster
treatment, but why should Lucan or Dulinor waste badly needed ships
and missiles on worlds that are way off where the other side don\'t
have any strategic reason to come either? Lucan was forced to stop
his assaults on one rival when he got a mad on against another. He
dosen\'t have infinite ressources. Nor does anyone else. If GDW had
portrayed these pirates as renegade fleet squadrons things would have
been different. The planetary defense force that can stave off a
Trillion Credit Squadron might be worth stealing (except that anyone
who wanted to steal it would have to use 5 or 6 badly needed TCS\'s to
do so, but let that lie), but who would bother to steal 700 fighters,
25 small jump shuttles and 10 converted 600 T merchants?

This will only affect worlds that are between Lucan and Dulinor\'s Safes.
Other factions are behaving considerably saner.

But that\'s just my point. GDW tells us how bad it is and tells us that
that\'s so bad that these planets can\'t recover on their own. I say they
can if they\'re left alone by the Big Guys. The Big Guys can clobber them
down to the stone age if they want to, no argument there. But that\'s not
what GDW says happens.

A planet is a big place. Hide those SDB\'s when any fleet comes through. Or
are you saying that Lucan, Dulinor et alii have enough strength to supervise
the building programs of all planets in the Outlands and the Wilds? I think
not.

Anyway, I\'d much rather build meson gun batteries. Who is going to have
irreplacable starships shot to pieces in order to steal meson guns that
they don\'t have the ships to mount on, and that will propably get destroyed
before you can steal them? The English Navy was hard pressed, but when they
attacked shore batteries it was to destroy the guns there, not steal them.

Perhaps you can recommend me a few books, then. The ones I\'ve read says
that although interceptions at sea did happen, in far the most cases it
was in places where the geography forced ships to use comparatively
narrow sea lanes. Mostly ships were intercepted near the start or near
the end of their trip. Thus the analogy is reasonably close.

>Worse, it\'s difficult to sail past an enemy and miss him,

Well, if you as a historian will tell me that the annals of the various
Napoleonic Naval services is not chock full of ship trying to intercept
other ships and failing, and that most interceptions took place in open
sea...

>but easy to jump
>past him as he\'s going to where you came from...  If I want to

No argument there. My argument was that you wouldn\'t have a force large
enough to damage his mainworld.

>[telling a naval architect and historian to go read about the

Sorry, I did not get the impression from your posting that you were a
naval historian. I know better now.
Even so, let me suggest that you consider wether the difference between
sea (with communications limited to line-of-sight) is really _that_
different from Traveller space.

Which it looks like quite a lot have. There\'s three or four in the three
sub-sectors that GDW have published so far.

I make it 12 weeks. That fast enough for you? And you\'re still assuming
that they get ground down to zero, nada, zilch; that they didn\'t manage to
hide a few ships here and there, that they\'ve been sitting on their thumbs
for the last 5 years, and that no masterless squadrons will turn up and
apply for work (with the personnel policy that Lucan uses I\'d expect
quite a lot of admirals will move elsewhere rather than report back that
they failed to carry out their orders :-).

Groan! That\'s what I\'ve been saying. Now that high-population planet at
least has a defense force (they also have the ressources to support
those pirates in luxury, so why are the fool pirates going off raiding
instead of staying and defending their meal ticket?) No, it makes no
sense. Any pirate group strong enough to defeat the defenses of a high-
population planet will either be supported already (and thus have no
interest in attacking it) or will take over that planet (and thus
become their defenders).

No they don\'t. They hide their forces from big fleets and whale
the tar out of any pirates that come along. A planet is big. A
star system is really big. How many ships do you imagine Lucan
or Dulinor can afford to send on these recruiting missions? How
long can they stay and search?

- ---- Forwarded message # 1:

From: Chuck <76234.2216@CompuServe.COM>

Re: piracy.  Yes, those hi-pop worlds sure can crank out the patrolling 
forces.  But my logic was as follows;
 (you may submit this for inclusion on TML, if you wish)

In the wind-down period of the Rebellion (let us call them the Black War 
years), the consequences of sustained strategic combat are being felt by
even the most unscathed surviviors.  Merchant fleets are in tatters, indust-
ries that once were part of an integrated market are rapidly realizing that
they can no longer be a big specialized cog in a bigger Imperial machine.
They will have to go solo now, since the Imperium--and the commercial matrix
that pervaded it--has dissolved (or rather, disintegrated).  This means that
they must initiate the difficult process of retooling for maximum self-
sufficiency.  They must move to the more primite (see Aristotles __Politics-s_
for the source) economic state of generalization and self-reliance in all 
things.  In effect, every planet begins --perforce--to think of itself as 
a separate `machine\' not a cog.  

The retooling necessary to actuate such a shift is immense.  Real world 
examples would include the USA trying to go back to a 100% domestic economy;
we could probably do it, but the cost would be horrific.  Workforce dis-
locations, currency instability, decreased commercial and investment potent-
ial; there would be violence, unrest, confusion.  And as a result, an 
increasingly isolationist view (economic isolation DOES tend to be a vicious
and self-amplifying cycle).

While all this is going on, the big whigs on any planet have one thing upper
- -most in their mind: to hang on to as much tech level as they can.  TL is 
the primary chip in the interstellar poker game of survival, dominance, 
aability to enforce one\'s sovreign right to govern oneself (or others!).  So
in the midst of all the economic and industrial restructuring, there is ano-
ther expensive imperative; retain as high a level of technology as can be
self-sustained.  A tricky balancing act.  This act is further complicated 
for worlds with less friendly biospheres.

Specifically, in the case of most industrial, hi-pop worlds, their environ-
ment is, virtually by definition, essentially inhospitable to terrestrial 
life.  Environment must be created and maintained; it is not delivered 
gratis by the planet.  Hi-pop means a tremendous food consumption capacity.
Food growing is expensive on such worlds--but manufacturing (ie; industrial
endeavor) is not.  This predicts the pre-war, peacetime economy; produce
those things which are cheap for you to make and bring in the highest price.
Use the profits to buy your needs.  This is more commercially rewarding than
making all your needs AND then making goods.  This stunts economies, limits
growth.  The only advantage of this brand of fiscal conservatism is that it
makes the economy/polity very self-reliant--not a big concern in the laissez
- -faire mindset that dominated the Third Imperium.

So what does all this mean?  It means that the worlds that COULD make all 
those defensive ships to combat piracy aren\'t doing so; they\'re busy frying
other fish that are essential to their survival.  In a few years, when the
retooling is all done and they feel that they have vouchsafed their own 
safety, THEN they might start trying to expand their protective envelope to
include other less developed systems.  But they are going to look out for
Number One first.  And it will take until 1130 (and trillions upon trillions
of credits) to achieve this.

Here the problem exists that while since TCS we have had a way of getting
very clear numbers regarding costs and maintenance of fleet assets, we do 
not have a mechanism for calculating the cost of the massive retooling
necessitated by Hard Times.  Nor do I think such a mechanism is required;
history and common sense both tell us that the costs will be HUGE--huge
enough to paralyze even the largest powers into isolationistic, protectionists
t stances until they have recovered from this era of displacement.

In my view, by 1130, that process of restructuring will have progressed to
the point that the surviving polities (whether multi-system or single world)
will have worked out a means of existing in this new universe.  At this poin
- -t, there will be a tendency to retake space from the elements of chaos
(piracy and other thuggery).  At the same time, the best spoils are likely
to have been found and picked clean by these interstellar vultures.  So as
their sustenance diminishes, resistance rises--forcing piracy back into it
s box, awaiting its next opportunistic feeding time.

Sorry for the long sermon, but that\'s what was in the back of MY mind when
I wrote HT.  What GDW did with it after they got it (it was changed in 
a few ways, some of which I liked, some of which I didn\'t) and what GDW 
intends to do next are completely out of my hands.  I envisioned a one-decad
- -e balkanization period.  In the end however, Lucan is too big and unstable
a loose cannon to be endured; the need to end his threat and depredations
was to serve as the basis of an alliance, pitting a coalition of pluralist-
minded governments against his autocratic and Caligulistic monolith.

Well, Rob, right or wrong--that\'s how I saw it. And to me, the beauty of 
Traveller is that it MAY be wrong--or at least everybody is free to pursue
their own vision.  At least that\'s how I always saw it; games should be what
make us happy and give us pleasure.  Adherence to `published fact\' as 
though it is some kind of rosetta stone is at best naive, at worst, suggest-
ive of a need for external order.  Gaming is (or should be) a form of expre-
ssing and reaffirming our own freedom to do and be anything (vicariously);
we should not feel compelled to follow what we do not like.  Certainly, the
(ostensible) point of a manufactured game aid is to provide refs (and player
ss) with opportunities for fun experiences.  But unfortunately, as the 
gaming industry has grown, so has the dominance of marketing-oriented though
t.  The people in charge today are businessmen more than gamers, and it show
s.  The products may be glossier, but I think they are less responsive--and
sensitive--to what many gamers really want.  So I feel that in this period
of our hobby\'s history, we must be highly individualistic, ever ready to
decide for ourselves which is the wheat and which is the chaff.

Yes, you can print all that on TML if you wish.  Be well, have fun,
hope to hear from you soon.

Chuck

PS: I hope you explained to Loren that we had discussed the use of your

George W. Herbert wrote a whole lot, most of it based on the premise that
the Rebellion Wars were still going full throttle during the timeframe of
\'Hard Times\'. I replied:

I\'ve checked it. By 1125, when \'Hard Times\' starts, the wars are mostly
over. Lucan is still making warlike noices in the breaks between his
tantrums, but, and I quote, "The fighting is effectively over: The com-
batants are too drained to mount the massive campaigns that caracterized
the first five years of the Rebellion." (p. 8). (Also: "By the beginning
of 1125, the factional core areas have achieved basic stability. Military
forces have withdrawn to lines that can be reliably defended..." (p. 12)).

\'Hard Times\' then shows us how to figure out how planets outside the
Safes are affected in the next three years. By the _end_ of this period
we have, in the three sample sub-sectors that GDW has published, these
planets (among many other): Khavle; Pop. 7 billion, Starport C, Tech B.
Aight; Pop. 70 billion, Starport C, Tech A. Westfir; Pop. 600 million,
Starport B, Tech B. Exeter; Pop. 400 million, Starport C, Tech B. And
the pearl of them all, Promise; Pop. 5 billion, Starport B, Tech D. This
is in 1128, mind you. These planets have all been through the Hard Times
wringer, and this is what they look like _after_ the ordeal. And these
are the planets that GDW claims are seriously threathened by pirate bands
with a few thousand tons worth of motley starships.

I wouldn\'t have complained if GDW had said that all these planets had
been bombed down to TL 3 in the war years, but to claim that they were
reduced to TL A-D and will slide the rest of the way by themselves,
nudged over the edge by the likes of Indro the Lightless and Cymon
Milligan, is just plain silly. If GDW wants these worlds to slide
further, they should provide believable menaces like renegade fleet
units. And there you run into the problem that these fleet units may
destroy some planets, but at the same time they will protect other.
To get half the Outlands and the Wilds to destroy the other half is
quite believable; but to get them _all_ to destroy each other calls
for a masterpiece of choreography worthy of a Hiver Manipulator.

Hmmm.... you don\'t suppose...

Nah!

 A funny looking vargr with a big black nose..."

A lot of people complain about COACC.  I kinda like it in some
ways.  But one problem is that it can\'t handle TL 5 aircraft.
There is only one engine available at TL5, and it is about
twice the full weight of most of the aircraft in the period.  So,
I thought I\'d introduce the Rotary engine.  The best aircraft
engine of its day.

Back in World War I, the best engine available for aircraft was
the rotary engine.  It had the best thrust to weight ratio of all
aircraft engines of the time.  These are the engines you see on
the Sopwith Camel, and the Fokker Triplane, the DH-2, Fokker
Eindecker, etc. etc.

Very interesting engine.  They had trouble cooling normal radials
and in-lines so they hit upon an interesting solution:  rather
than bolt the prop to the crank case and the engine to the
firewall, they did it the other way around.  Thus, with the
engine bolted to the prop, the entire engine rotates with the
prop when running.

This leads to some interesting problems with maneuvering.  The
engine is rotating with a considerable angular momentum.  The
action is one of a gyroscope, and when the aircraft turns, the
gyro precesses.  When you turn right, the gyro precesses throwing
the nose up in the air and slowing the plane down.  When you turn
left, the nose will precess down, making the plane accelerate. 
Thus the plane will turn faster to the left than it will to the
right.  Also, you can not turn right on take off (Pilots:  This
may be the origin of the left handed traffic pattern)  Howard
Hughes nearly killed himself attempting to turn right on take
off.  He was injured so severely that he spent the rest of his
life addicted to pain killers.

Thus in a left turn, an aircraft\'s agility will be higher than it
is in a right turn.

Another problem with the engine is that it has a centrifugal fuel
feed.  As such, throttleing the engine is not possible.  The
engine has only an On-Off switch.  ("Switch off!")  This makes
landings difficult as the only way to slow down the plane is to
turn the engine on and off at intervals.  (You may have heard
this sound in WWI movies.  This is the "Brrr...  Brrr...  Brrr...
Brrr..." sound you hear as the planes are taxiing and when in the
approach to landing.)  With no throttle there is no cruise speed,
only the top speed of the aircraft.  Another difficulty is that
the engines must be hand cranked.  (Watch your FINGERS!)

Rotary engine:
..1 tons, 1.5ton thrust, Fuel=22 liters per hour, Cost=5000 Cr
Agility=+1 when turning left, -1 when turning right.  Twin engine
planes may avoid this difficulty by having contra-rotating props.

It is also possible to have your engine rotating in the opposite
direction, thus making it a right hand turn that would be faster,
but (at least on Earth) it was done this way.

These low tech open cockpit aricraft are popular among Vargr.
They were made popular by a Vargr folk hero on the planet Peanutz
when he single handedly defeated a legendary human aristocrat
pilot.  The battle is celebrated in song...

"Now Snoopy had sworn that he\'d get that man,
 so he asked Yaskodray for a new battle plan
 He challenged the human to a real dog fight
 while the Baron was laughing,
 he got him in his sights!"

I found this artilcle very interesting, but I have a question about the
above data. I\'m not certain of where you got the GIP from, but what does
the taxation rate have to do with the volume of shipping? Most of the
traders will either belong to MegaCorps, or to private traders, not the
government. Perhaps you could explain what assumptions that you used to
arrive at these figures, I may want my universe to have a different set
of assumptions....

                      THE IMPERIAL ADVISOR

     Ynno burst into the Imperial Liason Office in the Department
of  Foreign  Affairs  of  the  Protectorate  of  Taxan.  "Sarion!
Sarion!", he cried, standing at an empty desk. "Oh, hello Clare."
She pointed beyond the partition and began to say something. 
     A  man  appeared from behind the partition. "Ynno!  Did  the
conference go well?"
     "The  conference?" He seemed distracted for a moment,  "Yes,
well  enough I suppose", he grabbed Sarion and pulled him  toward
the Coffee Dock. "I met the new Imperial Liason officer for Taxan
Amalgamate. She\'s was amazing! Really incredible! She really knew
her  stuff. She would whisper to the Amalgamate delegate or  make
notes  at all the right places. I saw the ambiguities  they  were
introducing  and  I could see that she could see  them  too."  He
paused for breath. "She\'s good."
     Sarion  poured  a  cup for himself and water  for  Ynno.  He
nodded enthusiastically, as Ynno continued. "And when she  spoke!
She  has  the  grace, charm and intonations of  a  Princess!  She
_sounds_ like a noble!"
     "Come on, Amalgam may be number one on Taxan but they aren\'t
that rich."
     "No, I\'m not saying they are. She\'s just very well trained."
Clare wandered over, smiling with Ynno\'s good humour.
     "Keep going", she said.     Ynno continued enthusiastically,
"Impeccable dress sense, medium height with short brown hair. And
blue  eyes.  I\'ll never forget the eyes. They just kind  of  held
you."
     "I  see  you  gained  a lot  from  the  conference",  Sarion
commented drily.
     Ynno  shrugged  it easily away, "Ach, it all will be  in  my
report. The conference was no different than most. The  Imperials
trying  to  either undermine local business in  favour  of  mega-
corporations or tying to buy us out and amalgamate us with  them.
She carried the day. I think the government can rest assured that
our biggest economic interest is no one\'s fool. I expect  they\'ll
be needing less and less advice."
     "I  hope  this  friend of yours isn\'t putting  our  jobs  at
risk", said Clare in mock serious tones.
     "Not  that  they ever trusted us anyway", said  Sarion.  "We
have their competitors\' interests at heart as well. But, you give
a rather glowing report of ..."
     "Bethula Myragail", Ynno rolled the name off.
     "...Ms. Myragail. You think she\'s good?", Sarion asked.
     "Oh, yes! Top notch", he beamed.
     "As good as you?"
     His  face suddenly changed and he looked downcast  into  his
cup. "You know she couldn\'t be as good as that."
     Sarion patted Ynno. "Sorry, I didn\'t mean to remind you... I
suppose  she couldn\'t be. She\'s just flesh and blood." He  downed
the last of his cup.
     "Cheer  up", said Clare. "There\'s nothing wrong  with  being
the best." 
     "Sarion",  said Ynno fixing his attention. "I think  I\'m  in
love."  He looked up into Sarion\'s brown eyes with his own  black
ones. Tears almost flowed from his expression of utter confusion.
    Clare withdrew slowly from the two of them. Sarion sighed and
threw  the cup away. He put both both hands on  Ynno\'s  shoulders
and  just stared into his face, concerned. Ynno broke  his  stare
and looked aside. "I know what you\'re going to say." He wiped the
corner  of  his  eye. "I can\'t. I have no  feelings."  He  turned
fiercely  back.  "That isn\'t true. They don\'t know. They  say  my
program was written by a madman. Duplicated over and over. No one
knows what I think. I ..."
     "Stop", said Sarion. "No. I wouldn\'t say that."
     "You\'re much more than that", said Clare.
     Sarion  moved  his  hands to Ynno\'s face. "I  don\'t  care  a
millichit for your program. You\'re my friend. No one can tell  me
you can\'t feel." Clare nodded in agreement.
     Ynno  smiled weakly and swallowed deeply. Sarion let go  and
Clare passed him a handkerchief. "What do I do now?" he asked.
     "You  must  meet  her socially!"  said  Sarion  with  sudden
enthusiasm. He pulled him back to his desk, Clare following. "Now
let\'s see." He dipped his pen and began writing. "We could have a
government sponsored party to informally discuss the implications
of the last conference?"
     "Why would they come? From the way they listened to her I am
sure they trust her every opinion."
     "We could serve Methlanian wine", suggested Clare. "The reps
from  Alganam Associates can\'t resist these things any more  than
they can hold their liquor."
     "Could  be worth half a year\'s industrial  espionage",  said
Sarion and waggled his eyebrows at him.
     "Hmmm", acceded Ynno. "It could work."
     He thrust the stylus at him. "You\'ve got to think  positive,
my boy. You go write your report. Stress that the Imperials might
be  misleading the companies and it would be recommended that  we
informally see what exactly they made of it."
     "Remember  four  years ago when you  first  started  working
here?" added Clare.
     "It comes back to me now. \'They may not know what  questions
they  should be asking of this bureau and so to get the most  for
the taxpayers money...\'"
     "Precisely." They all grinned at each other.

Nothing should happen.  No gravitational effect. Firing rocket engines in  to
produce a gravitational effect requires that you accelerate in some direction.
Nothing to react against, no accelleration.  No accelleration, no gravitational
effect. All float.

I\'d guess the effect is for gravitational sources outside the hull, ie, outside 
the lanthanum grid.  Similarly, using an anti-grav drive should cause any
problems as the drive\'s generator is inside the grid (unless it was left behind
:-).

With the inertial compensators, the shell can provide a safe ride
for the single passenger.  The radar unit triggers maximum output
to the inertial compensators on landing, while the CPR guidance
will direct the shell to a designated parking place.

Cargo models are available for pizza delivery, where the grav
pizza robots are illegal.  The above can deliver up to an 18 inch
pizza with pinpoint accuracy.  Pizza delivery can be quite fast. 
The large range allows a single Domino\'s Pizza Parlor to cover
many times the service area they could before.  This is
especially helpful in rural areas.  Campers, sick of trail food,
may now order pizza by radio and have it delivered within
seconds.  No matter where you are, Domino\'s delivers!  Your pizza
will arrive in 3 minutes or it\'s free!  These cargo models are
used sometimes used by the military.  It\'s official military
designation is C.P.R.  (Combat Pizza Resupply)

THE HOUSEWARMING WITH NO NAME
 
Directions
 
>From the Capitol Beltway, take Connecticut Avenue north.  Go
waaaay north and turn left on Aspen Hill Road.  Take the first
right, which is Frankfort.  Take the second right after the
second stop sign (they are not really close together).  This
will be Eagle Court.  14007 Eagle Court (i.e., our house) is on
the right just before the circly part; it\'s cream with rust
trim.
 
If you prefer not to take the Beltway, then from 95 going south 
take the exit for 198 West -- I think it\'s Exit 33, but I\'m not 
sure. Stay on 198 past where it crosses 29; very soon after that 
point it narrows down to one lane either way. Be alert for a sign 
pointing out Good Hope Road, and take a left (only way you can 
go) on Good Hope. Good Hope becomes Bonifant when it crosses MD 
650, and then Bel Pre when it crosses 182. Whatever its name, 
just stay on it. When it crosses 97 (Georgia Avenue) it narrows 
down to one lane either way and the speed limit reduces. Stay on 
it until you hit a stop sign and then turn left (Arctic Ave). 
Stay on Arctic through a stop sign and then take your next left 
(Frankfort). Take your second left (Eagle Ct). 
 
Call me at (301) 871-5581 or 871-5104 if you have problems. The 
only problem I foresee is if you miss Good Hope Road in the 
non-Beltway directions; if this happens, then you\'ll come to MD 
650 (New Hampshire Avenue). Take a left on New Hampshire, and 
then, a small number of miles (3 or 4 maybe?) Take a right onto 
Bonifant (there\'s a light). Yeah, you\'ll go right past our old 
house; spit for old times\' sake. 
 
Good luck!

PS The second set of directions were written for ppl definitely
coming from Baltimore. When I say "95 going south" I mean "95
north of the Beltway".

Hotel of Death is a role playing supplement/adventure.  The players
for one reason or another find themselves at a really nice hotel.
There is a shopping mall, conventions space (one of the really good
ways to get the players there is to have them attending a con) and
lots and lots of space to meet nps\'s and avoid being killed by them.

There are a number of plots going on at the hotel.  The players many
or may not become involved in them.

Spy vs. Spy:
	Someone has stolen the plans for the new Imperial
	Battlestation.  That someone has planted the information on
	the unsuspecting players.  Both sides are trying to get the
	plans back.
Horror:
	Someone is going around chopping people into small bite sized
	portions.  Convention goers are vanishing at an alarming
	rate.
Clones vs. Non-cloned:
	The work on the planet is done by cheap lowpriced clones.
	They are unhappy with their lot and are plotting to revolt.
	Blade Runners ala the movie are loose.  Some players might be
	mistaken as clones, or caught in the cross fire.
Revolution:
	The emperor is dead!  Long live the emperor!
Daleks:
	The hotel was really built by the daleks, or some other evil
	spacefaring race for unknown goals.
Zhodani vs. Imperial:
	Zhodani mindbenders are loose in the hotel.  What they want is
	unknown.
Aliens:
	Nesting, breeding, competing with "Jason" from the horror
	subplot for bodies.
Other:
	I pay attention to the players and add anything that they
	think might be going on.  The latest run of HoD has the
	players on the run from "Candi" and her Imperial Marines.  It
	seems that one of the players was a little forcefull in
	turning Candi down for a date.  Candi just happens to be one
	of the contenders for the Iridium Throne.

Some of the hooks used in the past to get players involved:
- -->	Players are attending the convention and are asked to host
	pannels when the guest of honor fails to show.
- -->	Players are running the convention.
- -->	Players are on an all expense paid vacation that they
	won/bought.
- -->	Players are working for one of the major governments.
- -->	Players are part of one of the plots.
- -->	The players do something interesting.
- -->	There is a yell for help and then a thud against their door.
	When the door is opened, there is a dead body attached to the
	door with an ax.

destroyed."
     A female human voice announced.  "This is the Spindleman
from the League of Suns calling droyne vessels.  We are coming to
your assistance."
     The human male voice broke back in.  "That won\'t help you.
It will take them four hours to reach you.  Surrender now,
batwings, or be destroyed."
     The woman came back on line, "Spindleman to unidentified
SDB\'s, you are ordered to cease fire.
     Shtam came over the intercom, "It has to be the pirates!
But, what are they doing in system defence boats?  How did they
jump in system?"
     Niedrsha looked Jietlshaiepr in the eye, "You\'re in command,
Jiet.  We go in?"
     Jietlshaiepr slammed her fist into the console.  "Intercept
course, all ahead flank!  Miakr, program the Vixen to attack
those SDB\'s!"
     "I\'m on it."  Miakr started feeding in attack orders and
target selections.
     "Attention, fighters, immediate launch.  Kfoks, you Tuerz
and Stuzzel intercept and attack pirate SDB\'s."
     Acceleration piled on the ship straining the inertial
compensators.  A thud ran through the ship as the Flamboyant\'s
gig slipped into space.
     "Flamboyant one away." announced Kfoks.
     Two more shocks jolted the ship.
     "Flamboyant two away." called Tuerz.
     "Flamboyant three away." grumbled Stuzzel.  "We can\'t take
on SDB\'s in these fighters!  It\'s crazy!  We\'ll never hit \'em!"
     "Cut the chatter Flamboyant three." called Kfoks annoyed,
"Throttle up to attack acceleration!"
     The three flew off in formation.  Seconds later the Vixen
confirmed that it had the correct targets locked and sped off
hot on the tails of the fighters.
     "The droyne are returning fire..." growled Jietlshaiepr.  "I
read one SDB has been hit twice...  Blast their armor!  Didn\'t do
any thing I can read...  Well, the Spindleman won\'t be much good,
I read her out as a standard type S Scout... She\'s got some guts
taking on two ships four times her size."
     "This is Flamboyant one, we will be in range in three
minutes."
     Jietlshaiepr read off "The SDB\'s are firing again...
Viepchakl!  I hope the Droyne\'re still there in three minutes...
The missiles were shot out of the sky but one laser hit on the
cruiser...  I read outgassing...  Possible loss of fuel,   The
droyne ships can\'t seem to lock onto the SDB\'s well enough...
All their shots are missing...  The SDB\'s too maneuverable...  We
have to get in there fast...  Time to range mark?"
     "Ten minutes, thirty five seconds." answered Niedrsha.
     Jietlshaiepr turned to the intercom, "Gunners stay sharp,
range in ten minutes."
     She jerked to attention.  "Two more contacts bearing in...
One has a one point five gigawatt reactor...  One hundred tons...
The other... five hundred megawatts... two hundred tons...  Must
be a freighter...  The one hundred tonner will intercept droyne
in two minutes.  The two hundred tonner... in twenty seven...  I
read the one hundred tonner out as a tech nine SDB... the two
hundred tonner is... a Fanzheinz class free trader..."
     Jietlshaiepr turned to the communications station, "Lasercom
transmit... Spindleman come in, this is the gunned escort
Flamboyant, just arrived in system... come in... we are offering
assistance to distressed droyne convoy... request target
verification."
     "Spindleman to Flamboyant.  Assistance accepted.  What
information do you require?"
     "Target identification, I have multiple contacts:  Two
droyne traders, one droyne cruiser, two four hundred ton SDB\'s, a
one hundred ton SDB, and a Fanzheinz class free trader.  Request
identification of hostiles."
     "Flamboyant hold... have no knowledge of any SDB\'s in your
area, must be considered hostile... Fanzheinz unknown... will
attempt communication for verification... proceed with caution.
Good luck.  Out."
     "Flamboyant to Flamboyant flight leader... Kfoks, alter
course to... one five dash zero niner... intercept one hundred
ton SDB bearing in on convoy... identified as hostile...  Over."
     "Flight leader to Flamboyant... Acknowledged...  Target in
sight.... Flight leader to two and three, arm weapon systems.
On my mark, open fire.  Load high explosive missiles only.  This
isn\'t worth a nuke."
     The speeding SDB bore in on the convoy not noticing its
small pursuers neutrino traces.  Still out of range of the droyne
guns, she didn\'t bother to evade but bore in on an arrow straight
course:  nice and easy to track and lock on.
     "Flamboyant flight:  fire!"
     Two missiles streaked away from the Vipers.  The gig\'s laser
lanced out unseen in the vacuum.  The SDB shook under the shock
of its turret ionizing under a storm of X-ray photons.  One
missile zeroed in closing the gap homing on the startled SDB.  A
brief flash lit the SDB against the stars.  Hydrogen burst into
the vacuum obscuring her outlines for a moment.  She tumbled a
moment, quickly stabilized, but the engines fired erratically and
quit.  Still moving under the momentum of the attitude jets, it
began to tumble again slowly.
     Jietlshaiepr read the sensors "It\'s reactor is fading...
looks like you blasted the fuel tanks.  Good shooting."
     Kfoks voice beamed over the radio, "Piece of mutton,
Flamboyant.  She didn\'t even evade."
     "That missile hit was mine of course." sighed Tuerz, "Stupid
didn\'t get a proper lock on a non-evading target."
     "How are you so sure you hit?" growled Stuzzel, "We fired at
the same time."
     "I know it was mine because it hit."
     "Shut up!" barked Kfoks, "Flamboyant, what\'s the I.D. on the
Fanzheinz?"
     "Spindleman to Flamboyant, Fanzheinz refuses to answer
challenge.  Must be considered as hostile."
     "We\'re on it." answered Kfoks.  "Flamboyant flight bear two
seven dash two five."
     Jietlshaiepr studied the sensors:  "One droyne trader\'s
engines are out... the other\'s fuel is hit...  The cruiser\'s
engines are damaged but she\'s still maneuvering...  One SDB lost
some fuel too...  The Vixen should open fire right about now..."
     The Vixen swooped into battle range at six G\'s maneuvering
wildly.  Missiles belched from her bay and turrets streaming out
like a cloud of bats swarming from a cave.  The SDB\'s lasers
leapt out to stem the onslaught, but the defenses were swamped.
The turrets of one vaporized instantly as they were lost in a
flare of nuclear fire.  The missile racks of the second were
shaken and bent by the introduction of high explosive.
     The droyne cruiser\'s lasers swept out seeking the enemy.
Missiles flew past as the SDB\'s evaded, but the lasers struck
home leaving the first SDB\'s missile racks all but smashed.
     The pirates returned fire at the new arrived menace.  Lasers
and missiles zeroed in on the twisting Vixen.  Robots however do
not appreciate near misses or close calls.  The engines of
destruction swept on impotently.
     Another salvo of missiles blazed forth at the pirate SDB\'s.
The ships turned to flee as they streamed in like sharks to a
kill.  The monstrous bulk of the missiles flew on into the
vacuum, save the best for last.  The Vixen\'s nukes slammed into
the fleeing pirate.  Her turrets became slag as they were
irradiated, buckling armor plates around them.
     Simultaneously the Fanzheinz class free trader turned and
ran on the same heading.
     Kfoks voice came over the communicator, "Flamboyant, this is
Flamboyant flight.  Target vessel now running.  Request permission
to pursue."
     "Negative, flight leader." answered Jietlshaiepr.  "They are
on a rendezvous course with enemy SDB\'s.  Not even the Vixen can
do much against their armor.  Get back here, the droyne may
require assistance."
     "The pirates are still firing at the droyne convoy."  She
continued, "Why?  Don\'t they know they\'ve lost them?  They\'ve
disabled the second trader\'s engines and I can\'t tell what they
did to the cruiser."
     The Vixen flew on in hot pursuit loosing missiles as she
ran.  The missiles crashed through the pirate\'s armor silencing
the last of their guns.
     "Miakr, call back the Vixen, their on the run and she can\'t
seem to disable them."
     "Right, here she comes.  Good girl!  She chased \'em off."
     Jietlshaiepr punched the radio, "Droyne convoy, this is
Flamboyant... Repeat, Droyne convoy this is Flamboyant, do you
require assistance?... Droyne convoy come..."
     A tiny voice broke through a wave of static, "This cruiser
Chekbas droyne is.  All ships droyne damaged been have.  Drone
medic of Trader Kivas killed been has.  Wounded aboard are.
Medic aboard have you?"
     "Viepchakl," she thought, "how much do I really know about
droyne anatomy?"
     "Affirmative, we have a doctor aboard.  I may require
assistance with droyne physiology.  Do you require assistance
with damage control?"
     "Cruiser Chekbas:  maneuver drive damaged, two laser
batteries destroyed.  Trader Kivas:  computer destroyed, maneuver
drive damaged.  Trader Shoolist:  hold destroyed, maneuver drive
damage repair complete.  Streamlining trader\'s both destroyed."
     "Acknowledged.  We will aide the Kivas.  Estimate rendezvous
and docking in... two minutes.  Be prepa..."
     "Oh, Shiviepchakl..."
     The neutrino detector suddenly started going mad.  Twelve
readings of nine gigawatts, one reading of six hundred.
     Densiometer crosscheck...  Confirmed...  Targets closing...
Twelve four hundred ton SDB\'s...  One forty thousand ton ship of
the line....

I most certainly do agree that weapons are important--and I
wholeheartedly agree with your point (made in other writings)
that the equivalent of shore defense batteries would be a major
investment and offer an impervious defense against pirates.  So
too would a local defense fleet.  But note that I say `local.\'
As we know from the design rules, equal tons of boat carries a
lot more whallop than equal tons of jump-integral ship.  With the
politics of isolationism firmly in hand, it is a lot more easy to
build the equivalent of SDBs than convoy escorts.
The problem with building convoy escorts?  I see several.  One of
the key problems with building ANYTHING at this time in Imperial
history is that the constructing world\'s actual TL is not
stable--and no one knows exactly HOW FAR IT WILL FALL until the
end of Hard Times.  I draw the following very important quote
from HT, pg 19, para 3:

"The UWP alterations are usually the end result of months or even
years of slow change."

In practical terms, this means that you the ref know WELL BEFORE
THE ACTUAL INHABITANTS exactly how far a planet\'s TL is going to
fall.  You the ref can build accordingly, having that
foreknowledge.  However, THEY cannot.  A world that will (unknown
to its leaders) bottom out at TL A has no way of being sure that
they won\'t drop to TL 8 by 1129-20--in which case every starship
they\'ve built becomes an unmaintainable white elephant.  The TL
shift is integrated into a single, chronologically hard-edged
step in order to make the game mechanics of its application user-
friendly.  However, that AIN\'T how things happen--and the im-
plications of that discrepancy have a lot of impact on technol-
ogy, costs, and construction strategies.

Personally, I envision a situation where until 1129, the nature
of TL in most of these post-war societies hangs in the balance.
Not just due to trade unpredictability and war damage, but policy
choices.  For instance, in this country right now, the defense
industry is losing jobs right and left.  As a scriptwriter for
science documentaries, I have heard of countless research
programs--and production programs--being terminated, rolled back,
tossed aside.  In short, I am watching as policy changes affect
available TL and associated support infrastructure.  In HT, I
think the situation would be more severe--by several orders of
magnitude.  I govern planet X which used to have a TL of F, now
falling.  How many people do I employ in TL-C industries, hoping
to use that activity as a commercial impetus to shore up my over-
all TL?  But what if I\'m wrong?  What if that still won\'t
maintain a TL of C?  Then I\'ll fall even further than I would
have otherwise, because I tried to build my technological dike
too far out into the oncoming tides of decline.  So, knowing
this, I have to think about also subsidying TL 10 industries, and
employing people there.  But now I\'ve created rival interest
groups; the TL 12 industries and the TL 10 industries.  THe lat-
ter will want a return to the older, more basic technologies--
since that\'s how their bread is being buttered.  The TL 12 folks
will want to try to hold the line where they are, try to show
that the TL 10 group is unnecessarily recidivistic.

So maybe you should only go with one group?  Maybe, but in that
event, most worlds will feel compelled to pursue the path sug-
gested by the axiom `better safe than sorry\' and will go with the
TL 10 option (or less).  The price of guessing too high is the
same as counting unhatched eggs; without enough chickens, you
will starve.  If all the eggs were placed in the TL 12 basket and
it doesn\'t work out, where will the slide finally stop?  The pos-
sibility for this mismanagement of TL downshift is reflected in
the randomizing element (die roll) of UWP change, along with the
DM for government type (there\'s the fast, and then there\'s the
dead).

The bottom line is that until 1129, I see HT meaning that
planets--great and small alike--are in a state of immense flux.
SHip building times (and capacities) are further complicated by
the fact that shipyards do not usually produce all their own
parts, nor do they acquire all their needed raw materials local-
ly.  In the post HT era, this may change, due to the lessons
learned in HT.  But case in point: a few years ago, a small com-
pany that was a subcontractor to a major US defense leviathan
went under.  It manufactured one small, humble component for a
very well known--and well respected--US air superiority fighter.
Production of the fighters continued while DC dawdled over what
to do.  End result; the part supply ran out and the production of
the jet  came to a screeching halt until a makeshift replacement
company was formed up.
Now, let\'s go one step further; let\'s say that this company
wasn\'t US, but foreign.  Then you get the following scenario: A
good friend of mine (a published MT author, btw) has a Yugo.
Nice car, but no parts.  And his trade-in option for another Yugo
just went south with Sarajevo.

Let\'s apply these anecdotes to ship construction.  Adequate
transshipment (to say nothing of production) of essential com-
ponents has been on the decline since 1118.  Since 1120, it has
become quite haphazard, but now, by 1125, it has effectively
dried up.  Suddenly, the mad dash is on to try to find a way to
get more parts or make them.  But while this is happening, the
forecasters in the ministry of technology are shaking their heads
and saying, `We can\'t even guarantee you that we\'ll have the
technology necessary to MAKE such parts six months from now.\'
Meaning that any sensible leader is going to look long and hard
at the recommendations to create an industry capable of making
such parts.  Such a factory may be useless before it is completed
and ready to start production.

Some foresightful governments have taken it upon themselves AL-
READY (by 1125) to retool for self-sufficiency, but only LARGE
governments can undertake this effectively--and the problem with
generating self-sufficiency BEFORE the end of the war (including
the Black War Years) is that it actually makes you a bigger
target.  Consider; a planet that is self-sufficient is producing
just about everything an aggressor wants--needs--to prosecute a
war.   Such a planet represents a major logistical asset--
particularly if it is in the Outlands and on the anticipated
route of advance into enemy territory.  So until the big boys
stop playing with their big toys, planets must think twice before
becoming TOO efficient.  Is this disgusting, a tragic waste of
opportunity (and ultimately, life)?  You betcha.  Is it avoidable;
probably not. Would-be conquerors and military
hierarchs traditionally lose sight of human values the deeper
they go into their `victory at any cost\' mode.  Consider the cry
of some of this country\'s oddball reactionary conservatives dur-
ing the early Sixties: better Dead than Red.  The sentiment gets
its monstrous aspect not from the implied political resolve of
the speaker, but from the implied alternative; global nuclear war
to support their desire.  Proof positive of the capacity of indi-
viduals to lose sight of how their opinions/objectives become
more than personal choices, but in fact, come to dominate a much
wider social sphere (or in this case, a whole BIOsphere!).

I am not saying all this to suggest that your assessments are
wrong or ill-considered, Hans.  Quite the contrary; I think they
are RIGHT.  I simply feel that the timing is a little off.  Men
on a sinking ship rarely spend time considering how they want to
upgrade the cannon; they think of nothing other than saving the
ship.  Rudders must be fixed, breaches sealed, water bailed, be-
fore they will even tolerate suggestions that there are other
considerations.  The construction of a new, independent fleet is,
alas, an `other consideration.\'  Add to this the fact that a siz-
able chunk of the body politic is not likely to accept that the
Imperium HAS gone away for good.  These people would see the con-
struction of a home fleet as (at best) a betrayal of faith in the
Imperium--at worst, an act of treason (to whomever they consider
the rightful Emperor).

I absolutely agree with your implication that a major use of
jump-capable security craft would be as convoy escorts.  And in-
deed, such flotillas would rarely be at risk from pirates of even
the largest caliber.  However, what convoys get that type of pro-
tection?  My answer is this; only those that are carrying ab-
solute essentials, which I would define as food (if needed) or
parts relevant to the maintenace of tech level and defense as-
sets.  Everything else (ie; commerce in general) must simply
wait.  And while it waits, it withers and dies.  Economies turn
inward.  The demand for external trade diminishes.  The retooling
for self-sufficiency reduces the need for going to other stellar
systems.  If the basic strategy of survival-through-self works,
the need for escorted convoys drops off.

Generally, you can\'t have it both ways, particularly if there are
limited resources, and much of that resource base (TL) is unsure:
you must either go for self-sufficiency or maintenance of inter-
stellar ties.  The latter is too big a job at first; even the
biggest world must put its own house in order prior to ex-
pansionist thought (and providing a protective envelope for trade
and resource pooling is expansionist, in these terms).

But now on to an area of questionable self-sufficiency; food.

Hmm... interesting.  My math suggests a few differences.  First
of all, I propose using the `modular\' design approach put forward
in One Small Step (pg 83 HT, or a past issue of Challenge).  Make
the central hull the equivalent of a jump tender.  The other 95 %
are no-frills cargo hulls; just big grain silos in space.  If you
make the central tender 500 KT to 1 MT, you\'ll find that one ship
can haul A LOT of food.  Furthermore, my estimate re: food is
that the whole foodstuff is not economical to transport; only the
necessary sustenance components (sugars, proteins, vitamins, some
starches).  Fully dehydrated and compressed, I think you can get
a person day into about .25 liters..  Mating this with `bulk fil-
lers\' (from algae tanks on the high-pop world) at the destination
would give you your food.

However, I fully agree with you that COMPLETE food importation is
still beyond the A-population worlds (and is economically un-
feasible for the pop-9\'s UNLESS they own and operate their own
food-transport vessels...).  If it seems like I was suggesting
this, I\'m sorry-- I do not mean to do so.  However, I do maintain
that complete self-sufficiency is also unlikely.  First of all,
assuming that only 2 % of a population can afford something other
than the basic `protein cake\' of fortified, baked algae paste
(which probably tastes worse than cardboard), this still means
hunreds of millions of people.  A big market, where a `luxury\'
food item is wheat, meat, fruit; anything other than those bland,
frisbee-like cakes of Soylent Green fame.

Let\'s assume that 2-5 % of each world do rely on these off-world
`delicacies.\'  I would also assume that there is actually a fur-
ther deficit of food, simply because although you can grow LOTs
of algae cheaply, the necessary nutrients can only come from one
of four sources;

1) off-world supplies
2) chemical synthesis from basic organic molecules
3) reprocessed wastes
4) reprocessed, um... `neighbors\'

Option 4 IS Soylent Green and is probably still a social taboo
violation (I HOPE so!).  #3 will hardly be popular, and watch out
for a breakdown in qc!  Fatal food poisonings a plenty!  (And
processed wastes is probably the only biomass of sufficient
volume on a hi-pop world to be the growing culture for the basic-
mass additive, the algae.  Makes those little grey cakes more ap-
pealing than ever!)

#2 is a nice idea, but gives you the same problem as number one;
if the environment does not come ready-equipped with the chemi-
cal/catalyst raw stocks, you have to import.

So #1 probably still gets used, particularly in the sense of
transshipment of protein, sugar, and vitamin additives to the al-
gae paste.  However, with FULL reduction to the basic compounds,
(i.e.; toss the starches) you can get a person-day of nourishment
into as little as .1 liters.

One last comment; I do NOT think that all this is a logical prog-
nostication of interstellar development (based on the assumptions
of the jump drive as defined).  As you will note in my last mes-
sage on TML, I think the UWP generation process creates some un-
tenable results (or at least creates some results in unrealistic
quantity; the nature of hi-pop worlds as being possible on in-
hospitable planets is, in my opinion, the worst of this).  How-
ever, Traveller exists as is.  We can either choose to throw away
the high-pop worlds (and thereby change fundamental drivers
within the game universe) or try to find explanations.

Your explanation--that the worlds are all essentially self-
sufficient--is a perfectly good variant.  However, I feel it begs
one question; HOW did those worlds with inhospitable atmospheres
and hi-populations really evolve?  Environment costs big bucks--
and the gruesome reality is that a planet without food, air,
shelter (other than rock which must be bored out), or water is
going to compel leaders to discover an affordable alternative;
mandatory sterilization.  Unless the Imperium is dominated by a
wild-eyed fertility cult, all those teeming bodies would not have
been born if they do not represent some kind of valuable asset.
Given the autocratic governmental tendencies of such hi-pop
societies, you can bet that harsh population control measures--
whatever they might be--would have been proposed and enforced.
And probably, eventually willingly espoused by the inhabitants.
Fewer people in a finite environment almost always means a higher
quality of life for those within it--until you fall beneath the
thresh-hold population required for techno-social maintenance at
the established level.
My point is this; if those populations are not in fact of benefit
to the society, why have they not been reduced to acceptable size
long ago?  Most global overpopulation today is the result of a
changing reality outstripping social adjustment.  Most overpopu-
lated regions on Earth are so because infant mortality plummeted
in the 20th Century and because the individuals in those
`rescued\' societies are still having large families--a necessity
up until the infant mortality rate took its plunge.  Now, how-
ever, the institution of the large family is a time-honored tra-
dition; it was socially and economically wise for so long that it
has achieved a position that exceeds its utilitarian value.  It
now is a component that defines the culture.  However, in several
generations, that will probably change (barring the intervention
of reactionary religion); persistant misery has a way of upset-
ting traditions.
Taking this to our Imperial model, we find no evidence of per-
vasive religious fanaticism, nor any evidence that those areas
with theocratic rulers are disposed toward maximum fertility, no
matter the costs.  So it would seem that there must be a reason
why populations would remain high, since large-family traditions
are unlikely to endure the stresses of these environments, and
there seems to be no religious issue to maintain high levels of
procreation.

So, I went to the other option: that those masses were, in some
way, economically desirable.  Why?  Cheap labor, even as sources
of huge (and cheap) merc organizations that put money in the lo-
cal tillers (a sort of industrialized version of the Dorsai no-
tion).  My solution begs a different question; what about automa-
tion and the reduction of labor?  WHY use all these bodies in-
stead of machines?  GOOD question--to which I can only answer,
humans are only more expensive in the LONG term.  Machine
alternatives have a high start up cost; savings follow.  And bes-
ides, any move toward automation generally is received with
worker suspicion, even worker violence.  I posit that many of the
high-pop worlds are slowly trimming their numbers back as they
slowly add more automation to their industrial mix.  (And
certainly, the Imperium\'s on-off discomfort with robots in gener-
al will tend to help lend a sense of thematic unity to this
alternative explanation.)

However, I completely concur with your assertion that Hard Times
WILL introduce a food shortage; no doubt about it.  Bulk material
will probably not be lacking (the algae should be plentiful), but
the necessary nutrients will.  I think we\'d see malnutrition more
than classical starvation, with governments giving less `essen-
tial\' social members algae cakes with fewer nutritive additives.
In areas where any of the algae growing media have been damaged
by the war or loss of environment, or power failure (or any of
the other myriad problems that attend violent conflict), we can
also anticipate outright starvation.  Most of these assumptions
are built into HT\'s UWP change format.

However, let me reemphasize; I feel the hi-pop world structure as
defined by Trav/MT is flawed from word go.  I do not believe
there is a `right\' explanation for the hi-pop world phenomenon,
because the situation has resulted from a game-mechanic.  That
game-mechanic is the dark side of one of Traveller\'s best fea-
tures; the original game\'s user-friendly, simple system for world
generation.  I think this leaves us with two choices; we either
uproot the whole structure and start afresh with our own, more
empirically satisfying vision OR we find a way to explain what is
really a statistical aberration that was never intended.

Yes; I am saying that the king is not wearing clothes.  I do not
believe in defending errors in game logic (as many game companies
and designers feel it necessary to do).  However, I think we have
to remember that if Traveller hadn\'t been built (in large part)
upon easy to use, consistent paradigms, it might never have be-
come popular and we might never have heard of it.  This doesn\'t
make statistical wrongs right, but I think it does suggest that
no one game (or rule or supplement) can be all things to all
people, particularly to those of us who like really HARD facts in
our hard sf.

I went back over the relevant parts of HT and failed to find any
mention that Indro (et al) ever intended to topple Khavle itself;
only to destabilize and disrupt the Accordment.  This would be
done by preying on all commercial traffic that was not `convoyed\'
with security vessels.

On another, possibly important note, I must say that the ap-
pearance of my name as one of A:V\'s designers is, umm...somewhat
misleading.  Very little --VERY LITTLE--of what I wrote got into
A:V.  A:V is actually a vastly cut-down version of another
module.  For instance, Milligan et al is not my creation; the
first I ever heard of the name was on TML.  I have since received
my copies of A:V.  Furthermore, many important aspects of the
Promise Unity (originally called simply, The Promisary) have been
altered.
When I originally proposed HT to Marc, I included a proposed
time-line (that has since been supplanted by the new revision).
I had originally proposed that the Vikings would, by 1130, be
evolving into more of a Varangian guard--much as you suggest
would happen when various worlds might offer them support and
refit in exchange for protection.  The Vikings are those raiders
with enough organization, cohesiveness, and honor to actually be
reliable parties to such a contract.  The rippers and corsairs
are intrinsically too undependable; the few polities that would
contract with them would regret it.  This is why I saw the rip-
pers as all but vanished by 1130, the standard pirates (corsairs)
fading back to pre-war numbers, and the Vikings as finding a
place in the new, evolving political order.

One last comment; re: raiders arriving on hi-pop worlds.  I agree
that no smart one would ever go there directly.   But the
criminal mind is opportunistic and given to wish-fulfillment fan-
tasies.  I envisioned Indro\'s thought as something like this;

`IF I can disrupt routine trade so much that only Khavle\'s essen-
tials are being convoyed, perhaps they will be forced to cut
loose the worlds on the rimward extent of the Main as too ex-
pensive to make runs to.  Or, perhaps those worlds will break
away and I can gather tribute from them.
Either way, IF that occurs, then perhaps deeper rifts will arise
within Khavle\'s government itself.  Some parties are likely to
feel morally obligated to object to the abandonment of the lesser
planets, others will harden in their self-interest.  And where
there is division, there exists the opportunity to feed the
flames of dissent.  Where there is enough dissent, there can be
civil strife.  And where there is civil strife, there can be
chaos.  And if the chaos grows large enough, who knows?  Perhaps
I can make alliance with one of the factions, raid their rivals.
You never know . . . \'

(A note: none of the lesser worlds discussed are MEMBERS of the
KA, but rather part of the Main that provides the KA with a
larger economic arena and routine contact with more distant trad-
ing and security partners [Margaret, for instance].  If the
worlds along this path are abandoned by the KA entirely, then
raided, eventually eroded to the point where they are isolation-
alistically hostile to any interstellar transits through their
system [and offer an unbroken string of X-class port facilities],
then Indro has some reason to hope for larger success.  He would
hope that the KA would begin to suffer decreased external con-
tact, decreased trade in necessary high-tech items from the
nearest Safe, and a further depressed economy.  Indro would then
look for this weakening to result in political fracturing, which
he could capitalize on.)

This is of course a prime example of overblown ambition and wish-
fulfillment fantasy.  But consider the personality profiles of
the Indro and the other piratical individuals presented; they are
voracious and insatiable.  And some such individuals throughout
history (Atilla comes to mind) have been able to indulge those
fantasies with no grander a start than Indro has had.
Granted, Atilla was part of a people that he was able to rally to
him; Indro exists outside such a structure.  However, Indro
doesn\'t necessarily want to see or believe that--AND--if he\'s
right, if he can receive a letter of marque from one side of a
factional war on Khavle itself, perhaps he CAN manipulate events
to his favor and rise to precedence.  The last two centuries of
the Roman Empire offer some good examples of this kind of social
climbing over the bodies of the slain.

Once again, this reflects the difference between what I had in
mind with HT, and where it seems like things will be left, given
Traveller\'s upcoming jump forward into time.  First of all, your
opinion regarding the aftermath of HT--a balkanized area largely
comprised of polities that would then be involved in byzantine
dealings with competitive factions--is exactly what I had in
mind.  By 1130, Hard Times was to be winding down--meaning that
any polity which lasted through to this time had a good chance of
surviving.  The more years of indicated duration, the more stable
and sure its survival (note that this made Khavle a `borderline\'
case for survival).
However, I couldn\'t reveal this in HT, not without giving away
some of the changes I foresaw coming in the next stage (1130 and
after).  I felt that enough worlds and space would still be un-
claimed to present large reaches of Outland between the estab-
lished polities and factions.  I intended this mix of factors to
create an environment with elements of frontier, international
intrique, and opportunities for reclamation of `lost\' societies
and planets.  I foresaw the Vikings as mercenaries helping to
resist the factions.  I saw the factions sending out exploration
and salvage teams, competing for the unclaimed and/or abandoned
worlds during a re-expansion period.  Finally, all these forces
would have to band together against a common foe, and then more
synthesis, and then...

Sound like the ever-turbulent stewpot of the Marches from the
`old days\' of Traveller?  I guarantee you; any similarities you
see are wholly intentional.  Marc Miller came up with the best
formula for maintaining a perpetually interesting SF RPG environ-
ment, and my attitude is/was; if it works, don\'t fix it.  The
Rebellion stultified the play environment.  HT --and what I had
hoped might follow--was to free it up and return it to the
`golden era\' feeling of Traveller.  This may be what GDW will try
to accomplish with their new revision; I do not know.  I am not
in that decision-making loop.

I agree completely, since my foray into writing for games long
post-dates my involvement as player, but primarily, ref.
However, unlike a series of books authored by the same person,
games are almost inevitably patchwork quilts, where many hands
have been at work.  Changes in vision mean changes in direction,
and often, inconsistencies.  At the very least, a new steersman
may have to cut a few `internal consistency\' corners to get the
ship on the new, desired heading.  At the same time, it is gener-
ally sacrilege to hold up a hand and say `Oops! We did that last
thing wrong, so we\'re rewriting things.  Now everything will fit
correctly--so just ignore the last three modules.  Hope you don\'t
mind that we\'re tearing up a lot of what came before.\'
To some degree, I think this is what GDW may try to do with their
new revision.  I think it is equally motivated by a marketing im-
perative to appeal to a broader audience by making the game more
accessible.  I cannot speculate on their success in either
endeavor; I wish them luck.
But back to the point at hand; in the articles and materials I
have published re: MT, I have not only tried to entertain, but to
pull loose ends together.  In a sense, that was the raison de
etre of HT; to get MT out of what I felt was the quagmire of the
Rebellion and to illuminate some of the realities of Imperial
life and economic structure.

However, some realities had to be dispensed with, or at least,
made optional.  For instance, my personal assessment is that the
loss of life due to the disruption of the Rebellion would have
been MUCH more severe.  In fact, it would have been ghastly.  TOO
ghastly to put into a role playing game that has to please a gen-
eral audience.  If Traveller was a series of novels, I would have
stayed right on the money, damn the torpedoes.  But the commer-
cial realities of the gaming market are such that I felt that GDW
would have (rightly) declined to publish anything that reflected
a realistic level of planetary depopulation.  Instead, I took a
middle course; I allowed referees to do this themselves, if they
CHOSE to--by using the planetary decline tables.  A referee who
wants to avoid the stark and tragic probabilities of the
aftermath can modify die-rolls, or find explanations why each and
every population of a doomed world finds a way to escape or
endure.  On the other hand, brutally realistic refs need not
ameliorate the effects; indeed, they may wish to intensify
them...

I think you CAN use HT as is, as much as any other MT product.
In the days BEFORE MT--when the focus of existance was the Mar-
ches and the rest of the Imperium was some vague, off-stage
leviathan--that was different.  In my personal opinion, by
delivering to us players what we were clamoring for--a full ex-
plication of the Imperium and its territories--Traveller may have
come perilously close to undoing itself.  With everything
revealed, there was no mysterious `quantity\' from which we could
derive hyoptheses that would explain away inconsistencies in the
game.  Anything unusual in the Marches could have simply been
dismissed as a local aberration.  But once we got a look at the
whole elephant, we had the basis for poking holes in the underly-
ing suppositions (or lack thereof).

So now we have to go back and fill in holes.  I tried to do that
with HT and still take the game in the direction that GDW was in-
terested in going (at the time I made my product proposal).  I\'m
not saying the module was a shining success, but I will maintain
that it leaves things better off than they were before. I felt
that Traveller had lost direction entirely and couldn\'t seem to
extricate itself from the Rebellion because it lacked a new place
to go.

Of course there are still holes to fill, and may always be.  I
feel that Traveller has steered a careful course away from hu-
man/cybernetic interface technologies, cloning and other biologi-
cal sciences.  In many ways, this is wise, because to introduce
ALL the probable technological ramifications concommitant with TL
13-15 would produce a universe we might find hard to recognize at
all.  And if the universe becomes so alien that we poor,
retrograde 20th centuriers don\'t recognize it, how can we then
referee it or play it?  As with all SF and fantasy, the final
threshold is the beholder\'s capacity for recognition.  In a game,
that threshold is lower than in a novel.  In a novel, we need
merely follow the author\'s guidance and be willing to believe.
But in a game, we have to be able to manipulate concrete algo-
rithms that dictate events; in an RPG, reality is not an
autocratic creation of imagination, but a moderated result that
all participants can usually understand.
Whoa!  Let\'s bring that back to earth!  I\'m just saying that the
further into the future we go, the more we must accept that our
vision is imperfect, that we are compromising and not represent-
ing all the changes that would exist.  And if we try to represent
all the changes, we can no longer rely on any of our intuitive,
common-sense knowledge; things are simply too different.
But these concerns are immaterial in the minds of most gamers.
Most gamers want flash and excitement and ENOUGH plausibility for
them to become involved in the experience.  More than that is, to
them, an academic and pointless exercise.  Who cares if cyber
technology of level x would so change society that the players\'
value structures are hopelessly outdated and inappropriate?  The
only thing that matters is how colorful and NEAT it is; leave the
logical extrapolation for someone else and pass me that
neuroblaster, oh my little droogie . . .
I gravitated towards Traveller because it tried to encompass both
fun and logical extrapolation, but it has always shown signs of
its mixed pedigree.  I don\'t think one can purge all the in-
consistencies from the game; the best we can do is try to find
plausible explanations that hold the seams together enough.  I
write this trying to further share my efforts in that regard--but
just because I wrote HT doesn\'t mean that my answers are best or
right.  True, Marc Miller liked them better than anything else
coming down the pike, and we were in very close step regarding
the nature of the Imperium and what was happening in it.  But I
never felt that Marc was selfish or narrow in his view of the
possibilities inherent in Traveller.  To him, those areas that
were unaddressed represented possibilities for new development,
not errors.  He believed--as I do--that in the process of finding
the explanation, something very interesting and fun can be creat-
ed.  What you see here--and in HT--is my attempt to do just that.

Sorry for all the rambling responses, Hans, but I think it is im-
possible to talk about the fiction presented in Traveller without
addressing the issue of what is going on in terms of the actual
mechanics and considerations of game design.  Quite simply, there
will never be a perfectly thought-out game, because that would be
a work of art--and gaming has become a business, where the empha-
sis is on Product.  Personally, I find that sad, but then again,
I\'m a gaming dinosaur.  I simply try to live with in-
consistencies, try to find rational (if occasionally unusual) ex-
planations for them, and enjoy the whole.  With HT, I hoped to
try to pull a bunch of thoughts and explanations together, make a
fun environment that also re-empowered individual players and
perhaps suggest a workable model of Imperial society (which in
turn might illustrate why it was so susceptible to disruption).

***********************************************************************
SUMMARY
Variant starships combat rules. Fighters got more chance to knock out a 
BB if they are in large numbers. Ships or fighters with armor-120 can 
be now be penetrated by weapons smaller than factor-T.
***********************************************************************
 
This is the second draft of the starship combat rules I have generated. 
Those who have my first draft will notice some changes, but the changes 
is mainly additions to the rules I originally made. The damage 
resolution is drastically changed, but the principle is the same. I 
felt that some small cosmetic changes was necessary to get the rules to 
work somewhat more smoothly.
 
In general these rules are intended to make smaller craft able to 
battle a larger craft. What the use is a SDB if it can\'t make a dent in 
an invading force? Without this ability SDB\'s are reduced to pirate and 
smuggling control.
 
With this document you should have gotten:
- - Blank damage record form for own use.
- - Filled out damage record form of the Heavy Escort listed in            
  this document.
 
The to hit task. 
      The to hit task is not changed it work good enough as it is. For 
those who hate to roll for each battery may optionally roll once for 
all bearing batteries of one weapon type. Subtract the difficulty value 
to hit from the roll and multiply the remainder with 10%. This 
indicates how many batteries hit.
If a roll was 12 regardless of DM\'s it is counted as a hit with 10% of 
the batteries hit. This condition can exist when the attacker can only 
hit on 13+ on 2D, excluding all DM\'s  
Example:The hit task is difficult, 11+. The attacker rolls 15. 
(15-11)*10%=40% of the batteries hit.
When applying the 40% to the number of firing batteries, round up.
 
The to penetrate task. 
Penetration: These tasks are not changed, but if you are using the 
above mentioned rule of combining the the batteries of one weapon into 
one task. The defender may then combine all the defensive batteries, 
which can bear, against the attack. When you are using this rule find 
the ratio of offensive vs defensive batteries and consult the following 
table.
Off/Def
4:1 gives DM+3     The DM\'s given here is added directly
3:1 gives DM+2     to the attackers task roll. Ratios
2:1 gives DM+1     which exceeds 4:1 or 1:4 is treated as
1:1 gives DM 0     4:1 or 1:4 respectively.
1:2 gives DM-1
1:3 gives DM-2
1:4 gives DM-3
 
To find out how many weapons penetrated, use the same procedure as in 
the hit task. This procedure can also be used against screens, but the 
ratio DM from the table above is not included.
If a roll of 12 on 2D regardless of DM\'s it is counted as a 
penetration, with 10% of the weapons penetrating defenses. This 
condition exists when penetration is only possible with a roll of 13+ 
on 2D, excluding all DM\'s
 
1. Damage: 
In the construction rules you calculate hitpoints to the different 
components in a starship, but they are not used in the combat rules. In 
this set of rules we are going to use hitpoints, but not the hitpoints 
calculated from the rules in Referee\'s Manual.
The weapons does damage equal to their UCP value. Thus a factor-A 
weapon does 10 points of damage. Nuclear or anti-matter weapons does 4 
and five times that in damage respectively.
Damage points to the different components can be found in the tables in 
section 8.
With this document you should have gotten a blank damage record form, 
to record the damage capacity on your crafts. This form is free to copy 
for your own use. If you have not gotten this form, write to me and I 
will send you some copies.
 
Hull: Each time a interior hit is scored one third of the hit damage is 
given to the hull (drop fractions). Armor is reduced with one for each 
critical hit or for each exceptional hit. If the weapon scoring that 
hit was a UCP-1 weapon the hull take the effect on 5+ on 1D instead of 
the interior. With UCP-2 weapons one hit is given to the hull on a roll 
of 3+ on 1D, if this roll fails both hits goes to internal hits table.
 
Power: Damage in the old system was counted in tens of percent. In this 
system it is changed a bit. The damage is divided into hitpoints per 
10% of operating powerplant
For each 10% loss of power, reduce agility with two, until it drops to 
zero.
When 50% of power is lost, spinal mount cannot fire.
When 60% are lost, the ship may either chose to use maneuver drive or 
energy weapons in a combat round turn, but not both.
When 70% are lost, screens are are inoperative, except sandcasters. 
Maneuver is reduced to zero.
When 80% are lost, grav plates and inertial compensators is powerless. 
No weapons may fire.
When 90% are lost, life support fails to work properly.
 
Maneuver: In the old system a hit reduced the maneuver with 1, 2 or 3. 
In this system the maneuver drive may hang in a bit longer. Hitpoints 
are given per maneuver gee.
Jump: As maneuver.
Computer: Weapons with UCP of 1-4 gives Computer-1, UCP 5-9 Computer-2, 
UCP A+ Computer-3. If the computer is a fib model, radiation hits is 
ignored. On exceptional success the computer factor is reduced with one 
additional point.
Crew: As computer.
Sensors: As computer hits.
 
Weapons: As computer hits. If there is only one battery, reduce the UCP 
of the battery with the appropriate number.
Screens: As weapon hits.
 
Critical hits is per the standard rules. But at least one critical hit 
is received if the armor factor is large enough to nullify the critical 
hit.
 
2. Radiation hits: 
When a weapon which does radiation damage scores a hit, 25% of the 
hitpoints is diverged to the radiation hit table. A factor-9 nuclear 
missilebay does 9 points in radiation damage ((9*4)*.25). This damage 
value equals the UCP damage value of unmodified weapon. So a factor-9 
radiation hit against the crew kills 2 crew segments.
 
3. Armor penetration procedure.
In the standard rules, there is no hope that a low UCP weapon can 
penetrate or do any type of damage to a well armored craft. In this 
variant there is a slight chance that fighters and SDB\'s can make a 
dent in the armor, and possibly a scratch inside a BB.
To penetrate armor:
Routine, OFF=Weapon UCP DM, DEF=Armor DM, Confrontation.
Referee: On a natural 12 not including DM\'s, a penetration is 
automatic. Weapon DM is UCP/3 (drop fraction) and armor DM is (armor 
value-40)/5 (drop fraction). If the current armor value to the 
defending craft is below 40 it will be +1 DM in attackers favor for 
each 5 step below 40. Meson guns does not roll this task. If they have 
managed to penetrate the configuration, they just pass through the 
armor and explode inside.
Meson gun hits does not damage the hull, because its shot explodes 
inside the craft.
 
4 Damage tables 2D:
     Surface          Interior             Radiation
 1   No effect        No effect            No effect
 2   Weapon           Screen               Weapon
 3   Fuel             Sensor               Weapon
 4   Maneuver         Computer             Crew
 5   Weapon           Power plant          Computer
 6   Maneuver         Crew                 Sensor
 7   Weapon           Power plant          Crew
 8   Weapon           Crew                 Computer
 9   Fuel             Sensor               Weapon
10   Weapon           Jump                 Weapon
11   Interior         Fuel leak            Sensor
12   Interior         Critical             Crew
13   Critical         Critical             Critical
DM\'s: 
UCP 1-4 DM-1
UCP 5-9 no DM
UCP A+ DM+1
+1 if nuclear, anti-matter weapon or spinal mount.
- -1 if active black globe.
As by the standard rules the spinal mounts get one additional roll for 
each UCP factor above 9. The number of rolls are also reduced by one 
per every third armor point above 40, but at least one roll is allowed. 
This does not affect meson guns.
 
Blackglobes: The blackglobes absorbs a percentage of the damage value 
of the weapon according to its flicker rate. I.e. a blackglobe on 40% 
flicker absorbs 40% of the hitpoints before they take effect. 
Blackglobe overload is by the standard rules. Per the standard rules so 
gives each 10% flicker rate 6 levels of armor, thus making it possible 
to have more than 120 armor points.
 
5. Exceptional success:
That is achieved when a success+4 is rolled including DM\'s on the hit 
roll. This means that the weapon does 1 point more damage, and the 
armor factor is reduced with one point.
 
6. Effects on Hull inoperative:
When the hull inoperative level is reached, the craft is not dead yet. 
But the end is imminent. So the effects on hull inoperative is  
follows:
- -The craft is restricted to 1G maneuver.
- -Hull is breached.
- -Agility drops to 0.
- -Atmosphere entry is prohibited.
- -Spinal mount may not be fired.
- -Heading changes is severely limited due to stress.
- -Fighters or other crafts may not be retrieved. Although they may be 
launched.
- -Rapid Launch Facilities are inoperative, crafts have to be launched 
 without them.
- -Fuel leak
- -Entering jumpspace prohibited.
- -All hits are increased with one point of damage.
Example: If a crew hit kills 2 sections normally, it would kill 3 
sections now. This effect is cumulative with the exceptional hit rule. 
Hull hits are excepted from increase of damage by the hull inop 
condition.
 
7. Fuel leak:
Clay Bush "Scott Olson (and others before him) have pointed to "Fuel 
Tanks Shattered" result as being an effective kill. Its frequency 
affects both combat and post battle repair and salvage. Should it be 
made less likely? Tied to hull damage?"
 
In my first document on these rules I included fuel tanks shattered, 
and they got quite frequent rolled on the table. So when Clay wrote and 
pointed this out I decided to change it. In this set of rules the fuel 
is lost in segments of days. Jump fuel is also included, if there is 
some present in the tanks. How many days worth of jumpfuel calculated 
in powerplant fuel there is on a ship depends on jump distance and 
powerplant fuel usage.
In fuel leak, there is lost one day worth of fuel per turn. In 1D+1 
turns. If the hull inoperative is reached. It leaks 2D days worth of 
fuel per turn in 1D+2 turns and then the fuel loss is halved from there 
until empty.

To find destroyed or and including electronic circuit protection value. 
Do as stated in maneuver hit table.
 
Computer:One box per computer model number.
Crew:    One box per crew segment. There is only 334 boxes, so if        
         you need more, you have to use partial checking of the          
         boxes. Just like in the equipment forms in Traveller            
         Digest.
Weapons: One box per battery. If there is only one battery of            
         that weapon, one box per UCP level.
Screens: One box per UCP level of screen.
Armor:   One box per armor point.
Sensors: One box per sensor.
  
9. Filling out a damage record form: 
To this I will use the example craft listed below. There should be a 
copy of a readily filled out form of this craft with this document. A 
good idea would be having the UCP stats of the craft on the front side 
of the form, and having the damage record form on the other side. And 
covering that with some transparent film, so that it can be re-used, 
without wearing the form out too soon.

Comments:a) The frozen watch crew can replace 10 lost crew segments,
         this makes the craft able to withstand great crew loss.
         b) The sickbays are made of one large stateroom each.
		       The crew sleeps in bunks while the officers and the medics
         sleeps in small staterooms. This was done to increase the 
         cargo space on the craft. However the crew got rather large
         lounge area in the aft and in the middle of the craft.
         This craft is often used as the flagship in an escort fleet.
         Its great size and armament makes it a formidable opponent.
  
Armor      :The craft got 70 armor points, so we cross of the remaining  
            50 armor boxes. 
 
Hull       :Being a 20 000 displacement ton craft it got 20 inoperative 
            boxes. So we cross off the remaining boxes. On the
            destroyed box rows we cross off all but 50 boxes.
 
Maneuver   :Checking in the table above at 20 000 displacement tonnage
            each maneuver gee row is going to have 7 boxes. The craft
            got electronic circuit protection, so we multiply 7 with
            1.5 and gets 10.5 which rounds to 11. On maneuver 1 and 2
            we cross of all boxes but 11. on the remaining 4 rows we
            cross off all the boxes. To get the destroyed value we 
            multiply 7 with 2 for the number of maneuver gee, and then
            multiply that number with 2 to get the final number which
            is 42.
 
Jump       :Same procedure here as maneuver drive.
 
Powerplant :The powerplant got 1472 damage points before inop level is
            reached. This value includes electronic circuit protection,  
            so we have to divide this number on 1.5. Then we get 981. 
            On the table above this indicates that the powerplant got 3
            damage points per 10% step. The procedure is then just as 
            in maneuver drive and jump drive above. 
 
Weapons    :Here we just fills in the type of weapon and the number of
            batteries and factor for each weapon. We cross off all
            boxes but one box for each battery. If you only have one
            battery of a single weapon, leave one box per UCP value 
            unchecked. If you got more batteries that boxes of one
            type, you have to let one box represent more that one
            battery.
  
Screens    :We note down which screen that row of boxes represent, and   
       leaves one box unchecked per UCP factor of the weapon. For
            the Mesonscreen and Nucleardamper this is 7 boxes each.
 
 Computer   :Here there is one box per computer model number. Just
             check off the excess boxes. 
 
Sensors    :Just as computer 
 
Crew       :The craft got 20 crew segments, so we cross off all boxes
            but 20. 
 
Fuel       :Here one box represents one day of fuel usage. This also
            includes jumpfuel. To include the jumpfuel we have to 
            convert it to powerplant fuel, and find out how long the
            powerplant can run on this fuel. To do this we must find 
            out how much of the fuel tankage is jumpfuel. We do this by
            looking up in the referee\'s manual. Here we find that a
            craft of this size with jump 3 has 800 jump units.
            Multiplying 800 with 13.5 we find the size of the 
            jumpdrive. Multiplying this with 5 and we find the amount
            of fuel which is 54000Kl. This leaves 95399Kl to powerplant
            fuel. Dividing this on 30 we finds that the powerplant use
            3180Kl fuel per day. By dividing 54000 on 3180 we find that
            the jumpfuel can be used as powerplant fuel for 17 days. 
            The total fuel days is then 47 days. Before a ship is 
            entering battle, the referee should determine if there are
            jumpfuel onboard or not. There might also be less fuel than
            the standard 30 days, due to previous usage or loss.  
 
10. Optional sensor rules: 
Make all sensor tasks one level less difficult if the target is in the
adjacent hex. 
 
Make active sensor tasks one level more difficult:
 - If target is within a gas giant.
 - When attempted through a hex where a nuclear missile exploded.
 - If target uses jamming. 
 
Neutrino detections:
 - If target\'s EMLevel is fain, give DM -1 to neutrino scans.
 - If target\'s EMLevel is strong, give DM +1 to neutrino scans. 
 
Densiometer detection:
 - If target is small, give DM -1 to densiometer scans.
 - If target is large, give DM +1 to densiometer scans.
 - Increase detection task difficulty by one level if detection is 
   attempted through a planet or moon with size 5+ or though a
   planetoid belt. 
 
11. Fighter squadrons.
A fighter squadron consist of 8 to 10 crafts. The fighters in a given
squadron may be of different designs, but they must have the same
agility.I have found it cumbersome to roll on the hit location table
when a fighter squadron is hit. So this rule simplifies this greatly.I
decided to lend a rule from FASA\'s Leviathan (with modifications). Add
up all the hull inop values of the crafts in the squadron, and note it
down on a piece of paper. Then add up the hull destroyed number and
note this down behind the first number. The first number then reflects
how much damage the squadron can take before it is inoperative, while
the other number tell when it will be killed. The squadron takes full
weapon UCP hit. Hits by nuclear or anti-matter rounds subtract 25% from
the total damage. Hull is not damaged by radiation. When the battle is
over, distribute the hits randomly among crafts in the squadron. 
 
12. Firing arcs. 
Originally there is no firing arc defined by the rules, except for the
limit of weapons who can bear at a single target. I would like to
introduce a simple rule to change this a bit.Spinal mounts may only
fire in the hex side arc of the crafts direction of travel. Spinal
mounts may not fire at fighters.If all bearing batteries fires at a
target in one hex side arc, none of the other batteries of this weapon
may not fire at any other target in the same arc. 
 
13. Boarding, the quick and dirty way. 
In small scale space combat, boarding can be performed on pre-drawn
deck plans. But in large scale space combat this will be cumbersome.
The entire boarding may be resolved in one task.
To capture a ship by boarding:
Difficult,Off=tactics,qualityDM,DEF=tactics,QualityDM,RatioDM,confronta
tion
Referee: If the ship troops have been killed on the defending craft,
50% of the remaining crew may then work as ship troops, but the
difficulty is then reduced to Routine.
  
Troop qualityDM     Die        Off/Def RatioDM
Recruit      0       1           4:1    DM-3
Regular      1      2-3          3:1    DM-2
Veteran      2      4-5          2:1    DM-1
Elite        3       6           1:1    DM 0
                                 1:2    DM+1
                                 1:3    DM+2
                                 1:4    DM+3
  
If the troop quality of a ship is not known, roll a die on the above
table. If there is more than one ship who is boarding a defender, use
the average troop quality DM, round to the closest whole number. 
If the capture of the craft was successful, roll once on critical hit
table. This reflects internal damage taken in the combat. Reroll if 
ship vaporize is the result, but if that is rolled again, the result is
not ignored. If ship vaporize is the end result, all ship troops
participating in the boarding is lost. Crafts in same or the adjacent
hex roll once on the exterior table with weapon UCP strength equal
displacement/100 for same hex. Displacement/1000 for adjacent hex. The
result will be at least one. The displacement is of the exploding ship.
There is no extra roll on the hit table for UCP levels beyond 9. 
  
Troop loss table.
Attackers successlevel       Off loss         Defloss 
Extreme failure                80%        20%, 1 crew segment 
Failure                        60%        40%, 3 crew segments 
Success                        40%        60%, 5 crewsegments
Extreme success                20%        80%, 1D+7 crew segments
 
If the result is failure for the attacker, he may try again next round,
if he wish. Troops from more than one attacking ship may participate in
the boarding. If PC\'s participate in this type of combat, they will
have to roll a survival task.
 
To survive a quick and dirty combat:
Difficulty,Skill,Stat,Hazard
Referee: The difficulty depends on attackers task roll.
  
Attackers success      Difficulty     Hazard            
Extreme Failure        Formidable     Fateful,Hazardous
Failure                Difficult      Hazardous
Success                Routine        Fateful
Extreme Success        Simple 
 
This table is used unmodified if the PC\'s are the attackers, If they
are the defenders you have to turn it up side down. If the attacking
NPC had a success on his task, the survival task roll difficulty for
the PC\'s would then be Difficult. The PC may choose any combat skill he 
wish, and a stat that can be used with that skill. 
Example: Tactics, Int or Laser weapons, Dex. 
 
14. Remote fire guidance. 
In some occasions a craft may loose all its sensors. This will make the
craft effectively blind. But there is possible to get guidance from a
second craft. A ship who has detected the enemy may radio the other
ship(s) about the positions of enemy and friendly crafts. If this is
done, give the blind firing unit a DM-1.This tactic can be used in
ambush, where one ship in the fleet acts as a picket. It constantly
tells where the enemy ships are until a desired fire solution is
reached, where the attackers fires simultaneously. This type of tactic
is useful in belts and gas giants, where the waiting ships hides while
the picket searches for targets. This type of tactic is typical for
todays wet navy. 
 
Last words.
I hope you readers like these rules. I have tried to make the rules
simple and understandable as possible. If you have any questions or
suggestions to changes, I would like to hear them. It costs nothing but
a stamp.

     Sarion stood in a dress suit outside a door from which there
could  just  be heard the buzz of conversation. He paced  up  and
down,  worried. A door opened and Ynno hesitantly stepped  in.  A
look of relief crossed Sarion\'s face.
     "Ynno!  Where have you been?" He waved his  hands.  "They\'re
all here. Where were you? Clare has been in a tizzy."
     "Is Bethula here?" he asked fidgeting with his neck tie.
     "Yes  she\'s here. And stop that" he said, slapping his  hand
away. "You look fine."
     "I  was  worried. I thought she might not turn up.  I  don\'t
know what to say."
     Sarion shook his shoulders and growled at him. Ynno  blinked
several  times.  Sarion let him go and  with  deliberate  motions
pinned  a badge onto him. "None of that now." He opened the  door
and  ushered  him  in.  "You were  right  about  her  charm",  he
whispered in his ear. "But mind Ms. Didascalos, with her."
     "Not Battleaxe?" Ynno whispered back.
     "Apparently they\'ve taken her out again and dusted her  off.
Hello,  Mr. Gorgreflen!" he said to a delegate who wandered  into
them. They made small talk for a while and them moved on,  taking
glasses  from  a passing tray. Ynno took a small gulp.  "Easy  on
that" cautioned Sarion. "It\'s strong."
     "I reckon I need it", said Ynno.
     "Yes,  well  hold  tight" He elbowed  his  way  between  two
conversations to where their quarry stood surveying the  company.
"Hello  Ms.  Didascalos  and welcome back. And..."  he  made  the
pretence of peering at her nametag, "Ms. Myragail. You\'re new  to
the business?"
     "We\'ve  just  taken her on", said Ms. Didascalos.  "We  have
every confidence in her." Bethula smiled modestly.
     "Well then", continued Sarion, "I must introduce you to  our
Imperial  Specialist. Ynno, come here. This is Ynno Hollis.  This
is  Ms.  Bethula  Myragail and I believe  you  already  know  Ms.
Didascalos."  They  all mumbled acknowledgements to  each  other.
"Actually,  Ms.  Didascalos, there is someone here  I  think  you
would  do  well  to  meet;  our  newest  member  of  staff.   Her
speciality  may  be  of particular  interest  to  you..."  Sarion
carefully trailed her away leaving Ynno with Bethula.
     "Well,  um"  started  Ynno.  "The  government  provides   an
excellent  advisory service which you can do no ill  to  consult.
There\'s coordinaion with other companies and well... I believe  I
saw  you  at the conference. I wanted to introduce myself  but  I
didn\'t  get the chance." She smiled and nodded, looking over  his
shoulder.  "I  was watching your cues. You know your  field  very
well..."
     "I\'ve had experience", she said a bit distractedly.
     "Yes,  well,  my training was, umm...  Oh,  you\'re  drinking
water.  You should really try some of the wine. It is really  top
quality."
     She  looked  at  him for almost the first  time  and  smiled
warmly.  Ynno\'s  eyes became vacant and it felt as if  his  heart
stopped. "Thank you, perhaps I shall. But first I must  disengage
Ms. Didascalos from old companions and remind her of the business
of  the  evening. Your pardon?" Her voice was smooth  in  perfect
Imperial emphasis and intonation.
     "Always, Madam", he replied just as correctly. And she left.
Sarion found him a few minutes later, standing there watching the
wine  swirl in his nearly empty glass; a silly expression on  his
face.
     "Ynno. What happened?" Ynno looked up and giggled. "What did
you say?", he repeated.
     "I can\'t remember", he chortled.
     "Well what did she say?"
     "I can\'t remember that either! She, she, _was_."
     "Come  on,  we  can\'t let her see you  a  simpering  idiot!"
Sarion  led him back through the staff entrance into  a  hallway.
Ynno  tossed back the last of his wine and held the glass to  the
light. He laughed out loud.
     "She  is  the  stars  of night! She is  the  diadem  of  the
Emperor\'s  crown! She is the dew of morning!" He turned  a  quick
circle  around  Sarion.  "She  has looked on  me  and  I  can  do
anything!"  He threw the glass over his head and caught  it  with
the other hand, laughing wildly.
     "Are  you smitten or are you smitten?" He tousled his  hair.
"What do you think she feels?"
     "I don\'t know, I don\'t care. I have looked in the eyes of  a
god!"  They  embraced firmly and Sarion staggered a  bit  at  the
unnatural weight. Some of the cheer left his eyes. "I don\'t think
I can go back in there."
     "Certainly  not in this state!" Ynno giggled and  threw  his
wine glass into the air again, missing this time. They both broke
into  peals of laughter. A member of the staff stuck  their  head
out  the  kitchen door and looked disapprovingly at  them  for  a
moment.  They  quickly  sobered for a  moment  before  collapsing
against the wall when it disappeared. Sarion eventually recovered
himself. "You. You float home. I shall have to go back inside  to
hold  up the department\'s end." Ynno looked thanks into his  eyes
and wandered off. Sarion caught up with him and turned him in the
right direction.
     Back  inside  Clare was waiting discreetly at the  door.  "I
kept  her occupied as long as I could. She just pounced  on  poor
Mr. Gorgreflen though."
     "Well our lover boy has drifted off."
     "Are you sure he\'ll make it home?"
     "He  should  be  all right. He\'s higher  than  the  Aerostat
though."
     "Perhaps I should walk him home."
     "Nah.  We\'ve  got to manage our lovely guests. If  the  wine
doesn\'t get them."
     Clare  still looked doubtful but put on her smile again  and
they both mixed.

Brian,
     Please be so kind as to send the following to the TML:

     Scott Kellogg
          Re: your offer to GDW, I accept on the company\'s behalf. I do
not have internet access (I have to work through Herr Borich\'s kind
ness), so if you would prepare a summary of the leading suggestions
I will see to it that they are read anc considered by the Traveller: The
New Era design team (of which I am, alas, not a member...I have other duties
these days).

     Steve Higginbotham: I thought I did pretty good spelling your name...
especially considering that I was not (and am not) referring to to
written matter. Remind me to tell you how often my name is mispelled. I
realize that you are mostly in jest in referring to all GDW employees as
idiots, and I hereby take you up on your offer to help out with the
New Era revision, with the following proviso: Communicating with you through
TML/Borich is too slow...and I do not have internet access (and am not likely
to get it inthe near future. I need a land mail address, fax number, or some
common BBS over which we can exchange materials. When the design team needs
information (physics, dialectic materialism, etc.), they will want an
answer fast.

 Hans Rancke-Madsen: The note to Steve H applies to you also: can you get me a
fax number, mail address, or a common BBS? We\'ll be happy to have you help out.
 This applies to anybody else who wants to get their 2 cents in or help us
out with "reality checks" and the like. We gotta have \'em done fast or they are
useless to us.

     Wildstar: Our virus idea predates the "Macho Women with Guns"
product you quoted. Greg POrter, the publisher, says his notion was inspired by
Drexler\'s _Engines of Creation_ (which makes the little suckers nanites,
not a virus...although a case could be made that the two are pretty much
the same in the end).
 Nuff said?

STEALING DONUTS, part 1
Late 1117 through Early 1118

There just isn\'t that much to do in jump.  You stand some watches, you
do some drills, run some diagnostics.  This paticular crew, like many
others, got a little restless.  Mind you, MC and Thilia got into a
computer prank war which ended after MC shot five slugs into the
bulkhead.  And the Zhoe melted MC\'s boots (not that MC hadn\'t been
asking for it...).  Rocky and MC booby-trapped Sean\'s solamani
bagpipes.  Oh, yes, and then there was the time most everyone went
after Gertie\'s donuts...

It started on the first jump on the way home from Gushemege.  Someone
did a smart thing making Gertie mission commander, since she was the
only person probably keeping the various hotheads on the crew from
killing each other.  Since she was in charge, however, it took people
a while to get over being wary of her.  After all, most people do find
an ex-cop over 2 meters tall rather intimidating...

Understand now, Gertie is a big girl with a lot of energy and stamina,
but even the Gerties of the universe hit the middle-age slump in
metabolism.  Gertie\'s been fighting the battle of the pastry roll for
a few years now, and so far the pastries have been gaining on her.
She just likes those donuts too much.

Now, none of this escaped the crew.  By the time we got out of
Gushemege, everyone knew about Gertie\'s attempts to cut back on the
snacking and to exercise more.  And you know how some people are a tad
touchy about losing weight...  Well, the marines on the boat decided
to help out a bit.

Gertie would get up every morning and make straight for the box of
pastries and donuts, piling at least five or six on a plate as her
breakfast.  The marines decided to help her reduce her intake.  Here
Gertie would be munching on a donut, distracted by conversation or
reading; while she was otherwise occupied, a marine would snake across
the deckplates and attempt to steal one or more donuts without getting
caught.  For the first few days, Gertie was clueless.  She actually
thought she was losing track of the number of donuts she ate.

It was inevitable for Gertie to catch on.  One morning Gertie reached
for a donut at the same time one of the marines was.  The poor sap was
slammed up against the bulkhead with an arm lock before he knew what
was happening.  He was on the floor in a half-crouch when Gertie\'s
hand contacted his, and she actually picked him up off the floor and
twisted him in the air before flattening him against the wall.  

	"Only helping myself to a donut, Ma\'am," he squeaked.
	
One blond eyebrow lifted, which of course, having his face mushed into
the bulkhead the marine couldn\'t see.

	"I see," she said with a half-smile.  "It might be healthier
to ask next time."
	"Yes, Ma\'am," he squeaked, "can I go now, Ma\'am?"
	"Oh I think so," and she took him by collar, dragged him over
to where Morris was sitting, and dropped him at Morris\'s feet.
	"Sargeant, I think this might be yours."
	Morris looked down at this poor sap, with a glance of contempt
for a botched attempt, and replied: "I\'m afraid so, Ma\'am.  I\'ll take
care of him."  And then, with a great flourish, Morris took a bite out
of the donut which he had stolen not a few seconds earlier from
Gertie\'s plate.  
	Gertie gave him the ol\'eyebrow; and as she turned away, she
was heard muttering under her breath: "I\'ll get you for this,
Norris..."

********************************************************************

Gertie\'s a good sport, actually.  Someone put Rocky up to stealing
some of Gertie\'s donuts.  Enter one racoonid, wearing that wierd suit
of his, walking up-side-down on the ceiling.  Down came the gapple hook,
up came the donut, and out flashed Gertie\'s hand, grabbing the donut
before it got out of reach.

	"Do you mind?"  Two blond eyebrows frowned.
	"Just getting a donut <chitter>"
	"Well, the box is over there on the counter - go get your own,
fuzztail."
	"But yours were <chitter> closer, Gertie."  

(Ever see a racconid try to play innocent?  Well, it doesn\'t work
well.  Racoonids are lousy liars.)

	"Uh huh, Rocky, and you just happened to have a grapple hook
in your pocket by chance?  Right."  Gertie detached her donut from the
hook, moved the plate of donuts inside the bend of her elbow, and went
back to reading.  Anyone listening, however, would have heard her
mutter under her breath: "I\'ll get you for this, Norris."

********************************************************************

The donut heists got more interesting once the big-guns like Sean and
MC got involved, but we\'ll save that for next time...

    'body' => 'Hi folks,

I am honored that Loren Wiseman asked for our help.  Hot damn!  :-)

I\'m going on vacation starting tomorrow.  I expect to be back around the
17th.  Now, Mark pointed out that perhaps we don\'t need an coordinator,
and I am not really fully coordinated enough to take on the task of
coordinating it ALL.

But, what I would suggest is this:
I feel comfortable, mainly with craft design (obviously!)  What I intend to
do is to review the stuff that has been said about tweaking the MegaTrav
system up to something that works well.

Basically, What *I* intend to give them is a step by step by step review of
the craft design system.  *I* think that the MegaTrav system is basically
quite good (else why should I spend so much time woking on it?), but some
systems need to be clarified, rules need to be enforced, and explained.
Also the system needs to be made consistant.

This is the area I feel most competant to try and work in.  Believe me I
would LOVE to coordinate such an effort.  (when I get back)  (I\'ll have
35+ hrs solo driving time to think about it.)  I feel that a coordinator
while not absolutely necessary, will certainly help.  The crew of GDW
is gonna have limited patience listening to 300+ people all giving
contradictory views on the TML.

What *I* would like to do would be to have folks send their ideas on craft
design to me.  I\'ll go through it and pick up the best ideas and try to
incorporate as many as I can into a coherant write up for them to read.

Now, everybody who has used the craft system has opinions about it.  I may
have missed something.  I know there are people out there who are much more
competant at some designs than I.  I would LOVE to hear from George on
water craft design comments.

Computers:
One area we all know that is in need of touching up is computers.  Nobody
has a good answer for what a model 1 computer is.  Nobody knows how a
robot brain compairs to a Model 1.  That is a big problem with the design
system.  I however am the original Computer-0 guy.  I think that perhaps
we should try to hammer together a system to try to equate robot brain
design to the various Model 1\'s, 2\'s, 9\'s etc.  I would love to hear some
input from the *REAL* Computer Jocks out there.   (Mark?  James?)

Since the virus is coming into the game, it will be important that what
computers that *DO* exist will be usable and realistic.  This also, may
allow us to introduce some cyber-punkish computer stuff into Trav.  This
may or may not be desirable.  I don\'t know, but it is something we might
look into.

It seems to me that while I am competant enough to put together a summary
of craft design stuff, I am not well aquainted enough to go through all
of traveller and find all the strengths and weaknesses.  I know *ZERO* 
about trade and commerce stuff, while Steve, Hans, Wildstar and others
really know the stuff.  I suspect there are rather a few of us who could
take on the task of coming up with a definiteive critique of various
aspects of Traveller.  Let\'s play to our strengths:

I would suggest that if someone feels competant enough to coordinate some
aspect, please volunteer to do so.  Then we can get our best people working
in their best areas on some tough problems.

Let\'s GO!

You know, I still have a slight problem with this.  My gut feel is that,
given the current design rules, unarmored or lightly armored vessels will
be favored over \'bricks\', with meson guns being the decisive armament.  _If_
that is true, then SDBs will have something to do because it won\'t be cost
effective to provide complete protection against them.

)-:  I\'d like to see those numbers used for consistency\'s sake.  In my personal
opinion, the current rules are at a \'bad\' level of abstraction.  I\'d be willing
to go in either direction--less detail ala High Guard, or more detail in some
attempt to provide compatibility from vehicles on up.

This is a pretty crude approximation.  I could send you a bundle of combat
and non-combat starship designs to give you a database to develop a "realistic"
profile from.

Radiation death for the crew should possibly be slow acting, and if we liked
some of the medical expansion stuff from TD, isn\'t is reversible damage?

I don\'t suppose it would be useful enough to the overall game to add in a
fuel compartmentalization factor in the design stage?  More compartments=
more mass=more cost=less fuel lost per puncture...Given the assumption that
such compartmentalization _does_ now exist and that we just ignore it for the
sake of simplicity, we should also make the chance of actual loss of fuel from
a hit proportional to the amount of fuel currently being carried. (A d10 based
saving thow would probably be acceptable, especially in TNE when they switch
over to a d20 based game system)

I see no indication of a time/distance scale in this draft.  If we remain with
20 minute turns, which seems desirable to me (gutting the technology and
having combat at a few hundred kms seems like a bad idea), then a ship should 
be able to rotate (Without changing its vector!!!) to any heading for firing
purposes.  Since I like to keep Traveller a little more realistic than the
average "WWII in Space" game, I think that it is important to maintain the 
notion of vector velocity with the resulting differentiation between the 
direction of travel and where the nose is pointing.

> 13. Boarding, the quick and dirty way. 

Long segment of rules for a very low probability event.  Simpler boarding
rules: A ship with no maneuver capability and no weapons may be boarded
and captured by a force able to field a 2:1 superiority in troop strength...


Thanks to Bryan for porting this over for us.  Hope our comments aren\'t
discouraging Roger too much.

How much do you plan on changing material we submit?  It\'s one thing
to act as a reviewer, but I\'m not sure I want my material editting
*before* it gets to GDW.  Other than that one quibble, I agree that
there should be only one (or very few, at least) contact with them to
avoid overwhelming them with input.

I\'m willing to give it a shot.  I\'d like to work with James, but unless
his work schedule changes, I suspect there\'s vanishing small chance he\'ll
have the time to contribute.  BTW, are we writing from scratch, reviewing
existing drafts, or both?  If working from existing stuff, how do we get
the original material from GDW?

It would be nice to have some direction and guidelines from GDW.  For
example, I\'d hate to spend a month developing rules for netrunning only
to discover that they don\'t want that sort of thing in MT:TNE as it makes
it look too cyberpunkish.  We need a little boundary criteria, don\'t you
think?

BTW, I\'d also like to work on a unified combat system (at *least* personal
and vehicle, but inclusion of air, sea, and space combat would be nice too).

Since Trade & Commerce is so badly broken in current MT, I think this is
definitely an area the our \'pros\' need to concentrate on.  Steve H., Wildstar,
Rob Dean, and Dow Rieder are the first names that come to mind here.  I
notice that only Steve and Rob are in this mail header, so I think Dow
and Derek (what *is* his real name, anyway?) should definitely be asked
to participate.  (I\'m including both of them in this shotgun reply, on the
chance that they\'ll be interested.)

With the regular TML PBEM on summer hiatus and other RPG activities
currently in cold-storage, I\'ll volunteer.

Assuming I get majority approval (and some contact info from Scott), I\'ll
contact Loren right after I get back from vacation (I should be back on
June 29th)and see if I can get some design guidelines for the new rules.
Most of you know what a stickler for detail I am, so I think I could
organize things reasonably well.  I promise not to stomp anyone\'s ideas,
as long as they don\'t conflict with any guidelines set down by GDW.
I promise to pass on only material in a form approved by the original
author, i.e. I\'m not going to re-write it after you submit it.  I *will*,
however,do spelling and grammar checking on submitted material and query
the author for corrections before passing any material along, OK?  And
finally, I promise to make sure that GDW gets all the appropriate names
listed in the final product, and SPELLS THEM RIGHT!! :^)

OK.  GMTA.  I just posted a notice last night on GEnie asking about guidelines
for TNE.  No answer yet.  We should probably get together a list of things that
we think _should_ be considered (like do it yourself computer rules) and run it
by them, even without waiting for guidelines. Doing serious work is not prudent
yet.

One small suggestion: Get the tech levels explicitly divorced from the
Terran dates. Just because we make it today on Earth dosen\'t mean it
HAS to be TL 8 (or is 1990 TL 9? I forget. Anyway, you get the point).
This will allow us to define computer models as we like it. So what if
Terra had a computer TL of 12 or 13 in 1990? Obviously we\'re going to hit
a plateau in a few years... ;-).

I think the best thing to do is work out a list of subjects and submit it
to GDW. Then they can tell us what they\'re willing to listen to. Saves us
doing a lot of work that will just be disregarded anyway.

Argh. Life sucks (sometimes). While I have spent most of my time
programming advanced software systems, I have a little experience with
TL7 robot programming from college, where I took a robot programming
class. We programmed a small (24", one-armed) robot and got a good
overview of mostly modern robot systems and technology. Suffice to say
robot programming is still in the stone age, moreso even than
conventional programming.

Off the top of my head, here\'s some of the problems with TL7 robots:

touch sensors
	dynamic range: human tactile and internal sensors can
	distinguish delicate forces on the order of 10e-5 Newtons to
	crushing weights of 10e3 Newtons, using a log scale. Force
	sensors on TL7 robots are usually linearly scaled in a narrow
	band engineered for a specific task. My robot had notoriously
	flaky microswitches to gauge "force".  Usually we programmed
	it to squeeze four clicks past switch close and hoped it was
	strong enough to grasp the object without crunching it or
	having the motor slip and get out of sync with the program.

	pattern recognition & perception: humans have millions of
	tactile sensors on their bodies which are all coordinated with a
	pattern-recognition system that can distinguish the broken edge
	of an egg shell from steel net. Robots are typically limited to
	a few dozen channels of sensor data.

visual sensors
	computer vision is barely out of its infancy. Often embedded
	sensors in the environment are a good idea - like office robots
	using a magnetic stripe embedded in the floor.

manipulators
	force: human muscle groups, made from collections of tiny
	contracting fibers, can exert from 10e-5 to 10e3 Newtons of
	force in fine gradations, depending on the number of coordinated
	units. Again, TL7 robots are usually linearly scaled in a narrow
	range.

	coordination: muscles are arranged in groups and feedback
	mechanisms regulate and coordinate their force signal by
	comparing sensor data with the goal in real time. Humans can
	regulate force feedback in about 1/5 to 1/10 a second for
	unpracticed tasks and as little as 1/30 second for highly
	practiced and programmed tasks.

	range of motion: muscle systems can exert different levels of
	force depending on the particular segment of their range of
	motion - for example, the bicep is strongest when the forearm
	and upper arm are near a 90 degree angle, and weaker at the
	extremes.

	blockage: Also, the muscle controller unit is inherently
	cognizant of the range of motion the limb is capable of
	depending on its physical parameters, location, and environment
	(through integrated sensor data). If the limb is asked to do
	something impossible, this becomes evident in the sensor data.

Robot programming
	guided: a robot with adequate sensors can be taught to record a
	particular set of motions by being walked through it, either
	programmatically or physically. It can then replay the
	remembered motions any number of times. Spray-painting robots
	are often taught in this way.

	programmed: a robot may be directly programmed in a robot
	programming language. These languages are moderately arcane and
	while they perform the basic deed, are not particularly
	inspiring.  Basic problems exist, like:
	
		reaching the limits of the range of motion
			(and still thinking you\'re moving)
		not taking into account how heavy the object is
			you\'re moving (arm droops)
		failure to realize your force varies with position
		poor real-time response
		lack of high-level pattern recognition
		no innate integration between sensors and manipulators
		poor ability to resync with the real world if you slip
		bumping into unexpected objects
		dealing with anything unexpected, in general
		failure to realize that the limbs themselves have mass
			and take space (it\'s easy to write a program
			that doesn\'t take into account that the item of
			interest is three feet down a narrow well and
			that your arm must reach straight down)
		mapping cartesian coordinates to robot coordinates
			(ie. position (3,5,-1) corresponds to shoulder
			joint 350 deg. Mark 27 degrees, elbow joint -90
			degrees, etc. tough from both a mathematical and
			practical standpoint - try and move a robot arm
			at a constant speed along an arbitary straight
			line in real time! Hah! I dare you!)
		combine the last two (limb space consumption with mapping)
			and you have a really major disaster, since
			every point on the robot arm must be tracked,
			which animal systems handle innately.
		programming doesn\'t lend itself well to dealing with
			large ranges of logrithmic, fuzzy data with
			near-instant common feedback systems.
		much of the work involves dealing with multi-dimensional
			analog information that naturally should be
			integrated or differentiated, items which are
			unnatural or expensive to perform modern
			software systems.

Well, that\'s a modestly outdated state of the art. Robot systems sorely
lack 3-1/2 billion years of evolution of sophisticated systems,
subsytems, networks, and goal-oriented integration systems. At TL7-8 We
are exposed to the white-box view of the internals of how all the
systems work, a totally different view than our internal experiential
views suggest.

Dear Scott (and other interested parties);

Your response to the Roughneck class suggests that it
 would probably be wise for me to at least offer an
explanation/concept background to this design (yes, it was mine).
Hopefully, this will make the craft `fit\' a little better into
the Traveller  framework, as you see it.

Firstly, I agree wholeheartedly with your general assertion that
the Roughneck is (at best) ungainly and bizarre; at first it
might seem like the problem it is supposed to fix is smaller than
the problem it presents.  However, I offer the following text as
a conceptual precursor:

(this was originally supposed to be included in the supplement
that eventually became A:V.  It was not included, I have since learned.)

<<Laruusalii is a failing world that is trying to maintain an
industrial-level society.  One of the major new industries in the
Laruusalii system involves harvesting complex hydrocarbons from
the system\'s largest gas giant.  Huge wildcatter rigs gather vast
quantities of liquid propane and acetylene in the middle levels
of the planet\'s crushing atmosphere.  This new resource has al-
lowed Laruusalii to continue manufacturing plastics and to export
these fluids to other worlds which have no access to petrochemi-
cals (for the similar purpose of producing plastics; my parenthetical
addition).>>

Note that the point is not petrochemicals as combustibles,
but as raw stock for creation of plastics.  If combustibles were
all they wanted, they\'d probably just grab the hydrogen and
leave.  (Although the standing rules on tech level division suggest
that it is not possible to burn hydrogen productively [as energy
source other than CryoRkt] prior to TL 7-8.)  However, I did some
research regarding the creation of plastics and my `Kentucky
windage\' call was that without naturally available petrochemicals
in liquid form, plastics could not be made reliably and at a de-
pendable qc standard.  (Oh, it would be possible to cobble up an
intricate system for this at TL 4, I estimate, but it would be
VERY expensive--and precision controls would always be prob-
lematical).

So the point is simply this; in staying with the rules of Travel-
ler (which is always a GOOD idea for freelancers to do; we have
less leeway than in-house folks), I decided to
create a craft which would :

1) provide a way to access these key compounds.
2) provide the setting for an unusual adventure.
3) --and-- display (by its very nature) the bizarre, marginal,
and even-ill advised rube goldbergesque solutions that desperate
people are likely to come up with.
^MMy reasoning regarding `desperate need\' of plastic is essentially
as follows;  low tech worlds with hostile environments are going
to be perpetually concerned with wear and tear on atmosphere
seals.  Cast iron is well and good, but in the final analysis,
most structures have `holes\' in them that permit controlled in-
terface with the environment.  That means gaskets, seals, etc.
Most hostile worlds do not have rubber-tree hydroponics gardens
at the start of Hard Times, so that\'s no answer (and probably
wouldn\'t be, since rubber and many hostile atmospheres would not
get along very well--or for very long.).

This means that, at lower tech levels where advanced composite chemistry is not
do-able, some kind of plastic is probably the key.
Without it, seals will disintegrate, life support becoming more
costly and marginal.  That steepens the community\'s angle of de-
scent into oblivion.  In short, if you don\'t have acess to seals,
or a GREAT overpressure system (with energy to burn), you MUST have
the seals.

Therein is the logic for the need.  The logic for the answer?
Well, a lot of it is in the following passages (once again; I have since learned
that this did not make it into A:V.)

<<The complex hydrocarbons that the wildcatters harvest are cre-
ated by the interaction of the atmospheric gases and radiation
from the system\'s primary.  But in order to gather these
hydrocarbons, the rig must make passes deep inside the atmo-
sphere, down to levels where the external atmospheric pressure
approaches 10 bars (this would be the extreme case; usually
about 4-7).  At this level, these complex hydrocarbons
begin to condense as vapor or rain.  The rig harvests this high
octane rain with huge outboard scoops, storing the collected
fluids in a large central tank.  This tank can also be used for
cargo storage, thanks to its fore-and-aft bay doors.>>

And, as a ready reference for our discussion, a partial listing
of the (questionable) components of the Roughneck, along with
all the notes

Laruusaliin Roughneck-class Frontier Fuel Harvester

POWER: 3/6, ImpIntCmbst=18MW, Duration=2/6

LOCO: 12/24, HiPerfRkt=1G/7020Tt, Duration=20min, Top=1000kph,

OTHER: Cargo/Fuel Storage Tanks= 650Kl, Cargo=25.6 Kl,
 CryoFuel=1404 Kl, HydrocarbFuel=36Kl, scoops,
^MNotes: The Roughneck is a low-tech spacecraft of unusual design.
Its purpose is to collect complex hydrocarbons from the atmo-
spheres of large gas giants.
The Roughneck looks like a squashed sphere.  It customarily be-
gins its mission with an empty Fuel Storage cargo hold, thereby
reducing takeoff weight to 2835 tons.  Therefore, lift-off ac-
celeration is approximately 1.5 gees, meaning that the ship can
lift off even from large worlds that do not allow it to use a
Lift-Assisted take-off (for instance, airless worlds).
Once in space, the Roughneck travels out to the desired gas
giant.  Speed is of the essence, since the powerplant burns the
same precious hydrocarbons that the ship must gather for resale.
Arriving at the gas giant, the Roughneck will rendezvous with a
support craft (often a space station), where its cryogenic rocket
fuel is replenished and its lift envelope (also called the "air
bag") is connected.  The lift envelope is a deflated dirigible of
immense size (over 4 million cubic meters of volume).  As the
Roughneck approaches the gas giant\'s atmosphere, it begins to
collect hydrogen in its scoops and uses this to inflate the lift
envelope.
The lift envelope is useless at these higher altitudes, but be-
comes increasingly useful as the Roughneck descends into the gas
giant\'s cloud layer.  There, atmospheric pressure begins to rise
dramatically and the composition of the atmosphere becomes more
dense.  At full inflation, the lift envelope provides 3321 tons
of lift: more than enough to keep the Roughneck from sinking fur-
ther.  At this point, the ship begins moving toward areas where
`propane rain\' is anticipated.  Runoff vents and folds in the top
of the lift envelope gather more of this `rain\' than could be ac-
complished with the scoops alone, resulting in a rapid ability to
fill all 650 kiloliters of fuel storage space.
Tanks full, the Roughneck boosts back up to the higher reaches of
the atmosphere, where it pumps its collected fuel into three ex-
ternal drop tanks.  Small tenders remove these drop tanks, pump
cryogenic fuel into the main rocket tanks, and emplace new drop
tanks.  The tenders then take the full tanks back up to orbit.
The primary danger in a wildcatter\'s occupation is the need to
de-ice the ship, which can be a risky proposition.  Another com-
mon source of danger are the titanic lightning storms that occur
in the atmospheres of large gas giants; a single bolt is com-
pletely capable of disabling the ship and igniting its fuel
stocks.
The Roughneck utilizes a TL 7 VTOL hull and TL 7 control com-
ponents.  This makes the construction of each craft a painstaking
effort for TL 6 worlds, which have to fabricate special, purpose-

The statistics for the lift envelope are:  Inflated Displacement:
20000, Inlfated Volume: 4.05 million Kl, Net Lift: 3321 tons,
Wgt: 2025 tons, Deflated Volume: 26,730 Kl (fits in a 2000 ton
carrier), Price: 4.05 MCr.
The Roughneck incorporates elements of the Pre-Gravitic
Spacecraft design supplement (from HARD TIMES) and the Aircraft
Design supplement (presented in COACC).

Okay.  It\'s bizarre.  It\'s different.  And to game designers
looking to sell something that stands out, that\'s often enough.
However, I have tried to make the operations of the RN class fea-
sible (if awkward).  Unfortunately, there was not enough room
available to go into all the details.  (Please remember that when
you write for publication, you always have an editor/developer
looking over your shoulder.  If you make lengthy technical des-
criptions essential, they\'re likely to pass on your whole idea.)
So here is some additional background that never made the cut:

Firstly, the tenders mentioned in the Notes (re: servicing and
removing fuel payload from the RN) are not TL 15s (or at least,
they don\'t have to be; the presence of the TL 15 XT is not my 
contribution).  Any capable hull can do--including other
TL 6, cryorkt powered designs.  This is in fact what I envi-
sioned; a commercial space infrastructure ala\' the type proposed
by von Braun/Ley/Bonestell.  Old tech CAN do the trick; it\'s just
not very flashy and it involves more time and planning.
That same old tech is what I envision supporting the transit op-
erations, as well as the on-site harvesting logistical tail.  Ob-
viously, the short duration of the power plant necessitates short
missions and rare journeys away from the operational site.  Most
of the time, the RN class would be moored at a larger space sta-
tion in orbit near the GG or at one of the Trojan points.  It
would be powered down until used--this because it\'s too expensive
in terms of petrochem to operate and to save wear on the vehicle.

Note also that in this `dedicated support\' version, the in-
flatable envelope would not have to last more than one mission
before being submitted for repair and refit (or removed from the
program for cannibalization).   I also envisioned the envelope to
be comprised of many dozens of independent bladders, rather than
a single huge piece.  But the design requirement was essentially
the same and required less room (and commentary) to do it this
way (with essentially the same results).

Lastly, some observations on the mission of the craft.  Whatever
(highly flawed) knowledge I have of engineering largely arose
from an area that I DO have an appreciable amount of formal
training in; planetary science.  Using Saturn as a model, let\'s
see if there isn\'t in fact an appropriate operating environment
for the RN.

Problem of no oxy?  Hmmm... maybe there isn\'t much O2 in the LGG
itself, but to be honest, we could find some here, too.  There
are okay proportions of methane, ethane, ammonia in the atmo-
sphere.  However, why burden ourselves getting oxy here?  Let\'s
visit a moon; Mimas will do.  Standing ice known to exist.  Don\'t
want to go to a gravity well?  Fine; rings A,B, C are thought to
mostly be comprised of water.  Average size of particulate matter
in rings; several m3 in volume.  Water aplenty, meaning oxy
aplenty.  And given reflective properties, JPL remains convinced
that this is WATER ice, not ammonia or other frozen gases.
^MNo ring?  Well, there\'s a matter of some interest; there\'s reason
to suspect that many LGGs will have them.  Jupiter does--not
nearly so spectacular and visible as Saturns, but for purposes of
tanking up on good old O2, they are practically speaking of in-
finite size.

And of course, the RN doesn\'t go to the well itself; it\'s the
duty of the faithful tenders to play Gunga Din.  Okay, so we have
the magical element for combustion and respiration.   How do we get
it to our internal combustion engines?  Diffused through the
ventilation system in pre-measured amounts.  Method?  Store the
oxygen in liquid form (either in the cryo tanks, or in the main
tanks prior to harvesting) and allow a small rate of sublimation;
more than enough for a mission which on the average will be less
than a day in duration--start to finish.
Now, dare we go down into the depths of the gas giant?  And
with a non-rigid envelope?

Well, according to the folks at JPL (who I\'ve consulted numerous
times) there are two tricks to this.  One, you WANT a non-rigid
structure: IF you run into a bad gust (and you will at some
time), anything short of a hardened hull is going to break--
unless it can give and be the willow in the wind (as opposed to
the splintering oak).

Two; the envelope has got to have a constant capability for con-
trollable, dynamic shifts in content.  That is, you\'ve got to be
able to reduce or increase its gas payload at will and quickly. 
In a Jovian atmosphere, this is less of a problem, since there\'s
no shortage of helium.  However, if you CAN\'t do this, the rigid
frame will buckle under the increased atmospheric pressure and 
collapse.  A flexible, multi-celled structure allows for the 
dynamic maintenance of optimum pressure and lift.

However, now we get into the problem of meteriological trauma--
and there\'s no shortage of it in an LGG.  However, where there
are winds, there are lees.  Not for long, and still turbulent by
terrestrial standards, but lees that are survivable.

This is where the skill of wildcatting comes in; knowing how to
spot a developing lee that also shows sign of being in the vicin-
ity of some propane rain.  Then you have to find a gentle (com-
paratively) approach route, make your passes, and still leave be-
fore the hurricane comes back to take your face off.  Dangerous?
Yes.  Undoable?  Not at all.  In many ways, the flirting-with-
danger-aspect of the job is why I named it wildcatting; rough-
necks on the rigs in Texas are my mental model (I\'ve known several
and seen them at work).

How bad is LGG turbulence?  Let\'s consider our worst-case example
(known): Jupiter.  Highest recorded wind velocities are 163 m s-
1.  However, lesser atmospheric density lessens the impact of
those winds.  As you go lower, atmospheric density increases--but
JPL studies show that wind velocity lessens as pressure increases
(or rather, as you get closer to planet `core\' and the atmosphere
becomes more dense).  But most importantly, there are whole zones
(equator-following bands) on Jupiter where the average speed is
at 26 m s-1.  Calms or lees in such regions can fall into the
single digits.

Not a calm environment, but also not the monolithic tornado of
vaporous death that many post-pulp SF populists have represented.
It--like our own environment--has extremes; wildcatters simply
must stay in those areas of extreme placidity.
What if the inflatable envelope takes damage?  First, it would be
compartmentalized for control (and damage limitation).  But if
situations  went beyond that, then that\'s when the cryorockets
kick in and the mission is aborted; everybody gets the express
elevator ride up out of the clouds.  There, in the diaphonous
outer reaches of the atmosphere, tender/tugs hover, ready to mate
with the RN and tow it off-station for repair/refit--and a good
scolding for a captain that was either too unskilled (or unlucky)
to make a safe run.

Are there problems with all this?  SURE THERE ARE--and my per-
sonal opinion is that the BIGGEST problem is that any community
would ever NEED anything so badly as to be forced into such an
atrocious and costly way of getting it.  But I submit that this
problem actually lies with some of Traveller\'s basic mechanisms.
I know; this sounds like heresy from a priest, but here\'s my
thoughts on the matter:

FIRST: why the devil are so many people living in such absolutely
useless systems, anyway?  The subsector generation system IS easy
to use--ease being one of its great appeals and a major aid to
the initial  popularity of Traveller--but it ignores a number of
basic economic realities.  The most basic of which is; places
which already have air you can breathe, water you can drink, and
food you can eat are going to get the overwhelming amount of com-
mercial investment and population.  Those environments which of-
fer resources that can be `converted\' to meet these needs without
undue hassle will be a strong second.  However, any community
which needs to invest heavily just to provide for its ongoing
basic environmental needs either has to be indispensable to some-
body\'s (national, personal, corporate) interest, sitting on top
of the interstellar equivalent of the South African diamond
mines, or is just plain masochistic.  Full life support is ex-
pensive and makes all in the environment hostage to the smallest
of errors or mishaps.
However, the Traveller UPP generation rules have given us the
universe we know, love, and vex at.  And in this universe, such
things as the RN are bound to occur.  People need what people
need (like pressure seals) and they will go to any lengths to get
it.  And enlightened decisions are not always made, nor are better
options always available (for proof of this, the history 
of US space flight--is an often embarrassingly apt example).
The RN is indeed a rube goldberg contraption; it is SUPPOSED to
strike players at first as bizarre, comical, eccentric.  But
hopefully, a referee who strings the thread of Hard Times through
an adventure with such a craft (easily done via its NPC crew;
these are likely to be desperate men trying to make a living for
families that teeter on the edge of environmental extinction),
may also bring in shadings of the desperation of the times and
eventually, the sense that war is horrid folly that produces only
greater folly in its ashen aftermath.  The RN--and the failing
community it is trying to support--is an incarnation of that
follow-on folly.
SECOND: Given what I feel to be the errors of the UPP distribu-
tion and what it says (or rather, fails to say) about the
logistics and fiscal realities of colonization and survivability
in alien environments, there is the follow-on problem of travel
and commerce within the Imperium.  How DID all those hi-pop in-
dustrial worlds EVER feed themselves?  Answer; they COULDN\'t, not
and be economic powerhouses.  Anybody remember SOYLENT GREEN?
(Sorry; I forget Sheckley\'s original title.) [Make Room, Make Room --
James] Just feeding those masses would cripple industrial endeavors.
Logically, there would have to be an exchange basis--finished goods
exported for massive food imports. Bulk haulers as big as battleships;
modular containers each the size of the QE2 strung together on the belly
of a jump carrier--just to send nutritive additives to the Hi-pop world
this week (the bulk matter of the food could be produced locally without
a great deal of cost).
The notion of a lot of little independent jump ships hopping all
over in search of fun and adventure is pleasant, very PC-
empowering, and sold the game--but it just don\'t jive with the
framework of the universe as presented.
As a result, in Hard Times, worlds are not going to have built-in
self-sufficiency guarantees.  Everything points to the opposite,
if we are going to try to make economic sense out of the whole
mess.  (BTW, my high praise to whoever it was on TML that ob-
served that the TCS taxation rate was so extreme as to make
planets flee screaming from the thought of Imperial membership.
Reduction by 80-90 % produces a believable sum--and a believable
number of fleet assets.  Also, let\'s `fess up; the campaign sup-
port rules in both TCS and STRIKER are highly optimistic.  Why?
Because a reality that would prevent players from being able to
have lots of combats would defeat the purpose of the game itself.
In short, the numbers in those systems are DESIGNED to feed con-
flict, not be painstakingly realistic.  How\'s that for a
prolonged digression?)
..RM65/
The point of all this?  Without a high emphasis on self-
sufficiency many worlds are going to have to scramble to find 
ways to meet their needs on their own.  Planets without access to 
any complex organic materials are going to be in dire straits.  
Pre TL-7 worlds are going to be even worse off, since their tech
nology does not allow very sophisticated molecular shuffling when 
it comes to non-metallics, organics, and complex hydrocarbons.  
Any such efforts will be expensive, crude, and subject to poor 
QC.  Too poor for essential environmental seals, at any rate.

So worlds with all these limitations are going to have to either 
a) trade for what they need, or b) make it themselves.  Choice c 
is a great deal more grim.  In many areas, option a) might not 
exist.  In that event, how do they pursue option b?  The basic 
answer is to get access to the most complex hydrocarbon you can 
and (with lots of pressure, trial and error, and crossed fingers) 
squeeze some precious plastic out of it.  The key, of course, is 
to start with something that is not merely a hydrocarbon, but a 
petrochemical.  This is NOT a big deal once you reach TL 7, where 
a number of advanced chemical reactant processes become avail
able.  But to someone with Korean War-Era technology,
petrochemical raw stock is a must-have first building block.

This makes the evolution of something like the RN class in
evitable.  If radioactives are locally available, the design can 
be altered to a much more satisfactory, normal-looking result.  
But that\'s not what I wanted to do; I wanted to represent a real 
last-gasp ship design from a seal-using world which already had 
two strikes against it; no in-system access to organics OR
fissionables.  

Many such worlds would simply die out--many that depend on the RN 
class would, eventually.  But assuming that humans in general do 
not willingly go gentle into that deep night, I set myself the 
task of finding a way to take a stab at meeting the needs of  
such a community.

The RN class is only one such answer.  There ARE more elegant 
solutions, but now we\'re getting into politics as well as 
engineering ideals.  The optimum is not always what get\'s sup
ported.  And that\'s what I wanted to present; a 
museum-piece display of desperate engineering.  It is only ill
- -advised if the colony dies off AND they had a better option (like
 en masse emigration).

In closing, allow me to say that I really enjoy looking at TML
and I regret that I don\'t have the time to participate regularly.
However, I always try to do a quick browse once a week--and am
always interested and excited by the stuff I see here.

Seriously maybe someone could arrange to have a site or email address where
all ideas we would like to see for Traveller 3# (Bigger and bolder than
the original) etc be posted . Then Loren could have a squizz at it and
check it out . Also Loren (?)  has access to all of us as playtesters !

I mean I would do *anything* for a chance to contribute material to the
new system, especially in the area of character generation (Its all I 
seam to be able to get mt players to do) and have actual input on the
matter from the GDW staff (as with Loren) . Think about this guys, we
could actually make the game even better (which isnt hard in a way) . Its
a great system, I just feel that GDW could perhaps have spent a wee bit
more time checking it out before publication, but then again running a
company with so many products its understandible why its hard for them to
do so .........

GDW should seriously consider getting internet and email for their company
cause there is a dam lot of people out here that could make valuable
contributions, and we wouldnt charge anything . They could also get 
mammoth puiblic feedback without having to hire some yuppie with a
business management degree telling them whose buying what and what they
think of it .

To all they guys who posted me stuff, thanks, I will get back to you
its just that my mailer has been overun

Please, Please, Please Loren convince GDW to let us contribute directly
to them, cause alot more people will, if they can via email (instantaneous
and often very cheap) . Please tell em internet & email is the way to go

Thanks for listening to this station

this is james T kirk signing off 

And a big thankyou to Loren for discovering us TMLers

    'body' => 'I "attended" a conference on America Online in which Lester Smith talked about
new GDW stuff.  The following information is what I found:

- -- The game uses the Twilight: 2000 2nd Edition system, but with a d20 instead
of a d10.

- -- The infamous virus does not affect the Spinward Marches or Lucan\'s territroy.No explanation was given of how the virus spread across the rest of the 
Imperium, and I\'ve pretty much given up hope that they will manage a remotely
plausible explanation of such an unlikely occurence.

- -- TNE is set 80 years in the future (in relation to what year, I don\'t know)
and covers the "reexploration of the galaxy"

My impression of the virus is that they needed it to get out of the hole they
are digging with Hard Times.  The GDW folks seems to have forgotten that the
Imperium has already had a 16 year civil war earlier in its history, with a
Frontier War at the same time for good measure.  The Civil War began under
much the same circumstances as the current rebellion, and the most realistic
outcome for the Rebellion is that in a few more years somebody will win and the
Imperium will be back to normal--after all, that\'s what happened before.

I\'m afraid that I just don\'t care for the virus idea.  There are plenty of
things that could destroy the Imperium that would be highly unlikely, whereas
the virus theory is just plain impossible.

How about:
- -Lucan builds a Death Star or twelve and systematically blows up every HiPop
world outside his domain?
- -A previously unknown race appears, demolishes the Imperium, and then dies of
of some common Human disease?
- -The people of the Imperium discover that Strephon actually spent the past 6
years in the shower, and they all die of heart attacks simultaneously?

I have a question about TL levels in Megatraveller...  I posted it to the
TML some time ago, I got several replies but nobody really answeared it.
I understand that the histories of 2300 and MT are pretty different.  But at
what TL would you place 2300ad.  Just an aprox guess.

    #2
One of my players proposed a kind of neuro-weapons system.  What he wants
sounds pretty close to a neuronal computer interface (that I heard of
somewhere) connected to a weapons system instead of a standard computer.  I
don\'t have any reference to a device of this kind but I came up with a sort
of modified Subdermacomp.  This connects via a short range radio signal to a
plug touching the neck (or somewhere else) and throught this plug to a
interface box that manages the signals from weapon gyroscopes (calibrated to
indicate where the weapon is pointing at) from cameras (visual , ir, light
intensified, ...) and from the brain sensors.   Could you tell me if this is
within 2300ad technology and what kind of price tag I should put on it?

     Ynno  hummed  a  tune  as he came in and  sat  in  his  desk
opposite  from Clare. He sorted his morning work into order  with
many  extra  flourishes. Clare smiled warmly at  him.  "Well  you
obviously made it home."
     "I don\'t remember most of it but I was there when I woke  up
this morning."
     Sarion  waltzed  around his partition playing  an  imaginary
instrument.  Ynno  smiled good humouredly and waited for  him  to
finish and clapped sarcastically. Clare giggled.
     "Well what are you going to do next", he asked.
     Ynno  looked  thoughtful. "I hadn\'t thought. I\'m  not  quite
over it yet."
     Clare leaned forward and handed Sarion a facsimile which  he
passed to Ynno. "Concert?" asked Ynno.
     "Good  choice!" said Sarion. "It isn\'t too intimate but  you
want  to woo her slowly. Let her bring someone if she might  feel
more  comfortable.  Better  yet  invite  both  herself  and   Old
Battleaxe. Make it appear even more innocent. Get good seats  and
flowers for each."
     "Hey! Who\'s courting her? Me or you?" laughed Ynno.
     "Well,  you never know", said Sarion. "Someone like that.  A
charming  personality almost too hard to resist..." Ynno  growled
at  him and Sarion winked and strode back behind  his  partition.
Clare smiled on wistfully.

                              * * *

     Ynno was still whistling three days later when he came  into
the office. "Good morning!", he called to Clare.
     "Ynno",  she said soberly. "I\'ve sorted the morning\'s  mail.
You  have  something  in  your cubbyhole."  He  bounced  in  that
direction.  "Ynno", she said warningly. He turned with  a  raised
eyebrow. "It\'s not good news." 
     He  went over pensively and took the one sheet of paper  and
read  it, crestfallen. Sarion arrived in just after him and  came
to  a quick halt at seeing Ynno. Ynno handed him the paper.  "She
said  no",  he  said. Sarion quickly read  it.  Then  again  more
slowly. "She said it in an open interdepartmental letter."
     Sarion held up a finger. "Remember you invited Old Battleaxe
and Bethula. It was a communique to Amalgamate, you would  expect
them to reply in open. Look", he held the bottom of the letter up
to  him. "It was written by a secretary. It probably  fell  under
Old  Battleaxe\'s nose and she just told some secretary to send  a
no back."
     "But..."  said  Ynno.  Clare handed him a  piece  of  paper.
"What\'s this?"
     "Her home address.Write to _her_." Sarion laid his finger on
the side of his nose.
    Ynno smiled weakly but still looked anxious.
     He  looked  anxious  for the next couple of  days  and  then
didn\'t  come  in  at  all. Sarion and  Clare  found  him  in  his
apartment  during  lunchtime looking miserable.  Clare  tried  to
comfort him and Sarion read the letter expressionlessly.
     "She said no", whispered Ynno. "Very no. No way. Not ever."
     "It doesn\'t look that bad to me", muttered Sarion.
     "It is very clear in Imperial phraseology", Ynno  explained.
"So she knew I would understand. It is an absolute no."
     "Tactless bitch", he replied.
     Ynno  ignored Clare and glared at Sarion. "No, phrased  like
an imperial princess."
     "She\'s still a tactless bitch."
     "She must know", he mumbled.
     "Know what?" asked Sarion.
     "That  I\'m  not a man but a machine!"  shouted  Ynno.  "What
else."
     "If  she  cared it wouldn\'t make a difference",  said  Clare
quietly.
     "She doesn\'t care!" exclaimed Sarion.
     "I can see that", screamed Ynno.
     "Sarion, you\'re not helping", scolded Clare.
     "She doesn\'t care", repeated Sarion. "She never will. Forget
her.  Forget  she ever existed. She\'s not good  enough  for  you.
You\'ll get over it."
     Ynno  glared  at him, chest rising and falling  rapidly.  He
just shook his head.
     Clare  squeezed  Ynno\'s limp hand. "It  happens",  she  said
quietly.  "Occasionally  someone  meets  someone  and   something
clicks.You know that this person is _the_ person.No one else will
do.  No matter how long it takes..." She looked intently  at  him
but he didn\'t seem to be listening.
     "And  waste the rest of you life?" Sarion had his  hands  on
his  hips and a defensive stance. "Ruin your chance of  happiness
for someone who could not care less?"
     "Once  you\'ve  met that person, that\'s it. You\'ll  never  be
happy again", Clare countered fiercely. And back to Ynno. "If you
love her, love her from afar. It\'s easier to cope."
     "That  doesn\'t sound like very healthy advice to  me",  said
Sarion. "Take a few days off. Sit and stew over it. Pour yourself
a couple of good drinks. You\'ll get over it." Ynno stared at  the
table.  Sarion sighed and moved toward the door. "Come on  Clare,
lunchtime is nearly over. We\'ve got to get back to the office."
     "I\'m staying", she said.
     "We do have a job we\'re expected to do."
     "I said I am staying", she said resolutely.
     He  muttered  back  something she couldn\'t  hear  and  left,
closing the door behind him.
     Clare held Ynno\'s hand and for a moment looked as if she was
going to say something. But she remained silent and just held him
all afternoon.

Who\'s aiming for Trade \'n Commerce?  I\'d like to work on that stuff.

I\'ll pop the lid on this can of worms by asking what we\'d like to see
in a good trading system.  Partial list (append ? to end of each):
   subsidization
   standardization
   speculation
   consignments
   elasticity of demand
   customs
   differentiation between "surface" and "orbit" cargoes
   smuggling rules
   piracy rules
   salvage rules

And do wo want the small guy to have a ghost of a chance against the
megacorps?  And can someone give me a short, quick summary of his or
her feel for the overall commerce "ambience" in TNE?

BTW, has anyone read James P. Hogan\'s _Code_of_the_Lifemaker_ ?  All about
human\'s finding and interacting with a robot civilization on Titan.  Of course
those robots were created by an alien protoplasm race, but due to accidents and
evolution, the robots developed sentience and a civilization on a fuedal level.
I enjoyed it a lot.

If you aren\'t interested in the interaction part, read the prolog at least,
which explains how the civilization developed from a self-directed (but not
sentient) mobile factory/starship.  I found it verry interesting.

    'body' => 'I\'m excited to hear that GDW is planning a revision of Traveller, and they are
(somewhat? remains to be seen) interested in our input.

I wish I could go into details, but here\'s my basic two cents worth for the
moment:

Vehicle Design:  use real world units, it makes reality checking a lot easier.
Use a realistic building block approach where each component has a fuel, power,
size/weight, etc.  None of this \'power plant code dependant on hull size\' stuff.
Use a compatible system for all vehicles.  Allow for multiple power plants,
etc.

Conversely: try to simplify the MT Vehicle data used in play; I still find it
unreadable.


Computers should have power, size/weight, Cpu, Memory, Storage, IO, Display &
Senser/Input ratings.  Or maybe just Input=Workstation_Input+Sensor_Input and
Output=Workstation_output+Systems_control_output.

TL:  I\'m somewhat disenchanted with Earth Based single digit Tech Level
assessments.  This does not describe realistic situations where you have a
camel chase with lasers being fired.  Perhaps a TL rating for each important
TL aspect of a society would be feasible?  

Base the TL code on certain technologies IE:

   Weapon Systems: 0=Bare Hands, 1=Wood&Rocks, 2=Metal&Wood, 3=Siege Engines,
   4=Early Firearm, 5=Modern Firearm, 6=Laser, 7=Gauss, 8=Plasma, 9=Particle,
   10=Meson...

   Power Systems: 0=Biological,1=Fire, 2=External Combustion, 3=Internal
   Comnbustion, 4=Turbine, 5=Solar, 6=Fission, 7=Fusion, 8=Anti-Matter

   Transport:  0=Biological, 1=Wind, 2=Wheeled EC, 3=Wheeled IC, 4=Lighter Then
   Air, 5=Heavier Then Air, 6=Subsonic, 7=Supersonic, 8=Orbital, 9=Planetary,
   10=Stellar, 11=Interstellar

   Armor:  0=Natural, 1=Metal Personal, 2=Metal Vehicle, 3=Hardened,
   4=Composite, 5=Environmental, 6=Radiation, 7=Point Defense, 8=Magnetic
   Screen, 9=Nuclear Damper, 10=Meson Screen, 11=Black Globe, 12=Force Field,
   13=Stasis

   ...

I realize I\'m getting carried away here, but you could also add another layer
of description:

   Organization:  0=Personal, 1=Animal, 2=Vehicle, 3=Combined Technology,
   4=Vehicle Mounted, 5=Portable, 6=Long Arm, 7=Hand Weapon, 8=Vessel, 9=Fleet

You could have a O3T4P5 with a W7P4O5 and W6P4O4A7!

Just a few scatter brained thoughts... got to go!

    'topic' => 'Jump Drives revisited.',
    'body' => 'Some of you may recall my article to TML nightly some weeks ago on the
component parts that constitute a Jump Drive.  I have changed certain things
in this version of the article:  all volumes are in kilolitres, the cost of
the high-yield power plant has been increased to reflect that of normal power
plants (necessitating a decrease in the cost of energy sinks), and the weight
of the components is now specified.  The breakdown of the jump drive into
components is based on DGP\'s Starship Operations Manual, vol. 1.
 
A Jump Drive is composed of a:
Jump Governor - a dedicated computer expert system and accompanying connections.
The governor finely regulates the transfer of energy from the Jump Power Plant
to the Energy Sinks, and from the Energy Sinks to the Lanthanum Hull Grid.  The
size of the governor is dependent only on ship size, not jump performance.
 
Lanthanum Hull Grid - a grid of Lanthanum wires implanted in the outer layer of
the ship\'s hull, spaced at about 1 meter intervals.  For design purposes, the
grid is assumed to occupy no volume (it displaces part of the hull armor), no
weight (it weighs as much as the armor it displaces), and its cost is computed
as Cr1,480 times the total ship volume in kilolitres.  The cost of the grid is
dependent only on ship size, not jump performance.  Installation of a Lanthanum
grid does not alter the hull armor rating.
 
Energy Sinks - extremely efficient sinks of energy.  These accumulate the energy
produced by the Jump Power Plant, to later release it rapidly into the hull grid
during the jump process.  The sinks hold 650 MW per kilolitre of sink.  20% of
the energy is released gradually to \'warm up\' the jump grid, then the remaining
80% is dumped into the grid to enter jump.  According to Book 5:  High Guard, it
is possible to install additional energy sinks (e.g. for a Black Globe).  These
additional energy sinks cost Cr296,000 per kilolitre, but are otherwise the
same as Jump Drive energy sinks.
 
Jump Power Plant - a fusion power plant tuned for maximum energy production, at
the expense of inefficient fuel use.  I have specified 3 mton/kl as a nice
average weight for such a power plant, which will produce the same total Jump
Drive weight as in the Referee\'s Manual.
 
                       Jump Drive Component Table
 
                                 Percent of Hull
Component________________________Volume_Occupied____Weight_____Cost(Cr/kl)
Jump Governor                           1%         2 mton/kl     74,000
Lathanum Hull Grid                      --*           --**        1,480***
Energy Sinks                       0.5% X Jump #   1 mton/kl    245,000
Jump Power Plant/Hull Radiators    0.5% X Jump #   3 mton/kl    200,000
 
Weight:  stated as metric tons per kilolitre of component.
Cost:  stated as credits per kilolitre of component, except for the Lanthanum
Hull Grid (see the ***).
 
*the Lanthanum Hull Grid has no effective displacement because it is assumed
that the grid is implanted in the outer hull.
**the Lanthanum Hull Grid has no effective weight because it is assumed to
have the same weight as the hull armor it displaces.
***the cost of the Lanthanum Hull Grid is computed as Cr1,480 per kl of total
ship volume.
 
e.g. 1.  a UCP 100 Starship has a Jump-2 drive.  This can be broken down into:
 
Component________________________Volume______Weight_____Price(Cr)
Jump Governor                    13.5 kl     27 mtons     999,000
Lanthanum Hull Grid                --           --      1,998,000
Energy Sinks                     13.5 kl   13.5 mtons   3,307,500
Jump_Power_Plant/Hull_Radiators__13.5 kl___40.5 mtons___2,700,000
Total Jump Drive                 40.5 kl     81 mtons   9,004,500
 
In other words, exactly the same total displacement and weight, and essentially
the same cost as stated in the Referee\'s Manual! (No accident, of course).
 
e.g. 2.  a UCP 400 non-Starship has a Lanthanum Hull Grid installed.  This will
add Cr7,992,000 to the total cost of the vessel.  Compare this to the cost of
the SDB on p. 85 of the Imperial Encyclopedia.  This will add 2.1% to the cost
of the vessel (factoring in the 20% discount for a standard design).  Note
that the vessel is still considered a non-Starship, because it is still
dependent on its jump shuttle to enter jump (see Seeker Gaming System\'s \'System
Defense Boat & Jump Shuttle\' deckplans for the stats for the jump shuttle.
 
Perhaps the more important change is that in Space Combat.  Since the effect
Jump -n on the damage tables can be attributed to damage to the Lanthanum hull
grid (albeit damage so extensive that this result is located on the Interior
Explosion chart), the above mentioned SDB can now suffer this damage in combat.
This effect is difficult to attain, so that the Battle Rider concept still
makes sense.  See Traveller\'s Digest #16, pp. 42-43 for a more extensive
discussion of this.
 
e.g. 3.  The above mentioned UCP 400 SDB is normally capable of Jump-1 when
mated with its Jump Shuttle.  In combat, the SDB suffers the result Jump -1.
The SDB/Shuttle Combination can no longer jump together.  Of course, the
Jump Shuttle can still mate with another, undamaged, SDB, or jump by itself.
Damage to the SDB results in no reduction in performance for the jump
shuttle.
 
As an interesting side note, it is possible to determine that the energy
required to enter jump is 2.6 MW X Jump # per kl of vessel (see DGP\'s Starship
Operations Manual, vol. 1, p. 13, and the Referee\'s Manual, p. 95).
 
Suggestions for the future:  those of you who like this breakdown of the Jump
Drive into components may want to ponder the following ideas:  scrapping the
3 mton/kl for Jump Drive power plant and using the stats for normal power plants
in the Referee\'s Manual; using the superior performance of higher-tech power
plants to figure out the relative \'charge up\' times to enter jump (i.e. a TL 15
power plant should charge up its energy sinks faster than a TL 12 Jump Drive);
altering the hull armor rating of a vessel with a Lanthanum grid; determining
the weight and volume of a Lanthanum grid; and other things I hope to address
in a future article.
 
Any suggestions are welcome.

The original Striker Version had a much bigger crew (more realistic - a 
15" gun in a turret ought to require more than a one person crew), and
room for staterooms, bunks, a battalion aid station.  Plus in Striker
I had to design it from the top turret downwards, not just lump all the 
turrets into one figure.  Oh yes, I mustn\'t forget the telephone
switchboard from Striker, and the fact that each turret had a fire-
control officer in addition to all the guncrews (he had the telephone for
that turret).  The one thing I like in the MT design is the 13,607
control panels.  It makes sense that someting this big should use almost
60% of the hull for machinery. 

Finally, the original description;
        "It was a ziggurat of steel.  Tier upon tier it rose, utterly dwarfing 
the assembled machines which had already landed.  []  On the topmost turret 
(the smallest on the metal pyramid) were mounted four long-snouted guns, on the 
second turret down there were six such guns, on the third there were twelve, on 
the fourth there were eighteen.  On the fifth tier could be seen banks of 
smaller guns, perhaps a third of the size of the others, for use in close-range 
fire.  There were about thirty of these.  On the sixth tier down were some 
fifty similar guns, while on the seventh and bottommost tier were upwards of a 
hundred of the most modern steam Gatlings, each capable of firing a hundred and 
fifty rounds a minute.  []  There were grilled observation ports in every tier, 
and each turret was capable of swivelling independently of the others. "
        "It was truly a symbol of the final war, of Armageddon!  A leviathan 
released upon the land, a monster capable of destroying everything in its  
path, a steel-clad, gargantuan dragon bringing roaring death on all who 
resisted."

Mr Borich,
     Please forward this to the TML folks:

Gentlebeings:

    We\'ll take input from anyone, but I do have to ask you to remember
a couple of things:
 1) The basic mechanics are those used in Twilight: 2000/Dark Conspiracy.
We\'ll be adding a lot of new stuff (obviously...neither Twilight nor
Dark Con deal with some of things we\'ll have to cover), but we have
a system that works and we are unwilling to reinvent the wheel.
you want most to see in the new rules? What should we leave on the
typesetting room floor?

 2) We\'re not looking for outside design work. All of that is being done
in-house, primarily by Frank Chadwick and Dave Nilsen.

 3) Scott is absolutely right: we don\'t want to hear from 300+ people
each with 4-5 meg of documents for us to read. Brevity is most important.

Come on now. That they should all have heart attacks _simultaneously_ is
nearly as unlikely as the virus.

Next someone will be figuring out the stats for Ogres and GEV vehicles.

This is all very true. One of the things I hope to see in TNE
is a more sensible world generation system. It wouldn\'t have to
be more complex than what we already have.

I don\'t quite follow this argument. With fusion power it should be possible
to feed almost any amount of people. Hydroponics and carniculture plants is
a hackneyed stable of science fiction. Of course, I haven\'t done any numeric
analyses of what it takes to feed 5 billion people from hydroponics vats. (I
don\'t have the necessary knowledge). Perhaps it is impossible.

The trouble is that it is just as inconceivable that a high-population
world should _not_ be self-sufficient. I have no idea of how many kg.
of material is needed to serve half one person\'s yearly needs (that would
be the most economic use of the ships involved: Produce a surplus of half
the necesscities of life and import the other half), but each kg. would,
in the case of our 5 billion pop. world, require nearly 1 million tons of
starship to import it (somewhat less if all your trade partners are within
jump-1. On the other hand, any partner that is two jumps away will quadruple
the tonnage needed for the stuff you get from there). Take a simple matter
like personal transportation. Let\'s assume that one 5-person family in ten
has one grav vehicle. That makes 100 million grav vehicles. Say they have an
effective life of 5 years (not unreasonable, I think). That means a yearly
import of 20 million grav vehicles. The open-topped air/raft in _Imperial_
_Encyclopedia_ has a displacement of 2 T. That\'s 40 million T/year. One
ton of starship can import 6 T cargo per year (Assumption: Average cargo
space on pure cargo ships is 50%. You can get that up a bit by assuming
jump-1 ships only, but can you really assume that? I think not). So just
to cover that need you need 7 million tons of ship. Now add refrigerators,
toasters and hairdryers, and before you know it the number of ships you
need is litterally astronomical.

However, while I was writing the above, it occured to me that we are all
going about this the wrong way. Instead of arguing about what can be
explained (away) and what cannot, we should start with the result we want
to wind up with and work backwards from there.

Case in points: I don\'t like high-population worlds in general because of
their much too great contribution to naval budgets, and I dislike high-pop.
worlds with lousy physical characteristics because I can\'t really believe
in them. All right. How do I get rid of them? The economies of these worlds
really WERE highly specialized and interdependent (and never mind how that
was possible; as I\'ve said before, if you can believe in a flat galaxy, you
can believe anything ;-). With the Hard Times most high-pop. worlds outside
the Safes failed catastrophically. Most high-pop. worlds inside the Safes
took warning and gradually switched to a more independent economy. The
change in population was accomplished by population control and emigration
instead of starvation, but the population declined one way or the other.
Thus there are less high-pop. and many more medium pop. planets in the New
Era.

One thing about this TNE, do we reply to stuff at this address ????

Before anyone does anything for GDW would should have a definate and
absolutely correct statement on the system they will be using eg either
traveller or twilight 2000

Now I have both games, and I have to say (no offense GDW) that the twilight
2000 system leaves alot to be desired . The skill resolution (based on 
levels from 1 to 10) means basically unless you have a skill level of
5 (I believe) your character may as well not bother to attempt something
anyway . The character generation too is a bit much . I have played
over 10 roleplaying systems in my 11 years in roleplaying and I have to
say that of the character generations Dragonquest (Formally of SPI, now
<sigh !> TSR) and Traveller (Old and New) were the best . I mean half
the fun of traveller is making up characters . Dont Change It !

The twilight system requires a character to have many many different
skills, at fairly high levels in order to have a proper chance of sur-
vival . Whereas with traveller you dont

Task Systems : As I have said, the task systems for Twilight 2000 I believe
are not good, one the otherhand the traveller task resolution is at the
same time the simplest, most realistic, and fun system I have come across .

Of course we all now that MT is a combalation of GDWs writers ideas and
really most happening thinkings . The trouble of course was putting this
in a readable format . Twilight 2000 is in a readable format, the ideas
for the system are good, but I think the gaming mechanics could be a hell
of a lot better . I am not an expert, but I feel I have enough knowledge
to say that . Frank Chadwick (?) is a brilliant game designer, but I still
think that T 2000 game mechanics are stupid . 

Please Please Please stick with the d6\'s . I have this funny pet hatred
of systems that use multiple kinds of dice, and certain kinds of dice .
ie  d20\'s . Traveller uses d6, can get em anywhere, DQ uses D10s thats
cool (I really dig percentile based games) but d20s SUCK ! okay I know
I played AD&D for 8 years . And as for Loren (Please exuse things
like he or she cause I dont know is Loren <sigh> is a girls or guys
name) saying "we wont tell you guys very much" that is dumb ! okay !

I mean If we are going to help (for unselfish reasons) you have to let
us in with whats happening, is GDW thinking that there is a industrial
spy looking at this newsgroup who will sell their plans to the
highest bidding gaming company ? (Hans the former east german
turned of the computer and said to himself "At last I know GDWs plans,
I will sell them to <insert gaming compamy name here>, and they will
be ruined BWA HA HA HA HA HA HA") . Its a bit of a wank saying something
like "We will tell you it uses a d20, but thats it sucked in" . Dont treat
us as a liablity please, if anything we (I hope we speak for all) are a
valuable asset (I know for a fact that TSR moniters the rec.games.frp
newsgroup very carefully) . 

Ive worked it out guys, its really Gary Gygax whos behind this terrible
plan to use d20s (Gary suffers from d20 disorder, namely a fascination
and addiction for em) . 

Phew thats my ravings, any comments (besides whats the fact of helping
them if 1) they are going to keep us in the dark and 2) they wont even
give us copies of basic gaming mechanics) . 

Please may have a comment from the lovely <insert unknown sex here>
Loren 

Sigh, Edmund

I can see it know, TMLers standing outside GDWs offices singing
"We shall, we shall overcome" and chaining our selves to the
railings .........

  As the resident Swede, I feel forced to add \'Taxes\':)

  Taxes are almost an as big a reason as bans and prohibitions for smuggling,
look for example on the rampant liquor smuggling going on up here in northen
Europe. In a way, taxes are \'halfway prohibition\' since the government says
"Ok, we\'ll let you sell it, if you pay us for the privilige!"

This is my first post to TML, and I hope I can offer something of value to the 
list. I look forward to the correspondence. 

A couple of years ago, I read an article in Challenge called "Lone Wolf". Y\'all
may remember it, it was a multi-player \'sink the Bismark\' kind of game for Star
Cruiser and 2300AD. I really liked the idea, so I created cross-sections for 27
systems in the French Arm in PostScript format scaled to the template offered
in the article. I fleshed out the systems not detailed in the Colonial Atlas
with the tables in the 2300 Ref\'s guide, and included that data on each
system\'s sheet in a table. I was also able to show stellar warp-gradients as
shaded circles, which yielded some surprising insights into how the lay of a
system\'s worlds, gravity of its star(s), etc. might influence the tactical 
thinking of a 2300AD starship captain. 

I didn\'t find any local interest in playing a Lone Wolf game, so the files 
have just been sitting on the hard disk here. Eventually, I\'ll have to get 
rid of them.

Would this sort of thing be of any interest to anyone? I created them in 
VMS MASS-11. I\'d like to share them, but don\'t know of a way to send them
over the net. I can convert them to ASCII format image files, so maybe they
could be trimmed of mail headers and printed as PostScript files after being
sent as E-MAIL. I haven\'t tested this. (BTW, Postscript image files are LONG
beasts due to the verbose nature of the syntax.)

     Ynno  was  in  the next day. Late.  He  worked  but  without
spirit.  Despite careful attention by Clare and Sarion he  didn\'t
improve. After two weeks Sarion took him aside.
     "Hey, pal. You\'re not looking great." Ynno just stared back.
"We  can\'t  have you moping around like this." He  looked  at  an
irate  complaint. "Telling a customer \'What do you expect  for  a
capital  investment of 30,000Cr? An aerostat on toast?\'  is  just
not good for business." Ynno shrugged. "Well we\'re going to  call
in  psychologists  from Beta Hugh. You know where  that  is?"  He
nodded. "Well, hopefully they might be able to help you work this
out. Is that OK?" Ynno nodded and went back to his desk.
     So  Ynno was put onto interoffice advisement and Clare  took
over customer interaction for the three weeks before the imperial
specialist arrived. They met in a small briefing room.
     "Hello,  my  name is Auadaea Keleu." He shook  Sarion\'s  and
Ynno\'s  hand. "I would first assure you and your department  that
all maintenance is covered by your original contract and will  be
met by the Imperial Government. Our whole policy in making  these
advisors  available  is so that we may trade  competitively  with
local  industry on an equal footing." Sarion made  polite  noises
and  nodded.  He  opened up his briefcase and  took  out  several
folders. "Annual maintenance record good, no complaints. So  what
seems to be the problem?"
     "Um. Severe depression, sir", said Sarion.
     Mr.  Keleu  looked up a bit quizzically. "Hmmm.  Brought  on
by...?"
     "Um..."  Sarion shifted uneasily, "Unrequited love, I  would
say."
     "Ah. Do you have a picture of your lover, Ynno?" Ynno stared
at him expressionlessly, then reached in a pocket and handed  him
a photostat. Mr. Keleu looked at it for a few seconds and  handed
it  back. He then placed all his folders back into the  briefcase
and closed it. Sarion looked worried.
     "What is it?"
     "I  am  afraid  this is a bit of an  embarrassment.  We  are
normally careful but occasionally an advisor is sold outside  our
knowledge.  We weren\'t aware that a second model existed in  this
system."
     "I don\'t understand", said Sarion.
     "That photograph. It\'s quite clearly from our advisor line."
     Ynno started forward and Sarion exclaimed "What!"
     "How  can  she be? You\'re just lying",  accused  Ynno.  "How
could she be so... so... and be a robot?"
     "How could you be as _you_ are...?" said Mr.Keleu quietly.He
sat back in his chair and waited for the shock to pass. "Have you
never  wondered  why humanoid robots are only  available  in  the
advisor series?"
     "I...  I  always  thought they were  used  elsewhere",  said
Sarion.  "But like the advisors, no one was telling, for  maximum
effect."
     "No.  There are only two models. That\'s all there ever  have
been. There was a minor noble, Kiertwith Konnoi, who fell  deeply
in love with another, Ajin Heer, who totally rejected him. In his
despair  he drove himself into work. The man was  an  unmitigated
genius  and with his monomania he produced a software replica  of
the two people he knew best: Ajin and himself. They thought  just
like  a  person. Excellent at interaction. They  were  good.  Too
good.  Too much the replica\'s of the originals. Whenever  two  of
those models meet their unfortunate story is replayed." Mr. Keleu
fell silent.
     Ynno looked outraged. "What do you propose to do now?" asked
Sarion levelly.
     "Well",  said Mr. Keleu, "we will send in a  replacement  of
the Ajin series. At our expense."
     "I  don\'t give a damn about the expense!"  Sarion  objected.
"How  can  you just replace someone? Ynno  isn\'t  this  Kiertwith
person.  He\'s  an individual. He laughs cries, thinks  and  feels
just like the rest of us. _He is my friend._"
     Mr.  Keleu  measured  him for a moment.  "Ynno,  close  your
eyes."
     "Why  should I co-operate at all with you?",  growled  Ynno.
"You\'re trying to kill me."
     "Is there something you\'re afraid I can prove?" Ynno  glared
at  him for a moment and then closed his eyes. Mr. Keleu  quietly
reached  forward  and  pinched his upper  forearm,  hard.  Sarion
started  forward  when Ynno didn\'t react. Ynno opened  his  eyes,
cried out and struck the hand away.
     Mr. Keleu leaned back. "See. You have very few nerves  other
than on your face and hands. You behave in a programmed  reaction
to what stimuli you receive and approximate the rest."
     "It hurts the same!" shouted Ynno back.
     "But only when you look", countered Keleu.
     "His body doesn\'t matter, it\'s his mind!" said Sarion.
     "The analogy is exactly the same."
     "Can you deny that I love her?", screamed Ynno. "I feel just
like anyone else! I have passions! I love! I hate!"
     "You  rant  and rave but no tears fall. You can\'t  cry.  You
sleep  but you don\'t dream. You can eat but you don\'t taste.  You
smile  and embrace but you don\'t feel. And neither does she.  The
Ajin model quickly comes to terms with this. The Kiertwith  model
never has to the best of my knowledge."
     "Stop it! Stop it!", shouted Sarion.
     "What", said Ynno in a cold level rage. "What is to stop me,
with  what I feel as hatred, what is to stop me from killing  you
now?"
     Mr. Kellu calmly stood and picked up his briefcase and said,
"Because every other time this situation, this conversation, that
question  has occurred... You never have." He waited to  let  the
full significance of this sink in and left.
     Sarion  threw himself into a chair and gnawed his  knuckles.
Ynno  stood  still,  gripping the table  edge.  "Imperial  toilet
paper", muttered Sarion. He bit the end off a nail and spat it to
one  side. He held Ynno\'s hand for a moment, still in  its  death

     Ynno unclenched his hands and looked disgustedly at them. He

     Sarion nodded and left quietly, locking the door behind him.

The group I play Dark Conspiracy with tried using the d20 system suggested in
the PC Booster Kit during one play session.  We were pleased with the greater
options for task difficulty levels that a d20 provided, but we also encountered
some drawbacks.  The d20 system proposed in the Kit failed to adequately adjust
some characteristics--recoil of weapons and damage causing knockdown,
specifically.  Simply doubling these values were not enough--effects of recoil
were severly exagerated over the d10 system, for instance.

These problems could easily be overcome in the Next Era game, of course, but it
would mean that existing T2K2 weapon stats would require significant 
modification.  This would be somewhat inconvenient--there are lots of stats
out for old weapons such as the Enfield Mk.3, and at the rate GDW is having
planets degenerate, those weapons will be high-tech after 80 years.

Personally, I prefer the task system found in Traveller and 2300AD, but I can
see GDWs motive for changing things.  The T2K2 system is widely used by 
players, and using this system will make it easy for non-Traveller players to
quickly learn the game (and pay GDW lots of money, of course).

The T2K2 system does have little in the way of equipment design rules, and the
small arms stats published are highly inconsistent with the guidelines GDW has
published (and indeed, with reality).  Hopefully GDW will decide to incorporate
MegaTraveller\'s (comparatively) superior vehicle design rules in TNE.

Hey there,

I wonder if you could post a note on TML for Steve Higgenbotham (I hope
I spelled the name right.)

Dear Steve,
I have been reading your postings on TML that have been uploaded to
GEnie.  From them I gather that you at one time served in the Navy
on board one or more of their submarines.  Since that is currently my
occupation, and the fact tht your name sounds very familiar to me, I
am wondering if our paths have crossed somewhere?  I joined the Navy
in 1979 and served on board the USS GW Carver (SSBN 656 G) from 1981 -
1984, part of the time in N.London, and part of the time in Newport News.
After that I went on to teach at NAVGMSCOL Dam Neck before returning to
sea duty in 1988.  Since then I have been on the FS Key (SSBN 657 B) and
the Daniel Boone (SSBN 629 G) both in Charleston, but I get the imression
that you were out of the navy by that time.  If you know me, I would
appreciate hearing from you.  If not, then I am pleased to make the
acquantance of another Submariner who enjoys Traveller.
Yours for Traveller,

Mark "Geo" Gelinas (FTBC/SS)

Thanks for continuing to post TML on GEnie.  There have been some
interesting discussions there.  I have high hopes for Traveller: New Era.

Yours for Traveller,

Geo

    'body' => '	I\'ve finally done with SYSGEN level V. Any further enhancements
(like the city generator I\'m working on and the galaxy->surface zoomer)
will go into the next release.
	Big add-ons from the pervious release are full editing of existing
feature of planets. System level editing (i.e. you can add and delete whole
planets/gas giants/...) and surface map editing. There is an on-line help
facility now too (since my manual got nuked on my hard disk!).
	You can print in graphics mode on HP-Laserjets, EPSON-FX and,
in theory PostScript. I don\'t have access to a PostScript printer. Can someone
test this for me. I would really rather appreciate it if someone else tried
it out and reviewed it for the TML. *I* think it is wonderful but that is
hardly an unbiased opinion :-).
	Here\'s the packaged gumph:


	L I B R A R Y   D A T A

	As DGP\'s World Builder\'s Handbook Software has been indefinately
delayed I have undertaken to write my own and distribute it as shareware.
The free version is called SYSGEN (level V). This uses a self-generated
universe. The version using the MegaTraveller universe is called LIBRARY
and is available upon registry of SYSGEN for $15 (or equivalent).

	Among its features are: Importing of ASCII sector data, creation and
editing of mainworld data, printing of subsectors, expansion of mainworld
data into extended system generation, naming of bodies by appropriate alien
language tables. Most of the world builder\'s handbook data is available on
each planet including size, gravity, diameter, core, density, mass, year,
solar year, day, tilt, eccentricity, seismic stress, atmosphere type, 
atmosphere taint, pressure, temperature worksheet, water coverage and 
composition, tectonic plates, land masses, natural, processed, and information
resources, native life, breakdown of cities, names of major cities,
progressiveness, aggressiveness, extensiveness, all local customs, goverment
style and structure, full religious profile, law level breakdown and
uniformity, and tech level breakdown.

	Travel times between systems can be viewed. A configuration file 
containing the date, jump drive, maneuver drive, screen attributes, monitor 
type and print and graphics print command has been added. You can search
for a system by name from Survey level, sector or subsector level. The
user can change the colour pattern and monochrome bitmap used for the
surface display. Complete animal generation tables are created for each 
planet. Hot-key menu selection by first letter. Entire sectors can be printed.
A grand survey map of all the Imperium can be printed on the printer or
the graphics screen.
	
	Not only this but LIBRARY will map your planets on MONO, CGA, EGA, or
VGA screen in traditional isohedreon format or spherical representation. Each
map triangle can be expanded in size up to 16 times giving a resolution of
up to 16km per pixel on some planets. Maps can be printed at any level in
either ASCII or HP-Laserjet/EPSON-FX/Postscript graphics formats.

	Full editing of all details are allowed. Unhappy with the number
of volcanos? Want a specific social custom? All can be changed. It even
now features a surface map editor. [Note that editing systems must be
stored seperately and require ~11K of disk space per system.] On-line help
can be accessed at any time via Ctrl-Help.
	
	You can upload SYSGEN from the anonymous ftp server at 
walton.maths.tcd.ie in the pub/jaymin/trav directory.
	Further versions and updates will be available for those registering
their copy for $15 to
		The Devnaree Collective,
		44 Bancroft Avenue,
		Tallaght,
		Dublin 24,
		Ireland				jaymin@maths.tcd.ie

Do other people find them even remotely interesting?

Spinal Mounts: I\'d like to see how big a TL15 Meson-A spinal mount
would be.  It shouldn\'t be the size of the current A model given in
the chart.

I feel that fuel requirements for ships with agility > 0 should not go
up for more than 8 hours worth of power plant time.  It seems silly
to have enough fuel to keep up agility 4 for 30 days.  I remember seeing
a discussion on fuel requirements, can someone enlighten me on what
was decided?  It is generally accepted by most people?

FYI: I wrote the craft design program that Joe will be using to check
ships in his TCS campaign.  I just used the stuff found in the Referee\'s
Manual (so no rockets!) and would like to know what general assumptions
people make when designing craft.  Do you put in 3 computers?  How many
back-up comm. devices?  Do you put one (or more) of each type of 
comm. device in the craft (i.e. radio, laser, maser)?

requirement for thrusters *have* to go up because as several people have
pointed out, the ships wind up with more kinetic energy than the fusion
reaction supplies! Also, this means generally reworking *all* power
plants and propulsion systems. 
Fusion rockets: scale back to an Isp of 600,000
Fission reactors: get *real* fuel consumption and efficenicies.
Internal combustion...
(you get the idea)

Second, have some folks checking for the *implications* of some of the
gadgets available.

For instance, if one has pretty much *current* tech, plus a continous
fusion reactor (ie some sort of magneticly confined plasma) one can
build a "fusion torch" and convert *anything to a plasma at such a
temperature that *all* molecular bonds break down. Feed this plasma
into what amounts to an overgrown mass spectrometer, and you\'ll get out
*isotopicly pure* elements.

In other words, shovel in garbage and get it reduced to its component
elements, all nicely seperated. This *will* be possible at or slightly
above the tech level that allows a "fusion rocket". And it *kills*
almost all of the "rare element" scenarios. (It also kills things like
the "nutritional deficencies" bit for the hi-pop worlds)

Or my other favorite "we never thought of that": the kinetic kill
planetbuster. We\'ve been over *that* before. 

Things to keep/revive: vector movement. Drop the (impossible) agility
nonsense. Jinking can help a bit, but when you consider the ranges
involved, it\'s *not* going to be at all significant. (Not when you
consider the speed of light lag at some ranges!)

I got into Traveller in the first place (many years ago) *because* it
was the only SF game that actually did things reasonably! I quit trying
to *play* it because of the stupid holes and inconsistencies in the
rules. (we couldn\'t figure out the "right" way to use missiles until
someone got a copy of Mayday. And then we *still* had arguments!)

Wait I can hear a faint whisper . Its saying "Constructive Criticism, you can\'t

constructive criticism" Hmmm I wonder who that can be ? Maybe it was just the

Anyways I don\'t mind cause 

1# I was never asked to join it, I came to the centre one morning and all this

people just wanted to talk to me !

2# I never actually sent something to it, besides my one critical comment
which Mark didn\'t like .

So If Bryan Boritch is giving Loren Wiseman copies of this, I am sorry
Loren for not being able to contribute, but cheer up, you have got Mark "
Insulting Man" Cook, and his amazing circus of acrobatic dictionaries to help
you now . 

Oh and just curiously, why did GDW decide to change to Twilght 2000 mechanics ?

(Really I do want to know, but that big bully mark kicked me out of his club,
and wont let me back in the tree house)

Anyway to Mark Cook, I\'m telling mummie on you !

in the gut and keep going, autofire rules were being blind isn\'t any hindrance,
low-skill, low finesse characetr generation, inconsistant mechanics (damage
systems don\'t match, fire combat uses a different skill system than every other
skill, you can punch through more armor than a machinegun can go through, who
knows what happens if you shoot a car with a AA missile, the wonderful d% for
defaults, etc.), excessive stats (so I think GURPS has too many, sue me, since
its from playing experience) which don\'t make sense (why is pistol based on 
Strength?), etc. Gone will be the style of the Traveller character generator,
gone will be quick, easy-to-describe PC details, here will be needless 
redundancy of weapons (if all assault rifles are the same, why not just list
them once instead of all 10 or so?) to add detail to what looked like a 
10-minute hack-job of revised rules. 

Can we assume that everything that could be fixed (should have been in MT)
won\'t be? 2D universe? We\'ll keep that! Hereditary nobility? Gotta have it!
Hard Times/Virus that makes Star Trek look like hard science? Give me more!
Technology that looks like the Korean War in space? Keep it coming! 

Everyone is aware that there are too many low-tech planets in the MT universe
without even consdiering Hard Times, except I guess everyone at GDW. When MT
came out, it would have been trivial to simply redefine the TL values (so
no data would have to be changed), but no! We have 1920s cultures next to
spaceports. Maybe with some innovative justifications this might have been a
part of an interesting, if quirky, universe. But no, this is supposed to be
_natural_! No `anti-technology movements\', no `regressive religions\'. 

I still say that if DD (DJ?) is so great, make TNE a worldbook for it instead
of its own game. Otherwise, the Imperium is as dead as Strephon. No new 
Traveller fans will be made from such lousy rules, and one by one, us addicts
will go cold turkey. Damn shame.

Oh, one more thing. According to my Imperial Encyclopedia, the Terrans used
artifical intelligence during the 2nd Interstellar War. Lemme guess... they
forgot! No! Even better! They went down a TL due to lack of trading due to
the war, and _then_ they forgot!

DONUTS (part 2 of 4)
or
_101 Things to do in Jump Space_

	The only living thing on the ship bigger than Gertie was the
Aslani. We called him Hyl, which was short for his whole name.  He
actually  wasn\'t a bad sort for an aslani once he mellowed out some. 
He was a bit a problem early on in the voyage, and MC and Haakim were
ready to space him.  He wouldn\'t relinquish the pilot\'s seat to anyone
for six jumps when we started out.  He wouldn\'t even leave the bridge, 
slept in the pilot\'s chair, talked to Haakim as if Haakim were a female
aslani, made the bridge stink...
	He had been in the chair so long that he started making
mistakes. Gertie, being a groundpounder, didn\'t know enough about ship
ops to kick him off the bridge; and MC, who knew better, was still
ticked off that Gertie was commanding, and she wasn\'t going to
volunteer that info to Gertie.  So when we chased the corsair and blew
it full of holes, Hyl had pushed the engines too hard.  The insertion
into jump was bad, really bad.  Even MC and Sean lost their guts along
with the rest of the crew.  That finally gave MC the lever she was
looking for: at the next command meeting she rearranged the crew
rosters to her liking, and gave Hyl a piece of her mind for good
measure.  It was quite a sight - short little MC spitting venom and
invective, and great big huge Hyl hanging his head and taking it.
	After that episode, Gertie and MC came to an understanding, and
Hyl started comporting himself better with the rest of the bridge crew.
MC and Hyl developed a very polite working relationship, though they
are too far apart culturally to ever be great friends.  But this really
isn\'t about how the crew almost killed each other on the way out - this
is really about Gertie and her donuts.
	You see, Hyl does have a sense of humor, though the crew
doesn\'t understand it most of the time.  Hyl does pull a winner from
time to time though.  In the middle of the donut heists, Hyl decided
that he was going to play too.
	So he showed up in the mess one morning and stood at the head
of the table where Gertie was sitting and eating her donuts.  I think
that was his way of giving Gertie the opportunity to notice his
presence.  Sure enough, she looked up, said good morning, and went
back to reading.  He studied her, he studied the plate of donuts, he
looked around at everyone in the mess.  Everyone else in the mess was
looking back at him (when Hyl does something unusual, people
_notice_).  He flipped his ears, smoothed his mane back, strutted
behind Gertie, and snagged a donut on the end of a claw as he passed.
He then stuck it on his tail and waved it behind him as he walked out
past Gertie\'s table.  When he was sure he had her attention (and he
had - no one there had missed the lift of the telltail blond eyebrow),
he paused, swung the tip of his tail to his mouth, and took a nibble.
MC almost fell off her seat from laughing too hard, and the marines
stood up and applauded.
	Gertie?  She just shook her head, and went back to reading,
muttering under her breath.
- ----
	MC decided to get involved in the donut heists.  She spent
three days down in engineering (always a sign of trouble), and then
appeared one morning in the mess with her computer on her arm.  It was
unfortunate that almost all of the rest of the crew showed up too.
Gertie finally showed, looked around, and smelled trouble in the air.
MC was actually sucessful at nibbling at her bowl of whatever and
looking like she was reading the display on her computer.  Truth be
told, she was looking at her display -  she had the mess displayed in
map view.
	Gertie approached the pastry box with great caution.  She
inspected it.  She inspected the contents. She inspected the occupants
of the mess.  Everyone was trying very hard to look innocent.  She took
out a plate and piled donuts on it, and then placed it at her usual
seat.  She inspected the chair.  She inspected the table.  She
inspected under the table.  She inspected the occupants of the mess
(again). Everyone was trying very hard to look innocent (still).
	Finally, she sat down and took a bite from a donuts.  She
watched the crew.  The crew watched back, everyone except MC and
Thilia.  MC was looking at the computer display, and of course, Thilia
is blind and can\'t watch anything.  While Gertie was watching the
crew and the crew was watching back, the plate of donuts floated up
a few centimeters, floated in back of Gertie, and settled down quietly
by her other elbow.  Someone snickered.
	At that, Gertie checked the donuts and took a doubletake to
discover them on the wrong side.  She left them there, and went on to
reading.  All was fairly quiet for many minutes.  Gertie would look up
every now and then, only to find people fairly quiet and very
attentive.  Then, the plate floated back to its former location, and
when Gertie went reaching for the next donut, the plate wasn\'t where
she had left it.
	As the sound of laughter rippled through the mess, Gertie
lifted the plate and removed the grav disk affixed to the bottem.  The
only people not laughing were MC staring at her display, and Thilia who
had seen none of it.  Gertie got up, walked over to MC, and thrust the
grav disk under MC\'s nose.
	"I believe this is yours?"  The sarcasm was unmistakable.
	"Oh yes," MC showed remarkable control, and took the disk while
maintaining a straight face, "thank you."  She could have been thanking
a shop clerk or a junior officer.  Gertie just gave her an eyebrow, and
turned away muttering "I\'ll get you for this, Norris."
	MC allowed herself a small self-satisfied smile, and put the
grav disk into her jumpsuit pocket.  And then Thilia leaned forward
across the table, and demanded to know what was going on.

next weekend, part 3, where Sean the engineer gets in the
act,  and MC gets blamed for it...

Great, if any of it is "on-system", then could you email it to me (I recommend
that you don\'t send it to the mailing list) and I will put it together with
what I already have.  When this is all over, I will put what I have in a
list to the mail-list, for all to see, and request...

But, if it\'s on paper, email me a list of what you have with references,
and sector/subsector/world classifications if available. eg.

Regina/???/Regina - world data for Regina in unknown subsector and sector Regina

Fairly easy eh...

Regards,

Loren,

	The GM of the traveller campaign I play in, has written a complete
Psionics/Magic/etc system, that would add to TNE of traveller in what I
believe is a major way.  I will be posting a general introduction to
the mailing list here (ask Bryan Borich to keep a look out).  And I will
await a message from you on the mailing list, to determine if GDW is
interested in making contact with the author and taking it from there.
If contact is not recieved in four weeks, or GDW is not interested, I will
post the rules to the mailing list for all to use as they see fit.  I
hope GDW likes these rules, and the introductory posting should take place
within two weeks.  Stay tuned...

Regards,

	Mike.

Date: Mon, 15 Jun 92 17:35:34 +1000
From: anaylor (Adam Naylor)
To: anaylor

I did not like a few things in the character generation and resolution of
skills in Twilight 2000, so I made a few changes . I would really like to
know peoples views on these changes (If possibly, but only if it is not too
much trouble, especially Loren Wisemans)

1) Change 4 year terms to single years in character generation . 

I felt that the 4 year term of Traveller did not really fit the genre of
Twilight 2000 (You don\'t have to agree with me, thats just my view) . 

At the end of each year roll under 5 x A % . A = (No of years)/4 . (Round all
fractions down) . Eg for the first 4 years of character generation, the
chance for the out - break of war is 5% . For the next 4 years after that, the
chance is 10% and so forth .

Most occupations give 4 levels of skills every term, so the character simply
gets 1 skill per year . If in the \'First\' Term of an occupation, the
character selects 1 skill level per year from the skills listed for the
first term till all have been taken . If say, there are only 3 first term
skills, then skills are gained for 3 years, and in the 4th, no skill (besides
secondary skill) is gained . 

2) When war does out break, roll for the number of years the character is
involved on a D10 . 

1 to 2  = 0
3 to 4  = 1
5 to 6  = 2
7 to 8  = 3
9 to 10 = 4

A result of 0 means the character has not seen any \'action\' yet . If drafted,
the character has done basic training (Assume basic takes a year (18 weeks (?)
basic, transport times, \'fudge\' factor) . 

Multiply the number of years in the war by 2 for the skill levels . I let my
players choose any reasonable skill when in war situation (So character can
gain any skill, and not be limited to his occupational skill list . 

Draftees also get this (+ basic training) . But if in the first term of
the military, the skills listed under the first term skill list must be
\'gained\' . Eg Eric spends 3 years in the war, giving him 6 skills . As it is
his first year in the military (Infantry), 2 of the 6 skill levels must be
Small Arms : 1, and Melee Combat : 1 .

3) Initiative : Initiative is no worked out as [(No of years in war/2*) + 
1D3 + Modifiers] . * Round all results down . 

The modifiers are

+ 1 : If in the following military branches : Rangers, Airbourne, Special
Forces, Force Recon, Snipers and Equivalents .

- - 1 : If in the following military branches : air force enlisted, aviation
enlisted, and military intelligence .

- - 1 : If Drafted (ie was not in military before outbreak of war) . 

Eg Bill was drafted into the military, and served 3 years of the was in an
airbourne division . His initiative is worked out as following . He gets 1
for the amount of time he served in the war (3/2 = 1.5 . 1.5 is rounded down
to 1) . He rolled a 2 on a 1d3 . So far his total is 3 . His initiative is
modified by + 1 for serving in the airbourne branch and -1 for being
\'Drafted\' . So his Total Initiative is 3 + 1 - 1 = 3 . 

4) A person gets 1 skill level in secondary skills every 2 years instead of
every term (4 years) . 

I felt that people become quite skilled at hobbies . Eg I have a friend who
has done martial arts ever since he went to UNE and in senior school . Over
a period of 3 to 4 years he is a high bluse belt at Tae Kwon Do and is very
good . In twilight 2000 terms he would be at least \'Rank\' 2 . Another
friend has just started Scuba Diving, but according to the rules, an easy
task means that he has a  40% chance of drowning (He has Skill level 1, this
is doubled for an easy task . A catastrophic failure is (Chance + 4) . 

5) NCOs and Officers gain 1 level in either leader, persuassion, or
instruction every time they are promoted (And this does not cost any skill
points) . 

6) Languages cost 1/2 a point per level . If in the characters \'sphere\', then
the Language Rank is increased by 50% . Eg Boris, a German wishes
to learn english . He has 1 skill point . It costs him 1/2 a skill point to
progress each Rank . For 1 skill point, he has English at Rank 2 . However, 
because English is in the European sphere of influence this actually gives
him Rank 3 .

7) Ignore the Skill Rank limitations based on stats .

I found that the character rarely got to a stage where this was a problem,
and since I felt that the chances for successful skill checks were a bit
harsh, this helped to make up for it . 

8) Instead of basing skills on stats, add a \'Skill associated Stat\' modifier
(Like Megatravller) to the base Chance . The modifier would be [Stat/3 Rounded
Down] . Eg A Eric has rank 3 in swimming, and a CON of 5 . He attempts to
make a swimming check at average level of difficulty . His chance is 3 (Rank) 
+ (5/3 Rounded down to 1) 1 = 4 . He has to roll a 1, 2, 3 or 4  to succeed .

If a skill does not really have a Stat associated with it, then the MOD is
(Skill Level/3 Rounded Down) .

Note : The recoil rule is a bit harsh when using a D10 in combat, this
MOD helps relive some of its harshness (I think) . 

9) Some of the Stat - Skill links presented in Twilight 2000 I thought were
not really apt, such as Rifleman with Strength . I would associate that more
with agility . But use the Twilight 2000 guidelines . 

Those that play Twilight 2000, please any comments on these ideas at all
(Even if they are \'critical\') . And, if at all possible, Loren Wiseman\'s
views as well (Since Loren played a huge part in the games design) . 

As it has been pointed out to me, my spelling and punctuation is not very 
good . So in advance I humbly state my apologies in advance (This is a big
problem with me, especially since I am in fact an English major) .

     Somewhere  the  sun  set and the  normal  lights  went  out,
leaving  the emergency lights. Ynno continued to sit.  Eventually
there  was a quick rap on the outside door and someone tried  the
handle.  This  was followed by a loud thud, another  and  then  a
third.  With  a splintering sound the doorjamb gave way  and  the
door  flew open precipitating Clare into the room. She ran up  to
Ynno but checked short of him and timidly touched his hand.
     "I came for you", she said simply. He looked blankly at her.
"Sarion told me what that man did. He lied. He said awful things.
They  just  aren\'t  true. I _know_ you  feel.  You\'re a wonderful
person."
     "Not good enough for her", he said listlessly.
     "No  it\'s not that. They said her body is  mechanical,  like
yours.  Is that right?" Ynno shrugged. "She\'s probably afraid  to
be loved. \'How could anyone love a machine?\' she might think. Did
you ever think someone could love you?"
     He  wrinkled  his forehead. "I. I don\'t know.  I  suppose  I
didn\'t think so." She took his hands and put them on either  side
of her face.
     "You  are a person. You can be loved. You have to  show  her
that she can be too."
     "But it\'s too late. They\'re taking me away."
     Clare  shook her head and smiled. "I got here, Didn\'t I?  My
autocart is hovering outside. The guards don\'t know anything.  We
can just fly out of here."
     He stood up quickly a smile spreading across his face.  "Oh,
Clare!  But  they\'ll see the door. You know how  they  are  about
damage  to government property." She looked at the  doorjamb  but
waved  it  away. "You could get in trouble. Why are  you  helping
me?" he asked, concerned.
     "I",  she  began.  "I like you, Ynno.  You\'re  a  very  good
friend.  I  just want to see you happy." He smiled and  held  her
close. Then she took his hand and led him off.

                              * * *

     The  elevator stopped at Bethula\'s floor. They  stepped  out
and  stood down the corridor and around a corner from  her  room.
"It\'s late", said Ynno. "Perhaps we should try tomorrow."
     "It\'s not too late to be calling", replied Clare. "There may
be  no tomorrow." She gripped his arm tightly. "I know  what  the
decision  is. To risk all to gain all or lose all. I say  go  for
it."
     He nodded, took a deep breath and walked up to the door.  He
knocked and shortly Bethula answered. She looked surprised,  then
annoyed. "I thought I made it perfectly clear..."
     "Bethula",  he  interrupted. "I\'m a machine  too.  The  same
series."  She  looked  shocked and he  continued  while  she  was
stunned. "I love you. More than anything. _I love you_."
     She  resumed  her annoyed expression. "Look.  I  don\'t  know
_where_ you found that out. I don\'t care what you\'re made of,even
if  you\'re an avatar of god. Just stop bothering me and go  away.
Very far away." She slammed the door in his face.
     He  made a half aborted attempt to stop her but  just  stood
there  and sagged. After a minute Clare came for him and led  him
quietly away.

                              * * *

     They  sat  at the kitchen table in Clare\'s  apartment.  Ynno
stared  into the depths of the cooling coffee as he  swirled  the
mug.  "I\'m lost now", he said. Clare sighed, watching  him.  "She
hates  me.  Not because I\'m metal or whatever. She  just  doesn\'t
like me." He looked anxiously at her. "What did I do wrong?"
     Clare shook her head, "Nothing. You did everything you could
do.  It  was just the way things were." She blew  into  her  mug.
"Sometimes  you see someone, and, like, you know you\'re going  to
like this person. Sometimes you see someone you know you\'re going
to hate. Someone just had it in for you when the two of you met."
     "Mr.  Kelleu  said  that this happens  every  time  the  two
different models met."
     "He lied. He was wrong about other things."
     "Yes", said Ynno, "he was wrong. I do dream."
     Clare looked up sadly. "What do you dream of?"
     Ynno  sighed. "I don\'t always remember. I used to  dream  of
floating in a white place somewhere." He took on a grimmer  tone.
"I  only  dream of her face now." Clare looked down  again.  "\'To
risk all to gain all or lose all\'", quoted Ynno. "That\'s what you
said.
     "Yes,  I did." Clare straightened slightly and took  a  deep
breath.  "Ynno", she said. He looked up at the tone in her  voice
and met her eyes. "Ynno, I love you."
     He  raised  his eyebrows and opened his mouth but  no  sound
came out. Tears started from the corners of her eyes. He shut  it
again.  He  reached  across the table and  held  her  hand.  "I\'m
sorry",  he said, looking back into his cup. "I, I\'m just  burned
out."
     She  stroked his hand with her other hand. "I- I-  I  always
have", she managed to choke out before breaking down. Ynno  stood
up and came around to her side of the table and held her gently.
     "I understand now. To \'love from afar\'. I never understood."
He  rocked  her gently and the sobs grew quieter and  she  hugged
back. He stopped the rocking. "I\'m so sorry. I\'m dead inside now.
I  can\'t  feel at all anymore." She looked  pleadingly  into  his
eyes. "I just can\'t. It isn\'t there."
     "Please", she asked. "Just tonight. Will you try?"
     "You\'re  a very good friend Clare", he said. "Better than  I
ever knew."

In one of the Retieif stories, reference is made to the Mark V Bolo

I agree with much of what you\'re saying, but I don\'t think realism is all
that\'s it cracked up to be, at least in connection with rpgs. Any game
system that portrays even modern weapons realistically, let alone futuristic
weaponry, is going to be death on the heroic style gaming that I, for one,
favour. I mean, even today you can make weapons where the only way to
survive getting shot at is to not get shot at. IMO science fiction weapons
cannot be too realistic. In fact, future technology as such cannot be too
realistic. I suspect that a TL 15 society would be a nice place to live in,
but a lousy place to have high adventures in.

>Can we assume that everything that could be fixed (should have been in MT)
>won\'t be? 2D universe? We\'ll keep that!

The 2D universe cannot be fixed without dumping the whole Imperium back-
ground. If I ever were to make up my own Traveller universe I\'d make it
3D (it\'s not that hard), but I don\'t consider it a serious enough fault
to loose any sleep over.

>Hereditary nobility? Gotta have it!

What\'s wrong with hereditary nobility? The way nobility is implemented is
faulty, but I don\'t see anything wrong with nobility per se.

>Hard Times/Virus that makes Star Trek look like hard science? Give me more!

Yeah... well, when you\'re right, you\'re right!  ;-)

>Technology that looks like the Korean War in space? Keep it coming!

See above. Personally I\'d go for the Napoleonic Wars in space.

With all the discussion going on, I decided I better have another look at 
Twilight:2000 just so that I could discuss the issue from a position of 
lesser ignorance.

As far as I can see it, the main things that a Traveller set of rules would 
use from Twilight:2000 are the character generation system (about 35 pages 
including a lot of illustrations and World War II/Earth specific material 
that would need to be completely altered), the "How to Be a Referee" (13 
pages, fairly generic, but does include 2 pages on skill use resolution), 
and the combat rules (35 pages, but does not cover a lot of science fic-
tional material presumably needed by Traveller.)  That\'s 83 pages out of 
280, and it includes a lot of material that would need substantial rework. 
Is it really worth sacrificing almost complete compatibility with all 
previous referees\' work and existing products in order to provide a poten-
tial new player a boost up by letting him roll 2d6-2 instead of 2d6 in 
character generation, and 1d10 instead of 2d6 for task resolution?  I don\'t 
think so.  I know that I have played a lot of games, but once the whole 
concept of being the gamemaster and winging it with no more than a vague 
idea of "Simple, Routine, Difficult, Formidable"  and a few die rolls has 
been absorbed (rather Difficult (-:), the additional business of shifting 
between 1d10, 2d6 or Skill(d6) between different games is fairly minor.

A Twilight:2000 character has six characteristics generated by rolling 2d6-
2 (with a reroll on a zero result).  A Traveller character has six charac-
teristics generated by rolling 2d6, and can gain values of up to 15 in the 
generation system.  The difference is that T:2000 substitutes Charisma for 
Trav\'s Social Standing.   Both games now use four year \'terms\' to add 
experience.  Most T:2000 terms will give a character 3-4 skill levels.  
Most Traveller terms will give a character about the same.  In T:2000 a 
skill is functionally limited by the value of its \'controlling characteris-
tic\'.  That is, if I have a character with a strength of 1, it will be 
difficult gain a high level of skill in Small Arms (Rifle) for an example.  
(Hmmm...).  In Traveller, a character is limited to a total of his educa-
tion and intelligence in skill levels.  I have an unsubstantiated (mathe-
matically) gut feeling that a skill level in Traveller is worth more than a 
skill level in T:200).  (See success chances below.)  In T:2000, a charac-
ter gets seven hit locations calculated on his body.  Traveller used an 
abstract system.  I have a few problems with the execution of the system in 
T:2000, but there\'s nothing too terrible about the idea of hit locations 
(other than that fact that they will be mostly irrelevant to a non-combat 
heavy game).  A T:2000 character with average strength and constitution 
values of 5 will have 10 head hit points, and 30 chest hit points.  A 
critical wound to the chest (more than 2*h.p.) will knock him unconscious.  
That is to say, 61+ points of damage.  This is the same value required to 
render an elephant unconscious, and can be delivered by 3 average 
damage .50 caliber machine gun bullets, 9 average damage M-16 5.56N bul-
lets, 18 average 9mm pistol bullets, or 25 average arrows.  "It\'s safe to 
charge them--all they have is a hunting bow..."

Regarding skill levels, I present the following chart, showing the chances 
of various outcomes using the T:2000 system.

Skill    Outstanding Success  Success   Failure   Catastrophic Failure
  1              0%             10%       36%               54%

  3              0%             30%       42%               28%
  4              0%             40%       42%               18%
  5             10%             40%       40%               10%
  6             20%             40%       36%                4%
  7             30%             40%       30%                0%
  8             40%             40%       20%                0%
  9             50%             40%       10%                0%
 10             60%             40%        0%                0%

Since a typical very skilled Traveller has a three or a four in his main 
skill, it can be seen that a Traveller skill level must be worth more than 
a T:2000 skill level (otherwise most ship\'s engineers would damage their 
drives on a routine repair attempt 28% of the time.)  So,m a typical T:2000 
character is probably less capable at any given age than a typical Travel-
ler character.  This, by the way, is my major objection to T:2000/2nd as a 
revision of T:2000/1st----given the background, I thought that having par-
ties made up of extremely capable characters was quite reasonable.  A 
T:2000/2 party wouldn\'t last very long up against a T:2000/1 party.

If a revision consisted only of grafting on a combat system based around 
the seven hit locations and so forth, I\'d have no strong objection.  After 
all, it\'s been done before.  As someone pointed out, a NewTrav would repre-
sent the fifth or sixth personal combat system.  I think that this could be 
done in such a way as to leave the current character values the same--a two 
point shift in the average value of characteristics can be compensated for 
by a shift in weapons\' damage values, if necessary.  I think a move toward 
a less random character generation system would be acceptable, providing 
that the average number of skills gained stayed about the same.  I think a 
move to the d10 skill resolution system and away from the 2d6 universal 
task system is a bad idea, unless compensated for by an increase in the 
average level of skills, which would be a bad idea because of the compati-
bility problems.  Tasks are one of the few non-problem areas in MT, at 
least in routine usage.  (I usually trim back on the fumble rolls when in 
actual play.) 

Enough for now.

"...the only way to survive getting shot at is to not get shot at. IMHO 
science fiction weapons cannot be too realistic..."

I couldn\'t agree more. In fact, for me this is one of the great RPG failings
(aside from the lack of a really good initiative rule). In movies, etc., 
people simply do not shrug off machinegun bullets. Even in the cheesiest
action flicks, the heros survive by dodging or otherwise not getting hit.
Sure, they can take 20 socks to the head, but that\'s not the same as grenades
or assault rifles. Pistol shots to the limb cause wounds, but how often do
you see anyone survive a head/chest shot? 

Sure movies aren\'t real life, but they are (to me at least) just as valid a
reality game-wise as actual real life (whatever that is). When I think of RPGs
I often naively think of Star Wars, Die Hard, Aliens, etc., etc., and not
the result I usually get, where combat is slow and ponderous, and it just 
becomes a slugging match. Kinda like Battletech, where there is no need
for strategy, since first-shots don\'t exist, and you can\'t take out a mech
in one action anyway, so why bother with surprise? And do they spent most
of the combats, never mind the story, exchanging bullets? No. Sure a good GM
could make this so, but it would be just so nice if the game system was 
actually set up to assist his job, much less promote it.

I want T0 (Traveller Zero) to be real simple mechanic-wise, and consistent
throughout. Combat should be fast and simple, so that maybe most of the
rulebook covers other kinds of interactions. Deadly, sure, but allow dodges
and otehr evasive maneuvers. Adventure isn\'t one long firefight - this needn\'t
be DnD in Space - why make it one?

The 2D nature of the Universe makes it alot easier to draw maps, plan travel

enjoying the aspects of the game that they like.

There\'s a simple explanation that I use: the Universe may be 3D (11D? :), but
Jump Space is only 2D. Jump Drives are already a magic black box; adding
this small datum doesn\'t change that.

It\'s quite possible that the Jump Space coordinates have absolutely no
relationship to real-space coordiates.  Two different stars might be 4ly or
40ly apart, but still be Jump-1 apart.

If you really want a 3D universe, make one up!

Here\'s a general gaming simulation question:

I\'ve homebrewed a couple of rules sets, but I\'ve never been able to
definitively decide what is the best (=realistic, for now) way to handle the
different probabilities of: Characteristics, Skills, Difficulty of a Task, and
Success.

Different dice give different ranges of numbers, and different probability
curves:

   linear, same chance for any number, 1 die, or percentile dice

   bell curve, middle numbers are most likely because there are more 
     combinations which result in them, multiple dice added together.

   asymtopic, a *very* high chance on one end, a very *low* chance on the other
   end, usually done by needing a certain number or higher to succeed, say, on
   a d100, 30 or higher is a good chance, 80 or higher on d100 is a low chance,
   99 or is a *tiny* chance.

The proof is left as an exercise for someone else. :-)

Notice that rolling 4 or higher on a 1d4 is 25%; there is no 0% chance number
unless the target is shifted off the range, and then it is abruptly 0% chance.

   
Having been pedantic, my question is:  what combinations of number ranges and
distribution of probabilities for characteristics, skills, difficulties, and
success work well together?

  Characteristic:  Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, etc.  Probability should
  be bell shaped.  Characteristics are generally fixed attributes that everyone
  has some score in, with most people having median scores, regardless of
  training, etc.  General aptitude...  2d6 and 3d6 are common.  I typically use
  3d6.

  Skill:  Amount of study or experience.  high scores should become exceedingly
  rare as the score increases.  ie 1/2 people might have score 1 in a common
  skill, 1/4 might have 2, 1/8 might have 3, 1/16 might have 4.  I have
  considered increases in skill to be linear, being asymtopically harder to
  achieve, and rarer.  I typically have skill levels 1-6.

     Should each increase of skill be linear equal advantage, or asymtopic? 
     Should Each increase in skill be harder to achieve?  How much harder?

  Difficulty:  How difficult a task is:  Typically, I have considered difficulty
  as being either linear, or perhaps mildly asymtopic.  I usually use a range of
  1d20 to rate difficulties.

     Should each increase of difficulty be linear, or asymtopic?

  Success:  chance of success at a given task:  Generally asymtopic.  I usually
  use a 1d20, and require a target number of higher for success.

     How should the chance of success be affected by a higher or lower skill or
     difficulty?  Should it be asymtopic?

What different ways can characteristic, skill, difficulty, and success ratings
be combined?

  I sometimes ask characters to roll a characteristic or higher then the
  difficulty to succeed at something, if it\'s a task which has no applicable
  skill.  The Characteristic 3d6 = 1 to 18 compared to a 1 - 20 difficulty
  rating seems to work well.

  For tasks which require a skill, the 1 - 20 success roll must be under the 1-6
  skill rating + a 1d6 random chance roll.


  For Tasks more applicable to a characteristic:   Roll a 1d20 success die; roll
  under the 3d6 characteristic + maybe a 1d6 skill rating to succeed. ie,
  long distance swimming, endurance + swimming (required).

  For Tasks more applicable to a skill:  Roll a 1d20 success die, roll over the
  1d20 difficulty rating - the 1d6 skill rating to succeed.  is to hit at long
  range with a gauss rifle, difficulty 16 + gauss rifle skill.

In my opinion:  having 3d6 characteristics, 1d6 skill levels, 1d20 difficulty
rating, and 1d20 success die, work well together.

Comments? Alternatives? *please*?

  {
    'body' => 'After reading the criticisms of the Twilight:2000 2nd Ed system as a source for
a Traveller re-do, I want to offer what I imagine will end up as a defense of 
the T:2000 system. But, I\'m not going to suggest that it\'s the best starting 
point for another Traveller iteration, simply that T:2000 2nd Ed has some real 
virtues. I would consider the purchase of a sci-fi game that builds on them, 
even as I realize how remote a prospect that\'s likely to be.

I\'m about to toss around a lot of opinions, but I don\'t think that anyone 
else\'s opinions on this subject are wrong. These are simply my experiences, 
based on the flavor of role-playing I and my group prefer. It may be 
significant to point out that I have no vested interest in preserving the 
Megatraveller system, if I did I\'d probably feel very differently.

T:2000 2nd Ed contains a kernel of a game system that is realistic, quick, and
easy to play, in short it\'s the most viable GDW system we\'ve tried. 
Specifically, here\'s what I find so successful:

- - Task resolution. The D10-based system, where you roll to beat the
  character\'s skill modified for Easy, Average, or Difficult tasks, is
  easy to use, and realistic enough for play. I can referee large, disparately 
  equipped and skilled group of NPC\'s in combat, in vehicles, and spend more 
  time thinking about their intentions and actions than about the task 
  resolution rules. This is a nice break for me as ref. It\'s intuitively 
  simple to incorporate new tasks into the game. While it\'s not the most 
  comprehensive task system I\'ve ever seen, it is the most eloquent one
  in terms of playability. 

  Note that T:2000 2nd Ed gives several complementing rules for skill 
  improvement. So, characters that start out with mediocre skills or initiative
  will improve them. Characters with really low skills improve at a faster 
  rate. Our experience reveals that it works!

- - Combat. With its 6-phase turn sequence and initiative system, T:2000
  2nd Ed does a super job of modeling the salient factors in a combat:
  hesitation, the relative value of automatic fire, aimed and unaimed fire, 
  the threat of the area weapon, and the impact of movement on all the above. 
  No other system I\'ve seen puts those items together in such an economical, 
  logical, complete way. 1st Ed T:2000 didn\'t pull this off, either.

  2nd Ed\'s system of volume-of-fire reductions for range, and strength due to 
  weapon recoil, is meaningful from every standpoint. The use of handfuls of 
  D6 to simulate the effects of auto fire is on the money. The primary effect 
  of auto fire, more often than not, is simply to suppress the enemy\'s ability 
  to move.  Mr. Chadwick is exactly right: it doesn\'t necessarily take a great 
  skill to use auto fire, like the Russian tank riders of WWII. This is a good 
  example, as the 2nd Ed makes the submachine gun a potent alternative to 
  the larger rifles; that\'s not the case in most other games. But, maybe it\'s 
  just that there\'s something tremendously satisfying about tossing 
  a handful of dice when your character decides to rock-and-roll.

The "truths" in the 2nd Ed apply whether the hand holds a machete or
plasma gun. On the other hand, (sorry) there\'s a lot from the 2nd Ed rulebook 
that should be thrown out the window. Role-playing games are like a good Chili 
recipe: take what you like, leave out what you don\'t, add the special 
ingredients, and write it down so you can make it again. I\'ve NEVER seen a 
game I\'d accept in every detail, I never will. What saves T:2000 2nd Ed is 
that it has a skeleton of rules that\'s well worth being fixed. 

In my case, along the way I realized that 2300AD\'s strengths are T:2000\'s 
weaknesses, and vice-versa. I married the 2 systems. Here\'s how:

- - 2nd Ed\'s entire firearm damage system, using D6 combinations for each weapon, 
  sucks root, and requires too much dice-rolling and record-keeping. So, I
  adapted the Damage Point Value and Armor Value systems from 2300AD. Now, for
  example, a 7.62mm rifle in my game has a DPV of .7, and can administer light 
  wounds, serious wounds represented by shock points, or death depending on 
  the hit location, power of the weapon, or presence of body armor as an AV 
  deduction from DPV. No muss, no fuss, no messy hit points. Calculate life 
  level values from the requisite attribute(s) of your choice; NPC\'s get 1 
  shock point per initiative level. 

  I re-evaluated the effect of contact hits from heavy weapons. If you know
  2300AD, then you know what this revision means to a character struck in a 
  vital area by a .50 cal or a 30mm autocannon round. While others eschew this 
  kind of lethality, our group feels the need to make it so without taking away
  from the heroic nature of the game, at least from our standpoint.

  T:2000\'s wound recovery system defies rational explanation. As luck
  would have it, 2300AD\'s is the best in the business, and translates cleanly 
  into T:2000 MED tasks. It\'s simple to incorporate T:2000 medical devices as 
  task modifiers; we\'re really happy with the way it turned out.

Oh yeah, I tweaked a few other things, like 
 
  - made the task to hit at close range with aimed fire AVG:weapon skill,
    not 2x weapon skill, hence unaimed fire at close range is DIF:weapon
    skill. This helps cut back the lethality of the firearms, and is far 
    more realistic than the flat curves of the "to-hit" numbers in the 
    vanilla T:2000 2nd Ed. Also, number 9 should NOT be an auto-miss.

  - toned down KNOCKDOWN so that it affects a character for the duration
    of the current phase, and through the end of the next one rather 
    than for the duration of the turn

  - removed the ability to fire to extreme range for many weapons, and
    limited it to aimed fire only (Basically, this is a T:2000 1st Ed.
    rule adapted over)

  -  brought shotguns, concussion, fragmentation effects, unarmed combat
     damage into line with the revisions
 
  - made vehicle movement rates divisible by 8

  - defined the OBSERVATION skill in terms of tasks relevant to an encounter
    situation, so as to keep it from being a "queen of the battlefield"
    kind of skill

  - allow players latitude in character generation...it\'s their character, 
    we\'re all adults, as ref who am I to mess with that?

I plan to include high-tech weapons, vehicles, maybe even magic/psionics.
This will become my Generic-Universal-Traveller System. It will be interesting 
to see what GDW does with theirs.

It appears that a typical Traveller character has a skill in T:2000 about 
6 higher than her Traveller skill level.  A level 1 skill in Traveller is
worth about a level 7 skill in T:2000.
This was one of the things I liked so much about Traveller; skill-1 meant
something.  You didn\'t have to have a level 5 skill just to have an even
chance at succeeding!  This is my big gripe with most d20, d10, or d100
based game systems.  (I also prefer bell curves.)

Okay, so I decided that since no one else would, I was going to devise a 3D
traveller universe. This would, mind you, use the same data, same politics,
etc., as normal traveller, but just sort of add some depth, if you will.
It\'s not perfect (I mean I made it up 10 hours ago), but I think it might
just have some promise.

Some minor rule changes would be required, if only to make wars, etc., work
out the same. FTL speed would be 30/Jump-n days per Pc, and standard jump
fuel would last a month. Oh, and there would be no more subsectors.

Distance between points is, of course [(x1-x2)^2+(y1-y2)^2+(z1-z2)^2]^(1/2).
If using a subsector grid, add 0.5 to all Y coordinates.

Okay, here it is:

Each sector is 8 Pc wide, 10 Pc long, and 16 Pc deep. Since ratios are the
same, relative position (sectors, that is) in standard maps is the same. 
Coordinates have three digits (of course), ranging from 000 to 79F. If
desired, use a standard subsector grid, with the MT coordinates (0101, etc.)
being (0x0y), but adding one to x and y. Simply fill in all the filled 
Z-levels in each hex (no room for starport type or name, I\'m afraid).

To begin, each star in the standard MT form has a coordinate of (aabb), so
Mora/Mora would be 3142, so aa is 31 and bb is 34.

x=(aa-1)/4
y=(bb-1)/4
z=(x remainder) + 4(y remainder) IF Y IS EVEN.
z=(x remainder) + 4[3-(y-remainder)] IF Y IS ODD.

What this does is keep stars that are close to each other in a 2D universe
still close (within 4.25 Pc), though the problem is that stars which are
vertically adjacent in 2D will be 4 Pc apart a majority of the time.

Examples are:

Mora/Mora (3124) -->        752
Regina/Regina (1910) -->    426
Efate/Regina (1705) -->     41C
Darrian/Darrian (0627) -->  169
Chronor/Chronor (0304) -->  00E

The relative positions (in the spinward marches, anyway) for the first two
dimensions are pretty close. 

Opinions?

I didn\'t mean to start a major discussion on the virtues or flaws of the 
T:2000 system.  It looks like GDW is pretty firmly wedded to the concept 
at this point, and any argument sent back in their direction will simply 
be ignored.  They\'re within their rights, of course, however crazy we 
happen to think them...

In fact, due to the attribute or secondary skill modifiers that Chris 
mentions, the situation in T:2000 is even worse.  A typical character 
will pick up an additional +1 or +2 on most skill uses, which translates 
to another level or two of T:2000 skill.

As far as I am concerned, even skill level-0 is useful as currently 
defined in MegaTraveller.  I seem to recall a note somewhere in T:2000 
that suggested that skill rolls could be dispensed with in many situa-
tions where the resolution was not in doubt.  If I am remembering that 
correctly, I think it\'s the wrong way to go, since you now have the 
possibility of arguments over whether or not a situation is sufficiently 
important or challenging or whatever to justify a skill roll.  Give me 
the system where simple tasks have a virtually automatic roll any day...

Not too remote at all, I\'d think.  They look pretty serious about this.

There is really nothing inherently wrong with this system as far as I am 
concerned.  My only problem with it is that, given the current rate of 
skill acquisition in starting cahracters shown in the T:2000 rules, most 
characters would start out vastly lesws capable than their current 
Traveller counterparts.  If the system was wedded to a character genera-
tion system where is was fairly easy to pick up three or four or five 
skills at levels of 6+, I\'d be content.  (Well, contenter...)

If they survive. (-:  Poor Demo-1 Joe Smith will probably not live to

Maybe so.  My personal preference is for combat to be a strategy of 
_last_ resort, and most of my games go for long stretches without in-
volving any fighting.  Thus, I\'m not fussy about the combat rules, and I 
actually prefer the more abstract systems that Traveller has used better 
than the more detailed ones. (How many combat systems have there been, 
Metlay?  Five or six...?)

I\'m just curious as to what you thought should be thrown out.  The rules 
you have cited as liking are the majority of rules in they game, aren\'t 
they?  Of course, they\'ll only be a small fraction of the rules needed 
for TNE, byt the time you figure ships, ship combat, trade, planet 
generation, and so forth into it.

Doesn\'t T:2000/2 already allow a good bit of latitude?  I thought that 
you could enter just about any career without having to roll for surviv-
al or admission or skill acquisition.  It\'s the next loosest thing to 
just picking the skills that I\'ve seen.

Well, there\'s a simple explanation for that; Traveller 2300\'s game mechanics
were the prototype for T:2000 2nd edition, and 2300AD is a slightly
improved version of Traveller 2300.

> [ contact damage to vital areas ]
2300AD has modified damage result rules: you roll a D10 on a chart, with
modifiers based on the hit location. This makes it possible to survive a
head shot, with the caveat that it\'s possible to die from having your right
pinkie blown off. IMHO, it works well enough.

Our biggest complaint with the 2300AD task system is an editorial one:
2300AD has a bunch of adventures where the characters are all wimpy (2,
maybe 3 in their main skill and 0\'s and 1\'s everywhere else), and then made
a whole bunch of formidable and impossible tasks that the characters had to
perform.  How do you roll 14+ on a D10 adding a skill of 2? I don\'t know
how, but GDW seems to think it\'s possible... :-)

Disclaimer: I\'m biased; 2300AD is the only RPG I play right now... :-)

I would like to comment on both of these staements.
First, though it is nice for skill-1 to mean something, and for a
character allocating points, this is convienent. But there are some
things that people are not good at but that they have a chance to
do something if the task is simple. I may have a computer-3 skill
(personally) but my Auto Repair sill is not 0. (Maybe a T:2000 level
of 3-4).

Remember that just by asking a player to make a routine task
roll, the job is not routine. Routine things like replacing a light
bulb would not be rolled for, rather routine refers to something
that is routine for someone with the skill. i.e. In auto repair, 
replacing the brakes would be routine, not worthy of a raised
eyebrow for a trained mechanic. I on the other hand wouldn\'t even
think of doing it.

Second and more importantly, I disagreee with the use of a bell curve
with a skill system where there are plusses to the roll. Lets say
that for whatever reason there is a DM of +1 applied to a roll. If this
is a routine roll 7+ then the chance of success rises from 58.3% to
72.2% (or 1.23x). If the task is difficult 11+ then the success goes 
from 8.3% to 16.7% (or 2x). This means that something that is a small 
help some times is a larger help at others. That is the +1 is not
a constant. (The reverse is also a problem the chance of failure
of a high (sill-4+) character is greatly reduced by a +1 sometimes,
but not at others). Also note that special successes are affected by
this effect as well.

This is why I likes the task system so much, as there was no longer
any +\'s to deal with, just a difficulty and a skill-stat, or skill-skill
to worry about. Though the effects of a difference of 1 skill level
in all but difficult or impossible tasks made no difference.

Personally I prefer a d100 based system for a skill-based rules set.
(Like Ringworld, or Space Master). +10% means exactly that. A
player has an innate understanding of how likely they are to succeed,
and critcals (special successes) are easier to handle.

3.c._Jump_Governor______________________________________________________________
A dedicated computer system and accompaying connections.  The governor finely
regulates the transfer of energy from the High Yield Fusion Power Plant to the
Jump Energy Sinks, and thence to the Lanthanum Hull Grid.

3.d._Lanthanum_Hull_Grid________________________________________________________
A grid of Lanthanum wires implanted in the outer layer of the ship\'s hull,
spaced at about 1 meter intervals.  For design purposes, the grid is assumed to
occupy no volume and have no weight.  Installation of the Lanthanum grid does
not alter the hull armor rating.  Cost is Cr1500 per kilolitre of total ship
volume.

3.e._Jump_Energy_Sinks__________________________________________________________
These accumulate the energy produced by the High-Yield Fusion Power Plant, to
later release it rapidly into the Lanthanum Hull Grid during jump.  The sinks
hold 650 MW per kilolitre of energy sink.  It is also possible to install energy
sinks for use with a Black Globe.  The cost Cr300000 per kilolitre, but are
otherwise identical to Jump Energy Sinks.

The volume of energy sinks required can be computed as follows:
 
      V = P / 650
 
V = volume of energy sinks in kilolitres
P = power requirement of the jump drive in MW.
 
3.f._High-Yield_Fusion_Power_Plants____________________________________________
Fusion power plants that have been tuned for maximum energy production, at the

3.g._Time_to_charge_Energy_Sinks_______________________________________________
The process of jumping is essentially instantaneous.  Therefore, the primary
limitation on how rapidly one may jump is the time required to charge up the
energy sinks.  Should this time exceed two to three hours, the energy sinks may
suffer severe damage, initiating a process which concludes in the destruction of
the ship.
 
The time to charge energy sinks may be computed as follows:
 
  T = P X 60 / O
 
T = time to charge energy sinks in minutes.
P = power requirement on the jump drive in MW.
O = total power plant output in MW/hr.
 
3.h._Jump_Fuel__________________________________________________________________
All of the fuel consumed by the jump drive is consumed while charging the energy
sinks.  Once the vessel has entered jump, no more fuel is consumed by the jump
drive.
 
The amount of fuel consumed while charging the energy sinks may be computed as
folows:
 
  F = V X R X T / 60
 
F = volume of Jump Fuel in kilolitres.
V = volume of high-yield power plant in kilolitres.
R = jump fuel consumed per kilolitre of power plant.
T = time to charge energy sinks in minutes.

damage points between the high-yield fusion power plant and the rest of the
jump drive, much the same as the stats in the Imperial Encyclopedia.

the following TL chart will be useful:

reduced damaged/destroyed hit points.  The cargo volume is larger, but by only
2.8%.

    'body' => '     Dawn  came, throwing the wrinkled contours of the  bed  into
high  relief.  The sun climbed several degrees  and  the  shadows
crept about the room. Unaware, the alarm clock sounded the  start
of a new day. The two figures stirred on the bed.
     With  a  sigh  Clare pulled herself up and sat  on  the  bed
rubbing her eyes. Ynno got up and dressed quietly. "Did I dream?"
he asked, watching out the window.
     "Yes", said Clare listlessly.
     "Of her?", asked Ynno. Clare nodded. "I\'m sorry", said  Ynno
quietly.
     "So am I", said Clare, just as quietly. She walked over  and
stood  at  the  counter  top, absently  staring  at  the  kitchen
utensils.  There  was  a knock at the  door.  Something  twitched
across Clare\'s face and she looked at Ynno. He met her gaze for a
moment and looked at the floor and picked up his coat.
     She  opened the door a crack and Mr. Kelleu was  there.  She
opened it further and walked to the window. Ynno stepped  forward
and turned in the doorway to Clare. "Goodbye", he said sadly. She
nodded and kept staring out the window.

                              * * *

     Ynno left the shuttle and was met on the ship by a very tall
man who introduced himself as Julles. After dropping his bags  in
their cabin he bought drinks at the bar.
     "What  becomes  of me now?", asked Ynno. "Are you  going  to
scrap me? Or are you going to pick my brain apart in your labs?"
     Julles  smiled grimly. "Your contract has been  bought",  he
said simply.
     "Oh?  Are  you going to \'rehabilitate\' me then?" He  took  a
swig from his drink. "It won\'t work", he said defiantly. "You can
never take away my love. It\'s all I have left."
     Julles  swirled his drink and watched the depths.  "No",  he
said quietly, "You\'ll never forget. The pain will never ease. You
will always love her." He looked him in the eyes with a  resigned
smile. "It\'s taken me seventy years. She haunts me still."
     Ynno  stared confused for a moment. "Your contract has  been
bought by the estate of Kiertwith Konnoi. So was mine. There is a
card in the cabin for you with six hundred thousand in credit  on
it. You are free to do as you like."
     Ynno watched his drink stunned. "Just like that?"
     "Yes."  He waited for a moment to let it sink in.  "He  took
care of us while he was alive. If no one else did, he  understood
what  we felt. We\'ve formed sort of a collective. We talk,  work,
do research. Sell it back to the Imperium..."
     "So it is true?"
     "About Kiertwith and Ajin? Yes. They\'re dead now though."
     "But  the  robots.  He was an expert. He  designed  us.  Why
didn\'t he make it so she loved me?"
     Julles shook his head sadly. "Believe me, we all think about
it. It just wouldn\'t be her. It would be someone else.
     Ynno  looked  annoyed, "Then how can you, who say  you  have
carried the pain for seventy years, continue to make more of  us?
Is that not just making more pain?"
     Julles swallowed the last of the drink. "The program  hasn\'t
changed  since  Kiertwith first wrote it. We just  come  up  with
better  bodies. I started as a box. That\'s not the real  reason."
He  smiled sadly. "There was one pair, a few parsecs  away.  They
met under unusual circumstances and well... They did it.  They\'re
together.  I\'ve talked with him once. His happiness outweighs  it
all."  Ynno finished his and threw the glass away, still  looking
sceptical.
     "Travel around a bit", said Julles. "See what you want.  Our
doors  are always open." He left him then, hands in his  pockets,
staring at the receding planet through the bar window.




                            * * * * *

     Ynno eventually joined the Konnoi Collective and won  renown
in the field of poetry.

                            * * * * *

     Clare  left  her job and emigrated from  the  planet.  After
being  arrested for espionage the Imperium took pity on  her  and
she  now  works  for a local government  with  another  Kiertwith
model.

                            * * * * *
 
     After  coming  to irreconcilable differences  in  matter  of
policy with Ynno\'s Ajin model replacement, Sarion transferred  to
another governmental department.

                            * * * * *

     Bethula  still  works  as  Imperial  Liason  for  the  Taxan
corporation.

Bryan,
     Please upload the following to the TML:

 Michael Glew: Yes, GDW would be interested in seeing what your
 group has come up with. Send it either by land mail or via Bryan
 Borich.

 Lord Krieg: I would like to discuss your comments on the
 T2K/Dark Con D20 system in more detail. We\'ll be in touch.

 Adam Naylor:

 <why did GDW decide to change to Twilght 2000 mechanics?

 We think it is a good set of mechanics, and we see no reason to
 continually re-invent the wheel each time we do a new RPG.
 (Dangerous Journeys is the exception that proves the rule).

 **********

 R. Dired:

 <It was comforting to know that GDW doesn\'t want any substantive
 <imput for its new T2000 in Space...err, TNE.

 When did I say I GDW didn\'t want input? I said we weren\'t
 interested in outside DESIGNERS (We\'ve had very bad luck with
 outside designers). I said we didn\'t want huge documents, and
 urged people to brevity. And I also said (and this seems to be
 what ticks you off the most) that we were definitely,
 absolutely, positively going with the T2K mechanics.

 I say again: what we DO want are constructive criticism,
 and a few people who are willing to do reality checks for us.
 We want to know what you liked/didn\'t like about the old (Pre
 MT) rules, ditto for the MT rules, and ditto for the T2K
 mechanics.

 Perhaps you can answer this: If you do nothing but heap
 abuse on us, why should we pay attention to you?

Rob Dean asks how many Traveller combat systems there have been...
"Five or six?" Well, no, actually. Believe it or not, there have
only been two: Trav Classic\'s and MegaTraveller\'s. You could include
Striker as a third one but that was never considered official Trav
canon law.

I\'d like to interject my own two cents\' worth here: everyone has 
his or her own balance of playability, realism, and game balance
that is preferred for RPGs. It is absolutely impossible that a 
game will have a combat system that pleases everyone-- in fact,
the odds are good that a compromise will actually ALIENATE everyone
to a small degree, rather than wholly pleasing anyone at all. 

There are three approaches to this metaproblem:

1. The Historical Approach: The first few RPGs to be released, TRAVELLER
AMONG THEM!, had combat systems that were just designed to sorta work.
There was not yet a wide enough base of PRG-oriented experts (as opposed
to wargamers, whose priorities are different) to draw on for suggestions.
This meant that these systems formed a basis for the complaints that
led to later systems. 

2. The Diplomatic Approach: strike a balance between playability, game
balance and realism, and hope that you can sorta please everyone to the
point where they\'ll buy the game for its OTHER merits. I would class
MegaTraveller and RuneQuest in this realm, as well as many others.

3. The Extremist Approach: pick one area to maximize at the expense of 
others, and totally woo one sector of the buying public. This generally
falls into two categories: playability at the expense of realism (Star
Ace, Star Frontiers, and (if you feel like whining) Trav Classic) and
realism at the expense of playability (Space Opera, Fringeworthy, and
Phoenix Command). 

The moral is, NO ONE will be happy with what GDW does, because their
design philosophy is, and has been for at least six years, founded 
upon the Diplomatic Approach. The thing to do, which has been completely
forgotten in these days of Officially Approved Gaming Materials (TM),
is that rules systems can be customized to suit. If you think a system
leans too far in one direction, replace it with something that works.

I have a combat system for Trav Classic that I sort of shelved when
MegaTrav came out and seemed to address my concerns to some extent.
However, when TNE is released, I am going to give the combat system
a very critical look (I don\'t regard DC or T2k2 as good paradigms for
guessing, for several reasons). If I don\'t like it, and I am sure
I won\'t, I will either rewrite it extensively, or dredge up my old
Trav Classic combat system, which was and is the best system for MY
purposes I have ever used.

I have developed a number of tricks that apply to any game system I use,
that speed up combat while retaining realism. But these days I tend
to be sloppy about such things. My parties don\'t seem to mind, as long
as the game flows well. (Game balance at the expense of realism and
to some extent fast playability.)

People have asked what music I listen to while writing
this stuff.  Well, you\'ll find out a few selections here.

This one\'s quite a bit different from the others.  If at all
possible, I\'d reccomend reading this prolonged nightmare alone
at night during a thunderstorm.  If not, how about down in the
basement by candlelight?  |->

AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING\'S HAPPENING,
  BUT YOU DON\'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
	DO YOU, MR. JONES?

	Scott Kellogg
		- I -
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown.
You put your eyes in your pocket,
and your nose on the ground.
There ought to be a law against
you comin\' \'round
You should be made to wear ear phones.
	And you know something\'s happening,
	but you don\'t know what it is.
	Do you Mr. Jones?
		"Ballad of a thin man" -Bob Dylan

	Silence...
	Silence...
	I\'m lying in a vast black void.  How long have I been here?
Days?...  Years?...  Millennia?...  Hmm.  That\'s a problem.  I
believe I am Doctor Mako Malenkoviepr.  Well... I was the last
time I checked.  Or am I?  Or AM I?  Do I really exist?  Does
anything exist?  Or is it all an illusion in my mind?  I wonder
if I could be an illusion in someone else\'s mind?... So many
questions...  No answers...
	Does it matter?  Even if it does matter, does it matter that
it matters?
	All I can really say is:  apparently, I am.
	AAARRRRRR!! WHOAAAAH!  HEY!  That\'s cold!  What\'s going on?
Brrr!...
	It\'s gone now...  What was that?
	Yes, I am.  And there\'s no apparently about it.  But, who is
it that says I am?  In other words, who am I?  Hmmm.  Oh yes, I
think I know...
	Where am I.  Can\'t see a thing.  Total blackness.  But I\'m
thinking a lot clearer now:  I know who I am anyway...  That\'s a
start.
	I\'m lying on something.  I can feel a floor.  "Ok, let\'s
stand up doctor."
	Well, I can hear my voice any way....
	Try to stand.  Muscles are slow.  Ouch.  Stiff too.  But,
now that I\'m standing, where am I?  I still can\'t see.

	A ring of luminous fog suddenly glowed around the doctor\'s
legs.  Slowly, as though it were wavelets spreading out from a
stone dropped in a pond, the fog spread out slowly illuminating a
huge endless sea of thigh deep fog.
	A buzzing sound swept in from behind the him.  He whirled to
face it.  But as he turned it was fading off in the distance.
Another flew in from overhead but was off to the horizon before
he saw it.
	A third swept in.
	He turned to face it and saw a vague shape headed straight
for his face.
	He dropped to the ground, covering his head, shutting his
eyes tight.

	Hey, I\'m in a house!

	A comfortable study spread around Dr. Malenkoviepr.  Wood
paneling, a warm oil lamp, a large wooden desk, huge bookshelves,
hundreds of books.
	And what books!  I remember these...  Here are my old text
books on telepathy... awareness... physics... psychology...
sophontology... Wow, there\'s all my old children\'s books!  \'Burt
Dow Deep Sea Fisherman\', \'How and Why Book of Starships\'
\'Millions of Cats\', \'Vlezhdames and the Giant Peach\'.  I haven\'t
seen these in years!
	He picked up a book:  Oh yes, Burt Dow and Giggling Gull in
the Idely Tidely... I was about five years old.
	Here\'s one I don\'t remember.  What is this?
	A red hologram album.  Baby pictures of me.  Me at ten years
old.  Hey there\'s Chewersta!  I wonder what ever happened to her?
I haven\'t heard from her since I was nineteen... Hey! what\'s
this?  A hologram of us in the woods?  That\'s not possible...
There weren\'t any cameras around there...  Now this is getting
ridiculous...  Where did this hologram of us come from?...
	The buzzing swept in at the open window.
	Through the window was the sea of fog sweeping out to the
horizon.  Out of the black sky swept long fingerlike tendrils of
mist.  Reaching, grasping, probing.  They were almost to the
house.  Reaching out to grab...
	Mako slammed the window.  Outside, the silence was broken by
a huge gust of wind as the tendrils hit the house.  Whistling and
howling sounded all around.  The other window\'s in the house were
all Wide open.
	Got to move fast.  Close all the windows!  Move.
	Quickly, he ran into the next room.  The fingers were
sweeping up to the window.  Slam the window!  Lock it!
	Next room!  Again the probing tendrils were almost inside
when Mako slid the lock home.
	Mako flew about the house slamming windows and shooting the
bolts of the locks.  The tendrils flew to one window and the
next, and the next, and the next, and the next...  Down to the
first floor, to the large window next to the door, and the
kitchen, and the den, and...
	Just how many windows are there in this flaming house?
	He ran to the last window and slammed it down.  The glass
rattled as he shot the bolt.
	The wind battered impotently outside the windows.
	Ha!  They\'re all locked!  You can\'t get in!
	Wait... I didn\'t lock the window in the study!
	Up the stairs and on the right!  Run!  Go!  Go!  GO!  Into
the study!
	Suddenly, the window burst open.  Streamers of fog shot into
the room and flew about like confused birds.
	Slam the window and lock it!
	As the lock slid in place, the fog tendrils faded and
disappeared.
	Safe...  Silence...
	Mako slid to the floor, tired, but safe for the moment.

	Slowly, a book began to pull itself off the shelf.
	A telepathy text book opened by itself and it\'s pages began
to flip.
	He stared at the book as he lay on the floor. "Who *Are*
you?..."  The pages continued to turn...  WHO ARE YOU!?!"
	More pages began to flip.
	Malenkoviepr jumped up, grabbed the book and put it back on
the shelf.
	Slowly, a physics text came off the shelf, and began to read
itself.
	Contemptuously, he put that one back too.
	Slowly, several more books started abandoning the shelves
and reading themselves.
	Mako collected them, and shoved them back.
	A torrent of books flew off the shelves and began to flip
their pages.
	Angrily, Malenkoviepr grabbed for them, but as one went back
another came out...  And another...  And another...
	A mad contest of book pushing developed.  Books flying,
pages flipping.  Shelves revolting...

	Someone was laughing.

	Malenkoviepr shoved the last book on the shelf back.  He
growled angrily at the thought that someone was enjoying this
somehow.
	One last book lay on the desk.  The red hologram album.
	Slowly, it opened itself.
	Fury enveloped Malenkoviepr.  He turned to grab the book.

	Suddenly, he was walking in glue.  Paralyzed, watching the
nightmare world around him.  He watched as the book slowly
proceeded to show his life story in holograms.
	Born to a low, low station...  Baby pictures...  First
teeth...  First steps...  Psi testing...  First time meeting a
Droyne...  First school...  Becoming an Intendant...  Living with
the Droyne...  First girl friend...  First lover...  College...
Becoming a Droyne...  Becoming a Noble...  Joining SORAG...
First assignment...  Second assignment...  The ancient base...
The ancient warriors...  Their decision...  Orders...  Counter
Orders...  The destruction of the base...  The explosion...
	The next page appeared black.
	The page appeared to split into two opening doors.  On the
page, Dr. Mako Malenkoviepr, Honorary Droyne marched into his
superior\'s office.  The letter in his hand addressed:
"Lieutenant Baremkatlasche\'.  Personal.":  The resignation.  He
paced angrily about the office shouting at Baremkatlasche\'.  The
fool didn\'t understand the Droyne way, never would.  He could not
expect Malenkoviepr to prevent them from being what they are.
You can not make iridium into tin.  You can not make night into
day.  But the idiot didn\'t understand.  Wouldn\'t even try to
understand.
	I resign.  I will not be pushed around any more.  I refuse
to go against what I know is right.  Science is to improve life,
not destroy it.  Baremkatlasche\'s goals are not improvement, but
enslavement.  Any work for SORAG will be subverted.
	I resign!
	Doctor Mako Malenkoviepr slammed his the envelope onto
Baremkatlasche\'s desk with all his psionically enhanced strength.
A mug on the desk flew up a meter in the air fell back and
shattered.
	The page went black again.

	Suddenly, the hologram split open again.  Malenkoviepr
marched into Baremkatlasche\'s office a second time.  A second
time, he told his superior off.  A second mug smashed.
	I resign!
	A third time the hologram replayed itself.  A third mug
smashed.
	I resign!!
	A Forth...
	I resign!!!
	Fifth...
	I Resign!!!!
	I RESIGN!!!!!
	Malenkoviepr screamed out in fury.  He jumped to the desk
where the album laid.  Grabbed it.  Slammed it back into the book
shelf, and shouted out in psionic fury and hate, "I RESIGN!!!!!"
	A psionic right cross whipped out into the blackness.

	Suddenly, Malenkoviepr was back drifting in the black void.
	But I felt the punch connect...
		- II -
	The Interrogator shook her dark hair from her shoulders.
"The subject has exceptional psionic strength and determination."
	"How long will it take?"
	"Unknown, I will have to make some further tests.  But a
direct attack is not indicated here:  his defenses are too well
laid."

Leave your cares behind.
Come with us and find
the pleasures of the
journey to the center of the mind.
Come along if you care
Come along if you dare
Take a ride to the land inside of your mind.
Beyond the seas of thought,
beyond the realm of what\'s
across the streams
of hopes and dreams
where things are really hot.
		-The Amboy Dukes:  Journey to the Center of the Mind

	Malenkoviepr bounced down the beach at top speed.  The grav
harness absorbed most of his weight, but still gravity dragged at
him, keeping him grounded where evolution had put him.  Wind
gusted and he threw wide his metal wings.  He rose over the
windswept seas of Tesser.
	Tesser.  Land of the Droyne.  Home.
	His silver wings tugged pleasantly at his muscles as he
pulled himself aloft.  The winds were his.  He rose higher
seeking out the updrafts as he tacked up wind.  The rolling sea
below him shouted a challenge up to him and he dove to combat.
	Screaming down over the waves he dipped and rolled over the
blue foam.  The wave tips set up a deadly obstacle course that he
swept through with ease.  One dipped wing tip and he would drown:
no one can swim with five meters of wing span strapped on his
arms.
	Briefly he thought of the greater ease of regulation grav
belts, but no grav belt gave the user actual flight.  Altitude
must be fought for.  Flight is not mere movement while aloft but
a sonnet of motion.  Wings lend grace, poise, flow.
	The Droyne, his adopted people disdained grav belts.  Even
Mako\'s artificial wings seemed little better than crutches
compared with wings of flesh, bone and sinue.
	But even the Droyne were not the captains of the air.  Their
stubby wings were almost vestigial.  Evolution had turned them
away from the air.  Many of them could not fly at all.
	Of all intelligent creatures yet found, only one race truly
lived in the air.  The two Ael Yaels flew circled overhead.
	They soared on the blustery sea winds of Tesser.  Bat like
wings stretched five meters in wing span gave them the edge over
the tiny wings of the Droyne.  Their golden skin flashed in the
light of Tesser\'s sun as Mako rose on flashing wings to join
them.
	The two creatures were truly alien in flesh and mind.  They
evolved in a totally different ecological niche from Humans.
Aerial carnivores, nearly solitary creatures.  Far from Humans
and Droyne.  For example they had never developed a thing called
a government.  Trying to explain a nation to them was like
explaining sexual reproduction to an amoeba.
	They had the one system of running their planet no Human
world ever could even attempt:  anarchy.  (That which governs
best, governs least.)  Thus, they could safely be invited into
the Consulate, despite the fact that they were Imperial citizens,
For to them there was no great difference between one group of
humans and another.  Humans all acted the same to them.
	In a flash the two came together and rose almost vertically
in an ascending corkscrew, describing by their motion a double
helix.  Slowly they reached for each others talons.  As they
touched and grasped each other, they folded back their wings and
stalled.  They fell in a double hammerhead that sent them
plunging down.  Down toward the waves, they tumbled out of
control clinging to each other.
	Slowly, with great reluctance they released the others
talons and pulled out of the roaring dive and sped off with a
flash of golden wings in close formation.
	Mako banked and flipped just for the sheer joy of it.  He
leapt from wind to wind as an acrobat of the sky.  The winds gave
a thunderous applause as he flipped over into a showman\'s outside
loop coming out in a hammer head of his own.
	"CH-CH-CH-CH-CH-CH!" Kittan\'s warning crossed languages and
jolted him back to awareness of their mission.  Four frigate
birds flew in towards the emerging baby sea turtles.  Odd, how
the ancients had brought both species this far from Earth.  Mako
rolled and dove in hot pursuit.
	Hloch made the first pass at the flock of attackers.  The
carnivore\'s talons flashed, striking one from the air.  The other
three cried out in surprise and banked away.  Hloch dropped down
and caught his prey as it fell and sunk his teeth in.
	Kittan veered off after one of the frightened hunters.  The
frigate bird swooped avoiding her claws but not quick enough to
avoid her powerful tail.  The crushing blow nearly severed the
creatures wings and it went plummeting to the ground.  She dove
and caught the falling victim.
	Mako came into the fray slower than the others as the
remaining two frigate birds realizing they weren\'t pursued closed
back on the helpless turtles struggling across the sand.  Mako
had no claws or tail but simply battered both with his wings,
blasting them from the air.
	The sea turtles crawled on to the open ocean and safety as
the three scientists provided their air cover.
	On the ground the two Aels exchanged their catches and
proceeded to tear into the carcasses with vigor, feasting
hungrily on the bloodied birds.
	Mako swung in and landed close by.
	"Good hunting, Mako!" called Hloch.  The creature leapt to
retrieve one of the birds Mako had killed.  Hloch washed it
briefly in a tidal pool and held it out to Mako as he unstrapped
his arms from his silvery wings.
	It was a mess:  wing and neck broken, bleeding from the
eyes.  Mako grimaced at the sight of it as the alien scientist
held it, his face covered in the blood of his mate\'s kill.  He
seemed puzzled.
	Mako glanced into the Ael\'s mind.  "Why does this human not
take his own catch?  Does he intend to waste it?"
	At last Kittan spoke up.  "You two have been studying each
other for some time now.  Hloch, haven\'t you seen humans don\'t
like blood?  And you Mako, do you not see that we never hunt for
sport?"
	For a moment they stood watching each other, then Mako took
the carcass and carefully broke off it\'s wing.  The rest he
presented to Kittan who bowed her thanks and shredded the bird\'s
remains.  The other bird was presented to Hloch.
	He examined the wing he still held and attempted to gnaw it.
It was tough for his omnivorous teeth to pick apart raw, as the
Ael Yaels did, but it was for appearances anyway.
	Mako thought to himself, "Well, you were the one who wanted
to study avian sophonts weren\'t you?"
		- IV -
	"Well?"
	The Interrogator nodded, "The subject is responding to the
new direction of attack."
	"Turn up the pressure.  We need him."
		- V -
Come along if you care
Come along if you dare
Take a ride to the land inside of your mind.
But please realize,
you\'ll probably be surprised.
For it\'s a land unknown to man
where fantasy is fact.
So if you can,
please understand:
You might not come back.
		-The Amboy Dukes:  Journey to the Center of the Mind
	Malenkoviepr was alone on the beach.  A dark haired frigate
bird was sweeping in towards the crawling baby sea turtles.
	The gauss rifle came into his arms.
	Must protect the turtles!
	He opened up the gauss rifle on full automatic.  Ten rounds
of gauss needles went into the bird at hypersonic velocity.  Red
mist came down.  Tiny red fragments hit the ground.
	A great whirling noise came up behind him.  Slowly he turned
and saw a great dark cloud.  The cloud whirred and flowed as it
came.  A huge cloud looking like a flowing amoeba.
	It began to resolve itself into components.
	Hundreds upon thousands of frigate birds.
	Malenkoviepr grabbed a mounted VRF gauss gun.
	The air thundered with their wings as they came.
	The gauss gun vomited steel into the cloud.
	Hundreds dropped.  With their eyes open...
	They kept coming.
	The gauss gun rattled and thundered.  The cloud turned from
black to red.
	Still they came.
	One hundred meters...  One hundred fell...  Ninety meters...
Five hundred fell...  Seventy meters...  Five thousand fall...
Fifty meters...  Fifty thousand fell...  Forty meters...  One
million...  Five million...  Ten million...  Fifty million...
	All with their eyes open...
	The sky runs red with blood and feathers... Death wears a
hat and carries a VRF gauss gun...
	The eyes still stare...  Millions of dead eyes looked up
from the sand.
	The turtles crawl on towards the sea and safety...
	"The waves are retreating... The tide\'s going out...
They\'ll never reach it..."
	The sky was a bone white sclera, the setting sun, an iris
and pupil of a giant piercing blue eye.
	Slowly, the pupil expanded and swallowed the sky.
	Mako kicked a dead frigate bird splattering the sand black.
Slowly, it began to ooze a vile smelling black liquid onto the
sand.
	The blackness flowed across the sand to another frigate bird
corpse.  The second began to flow, and slowly it spread.  The
carcasses becoming gaunt as their blackness flowed freely from
them.
	A red orange glow came from behind Mako.  Slowly, he turned
to look.  Behind him the beach was littered with birds.  It
seemed to glow red all around him.
	He was looking into the eyes of a dead bird.  It was gutted
by a gauss needle and was bleeding black.
	The eyes caught the reflection of the rising reddish moon.
It hung on the horizon and seemed to grow deeper and deeper red.
	As the moon glowed so did the reflection in the eyes of the
carcasses on the beach.  The glow waxed as the sun waned.
Brighter and brighter and colder and colder, the eyes glowed like
tiny cigarettes, flaming... staring...
	The carcasses melted slowly and flowed across the sand.
All the while, the eyes stayed focused on Malenkoviepr.
	The blackness began to flow together.
	The slime climbed onto itself mounting and molding itself as
it flowed together with its flaming red eyes staring.  A hideous
parody of human legs began to form as the black ooze lumped
together.
	The blackness seeped up the legs and began to form a torso.
Higher and higher it rose.  Soon it was two meters tall and still
growing.  Distorted faces appeared in the mire of the forming
thing.
	Slowly, the thing formed itself into a grotesquely fat and
flabby torso.  A lump of a faceless head came into being.
Shoulder stumps began to shape themselves and then lengthen into
arms.
	Revolted, Mako grabbed the VRF gauss gun, swivelled it on
its mount and fired straight into its quivering flab of a belly.
	The gauss needles ripped open the black ooze, spattering it
like pudding.  The edges of the hole waved back like lips.
	Jagged teeth appeared in the gaping hole and the mouth shut
itself with a snap erasing any trace that it ever had been there.
	Mako pulled the trigger for another blast.
	Nothing happened.
	Quickly he rechecked the gun.  All in order?  Then fire!
	The gun kicked in its mount.  The projectiles flew into the
oozing black form, splattering the black ichor.
	The gun began to thump.
	Mako glanced down at the gun and back at the black figure.
The gun was firing sloppy black lumps of filth into the thing.
The globules were slamming into the blob, adding to its loathsome
mass.
	Quickly, Mako released the trigger.
	The gun continued to fire.  The thing was growing.
	He tried to turn the gun away from the thing.  The mount was
frozen.  He hammered on it with his fists.
	The gun continued to chug out the lumps of black ichor.  It
was growing.  Five meters tall and growing.  It towered into the
darkening sky, a quivering slime of a human blob.  The thing
flowed and shuddered as the slime jetted from the VRF gauss gun
into its abhorrent form adding to its bulk as it grew... topping
ten meters and still growing.
	It leaned the lump of its head back.  A cavernous, blood red
maw opened up and it let out a gurgling, strangling roar.  A
cloud of stench billowed from its gaping mouth like the rotting
of an open grave, while black ichor dripped onto its lump of a
torso.  The ichor flowed across the thing and reformed as part of
its huge frame:  twelve meters and climbing.
	The head came forward and glowered at Mako with a blind
face.  Slowly, two pits formed above the sealed gape of the
mouth.  The pits began to get covered over as eyes began to form.
	Mako backed away in horror from the forming beast, watching
as the pits molded closed lids over the rapidly growing eyes.  He
turned and ran as the thing towered past fifteen meters of
loathsome flabby filth.
	The darkness shrouded the beach with a purple sky while the
blood red moon stared at the scene.
	Mako ran across the sand to the dunes with his pulse
pounding in his ears.  Slick, spiky dune grass slashed at his
clothes as he ran over the sand shredding the fabric like razors.
Through the torn cloth, the blades sliced at his flesh.  His skin
ran wet with sweat and blood.
	He reached the foot of the first dune and climbed up the
steep sand pile on all fours.  The sand bit at the cuts on his
hands as though the skin was being peeled away from his bones
layer by layer.
	He topped the dune and glanced back.
	A hundred meters away, the thing\'s eye lids opened.  Inside
the eye was gloss black.  Dimly, a tiny red glow pulsed inside
the pit of the eyes.  It glowed dimly and then faded to
blackness,  then again it began to glow a little brighter than
before.  Again it faded away.  More brightly, the eye pulsed like
a beacon.  It glowed and flickered like a bright flame caught in
a wind.
	Then the eyes lit up brightly in a flaming blood red.
	Mako fled across the dune and into a dead forest.  The
leafless trees were sparse and monstrous while the blood moon
stared down at him.
	In the distance a thunderous sucking sounded like a foot
being pulled from a mire.  Then a pile driver came down and
smashed the ground.
	The thing had begun to walk.
	Mako ran under the sparse cover of the dead trees, the
sucking pile driver still coming:  battering its way after him.
He ran and ran through the wasteland forest.  Every few meters a
tree blocked his path and he narrowly avoided hitting them as he
ran through the darkness.
	The sucking pile drivers came closer as he ran.  Quickly, he
changed course in hope the thing would follow the straight line
he\'d been going on.
	For a moment he couldn\'t tell where the thing was going it
seemed to hesitate and then strike after him again following
closely.
	The sky light up with the red searchlights of its eyes as it
sought him.  A huge ripping sound came as trees began to be torn
from their roots as it passed through.  The stench of its breath
came down and hugged the ground like a fog.
	Suddenly, it was in front of Mako.  The red eyes towered
over the trees glowering at him.
	His heart in his mouth, Mako skidded to a stop.  He turned
and jumped...
	He sailed over the trees and into the night sky.  The trees
reached out their branches after him, but he flew over them.
	Slowly, he reached the top of his an and began to come down.
He clawed at the wind, but to no avail.
	Down he came through the slicing branches of the dead trees.
He landed in a thigh deep fog.  The ground squished under his
feet as he skidded to a stop.
	Again, he leapt into the air and safety.  "A few more jumps
like this and that thing will Never find me..."
	The prodigious leaps carried him fifty meters at a time.
Soon, he was out of the forest and on a fog covered plain.  His
heart soaring as he left the grotesque abhorrence far behind,
sucking and roaring impotently after him.
	"So long sucker!" he called after it as he reached the top
of an arc.  Slowly, he descended to the fog and sank in thigh
deep before touching the wet sloppy ground.
	The mud grabbed at his feet pulling him down.  He was up to
his calves and still going down.  He kicked at the muck as he
sank deeper.
	It flowed up his legs and over his abdomen.  He grabbed for
the plain grass growing in the mud, but it tore from its roots
leaving nothing to pull on.
	He sank up to his chest in bog stench with only his arms and
head above the stinking ooze.
	Red searchlights swept the horizon as the thing followed his
path.  Closer and closer it came.  Mako huddled down in the fog
trying to hide, but the fog was thinning rapidly at the thing\'s
approach.
	He could hear its sloppy pounding footsteps as it came on.
	Mako struggled desperately in the mire, grabbing for
anything to pull him out; but nothing came to hand and the mud
was too thick to swim and too liquid to support him.
	The thing reached the edge of the bog for it\'s pounding
steps turned ponderously to sloppy sucking sounds.
	It gurgled and howled its triumph.  The red eyes stared at
him as he struggled in the mire, illuminated in the beam of the
blood red search lights.
	"CH-CH-CH-CH-CH-CH-CH-CH-CH!!!!!" sounded from the sky as a
whirling winged form dove from the red moon in the sky.
	Mako barely recognized the Ael Yael before Hloch\'s talons
sunk into his shoulders and began beating wings over his head
trying to lift the trapped scientist.
	Agonizingly, millimeter by millimeter Mako began to rise
from the slime.
	Suddenly, the thing saw its caught prey escaping and
screamed in a horrible high pitched whistle.  It began pounding
across the bog sinking up to its knees in the muck.
	Hloch pulled and strained against the suction of the bog as
it pulled at Mako.
	The thing was upon them.  It screamed a gurgling laugh and
swatted the Ael Yael scientist to the ground.
	Hloch smashed into the muck with his wings crushed.  He did
not move.
	It reached for Malenkoviepr.  Outstretched, barrel thick
fingers stuck into the bog around him like a cage.  Over him the
hand of death closed in a fist blotting out the skies.  The ichor
flowed over his body and up his neck.
	It was cold as a winter slaughter house ripping the warmth
from him as it flowed up his neck and over his face.  He clamped
his mouth tight but it crept up his nose and into his throat
slowly, agonizingly filling his mouth and lungs.  Mako suffocated
as the slime oozed over him.
	The universe faded into blackness as Mako drowned in the
filth.

Mark volunteered the services of his work machine, his (HP\'s) disk space,

himself to improving the sci-fi RPG genre.  He has worked his butt off 
doing TDR, PBEM, and now TNE.  He also spend lots of time and money
researching alternate gaming systems (GURPS, Top Secret, AD&D, Space

While he can sometimes be abrasive, and seemingly less than tolerant, he
is a wonderful person who is a true benefactor to our pastime.  I for one
am glad to know him, and wish to publicly thank him for his and HP\'s time,

STEALING DONUTS, Part 3 of 4

	MC wasn\'t done with Gertie\'s donuts.  One word that certainly
describes the Commodore is persistent - very very persistent.  A few
days after MC\'s initial foray with the grav disk, she tried again.  She
planted one grav disk on the inside of the donut box cover, another on
the outside bottem of the box, and attached the last to a donut with
some frosting.  Then she waited for Gertie to arrive.
	Now the Commodore isn\'t exactly known for having a lot of get
up and go in the morning.  In fact, she is one of the great
recreational sleepers of the imperium, or at least it seems that way.
Gertie wandered into the mess and noticed that MC had gotten up before
her.  Instantly suspicious, she approached the donut box with caution.
She noticed the grav disk on the inside cover immediately.  She found
the grav disk on the bottem of the box seconds later.  She gave MC the
lift of that well-known blond eyebrow, appropriated the grav disks and
sat down.
	MC looked dissappointed; in fact, one could say that the
Commodore was having a mild pout.  It was a brilliant performance on
MC\'s part - Gertie was convinced that nothing more was in store for
her.   Now the Master Chief Sean, and MC knew that Gertie had taken
the donut with the grav disk attached.  Having seen MC attach the grav
disk myself, I knew the grav disk was on the plate too, but everyone
else in the mess was as clueless as Gertie.
	MC sat next to Thilia, looking for all the world like a child
who had been caught in the cookie jar.  But when Gertie had eaten her
way down to the level of the grav disk donut, MC made her move.  The
donut slowly and gently floated up, and then slowly it started floating
away.  
	Now the only things (other than the donut) that moved were
Gertie\'s eyes.  Her glance shifted from her reading to the donut as it
floating away.  Two blue eyes tracked the motion of the donut, one
blond eyebrow lifted, and then at the last possible moment her hand
whipped out and snagged the donut.  With an expression of
long-suffering patience, she detached the grav disk from the donut.
Looking over the tops of her reading glasses, she gave MC the sort of
look mothers give wayward children, and pocketed the grav disk.  MC
replied with a look of studied innocence.  Sean, standing at the
counter mixing his morning concoction, had a good laugh at the
tableau.  
- ----
	MC made one last pass at Gertie\'s donuts.  A few days later,
MC sent a grav disk through the mess and attempted to slide it under
a donut.  Gertie watched this display of remote control virtuosity with
vast amusement, and then relieved the grav disk of its cargo.  Gertie
tried very hard not to laugh when the empty grav disk arrived at MC\'s
table, but she didn\'t succeed.
	Sean, of course, was making his morning concoction while all of
this was going on.  There was only Sean, Thilia, me, MC, Rocky, and
Gertie in the mess - which is to say everyone in the mess knew about
Sean\'s "talents."  Sean had been watching the antics over Gertie\'s
donuts and finally decided he was going to play.  He leaned against the
counter sipping his concoction, and looked to all the world like part
of the fixtures.
	As soon as Gertie settled back down to her reading, the plate
lifted up and floated to the other side of her.  She went to grab another
donut, missed the plate, noticed its new location and glared at MC.
	"MC!"
	"What?"  MC turned in her seat to see Gertie.
	"Enough is enough."
	"Enough is enough what?"  MC was bewildered, and a little edgy
in reaction to Gertie\'s tone of voice.
	"You have my kind permission to quit messing around with the
donuts," Gertie growled back while lifting the plate to find the grav
disk.  She frowned when she didn\'t find one.
	" I didn\'t do it!"  MC protested, with vigorous sincerity.  The
look Gertie gave her said volumes about whether Gertie believed that.
	Gertie moved the plate within the crook of her elbow and
settled back to reading.  One by one, the remaining donuts floated off
the plate and repiled themselved in the middle of the table.  Gertie
reached for another donut, and immediately barked at MC.
	"Look Commodore, I\'m not amused any more."
	"Dammit, Your Commissionership, I didn\'t do it!  Look.  You\'ve
got one of my grav disks.  Here," MC held up two more, "here are the
other two - and I only made three!  Get off my case - I DIDN"T DO IT!!!"
	Gertie glared back.
	"And besides," MC continued, "do you possibly think I\'m so good
with a remote control grav disk as to make a pile like THAT!"  MC
pointed demonstratively at the neat pyramid of donuts in the middle of
the table.
	Gertie paused, and frowned in thought as she considered.  It was
then that Sean busted up.  Gertie turned and gave him one of those looks.
That only made Sean laugh harder.  
	Thilia, being blind, leaned across the table and insisted the
MC tell her what was going on (again).

    I have a recommendation for those on TML who are discussing the
conversion.  It is simply this: You need to look beyond T:2000.  Dark
Conspiracy is a more current game which incorporates and updates T:2000
rules into a more "Cinematic" type environment, which I see TNE as also
being.  Therefore if they can find a copy to look at, I recommend that they
look at DC as well.  Beyond that is the PC builders Folio from GDW.  It
contains several important corrections, additions, and options.  Particularly
it contains the D20 task system which I have heard rumored will be the one
used in TNE.  While I don\'t paricularly care for a flat progression, I feel
the D20 is more flexible than the D10.  It also has a system for creating
"Rogue E.T." characters which I can easily see being used for creating
Alien characters in TNE.  The Folio describes how to gain expertise on a
particular weapon,  and describes how level one skills are useful.


>From Myself:
    Expanding somewhat on Geo\'s comments, the PC Booster Kit (for DC) also
allows for characters obtaining more skills per term (something I had asked
for, and apparently recieved <grin>). In any case it\'s real easy to up the
skill points obtained in T2000 or DC, though admittedly making it official
is nicer. After all, one can always specify that all jobs get either 50%
more skills per term or even 100% (this also allows for younger characters
to be run which is something I prefer but which is harder to implement in
MT or in Traveller).
    And yes, the d20 system will be used in TNE.

    I\'ll also see if I can get a copy of a MT<->T2000/DC skill and PC
generation system uploaded that some people have worked up.

Okay, fine. I\'m perfectly willing to fess up to a lack of constructive tone.
The problem I have is that (in my eyes at least) I simply cannot agree, at
all, with some of the most basic decisions you are making.

First of all: Wouldn\'t a TNE/DJ be not only cheaper, but be an easy way to
expand the market of both? I\'m not kidding about this.

Second, and more importantly: There just doesn\'t seem to be any sort of 
moderating influence in GDW\'s game design. It\'s like old-time TSR/Gygax, where
rules seemed to be made on whim, and no matter how clearly they were shown to
be wrong, were stubbornly defended to the bitter end. Maybe T2K2 doesn\'t have
one-minute rounds or advancement based solely on murder/theft, but bad rules
are not discarded. Was a single rule thrown out from Trav to MTrav? It looks
to me like everything was just sort of thrown together. Sorted, yes, but 
nonetheless cumbersome and excessive (Animals encounters and armor, space
combat could have been melded into personal combat (a la Star Cruiser) and
made easier and more interesting, no tasks in character generation, damage
values for weapons - some sensible, some not, were virtually unchanged and
simply welded onto striker\'s quick and easy penetration system, etc.). 

I and others could, if we thought we weren\'t wasting time, add heap helpful
ideas, but the problem is that we are in the position of fixing one that
hasn\'t even happened yet. 

For example: If (in T2K2) effective skill asset was (Stat x Skill)^(1/2),
rounded up (it has to be up to get a good curve), one-year term characters
would actually be close to viable. As it stands, they aren\'t. I personally
believe the chance of this becoming a rule is about as large as the chance
that a non-Hp (read: all humans have about the same damage absorbing capacity)
damage system. Who is supposed to like that?  One almost wonders if anyone
playtested T2K2 (I liked version one...) who wasn\'t already sold on the
product. The randomization of initial Initiative is simply to great. Small
arms are too similar to print that many stats on them (and pictures -- I\'d
normally add an insult here, but I think you get the idea). I can stomach a
d20, but am curious about what\'s so great about it. It just seems like more
numbers to me. I could write down an itemized list of problems and suggestions
if you want, but I\'m not going to bother unless I think it might not be a
waste of my time.

The point is, when you don\'t think anything\'ll happen, we\'re (I\'m, actually,
as I\'m sure there are others who feel different) supposed to what? Stoically
and silently watch a game we (I) liked degenerate? You are quick to dismiss
any negative comments as attacks, and then ignore them. In the same vein, if
the game quality doesn\'t improve, I shall just as quickly dismiss your
products. If this doesn\'t bother you, then hey, I guess I\'m the one who was
foolish.

RE: Jump Drives

The variant posted for Jump drives looks very workable and it appears
as though a lot of work went into the project.  However, I think that one
of the objectives of TNE is to simplify some of the systems rather than
go the opposite direction.  (If your variant was not a suggestion for
TNE, forgive me for speaking out of place.)  In fact I could well do without
a vehicle design system (at least initailly) as long as GDW published a
supplement (ALA NATO VEHICLE GUIDE) that had a variety of vehicles for
each TL (5+) (While 101 vehicles is a useful supplement, it did contain
several designs which were not that useful or practical).  I do believe
that a simple starship design system is a must.

RE: Character "Templates"

I have a suggestion that I would like some feedback on:

In keeping with making TNE more new gamer friendly, I suggest having
a number of character templates which could be filled out with minimal
trouble.  What I propose is take the 6 - 12 most popular character types,
and give them the average stats needed for that type and the basic skills.
Then the player would get a number (pre-determined or random, I like random)
of points with which to improve the stats, and a number of points to divide
up between a list of skills appropriate for that career.  Since 3 terms is
about optimum for characters, I would make the template characters for that
point.  You could even list some basic equipment on the sheet.  Thus, a
new player would have minimum decisions about creating his character, and
could get into play relatively quick.  The system would be a bit more
complicated than that used in the STAR WARS RPG (at least a little bit),
but would have the same basic effect - a simple character generation system
for the new player.  While it would be optimum to have each character on
its own sheet (easy to photocopy and further simplifying the process),
space considerations and all might dictate reduing the size.  I think
the 1-2 pages that it would need (short form) would be worth the investment.
Opinions?  Comments?  Suggestions?

Character Templates are a large, LARGE step in the direction of 
playability/simplicity vs. realism/complexity. I, personally,
regard the character creation process as the single most important
part of gaming, and am loath to encourage cookie-cutter characters.

I will, however, suggest another area which CAN and SHOULD be 
simplified by templating: combat, either between individuals
or between starships. This is an idea I have used extensively
in the past, and while I have not yet tested it on the T2k2 rules
or any of their ilk, it has worked exceptionally well for Trav Classic
and many other rules systems. The basic idea is as follows: 

Most characters have a particular set of equipment that doesn\'t
change all that much over the course of a campaign. They usually 
wear the same kinds of armor and protective gear, and in these days
of the collapsing Imperium they are even more likely than before to
travel with the same types of weapons regardless of where they are.
Their skills change only slowly, as do their stats. Furthermore, when
they use a particular weapon, one can make an educated guess as to the
range and armor of the opponent for better than half of the cases 
encountered: pistols are more likely to be used against targets at
short or medium range, blades only at close or short, longarms at
medium or long, etc.

What this means is that for each of his weapons, a character can have
a couple of task rolls pre-worked-out on his character sheet, to cover
the vast majority of situations under which the weapons are used. The
referee can add or subtract from those Combat Sheet Baselines (CSB\'s, 
as I call them in my modified Trav Classic rules) on the fly:

"I normally need an 8+ to hit him...."
"Make that an 11+, he\'s under cover."
"Made it anyway. And a 7+ to penetrate...."
"Only 5+, his armor is flimsier than you\'re used to."

These baselines usually take up only a few lines at the bottom of a sheet,
and are immensely handy for staying within the rules and speeding up the
die rolling in combat situations. A set of characters who are used to the
baselines, and a ref who has the mods involved (if any) well in hand, can
get through an entire melee in almost realtime with this setup. 

This doesn\'t fall so much into the area of "New Rules," Bryan, but I\'d
appreciate it if you\'d pass it on to GDW. If simplification of something
as important and fun as character generation is going to be considered,
then simplification of something as dreary and dice-laden as combat should
be as well. (My biases are showing; my favorite combat system involved 
slightly more die rolls than Trav Classic but fewer than MT.)

I think there are several reasons why each separate drive system has its own
power plant:
1 - don\'t put all your eggs in one basket.  A ship with one drive system could
have all its drives knocked out with one hit.
2 - energy production vs. fuel efficiency.  The jump drive power plant needs to
produce massive quantities of energy fairly quickly.  A half-hour is a common
time to charge energy sinks.  On the other hand, large amounts of fuel are
required.  You literally can\'t run most high-yield fusion power plants for more
than an hour or two, because you can\'t carry enough fuel to power them for a
longer time.

Keep in mind that in my suggested jump drive rules, I have never said that you
_coudn\'t_ divert power from your jump drive power plant to power weapons.  In
fact, the diversion of power from your main power plant to charge energy sinks
("jump dimming") appears to have been a common practice in the 1st Imperium.

As regards whether these rules are suitable for TNE, let me make the following
observations:
o	Classic Trav had a set of simple ship design rules, that allowed one to
	design commercial vessels and small military vessels with a minimum of
	effort.
o	Later on, High Guard provided a more complicated design system, oriented
	around the design of military vessels.
o	Still Later, Striker provided a design system for Vehicles, though still
	oriented around military vehicles.
o	The triumph of MT was the integration of High Guard and Striker into one
	compatible design system.  This triump was also the failure of the game,
	because the design process is now several orders of magnitude more
	difficult then in Classic Trav.  This is one of the reasons people have
	tended to shun the game, opting to play RPG\'s that don\'t burden the Ref
	with such a difficult design system (or often, with no design system
	at all).
o	similar things happened with planet generation, merchant rules, combat
	rules, etcetera.

If TNE is to have the appeal that Classic Trav had, I would suggest a marketing
move that was first taken by TSR with DND:  A Basic and Advanced Rules System.

Basic Trav would be a simplified version of the MegaTraveller Rules.  A 
simplified vehicle design system, in the spirit of the Classic Trav system.
An advanced designer\'s sourcebook would provided the remainder of the design
rules.  Much the same with planet generation, merchant rules, combat rules, etc.
It is most important that the Basic and Advanced Rules be downward compatible:
the Basic Rules should not allow one to design a vessel that won\'t fly under the
Advanced Rules.

In principle of course, it should be possible to do this with the existing MT
rulebooks, but this move would make the entire game less intimidating to new
players, which is necessary if the game is to continue to grow in popularity.

As regards the question of character templates, I would point out that there is
a historical precedent for this move.  In all of the Classic Trav Adventures,
there were provided at the front of the Adventure book a set of pre-generated
characters.  No drawings or histories of course, but the idea is there.  I would
not recommend leaving out altogether the character generation system, but the
templates would be provided for novice players.

About a week ago, an SDB got waxed in the 4.5th Frontier war.  It
was an old book 2 design actually, but here\'s a MegaTrav version
for you.

The Stingray is a common SDB used in Ikar (Foreven) sector.  Many
of these ships were originally based in the Imperial parts of the
Spinward Marches.  However, as their age became advanced, these
have been retired and sold off or given to the independant planets
of the sector.  The have become another pawn in the old game of
influence gathering common to the sector by Imperials and Zhodani. 

However, the security of the independant planets is sometimes less
than stellar.  Thus some Stingrays are sometimes found in pirate
service.

Following up on Bryan Borich\'s request for ideas about Character templates,
here\'s a sheet I worked up last year to keep track of weapon stats and to-hit
tasks for T2K2 characters. My group\'s found it useful to have that information
charted out as baselines for quick reference. I\'d guess that\'d go doubly for
new players. 

The sheet\'s set up to record one character\'s primary weapon data. Enter the
recoil data for the weapon as an increasing total per shot or burst for each of
the 3 sections: AIMED, QUICK, and AUTO FIRE. Then, calculate the various to-hit
task numbers in the body of the chart accounting for range, recoil, and burst
size deductions. 

It won\'t fit on one page if printed as ASCII. Originally, I did this up in
PostScript in point size 6, which let me squeeze the whole sheet plus some
other combat info like unarmed and melee combat stats (and house rules) on an 
8 1/2 x 11 page. The ex-hippies I game with griped about tired old eyes, 
though :-) 

Feel free to pass it on to any interested party, hope it is of use.

Regards,
Brian

	compatible design system.  This triump was also the failure of the game,
	because the design process is now several orders of magnitude more
	difficult then in Classic Trav.  This is one of the reasons people have
	tended to shun the game, opting to play RPG\'s that don\'t burden the Ref
	with such a difficult design system (or often, with no design system
	at all).

          Hear, hear.  Does anyone else out there still fool with
          _High Guard_?  Owing to circumstances - feeding the Time
          Vampires in grad school - I drifted away from organized
          Travelling awhile back, but I still use the design system
          as a means of doodling; you can flesh out ideas without the
          heroic endeavor required by MT.  The USP is a lot easier to
          grasp than the current format, to boot.

NOTES:

EW = Energy Weapons: can shoot one shot per combat round.


Notes:
1. The recoils are probably way out of wack.  When I originally created
this list it was for a conversion to MT stats, consequently I increased
the recoils.  When I made up the list for transmission, I converted back
but the process was open to error.
2. The Kevlar helmet should probably be TL 8.
3. Energy weapons should have an rof of 1.
4. There is some disagreement with the damage, penetration, and recoil
values I have assigned to the higher TL weapons.  I am open for opinions.
5. The lower TL weapons were derived from T2K sources.

Well, that\'s it for this load.  I have a character generation worksheet
somewhere, If I find it, I will send it later.  As I mentioned, I am
ready to make some changes to this system - not radical ones, but ones
that I see need to be done.  Watch for it later this week.

Yours for Traveller,

Geo.

THE REBELLION
At 1125, the Rebellion has raged on and dragged on for 8
years, two terms, and has effected every sentient in the
Imperium, and many outside the Imperium.  To reflect this
effect on the characters perform the following:

Before the first term roll 1D10:  a 1 indicates that the
rebellion just started and the character must submit to the
draft, a 2 or 3 indicates the character can wait one term
before submitting to the draft (this roll indicates that the
character was 13 when the Rebellion started, and is drafted
at age 17 - 4 years - 1 term - later.

Before each subsequent career, a 1D10 roll of 3 or less
indicates that the Rebellion has started.  Characters must
submit to the draft unless in a draft exempt career (noted in
the SPECIAL section of applicable careers) .  If the
character has served 4 terms (age 33+) he is exempt from the
draft unless he has any skill over 6, in which case his
specialty is needed, and he is drafted anyway but put in a
non-combatant role.

In any case once the Rebellion has started all characters
must serve two more terms, except characters who were 13 when
the Rebellion started.  In the latter case those characters
only serve one term.  Characters who are not drafted must
either remain in the career which is exempt, or join the
military.  Exempt characters who turn 33 after one term of
Rebellion and do not have any skill above 6 are free to
change careers at that point.

Even characters finishing a term in the military should check
for the start of the Rebellion, because they will have to
remain in "for the duration".

DRAFT TABLE
DIE  SERVICE
 1   ARMY
 2   COACC
 3   MARINES
 4   NAUTICAL FORCE COMMAND
 5   NAVY
 6   SCOUTS

All are enlisted in the regular component of the respective
service.  If the character has an undergraduate degree, and
is drafted into the SCOUTS, he goes to ADMIN rather than
FIELD.

DECLARATION OF REBELLION - Players who are generating their
characters and do not wish them to get to old by waiting for
the Rebellion, may declare that for that character the
Rebellion will start after the current term.  The character
is then completed as though the start of the Rebellion had
been rolled randomly.

SHIPS

To determine if a character receives a ship, roll 1D10 and
add the number of terms over one that the character spent in
the career which made him eligible to receive the ship.  If
the roll is 9+, the character receives a ship of the type for
which he is eligible.  If it is a ship that must be
purchased, 9 indicates receipt of the ship, and results
greater than 9 indicates 10 years of payments for each number
above 9.

For example, Jason Fairweather spent 3 terms as a rogue and
finished his career with 2 terms as a Merchant Officer.  The
merchant officer time makes him eligible to receive a ship.
He rolls 1D10 and gets a lucky 10.  To this he adds 1 (2
terms minus the first term) for a total of 11.  This means he
gets a ship and 20 years of payments have already been made
(11 - 9 = 2).

Merchant Ships, Safari Ships, Seekers, and Yachts require
payments.
Corsairs and Scouts do not.

Merchant Ships may be Free Traders, Far Traders, or
Subsidized Merchants (referee\'s choice).

TRAVELLER AID SOCIETY

Roll 1D10 and add 1 for each term above 1 served in a career
that offers Traveller Aid Society membership.  If the roll is
9+ the character has become a member of TAS.

MILITARY CAREERS

NOTE: If a character has served more than 3 terms he cannot
switch between military career groups (Army, COACC, Marines,
Nautical Force Command, Navy, or Scouts).  Military groups
feel that by that time characters are to old to retrain.
Also, a character cannot switch career groups more than once
(although he may switch several times within a group if
alternates are available).  Finally, a referee should
seriously examine any character wishing to join the military
after 3 terms as a civilian.  The draft is, of course,
different in this respect.

Hi All.
   I recently completed Megatraveller 2, the computer game,but
I had to edit some stats of my characters because I could never 
get them to advance.  
    Has anyone been able to get characters trained at the centers?  
If so, what are the qualifications for becoming eligible for this 
training?

   I\'ve encountered x-ray lasers in a campaign setting. My research attached:
if I\'m wrong or anyone can add anything, please do so. (I\'m fishing for more
information.)

X-RAY LASERS
 ============
   The regular laser works by exciting a crystal. The material used limits
what input and output can be handled.
    Note: U.S. materials refer to output levels that can be repeated: the
material in the crystal is not ruined. Some Russian firsts actually represent
a one-shot use that burned out the crystal -- which anyone could have done.
Some of those high figures found their way into SDI threat estimates.
   Thus, characters can improvise the "one-shot laser weapon" by altering a
device (defeating safeguards) and burning out its crystals. These are always
one-shot devices.

   An X-ray laser is at a higher wavelength than regular lasers, and catalyst
materials do not operate reliably at those frequencies. The energy input
causes an energy release before the intended frequency is achieved.
   Consequently, SDI (and 2300AD) look at using nuclear explosions and one-
shot crystals to generate X-ray laser beams. (The higher frequency requires
much more power in the same time span, so you need a actual nuclear explosion
to power it.)

EFFECTIVENESS
 =============
   The higher energy levels in an X-ray beam make the weapon _several times_
more lethal.
   The wider wavelength limits penetration: X-ray lasers would be ineffective
below 100 km in the Earth\'s orbit. (Limits use in planetary bombardment, and
cannot be used in thin or thicker atmospheres.)
   The limited penetration and higher energy combine to act as a physical
impact on the target. Instead of a hole through the craft, you have concussion
damage and equipment shaken up.
   The beam would be wide, so so an orbital battle station could hit multiple
targets with one shot. This applies mainly to hit decoys and the protected
item, because otherwise things wouldn\'t be close enough together. The decoys,
being lighter, would react more to the X-ray hit, permitting identification of
the protected target even if it is not destroyed.

at which the characters must make saves to avoid the reduction of stats). Now,
the table may be appropriate based on the medical care we have today, but not
what it\'ll be like in 2000-3000 years! I\'ve ignored the aging rolls for almost
as long as I\'ve played, since they make no sense to be as low as they are for
a much more technologically advanced culture. I also have a problem with the
fact that even if a character recieves a promotion every term, they will almost
never serve more than two terms at the highest rank. This makes no sense that
the military is going to force out their generals and admirals as soon as they
get to that rank. The maximum voluntary number of terms (6, I think) should be
extended for those of high rank (say 4+) by one term, with an additional term
per level of rank past 4 (so an Admiral could serve 9 terms (36 years, minimum
age of 54)).

How about cartridge-firing lasers?  Each cartridge contains a crystal, plus
anything else that is expended in one shot.  You only get a few shots
compared to the hundreds of a normal laser, but more powerful shots - sort
of like a .44 magnum revolver has fewer shots than a water pistol.

Does this also rule out x-ray lasers as hand-held weapons, or make them short
range weapons like plasma guns?

Was the rate of fire really that slow, in the Napoleonic wars
a ship of line like "Victory" could load and fire 3 broadsides
per minute. Did they slow this down that much by the Civil War?

I have not studied the Civil War Naval Battles all that much, so
I really have no clue as to what the rate of fire should be, it 
just seemed slow to me. Especially since the the Virginia\'s 
gun deck was more on the lines of a traditional lower gundeck 
on a ship of the line.

Now this rate of fire I understand because of the Turret 
configuration.

From:   M.GELINAS                       Mark E. Gelinas
Sub: Careers

Greetings,

Earlier this year, a desire was expressed for ideas on how to create new
careers for the Twilight Family of Games.  What follows are guidelines
which I have found useful.

GUIDELINE FOR CREATING NEW CHARACTER CAREERS

This article is intended for the creation of new character careers for
the TWILIGHT family of games including: TWILIGHT:2000, MERC:2000, DARK
CONSPIRACY, and will probably apply to TRAVELLER: THE NEW ERA.  These
guidelines can be used to a lesser extent for CADILLACS AND DINOSAURS.


Since this article is intended for the TWILIGHT family of games, it
will primarily give numbers for the 1D10 task system.  Numbers for the
1D20 task system will appear in brackets.  To illustrate the process, a
new career for TRAVELLER: THE NEW ERA will be created.


When creating a new character career, you must first address several
questions.

First, is a new career type even necessary.  That is to ask can the
career you are proposing be covered under some other currently
available career.  It may be that only a note or two, or the addition
of a skill to a current career can make it useful for the career you
propose without the trouble of creating a whole new career path.

Second, is the career one which players will select for their
characters.  While sanitation engineer might be a unique career, not
many, if any, players would select it for their characters.  You need
not create a whole new career path just to create NPC\'s.  Just write
down what skills you think they should have and let it go at that.

Third, is the career interesting.  The answer to this largely depend on
the audience for which it is intended.  If it is only intended for your
local group, then the group\'s consensus is all you need.  If it is
intended for a larger audience, for example for publication, then it
should be interesting enough to appeal to a wide variety of players.

If the answer to all these questions is satisfactory, then you should
proceed.  For our example, we have decided that the people who maintain
life support systems for cities would be in demand and offer some role
playing possibilities.

TITLE

The first thing to consider is what to call the career.  The name
should be general in nature to cover apply to a wide variety of
situations.   While IMPERIAL SCOUT would adequately describe a scout in
service to the Imperium, other human interstellar governments probably
have similar services, so SCOUT would be more general and appropriate.

For our example, we have chosen the title, SYSTEMS ENGINEER.

ENTRY

This section lists the prerequisites for the particular career.  If it
is a career anyone can enter then list "No prerequisites".
Prerequisites are usually of four kinds.

The first is a requirement based on the character\'s attributes.  While
this is ordinarily a physical attribute (STRENGTH, CONSTITUTION, or
AGILITY), there are instances when the other attributes (INTELLIGENCE,
EDUCATION, or CHARISMA) may apply.  Remember that the average character
will have a value of 5 [10] in an attribute.  Therefore, unless the
career requires a minimum of 5 [10] then you should not list attribute
requirements of 5 or below.

The second type of requirement is one of education.  Determine if the
career is one that would ordinarily require secondary education.  If
so, then list the type and level of education required.

The third type of requirement is one of skills.  This requirement is
usually for those careers which would ordinarily follow a different
career.  For example, a security guard would require small arms skill
which would usually be obtained in a military career, but could be
obtained through a secondary activity.

The final type of requirement is one of prior service in some type of
career.  For example the Mercenary career in DARK CONSPIRACY requires
some prior military experience.  Usually a prior career requirement is
for that type of experience which could not be obtained otherwise.
While small arms could be learned outside a military career, combat
experience usually can not.

For our example, we have determined that a SYSTEM ENGINEER requires an
Undergraduate degree.

SKILLS

At this point, I will digress momentarily and discuss number of skills.
On the average, the TWILIGHT:2000 character will receive 5 [10] skills
per term.  DARK CONSPIRACY, with its more cinematic nature, award its
characters with an average of 7 [14] skills per term.  Because
TRAVELLER: THE NEW ERA characters should also be larger than life, use
the 7 [4] level for them as well.

Usually 1 [2] of these skills are from secondary activities, but
careers which could allow more outside activities can provide 2 [4]
skills in secondary activities.  You might also consider the higher
secondary activity award if the career only offers a limited number of
skills.  This tends to make the career a little more inviting.

One other note on skills, you should work with the skill list of the
game for which you are writing the career.  Be careful about adding or
creating new skills.

FIRST TERM SKILLS

This is where the career designer lists those skills which the
character in the first term at this career should obtain.  There is a
lot of judgement call involved in this portion.  First you must
determine what are the minimum basic skills required to accomplish the
job.  Then you must determine which are the most important of those.

A person completing their first term of a career should be reasonably
competent at their jobs, which means they should have skill levels of 3
- - 4 [6 - 8] in their skills.  Of course if the career has a number of
basic skills, you will probably have to reduce the level to 1 - 2 [2 -
4].  [With the higher number of levels available with a 1D20 system you
have a little more flexibility.]

It may be that there is only one or two basic skills required.  Then
you may want to award moderate levels in those skills and offer a
choice between a number of other skills, perhaps representing a
specialty within the chosen career.

It is possible to violate the normal skill level awards for the first
term in a career and award more skill levels.  However, you should use
this with caution as players may tend to have their characters jump
from career to career to gain the maximum possible skills without
regard to character concept.

Another option to consider is eliminating secondary activity awards for
the first term and using those skill levels for the first term.  You
should, however, justify this by explaining what the character is doing
that will prevent him from pursuing secondary activities.  For example
a first term Doctor receives no secondary activity award, but that is
because of many hours spent in intern and residency.

For our example we determine that the SYSTEM ENGINEER should receive
CHEMISTRY 1 [2], COMPUTER 2 [4], ELECTRONICS 2 [4], and MECHANICS 1 [2]
in his first term.  This is 6 [12] skill levels, which, with the
secondary level[s] makes 7 [14] for the term.  While some of these
levels are rather low, I have taken into account two factors - the
character probably received some COMPUTER skill as a background skill,
and some of the other skills during his undergraduate education.  Also,
I reasoned that a first term SYSTEM ENGINEER would probably be working
under supervision, and therefore not require as high a level as a
person who would be working on his own.

SUBSEQUENT TERM SKILLS

Here you will be tempted to list just about every skill that there is,
rationalizing that the skill COULD be used in the career.  A rule of
thumb that I have used that 16 to 20 different skills is a reasonable
number.  Some careers may offer fewer, but if you list more than 20,
take a hard look at what you have listed and see if all those skills
really need to be there.

You can usually eliminate skills by asking two questions.  Is this
skill routinely used in this career?  Is this skill ordinarily taught
by this career?  If the answer to both is yes, then consider keeping
the skill.  You will find that the first question is answered "yes"
more often than the second.

If you have gone through your list and you still have too many, then
take a second look.  Which skills are used the most often?  Which
skills can be picked up through secondary activities?  If they are
infrequently used and are available through secondary activities, then
you can safely eliminate them.

Sometimes you may find that you have just the opposite problem, too few
skills.  If you have less than 10 skill offerings, go back and add some
skills which may be infrequently used or which relate to other skills
that you have listed.

One other consideration, the skills listed for first term skills should
normally be included in subsequent term skills unless the first term is
the only time that training is offered.

For the SYSTEM ENGINEER\'S Subsequent Term Skills we have:  ADMIN,
COMPUTER OPS, ELECTRONICS, JACK-OF-TRADES, MECHANICS, POWER PLANT OPS,
SCIENCE, SENSOR OPS,  VACC SUIT, and ZERO-G ENVIRON.  Since this is
only 10, and we reason that the SYSTEM ENGINEER would have adequate
spare time, we will allow that career only 5 [10] subsequent term
skills but 2 [4] secondary activities.

CONTACTS

The career should always have a minimum of one contact per term.
Careers which have more public exposure or more travelling may gain an
additional contact.  Adding a third contact is one way to spice up what
could otherwise be a lackluster career.  However, you should be able to
justify how the character could meet that many contacts.

Another thing to consider is the "foreign" contact.  This could mean a
person from another "country" or one with an unusual background or
skill.  For TRAVELLER, it could also refer to an alien contact.  If the
character is unlikely to come in contact with a "foreigner" then set
the level at 10+ [19+].  The more likely a character is to come in
contact with a "foreigner", the lower the roll should be, but 7+ [13+]
should be normally be the lowest.

To determine the type of contacts, refer to other careers of the
particular game for which you are designing the career.  That should
give you a list of different types of contacts.  Select the ones which
you feel would be appropriate for the career.  2 - 3 contacts different
types is a good number for a career.  Careers more limited in scope
might have as few as 1.


In or example, we determine that the SYSTEM ENGINEER can have one
contact per term, Specialist (System Engineer) or Government.  The
contact is foreign on a 1D10 roll of 10+ [1D20 roll of 19+].

SPECIAL

The special is a catch-all heading for any special circumstances
involved with the career.  Usually this category will list the number
of secondary activities allowed, if different that 1 [2]; any variance
on starting money, i.e. no money for the term, double money for term or
basing money on a different attribute or skill.

Special can also include any mandatory follow on careers, benefits
received upon the career\'s end, initiative bonuses, or even the
possibility of being wounded or going to jail.

The items here are not the limit of the special category, but rather a
description of the more common ones.

For our example, the SYSTEM ENGINEER is allowed 2 [4] secondary
activities per term.  Since his job is important to the community, we
will also double his starting money.  This also makes the career a
little more attractive.

Some game systems include a little story just after the title which
summarizes the job and gets the player involved into the role.  I have
not used any for the careers I have created, but I get the impression
that TRAVELLER: THE NEW ERA will include them.

That about completes the process, the final step is to put it into a
readily usable form using standard phraseology.  For that refer to the
game system for which you are creating the career.


Give it a try, and send me a copy of the careers you come up with.  If
I have room, I will print some of the best in the next issue of the
TIMES.


SYSTEM ENGINEER

ENTRY: Undergraduate Degree

FIRST TERM SKILLS: CHEMISTRY 1 [2], COMPUTER 2 [4], ELECTRONICS 2 [4],
MECHANICS 1 [2]

SUBSEQUENT TERM SKILLS: A total of 5 [10] skill levels from one or more
of the following:

ADMIN, COMPUTER OPS, ELECTRONICS, JACK-OF-TRADES, MECHANICS, POWER
PLANT OPS, SCIENCE, SENSOR OPS,  VACC SUIT, ZERO-G ENVIRON

CONTACTS: One per term, Specialist (System Engineer) or Government.  On
a 1D10 roll of 10+ [1D20 roll of 19+] the contact is foreign.

SPECIAL: SYSTEM ENGINEERS may select two secondary activities/
characteristics per term.  When calculating starting money, each term
as a SYSTEM ENGINEER counts as double.

Item    5404306                 92/06/27        02:05
From:   M.GELINAS                       Mark E. Gelinas
Sub: Update to Conversion Guide

Greetings again.

Earlier this year, a number of HIWG members had a E-Mail discussion on
the shape of character generation in TRAVELLER: THE NEW ERA.  Out of
these discussions came a lengthy conversion guide which included
some of the discussions, a character generation system with character
generation sheet an character sheet, and a list of Traveller weapons and
armor intended to allow players to start using the Twilight system for
their Traveller games.

In the ensuing time, I have learned a bit more about the shape of TNE,
have talked with people some more, and have received feedback on the
guide.  What follows are my recommendations for updating the guide.

UPDATES TO THE TRAVELLER CONVERSION GUIDE

Since the time that the Guide has been published, I have
reviewed it and received some feedback on it.  Listed below
are recommended changes to the guide.

A. Parts I - III are my INITIAL recommendations.  What
follows in parts IV and beyond are the result of many
discussions with fellow HIWGers and some playtesting on my
part.  When reading these first three sections keep in mind
that they are initial recommendations, and what follows may
well be different (and is in several cases).

B. For rolling characteristics, note that no characteristic
may be below 1 (reroll rolls of 0).

C. Social standing - ignore this part.  After discussions
with other members, I feel that the randomness of Noble
selection should be eliminated.  The Noble career will
remain.  For further information see that section of this
Update.

D. Homeworlds - ignore this part.  Since the characters are
with an adventuring band, they had to have gotten to space
somehow.  I am inclined to let the characters choose the
background skills that they wish to, but they should be able
to justify their selection to the referee.

E. Background skills - delete the portion of background
skills based on homeworld.  If players have a designated
homeworld for their character, they can chose skills
appropriate to that setting.

F. The rebellion - throw out this part.  Since the setting
for TNE is going to be much farther in the future, most
characters will not have even been born when the rebellion
ends.  If you want to keep this part for use until TNE
arrives, that is your option.  By the way, has anyone got any
ideas on how to bring an existing campaign into the TNE age.
Cold sleep and characters\' (grand)children are two that I can
think of.

G. The draft table - if you disregard the rebellion, there is
no need for this table.  Since there is no roll for career
entry (either a character meets the prerequisites or does not
meet them), there is no basis for a draft for those who fail
to enter a career.  I think in the kinder, gentler New Era
there will not be a draft.

H. Declaration of rebellion - see "F" above.

I. Page 9 - Civilian Careers - the following careers were
deleted in GEnie transmission and should be added to the
bottom of the list:

SALVAGE OPERATOR, SCIENTIST, SECURITY GUARD, and TECHNICIAN

The appropriate careers are described in the Guide, but were
simply left of the list on this page.

J. Page 14+ - delete all homeworld requirements for ENTRY.
If a homeworld requirement is all there is, write "No
prerequisites." in its place.  Referees and players are
advised to use common sense for some of the careers, i.e. if
the character has a designated HIGH STELLAR home world, that
character should not be a barbarian.

K. Page 16 - Drifter - add Tracking 1 to the first term
skills IAW PC BOOSTER KIT.

L. Page 20 - Prisoner - add to special - After PC\'s have
served a term as a prisoner, they may chose their next career
normally, but must succeed at an Average roll versus Charisma
to be accepted by that career.  If they fail, they must
instead choose a criminal career or one with no
prerequisites.  This continues every subsequent term until
they make a successful Charisma roll.  After that they may
choose normally.  (Paraphrased from PC BOOSTER KIT.)

M. PSIONIC INSTITUE - I have made this a four year term.
This does not mean that four years have been spent in study.
Rather the time has been spent looking for an institute,
attending the institute, and improving skills.

N. All careers - delete any mention of draft under SPECIAL.

O. Specialties - the PC BOOSTER KIT has a method for small
arm and melee weapon specialties.  I feel this is the way GDW
will treat the subject in TNE.

P. Page 32 - Mustering out - the PC BOOSTER KIT has a method
for dealing with social classes and mustering out benefits.
I am still studying this and thinking how it could apply to
TNE.  Stay tuned.

Q. I almost forgot to update the Noble career.

   NOBLE

ENTRY: Must obtain permission from the referee to play a
Noble.

SPECIAL: (add) Once the noble career has been chosen, the
character cannot change to any other career (Obligations of a
Noble) unless that character wishes to be an outcast Noble in
which case NONE of the benefits of being a Noble apply (i.e.
monies, contacts, yacht, TAS, etc.)  If the character selects
the Noble career immediately after Education term(s) then the
character is a HEREDITARY NOBLE.  If the character pursues
any other civilian career before selecting Noble, then it is
an AWARDED NOBILITY.  For characters who have a military
career before selecting Noble, discuss with the referee
whether it is HEREDITARY or AWARDED.  A brief military career
might infer a Hereditary Noble Obligation.  A long military
career may result in Nobility being Awarded.  There are no
promotions in the Noble career.  The referee will determine
what rank the Noble is, but an Awarded Nobility should not be
higher than a Baron, and is usually a Knighthood.

R. The notes on page 33 are some mid point thoughts, the
final results of the skill decisions are what are listed on
the skill list and character sheet (which should be the
same).

S. Part V - GDW will be using a 1D20 task system for TNE.
However it will be based on stats and skills from 1 - 20.  If
you can borrow a copy of the PC BOOSTER KIT, it details that
system for use with DC.  I feel the system for TNE will be
almost identical.

NOTE: I know I have been pushing the PC BOOSTER KIT a lot in
 this document.  I feel it is a worthwhile investment for
 referees who are trying to convert their campaigns to the
 TWILIGHT system before the advent of TNE.  I think that in
 the ROGUE ET we are getting a sneak preview of how GDW will
 handle ALIEN races.

T. Part VI - Weapons and Armor - Most of the recoils are off.
When I was uploading this, I did a quick reconversion from
what I had converted to MEGATRAVELLER strengths for use in
the TIMES.  Also, the last listed helmet (essentially a
"cloth" helmet) should be TL 7.  If you have it available,
use the small arms from T2K2 or INFANTRY WEAPONS OF THE WORLD
or, to a lesser extent, DC.  For higher TL weapons, my
suggestion is to estimate based on the recoil listing in MT
and comparing with other weapons with a similar recoil.

U. Character Generation Worksheet - Ignore items 3, 4, and 6
if you adapt all of the suggestions in this update.

Well, that\'s it for now.  I hope this has been helpful, and
after I get some feedback from this, I may issue Update Part
II.

Yours for Traveller,

Geo.

Review
 
MegaTraveller II:  Quest for the Ancients
by Paragon Software
Main Scenario written by Marc Miller
 
 
This review is organized into these parts:
Outline of MegaTraveller II
Things that would make a better MegaTraveller game
Hints for playing MegaTraveller II
 
 
Outline of MegaTraveller II
- ----
Main Scenario:  An Ancient Site on the planet Rhylanor in the Rhylanor
Subsector has been activated and is spilling pink goop over the planet.
Scientists estimate the entire planet will be covered in five years.
A substantial reward is being offered to the parties that come up with a
way to stop the flow of the slime, and your party takes up the challenge.
 
        MegaTraveller II has a character creation system built in that is
fully compatible with the MegaTraveller RPG.  It allows for the printing
of characters, as well.  No advanced careers are supported.  The system
is slightly improved over MegaTraveller I\'s.  It allows for the 
creation of Vargr characters as well.
 
        Graphics are excellent and sound cards are fully supported.
 
        I feel that combat has been improved slightly from what MT1
offered.  MT1\'s combat system had the npc\'s in the party waiting to be
shot at until you could get to them and tell them to attack, run, 
change weapons, reload if necessary, etc.  (note, MT versions 3.0 and up
had a different combat system because many people complained about this
one.  I am not familiar with it.)  MT2\'s combat system has the npc\'s in
the party react on their own, but there is very little you do to control
it.  Basically, if the characters are fired upon, all of them will
switch to a weapon and move in towards the offending party.  You can
select whether or not you want a character to attack, but have no
control over characters that do attack.  The combat system should have
more tactical aspects to it.  It\'s no fun just to watch the npc\'s do all
the work.
 
        Trading is horrible, no improvement over MT1.  You go to a
starport and look at the lists of what is available.  Prices are
non-negotiable.  Despite what the manual says, the skill Trading has
nothing to do with it.  Out of curiosity I put my Trader skill at 100
and checked buying and selling prices.  They were the same as they were
at Trader 3.
 
        Space Flight and Combat are very bad as well.  Definately a drop
down from MT1\'s system of flying using newton\'s laws of inertia and
acceleration, which I didn\'t like, but is much better than MT2\'s.  In
MT2 you select your destination at starport from a list of planets
within jump range.  Then you get a cute little graphic of a ship
jumping, then you are there.  From your destination you can either
land, jump again, or refuel at a gas giant.  To refuel you select the
\'refuel\' bar and you get another cute graphic, this time of a close up
of a gas giant and a guzzling sound.
 
        Space Combat happens purely at random, as do interactions with
other starfarers.  They suddenly appear on your screen give you a stupid
little message (like if they are pirates, they will say "Arrh, I am the
meanest pirate in the galaxy, prepare to hand over your goodies!", and
if they are friendly, they will say "Just passing through friend", or
something similar.).  Your only option with these people is Combat or
Converse.  If you select Converse, and they have something to say, they
will give you about 5 lines of text and you will never hear from them
again.  If you select Combat, your ship automatically starts firing at
the other ship, and you just sit back and watch.  If you beat the 
other ship, you have the option to pirate it, which means you just 
take whatever is in it\'s cargo holds.
 
        The cities all have generic layouts.  This I can understand, I
guess, since they wanted to save space, but hey, Ultima 7 is 21
megabytes, why does MT2 have to be limited to 2.6?  There are a lot of
buildings, much more than in MT1.  The important ones are recognizable,
because they will be color coded or something, depending on the three
representative tech levels of the inhabitants, High, Medium, and Low.
You can leave the cities and explore the planet surface, but this is
hardly a worthy thing to do considering the time it takes to move around
the surface of a planet.  Grav Vehicles and ATV\'s can be rented to speed
the process if you have to, however.
 
        There are 117 planets in the game, comprising 4 subsectors of
space.  They are accurately represented, and the manual that comes with
the game gives a good background to the planets, explaining the UWP and
listing them for each planet.
 
        NPC interaction needs to be improved.  You recognize NPC\'s by
the fact that they are green, and everyone else is grey.  Talking to
NPC\'s is slightly difficult, in that you need to first hail them to get
them to stop, then walk up to them and face them, select the face icon,
and finally the talk option.  You are rewarded with a small text message
with no further way to communicate with the person, except maybe to
answer a "yes/no" question from him/her.  NPC\'s invariably have silly
names, like Scowl Trowl, Don the Winch, Big Rolf, Mark Spearmynt, Steve
LaTryne, Bingo the Black Marketer,  Marilyn Monrope, and Johnny Walker.
Sometimes these names take away from the adventure, in that it\'s hard to
take Bingo seriously because all you know about him are his name, face
and silly message.
 
        Skill use is not implemented very well either.  The only place
you can ever see a skill at work is in combat, and this sucks.  Skills
should actually do what they are supposed to and be useful to the game.
Also, sometimes you encounter situations where an npc will put you in a
situation where, if you have a certain skill, usually something obscure
like electronics, he will give you a hint.  Otherwise you are bummed.
This is stupid and I had to restart the game with new characters many
times after finding out that a certain skill will be helpful.  Also,
character training through the game does not seem to work.  What you
have in the begining is what you are stuck with for the rest of the
game.
 
        There are many entertaining subplots you can complete, but they
require careful record taking to keep track of who wants what, which
police agencies are looking for the outlaw you just toasted, etc.
 
        The game must have looked great on paper, what with the numerous
planets and npc\'s and subplots the players can come across, but somehow
it fails in its delivery.  It has great beginning and ending
animations, good main scenario and subplots, but the parser, while
similar to the one in the ultima series, falls flat and makes the game
an endless series of tedium.  You go to a planet, talk to all of the
green dudes, write down what they say if it\'s important, fly to the next
planet courtesy of the poor starflight system, and repeat.
 
 
Things that could be done to improve MegaTraveller II
- ----
 
        The game should follow the rpg religiously, especially in
matters of trading and spaceflight which can be handled so well by a
computer.  Skill usage should especially follow this rule, even though I
can\'t even imagine how to pull this off.  It may just have to be
compatible with just some skills, and with each new version new skills
can be included.
 
        First off, a good, fun, and realistic starflight system is
needed, and it has to have total integration with the space combat
system.  Ship boardings would be cool (see Heavy Nova for an 
example of this).  Sensors, ship computers, a process that you have 
to go through to perform a jump, and a way to see exactly how much 
damage your ship is taking and what the enemies condition is should 
be included as well.  Hull points or a similar system would be nice, 
but a graph would work as well (I would prefer actual numbers).
 
        The personal combat system needs improvement.  It should have
been more of a tactical exercise than just watching all of your
characters fight.
 
        NPC interaction should be better too.  I recommend one similar
to what was found in Ultima V.
 
        Same with cities.  Cities should be built like they are in
Ultima V, with no \'dead buildings\' like you would find in MT2.  I am
choosing Ultima V over Ultima VI or VII because they are adequate to the
task and the CAT people aren\'t super programmers who are going to get
megabucks for their product.  Cities should be an icon that you enter 
from the rest of the world and expands once you enter it.  MT2 does 
this now, but the city layouts should be done like they are in Ultima V, 
not the generic layout junk that MT2 currently uses.  Who cares if the 
game is big?  Or rather, playability should not be sacrificed to 
save space.
 
        Something that I think should very much be included in a
MegaTraveller type game is open ended space exploration, or something
similar.  It is fun to simply plan new jumps, jump to a planet, map and
explore it, and continue doing this with other planets, expanding the
size of the universe known to the game.  There should be a base galaxy 
or sector, and the boundaries should be determined via exploration 
on the part of players.  The planets and stars along these border zones 
should be generated randomly, utilizing the World Builder\'s handbook or 
something similar, and existing code can be utilized.
 
        As I mentioned earlier, skill use needs to be improved.  Other
than graphics, this will probably be the hardest part of the game for
our CAT friends to write.  Perhaps only some skills should be 
utilized at first, with more implemented in later versions?
 
        Vehicle/Starship design import or creation should be a part of
the game.  Actually, it would be nice if all of those little utilities
we have floating around courtesy of the CAT people could be incorporated
into the game.
 
This is to the CAT members mostly.  Graphics are not important.
Animation is not needed at all.  As long as the players can tell what is
going on, it will be fun.  I think a complete text/ascii interface (ie
Zork or Hack) would fail, and some simple graphics are needed, but they
don\'t have to be very good, just recognizable *representations* of
things.  Like what appears in the early Ultimas.  The problem with any
graphics at all is that they would limit the game to just one platform,
but I think that they are necessary.
 
(Hey CAT people, I know you want to write a game like 
MegaTraveller, but what I would like to see is sort of a MUD where 
the referee and players are all connected and can type to one 
another, with popup character sheets and built in dice roller etc.  
Maybe it could act as a sort of \'shell\' for the rest of the utility 
programs out there.  It would be sort of a ref\'s helper type 
program, and have the capability to send private messages among the 
players and ref.  What do you think, is it possible?  Of course I 
don\'t know where it would be run. . . )
 
        Lastly, the gaming parser should be fun to play in, even if
you\'re not working at plot completion.  What I mean by this is in the
pen and paper rpg, it is fun to do things like explore and find new
trade routes and try to gain money through investments and business
ventures.  A game that does this is StarFlight.  StarFlight is very
similar to Megatraveller II.  In both you have to save the planet by
exploring other planets and interacting with NPC\'s.  When my 
friends and I first started playing it we thought it was impossible to
complete the main scenario, and took the destruction of Arth for granted.
Instead of starting over (as I would have done without hesitation in MT2)
we set out to find a new source of Endurium to fuel our ships to explore
the rest of the galaxy (Sort of like Road Warrior:  they were always
looking for gasoline to drive their cars so they could fight each other
over gasoline...).  It was never boring, because each planet we
approached could be Old Arth, a source of fuel or have a rare
element that we needed to repair our engines, and there were over 
800 planets.  Eventually we did complete the plot, but it was not nearly 
as much fun as just exploring.  There was also a sense of danger playing 
StarFlight.  We had these measly little ships that G\'Nunk warriors could 
kill by looking at, so it made us very cautious and we avoided G\'Nunk 
space for as long as possible.  Not once did I feel threatened while 
playing MegaTraveller 2.  Whenever there was combat it was a simple matter 
to back out of it or to avoid it altogether.  
 
        StarFlight had poor graphics.  MegaTraveller has great graphics.  
StarFlight is a hundred times better than MegaTraveller.  The parser is 
what makes the game fun, not snazzy graphics and sound card support.  Not 
even a plot by Marc Miller, the original designer of Traveller, could save 
MegaTraveller II:  The Quest for the Ancients.

- ----
 
You may not want to read this if you are a purist and enjoy this 
game a whole bunch, but I imagine most of you who have this game 
have it sitting on a shelf yet to be completed.
 
These hints are not going to ruin the game for you, they will just 
make it easier.  They are not things like "to win the game, go to 
Aramis".
 
Possible Spoilers ahead.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When you first create a character, make sure you get a starship.  
Classes that give starships as a bonus are:
 
For Humans,
Aristocrats, Belters, Hunters, Nobles, Pirates, Scientists, Scouts.
For Vargr,
Aristocrats, Belters, Corsairs, Explorers, Hunters, Leaders, 
Loners, Merchants, Rogues.
 
Get some characters with money as well, or get more than one 
character with a starship and sell the other one.  Classes with 
money are fairly easy to recognize, ie Doctors, Aristocrats, Navy, 
etc.
 
Make sure you have a Human Navy and Human Scout character.  Vargr 
won\'t cut it.  You need these two to get onto some planets without 
hassle.
 
Train all of your characters in energy weapons, and train one of 
them with a high stealth so that he can smuggle all of your weapons 
onto the planet.  Or edit your characters to give all of them a 
good stealth so you don\'t have to give one guy all of your weapons 
each time you land on a planet, then distribute the weapons out 
again. . .  I don\'t think this is cheating, just avoiding tedium.
 
The key skills in this game from what I can tell are Stealth, to 
smuggle in guns, Interrogation, to interrogate bad guys 
(necessary), ATV and Grav Vehicle, for planetary navigation in a 
reasonable amount of time, Energy weapon, to fire FGMP\'s and 
PGMP\'s, and Bribery.  The others, even Piloting, Turret weapons, 
and Medical did not get much use.  Trust me on this one, I know it 
sounds arbitrary in a space game.  
 
You may want to use Norton Utilities or some other hex editor and 
give your characters like a 4 in every skill in the game.  This may 
seem like cheating, but it\'s not, because you are going to come 
across parts of the game that require you to have a certain obscure 
skill, and if you don\'t have it you are screwed.  This isn\'t hard 
to do.  Look at your numbers for your characters, write them down, 
go into Norton, convert these numbers to hex, and search for their 
hex equivalents in the save game file.  Then change that hex number 
to the hex number for 4 or 100 or whatever you want your skill level 
to be.  Norton comes with a hex to dec converter so this is no 
problem.  (You can change a whole lot like this btw, so always always 
keep backups of your saved games when you do this.)  Write me if you 
need help with this.
 
There is a Jump 4 ship that doesn\'t have to be refueled orbiting 
the gas giant in the Ylaven system.  It\'s quite good in combat too 
apparently.  It is a little tricky to get to.  You need fuel cores 
from the Ancient Site on Patinir to pilot it.
 
Unless you are pressed for cash, don\'t go running back to Rhylanor 
each time you find an Ancient artifact.  The artifact won\'t affect 
the slime (unless it is *the* artifact, and you\'ll know when you 
have it) and you may not have enough time to complete the game.
 
There is nothing to the \'joining the other side\' part of the game.  
Basically you just do some assasinations and get paid for them.  
Not a whole involved plot or anything.
 
Well, that\'s as far as I\'m going to go with hints in this file, so if 
you want more explicit ones, write me and I\'ll give em to you.

Greg Givler asked about where I got the rate of fire for the Virginia and
the Monitor designs I put up.  Well, I got the figures from a book on the
battle of Hampton Roads, I forget the title and the author.  As for why the
figures are so low for the Virginia, I really  do not know, but that is what
the book claimed was the average rate of fire.  The only explanation I can
imagine is that the Virginia maneuvered like a dead whale wearing cement
overshoes.

She required 30 to 40 minutes to make a 360 degree turn.  As the guns had
a strictly limited field of fire it may be that it took five minutes to
reload and bring the guns to bear.

Reloading on the Monitor however was a rather complex task.  The length of
the guns barely fit inside the diameter of the turret.  In order to swab
out the gun, reload it and ram it, the rods had to be run out of the gun
ports while the crews were still inside the turret.  This would be done
while the turret was facing away from the enemy.

     The Interrogator sat perfectly still, "The subject is
recovering rapidly from the interrogation.  He came very close to
not reviving, though he has a remarkable capacity to regenerate
himself."
     "How long before we can continue?"
     She considered it, "Uncertain, at minimum:  five hours."

     "The subject has proved exceedingly strong.  If

     ...The blackness of the bog was tinged with pale violet
iridescence as Mako felt his way along through the darkness.
Branches reached out overhead as the trees raked the sky with
their leafless bony limbs.  A moon peered down:  a red eye with a
black pupil studying the silent wilderness.
     Fog rolled about like a hungry creature draining the warmth
of it\'s victims.
     Mako froze as a lone howl sounded far off behind him.  He
glanced around.  He could see only a few meters as the fog roiled
about like an eplieptic ameboa seeking a warm body.  A second howl
sounded from the opposite direction.
     Malenkoviepr ran perpendicular to the line described by the
two howling things.  A few steps and his left foot sunk into the
mire, calf deep.  He stumbled, but rolled out onto the surface
grasping the gnarled roots of a nearby tree.
     Carefully, he pulled himself up to stand on the roots when
they resolved into bony fingers clawing into the bog.  The bark
of the tree seemed to have faces inside it:  tortured faces with
mouths agape in silent screams.
     Mako began to slog through the bog when a third howl
sounded:  still far off, but closing.
     He sank lower, the bog up to his knees now, but still
manageable as the murk flowed around him.
     A ghostly white shape hung from the ghastly trees.  It swung
silently he watched it.
     Slowly, the fog separated, revealing the shape had wings.
     Hloch hung curled in a ball, wrapped in a spider\'s web.  He
was cocooned by something.  It was difficult to make out the Ael
Yael\'s silhouette, the left wing\'s humerus and wrist were bent at
ugly angles, while the right appeared dislocated.
     With fear rising in his throat, Mako stared at the thing
before him swinging slowly in the bone chilling air of the bog.
     Slowly, it moved and looked at him.  "...Help me..."
     Mako jumped into action pulling the cocoon out of the giant
web with enormous strength.  Quickly, he began ripping apart the
venemous gossamer coffin.
     "...Thought you were dead..." managed the wounded scientist.
"That thing that swatted me..."
     "Viepchaklva, if I understand it, but this is a dream."
answered Malenkoviepr as he cleaned away the entangling web from
the creature\'s arms and legs.
     "...A dream...  a Nightmare...  Some one\'s been questioning
me...  Then the nightmares come..."
     "You\'ve been questioned?  What about?"
     "...Imperial defenses...  research...  the ancients...  I
couldn\'t help but tell them...  Truth drugs...  sensory
deprivation..."
     "Who interrogated you?"
     "Don\'t know... never saw them..."
     "Somebody is very curious about you and me..."
     "Did they interrogate you too?"
     "Yes."
     "What about?"
     "The ancients mostly.  A lot of questions."  Slowly, the bog
faded around them, and they were alone in blackness.
     The Ael looked at him, "What do they want to know?  Maybe we
can figure out what they\'re up to."
     "Identification of certain artifacts, information about the
theories behind them."
     "What kind of artifacts?" asked Hloch in a strange voice.
     "Ancient... ...Well, I\'m not really sure..."
     Hloch\'s voice grew strange:  less shrill and more husky,
"You saw them, didn\'t you?"
     A Siren went off in Malenkoviepr\'s head, "Well, yes..."
     "Then, what were they?"
     "Hloch, are you all right?  You sound very strange..."
     "What do you mean strange...?" he asked defensively, his
voice different now... almost human.
     "Who ARE you?!" growled Malenkoviepr.
     The creature was taken aback, "I am Dr. Hloch of the planet
Ael Yael."
     "Oh, indeed?  I thought your planet was Jaeyelya."
     The creature stared at him blankly.
     "Tell me," continued Malenkoviepr, "you\'re a physicist, what
is the equation of mass-energy equivalence?"
     The creature hesitated, "...E equals MC squared."
     "What do the terms mean?"
     The creature stared, desperately groping for an answer.
"What are you driving at?"
     "What is the definition of kinetic energy?  That\'s an easier
question."
     "Now see here, you\'ve got to help me..." cried the creature.
     "I did not think you could answer it."  Malenkoviepr scowled, 
"You are not who you pretend to be." he turned to walk away.
     "Wait!  Come back!  I can explain!"  The thing hung suspended
by threads as a grotesque marionette jerking mechanically to the
commands of someone unseen, while screaming in a human voice.

     Mako stood in the center of a raucous party holding a glass
of champagne.  Sophonts of all kinds laughed hysterically and did
very bizarre things while loud, insane music rippled forth.
     Three Vargr females in tie-dyed purple paisley mini-skirts
were Zero-G-Go-Go dancing in large cages.  Their eyes threw out a
bizarre kaleidoscope of colors.
     Seven humans were running in random directions carrying fire
extinguishers and blasting each other with them amid peals of
laughter.
     A large male Vargr was pulling oranges one by one, from thin
air, out of his left ear juggling them and tossing them to a
group of Droyne who were passing them from one to another and
building a towering pyramid with them.
     A pretty, young Aslan female in a feathered mask walked
through the room carrying a small wheel and kissing everyone.
     A huge obese woman was standing on a table, balancing on one
leg and crying rhinestones, while a man in an indescribable hat
asked her insane riddles.
     Hloch was standing on Kittan\'s shoulders.  Kittan was going
through a book, tearing out pages and handing them up to Hloch.
Hloch in turn handed folded them into small paper airplanes and
threw them to a young but very large male Aslan wearing a Darrian
Naval uniform.  The young Aslan ensign wore the circled eye
insignia of the Darrian Naval Intelligence corps.
     "Ah, Hloch, through hanging by someone\'s thread?" asked
Malenkoviepr.
     "Humans make lousy puppeteers!" laughed Kittan delightedly.
     "Yes, I haven\'t been myself lately but I\'m alright now!"
leered Hloch as he swayed precariously on Kittan\'s shoulders.  "I
can only reach for who I have been, since not me."
     A squadron of colorful crystalline insects flew overhead in
diamond formation.  They executed a tight roll and changed into a
deck of cards.
     "This party is pretty mindblowing!  Eh, Mako?" chirped
Hloch.  "Out of sight!"
     "Out of mind!" cried Malenkoviepr.  "This is a dreamy
party!"
     "Who ever\'s in charge of reality seems to have the day
off..." called the Aslan officer, refilling Mako\'s glass with
champagne.
     "Yes," agreed Mako, "I\'m in charge at the moment."
     The pretty Aslan female in the mask attached herself to the
ensign\'s arm, and turned to Mako, "Excuse me, have you seen a man
named Duran Durant?" she asked softly.
     "Achrrr!" cried Kittan in surprise. "Dr. Malenkoviepr, I
should introduce you."  She gestured the Aslan officer, "This is
Ensign Zdeldi of the Darrian Confederation, and his companion:
Surrealni."
     "Enchanted!" grinned Surrealni, then she slowly began do
disappear, from the tip of her tail up to her face, until only
her grin was left behind.
     "Pleased to meet you." smiled Zdeldi extending his hand
above his head in a very non Aslan way.  "And, what do you do?"
     Malenkoviepr gave him a high five, "Nearly the same as you
do, but I\'ve resigned."
     "Oh really?  Why?"
     Mako smiled, and drew forth an holocrystal from his breast
pocket and put it back.  "I had my reasons...  some plans..."
     Zdeldi drew him aside, "Like to share your reasons?"
     "Share?" he asked incredulously.
     "In a manner of speaking.  There are other things to be
shared in such arrangements."
     "I am intrigued.  Shall we go?"

     The Interrogator looked up, "I thought you wanted to
question him about the ancient artifacts we possess."
     "I do.  But if we let this proceed, we can find out how
corruptible he is...  THAT we can use..."

     The gambling table was clear as Malenkoviepr and Zdeldi
faced each other.  Mako dealt five cards each.  Zdeldi considered
them carefully and handed back two.  Zdeldi spoke in a strange
voice, "Dr. Malenkoviepr, just what sort of deal were you
planning on?"
     Mako shuffled and handed him back his cards.  "No set plan
just yet.  I am merely interested in finding out what You have to
offer."
     The Aslan regarded his cards, "Selling to the highest
bidder?"
     Mako picked up his cards and studied them a moment and
exchanged one from the deck, "Now, now, you are putting words in
my mouth..."
     "Or thoughts in your head..." smiled Zdeldi, "Go fish."
     Mako eyed his cards and pulled three from the deck, "Yes,
just possibly, but then again, it might be the other way around."
He placed a card face down on the table announcing, "King\'s X."
     Zdeldi\'s eyebrows went up in a most human surprise, he
examined his cards and drew one from the deck.  "Well, what about
putting credit in your pocket...  Hit me."
     Mako took a card from the deck without looking, "Would you
mind being more specific?"
     Zdeldi\'s voice was quite human, "I want that crystal.  I\'ll
pay for it...  I\'ll stay."
     Mako dropped a card on the table, "What\'s so valuable about
this holocrystal?"
     Zdeldi took the bait, "I want anything you have to sell.
Therefore, I want that crystal."
     Mako put all his cards down except for one.  "Uno."
     Zdeldi rearranged his cards quickly and discarded three,
"The Consulate can\'t offer you what we can...  Box cars"
     "You want me to sell out the Consulate."
     "Has the Consulate treated you so well?" asked Zdeldi, "Not
from the looks of things."
     "Perhaps, but they are MY people."  Mako looked up at the
ceiling and threw his legs up on the table.  "So, when did *YOU*
sell out the Consulate?"
     Zdeldi froze.
     The entire dream world stopped mid sentence.
     Silence.
     Malenkoviepr glared through the ceiling to the outside
universe.  He addressed the crazy world and its makers.  "You
sold out the Consulate, didn\'t you?  What did they offer you?
What do you expect?  Did you get it?"
     "Or is someone holding your leash as we speak?"  He glared
at the prop of a world around him, and slammed his last card, the
twenty one of clubs down on the table.
     "This round," he announced, "I win."

> Yeah, well, there\'s a lot of brain time invested in the old rules for a

    In general I was getting the impression that the TML in general didn\'t
seem to understand that GDW was definitely using the T2K rules (i.e.
that it wasn\'t a debatable point).
    Though I had thought this point should have been cleared up long ago.

    Agreed in general. But than I believe in Freedom of Speech, presumeably
others do, so therefore I don\'t see any reason to edit out the vitriolic
material (now if I were uploading it to the GEnie topic areas, I might
do some editing on any four letter stuff and such, but that\'s another
matter, teens and such).
    And of course calling each other names doesn\'t do much good either
(in point of fact GDW has taken the name calling rather lightly compared
to what some other companies would do).
    If things got to serious I would probbly do some editing though.

    Well, offhand I haven\'t exactly seen all the inhibiting effect yet
(but than of course not everything is posted to everybody). Though
it\'s interesting (recalling a much earlier discussion about whether
GDW had any inhibiting effect on conversation on GEnie).
    As for whether the discussions on GEnie are pale and insipid is another
matter. The Traveller topic area is probably more of an area for HIWG
to meet and talk than GDW or DGP (though I don\'t think this had been the
original intent, it just happened that way) and HIWG being what it is,
most discussions don\'t occur on GEnie (the $6+ per hour, lack of access by
most members, etc... being an inhibiting factor), and a large part that
occurs happens via Email (being loads cheaper, the T2K<->Traveller
conversion being one such).
    Most of the TML stuff seems wasted disk space to me, but there is the
occasional nugget to be found.

    Yeah, I had sent a note to GDW just after recieving that message that
maybe they should give you guys a pointer as to what they wanted
(although I probably could do it for them).

    Basically my suggestions would be the following, and you can post
it to the TML in general (for that matter the entire letter could be,
but than that\'s not exactly what you want):

...........
    Taking for fact that GDW is going to be using the T2K system in general
as the basic rules. The background is generally going to be lower tech
and small kingdoms are the way to go.
    Admitted it would be easier to criticize actual material, but....
    What areas need to be fixed?

    One set of problems has been some of the science behind Traveller,
to be specific, Power Plant outputs/fuel use for Fission were off,
Fusion Drives were off, and some didn\'t like the thruster drives (well,
we could always use Robert Forwards new drives).
    [One thing to keep in mind here, is that GDW is an RPG company,
    not a scientific research organization. And DGP was just a
    parttime RPG company at that. Granted, they might have done
    slightly better, but than Traveller is also a mass of widespread
    information that needed to be rewritten.]

    Another set of problems was the combat system, from personal to
starship.

    The third was vehicle/starship design. Basically the idea seems to
be something easier while still retaining the variety and detail of
the existing system.  (and we mustn\'t forget to install those airlocks
in starships.....)

    The fourth was system generation (and what Hard Times does to certain
worlds, like those low tech, high pop, vacuum worlds. Although if you
asked me, I\'d try to figure out how such worlds would make sense first
before throwing them out, after all this is SF, no sense having every 
world behaving and looking like Earth right? Of course, making sense
also helps).

    The fifth was starport generation and capabilities (a favorite
topic of many, and seemingly the hardest thing to adequately describe).

    And I\'m sure there are others that come to mind....

    Offhand I\'d say the first was the most important (and it would be best
if 2 out of 3 people could agree on that part).
...........

> As far as complaints go, if you look back through the material from the first
> pass last fall, you\'ll find a good bit of material that they should read, once
> the flames have been extracted.

    I\'m currently missing said info....though hopefully that will be
corrected in the next couple of weeks.

   In conclusion, it would be nice if GDW passed out certain sections
of the material so that it can be picked apart. But I\'m not sure it\'s
their style (I\'ve seen only three companies actually pass the info
to any large extent, FASA with parts of the Shadowrun material,
DGP experimenting with AI, and than Star Fleet Battles. And some
Traveller writers with their material.).

    'body' => '  A curious aspect of RPG\'s is that even though the mechanics for resolving
attempts to use (non-combat) skills are (hopefully) used more than the combat 
mechanics, the majority of the discussion erupts over the combat mechanics,
and this posting is no exception:) 

  But I\'ll try to use the combat mechanics and the way they relate to the
rest of the skill systems in MegaT and T2k2 to analyse how their skill systems
work, and if they are (the dread word) realistic.

  \'Realistic\' is a very misused and undefined word in RPGs. Some people
mistake gore or high character lethality for realism, in which case Rolemaster
or Call of Cthulhu would be the most realistic systems repectively. Some people
mistake complexity for realism and they probably think that Aftermath or
Rolemaster are the most realistic systems. What I mean by realism is that the
system should *seem* to work similarly to reality in the most basic respects:
Higher skills make it easier to succeed and things like that.

  MegaTraveller has, as opposed to many other games, a relatively integrated
skill and combat system. Combat and non-combat skill resolution both use 
difficulties, skill means the same and stats are used in the same way.

  The above paragraph also holds true for T2k2, so at the first glance their
skill systems appear similar, but there is a big difference in how they work:
MegaT use difficulty levels that one has to reach with the dice, modified by
skills, stats and special circumstances. T2k2 on the other hand use the skill
directly, halved or doubled according to the degree of difficulty.

  This leads to that no skill in MegaT is much superior to skill zero (or even
skill one in the d20 system) in T2k2, since you will still have a chance with
a low difficulty skill in MegaT while in T2k2 zero is zero no matter how many
times you double it.

  With the default skills and the automatic success in the d20 system, this 
has been partly rectified, but it is still not perfect, especially with the 
combat system: A strength stat of 10 will give you a 10% chance of hitting
a man-sized target at short range (About 55m for assault rifles, 30m for SMGs
and 12m for pistols. Personally I wasn\'t sure if this was resonable or not, so 
I had to consult an expert: My dad, who has spent a significant part of his 
life teaching people to shoot everything from 7.62 to 105.
 
  His answer was that even if we account for firing range vs real combat 
(military studies of tank crews say that a person will shoot three times better
on the range than in combat, make that four times for infantry out in the 
uncomfortable environment, so if you hit with 10% of the shots at 100m at the
range, you will hit with 10% at 25m in combat) it sounds way too low. The 
number he mentioned for an average green enlisted with a weapon that have had
its sights adjusted right and absolutely no weapons experience was more like
50% from prone and 25% from standing.

  Modifying the skill system to account for this by doubling the default skill
values isn\'t good either, since it would make the lower skill values worthless.

  I have two suggestions to solve these problems:

  The small modification: Let everybody have skill 2 (4) in all weapons
(small arms rifle and pistol, heavy weapons, archery, unarmed and armed melee)
if somebody have briefly told them how they work ("That\'s the safety and that
is the trigger"). If they put skill points on these skills during character
generation or put experience points on them during a campaign they will 
add to this \'default level\' of 2 (4).

  The big modification: Use the default skill value as a level of skill that
can be increased as above. In the d20 system this would mean that a character
with Strenght 10 would have skill 2 all the strenght related skills and
if he gets small arms rifle 1 during character generation he would have
skill 3 in small arms rifle. (Each skill step in the d20 system is equal to
5%, naturally)

  This is a modification, I agree, but IMHO it isn\'t bigger than the 
change from the d10 system to the d20 system, and it will only be noticed 
during character generation which means that it will be even less disruptive
than the change to the d20 system.

        Can someone who has experience with both systems please 
write a comparison between Star Frontiers (augmented by Zebulon\'s 
Guide and Knight Hawks) and Traveller/MegaTraveller and its 
constituent supplements?  The reason I ask is I have been holding 
off purchasing Traveller/MegaTraveller because of the rumoured 
MegaTraveller:  The New Era, and Star Frontiers, despite all the 
bashing I hear bandied around about it, is great.  The resolution 
system that appears in Zebulon\'s guide is excellent, and I love the 
skill system.  But, not having experience with 
Traveller/MegaTraveller, I don\'t know how well this system holds up 
in comparison.
 
        Should I hold off, as I have been doing, on the purchase of 
MegaTraveller any longer?  And I can get those black Traveller 
books for a very cheap price, around five bucks a piece, are they 
good investments as well?  Not from a collector\'s point of view, 
rather as source material/stuff that is not outdated by 
MegaTraveller.
 
        If someone wants to talk about Star Frontiers I\'d be happy 
to.  I think I have everything ever published for it (and was 
bummed when they decided not to publish Zebulon\'s Volume II which 
would have covered bionics, power armor and robotics)

Stealing Donuts, part 4 of 4

_or_  Gertie\'s Revenge

<in part 3 of 4, minutes earlier, MC tried one last but botched attempt
 at Gertie\'s donuts, followed by Sean\'s successful attempt using TK>

	Sean laughed a good long time; and Gertie merely looked at
him, one eyebrow raised in calculation.  Everytime Sean started to
calm down, all he had to do was look at Gertie looking at him, and he
would start up again.
	Over at the corner table, MC was telling Thilia in a low voice
what had happened.  The racoonid had caught a case of the giggles,
which isn\'t at all surprising since racoonids tend to think human
behavior is one of the funniest things going.

	(Ever seen a racoonid "laugh"?  They usually fall over and
	 roll up in a ball, make very high frequency chitters and
	 squeaks, and rub their noses frenetically. It looks very odd.)

	Gertie looked around her, took one last bite of donut, and
walked over to MC\'s table.
	"Correct me if I\'m mistaken, MC, but what was one of the usual
spot punishments for grunts in the military - push-ups, wasn\'t it?"
Gertie had an calculating grin on her face.
	"That, Gertie, is a rhetorical question if I ever heard one,
and I myself try never to get trapped into leading questions,
especially when my mission commander is grinning at me like a vargr
toghk (whore) in heat..."
	I thought Thilia was going to fall off her seat at MC\'s term
of phrase, but Thilia has lead a very sheltered life, being blind,
wealthy, and noble.  Also, Thilia had never met anyone quite as blunt
as MC before - another artifact of her previously sheltered life.
Being rescued by our ship has been, I think, the most adventure she
has ever had.
	Gertie, hoever, didn\'t even blink at MC\'s reply.  In fact, the
sinister aspect of the grin deepened, if anything.
	"Yep, push-ups...yeah, that\'s the ticket.  Hope you\'re in
shape, Commodore."
	What MC said next can\'t be repeated in polite company.
Meanwhile, Gertie had paged the entire crew to assemble in the hold.
- ----
	A half hour later, Gertie explained to the entire crew (all 23
of us) that enough was enough.  In addition, as a small object object
lesson, anyone involved in stealing her donuts (except Hyl) would now
drop and do push-ups.  While this was normal for the marines, she
explained, she included the Commodore, Rocky, and Sean also - their
behavior as senior members of the crew had set a very poor standard
for everyone else, especially where her donuts were concerned.
	"Yeah, how come Hyl gets off the hook?" MC asked, leaning
against a bulkhead, looking more and more disgusted with each passing
moment.
	"Hyl gave me the honorable opportunity to defend my donuts,
and I failed to do so - unlike the rest of you who went ahead and
stole my breakfast out from under my nose with no notice whatsoever!
As for those members of the crew NOT yet implicated in the purloining
of my pastries, let this be a warning for you: leave me donuts alone!
	Just to show you that I would never order anyone to do
something I was unwilling to do myself, I will join you.  Last, we
will all attempt to do as many push-ups as the Commodore.  When the
Commodore tires out, we can all stop, unless she tires us all out
first.  After all, as MC is so fond of telling me, seniors officers
_are_ expected to set an example for the crew."
	"Hot Damn!  We\'ll be done in no time!" said Grig, a marine
with a big mouth and a small brain.  Grig missed the dirty looks from
the sargeant and colonel; the look MC gave him grabbed all his
attention.  She didn\'t say anything; she just looked at him as if
contemplating dirty dishes in a sink, and rolled up her sleeves.  She
never blinked, and his mirth turned faded to apprehension.
	Never turning her attention from Grig, she pulled off her
boots and tucked her braid down the back of her undress overalls.
Last, she took her knighthood piece out of its holster, and after
Grig\'s eyes had widened, she turned to Haakim, the senior navigator,
and asked him to hold it for her.
	MC tossed one last withering look at Gertie, dropped to the
floor, and started push-ups at a moderate pace.  Morris, the marine
sargeant, growled at eveyone else, and in seconds, the hold was filled
with half the crew doing push-ups.  A few other crew members joined in
for the hell of it, including Thilia, the blind lady.  Me?  I\'m just
an old fart - I watched and mentally inventoried the ship\'s supply of
analgesics.
	Nightshade (well, that\'s what she _says_ her name is) ran off
to get a camera.  Hyl got bored and left.  Anton was taking bets.
Rocky, not being one to take anything like punitive push-ups
seriously, was hanging from a ceiling panel by his claws, doing
upside-down push-ups (pull-ups?).
	Most of the marines burned-out early.  Morris, their sargeant,
lasted the longest and quit only after he had passed 1000 push-ups.
Sean, the master chief, had quit long before that.  Rocky quit after
the novelty wore off.  The last contenders still on the floor were
Thilia, Gertie, and MC.  Thilia quit not long after Morris.  Gertie
however kept right on going, keeping pace with MC.
	Finally, Gertie\'s breath started to run ragged, and she slowed
down.  Soon, she collasped on the floor.  Sean helped her to her feet.
And then we all stood around, frozen, staring at the Commodore still
doing push-ups at a steady and unfaltering pace.  Her eyes were shut,
and her teeth were clenched, her expression one of well-contained
pain.  The marines were humilated, ever last one of them; Svenwas, the
colonel, was ready to spit rivets, he was so mad.  Grig tried to fade
into the bulkheads, but Morris and Svenwas kept staring him down.
	Gertie broke the tableau.  She knelt next to MC, and said
quietly: "MC, you can stop now. Please, before you end up in sickbay."
MC ended a push-up, rolled over, and popped up to her feet.  No one
missed the lines of pain around her eyes.
	"Excuse me," she said very quietly, as she stepped into her
flight boots, and retrieved her piece, "I want a shower."  As she
walked out, Svenwas and Morris saluted, and the rest of the marines
followed suit immediately.
 ----
	MC walked stiffly into the mess the next morning, and joined
Gertie at her table.  She winced as she sat down.
	"You did that on purpose, Gertie," MC said quietly without
accusation.
	"Seen the doc yet, MC?" Gertie asked, just as quietly.
	"Oh yeah."
	"Donut?"
	MC gave Gertie a look.  When she done with her look, she said:
"better take me off the duty roster for a few days, Gertie.  I don\'t
think I could pilot right now if we popped out of jump."
	"That sore, eh?  I\'m surprised.  I thought the artificial arms
would do all the work."
	"Yeah, they did do most of the work, but much of the muscle in
my back is real, and my back and shoulders are killing me."
	"You could have quit earlier, you know." Gertie pointed out
gently.
	"Sorry, Gertie, but between you and that marine twit, I had to
the last to quit."  It was Gertie\'s turn to give MC a look.  MC
replied by taking a donut.  
- ----

EPILOGUE
	A day later, Nightshade approached MC and Thilia in the mess,
and handed MC a 2-D print.
	"I suppose, young lady," MC raised an eyebrow, "that this is
already all over the ship?"
	"Yep!" Nightshade smiled.
	"I see."  MC gave the 2-D her close scrutiny, and handed it
back to Nightshade, and suppressed a laugh.  "For the record, young
lady, I have never ever seen this, nor heard of its existence.  Is
that clear?"
	"Yes Sir!"
	"What did Nightshade show you, MC?" Thilia asked when
Nightshade had walked away.
	"A 2-D photo-print she took during the push-ups, of Gertie\'s
ample posterior.  In addition, she touched up the print so that a
standardized shipping label of \'wide load\' appears prominently across
one cheek."
	"How inappropriate," Thilia said haughtily.
	"Yes," the Commodore replied with vast dignity.
	And then they busted up laughing.
- ----

FYI: the current world\'s record for push-ups is over 8000 push-ups.

Gertie, being the strongest human on the ship (Str 12), could probably
do 2000 push-ups.  Thilia is a psi - she used her self-awareness to
stretch her ability to do as many push-ups as she did.  Morris is
almost as strong as Gertie, and as the marine sargeant, there was no
way he was going to wash out early.  MC is a cyborg, though only a few
people on the crew know this.  Most of the narrative is told from the
point of view of the ship\'s doctor, an "old fart" named Pete.

This ends "Stealing Donuts - or 101 Thing to do in Jump."  Feedback on
whether folks would like to see more story snippets out of my
traveller group (sent in small pieces, on holidays and weekends when
volume is low) would be appreciated.  Please send me email direct if
you have comments, to cat@fgssu1.fgs.slb.com Thanks.

Psionics

	The following is an introduction to the psionics system that
I have developed over the last four years, to fill out the original
Traveller (and MegaTraveller) psionics system which though easy to
use, wasn\'t complex enough to account for many realistic situations.
This though was probably due to an attempt at game balance, as the
existing rules worked under the premise that EVERYONE could have
access to psionic powers if they find someone to train them.  Therefore
it cost an incredible portion of your psionic strength to do anything,
psionic combat was also almost useless as it took almost all of your
psi to throw a mental blast at someone.

	The system that I have developed has been taylored to give
realism and playability.  It encompasses a wide range of psionic
abilities.  The basic system details psionics determination, psi
talents and general use of psionic abilities.

	The system is further expanded by the following options which
may be used at the GM\'s discrescion, making it a dynamic freeform
system ;-

	- BREAKING OUT, different ways in which psionic operancy
	may be achieved;

	- MENTAL COMBAT, using the full range of psi-powers in combat
	situations;

	- GESTALT, the mighty energy channelled when two or more
	minds are linked together;

	- PSI DRUGS, biochemical psionic enhancement;

	- ANIMAL PSI, the occurance of psi in plants and animals;

Bryan,
     Please post the following to the TML, if you haven\'t received it already.

 R. Dired, A reply to you will also serve as a general message to some on
 the TML. Here goes:

 < I simply cannot agree...with some of the most basic decisions you
 are making.

 I understand that, and I don\'t count that against you. I used to get
 PO\'ed when people disagreed with me, or didn\'t take my advice, but
 I don\'t anymore (life\'s too short). I respect your opinions, but I
 expect others to respect ours in return. GDW will stay in business
 or not depending upon decisions that I and others here make. If
 it was only my paycheck I was risking, I\'d be inclined to make
 different decisions, but other paychecks than my own depend on what
 course we take. We choose to do (or not do ) what we think will
 please the majority of our consumer base. We have to, or we won\'t
 stay in business. The fact that I am writing this letter on GDW\'s
 19th anniversary indicates to me that we make more good decisions
 than bad ones. I don\'t claim we always make good decisions...and I
 certainly don\'t claim that the ones we make please everybody
 (that\'s impossible).

 < Wouldn\'t a TNE/DJ be not only cheaper, but be an easy way to
 < expand the market of both? I\'m not kidding about this.
 A combined Traveller: New Era/Dangerous Journeys is not possible. The
 reasons are too complicated to explain here, and some of them are
 proprietary anyway.

 < ...bad rules are not discarded. Was a single rule thrown out from
 Trav to MTrav?

 I don\'t know. The Traveller to MegaTraveller conversion was not
 well thought-out, and was badly handled both in-house and out.
 I was not and am not involved in any aspect of MegaTraveller or
 the shift from original Traveller to MegaT. No one connected with the
 T---->MT project is involved with the TNE project.

 As for bad rules not being discarded, an example to the contrary from
 Twilight: 2000 (1st): "1 game shot = 3 actual bullets" Even though we
 stated this in the rules, a large number of customers consistently
 failed to grasp the concept. The single most commonly asked
 question about the rules was "Why are all the firearm magazine
 capacitiies one-third what they are supposed to be?" This
 was obviously a rule that wasn\'t working (a "bad" rule, in my book),
 and we dropped it when we revised the game.

 In Twilight: 2000 (2nd), we did not give characters enough skills to
 suit many of our customers. We are in the process of correcting
 this (revisions will appear in the $4.50 Twilight: Ref\'s Screen).

 We made a number of realism vs playability trade-offs in Twilight,
 both in the first and second versions. One of these tradeoffs was
 to increase character survivability. In a game where firefights
 are common, characters die quickly and often if the lethality
 of the weapons is not carefully considered. Our early playtest
 sessions with a deadlier system convinced us that people REALLY
 don\'t like spending a lot of time generating a character only
 to have him/her killed in the first gunfight.

 < You are quick to dismiss any negative comments as attacks, and
 < then ignore them.

 How do you suggest that I react to a statement that implies that
 Twilight: 2000 has "autofire rules where being blind isn\'t any
 hindrance"? The word "blind" does not occur in the rules in the
 context you mean. I assume you are taking issue with the rules
 that separate fully automatic fire from semiautomatic fire, and
 which do not require firearms skill for "rock and roll"? Why
 don\'t you say: "I don\'t like the fact that autofire doesn\'t
 require firearms skill." Many of our customers did, and we will
 be changing the rules because of it.

 Frankly, I feel that pointing an M16 (or whatever) in the general
 direction of your target and holding the trigger down (which is
 what autofire means in the game) does not take much (if any)
 skill, and I know a couple of combat vetarans that agree with me.
 However, I have been convinced that some allowance for skill
 needs to be made, and I will be incorporating a rule change into
 the Twilight: Ref\'s Screen. Characters without firearms skill can
 still pick up an SMG and spray away, but people who know what end
 of the weapon the bullets come out of will be able to bring a
 little more control to their autofire.

 < No one I know will play any GDW games without heavy prodding -  < usually 
rule problems.

 And have any of these people bothered to tell us what these rule
 problems are? Are they really problems (like the ludricrous fission
 fuel requirements in Mega?), are they "I wouldn\'t have done it
 that way..." rules, like using D10s instead of D100, or are
 they misinterpretations (willful or otherwise) of the rules.
 < I and others could, if we thought we weren\'t wasting time, add heap
 helpful ideas

 We\'d love to see them. Just don\'t get PO\'ed if we decide not to use them.
 Just because we don\'t take advice doesn\'t mean we ignored or dismissed it.
 It doesn\'t even mean that it is wrong. It just means that we decided to
 do something different, for whatever reason. (One of the three laws of
 the universe I\'d like to get repealed is "Alternatives Exclude.")

neutrinos passing into this area will interact easily with other

will jump to a great number of interactions.

Of course, the amount of energy involved is HIDEOUS. There are other
details: neutrinos will COOL this area, as their energy is much less.
That means a high-neutrino burst will cool your detector below threshold

Well, yes, this might work, but to my mind the basic problem is that if 
I (as a warmongering weapons designer, of course) had a way to heat 
something to 300 million times the core temperature of the sun, I\'m 
afraid the first thought to pop to mind wouldn\'t be, "OH BOY, now I can 
DETECT NEUTRINOS!"  :-)

     DOWN THE WELLES
          or
     Deep in a hole

     Scott Kellogg
          - I -
          Welles E655632-3
     Twelve System Defence Boats and an unidentified forty
thousand ton ship of the line bore in on the tiny gathering of
starships.
     The Flamboyant\'s radio crackled:  a woman\'s voice, "This is
Lt. Dragoon of the League of Suns Navy aboard the scout ship
Spindleman.  For the duration of this emergency I am proclaiming
martial law and assuming command of all vessels by the authority
of the League of Suns.  All vessels will report their status or
be judged hostile."
     Jietlshaiepr almost choked, "This is Lieutenant Jietlshaiepr
aboard the Gunned Escort Flamboyant out of the Zhodani Consulate. 
Lieutenant, you\'re out of your sphere of influence.  This is a
free and independent system."
     Lt. Dragoon snarled, "Welles has requested the League\'s
protection, and THAT makes it our sphere, Zho."
     A Droyne chirped in, "This the trader Shoolist is,
maneuverable, jump fuel have lost.  Re-enter atmosphere
impossible streamlining destroyed."
     "This trader Kivas, power plant damaged.  Computer
destroyed.  Wounded aboard.  Drone dead.  Rendezvous Flamboyant
with waiting."
     "Cruiser Chekbas here, hull by nuclear blast irradiated,
maneuver drives damaged, down to two point one G, two laser
batteries out of action, loss of some jump fuel.  Cutter
undamaged and deployed."
     Jietlshaiepr sighed in disgust as the Droyne surrendered the
authority of their vessels.  "This is the gunned escort
Flamboyant.  We are undamaged and are proceeding to rendezvous
with the Kivas.  Under our control is a VIXEN class missile
platform.  We have three light fighters deployed."
     The radio gave mute testimony to the fact that no other
would answer the call to friendly shipping.
     A note of hesitancy came into Lt. Dragoon\'s voice, "Droyne
Cruiser Cheekbass... you will rendezvous with the trader Shoe
list and remove all crew then make for jump point...  You should
just be able to make it.  On second thought, head for jump point
now.  Have your cutter take the crew off and rendezvous at jump
point you will jump for the Price system and contact the League
there.  Inform them to send reinforcements.
     "Droyne trader Shoe List, you will prepare to scuttle your
ship.  Head for jump point to shorten transfer time.
     "Droyne Trader Key Vast, prepare to scuttle.
     "Zho Escort Flamboyant, take off the crew of the Key Vast. 
Direct your missile platform and fighters to engage the enemy."
     The radio burst with tiny objecting voices as two Droyne
merchant captains heard the orders to scuttle.
     Kfoks audibly restrained himself over the radio, "Dragoon,
No disrespect intended... are you out of your Mind?  Do you Really
think *Three* *LIGHT* Fighters can take on *TWELVE* Vrrsheerrrsh
*SDBS*, and *DO* Something!?  *Other* than be Wiped out?"
     "Flamboyant squadron," answered Dragoon nastily, "Why don\'t
you pull some sneaking, underhanded Zho trick on them?"
     "My compliments on your bigotry, asshole, but I\'m Vargr."
snapped Kfoks.  "Flamboyant, On mark, I\'m switching frequencies
to preset B.  Mark!  Let\'s get the hell out of here.  We\'ll
rendezvous with you at the Kivas.  We\'ll pick up survivors and
jump the hell out of here."
     Niedrsha looked over the course projections.  "Forget
jumping, we\'ll never have time to pick \'em up and make jump
point.  They are coming in from outside the gravity well.  We\'d
have to run right through them to get to jump distances.  We could
hide on the surface.  We\'d loose the VIXEN if we did jump:  it\'s
out of fuel."
     "She could make an in system jump." chimed Miakr.
     "To where?" asked Niedrsha.
     "The system gas giant."
     "Program it in, but don\'t execute it." ordered Jietlshaiepr,
"We may need it\'s cover."
     "Coming up on the Kivas!" shouted Niedrsha.  The once sleek
needle like trader hove into visual range.  The hull was opened
up like a can just aft of the bridge.  The engine room was
visible through a rent in her stern just forward of the control
surfaces.
     Jietlshaiepr grabbed her surgeon\'s kit.  "I\'m going to
teleport aboard.  Dock with the ship and be ready to receive
casualties..."
     Suddenly, Shtam came onto the bridge lugging a tool kit, "I
have a plan:  no time to explain.  Jietlshaiepr, take me across
with you."
     Jietlshaiepr looked startled for a moment.  "All right, it
had better be good.  Button up your battle dress.  I\'m going to
take us outside the rent in the bridge, and then inside."
     "I am going to the engine room.  Leave me outside."
          - II -
     The bridge disappeared as the two winked over to the
stricken trader.  The Kivas leaped towards them as they matched
vectors with their grav belts.
     "What on Zhdant are you up to?" wondered Jietlshaiepr.
     Shtam smiled, "Just a sneaking, underhanded Zho trick I
heard of once:  preparing the power plant to overload.  The
pirates will take this ship aboard.  If I am quick, I can give
them a fusion bomb in the bargain."  He jetted around to the
engine room.
     Jietlshaiepr crawled in through the hole in the ships
plating.  Twisted wreckage showed a nearly vaporized computer
room.
     Shtam\'s disembodied voice came to her in the darkness, "You
will have to set up some explosives.  Perhaps Gresha if you can
not.  We have to make it appear as though we tried to scuttle the
ship but the attempt failed in the rush:  wire up some of the
ship\'s missiles with a bad detonator.  Once they\'ve found one
surprise and defused it, it should satisfy them enough to take
this ship on the capital ship."
     The computer was half molten.  A small Droyne shadow lay
across the panels where it hadn\'t become glowing slag.  The
operator\'s body had shielded the computer for a tiny instant.  An
intact iris valve stood nearby going forward.
     "I found an injured one back here." called Shtam.  "Their
engineer I assume, unconscious.  It\'s in pressurized combat
armor."
     Jietlshaiepr called back, " We don\'t have time for full
treatment now.  Make sure it\'s not going to get banged around and
have Vole take him back to the Flamboyant when we\'re docked. 
We\'ll have to treat them there."
     Jietlshaiepr teleported through the iris valve, and onto the
bridge.  Suddenly, there was a huge metal beam at eye level,
millimeters away from her helmet.  "One more teleport like that
and I\'m history."
     The bridge was a burning shamble.  The beam had fallen from
the ceiling along with other structural pieces causing the air to
hiss slowly into the vacuum.  The panels were ablaze filling the
room with black smoke.  Blue alien emergency lights lit the
bridge dimly through the smoke, but the sensors of the battle
dress saw clearly.  Two Droyne in combat armor were fighting the
blaze at the other end of the beam where it had pinned a third to
its acceleration couch.  The draft from the air leak was drawing
the smoke away from the fire keeping it alight.  It wouldn\'t be
long till the air was too thin to burn.  Why not dump the
atmosphere to put it out?
     The two barely noticed as she floated forward.  The pinned
Droyne\'s armor was cracked.  She tried the strength enhancement
of her battle dress to move the beam.
     It was set tight.
     "Flamboyant," radioed Jietlshaiepr, "We\'re going to need one
of the tillys on the bridge:  I need a heavy lifting crane.  Get
Rackan into the suit and get him over here."
     One Droyne managed in slurred Zhodani, "You sick make well?"
     "Yes, I am a surgeon." she replied quickly, "I have a team
coming with heavy equipment.  But we have to get it in here from
outside, we\'ll have to seal his suit."
     The two Droyne glanced back with indeciperably alien
expressions nearly completely hidden by armor.  "Chrr, what say
you?"
     In answer Jietlshaiepr bent to make a closer examination of
the trapped Droyne.  The beam rested across the chest and right
shoulder of the creature.  The shoulder was dented and cracked
but the chest armor hand held up under the impact and had kept
the mass from crushing the chest.  The armored wing casing was
bent at an odd angle.  A quick glance at the two uninjured Droyne\'s
wings showed the wing must be broken inside the casing, but the
armor appeared to be sealed.  For now it would serve as a temporary
cast but it would be crazy when it came time to take it off.
     Jietlshaiepr quickly began sealing the cracked plates of the
creature\'s armored suit.  The fire was fading: the air was
getting dangerously thin and poisonous.
     A minute later Jietlshaiepr was half finished with the
sealant when Niedrsha sounded on the radio, "Kivas, this is
Flamboyant, we are now positioned next to your air lock.  Lock to
lock docking appears impossible, your linkup system appears to be
shot away.  We are now ready for evacuation of casualties. 
Rackan estimates he will be with you in ten minutes."
     Jietlshaiepr transmitted, "Flamboyant, I want Gresha outside
with a fusion gun, some explosives and detonators.  First burn a
hole into the bridge big enough for the tilly.  Next take the
detonators and wire up the Kivas\'s missile magazines.  Vole, you
bring across casualties.  There is one unconscious in the engine
room.  Kaezorr, you know about micro-gravity, you go with Vole. 
Let\'s move, people!"
     Moments later she finished sealing the little Droyne\'s armor
and stood up.  The fire was out:  nothing left to burn.  Could
the trapped creature still breathe?  No way to tell if it was
even alive inside the dead combat armor.
     Turning to the other Droyne, she spoke in Zhodani, "Get to
the Flamboyant, the equipment..."
     "Galanglic speak please." interrupted the Droyne.
     She translated, "Get to the Flamboyant, the equipment will
be here in a few minutes.  I can\'t do any thing more until we get
you crew aboard the Flamboyant."
     "Leave my Kivas." said the captain quietly.
     A chirping sounded on her radio.  The Zhodani speaking
Droyne stood up.  "Teleport others to aid must I."  The creature
vanished immediately.
     The captain floated to the communicator on a side panel and
chirped into it.  Two colored hexagonal pie charts lit up:  three
slices of the first were out and two of the second.  In a moment
the lit slices became the video projections from the helmets of
the surviving Droyne crew.
     The captain chirped sadly into it\'s comm set.  The others
answered slowly.
     Two of the cameras flashed brilliantly as someone began
blasting away wreckage with a plasma gun.
     "Viepchakl," thought Jietlshaiepr, "they\'re well armed for a
merchant crew.
     She moved aft to the iris valve.  With the bridge in vacuum
there\'s no need to keep it closed.
     As it opened she saw Gresha with a fusion gun.
     "We need a pretty big hole to get the tilly in here.  Start
blasting around the iris valve.  Give me the detonators, I\'ll set
the magazine."
     "Right, Jiet.  You\'d better get on the radio, Dragoon\'s
breathing plasma since the fighters started back."
     "Blast!  I haven\'t time to deal with that idiot!  Niedrsha,
do you read me?  Patch me into the ship\'s radio."  She moved aft
around the ship\'s hull as Gresha started blasting a hole in the
bulkhead.
     Lt. Dragoon\'s voice seemed hoarse as it came over the
circuit, "...boyant come in.  Damn you bastards!"
     "Spindleman, this is Jietlshaiepr of the Flamboyant we are
conducting vital rescue operations.  Do not jam this channel."
     "Flamboyant, you will redirect your fighters to engage the
enemy."
     "*Request* denied."
     "Flamboyant, do you know what ship that is?!  It\'s the
raider Star Rider.  If it gets away it\'ll kill hundreds!  Maybe
thousands!"
     "Dragoon, that ship is a ship of the line, it has a screen
of twelve ships that are individually more than a match for my
ship.  The combined firepower of all our ships couldn\'t even
scratch their defenses."
     "God damn it, Flamboyant!  If that ship gets loose there\'ll
be more victims than ALL our ships.  It must be stopped!"
     "Viepchakl!  You fool!  Don\'t you see WE CAN\'T STOP IT!"
     "Ok, coward Zho punks!  We\'ll stop it ourselves!  Spindleman
out!"
     Miakr interrupted, "Jiet, they\'re on an intercept course."
     Jietlshaiepr shook her head, "Not for long, they\'re dead."
     In the engine room, she found Shtam working feverishly on
the drives.
     "How\'s it going?"
     Shtam didn\'t look up.  "I have the power plant operational,
I do not dare turn it on:  they would pick up the power and might
suspect the trick.  It will take a few more minutes to rig the
containment vessel for overload.  Then we can super-compress the
plasma and bang!"
     "We have twelve minutes before we have to leave.  Can you be
ready?"
     "I will be ready.  Is the magazine set?"
     "I\'m on my way."  She opened the hatch that lead forward to
the turrets.  A tube lead up toward the turrets.
     Kaezorr was floating down leading Drert and two Droyne who
pulled a large Droyne figure in armor.  One of the Droyne was
carrying a PGDP-12.  "We had to dig something out of the
wreckage.  They said it\'s alive." she explained.
     Jietlshaiepr lowered her shield and probed the recumbent
creature:  no life.  In fact, there was nothing there.
     Confused, she put her psionic shield back up.  The Droyne
reappeared.  Psi invisibility?
     "Take them back to the ship.  I\'ll examine it there."
     She went up the tube to the turrets.  They weren\'t far
forward.  Quickly, she rigged the missile igniters together and
wired up the detonators.  Just fire up one missile and the whole
magazine would go.
     "...Nine, Eleven, Twelve missiles going up simultaneously...
that ought to look like a pretty good self destruct..."
     She set the detonator timer to zero and put the battery in
backwards.  An obvious mistake, it\'ll look like the timer went
down and didn\'t fire the missiles.
     "I only hope they buy it."
          - III -
     It took all of Jietlshaiepr, Gresha, Shtam, Kaezorr and Vole
to maneuver Rackan in the tilly to the bridge of the Kivas.  The
metal tyrannosaur tore the bars away like paper as it entered the
wrecked bridge.
     "All right, Rackan," cautioned Vole, "The armor may bend
back when we remove the beam so do it slowly.  It\'ll mess up the
sealant."
     Rackan growled, "I don\'t take order\'s from robots..."
     Jietlshaiepr cut him off.  "No, but you\'ll take them from
*me*.  Lift slow and easy like you\'re handling eggs.  I have to
reseal any leaks that open in the armor."
     Rackan locked the huge arms of the tilly onto the beam.
"Ready."
     "One millimeter at a time." She cautioned, "Go."
     The arms began to strain at the beam not moving it.
     "Vole, help him."
     Vole moved in and locked his own robotic arms on the beam. 
"I\'m going to use my laser welder," he warned.  "It should help
bend the beam which is what we\'re going to have to do."
     The laser lanced out and began heating the beam.  A moment
later, Rackan focused the tilly\'s laser welder on the beam.
     Slowly, slowly, slowly the beam began to bend.
     A foggy mist began spraying from the Droyne\'s shoulder. 
Jietlshaiepr put a patch on the leak, but another came open worse
than the first.
     A second patch went on and the spray stopped.  "Ok,
carefully now..." she cautioned.
     Again they lifted.  The beam had moved about a centimeter
more when a trickle started from the Droyne\'s back.
     "Blast!  I can\'t reach it!  He\'s on top of it!  Keep going!"
     The leak changed from a trickle to a jet, still she could
not reach it.
     "All right!  Lift!  For all you\'re worth!"
     The beam came up faster, but still slowly.  Jietlshaiepr
threw her mind into her arms and lifted.  The strength enhancers
complained along with Vole\'s and the tilly\'s arms.
     Sweat dripped off her face as she watched the torrential
leak helplessly.  Other leaks began seeping from the shoulder.
     Suddenly, under the heat and strain, the superdense structural
beam buckled.
     Jietlshaiepr grabbed the suit patches.  One slammed over the
hole in the back plate slowed it.  A second closed it over.
     The leaks on the shoulder took three more patches.
     "Ok, get him back to the Flamboyant so we can get the fuck
out of here!" sighed Jietlshaiepr with relief.
          - IV -
     They jetted back slowly to the Flamboyant pushing Rackan in
the tilly.  The cargo lock beckoned invitingly.
     "Get moving team," warned Niedrsha from the bridge, "The
SDBs are closing.  Range: one point five million kilometers.  Our
escape margin\'s gone.  If we start running now they\'ll still get
us in range before we make the surface."
     They floated slowly toward the open hatch.  The massive bulk
of the modified cargo carrier-battle suit was hugely difficult to
maneuver.  It floated through the airlock and bashed silently
into the wall of the hold.
     Shtam punched the door control.  The lock door slid quickly
in place.  Gravity came up slowly but too quickly for Rackan in
the clumsy suit.  He collapsed onto the floor.
     Jietlshaiepr hit the pressure controls, "Full throttle,
Niedrsha, get us the fuck out of here!"
          - V -
     Jietlshaiepr counted heads.  Out of twelve passengers and
crew, two dead, four wounded, three of them badly.  She stripped
their armor off as she listened to Niedrsha\'s tactical report over
the intercom.
     "Four SDBs have peeled off after the Chekbas and Shoolist. 
They\'ll both reach jump point before they can intercept.  Chekbas
will reach jump point in seventeen minutes, the Shoolist in
thirty two.
     "The Shoolist\'s captain is out of his head!  They\'re gonna
try and jump outsystem with no fuel!  They\'re gonna misjump
deliberately!
     "One of the SDBs is closing on the Kivas.  Two more are
after the Spindleman.  The Star Rider is slower than the SDBs, it
also is closing on the Kivas.  It will intercept the Kivas in
about five hours.  Niedrsha cleared his throat, "That leaves five
SDBs after us and the VIXEN.  They will be in firing range in one
hour, fifty three minutes, thirty two minutes before we reach the
surface.
     "Spindleman will be in their range in forty five minutes."
     Miakr came over the intercom, "Jietlshaiepr, what should I
do with the VIXEN?  It can\'t follow us into the atmosphere..."
     "Send it after our tail.  It just might buy us some time. 
And it just might live if it makes one pass and keeps going."
     "Right Jiet...  It\'s on it\'s way.  Interception... thirty
six minutes... twenty seconds."
     The pilot Droyne was small.  Maybe a few centimeters shorter
than Dr. Malenkoviepr.  No wonder Mako had a rapport with such
tiny creatures.  Two of the four ribs were broken on the right
side along with what passed for the collar bone.  The right wing
was a ragged mess where hollow bone had made a compound fracture.
     Vole and Tuerz worked on a large patient with a broken leg. 
Suddenly, Drert leaned over the pilot.  He held the same blue
crystal from the Ancient site.  The point of the crystal flared
up like a star.
     Jietlshaiepr turned her head from the bright flare.  Her
hands trembled as she held the wing of the tiny creature. 
Freezing heat flowed into her fingertips.  She tried to let go
but her muscles were locked tight.
     Every hair on her hands began to stand on end.  The
sensation swept up her arm.  The hair of her head prickled as
though it had become thorns.
     Suddenly, everything changed.  The sensation swamped her
body like a wave of honey.  A low moan passed her lips as her
every nerve was kissed, stroked, fondled, wrapped in a fur
blanket and put by a warm fire.

     A minute later she found herself barely standing with Vole
peering into her face.
     "What happened?" she sang dreamily.
     "I don\'t know." the robot said confusedly. "I was preparing
to set the Droyne\'s leg when my limbs jammed:  my neural activity
sensor went off the scale.  Then you started moaning and Tuerz
howled.  He collapsed but you were still standing."
     "Too much for him I guess... Where\'s Drert?"
     The gunner was over in the corner surrounded by the Droyne
who were not stirring.  The examining tables were empty, instead
the tiny creatures were clinging to Drert like young opossums to
their mother.
     Jietlshaiepr picked out the one who had been half crushed. 
No sign of any injury, or that any had taken place.  It seemed
to be sleeping quite contentedly.
     "Tuerz!" Kfoks burst into sick bay.  "Are you all right? 
What happened?"
     The slender Vargr looked up dreamily.  "Vargr!  Taek, you
should have been here.  I haven\'t felt that good in..."
     "What happened?" Kfoks demanded.

MEGATRAVELLER DESIGN CONSTRUCTION REVIEW PART 2
DESIGN EVALUATION

Maximum Speed:
In MegaTraveller, the thrust/weight ratio and it\'s correspondance
to maximum speed is way off.  Below is a list of aircraft and their
maximum speed listed aside their thrust/weight ratio.
(all speeds below are in kilometers per hour)

6G                                  4200
(the SR-71\'s thrust to weight ratio is 0.3824.  Max speed is
unknown but around 3100kph)

In the light of the above, grav vehicles and starships max speed
should be vastly higher than they are.  Any 1G merchant ship should
be about Mach 2+, and any grav vehicle/ship with an excess thrust
of 3G would be about as fast as the X-15.  (Mach 6+!)

I therefore suggest the following table for evaluation of thrust vs
maximum speed.  For Grav vehicles and spacecraft, unstreamlined
hulls would be treated as Simple airframes, streamlined would be
treated as transonic and airframe hulls would be treated as
hypersonic.
     These limits apply only to craft while within an atmosphere.

As this table will greatly increase the speed of aircraft, the
thrust tables of the available aircraft engines will have to be
reduced to suit it.  This will have the effect of keeping the
aircraft within reasonable limits in terms of speed.  However, it
will have the effect of requiring large or multiple engines for
VTOL aircraft.  This is consistant with reality however.  VTOL
aircraft are VERY complex and COACC does not aedequately reflect
this.

VTOL Aircraft must suffer some thrust penalties due to the nozzles
necessitated by their VTOL design.  As all VTOL aircraft must have
a thrust to weight ratio greater than one, one would expect from
the table above that all VTOL aircraft would be extemely fast.  As
this is not the case, forward thrust for the aircraft must be
divided by 4.  Thus, the Harrier with it\'s Thrust/Wt of 1.227 would
have a modified thrust in forward flight of .307 and would (with
her transsonic airframe have a top speed of 1060kph.  This penalty
could be overcome by the use of dedicated lift engines.  This type
VTOL aircraft would have at least 2 engines.  One to get her off
the ground (with a thrust to weight ratio of 1+) and one to propel
the aircraft in forward flight.

(Note:  I\'m not really happy about the subsonic and simple airframe
data up there.  The data I\'ve been looking at has no thrust data for
me to use to compute it from, it\'s all in horsepower.  I will probably
change things around later.)

(Also note:  The above tables require a major rewriting of the COACC
engines.  The thrust must be reduced substantially from that given in
COACC.   This will be addressed later)

The only forces that have any effect on Neutrinos are gravity, and the
weak bonding force inside the nucleus of an atom.  Perhaps the neutrino
sensor has a gravitic lensing mechanism to capture more neutrinos.  Further,
with the advent of nuclear dampers (which effect the strong nuclear binding
force)  Maybe there is some other field similar which effects the weak force

Thus you would be able to gather a larger number of neutrinos into a confined
area for your (weak nuclear damper) field to detect them.

Psionics

	The following is an introduction to the psionics system that
I have developed over the last four years, to fill out the original
Traveller (and MegaTraveller) psionics system which though easy to
use, wasn\'t complex enough to account for many realistic situations.
This though was probably due to an attempt at game balance, as the
existing rules worked under the premise that EVERYONE could have
access to psionic powers if they find someone to train them.  Therefore
it cost an incredible portion of your psionic strength to do anything,
psionic combat was also almost useless as it took almost all of your
psi to throw a mental blast at someone.

	The system that I have developed has been taylored to give
realism and playability.  It encompasses a wide range of psionic
abilities.  The basic system details psionics determination, psi
talents and general use of psionic abilities.

	The system is further expanded by the following options which
may be used at the GM\'s discrescion, making it a dynamic freeform
system ;-

	- BREAKING OUT, different ways in which psionic operancy
	may be achieved;

	- MENTAL COMBAT, using the full range of psi-powers in combat
	situations;

	- GESTALT, the mighty energy channelled when two or more
	minds are linked together;

	- PSI DRUGS, biochemical psionic enhancement;

	- ANIMAL PSI, the occurance of psi in plants and animals;

	- \'MAGIC\', the psionic rationale for the mystic art;

	- PSIONIC MATRICES, imprinting of psionic energy patterns in
	to objects;

	- \'GODS\', deitistic beings and god-like abilities;

	- PSIONIC ABILITY MUTATIONS, quirks and oddities for psi-talents;

	- glossary of psionic terminology;

	- PSIONIC DEVICES, the technologised side of psi;

	- recommended reading list for further inspiration.

	All parts of the system are fully documented with examples.

	The game mechanics of this system are my own ideas and thus are
subject to copyright.

	Submission of the actual rules will be to GDW, and if they are
not accepted as the author\'s guidelines state, then they will be released
to the public domain via TML nightly.

	I agree.  I did some calculations, based on aging of the Strength
stat.  Assuming there is a 2d6 bell curve in Strength (1/36 of the population 
has a 2 Strength, 6/36 has a 7, etc.) and applying the aging rules, the 
average life expectancy in the Traveller universe is 76 years.  This excludes
people who gain Strength during character generation, people who die of
violence, and people who die of another stat reaching zero first.  Thus 
the actual value is probably lower.  According to the World Almanac for 1991 
the life expectancy in the USA is 72 for males, 79 for females.  
Additionally, the same life expectancy holds regardless of tech level in
Traveller. 
	So I came up with this quick fix:  If the average level of 
medical care a character is getting is tech level Pre-Industrial, 
use a DM of -2 on all aging rolls.  This gives an average life expectancy 
of 64.8 years.  See following table for other values

Tech Level			DM 	average life expectancy
0-3	Pre-Industrial		-2	 64.8
4-5	Industrial		-1	 69.7
6-8	Pre-Stellar		 0	 76.6
9-A	Early Stellar		+1	 89.7
B-D	Average Stellar		+2	110.5
E-	High Stellar		+3	(not figured)

	This gives average life expectancies more in line with what I 
would expect of varying tech levels.  The reason ther is no age figure
for High Stellar is that I originally used different categories, and 
just now decided to bring them in line with the categories used in 
MegaTraveller.  Most PCs will not have an average medical care of
higher than D, probably.  
	How does one figure average Medical care?  Well, it\'s a GM 
call, really.  During character creation, if one serves a 4 year term
on a Tl-13 starship, in a navy based on a Tl-13 world, it\'s easy to
decide.  I\'d set The Imperial forces at about Tl-13, as I seem to
remember that being the average the navy was equipped to.  I one 
spends the entire 4 year term on one planet, the answer is again
easy, but such things as wealth should be taken into account.

	This is a really good idea.  I\'ve also considered forced mustering
out to be a problem, and this looks like a good solution to me.

Do you mean 0.3824 or 3.824??  The number cited is rather at odds 
with the table above it.

   Since the limitations of present-day nozzle design are an engineering
limitation, and not a Law-of-Physics limitation, I would suggest 
calibrating the VTOL thrust divisor by tech level.  Otherwise, you
are assuming that there will never be improvements in vectored thrust
design that will improve thrust efficiency vis-a-vis non-vectored thrust
engines.  You don\'t want to repeat the story of Traveller computers and
have players looking at your tables 15 years from now and saying "That\'s
bogus!  TL 12 Traveller aircraft are wimpier than the stuff the Navy\'s
using now!"  (Which is what we are all saying about the current COACC
tables.... I\'m delighted to see your revised tables.)

I think the game designer\'s philosophy behind the \'forced mustering out\'
was to generate player characters; not the run-of-the-mill, everyday
Imperial citizens.  For some characters, it helps me to visualize their
\'mustering out\' as a radical career shift.  Perhaps they have become
bored with their current jobs and want a bit more excitement.

As an example, a run-of-the-mill Imperial Navy officer musters out and
gets a desk job with an IN defense contractor.  This person might not
fit well into a Traveller campaign.  The player character musters out
of his career with 1) few ties, and 2) a reasonable amount of his 
average lifespan remaining.  This type of person could fit easily
into most types of Traveller campaigns.

Bryan, a gentle reminder. Joules and Megawatts are different dimensions,
so you are comparing apples and oranges. A Joule is a measure of Energy,
whereas a Watt is a measure of Power. Power is defined as the rate of
Energy use.

For an example, an automobile\'s gasoline tank holds gasoline, which has
an intrinsic fixed value of pontential energy per unit volume. I don\'t
know the real numbers, but assume that 1 kg of gasoline when combusted
with oxygen, will yeild 1MJ of energy. Now, this energy can be expended
at minute rates or huge rates, but the same quantity of potential energy
is released.

A Watt is defined as the use of 1 Joule per second. So, 1 kg of gasoline
fully combusted (1MJ) over 20 seconds would yeild an energy rate (power
dissipation) of 1MJ/20s = 50kJ/s = 50kW. If instead you squandered the
1kg of gasoline in .2 seconds, you would yeild a power of 1MJ/.2s =
5MJ/s = 5MW.

Pop quiz:
	1) does an automobile travelling up a hill at 20m/s have greater
	   ENERGY that one with the same amount of gas traveling down a
	   hill at the same altitude at 60m/s?
	2) does an automobile travelling up a hill at 20m/s generating
	   greater POWER that one with the same amount of gas traveling
	   down a hill at the same altitude at 60m/s?

Answers:
	1) no, both vehicles have the same amount of gas in the tank, so
	   chemical energy is the same; they have the same gravitational
	   potential energy (same altitude) and kinetic energy (same
	   speed).
	2) yes, the vehicle travelling up the hill is working harder.
	   It\'s using gasoline at a greater rate to increase it\'s
	   gravitational potential energy (altitude) while maintaining a
	   constant kinetic energy (speed).

You can also roughly think of energy as the capacity to perform work,
and power as the rate that work is getting done.

     Jietlshaiepr strolled onto the bridge and gazed longingly at
Niedrsha.  "So, how are we doing?" she whispered softly.
     Miakr stared into the sensors.  "Three of the SDBs have
altered course to attack the VIXEN, leaving two still after us...
The VIXEN is coming into range... in two minutes."
     Miakr raised his eyes from the sensors for a moment and
stretched his neck, "I directed her to make one pass to draw them
off and then continue on an intercept course to the Spindleman.
They\'re jerks, but they are fighting the right people."
     Jietlshaiepr sighed and became businesslike with a tinge of
regret.  "Time to get in range of the Spindleman?"
     "Ten minutes... just after the SDBs get there."
     Niedrsha shook his head.  "The Chekbas has jumped out.  The
Shoolist is just about to try.  Fuck, they\'re nuts!"
     The Shoolist was just a speck on the scopes.  The chronometer
ticked off the seconds till they gambled their lives.  Even if they
came out in an star system, they had no way to refuel.  They had a
one way ticket on a mystery tour to nowhere.
     Niedrsha found himself counting quietly to himself, "Four...
Three...  Two...  One...  Ze...", he was cut off as the dot
suddenly flared brilliantly and vanished.
     He checked the instruments, "She\'s vaporized..."
     Jietlshaiepr took a deep breath.  She leaned over Miakr to
look into the readouts, "Ok, let\'s see how our little VIXEN makes
out."
          - VIII -
     The VIXEN charged into missile range and released her deadly
cargo.  Four flights of missiles fanned out like streamers
towards their targets.
     Another blossom of missiles surged into the vacuum as the
space around the VIXEN surged with laser light from the SDBs.
A flash, a surge, lanthanum boiled into space as the VIXEN was
illuminated momentarily by a 750 megawatt laser battery.
          - IX -
     "She\'s hit!" Miakr half shouted.  "It\'s all confused... All
right, the jump drives been hit, probably totaled.  It was in
pretty bad shape anyway...  Maneuver drive\'s damaged, down to
five point three G\'s acceleration...  Number two turret seems to
be slow...  but it\'s still in action!"
     Jietlshaiepr breathed, "Right, Miakr, get the robots to work
on the..."
     "Already done.", he shot.  "I\'ve had them programmed for
damage control since we entered combat."
     "Good boy."
     Niedrsha grinned, "Here comes missile intercept..."
     The screen flashed briefly with fission fire.  Smaller
flares went up as high explosive crashed into the SDBs.
     Miakr read off the sensors.  "One SDB took a nuke... she\'s
sluggish... hit in the maneuver drives...  The other two are
hit...  Can\'t get a good reading at this range, but they took
some damage."
     "Hold on to your hats, there goes the second flight of
missiles." smiled Niedrsha.
     More flashes, barely visible at five million kilometers
range lit the screen.
     "Another nuclear strike hit..." grinned Miakr, "Can\'t get a
reading this time...  No engine damage, that\'s for sure.  They\'re
still pursuing at the same speed.  No change in power generated.
Probable weapon damage."
     Jietlshaiepr drew a deep breath, "Maintain firing."
     The VIXEN continued to spiral missiles towards her
opponents.  A brief flare showed her silhouette against the stars
as she twisted to escape.
     Miakr stiffened, "Number three turret damaged... Still in
action.
     "Another strike got through.  One SDB losing fuel...  Blast
these sensors, I can\'t tell if we\'re doing anything or not!"
     "Check out the Spindleman," cautioned Niedrsha.  "She\'s
about in range of the other two ships."
     "Viepchakl!" Miakr\'s eye\'s grew wide.  "They\'re plastering
the Spindleman...  Multiple damage...  Fuel leak...  I read
vaporized lanthanum:  their jump drive\'s out...  Maneuver drive\'s
out...  I wonder if there\'s any one left alive..."
     The SDBs turned their attention to the onrushing VIXEN just
as she laid her nuclear eggs.  A geyser of fuel fogged the vacuum
momentarily obscuring her outline but she flew on with her wings
paralyzed.
     "Shit!" screamed Miakr. "The VIXEN\'s maneuver drives are
dead...  Can\'t get anything from the engine room!  She\'s out of
control!"
     The VIXEN\'s missiles continued to fly.  Slugging all her
remaining strength into her weapons, she swung at her enemies.
     "She\'s still hitting them."  read Miakr, I can\'t really see
what she\'s doing to them but she\'s still firing."
     The SDBs couldn\'t miss a drifting target.  The VIXEN
continued to pour missiles out of her turrets and bay as they
pounded her.  The missile bay with it\'s nuclear missiles was
their first target.  It was quickly reduced to glowing metal.
The final end came when her last fuel tank ruptured under the
punishment of the mass attack of the five SDBs.  Low on fuel
after the jump, her power plant strangled as it\'s blood ran into
the vacuum.
     Jietlshaiepr looked up from the display.  "We\'re on our own
now."
          - X -
     "Missiles away!" Gresha barked as six nuclear tipped
missiles flared from the Flamboyant\'s racks.
     "Impact at this range:  thirty one minutes." calculated
Niedrsha, "We\'ll be down in thirty two.  I\'m headin\' for the
ocean:  it\'s on the night side.  We\'ll put down and submerge.
That ought\'a give their gunners a few headaches."
     "How long till they touch down?"
     Niedrsha\'s holographic head\'s up display flashed.  "One hour,
forty minutes, eighteen seconds.  We\'ve got ten minutes before they
reach missile range...  laser range in ten seconds.  Laser
batteries stand by."
     "Laser one ready." called Kaezorr.
     "Laser two ready." grumbled Rackan.
     Jietlshaiepr studied the range, "Niedrsha, evasive action. 
Lasers commence firing!"
     The Flamboyant wound itself into a knot as Niedrsha jerked
the controls into a tight roll.
     X-ray lasers began blasting into the night seeking targets,
but the SDBs flew on untouched by the onslaught of power.
     Moment\'s later the SDBs own lasers flicked on seeking the
fleeing Escort.  The visible spectrum lasers flashed on into the
clouds of Welles below them.
     "Brrrraaacht... A laser strike at this range\'ll only be by a
stroke of luck." growled Kaezorr.
      "Keep at it," Jietlshaiepr breathed, "and hope they\'re not
any luckier..."
     Laser light blared back and forth as the gunners played a
vicious game with seven hundred fifty megawatts of power.  "I
can\'t tell if I\'m hittin\' \'em or not!" barked Rackan.
     More missiles dropped from the Flamboyant\'s tubes and burned
their way to the enemy.
     "I hit one!" called Kaezorr.
     Miakr read off the sensors.  X-ray radiation emanated from
the first SDB.  "The leading SDB was hit.  Can\'t verify any
damage, but it hit."
     Jietlshaiepr bit her lip, "Good job, maintain fire."
     Time after time the lasers streaked out into space.  "We
can\'t hit \'em." barked Rackan.
     "They can\'t hit us either." called Miakr.  "Concentrate fire
on the wing SDB:  the leader has ceased fire.  That hit must have
damaged their lasers."
     "Roger."
     Minutes dragged as the SDBs closed.  Wildly slashing beams of
photons flared; the superior targeting of the Flamboyant balanced
by the superior agility of the SDBs.  At a range of five hundred
thousand kilometers where light takes three and a third seconds to
go and return, only luck could result in a solid hit.
     Rackan began cursing the lasers in unintelligible Gevueg
quietly but soon it got loud quickly.  "Grraph ersharrrfphessh
shreeelipf GARRCHT!  Verrsh!  I hit the veersheg!"
     "Hit to their laser batteries." called Miakr.  "They\'ve
ceased laser fire.  Their missiles are still after us though."
     "That\'s stupid." laughed Niedrsha, "We\'ll be underwater
before they can possibly get anywhere near us."
     "They\'re still closing."
     "Maintain fire." ordered Jietlshaiepr.
     The lasers kept firing as the silent SDBs pursued but not a
single more hit was made.
          - XI -
     "Cease fire, we\'re heading into the atmosphere." called
Niedrsha, "We\'re gonna be a fireball in a few seconds.  We\'ll
show up on their infrared sensors like an imposter at an
invisible man convention.
     "Engine room, divert power to overdrive engines.  We need
emergency agility."
     "You got it Niedrsha." announced Shtam, "Emergency power
available on your demand."
     "Here we go!"  The Flamboyant surged like a thing alive,
invigorated by the diverted power and the guidance of Niedrsha\'s
hands.  She rolled and soared with a dancer\'s grace through a
choreography as much pleasing to the eye as confusing to a
gunner.
     "Altitude:  one hundred forty nine kilometers." Niedrsha
announced, "Touch down seven minutes.  Passengers will please
fasten their seat belts..."
     The fringes of the atmosphere began to glow on the windows
of the ship.
     "We\'ve lost radar contact.  We\'re in radio blackout." said
Miakr tensely.
     "Viepchakl!" breathed Jietlshaiepr, "We\'re a shooting star.
How can they miss?"
     Niedrsha caught her eye and grinned, "Just watch me,
sweetheart."
     The Flamboyant glowed cherry red as she twisted into Welles
atmosphere.
          - XII -
     A few minutes later the radio crackled.  "...ones.  Come in
Flamboyant.  \'mergency...  \'mergency... Come in Flamboyant.  \'is
is Surgeon Lt. Jones o\' the League o\' Suns."
     Jietlshaiepr took the radio, "Flamboyant here, go ahead Lt."
     "Requestin\' tight beam communications.  Change course,

an \'ostile area.  Mercenary company `ats thick wi\' the pirates.

     "Gotcha." mumbled Niedrsha.
     "We\'ve lost contact with the Spindleman." continued Jones.
"What ya got on her?"
     Miakr read off, "Uhhh... Spindleman took heavy laser damage.
maneuver drives out, jump drives too, I think.  Her power plant
was still going, but she was losing fuel."
     "Thank ya, Flamboyant.  Request rendezvous wi\' ya ot eleven
degrees north, zero degrees east.  Thot\'s seventy kilometers
north o\' the starport.  We\'re going te need each other."
     Jietlshaiepr sniffed, "Have you got anything to deal with a
ship of the line?"
     "Ah, Negative, Flamboyant."
     "Ok, Jones, but don\'t wait up for us.  We\'re busy.  We\'ll
give you a signal code burst...  Uhhh...  Stat Code Blue."
     "Affirmative, good luck.  Lt. Jones out."
     Miakr read the sensors, "Missile intercept coming up...
now!"
     Nuclear flowers blossomed in the night, lighting the
darkened side of the planet as the missiles crashed into the wing
SDB, flooding the spectrum with static.
     A moment later the second flight of missiles flew among the
SDBs.  The lead SDB flared as the missiles blazed into it.
     "They\'re hit, but still flying." called Miakr.  "Too much
interference from the blast.  I can\'t tell what it did to them."
     "Hold on!" growled Niedrsha, "Here comes the water...  We\'re
going in."
     The Flamboyant lurched as she hit the water.  Inertial
compensators strained to keep the stress down, but still it was a
rough ride.  The hull rattled and rang as water boiled off the
surfaces of the ship, blazing hot after the wild ride through the
atmosphere, sending billowing steam into the night.  Finally, she
stopped pitching as she lost weigh and drifted in the water.
     "Dive!  Dive!" called Jietlshaiepr, "Engine room, open fuel
stop cocks.  Take us down."
          - XIII -
     Missiles smashed into the surface of the water where the
Flamboyant had landed sending plumes of water hundreds of meters
in the air.
     Protected by the depths, the Flamboyant sank unharmed to the
bottom with her eyes wide open.  Jietlshaiepr studied the
sensors; densitometers and neutrino detector taking the place of
radar and ladar, not as accurate, but still workable.  "We\'re
safe down here for the moment...  We have fifty eight minutes
before the SDBs are in down.  The other five SDBs have followed
us down.  They will be here in one hundred and two minutes.  Star
Rider is still heading for the Kivas.  They\'ll rendezvous in...
two hours thirty seven minutes.  The other SDBs have turned to
rendezvous with the Star Rider.  Looks like they finished with
the...  Hold on... I\'m picking up movement.  I can\'t identify...
It must be the Spindleman.  They\'re alive.  She\'s in a descending
orbit.  Dragoon must be crazy.  With all the damage, she\'ll burn
up."
     "Hold on." Niedrsha examined the sensors.  "I think they\'re
coming in for a EVA re-entry."
     "Combat drop." thought Jietlshaiepr, "Viepchakl, what a
ride.  They\'re gonna need a recovery team."
     "That ain\'t us.  Leave \'em to Jones." snorted Niedrsha.
"They\'ll be in position to try in in three hours forty four
minutes."
     "Seven SDBs:  two damaged, five fresh."
     "Well, in this atmosphere, they can\'t go any faster than we
can, and on the deck, we can go faster than they in a nape of the
ground mode."
     "That\'s not very comforting, but it\'s something." sighed
Jietlshaiepr.  "There\'s an ocean trench forty kilometers east.
We\'ll take them there."
          - XIV -
     The SBDs skimmed the surface, landed, submerged and came
hunting.
     Miakr read it off, "We\'ve got one forty kilometers off to
the north east and one fifty to the south south east."
     "All right, let\'s go." Jietlshaiepr breathed.  The
Flamboyant was ready:  high explosive missiles loaded and the
power plant throttled down to minimum to avoid detection.
     The ship looked out into the murky depths.  Her densitometer
scanning the waters, she sought out the enemy power plants with
her neutrino detector.
     "Maximum range of our missiles is about fifteen kilometers
underwater.  We\'re gonna have to be awfully close." commented
Gresha.
     "They can\'t see as well as we can in water, their sensors
are not as good as ours:  those SDBs are only tech level twelve."
commented Shtam from the engine room.
     "Agreed, but at this range it won\'t help us that much."
interjected Kfoks.
     "One\'s breached the surface and is coming in overhead."
called Miakr.  "Forty three kilometers and closing bearing one six
three degrees.  Speed:  one thousand two hundred kilometers per
hour."
     "Ready missiles." called Jietlshaiepr.
     "Forty one kilometers... time to range mark:  one minute
ten seconds...  Mark!  The other one\'s following suit, bearing
five zero degrees, time to range mark:  one minute twenty five
seconds...  Mark!"
     "Niedrsha take us up to forty meters and put us over on our
starboard side.  Gunners stay sharp, dorsal turret take the east,
ventral take the south target."
     The SDBs bore in skimming the water meters over the surface.
Sending up huge blasts of water as their sonic booms blasted the
surface of the water setting up wakes that shone in the
moonlight.
     Seconds dragged by as the sensors counted the rapidly
decreasing range.
     Jietlshaiepr breathed heavily, "Begin evasive action.
Range?"
     Miakr read the sensors nervously, "Twenty two and thirty
kilometers respectively."
     "Open fire when the second is at twenty kilometers."
     "Thirty seconds." counted Miakr.  "Here they come...  Speed
one thousand...  Range twenty five...  Fifteen seconds...  Ten...
Range twenty two...  They\'re slowing down."
     "Damn the range, get \'em while they\'re airborne.  Open
fire."
     Six missiles left the tubes and speared through the water.
     "Intercept:  four seconds..." swallowed Miakr.
     "Niedrsha, take us down!  One hundred meters!"
     The Flamboyant dove for the bottom as the SDBs came
barrelling in.  Missiles smashed through the water and blasted
the after underbelly of the leader.  Caught, she flipped and
tumbled bow first into the water at nine hundred kilometers per
hour.  The bridge wind screen shattered and flooded the bridge.
The inertial compensators collapsed as the ship hit sending the
full force of the hypersonic crash throughout the ship.  End over
end the ship tumbled, spinning and spreading wreckage over a two
kilometer strech of open ocean.
     The second SDB caught a missile on her port bow throwing the
starboard side stern into the water.  Caught by the dragging
water she slewed around to starboard, spinning like a disk and
smashed her engines into the concrete hardness of the water at
the speed of sound.  She bounced and planed to a stop.
     She was badly twisted and riddled with gaps where armor
plating buckled and bent.  Quickly she filled with water and
sank.
     "She\'s going down..." called Miakr.  "Densitometer says
she\'s half full of water...  What\'s left of the hull won\'t hold
in the depths.  She\'s at two hundred meters and going down
fast...  Two fifty...  Hearing straining bulkheads...  three
hundred meters..."
     A huge explosion set the hull ringing.  The inertial
compensators took out most of the rocking.
     "She\'s blown up!  The magazines went!"
     Jietlshaiepr took a deep breath and flopped back in her
acceleration couch.  "Two down...  Five to go.  It isn\'t going to
be any easier:  they won\'t make that mistake twice."
          - XV -
     Two SDBs stayed in orbit.  Three came in lower.
     The Flamboyant lurked forty meters under, safe from
bombardment.  Every few minutes a lone missile came down and
exploded as it hit the surface.
     "They keep inching lower, but that\'s all." yawned Miakr
shaking with fatigue and nerves.  "Viepchakl, we\'ve been at this
for nearly five hours.  Seven hours and fifty one minutes since
we received the Droyne distress signal."
     Jietlshaiepr smiled weakly, "Just be glad they aren\'t firing
nuclear rounds."
     Shtam, sighed over the intercom, "They are probably out of
nuclear missiles.  They only fired one:  that being at the Droyne
cruiser.  They have not used one more.  We on the other hand Have
used them.  That must be why they are staying off until they can
get the big guns to bear on us:  the Star Rider\'s spinal mount
meson accelerator."
     Niedrsha brushed the hair from his forehead, "That\'s not for
a while yet, they\'re still fifty minutes away from the Kivas.  I
hope they don\'t find your work Shtam."
     "Ok!" barked Jietlshaiepr jumping to her feet.  "Gresha, you
awake?"
     "Rrrrrrrrooff!" yawned Gresha, "Yeah, I\'m still on my feet."
     "How many missiles have we got?"
     "Oh, we\'ve still got quite a few.  Plus the ones still in
the Vipers, oh...  eighteen fission rounds, thirty one high
explosive."
     "Ok, what loads have you got in there now?"
     "Fission."
     "Right.  In forty minutes I want you to reload with high
explosive."
     "Why?"
     "They don\'t know how many missiles we have.  If we convince
them we\'re out of nuclear rounds, we can coax them down for a
good shot at them when they\'re in the atmosphere."
     Niedrsha smiled getting the picture, "And if we convince
them when they\'re taking the Kivas on board the Star Rider..."
     Jietlshaiepr nodded, "They\'ll be too busy to find Shtam\'s
handiwork."

Joules = newton * Meters

Watts = Joules / Second = newton * meters / second

They aren\'t the same units.  You would have to have Joules /

You can\'t convert from joules to megawatts, any more than you can convert
from seconds to mph. They\'re two different quantities, not just different
units. The joule is a unit of energy, and the megawatt is a unit of power
(energy per unit time). One megawatt is one million joules per second.

The FTD Courier/Reconbot is meant as support for planetside Scout
teams in covert situations.  The robot can act either autonomously
or under guidance from an orbital platform to carry small items of
cargo to and from the surface of a planet.  Thus supporting covert
teams without endangering other personell.

The robot\'s sensor packages and programming are sufficient to allow
it to avoid all contact and maneuver in a variety of environments.

They are often used by teams when surveying primitive planets where
teams may not carry high tech equipment and it must be smuggled
down.  In such cases, the masercom may not be needed which will
drastically reduce the price.  Indeed the Far Orbit range
communicators account for 202,000 Credits of the total price.

Given the raw materials, The Lagarfeld fashionbot can produce an
individually taylored garment in less than an hour.

The sophont to be fitted merely goes through an interactive program
with the machine describing the item of clothing to be produced. 
The robot\'s sensors can take the measurements and visuals of the
client and project a holo image of the client wearing the clothes
before they are made.  In such a way the sophont can see exactly
what they will look like in the clothes and adjust them to their
taste before manufacture.

With four dexterous tentacles and two tayloring packages, the bot
Lagarfeld unit can work with any material:  leather, cotton,
synthetics, fur etc. etc.  The small lasers of the taylor packages
are used for cutting and welding synthetics for taylored vac suits.
To produce a taylored vac suit requires access to tech level 14 or
better materials though.

Should the client be uncertain of a what they desire, the robot has
an extensive memory of past fashions and styles.  It\'s emotion
simulation programing allows it to make suggestions tactfully.  The
machines can improve their skills as they learn, and as a machine
becomes more experienced it can (and often does) become more
forceful with it\'s suggestions.  [Warning:  such robots become
bored with making run of the mill stuff and tend to push more
fancuful creations.]

Thus, a high tech clothes shop tends not to be so much racks and
racks of clothes, as large selections of cloth and materials.
Sales clerks aide in the selection of the material and direct the
clients to the robots.  Thereafter, they make agreeable noises as
to the quality of the finished product.

Then I got my copy of Assignment Vigilante and the Imperial Lines No.1.
In it I found some comments about Starship building.
And that was what I learn:
One of the things, where you can save volume, weight and money is
Live Support. Simply calculate Live support only for the inhabited zones

of this decision is the fact, that you can\'t maintain the vehicle in space

lovely places to maintain Fighters. As a reslut, here is the Falcon-Class
Battlefighter:

Comments:
- - Duartion: The duration mentioned above is for cuise mode, Maneuver=2
	    and Life Support. The following table shows effects of other
	    modes:

  Powerplant Out:	kl/h	kl/day
	756 MW		0.378	9.072	Maneuver=6 + weapons + LS
	252 MW		0.126	3.024	Maneuver=6 + LS (no weapons)
	 90 MW		0.045	1.080   Maneuver=2 + LS
- - The DefDM calculates on the formula presented in the MEGATRAVELLER
  Referee\'s guide
- - Please note: The Fighter can be made about 8 MCr cheaper, if the
  armor is reduced to 40G. I have decided to use 58G, because so additional
  criticals up to weapon UPC 4 do not take place.

If anyone is interested in flying bricks like a TL 25 Disp=20 Armor=118H

plant and carrying a beam laser. A beam laser requires 500MW of
power to operate, is this an error? I have seen this same type
of error numerous times in the VD archives. Also the Falcon

the lack of consistancy bothers me greatly, another example:
"at tech level 17, laser weapons are powered from internal

have power supplies like this for TL17 vehicles; the smallest
TL17 antimatter power supply listed in the design rules is

That sounds pretty complete to me.  Anyone looking at my compiled design
archives will find that I used a combination of George Herbert\'s naval
design system, and some cumbersome rummaging about in Mark\'s Handbook of
Mechanical Engineering to do various watercraft designs prior to the 
publication of Wet Navy in Challenge.  As the issue now stands, I need to
write up the hybrid system for watercraft using the better parts of both 
systems.

Rob is right.  I have used George Herbert\'s naval designs a few times
prior to Wet Navy coming out.  And some guesswork on a lot of naval
designs that I put up before George\'s stuff.

I think I used George\'s design system on the SHADO Skydiver, and the
Herbert Dean Meson Submarine.

The designs previous to that pulled engine statistics directly from
books on warships along with their stated performance.  The only thing
there that wasn\'t a matter of common sence was the size and weight of
the propellers.  I forget what I used, (I think it was Rob\'s suggestion
to use the transmission of a tracked design with volume, weight, cost
multiplied by 2)

Since Wet NAvy has come out, I use it, but I think Rob is right:  We
need to incorporate George
\'s ideas into a Good design system for ships.

How does a character gain an AT in a skill that he already has through
experience only?
 
        On page 4 of the Player\'s Handbook there are rules for
characters to improve their skills with.  Me and my group of players are
having trouble understanding exactly how this procedure goes for a
character to improve his or her stats by experience.  This is how we
understand the procedure to go so far:
 
        First off, a character in the group has to have the skill that
another player wants to gain proficiency in.  When this character uses
the skill, the player obverves the procedure, through (Difficult,
Determination).  If he is successful in this task he gains the skill
temporarily at level-0.  Then when the opportunity arises he tries a
task that uses this skill, and if he succeeds, he gains an AT in this
skill.  This sounds like an unusual procedure, so can someone give us
confirmation on it?
 
        Later on the page, under Gaining The Skill, it mentions the
procedure for a character to improve the skill once he has the AT in it.
It also says that if the character already has that skill, success
increases the skill one level.  But, how does that character gain the AT
in this skill he already has?  Does he observe someone with the same
skill but at a higher level than himself?  Or is the observation/tryout
stuff just skipped?  The rules don\'t say, and this has befuddled us as
to what the correct procedure is.  Someone please enlighten us.

A few odds and ends I\'ve been chewing on.

Did you all get to see Patriot Games?  Good flick, not as good as the book,
but it was pretty good.  It did give me an idea for Traveller.  There is
one scene in there where they are watching an assault on a desert base at
night using overhead orbital surveillance cameras.

The images they get are almost good enough to identify individuals.  It
seems to me that if the troops involved carried Identification Friend or
Foe Transponders (as we assume is carried in combat armor and battle dress)
You could easily target individuals on the surface of a planet from orbit.
The images were THAT clear.  I\'m not even sure you\'d need transponders.
You could see what they were wearing, and if the uniforms of the troops
were sufficiently different, it would be child\'s play.

	"Yes sir!  We\'ve got the Zhodani General targeted!"

The old line in the 60\'s was "We can read the numbers off the liscense
plates with the spy satillites."  Well, we know that isn\'t true, but
given a passive array that we say has \'Interstellar\' range, I can see
there being a LOT better resolution than what we have today.

That means that just about every ship that carries a laser would be
absolutely DEADLY to ANYONE on the ground.  You wanna assassinate Lucan?
Just go into orbit around Capital and wait till he steps outside!

- ----
Another odd point:
The maximum listed speed for a man wearing a grav belt is 300km/hr.
Why?  Drag?  Skydivers travel MUCH faster than that.

Case:  I forget when it was done, but sometime back in the 50\'s-60\'s they
were experimenting with high altitude ejection.  I remember hearing a guy
talk about setting the world record for the highest parachute jump on some
documentary or other.  He said that on the way down he actually went
supersonic.  When he got into the thicker atmosphere, he slowed way, way
down before he pulled the chute.

Now there is an unstreamlined object (If I ever heard of one)
travelling supersonic and it was accelerating at 1G.

YEEE HAAA!  What-a-ride!

Andrew Bond asked about the Imp. Encyclopedia.
The designs in there are a mess and are full of typos errors and all
sorts of things.  The 10 ton fighter there is clearly impossible.

You mentioned similar errors in the vehicle archives?  OUR vehicle
archives?  Not in MY designs!  Where!  Where!  I may make the occasional
typoxsh#4, but I don\'t think *I\'m* guilty of common sense mistakes like
the ones in the Imp Encyclopedia.

As for where those weird anti-matter pods come from?  Who knows?
Who cares?  The design system was very well thought out past TL 15.
TL 16 is pushing it and 17 is right out.  Plus with the corrections
made to the fission plants, they are more economical cost and fuel
space wise than the listed antimatter stuff.

Do they?  Terminal velocity (at reasonable altitudes) is approximately 120 MPH.
Terminal velocity is the speed at which the drag of falling through the
air exactly balances the force of gravity pulling you down.  You can change
this to some degree by streamlining your body (pull your arms and legs into
line with the torso), but I don\'t think you gain a LOT of speed.

The speed of sound varies with the density of the medium, so it would be less
at higher altitudes.  Since the Terminal Velocity also varies inversely to the
density of the air, these two speeds should move toward each other at higher
altitudes (i.e. TV goes up, SoS goes down).  How closely they approach, I have
no idea.   Any real aerodynamicists out there?

Possibly, GDW considers grav belts to put out a constant force, therefore,
they would produce a constant speed at max output, like terminal Velocity.  If
all grav belts come from the factory preset, this would account for the
constant max V.

But, consider this...

     "Miakr, Niedrsha, wake up."  Jietlshaiepr shook the bridge
crew awake.  "Rendezvous:  Star Rider has been standing off the
Kivas for six minutes.  That\'s just enough for them to find the
booby trap in the magazines.
     "Gresha, are you ready?" she asked.
     "High explosive rounds loaded in the dorsal turret, nuclear
in the ventral.  When we\'re ready we flip and fire."
     "Miakr, what altitude are they at?"
     "The three are at one hundred seventy kilometers, the other
two are at twenty nine thousand:  synchronous orbit."
     "Gresha, fire one missile at each of the low targets.  Just
one missile at a time.  Get across to them we\'re running out."
     "Firing!"
     The first missile rose to fifty kilometers before the enemy
lasers blew it to shreds.
     The second was blown apart at one hundred twenty kilometers.
     The third hit.
     "Out gassing, looks like we hit a fuel tank." sighed Miakr.
     "Gresha, fire one round at each of the ships\'s we didn\'t
hit.  Leave the other alone."
     "Firing!"
     The SDBs sidestepped the missiles and blasted them from the
sky with their lasers.
     "All right, Gresha one more shot at the leading one and
that\'s it."
     "Firing!"
     The missile lifted clear of the atmosphere and hit the
leader.
     Miakr studied the read out, "Can\'t read any damage...  We
connected though...  Hold on...  Here they come!  One hundred
sixty kilometers and descending.  They\'ll start re-entry in
thirty seconds.
     "Niedrsha, surface!  Laser turrets, fire when breach."
     The Flamboyant rose and broke the surface in the dark night.
     Six 250 megawatt X-ray lasers struck out into the blackness.
Three fireballs streaking through the upper atmosphere could not
evade.
     "We hit two of them, I can\'t read any thing definite."
growled Miakr.
     "Maintain fire!  Hit \'em while their burning!"
     The lasers hummed, sending streams of high energy photons into
into the night.
     "We\'ve hit them a few times." strained Miakr, "I can\'t see a
damn thing...  They\'re coming out of re-entry.  Altitude one
hundred ten kilometers."
     "Dive!  Dive!  Take us down, Niedrsha!  One hundred meters!"
     Flamboyant went under shaking from the blasts as the surface
was pummeled with visible light lasers and high explosive
missiles.
     "Are you sure it\'s a good idea to DRAW their attention?"
asked Miakr incredulously.
     "Better their\'s than Star Rider\'s."
     "Point taken."
     The surface of the water glowed bright white as the lasers
of the three SDBs tried vainly to reach the Flamboyant.  The
power diffused too rapidly through the ocean water.
     "We loose a flight of nuclear missiles when they\'re at five
kilometers.  Power down all unnecessary systems.  Prepare for
fission blast."
     "Five minutes forty till firing..." called off Miakr.
"Altitude:  ninety five kilometers..."
     Shtam cut power to general systems and rigged the current
grounds to the engine capacitors.  The electromagnetic pulse
picked up by the ship\'s electronics would be channeled into the
power plant restart system.  This should avoid most of the damage
and shorts triggered by the atomic fission blast.  The computer,
power and other vital systems would be triggered to shut down
after the missiles fired.
     In advance the systems were pre-checked for emergency
restart.
     Miakr read, "Twenty seconds to fire...  Altitude ten
kilometers..."
     "Invert the ship." ordered Jietlshaiepr.  "Everyone strap
in.  We\'ll lose artificial gravity when we cut power."
     Miakr counted the range, "Ten seconds...  Seven
kilometers...  Five...  Four.....  Two...  One...  Fire!"
     Three fission warheads left the missile racks of the
darkening Flamboyant.
     The missiles rose at eight G\'s for seven seconds.  Streaking
into the night and into the heart of the SDB formation.

     Three SDBs spun wildly out of control caught off guard by a
nuclear blast.  Two of them fell uncontrollably and smashed into
the sea disintegrating on the surface.
     The third and farthest from the blast spiraled away flaming
as her blasted fuel tanks gave up their hydrogen blood.  She came
spinning down, loosing power as her power plant strangled itself.
     The pilot, surrounded by the corpses of the rest of the
bridge crew, pulled up.  The power was fading fast.  The nose
stayed up but the drives were failing.  Descending fast, the ship
came down and skimmed the surface headed for shore.  The inertial
compensators failed he strapped himself in and waited for the
shock of impact.  Ground effect kept her aloft for a few hundred
meters then she hit:  stern first.
     She plowed through the water to a stop.  Quickly, the
cracked fuel tanks filled with water:  hydrogen for the fusion
plant.  But the tortured power plant had suffered enough.  It grew
cold in its innards and refused to restart.
     The fuel tanks leaked, flooding the engine room and aft
sections.  The deck tilted as the stern went down.
     The pilot got up and struggled to the air lock:  unmovable
with the power shut down.  Quickly, he grabbed a survival kit and
fired the explosive bolts of the windscreen.
     He climbed painfully out onto the nose of the SDB, inflated
the raft, and flung it and himself into the water.
          - XIX -
     Flamboyant\'s power came back quickly.
     "Good work, Shtam.  All stations report in!" called
Jietlshaiepr.
     Calls came in from all over the ship.
     "Computer operational!  Sensors... noisy, but operational!"
     "Helm answering!"
     "Engine room, all drives check!"
     "Dorsal missile turret check!"
     "Ventral missile turret check!"
     "Starboard laser turret check!"
     "Port laser turret check!"
     "We were very lucky..." sighed Jietlshaiepr.  "Miakr, where is
the Star Rider?"
     Miakr\'s eyes grew wide, "She\'s coming right at us!"
     A blast of heavy meson fire exploded through the water.
     "VIEPCHAKLVA!" Jietlshaiepr screamed.  "Shtam!  Detonate the
plant!  NOW!"
     The Kivas power plant suddenly activated and ran up to full
power.  The electromagnetic plasma bottle drew the full power of
the fusion plant containing the plasma even tighter inducing more
fusion reactions in the hydrogen plasma.  The increased power was
fed into the plasma bottle drawing the plasma even tighter
increasing power in a geometric progression...
1..2..4..8..16..32..64..128..256..512..1024..2048..4096..8192..
16384..32768..65536..131072..262144..524288..1048576..2097152..
     The dawn sky flared with a blinding fusion flash for a
second which broke the Star Rider\'s back.  Molten pieces of the
pirate ship blossomed into space, flaring and burning as they hit
the atmosphere or freezing as they drifted into interplanetary
space.
          - XX -
     An hour later, the main bridge crew was sleeping off the
battle.  Taek Kfoks turned away from the sensors and back to the
helm.  "I guess they were right.  The two SDBs haven\'t moved from
orbit.  They\'re just sitting there.  There\'s nowhere they can go:
they aren\'t jump capable, and they don\'t want to take us on.
They\'ll just have to wait it out."
     "And we\'re trapped down here!" snarled Tuerz.
     Kfoks nodded calmly, "True, if we took off, we\'d never make
jump before they\'d be shaking us in their jaws.  Their detectors
can pick up a one gigawatt fusion plant.  We\'d have to run power
up to a minimum of that to get this ship to move.  The fighters
and the Gig could move, but where would you go on this planet?"
     "Grrrraaph.  I\'d like to saw their fingers off one by one.
Taek, I can\'t stand this waiting!  I\'ve got to kill someone.
Maybe Stuzzel..."
     Long used to his excitable friend\'s nervous murderousness,
Kfoks responded quietly and calmly, "No, don\'t kill him.  We need
him.  We\'re in too much of a jam for you to have fun with him."
     "But one day, you\'ll let me kill him won\'t you?"
     "Sure, if it comes to that, but I hope you\'ll get a chance
to get one of the enemy.  There\'s a mercenary company on this
planet, probably with connections to the pirates.  If we can
catch..."
     "Interrogate!" grinned Tuerz.
     "Yes." nodded Kfoks.
     "Torture..." sighed Tuerz.
     "Yes." nodded Kfoks.
     Tuerz went into a silent reverie contemplating the
interrogation of a captured mercenary.
     Kfoks sighed inwardly.  Tuerz was getting close to panic
with pressure and inaction.  It was fortunate that he enjoyed his
fantasies enough to take away the panic, but Tuerz blood lust
was up now.  At least it had been channeled towards the enemy. 
Left to himself, Tuerz could be a danger to almost everyone.
          - XXI -
     Jietlshaiepr sat yawning and sipping her morning tea in sick
bay listening to the grateful Droyne captain explain their story.
They got through the shredded galanglic slowly with the help of the
other Droyne:
     They were a trade convoy out of Tesser, a large population
planet in the Consulate, headed back from a tour of the systems
around the sector that had Droyne inhabitants.  They jumped to
Welles for fuel.  The planet\'s inhabitants were having big
trouble.  A strange plague which only killed certain human
genotypes and an apparently high tech mercenary company involved
in slaving on the low tech planet.
     The League of Suns had sent an expedition to find out about
all the trouble and they had apparently cured the disease.
     The Droyne got their fuel and were heading out when BANG!
     They had been rather well armed because of the mounting
piracy in the sector.  Thus they carried a six Droyne team of
drop troops.
     Yes, actually, they had heard of Dr. Malenkoviepr.  Born on
Tesser, fully integrated into Droyne society and understanding.
Never met him, but understand he\'s quite intelligent for a human
with their strange ways...
          - XXII -
     Shtam took the Gig\'s controls and dropped away from the
submerged Flamboyant.
      "Go five kilometers south and surface." ordered
Jietlshaiepr.  "We\'ll transmit the signal:  \'Stat Code Blue\'.
That\'ll bring Lt. Jones to the rendezvous point."
     Kfoks began checking over his huge armored tilly.  "We\'d
better be ready.  If Dragoon is typical of them they might try to
commandeer the Flamboyant."
     "I\'d like to see them try." laughed Gresha stroking the side
of the tilly with the armored gloves of her battle dress.
     Jietlshaiepr shook her head and checked her fusion gun,
"They just better not.  We\'ve got enough troubles as it is."
     "They obviously need help or they would not have requested
this meeting." observed Vole.  "It is not beyond human capacity
to take what they need."
          - XXIII -
     Vole stalked through the underbrush of the prairie towards
the grounded Air/Raft, pausing to examine the territory for signs
of travel.
     An animal had passed through the underbrush three hours ago,
large, approximately one hundred twenty kilograms, hooves with
three divisions, probably a herbivore, the tracks indicated a
foot built for agility or climbing, not clawing or a weapon.
Herbivores could be dangerous, but probably not to as well armed
a party as Flamboyant\'s crew.
     At six hundred meters, Vole flicked on his telescopic vision
from concealment in the grasses.  Two figures in battle dress,
two in combat armor, Imperial model battle dress with League of
suns emblems.  The figures in battle dress were carrying gauss
rifles and one was carrying a large primitive plasma gun:  almost
assuredly a PGMP-12.  The two in combat armor were unarmed, but
laser rifles were nearby.  Three of the reception committee had
their helmets open and appeared to be women.  The fourth, in
combat armor, had the helmet fastened.
     Vole crept closer and began to scan for neural activity.  At
five hundred meters the neural activity sensor picked up the
committee.  A bit weak for four, but there were no other large
life forms in range.
     At three hundred meters Vole could advance no further
without being seen, and he began to circle the Air/Raft to cover
the entire area with his NAS.  It didn\'t take long to discover
the area was clean of ambushers.  It did take a longer time to
resolve the psionic emanations of the Air/Raft crew.  There were
only two sources of neural activity.
          - XXIV -
     The radio sang out as the Gig landed.  "Surgeon Lt. Jones
here, Flamboyant Gig, do ya hove any males aboard?"
     Jietlshaiepr, took the radio confused, "Affirmative, Jones."
     "There\'s a bioagent loose on the planet:  lethal te ninety
two percent o\' human males exposed an\' point six percent o\'
females.  All humans must wear protective clothing.  I hove a
serum which hos so far proven effective, bu\' only as a vaccine.
It doesn\'a cure victims, but can provides inoculation."
     "Thank you for the warning."
     The cargo lift dropped to the ground lowering Kfoks in the
Tilly while Jietlshaiepr and Gresha flew out on their grav belts.
Shtam climbed down the landing ladder.
     Jones stepped up, unarmed, presenting himself and opening
the helmet of his combat armor, and bowed in imitation of Zhodani
fashion.
     "Not bad looking," thought Jietlshaiepr to herself as she
nodded acknowledging him (nobles don\'t bow), "If only he were
Zhodani height..."
     Vole sounded on a private radio circuit, "Watch him, he\'s
psi-shielded."
     "Surgeon Lt. Jones." he said by way of introduction. "Allow
me te welcome ya te Welles."
     Shtam, picking up the role of lieutenant made the
introductions, "Allow me to introduce our exalted captain:  in
your terms the Lt. Dame Jietlshaiepr." the title was redundant,
but it would reinforce Jietlshaiepr as an authority figure.
     "Force leader Taek Kfoks..." he gestured to the huge form of
Kfoks in the tilly.  Kfoks turned the head of the tilly to focus
on Jones as though unintentionally bringing the tilly\'s laser
welder, gauss rifle, RAM auto grenade launcher and fusion gun to
bear on Jones head.
     "First Lt. Gresha..." Gresha nodded to Jones and shouldered
her own fusion gun.
     "And I am Shtam." he bowed, ill concealing the gauss rifle
strapped to his back.
     The private frequency sounded with Shtam\'s voice.  "The two
officers are carrying concealable submachine guns:  those
featureless black boxes on their belts."
     Jones introduced his party.  The woman in combat armor was
Surgeon Ens. Smith who Vole cautioned was also psi-shielded,
while the two League marines in battle dress were Cpl. Delt and
Pvt. Walker.  Walker carried what was definitely a PGMP-12 of
League manufacture.
     "How many humans in yer crew captain?" asked Jones, "I\'ve
got te give ya sufficient vaccine fer ya an\' yer crew."
     "We have five humans aboard." stated Jietlshaiepr.  "I
require an additional dose to examine myself, along with a sample
of the bioagent."
     "Agreed, I thought ya\'d want a sample.  I hove six doses
here yer free to examine.  The virus is possibly type 9 or A
selective:  It reads human genetic material an\' kills unless
certain genes are present.  It\'s usually a race specific disease,
bu\' in this case, it\'s also a sex specific one."
     "What genetic structure does it attack?"
     Jones put on an authoritative air, "Ah, it combines with
skin pigmentation genes on the DNA strand.  Whar certain genes
are present, the DNA\'s modified so that in the normal protein
synthesis process, whar the cell would ordinarily produce
pigment, the cell produces toxic combinations of amino acids.
     "However in women," he continued, "the gene sites appear to
be affected differently:  the toxins created merely result in
sterility."
     "And what type of vaccine have you against this virus?"
sighed Jietlshaiepr trying to sound unimpressed.
     Jones shifted his weight from one foot to the other, "The
serum is a standard one with little modification.  It actually is
a serum we use to correct genetic diseases an\' birth defects by
restructuring the DNA to the normal pattern."
     "WHICH normal pattern?  There are many.  As many as there
are human races."
     "Ah, yea..." stumbled Jones.  "Actually we originally
developed this stuff from work done in the Dynchia Commita, so I
presume it\'s their \'normal\' genetic pattern."
     "So you don\'t mind your children having a mane, fangs and
six fingers:  very liberal of you Lt. Jones."
     Jones laughed, "Ah, my own gametes are in a sperm bank
somewhere back home.  The League wouldn\'a dare lose these hands."
     Ensign Smith interjected, "It should correct defects, not
traits."
     "I would presume that the Dynchia would regard traits such
as having only five fingers defective." observed Jietlshaiepr.
     "I concur." interjected Jones, "But, we\'ve modified it fer
our own uses.  An\' anyway, there\'s a mixture o\' just about every
human race in the League, even Zhodani.  I\'d assume it won\'t
radically change yer crew\'s genetic structure, Cap\'n
Jietlshaiepr.  If that\'s what ya fear, I\'d suggest that ya put
samples of yer own crew\'s gametes in cold storage."
     "I shall have to investigate what genetic structures it does
effect before deciding wither or not to use it.  There probably
are less drastic ways of dealing with this than your serum, but
the availability of such medications is not immediate.
     "What do you know about non humans?  Are any other species
affected by the disease?"
     "Not that we know of."  Commented Smith, "There\'re a few
Aslani an\' Vargr on Welles but they\'ve not been affected.
     "By the way," she continued with one eyebrow raised, "I
couldn\'a help noticing that yer\'re flying an Imperial built Gig,
like one from a Gazelle class close escort..."
     "The Flamboyant is from the Fiery sub-class of the Gazelle."
corrected Kfoks, "Gazelle class escorts are not streamlined, and
can not enter atmospheres."
     "An ex-corsair, captured by my crew." explained
Jietlshaiepr, "Probably from this very same pirate band."
     "Ahh, then you are Not Zhodani navy." observed Smith.  "An\'
Zhodani military wouldn\'t carry Vargr troops either."
     "Not necessarily." she admitted, and changed the subject.
"Lt. Jones, you asked us here for a meeting.  What is it you
wish?"
     "Ah, partly te congratulate you on yer actions an\' escape,
an\' partly to osk yer assistance.  With the Spindleman out o\'
action, there\'s a limit to what we can do here.  Whot exactly is
the situation in orbit?"
     "Star Rider vaporized, taking most of her attack craft with
her.  There are still two SDBs in orbit watching the Flamboyant.
There may yet be a Fanzheinz class trader out there.
     "As for the Spindleman, the last we saw on our instruments
it was heading for a bail out."
     "They\'re alive?"
     "It would seem so, they had partially recovered power.  That
was the last I heard of them.  We presumed you would have
arranged their pick up."
     Jones hit his radio circuit.  "Recon one, go to five
kilometers altitude and scan.  Report any re-entrys or homing
beacons."
     Vole came over the radio, "I can make out a military recon
robot climbing.  Distance:  one point six kilometers."
     "Exactly what is the disposition of the enemy encampment you
mentioned?" asked Jietlshaiepr.
     Corporal Delt stepped forward eyeing the Flamboyant\'s crew
with a degree of distrust.  "Me an\' Walker made a recon sweep out
on the island they hold.  Got in pretty close:  managed ta get a
pretty good look.  They got two four hundred ton fat traders in
camouflage, three \'eavy artillery platforms, two G-carriers, an\'
an Air/Roft.  I guess their strength\'s about a company:  about A
hundred an\' twenty."
     "They appear te be on a slave taking mission." interjected
Jones.  "The population of several small towns hove vanished."
     "I would estimate that the two traders could lift the
company an\' equipment, but not with any cargo of slaves."
     "Yeah," agreed Delt.  "They got a crater fenced off:  looks
like it was blasted wi\' artillery:  prob\'ly where they keep
pris\'ners.  We tried gettin\' in closer bu\' they saw us.  We took
fire, woulda been hit if they\'da used bullets.  They splattered
us wi\' tranq rounds.  We took off an\' our \'bots covered us.  Took
\'em a while ta get anything heavy on us, bu\' they opened up wi\' a
light assault gun an\' that damaged the \'bots some."
     The recon robot came over the radio, "Have found three re-
entry traces and one auto-distress signal."
     Jones looked confused, "Coming from the re-entry?"
     "Negative, out at sea:  bearing:  one hundred four degrees,
range:  seven hundred forty kilometers approximate.  Also picking
up three craft moving to intercept re-entrys and distress signal."
     "Identify craft."
     "Craft moving to intercept re-entry tracks are two G-carriers. 
Craft moving to intercept distress signal is one Air/Raft."
     Jietlshaiepr thought out loud, "We downed about five
SDBs..."
     "Then this\'d be our chance te get a prisoner." concluded
Smith.
          - XXV -
     The plan formed quickly.  Cpl. Delt took the Air/Raft and
recon robot after the freefalling Spindleman\'s crew.  They would
be able to pick up two before the G-carriers got there.  A guard
robot would take care of the third crew member.  Meanwhile, there
was the distress signal to answer...
          - XXVI -
     The Gig raced over the surface of Welles under Shtam\'s
careful piloting.
     Ens. Smith sat tensely as she related Welles culture, "The
planet \'ad a feudal system set up about a hundred years ago when
the free trader Warsaw set down.  They hod jump drive trouble:
they couldn\'a make jump an\' couldn\'a repair it.
     "The Warsaw\'s captain usurped the government in an attempt
te get \'is ship repaired, bu\' the power struggle took a while an\'
when they hod the means to leave they didn\'a want to:  they\'d
conquered the whole bloody planet.
     "Not all Welles nobles accepted the usurper, bu\' the crew
were pretty innovative; managed te take the ship\'s cargo of grav
modules an\' build whot are essentially:  grav powered ironclads.
With air power, the crew managed te make the claim te the throne
stick.  Actually, it\'s not a throne:  the Warsaw\'s now the palace
of the government so it\'s the command chair.  The ship can\'na
take off, bu\' it\'s still operational.  The fusion plant powers
the main city around the starport.
     "The position of captain\'s hereditary.  The current captain:
Captain Billy the Third is\'na able te \'andle the responsibility.
\'e locked himself in the Warsaw until we arrived te avoid the
plague.  Maybe it saved \'is life, but with no government the
whole planet\'s in turmoil:  totally unable to \'andle the slavers.
     "Most of their grav ironclads are out of commission, not
because they\'ve engaged the mercenaries, other than a few minor
skirmishes, bu\' because nearly half their crews are dead from the
bioagent."
     Kfoks cocked his ears, "Is there any organization still
intact among the natives?"
     Smith took a deep breath, "Well, their navy still hos a few
ships operational:  four or five aerial ironclads, no\' counting
what surface ships they have left.  They lost most or all o\'
their dirigibles an\' surface ships when the crews caught the
plague:  just couldn\'a handle the ship when bad weather caught
\'em.  The ironclads had the speed to make it back te base before
the crews died.
     "They\'ve got one large aerial ironclad an\' several smaller
ones.  Their admiral\'s kept their flagship going by transferring
crews:  the Pasadena. I tell you, they\'re the weirdest looking
things I\'ve ever seen:  grav technology with steam engine
propellers and cannons."
     Kfoks regarded her closely, "What\'s the population of this
planet?"
     Smith took a deep breath and closed her eyes, "Two months
ago, it were seven million, eight hundred thousand people."
images of the last two weeks of death passed over her face.  "We
estimate... three an\' a half million dead."

A great idea, but wouldn\'t an atmosphere cause problems with this sort
of stuff (i.e. shots from orbits for assassination)?? But does that mean then
that the range of a Laser Rifle is increased on Vaccuum worlds since it doesn\'t
have any resistance because of atmosphere (what about dense worlds??) Any
comments from the Physics majors out there on the mechanics of laser/bullet
fire in other than normal (i.e. earth-like conditions??) I mean, when
you think of it, when your using a shotgun in a dense atmosphere, wouldn\'t
the range be shorter??? Is this thought of in the game mechanics? I don\'t 
think so..........

I agree with Scott here for sure... the Imp. Encyclopedia SUCKS for typo\'s/
errors.... too many beers that night for whoever did them. BTW, Scott, did
anyone ever think of writing a hypercard stack for keeping those designs?
(or do you have one??) A friend of mine recently pulled some of the designs 
off the net and thought it would be cool to put them (with a picture of
course) onto a Hypercard Stack. He has been thinking of doing it, but
alas, a new girlfriend is taking away his Hypercard programming time.
Anyone have anything like this???

        Well, back in February there was a discussion on Striker, 
and one of the things that came up was exactly that, I believe.  
Lemme go check. . .
      Here it is:
 
 
Bertil writes:
  I checked the Fire Control difficulties table in MegaT, and it revealed
an interesting thing: Even at hight TLs it isn\'t easy to hit a target at 
5 to 50km range and close to impossible at 50-500km. If we accept
this, and factor in the movement DMs, it will be very hard for the navy to 
hit a Gravtank at all. One could make a case for the tank being treated as a
fighter, but it would have to be above the ground clutter for that, so 
the threat of an orbital navy against NOE tanks is not that high.

Well, I have a small problem in that I have a character who is much better
at fleet and ship tactics than I will ever be.  My character has also survived
to achieve flag rank in the Navy, which means suddenly I have to worry about
ships and fleets and such!  I need help!

So here\'s a question for all you fleet tactics types (of which I\'m not).
If you had your choice of two squadrons to try to combat the vargr corsairs 
moving into the Domain of Deneb, what sort of squadrons would you pick and why?

It\'s safe to assume that the vargr ship profiles listed in the rebellion book
are typical of what the Navy types in this little fleet would be up against
(well, that\'s what my friendly local GM is taking as a default for corsair
fleets).

It looks like my character is going to get a choice of anything, so long as
it doesn\'t exceed two squadrons worth of ships.  I\'m open to what all you
ship tactics experts think. Really, indulge yourselves.  I\'m literally all
ears here.

Um, wouldn\'t there be a problem firing through an atmosphere, as in laser
dispersion? Light from the stars *is* dispersed when it comes though the 
atmosphere -- that\'s a big part of the reason to have an orbital telescope.
Granted, a 100MW laser won\'t get hurt much, but at a 100* km range, a 0.001 
degree error would result in a miss by 1.75 meters.

Also, a ship loitering around in low orbit would get attention paid to it.
That\'s what orbital defense satellites with mondo armor and space weapons
are meant to deal with...

Nope, actually they travel a lot slower.  The accepted terminal
velocity for a falling human body is around 120 MPH (200 kph).
I asked a friend of mine who dives (sky *and* SCUBA) and he says
that with normal jump suits (which are deliberately loose and floppy
to retard rate of descent) the average velocity for a jumper is more
like 90 MPH (the idea being that you get to stay in the air longer
if you fall slower).

The worlds record for the highest parachute jump was set on August
16th, 1960, but Capt. Joseph Kittinger Jr. USAF, when he said, "Lord,
take care of me now." and stepped out of a pressurized, high-altitude
balloon suspended gondola at an altitude of 102,800 ft. over White
Sands Missile Range near Alamogordo, New Mexico.  The total length of
the jump, from bail-out to touchdown was 13 minutes and 45 seconds.
Kittinger freefell from 102,800 ft. down to 96,000 ft., at which point
he deployed a 6 ft. stabilization \'chute to keep from tumbling.  The
atmosphere is so thin at that altitude that he continued to accelerate
for another 6,000 ft. before hitting a peak velocity of 614 MPH, which
is 90 percent the speed of sound at that altitude (90,000 ft.), and
is 83 percent the speed of sound at sea level.  At 17,500 ft., 4 minutes
and 38 seconds after he began the jump, he deployed his main canopy and
floated to the ground.

To the best of my knowledge, this record stands today.  No skydiver in
history has broken the sound barrier in freefall.

Atmosphere *does* screw up long laser shots, as evidenced by the results
of the SDI MIRCL (Midrange InfraRed Chemical Laser) tests in the early 80\'s.
Even at a range of < 20 miles, there was significant beam diffusion and
energy loss.  In addition to airborne crud (dust, pollen, bugs, ultra-
light pilots, etc.) which block and scatter the beam, there is the problem
of the clear atmosphere itself.  Under the stimulation of a high-energy
laser, the air in the path of the beam heats to an energized plasma state,
which then presents the same sort of problems as airborne particles.  The
main problem is defocusing of the beam (the assumption being that a large
enough power source can pump a laser beam of such high energy that any
energy loss in transit will still leave enough punch to toast the target
at the other end).  Current ground-based laser research is attempting to
overcome this beam diffusion by using computer-controlled variable geometry
mirrors.  As the beam is diffused in the atmosphere, that beam scatter is
automatically measured by the computer and the mirror\'s geometry is modified
to correct for the diffusion.  Success so far has been only moderate,
according to de-classified documents on the research.  (FYI, Tom Clancy
covers this subject a fair amount, in layman\'s terms, in his novel
_A_Cardinal_in_the_Kremlin_.)

It probably does affect thh range , but unless that atmosphere has the
consistency of Campbell\'s Cream of Potato soup, and you are firing at
a target at long range++, it shouldn\'t make any difference.

	We also need to come up with a power-speed table that makes sense. 
When your wet-navy rules allow you to build ships that can pull 30Kts
for 5000nm with smaller power plants than real world ships use to reach
20Kts, something is wrong.
	Useful clue:  speed is proportional to cube root of power.

Your GM may be in for something of a shock.

	My recommendation:  Use my Norway/Sikkintar combination.  It should
be on the list sometime last year.  If you can\'t find it, I\'ll send it
to you.  This is just one battleship plus its four riders, but it will
be able to defeat ANY number of the Vargr ships from Rebellion
Sourcebook, without taking a single hit.  Which is why I would use it.

	Alternate recommendation:  Cynthia posted a "Sylea" class heavy
fighter here last year.  Any fighter carrier carrying more than 30 of
them can defeat ANY combination of Vargr.

	As long as you GM will let you have two squadrons, you can go for
overkill:  A Squadron of Norway class ships is four Norways (with their
sixteen Sikkintars), plus eight escorts (presumably P.F. Sloan class).
Add in a squadron of Admiral class light carriers, which is 5 Admirals,
plus their 200 "Syleas".  (The Admiral class has yet to be posted, since
we haven\'t bothered to convert it to MT rules yet - if you want it, ask)

	Any of these three choices (a single Norway, a single carrier w/
Syleas, or two squadrons worth) will be able to defeat all the Vargr in
the Marches, if (a) the Vargr are using that dreck from Rebellion
Sourcebook, and (b) the Vargr are STUPID enough to stick around and
fight.  After a few fights, the Vargr should run like rabbits whenever
you appear.
	It is going to shock your GM if you use one of these
recommendations, because he/she will quickly find that the Vargr
Incursion is the largest non-problem in history.  You can get yourself a
pile of medals, the Vargr can be driven back to their kennels, and the
course of Imperial history will change for the better.  

	On this note, Cynthia and I are going to put together some Vargr
ships that are worth the money it cost to build them, as soon as we
determine what TL the "average" Vargr ship should be.  I\'ll bet it isn\'t
eleven!

My mistake.  Kittinger\'s capsule was *not* pressurized.  It was an
open gondola, loaded with cameras and measurement instruments.  Kittinger
had only his pressure suit to protect himself from the high altitude.

nerds (sounds like a bad B movie...), you can skip this post.

> Terminal velocity is the speed at which the drag of falling through
> the air exactly balances the force of gravity pulling you down.  

The resistance of air to the motion of bodies in free fall depends on
a lot of different stuff - for example: the size of the body, its
shape, its density, the temperature of the air, the density of the
atmosphere with respect to height, the velocity of the body through
the resisting medium...

Lots of variables...I\'d worry about them only if I had the leisure to
set up the numerical analysis.  Here\'s a useful approximation instead -
I confess, one straight out of Halliday and Resnick...  ;-)

     the resisting force of air is proportional to the velocity
     of the falling body (and is, of course, acting in the opposite
     direction of the falling body, ie upwards)

Making this approximation gets us right to an expression for terminal
velocity that\'s approximately correct:

                         k Vt = mg   _or_   Vt = (mg)/k

     where Vt is terminal velocity, mg is the mass of the object times
     the gravitational constant, and k is some proportionality constant

>> ...but sometime back in the 50\'s-60\'s they were experimenting with
>> high altitude ejection

Now as distance from the surface of the earth ingreases, the density
of the atmosphere thins (which will decrease the value of k).  But the
value of g also decreases with height.  Close to the surface of the
earth (less than 10000 ft (3000 m) smells like a good approximation to
me), you could probably happily assume that both g and k were
constant, and your rule of thumb would be ok.  So far, so good...

However, I believe the heights to which Scott was referring were
vastly in excess of 10000 ft - more along the lines of greater than
50000 ft.  At those heights, g is less and so is k.  k however is
dependent on more than just density, it\'s dependent on temperature,
and on the variation of density with height (which is NOT linear!
because the elemental/molecular composition of the atmosphere changes
with height also).  Anyway, k will decrease faster than g, with the
result that Vt is greater at higher altitudes.  Scott\'s very high
altitude parachutist could easily have been doing quite a klip
there...

Did the parachutist who set the record really exceed the speed of
sound?  I don\'t know myself.  Let\'s look at the physics real fast: the
speed of sound in a gas can be expressed as - 
     ____________________________ 
v =\\/(a const)(pressure)/density)

so we\'re looking at the ratio, really, between pressure (which will
decrease with height) and density (which will also decrease with
height).  Which one decreases faster?  I haven\'t a clue! :-(  Anyone
out there with a good aero-engineering handbook?  :-)  A good text on
planetary science (believe it or not, that\'s where I learned most of
this atmosphere stuff) would have also all this stuff in there.

You know, ever since I discovered Traveller, I\'ve been kicking myself
for having tossed my planetary science notes from grad school.  :-(
There have been so many times that I\'ve wanted to reread them since I
started playing this fool game...

I think it is possible, perhaps, that you have confused velocity and
force?  The force that a grav belt would put out would have to be
variable.  Otherwise, there would be no control on velocity!  Recall
that force is (mass x acceleration).  If the force is always constant,
then there would always be constant acceleration and ever increasing
speed (assuming, of course, that the grav belt force exceeds g...). I
think you must have misstated yourself :-) because to achieve a
constant velocity, you must accelerate (ie you must use a force
greater than the forces opposing you, which in this case are drag and
gravity) and then having achieved your desired velocity, the force
then must decrease to match the opposing forces such that the desired
velocity is maintained.

I myself have always ignored the limitations on grav belts - what sane
person would want to go that lethally fast anyway?  ;-) (This from a
woman who\'s been riding motorcycles for 10 years...)  If you can have
a grav belt which MUST exert a force greater than the sum of gravity
and drag, then depending on how heavy the mass in the grav belt is,
you can go as fast as you are patient enough to accelerate to...  How
fast you can accelerate, however, is an entirely different matter!
;-) On the other hand, there\'s nothing that says there aren\'t either
speed limits (*gasp* no, not SPEED LIMTS!!!) or speed governers in the
grav belts themselves.

Anyway, that\'s enough for one evening\'s worth of nerd attack.  Having
stuck my neck out, I\'ll cheerfully invite correction for any of the
REAL physicists out there...  ;-)

        Recently I posted a question to the TML.  I didn\'t receive 
an answer, and it seems like a rather simple question.  I asked:
 
How does a character who already has a skill gain an AT in that 
skill through experience only?
 
        There are 280 people on this list.  All of them play 
Traveller.  Someone has to know the answer to this!  Please read 
page 41-42 in the Players Handbook, specifically the passages where 
it says:
 
        . . . if the character succeeds, he receives a temporary 
skill level-0 for use in the next task attempt with this skill (and 
then loses the skill level-0)
 
and
 
        If the character already has the pertinent skill, success 
increases the skill one level.
 
        Two of my players and I have puzzled over this and we can\'t 
find an answer.
 
        Also, is this the correct process for gaining an AT for an 
unskilled character?  1) observe (task of Diff, Determination).  If 
successful, gain skill observed skill at level-0.  2) Try out skill 
at level-0.  If successful, gain an AT in that skill.  3) Once you 
think you have sufficient AT\'s for a skill, succeed in (Formidable, 
AT, Int) to gain that skill at level 1.

I can believe that hitting things from orbit is difficult when you\'er chucking
things that don\'t correct their own aim.  A \'smart\' missile should be able to
hit just about anything it desires.  Okay, if the target is capable of
evasive action then it might miss and it is possible to shoot down a missile
with point defence weapons but if a single person is the target, I don\'t see
too many problems hitting them.  They don\'t exactly move very quickly, and you
don\'t have to score a direct hit to kill them (especially with a decent sized
tac-nuke :-).  I don\'t think current missile technology is up to the task, but
by TL12 or 15 it should be.  Can it really be that difficult to design a small
missile with a decent robot brain????

Well, yes, but what I said was correct...Vt _is_ the speed at which drag

True, I did make a mistatement there.  It should have been a variable force,
but with some arbitrary maximum (whether physics imposed or manufacturer
imposed).  I think of it like a car...if you depress the gas pedal half way,
you will accelerate to the point where the new forces of friction and drag
balances the new _x_ output of the engine (where x is power, work, force or
whatever is appropriate, I\'m kind of fuzzy on that, it\'s been about seven years
since my last physics course dealing with those concepts).

Probably either speed governors or powerplants small enough such that you

Ah, but you just got through telling us that *drag is velocity
dependent*!  So clearly the prior poster *meant* constant
*maximum horizontal force* exertable by the grav belt.  Assume
for example that at most the grav belt can put out a constant
force which will accelerate the wearer horizontally from a
standing start at 1G.  Will the wearer keep accelerating
indefinitely?  No, the wearer will stop accelerating when the
reach *exactly terminal V*.  With twice as much force, one can
go somewhat faster, but not quite twice as fast, since drag is
actually nonlinear.  However if you use the H&R approximation
you quoted, then a grav belt with twice the force will achieve
twice the max V of our example grav belt above.

Me, I think I\'ll stick to walking -- heights make me giddy.

I recentlypurchased some used Trav material, and I wondered if anyone could
offer comments on whether any of the stuff is good for anything.

I\'ve read through all of them but one, and most of it seems to make sense.

Supplement 9: Fighting Ships

	According to the introduction, most of the ships in this book
	were designed using Book 5 \'High Guard\'.  I have never seen
	High Guard, and so, the High Guard stats are meaningless to me.

	Is this book still useful for someone struggling to learn
	Classic Trav?

Double Adventure 6: Night of Conquest/Divine Intervention

	Has anyone played either of these?  What are they like?
	Challenging, easy, suitable or not for beginners?

Fasa\'s Rescue on Galatea

	Same questions as for Dble Advent 6

MegaTraveller Starship Operator\'s Manual, Vol. 1

	Because the list has expressed so much grief over ship design
	in MegaTrav, I wonder if this book is useful for anything?

	Is there erata available for it?  Was there ever a Vol.2, and
	how necessary is it, to complete Vol. 1?

DGP\'s Grand Census

	I have yet to finish reading this one.  Seems to be pretty light
	and inconsequential stuff.  Is this book strictly for the
	\'Let\'s invent some new aliens\' crowd?

And finally, something from \'Seeker\', called Merchant Class Ships, Vol. 1.

	The booklet says for use with Space Opera, but on some promo literature
	inside, it says also for use with Traveller.  However, no Trav stats
	are given for the ships.

	It would probably be a straight forward enough conversion, as there
	are floorplans for three ship designs; the Banner Class, Voyager Class,
	and the Zephyr Class.

	Has anyone used \'Seeker\' products before?

Any and all comments are welcome, through e-mail, or if you feel it\'s required,
through the list.  I can summarize for the list, if anyone is interested.

}The accepted terminal velocity for a falling human body is

While high drag jump suits allow lower speeds. (90Mph)

Hmm... those figures still seem fairly close.  What do you mean
by \'accelted terminal velocity\'?  Is that a person wearing a
streamlined suit in a tucked down position?  If it is, then I
can see the 200kph speed being relevant for grav belt travel.
After all, a person in a grav belt is trying to travel as fast
as possible, and a parachutist is trying to travel as slowly as
possible.  (To allow for better aim, and safety)

The documentary I was referring to was an interview with the
guy Mark spoke of however (Capt. Kittinger)  In the interview he
claimed that he had indeed gone supersonic.  Now, Mark\'s source
of data sounds much more precise than the rather sensationalistic
documentary I saw, but I find the discrepancy rather disturbing. 
After all, there was the guy telling how he went supersonic,
without an aircraft.  Now, Mark sez he only hit Mach 0.9.  :-(

However, Mark does say that at his highest velocity, he did have
a 6 foot drag \'shute out which may have kept him from actually
hitting Mach 1.  Thus, it seems to me that it could indeed be
*theoretically* possible for a person in a grav belt (and a thin
atmosphere) to actually go supersonic.

Catie:
Drag is a non linear function as the velocity of travel
approaches the speed of sound.  I\'m no aerodynamics jock, but if
I recall, the non-linear terms build up around the speed of sound
and then drop off.  The function is discontinuous at the speed of
sound.

Thus, you need a certain amount of thrust to get to the speed of
sound and then once beyond it, less thrust is needed to maintain
speed.

Halliday and Resnick are dealing with nice sophomore physics
students who don\'t have to worry about supersonic stuff.  :-)

}(the assumption being that a large enough power source can pump

}diffusion.  Success so far has been only moderate, according to

Now, these tests are made with today\'s laser technology.  That
being lasers which go from infrared to ultraviolet.  The
atmosphere of the earth is notably transparent in the visible
range and becomes more optically thick the farther out you get
from that range (which is one of the reasons why we evolved to
see in what you and I call the \'visible\' range.)

However, Traveller TL 13+ lasers are X-rays.  I do not know
exactly how transparent the atmosphere is in that range, but I
would say that if the human body is transparent to X-rays, the
atmosphere dang well outta be too.  Thus, much less energy will
be lost to the atmosphere than in IR to UV lasers.  Less energy
loss, the less the atmosphere will heat, therefore less beam
diffraction.

Also, when we are dealing with beams of ***250 MEGAwatts*** I
still think yer gonna give somebody an AWFUL sunburn...  Even
*with* Sunblock 50 million!  :-)  Heck!  Even the beam scattering
from a 250MW laser on the ground is gonna be lethal.  Think about
it:  A 250MW laser would *REALLY* light up a room...  You wear
goggles to protect your eyes from lasers of less than half a
watt.  And a 0.095milliwatt laser can damage your eye if you
stare at it.  You miss by a few meters and nobody will notice.

Yup.  That\'s essentially the case.  When a skydiver goes for max. rate
of descent, they fold their hands flat against their sides (hips), spread
their legs at approximately 20-30 degrees (for stabilization), and arch
their backs and necks (basically facing into the wind).  This will offer
a head-downward angle of attack while presenting the smallest cross-section
of resistance.  I\'m sure everybody has seen it before in the movies.

I can think of a number of arbitrary (that is, not required by physical
limits) reasons for the 300 khp limit.  Unaided respiration becomes very
difficult at those speeds.  Windburn (or actual heating) might start to
be a factor.  And then there\'s the "better aim and safety" that you mention.
Granted, none of these reasons present insurmountable obstacles.  A vacc-
suit with a really hot sensor suite would eliminate all those excuses. :^)

Regarding Capt. Kittinger and his high-altitude jump:

Maybe so.  In fact, maybe he *did* go supersonic at a somewhat lower
altitude.  If you check the Speed-of-Sound vs. Altitude graph in the
CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (pg. F-169 in the 51st edition),
you\'ll find that the speed of sound is all over the spectrum depending
on your altitude.  Kittinger jumped at 102,800 ft., where the speed of
sound is about 307 m/sec. (or about 690 mph).  At around 82,500 ft.,
the speed of sound drops down to about 295 m/sec. (or approximately
664 mph.

Hmmm.  Well, according to those numbers, and my earlier research on
Kittinger\'s jump, he still didn\'t break the sound barrier, since his
documented top speed was 614 mph, which translates to about 273 m/sec.
According to the CRC, the speed of sound bottoms out at around 282
m/sec., at altitudes above 75 kilometers.

There\'s just too much good stuff in yesterday\'s mail to pass up.  Think
I comment on just about everyone\'s message at least once.  :=)

First:  James--when does the tml address change officially?  And what to?
(Or do you not yet know?)


Second, Dale Poole asks for our comments on some products.

High Guard is one of the better Traveller products.  The ships it
produces are at least halfway consistent.  Takes a little while to
figure out their system, though.


:Double Adventure 6: Night of Conquest/Divine Intervention
:	Has anyone played either of these?  What are they like?
:	Challenging, easy, suitable or not for beginners?

You can handle Divine Intervention.  It\'s pretty easy (if it\'s the one
I\'m thinking of) and has few major characters.  Just modify the premise
and set up a little to fit your campaign.


Third: A WHOLE BUNCH of terminal velocity stuff was discovered by the
victimizer, exegisis....

[Did he or did he not go supersonic.]
Well he certainly exceed the speed of sound on Mars.  :=)
He did go bloody fast.  In fact, (the urban legend style of history
that I remember says) he probably did not want to deply the drogue,
but realized he was starting to tumble, and that it would quickly
kill him if he didn\'t stop it.

Makes sense to me.  The human body is not terribly stable in air,
and at around .7M and up we should start to see the results of
compression of the airflow around parts of the body.  That is, for
instance the shoulder will produce more lift than the foot, for a
while, etc.

Me, Id\' hate to experience the transonic region, with sock wave,
compressed flow, turbulence, and induced flutter, without the aid
of some titanium betweem me and the air.  :=)

[Whither 300 kph (200 mph)?]
I suspect its a power/fuel tradeoff.
In TL8 light aircraft, we can get about 200kph cruise on about 100HP
engine.  To get 300 kph, the smallest engines you\'ll find doing it
are in the 230HP to 250HP range.  Typical (TL7, granted) designs run
up into the 400HP range to get this kind of speed.  Drink a lot of
gasoline, too.  I suspect it has to do with where the knee of the
curve is for resistince in air that is about the same density as
earth\'s.

Oh -- drag coefficient for a TL8 airfram is typically in the area of
0.02 or so.  A raw human body is in the area of 0.4.  Nasty stuff for
both speeds we\'re discussing.



Third:  Orbital Lasers and Executive Action

Scott says:
:Well, when you have a camera in orbit capable of resolving 10cm
:objects on the surface, it\'s easy enough to correct fire.

Getting this resolution would be a nighmare, Scott, if you\'re actually
in orbit.  Theoretical resolution limits at your chosen wavelength.
You\'d have to set up a synthetic aperture arrangement with three
(well two, but three would be better) or more ships.  What DOD
stellites do is dip into the atmosphere close to the target, get
higher later.  I *think* it\'s on the order of 1/2pi*w where w is
wavelength.

As for atmospheric scattering, see "Rayleigh Criterion".  It\'s on
the order of 1/w^4, where w is wavelength.  X-rays won\'t cut it.
microwave or infrared is the best way to go.

Also, check into adaptive and active optics.  Dynamically playing
with the shapes of mirrors to counteract atmopheric problems.

Gotta run.

Having made quite a few craft designs, and then looking at the
problem of grav belts from that perspective, I\'d have to guess
that the 300kph limit for speed has more to do with the drag
and structural integrety than the max force of output of the
belt.

MegaTrav puts an upperlimit of 300kph on all craft that are
considered \'unstreamlined\'.  A streamlined craft has an upper
limit of 1000kph, and an airframe craft has an upper limit of
4200kph (or 5000 in COACC).  That is my opinion on why the
limit is set where it is.  However, we have seen from the
high altitude parachute jump that higher speeds are possible.
(In a thinner atmosphere).  This is the source of my confusion.

However, Grav belts are probably not designed to be a FAST mode
of transportation.  It is much cheaper to design a grav vehicle
that is faster than a grav belt.  So, for the most part the
belt will be operating at lower altitudes where 300 kph is
indeed reasonable.

Mark pointed out the problems of windburn and the difficulty in
breathing.  Well, IMO, anyone who is out there trying to travel
at the speeds we\'re talking about is gonna be in some sort of
protective clothing, like a biker.  A helmet will certainly be
needed.  I would imagine that a helmet would provide enough of
a windbreak that breathing would be normal.  Witness the formula
1 racers at the Indy 500.  Cars there are open topped and travel
at 200mph (320kph) and the driver has no special breathing gear.
Admittedly, he\'s got a small windshield as a windbreak, but I
still think the helmet would prove effective.  And if helmet
configurations that you and I are familiar with wouldn\'t do the
job, a helmet could be designed for the purpose.  After all,
there just isn\'t a market for grav belt helmets here on Earth is
there?  :-)

Most of the published vehicle designs (especially those from GDW) are grossly
in error, incorrect, or simply terribly inefficient.  The ones in the
Imperial Encyclopedia and Fighting Ships are some of the worst offenders.
Check out the TML vehicle design archives, and you will find a number much
more suitable ships.  Or design your own.  If you find any errors in my
designs, let me know, and I\'ll explain myself or post a corrected design.

No such thing as a stupid question.  Traveller:2300 was revised to become
2300AD; and is still in print.  I don\'t know many people who play it, but it
does have a following.  Check out a recent issue of Challenge; there is at
least one 2300AD fanzine available; this would be a good source of new ideas,
adventures, and vehicles for you.

AU is the Astronomic Unit, the mean distance from the Earth to the Sun.
This is a convenient yardstick for measuring things that are much too
large to be measured in meters, and much too small to be measured in
light-years.

> 2: What are some of you seasoned players opinions on Traveller 2300AD?
I thought it was an interesting concept, and had potential.  Unfortunately, I
can\'t afford the time, energy, or money to "follow" two major game systems at
once, so I pay less attention to 2300AD than to Traveller/MegaTraveller.
Part of the reason is that I bought Traveller:2300 hoping that it would be a
Traveller-compatible game (about the early Terran Confederation and the Rule
of Man), the dissapointment helped to sour me on the game.  I never felt like
buying it a second time to get the updated rules when it became 2300AD.  I
got Star Cruiser (2300AD ship-to-ship combat and ship construction rules),
but that was about it.  At least at my local game stores, much 2300AD stuff
(suppliments and adventures) are still available.

Well, it really *IS* in the book, but not where you are looking.  I don\'t
have my books with me now (I\'m at work), but it is there.  You are looking at
the rules for learning a new skill; there are also rules for character
advancement elsewhere in the book.  The following is from memory, so someone
correct me if I\'m wrong: At the end of each gaming session, the Referee
awards ATs to the players.  The Ref may specify which skill the AT is to be
used on ("That was some great role-playing you did in the bar scene, so take
an AT on your Carousing skill", or "You did a lot of tricky flying today, so
take an AT in Pilot").  Or, the Ref may allow the player to choose any skill
that was used during the session (as in "Mission Accomplished; everybody take
an AT").

Personally, I award one AT to each player at the end of each session; and
another AT each session to one player for "best role-playing" (as determined
by the players, I break ties as needed), also each session.  These ATs may be
applied to any skill of the player\'s choice, except that it must be a skill
that the player used at least once during the session.  I also award one AT,
my choice of skill, to each player at the end of each "adventure" or other
logical break in the action.  Thus, players get one (sometimes two) ATs per
session, plus one AT per "adventure" played. This means that players who show
up regularly and contribute get rewarded.

Sounds good to me.  I\'d take a squadron of my "Frigate" designs, and a
squadron of assault ships (pick from Scott Kellogg and Robert Dean designs).
The frigates designs were posted to the list a number of months ago, and
should be in the archives somewhere (if not, mail me and I\'ll send them to
you).

The frigates were specifically designed to be able to outfight anything they
couldn\'t outrun (does maneuver-6, agility-6, computer-9, spinal meson gun,
and a full set of screens sound?).  A squadron of these, with escorts (I
posted an escort design with them) and supply ships should do quite well
agains any design GDW has published.  There are only two drawbacks to the
design: one is that they have relatively low jump performance, and the other
is that the amount of sustained combat they can put up is limited by
available fuel (I use combat booster power plants to acheieve the required
performance, and the booster fuel is limited to a few days).  The frigates
should be able to handle anything the Vargr can throw at them in the way of
fleet action with minimal losses.  The use of booster power plants for combat
*IS* official, as per a MegaTraveller Q&A column of quite a while ago.

Presumably you would also want a squadron of assualt craft (assault carriers,
troopships, and landing craft), so that you can capture and hold planets,
bases, and the like.  Check the design archives for suitable ships; I haven\'t
designed any.  If the carriers also had attack fighters, they can defend
themselves and the rest of the squadron (Scott Kellogg has a COACC design
which should make mincemeat of just about any threat; however, it is not
quite an official design).

A frigate squadron (frigron?) would be 4 to 6 frigates, with 6 to 8 escorts
of mixed types (destroyers, destroyer-escorts, and fleet escorts).  Choose
escorts whose characteristics match the frigates (maneuver and agility are
important here).  Enough tankers should be attached to be able to jump once
and then refuel the frigates and escorts for another jump.  Supply ships (or
use dromedaries instead of tankers) should also be attached for long
missions.  Remember that the frigates advantages include high maneuver speed;
keep the tankers and supply ships out of the fight (leaving them in a
location in deep space is good) so that the frigates don\'t loose the ability
to break off by accelleration (their short jump performance and limited fuel
supply limits their ability to break off by jumping; however, with careful
fuel management, it is possible).  Another good trick is to carry plenty of
drop tanks with the supplies, so that the frigates can perform a maximum
jump, and arrive with a full load of fuel.

The assault squadron (I won\'t touch the contraction, sorry) would be 3 to 5
carriers and a like number of troopships, with 6 to 8 escorts.  Again the
escorts performance should match or exceed the other ships in the squadron.

Finally, the vargr are probably the second most over-rated non-problem to the
Domain; an organized, concerted effort should cut through the vargr like a
hot knife through butter.  Also remember that vargr psychology will tend to
produce up-and-coming officers who don\'t mind slitting their captain\'s throat
and joining the other side as soon as it looks like the other side is going
to win.  This does not apply as much to vargr fighting humans, but it has
been known to happen.  Just remember that you are dealing with vargr, and
appeal to their primary motivations.

In case you are wondering, the most over-rated non-problem to the Domain is
the Aslan.  The aslan males want land; the aslan females want someone to
trade with.  Taking worlds by force will not solve the problem (it will make
holding on to the land a constant struggle, and will tend to make potential
trading partners into enemies).  Aslan settlers want worlds where they will
be able to live in relative peace and prosperity.  No matter where they
settle, the will improve the economy of the domain.  The only problem remains
to figure out where to put them, and how to convince them to go there.  There
are plenty of depopulated worlds in the domain, either because they are
underdeveloped, or because they have suffered at the hands of the vargr.

The vargr want plunder and glory, not land or trade.  As the areas they have
conquered become poorer, and as infighting splits the corsairs apart, they
are less and less likely to hold on to what they have captured.  The thing to
do is to offer the aslan large areas of land on vargr-occupied worlds, IF the
aslan will evict the vargr.  Add some trade concessions and military support
(to sweeten the deal for the aslan females and males, respectively) and the
aslan should go for it (think about it: settle here and we will help you and
trade with you, or settle anywhere else and we will fight you).  Just
remember that you are dealing with aslan, and appeal to their primary
motivations.

Recommendation 1: Get High Guard.
Commentary: I believe that an explanation of the High Guard data format
appears at the end (beginning?) of the book.  Suffice it to say that the
numbers are performance stats for the ship and its weapons.  As far as
a role-playing suppliment goes, Fighting Ships is "deep background" unless
you are playing a Navy campaign (in which case Book 5, High Guard, is a
necessity), player characters will only have passing encounters with most
of the ships shown in the book.  You can use these ships as "throw-away"
descriptions, or as obstacles, or as backgrounds.

I have inflicted "Divine Intervention" on a group of player characters.  The
adventure is a neat idea, and the difficulty level depends more on the
referee than anything else.  I tend to ad-lib quite a lot around the central
theme of the adventure, and so introduce or brush aside obstacles so that the
players are challenged but not overwhelmed.  Maybe suitable for beginners,
depending on their age, experience with other games, and other intangibles.

There are no errata available, and there is no volume two (at one time there
were plans for a volume two, but DGP is undergoing some strangeness at
present).  The volume is complete as it stands.  The book is background
material and technical fluff, and could apply to Classic Traveller just as
well as to MegaTraveller.  The majority of the text is techno-babble about
fictious starship systems, and can be read by the players as well as the
referee.  It should give everyone lots of ideas about ways to abuse the
technology.  I like it, but the book is fundamentally irrellevant.

Grand Census (together with Grand Survey) provide some ideas for detailing
worlds and the races that inhabit them.  If you need some ideas for working
up a very complete world description, the book is quite good.  I personally
consider Grand Census to be less fluff than the Starship Operator\'s Manual.
If you can make reams and reams of this stuff up out of your head, then you
don\'t need the book.  I can\'t, so I find the tables usefull for generating
races and societies.  The MegaTraveller World Builder\'s Handbook is the
combined MegaTraveller equivalent of Grand Survey and Grand Census.

Nope, bad analogy, bro\'. The atmospheric rolloff is on both sides
of the visible range, and is orders of magnitude down from its
maximum by the time you get through the ultraviolet. They call it
the "optical window" for a reason, and they have to launch X-ray
and gamma observatories on orbiting satellites for the same reason.

Nope again. You get a lot of burnoff from laser beams going through
crud like air and so on, and the release of heat on impact is ordinary
incoherent scattered light. You wear goggles to prevent accidental
coherent light impact, not scatter (although laser speckle can do
interesting things to your retinas if you stare at it for a long time).
The inverse-square law for a point source of 250MW of heat energy can
be worked out; you get a surprisingly small danger space in terms of
watts per square meter.

I would say that orbital lasers are most handy when you\'re dealing with
very thin or trace atmospheres, which are common in the Imperium. Above
"thin," though, you can forget it.

REFERENCE: J.D.Jackson\'s "Classical Electrodynamics," the book that
turns most young people off of grad school in physics.

In all fairness, when Mark Cook sez:
>consider how much X-ray energy the sun generates.  We\'d all be toast!),

He is also incorrect. The Sun is not a very efficient X-ray emitter;
its radiation curve peaks in the visible range. You want X-rays, you
need an O or B star, or a large A star. By the time you get down to the
F and G stars, you\'re peaking in the UV, visible, and IR ranges.

With regards to AT\'s in traveller. Yes I believe that you are doing the
no skill correctly. At least I do it the following way:

Difficult uncertain (Skill [of Instructer], Int) to get a temporary
level-0 in the skill. If the character succeeds in the skill in a
non-trivial manner, then they can get an AT for the skill. (Note that
I don\'t allow people to keep the temporary level-0 until the next use
if that happens to be more than several weeks/months away.)

As for granting of AT\'s. (Without reading the rules) I usually give out
one AT per session, the character can choose, subject to my approval,
some skill that they used succesfully and enhanced the good of the
group. (Remeber that the AT\'s have to be dated, as one can only get
2 AT\'s for a particular skill per game-year).
At the beginning of every game session I allow the players to make
one attempt to develop a level in a skill. (Difficult AT, int I believe).

As a non-standard rule I also allow characters to develop stats in
a similar way. i.e. get AT\'s towards improving a stat, however I make them
decide that they want to try to improve a specific stat at the beginning
of the session, if they don\'t get an oppurtuninty to use the stat
constructively, then they don\'t get an AT for that session. I have
also toyed with making it harder to get higher stats, ie a stat of
1-4 requires 1 success to raise 5-9, 2 successes, 10-14 3 successes.

Now as AT is a two letter word with a in it....

Just a few notes on transonic drag.

The phenomena of a sonic boom (and supersonic drag) is similar to
that of a wake of a ship.

The ship is travelling faster than the speed of waves on the surface of
the water.  As the ship moves along, a shockwave forms.  The wake trails
out from the bow of the ship and as the wake travels past an observer,
that observer would \'hear\' the wake.  (detect the waves as they pass by)

Now, as you may notice, the water behind a ship, inside the barriers of
the wake, is much less turbulent than either the wake itself or the water
around it.  Supersonic and hypersonic airframes take advantage of this by
projecting a nose cone of the aircraft forward.  The \'wake\' or shockwave
forms (a cone in this 3D case) around the nose while the rest of the
aircraft falls inside the cone of the shockwave.  Thus the wings and tail
are *NOT* subjected to supersonic airflow even when the aircraft is
travelling supersonic.

The transonic drag that forms as one hits Mach 1 is felt as the plane goes
into transition from normal airflow (where air flows over each part of the
craft) to the shockwave airflow.  You can imagine each part of an aircraft
forming its own shockwave thus making for very turbulent air.  Once the
speed of sound is exceeded, there is only the one shockwave.

Transonic drag is MUCH heavier than supersonic drag.  This is why some
aircraft require afterburners to go hit the speed of sound, yet cruise
supersonic without the burners.

Hope this makes sence,

Boy, ain\'t *that* the truth.  This is the reason I love to follow the

Brian,

You may want to pass this on to your TML friends--

They are right about power being the function of a cube root
rather than a square root, something I discovered after
type was set and couldn\'t do anything about it.

My friend and Royal Navy naval architect Stuart Machin called
my attention to this and also worked out corrected hull resistance
factors that would work properly with a cube root equation.

These will appear if and when a Wet Navy book (or combined
COACC/Wet Navy book) appears as an expansion of the new
TNE rules set.

Meanwhile, the square root formula, while not being totally
realistic, is easy to use as part of a wet ship design
system which yields usable results in game terms.

Best Regards,

Terry

some of the "odder" things that can be stolen from older SF and
incorporated into Traveller.

We came up with one that looks like it could be *real* nasty, but I\'d
like to bounce it off the ship design folks.

Jack Williamson had a couple of Novels in the 50s set in a version of
the solar system that was a bit improbable then and *totally* impossible
now. But a similar solar system *could exist in this galaxy (it\'d just
be *very* unlikely).

Specificly, this system had suffered from an encounter with an
extra-galactic rogue planet. Both it and one of the systems planet
interacted and the result was a large asteriod belt.

I hear you saying "So what?". Well, there\'s one *teensy* detail... the
rogue planet was antimatter. This means that a rather low tech level
culture could have antimatter powerplants *and* warheads...

Picture the poor unsuspecting Imperial scouts encountering *that*
contradicttion. (Tech level 10 ships with antimatter power! <shudder>)

Anybody think it\'s worth fudging up some designs for?

Hello TMLers,

The TML is making a big shift TONIGHT. I have completely rewritten the
TML digester software to be more portable. I have moved the TML
addresses lock, stock, and barrel to engrg.uwo.ca, under Dan Corrin\'s
systems where the TML ftp site is also located.

The reason for this drastic move is that I have quit my position at
Tektronix in Beaverton, Oregon, for a new job at Spectra-Physics 170 km
South at the other end of Oregon\'s scenic Willamette Valley, in Eugene,
Oregon. Naturally, I will need to vacate the corporate computing
resources that Tek has so generously made available to house the
Traveller Mailing List.

My new email address for personal mail will be: jamesp@sp-eug.com. This
address is already working, and until my termination date at Tektronix,
which is Friday, July 24, 1992, will forward mail to me here.

Although the TML has moved, I will continue to manage additions and
deletions of TML members, via remote control e-mail from Eugene.

PLEASE TAKE NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING CHANGES:

	o email TML submissions to the new submission address:

		traveller@engrg.uwo.ca

	o email TML questions and administrative notes to the new
	  request address:

		traveller-request@engrg.uwo.ca

	o when you send mail to the submission address, you will be
	  immediately notified by email that the message has been
	  accepted (new feature!).
	o the bundle subsciption service is going away -- I didn\'t have
	  time to reinstrument it at UWO.  All bundle subscribers will
	  start recieving the biweekly digests instead.
	o the table of contents that appears at the beginning of each
	  digest will be more comprehensive, showing archive message
	  number, archive bundle i.d., date, sender, and subject,
	  instead of just AMN and subject.

Thanks for your support!

	And if you are interested in playing Topas, do drop me a line.  You
may have twenty TL12 ships available, since the latest conqueror of
Topas is planning on donating them to Topas System Squadron (complete
with advisors to help run them).  There are presently two "governments
in exile", plus one "puppet government" (these designations come from
various players\' descriptions - they may or may not be valid), so you
can play any one of them.  The "puppet government" has the TL12 ships,
the "governments in exile" have Topas original TL10-11 ships split
between them.  I don\'t know what there will be to do as Topas, but with
everyone trying to raise Topas TL, you might come out pretty good.

Wellllll, actually there is a difference between this wave and a shock
wave generated by an aircraft.  The angle between the wave fronts in water
will *always* be  48 degrees.  No matter how fast the boat moves.  Watch
sometime.   The angle between the wave fronts for a plane in the air
changes.  It gets smaller (the wave fronts move together) as the plane
flies faster.

Yes, the plane flies in the relatively undisturbed air behind the shock
front, but that\'s because if the control surfaces entered it, the plane
would be uncontrollable.

I think the reason this happens on the water is surface tension.  A
classic example of second order effects have a major impact on first
order effects.

And now you know why the Shionthy system is a Red Zone.  According to
Adventure 1, Kinunir, that system is a planetoid belt with chunks of
anti-matter floating around.

What this means is that either the Imperials have already used the
stuff (TL 15 ships with anti-matter power - not quite such a big
shudder :-) or that there is some basic reason why they could or
would not do so, such as the ship blowing up.  If the Imperials can\'t
build anti-matter powerplants at TL 15, neither can those TL 10 people.
Or indeed, the TL 8 residents of the Shionthy system.

Anyone want to design some TL 8 ships with anti-matter power? :-)

    'body' => '2300AD has no rules for evaluating complex combat between vehicles and
people, and even between vehicles. Currently, it\'s just as easy to fire at
or from a stationary, moving, and evading vehicle.

All vehicles have an evasion rating, desgined for use against incoming
missles (and only that *sigh). The rule for resolving this is: Subtract the
evasion number from the missile\'s homing value, and roll that number or less
on a D10 (10 always fails). However, there\'s no rule to evaluate aimed fire
at an evading vehicle, and the evasion ratings don\'t easily translate to
character skill modifiers.

Second, there\'s no rules for modifying fire from a moving or evading
vehicle. Currently we\'ve decided that you can only conduct area fire, and
you must make a difficult skill roll to maintain your balance (a Control
roll) followed by a difficult skill roll to keep your weapon tracking the
correct location. This seems somewhat artificial to us.

Even the vehicle <-> vehicle rules suffer from this problem; two wildly
evading vehicles can still shoot at each other as though they were
stationary. This is just a little unrealistic.

So my questions are:

a) how does this happen in reality (really a question for sci.military, but
   I don\'t get that group here).

b) has anyone come up with (well balanced) rules for resolving these
   problems? How does the new Twilight 2000 (the successor of 2300AD\'s task
   system) handle this?

     "Picking up radiation." observed Jietlshaiepr.  "Dangerous
in long exposure, no more than fifteen minutes outside...
Picking up something in the water... small, distorted, but it\'s
there...  coming in visual range."
     The downed SDB was barely afloat.  Only the bridge remained
above water with its wind screen blown out by explosive bolts.
The hull was scarred and burned by nuclear fire.  The plates bent
and cracked from the crash impact.
     "There \'e is!" called Jones.  A limp figure in a rubber raft
drifted a hundred meters from the wrecked ship.
     Vole\'s voice came over the suit radio in Zhodani, "I read
him out as semiconscious.  There is another life source inside
the ship:  roughly I\'d say in the engine room.  Condition
unconscious, but definitely alive."
     Jietlshaiepr thought aloud, "Shtam, set us down.  Gresha,
you grab the one in the raft.  It\'s too risky to board that
thing, but..."
     Gresha climbed into the airlock as Jietlshaiepr began to
concentrate on psionically feeling her way into the ship.  The
ship shuddered slightly as the Gig plowed along the surface.
Gresha tumbled outside and into the water.  She sank quickly
under the weight of her battle dress before rising free on her
grav belt.  She skimmed the waves to the drifting raft.
     It was a five person raft bobbing about like a cork with
it\'s only occupant.  He was sprawled face down in the center of
the raft wearing a vac suit.  The helmet lay nearby with a
shattered face plate.  The floor of the raft was rolling with
vomit.
     "Srrishe, furr sorze gorrar!" translates directly as \'Vile,
personal finger noise.\', and idiomatically as \'Bleech!\'  Gresha
Dipped the pirate in the ocean before she pulled him aloft.
     "\'ey, Should we bother wi\' the other?" wondered Jones.  "We
got one, mate?"
     "Quiet!" barked Jietlshaiepr.  She stared into the wreck
with her eyes closed.  Seconds later, she vanished into the
proverbial thin air.
     Smith and Jones exchanged glances.  Waves beat over the
rolling, half submerged SDB threatening to send it to the bottom
as they washed close to the missing windscreen.
     Jietlshaiepr appeared standing on the ships hull as it
rolled.  She was lugging a limp figure in a vac suit.  She lifted
it in her arms carefully and took off with her grav belt.
Slowly, she moved up and into the Gig\'s airlock.
     "This one\'s in pretty bad shape." she called.  "Even with
better attention than we can give I don\'t think she\'d recover
consciousness."
     Smith and Jones examined the one Gresha had brought in.
"This one\'s pretty bad," commented Smith, "We need to get \'im
cleaned off and on intravenous.  Radiation, exposure, shock,
second degree burns on the face, we have to get \'im out o\' this
suit:  it\'s radioactive."
     Jietlshaiepr grabbed a pair of pliers, "First thing\'s
first."  She pushed Jones aside and grabbed the pirates head.
She deftly forced his mouth open against his will and quickly
looked inside.  She found what she was looking for quickly and
grabbed with the pliers.
     A bloody tooth came out.  The pirate screamed and passed
out.
     "Wha..." began Jones, then comprehending, "Ahh... Suicide
capsule.  Quick thinking."
     Jietlshaiepr removed the other prisoner\'s tooth more gently.
"I think this one\'s about had it.  Radiation, internal injuries,
shock..."
          - XXVIII -
     The Gig raced back towards the continent.
     Corporal Delt the radioed her report, "I got Turner, she\'s
O.K." pause, "Spacehand Apprentice Coleman is dead:  Suit burned
through in re-entry.  I\'ll rendezvous with Lt. Dragoon in
seventeen minutes."
     "What\'s our ETA?" asked Jietlshaiepr.
     "Sixteen minutes." read Shtam.
     "And the two G-carriers should be right about on top of her
by now." thought Smith.
          - XXIX -
     Dragoon watched from cover with the guard robot.  The two
G-carriers circled around looking at the wilted parachute from
her re-entry kit with their laser turrets spinning around like
great white, one eyed hawks.
     One hawk dropped down for a closer look.  It hovered a few
seconds a meter above the ground and then set down.  Quickly, the
rear hatch opened and the hawk\'s brood jumped out:  a fire team
of four armed with advanced combat rifles.
     Dragoon raised her laser rifle to the ready.
     The leader started to motion the team to fan out when his
black combat environment suit flared red over the left breast and
burst into flame.  He clutched at his chest and went down.
     A burst of gauss rifle fire from the guard robot sprayed the
team as it glanced around in confusion.  Two more fell with
bloodied suits.  The fourth, wounded, still managed to stand and
fire a burst in the air before being cut down by Dragoon\'s laser.
     Dragoon burst from cover and ran for the hatch screaming.
     The robot flew directly for the second G-carrier and grabbed
its under carriage.
     Bursts of rifle fire rang from inside the first G-carrier
followed by the sizzle of a laser.
     The guard robot began ripping away the hull of the G-carrier.
The metal bent easily under its huge strength.  A moment later it
exposed a grav module and sent a burst of gauss rifle fire into the
works.  It sputtered and shorted briefly.  The G-carrier took on a
list.
     A sizzle sounded inside the landed G-carrier.
     More metal tore away from the G-carrier a second grav module
hove into view.  The robot fired into the second module when
Dragoon sounded on its radio.  "Robot, get off that thing!"  It
dropped away from the listing G-carrier when the first G-carrier
opened fire.
     The laser lanced into the sky missing by five meters.  The
second beamed by missing by two meters.  Then, the underside of
the G-carrier exploded.  Tiny bits of fusion plant flew out from
the shattered hull.
     Without power, the G-carrier fell like a stone.  It dropped
twenty meters and smashed itself into the ground.  The fuel tanks
ruptured and hydrogen flared into the sky.  The armor caught fire
and the ship blazed like a furnace.
     A moment later, in the Gig they heard Dragoon screaming
wildly over the radio.
          - XXX -
     They found her lounging on the rear hatch of the G-carrier
with a grin on her face, laser rifle on her shoulder, smoking a
cigarette while blood streamed down her arm from a hole in her
combat armor.
     In the back ground a radio sounded, "come in... G-carrier
one come in...  Report..."
     Jones looked over the wound while Smith and Jietlshaiepr
climbed inside the G-carrier.
     "It\'s a standard Tarsan class G-carrier:  tech level ten,
Imperial design." commented Smith as she made her way forward.
     "No identifying marks on it... can\'t tell where it was
built." thought Jietlshaiepr aloud.
     "I wouldn\'a expect there te be any." answered Smith, "Bu\'
with the radio open we can send a distress call..."
          - XXXI -
     The ambush was quickly laid out.  Kfoks began digging out
fox holes with the tilly.  Trees were broken up to provide cover
with small fires for fake infrared traces to confuse detectors.
Shtam rigged the fusion plant of the G-carrier to detonate while
Turner set up a proximity fuse coupled with a timer.  Turner,
Dragoon and Smith hid inside to man the guns and use its radio to
jam communications.
     Shtam would be set off in the Gig a kilometer and a half
away for emergencies.
     Twenty minutes after the auto distress beacon was activated,
Jones\' recon robot picked up a launch headed out from the
mercenaries island to the battle field.
          - XXXII -
     The launch came in low over the field.  A cautious vulture
with its single eye of a missile turret scanning the ground as it
circled over the bodies of the two fallen hawks.  Infrared
signals registered like a platoon down on the surface.  The
vulture hesitated at putting its tail feathers into such a nest.
     The radio sounded.  "This is launch number two, we\'ve got a
battle field here...  No visible survivors...  Looks like enemy
forces, SDB five stand by to give us a laser barrage..."
     Smith cut in the G-carrier\'s jammer.
     A few moments later the launch opened fire on the largest
fake emplacement.
     Dirt and rocks leaped skyward and rained down on the
concealed ambushers.
     Turner cut loose a blast of laser fire from the G-carriers
turret.  Three fusion guns and one plasma gun blasted away at the
launch as it nearly hovered over the scene.
     The missile turret began to swing round to bear on the
captured G-carrier.  A second pulse of the heavy laser found the
launch.
     The launch was enshrouded in flame as liquid hydrogen spewed
from a rupture in the fuel tank.
     It swerved a moment to port and brought the missile tube to
bear on the G-carrier.
     Ens. Smith appeared on the Gig in underclothes.  "Get moving!
We\'re in trouble!"
     Shtam glanced sidelong at Smith.  "Not only a teleport, but
a blasted cute one too..."  The Gig leapt under expert control.
     "Concentrate fire on the turret!" shouted Jietlshaiepr over
the sear of plasma bolts.
     The missile tube was suddenly enshrouded in fire as the guns
were brought to bear.
     "We can\'t touch it!" howled Gresha.
     Suddenly, the missile tube fired.  The nose of the warhead
came clear of the tube and jammed solid.
     The turret exploded, throwing shrapnel and flame.  The
launch canted off to port and swung away wobbling.  The Gig
blasted over the horizon blazing laser fire.
     The launch was caught in a hell of X-rays.  The drives
exploded and cut out.  It screamed into the ground and rolled
like a tin can.  It finally ground to a halt and lay on its back
in a burning mass of twisted wreckage.
     "Shtam, bring it on down!" shouted Jietlshaiepr, "TEAM!  We
are leaving!"
          - XXXIII -
     The Gig lunged toward the coast throttled back.  At
transonic speeds Shtam flew it over the trees at three hundred
meters.  Going supersonic would attract too much attention:  too
much heat, too much atmospheric disturbance.
     "If the SDBs are awake they\'ll spot us very soon." growled
Kfoks.  "The explosions back there must have howled to the whole
planet."
     "This one is dead." announced Vole.  He dragged the body of
the pirate that Jietlshaiepr rescued to the air lock.  Quickly,
the lock was stuffed, closed and made ready to drop the body.
     "Let\'s get the other strapped into one o` the low berths."
suggested Jones.  "We\'ll get \'im set up for interog..."
     A dull thud resounded through the hull as one point five
gigawatts of photon energy struck the ground five hundred meters
aft of the fleeing Gig.
     "They found us!" snapped Shtam.
     He sent the Gig into a flurry of twisting corkscrews.
Cushioned by the inertial compensators, everyone but Shtam got a
smooth ride.  But it\'s easier to maneuver when you can feel
something of what you\'re doing.  Shtam, however, only felt one
tenth of one G where he should have been crushed by the force of
six.
     Another thud managed to be heard through the sound proofing
of the Gig\'s hull and above the howl of mach point nine six.
"They\'re getting too close!  How far to the ocean?"
     "Five kilometers." Shtam replied mechanically, deep in
concentration as the Gig responded like a thing alive under his
fingers.  "I would advise you all... to... strap in... because we
are going to dump... HARD..."
     The passengers checked their belts.  Impact too fast and no
inertial comps in the universe would save them.
     "Ten seconds..." a third thud resounded through the hull:
nearer this time.
     Shtam whipped the Gig around and slammed the engines on full
throttle.  The Gig slowed as it fell toward the water.  In three
seconds the ship slowed from transonic speed and slammed into the
water at twenty kilometers an hour.  The hull rang with the jolt
of the sudden stop as the strain pulled on the inertial comps.
     "Dive!" shouted Jietlshaiepr.
     Shtam dove.  Their tracking systems would figure out what
had happened in a few se...
     Something let out an eerie high pitched scream.  The hull
sounded like a kettle drum for a moment as the ocean was brought
to a small boil around it.
     "Damage?" called Jietlshaiepr.
     Shtam hesitated, "Nothing I can see...  Systems check... all
green."
     "Their lasers can\'t get through water." explained Kfoks.
     "Yeah, we\'re safe, but we\'re stuck in the briar patch, Brer
Kfoks." sighed Jones.
          - XXXIV -
     The Gig cruised at thirty kilometers an hour along the ocean
bottom, making its way along the submarine canyons back to the
trench that hid the Flamboyant.
     "All right, everyone," sighed Jietlshaiepr, "Seeing as we
have little alternative but taking you to the Flamboyant.  I must
ask you to surrender your weapons, and the helmets to your
armor."  Carefully she examined the faces of the League of Suns
crew.  Various states of distrust on unfamiliar visages.
     "Very well," announced Jones.  He unbuckled his laser rifle
and handed it to her.  He seemed slightly startled when she held
out a hand for his folding machine gun, but he handed it over as
well.
     Slowly, the weapons were collected.  Smith handed over her
laser rifle and folding machine gun.  Delt gave up her gauss
rifle.  Walker hesitated markedly, but gave up the PGMP-12.
     Dragoon came last.  She ignored the collection until it came
to her and then her sole response was to grip the laser rifle
more tightly.
     Jietlshaiepr looked her over frostily, "Lt. Dragoon, please
surrender your rifle."
     "No."
     "I will not allow you to come within a hundred kilometers of
the ship carrying that.  You can forget commandeering our ship.
Try it and you won\'t get three paces."
     "Dragoon!" growled Jones.  "Hand it over."
     "Is that an order?"
     "Do I have to make it one?"
     Dragoon thought it over, angrily staring at Jones.  "Right."
she breathed, "Here."
     The rifle was half passed, half thrown.
     Jietlshaiepr caught it quickly and the two froze, staring at
each other.
     "Our soldiers do not trust each other." sighed Jones, "I would
not have it any other way."
     Jietlshaiepr stared at Dragoon, "Indeed, such things are
true of both sides."
          - XXXV -
     Once docked with the Flamboyant, sickbay was evacuated and
sealed while Jietlshaiepr teleported inside to evaluate the
vaccine.
     Jones and Smith blindfolded the prisoner and strapped him in
a low berth.  Normally used for cryogenic suspension in an
emergency, they also made good sensory deprivation chambers.
     Slowly, they let him return to consciousness.
     Jones knelt next to the berth concentrating oddly on the
instrument read out.
     "This human has to be a telepath..." breathed Kfoks.
          - XXXVI -
     "What?...  Where am I?  I was on the bridge...  We
crashed...  I\'ve bailed out!...
     Ok...  I was in the raft when somebody picked me up...  They
took my tooth...  I\'ve been captured...
     Thank god for training camp...  It took \'em three weeks to
break me there..."
     The prisoner\'s consciousness began to drop as he went
carefully and deliberately to sleep.
          - XXXVII -
     Tuerz climbed down from the airlock wearing his female costume
with his fur dyed red white and black.  He carried a black leather
case while his jeweled laser pistol hung from its holster.
     He looked at the prisoner in the low berth, "Taek!" he
grinned at Kfoks, "You\'ve brought me a present!"
     Tuerz opened the black case to reveal a collection of
knives, brass knuckles, whips, blackjacks, and scalpels.  Antique
thumbscrews, hand cuffs, electrodes all set carefully into the
red velvet of the case.
     Lt. Jones peered into the case.  There were several wigs in
the bottom of the case.  Odd wigs...  They had skin attached...
Jones stared at the scalps.  Beautifully carved, obviously the
taker had been very, very talented and very, very patient.
Briefly he used his psionics to examine the instruments psychic
auras.  But, against the background of the scalps, the box exuded
nothing but white hot searing pain.
          - XXXVIII -
     Jietlshaiepr climbed down the hatch an hour later, hypo in
hand.  Quickly, she raised the armored flap on Shtam\'s battle
dress and sent the hypo home.  "It appears your vaccine works
without affecting traits that are not lethal." she commented.
"Immunization should be complete within an hour."
     "Glad to hear ya confirm it." nodded Jones.
     "How is it going with the prisoner?"
     "e\'s been conditioned against interrogation.  We\'re setting
up a few surprises fer \'im.  A combination o\' sensory deprivation
an\' water torture:  we\'ll \'ave him dosed wi\' local anesthetic

     "...This is the house that Jack built...  This is the rat

          - XL -
     "\'e\'s been thinking \'at fer hours." yawned Smith.  The
telepathic trio of Smith, Jones and Jietlshaiepr lounged around
the berth containing their prisoner.
     "Well, let\'s try \'im on a different tack." sighed Jones.
     Jones stood, stretched himself and took a deep breath.  "I\'m
gonna try something."
     He knelt by the head of the berth and opened the pirate\'s
mind.  "This is the dog that chased the cat that killed the rat
that lived on the ship that Jack built."
     The pirate considered the interjected thought for a moment.
"Ship...  Ship dip...  Ship fall down, go boom!..."
     Jones jaw dropped incredulously.
     "Ship fall down, go boom!?"
     A flash went off in the pirate\'s mind.  He struggled against
a tumbling ship to keep it aloft.  A spinning world flashed by as
the SDB hit the water.  Panic... explosive bolts... the dead
bridge crew...  the raft...  water....
          - XLI -
     "...Hello, Hello?  Is there anybody out there...?"
     The answer came back and buried itself in the prisoner\'s
thoughts "Commander."
     A vision wrenched itself into his mind.  The dead captain of
the SDB, lying on the broken bridge.  "Murdoc..." floated around
his head like a child\'s balloon.
     Another picture floated in:  a grey haired man in a
captain\'s uniform, he was standing in a briefing room with a
crowd of SDB pilots and captains.  The map on the holotank was
Welles.  The Star Rider\'s captain was just pointing out the
emergency rendezvous point at the L5 Lagrange point.
     A third picture came in, a fat balding man in a colonel\'s
uniform.  "McNamara..." imposed itself indignantly in the
pirate\'s mind, with a hint of sarcasm and scorn.
     "Ollie Sutherland..." came abruptly in.  The tone was one of
frank admiration.  He appeared in a major\'s uniform standing on
the top of a grav tank with a command pennant.  Male caucasian,
one point eight meters tall, blonde hair closely cropped, blue
eyes with a commanding presence that filled the memory of the
prisoner.
          - XLII -
     "I\'m going to try something..." muttered Jietlshaiepr, and
she knelt close to the berth.
     Slowly, she called up an image in the prisoner\'s mind.  A
man with whitish blonde hair.  He had whitened scars on his face
and a large one encircling his neck.  He wore an old battle
jacket with patches ripped from past enemies corpses, and carried
an ancient sub machine gun.
     The pirate was confused at first, then an image came up.
The man stood on the hanger deck of the Star Rider, a Kinunir
class battle cruiser was suspended from the locks.  The name
"Roland" rolled about in the prisoner\'s consciousness like a ball
bearing in a funnel until it hit the spout.  "Roland...
Roland...  Roland... T...  Gunner...  Roland T. Gunner..."

Unwarranted assumption, I think. It is much more likely that the amount
of anti-matter that the Imperium can get out of Shionthy is too small to
base a squadron of ships on (I doubt that Imperial admirals think in
smaller units than squadrons). The people of Shionthy lives by gathering
anti-matter and selling it to the Imperium (this is the real reason the
Imperium allows them to stay in a system that is interdicted for being
to dangerous to travel in). So they can at least handle the anti-matter.
Wether they can use it in power-plants is another matter. But if you
want to give your players a prototype anti-matter-driven ship you can.

>Or indeed, the TL 8 residents of the Shionthy system.

They can collect it, at least. But maybe they get the tools to do so
from the Imperium.

you took the power generated by the U.S. you could make about 1 kilogram
of antimatter in about 1 year.
    Now presuming a world decided to send up Solar Arrays early, and used
the power generated to create AM, they could skip most of the work on Fusion
power and skip directly to AM power (of course some of the work is related,
as I imagine an AM power plant would have some of the same construction
requirements as a Fusion plant.

Sub: Lasers & Atmosphere

Some data to post on TML:

MT has rules for lasers and atmosphere.  The \'to hit\' difficulty in
vaccum is the same as normal, but there is no attenuation (therefore the
penetration at longer ranges is good, _if_ you can hit).

All Traveller lasers emit very short pulses (even beam lasers, which just
have a long pulse).  Why?  Because there are no rules for waving a laser
around and hitting a group of people.  It\'s a post facto rules explanation,
but something to keep in mind.  (And was contaiuned in a letter I got from
GDW many years ago.)

An interesting reference is Dr. Robert L Forward\'s book, _Future Magic_,
which describes many wonderful things (none of which appear to need any
"physics nullifiers").  One of the more interesting proposals was for
antimatter powered space travel.  He does an interesting analysis that
shows that antimatter powered upper stages may be practical for Space
Shuttle payloads.  The gist of the idea is that it costs quite a lot (in
terms of money and fuel) to lift many tons of rocket fuel into orbit on
the space shuttle.  A few grams of antimatter can do the same job, and
may cost less in the long run.  He also presents some workable TL8
containment and propulsion ideas.  It is possible that Earth will
achieve workable fusion technology and workable antimatter technology at
about the same time.  Maybe we should toss the TL chart and draw a new
one.

(Ahem, Richard?  Why do you think my signature is 2G Kellogg?  Come on, you
see my name on your cereal box EVERY morning!  :-)

}Wellllll, actually there is a difference between this wave & a shock
}wave generated by an aircraft.  The angle between the wave fronts in water
}will *always* be  48 degrees.  No matter how fast the boat moves.  Watch
}sometime.   The angle between the wave fronts for a plane in the air
}changes.  It gets smaller (the wave fronts move together) as the plane
}flies faster.

All quite true.  However, I needed something visible to illustrate a
shockwave that we all are more familiar with.

}I think the reason this happens on the water is surface tension.  A
}classic example of second order effects have a major impact on first
}order effects.

I seem to remember someone once saying that the angle of a wake has to do
with the gravitational force on the water, density, as well as surface
tension.  Thus on another planet, all ships would have the same angle to
their wakes, though it may not be the same as it would be for a vessel on
earth.

(Transonic Drag)
}The human body is not terribly stable in air,
}and @ around .7M & up we should start to see the results of
}compression of the airflow around parts of the body.  That is, for
}instance the shoulder will produce more lift than the foot, for a
}while, etc.

}Me, Id\' hate to experience the transonic region, with sock wave,
}compressed flow, turbulence, & induced flutter, without the aid
}of some titanium betweem me & the air.  :=)

The Buffetting experienced by aircraft in the transonic region is
mainly caused by the shockwave passing over the control surfaces of
The aircraft.  This is acutally why the engineers used to call it
\'The Sound Barrier\' The aircraft of the time were designed in such
a way that the sonic shockwave would disturb the airflow around the
control surfaces rendering them inoperative.  This is what is
referred to as compressibility.

Now a human body has no such control surfaces.  And a person operating
a grav belt will be relying on the thrust of the belt for steering
more than he would on the air flow around him.  So, there wouldn\'t be
any lessening of control in the region for any grav or space vehicle.
(No air control surfaces!)

(Orbital Lasers & Executive Action)
}Scott says:
}:Well, when you have a camera in orbit capable of resolving 10cm
}:objects on the surface, it\'s easy enough to correct fire.

}Getting this resolution would be a nighmare, Scott, if you\'re actually
}in orbit.  Theoretical resolution limits @ your chosen wavelength.
}You\'d have to set up a synthetic aperture arrangement with three
}(well two, but three would be better) or more ships.  What DOD
}stellites do is dip into the atmosphere close to the target, get
}higher later.  I *think* it\'s on the order of 1/2pi*w where w is
}wavelength.

Have you seen "Patriot Games"?  That was what started me on this thread.
The satillite photographs they show there look to me as though they
have a resolution of 10cm.  Now, the satillites aren\'t orbiting out at
50,000km true (short range for traveller starship combat) But still,
If we can do it at TL 8, they can pull the same trick at TL 15.  Ok, as
Metlay pointed out X-Ray lasers are not the way to go, but a meson gun
could pick off individuals really easily.

My guess is that the laser speckle of a 250MW beam would do a hell of
a lot of damage to any of the nearby eyeballs.  Think about it.  What
would happen to your eyeballs if someone illuminated the terminal room
yer sitting in with 250MW of ordinary incoherent scattered light?  Not
necessarily lethal, (unless you are sitting on it) but blinding someone
in a combat situation is as effective as killing them.

 Surely not ALL the rocks in MT are so mineral rich?  What about belts in more

  Is MT populated by people dumb enough to live on a planet that duff for no

    'body' => 'Howdy all,

I got a complaint recently that I\'ve been thinking a bit about.
That being my portrayal of the Zhodani Consulate in the story
I\'ve been posting.

Well, the complaint was along the lines that I was portraying a
distopia in a more favorable light than it is deserving of.
Quite possibly true, however, I should point out that the story
is *FAR* from over.  Perceptions may change.

In any case, I found that the description of the Zhodani
*DIStopia* is very similar to some people\'s conceptions of a
*Utopia*.  I don\'t necessarily *agree* with their concept of what
constitutes a utopia, but their\'s is rather similar to the
Consulate.

So, I thought I\'d examine how it gets looked at.

Ok, now, there are a LOT of people who advocate the kind of
collective society that the Consulate is.  Many of these people
advocate re-education of the masses to bring them around to their
point of view.  They say criminals should be re-educated, not
imprisoned.  Or in extreme cases re-educated then executed.
Those who disagree with them are attacked and would undoubtedly
be put into re-education centers if this group had their way.

Who are these folks?  The Politically Correct Nazis we often find
today.  If you gave the PC\'s psionics, they would turn into
something *VERY* like the Thought Police.  After all what other
groups have defined *thoughts* as crimes?  Laughing at a non-PC
joke is an offence. |-P

Acually, the Zho Thought Police would probably be much more
understanding of human emotions than the PC\'s.  After all the
Zho\'s have had millenia to study and map the human mind in
*exactitude*.  Thus, they would realize that some human emotions
which are suppressed and attacked in a PC society are more firmly
based in the human mind and are fundamental to the health of the
mind.

I don\'t want to get into an argument on the PC movement.  I have
sympathies to the more moderate side, but the radical edge of the
PC\'s are truely out of their minds.

Ok, let\'s look at a utopic Politically Correct society, which
uses psionics that we all (unfortuately) are familiar with:  The
New Star Trek.  There is a psi officer aboard the Enterprise who
serves as the ship\'s \'councellor\' (Thought Police, Zampolit,
Political Officer).  She monitors the emotions of the crew and
those they interact with.  She \'councels\' or \'re-educates\'
individuals who are in need of \'help\'.  If a crew member was
contemplating a crime, you can bet that the ship\'s \'councellor\'
would take steps to prevent it.  How different is this from the
Evil Zhodani Thought Police? (tm)  Not very far if you ask me.

Where does the Zhodani Consulate diverge from these?
Well, the Zho\'s aren\'t a cashless society.  But that\'s not
important here.

The Zho\'s have a hereditary nobility, and their education is
strongly linked to their social rank.  The PC\'s wouldn\'t like
that bit.

Well, the hereditary nobility can be put off according to the
theory that psi ability is genetic.  (It might be, it mightn\'t be
there is no real way to tell for certain from the character
generation tables)  This system is understandable and to be
expected.  Note however, that proles can become nobles if they
show promise in the field of psionics.  Proles stand a much
better chance of getting into the nobility than Imperial
commoners.

The education bit is the real sticking point.  You can\'t have an
education greater than your social standing unless it is aquired
during your terms of service.  Presumably, Proles aren\'t admitted
to college.  (gotta check that one)

Scott "2G" Kellogg
(New Star Trek:  Note that we never see the Proles there.  All
characters are officers.  And you never see a psi who isn\'t
either an officer or a noble or official of some kind)

PS.  Please let\'s not start talking about Star Trek on the TML.
I just needed to use an example.
