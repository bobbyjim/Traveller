Are you kidding?  A doctor can\'t tie a tourniquet, as well as a 
paramedic?  A doctor can\'t monitor vital signs, administer CPR, etc?  

> could use his First Aid as Medic, but with a two-level penalty (minimum zero).

I\'m sorry, but no EMT in the world is qualified to do surgery.  No 
EMT in the world is qualified to prescribe medication.  Higher skill 
levels in First Aid really wouldn\'t do anything beyond improving the 
chance that he tied that tourniquet off right.  Basically, unless 
you\'re looking at a low skill level, which can easily be duplicated 
by Medical skill, there is no reason for a First Aid skill.

BTW, I like your tag line... :-)

Actually, this is the way a "pushes on the star/planet" type drive
*has* to work if you want conservation of energy to hold. The energy
you pump in is *directly* proportional to the change in your kinetic
energy (relative to whatever you are pushing on).

Only trouble is, simple calculations show that this winds up being
*very* inferior to a reaction drive.

Nope.

BTW, with regards to your comments about whether or not this
distinction is an artifact of the way we train people, do recall that
many military (and some commercial) pilots learn on multi-engine craft
from the start.

This leads to some interesting jokes between the single and
multi-engine types. The single engine fighter jock shows off with some
fancy areobatics and say something like "bet you wish you could do
that". The bomber/tanker pilot replies, "Hey, I can do something you
can\'t..." The fighter pilot waits, does see much happen and finally
goes "Well?" The other pilot comes back with "I just strolled back,
used the john and got a cup of coffee".

More seriously, the multi-engine folks can\'t understand why anybody
would want to fly something where if one engine goes out, you\'re toast.
The single engine types can\'t understand why anyone wants to have all
those extra indicators to keep track of. :-)

I guess this is my fear as well.  But something like that as part of

I agree with you to a point.  I guess I argue against First Aid 
because if you cascade every skill in the list (which is VERY 
conceivable, if you think about it), pretty soon, you\'ve got about 
500 skills to remember (and teach players BTW), which all cascade off of 
about 60.  The idea is to attract new players.  You do that by 
building an elegant, easy to learn, easy to use system, along with a 
well developed background. 

Then later, you can add the 500 skills, new character classes, and 
complicate matters for the players you\'ve hooked.  ;-)

    'body' => 'Well, it appears that we have several different styles of Traveller 
players, and that they overlap to some degree.  There are people who like 
complex, moderate, and simple systems for ship design.  These three 
groups also exist for skill systems.  This is probably also true of every 
other system in Traveller.  

An interesting thing is that the people who enjoy complex ship design 
(for instance) are not necessarily the same people who enjoy complex 
skill systems (again, for instance).  

Me?  I\'m one of the folks who likes to keep things simple, but I also 
appreciate the need of others for complexity.  It\'s great that Mr. 
Wildstar\'s system may be (will be?) included in the basic book.  If that 
is true, then I will be very, very happy.  (No offense meant to Mr. 
Golden - I like his system, too, but I love the idea of having all three 
systems (including the renamed FF&S) available.)  If things turn out the 
way they are looking to in terms of ship design, I\'ll probably use QSDS 
most of the time, FF&S Light once in a while (for important ship 
designs), and FF&S only once in a great while.

So, having lots of different ship design sytems is good.  But is this 
also true of skill systems?  I mean, heck, if it were possible, wouldn\'t 
that satisfy everyone?  

I\'m thinking it can\'t be done smoothly, however.  Not without drastically 
changing the Traveller skills system.  Let\'s say the basic system has 
only top-level skills with a few cascades.  Medic-0 is first aid, etc.  
The complex system would either have tons of cascades (Medical is divided 
into First Aid, Nurse, etc.) or simply have tons of skills (Medic is one 
skill, First Aid is another).  Unlike with going from QSDS to FF&S or 
FF&S Light to FF&S, taking a character from one of these systems to the 
other would involve some translations.  

Examples:

Basic to Cascade:  My (Basic) Medic-1 would have to make a choice as to 
which cascade skill (or skills) she would want to have.  Instead of 
being mediocre at all medical skills, she would be mediocre at one 
cascade and very poor (skill level 0) at all others.  She looses ability 
in the translation.

Basic to Lots O\' Skills:  My (again, Basic) Medic-1 would go from being 
able to perform emergency medical assistance to being less able to do so 
(if I have this system figured right).  The First Aid or EMT skilled 
people would be more proficient than she at this sort of action.  (And if 
this is not the case,then why have separate skills at all?  If one is a 
subset of the other, then keep them as one skill.)

As I (and others) have said before, my preference is that there be a good 
list of basic skills (something very like the complete skill list from 
CT, including all the Books and Supplements).  If more skills are needed 
in a particular campaign, the referee can add them.  


While there may be broad support for having a lot more skills, each 
individual extra skill is only going to be useful to a very limited 
number of referees and players.  Please, keep the basic skills system simple.

   TNE had it\'s major flaws (like Virus & only reaction drives).  It did have
some strong points though.  The character creation system was much stronger
than CT.  The task resolution system didn\'t drive GM\'s to pack asprin like
the MT system.

  Because there are enough gearheads out there to make it worthwhile

   There was a poll taken, and the results showed that most folks who
used all three design systems perfered FF&S.  It also showed that there
was a need for a \'Q&D\', plug & play design system (like Book 2).
  That is what IG is putting out.  The Plug & Play rules in the main
book, and detailed, gearhead rules in a seperate book.  Don\'t buy the
gearhead book if that level of detail offends you.

  If T4 is just a reissue of CT, why bother?  It has been 20 years, and
the RPG industry has learned some lessons (like it doesn\'t pay to argue
with T$R lawyers :-<).  There are some good features from TNE & MT that
IG should look to including in T4, as well as things that should be left
by the wayside.

Personally I dislike, hell I HATE thruster plates, why?  There is no

Forward Observer:  Lots of discussion on this, suffice to say those with any
military experience feel that this is an essential skill and should be in
the list.  I agree, who am I to argue with people who\'ve actually been
involved in airstrikes and artillery support.

Orbital military operations:  Lots of speculation here, and I really don\'t
think any of us have practical experience on the field.  Hand\'s up all those
of you who\'ve been involved in a combat orbital insertion?  None, I thought
so.  Honestly I think TNE had it right here.  (This\'ll get peoples backs
up.)  At TL12 (T4 baseline tech) you establish orbital superiority, gain air
superiority if you can, lets face it they\'ve probably got far more gear than
you do, so this may take time, time you can\'t afford to give them.  So what
do you do?  Classic black ops stuff, destroy their communications, supply
and command structure and get men on the ground doing this before they have
a chance to orgainze a defence.  Orbital hot drops via drop capsules gives
greater suvivablity twenty troopers in one ship or twenty troopers as thirty
targets, chaff flares and PAD supression missles.  Besides that as a
parachutist myself the idea of being dropped from orbit is just too cool.

Skill Cascading:  Here we have a choice, put the whole thing together in one
neatly orgainzed book (note the words neat and organized), or farm the
skills out over a half a dozen supplements over a period of two years.
Personally I\'d prefer the rule and character generation stuff in a single
book rather than scattered all over the landscape, but thats just a personal
thing.  I again like the idea of Cascades, it allows for specilization in an
area with out denying the player a level of general knowledge necessary to
survive.  The problem we\'re encountering is what\'s cascading and what\'s
nitpicking because of personal expertise?  THis is something thats going to
be hard to distance ourselves from because we can all argue a point till
we\'re blue in the face and still never conceed.

Starship Design:  As has been stated before and IG is going for it most
people prefer a slightly more complicated system when it comes to creating
starships.  Why?  Don\'t really understand it myself but I personally prefer
it to, there\'s a feeling of having accomplished something when you\'re done.
Three sets of rules to design starships is rediculous (sp) but a basic and
advance systems that provides players with design options is do-able.  This
way you can crank out the pirate ship in twenty minutes and spend hours
custom designing the players ship.  FF&S was a good system, poorly organized
and it needed a re-write but basically a good system.  That\'s the problem
with this, when you\'ve written it, it makes perfect sence to you but what
about everyone else?  When the people at the office have been in on the job
since day one they understand it too and no matter how much you edit it\'ll
never make sence.

There\'s someting else I can\'t remember so I\'ll leave this at this for now.

ammo for the weapon, possible laws governing the use of the weapon, tips on
how to conceal the weapon while in public, limitations of the weapon,

I\'m sorry, but I\'m getting so tired of reading all this mis information on 
experimental german aircraft!  The Komet was one of eight experimental
propulsion
systems tested at a secret artic air base.  The test pilot was an old guy named
Kringel.  I believe the other seven systems were named Donner, Blitzen, Danncer,
Prancer, Vixen, Dasher and Cupid.  Now that the truth has been told can be get

Yes they would.  If the choice was \'watch injured individual die\' and
\'maybe save them by operating\' I would hope they take the second choice.
I also think the main reasons they don\'t operate in real life are 
for leagel reason.  There\'s no reason a nurse or paramedic can\'t perform

This is a specific example that I would resolve through the difficulty of 
the task. Example: My friend Wayne is a pilot. His plane is a Piper 
Cherokee. If he were a character in my campaign and needed to fly 
somewere the difficulty would depend on the aircraft that he was flying. 
A piper Cherokee could be flown at no penalty. A Lear Jet would have a 
negative DM attached to it because it\'s not equipment he\'s used to. A 
single engine Cessna would have less or no DM because it\'s basically the 
same.

For medic the same is true. E.g. a Cardiac surgeon would have a negative 
DM applied to his skill if he was doing emergency trauma work. In this 
case the Ref has to figure out the background of the skill. E.g. A Navy 
character with Medic-1 and Gunnery-3 was probably a gunner who learned 
battlefield Medic but a Navy character with Medical School and Medic-3 
was probably the ship\'s medical officer.

Ok thanks for your explanation. 

By the way does anyone know how GDW figures the Passive EMS array size? I am
trying to figure out the array diameter for 300,000km, 360,000km, 420,000km,
and 480,000km. Did they use the longest wavelength in the EMS or what.

Also what would be the range of array with a diameter of 300km, 3000km,
30,000km, and 1000AU?

By the way to what spectrum range is VLA in New Mexico tuned to?

In aperature arrays does anyone know the optimum angle of incidence is, plus
and minus and the side lobes angles?

What are the differances between a aperture synthesis array and a phased

Actually the ones that I am familar used the properties of the 1/4

Perhaps you\'d like to explain then why the Maya, Inca and North American
Indians all never got beyond the stone age.  Surely being indian doesn\'t
conveay a common death wish...  Get real, the Aztec\'s were masters of what
they had as were the Maya, just look at the archaeological record.  They all
built civilizations which rivaled those in Ancient Egypt, Greece etc.  They
just never had access to the raw materials with which to develop their
material culture any further.

Lets face it you\'d think the gods were comming to destroy you too if your
people were dropping like flies of small pox, and the plague.  The tribes
you\'d enslaved decades before were rising up against you and some
particularly strange humans with pale skin and fair hair were leading them.

Your point is very well taken, however, I disagree with the idea that 
only a complicated set of rules will give you a consistency.

For example, tech level is not the only factor that can determain 
size and weight of equipment.  The FF&S rules don\'t take into account
different races, inovative new technologies, religious requirements
or dozons of other possible explainations for deviation.

Granted, CT didn\'t take these factor into account either.  But because 
design system was so simple it took almost no time for the GM to adapt 
them.  In FF&S each part of the design stage is so intimately tied in
to the other parts that a change to one part drastically effects
how the other parts are used.

I\'m not saying that FF&S is bad, only that it is not the only solution
to have a consistent game.

>mindboggling set of possible societies. This way, any given GM could

With CT this happened all the time.  I have dozons of magazines with 
published equipment and ideas.  

Remember, not every tech 14 radio has to have the same 
.0000034 megawatt power requirement.

I\'ld simply create some tasks for the players to roll against.  They would

I see no need to know the exact wattage requirements of the radio or for that
matter how many cubic centimeters it takes up.

This is known as suppresive or prep artillery (or ortillery, if you prefer)
and is such a basic concept that my 5 year old niece understands it.  Your
targets are going to be communcation centers mainly; if you knock out his
commo, he\'s not going to be abel to coordinate his defences.

A prime target is the world\'s starport.. a lot of commo and sensors, usually
near the major settlement or capital.  The defender knows you got to take
it, so he\'s waiting....

No, first you send in jump troops wearing Battle Dress and using fusion guns
to level the area and act as... wait for it... forward observers.  You
either force the defender to expose his missle positions early on, making
them vulnerable to orbital fire, or you face an early, on-the-ground battle
with a group of well equipped commandos.

Once a planethead has been seized; then, and only then, will you start
bringing down grav vehicles...  Aerospace fighters will have to clear quite
a corridor for the inward bound, and the defender has an excellent
oppurtunity to disrupt the invader if he can disabel transports on the ground.

But that\'s what we\'re here for..  :)  Seriously, the highest priority in the
first few hours after an assult is to clear the area of the enemy.  One
lurker with a sniper rifle can cause irrepairable damage with one .12 CR
bullet.  This is the Infantry\'s job, and so it reamains, even in the Third
imperium.

This is a good description of the beastie, though you can spoof them.. jam

Yes.. and no.  Heinlein\'s universe so glorified the grunt as to be a near
deification.  No artillery, no cavalry, nothing but the Mobile Infantry,
Saviors of Mankind!!!

- -Starship Troopers- had infantry carrying nuclear weapons!!  There is a much
better novel: -The Forever War- by Joe Haldeman, that gives a much better
look at both combat, and the Army.

I never said that.  I said "learned knowledge" and not "practiced movements".
While I don\'t have the Constitutional Right to own a firearm, I certainly have
the right to have an interest in them  8-)

Skills such as Medicine obviously rely mainly on memorized information while
Firearms relies more on hand/eye coordination.  As skill levels increase, it can
be assumed that these skills will increase in the fashion that their controlling
attribute dictates (ie: more study time spent in the library for Medical
students and more practice time on the range for Firearms enthusiasts).

This is where your theory falls apart.  At higher skill levels the shear amount
of medical knowledge grows nearly exponentially while Gun Combat is still
chiefly used as an actual physical skill (you can only learn so much about the
proper care & handling of firearms, how to clean them, and the legal
implications of owning such a weapon).

If I would have initially compared Medical-4 to Slug Rifle-4, my point might
have come across slightly better.  The only reason weapons skills are typically
"cascaded" in a role-playing game is that they are given a higher priority than
non-combat skills (ie: they have their own special rules).

Being a great fan of heinlein, I have always incorporated drop troops in
my games.

        While I can definetely see drop troops being used, I\'d think that
they\'d only be used in the sort of situation where you\'d want a high-value
target captured relatively intact (minus lots of bullet holes, laser burns,
and rpg craters :>).  If you\'ve got a concentration of bad guys on the
ground, and don\'t care about collateral damage or property values in the
area, just drop a rock (or a few of those orbital anti-personnel weapons
somebody mentioned) on them...  The troops would only be used for
commando-type missions where it was important not to turn the target into
the bottom of a crater.

        Expecting militaries at the level of sophistication being depicted
to function like 20th C militaries is like expecting modern air forces to
use 17th-century wet navy line-of-battle tactics.

Please excuse my ignorance here but what is the "planet-killer" problem? 
Are you refering to the fact that a fusion motor could be used to torch a 
city from orbit or that a well aimed freetrader starting out at Pluto\'s 
orbit and accelerating at 1G all the way could be used to destroy a 
planet. If this is the problem I don\'t think that there\'s any getting 
around it. It takes a finite amount of energy to boast a 
ship/missile/rock to velocities where if it even grazed a planet\'s 
atmosphere it would cause serious problems. In geological time it\'s a 
pretty common event to have largish rocks raining down on the surface of 
your homeworld. If I were the leader of a world with enough technology to 
build a system that would  predict and/or prevent such an event happening 
I would make it a high priority to build the system.

The fusion motor problem is difficult. In practice entropy says that most 
of the energy coming from a fusion motor or HEPlaR would be waste heat. 
If I didn\'t want my world to end up like Venus after a couple of hundred 
years I would make it illegal to use such a thing within my atmosphere. 
Just because it\'s illegal doesn\'t mean that people won\'t do it however so 
for this eventuallity you need to have enough teeth in the law to make 
the anyone think twice about it. The only way I can think of to keep this 
enforcable is with a big fleet of SDB\'s

As far as the ship/missile/rock at 0.1c problem goes you\'d need to about 
the same thing in place to shoot down anything big enough to do damage 
and small enough to shoot down. 

BTW: Assuming the Imperium is 10000 planets big and has a written history
1000 years long there is a 1/6 chance that a rock large enough to wipe out a
whole civilization has crashed on an one of these planets within 
the imperium\'s written history. I\'m extrapolationg this from the fact 
that it happened on Earth about 65 000 000 years ago or less.

[table snipped]

Well, even the FF&S text explains that the figures for area are not for a 
unitary (one-piece) sensor dish, but rather an array of smaller dishes 
spaced apart to simulate the aperture of a larger dish (which enables the 
sensor to \'resolve\' smaller objects at distance, but lacks the 
sensitivity of a single, large dish).  That\'s why there\'s a discrepancy 
between the figures for area given and pi * radius^2.

The modifiers are there to take into the account the effect that 
technology advances have on sensor efficiency; at higher tech levels, 
smaller dishes are required for the synthetic aperture array-- hence, 
less area is taken up at higher TLs.  If you still have questions, feel 
free to reread the section in FF&S on passive sensors.  I believe that 
there is even a sidebar (with illustration) which explains this point.

Well, the diameter of the synthetic aperture array is fixed by simple 
physics, not technology.  Unless you want to increase the minimum size of 
objects that you\'re able to resolve (not a good proposition if you\'re 
trying to establish fire control locks), you can\'t move the dishes of the 
array closer together and expect the same performance.

Of course, this might be fixed by some sort of gravitic focussing 
arrangement, as is done with lasers, but I\'ll leave that bit to the 
physics and optics experts.

Ok, let\'s see if I\'ve got it...

I\'ve got a ship that masses 200 tonnes, and some sort of thruster that
produces a low acceleration, say .01g. 

I accelerate out of orbit at .01g with my "zeta field\' off.  I turn
the "zeta field" on and my apparent mass drops to, say .2 tonnes, and
my acceleration jumps to, oh let\'s say 10g.  I build up a *healthy*
velocity, quickly travelling across the system.

Later, nearing my destination, I turn the "zeta field\' off.  My ship\'s
mass jumps back to 200 tonnes and my actual velocity immediately drops
to what it would have been if I\'d been
accelerating at .01g the entire time.  I flip the ship, turn on the
"zeta field" and *quickly* lose the rest of my acceleration. (No...I\'d
still have to flip at the halfway point and decelerate, correct?)

If I ram a planet with the "zeta field" on, it collapes and my
momentum (the energy I transfer to the planet) is only what I\'d have
built up accelerating at .01g.

...right?

My sister and brother-in-law are both paramedics (which in Alberta is a two
year course, plus required on-the-job training).  Both of them are _capable_
of stitching wounds, performing some emergency surgery, and prescribing some
medication.

In Canada, they would only do so in an emergency when there was no doctor
available (even over the radio) and it was necessary to save the patient\'s
life.

In the US, they wouldn\'t dare for fear of a lawsuit.  (In fact, travel in the
US poses interesting moral questions for Canadians used to our \'Good
Samaritan Act\'.)  

In much of the third world, they would do so on a routine basis, doctors
being in short supply, and lawyers being even scarcer.  

My key point is that there is a world of difference between being capable of
doing something and being officially qualified to do it.  After five years of
working at BNR I was still not officially qualified to teach computers,
because I lacked a one-month course required by the Ministry of Education. 
Last summer I discovered that the Registrar at the University of Toronto did
not consider courses in microprocessor design as being computer courses, so I
was not qualified to take a specialist course in computer studies (even
though everyone else, including the prof, admitted that I had the requisite
knowledge).


(As an aside, one of the English teachers at my last school went as an aid
worker to Africa, and ended up doing surgery.  He started out just helping
the doctor, but there were so many patients that he eventually did the
routine operations with only a look-in from the doctor - who was working on
someone else.  And this is with a BA in English!)

IG can make it official or no, but once I buy the darn thing I\'ll do

Yes, Yes!  You\'re right, they should put it in the book.

I don\'t worry too much about going back and forth from simple to

What! You mean they don\'t? <g>

Actually, I\'d sort of compare a B-52 bomb line as being similar to
line-of-battle..similar. <g>  

Speaking of drop-troops, I can see them being used to clean out an
hold a planethead until the regulars get down, to secure a target you
wanted to take, more-or-less, intact, as forward observers, and on
selective commando type missions.  

I used battledressed troopers one time as boarding parties in a
campaign that required ships to get close enough to actually grapple
and slug it out man to man. They launched across from their ship to
the enemy, hacked their way through the hull, and fought it out with
space axes (axe on one side, pick on the other, blaster down the
shaft) <g> 

Ok, this one was pure space opera, but we hadn\'t had any
"hack-n-slash" for a long time.  Everybody had a good time.

>By the way to what spectrum range is VLA in New Mexico tuned to?

It has a range of receivers, which operate from 300 to 50000 MHz.  It
can also be reconfigured, so that the effective diameter of the array
varies from 36 km down to 1 km.  The resolution (which radio
astronomerese is just the wavelength divided by the diameter) varies
from 850 arcsec (at 300 MHz in D array) to 0.05 arcsec (at 50 GHz in A
array).  There are other arrays which are larger (MERLIN has maximum
baselines of 200 km, I think VLBA starts at around 100 km and goes up
to 1000s).  All this stuff is on the web.  BTW radio telescopes are
unaffected by "seeing", so the best resolution (Global VLBI) can be
0.001 arcsec, and space VLBI will do even better in the next couple of
years.

>In aperature arrays does anyone know the optimum angle of incidence

Not sure what you mean by this; field of view?  Synthetic apertures
have a strange property which doesn\'t occur in single aperture
telescopes: they can only see structure up to the size sampled by the
smallest separation between the various radio dishes, i.e. anything
bigger will not be seen.

>What are the differances between a aperture synthesis array and a

If I understand this correctly, in a phased array the receivers can
point in different directions, and in addition can be "pointed"
electronically by fiddling with the phase delays between the
receivers.  I\'ve never used a phased array, so I\'m not sure of all the
advantages, although I suspect speed of tracking, and the ability to
look in more than one direction at once (by roatating the phase of the
signal) are two.  I remember my PhD supervisor saying that MERLIN,
which is a phase stable and real-time synthetic aperture could be used
for undetectable radar tracking, as the amount of power neccesary to
detect an aircraft is less than that coming off the palm of the hand.

It\'s not the heat death actually happening right then (factually 
ending the game at the start), but rather the aspect of impending 
doom in another (maybe) 500000 years. The background temp of the 
universe is rising already, coloring space reddish, causing massive 
climatical changes on almost all worlds, maybe hyperspace distortions 
all over, causing Misjumps to be the rule rather than the exception. 
So rather than letting it all end with The Next Generation (pardon 
the pun), it is more likely to be a scenario of inescapable doom 
which is still a long time away from 
becoming THE END, but with already showing deadly effects.
The inhabitants of the area trying to find a way OUT of the Universe, 
into a new one.

There has been a 50 issue cyclus of a german Sci-Fi series which 
actually used this scenario (with the main protagonist ending up in 
the other universe by accident and trying to find a way back, while 
helping the races to transfer out the galaxy into the other universe 
(causing lost of new problems there), all the time fighting a cult of 
fatalists, who believe they will be reincarated in a new form after 
the fiery death, and thusly trying to speed the inevirtable process 
up even further by aquiring more stellar mass from elsewhere. Sounds 
well ahead of actual traveller tech, but assuming that this takes 
place well ahead of Traveller time, it should be logical that such 
means should exist by then.

In any way, it would be a fantastic new background for Traveller, 
with loads of new adventures.

        Exactly.  Once you\'ve attained orbital superiority you use your
positional advantage to wipe out any facilities of use to the enemy that you
don\'t care enough about to want to capture...  So you start dropping rocks
on them.

        This is a perfect example of the sort of target that you\'d want to
capture relatively intact, assuming that you want anything on the planet
intact, that is...:).  And this is the sort of thing that you would want to
use troops for.  We\'re agreeing 100% so far.

        I would think that suppressing enemy airpower would be part of
obliterating enemy targets with rocks, above.  Airbases, fuelling
facilities, and the like ought to be visible from orbit, and easy targets
for rocks, nukes, what have you...  Again, I see attainment of orbital
superiority as followed by the step of wiping out anything that you don\'t
want that could hurt your infantry, and I see enemy air defense as part of this.

        Basically, I would argue that you drop the PBI in only after
everything with enemy markings bigger than a Matchbox car that isn\'t sitting
on something you *HAVE* to take intact is at the bottom of a big smoking
crater...  It\'s guaranteed that you\'re going to miss something (the bad guys
will have course have dug in), but that\'s why you\'re sending in decoys, etc,
with the first wave of PBI.  Anything that rears its head at this stage gets
rocks dropped on it.

        Agreed.  I think that we\'re on the same wavelength here; only thing
is is that I saw the plan of attack in the original post as dropping
infantry _before_  the preparatory bombardment stage...

While I treasure _Starship Troopers_ as one of my favourite Sci-Fi novels, I 
personally can\'t see anyone with half a brain being willing to be sealed inside 
a tiny capsule (claustrophobic hell) and then fired as an uncontrolled missile 
into space, through the nightmare of re-entry, and down through a hostile 
atmosphere where the locals are throwing everything in the panetary arsenal at 
them. Decoys aside, the chances of any survivors ( including the most die-hard 
rollercoaster fanatic ) being willing to do it twice would be virtually nil. 

My personal opinion is that the movie ALIENS go it about right, with the concept 
of a "Drop Ship". This is a highly manouverable, armoured shuttle capable of 
holding either troops or vehicles ( kinda like a space version of the C-130 
Hercules ). It has VTOL capability, and allows the options of delivery directly 
to the surface, or high altitude delivery of "Drop Troops" via parachute, 
grav-belt, or flying powered armour. Using a ship to re-enter an atmosphere 
would improve safety, morale, and comfort. And makes sense since someone has to 
land and pick up the troops later anyway. Armed Drop Ships could act as Airborne 
command posts, and provide fire support to the troops on the ground, as well as 
medevac services. 

And they\'re cheaper to operate than Heinlens disposable Drop Capsules, and don\'t 
require special tubes or other non-standard services on starships.

Thats my two cents worth,
Simon.

You\'ve got it.

It is very important to note that the "zeta field" generator

Phil, I am in the bring back CT camp and I don\'t feel the way you do.  I
don\'t see the handwriting.  Other than FF&S, I haven\'t seen anything that
resembles TNE, and things that are more CT like. 

Now for FF&S.  The "science" in FF&S was good, I never argued that point.
The problem with FF&S is "English".  It is poorly layed out, over uses
non-standard abbreviations, and generally makes life too complex -- before
the science.

What are we getting and what was learned?  We are getting three -- very
compatible -- design sequences.  One is a simple "You pick it -- you build it"
system very similar to CT Book 2.  One is more advanced similar to MT
Referee\'s Manual, again Chart Based, but more details.  The final is FF&S
that will hopefully be written coherently.

Also, some game critical things are being changed.  HEPlaR drives are still
there, but are considered low space tech (which makes sense).  But a
reactionless "Thruster Plate" drive pops in for the higher tech stuff.  What
it comes down to is I can still run around for a month with out having to
refuel.

But everything else still looks CT\'ish.

Both. The first can only be stopped by not letting civilians with fusion
rockets anywhere near planets, space stations, shipping lanes, etc. This
implies that there is an alternative (likely one that is cheaper and/or
outperforms fusion rockets). The second can only be stopped if there is
some mechanism to limit the kinetic energy imparted to the ship.

There may be other ways to limit the ship\'s kinetic energy (e.g., speed
limits :-), but another common "given" in Traveller is high acceleration.
Without some sort of "mass neutralizer", truly *tremendous* amounts of
energy will be regularly applied to thrust. Find another way to harness
this energy and you still have a planet-killer. Worse yet, there has long
been a "free energy" problem, where M-drives attain speeds that cannot be
justified by the amount of fuel spent, (i.e., 0.5*(ship mass)*(speed**2)
is greater than the amount of energy spent).

Meteors do not reach the speeds commonly achieved by Trav ships. The
planet-killers are likely very large meteors, not extremely fast ones.
They also cannot actively evade your attacks like spaceships can.

This means nothing to a civilian ship willing to use its fusion rockets
to torch a city. You must keep ships with fusion rockets well away from
your planet. Yet in Traveller, civilian ships regularly land on planets,
dock at stations, etc. Therefore, they must not use fusion rockets (at
least not ones that are capable of that kind of destruction).

Precisely. And yes, you would probably turn around halfway.

An astute observer might notice that there is still an energy gap due
to the fact that kinetic energy increases with the square of velocity.
This could be addressed by having the acceleration drop off as your
speed goes up or by explaining it away through the nature of the field,
which could:
o somehow sidestep the KE=0.5*(mass)*(velocity**2) rule, or
o require extra energy to compensate for the difference (which will be
  shed as waste heat when the field is turned off).

First of all, it would be illogical to put the Maya, Inca, North
American Indian and he Aztecs in the same explanation.  Each had
completely different situations.  Mayan culture was well on the
decline before the Spanish.  Inca cultures had lots of problems
with the rising continent, causing the rivers to sink lower and
lower destroying the irrigation systems which had to be re-built
again and again at no small cost.
 
And I wouldn\'t say the Maya never got beyond the stone age.
Merely that they had perfected a non-metalic society which
worked.  Evidence shows that they had clearly invented the
wheel for instance, (It can be seen on several children\'s
toys) but never used it as (1) the notion of riding beasts
of burden was not thought of and (2) going through mountains
and forrests is not conductive to wheels.  They never ivented
the arch either, but they managed to do a pretty good cheat
for their entranceways.  They prefected an extreemely good
calendar, charted the cycles not only of the sun, the moon,
but venus as well.  (For some reason in the Americas it was
venus that was the planet of war, not mars.)

Actually it had to do with their calendar system, which was passed from
one group to another.  Unlike other civilizations who saw cycles in the
days, months, seasons, the Maya expanded it to many many cycles.  When
they reset, a new creation occured.  The Aztects were going through such
a time and were expecting something to happen.  In addition, they already
had some legends about someone leaving to the east saying that he would
return.  The Spanish were just plain lucky.

The American Indian is another story.  But they didn\'t just roll over
and play dead either.  They had to be pushed, prodded, killed, etc.
to get them to leave.

Having BEEN a grunt, I whole heartedly agree with you on point b. ;>)
This makes sence.  If you doubt it, just look at what we did in the middle
east a few years back.  Let the Air Force clean up everything we can find
(and some things that we can\'t) to really soften them up BEFORE sending in
the troops.  Yes, the troops still have to fight, but they can do a much
better job without worrying about enemy air droping big nasties on their
heads.  Besides, the humbling effect of having most of your high tech stuff
trashed has a decided effect on the defender\'s morale (they either give up,
or cop a really ugly attitude).

Thanks for the fun.  I personally was getting tired of Komet, Skill

this is a Trav list.

OK, I stand corrected.  Still the range of things that an EMT is

If not, how will skills/tasks be resolved? The "Classic Trav" method?
Something different?

I\'d like to recommend a line of books for Traveller inspiration. It even has
an apparently flat universe!

Take a look at the "Honor Harrington" books by David Weber. There are five (I
think) in paperback and a new one just out in hardcover. The titles are:

On Basilisk Station
The Honor of the Queen
The SHort Victorious War
Field of Dishonor
Flag in Exile
(hardcover, don\'t know the title)

...and are all from Baen Books in the US.

They trace the career of one Honor Harrington through (and out of) the Royal
Manticoran Navy. Although the technology is different from Traveller (it
seems to be a cross between C.J. Cherryh and Babylon 5 in some respects), a
lot of details on the ship structure, command, Marines, pinnaces, cutters,
battles, high tech vs. primitives, etc., will fit right into Traveller...

Isn\'t this funny.  I was just talking to one of my other friends yesterday,
and he said he wasn\'t excited about T4 because it was simply CT with a
little spit & polish.  He is still hopeful about the project, but is worried
about the potential outcome.  He isn\'t as paranoid as Phil here, but he\'s on
the other side of the spectrum!!!

Phil never ceases to amaze me!!  Unless he\'s been privy to a lot of
information that I haven\'t seen, he\'s throwing away something he really
enjoys because he _THINKS_ it wont be any good.  This is amazing!!  I\'ve
seen pessimism, but this is truly incredible!!  "I just know that it is
going to be aweful, so I\'m quitting before I start!"  Now we know where all
those conspiracy theories come from . . . Phil must just be paranoid.

Phil, just in case you\'ve stuck around for long enough to get this message,
let me be the second to tell you (I\'m sure your psychiatrist was first)...
        "The world really is not out to get you!!!"


(If, perchance, all of this babble of mine is nonsense because Phil did get
a look at T4, I want to know how I can get that same look!!)

Another *major* difference between "medical" and "first aid" is that a
doctor/nurse type expects to be doing things in a medical facility,
with all kinds of gear and supplies handy. A first aider/paramedic is
used to having to make do with what he\'s got.

For example:

Player: "I think my ankle\'s broken"

Medical type: "Take him to X-ray... Oh. Right... Do we have splints? 
Okay, splint it and get him on a stretcher..."

First aid type: (Carefully feeling ankle) "I think it\'s just sprained.
We\'ll wrap it anyway, and I\'ll check it at the next break. Let me know
if the pain gets worse"

When someone is hurt, a first aid type is often better to have than a
medical type. *After* the first aid type has dealt with the initial
problem, then the victim is better off with a medical type if he needs
more treatment.

You want a medical type in sick bay. You want a first aid type on a
landing party. And trust me... most medical types don\'t have very good
first aid skills. Not much better than your average boy scout with a
first aid merit badge. I\'d make Med-1 and First-aid-1 interchangeable.
After that, they diverge too much. ER staff have *both* med *and* First
Aid.

Noty all are (or were) simple. And the ones that tried to be realistic
didn\'t do well. <sigh>. Still games like Chivalry & Sorcery gave us
nice reference works for when we *did* want to be realistic.

Doesn\'t help as much as you think. Now, instead of getting kinetic
energy for free, you are getting *potential* energy for free. And that
can be converted to kinetic energy thru gravity.

Simple example. I use your "zeta field" drive to lift a 100 ton rock
out to the 100 diameter point *ahead* of the planet in its orbit. When
I turn off the drive, and let go of the rock, it will be moving slowly
away from the planet. But, between the planet\'s gravity, and its
20-30km/s orbital velocity, that rock (only a few meters in diameter,
btw) is going to hit like a multikiloton bomb.

Nope. Consider. The exhaust from a Saturn V has *more* energy (at 6
million pounds thrust) than the exhuast from your free trader. But it
is confined to a relatively small area. As the Isp goes up, for the
same thrust, the exhaust velocity goes up AND THE MASS FLOW AND JET
CROSS SECTION GO DOWN. 

Sure, the ship can cause quite a mess by "hovering" on the drive flame
and use steering jets to "walk" the flame across thing they don\'t like.
But not anyplace where people can shoot back. And it\'s a tricky
manuever at best.

As a good example of this, pick up a copy of the *book* M*A*S*H. There
are several instances there of having to "retrain" new doctors to quit
being so "careful". Their job was to patch the wounded up enough to
survive being hauled to a real hospital, farther behind the lines.
Being too careful meant that another patient *died* while you were
"prettying up" the one on the table.

We never experimented with it. Project Thor was a proposal that never

There are *very* few targets that merit dropping an entire asteroid on
them. :-) Remember, Meteor Crater in Arizona was made by a body only a
few *meters* across. 

But you have hit on an important point. There\'s no reason to use nukes.
Not only are they expensive, but they dirty up territory that you are
trying to capture.

You\'ll also want bigger items for taking out the *really* hardend
targets. A 3 meter chunk of nickel iron weighs over 100 tonnes. At 9
km/sec, that\'s around a kiloton of impact energy. At 30 km/sec it\'s
around 10 kT. A few of those would even get the attention of someplace
like Cheyenne Mountain. :-)

BTW, an interesting bit of data. The ideal time for a force still
orbiting the star (rather than the planet) to launch a space-to-ground
strike is at local dawn! Why? Because then you get the planet\'s orbital
velocity *added* to the impact velocity for free. For Earth, that\'s
around 26 km/s. 

>From planetary orbit, there isn\'t any preferred time. Though if the
space junk isn\'t too bad, you may want the bombardment ships in a
retrograde orbit. It\'ll give a slight boost in impact velocities, and
*drastically* shorten their apparent orbital period (ie they\'ll pass
over a given spot on the ground more often).

This reminds me of a little bit of "life experience". I\'ve had all of
15 minutes experience driving a tracked vehicle (D-6 cat). But without
someone experienced showing me, I\'d have taken a *long* time to figure
out some of the simpler "tricks" to driving one.

For those who haven\'t had the pleasure, you drive a tracked vehicle
with *two* throttles and two brake pedals. brakes control the track on
the same side. Throttles are center is "neutral", forward is forward,
and back is backward. Again, for the track on that side.

Newbie: turns by advancing throttle on outside track
Green: turns by putting inside track to neutral *and* braking
Expert: Turns by putting one track in reverse and the other forward.

Newbies turn in wide turns. Green operators turn in about the length of
the vehicle. Experts spin the cehicle around its center. :-)

I rather imagine that grav vehicles are closer to tracked vehicles than
to wheeled vehicles, but not especially close to either...

Which means that I can take them all out with one shot from the right
kind of artillery or even a decent sized mortar. Being spread out on
the ground makes you a *much* less tempting target. And it makes it
less worth wasting artillery rounds on you.

Ya but all it takes is one guy with a SAM and you can kiss twenty marines,
their battle dress, the lander and any vehicals good-bye.  The odds of
hitting a paratrooper under canapy are pretty remote, it\'s the old golden BB
theory.  Throw every thing you\'ve got at them and hope you hit something.

True about the Mayan\'s.  Internal warfare destroyed them.  And the Inca
build irregation systems which, with a little cleaning, are still in use
today.  The cost didn\'t matter to the Inca\'s, it\'s not like they payed the
people who build those things.  All they had to do was feed them.

The Maya\'s were horribly advanced in their way\'s, no denying it and as for
stone work, they we masters of both mansonry and flint knapping.

There was a lot more to it than simply saying it was a bad day on the
calender.  They were waiting for the return of Quetzalcoatl.  And as you\'ve
said the Spanish were just plain lucky they ventured in on the right day.
The fact of the matter was there was a lot of things going on that we will
never fully comprehend.  What was this discussion about again?  Technology
or something wasn\'t it?

Absolutly true again.  The fact is though because they\'re not a european
culture we tend to look rather dimly upon their technological acheivements,
which were substantial.  But thats a discussion I\'d rather not get into cuz
you\'ll never shut me up about the indigenous peoples of the americas.

Because lobbing rocks down from orbit, and detonating nukes in the
atmosphere, while sound from a military point of view have a tendency to
produce counter productive results at home.  There\'s nothing wrong with
killing soldiers as far as the GP is concerned but killing civilians is
another story entierly.  And despite the best military coverups these things
have a way of getting out and once they do it becomes more and more
difficult for the military to do it\'s job effectively.

There\'s something I think we\'d all like to know.  How the skills system
works.  Forget the skills themselves for now, how the hell do you actually
bust open a lock, use a computer, fly a grav sled or resolve combat?

I agree totally I\'d rather see a complete system to begin with rather than
having to hunt through a hundred different modules to find what it is that I
need.

"Now lets see where was that data on Imperial Podiatrist character generation?
Book 8?  No...  Book 52?  no  damn it.  HARRY!  WHERE\'S THE PODIATRIST?  I

Actually, I\'m turning an about face on this 1 as well.  I\'d be more 
for a comprehensive skills list than a short truncated 1 to be added 
to at a later date.  Once new GM\'s get a hold on the task system, most of the 
skills are pretty self-explanatory.  The learning curve has a light 
slope to it.

    'body' => 'Hi all.  I\'d like to know what you think of this idea.  I think it might
provide a happy middle ground between those who want seperate skills for
".38 pistol, snub nose, TL8" as opposed to ".38 pistol, not snub, TL8" and
those who just want one skill called "Fighting".  

The idea is similar to Shadowrun (no! no! keep reading!  It\'s not that
bad!) where they have a fairly small list of basic skills and then allow
you to pick a specialization if you wish.  You can stay a generalist and
get level-2 skill in all firearms, or you can specialize so that you get
level-3 in pistol but level-1 in all other weapons.  

Basically, if you get skill of a particular level, you can stay a 
generalist and get that level of expertise in all aspects of the field, 
or you can specialize, getting (level * 1.5) in your specialty and (level 
*.5) in all other areas.  Specific values are open to modification, of 
course, but I\'d like to know what people think of the idea in general.

This does not make skills more complex in any way.  All one does is give a
skill description and list a bunch of suggestions for specialties at the
end of it. The GM decides when a specialty applies to any given
situation.  For instance, Medical (to bring up a hot topic), might look
like this: 

Medical:  This skill deals will all aspects of caring for the sick and 
injured, including emergency medical treatment (blah, blah, blah)...
	Specialties:  First Aid, Surgery, Ophthalmology, etc...

When playing, the GM would determine if say Dr. Bob, Medical-4 
(podiatry), could use his skill at its specialty level (6) or would have 
to use it at his non-specialty level (2).

Example:

GM:  "Well, Toby has fallen down the well and broken his ankle.  What do 
you do?"

Dr. Bob: "Toby!  I\'m coming to get you!  Hang on!"

GM:  "Okay, you lower yourself down the well.  What now?"

Dr. Bob: "I fix his ankle!  I roll a 10, +6 for my skill, and get a 16!"

GM: "Sorry, this is First Aid, you only get +2."

Dr. Bob: "But it\'s his foot!"

GM: "Well...okay...I\'ll allow it."

(Of course, another GM doesn\'t have to be so lenient... :-)

True.  Wasn\'t thinking in that direction.  I was actually pointing out that
with modern parachuting equipment it\'s possible to get everyone as close
together or as far appart as you want.  And with troopers in powered battle
dress with tac-com and such I really don\'t think the guy\'s on the ground,
unless they know exactly where you\'re landing are going to be able to put up
much of a fight.  One man in battle dress can easily wade through a half
dozen grunts providing none of them have panzerfausts.  Ain\'t battle dress
wonderful?

The well developed background should be left to the GM to create.
Classic Travellers greatest strength was that no explainations
were given.  All the rules were mere frameworks upon which the
GM could build consistant roleplaying situations.

In what way was Next Errors character creation system stronger than Classic 
Travellers system?  Or do you mean that the system gave charators more skills?

>reactionless drives!

Actually, my point is that the rules shouldn\'t give me reactionless drives!
I feel that explaining the technology should be left up to the GM as
part of their own campaign background!  If reactionless drives are 
part of IGs published background I have no problem with that.  Look at
what happened when GDW made a guess on computer technology in book 2.
The rules should explain how the MDrive is used, not what the MDrive is!

If that were true than GDW would still be publishing Next Error source 
books with page after page of nothing but pictures of grav tanks.

That poll again!  62 people do not consitute \'most folks\'.  Any survey that
asks people to respond is neither accurate or meaningfull.  Especially
if the sample group is small (such as internet users who like to read
Traveller mailing list).

Good features?  MT was nothing more than an error ridden reprint of material
for CT that had appeared in JTAS and elsewhere.  With the expection of
blending background with basic rules MT offered nothing new to the game.

Next Error was a complete rewrite of the rules and a further mixing of
background and framework.  And while the T$R lawsuit hurt GDW they lost
because only a \'few gear heads\' had any interest in their games.

Small pox and plague came after the Spanish arrived not before.  
The Aztec were already expecting death.  The Spanish just arrived
at an opertune moment (for them, not the Aztecs).

I\'ll admit I was nit picking.  Logic would dictate that Medical-1 gives the
charator more knowledge than Pistol-1.  However, I was just pointing out
that skills are not so easily defined as to the limit of what knowledge they
do provide to the charator.

    'body' => 'A common thread in the various ongoing discussion of orbital bombardment, 
jump troops, and so forth has been the question:  Why not just drop a 
Great Big Rock (tm) and be done with it?  As someone pointed out, being 
at the top of a gravity well gives the attacker a huge potential (pardon 
the pun) advantage; he can create havoc on the planetary surface simply 
by deorbiting random hunks o\'junk in appropriate places.

The questions here, though, concern the attackers goals, and the "rules 
of war."  The question of goals is easier to address.  If I jump into 
Quafnome system with the goal of removing it as a source of materiel to 
my enemy, then (after dealing with local defenses) my task is simple.  
Gather N big rocks, push them over toward the mainworld, wait, watch 
fireworks, go home.  A typical world could be utterly neutralized -- 
cities in rubble, major transport hubs replaced by nice fresh craters, 
seacoast towns swept away by tsunamis -- using only a few dozen 
medium-sized rocks.  (Note that rock-pushing gets *much* harder under 
fuel-limited HEPlaR rules, but it appears that they\'re not canon 
anymore.  Whee!).

However, suppose my goal is to capture the world (more or less) intact? 
There are many scenarios where this would be the case; I may wish to use
the enemy starport as a forward base, or perhaps the system I\'m invading
is one that has been taken by the enemy which i\'m trying to liberate. 
This greatly diminishes the appeal of rock-dropping.  Instead, I have to
find a way to gain control of the world without massively damaging surface
installations.  This calls for a difficult surgical attack of the type
described by my brother Doug.  To reiterate, the basic sequence is: 

1. Gain space superiority.
2. Suppress ground defenses using ortillery.
3. Land jump troops to clear a landing zone.
4. Land grav combat vehicles to defend and expand perimeter.
5. Land support units (repair, medical, commo, and so forth) to
   enable offensive actions out of perimeter.

In a large attack, this same sequence might be playing out simultaneously 
at several points on the surface (analogous with the five-beach attack 
plan of the Normandy landings).

Note that, as Doug pointed out, there is an ongoing synergy between 
ortillery and ground troops.  The ortillery clears an area safe enough 
(barely) for the first jumpers to go in; these troops then serve as FOs 
for further bombardment as targets present themselves.

Now we come to the nebulous Rules of War.  One might imagine that, just 
as we\'ve restrained ourselves from lobbing nukes at one another for 50 
years here on Terra, future societies might tacitly or explicitly agree 
that wholesale devastation of planetary surfaces using raw kinetic energy 
bombs is a Bad Thing.  One can imagine various War Departments making 
secret plans on how to push rocks around should it come to that, but 
being restrained by political considerations from ever actually doing 
so.

Anyway, just my inflation-adjusted $0.73...

        A rod of depleted uranium, anywhere from 1 to 5 m long, and about
1/10 to 1/6 as wide. Fins on the back, simple seeker head on the front. No
"blast" as in explosives ... the kinetic energy of the impact will do quite
enough, thank you.

Actually that\'s not true.  If you study the effect of disease upon the
native population of NA.  I\'ve written several papers on the subject.  We
find that there was a huge collapse of society in around 1000 AD, now we may
think that this is all well and good but when we look at it.  It was only a
short while before hand, can\'t remember the exact date anymore, that the
vikings first landed in Newfoundland.  Remember the black plague spread
across Europe like wild fire, and this in a fairly sedentry population, in
north america, where the average tribe travelled about hundreds or thousands
of square kilometers.  The potential for social interactions with dozens of
tribes is not unlikely.  This is 400 years before columbus set foot in the
new world.

This makes a distinction regarding the projection of current tactics
and technology. IMO, which isn\'t worth much, drop troops would have a
very good chance of making it to the surface. The size of the object
and the stealth features you build into them would greatly enhance
their survivability. 

Consider a 0 Millineum attempt to subdue a lower tech world (say, TL9).
They want the government and collateral damage to be low. Send in the
special forces, drop troops, to seize political objectives and hold
government hostage. The surprise that the technology difference would
cause would force the indigents to reconsider; especially a population
with little or no military/aggressive traditions.

Using today\'s concept of total war, yeah, blow em to pieces and rebuild
later. On planetary scales, I do not think this is feasible. The Soviet
Union\'s military developed a concept just prior to their break up that
total war as envisioned at the time was *unwinable*, so why fight it.
In limited war contexts, especially with technology differences, the
jump troop (in flaming capsule) will have its place.

I for one will have drop troop ships for this reason.

This is incredible, since I was having the same feelings, only in
reverse. That I would be getting CT with a thin veneer of TNE. 

However, I am not so fatalistic and closed minded to shut out any
potential benefit that T4 has to offer. 

I will not cancel advance orders. I believe that Traveller represents
the industries best shot at science fiction RPGs. Therefore, I will
support T4 as I supported CT AND TNE.

Just check out any modern tank gun footage versus other armored
vehicles and multiply by about a 1000. for non-armored targets, IMO, a
blast effect would occur as the vaporized solids at the point of impact
expand due to the energy transfer. Modern antitank projectiles actually
cause the armor they hit to turn liquid and fly about the compartments,
igniting fuel, ammo etc. I expect that the same effects would happen
with HVKKP, Hypervelocity Kinetic Kill Projectiles.

Research has been done on this and I suggest you check out:

http//info.arl.mil/EA/armorar.html

for some advance armor stuff (KKP).

Exactly, that is why Wheeled Vehicle and Tracked Vehicle are different
skills.  Some functions are the same, i.e. you don\'t want to drive one over
the cliff.  For the most part, knowing how to drive a Semi in no way
qualifies you for Bulldozer work (I can speak form experince growing up with
a father who built
a good chunk of I-75 through KY and have driven bulldozers, and back hoes and 
other large machinery a lot growing up.)  Tracked and wheeled are so
drastically different that only a little bit of the skills are portable.
However the skill set for driving a semi is built upon the more basic
driving skills of the family station wagon.  Thus different skill levels in
the same skill (while keeping it simple).

First Aid and Medic are different, but not enough to warrent the same skill,
particularly because it doesn\'t have a real game effect.  We don\'t complain
about the lack of Electronics Operations and Electronics Repair.  One is
just a more advanced level than the other.   If you are going to break down
one skill like First Aid and Medic, then you need to do them all.  Everyone
will like having a game with a 500 skills of which they all default to
something else.

To me, this sounds *very* reasonable. Those who want it can use it (I 
will), those who don\'t can ignore it. Characters created for both 
systems are of equal proficiency once one adds/ignores the cascade, 
and have exactly the same amount of skills/levels.

True. ;-)

Even if the government isn\'t responsive it will still have a huge effect
upon moral and public opinion and that can be devestating.  Besides that
propigating a war of this style, especially in an uncertian envrionment,
such as those contained in T4 or TNE can have counter productive results.
Imagine the reputation the Coalition would have if they worked in this
manner.  Imaging how difficult it would be to get even moderatly friendly
worlds to trust you and what do you do if you run into someone more powerful
than you?  If you\'ve got a rep as the destroyer of planets, raper of worlds,
scourge of the skies and generally all around rotten guy, can you expect
better treatment from these people?  Probably not.  People don\'t forget that
kind of stuff.  And when it all comes around they\'ll do the same thing to you.

Operations of this kind were refered to as the BLACK WAR during the
rebellion and the effect on the civilion population was devestating.

Will there be any modifications done to the World Building tables, etc. for T4?
Most of the old data (eg: GDW\'s "Spinward Marches Campaign") list conflicting
UWP data such as low-tech planets with average (ie: 5-7) atmosphere &
hydrosphere ratings, orbiting an M6-V class star with *no* habitable orbit
possible (from the charts from either TNE or Book 5: Scouts, anyways).  I\'m
getting tired of trying to explain to my players how/why a perfectly Terran-like
planet can exist orbiting a single sub-dwarf star.

Population codes should also be linked to surface area-- except possibly on high
tech worlds-- to prevent the existence of a planet like Rethe (2408) in the SWM
with a UWP of "E230AA8-8...323...G7-V".  According to the UWP this system has a
population of 30 billion inhabitants living on a rock with approximately 32
million square kilometres of usable surface area (and possessing only a trace
atmosphere & virtually no water).  This translates to an *average density* of
nearly 1,000 persons per square kilometre!  With a tech level of only 8, they
couldn\'t have created that many space-based colonies yet.  Perhaps it has
something to do with their Charismatic Dictator  8-)

I realize that Traveller has a higher frequency of habitable planets and did
stem from a system where planets were generated first (the rest of the solar
system had to wait for Book 5).  I\'m just suggesting a population limit and/or
modifier based on planetary size.

        If you\'re using depleted uranium, it also has the nifty side-effect
of being "pyrophoric" -- when it hits, it vaporizes ... and the vapor itself
is highly explosive.

        Of course, coming from orbit at 12 km/s that\'s not important ...

While I personally hate these sorts of arguments (waste of bandwidth,
really), having just read Heinlein\'s book _Starship Troopers_ for the
first time a few days ago, I feel somewhat obliged to toss in my two
bits on this subject. Frankly, Heinlein does a great job in explaining
why drop capsules are much safer than drop ships. Granted, their
disposable aspect will also make them more expensive, but for those
dangerous drops where you just know the enemy is gonna be firing at
everything in the sky, you\'re a lot better off if you separate your
troops over a wide area so at least a few make it to the surface. Remember,
with the suit which each these guys is wearing, they\'re each like a
heavily armored combat helocopter with tactical nukes. One dude can
raise a lot of hell. Now, in situations where you\'ve already destroyed
the enemy\'s surface-to-air threat, using a drop ship is just fine. But
to use it otherwise is to invite disaster. A drop ship will stick out
like a sore thumb on radar. A drop capsule, on the otherhand,
surrounded by dozens of decoys, is going to be a heck of a lot
safer. You want to take out that trooper, you\'d better use a nuke,
because you\'re not gonna find him otherwise.

I\'m gonna quote two paragraphs just to hammer in this point. These
are from only a few pages into the book, by the way. Heinlein puts
you into the thick but quick.

   The outer shell burned away and sloughed off-- unevenly, for
   I tumbled. Then the rest of it went and I straightened out.
   The turbulence brakes of the second shell bit in and the ride
   got rough... and still rougher as they burned off one at a
   time and the second shell began to go to pieces. One of the
   things that helps a capsule trooper to live long enough to
   draw a pension is that the skins peeling off his capsule not
   only slow him down, they also fill the sky over the target
   area with so much junk that radar picks up reflections from
   dozens of targets for each man in the drop, any one of which
   could be a man, or a bomb, or anything. It\'s enough to give
   a ballistic computer nervous breakdowns-- and does.
      To add to the fun, your ship lays a series of dummy eggs
   in the seconds immediately following your drop, dummies that
   will fall faster because they don\'t slough. They get under
   you, explode, throw out "window," even operate as transponders,
   rocket sideways, and do other things to add to the confusion
   of your reception committee on the ground.

In short, it\'s a great book, and it\'s not just about combat and
military life. Heinlein also gives the reader a good dose of
human behavioral and political philosophy, including an exposition
by one of the protagonist\'s classroom instructors as to the reasons
why the democracies of the 20th century self-destructed due to a
flawed social theory. As for aliens, Heinlein puts humanity at war
with a race of bugs which were probably the inspiration for 2300AD\'s
Kafer, so if you\'re a 2300AD player, you\'ll probably like the book
on that count besides all the others. But I digress. It\'s a good
read. \'Nuff said.

 I have - the Police Academy.  In fact, there are two such classes,
 a basic one for the uniformed officer who has to be able to
 observe the key information in an incident, and a more advanced
 one for the detective, who has to look for clues for an incident
 that happened out of direct observation.

 Other places where I would expect classes in observation to be
 given would include Intelligence (Field Operative) training, and
 Counterintelligence (Field Operative) training.  I\'m sure that
 others can thing of other places, and I\'m sure that there are many
 occasions where observation training is not explicitly given, but
 is included in some other training - medicine or archaeology
 suggest themselves to me.

 Think about it - if you ask six random witnesses about a car
 accident (don\'t give them opportunity to compare stories) you\'ll
 get six different stories that will be difficult to reconcile.
 But ask six random _cops_ that witnessed the same accident (don\'t
 give them a chance to compare stories, either), and they\'ll agree
 pretty closely. It\'s been tested. The difference is that the cops
 have been trained to observe.

 Even a hundred years ago it was known - (from Sir Arthur Conan
 Doyle, "A Scandal in Bohemia"):

        "I could not help laughing at the ease with which he
        explained his process of deduction. \'When I hear you give
        your reasons,\' I remarked, \'the thing always appears to me
        to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it
        myself, though at each successive instance of your
        reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process.  And
        yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.\'

        "\'Quite so,\' he answered, lighting a cigarette, and
        throwing himself down into an armchair. \'You see, but you
        do not observe.  The distinction is clear.  For example,
        you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the
        hall to this room.\'

        "\'Frequently.\'

        "\'How often?\'

        "\'Well, some hundreds of times.\'

        "\'Then how many are there?\'

        "\'How many?  I don\'t know.\'

        "\'Quite so!  You have not observed.  And yet you have seen.
        That is just my point.  Now, I know that there are
        seventeen steps, because I have both seen and
        observed....\'"

 Now, one could argue that minutiae such as portrayed in the
 example are irrelevant, trivial, and so forth.  But it is by
 practicing on the trivial that one trains oneself - i.e., develops
 the skill - to spot the equally insignificant things that turn out
 _not_ to be trivial.

Only if "mass nullifying" applies to gravitic effects as well, which
I never claimed. It need only affect apparent mass for the sake of
kinetic energy. This is a good point, though. Anti-gravity devices
have the same problem if you treat them as simply nullifying gravity.
They must also require extra energy equalling the gained potential
energy if you use them to help lift an object.

Exactly. These high Isp drives have a low cross-section, but this
merely concentrates the same amount of energy in a smaller area and
for a much greater distance. Thus, *any* ship can wreak havoc on a
city from orbit. Or destroy a space station. You\'re right that it\'s
not actually a "planet-killer", but it just doesn\'t fit in with the
"feel" of Traveller, IMHO.

> But not anyplace where people can shoot back.

Attacking a planet or station is not an action to be taken lightly.
Yet if there is even the slightest chance of civilian ships doing
this, they would not be allowed anywhere near either. Every one of
them would have to be treated as a potential military threat. If
thruster plates don\'t pose this type of threat, then this level of
security need only apply to ships with fusion rockets, nasty-looking
weapons, *big* rocks in tow, etc. :-)

Classic Traveller charaters are not static.  It is possible for
them to gain new skills.  They can find other esoteric methods such
as RNA intelligence or education implants, surgical alterations, 
military or mercenary training, sabbaticals or through self-improvement.

Why would I want to \'purchase this puppy\' if it\'s filled with useless

Charles,

It sounds like a good idea...IF what you\'re talking about won\'t mean a 
lot of new skills.  That is, if we can have a top-level skill of 
"Researcher" then a cascade of all the different areas of research, I\'m 
all for it.  But if what you\'re proposing includes the idea of having 
top-level skills like "Theology," "Computer Science," etc. with cascades 
under /then/, it would still require a massive skill list, which I oppose.

I think this could be done in the former way, so it sounds like a really 
good idea.  True, it is a departure from the way Traveller does things, 
but . . . .

\'course, since T4 is very close to going to the printer, this whole 
discussion is probably moot. :P

Lest the lists become bogged down in the pessimism recently expressed 
herein, I\'d like to let everyone know that I am very, very optimistic 
that T4 will turn out to be the system almost everyone here can agree on 
using.  There will be a few CT, MT, and T:NE hold-outs, undoubtedly.  
But I think T4 will unify the disparate factions of Traveller players, and 
allow us to work together to create better gaming experiences, to the 
greatest extent since CT.  

If T4 had abandoned FF&S entirely, a large group of players (the 
gearheads) would have been left out.  Thankfully, Mr. Golden and IG, 
along with Derek Wildstar, came up with a series of solutions that will 
satisfy all of our tastes...while allowing us to exchange designs, no 
matter which of the three ship design systems we use.  

Including FF&S in three forms was /not/ a negative thing.  It was an 
overwhelming plus for /us/.  It was an inclusive move by IG, and they 
will reap the economic rewards thereof, while we all reap the rewards of 
having a larger pool of talent (that\'s all of us!) using the same 
system, rather than three or four different, incompatible systems.

This, of course, works hand-in-hand with the multitude of Milieux that IG 
will be supporting.  No matter which of the official Traveller universes 
you like, there will be one for you...plus other, new ones! 

T4 is going to be a great product.  We\'ll each do some tweaking in our 
own campaigns, but when has that not been the case for ANY RPG?!? :)

Depends on the size of the rock, of course.  For most purposes, you\'d be
using smallish ones -- 10s of meters, maximum -- if we\'re discussing the
invasion (as opposed to obliteration) scenario.  Let\'s call it a 10m
nickel-iron nugget, aimed at a building complex (say, the planet\'s
principle commo hub).  Let\'s stand about 20km away, too, and have a nice
deep trench dug. :) Oh, and let\'s also assume an earthlike world in terms
of grav and atmosphere. 

So:  Everything is calm and peaceful, until suddenly a blazing ball of
white-hot plasma, brighter than the Sun, flashes down out of the sky at a
steep angle, moving too fast to track with the eye.  From the point where
it dropped below the horizon appears a lovely hemispherical cloud of
debris, glowing dull red with brighter yellow and white flecks, visibly
flattening as it quickly rises, spreads and darkens.  Moments later, a
powerful ground shockwave arrives, knocking everyone over...hopefully to
the bottom of the trench, as moments later the air shock arrives. 
Suddenly a 150+ kph wind rushes through; at the same time, rocks start
falling from the sky, as debris lofted onto high parabolic arcs start
raining down.  Most are pebble-sized or smaller; some are bigger, a few
*much* bigger.  Everyone curls up and tries to get under cover.  A minute
or so later, the wind dies down, though the air is still so full of dust
that it\'s almost dark.  Gradually, as the next few hours go by, the dust
settles out or blows away.  On the horizon where the commo center used to
be are several pillars of smoke, as fires started by the initial blast
continue to burn.  Travelling now toward the impact point, one encounters
greater and greater devastation, until about a a half-klick out one finds
the crater rim, still too hot to touch. 

Cool, huh? :)

To add my two cents to the discussion (and maybe make it less tangential),
the key idea is that, for a "hot" drop, it is probably much more effective
to shoot 30 smallish bits at the planet (a platoon plus the dummies) that
are much harder to hit, than putting all of your eggs in one basket, so to
speak.  If the enemy\'s anti-aircraft/trans-orbital defenses take out a
drop ship, you\'ve lost however many troops it was carrying, plus pilot,
plus an expensive ship.  If one of the drop capsules gets smeared, you\'ve
lost a single trooper (rather Machiavellian, but that war).

It should be noted that they don\'t senselessly waste drop capsules, at one
point in the book they do ride down in a drop ship, because the planet had
already been secured.  Also, from the extra orbital point of view, the
fast corvettes that they use are probably cheaper to build (and hence can
be built better/meaty-er) than a comparable troop and drop ship transport.

And finally, one must take into account that somewhere in the book he
states there are about 11,000 Mobile Infantrymen ("everyone drops"), so
this is by no means a force-wide form of deployment.  This whole insertion
method becomes that much more practical, then, when you consider that
these guys are the rare, top of the line, beach/planet-head troopers.
When you view this in the Traveller (Imperium/Regency, take your pick)
mode, I, personally, see these guys as something like a singular division
of the Marines (as the Marines are to the Army, these guys are to the
Marines).  In my campaigns, in fact, I\'ve used something similar as
commando teams (much like their role in the book----land and cause havoc),
and i can also see applications in peace-keeping (someone does something
stupid, and WHAM, you\'ve got a company of malo-hombres shooting up your
nostrils).

CT had a lot going for it and using it as the basis for T4 is a good

BOMI --BOMB MISSLE ? I think is was a program that was budgeted out of
existence but was more than theoretically possible. Also the Dyna-saur a
manned aerospace plane project initiated by the Air Force before the Mercury
Project (Man in a Can) would have been used for the same purpose. It was
cancelled well into prototype production in 1963. It was what Werner Von
Braun, Sanger, and Willy Ley envisioned, a small reusable space plane that
would carry two astronauts and a small payload to the cancelled Manned
Orbital Laboratory (which is where most of the the first shuttle astronauts
came from this program: Crippen, Truly, Engle).

Faction?  What in God\'s name are you talking about?  There was an honest
discussion of what was wanted, and the makers of the game gave us a week to
make it work.  I have no idea if IG plans to *use* FF&S-Lite, but for you to

Ah, so you\'ve seen the complete manuscript, and are able to render judgement

Getting a bit messianic, are we?  It is a GAME, fer the love of pete!  You

While you are telling us what the future holds, could you clue me into what
this season holds for the 49ers?

Phil, your diatribes extoling the ONE TRUE TRAVELLER have grown tiresome.
I\'ve played Traveller since I was 12, when my brother (who is also on the
list) sat down and explained the concept of role-play to me.  In that time,
I\'ve gone through all of Traveller\'s growing pains, watched the Imperium go
from a one-line mention in Book 4: Mercenary to a richly detailed campaign
setting.

I\'m ready to move forward.  I believe that MMT will be a combination of the
best that 18-odd years of Traveller have to offer.  If you wish to sulk,
feel free.

Good-bye Phil, I for one, will not miss you.

Ya cool.  But cool in the way people rubber neck at an accident scene cool.
Personally I think that we should really drop this concept.  The idea of
dropping a boulder on a planetoid at 10,000 KPS is pretty morally repugnant
and it goes against everything that the Traveller universe CT MT TNE and T4
beleive in.  THough I wouldn\'t put it past Lucan.

Don\'t be so serious.

My objectives were (1) to give some perspective on the first aid/medic
debate by pointing out that medical science skills could be split in other
ways and (2) inject a little humor into the discussion.

If psychiatry were a separate skill, it would be used in, for example, the
following ways:
- -to diagnose another character (PC or NPC) whose behavior had become
maladptive, e.g., because of loss of SAN (whoops, wrong game), exposure to
jump space, ingestion of psychoactive substances,
congenital/hormonal/genetic problems, etc.
- -in place of interrogation skill
- -in administering psychoactive substances for various purposes
- -to foment or dispell conflict among others

Psychiatry-3 should also provide an increase in Social Standing, because the
character has to spend that money somehow.

The Forever War gives a good perspective on advances in tech levels and

This is not an aside.  The English teacher was applying his Education and

Here is another good reason for the game data to be released in
computer-searchable format.  While it\'s great to be able to use spreadsheets
to crank the last .00047 MW out of the battleship design, often one just
wants to know where the podiatrist chargen table is, or where the Shionthy

The main player character mustered out (using Book 5 chargen) as an Imperial
Navy Master Chief Petty Officer with five terms in the medical branch and
med-3.  

He\'s therefore as competent, skill-wise, as a navy doctor.  Navy doctors,
however, are officers (at least in my class-obsessed ImpNav, which I don\'t
think deviates in spirit from canon).  He therefore was never a doctor, and
certainly not a medical officer.  What then did he do during his last two
terms with med-3?

I ruled that he was a typical senior NCO:  He managed other enlisted
personnel, and did some technical work himself.  Specifically, he was in
Orbital Search & Rescue, flying down to planet surfaces with a team or teams
in a pinnace to rescue and treat downed navy fighter crews.  While the teams
might have junior officers in command, the MCPO handled technical details
and assigned specific tasks.  Officer:  "let\'s get the pilot out of the
wreck."  MCPO:  "Mashugeneh and Spilkis, use the Jaws of Life on the forward
hatch; Kwanyin, rev up the grav stretcher and stand by.  I\'ve got the power
pack for the eltee\'s remote diagnostics -- let\'s go!"

Neither my player nor I have actual military experience, so I\'d welcome
comments from the veterans on the list.  What do senior NCOs with a lot of
medical skill do in the late 20th century?

While you hopefully supress the enemy aerospace force from orbit the
clearing I\'m think of is of a different nature.  Small well concealed missle
teams in a 100km radius around the most likely targets.  Even a handheld SAM
can cause serious shit for a lander.

Consider the panic the TOW missle put into the Soviet High Command.  The
thought of a tank-killing missle that could be fired from a jeep, took
almost no time to set up, and was easy to use, caused STAVKA to trash *all*
of their plans for the invasion of the west.  All of them.  It took three
years for the Soviet Army to come up with a full set of plans to replace the
old ideas.

Aerospace fighters would patrol a designated corridor, looking for any sign
of SAM launch (or laser weapons) and then bring such sites under immediate
attack.

The bad guys have had days at least to know this is coming.  More than
enough time to hide from orbital recon.  I was part of an experiment in 1985
where we hid a Mechanized Brigade in the middle of the desert for a full
day.  The satellites could not see us.  :)

Absolutely a fusion of all the best aspects of the three systems is the only

Again absolutly right.  Tossing in the towel and refusing to be a part of
the process gets no where.  Disputes would never get solved if people simply
gave up when the going gets tough.  No one of us is going to get to have
their cake and eat it too, and with T4 probably near the presses we\'ll
likely never influence what\'s going on at this moment however we can
influence what is to come.

   I suspect we\'ll be seeing a system very close to TNE in basic
structure, with attributes acting as a base to the skill. Skill lists will
probably be cascades - how deatiled, I don\'t know.

   Wel, for one thing this doesn\'t have to be done all at once and we can
hammer out some basic concepts. How many priorities should players have to
choose? What *average* levels of attributes should we allow in the various
levels of choice? How many skill levels are appropriate for each level of
choice? Guidelines for age? How do we let players handle character class
and history? These are all important questions, and we don\'t have to know
the final details of T4 to work them out. 

   Besides, August is only two months away! <g>

Mote in Gods Eye_, an the sequel _The Gripping Hand_.  The rumor I had
heard was the Traveller was loosely based on that book.  I don\'t know of
that is true, but after reading them, it really revitalized me to playing
Traveller (esp with nobles).

I would also recommend the Pournelle novels set in the Mote Universe. 
They are very good for looking at what Mileu 0 might be like.  _Prince of
Sparta_ I think is one of books in that series.

Another series that I have found to be a very good Space Navy book is the
David Feintuch series that starts in _Midshipmans Hope_.  If you really
want to get a feel for the Imperial Navy, I would strongly recommend the
Horatio Hornblower series by C.S. Forester, and the Master and Commander
series by Patrick O\'Brien (at the very least it is O\' something).  I have
always seen Traveller Naval actions as much like the Napoleonic English
Navy of Nelson.  The Captain had immense amounts of Autonomy on his ship,
and the Admiral had even more.  The descriptions of Imperial Naval
Doctrine for Traveller seem very like this (read the Rebellion sourcebook
for the best explanation I have seen).  It is the only way to make it work
in so large and Empire where a ship or Task Force could be out of contact
for months at a time.

   I didn\'t say you needed complicated rules, I said FF&S gave us

  FF&S doesn\'t espouse any one species or social inclination - just the
laws (as we know them) of physics and engineering. Social and religious
obstacles are the responsibility of the designer (GM).

  As for alternative tech, look in the "alternative tech" section. <g>

  Not the *only*, just the only one we\'ve had to date. IMO, the biggest
problems FF&S had were:

  1) Bad copy-editing, and confusing layout.
  2) Lots of "broken" features (eg: thrusters) that had GM\'s shaking their
heads.
  3) Inconsistencies with earlier established CT canon. (yes, I said
INCONSISTENCIES! :) (eg, HEPLAR vs Thrusters)  

  Complexity was really only a side issue.

   ...and almost all of them conflicted in different ways with my idea of
how a particular piece of equipment worked/should be layed out, not to
mention plain common-sense. (Note: I was a physics major in college) Had
these pieces of equipment been designed using FF&S, they all would have
"fit".

   Give three artists three blank pieces of paper and say "design an X"
and you\'ll get three different ideas of what X should be. Give each of
them a copy of *some* kind of rules set that has a *comprehensive* set of
commonsense guidelines for applying engineering principles, and you will
get considerably closer results (not exact, but they will differ only in
*detail* not in function)

  One thing I *really* like about FF&S, as opposed to HG, was that players
could actually look at the stats and say "gee, we only got a 60MW turret
laser - we could really cut up those corsairs that have been annoying us
lately if we upgrade to the 200MW TL-15 design they\'re selling here, of
course we\'d have to upgrade the powerplant but it\'s better than sucking
vac". In CT, it would be more like "uh, G.O.D.[*] what would it take to
upgrade our TL9 turret laser to a TL15 one at the next starport?" and have
the GM scratching his head and making an *arbitrary* decision on the spot
to explain how the players can (or if the GM is mean, canNOT) put one on.

   Personal Reentry Kits. You know, a suitcase sized object that contains
a plastic bag shaped like a hemisphere with a couch indentation in one
side, a pressure canister full of foam, a deorbit thruster, and a cheap
one-shot idiot-proof nav computer. You put on your vac-suit, inflate the
plastic bag with the foam (which hardens and turns into a heat-resistant
half-cocoon) strap yourself in and deorbit with the thruster, using the
nav computer to plot your reentry path.

   ...but if you know the power consumption, you know what the players
goal is and how hard the task is. (A .1MW radio is going to be a *lot*
harder to power than a .001MW radio)

   Skill rolling also pretty well negates role-playing, I only use rolling
to add a little spice and uncertainty. If players know their goal, and
come up with a *reasonable* plan to power up the radio ("We strip all the
vac suits of their powerpacks, each powerpack is rated at 0.00342MW, all
the party\'s packs should power the radio long enough to call the fleet")
then, I\'ll just check to make sure that at least one character is
competent in the necessary skills ("anyone have electronics and
mechanical? Ok, the radio\'s working. What do you do?") and let the plan
work. There is NO good reason to kill off the party just because they flop
on a couple of skill rolls with a perfectly good plan.

There are TONS of game son the market right now.  All have rules most are
different.  Almost every one of these games also has a game background
that the game is designed for.  Without the background the game doesn\'t
always work right.  Even the supposedly Generic GURPS Space heavily relies
on the background of the Space Universe.  Sure you can modify it, but the
best selling GURPS modules, and one of the reasons of its success is the
creation of Worldbooks based on popular Sci-Fi.  Sure the rules allow for
almost anything, but GURPS sells tons of Worldbooks for a reason.

Traveller is inextricably intertwined with the Imperium.  Does this mean
that you have to set your games there?  No!  However, I have never thought
that any incarnation of Traveller was the best RPG on the market from a
rule standpoint (maybe TNE was OK, but it too had problems).  However,
what has kept me interested in Traveller is the fact that the 11,000
worlds of the Imperium even existed.  Someone mentioned Battlelords of the
23rd Century.  It is a good game.  The rules are OK, but what makes if fun
to play if the background.  Can I design one better?  If I could I would
have my own game on the market.  If you want to design your own...more
power to you.  But if you want T4 to succeed, and I am not sure that
everyone on the list feels that way at this point, then background is the
key.  Vampire, Werewolf, Mage, and Changeling are poor games in my opinion
from a rules standpoint, but from a background standpoint they are
probably the best on the market hands down (GURPS even copied them). 
Shadowrun is the same, fair rules, but incredible background.

Personally I am hopeful that T4 will be a success.  I harbor no love for
TNE over any other Traveller rule system, and IMHO no setting compares to
the Rebellion for intrigue and adventure, but I am willing to give M0 a
try at least for a bit.  I have been vary happy that IG has listened to us
on the list, and realized that TNE had DEFINITE improvements over all
prior incarnations of Traveller.  In the immortal words of Rodney King
"Can\'t we all just get along?" B-)

Waiting for T4 with baited breath so I can try and prove that Fighters are
the key to any Space Navy...

   A couple of points with reference to modern-day marines:

  1) There is no hospital corps in the marines, the marines use Navy
corpsmen.

  2) In the marines, *everyone* carries a rifle, and knows how to use it.

I actually had a liking for HEPlaR - it didn\'t offend my relativistic 
senses like thruster plates did.  However, if one is patient, use icy 
comets - plenty of free fuel.

And, because what you can do unto them, they can do unto you.  While 
one\'s vengeance may be delayed months or years, a dozen+ comets will 
make short work a world if you can get them fast/close to the world 
without detection, and they don\'t take a lot of resources (a HEPlaR 
drive and a good computer).

What you talking about?  Don\'t gun racks come standard on all pickup

        Well, personally, I wouldn\'t advocating dropping so much as a toy
parachute onto a planet unless I was damn sure that there were no threats of
any sort detectable from orbit.  Mobile infantry cost money to train, to
equip, to feed, to carry, to patch back up together gain, etc, etc, etc.
They\'re a valuable resource that should only be used where strictly neccessary.

        Rocks, on the other hand are free.

        Well, I wasn\'t exactly advocating dropping rocks the size of Ceres
on a platoon-strength target or anything, but I was thinking of the size of
rocks that you\'re talking about.  Apologies for fumbling up my terminology :).

        Exactly.  There are gazillions of rocks floating around that will
cost you nothing save the thrust to move them onto target and won\'t cause
nasty fallout problems (although I suspect "pseudo-nuclear" winter could be
a problem if you used enough of them...

        Cool.  I hadn\'t bothered thinking it out that far... I was still
thinking in terms of simply being up a gravity well.  This just makes the
picture for the side without orbital superiority all that much bleaker...

What??  They\'re outdated?  Damn, I better go shopping.

I agree with Christopher\'s main point.  All this bickering about whether
T4 was going to be CT mark II or TNE mark II is frankly ludicrous.
If I wanted to play CT, I\'d go and get my CT books out.  If I wanted
to play TNE, I\'d go and get that out.

If T4 is going to be based on one or the other, but incorporating
changes that the now infamous twenty years of role playing
experience has brought, with input from the members of this list,
and hopefully as much as any product can do trying to blend the
best bits of TNE with the best bits of CT, well then I will go and buy
it.  A replica of either game would be pointless.  Something which
takes the best aspects of both would be umm, pointful.

But let\'s face it, there\'s going to be something in T4 that I am
unhappy with.  There\'s going to be something in T4 that all the
members of this list aren\'t going to like.  That\'s life.  In my
opinion if you want a RPG that is totally perfect for you, and
that exactly fits the way you view the far future, then write it yourself.

I\'ll just buy T4, and any bits I don\'t like, I will rewrite, or ignore, or
replace with a rule that I do like.  The rules aren\'t a sacrosanct
holy document, and you can alter the rules (or even shock horror
the background) to suit yourself and your campaign without the
ImperiumGames meninblack coming and abducting you.  The
reason I\'m going to buy T4 is I think and hope that I\'ll want to
change less than I did with CT or TNE.

*What* "control frequency"? These puppies are "fire and forget"
munitions. They\'ve got pattern matching code good enough that most will
go for the type of target they are sent after. You get them aimed at
the general area, tell them what to kill, and when they get there
they\'ll go after anything that looks like that kind of target.

They could be spoofed by some sorts of camouflage, but that\'s ok
because they are "cheap". And you don\'t want to fire them into a
situation where your vehicles and enemy vehicles are intermixed. (Of
course, even ground support aircraft make mistakes in *that* sort of
mess)

We don\'t know this for sure. The MI appear to be a cross between
Marines and Paratroopers. So their view of fighting would be rather
different than your standard "line grunt". 

They did have "artillery" support from ships when in major actions. As
for cavalry, I dunno. What sort of "cavalry" would you see as fitting
that sort of tech, and the "drop" requirements? Armored cav is pretty
much out. So that leaves air cav, which seems to be a bit
problematical.

Think of it as integral artileery. :-)

Both Heinlein and Haldeman *liked* each other\'s book. They were

were describing was quite different too.

That *does* seem to be what he\'s saying. 

Unfortunately, when you ram the planet, zeta field or no, you *must*
have a KE at least equal to that which you\'d have gotten by free
falling to the planet. And that gets fairly hefty.

Also, what happens if a kinetic kill projectile hits your ship? If the
zeta field affects it, it won\'t hit as hard. If the field *doesn\'t*
affect it, then it\'s possible that your ship will "bounce" out of the
way.

I know that folks are worried about the dangers of planetbusters, and
even just "dropping rocks". But the fact is that anything that will
enable a ship to take off and get to 100 diameters carrying a fair
amount of cargo is going to make certain "nasty" things possible. It
comes with the territory.

Likewise, jumbo jets mean that you can wipe out a small town easily.
Just set the GPS-linked autopilot (they exist) to crash the plane
there, and bail out. For a medium sized city, load the plane with the
right types of materials and the secondary blast will do the job.

Why don\'t people do this? Easy. Have you *priced* a jumbo jet?

Likewise, with a reaction drive ship, folks aren\'t going to crash the
ships into things except in very unusual circumstances. 

Thruster plates are the problem, but *only* as long as they are allowed
to violate conservation of energy. If you fix that, then they aren\'t a
problem. Of course,, this will piss off the folks who like them since
it turns out that a "reactionless" drive that obeys conservation of
energy is *less* efficient than your typical reaction drive.

Since I don\'t have a copy of FF&S, I\'m dropping back to the "old"
theoretical figures for a fusion rocket. That\'s an Isp of roughly
600,000. (exhaust velocity = 5.88e6 m/s)

For a thrust of 3000 tonnes (3e6 kg) such a drive would be using 5 kg
per second of fuel. Work it out yourself. 

5 kg of plasma is *not* going to set a city on fire. Nor is 300 kg (one
minute). 

Oh yeah, figure out a density for the plasma as it leaves the jet. The
density and exhaust velocity is enough to determine the cross-sectional
area of the jet. And it\'s *damn* narrow unless you assume ridiculously
low densities.

It\'ll make a mess of the surface you land on, but that\'s why starports
have blast pits, and why the "frontier" type ports are a chunk of
bedrock. A few holes burned in it or melted places don\'t matter much. 

And it *is* going to burn a hole. The kinetic energy of the jet is
86e12 W or 86 terawatts.  But as I noted above, it\'s *very*
concentrated. It\'ll go thru rock like an acetylene torch thru
styrofoam.

So if you want to "torch" a city, you are going to have to *hover* on
your exhaust, and then walk it back and forth across the city. 

Me, I\'d have some cheap heat seeker missiles armored to withstand the
drive flame for long enough to explode inside the drive. There\'s *no*
way you are going to avoid that. Or survive it.

There\'s a Scientific American from 10-15 years back that has a
*daylight* photo of ICBM warheads re-entering at the Kwajalien test
range. What you see are three *straight* white lines crossing the photo
from sky to ground. 

The white is the "plasma sheath" caused by friction with the
atmosphere. Orbit to surface bombardment weapons would probably have
these too. And the trajectory would look straight because they are
moving so fast.

Thus, from a distance, it\'d almost look like a classical SF energy beam!

You are going to get a blast regardless. But if the projectile is
shaped like a long rod, moving end first, you\'ll get something of a
"shaped charge" effect, greatly increasing penetration, and somewhat
reducing the "spread" of the blast.

By the time you get up to the kiloton range, it doesn\'t really matter.
You\'ll get a crater, and a nice mushroom cloud. You\'ll even get some
X-rays and gamma rays on impact. But the fallout won\'t be radioactive.

If you really don\'t give a damn about the planet, drop a 2 km nickel
iron asteroid at about 40 km/s (a not unreasonable velocity for even a
*natural* impact). Aim it at an ocean, and you\'ll at the very least
*totally* screw up the planetary weather system for decades, and at
worst cause either a runaway greenhouse or a "nuclear winter" (there
are good arguments in favor of both outcomes)

If you did this in the Pacific Ocean, the tidal wave would travel
around the world several times. And it\'d be on the order of the depth
of the ocean for about the first 12,000 miles. Forget ships and subs.

        Well, the thing is though is that it\'s not hard to do... so somebody
is sure to do it at some point (and stopping it from happening might make a
neat segment of a campaign).  I\'d argue for including it, purely because I
tend to prefer darker, grittier game seetings over squeaky-clean,
family-values-oriented type game settings where everyone wears drycleaned
designer jumpsuits, drinks Synthohol, and obeys the Prime Directive :).

    'body' => '        Today I was down on the waterfront in Hong Kong, and I saw several
jets come in for landing at Kai Tak airport; for those of you who haven\'t
heard about this airport; it\'s one runway, sticking out into the harbour, at
the foot of a mountain.  747\'s come in from the west on final approach,
flying down the mountainside, and then make a hard right turn almost at
rooftop level over a residential neighbourhood (from my point of view, I
would see them begin the turn, see a little planform show, and then they\'d
disappear behind some buildings) before straightening out and landing.  It\'s
a wild ride; when I flew in here in May it was on the tail end of a
thunderstorm; even through the rain I could see into people\'s apartments.
Thank God, they\'ve never had a crash on final approach...

        This got me thinking about the planet killer debate that\'s been
going on, where people have been angsting over how even a small ship\'s
drives or accumulated kinetic energy could seriously ruin a planet\'s
geological epoch (747\'s smearing Kowloon, high-speed ships smearing planets;
same concept:>).  I\'ve come up with a way in which some systems may deal
with this menace.  The solution?  In-system speed limits under certain
circumstances, strict Space Traffic Control beginning out at about the Oort
Cloud, and some serious planetary defense weaponry to deal with dangerous
traffic offenders :).

        Basically, the navigational guides for a given system will describe
certain "spaceways", much as today\'s maps for air navigation provide airways
for commercial air traffic.  Essentially, a large volume of space around the
inner part of the system or the important worlds therein will be termed
"Controlled Space" and be continuously monitored.  Ships exiting jump space
will have to report in to System Space Traffic Control a long ways out, and
tower will evaluate priority and assign a trajectory and velocity that will
take them along very safe routes towards their destination.  Likewise,
in-system traffic will be filing flight plans, and following them pretty
much to a T.  All traffic will be continuously be tracked and monitored.
Save for craft operating outside of the system\'s Controlled Space, ships
will have to rigourously adhere to traffic regulations.  Ships violating
them will be fined.  Potentially dangerous violations-in-progress will
result in alerted planetary defense systems, and if it looks like a runaway
ship is accelerating towards a populated world, the planetary defense system
destroys it if no other measures will succeed.

        Once in orbit, control will be handed over to Planetary Traffic
Control.  Again, if some joker does some dangerous HEPLaR driving, he\'ll get
fined, and if it looks like he\'s going to do some impromptu urban renewal
the PDS kicks in and puts a stop to the problem ASAP.

        Visualize the system as Dirty Harry on steroids with PMS on traffic
patrol, and everybody knowing it :).  It may seem kind of extreme, but then
again we\'re dealing with planetary-sized populations: what\'s a ship and its
potentially terroristic crew compared to a few billion lives?

        Yeah, you\'ve got a point there :).  Then again, there\'s the Desert
Storm example: troops went in only after weeks of heavy bombing, and took
only minor casualties.  This is the sort of approach that I\'m advocating...
I think that we\'re only disagreeing on one point: I\'m bullish on detection
and neutralization from orbit, whereas you\'re much less optimistic.

        OK...  I\'m willing to admit that I might have been (I doubt we\'ll
find out for sure this lifetime anyhow :>) optimistic and that more PBI
would have to get dropped in and shot at.  Now, given that individual

You don\'t mention those forces operating from behind enemy lines.
Those who went in to act as forward observers to spot the Scud
launchers... but that\'s a different thread entirely.

I don\'t believe you can write off orbital drops of foot troops.  It
seems there will always be a use for foot troops even if it\'s not in

My intent is quite the opposite. Killer rocks at "natural" speeds are
bad enough. Bring them up to >0.1c and any idiot can trash a planet,
with little chance of being stopped. I\'m proposing a *solution* that
takes this capability out of the hands of civilians. I don\'t even care
how it works, although I\'ve suggested one possible way.

Now would be the time to eliminate this debate once and for all, don\'t
you agree? Preferably without relying solely on "social abhorrence"--
governments *do* treat nuclear/chemical/biological weapons in the hands
of civilians (as well as planes/cars in restricted areas) as threats
and take *decisive* action to eliminate these threats. For example, in
Traveller this might mean destroying *any* foreign ships as soon as
they jump in-system and forcing civilians to transfer their cargo
and/or passengers to a government-run ferry at a nearby "free port"
system. That should be a sign of an *extremely* paranoid government,
not "just plain common sense".

BTW, I don\'t even care if the solution to the planet-killer problem is
explained in T4. But T4 should be flexible enough (as CT was) to assume
the solution exists. The problem is that the technology *is* getting
explained (in part due to extremely detailed design systems), and it
isn\'t consistent with the Traveller universe (a universe where free
traders can move about without SDB escorts, for example).

One possibility is independant duty with a unit too small to warrant a 
doctor.  US Submarines carry Navy corpsmen (an enlisted rating, similar
to an Army MOS) who have been specially certified for independant duty.
They are authorized to dispense drugs and trained to perform minor
surgery, etc.  Significantly beyond your normal EMT.  In fact, ours
was licensed by UT Austin to teach the EMT(Basic) course.  Of course, 
at the E-9 level, they tend to be senior
NCO in the squadron office or some such.  OBTW, most have combat exper-
ience with the Marines, if possible.  The guy on my boat was a VN vet.
Most of them are E-6 or E-7.

   That seems to be a serious problem, I don\'t think you could make such a
field work - their are just too many violations of the laws of physics as
we know it. I don\'t think you could get away from a time dilation effect
either. (PLEASE don\'t ask - I don\'t want to get into the math) If someone
brought such a field into the game, I would throw it out - it would just
ruin my suspension of disbelief.

  Another violation of the laws of conservation. E.E. Smiths reversion of

   Bingo! Exactly my thoughts. I\'ve been trying to mentally phrase a
response to the two people who\'ve been trading messages on this for a
couple of days, and this just about does it. You just can\'t get away from
the fact that spacecraft *can* do damage - trying to get rid of reaction
drives (a mistake, IMO) just because the *realistically* can do some
damage is ludicrous. 

   Put some safeguards in, such as patrols. Make it illegal for a
trajectory to intercept the planets atmosphere. Violators get intercepted
and boarded. Anyone who tries to dodge get\'s their drive disabled *then*
they get boarded! <g> (Reaction plates and "unlimited" drive capabilities
make this *easier* not harder for planetary SDB\'s to push you away). Make
it necessary to enter parking orbit and receive a "harbour pilot" for
landing maneuvers. I believe these solutions should provide answers for
most of the concerns Eric has.

> Why don\'t people do this? Easy. Have you *priced* a jumbo jet?

   Another excellent point I was going to mention. NOBODY, except a crazy
man in a stolen ship is going to crash a Multi-MCr spacecraft into a
planet. Asteroids, maybe - but again SDB\'s would intercept at the
slightest hint that somebody was gathering asteroidal masses for a
collision.

   On crazy men - read some Niven, an advanced society probably has
methods to detect and deal with the major causes of mental problems.

   Out of curiousity, why do you believe this? A reactionless drive like
thruster plates would not require reaction mass - this creates efficiency
bonuses in it\'s own right, even when there are problems with energy
consumption. One major bonus I would see with reactionless thrusters in
Military craft would be the lack of "G" on the crew - provided you are
willing to pay for the thrusters and the power to run them, you could
generate a *heck* of a lot of EM.

I personally love the idea of a searchable CDROM with all the game stuff on
it.  However, it strikes me that most of us don\'t have our computers right
where we\'re playing.  Though in most instinces they are convenient, but some
of us, like me go to a friends place and he, the heathen, doesn\'t even own a
computer.  Actually I gave him an old 286 two weeks ago so he could type in
his stuff.

   Three words: Deep Meson Sites. Undestroyable from orbit, though you can
blind their sensors *if* you can find them. (Personally, I favour neutrino
detectors as a primary targetting sensor - no emissions to lock onto, and
are great for targetting fusion-powered starships)

We can\'t accommodate anyone who isn\'t willing to compromise.  Shoot, I think
we all tried to accommodate everyone, but when someone is as mallible as
concrete, its rather hard to accommodate them.  Phil refused to give in on
any of his points.  While in politics and religion, this attitude is
praised, we are talking about a game here.  Besides, how many times has it
been said now.  Use the part of the rules you like and change the rest to
fit your preference.  I don\'t recall Phil ever mentioning exactly what he
wanted other than a reprint of CT!!!  You can\'t accommodat someone when they
won\'t even try to adjust and when they aren\'t reasonable about their demands!!!


> We can do without 
>your petty gloating, how old are you?

Your superior attitude is almost as bad as the gloating!!!  How many times
has Phil gotten on this list or the XTML and preached his ideas.  I even
seem to recall that when T4 was announced as "a return to CT in light of
twenty years of RP experience" Phil was the first to gloat.  If you don\'t
remember, I\'ll try to dig up the message in my files for you.


> I for one am sorry that 
>Phil took this approach, but it was his choice and I hope he 
>reconciders.

I\'m not!!! And I don\'t!!  Phil liked to stir up hornets nests.  I once sent
a private email to him asking about why he did this.  Basically he told me
that he liked to take on the world.  He sure must have the way he did it!!
His final post was nothing more than an excuse to cause trouble.  He could
have just as easily left the mailing list and posted a private response to
IG.  Then no one would have had to read about his superior attitude.


>So please lets all try to get things in perspective here, all we want

I think what we all want is the best possible Trav ever.  In the beginning
this must include certain compromises from everyone.  Phil was unwilling or
unable to compromise!!


>I really hope T4 will be a good product, though I fear it\'ll be 
>something less.

I think your fears are un warranted!!  I\'m looking forward to T4.  I loved
TNE and I hate to see the RC setting go, but do you see me whining about the
places where T4 is going to return to CT norms?  NO!!  I don\'t like the idea
of having only a few character classes like MM mentioned in his post.  I\'d
like to see more non-military classes, but do I whine about it? NO!!!  I
mention my concern and hope it is addressed.  If it isn\'t then I\'ll live!
I\'ll either adapt my rules to include what I want, or I\'ll change my setting
or campaign to fit the Rule Book.


Sorry everyone, but this really ticked me off!!  I don\'t remember much
positive contribution from Phil.  I may be wrong and may just not be
remembering correctly, but all I seem to remember is him stirring up
trouble.  I try my best to avoid people like that, and whenever they leave a
group I\'m part of, I always think it is for the best!

Ya but if all they did was throw rocks at Normandy the second world war
would still be going on.  8)  Someone\'s got the make the sacrifice, and
you\'ll never completely supress the planets air defence.  I mean unless you

My big old wagoneer doesn\'t have a gun rack (it isn\'t a pick up, I
know)--but it should have one :-)  Then I can get a Lee-Enfield Jungle
Carbine to go with it.  Ah, excellent.

  Minor, My big black CT book spends time telling me about trading in 
the Imperium & how the Imperium views psionics.

  A better example would be how starship crew sizes expanded, due to the

Right.  Like RPG\'s (or videogames, for that matter) get any more outdated 
than any other sort of game.  It either has replay value or it doesn\'t.  
Candyland isn\'t outdated - not since there\'s always a new supply of young 
children who\'ve never played it.  Same goes for Tic-Tac-Toe.  Some RPg\'s 
and videogames fall into the same category as those games: fun until you 
grow out of them.

Other RPGs and videogames are fun forever, like Chess, Backgammon, and 
Go are in the boardgame category.  I put Traveller in this 
category.  Others may not, and that\'s OK, too.  

I like the idea of Traveller growing and changing, and I\'ll economically 
support that.  But just because a new incarnation of a game comes out 
doesn\'t mean the older ones are useless.  They\'re still as fun as they 
always were - a new system doesn\'t change the old one, in other words.  

I\'ll stop on this subject now, before I get up on my soapbox about our 
throwaway society and the way we denigrate anything that isn\'t brand new. :)

No question about it, although planetary defense can do something

It probably retains the same amount of kinetic energy, although its
actual velocity upon impact may be affected.

I don\'t own FF&S, so I don\'t know if HEPlaR really fixes this problem
(it certainly could). HEPlaR also implies serious top-speed limits and
micro-jumps (yuck!). There\'s not much point discussing it, though. The
thruster plate decision has already been made.

If you look at thrusters this way, then you\'d better have a really
good reason for people to choose them over fusion rockets. I\'ve been
assuming thrusters were much like traditional M-drives, in which
case a mass-nullifier like the zeta field is needed both to prevent
the "free energy" problem and to prevent planet-killers.

To me the issue is not reaction vs. reactionless drives. It\'s whether
ships have high accelerations/top speeds. If they do (which to me is
"canonical Traveller"), a small fix as I\'ve suggested is needed.

So every free trader has a heavy-duty spinal mount weapon that is
1,433,333 times as powerful as a 60MW turret laser? I still think
*any* free trader can take out *any* space station on its way out
with these drives (and it doesn\'t even need to be that close).

I don\'t really want to fuel a debate about HEPlaR, though. My main
concern is that any drive that is capable of high acceleration or
high top speeds implies a tremendous threat (much more so than a
rogue 747). Yet the background of Traveller seems to imply that
civilians can own and freely operate starships without having big
guns pointed at them at all times (and certainly there are many
referees that would like to run their universe that way).

You don\'t have to buy the "zeta field" idea. But if the new FF&S
is going to explain the technology, it had better at least *leave
room* for referees to reconcile it with the Traveller universe.

Oh I agree there, someone is sure the hell going to try it.  Or do it, it\'s
terrorism on a planetary scale.  The world was outraged when that PANAM jet
was blown up over Locherby (sp?), imagine what the galaxy would think if the
armed forces did this regularly?  You think the Israelies have a problem
with internal security...  It\'d be nothing compared to the problems this
would strike off.  All those people who were killed have relatives and
revenge is a dish best served cold.  Two years later the Imperium would
still be trying to root out terrorists retaliating for that attack.

Or Passive EMS.  Whatever you use if there\'s a meson site on the planet it
doesn\'t matter if you\'ve got the entire Imperial navy in orbit, you\'re boned
you\'ll never find that sucker.

This is a point I\'ve made before and I\'m glad it\'s being stated again.
Often times you don\'t have the luxury of sitting in orbit for a month
pounding the snot out of the planet.  Besides in an extend military campaign
wasting the kind of resourses to do this just slows down your front and
weakens your flanks dramatically.

I have to agree here.  Very little in the way of positive discussion 
by Phil was ever seen.  Even when people were in agreement with him, 
he had a tendency to gloat.  On the other hand, its sad that he is so 
inflexible in his opinions, and so willing to burn his boats, when he 
did occasionally have something valid to say.

I for 1 have a feeling that not anyone group is going to get their way 
on T4 (Even Marc relented on FF&S, due to popular demand). 
I do have a feeling that there will be things about it that everyone will 
like.  

For those who weren\'t around when Marc Miller was at the helm, I think 
his tremendous vision about developing a real, living breathing universe 
was what took the game beyond the ordinary.  In the early GDW years, 
the game had such a realistic feel to it both good and bad.  The game was 
bigger than life.  I want that feeling back much more than I\'m married to a 
rules system.  That looks like it will happen.  I used to buy each adventure 
& magazine, just to see what people were writing, what would happen 
next.

Are you suggesting that the black plague may have been carried from NA
to Europe by the vikings?  Very interesting theory.  I understand that 
a small body of paleontogists believe the dinasours died out when
germs spread accross the land bridge between Europe and NA.

I\'ve read somewhere someone suggested that the Valani lost their

they had no defense against the comman cold, carried to the stars
by the humans of earth.

Traveller is a game about interesting situations.  If the rules only allowed 
high populations on \'garden\' worlds it would get pretty boring.
Here are some ideas to explain Rethe off the top of my head:

#1
The population is not human.  The Rethians are tiny intelligent
hive creatures that must live in large social communities.  

#2
Humans live on the planet, which is a total welfare state.
Income and size of your housing depend on how many children
you support.  (A good question for PC Travellers is finding
out were all the money comes from to support this situation!)

#3
Rethe is a storage world for the terminally ill.
Individuals stay in low berths until a cure for their illness
can be found.  Power is most likely solar.  At most only
a few thousand people realy live on Rethe but as the ill
are not dead they are still counted.

#4
Rethe is a physically stable planet with great mineral wealth.
Over the last several hundred years mining of the planet
has produced vast tunnels and chambers that now provide 
living space.  Social standing of miners is based on
the size of their families.  The government wants to
restrict off world contact so it has not allowed expansion 
of the starport.

As a GM much of my enjoyment of Traveller comes from being able to find
explanations for seemingly odd results of the dice.

Hear him, hear him! It\'s Patrick O\'Brian, and they are *wonderful* books.
Everyone in the entire world should go out and read them all, 
immediately.  Ever since I read them all I\'ve been thinking what a 
wonderful campaign you could build around a small naval warship in a
suitable setting (war in a low-force-density/low population density
region, so there\'s usually only one or two small ships per setting.) 
Napoleonic naval warfare and society doesn\'t map one-to-one to SF
(no matter how hard David Feintuch and David Weber try), but it\'s a good
source of atmosphere. 

(I\'ve got a bunch of FFS designs for short-range high-damage x-ray
lasers I call "carronades", by the way...)

OK...

Let\'s think about this for a sec.  A single "Drop Ship" is going to 
make it through a system\'s planetary defenses (deep meson guns, etc), 
its Close Orbit & Aerospace defenses (AA & Aircraft, which are far 
more maneuverable than a Drop Ship will ever be), and then after the 
enemy has been tracking it all the way down, a few 100 or thousand 
troops are going to come pouring out right into a killing zone that 
the enemy has set up as they watched the thing drop out of orbit.  

I doubt it would make it to the planet\'s surface intact.  If it did, 
the enemy knows exactly where it landed, and exactly where to send 
the grav tanks, battle dress equipped troops, etc.  I would imagine 
planetary assault, against a competent, high tech enemy to be a dicey 
proposition at best.  For those who haven\'t read it, I highly 
recommend the account of the 5th Frontier War as written in Spinward 
Marches Campaign.  The Zhodani spent the better parts of 3 years trying to 
subdue the systems of Jewell & Efate without success.  

Actually, the whole debate might be pointless, as I would suspect that the 
only way such a system would fall would be after a prolonged siege weakened 
the defenses (no more imported spare parts, or food, or in the case of some 
worlds, water), followed by assault.

Two points: 

1) Dropships are faster - they can come down under power, stopping at the
last minute (inertial compensators stop the Marines being smeared all over
the inside), so they\'re vulnerable for less time.

2) They\'ll be equipped with various jammers, decoys, and anti-missile
defences, so they\'re harder to hit.

I see three classes of target:

1) Safe: come down in large troop carriers

2) Dangerous: dropships/G-Carriers

3) V dangerous/stealthy: drop capsules

In Desert Storm we were able to interdict the Iraqui forces in Kuwait.  They
could not receive any supplies due to unrelenting air attack.  When the
Groun Phase began, the VII Corps found itself involved in the largest tank
battle since Kursk (WWII).  While 80,000 Iraqis had surrendered in Kuwait,
the ones who still had supplies fought on, and fought well.

Have you read Worldwar, by Harry Turtledove?  It describes an alien invasion
of Earth in 1942, forcing the various nations of Earth to unite to drive the
invaders out.  One of the points it makes is the "home field advantage" of
fighting for your homeworld.  You have stockpiles, freindly locals, and a
superior knowledge of terrain.

Two notes on observering things.  First, find a book, "A lonely kind of
war", written by a USAF Forward Air Controller.  He makes some excellent
observations about the difficulty involved in this kind of op.  

Second, a personal anecdote:  I was chosen to be pointman for a patrol one
night, and issued a set of AN-PVS/5 Goggles (Light Intensifier Goggles).
These are difficult to use, as there are no shadows at night.  We were
scouting for an armor unit.. 12 M1 tanks.  Should be easy, right?  I was
walking along when I ran into something head first.  At first I thought it
was a tree branch, but on closer inspection..

I had walked into the muzzle of a 105mm main gun.  I never saw the damn
thing, and I was 3 METERS from it.  The crew inside were amused, they had
seen us from 600m with the thermographic sights.

Never assume that high technology will help.

You make it too damn difficult to hold ground.  Make him burn his supplies
faster than he hoped.  Make sure that where ever he lands, partisans spring
up.  Take every oppurtunity to inflict damage.  Wait him out.

Then use the rules you like and make up your own.  You hardly need 
guidance from us to do that.  But we have the right to disagree with

> I was wondering tho, what would cause the yellow n white fireball that

It does, but then the *ground* goes elswhere. :) Remember, kinetic energy
(KE) is energy of motion, equal to 0.5*mv^2.  When our big rock slams into
the planetary surface, v^2 goes from around 140km2/s2 to zilch in less
than a second.  Multiply those figures by a mass of many thousand tons,
and you\'re talking a *big* energy drop.  Where does all that energy go? 
Three places, primarily. 

1) Heat.  This is what creates the yellow and white flecks, and general
   red glow, of the post-impact debris cloud.  By the way, to convince
   yourself that a collision can turn KE into heat, just clap hard for
   a minute or so, then note the temperature of your palms.

2) Ejecta.  An impact tends to throw material away from the point of
   impact, much like the way water splashes when a rock\'s thrown into
   it.  The ejecta is moving quickly, and carries a fair amount of KE.

3) Ground shock.  A compression wave through the ground ripples away from
   the point of impact at high speed, carrying a good bit of energy.

The dynamics of crater formation are fascinating, by the way.  For 
example, over a wide range of impact angles, the resulting crater remains 
circular; only very shallow impact angles dig elongated craters.  Also, 
for very large impacts, the material at the point of impact tends to 
"rebound" instants after the crater forms; that\'s why so many lunar

Not so minor detail. Unlike nukes, kinetic weapons don\'t contaminate
the target area. And they don\'t have the scale effects that limit nukes
to *big* bombs.

Ortillery is just throwing smaller rocks. A 2 kg "rock" (actually more
of a crowbar) at orbital velocity is going take out a tank. Larger
"rocks" for larger targets.

The "free" KE *is* an advantage. And it\'s unlikely that any "rules of
war" will outlaw it. What will get outlawed will be "weapons of mass
destruction". Which basicly means city killers and up. 

Dropping a truck sized rock on a naval base or other miltary target
will likely be perfectly OK, as long as it isn\'t in the middle of a
city. Even then, there\'s always the option of blaming the collateral
destruction on the enemy for placing such targets where they can\'t be
attacked without injuring civilians. Think back to the Gulf War. We
used that line and in general it was accepted as long as we showed that
we were *trying* to restrict targets to military installations. 

Random bombing (like the Iraqi Scuds) is never going to be acceptable.

One doesn\'t. 

If they\'ve got orbital superiority, there\'s *no* way folks on the
ground are going to take that away. Consider Iraq. They lost air
superiority and couldn\'t get it back. 

On the other hand, that\'s a *long* ways from being able to occupy, much
less *pacify* the planet. Again, consider Iraq. We beat the stuffing
out of them, but as far as I can\'t tell, they\'d cheerfully have another
go at it.

You have to make it too expensive to "take" the planet, or failing
that, make *holding* it as expensive as possible.

One of the main factors affecting this sort of thing is whether or not
the attackers have to worry about "public opinion" back home. If they
don\'t, then they can do things like kill civilians in retaliation for
soldiers and equipment lost.

If they do have to worry about public opinion, then you can make things
*very* expensive (can you say "Vietnam"? or "Afghanistan"?)

BTW, "Mr. Fusion" and "fusion+" mean that there *won\'t* be a power grid
to knock out. And the "neutrino background" on the planet is going to
be high enough to mask a *lot* of things. 

And guerillas who don\'t need to worry about fuel and power are going to
be *real* hard to beat.

Hate to tell you this, but what he described was a *large* (10 meter)
boulder at a measly 30 km/sec or so.

Dropping "rocks" at 10 to 30 km/s is going to happen. It\'s mostly
*much* smaller "rocks" and called "ortillery". At 30 km/s a *baseball*
will take out a tank. 

Personally, I think he overdid it. Unless that comm center was buried a
hundred meters undrgound.

On the other hand, have you ever seen pictures of what even "ordinary"
bombs do?

We aren\'t really discussing "giant rocks". Small rocks (a ton or so)
compare *very* favorably with nukes IF YOU ARE ALREADY IN ORBIT. And
the "flying telephone pole" and "flying crowbar" type of projectile is
not a problem at all, even if you are using reaction drives.

Remember, at a measly 3 km/s the KE of an object is equal to an equal
mass of TNT. And the KE goes up with the *square* of the velocity. So
at a not unreasonable 30 km/s, the 1 ton projectile is equal to 100
tons of TNT. At a normal orbital velocity of 9 km/sec it\'s only equal
to 9 tons of TNT.

You misunderstood my point. Your *potential* energy depends solely on
your mass and your position with respect to the planet. So unless
turning off the field moves the ship to a *position* much deeper in the
gravity well, you *have* gained "free" potential energy. To not have
done so requires that your ship expend as much energy leaving the
planet as it would *without* the the zeta field.

The difference in potential energy between two positions is the
difference in escape velocity times the mass of the object. This is
*not* a trivial amount.

Also, if the ship doesn\'t have *at least* orbital velocity for its new
position, you are in the *very* uncomfortable position of *falling*
back to the planet as soon as you cut the drive.

Sorry, but much of the SF I grew up reading had this as a possibility.
Hell, even Andre Norton had ships frying ground positions with their

In which case you have to explain why we allow civilian ownership of
jumbo jets and LNG tankers. They can be used to destroy a lot of real
estate too.

For that matter, do you have any idea what a Concorde or other large,
supersonic plane could do to a city just by making a low pass at Mach
2? I\'ll give you a hint. The shock wave from a *trainer* flying too low
caused damage to the Air Force academy that required replacing
structural steel members!

Sorry, but the dangers are *inherent* in *any* sort of practical
spacecraft. You have two choices. Live with the risks, or don\'t allow
spacecraft. Restricting spacecraft to the military is *not* an option.
Terrorists can get into the military. So can other sorts of people who
might do things they shouldn\'t with spacecraft.

Heck, just consider the number of deaths and amount of property damage
caused by freight train accidents! All those tank cars full of nasty
chemicals. Yet we don\'t control them any tighter than starships appear
to be controlled in Traveller.

In the Navy, they get assigned as "independent duty corpsman" to
smaller ships. They are the closest thing to a doctor those ships have.
And they wind up doing a *lot* of doctor type stuff. They just don\'t
get paid as much. 

Anybody with that sort of experience could probably get an MD degree
with just a bit more "theory" type work, and spending enough time
sitting in classrooms to keep the AMA happy.

It did. That\'s where the fireball came from. There\'s so much energy
that the "rock" (and much of what it hits) is converted to plasma at

You\'re right, if I had the actually radio in front of me I could come up
with far more realistic tasks.  But if fixing a broken radio is the main
thrust of an adventure the game has far more problems than I would care
to get into.

I would aggree with this.  But in the case of fixing a broken radio, no
matter how much detail you have it still comes down to a random throw
of the dice.  A smart player would do everything they can to insure that
random throw is very much in their favor.

Very good argument. In this case knowing the exact power reguirements
does allow the players some way to tell before the dice are rolled
what their chance for success is.

Why even bother flying through an asteroid belt?  Why not just drop out of

 ROFL!  Just one minor nit - the berg neutralized _inertia_, not
 mass.  To me, neutralization of mass means mixing it with an
 appropriate quantity of anti-mass - either our kind, or negamatter.

 Hmmm...  Maybe the berg should be an alternatech in FFS2?

As a matter of point.  The big black CT book only gave you the
rules for trading in general.  It did not specify that these
rules were for trading in the Imperium.  Same for psionics.

But this brings up a good question.  Does anyone have any insight
into what\'s happen with psionics in T4?

Discussion:

1)  There is no place on the USD chart to enter data on the Avionics (in 
my case, TL 11 Military) or communications (again, in my case, Improved 
TL-11).  Is this to be provided in the paragraph description, then?  Or 
did I miss something?

2)  The tables in the QSDS system should follow a standard format.  
Rather than having the Crew column in one place in one table and in 
another in a different table, put each column heading in the same place 
on each table.  if a column heading isn\'t needed for a given table, 
obviously just put the next one to the left that is needed in its place 
and adjust the others accordingly.  I found it bothersome to have to keep 
hunting for where the volume, price, crew, etc. were located on each table.

Other than those two quibbles, it is an excellent system!  Thanks, Guy!

    'from' => 'Charles Collin charles@hebb.psych.mcgill',
    'body' => 'Hi All.  

The following skill list is a modified version of the one the Mark Miller 
posted to the TML a while ago.  His list had 81 skills.  This one has a few 
more (total of 96 skills).  I\'ve tried to keep things basic, in light of 
several requests to KISS, but wish to say that I personally feel that 
keeping the number of skills down is unimportant.  It does not complicate 
things to have lots of skills.  One simply rolls against "Pistol, Slug" 
instead of "Firearms".  I don\'t see how this makes things any more 
complicated for players or GMs.


SPECIALIZATION 
For those of you who prefer a more detailed skill system, I suggest an
optional "specialization" rule, whereby one can pick a more specific area
within a discipline and recieve 1.5 * skill level (round down) in it while
recieving only .5 * skill level (round up) in every other aspect of that
skill.  Some GMs may wish to make this rule mandatory for some or all
skills.  At the same time, some GMs may wish to make specialization
unavailable for some or all skills. 

Note that the "specialization rule" also helps to resolve several 
controversies that have flared up on the list.  First Aid can now be a 
specialization of Medical, Theology a specialization of Philosophy, and 
so on.

Another advantage of the specialization rule is that it allows seamless 
creation of new skills by simply making them specializations under 
existing skills.  There will be no need to re-invent a bunch of tables 
every time you want to add new skills to the character generation system.

Okay, enough with the blather, here\'s the skill list.  As always, I would 
like to get as much feedback as I can.  Let me know what y\'all think!

(Also, let me know if this two-column format comes out readable).

SKILL LIST:

** Indicates a "new" skill that was not on MM\'s posted list.

# Indicates a skill which has been modified from MM\'s posted list.  i.e., 
the skill\'s name/scope has been changed, or it is now  part of a group of 
skills which represent what was a single skill on MM\' list.


***WEAPON SKILLS (17)*************************

Archaic Ranged Weapons #	Artillery
Automatic Weapons #			
Blade, Short #			Blade, Long #
Club, Heavy #			Club, Light #
Energy Weapons **		Firearms #
Flail **
Gunnery				Heavy Weapons
Laser Weapons **		Sonic Weapons **
Neural Weapons **		Throw
Unarmed Combat#			Polearm #

Notes:
	- Weapon skills should be understood to include high-tech 
variants (vibroblades, monofilament flails, stun sticks, gauss guns, etc.).
	- Gun combat and Blade combat have been reorganized to eliminate 
the need for cascades.  In terms of character generation, there will be 
need for Skill Clusters like in MegaTraveller.
	- Fencing is a specialization of "Blade, Long".
	- Archery has been replaced with the broader "Archaic Ranged 
Weapons" so that it can cover slings and such as well.
	- Armorer is a specialization under Craftsman (or Repair?).
	- Brawling and various martial arts are specializations under 
Unarmed Combat.
	- Several weapon skills which were not included on MM\'s list have 
been added for completeness (lasers, energy weapons, neural weapons).


***MILITARY SKILLS (7)*************************

Battledress			Demolitions
Hostile Enviro. Combat#		Forward Observer
Leadership			Recruiting ** 
Tactics

	-Environment combat is now "Hostile Environment Combat", which is 
clearer and has a cool acronym (HEC).
	-Recruiting has been added.  
	-Combat engineer is a specialty under Design.
	-Camouflage is a specialty under stealth.


***ACADEMIC SKILLS (16)***********************

Archeology			Astronomy#
Biology 				
Chemistry			Economics **
History				Instruction
Linguistics			Philosophy
Physics				Planetology **
Political Science **		Psioncology
Psychology			Research
Sophontology #			


Notes:
	- Several new fields have been added, especially in the area of 
the social sciences.
	- Botany and Zoology are specialties under biology.
	- Planetolgy = "Geology", Sophontology = "Anthropology".
	- Theology is a specialization under philosophy.
	- Astrogation or Astrography can be spec\'s under Astronomy.


***CRIMINAL/POLICE SKILLS (10)******************

Bribery				Disguise				
Forensics			Forgery				
Gambling			Interrogation			
Intrusion			Investigation		
Stealth				Streetwise

Notes:
	-Fast Talk and Intimidation are specializations of Persuasion.
	-Pickpocket is a spec of Intrusion.


***TECHNICAL SKILLS (20)*********************

Aircraft			Communications
Computer			Craftsman
Designer ** 			Engineer
Farming **			Grav Craft 	
Ground Craft #			Hover Craft #
Navigation 			Robotic Ops. #
Photography **			Pilot 
Prospecting **			Repair #
Riding #			Sensor Ops.
Vacc Suit			Water Craft

Notes:
	- Vehicle skills have been re-organized somewhat.
	- Equestrian has been replaced by the more general "Riding".
	- Electronics, Mechanics, Gravitics and Robotics (in terms of
repair/maintenance) are specializations under Repair (or Designer if one
wants to create complex new items).  Designer is an engineer (in the 20th
century sense).
	- Ship\'s Boat is a specialization under Pilot.


***PROFESSIONAL SKILLS (15)********************

Acting#				Art#
Administration			Animal Care **
Bargain **			Broker
Dance #
Diplomacy 			Law
Medicine			Music #
Politics **			Steward
Trader				Writing #

Notes:
	-Performance has been replaced by separate skills (acting, art, 
dance, music, writing).
	-First Aid is a specialization under Medicine.
	-Animal care includes such things as training, husbandry, 
herding, etc.

***OTHER SKILLS (10)**************************

Athletics			Carousing
Jack-of-all-Trades		Survival
Language (pick one)		Observation **
Orienteering **			Persuasion **
Reconnaissance			Survey 		

Notes:
	-Each Language is a seperate skill (English, French).  
Specializations would be for specific dialects (Quebec French, Parisien 
French) or specific uses (reading, writing, speaking).
	-Orienteering covers navigation on world surfaces, while 
Navigation covers jump space and pilot cover real space.


Okay, that it from me.  Again, any and all (non-flame) feedback is 
appreciated.

Happy Travelling,
Charles.

I feel the same about Marc Miller, Stu.  One of the reasons I\'m so 
excited about T4 is that Marc\'s back at the helm...and that is something 
I\'ve never seen before.  What I mean is, every time I\'ve ever liked a 
product or company (Apple, Atari, GDW), the person(s) who provided the 
vision either gets pushed out or leaves of his own accord, thereafter the 
products become less and less like the original stuff that attracted me 
and caused me to make the purchase(s).  Never before (in the case of the 
things I like) has the visionary returned to the product.  I am so happy 
it turned out different this time!

I KNEW I recognized you!  You\'re one of my many characters

Seriously, I\'ve always thought that the failure rules for tech were either too

Pop Quiz:  Anybody else out there in the US market seen the previews for the
new flick "ID4"?  \'Independence Day 4\'?  The previews don\'t really show much
of ortillery, but the White House gets blasted, which is cool...  2 July the aliens
show up, 3 July they blow up every target of opportunity, 4 July the directors
think that we\'ll be fighting back...  

Anybody disagree?  I know that Mr. Elliott <gpvll@hk.super.net> does:

If this is the case, how the hell do we win?  Sounds like T2k all over...  ;-(

I guess we in the cowboy state are all set then, eh?  Horses anyone?  ;-P

There has been lots of SF about indigenous species holding off the EWGR
(Evil White Guys Reincarnated) for quite a long time with very low tech
weapons using, one would suppose, only home field advantage and great
esprit.  Now, if they have any kind of other advantages it makes it even
harder, i.e. limited teleportation (Drake\'s _At Any Price_).

Does anybody have players out there who enjoy being at the bottom of
the food chain/gravity well to start with?  I sure don\'t.  My TNE players 
never forgave me for introducing them with a rewrite of "Idol Dreams"...  
(The few plasma rifles they had to start off with were empty by the time 
they reached the warehouse district...)

        Wrong.  Normandy would be buried under a layer approximately 1.4 km
deep of rocks and rough gravel :).

        Well, as I\'ve said, I\'ll concede that _complete_ suppression may be
impossible.  I still think that _trying_ to do so before dropping in the PBI
is going to be the route a prudent commander takes.

        Yes!  YES!  Patrick O\'Brian is, in my opinion, a near-deity.  He
makes C.S. Forester look like a talentless hack.  It\'s too bad he writes in
a "genre", because otherwise, he\'d be getting oodles of recognition.

        I\'d agree; I think that the O\'Brian books are about as good as
you\'re going to get as far as portrayals of the sort of social dynamics that
you\'d find on board of ship of that period, and that that might provide some
inspiration for an SF rpg, but aside from that I\'d stick to SF sources...

Classic Traveller was not intertwined with the Imperium.

Ah but the problem with the game system embedded with the rules is that
you have to do alot of work to extract it. 


Traveller has more structure and more defined things than GURPS does. Its
alot easier to design a game in Traveller since certain technology 
decisions have already been made by the game. I think that the Imperium
background is interesting, but I don\'t want it shoved down my throat so 
I can play a game.

This was argued out in sci.space and the rec.arts.sf groups *years*
back. The problem is this:

Your ship is at rest. KE=0

Your "reactionless" drive accelerates it to 1 km/s. Let\'s call your
new KE 1, just to make things simple.

Okay, now you want to get to 2 km/s. That makes your KE *4*. And thus,
if conservation of energy holds, it took three times as much power to
get to 2 km/s as it took to get to 1. To get to 10 km/s will take 99
times the energy it took to get to 1 km/s.

See the problem? Hell, I bet the power plant fuel required to get to 30
km/s is bigger than the maneuver fuel required to get to 30 km/s with a
reaction drive! 

Another problem is that you have to measure your velocity (and thus
momentum and KE) *relative* to some outside object. And the figures
relative to an object with a different vector will be different. 

So any "reactionless" drive is going to have to be figuring the energy
consumption relative to *some* body. And that means that for all
practical purposes you are "pushing" (or pulling!) on that object.

The reason a reaction drive is so much more efficient is that it is
pushing on it\'s *exhaust*, and therefore you measure the KE change
relative to *that*. 

There are two "reactionless" drives we\'ve come up with that don\'t have
the problem. One is the negamatter drive. That\'s where you have a large
chunk of *dense* negamatter (matter with *negative* mass) and move by
varying the distance between it and a chunk of normal matter. This
works because both the inertial *and* gravitational mass are negative.
So there is a repulsive force between the two chunks, but the negative
matter "feels" that as an *attractive* force. Conservation works
because the negamatter has *negative* momentum and KE.

The other sort of "reactionless" drive can work in a bunch of
differenty ways, but they all amount to changing your *position*
without changing your *velocity*. 

For example, create an artificial gravity well 100 meters in front of
the ship. The ship and the gravity well fall *towards* each other. Net
KE and momentum change: 0. You "uncreate" the well before it gets too
close. But in doing so, you\'ll hasve to absorb it\'s KE and momentum. So
you resume your orginal momentum and KE. But you are now in a different
position. There are *many* different variations on this theme. I
suggest calling all of them "bootstrap" drives (as in pulling yourself
up by your boot straps).

All you need for this is a "field" drive. Say a reaction drive that
uses gravity to push the ship one way while pushing the reaction mass
the other way. This amounts to being the Traveller "thrust
compensators" anyway.

It\'d try to form a sphere, but how well it succeeds depends on how much
energy there was in the impact, and how strong what it hit was. You
usually will wind up with the fireball being bigger than the crater.
And if someone was tossing asteroids around, it\'s possible to get a
fireball that\'s too big to rise! (ie the radius of the fireball is
greater than the distance from the ground to the point where you can
forget about the atmosphere)

Sorry, this is home turf and I have to open my mouth (you can help me

Modern  tank weaponry is comparable to a dumb version of what you are
describing here.  The prefered anti armor round in the US Army is the
APDSFSDU round, (yes, FF&S had the nomenclature correct.).  And just for the
record, the M-833 series ammo used on the 105mm main gun weighs in at
roughly 5 kilos and has a muzzle V of 1635 meters per second (nominal).  I
may be a little off on the mass though (I haven\'t loaded one of the beasties
in over 5 years).  The 120mm gun weighs more, moves faster (~1825 meters per
second) and hits much harder.

When one of these monsters strike, they punch a hole in the hull / armor,
enter the inside of the vehicle and often exit the other side in the same
manner.  All of the material that was once where the hole now is becomes
various sized mini projectiles bouncing around the inside of the target
(mincing up the crew, ammo, fuel, electronics, etc.)  The effects can be
quite devastating.  There are all sorts of proverbial stories told to
newbies about enemy crews getting sucked out of the exit hole (about 3-4 cm
in diameter) from the overpressure when a closed hatch vehicle is hit.  I\'ve
never seen this happen though and can\'t comment on the likelyhood (other
than to say "yea, right".)  

BTW, a tip of the hat to the folks who wrote FF&S.  You guys did some
outstanding research on the CPR penetrator stuff.  When I first saw it, I
thought I was back at Fort Knox taking AIT all over again.  Good job.

There is also an old naval addage that goes "the shore battery always has
the advantage over a ship, because it can not be sunk."  Big rocks are great
for operation "Crush and Burn", but those meson gun deep mounts can really
ruin you day.  (just ask one of my players!)  Still, there is nothing to
prevent some sick minded group from hitching a 5000 ton(d) jump shuttle to a
large fast moving rock and jumping it in at JUST the right angle . . .

Our local group also plays FRP and Runequest is a standard with us.  We so
liked the Imperium but so disliked CT back in the early \'80s that we played
\'Runes in Space\', taking quite a bit from \'Other Suns\' (FGU) and ALL of the
backround from CT...  Until MT, this was my exposure to Traveller...

  It\'s *real* simple to justify not reaching c with inertial dampers:
drag. Yes, I said DRAG. Interstellar space is NOT empty. In fact, even
(especially!) ordinary reaction drives will be limited to much less than c
because the drag of interstellar gases as one approaches c is VERY
significant and the exhaust velocity of your drive then becomes critical
in determining howclose you can get to c. Of course, mass dilation
complicates this as well.

   This is _real_ easy to sidestep, in fact you mention the key later in
your post: relativity. How do you measure KE? *Always* with respect to
some frame of reference. The ship might have KE=1 with respect to a given
planet, and KE=400 with respect to another. How do you reconcile the
differences given the *exponential* nature of the KE equation? (Think
about this for a minute, it\'ll come to you) The energy equations - even
with a reaction drive - will give you strange answers.

   The other question is (obviously) how do you justify the reactionless
drive? If it\'s "pushing" against a planet, or some other body (perhaps the
"fabric" of space itself?) then you have a thorny dilemma...how _do_ you
explain the energy conservation problem? OTOH, if you use one of the
"bootstrap" drives you mention, this point is moot because the frame of
reference has no more validity than it does with a reaction drive. IMO,
this is the *only* kind of reactionless drive that *can* possibly work
anyways....

   My personal favourite is the "Trans-gravitic Interphased Subspace
Anomaly" drive. (TISA for short) I got that name from Space Opera and it\'s
stuck with me ever since I read it. It\'s the artificial-gravity-well idea
you mention. I\'ve loved that idea since I read _The Gentle Giants of
Ganymede_ by Hogan.

  Yep. So why can\'t a reactionless drive be pushing on *itself*? <g>
We *are* talking about a reaction*less* drive! I contend that all you
would have to pay for is the *force* you exert on the ship, same as any
reaction drive. *Nothing* else makes any sense at all, as you\'ve surely
figured out judging from your post.

   There is another way to compensate G forces, and we almost have the
tech to do this today - massive plates ahead of the crew cabin. Mount the
cabin on a stalk behind the plate with the stalk terminating in the drive
you happen to be using. The plate is massive enough to generate
gravitational forces in it\'s own right, to nullify G just slide the cabin
towards the plate (or away) as thrust changes. Of course, to be of any use
power has to be damn close to free to make this practical.

And perform a lot of the treatments at Navy Hospitals too.

I asked my Marine brother-in-law about it tonight.  Yes, senior
corpsmen are assigned to smaller ships, and they also are assigned to
larger Marine units in the field.  

My sister said she and the kids were treated by corpsmen at the the
base hospital at their last duty station (overseas), and *mostly* by
corpsmen back here.  They both said they\'d rather have a corpsman
treating them than most doctors, because they take more time, listen
to what you have to say, and seem more careful.

My understanding is a senior corpsman can prescribe
drugs/medicines, perform minor surgery, and do just about anything
else a GP could do, BUT do it under the "supervision" of a regular
doctor.  From what they told me, it sounds like supervision is taken
*very* loosely.

>Anybody with that sort of experience could probably get an MD degree

Last time I went to my doctor, I was actually treated by a
Nurse/Practitioner, a former corpsman.  He *did* spend more time with
me, and I liked his not-so-superior attitude.  After he talked to me,
he told me what tests he wanted to run, left the room to "talk to the
doctor", came back and walked me through the tests at the clinic (a
doctor wouldn\'t have stayed with me), he and the doctor "consulted" on
the test results, and he came back with a prescribed treatment.  Did
the treatment come from the doctor?  Well, the MD signed off on it,
but the N/P *really* did the prescribing..how do I know?  After he
came back with the prescription, he talked to me a little me and
*changed* the prescription.

So let\'s relate this to Traveller! <g>  

We have a *very* structured medical system in the USA biased toward
involving an MD in virtually every procedure.  Other countries have
other systems.  The UK system isn\'t like the US system.  The Japanese
do it differently, so do the Russians.

...and we are talking about societies 5000 years in our future. Does a
Sylean Medical Association even exist?  

I don\'t think we can model the medical practices of the Imperium on
the US medical system.

If you are going to accelerate a rock/ship/nerf ball/whatever to

Why not assume that the thruster plates are unable to run continuously for

This is getting repetitive. How would the TNE haters amongst us like it if those
of us who thought The New Era brought a lot of good things to Traveller started
referring to CT as Children\'s Traveller? (Kiddies Trav for short) The New Era
may have had a background some people disagreed with, but in general it featured
the most sophisticated writing Traveller has seen, and the loss of that is
something to be regretted, not crowed about.

Might I suggest that everyone out there accept that all three iterations of the
game had good features, even if they may have disagreed with some of them. Stop
damning a system simply because you didn\'t personally like some aspect of it and
accept that others may see value in it - there\'s a whole universe out there,
there should be room for all of us, and room to give respect to something that
people put a lot of work into, such as by calling it by its correct name instead
of something insulting that might have been semi-funny the first time it was
heard, but has rapidly grown stale and annoying.

Some other persons said something about modern ammunition with let the armor
melt and ignate fire. Wouldn\'t a space station have some defense weapons to
be able to destroy a kamikaze ship? Something like let the ship burn itself
away, using its own kinetik energy against it somehow? 

Wouldn\'t a normal, non-streamlined ship burn away in the atmosphere, anyway?
Woudn\'t it break apart because of the hull stress? Or wouldn\'t it possible
to destory it by let it expode and hoping that the fragments are small
enough to only produce some impressing glowing at the sky?

Some explatations should exists to keep the Traveller "feel", IMHO.

Because the immense number of digits, I\'ll keep it short.

When invading a world, I can\'t believe that a sane soldier would agree in
using a one-way-ticket in a flying casket. An armored grav transport may be
a larget target but it\'s psychologically better and offers the opportunity
to retreat back to orbit.

Destroying the world by orbital bombardment isn\'t an option in my oppionion
because killing millions of civilians gives a very bad press and probably
even the invading fleet\'s commanders wouldn\'t give that order.

The defending army can\'t destroyed easily if their troops and command
centers are highly mobil. The invader also cannot destroy all supply-camps
or construction plants because he needs to support, too. It\'s the defender,
who has the larger resources and so has the better chances.

But woudn\'t modern targetting equipment allow to automatically target each
intruder and burn him away? Something like an anti-parachuter gun? If they
use ordinary parachutes, it\'s enough to destroy their robes. Otherwise, it
might be possible to distorb their anti-grav units and let them drop like
stone to ground. Finally, the guy\'s on ground will probably have to same
battle dresses and the same weapons.

With my first question, which started this thread, I meant the capture of
the world, so Craig Berry list of actions would be true and the option to
blast away the surface of the planet isn\'t.

>1. Gain space superiority.

Let\'s assume 1. isn\'t possible. You can break space defense and get your
transports to the landing zone but reinforcement from other worlds might
normally prevent space superiority. However, they can\'t use ortillery either.

So 2. isn\'t an option for both sides.

My next question is, why not exchange 3. and 4. For me, it seems more
natural to more persevering heavy grav tanks than vulnerable infantry. To
capture ground installations, you\'ll need foot troops, of course, but to
establish a bridgehead you would need heavier combat equipment.

Well, if not, they have perhaps fight a second war at home, supressing their
own people, too. It might work a couple of years, but rebellion would
probably occur.

Sound good. Star Wars has a similar system, where you get additional dices
when specializing. Perhaps this is the only way to deal with the complexity
of a modern world in a game?

The factor or bonus would depend on the task system rules, I assume. Btw,
does anybody know what this system might look like?

But was C&S a success? I doubt. Harnmaster has a very good world
description, but awful complex rules and also failed to become really
successful. On Germany the most successful RPG ("Das Schwarze Auge") has
also the easiest rules (about the complexity of D&D).

And a comment on the original subject. I think, it\'s easier to add more
skill then to drop existing skills. One good objection by someone was that
the character generation system has to allow the addition of more skills.

Giant rocks yes but a 100 tonne mass rock moving at 0.1c  would be nearly 
as dangerous even though it would completely vaporize before it hit the 
surface.

It\'s pointless to try to bend Traveller physics around the problem when 
it would be much easier to deal with it as one would in the real 
universe where it is a real problem. The mindset of the traveller 
society would be that only a psycopath would drop a rock on a 
planet. Anyone caught doing that would be treated like a psycopath.

I think that the Imperial Rules of War need to be slightly rewritten.
Instead of a prohibition on the use of nukes, it should prohibit the use
of indiscriminate weapons of mass destruction.  This would include
rocks, and bio weapons.  Yield would be the isssue, though in the case
of rocks.  Crowbars taking out military units is fine, asteroids taking
out cities is wrong.

A nut could decide to do it----and maybe it happens.  A decent hook,
actually. in fact it was used in an old adventure in JTAS, wasn\'t it?

I am in favor of a delta v limit on t-plates to prevent a terrorist
weapon (city killer) from becoming a planet buster.  I lean towards just
reminding players/refs that the ship moving at very high relative
velocities to the junk in solar orbit is at reasonable risk of great
harm.  Enogh so that a planet killer will end up absorbing a huge amount
of energy from small impacts along the way.  Enough that it has a much
reduced chance of ever reaching its target (why intercept witj a missile
when an interplanetary dust grain will kill the thing just as dead?).

This is a good idea.  Course, David, I wouldn\'t expect too much, I\'ve been
harping on this for months.  Hopefully MMT will be a good enough bridge to
unite all of us under a common denomonator and not be a "Mickey Mouse
Traveller."   No offence to the guys at IG or FFE and definitely none to MM.
I think they are trying their best to reconcile everyone without alienating
anyone.  Unfortunately, you will always have some people who don\'t care what
you do, if its not their ideas in print they wont accept it!

Thanks for the vocal agreement!

Bob, I\'ve got a saying for you:

"You can please some of the people some of the time, and some of the 
people all of the time, but you can\'t please ALL of the people ALL of 
the time."

I\'ve debated various issues with Phil over the last several months, and 
rarely have I electronically discussed anything with someone who has 
less ability to LISTEN to anyone else\'s opinion objectively.

I don\'t lament his loss to this list, nor do I think the goal of the 
list or the game for that matter, should be to accommodate every single 
player. I\'ve played the game since 1980, from CT through TNE. When I 
heard the new game was going to use CT as its basis, I wasn\'t terribly 
pleased, but I didn\'t bellyache about it either. I will continue to 
follow Traveller avidly.

Now that Phil feels the shoe\'s on the other foot, he\'s flipping the 
board, collecting his toys and going home. Well, good riddance!

>>We can do without your petty gloating, how old are you?<<

If you really must know, I was born in -2551 Imperial dating. And as far 
as "doing without" my petty gloating, I was far from alone in doing so, 
Bob, old boy. 

>>I really hope T4 will be a good product, though I fear it\'ll be
something less.<<

If your expectations are too high, you will undoubtedly be disappointed. 
Just realize that the makers of the game are doing their damnedest to 
make a quality marketable product. And make the best of it.

Regarding the problem of the "planet killing launch", I have an
idea.  Marc Miller has stated (in his "Foundations of Traveller" post)
that Thruster plates are gravitically based and that they work by pushing
off worlds and suns.  Could we not therefore say that the effectiveness of
T-plates drops with distance from these bodies?  This would put some sort 
of limiting factor on speeds, would it not?  For instance, you could not 
"accelerate in from pluto" because you would lose thrust as you moved 
away from the planet.  You\'d drift until you came across another body to 
push against.  

This might also solve the problem of conservation of energy.  Simply say 
that by some mumbo-jumbo the the ship robs momentum from the world it is 
pushing against.

I haven\'t thought through the specifics of this, so feel free to bash away.  
I\'m sure this has been brought up before, but I don\'t remember the 
conclusions reached.

Gotta second this.

Funny thing is, I remember reading in 1 of Joe Heck\'s postings of the 
AOL conferences that Marc was taking the tack that since he wasn\'t 
going to be able to do what everybody wanted, he was going to do what 
he wanted and hope that enough people liked it...

I think he had the right tack.  Not everybody is going to like 
everything about T4, but frankly it sounds like its going to be 
taking some of the best parts from each:  Task resolution similar to 
MT, Ship design based on FF&S (& simplified iterations of it), and 
character generation based on CT, with good ideas stolen from MT & 
TNE.  Looks like it\'ll be a blend of some ideas from all 3 previous 
systems, and some new stuff as well...

Personally, I think the 2 best ideas he had was not rewriting any of 
the canon (including virus), and by stating that JTAS will support 
all eras.  This essentially means that he\'ll be supporting all 3 
previous incarnations of the game, while developing an independent 
4th.  This "should" have the effect of alienating as few people as 
possible.  But, there are some people who are going to take the "One 
True Faith" approach to whatever era is their favorite.  So be it.  
As long as they are willing to realize that others might have 
different ideas and different opinions...  This is where Phil fell 
down.  On the other hand, Chris, you could probably tone down the 
rhetoric a little bit as well...

I am of the opinion, even if I don\'t like parts of the history, the 
amount of development put into the history of the Imperium, which 
almost rivals that of Star Trek, and dwarfs Star Wars, that without 
the Imperium backdrop (in whatever form, Virus, Rebellion, 
Pre-Rebellion), Traveller would have died a long time ago.  

Plus there is a good side/dark side to the Imperium, which makes it feel a 
lot more real to me than either one.  In Star Trek, the heroes are 
always white knights, the villains are always humans in funny suits.  
Hell, I\'ve seen campaigns in Traveller where the PC\'s were being 
almost as scummy as the people they were trying to doublecross, 
defeat, or stop.  The nice moral dilemmas presented in the game at 
times (lots of times, in my adventures), just make the future seem 
more real.

My point as well.  Just put the background in the back of the book, 
not in the middle of the character generation system, as was done in 
TNE.

Definitely.  Even a casual glance at the current RPG market will show the 
attraction of the setting VS the rules.

And strangely, no matter where they go in the universe (even to a 
quadrant never visited by humans), everyone they encounter speaks 
English.  What an amazing coincidence. :)

Right.  The Imperium isn\'t some benevolent entity run for the benefit of 
all intelligent races.  They have rivals that aren\'t portrayed as evil, 
as the Klingon\'s originally were (and now, the Cardassians and Kazon).  

And, of course, as you point out the characters aren\'t expected to be on 
some moralistic mission to bring sweetness and light to the universe.  
The characters are expected to have their own goals and ethics, developed 
by each individual player.  

That\'s about as realistic as you can get.

Yup.  As I\'ve said before, the format taken in The Traveller Book works 
well.  The rules are up front, the setting and a few adventures are in 
the back.  (\'course, in T4 I\'d expect to see a little more of the setting 
than was in The Traveller Book.)

 But not everyone that plays RPGs feels they have the kind of
 imagination necessary to do this.  A background "canon" relieves
 them of the need to do this.  It also does not prohibit the GM who
 _can_ do this from doing so.  The first Traveller GM I ever had
 was like this.  He never ran anything but the published
 adventures.  Since I had not started purchasing Traveller at that
 point, nothing was "spoiled" for me; I still remember how much I
 enjoyed leading a party that "solved" the Annic Nova.

 Some GMs that _can_ manage their own adventures still like _their_
 work to conform to "the real universe" as the publisher envisions
 it.  I\'m like this, because at times, my players and I have taken
 turns GMing, and I also had an agreement with some other local GMs
 to allow character/materil "exchange" - in order to ensure that
 nobody screwed up anyone else\'s campaigns, we agreed to use the
 GDW background, and to discuss before running anything that
 represented a potentially serious departure from the "canon".

 T:TNE did seem to have a higher level of skill generation than T
 or MT.  But what I felt was the best part of T:TNE\'s character
 generation was the concept of "contacts".  For some reason, it
 never occurred to me to implement this in T or MT.  After some
 recent discussion here, I see how I _could_ implement it in T, and
 therefore, I assume, in IG/MMT.

 To an extent, I agree - but to an extent, I also disagree.
 Certain kinds of technology are going to have potentially
 significant effects on the background, and certain kinds of
 changes to the background have a major effect on the entire feel
 of the game.  For example, if Jump engines can transmit energy
 into and out of Jump space, then FTL communications become
 possible, and this potentially changes one of the core assumptions
 of Traveller, which is that a ship is the fastest way to get info
 from point a to point b.  This kind of universe is going to have a
 completely different "feel" from the canonical universe.  Thus, I
 the publisher must, in the process of explaining the design of the
 system, must provide the rationale for the assumptions that I have
 made.  You\'re free to change those assumptions - but you need to
 know what you\'re changing, first.

 The computer rules of T _were_ an abortion.  I (and the GMs I
 exchanged with) chucked those out immediately, and wrote a set of
 rules that we felt were more realistic.  We had no compunctions
 about doing this (our discussions were only to ensure we all
 agreed on _what_ rules to use), because no rationale was given,
 and we felt that our changes did _not_ significantly alter the
 "feel" of the canonical universe.

 30 responses to a survey constitute a "statistically significant"
 sample.  The primary flaw in that survey was that it was
 self-selecting, not that it had a small sample size.
 Self-selecting surveys tend to select the "extremists" in any
 population; if the survey questions are biased, you\'ll tend to get
 more responses from those who disagree with the bias.

 I never responded to that survey, as I recall.  My view pretty
 much matches what the survey showed - Having an FFS-type system is
 required, for when a gearhead like me needs/wants to sit down and
 figure out how big to make the glove compartment, and how much
 power the courtesy light inside it requires; but one of the first
 things I did with FFS was to build half a list of standard
 components to just plug together when I needed the general info on
 a ship, and the designs that came from that which I felt were
 generally good enough to be a "standard" went into a folder for
 preselection as needed.  Having all three kinds of systems, _and_
 _making_them_compatible_, gives you the ability to satisfy
 _everyone_ - not just the gearheads who like to calculate the
 power consumption of LEDs on the consoles, not just the "gimme a
 ship and don\'t bother me" shootemup GMs, and not just the "hey, I
 need a non-standard ship like this - but I don\'t really care about
 whether the lights are low-power blues or high-power yellows".

 If you don\'t agree with the FFS philosophy, don\'t use it

 True.  But for me, that was actually a good thing; most of JTAS

 The T$R lawsuit hurt GDW - but I think that GDW\'s ultimately fatal
 mistake happened well before that lawsuit - when they stopped
 concentrating on their premier line and tried branching out into
 other genres and other systems.  T:2300 (later called 2300AD)
 offered nothing over Traveller, and had no connection with
 Traveller, except the (original) name.  Dark Conspiracy had
 nothing going for it - by that time, gothic horror gaming was
 already pass.  Cadillacs and Dinosaurs was an idea whose time had
 not yet come - and hopefully never will!  Dangerous Dimensions
 (Dangerous Journeys) was an attempt to take market share from
 Dungeons and Dragons - and by that time, T$R had such a commanding
 position in that market (and such a commanding number of bucks to
 protect that position) that anyone could have seen that any
 attempt would have been foredoomed.  To then ask E. Gary Gygax, of
 all people, to be the driving force behind it was effectively
 waving a red flag in front of a bull, and saying "sure, go ahead,
 sue us."  Not that EGG necessarily did a bad job (never looked at
 it; don\'t know) - but almost anything in the pre-technological
 high fantasy field was risky, simply because of T$R\'s notoriety
 in the field - any new entrant would virtually have _had_ to look
 derivative.

 GDW was a small company, always - what was the cost to Traveller
 development of all of these other projects, not to mention the
 ill-fated lawsuit? Certainly, it was pretty high, as I saw more
 stuff from DGP than from GDW - and it was of higher quality, since
 DGP wasn\'t dividing their efforts. When people started losing
 faith in Traveller, because of an apparent lack of both interest
 and support from GDW, _that\'s_ when it became apparent that GDW
 was in trouble - and in spite of their protestations otherwise,
 they stayed in trouble right to the end.

 Just out of curiosity - can you think of any RPG company that
 "made it" - independently - in more than one genre (Don\'t count
 Steve Jackson Games; they\'ve licensed quite a lot of their
 setting materil from other publishers)? Or that had more than one
 top-selling game?

I can\'t load it into WordPerfect for Windows 6.0 either.  Heck, even a 
straight ASCII conversion would be nice.  

Similarly, the spreadsheets can\'t be loaded into my copy of Quattro Pro 
for Windows.  It can load Excel for DOS files, but not Excel for Windows 
files. :(  Again, even an ASCII delimited file would be nice, and it\'s a 
conversion that should be available in any spreadsheet program.

Well, from a PFC\'s point of view, it seemed to involve way to much shovel
work while in MOPP4 gear (full chemical warfare gear).  What was new was the
cammo nets that we erect over the vehicles.  Those had tech-reps hovering
around them like nervous hens.  I heard rumors of other odd goings-on, but
for me it was hiding in the bottom of a well camoflagued hole.  (Which I
shared with a scorpion for a brief time, but that\'s another story...)

We found out that the experiment had worked back when we got back to Ft.
Benning, and were given a four day weekend for our good work.

Let me put it this way:  For nearly 50 years, the US Army has kept an
infantry division in Korea.  The terrain is murderous, the weather goes from
sub-zero blizzards, to 100 degree summers.  A large segment of the South
Koreans don\'t want us there.  And in the case of war with the North, the 2nd
Infantry Division will be attacked by at *least* 6 NK Division.. two of them
armored.

People volunteer to go there.  I volunteered to go there.

Soldiers do the hard jobs for a variety of reasons.. whether out of desire
to "be all that they can be", a thirst for adventure, or a true sense of duty.

As for transports being better psychologically...  you\'ve never been
buttoned up in an M-113 APC, unable to see, hear, or run away.  You are a
sitting target for any Hind helicopter or RPG gunner.  That is nerve racking
to say the least.  Any infantryman worth his salt wants to be in his natural
enviroment: face down in the dirt behind a tree.

Dead men tell no tales.  But to use a planet\'s resources, you need the
infrastructure.  That\'s why the German Reich were so happy to set up Vichy
France.

Hit the transportation grid.  Something train-like will survive well into
the Imperium.  Don\'t believe me?  Try designing a grav vehicle capable of
carrying 900,000 tons of frieght at 75mph.

Dead batteries, system destroyed by explosion, contractor skimped.  As for
battledress, that is very a expensive item; better to spend the money on
Light Anti-Armor Weapons (issued by the US as rounds of ammo rather than
weapons.)

The Guide to Killing Tankers:  Strip them of their infantry.  Tankers are
vulnerable to infantry, and not really able to respond..  They are trapped
inside, for fear that the first time they stick their head outside a hatch,
7.62mm of vengence will meet your skull at 2600fps.

Think back to every invasion in WWII.. Armor led *one*, at Dieppe (sp?),
where the Canadians got their heads handed to them.  D-Day was spearheaded
by 4 Airborne Divisions.  Strangely enough, you have to make it safe for the
tanks, and their immense logisical tail.

I agree with David\'s suggestions, and would add the Dominic Flandry series
by Poul Anderson.  _Ensign Flandry_, _Flandry of Terra_, _Agent of the
Terran Empire_, and _Flandry, Defender of Terra_ (and some other books
involving his successor) which seem to be re-released every few years,
compile nearly all of the Flandry stories in chronological order (i.e., in
terms of Flandry\'s life; the order of publication or writing is, I think,
completely different).  I\'ve always thought that Traveller\'s creators were
much inspired by these stories, which have exotic atmospheres; unusual local
governments; varying tech levels; and an empire and nobles.

referee can make up a skill if it\'s needed for his or her particular
campaign.  For this reason, the official skill list should not be overlong.
Specifically, medical skill should not be subdivided into many sub-skills,
like first aid and psychiatry (and dentistry, podiatry, ophthalmology,
etc.).  Nevertheless, a case can be made for having each of these skills in
a particular campaign (e.g., one revolving around the INS St. Elsewhere, a
Imperial Navy hospital ship travelling through the Spinward Marches after
the Fifth Frontier War).  

The following are my last comments on psychiatry as a potential skill.  I\'m
not suggesting that it be an "official" skill.

They don\'t have to be (and notice the locution here; Traveller is nothing if
not flexible).  Often a family practitioner (med-3) will examine a patient
and conclude: "He has a mental problem, and needs to see a psychiatric
specialist.  I can\'t help him."  
One approach in game terms is the following:  The family practitioner
applied his med-3 (and probably edu/5) to the task "diagnose illness," which
is always an uncertain task. The psychiatrist (med-3, psych-2, maybe,
following my model that a psychiatrist is trained as an M.D., then gets
specialized training) would also apply his psych skill, possibly to reduce
difficulty level rather than as a DM.

>Why not just use interrogation?

The party may not have a member with interrogation.  In Traveller, there is
usually more than one way to skin the cat.  If you don\'t have cat-skinning,
try jack-of-all-trades. A case could be made for applying med skill to
removing the cat\'s skin.

I\'m not talking about needing a license to give out drugs; that\'s a matter
of local law.  I mean the ability to give the right drug, in the right
dosage, at the right time, with the knowledge of what other drug might be an
adequate substitute, and of what deleterious effects might occur.  Medical
skill can be applied to the task roll, but psych or pharmacology might bring
the difficulty level down.

You may not have been following the recent discussion about the use of
social skills.  I subscribe to the idea that in general any significant
event should be role-played.  Sometimes the player (as opposed to the
character) doesn\'t have the skill to carry it out.  For example, I know
someone who couldn\'t sell water in the desert.  If she were playing a
character with, let\'s say, trader-2 and broker-1, I\'d let her roll the dice
to, in effect, enhance her character\'s sales pitch.

This "silly Canadian" didn\'t have a "problem".  It was part of a closing remark

There are actually two debates going on sort of interwoven with one 
another, and it\'s time we pulled them apart.  One concerns the 
"planet-killer lifeboat" problem, and is unique to thruster plates.  
This is the one you seem to be addressing -- without somehow limiting 
total acceleration, any random spacecraft can back up to a long distance, 
start accelerating toward the planet at 1+ g, and hit at an appreciable 
fraction of c, causing massive planetwide havoc.  The fact that (in 
canonical Trav history) this has never been recorded to happen is 
well-nigh inexplicable, unless factors are at work which have not been 
described.

Your solution to the problem, though, is not sufficient; all it means is 
that I have to back my lifeboat farther out into the Oort cloud before 
starting the suicide run.  "Accelerate, cool, accelerate, cool, repeat" 
builds up velocity more slowly than continuous acceleration, but heck, I 
can wait. :)  The only simple way to solve the killer lifeboat problem is 
with severe (a.k.a. "realistic") fuel limitations, a la HEPlaR.  Alas, 
severe fuel limitation also makes the game less fun (most players don\'t 
consider watching the gas gauge to be the height of role-playing 
enjoyment), and (perhaps more important) it\'s going non-canonical again 
in MMT.

The other current thread of debate involves more traditional "rock
dropping," not at relativistic velocities but at around (the order of)
planetary escape velocities -- 10s of km/s.  It takes a *big* rock to
trash a planet at 20 km/s, but much smaller rocks (or crowbars, or
telephone poles) can do nasty things to smaller targets, as has been
discussed.  This tactic works regardless of the drive you assume, though
thrusters do make *gathering* rocks much easier, and probably make it
possible to deliver rocks more quickly once you decide to do so. 

The frightening things about the rock-dropping trick are how easy it is to 
do, and how how hard it is to counter.  See Heinlein\'s "The Moon is a 
Harsh Mistress" for a lesson in the military advantages of holding the 
(very) high ground.

While it IS true that there are non-combat billets in the Army, and none 
in the Marine Corps, the Army STILL teaches ALL soldiers how to handle an 
Assault rifle.  It\'s part of Basic training.  At least it was when I was 
in.  (1974-1978)

Actually, I bought CT when it first came out (oops, my age is showing.)  
And there was no universe then.  I came up with quite a good universe 
all on my own.  And with no experience started running Traveller with a 
group of 4 people that grew to 15 in about 3 weeks.  That game ran for 
two years.  (I moved).  But then the Imperium came out.  After I got out 
of the Army and move to Chicagoland, I started a game that lasted for 3 
years, with the number of players ranging from 5 to 20, averaging 12.
These were generally all day events.  

But basically, I didn\'t really need the Imperium background.  It was nice 
but generally, I found it to be more of a nuisance, mostly because 
EVERYONE bought the damn stuff, and I had players who knew more about 
certain parts of the Imperium then I did, or for that matter, they knew 
more than their PC\'s should have known.  It\'s hard to control that kind 
of stuff.

Since I intended one of the 400-ton hulls for this purpose, I\'m glad you
were able to make it work out well.  :-)

A couple of comments about your design:

> Tons:  400		Volume: 358.5		Cost: 180.32 (135.2)
                                ^^^^^
Confusing terminology time: In the QSD System, I consistently used
Displacement Tons as my unit of volume.  I hate converting from cubic meters
(or "kiloliters" for those of you brought up on MT) to displacement tons and
back again.  For the QSD System, the larger units made more sense, so I used
them exclusively.  UNfortunately, the USD is supposed to give the ship\'s
volume in _both_ systems.  "Tons" in the USD refers to volume in displacement
tons (just like in the QSD System), but "Volume" in the USD refers to volume
in cubic meters (an alien concept to the QSD system).

SO, for QSD System users, the USD Volume is USD Tons times fourteen.
In your case, this is 5600.

> 00 Fire Control Rating		03 G Rating / Heplar
  ^^
I can tell that one of the captain\'s first targets will be to score a set of
military-specification laser batteries.  The master fire directors included
with those will increase the ship\'s fire-control rating, giving it a +3 to
hit, and enabling the ship to engage 3 targets at once (both of which are
important to a pirate).

> 03 Battery - 2-0-0-0		.697350069 Power Plant Rating
                                ^^^^^^^^^^
Power plant rating is 2 times MW divided by displacement; rounded to the
nearest whole number.  In the case of your corsair, this works out to 3.

> 1)  There is no place on the USD chart to enter data on the Avionics (in 
> my case, TL 11 Military) or communications (again, in my case, Improved 
> TL-11).  Is this to be provided in the paragraph description, then?

Yes.

Neither one makes a difference in the combat of the ship, so neither one
appears in the USD display.  The avionics type can be inferred from the
Control section of the USD: "fib" indicates military avionics, and the TL 
should be the TL of the ship.  If the avionics differ for some reason
from the normal assumption (and the corsair\'s don\'t), then it should be
noted in the description.

The communications don\'t appear in the USD at all; you should note them in
the description somewhere.

> 2)  The tables in the QSDS system should follow a standard format.  

You\'re right, they should.  I didn\'t even _think_ of this \'till someone
noticed it.  For what it\'s worth, they\'re in whatever order they came out
of my spreadsheet in (which usually indicates the order that the columns
appeared in FF&S).

I doubt that there\'s anything I can do about the copy that was typeset this
week (except hope that this change occurred to Don as well as you), but I\'ll
update the copies I maintain ASAP.  That way it can be corrected on the Web
site, and maybe for the second printing of MMT.

   ...along with about 300,000 other thermal features. A fusion power
plant has a big neon sign attached to it in the form of neutrinos. No
natural phenomena other than fusion produces neutrinos. There are however
thousands of reasons for thermal variations. It would take a determined
team operating over an extended period to separate the chaff from the
wheat and come up with a list of "suspicious" targets. Even then, they\'ll
probably have their plate full with other therats to deal with, and if
their fleet is small enough it might even be seriously threatened by
attacks from DMSes before they can pin them down.

   Anyways, you can\'t really say that geothermal power would show up like
a neutrinos would. geothermal uses _existing_ sources of thermal energy,
it doesn\'t *produce* heat. You will still have to have a coolant loop, but
given enough forethought and planning this could easily be masked. You
couldn\'t *count* on your thermal variations being the source of the power.
Not only that, but multiple backups could and probably would be wired in.
For example use the planetary power grid (from cities, etc) to supply
power, or have huge banks of HPGs. Furthermore decoys could and probably
would be setup to confuse the enemy.

  Again, along with thousands of other natural features/decoys.

  Im am firmly convinced the only way to seriously deal with DMSes is with
ground teams. Either you have advanced scouts/spies ferreting this
information out, or you drop small commando teams to find and penetrate
these facilities.

Ahhhh....now I get it. :)

I realize it\'s too late for the version to appear in MMT, but \'twould 
have been nice to have a column giving that value (yeah, it\'s a simple 
calculation, which is even explained in the QSDS text, but still....).

Sounds reasonable.  Again, being unfamiliar with FF&S, and having limited 
descriptions in QSDS (no quibble there - that sort of detail should be in 
the combat section, which I didn\'t download) I didn\'t have much guidance 
on what sort of weapon system to put in.  So I just stuck to what the 
Supplement 4 description gave in Book 2 terms.  I\'d definitely add the 
military-specificaton laser batteries if I were designing the Corsair again.

Yup.  As I said in my email to you, I read that sentence in QSDS several 
times after I got the fractional answer, and always came up reading it as 
/divide by 2/.  Sheesh!  :)

Cool.  I\'ll download it again then.  Now that you\'ve corrected my errors

Actually, this rule came from the folks at Digest Group Publications. 
Specifically, Gary L. Thomas\' article "Characters With Class" (Travellers
Digest #7, page 47).  He specifically separated nobilty (social standing from
feudal rank) from non-nobility (social standing from socio-economic class). 
The \'spending is proportional to social standing\' rule is based on
contemporary American society (see Warren et al, _Social Class in America_).

I concur. For fast reference when planning a game, a CD-ROM would be great. 
Reference materials should only be necessary _during_ a game to handle the few 
situations you haven\'t planned in advance.

	The Corsair, and armed raiding ship, is mostly used by Pirate 
characters.  Notable features on the corsair are large cargo doors and 
variable identification features.  The large clamshell doors can open to 
reveal the entire cargo bay.  The ship has several centrally controlled 
identification features which can be used to disguise the ship: radio 
emissions alter frequency and content, and the ship\'s transponders can be 
altered to identify the vessel as having any of a variety of missions and 
identities.
	The Corsair is not normally available on the open market, as the 
ship is a non-commercial type.

years ago, and I\'d have to try hard to remember (not that I\'d want to). 
 That\'ll teach me to stay away from the military topics on the list.  Now, 
could somebody pass me that kinetic crowbar-thing?  I\'ve got to get this 
foot out my mouth.

Psionics:
Can anybody tell me where the durations for successful psionic tasks is 
located in TNE?  If a psionic character succeeds at clairvoyance, for 
example, how long does it last?  I looked for a long time and couldn\'t find 
any mention of it.

Hardcovers:
I like the idea of hardcovers for Traveller, especially since the IG website 
explains them to be very durable.  If IG is offering the first rulebook as a 
hardcover for $5 extra, do you think they could be pursuaded to offer the 
rest of the books in hardcover editions for $5 more each (in addition to the 
softcover ones they list now)?

Gee, I wonder what happened!!  I guess someone else was going to get their

his little temper tantrum.

Two comments:

        2.  Whoever it was that jumped on Chris had better examine Phil\'s

Perfectly true at TL 8, and for a couple of TLs after.  When grav 
vehicles appear, though, the whole armor question gets really weird.

Right now, the reason that tanks are vulnerable to infantry is that tanks 
*share the ground* with infantry.  To get from point A to point B, a tank 
has to traverse lots of nasty terrain in between -- and one of Doug\'s 
stalwart infantrymen, LAW in hand, could be lurking behind every tree.  
That\'s why infantry was enjoying something of a renaissance in military 
planning during the late 80s -- when one infantryman with a cheap LAW can 
take out a very expensive tank with several crewmen, the balance tends to 
shift around.  Note, by the way, that infantry become especially useful 
on defense -- the attacker is constrained to moving quickly, so has to do 
risky things like packing infantry into easy-to-shoot APCs to get them to 
the battle.  Note also that Desert Storm was a massive tank battle 
because (a) we were on the offensive, (b) we had total air superiority to 
punch through pockets of resistance, and (c) the Iraqi army had some 
serious training and equipment problems in most of its units.

Grav vehicles, though, act more like very fast, very high, very 
well-armored attack helicopters.  In the current battlefield, \'copters 
have one primary misstion -- tank killing -- and one primary enemy -- 
grunts with Stingers.  When everybody is using grav, though, there are no 
(ground) tanks to shoot at, so the action moves higher and faster, with 
the grav tanks "dogfighting" more like aircraft, perhaps using terrain 
now and then to hide for a moment or two.  It\'s not a scenario where 
infantry is going to get much of a chance to shoot at tanks...until and 
unless the tanks come after *them*.

So, I see a three-phase battle taking place in a planetary invasion, 
partly simultaneous, and with blurry boundaries:

(a) The space phase: Defending ships, SDBs, and DMSs against attacking
    ships.
(b) The air phase: Grav vehicles duking it out until one side runs out.
(c) The ground phase: Grunts face-down behind trees...er, taking and
    holding installations, hunting DMSs, doing FO work, and all those
    cool infantry things Doug has covered so well.

Operation Market-Garden-Hedgehog, anyone? :)

I am totally, extremely and profusely sorry.
My comment was a knee-jerk reaction that happens whenever I see someone
make a disparaging remark about private gun ownership.
Whether or not your comment falls into this category, it was wrong of me
to have the statement "silly Canadian" in a comment in this area, as I
have only the highest regard for Canadians in general, and all things
Canadian, except possibly in the area concerning private gun ownership.

This is true, but the marines require re-certification yearly, and the
entire philosophy of the corps reflects the "everyone is a infantryman"
concept.

That sounds great to me. Then I don\'t have to spend time taking the 
Imperium out of the rules, and I can read about or use as much of it as
I like.

   Yep, for the same reason that nukes are verboten and are only used by
madmen. Slug and energy weapons are precision instruments, they attack one
target at a time. KKW are weapons of mass destructon, when they are used
indiscriminately.

Hurray!  I hope IG takes a look at this post.  I too would really like the
T4 books to also be available in hardcover, as my softcover versions of

This sounds very familiar.  Just about all my design work is done on 
a PC.  I then print the stuff for use during a game session.  
Although I now use Jim V\'s subsector program to display subsector 
maps as well.  Kind of convenient that way.

I gets the feeling that with the recent breakthroughs in biochem and 
genetics that a large number of psychological problems could be 
related to chemical imbalances and/or genetic factors.  I suspect 
that by the 57th century, psychiatry, at least as we know it today, 
is going to regarded as a stone axe approach to the problem...

At this time, about all an MD is going to be able to do is realize 
there\'s a problem.  Realize though, that psychiatrists (not 
psychologists) can prescribe medications, and do many (not all) the 
functions that we normally associate with an MD.  You could also 
address the problem by making a psychologist or psychiatrist a 
specialty within the doctor profession...

OK, a bit of an exaggeration.  My point is that the characters aren\'t

in my games...

But, you might be right.  Maybe I\'ve been running games with the

===================
Issues:
1.  The Avionics and Communications thing mentioned earlier.
2.  The inconsistent ordering of columns in the tables.
3.  The Crew issue.  Using the "standard" QSDS caclulcations, I had a crew 
of 12 before I began rounding down and assigning two jobs to other people. 
(5 Engineers, 2 Maneuver, 2 Electronics, 1 Medic, 1 Steward, 2 Command).  
The guidelines for combining crew positions and reducing crew size for 
smaller vessels is too sketchy.
4.  Miscellaneous Equipment.  The Shops and Labs section needs more info: 
are Engineering Shops, Vehicle Shops and Sickbays mandatory when you have 
enough engineers, small craft or medics?  How does the mass/volume of small 
craft effect a ship when in External grapples?  Does this add to the volume 
of the ship when calculating Jump and Maneuver Drive volume?
5.  The Universal Ship Description.  This needs to be clarified.  It could 
use an example.
The Controls section probably is where the Avionics/Commo info would be, but 
that is unclear.
6.  The Jump-2 drive in the Far Trader only added 200,000 Cr to the cost and 
no extra crew.  This seemed a bit odd to me (though not all that bad).

Overall, it took me about 45 minutes to do a design on pen and paper.  I 
then spent about 15 minutes creating a simple spreadsheet, and now it takes 
about 10 minutes per ship.  I have about 5 other designs, which I\'ll post 
this evening or tomorrow.

Some MD who plays might write a JTAS article on how to role-play docters

	Yes and no.  In Striker II, anything that leaves NOE immediately 
becomes a target for everything on the battlefield, including other 
tanks.  Given the remarkable ballistic computers available to grav tanks, 
they can hit one another at several kms, almost no matter how fast their 
target is moving.  In my limited experience, I found that the only way to 
stay alive was keep my tanks moving behind the terrain, so that I could 
control my exposure to hostile fire.  This kept grav tanks operating an 
awful lot like regular tanks.
	Admittedly, Striker II is really about pitched battles.  In a war
of maneuver that covers the planet\'s surface, maybe moving at truly high
speeds and above the terrain offers some advantages.  But I\'m still not
convinced.  First of all, grav tanks are not all that fast.  The Trepida
has a top speed of 713kph and its weapons can only attack another tank out
to about 5kms.  If I were in the kind of "air superiority" battle you
describe, I\'d want something other than a flying tank.  I\'d want something
more like aircraft.  A "gravspeeder" that can go hypersonic speeds and
carries missiles capable of engaging well armored targets at 100kms is
certainly possible with Trav tech and would be much better equipped to 
handle the sort of battle you describe.  Secondly, I\'m not sure how 
pivotal the air battle will be since the orbital battle has already been 
won.  All those fire support craft in orbit should have a pretty good 
crack at shooting down anything flying.  Even the threat of those big 
guns over a flyers head will make him change the way he operates quite a bit.
	I never owned COAAC, so maybe I\'m missing something, but I\'d 
expect that a planetary invasion would be characterized by a battle to 
seize the orbital high ground, followed by the landing of ground troops 
who would be in a very big hurry to get out of the open and "get their 
face in the dirt" where all that hi-tech fire control equipment out there 
in the Trav universe can\'t pick them off.

	I only disagree with you about the nature of phase b.

As a reality check here, an F-16 has an optimal combat speed for
dogfighting of about 450 knots (~820kph). This doesn\'t change your
point, but it does show what a flying tank is like... an F-16 :-)

Taking the functionality of MGs for granted, (as well as the lack of
decent directional neutrino detectors good enough to get a FC Lock) I\'d
add the following.

Mesons will decay along the beam path.  Ships in orbit will see a long
thin gamma source coming up from the surface.  In other words, they\'ll
see the beam.  If they see it fire a few times, they\'ll triangulate the
position.

They still have to survive to get close enough to shoot, though.

Not me, I was a tanker.  Besides, the Marine Corps is quite a bit smaller 
than the Army, and as part of the Navy department, they draw their 
support personnel primarily from the Navy.

   these problems. Simply saying "this is unacceptable" and trying to change
   things so that an unpalatable idea is no longer possible is cheating,

   and how it would be dealt with.

TRAFFIC COPS

    This is an excellent point, and one that needs to be explored. I\'ve
    already mentioned this earlier, but this is important enough to bear
    repeating, and I have some further comments anyways.

    What I have in mind is a massive traffic control system similar to
    the one you\'d see at most airports. The high port would have traffic
    control sensors (the same ones that would be used for warfare and
    early warning) that keep track of insystem traffic, these would
    likely be augmented by picket sensors and stations in the outer
    system. Second, we have patrol craft. A large number of these are
    probably SDB\'s, whos primary function is system defence but would be
    called in for intercepts as a routine job, with some dedicated patrol
    craft doing customs and enforcement work.

    The first job of this network is to make sure that incoming spacecraft
    stay within the traffic lanes assigned to them. Spacecraft ignoring the
    proper procedures will be boarded, probably by the dedicated patrol
    craft but if the bogey declares itself hostile by evading it\'s likely
    the SDB\'s would be called in to aid in the intercept. Under NO
    circumstances will a spacecraft be allowed to plot a course that
    intersects with the atmosphere of any inhabited planet in the system.
    Such actions will be dealt with severely, any PC\'s trying to do this
    will likely be arrested and their ship confiscated (assuming they
    aren\'t simply blown away by the SDBs) if they don\'t escape the long
    arm of the law. The only way any spacecraft could enter the atmosphere
    is with a "harbour pilot" on board, an offcial from the high port that
    will pilot for the spacecraft. The intent is to insure that no
    uncontrolled traffic enters the atmosphere as a hazard to the
    population of the planet.

    The second job of this force is to patrol areas (such as the ateroid
    belt) that are easy sources of Dinosaur Killers and prevent unauthorized
    personnel (spacecraft) from entering the asteroid belt and simply
    grabbing one and pushing it to the planet. Asteroid prospectors would
    require licenses, and special permits would be required to actually
    *move* an asteroid.

    Note that this could lead to some interesting adventure hooks, and now
    you have some reasons for all the patrol craft your players meet and a
    rationale for their behaviour. Safety inspections suddenly take on a whole
    new light and the reasons for port fees are a lot clearer.

    Somebody should expand this into a "port authority" type supplement to
    the game...

THE PHYSICS OF DINOSAUR KILLERS

    Lets stop for a moment and look at the events involved in an (opposed)
    attack on a planet with DKs. Let\'s further assume all ships have
    THRUSTERS. (which is the concern of many arguments)

    Let\'s say that the asteroid belt (closest approach) is 4AU away from
    the orbit of the planet, that\'s about 372 million miles (598 milion Km
    for the metrically challenged) Let\'s also assume that the Terrorist
    chooses a 10,000mt asteroid (small as asteroids go) and the Terrorist
    flies a 200 ton Free Trader with a 1G drive. Using TNE rules, the Free
    trader has a loaded mass of 1900mt, so the acceleration of the Free
    Trader would be 1900/(10,000+1900) = 0.16G. Using S = AT^2/2, the max
    V of the rock would be:

    sqrt(2*598,000,000,000m/1.6m-sec) = ~864,870sec (10 days, 15 minutes)
    864,870 * 1.6 = 1383792 m/sec (0.4% c)

    First off the "Traffic Cops" have LOTS of time to react - 10 days to be
    exact. Second, it\'s LOTS harder to aim a rock at a planet than deflect it.

    Let\'s assume that after a couple of days a Patrol Cruiser (4G, 4000mt)
    intercepts, and "convinces" the Terrorist to surrender. After boarding,
    arresting/imprisoning the crew, and sending a prize crew back to base
    with the Trader, the Cruiser then proceeds to deflect the asteroid.

    After two days, the asteroid is moving:
    172800 sec * 1.6 m/sec = 276480 m/sec.
    ...and has travelled:
    1.6 * 172800^2 / 2 =  23,887,872,000m = ~23,888,000 km

    How long it would take the Cruiser to *stop* the asteroid:
    276480 m-sec/(4G * 4000mt / 14,000) = 276480/(1.14G) = 276480/11.4 =
    24252 sec (6 3/4 hrs)

    How long would it take to *deflect* the asteroid:
    Distance to planet: 598,000,000 - 23,888,000 km = 574,112,000 km
    Diameter of Earth-sized planet: 12,800km
    arc = arcsin(diameter/distance) = .008 deg.
    Time \'til impact:
    574,112,000,000m / 276480 m-sec = ~2076355 sec (24 days)

    (The arc is the diameter of the planet in degrees of arc)
    In simple terms: all the Patrol craft has to do is push the
    asteroid *sideways* far enough to miss the planet. ie, change
    course by .008 degrees. This means a sideways vector of 6 m/sec
    is all that is necessary to miss the planet (over 24 days).

    This is as simple as a few seconds on the thrusters - *much*
    easier than *stopping* the asteroid. (The longer you wait, however,
    the harder it gets)

    Note that it is much, much, MUCH more difficult to hit a planet with
    a DK than it is to stop it. Even withOUT thrusters, the Cruiser
    could easily deflect the asteroid, while it\'s virtually mandatory
    for the Free Trader to have Thrusters if the Trader wants to have
    _any_ chance of succeeding!

    Thrusters aren\'t the magical weapon many people have been claiming,
    plainly DK\'s are easily dealt with by a properly prepared system.

    UNopposed assaults are another story for another day, though! <g>

Spoken like a true grunt!  Personaly, I prefer to be behind the cadilacs
(controls) of a 105 or 120mm and lots of armor.  But, that\'s the way we
tankers are ya know.  We don\'t like hinds either, but the RPGs aren\'t much
more than track busters (most of the time).

Somewhat correct.  Without grunts, we tankers can\'t hold ground very well.
A tank in the defense is little more than a mobile pill box.  (something
tankers don\'t like to do very much).  In such a posture, an M-1 (my MOS) has
2 to 3 machineguns that can be brought to bear on the attackers (One Cal
.50, one coax 7.62, and one pintel mount 7.62).  Modern tanks were meant to
be used on the offense.  I know from first hand experience that the M-72A2
is worthless against the M-1 from almost any angle (except tracks), and the
AT-4 isn\'t much better.  BUT, if you kill the tracks you kill the tank.  

In the offense, however, the story is quite different.  The M-1 outruns
darned near anything on the battlefield.  In Saudi, we had trouble because
we kept outrunning the artillery.  The Bradleys were typically left so far
behind it wasn\'t even funny.  When you move like this, infantry support
isn\'t much help.  Consequently, we train tank crews not to depend on the
infantry for just these reasons.  

I have to admit though, when we did defend it was VERY comforting to see the
grunts around doing what grunts do so verrry well.  

BTW, I would recomend placing your dragon or TOW shot in the turret ring . .
.   they are very hard to armor without having non mobile turrets.

This is not as true as it used to be.  True enough that tanks use ALOT of
fuel (the M-1 uses 9.3 gallons of fuel just to start the engine) but the
range is much greater than it used to be.  Typical SOP in my unit was to
charge with the tanks, set up a temporary "logger", wait for the infantry to
set up, and then move back to resupply if possible.  Of course, we were a
little unconventional.  AND we were primarily fighting against armor units.
But in the strategic sense, you are correct.  Tanks can not operate for long
without some infantry support.  I imagine that when dealing with heavy mech
the same is somewhat true from the infantry side as well.

I guess it all boils down to the proper use of equipment.

I\'m terribly sorry to have to re-re-post this.  I created a ship design 
spreadsheet, and found that when I made the change to military lasers I 
had not performed the calculations correctly.  So, the cargo and cost 
values have changed.  Again, I\'m very sorry for posting this three times.

(My excuse: I\'m on the last couple of days of my Honeymoon; designing 
ships and doing calculations probably isn\'t a very good idea, considering 
the ... er...distractions I\'m facing. :)

Here is the corrected QSDS Corsair.  I added the standard military laser 
batteries, but this bumped the cost up quite a bit, of course.  I also 
added a short description, mostly cribbed from Supplement 4.  (Although I 
did change the mention of retractable fins, modules that "appear and 
disappear," etc. as I wasn\'t sure how well that would mesh with a 
detailed design system like FF&S.) 

Under "Cost" I have given the full price, with the discounted price (for 
using off-the-shelf components) in perenthesis.

	The Corsair, and armed raiding ship, is mostly used by Pirate 
characters.  Notable features on the corsair are large cargo doors and 
variable identification features.  The large clamshell doors can open to 
reveal the entire cargo bay.  The ship has several centrally controlled 
identification features which can be used to disguise the ship: radio 
emissions alter frequency and content, and the ship\'s transponders can be 
altered to identify the vessel as having any of a variety of missions and 
identities.
	The Corsair is not normally available on the open market, as the 
ship is a non-commercial type.  
	The crew, as with any craft, may be smaller in actual use.  The 
Captain may choose to have some individuals performing more than one 
function.  For instance, the Command positions may be filled by a senior 
Engineer, a senior Electronics specialist, with the Captain also being 
the Pilot or Astrogator.  The actual number of Engineers and Electronics 
specialists (including those also filling a Command position) may not be 
decreased without increasing the likelihood of equipment failure.

I\'ve been thinking about this since Leonard brought this up, and I\'m
sorry - I just don\'t buy it. THRUSTERS DON\'T VIOLATE CONSERVATION OF
MOMENTUM.

Let\'s think about this for a moment.

ENFORCING THE LAWS

>Another problem is that you have to measure your velocity (and thus
>momentum and KE) *relative* to some outside object. And the figures
>relative to an object with a different vector will be different.

Yes. So what makes you think that this measurement is any more valid
for thrusters than for any reaction drive? Relativity rules are *always*
applicable, you don\'t pick and choose. Therefor, if some momentum
calculation isn\'t valid for reaction drives, then it isn\'t valid for
reactionLESS drives.

>So any "reactionless" drive is going to have to be figuring the energy
>consumption relative to *some* body. And that means that for all

A dubious assumption at best. Inertial frame of reference can change at
any time (and does - every time you jump). Any attempt to force
reactionless drives to conform to an impossible standard that isn\'t
required of any of the reaction drives is ludicrous and makes no sense.

>The reason a reaction drive is so much more efficient is that it is
>pushing on it\'s *exhaust*, and therefore you measure the KE change
>relative to *that*.

So what happens when that reaction drive spacecraft hits a planet
and liberates all it\'s "stored" KE? Where\'d all the "free" KE come
from? (Remember, you\'ve been measuring relative to the drive exhaust,
not the planet!) You are going to see some kind of paradox everytime
you try and enforce this dubious conservation rule. SO DON\'T TRY.

WHERE\'S MY TEXTBOOK ON REACTIONLESS DRIVES?

Face it, according to current laws of physics, reactionless drives are
impossible. So therefor, if we do happen to discover a way to make a
reactionless drive we\'ll probably have to invent a new branch of physics
to describe it\'s behaviour. Complaining about how reactionless drives
"couldn\'t possibly work" and "violate conservation" is useless because it\'s
already been stipulated THEY EXIST AND WORK! So what do we do? We invent a
series of internally consistent rules that describe the drives operation
and go from there.

The first logical rule is to state that, except for exhaust and fuel use,
thrusters work exactly like reaction drives. The next is that they cost a
little more to buy. The third is that they are costly to power up.

Sound a lot like existing thrusters? You bet.

A key way to understanding this is to think of reactionLESS drives as
truely reactionless - they don\'t push on ANYTHING except themselves. Maybe
they create "virtual particles" as reaction mass, maybe they hook into a
subspace phenomenon much like a sail does. No matter what is decided, as
long as it\'s consistent you can\'t argue with it because you are talking
about FICTION - and the primary idea is to stipulate one impossible thing
every adventure and have fun!

This assumes an unopposed defence, which is only one of the scenarios being
discussed. In an opposed defence, the home player needs to punch a way through
the attackers to the rock in the first place, then keep them off his back while
he works at redirecting it, and will probably have already lost a significant
part of his out-system sensor-net and therefore reaction time. In the pure
terrorist attack case, the most difficult attack to defend against might be a
rock (or snowball) accelerated from the Oort or even beyond. The envelope over
which the rock may be detected and intercepted will be wider, but the average
speed of the rock will be much higher, making the task of intercepting and
matching vectors to redirect the rock all the more difficult. Course corrections
for targetting become more difficult the higher your speed (you need bigger
inputs to counter the reduced flight time), but conversely your initial
targetting solution becomes more accurate as there is less time for the chaotic
effects of an n-body problem to make your accuracy wander.

For a really nasty attack, jump your own rock into deep space and start
accelerating it from a light-year out. With a big enough engine you\'ll be
travelling at a high enough a fraction of C by the time you enter the opposing
planet\'s space defense environment that their reaction times will be very
seriously reduced.

And of course, in the Black War case, many of the planets hit didn\'t have the
resources left to counter conventional raids, never mind C-fractional strikes.

In practise yes, but my reading of _Traveller_ meson beams has always been that
they don\'t have a spread of velocities and decay points, they all decay at the
same point in space. Unrealistic, perhaps, but it does stop you backtracking
them (and if they were decaying along their length, you could track the
atmospheric effects with EM sensors from infra-red up).

Do remember that some of us get the same urge every time someone makes one in

cultural mores, let\'s keep non-Traveller political reactions off it, please?

It gets worse...my bride is an RPG and videogame nut, so there has been 
more time spend on these things by both of us during our honeymoon than 
would probably be considered healthy by any rational person.  Than God I 
didn\'t marry anyone rational. :-)

Since Carole, my new wife, is busy with the new videogame I bought her as 
a bridal present, I decided to try my hand at another ship design before 
getting back to more important matters [G].  I tried to be very careful, 
and I double-checked my work, so I hope this one won\'t require re-posting.

First, I\'ll give the stats on the ship, then a ship description, and 
finally a little discussion of the QSDS system and some other design notes.

			Gunner-2, Commander-1, Medic-1, Steward-1

Crew Detail (Minimum) : Engineering-2, Electronics-1, Gunner-2,
			Pilot/Astrogator/Commander-1, Medic-1, Steward-1

(Note: The Medic and Steward may be foregone if no passengers are carried.)

==========================

The Secure Trader is designed for use in transporting goods and 
individuals to and from hostile areas, as well as transporting goods and 
individuals that have a high probability of attracting hostile 
attention.  Since a much higher price can be commanded for such 
transportation, this Trader is capable of making a profit for its owner 
in spite of the higher price in comparison with the more commonly used 
Far Trader.

The main causes of the high price of this ship are the weaponry and the 
hull, both of which exceed the standards for trading vessels.  However, 
they also allow the Secure Trader to survive in situations that would 
destroy the standard Far Trader.

While the small staterooms have been designed with the crew\'s use in mind 
(excepting the Captain), Travellers experienced with this sort of ship 
have found it sometimes necessary to have the crew double-up in large 
staterooms because a passenger\'s social sensibilities require that his or 
her retenue use smaller accomodations than are used by his- or herself.  
With eight large staterooms and nine small staterooms available, it is 
possible to come up with many variants of crew and passenger arrangements 
able to please even the most discriminating passenger.  In addition, if 
no high passengers are available at a given port, the Captain can always 
sell middle passage and allow the crew to use the high passage staterooms 
(doubling up or not, as the situation warrants).

Not every Traveller will desire a Secure Trader, but for those who have a 
true sense of adventure, it can bring rewards rarely seen by the timid 
captains of standard trading vessels.

============================
Design Notes:

This is the type of ship my former players (back in CA) would have loved 
to use.  I figure there must be others out there who would like such a 
ship, so I designed it.  Hopefully, you\'ll find it useful.

QSDS Notes:

I found a couple of typos in the QSDS.  The Standard Military Laser 
Batteries chart has a colum for Price, which should be labeld Cost to 
keep it the same as the other charts.  The same goes for the Standard 
Civilian Laser Batteris chart.  
The Standard Sensor Systems chart has a typo under the Improved TL 12 
sensor system\'s USD.  The other entries in the column go Ax Px Jx, but 
this entry is ordered Ax Jx Px.  Given the values involved, I assumed the 
J and P had been transposed, but the values had not.  But, I really can\'t 
be sure.


Anyway, I hope a use for my design is found.  If someone comes up with an 
improvement, please let me know.

        Negative perspiration, dude...  I just want to point out that this
whole idea that private gun ownership in Canada is impossible or less
well-protected a liberty than in the US is false.  Like you, I have the
(constitutionally-protected, albeit in a different way) right to own
firearms.  In fact, for a while there, many assault-type weapons illegal in
the US were legally available up here.  Any government attempt to completely
ban private gun ownership, or to punitively regulate it, would certainly in
the first case and most probably in the second case get shot down by the
courts on Charter of Rights and Freedoms grounds.

        Thing is is that we just don\'t have the same attitudes towards guns
as you guys do.  I support the right of my fellow Canadians to own firearms
(not that I\'d ever want one myself) on general liberatrian grounds, and
support further regulation of this right to put gun ownership on the same
level of control (for public safety reasons) as car ownership.

(or game system) they come from. As a matter of fact, Traveller is built to
use those pictures. Illos of people, guns, vehicles, aliens, can all be
incorporated into the game because Traveller covers so many options.

But I also want to work toward a particular flavor for Traveller, and one way
to do that is for the artists to create art specifically for Traveller.They
do that by incorporating the symbols of Traveller into the art... Rebellion
Sourcebook did it quite well, with the illustrations incorporating the
symbols of the factions of the rebellion as an integral part of the scene.

So I am interested in suggestions for

"Nationalities" such as The Sylean Federation, The Third Imperium, etc. but
also the names of smaller governments like the Interstellar Confederacy.

Government Offices like the Ministry of Trade and Commerce, the Office of
Calendar Compliance, the Third Undersecretary for Interstellar Affairs.

Educational and Scientific Operations like the University of Sylea, the
University of Regina, the Sylean Medical Association, the Interstellar
Archeology Congress.

Corporate entities like Naasirka, Zhunastu, etc.

And associated with them, the standard symbol that they use (on letterhead,
on ball caps, on vacc suit chests).

Any suggestions? Any milieu. Any organization.

Remember, symbols are of necessity simplified (the artist will render it
often as just a suggestion). I use a Circle in a Square for University of
Sylea because it implies vaguely a mathematical persuasion. Often a symbol is
just described by a few words (the Sylean Lattice, the Vilani Eclipse); just
enough to get a feel.

They can\'t all decay at the same point, it\'s just a probability (or,
rather they won\'t, they could but it\'s highly unlikely :-).

I never recall reading that they all decay at the exact same point in
space, though.  Close enough to put most/a lot of them inside the
target, but I don\'t remember the canon explicitly saying that mesons
don\'t act at all the way we\'d expect them to.

        Ok... seems we do agree.  The smart crowbars and phone poles we\'re
talking about here are by definition precision instruments (the only diff
between these and conventional munitions is that they use KE instead of HE
for the kill), whereas its the larger rocks used to bust cities, precipitate
greenhouse effects or nuclear winters, or completely smash the planet that
are used only by the nutbars.  Although if the example of the late 20th-C on
Earth is any example, I\'d imagine that most governments are secretly
preparing to go completely bonkers at the drop of a hat :).

        So basically, Christopher was saying that weapons of mass
destruction, whatever their nature, would be verboten.  I\'m cool with that...

 I think it would make sense for it to be a impossible difficulty task to
be able to get a \'difficult\' roll to lock on(I.E. success means \'Hey,

 Or(which I kinda like) you could just make high tech level planets nearly

 Haha, true true. For him it seems to be working out as he can combine
that successful marriage with role playing.
 best of both worlds, I guess..

If possible, I\'d like him to export the spreadsheets in SYLK (symbolic
link format). I *know* that Quattro can import that, and that Excel can
too. I\'m just not sure if Excel can *export* it. If it can, it\'d be a

Exactly!

It\'s also been stipulated (by virtue of history and Traveller "feel")
that non-military spacecraft can operate relatively freely, even in a
populated star system. Therefore, they do not pose a terrible threat
to society. I\'m perfectly content to leave it at that:

How do M-drives work? Just fine, thank you very much.

Others (particularly "gearheads") will be tempted to try to explain
their mechanics. The problem with this approach is that you cannot
design them without considering the effect on the Traveller universe.
I\'ve seen it happen--players decide to exploit the description of how
a particular piece of technology works and end up with a superweapon,
which can ruin the whole campaign.

My "zeta field" suggestion was one attempt to reconcile the Thruster
plates *I am familiar with* with the Traveller universe. There are
certainly other ways to do it.

For example, it has been stated that they will be gravitically-based.
Fine--they operate in a different "mode", where the energy-limiting
factor is not the conversion to gravitic potential energy but rather
to kinetic energy. They essentially transfer applied energy directly
and efficiently into thrust. Define a practical upper speed limit on
the capabilities of the technology and you\'re in business. Note that
these are *not* the same thrusters as described in CT, which violate
conservation of energy unless a "mass nullifier" device is used (the
energy requirements must be adjusted at least, meaning there is no
more month-long "free" maneuvering).

I\'m going to make a few statements about thruster plates. You don\'t
have to buy any of them, but these are necessary for consistency in
*my concept* of the Traveller universe:

o There must be a reason to use them instead of fusion rockets
o They must not produce planet-killers (e.g., >0.1c dropped rocks)
o They must not produce more energy than is applied to them (if they
  seem to, there is a logical explanation that prevents it from
  being used for some purpose other than maneuvering)

As long as there is room in the rules to let these be explained
by those that wish to do so, pretty much any description of the
M-drive is acceptible.

I\'ll say it again: I don\'t care how (or whether) you explain the
mechanics behind M-drives. Just don\'t make the mistake of boxing
yourself in a corner trying to justify a particular explanation.
Think it through, or leave it out. Otherwise you end up with
statements like "of course every planet is just covered with deep
meson guns" (which doesn\'t work anyway--planets without that
technology are not being bombarded either).

Actually I was suggesting the opposite the Vikings, who had built up a level
of tollerence to the disease, as much as you can to something that horrible,
carried the disease from Europe to North America.

Quite probably there is a certian amount of truth in this supposition.  The
Solomani were masters of genetic manipulation.  It is not unlikely that they
had altered themselves in such a was that their bodies were capable of
fighting off any disease thus making them potential carriers.

     The best man at my wedding (who is also a RPer) managed to get a few 
     laughs in his speech when he said how lucky I was to have a wife who 
     would indulge in my fantasy role playing sessions ;-).

Keep your messages public, Jo. You\'re not doing me any favors.

I was in a continued discussion with several folks about the difficulty 
we had with a former TMLer. I think it\'s pretty much worn itself out, as 
do you, apparently, but if you don\'t enjoy reading on a subject, skip 
it! That\'s what most of us do.

Okay so perhaps I\'m over doing the whole thing.  The point that I was trying
to make is who decides how big a rock is to big and how fast it to fast.
Dropping crowbars and telephone poles is fine with me.  Going out the the
asteroid field and accellerating a rock as a planet is inherently dangerous.
Who\'s to say it\'ll even survive re-entry in one piece and if it doesn\'t how
much countryside have you just vaporized because you chose that rock instead
of this rock?  Preformed kenetic weapons are fine, dropping an asteroid on a
planet is wrong.  
I\'ve seen the damage a fairly small bomb can do and I\'ve seen what a fairly
large bomb can do.

Too true.  I guess it all comes down to (at least in my case) the fact 
that I won\'t sacrifice a good relationship for a high-paying career.  
And, of course, one of the main ingredients of a good relationship is 
shared interests - including Traveller! :-)

I was quite fortunate.  I married somebody whose more of a sci-fi or 
fantasy reader than I am (which is impressive in itself), a 
role-player, and almost as interested in Traveller as myself.  We\'ve 
been together 10 years now...

Wildstar can explain it better than I can.  In case you hadn\'t heard, 
FF&S is THE complex design system for T4.  Originally, Dave Golden 
solicitied Don Perrin to create a simpler HG level system for ship 
design, based on some draft ideas he\'d posted on his web page a few 
months ago.  Dave created FF&S light, a scaled down off them rack 
system that could be used for quicker ship design that FF&S Light.  
There are a lot of people who like FF&S light, but some thought it 
still too complex.

Then Wildstar came to the rescue, and decided to create an even more 
scaled down design system QSDS, which is probably more equivalent to 
a Book 2 Starships difficulty level.  Apparently there are quite a 
few QSDS devotees, as the designs Joe is cranking out can attest.

Hmmmmmm....  This is a problem.  Potentially the DMS could be powered by
Geo-Thermal power with excess power stored in batteries and HPG\'s.  This
would make the site virtually undetectable from orbit.  Particularly if
properly masked.

QSDS is the "Quick Ship Design System."  It is basically a group of
plug-in sub-systems, and standard hulls to put them in that produces
ships quickly with no math save addition of the components.

It is very much like Book2 ship design except that since the sub-systems
and hulls were built using FFS, it is completely compatible with the
FFSLight system, as well as with (slightly fixed) FFS.

The idea is to have a very easy system, a slighly more detailed system,
and a nuts and bolts system that all produce compatible results.

Jeffrey,

QSDS is the Quick Ship Design System, which was created by Guy Garnett 
(AKA Wildstar@qrc.com) in response to a ...er...mild disagreement that 
occurred recently between those who want a system like Fire Fusion & 
Steel (very very detailed) for designing ships, those who want something 
like High Guard (somewhat detailed), and those who want something like 
Book 2 (very simple) to be used with T4/MMT.  It turns out that Imperium 
Games will re-release FF&S, better edited and with a new name, for T4 
at some point, but will be including something called FF&S Light 
(designed by David J. Golden) in their Starships supplement (this is the 
high-guard type system, fully compatible with FF&S), and Quick Ship 
Design System (the Book 2 style system) will be in the basic rules book for 
Marc Miller\'s Traveller.  

This way, thanks to David Golden and Guy Garnett\'s game design abilities 
and dedication to the game, as well as IG\'s open policy for customer 
suggestions, everyone should have a system that is right for them...and 
all systems are compatible with eachother.

QSDS is available online at http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar/  (there\'s more 
to the direct URL, but that will get you to Guy\'s home page, and you can 
get to QSDS from there).  FF&S Light is on David Golden\'s web page, but I 
don\'t recall the link right now. :(

Oh ya, you\'ve got to nail everything obvious from orbit, unless it a
balkanized world then you just flatten the target zone.  Sending men in
again\'s a fully functional defencive system is suicide.

You can actually get all three -- if your spouse or significant other is

What you talking about silly Canadian\'s for?  Canuckle Heads okay, but silly

Speaking as a proud Canuckle Head from Vancouver too.  

PS if you go to the interior here Gun Racks are also standard equipment from
the dealership.  So you want to buy a BMW\'s eh?  Is that with a three or
four rifle rack in the back window?  It\'s just harder to get a liscence for
the guns so most gun racks carry fishing equipment.  8)

Actually I don\'t think he\'s refering to something as small and as limiting
in it\'s damage scope as any of the things you\'ve mentioned here.  He\'s
talking about dropping a rock and by rock I\'m assuming he means something
the size of a small mountian on a planet.  

I think that this is where the greatest mis understanding in this whole
thread of coversation is occuring some people are saying rock and reffereing
to an optically guided kinetic-kill munition the size of a phone pole or
smaller.  Where as others are using the word rock to refer to a mountian
sized lump of stone grabbed out of the asteroid belt and dropped on a city.

Absolutly true.  Once you\'ve got Grav technology everything you though you
knew about conduting war goes out the door.  Suddenly the playing field has
a third dimension.  It would be like Thousands of "Super Apachies" that
didn\'t have to pay attention of the laws of gravity swarming across a planet.

Do not the Meson\'s just magically "appear" inside the ship with no trail to
follow back?  Thats how I understood they worked.  If this is untrue then
what the hell is the advantage of building meson guns in the first place.
It\'d be cheaper and quicker to plant thousands of silo\'s in the ground and
launch PDM\'s at anything in orbit.

If the meson\'s appear inside the ship they should, in theory, be completely
untracable back to their source.

The Black Curtian is something of an Event Horizon.  Anything that goes
beyond that line never comes back.  This area is also centered upon the main
strong hold of the Lucan faction during the rebellion, Lucan\'s scientists
created Virus.  No one really knows what\'s going on in there but you can bet
whatever it is it\'s pretty wierd.  THere are a number of clues in the
various supplements, no one in the Regency or the RC knows about the Black
Curtian.  One of the RC survey ships, Lady Elise I beleive correct me if I\'m
wrong, gets picked up on the outskirts of the Covenant of Suffern, a small
pocket empire which survives the collapse.  The ship has been infected with
a "Carrier Pigeon" virus strain which is attempting to take the ship to the
core.  Suffern studies the ship for a while before releasing it and
following it.  No one knows what happens next.

In Vampire Fleets there is word that "Puppettier Strain" virus\' are flowing
out of the Core and attempting to Re-infect already infected computers.
What this leads me to suspect is that the "Puppet\'s" are a new strain of
virus created in the core dedicated to replacing the old strain.  It is
possible that the Puppets are in control of a large number of worlds and
factories still producing high tech gear in the core, infecting it and
shipping it off into the wilds.  This is a bad thing and it is all just
specualtion.  No one really knows for sure.

The Third Imperium started as a fuedal state, and I always envisioned the
original sunburst being part (or all) of the crest on Cleon\'s coat of Arms.
I see the original Imperial symbol as the entire crest (or maybe just the
shield) and evolving in time into just the now-famous Imperial sumburst.

How about this, as a suggestion?  The original Imperial symbol:

        A shield.  The top 1/4 divided into three sections, white, red,
white.  The first section shows a red sun(the Imperial Sunburst), the second
a white moon, and the third a red star(six pointed).  The bottom 3/4 is gold
and has no image or symbol at all.  Over time this symbol evolved into just
the three sectioned bar, and eventually just the sunburst.  (The colors
could either evolve, or stay the same.)  (And to think, I used to know how
to write this the way a herald would).

Two of the corporations created for the RC era are on my web page

Transstar - This was Lewis\' creation.  I thought I had a copy of the blurb
he did about the companies symbol, but I can\'t find it.  Lewis, you got a
copy handy?

Dushgin & Delgado - This one was mine.  The symbol:
        On a stary backdrop, a pale moon (light from above and behind
viewer) with blue letters D&D in "3-D" extending from a point at the top of
the moon to the center of the moon.

No.  They are accelerated to a significant fraction of the speed of
light and travel towards the target like any other particle beam.

In extremely simplified terms:

The idea in traveller is that knowing the halflife of pions (something
like 1E-15 seconds----don\'t have a ref handy) you accelerate them so
that due to relativity effects they decay in the same time to
themselves, but to outside (non-relativistic) observers (the shooter and
the target) the decay takes long enough for them to reach the target.

In traveller (not real life) these mesons are extremely non-interactive,
so they pass right through armor or even planets, only decaying around
their half-lives.

Some will decay before the target, som past it regardless.

if you want to take over/control/economically benefit from a battle, the
cheap, kill \'em all attitude is a failure. You\'ll spend more re-building,
re-propagandizing survivors and your own people than the cost of a landing
and precision bombing, even tho the latter has a higher initial cost.

If you want to simply eliminate the opposition, DK\'s and nukes are the way
to go. But you still must convince at least those doing the attack that it
is the right thing to do, and then survive the inevitable political
backlash when word leaks out. (And, yes, no matter how black the op, word
WILL eventually leak out).

IMHO:

Drop troops are for securing an LZ for less mobile troops, despite R
Heinlein\'s Mobile Infantry. Traveller Drop troops are not RH\'s MI, despite
the obvious insiration therefrom. MI were in existance to fight the bugs.
Traveller has few bugs (Noted ones include the Chamax), but lotsa DT\'s.
DT\'s are a cross between paratroopers, spetznaz, and Ogre/GEV (by SJG)
infantry: light, fast, practically invulnerable to non-power-armored trops,
and victims of tanks in direct fights. they are as mobile as infantry, with
the ability to survive hostile environments, but a tank can kill them with
frightening efficiency (See MT, striker or striker II). they hit dirt
between 5 and 15 minutes from orbit drop, and saturate a small area, and
hold until reinforced by landing ships, some 10 to 30 minutes later. then
they reinforce the tanks. They often are grav-capable, so they can keep up
with  non-grav tanks well enough, and a combined landing force of DT\'s and
grav tanks is quite potent, as well as capable of a wide range of action.

their expense makes them the beach head takers, and the other (army) troops
follow them in.

First and foremost a marine, first and foremost a DROPTROOP!

So technically speaking you\'d have to be looking at the target when the
meson burst hit inorder to tell which direction the shot came from.  I
understood the accelerated partical stuff and I always figured there should
be a way to track them back.  When the particals appear they should "smear"
(good technical term) in one direction, thus if you are observing these
particals as they materialize you should be able to get an angle on the
shot.  Of course the idea of actually looking at the right spot at the right
time is so astronomically small as to be next to impossible.  Given the
damage a planetary meson gun can do you\'d loose a wack of large ships before
you figured out where it was.  And the first shot would likely go after the
command ship.  Or the largest ship available.

   This doesn\'t conflict with my traffic control system, nor does
   my TCS defy Traveller canon. Some sort of Port Authority and patrol
   network is implied throughout Traveller canon.

   I also implied (a change from my very first post on the subject) that
   *any* flight plan could be acceptable, as long as it doesn\'t intersect
   with the atmosphere and you don\'t try to move asteroids without a
   (nominal) license. I don\'t postulate draconian authorities, just a bit
   of paperwork (and another use for Admin :) for players that have
   LEGITIMATE reasons to move an asteroid.

>populated star system. Therefore, they do not pose a terrible threat

   Impossible. Anything that\'s capable of reaching escape welocity
   is a threat. That means *all* space craft violate your assumptions.
   Thrusters aren\'t a violation -- your assumptions are.

   No matter what you do to Thrusters to hamstring them they will always
   be able to cause SERIOUS damage to planets, and nothing you can do can
   change that. Ditto for HEPlaR.

   Heck a 1mt rock hitting at 50km/sec is going to hit like a NUKE no
   matter that it\'s being pushed by a HEPlaR thruster or a reactionless
   thruster.

   There already is one - no need for reaction mass.

   <sigh> No matter *what* you do this will ALWAYS be possible.

   Ignoring it won\'t make it go away. Ignoring it also goes against the
   grain of s/f in general.

   *IF* you mean that there must be a reasonable power consumption, ok
   I agree with you. If you mean "the thruster must not violate
   conservation of energy as KE compared to a planet" then I totally
   disagree. Making thrusters conform to this restriction while not
   making the same restriction on reaction drives is ludicrous and
   makes no sense.

   100% agree on thinking things through.

   There is one simple problem with that last, you assume that a
   vulnerable planet will *always* fight. Why can\'t they surrender?

   This is implied, as I mentioned in another post, in many places
   in Traveller canon.

   My tack on this is that MGs have a very "tight" targetting solution,
   but _do_ have some spillover. This could be used to triangulate a DMS,
   but only over an extended period of time. (It\'d be hard to get an *exact*
   bearing on a random-probability-smeared meson trail)

  Why? Even at fractional cee velocites it is going to take *days* to arrive,
  the defenders have plenty of time to fight the attackers, and deflect it at
  leisure once the battle is over. If the defenders lose, they are then at the
  mercy of the attackers.

  This is TRIVIAL to prove.

  Again, why? PEMS sensor nets (the only reasonable solution, no AEMS net is
  going to have the necessary range) are undetectable at any reasonable range,
  given the size of a solar system - they give off no emissions. Therefor,
  without advance info (probably classified) about the location of the
  "traffic" sensors, the attackers would have no idea where they are. (Certainly
  some educated guesses, but assuming a military attack they would have too little
  time to do an aggressive search)

   <sigh> It\'s trivial to prove that it\'s very easy to deflect such an attack,
   given the existence of thrusters (which is the main point of contention here)

   Thrusters make such an attack more dangerous, but also make it easier
   to deal with because the defenders can burn in at max thrust over a
   sustained period without having to worry about fuel consumption. Also,
   don\'t forget the attackers are hobbled by this B.M.F. asteroid, and given
   any reasonable civilian craft are going to have accelerations in the sub-G
   range. It\'s also likely that the terrorists will only have one or two craft
   to send on such an attack, and will be no problem for a couple (or even one)
   SDB\'s to dispatch.

   I\'m of the opinion that such an attack is much more likely to be made with
   a HEPlaR assumption than a Thruster assumption, because the attacker *knows*
   the defender can\'t possibly stop it with restricted fuel use.

   This is a pure military solution, unless what you *really* want is a Dinosaur
   Killer (destroy the ecology instead of the planet) you just aren\'t going to
   have a big enough jump field to carry a big enough asteroid fast enough with a
   civilian craft.

   As such, the tactic is valid and *must* stand.

   I refer you to _Trillion Credit Squadron_, page 38 "For simplicity, to
   avoid the necessity of worrying about armies, PLANETARY BOMBARDMENT[*],
   and other factors outside the scope of a purely naval campaign, the
   following abstract rule for surrender is provided"

   This is Traveller canon (written by MM), and implies that planetary
   bombardment, ie dropping rocks is a normal course of events in a military
   campaign. Throughout TCS, there are hints that a planet confronted by
   such a situation, without Naval support *will* surrender to avoid such
   a fate. This further implies this *has* happened before somewhere in the
   5000 year history of the human race. (And probably was treated with the
   horror it deserved...)

   Can you say "surrender"? Sure you can!

   I think the original intention of the inventor of DMSes (somebody
involved with the original Striker rules) had the intention of using the
meson gun as an untraceable source fo firepower, however Merrick is quite
right in that the laws of probablity allow some slew in the tragetting of
mesons.

  (A quick digression: MGs use lightspeed time-dilation to increase the
HALF-LIFE of the meson to a point where it will survive long enough
arrive on target. The term "half-life" is significant - this is a measure
of probability, and is not 100% accurate, therefor there will be some
deviation in the *expected* decay rate, and some mesons will decay outside
the target area. Since the meson gun fires along a path this translates
into an elongated diamond decay area that points back to the MG. I\'m of
the opinion this is too vague to use to ACCURATELY shoot at the MG, but
could be used to send down commandoes to the general area to locate
and deal with it.)

   I\'m sorry, that\'s not enough. No matter what you do, PBs should
*logically* be possible. Given the fact that spacecraft can reach escape
velocity - and there\'s no way to get around that, then PB\'s *are*
possible.

   If you were my ref, and you insisted on making things you don\'t like
illegal in such an *arbitrary* fashion, you\'d be short one more player.

   I treat my players with respect, and give their desires at least as
much concern as I give my own.

   RPGs are about _fun_, and if the players want to play scenarios where
the threat of PB\'s is central to the plot, then so be it. I don\'t let my
players control the game but I do let them have fun.

   Any referee that forgets this is going to be playing solo. (and I\'ve
met more than one)

Because I\'m from Texas he was trying to make a joke based on the fallacy
that more guns equals more violence.  Notice the \'8-)\' in his post.

I\'ve always wanted to know why Traveller Law Level was based on the type 
of weapons the government let you carry.  Perhaps like tech level,
law level shouldn\'t be considered so \'cut and dry\'.  I can easily
imagine a world with a law level of 4 that prohibits all weapons.
Also I can see a world with a law level of 9 that requires all citizens
to openly carry laser weapons.

I can accept your opinon, but I don\'t aggree with it.  Traveller was
the rule system, not the Imperium.  Other Sci-Fi games used complex,
hard to use rules and then tried to gloss over it with detailed 
and creative backgrounds.  Much as I ingore the Imperium I admit 
it is a well thought out background.  But Traveller gained market 
share not because it was the first, but because it had the best
proffessional appearance and the best set of rules.

This is very generic.  \'Official\' background didn\'t produce the idea

The \'reason\' to play MMT should be because the rules will make it easy for 
the players to ask \'what if..\', not because they define what color Stephens
throne is today.  No one played D&D because GreyHawk was so detailed.  
They played it because they had interesting ideas that they wanted to

Why not produce two books then?  One with rules, the other with background.
That way I won\'t have to carry around 1,000 pages of Imperium history I don\'t
want or need.

I\'m not so certain I aggree.  Sales of RPGs has been falling over the last
number of years.  Could it be because of the settings?  (Just how many dark
games do we need anyway?)

I won\'t.  I\'ld rather see the space used for more detail on generating 
animal encounter charts.  I\'ld rather see more space used to detail
star system generation tables.  More space used to explain skills and combat.
Save background for where it belongs, published adventures and supplements.

Just as a point of interest.  Our constitution does not \'grant\' us
the right to keep and bear arms. It only protects that right (and others)
which we would have even in the absence of the constitution.

Like mad cow disease I\'ve tried to stay away from this "rocks from
space" thread.  But when posters start talking about the \'mindset\'
of the traveller society I can\'t help but jump in.

By mindset do you mean \'human\' mindset?  Don\'t forget there
are other minds out there.  Some minds might consider it the
greatest of social accomplishments to drop a rock on some
highly populated world.   I think there was a race (the Brinn??)
who went to great lengths to wipe out every single human on
any planet they find.

First question: do you have the same amount of memory (i.e. is everything

second question: what exactly is the error you\'re getting...I might be

This is way the hell off topic but I believe, and I will get flamed on this
one I\'m sure, the line grants you "the right to bear arms in an organized
militia." or something to that effect.  One of my friends was born in
Arkansas, and he says that\'s how the line goes.  Being a Canadain, I really
didn\'t care much but I filed it away with all the other reams of usless
information I\'ve got stored in my head.

There\'s a little gnome up there that runs around flashing inforation in
front of my eyes at the most inopportune times.  8)

Well, I didn\'t say it would be easy to detect it, just that it could be.
I don\'t see it as being all that hard, though.  When you consider that
DMSs are gonna be the very biggest MGs, using the most energy, it gets
even easier.

My understanding is that they are accelerated to such a
relativistic velocity that they have a chance to go a long way before
decaying...right?  The problem, of course, is that meson decay rate is
based on half-life. So by the time then get on target, have half of
them already decayed?  Even if not half *some* percentage would have
already decayed.

If you extend this idea then what you\'ve got a situation not quite
like the books seem to indicate.  Shouldn\'t a graph of energy
depositied (when mesons decay) look like a normal curve? Delaying
their decay via velocity should push the whole curve to the
right...but shouldn\'t it also spread it out lowering the peak?

Different idea.  Whatever is keeping the mesons from decaying *isn\'t*
their velocity but some force travelling along with the meson pulse. 
At some range this force disipates and the mesons all decay normally. 
This gives us the situation where virtually all the mesons decay at
once.

I\'m not a gearhead, but I play with people that won\'t take "They just
do" for an answer, so I\'m always looking for a plasible sounding
explaination for the way things work.

That\'s true.  I\'ve suggested several approaches to explaining MDrive
tech here myself, as have others, each of our ideas have effects on
the way the game plays.

Absolutely, and that\'s my point in talking about *ways* that MDrives
could work.  I\'m not interested in some canon
explanation telling me the one and only way, I\'d rather have several
choices.  That way folks can pick a method that fits *their* idea of
Traveller.

You\'ll have to expand on this idea some before I understand it...

Personally, I\'d like to add an upper limit on velocity (or
psuedo-velocity), because that fits *my concept* of the Traveller
universe.  <g> But that\'s just *my* concept, not everybody elses, I
*don\'t* want to impose any restrictions on the discussion.

The way people play Traveller ranges from close to reality to pure
space opera.  Expressing ideas here for either approach, or anything
in between are appropriate.  However, we might want to say how tight
or loose we are playiing with reality when we post our ideas. <g>

Which is why I bring up ideas up here, so I can have some help
shooting them full of holes. 

When I propose various alternative technologies, I\'m not proposing
canonical explainations.  What I\'m doing is trying to do is explore
some possible alternatives.

I have a somewhat tangential question:  From where do the DMS\'s get their
targeting solutions?  Are there meson sensors that allow them to target
from within the planet?  If they are that deep, in all likelyhood,
neutrino emissions will be clouded----which means they would probably
prefer to use surface based sensors for a more accurate solution----take
those out, one take out some of their accuracy.  Also, on the subject of
combating DMS\'s: they have to be able to get the crews, etc. IN somehow
(how many troops do you think will volunteer to get sealed into something
analogous to the Biosphere II just to operate a DMS? Not many)----which
means any hostiles also have a potential method in (I didn\'t say it would
be an easy one).

        That depends on whether you\'re a positive-law theorist or a
natural-law theorist.  Being a good positivist, I\'d argue that to talk of
rights outside the context of a legal system is like talking about breathing
in a vacuum, and therefore, the legal text that constitutes the U.S. of A.,
in defining your rights, also creates them... but I\'m getting off topic.


        Getting back on topic, I\'ve been wondering whether there are any
rules or background in Traveller regarding business associations.  I\'ve been
thinking about throwing together a blurb on (very) basic corporate and
partnership entities, and private international (interplanetary?) law,
modified to fit Traveller.  I think it might provide some interesting
background/plot motors for the game.  If anyone\'s interested, I can put a
few hours in on it this weekend...

Mission:
The Ajax Frigate is designed to "show the flag" and discourage piracy.  As a 
representative of Imperial might, it can patrol systems where sending a cruiser 
would be uneconomical and/or over-kill.  However, it should be more than capable
of seeing off a corsair or two with its particle accelerator and missile 
barbettes, whilst defending with sandcasters & laser turrets.  It is not 
designed to fight larger craft, so no meson screen is fitted.

You hope the mesons will be well behaved enough to all decay at the same
time. In fact they will probably decay with a gaussian distribution
tracing out a nice line back their source. This assumes that the standard
deviation for the distribution is large (enough time for them to seperate
a couple of hundred meters) or there are enough mesons in the package that
you can detect the ones that decay either 2 standard deviations early or
late. In either case you can pretty much figure out where the gun could 
be in a finite number of it\'s shots. This is an area where gunnery school 
could come in handy to keep other\'s from detecting your gun.

It\'s not a matter of boxing yourself in a corner. Einstein and Newton did 
that for you and any college level physics student with a calculator and a 
knowledge of special relativity: KE = 0.5 * m * v^2 / sqrt(1 - (v / c) ^2) 
45 tJ / kg to accelerate a rock from rest to 0.1c. This amount of energy 
is well within reach of any Traveller player with access to a starship. 
Wishing it wasn\'t won\'t help you.

And if they *aren\'t* fusion powered? 

Geothermal has been mentioned. And as I have pointed out in the past,
they don\'t have to have an unusual thermal signature. Picture a site on
the bottom of the Pacific ocean, near a rift zone. It can use the 4 C
water and the 800+ C rock a short ways down to generate *lots* of
power. It\'ll just look like another bunch of "black smokers". And with
a couple of miles of water on top, the thermal signature is just about
nil. 

As a side benefit, you can extract lots of minerals from the
superheated water.

Nope. You see, if they don\'t bomb us "back to the stone age", then we
*will* have a fair amount of industrial capacity left. And a lot of
military stuff as well.

We have a lot of space designs that haven\'t been built either because
no one would back them, or they just didn\'t seem to be what we wanted
right now. Given that sort of war, we\'d be building some of those
designs as fast as the dust settled. Up to and including Orion type
vehicles.

Of course, the only things protecting the natives is that the invaders
either want the use of the planet\'s industrial capabilities, or at
least they want it inhabitable for colonizing.

Otherwise, we are back to rock dropping. Picture the results of
dropping a small asteroid into the middle of Yellowstone.

Spaceships have an advantage over seagoing vessels. They don\'t sink. If
you knock out the drives, the ship just continues on its current
vector, as modified by gravity. If the ship is in orbit (or moving slow
enough) then it\'ll *stay* in orbit.

You have to knock out drives, power, *and* life support to get a true
"kill".

Worse yet, breaking a big rock into smaller ones at the more likely
ranges just spreads out the damage a bit.

Sure, but consider just *how* fast you have to be moving for a drive
capable of 6 g to have its thrust balanced by drag! And relativistic
mass increase doesn\'t matter if you are neutralizing the ship\'s mass.
Though I guess it\'d increase the drag.

Easy. The energy and momentum changes are shared. Energy and momentum
are conserved. But you get the "exponential" energy requirements.

Ok, fine. So we use E= f*d. Which means that you have use energy based
on how *far* you travel at a given acceleration. So, let\'s figure for a
100 tonne (mass) ship at 1 g.

100 tonnes is 1e5 kg. 1 g is 9.8 m/s^2. So we need 9.8e5 kg m/s^2 of
force. And it takes 9.8e5 joules per meter travelled. 

So:

time	distance	energy used
- ----	----	----
1 s	 4.9 m		 4.802e6 Mj
2 s	19.6 m		19.208e6 Mj
3 s	44.1 m		43.218e6 Mj
4 s	78.4 m		76.832e6 Mj

See the trend?

E=d*f
e=(0.5*a*t^2)*f
e=(0.5*9.8*t^2)*9.8e5
e=(4.9*t^2)*9.8e5
e=4.802e6*t^2

So, the energy required goes up as the *square* of the time. And
similar calcs will show that the velocity of the ship has an effect as
well. That\'s more of a linear relationsship, but it\'s still a case of
"the faster you go, the more energy it takes".

Still not practical for long term use.

I suggest that you take a long hard look at Afghanistan. The Russian
Hind helicopter fits the above description rather well. And while the
Afghans said "We do not fear the Russians, but we do fear their
helicopters", the Soviet pilots feared the people with stingers.

There\'s no reason to expect a grav vehicle to be safe from infantry.
After all, weapons continue to improve, and things like stingers will
get better. So will lasers, and other weapons.

The TL-12 equivalent of a mortar, or a LAW may very well be deadly to
any grav vehicle in line of sight. The laser equivalent of a .50 cal or
an anti-tank weapon like the Finnish and Soviet 17 and 20 mm anti-tank
rifles will *definitely* be a good reason for grav tanks to stay low.

I\'m also willing to bet that "home on CG/AG" will be a common option on
missiles. Just like "home on radar" and "home on jammer" are now.

A grav tank that turns off it\'s CG/AG to dodge a missile is in trouble.
Especially if the nice people on the ground fire several a few seconds
apart.

So far so good.

Nope. Ortillery (kinetic kill weapons and homing missiles) versus
defending grav units.

They may go down to help draw out the enemy grav units. Between heavy
weapons squads, integral artillery and ortillery support, grav vehicles
are going to be rather vulnerable. So it\'s still likely that troops
will go down *then* the grav cav.

And if the position is 50 km under the surface? Almost any attack
that\'ll reach that deep is likely to have *severe* effects on the
planet. 

And if the DMS is actually a "subterrene" cruising thru the magma,
your triangulation is going to be of little help.

Of course, I\'d imagine that *designing* such a "subterrene" would be an
interesting excercise.

And even more fun would be if the attacker manages to land an "attack
subterrene" of his own. *That* would be a battle.

Please consider the fact that the "100 diameter" limit is rather close
to the planet as distances in space go, and that fully predicting the
exit vector (direction *or* magntitude) is not practical. If it *was*
practical, that allows the terrorists to do all the accelerating

Now let\'s try this the way a *competent* terrorist would do it.

Jump into the system way the hell out in the Kuiper belt or even the
Oort cloud. Find a body the same size as the one you used. Set up to
move it.

Now, we\'ll be at least 100 AU out, more likely over 1000. 

So, we accelerate for a while. If we have 1000 AU to accelerate in,
things work out like this:

1.5e14 km at 1.6 m/sec = 1.37e7 seconds (159 days)
Max V is 2.19e7 m/s or about 7% of c. 

Assuming they cut loose at 50 AU, then the time to impact is: 3.42e5
seconds (or about 95 hours). At 4 g, it\'ll take 155 hours to match
velocity (which is necessary to even *begin* to change course). At 6g
it\'ll take 104 hours. So even if it\'s detectable at 50 AU, there isn\'t
*time* to intercept it. 

That brings up another detail. At 50 AU out, it takes almost 7 *hours*
for any signal from the rock (reflected light, radar pulses, whatever)
to get to the mainworld. By which time it\'s 3.65 AU closer. 

Also, since the Oort cloud is *not* confined to the plane of the
ecliptic, the attack can come from *any* angle.

Oh yeah, it\'ll take 26 days for the terrorists to brake to a stop
(after they\'ve jumped, if they have any brains). Where did they get the
fuel? Most bodies that far out are at least partial "icy" (frozen
water, methane, ammonia, etc). Getting fuel from that is easy.

Oh yeah, when the "rock" hits, the impact energy is only 2.40e21
Joules. Or 571 Gigatons.

Easy. If you measure the momentum and KE of the ship AND ITS EXHAUST,
then you will be conserving in *all* frames of reference. More on this

Nope. You still have the same KE and momentum after jump as you had
before. Or at least that\'s been the assumption.

There isn\'t any "free" KE involved. The ship started out "at rest" with
respect to *something* (or even just assume it was moving at constant
velocity with respect to the planet). It used fuel, gaining KE and
momentum relative to the planet, while at the same time, the exhaust
*lost* an equal amount of KE and momentum (remember, these are *vector*
quantities, so "negative" justy means "in the opposite direction")

Pick any inertial frame you care to and it works out.

Unfortunately, to avoid *major* problems, they have to obey the
conservation laws *somehow*. You\'ve already seen my analysis of the
dodge of having them pushing on some outside object. The energy
required goes up as the velocity goes up. And if you consider that part
of the energy goes to pushing the other onject (any object, up to and
including the entire rest of the universe), then KE and momentum work.

I made another post a few messages back just assuming that we conserved
KE via use the "work equals force times distance" formula. This is
reasonable and is "reactionless". But the energy consumption again goes
up rapidly as your velocity increases. (In fact, I think the results
actually come out the same as assuming you are pushing on something
else, much to my surprise).

The problem is that you are postulating *two* "impossible things".
First, a drive that takes energy and turns it into velocity (ie
"reactionless"). Second, that it uses the same amount of energy per
delata-v at all speeds (the way a reaction drive works).

It\'s possible to justify either statement and have fun with it. But
both taken together are *not* consistent, and lead to problems like
being able to hit relativistic velocities cheaply. To regain
consistency, you have to keep adding more ad hoc qualifications to how
things work. And people keep finding holes in *those*.

The *simplest* solution is to keep the conservation laws, and change
the performance of thruster plates.

Just for kicks and grins, let\'s figure the energy to go 1.3e9 meters
(roughly the 100 diameter limit for earth). Obviously, the energy
required varies with the acceleration. Both you and I both agree on
*that* much. Energy is energy per kg of ship.

        trip    peak	total	peak

Excuse me. "Slug weapons" *are* KKW!

Weapons of mass destruction are defined as weapons which kill
indiscriminately over wide areas.

Thus, smart crowbars and flying telephone poles are *not* weapons of
mass destruction. The "rock" used to take out that comm cemter in a
previous post *was*, unless the center was a couple of clicks across,
or it was buried so deeply that such a weapon was required to reach it.

And even if it *was* deeply buried, there\'d be *some* argument about
the morality of the attack if the target was buried under a population
center. On the other hand, opinion currently seems to be in favor of
blaming the *owner* of a military target for placing it near civilians.

Inertia *is* mass. The only real "exception" to this is that it is
still not 100% certain that "inertial mass" and "gravitational mass"
are the same thing. Tests show that if they differ, we can\'ty measure
the difference yet.

Gravitational mass is the mass in F=GMm/r^2, and the few equations
derived from it. Inertial mass is the mass in F=ma, and just about
every other formula.

Traveller\'s contra-gravity (and possibly antigravity) require inertial
mass to be different from gravitational mass for them to work according
to the descriptions. CG and AG lower or neutralize gravitational mass,
but have no effect on the inertial mass. 

The "zeta field" and E.E. Smith\'s Bergenholm neutralize *inertial*
mass, but not gravitational mass. A good example is the graduation
sequence in "Galactic Patrol". They march into a "drop shaft" and go
"free" (inertialess). They drop to the bottom of the shaft *fast* then
stop instantly upon reaching the bottom.

The drop is due to gravvity acting upon their mass, with *only* the
drag from the air to slow them.

>  Hmmm...  Maybe the berg should be an alternatech in FFS2?

I\'d like it. Heck, I\'d like it even better if IG could get permission
for as many different "technologies" as possible. 

On fun one is F.M. Busby\'s "Habegger gate". It allows teleportation
over any distance. You put something in the "mouth" unit, and it comes
out the "tush" victim. Obviously you have to transport the "tush" to
whereever you want to exit, and you\'d probably want to take along a
"mouth" as well so you can get back. There\'s a catch though. While
anyone who enters the mouth will think no time elapsed before they came
out the tush, in reality, two years elapses. The duration *does* obey
relativity. It\'s 2 years on earth. On a ship accelerating at close to
c, it could be only a week or two.

I like them, because they allow star travel (ships use the gates to
refuel and to exchange crew), but they make things nicely complex.
They\'re *lousy* for warfare. Would you send an attack force thru when
it takes 4 years to find out what happened to them?

Imagine introducing them to the Imperium. :-)

Nope. To reach .1c takes 850 hours of acceleration at 1 g. But I can do
it at 1 hour a *year*. Of course, that\'d take 850 years. At an hour a
week, it\'d take 16.4 years. At an hour a day it\'d take 2.33 years. At
6 days a week, it\'d take 41 days.

Not the simple munition. But anyone using a "weapon of mass
destruction" be it a nuke, a *big* rock, a small relativistic rock,
major use of deadly chemical agents or biological agents is going to be
about as popular as Pol Pot or Adolph Hitler.

You misread my statement. I was using C&S as an example of a system
that *failed*. It had nice, realistic rules. And far too much
complexity. But some of us bought it so we could deal with the
"details" if they ever became important. (like telling players that
they can only get so many men to work on fortifications, and only at
some times of year unless they want to starve!)

Not really. All you know is that it\'s a hot spot. If you guess that
it\'s a deep meson site, and it\'s actually a normal hotspot (Yellowstone
is a good, if large, example) hitting it with something powerful enough
to knock out a DMS will cause a *major* geological event. Things like
flooding everything within hundreds of miles with lava pouring from the
rift you created. And major earthquakes as well. 

Study some geology. Much of the Pacific Northwest has layers of basalt
*hundreds* of meters thick from a set of rifts that formed in Idaho or
Montana. The flows extend almost to the Pacific coast, and into places
like Wyoming in the east.

Creating something like that is going to get a commander into a *world*
of trouble.

Also, as another message pointed out, hot spots in the deep ocean are
*very* hard to detect.

There are natural mascons. It won\'t be very hard to make sure that the
average density of the installation matches that of the surrounding
rocks, which means that you *can\'t* detect it as a mascon (or as the
opposite).

Jeff, I did just that with the Pulse Rifle (also using Phoenix Command\'s 
Aliens RPG as reference) a few months back.  It came out non-optimal as far 
as the FF&S / TNE rules were concerned, but it wasn\'t a bad facsimile.  I 
did have to use some other people\'s (sorry, forgot the names off hand) 
house rules for things like alternate materials and caseless ammo to get 
the weight down to a reasonable level, tho\'.

I\'d be interested to see anything you did design.

By that reasoning, paratroopers would never parachute into enemy
territory. Yet that is the very *purpose* of paratroops. To go into
enemy territory in advance and destroy targets or hold objective until
the main forces can get there.

The problem here is that given Traveller technology, being mobile is
going to make you a bigger target! 

Im my forces have orbital superiority, then we can broadcast a warning
that *any* vehicles moving between population centers will be destroyed
without warning. And we\'ve got the weapons to enforce it. 

That kills your "mobility". You either have to move slowly, or you have
to be *well* stealthed. 

Note that such measures also encourage surrender. Once an area has
surrendered, you can allow *limited* movement. So until a city
surrenders, it doesn\'t get any supplies... including *food*.

The problem is telling *which* targets are jump troops, and which are
decoys and "chaff". The whole idea of jump troops is that for every
trooper there are *dozens* of equally good targets. Plus, I get the
impression that the orbital support elements would be engaging in fire
suppression.

So if you shoot at something that *might* be a trooper, you are
inviting counter-fire from *much* bigger guns.

Probably. But even if they do, do they have superior numbers IN THE
DROP ZONE? If not, the jump troops have surprise *and* numbers on their
side. And you try to pick targets where the enemy *isn\'t* concentrated.
Frontal assualts are not what you use this sort of unit for.

If you don\'t have orbital superiority, then you don\'t launch an assualt
unless you are willing to sacrifice a *lot* of ships and men.

Why do troops always land first in modern assualts? Because they are
*smaller* targets. Once you\'ve got men and some heavy weapons in place,
you have a chance to get the heavier equipment landed.

Also, you attack *several* places on the ground, land troops on some of
them, and only follow up with armor and the like on a few. The enemy
has to *guess* where your *real* beachead is, and which are just
feints.

Only assuming that the people had enough freedom to start with. After
all, the Soviet Union did *not* have a rebellion over the various
attempts at rebellion in eastern Europe, nor over the atrocities in
Afghanistan.

In World Builders Handbook, published by Digest Group Publications, there was
many related  law levels governing different areas of life.  This is the
system I always use.

Now, rather than just a single numerical value (or several numerical values)
describing severity, I\'d be interested in an optional system to generate
details about how the law works.  Eg., is it British common law, French Code
Napoleon, Roman law, ...  Possibly a nice lawyer (we\'ve got one here) could
write a 2-3 page description of various legal codes?  (Hint, hint.)

I can\'t remember.  I\'ll right it down next time.  It just pisses me off so

I\'m hoping that all the work I did last night will fix the damn thing.
Thanks for the info though.  I spend a couple of hours re-installing some

Perhaps I should increase the amount of virtual memory on the hard drive...

This is true but when they\'re gutting your ships left right and center who

I beleive if you read "PATH OF TEARS" there is data on the planet Kiepes.
Kiepes has a DMS and I think they have a number of passive and active sensor
sites scattered about the planets surface.  A "Sensor Web" if you will.

  That is not what it says.  The ammendment reads:  \'A well-regulated
Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the
people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\'

It defines a right of the people, not the states.  Or as the US Supreme
Court put it: 
"... \'the people\' seems to have been a term of art employed in select parts
of the Constitution. The Preamble declares that the Constitution is
ordained, and established by \'the people of the U.S.\' The Second Amendment
protects the right of the people to keep and bear Arms...." - Supreme Court
of the U.S., U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990). 

Would the phrase, "A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the
security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and read Books,
shall not be infringed." mean that only registered voters can own books?

Ya.  Unfortunately when someone punches a hole in the side of a navy ship
they may or may not float.  When someone punches a hole in the side of a
starship you may or may not get blown out into the big black.  

Steve Gallaci did a great picture of a ship after explosive decompression in
an Albedo module "The Drift?" just great.  Every pannel in the ship that
might have had air behind it was bent, ripped up all the displays and
controlls had exploded outwards, what a mess.

I\'m not aware of any, but that may not be saying all that much.  I\'d

The free trader as designed cannot pay for itself.  The higher cost along
with the crew requirements (which push up the cost of the life support) make
it impossible to survive without a subsidy or speculative trading.  This
also assumes full passanger and cargo loads per trip and no downtime.  The
bank would never make this mortgage.

Also note the Book 2 Free Trader had 10 state rooms, which ment 8 high
passages available instead of only 6 passages in the 10 state rooms of the
QSDS design which unbalances it even more.

I can appreciate the want for designs to be consistant from the beginers
sequences to the advanced sequences, but they also have to be compatiable
with the basic game.

If that was true shouldn\'t registered voters be the only ones allowed to
keep guns?  It\'s one of those vague and nebulous questions that you or I
can\'t interperate.  Like the Catholic Church, anyone can own a bible, but
only the pope can tell you what it means.  No offence intended to any

This is the truth isn\'t it.  Everyone wants to get rid of guns untill the
man knocks on the door and says "I\'m here to get your gun."  Then all of a
sudden its a civil defence issue.

   This was covered briefly, early on in the discussion.

   There are several choices:

   1) Use neutrino sensors, less accurate but they don\'t have to exposed
      to be usable.

   2) Use redundant passive EMS arrays on the surface of the planet. These
      are vulnerable, but don\'t give themselves away by emmissions. 

   3) Use *active* EMS arrays. They give the most accurate targetting
      solution, but gives themselves away via their emissions. Least 
      optimal, as any kind of fire control will be blown away from orbit
      as soon as it\'s detected.

    In any case, should the sensors somehow get discovered, they will be
destroyed in short order by appropriate means. If all the redundant fire
control sensors for a given DMS is destroyed, that DMS is useless.

  I thought that was a "given" <g>

  It was implied when we discussed using drop troops to search/destroy
DMSes.

Marc sent a note yesterday on symbols, so I don\'t its too late yet, 
but at the same time, since graphics are filler material in some 
instances, it sounds like it might be close.

I wonder how close it is to going to the printers...  Can\'t be more

Good, I like cascade skills.

I was just proposing making them _officially_ \'optional\' for groups that
wanted a faster game.  Most of the new gamers I encounter are obsessed with
the \'official\' rules.  (This is why Citadel can charge $15 for a single
miniature - these kids must have the \'official\' miniature or their friends
won\'t play with them.)  I was like that myself at their age.  In fact, it was
a letter from Marc Millar telling me to ignore the rules (!) when I wanted to
that started my campaign going.  (I could show the letter to the
rules-lawyers and say "See, the Traveller creator said I could ignore his
rules to make a better game.")  

Just for your information (because the rules are probably already finished),
my group tends to ignore a lot of the military cascades, but we add ones for
the sciences.  I guess this is because to a physicist having a single
"Physics" skill is like having a single "Firearms" skill to a soldier.  There
are specializations in both fields, with crossovers and areas of common
knowledge between the specialization.

I guess the question is how are you using cascades?  Will it be a
concentration, with the other options being at half (or some other fraction),
or will it be a selection with no default in the other options?

    'body' => 'I hate blind obedience to "canon" as much as the next fellow, despite having 
great fun toying with its implications and ways around it.  I\'m only getting
into this because I see some interesting adventure hooks.

I\'ve asked here before about what information we have on Sylea, which would
seem (from the existence of a separate Sylean language) to be the home of
a minor-race branch of humaniti, admixed with Vilani and Solomani blood
(and noble/governing classes) from the First and Second Imperia.  And now
I\'ve found additional "evidence" to support this view.

CT Supplement 5, "Lightning Class Cruisers", gives an exhaustive list of the
names of all vessels in the class.  These include (p. 6): 6326 Azhanti High 
Lightning, 6327 Sylean High Lightning, 6328 Vilani High Lightning, 6350
Fiorin High Lightning, 6351 Geonee High Lightning, 6357 Acheron High
Lightning, 6365 Suerrat High Lightning, 6366 Ilurian High Lightning, 6372
Luriani High Lightning.

We know, from abundant other material, that the Vilani are a major human
race, and that the Suerrat (of Ilelish sector) and the Geonee (of Massilia)
are notable minor branches of humaniti.  It would seem reasonable, then,
that the Azhanti, Syleans, Fiorin, Acherons, Ilurians, and Luriani are
also minor human races from the more coreward regions of Imperial territory,
among the many such contacted by the Vilani during their early expansion.

I already have images of the Acherons as a largely subterranean, well-nigh-
troglodytic variant of the human frame.  We "know" the Suerrat are still
semi-arboreal, and the Geonee short and stocky nomadic heavy-worlders.
What of the Azhanti, Fiorin, Ilurians, Luriani... and Syleans?

I see a great potential for political and social intrigue in the Milieu
Zero setting if the Syleans are acknowledged and detailed.  The first two
Imperia were dominated by a single human sub-species... might some on 
Sylea consider this their "rightful turn," rather than supporting Cleon
Zhunastu (the ethnic Solomani noble and industrialist) and his dream of
a peaceful multi-ethnic state for co-equal sentients, human and alien?

How are ethnic Syleans treated on their own homeworld?  The Ziru Sirkaa
ruthlessly supressed "clients" who didn\'t fit into the Vilani mold.  The
Rule of Man liberated many, but hardly lasted long enough to exert a
significant social influence.  Are they lower-class citizens on their own
homeworld, still ruled by centuries-old lines of old colonial and military
administrators?  Has there been extensive inter-breeding, to "smooth out"
some of the distinctive features of Sylean physiognomy (and might some
cultural preservationists resent that too)?  What distinctive features
of Sylean culture have helped to preserve this interstellar polity, the
Sylean Federation (and its now-revealed logo, the Sylean Lattice), to
grow into the Third Imperium?

There\'s perilous little "canon" on which to base all this discussion.
That could, of course, just add to the fun.  I\'d be interested to hear
what kind of light Marc Miller and Timothy Brown plan to shed on the
many minor races (both human and alien) that undoubtedly await re-contact
as Sylea expands.  Variant branches of humaniti are one of Traveller\'s
most exciting ideas, but one, I think, too little explored in previously
published products.

  It\'s a pest.  It\'s one less problem to deal with when you get hulled
though.
  Milspec workstations probably even have hook ups so suited crewmembers

Chepe,

Great ideas and questions.  I think it important that the Syleans be 
detailed, as well as their homeworld.  The impact of Sylean society 
on the early development of the Imperium can\'t be underestimated.

	Hate to get pissy about it, but this whole \'Explosive Decompression\' 
bit is so overdone and untrue (just saw <another> bad sf flick that 
got it wrong;-(

	A ship that rapidly, even explosively vents it\'s air isn\'t going to 
have ripped panels or any suchlike. It\'s ONLY a 14 psi difference 
here! Loose paper\'s gonna blow around a lot, and whatever caused the 
decompression coould easily rip panels around and stuff, but hell, a 
balloon will hold up against a 14 psi difference easily. 

	Personell exposed to a rapid decompression do not: explode, spew 
blood out of every opening, have their heads swell like balloons, die 
instantly, or anything like that.  Hell, they won\'t even get the 
bends (you need to go deeper than one atmosphere underwaterbefore you 
have to start messing with the decompression tables).

	I believe Arthur C. Clarke wrote a short story that illustrates 
this. Some people need to get from a damages space station to a ship, 
by walking out the airlock without suits.  They do it simply and 
easily. Essentially you have to hyperoxygenate your blood (deep 
breathing for a minute or so) the open your mouth and float out. You 
may fart embarrassingly, and if you freak and hold your breath your 
ears will hurt, but thats about it...the worst you can get is a burst 
eardrum, and you\'ll be good for 30-90 seconds or so without passing 
out.

	Now, you don\'t want to get into direct sunlight (nasty sunburn), and you\'ll get pretty damn 
cold pretty quick, but getting to that airlock or other haven, such 
as a \'rescue ball\', is quite doable.

True, if you know you\'re going into combat this is wonderful, but if your a

Well say no more.

I would imagine that all workstations have PLSS hookups attached to them.  I
would think, in deep space the odds of being holed, while fairly slim are
still there and if you\'ve got to get into a suit and stay there for several
days, it could be a real inconvenience if you had to change your PLSS pack
every few hours.

Is that all the difference is, 14 psi?  Didn\'t know that.

I never though they would.  Always thought this was pretty unrealistic
myself.  Though it does look good when you\'re trying to freak an audience out.

I would imagine it can\'t be terribly good on your eyes either.

I would imagine the extent of the damage done to the interior of the vessel
would vary tremendously depending upon the volume of the ship, how much of
it was exposed to vacuum and whether your iris valves worked properly, one
would hope they do.

I have a friend who would argue with you on the effect of explosive
decompression, mind you he\'d argue with just about anyone on any topic, it\'s
just the kind of guy he is.  However, seeing as we have never first hand
experienced the effects of ED all of this is just theory.  I would imagine
NASA has done some work on it though.

ARE YOU INSANE!!!!!!!!!!!

Asking a lawyer to write 2 or three pages is like asking a shark to 
leave the woman and children alone!  Besides, the lawyer might actually
do it than bill everyone on this list!

(Notice I didn\'t make any jokes on your use of the word \'nice\' and \'lawyer\'
in the same sentence)

Actually, I think it\'s a bit of a mistake to think that only a lawyer can
come up with good information for legel systems in Traveller.  
Our own legel system is based on president.  Some worlds might 
base their legel system on logic, fairness, superstition, 
movement of the stars or dictator whim.

Laws don\'t even have to be based on a standard system.  For example, 
in Wisconsin, it\'s against the law to eat cheese while driving!

[Conversation about body armour between Cop and Bwana snipped]

My players always ask why I consider obvious body armour worn in public to be
such a big deal.  While I don\'t consider armour to be illegal, neither is
dragging around a corpse in the local shopping mal (technically)l-- SOMEBODY is
going to want to know what\'s going on!  The armour may be confiscated, maybe
not, but it can result in a lot of wasted time down at the precinct while the
character is under interrogation.  Concealed body armour is even worse, since
the officer will want to know why the character is concealing something that is
meant "purely for defense".

I was rereading Path of Tears, and I came up with a list of all the
ships the RC has lost.  The Dawn Traders all have explanations to how
they were lost, but most of the other ships don\'t.  The list is: (minus
the 12 Dawn Traders)

Lady Elise  Captured by Vampires, used as carrier pigeon. Crew is dead.
(ref\'s screen)
Ashtabula          ??? (Lost 1201)
Taylor the Bruce   ??? (Lost 1201)
Mississinewa       ??? MFU
Kukulkan Victrix   ??? (Lost 1200)
Mirabilis Victrix  ??? MFU
Muan Gwi Victrix   ??? MFU
Ember Victrix      ??? (Lost 1201)
Valeria Victrix    ??? MFU

Has anyone seen any other mention of these ship\'s fate, or made up
their own.  I think the Ashtabula is of paticular interest, it played a
large part in the early history of the Coalition, and several of the
NPCS in Star Vikings are linked to it.

these numbers will change, so I will repost the final corrections after his 
QSDS rewrite comes out.  

As Rob Miracle has noted, the economics are somewhat out of kilter here, but I 
am not as concerned about this as Rob is, since it seems to me that we could 
solve this by increasing the standard prices for tickets and hauled cargo.  And 
the Free Trader carries only 6 High Passengers after all, according to The 
Traveller Book (p64).  I don\'t have access just now to the old 3-book set to 
see if that was a change, or what.

I am still VERY concerned with the crew figures (which contributes to the 
economics problems).  In vessels with large power plants, the Engineering Crew 
becomes huge.  Look at the Mercenary Cruiser, for example.  If there is going 
to be a crew adjustment, I would start with this area.  I still think a 
TL-based or computer-based crew modifier could be added onto the existing QSDS 
rules without disrupting the work Guy has already done.

Another area of confusion: staterooms.  The QSDS rules imply that the 
staterooms can hold maximum 1 person.   Is double-occupancy no longer allowed?  
Is it allowed only for Large staterooms?  Some clarification would be in order.

  I was going to let this drop, we\'re really disagreeing here on matters
  of degree not form, but I just thought I\'d add that all you have is a bearing
  only solution - there\'s no easy way to *range* the DMS, therefor you can\'t

  it\'s on. It\'d still likely be good enough to send a team down to look at the
  most likely areas, though.

  I agree 100%. I also postulate in my universe that jumps will advertise
  themselves with a gravitic pulse that is easily detectable.

  Not hard at all, his bodyguards in combat armour *can* be a wee little
  problem, though. There is also the question of the anti-terrorist program
  that he will no doubt activate while he\'s on the bridge.

  Do you have his codes available? Are you prepared to die when the DMS
  fires on you after you deviate from the allowed flight plan?

  Lots of adventure possiblities here.

  Nitpick here: How do they "farm" for fuel when they\'re travelling at
  fractional-cee velocities? I toyed with the idea for a while and
  concluded that it would be impractical to push, decellerate, grab some
  fuel, accelerate, push, etc. (repeat as necessary) This would give
  diminishing returns VERY quickly. A dedicated fueling fleet perhaps?
  Man, you better assume this is a Black Op - no terrorist group is going
  to have this kind of wherewithal without MAJOR support.

  Also, don\'t assume they won\'t be detected \'til late. MT (don\'t have
  FF&S handy) says you can get passive EMS out to 2 parsecs. Seems
  excessive to me, but the next one up says 100,000 AU. Given that
  the jump emergence pulse will show up like a strobe, warning PD
  (Planetary Defence) something\'s up, I don\'t think it\'s a unreasonable
  to assume that PD will catch on quickly, especially that after the rock
  starts giving off gamma from particle collisions.

  Hmm. This brings up another point. Since Traveller starships have no
  magic force fields, perhaps this is a reasonable way to limit
  reactionless thrusters? Radiation poisoning could ruin your whole day,
  and it doesn\'t take that much V to get a nasty sunburn from particle
  collisions.

>Oh yeah, when the "rock" hits, the impact energy is only 2.40e21
>Joules. Or 571 Gigatons.

  Even if PD doesn\'t catch on quick enough, a fractional-cee KKW can
  *always* be stopped, provided a ship is available starting out
  between the rock and the planet. Like I said trivial to prove.

  Rather than bring out the Big Gun myself, I\'ll let you say it. <g>

  Relativistic mass _does_ matter - remember, according to GR/SR there is
  no mathematical difference between the ship moving forward at c, and the
  particles moving backwards at c. As far as the ship is concerned, it\'s
  getting hit by these extremely massive pancake shaped particles.

  I think the practical result would be a rapidly escalating scale of drag.

>Smith had the ships requiring force fields reinforcing the hull.

  Absolutely essential. Rad poisoning is NO fun.

Well, I kept going \'cause it seemed interesting :-)  Disagreeing on
quantitative stuff sure beats flames, however.

As for it being a bearing only solution... if the ship ain\'t moving, and
the beam is coming *at* you, then you\'re right.  If the sensor moves,
you\'ll get a triangulation (some, anyway) assuming the event isn\'t
uniform (a couple decays close to each other in space, a little apart in
time).

Then you have the fact that the image will be a line across space.
Again, a 2d solution.  Combined there\'s a good chance at imaging the
beam after a bit.  Particularly if the weapon has a high ROF.

The consequences though might add neat flavor... DMSs shooting at low
ROFs, and switching targets frequently. Or multiple DMSs working in
concert to try and baffle attackers.  Orbital meson emitters to do noise
jamming, etc..  Fun stuff :-)

I disagree. As others have said before, you should be able to tell your
players that it is simply impossible (and not just "morally unacceptible").
Certainly dropping rocks will be possible, but it need not be possible to
drop a rock at 0.8c with enough kinetic energy to crack a planet in half!
Make sure that the referee can say this is impossible without going directly
against the rulebook. You *will* lose players otherwise.

Consider a group of relatively new players. Using descriptions from the
rulebook, they progressively come up with newer and better uses for certain
items. Each seems reasonable and "legal", but eventually they come up with
a "superweapon". You could say no to it, but then you may have to back out
some history. Besides, you can certainly infer from the rules that it is
legal. But if the "superweapon" was possible, somebody else clearly would
have come up with it earlier. You may or may not have the option of adding
some danger to its use, but the players may be willing to risk it anyway.

Now, no matter what you do, the game system looks bad--you either undo
character actions, move your campaign away from the Traveller "feel", or
tell your players "well I\'ll allow it this time...". It leaves a bad taste
in people\'s mouths whatever you do.

You don\'t have to explain how things like maneuver drives work. But if
you do, consider all of the consequences of your explanation.

There is a *big* difference between a ship traveling at 20 km/s and one
traveling at greater than 30,000 km/s.

I\'m talking about the comprehensive solution here. If thrusters cost more,
use more fuel (even considering that used as reaction mass), are just as
dangerous, and don\'t give you the same thrust, then people won\'t use them.

You are right, that is what really matters. Of course, this alone could
prevent the 0.8c planet-cracker if done right. You also will *not* get
unlimited acceleration for a month this way unless something like the
"zeta field" is used.

I don\'t care at all about military actions. Just make sure it is not the
case that *every* ship can *completely* destroy a planet by dropping a
rock on it. Sure, a ship *might* be able to screw up the ecosystem of a
*completely unprotected* planet (destroying itself in the process), but
that is not the same thing.

OFFICE OF CALENDER COMPLIANCE:

An Imperial sunburst with a "orbit ring" around it, seen as if from a few
degrees above the ecliptic, along the ring are regulare hashmarks.  This
suggests a year divided up equally.

IMPERIAL INTERSTELLAR SCOUT SERVICE:

A triangle, point up.  from the two bottom corners of the triangel, arching
up to about 1/4 the height, is a view of a blue-green planet (picture the
view from the space shuttle).  Near the top, about the 2/3rds height line,
is a sunbirst in red.  The rest of the field is black, with white/silver
stars added.  The whole thing is surronded by a red border

On the Imperial standard.. I believe it is canon (there\'s that word again..
) that the original Imperial Flag was a black banner with a gold sun.  It
wasn\'t until 247 that color became optional.  Though I imagine the branches
of the military taking distinctive colors early on.

Side note:  Does anyone have the complete alphabet that DGP used in their
artwork?  I trnaslated most of the signs, but it seemed that some letters
were missing.. I need this for costuming purposes..  :)

What\'s good for the goose is good for the gander. Once they can find it 
multiple Meson Gun equiped capital ships could take out the DMG. This is 
an interesting design problem. I\'m not familiar with the FF&S rules but
with the limitations imposed on meson guns by HG it would be easy to take 
care of the DMG problem from orbit. Before the FF&S vs. HG flamewar 
starts my point is that another Meson gun or group of orbital meson guns 
could take out a planet bound DMG no matter where you hide it. 

I\'m curious as to the range of these DMG\'s though. Would it be on the 
order of Earth -- Mars at closest approach. The reason I ask is because 
that\'s where the DMG would be useful against terrorists hauling a rock to 
try and destroy your mainworld.

And yet the day of the mass tactical drop is over.  There has been some
serious discussion of deactivating the 82nd Airborne as a cost cutting
measure.  The real strength of Airborne is in the infiltration possibilities.

Move counter-move.. remember, the French felt secure at Dien Bien Phu
because the Viet Minh had no heavy weapons to hit the airfield.  Until the
VM *manhandled* 105mm howitzers onto a mountaintop, and carried the ammo one
shell at a time.

In Vietnam, the US invested millions in new tech to find the enemy, and it
failed.  I believe that most Planetary Denfence Forces (PDF) will be trained
to go to ground, organize resistence, and wait for the oppurtunity to strike.

And what happens when the "pacified" area suddenly is rocked with air/raft

I seem to recall that the RC Equipment Guide had a varient of the basic drop
capsule that carried deadfall ordinance or a guide missle.  Put a radar
detector in the nose, when it picks up a radar lock, it either drops all its
bombs or launches a missle right at the set that locked it up.

Not to mention the righteous fury of the guys you were shooting at.  The

fired on paratroopers were massacred.

Also, infantry can see more.  A tanker involved with flying his Intrepid,
watching for enemy tanks, and listening for the TC\'s next order isn\'t going
to notice the squad with dug in VRF Gauss guns and the anti-tank missle.

Basically, you want your Landing Zone to be free of enemy artillery.  This
is your marshalling point, and things will get confused, as different units
land, plans get changed, and the supply bus brings in tons of material.

If you can clear a ring about 20km in diameter of enemy vehicles, you can
start bringing down the big guys.

Exactly.  Bluffs can work well too.  In the Gulf War, the Marines sailed up
and down of Kuwait, driving the Iraqi high command nuts!  When the ground
phase began, *7* Navy SEALs went ashore and caused enough rukus that the
Iraqi commander that a USMC division was ashore.

Its amazing how totally PO\'d they get when you try to point these things
out.  "By the way assault rifles are illegal on this planet."  

Ya well they\'re illegal in Canada too, doesn\'t mean you can walk down a
public street with a Gloc on your hip and a shotgun over your back though.
Try to point this out and everyone\'s nose gets out of joint.

PLAYER:  Why can\'t I carry my man portable death ray?  It\'s only SMG\'s that
are illegal on this planet.

GM:  Just because it\'s legal doesn\'t mean you can walk down main street with
it on your hip.

And a person in obvious Body Armor is probably carrying a weapon somewhere.
Although it\'s a great thing to base an adventure around.

Could be a morale thing.  The fighter pilots are all educated guys and know 
that the Meson beam is safe at that range, but there\'s always a sinking 
suspiscion "What if the Gunnery guys mess up today?"

I recall similar feelings during a live-fire Army exercise one upon a time.

	The \'Crewmember as employee\' paradigm that\'s used probably wouldn\'t
apply to a small trader like that.  A major transport corp could
well afford the Far Trader, because they\'ll get an even steeper
discount on the ships due to volume purchase.  A Ford escort is
cheap, but it\'s even cheaper when you buy five or six thousand of
them, like a big rental company.

	A better economic model of an independent trader is, in fact pretty
much how most Trav PC\'s with their own ships operate, as a
partnership, with shares in the profits as the only salary...banks
make loans, relatively large ones, on this basis all the time. Yes
they\'re risky, and that\'s why they charge the interest they do. 
Also skip tracing in the imperium must be a lucrative business (And
sometimes the borrower gets caught...our dear guv\'nor was indicted
on 23 counts of fraud, etc last week over a failed real estate
venture.)

	Also, the only income figures you used are from a universe where the 
ships get by with half the crews...if expenses go up, the rate for a 
high or middle passage is certainly going to be higher.  
Remember...if the crew needed for your little tramp Far Trader has 
doubled, so has the crew requirement for that luxurious 5000 ton QE2 
of the SpaceLanes.  That means you\'re applying the wrong income to 
the equation.  The same goes for cargo rates as well.

	This simply points out that there has to be a little inflation in 
the Traveller universe to account for the union rules for ship\'s 
engineers ;-)

his full body armour and FGMP.

Yeah. The idea (IMHO) isn\'t to make it impossible to do, just a little
more unlikely for somebody to do without much thought.

The limits are political/social:  This is an imoral act, a crime against
humanity (sentience).

Physical:  Before your Scout shi[p gets enough velocity to wreak a world
you\'ll hit a micrometeor an the ship will become a dispersed cloud of
debris (moving at a very high velocity, but less likely to do world
killing damage :-)

I think this works pretty well.  The only rules addition is to
explicitly state that going above a certain velocity (relative to local
matter) is Bad_For_Your_Health_(tm).  Easy enough to do, and doesn\'t
break canon at all (as I see it).  CT doesn\'t include special relativity
rules, so ships must not ever go that fast...

True.  Real pions would decay after passing through some matter (and
traveller ships are collapsed matter at high TLs, right?).  I\'d think
that if you had to spend a reaonable fraction of your life near a
radiation source it\'s just a safety measure (the dose would be small,
but you\'ll get lots of doses----easier to move the landing area than pay
the medical bills later :-)

Ashtabula is the one ship on this list I think is mislabled.  In the
"Personalities Guide" Pat "Who Me?" Ritter, captain of the ThunderChild (?)
wants despirately to get his ship transfered to Diaspora so he can look for
Ashtabula.  The word Lost implies to me that she was destroyed in a battle
and everyone knows it.  MFU (Missing Fate Unknown) is probably a better
description of what happened to Ashtabula.  No one knows.

On a personal note I was trying to track down Ashtabula too, my PC was a
crew member of Ashtabula during the rescue mission, wounded at Vezina,
transfered to Aubane for medical attention.  Ashtabula disappeared before I
could get reassigned to the ship.  I poked and prodded my GM for clues but
he never gave me any.  I\'d say anyship listed as LOST, was destroyed beyond
repair, any ship listed as MFU is up to you.  I\'d like to hear what your
decision is on Ashtabula.  I think she misjumped and is somewhere in
Diaspora, but who really knows, maybe she was destroyed by a Vampire Fleet.

>Taylor the Bruce   ??? (Lost 1201)

Taylor the Bruce was lost in combat.  

RCEG Pg. 150.  "As two of this type, Lady Elise and Taylor the Bruce, have
already been lost or listed as missing, this type has fallen into disfavor."
Where and by whom I guess is your choice.  Probably towards Diaspora and
more than likely due to guild or pirate action.

This is true, but I think that there is another issue to be raised:  TL
differences.

Make sure when redoing CT ships that the TLs are the same.  Also,
remember the change in TL11- ships.  Fusion isn\'t as good below TL12
now.

As a result, ships that might be good in CT at 200tons might need to
become 400tons, or might have to use older drive types to get along.

I just would be wary of expecting every low TL ship come out as small as
it used to.

Just an idea,

This is true the problem is you\'ve got to find the deepsite first.  The only
way in FF&S as in HG to take out a DMG is to Meson it from orbit or walk in
and take it by force.

Actaully I think the DMG was in reference to Starships using Ortillery on
the planet rather than against asteroids.  But given that the range of a MG
is based upon barrel lenght and diameter, and because in a DMS you don\'t
have to pay attention to any kind of size restrictions you could in theory
hit something way the heck out there unfortunately the targeting time lapse
would render it largely ineffective beyond several light minutes (the reason
I say minutes is an asteroid, unlike a starship, is completely incapable of
preforming any evasion or changing it\'s speed dramatically).  Theoretically
though I suppose this would work.

Any comments from everyone else?

This I like.  I didn\'t realize that the Terran Confederation used the UN
symbol I knew the solomani used the gia symbol, circle with an +, and I
kinda felt that the use of the UN symbol would be in there somewhere but I
never knew.

Well son popsicle sticks are still legal on this planet.  If you sharpen
several pencils and use the popsicle sticks for defence you should not get
hassled by the locals.

PC\'s feel naked without handguns, I can\'t explain it.  They\'re paranoid
beyond belief.  If they don\'t have a Mark V Death Ray on their hips they
can\'t go to the bathroom.  Mind you Gm\'s have a habit of sicking well armed
thugs on them and perhaps thats something of our fault but still what\'s this
obsession with weapons.  The average PC\'s ships locker would make an arms
merchant drool.  I\'m an offender on this account too, but I\'m no where near
as bad as the guys I game with.

        Great.  Another one.  There goes the neighbourhood :).  Let\'s not
forget stuff like Islamic and Hindu law, where the relevant religious texts
are the basis for the system, or systems like Nazi law, which was really
bizarre.  Friend of mine is doing his Phd on the denazification of the
justice system in one German state following WWII, and some of the things
he\'s told me about law under the Nazis are just bizarre...

        If you do wind up doing this, I\'d highly recommend Rene David\'s _Les
Grands Systemes de Droit Contemporain_.  It\'s been translated.

        Well, you asked for it :).  I\'ll try and cobble something together.
What I was thinking of were some of the 19th C European corporate entites,
because a) they kind of fit the mercantile/empire mood, and b) they\'ve got a
few interesting formalities that could, IMHO, make for plot or subplot
motors in adventures that are more mercantile or political in nature (share
transfer restrictions in a S.A.R.L. would be irrelevant to OrSPAMmery :>).

        Actually, given his drafting, I would argue that his offer is
gratituous, i.e. that he\'d be doing it on a pro bono basis, and therefore
your fears about billing are groundless :).  And I, for one, tend to prefer

        On the other hand, we could provide some useful general info on how
these legAl systems would work, and more importantly, how these might
manifest themselves in ways that could make interesting plot hooks or add
good background.  What I\'m planning on doing over the weekend is something
on various corporate forms, soe of which, IMHO, would do exactly that.

        Well, actually, Wisconsin\'s legal system is much the same as that of
most other American states; it\'s just this particular aspect of it that\'s
rather, er... whimsical :).

        Actually, in Canada, it\'d be called "offering an indignity to a
corpse", and it\'d be illegal.  In passing, I read this case where someone
tried to get off a charge of this by claiming that he actually thought,
during the commission of the offence, that he was committing sexual assault
and therefore didn\'t have the requisite intent.  Airsickness bags are to be

   The big problem with this is blowing up the asteroid isn\'t good enough.
You have to TOTALLY VAPOURIZE the threat to make this work. Simply
fragmenting the asteroid is going to be worse because multiple small
impacts are worse than a single big impact (much like a shotgun blast is
DEADLY at short range) DMSes are totally useless against incoming
asteroids unless they are arriving at "normal" velocities.

   The best defence against a planet-wrecker rock is a ship, either by
intercepting and deflecting it, or doing the kamikaze with a ship/rock.

   One thing that the PDF might do is use nuke PAD missiles to vapourize
the rock, but this is risky on anything larger than about 100m.

Actually, you may want to think more 18th century.  By the 19th 
century, corporate entities were becoming a lot more centralized, and 
tightly structured.  I\'ve always viewed the Megacorps as something 
like the Hudson Bay Company, or East India Company.  Given a virtual 
monopoly by the Emperor or representatives to exploit the resources of a 
particular sector or subsector or world.  Obviously, the East India 
Company could not micromanage the details of day to day operations in 
Bombay from London in the 18th century, but they could put Lord Such 
& Such, who they knew from their days together at Cambridge, at the 
head of the Bombay operation...  Labor organizations, and 
professional organizations would have the same sort of decentralized 
structure...

19th century companies (at least after the invention of the 
telegraph), began to develop bureaucratic structures patterned after 
the Prussian model.  A lot more tightly controlled than STL 
communications would allow.

Two to three pages of an overview of Vilani law, with reference to how

mixed civil law and common law concepts as needed to accomplish UNSCA
internal objectives) as imported into the Rule of Man, then into the Third

fun, but it sounds more like a series of short articles.  Maybe I could get
continuing legal education credit.

What aspects of the law do you want to know about the most?  commercial?
contract? intellectual property? criminal? judicial procedure?

Such a bill would probably not be enforceable as a matter of law (no
contract having been formed).  As practical matter, finding all of the real
names and reporting them to TRW would cost more (in attorney time) than it
would be worth.  Forget about finding real addresses and attempting to sue
people located all over the planet on a small claim.  

>Actually, I think it\'s a bit of a mistake to think that only a lawyer can

I agree.

>Our own legel system is based on president.  

No, it\'s based on precedent.  Precedent is a value held by our culture.  It
indicates that we base our legal (and much other) decision-making on what
has gone before.  The appeal to authority is the key rhetorical paradigm in
this system.

>Some worlds might base their legel system on logic

Logic is just a tool, like mathematics.  A legal system has to be based on
values. 

>fairness, 

This is certainly a stated component of every legal system, because the
perception of fairness is crucial to legitimacy.

>superstition, movement of the stars 

Now you\'re talking!  There are a lot of good role-playing opportunities here.

>or dictator whim.

In practice, it\'s hard for a dictator to retain power without the form of
law.  Every dictator that I can think of -- and that\'s a large number -- has
gone through the motions of legitimizing his (they\'re all men) actions on
legal grounds, even when the rest of the people know it\'s a charade.

In my games, I usually treat legal specifics -- like whether you need a
notary\'s approval before a contract can be enforceable, as is the case under
most civil, but not common, law systems -- as transparent, unless there is a
specific need for more development.

To the extent that the list would consider it helpful to have overviews of
existing and historical legal systems, I\'d be happy to provide them, time
permitting.  I\'m not really a comparative law scholar (although lately I\'m
becoming more of one, as I do more international transactions, and less
litigation), but I can read and summarize, and I need to do so anyway.

   I\'m not sure you can split a chief like that. Better to switch it around 
like this:
A white shield with a red vertical bar, a Sunburst, crescent and star of six 
points
across the middle in opposite colours. A gold stripe across the top.
Or, roughly translated into herald:
"Argent, a pale gules. A sunbrust, crescent and star of six points fesswise
counterchanged, a cheif or."

Translation:
Sable a semi of stars, a crescent argent, chared with D&D azure.
[All this 3D stuff is artistic lisence :-]

Or nearly.
  Anyone else interested in SF heraldry? I was designing a costume entry
for a SF mercenary brigade and much of the work was based on heraldic
charges brought forward. I\'ve a database now of SF charges for
shields.
  I\'ve been meaning to write it up and put it on the web. There are a number
of "open questions" for strict heraldic interpreation. For example what
colour is an "asteroid proper"?

I\'ll leave you with the arms of "The Drachenwald Space Lancers":

A gold shield, Three red rocketships in the middle with a black
dragon on top of them, one claw raised, tail curved between the
legs and back out again. Two black comets curved around
each side.

mesons to a speed such that they will be at the target point when they
decay. 

In real life, the time that they decay is a "half-life". In other
words, half of the mesons will have decayed by that time, the other
half will decay in a longer period.

The math is rather interesting though. 25% of the particles will decay
in 50% of the half-life. That means that 25% of the particles in the
beam will decay before they get halfway to the target! Likewise, 25%
will decay in *more* than twice the half-life. Thus another 25% of the
particles will decay at more than twice the range to target.

It\'s possible to calculate more closely, but it\'s late, and I don\'t
feel like doing all the math. But it does become rather obvious that
whatever meson guns are shooting, it is rather abnormal to start with. 

Perhaps damper technology lets them reduce the "spread" in the
halflife?

Greg Bear uses something called legal logic in "Moving Mars" which is a

computers of course.
There have been attempts at formalizing law into a logical system of
non-boolean logic in reality but those attempts have failed.

I don\'t know as Jackson could sue you over the use of a acronim if the
original word are different.  And if you did found and Illuminati society he
couldn\'t sue you anyways because there really was and Illuminati back in the
20\'s.  New York I beleive.

I am concerned for one very major reason:  We don\'t have any insite into the
game itself, except that it is to be CT updated for the 90\'s.  Trade has
been the same in every release of the game, save speculative trading.  The
core costs for fuel, passage and such have remained unchanged, and we can\'t
assume that Marc has changed the core game to fit ship building.

This goes beyond economics.  If the weapons are not compatible with the
combat system (which has in someways been addressed) then it won\'t work.  It
seems as if we have been creating a ship design system in the dark with
regards to the basic rules and we expect the rules to conform to our design
system.  Well, reality here, the design system has to fit the rules.

Crew figures are very high.  They are supposedly that way because of lack of
automation etc.  But if you look at every Sci-Fi anything, ships have
considerably smaller crews than is presented by FF&S (L/QSDS).  Even in Star
Trek, they were working on automation that would let a crew of two run a
400,000T ship.  The real world models that were discussed in baseing the
crew configurations on was based on military vessels.  Commerical Air liners
are crewed by very small crews.  But we arn\'t talking today we are talking
the future.

Look at "Foundation".  Look at any "invaders from Mars" type movies, even ET
only had a few crew members and most of them were probably
passangers/scientists.  Engineers just plain are not needed on non-military
vessels.  All other vessels, visit a starport every week.  If things need
fixed or maintained it is done then.  I think that one engineer per 500T of
hull would be much more realistic.  Under 500T, engineering duties are
handled by the  flight deck crew, ah la Hans and Chewy.  500T to 999T You
need an engineer etc.
Now for military vessels, the FF&S based crews are not bad.  They go on long
manuvers and may not see a port every week.  SDB\'s can be hiding in gas
giants for a long time and would need more on-board personel to deal with
problems, where as Oberline\'s is going to maximize space for passangers and
cargo, and have their facilities do maintenence while the vessel is in port.

There is a real inconsistancy here between the vessels in cost.  The Free
Trader is much more expensive while the Sub Merchant is much less.  And the
sub. merchant is supposed to be "subsidized" because its soooo expensive.
No none would need to subsidize the merchant because it will pay for itself,
but would need the subsidy on the free trader.

How did the sub. liner workout to be 1/4th the cost?  Most are within about
20Mcr (of course that is a 40% +/- swing on some ships)?

1 other thought.  On worlds with extreme law levels, labor 
organizations are likely to be illegal, and might operate as the core 
of local revolutionary movements.  Professional Organizations, if legal, 
would be closely watched...as would companies for signs of dissidents 
or opposition to the government.

     This is actually a ship I started designing about a year ago with

I know nothing about the physics, or supposed physics of Mesons, but if
their range is based on barrel length and diameter, wouldn\'t you have to
allow a deep site to have a barrel that could be rotated to face any
direction.  This would sorta put a limit on how big it could actually be, right?

Again, I know nothing about this either, I\'m not into all that physics and
math calculations, but I would think that an accurately placed explosion
would possibly shift the asteroid\'s course enough to make it miss the
planet.  I seem to remember seeing a movie about this.  I think it was
called Asteroid, or Meteor, or something like that.  I think my parents have
it on video, so I\'ll try to watch it soon to see what all occurred.
Basically, the only thing I remember from the movie is that bothe the US and
Russia had nuc\'s in space targeted at each other, and the big stigma was the
trust that had to be created because both sets of missiles were necessary to
create the explosion necessary to shift the asteroid\'s path.  Well, I
remember that both sides agreed to turn their weapons around and target the
asteroid.  The nuc\'s hit, but I don\'t remember if that was enough or if
something else happened to move the asteroid.  Of course, in the end, the
Asteroid was moved enough and the earth was saved.

Anyway, the whole point of that discourse was to say that I was curious
about what you guys thought about using an explosion, either missile or DMS,
to change the course of a planet killer?

We\'ve seen the basic starship combat system, and the design systems
will work with the combat system; I\'m not as concerned about this (although
I would have liked to have more time for playtesting).

This has to do with the change in the basis for the design system.  In
Classic Traveller, the "big ticket" items were the drives.  In FF&S, the
most expensive components on the ship are the sensors and avionics.  These
tend to stay the same for all of the commercial starships (at TL-12 it costs
about MCr 16 for these items).  This makes the cost of a "minimum" starship
relatively high.

The cost of the hull and drives are (together) about half the total
cost of the ship; therefore larger ships are cheaper (per ton) than small
ones.  That\'s why the cost of the free trader has gone up, but the
subsidized merchant has gone down.

No, this is more of an indication that the ship design rules for QSDS 
are a product of FF&S which focused on lower tech, less automated 
ships with higher crew sizes due to fears of Virus...

Rob might want to remember though that even the Book 2 version of the 
Far Trader was not economically viable as a freight hauler.  Even the 
Book 2 version needed to speculate in order to survive.

Actually, if owned by another company (not 1 of the PC\'s) it almost 
certainly would fit that paradigm.  The captain might take shares of 
profits as a bonus, but the gunners, for example, are almost 
certainly going to be salary.

How much do you know about the rental car business...  Until about 6 
months ago, I used to work in it.  The deep discounts that used to exist in that 
business don\'t exist anymore...haven\'t for 5 years now.  Yes, rental 
companies can buy for cheaper than you or I, but not by as 
much as they used to.  The automakers found they were undercutting 
sales by their dealers, when they sold at breakeven to rental 
companies.  What was happening is the rental car companies would 
resell the cars at the end of the lease period for cheaper than the 
dealers could pay for them.  If you\'re using the rental car business as a 
paradigm, the 20% discount for volume, as provided in Traveller, 
is generous, if anything.

Of course, the rental companies don\'t buy the cars anyways.  They 
lease them for about 6-9 months, and then sell them back to the 
dealers (usually at 100% credit).  In essence what the rental company 
does is rent the cars themselves for about 6-9 months...  Basically, 
using rental companies is a bad example...

Not the acronym, the symbol, a pyramid with an eye on it.

: A few ideas that popped into my head...
: 
: IMPERIAL INTERSTELLAR SCOUT SERVICE:
: 
: A triangle, point up.  from the two bottom corners of the triangel, arching
: up to about 1/4 the height, is a view of a blue-green planet (picture the
: view from the space shuttle).  Near the top, about the 2/3rds height line,
: is a sunbirst in red.  The rest of the field is black, with white/silver
: stars added.  The whole thing is surronded by a red border

But doesn\'t the IISS have it\'s own symbol already?  It should be that
little six-legged Sylean creature running in front of the Sunburst.
Now, if I remember correctly, the IISS grew out of the SISS (Sylean
ISS).  My guess would be that maybe the SISS symbol could involve the
herbivore across the starfield idea that you gave.  Then when it
became the IISS, they could put the herbivore on top of the Sunburst
(a tribute to their beginning as SISS and incorporate their new
identity). 

Also, didn\'t Cleon I come up with the idea of the Sunburst, or was it
one of his decendents?  Another thing to keep in mind.  If we plan on
not invalidating too many prior Traveller writings, then we should
keep in mind that the Sunburst\'s ONLY color was red.  This did
change around 400 (I think) when an Empress declared that the Sunburst
would have no official color from then on (this was due to the fact that
some IR seeing species couldn\'t even see the Sunburst).

Just stiring things up.  8)

I didn\'t do the crew, but I just did the HG design (In about 5 minutes,
BTW).  HG design isn\'t anything like B2, and it costs more than both
systems (really close to QSDS, though)

This\'ll be true in HG as well.  20 tons minimum for bridge, so below
1000tons, bigger ships get a break (but all are "punished."

No, acutally he could sue.  If I remeber correctly this was one of the
reasons for the falling out between SJG and WW (White Wolf).  In their
2ed of Mage, WW had the Illuminati all over the book.  SJG told them
to remove the image.  SJG had to in order to protect their copyright
on the item.  While it may not have been created by SJG, the
eye-on-the-pyramid is copyrighted by SJG.  I think that this allows it
to use the symbol exclusively for gaming purposes (so they can\'t sue
the US gov\'t for putting the symbol on a dollar bill).

They needed to speculate because there was not always full cargo or passangers
available.  If one could have a 100% full load, they could survive in book
2.  The presented free trader is impossible to make it.

How about lowering the tech level for repulsors used as navigational

Potentially.  The length of the barrel can be no longer than the diameter of
the sphere it is incased it, stands to reason.  However, with the advent of
grav technology it is possible to create, however unlikely, a DMG with a
barrel lenght of kilimeters and kilometers long, assuming you have access to
enought power to keep both the gun and the contra grav units opperating.
This means because the effects of gravity have been nulified on the barrel
it\'s really nothing more than suspended mass with no actual weight, the
barrel won\'t flex so you have no upper limit on how long the barrel could be.

Coupled with the fact that on a planet you have an unlimited amount of space
from which to draw power or put in a power plant, you could quite literally
have this thing firing on a personal combat scale time frame, once every 5
seconds.  This would further reduce your difficulty mods.  Yeouch this is
getting nastier every moment the more thought you put into it.  Planetary
meason guns could quite literally in the space of a half hour crank out 360
shots for every 30 minute space combat term.  With the advent of MAV\'s, see
Regency Combat Vehical Guide PG40, you could also supplement the fire
capabilities of the DMS to such a point that attacking a TL15 planet with a
DMS would be next to suicide.

I don\'t want to think about the possibilities if the planet had a battallion
of Intrepids for MAV fire support.  We\'re talking total carnage.

Possibly I think the symbol is pretty ancient too.  But ya considering GDW\'s
troubles with the Evil Empire, the last thing IG needs to do is tic off
someone with big lawyers.

Wrong...

I quote from the Imperial Encyclopedia, MegaTraveller: Listing under 
Imperial Sunburst.

"The symbol of the Third Imperium established by Cleon (the first 
emperor) when the empire was proclaimed.  Images show him standing 
before the original banner with a GOLDEN YELLOW sunburst against a 
BLACK background, representing Capital\'s type G star against dark 
space."

The emphasis on color names in the above is mine.

The original sunburst was yellow with a black backdrop.  Later, when the 
Eliyoh were admitted to the Imperium, they were unable to distinguish 
between yellow & black (their visual range was mainly centered in the 
infrared).  Therefore, Porfiria declared the symbol to have no official colors.

Again to quote from the Encyclopedia,
"The original banner in the Imperial throne room is still black with 
a yellow sunburst.  The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service uses a 
red sunburst; the Imperial Navy, yellow, the Imperial Army black; the 
Imperial Marines, maroon."

Red is not, and never has been the only color of the Imperial 
Sunburst.  If any 1 color can lay that claim, it is yellow.

would just double-up on jobs.  I agree.  Remember that these people
are working hard at eeking out a living.

For example:

Free Trader Crew (MT)           Free Trader Crew (QSDS)
Bridge=1                        Pilot=2
Engineering=1                   Electronics=1
Medical=1                       Engineer=1
Steward=1                       Medical=1
                                Steward=1

So that\'s 4 vs 6.  However, I\'m still waiting for a ruling on this
one, but I used the automation multiplier on the pilot (I wasn\'t clear
on whether I could or couldn\'t).  That brings it down to 5 crew
members.  Somebody said that they got 7.  Was that including Gunnery
personel or did I mess up somewhere?

Now, electronics.  Unless this is a military vessel, this is not a
position that needs to be filled all the time.  Unlike Star Trek,
anyone other than a token minority or an alien with a bad head job can
open hailing frequencies.

So, on a vessel that flies cargo on the "main runs" wouldn\'t need a
dedicated electronics officer.  More than likely the steward could do
it.

However, this does mean that once weapons are added and you start
moving around speculative freight, then your necessary crew will begin
to increase.  While your steward may be able to man on of the guns,
your good ship\'s doctor may be able to run the electronics console.

I think that we should remember that free traders don\'t have the
luxury of a full compliment.  We should start thinking of them more as
small business people scraping along rather than thinking of them as
small underpowered fighting ships.

No, I agree with you. Although you could make a case for it being 
true of the Milieu 0 theme, which is about TL 11-12.  Keep in mind 
that Book 2 really didn\'t take TL into account.

What IG really needs to make sure of is that the ship design rules 
mesh with the economic rules, so that one isn\'t out of kilter with 
the other.  If this means tweaking the costs of shipping freight or 
high passages, so be it.

Actually, the Far Trader, as first presented in Supplement 7, is very 
specifically noted as being unviable without speculation.

The Free Trader was, but not the J-2 version.

A stand, or rather sit behind my keyboard, corrected.  I\'ve never been very
big on law.  I have noticed a disturbing trend towards sueing someone\'s
pants off though.

I have seen the symbol in the Disney Cartoon Gargoyles, I get to watch about
five minutes before heading off to work.  Eye and Pyramid tattooed on the
back of some old guy\'s hand.  Lets face it though no one messes with Disney
and gets away with it.

We do have hard experimental data on explosive decompression.  During the
60s, NASA did tests on dogs involving pressure changes, including the
rapid 1 atm to vacuum case, in order to better understand how astronauts
might fare in the same circumstances.  They particularly wanted to find
out if a human, suddenly exposed to vacuum, would have time to take a
quick corrective action -- hitting a button, putting on a mask, whatever
- -- before passing out or dying.  They found that, as expected, dogs
subjected to ED neither exploded, instantly died, nor instantly passed
out.  NASA concluded from these tests that there would be a 30 to 60
second window of full consciousness and mobility before unconsciousness,
then another three to five minutes before brain death due to anoxia --
just as in any other interrupted-breathing scenario.  The only unique
short-term effects of vacuum as opposed to smothering or drowning are
ruptured capillaries in the eyes, nasal tissues, and (possibly) parts of
the skin, none of which are serious enough to get in the way much.

Actually, I wasn\'t so worried about what you said.  It\'s just that 
everybody was proposing all these early Imperial symbol designs with 
tons of red in them, and I knew there was something wrong, but I 
couldn\'t place what it was.

If we\'re going by previous canon (unless Marc wishes to invalidate 
it), the featured color for most early Imperial symbology should 
include lots of yellow...

You\'re missing the whole beauty of this scheme!  What are Oort/Kuiper

3/4 hydrogen by atom count, respectively.  Your fuel source and weapon

     It is a possibility, but are you willing to risk fragmenting the
rock? If the rock is a solid nickel-iron slug, sure you could try but what
if the rock is a fractional-cee weapon? 

     If the "rock" is actually a carbonaceous chondrite with a
heterogenous makeup, all bets are off - this thing\'ll fragment at the drop
of a hat.

Only Steve Jackson and co. could answer this for sure, but since this 
is his company\'s trademark, I THINK HE\'D MIND VERY MUCH!  
Companies (or at least smart ones, anyways) will usually go to ANY 
legal length to defend their trademarks, product names, etc...

Hell, TSR took GDW to court and won, and this was just because a 
designer took some work home with him, and had a competitor publish 
it.  Imagine if he\'d tried to slap the AD&D trademark on it...

I\'ll put it this way.  If I were IG, I\'d steer about a million miles 
clear of somebody else\'s trademarks, particularly a direct 
competitor.

Yeah, the GDW Solomani sourcebook showed the Terran Confederation symbol, which 
was a slightly-modified UN symbol (which made snese, as the Terran

That symbol belongs specifically to the Xboat service of the IISS; the
eight-legged equine-like beast on the symbol is a \'ponii\'(sp?), which
I believe is native to Vland. The use of this animal on the symbol
arose from a member of the newly-formed IISS reading about the Pony
Express from C20th Terra (which bears some similarity to the Xboat
network), and guessing that pony and ponii were one and the same.

I don\'t remember the background of the symbol being a sunburst, but I
could be mistaken. 

I also can\'t remember exactly which book these trivial snippets were
mentioned in, but I\'d hazard a guess and say either Grand
Survey/Census or World Builders\'.

I\'m not sure if this is true; I think that the different branches of
the Imperial military use different colours. Again, I can\'t give a
source for this, but it could well have been the Travellers\' Digest.

My, but I\'m in a trivial mood today... :)

I know I\'ve seen it before, but I think it was a product of late heraldry.
If we\'re talking about Imperial Heraldry, we can change the "official"
heraldic rules to suit our purpose.

Ooooh.  Sends a chill up my spine when you say it that way.  Heraldry was a
passion of mine when I was in high school.  (I even had plans to try to get
official permission to start an American College of Heraldry!)  But as most
high school passions, it died when college, wife, job, and kids came along.
It is a joy to hear(read) a heraldic charge once again.  I\'m gonna have to
dig out my old books!! :)

I\'d love to talk to you about SF Heraldry.  I would immagine that the
Imperium, with all the nobles and stuff, would be big on heraldry.  That was
my original reason for the shield.  Personally, I would make the "asteroid
proper" or, while a "full moon proper would be argent (silver?).  Comets
would be or with tails and suns could be a number of colours.

I thought I remembered reading somewhere that the sunbutst was ONLY red.
Now that you mention it, I think it is listed in the MT SMART Library
listing on the Imperial sunburst.  I remember because of the issue with the
IR seeing races.

This is the information I wanted to see.  Its amazing how much information
there is at our fingertips, if we don\'t know something there\'s always
someone on the net who does and is more than willing to tell you.

Not to serious to get in the way much but you\'ll look like hell for a couple
of weeks afterwords.  I kinda figured NASA would have done work on this
subject, it\'s kinda like launching ship and not knowing whether the life
rafts work.

Thank you for the information.

So you\'re saying I should avoid the ancient Japanise starships at all costs. 8)
True, true.  It\'s just not as impressive.  I looked at that picture again
and read some of the stuff, guy at the hobby shop was not impressed 8), the
ship was not only ED but it was also impacted by several high velosity,
10,000+ mps KEP warheads.  Thus explaining the majority of the damage.

Right, that\'s my thoughts.  Maybe I\'m not understanding the concept of
mesons correctly, but isn\'t the idea similar to a bullet in that it
accelerates down the barrel and when it exits the barrel it goes in a
straight line.  Mesons can\'t change directions once they leave the barrel,
can they?  If they can\'t, then the only way to have a useable DMS built into
a planet is to have either a moveable barrel or be able to change the
rotation and axial tilt of your planet.
Am I making sense yet?

asteroids/planets are made up of material that would fragment very easily,
and that a terrorist would be aware that a proper rock selection is imperative!!

I think the red came in from the use of a red sunburst by IG.  Will MM be
changing the "canon?"  Will the Imperial Sunburst be red or yellow?  Stay
tuned nest week for another exciting episode or Traveller the Mailing List.


Does anyone with a fast Web browser know if IG used the sunburst in any of
the pictures they have other than in their emblem?

It kinda bites that in Traveller we Solomani are the only people who have no
redeaming qualities.  We\'re racists, homo supremists, and openly agressive.
I wonder who put those qualities in the UN charter?  8)

Ya I\'m of the opinion that battle dress is one of those "Military Only"

14 psi is for standard atmosphere, what would the effects be for
beings living in atmosphere type 8 or 9?  Or for that matter, what
of beings who come from the atmosphere of large gas giants.  

Or what about a free trader being holed while refueling in the 
atmosphere of a gas giant.

these types of situations.

Cleon I.  One reference states "holographs still extant from the early
years of the Imperium show the banner in the Imperial throne room to
have a yellow sunburst on black, presumably to indicate Sylea\'s G2 star
agains the black of space."  The symbol was declared to have no official
color in 247.  The "modern" IISS (1100s) uses a red sunburst on their
facilities and vehicles, the marines maroon.  The IN still uses yellow.
Imperialized Army units use black.

I tend to prefer less violent adventures, but there\'s a point that we all
reach when we know who did it, but we also know that there\'s no way our
character should know, and you just can find those last two pieces to the
puzzle, after two or three hours of this it\'s enough to turn a saint into rambo.

One of my player\'s, first words out of his mouth every time are.  "We get to
shoot at something today don\'t we?  I need to kill."  It\'s kind of
disturbing, mind you he\'s a self-employed adrenaline junkie, if you can
think of a sport that is highly lethal he\'s involved in it.  He always wears
a t-shirt to my place.

"It\'s not a sport unless you can die from massive internal injuries.  Skydive."

Why?  A legal system can be based on outcome.  It can be based on maintaining
power by some ruling family.  It can be imposed by outside forces.  In it\'s
purest form laws are coercion, a way to try and force others to behave
in a mannor other desire.

In the case of eating cheese while driving in Wisconsin, what value is that law
based on?

Why?  Leitimacy is what is commanly accepted.  If it\'s commanly held
(and accepted) that social standing determains how the legel 
system treats you, than fairness has nothing to do with it.



>In practice, it\'s hard for a dictator to retain power without the form of

  The key words here are "...and asked permission" as long as IG

  Of course, we\'ll never know unless MM and IG really want this bad enough
_to_ ask. (I ain\'t holding my breath)

   DMSes are large facilities (much larger than the majority of smaller
starships) that have HUGE meson guns in them, not too mention extensive
maintenance and C/C facilities for coordinating military activity. It is
likely there won\'t be more than a few of these monsters *in* ;-) any but
the heaviest populated planets.

   Since MGs aren\'t really "popular" before grav tech becomes available,
it\'s likely the whole assembly is floated/stiffened with a CG field,
allowing truly massive structures to be assembled in a gravity well. I\'d
put such a gun in a large spherical chamber (evacuated).

   Basically, poke the nose of your ship into the asteroid, and light the

number of changes from earlier versions, and you\'ll need to re-calculate
your designs.  The changes primarily affect crew size (which should now
be back down to Classic Traveller levels), and minor typo fixes.

Also with respect to crew size, I\'d like to draw everyone\'s attention
to the paragraph on "Small Ships and Combined Jobs".  In addition to
combining fractional crew requirements (into, for example, a
engineer/sensor/communicator crewperson), there are special exceptions for
small ships.

In particular all ships 100 tons and smaller can be operated in routine
circumstances by 1 crewmember (no matter what the crew calculation says),
and all shps 200 tons and smaller may be operated in routine circumstances
by 2 crewmembers (again, no matter what the crew calculation says).

Also, don\'t forget that when all is done with QSDS, you can take a 25%
discount (multiply the final price by 0.75) because of the standardized
construction.  This should help the economic aspects of small trade
starships considerably (a MCr 36 QSDS ship actually costs MCr 27).

Finally, I note that there\'s been some discussion on what the two "Maneuver"
crew are for.  I\'m sorry it wasn\'t explained well, but here\'s the deal: you
need one, a Pilot, if there\'s a maneuver drive installed.  You need another,
the Navigator, if there\'s a jump drive installed.  Thus, a ship with both a
maneuver drive and a jump drive needs a Pilot and a Navigator (Astrogator).

I\'ll be happy to answer other questions about ship design; and I\'m putting
together a Frequently Asked Questions list that I\'ll also put up on by Web
site at some point.

By \'basic game,\' do you mean Classic Traveller, or the starship economics 
rules in the (yet unpublished) Traveller Version 4?  I believe you refer 
to the latter, since it\'s already been established that we can\'t have a 
design system firmly compatible with the CT design systems and with QSDS, 
FF&S Lite, and FF&S itself (which is the basis for the previous two systems).

Economic Viability of commercial starships has been a pet peeve of mine 
for a long time.  With MT, and more so with FF&S, it was hard to build a 
ship with enough hold space to pay for itself.  With this in mind, we 
definitely should NOT re-instate the CT rule of 10% internal space for 
jump fuel per jump number.  With FF&S ships, I found myself tempted to 
install over-capable jump drives (and collapsible fuel bladders) just for 
the sake of jump fuel efficiency.

Here are some potential solutions to the problem:

Make ships less expensive -- mucking about with the cost of opponents 
(rather than other properties, such as weight and volume) doesn\'t affect 
compatablility and canon.  Making lower-numbered jump drives cheaper 
(coupled with another effect, described below) would be one big way of 
reducing the Dreaded Mortgage Payment.  If thrusters are allowed at a 
certain TL (11 or 12, or whatever else is finally decided upon), ships at 
that TL benefit because the volume formerly required for reaction mass 
can be used as hold space, and increase potential income.  To offset 
this, jump drives at lower TLs should be less expensive (probably the J-1 
and J-2 drives).  This makes thruster plates Yet Another Advantage for 
high tech societies, such as the Third Imperium, since ships at this tech 
level and beyond are more economically viable, and trade flourishes (and, 
BTW, this provides yet another impetus for DISCARDING that flimsy "Fusion 
Plus" hook that I hate so much).

Increase Income -- Let\'s face it:  If nobody can make money only charging 
Cr1000 per DISPLACEMENT ton to haul freight, is that rate going to 
stand?  No!  3.27 light years is a heck of a long way to haul fourteen 
cubic meters of anything.  Not being in the cartage business myself, I 
have no contemporary comparisons for how much it costs to haul an 
equivalent volume across a country, or a continent, or an ocean, but 
whoever is charging only Cr1000 to haul 14 m^3 of pocket baby diaper 
steamers an entire parsec is getting gypped.  Of course, the logical 
counterpoint is that excessively high freight rates will discourage 
interstellar commerce because fewer people will be willing to pay them.  
Still, the base freight rate (per displacement ton) should be adjusted 
upward.  Let\'s face it:  Fourteen cubic meters is actually a LOT of 
STUFF.  With a little shoving, I could probably get three of my cars into 
that volume.  Another thing:  Ships that can manage more than one parsec 
between stops should be able to charge extra.  If a J-2 capable Far 
Trader can save the customer two weeks\' time (one in port and one in 
jumpspace), and Cr1000 per ton as opposed to a Free Trader who needs (and 
charges for) two jumps to make the same trip, the Far Trader captain 
should at least be able to tack on a surcharge to the bill.

While I\'m Ranting:  The trade and commerce rules, as presented in MT and 
TNE, needed work.  There are some things (like official documents and 
currency) that, if handled in one-ton lots, wouldn\'t be handled by 
ordinary civilians.  Also, those rules presume that some goods won\'t be 
more valueable than others.  Example:  Since when do weapons have the 
same base price per ton as does mineral ore, or flavored water?  I can 
see where the trade and commerce rules were \'dumbed up\' for the sake of 
simplicity, but they also made it harder to turn a profit, even when 
suffering wild success in the cargo speculation business.

This is exactly how they are described in FF&S.  Though with a  Barrel

I\'m not surprised.  We live in a human sociaty.  And humans are
driven more by emotions than logic.  However, it would make for an
interesting planet in which all laws were controlled by computers.
Police would simply plug the players profile into the computer and

government code would this type of world have?  IE government by

If you look in the RCEG (Reform Coalition Equipment Guide) pages 143-145
there are 10 different modules.  All of these modules were disigned using FF&S.

I\'d been looking through it and had though something was missing on the
materials tables, but I was on the picket line at the time and couldn\'t
refrence to FF&S to see if my brain was right.  I think though the toughness
has been omitted in favour of an easier way of calculating hull armor value.

    'body' => 'I\'ve been skipping over the intertwining threads of rock dropping, 
planetary assaults, and deep meson gun sites because, frankly, I\'m quite 
sick of them.  I\'m now getting about five 30k packets of Traveller-Digest 
in my INBOX, and all they contain is this meta-thread, and desperate 
pleas to stop it.  In the interest of killing at least part of this 
debate, I offer the following squelch:

Neutrino sensors are useless for finding fission and fusion power plants.

Why?  Because these nuclear reactions do not give off a sufficient 
quanitity of neutrinos (of sufficient energy) to be useful in tracking 
their source.  Sure, even DGP\'s "Starship Operator\'s Handbook," which 
even I use as a major sourse of Traveller canon, says that fusion power 
plants shed so many neutrinos that, given a sufficiently powerful plant 
at a close enough range, the configuration of the ship\'s superdense hull 
can be resolved, and the ship type itself determined.  Unfortunately, 
this just plain isn\'t true.

A proton-proton chain (the \'standard\' fusion reaction) gives off 
neutrinos on the lower end of the energy scale as a by-product.  For 
contemporary neutrino detectors, it\'s estimated that an Earth-bound 
sensor will only pick up about one neutrino per day from our own sun.  
Using this baseline, a neutrino sensor can only be expected to pick up 
(on average) 7x10^-21 (that\'s a number with twenty zeros between the 
decimal point and the seven) neutrinos per second per ton of detector per 
watt of the fusion plant.  Given a one-ton detector trying to sniff out a 
100 Mw fusion plant, you can expect a hit about once every 50,000 years.  
Even with a million-ton sensor trying to get a bead on a 100,000 Mw power 
plant, you can pick up a neutrino only about once every 26.3 minutes, 
which is hardly sufficient to be begin building up a sensor track.

Very hot stars have higher energy fusion reactions going on at their 
cores which produce higher-energy neutrinos which are easier to detect, 
but now we\'re talking about temperatures and pressures that occur nowhere 
else, certainly not inside fusion power plants.  Thus, neutrino sensors 
are only really useful as survey instruments to obtain information about 
the internal workings of stars.

The source I used was an article written by Dave Nilsen in Challenge #71 
(on behalf of himself and Frank Chadwick) entitled "Brilliant Lances 
Design Notes."  The source they used for some of the information on neutrino 
sensors was some chap named Kris Miller who was, in their words, "perhaps 
the only Traveller player who works with a real neutrino sensor" that 
they knew of.

What does this mean?  It means that you can\'t use neutrino sensors to 
find deep meson gun sites, and likewise they can\'t use neutrino sensors 
to find attacking starships.  It\'s possible that an attacking force, 
without prior knowledge of the location of the DMSs, can still 
neutralize them by knocking out their sensor nets (active and passive) on 
the ground and in orbit, but leaving the sites themselves intact.  Of 
course, they wouldn\'t want to use any landing zones (or any other 
features or structures) that the defender had previously surveyed and 
marked until they were sure that the deep meson sites had been taken out.

...and now you know why the Terran\'s cleaned the 1st Imperium\'s clock!
<g>

Terrans had meson guns, the Vilani didn\'t.  The Terrans had jump2, the
Vilani didn\'t.  It\'s blitzkrieg time again, faster moving and longer
range against slower and shorter. 

Terran fleet concentrates more quickly than the Vilani can and takes
key planet.  (Maybe by threating it with a *big* rock <g>, but let\'s
say pounding the planet with long range meson guns.) Then the Terrans
quickly install DMSs and move out.  Vilani send in a fleet to recover
the planet, and get chopped to peices by the DMSs while the Terran
fleets are elsewhere taking still other key Vilani planets.

The Vilani can win a pitched space battle (which the Terrans won\'t
fight) through simple numbers, but they can\'t get lost planets back. 
And with it costing fleet after fleet in
impossible attempts to recover planets the Vilani soon don\'t even have
the numbers to win pitched battles.  Now their loses escalate!

Terrans can concentrate and scatter their forces more quickly. They
can bloody a Vilani fleet at range and jump.  They have secure bases
for resupply, while the Vilani\'s bases are only secure if a massive
fleet is sitting there..eventually not even then.

Of course, that\'s not *all* of it, but I rather suspect this is a
bigger part of what happened than spreading diseases or cloning
soldiers.  <g>

I agree with you on this...generally, but not completely.  I can
envision situations where there could be a couple of FTL methods
available, even with the difference as great as "sailing ship vs steam
ship."  Why, for example, are there still jump1 ships when technology
makes jump2,3,4 drives available?  Over time more and more ships will
move to the newer, better technology, but *how much* time will it
take?

On the sail vs steam analogy, the first steam ships were built in the
early 1800\'s and sailing ships competed successfully with them for
nearly 100 years.  In some niches sailing ships still compete with
engine powered ships successfully.

Another possiblity, would be a culture alien to the PC\'s might use
different techs for various things, including FTL.  Maybe eventually
the new culture would adapt to the mainstream (or the mainstream would
adapt to the alien culture\'s technology), but it wouldn\'t happen
overnight.  

Shoot!  If you had a really superior technology would you give it away
to everybody else?  How much would you *charge* somebody for it? 
Would you try to prevent the other folks from developing it for
themselves?  They\'d get it...eventually.

I doubt the early 3rd Imperium is giving Thruster\'s or MrFusion to
anybody!  I rather suspect they would go to extremes to prevent those
technologies from leaking to competing powers...

Given that humans can happily live in type 8/9 (Dense) atmospheres, I
can\'t picture them being much more than 1.5 atms, 2.5 absolute tops. 
Beyond that all kinds of weird physiology starts to come into play -- take
a scuba class to find out more. 

Gas-giant dwellers are an open issue.  Remember that Jupiter (for example)
has a deep upper atmosphere with low pressure, including a wide band of
0.5-2.0 atm pressure which gets nearly all of the sunlight (clouds block
it lower down).  Thus, life "sort of as we know it," relying on
photosynthesis at the base of the food chain, would tend to live in
near-earthlike pressures. 

Arguably, other forms of life might use chemosynthesis further down, in
high-pressure regions; their ships would be built strong to keep such
pressures *in*, and so blowouts would probably be comparably innocuous to
the structure of the ship itself.  The crew, however, would not fare as 
well as humans do under explosive decompression -- they likely *would* 
explode a la "Outland," just as deep-ocean fish due when incautiously 
brought to the surface.

On the GG-refueling question, I can\'t imagine a ship getting deeper than
about 0.2 atm on a refuelling run, and they might stay as high as 0.05 atm
or less.  Remember, the idea is to skim by quickly, then coast up out of
the gravity well (although as I posted a while back, the properties of CG
have a big influence on the details).  If you go too deep, the increased
atmospheric drag brings you to a halt *fast* -- notice how the reentering
Space shuttle sheds most of its orbital velocity between 60 and 20 miles
up, at pressures less than 0.1 atm? 

So, a ship holed while refueling would basically act like one holed in
deep space, to a first approximation.  The overpressure would keep the
GG\'s atmosphere out of the ship until nearly all the ship\'s air had
escaped.  After that, you might have a bit of a fire hazard as H2 mixed
with the remaining O2 on board...but if you haven\'t either patched the
hole or left the GG\'s atmosphere by then, you\'ve probably got bigger
worries than that anyway... :)

Now THAT, as they say...is a horse of a different color! Still most 
ships designed to hold that pressure IN, will be strong enough to 
withstand losing the pressure, but yes, you\'ll get more damage.  
This, too is where you get the Outland style explosive heads ;-)
 
> Or what about a free trader being holed while refueling in the

	Uhhh...besides all the crew dying as they\'re crushed by the 
sudden increase in pressure, or suffocate from trying to breath a mixture of hydrogen 
or helium, or smashing against the bulkheads as the ship careens out 
of control, or, simply fallling (for a loooooong time) as the ship 
breaks up from the suddenly unstable airframe? (I picture something 
like this looking sort of like that crash in the beginning of the 
Six-Million Dollar Man, only worse... ) 

	In truth, I don\'t know, as I\'ve never seen an accurate description 
of exactly HOW a ship skimming fuel works...unless you have scoops 
that cover most of the surface of your ship, you\'ve got to go pretty 
deep in the atmosphere to reach the densities required; you\'ve got to 
cram a whole lot of hydrogen in through some relatively small holes 
in a short period of time...avoiding storms, and clouds of extraneous 
material, etc. etc.

	However, if a ship can take that kind of punishment, that settles 
the old question of how much like a submarine can a starship be.

	Now where can I stick the ICBM tubes in my Free Trader?  ;-)

 I just figured that it would be easier for a lawyer (already knowing a lot
about the subject).  Not being a lwyer myself, I find legal textbooks hard to

In response to Glenn M. Goffin\'s potential offer:

It all sounded terrific, and you\'re right it would be a series of articles.

I think the tack to take would be a quick overview of guiding principles
behind the legal system, including how laws are created, and then some
role-playing nuts-n-bolts about how it would affect the players.  Hitting a
group expecting an American-type with a planet that has an Islamic-type
system would be cruel (ie. fun!).

Some titbits that I\'ve used in my campaign:

Most British common law-based systems depend heavily on precident, but a
French friend tells me that the Code Napoleon does not depend on precident to
the same extent (it\'s used as a guideline, but not actual case law, or
something like that).

Scottish law has a nice verdict: "not proven", giving a judge/jury a third
option between "guilty" and "not guilty".

This sounds really wierd.  Actually, it sounds really stupid -- the

        Exactly what I was thinking; I was planning on doing a blurb on
letters patent companies (I\'ve always thought they were neat; I come from a
jurisdiction where those babies still exist).  In terms of the smaller
corporate forms, I was thinking of writing up the Commenda and the Societas
Navalis (medieval forms of limited partnership, one finetuned for shipping
ventures) and some of their more recent European counterparts, which are
pretty funky corporate beasties.

        What I\'va also been thinking of is how STL would affect securities
markets...  and one conclusion I\'ve come to (purely because the chaos that
can be wreaked is too good to pass up) is that bearer securities would be a
way around the STL roadblock in that they\'re a way to get evidence of share
ownership from place to place when communications are slow.  OTOH, as I\'ve
pointed out, bearer securities can pose problems, which IMHO could make for
great plot hooks.

        It may not flex because of weight, but (if we\'re assuming
gravitational mass and inertial mass are different) it will flex because of
inertia if you try to spin it too fast ...

Crew Detail: 1 Engineer, 2 Electronics, Pilot, Astrogator, 3 Gunners,
	     1 Command, 1 Ship\'s Troop.

	The Corsair, an armed raiding ship, is mostly used by pirates.  
Notable features of the corsair are large cargo doors and variable 
identification features.  The large clamshell doors can open to 
reveal the entire cargo bay.  The ship has several centrally controlled 
identification features which can be used to disguise the ship: radio 
emissions alter frequency and content, and the ship\'s transponders can be 
altered to identify the vessel as having any of a variety of missions and 
identities.
	Based on a 400-ton, wedge-shaped, unstreamlined hull, the ship has 10 
Large Staterooms for use as crew quarters, while the 20 low berths are 
available for emergency use, or to hold captives.  The Avionics 
installed are to military specifications, while the communications gear 
is Improved TL-11.  Nine workstations have been provided, but there is no 
central bridge.
	 The Corsair is not normally available on the open market, as the ship 
is a non-commercial type.

        Nope. It wasn\'t ... just a partial circle with a line trailing

        It\'s built into the tables ... that\'s why there\'s different columns
at different TLs.

Crew Detail (Minimum) : Engineer/Electronics, Pilot/Astrogator.

(Note: The Medic/Steward may be foregone if no passengers are carried.  
The Gunners are optional if the weapons will not be used.)

The Far Trader is based on a 200-ton, box, streamlined hull and has a 10 
ton/hr fuel purification plant.  A variant without the fuel purification 
plant is available with greater cargo capacity (60.8) for a slightly 
lesser price (MCr 63.39 after the standard discount).  In either format, the 
Far Trader contains standard civilian TL-11 avionics and improved TL-11 
communications systems.  There are 8 Large Staterooms available, one of 
which is typically used by the senior individual.  The rest of the crew 
makes use of the four bunks available.

The poni was used as the symbol for the X-boat system, by a historian with
more of a sense of history than comparitive biology.  That was in 624
(Imperial Encyclopedia)

(From The Imperial Encyclopedia, pg 28)

"The symbol of the Third Imperium established by Cleon (the first emperor)
when the empire was proclaimed.  Images show him standing before the
original banner with a golden yellow sunburst against a black background,
representing Capital\'s type G star against dark space."

"In 247, the Eliyoh (a nonhuman minor race) joined the Imperium.  To that
race the symbology was unimpressive.  The Eliyoh vision centerd in the far
infrared, which resulted in distinction between the offcial colors of black
and yellow being impossible.  So the Empress Poriria declared that the
symbol would have no offcial color."

The original banner in the Imperial throne room is still black with a yellow
sunburst.  The IISS uses a red sunburst.  the Imperial Navy, yellow; the
Imperial Army, black; the Imperial Marines, maroon."

That\'s the canon, anyway.

It was in DGP\'s "World Builder\'s Handbook" first.  Since the canon has the
ponii symbol being used for the X-boat system, and not adopted until after
the civil war, I was proposing the *original* symbol.

I think my full sized Wagoneer is pretty damn near 1 displacment ton :-)
And it\'s over 2 tonnes :-)

Gives me a sense of scale on smaller ships/vehicles in traveller.  My
jeep is *big*, and unfortunately it uses enough fuel that HEPlaR fuel
use didn\'t even make me blink.  I bet a Suburban is 2tons...

Your other points are well taken.

This is an important difference.  Trademark is a symbol or motto that is
used to identify your company/product.  (example:  Coca-Cola (tm), "Where\'s
the Beef?" (tm) by Wendy\'s.

The important thin with trademarks, is that they are not universal, and must
be defended.

"Illuminati Press", and used an Eye/Pyramid scheme for my logo, SJG wouldn\'t

So when the "coolent regulator" breaks down while in Jump Space and
you\'ll all roast to death in hours you don\'t need anybody aboard that
can fix it?  When those pesky Pirates blow a hole in your hull
wreaking your jump coil, you don\'t need an Engineer to jury-rig a
temporary for that emergency jump?  When your overworked
pilot/astrogator misjumps because she skipped the last 3 engine
maintanace checks, you didn\'t need an Engineer?

I don\'t agree, Hans and Chewy not withstanding.  <g> Then again wasn\'t
Chewy the MF\'s engineer?

You really need at least a crew of 2 for ships above 100tons, ie
starships.  I say you can fly with one, but it\'s dangerous, stressful
and tiring.  With 2, both should be able to fly it, fight it, and fix
it.  With 3 you can specialize a little.  With more you can specialize
more.  But IAC, *somebody* aboard should always have some engineering
skill!

There are a few states in the US (Gulf South mostly, Louisiana in

That\'s what I\'d been led to understand about it as well...

I wonder if this would be somewhat akin to "no contest", a 3rd plea

The Terran Confederation symbol was also featured in the board game

I agree with this part, but red might look better than yellow on the 
front cover of a book.  Bright yellows tend to wash out as ink 
colors...

Suppose that MM could lose the yellow, keep the red as long as he 
saves the mythos, but that\'s his call.

This is what I suspected as well...  Frankly, the red sunburst looks 
better than a yellow would anyways, at least on a printed page.  
Bright Yellows (and who wants a dull yellow sunburst) have a tendency 
to look washed out in inks...

I guess this is 1 for Marc to decide

I\'ve been on the pages several times over the last few weeks.  If 
there\'s a sunburst there (other than the use in the logos), I haven\'t 
seen one.

Highly unlikely that SJG would allow this...especially since this is 
part of their corporate logo.  Trademarks and copyrights have a 
tendency to go away if not vigorously defended.  In college, I 
studied an old case involving Xerox.  They lost a case to a 
competitor (whose name escapes me at the moment).  They sued the competitor 
for the use of their brand name (Xerox) in sales literature.  Unfortunately, 
the court that heard the case ruled that since \'xerox\' was now a commonly 
accepted and used word, Xerox no longer held a valid copyright on the 
word \'xerox\'.  The same sort of thing has happened with trademarks in 
the past as well.

See Grand Census, inside back cover, for IISS Survey Uniform.  

The xboat branch\'s symbol was developed early in the canon:
"The xboat service emblem (above) was taken from a history of Terra by
Professor Dinimbue of the University of Sylea.  The professor found records
of an organization called the Pony Express, but her knowledge of old anglic
was not complete enough to equate the word pony with the Terran horse.  The
professor translated the word as ponii, a beast of burden used on several
worlds of the Sylean Federation.  When the xboat service was organized, the
emblem was designed, even though by then the professor\'s mistake had been
discovered."

>2. The Imperal Senate : Imperial Gold Sunburst with a sword and fascii 

This is good history question.  We know that by 1116, the Imperial
government consists of the Emperor, the Moot, and the Bureaucracy.  The
Emperor is the emporer -- apparently a benevolent autocrat.  The Moot
consists of all of the Imperial nobility.  The Bureaucracy is not a
constitutionally recognized branch of the government, but has enormous power
and actually runs the Imperium, implementing Imperial edicts and
promulgating regulations as needed to do so.

So, was there ever an Imperial Senate?  What happened to it?

>5. Imperial Marines : A rising Sunburst, with crossed sword and starship 

The Imperial Marines just use an Imperial sunburst in distinctive colors (I

Another great plot hook would be the arrival and dispatch of timely 
information.  The fact that good or bad news might travel faster for 
a megacorp (with bigger resources) as opposed to Joe\'s Mining 
Company, is probably something that would give the Megacorps (who 
could hire faster ships at will) an edge in a lot of instances.  A 
guy with a fast ship in the right place at the right time could make 
a killing off a little company...

Your ideas on bearer securities are great...  I can see adventure 
ideas forming in my head as we speak...

Just a quick question here - does anyone know
what the trading rules are going to be in MMT?

The original CT rules I felt had a lot going for
them, but I could never get on with the idea that
you always buy at 4000 Cr/ton (+/- modifiers) and
sell at 5000 Cr/ton (+/- modifiers), regardless
of what the actual goods were, that was universally
used in the later rules. Surely this is just like 
carrying freight? i.e. you are being paid a rate
for tonnage, modified slightly for the planet type,
rather than buying and selling different types
of goods.

I for one would be interested in a system that had
more of the feel of the original (but not necessarily
the same system!), to give more of that \'speculative\'
feel to the trading.

back to lurking...

Sounds like *damn* poor design to me.

Just like ships are divided into sections and have watertight doors
between them, a spacegoing vessel will have pressure bulkheads and
airtight doors. During combat, you close the doors. And if a section
gets opened to space, the interior bulkheads aren\'t like to go, the
non-airtight doors will go first.

Controls that get damaged by exposure to vacuum will be no more likely
than ones that get damaged by water would be on a ship. 

Some vessels may even make a point of putting the crew into suits and
pumping all the air into storage when they go into battle.

Consider that you can have a cheap, dumb sensor as part of the power
and comm linkup at every single structure on the planet. An individual
sensor won\'t tell you much. But integrate the readings from it with the
reading from the other 50 million on that hemisphere and you\'ve got
some *good* targeting info. (in effect, you\'ve covered the planet with
a synthetic aperture array!)

And since it makes sense to have most fixed point comm traffic carried
over fiber optics (or whatever replaces them), it\'ll be next to
impossible to tap into the sensor feeds. Especially if the comm network
is configured like the Internet rather than the telephone system.

Short of going down an disconnecting 99% of those sensors, you aren\'t
going to do much to the sensor web. :-)

It\'s possible to use spread-spectrum type tricks to make it hard to
tell the difference between active EMS, and static, or at least normal
"glitches". 

You basicly send the pulses at "random" intervals, and check for echoes
that match the "random" sequence. You can even have succesive pulses at
different frequencies. So, was that a ranging pulse, or just a glitch
at a transmitter?

They pick a body that already *has* enough "ice" on it. So they are
refueling from the rock.

The pulse is gonna be *damn* weak at 1000 AU! And you aren\'t going to
get much parallax on it. So is it a small ship emerging 1000 AU out, a
big ship a lot farther out, a *huge* ship a parsec out? Or maybe just a
supernova in another part of the galaxy.

Nothing else is gonna be terribly detectable by any *reasonable* sensor
system. Remember, you\'d have to scan the entire sphere to a ridiculous
resolution level.

The gamma isn\'t going to be all that strong at first. Between distance
and low speed, you won\'t detect it until fairly late.

If the "rock" has the average density of water, it\'ll have a diameter
of about 267 meters. If it has a density of 8 (nickel iron, plus a
bit) it\'ll have a diameter of about 134 meters.

Good reason to stay "behind" the rock, and to stay in its "wake" while

Oh? Consider that the ship has to reach an "intercept" position while
the rock is in range. That makes the area that the interceptor can
start from a rather narrow cone, centered on the course of the rock,
and with the wide end at the planet.

I\'m not sure whether you are planning on trying to break up the "rock"
or to deflect it. 

I wouldn\'t want to be the guy responsible for an attempt to break it
up. Assuming you get the missile/ship/whatever in the path of the rock
in time, you have to hope that *all* the pieces spread out far enough
to miss the planet.

If you are trying to deflect it, it\'ll have to be by hoping that
surface blasts will cause a thrust to deflect it. That\'s kinda iffy.
Odds are that you\'d *break* the rocks instead.

So I can\'t really see what you intend as a defense. Remember, this is a
*small* target.

The problem *is* that we have to explain how manuever drives work. At
least to the extent of "you dump in this much energy and gain that much
velocity".  And that *alone* is enough to cause the problems. We
*can\'t* have any less detail, because then we can\'t tell how fast the
ship can accelerate, or for how long, both of which are frequently

To be capable of interplanetary travel, you need to be able to reach
30-50 km/s. Which means that even a 100 ton scout is equivalent to a
small-to-medium sized nuke.

"Unlimited" acceleration is never possible. But a ship that can use the
drive continuously for a month is ok, though hard to justify. At 6g, I
about 9.8e13 meters covered (assuming 15 days of accel followed by 15
days of decel). And 25% of lightspeed at turnover. :-)

Realisticly, a ship shouldn\'t *need* that much delta-vee. To travel 50
AU (well beyond Pluto), it only takes a bit over 8 days at 6gs. And you
only get up to 7% of c.

Actually, if a planet is completely unprotected, you can drop a *big*
rock on it at "normal" in-system velocities (say 30 km/s). Just nudge a
body a few km in diameter at the right time. That\'s all it takes for a
dinosaur killer.

It may take a lot of nudges, but you\'ve got time. And nobody will be
able to tell that it wasn\'t a natural disaster.

On the whole, I think the best bet for now is to work up tables for the
hazard at various velocities. That\'ll discourage really high speeds.

As I understand it, they took the guns *apart* and carried them piece
by piece! I do know that on the Ho Chi Minh trail, the load for a
bicyle (think of an old Schwinn or the like) was around a *ton*.

Depends. If you are the "good guys" you try to track down the
responsible parties. If you are the "bad guys", you take hotages and
execute them the next time something happens.

Besides, given the sort of weaponry a jump trooper is packing, *they*
may shoot back!

I listened to my roomies playing (I wasn\'t crazy enough to play with
them). One time one of them used a FGMP in a back alley. Then he had to
have the GM explain to him that the police tend to notice such things. 

Aside from the *glare* (it was night), there\'s the EM noise, and the
"sound effects". Every cop in a couple of *miles* is going to know.

They also found out that on planets where you can carry around an FGMP
without getting stopped, the police tend to respond with things like
APCs and light grav tanks.

Do realize that a chunk of rock (or nickel iron) can absorb one *hell*
of a lot more damage than a ship. There are no "critical hits". Nor is
there any "interior". Instead, you have to consider it to be a solid
slab of armor.

For the sillier folks out there, there was a posting to the Star Trek
groups (years back) that had the Enterprise visting a planet giving odd
sensor readings. Turned out that it was inhabited by Wile. E. Coyote
and the Roadrunner. The consequences were "interesting". 

Just the thing for a silly, throwaway adventure ("it was all a dream")
to give the players relief from an overly serious campaign.

Mission:
The Ajax Frigate is designed to "show the flag" and discourage piracy. As a 
representative of Imperial might, it can patrol systems where wending a 
cruiser would be uneconomical and/or overkill.
However, it should be more than capable of seeing off a corsair or two with 
its particle accelerator and missile barbettes, whilst defending with 
sandcasters & laser turrets.  It is not  designed to fight larger craft, so 
no meson screen is fitted.

It provides extra fighter support in fleet actions and always operates with 
escorts to shield it from enemy craft.

What if the "coolant regulator" breaks down on your car in the
middle of nowhere? (Or, as my friends did, in the middle of downtown
Toronto, at midnight...) You don\'t need an engineer to fix _every_
emergency. Anyone with mechanical, electronic, robotic, gravitic,
engineering, etc-1 should do.

As for pirates, if they blow a hole in your hull, then you\'ll
probably be captured or killed, or both. When you\'re dead, 
thinghs like jump coils just don\'t matter like they used to.

Now, if your pilot skips 3 engine checks at starport and then misjumps,
well, big surprise. I think the low crew numbers are based
on the analogy that you run your starship like a car - you take
it in for service regularly and you don\'t do anything
stupid like jump from 10 diameters or ram a local SDB.

Well, I think that ifyou run a ship with 1 or 2 hands, they have to
be jack-of-all-trades, to a certain extent. Look at the kinds
of skills your typical scouts has - pilot-1,navig-1 engineer-1, etc.
He can do it all, to an extent.

Also, the MF was _heavily_ modified. Stock ships should be almost
self-maintaining, with the occasional checkup.

Well, it\'s only stressful when you\'re not in jump. Seriously,
I\'d expect that automation would make piloting a Type S ship
no more stressful than driving a Ford Taurus. Auto ignition,
auto transmssion, ABS, etc.It\'s a long way from a Model T.

Hello all!  It\'s me, Cynthia Higginbotham, former owner of 
New Home and various other worlds... 
 
I finally resuscribed to the TML after falling off it for no 
explicable reason... When did this go fully automated? I\'m way 
behind, so a few questions... 
 
1) What is QSDS?  Where does one find it?  
   **Never mind, I just saw Wildstar\'s notice.  Hi, Guy! 
 
2) MMT? 
 
3) We\'re *still* discussing Rock-Dropping?  ARRGGGGHHHH! 
   (TML "thread that never dies" #1...) 
 
4) Economics are still broken, it sounds like. Hello? 
   Has anyone figured out that the old CT prices were presuming 
   Imperial price controls?  Without Imperial enforcement of  
   an artificial interstellar economy, those prices are meaningless. 
   Campaigns not based in the Imperium should use different rules 
   based on real-world economics. 
 
5) Planetary Meson guns (TML "thread that never dies" #2). In both 
   HG and FF&S, those are SHORT-RANGE weapons.  An attacker can 
   sterilize the surface of your planet with long-range nuclear 
   missiles without ever getting into range... or surgically remove 
   your starports and military bases.  And, huge Asteroid Defense Lasers 
   (designed in FF&S) have longer range, do more damage at less cost 
   in money and input energy, and give you something to use on thrown 
   Rocks and invasion fleets. 
 
6) I see lots of suggestions for articles and supplements for T4. 
   Is there a "house magazine" or something like that in the works, 
   yet?  i.e., where will support materials be published?   
   Bring back JOTAS! 
 
7) If all this including CT stuff is going on *here*, what\'s on 
   the Xboat TML?

Or worse yet, the guys they\'re attacking are also carrying FGMP\'s, 
and wearing Battle Dress...

I didn\'t say engineering skills were not needed by the crew.  You don\'t need
a dedicated engineer on the flight.  Also, once the ship is in jump, there
doesnt have to be any one sitting at the controls.  Traders and other small
vessels are going to be a) maintained by the Captain/First Mate or b) the
Company during dock visits.  TWA doesn\'t pack an engineer on board their
747\'s.  They are maintained between flights.  NASA doesn\'t maintain an
engineer on board either.  The flight crew of two (Pilot and Commander) and
the passangers (Mission Specialists) are capapble of making in flight
repairs if possible.

It goes beyond that analogy but to Sci-Fi in general.  Go read the
Foundation Series.  Particularly the section on the Free Traders.  Typically
one person runs the whole ship.  "The Day the Earth Stood Still (very
classic Sci-Fi) " had a crew of one on the alien ship.

Now to Traveller, your Captain or First Mate spends time in port making
repairs and doing routine maintanence.  In fact, many Star Ports probably
require some type of check out before they let a passanger carring vessel
leave.  They spend a few hours in flight dodging astroids and pirates and
the make jump.  The crew then has 6 days to work on keeping things going,
stewarding the passangers, etc.

Chewy was the First Mate.  Both Hans and Chewy did repairs, both flew the
ship, etc.

Agreed here.  Someone onboard should at least be an Engineering-1.  But I
don\'t agree about the requirements.  A type S scout should be able to be
flown by 1 person as should a 200 T free trader.  You need someone for
companionship and to help out.  Anything under 500T should be handleable by
2 crew just fine.  The more the better, but the term "requirements" = "minimum".

I don\'t recall saying you could destroy it.  I said you could hit it. 8) 
 This is kind of like going after a dinosaur with a meat tendorizor.  
Sure you can hit it but are you going to do anything to it?  Maybe, 
seeing as meson\'s explode withing the target, they would count as a 
tamped explosion, and this is the same principle we use for mining, 
detonating an explosive inside a rock.  It might work, you never know, 
but now you\'ve got ten-thousand rocks coming at your planet not one.

Quite a long time ago, actually...  I\'ve been on the mailing list 
since early 1995.  It was automated when I got here...

> 2) MMT? 

The unofficial name for the soon to be released 4th edition of 
Traveller Rules.  The real nickname is T4.  Stands for \'Marc Miller\'s 
Traveller\'.

Even Marc uses T4 though, so MMT is a misnomer...

Not me...  My filter automatically deletes anything with rock in the 
subject line...of course this prevents me from receiving posts about 
Rock Hudson, the movie "The Rock", but I figure its a small price to 
pay... ;-)

Gotta agree here.  CT\'s economics rules need to be tweaked, if not 
chucked and replaced entirely...  Although for the next edition of 
Traveller, the Imperium is back...  The first set of specific 
sourcebooks are going to be set in Year Zero, I.E.

Already happening.  Issue #25 (they\'re starting out where the old 
JTAS\'s left off) is due out in August.  It will be a bimonthly 
magazine.  Check out Imperium Games web page for more details...

Not a whole heck of a lot anymore...lots of crossposts, but not much 
else...  

A REALLY disgruntled CT user signed off last week because FF&S (and 
its simpler variations) are going to be the design system for T4, but flamed 
us before going.  Since then, things have probably been the most harmonious 
between TNE & CT/MT grognards that I\'ve ever seen in the 1-1/2 years I\'ve been 
subscribing to the list. 

Ya\'ll ought to be proud of yourselves for that, BTW... ;-)

We got involved with a SAG raid on "Janie," operation "Idaho Rampant."  
Don\'t ask me I don\'t make them up.  Our party, "Task Group Pawnee" had to 
recover the FDR from a downed spy plane.  It had crashed in mountianous 
territory that was inhabited by two local rebel forces, and the Defensive 
units of the country that owned the territory.

You\'ve never seen such an impressive display of fire works, and we didn\'t 
make most of them, we were just bugging out of the crash site when the 
insurgents came upon it.  Never overestimate the slowing power of booby 
traps.  It\'s amazing how quickly a persuing force slows down when they 
find one booby trap.  Hell half a spool of det cord and some demo tape 
work just a well, it\'s all psychology.

I\'ve never been terribly big on carrying lots of weapons, I use two for 
military missions, one of which is a pistol, but some of my buddies were 
packing heat.  Three/four weapons each, they needed a golf bag just to 
organize the weapons they brough to the party.

You know if you sit and look at it one DT is really not all that big, 
comparatively.  A suburban is pretty close to two tons, but an airraft 
comes in at three, this seems inordinatly large, espically when a grav 
bike comes in at .5 a DT, that\'s 7 cubic meters for a motorcycle.  I 
think what the problem is, is that a number of the internal components 
are to large and this has created slightly oversized vehicals

Of course, 747\'s aren\'t in the air for a week at a time, either...but 
no.  As long as you had somebody on board with engineering skills, 
under routine circumstances you wouldn\'t need 1.  God help your ship

How many passengers are going to be able to make flight repairs.  I 
wouldn\'t trust an unskilled person to patch a hull breach, let alone 
work on something as delicate as engines...

Yep, I can just see it.  Elvish Parsley, the performer, booking

Actually, your captain usually spends a large part of his week 
negotiating for the sale and purchase of cargo.  Not likely to have a 
whole lot of time to even get near the drives.

What crew...  You just said that 1-2 people run the ship...  The crew 
is going to have its handsful stewarding the passengers (in shifts, since 
they can\'t stay awake 24 hours).  You\'re contradicting yourself here  
a bit, Rob...

Point taken...but I\'m not sure I\'d want to fly on a ship as a passenger 
that didn\'t have a guy to man the guns, work the engines, etc...

The rules need to reflect the negative effects of having a skeletal 
crew in terms of how easy it would be to attract passengers, etc...

Actually the sunburst on the cover of the Regency stuff for TNE are both 
yellow.  They\'re done as a metalic yellow, ie. they look like they\'re 
gold, and they look pretty good.

It isn\'t to the best of my knowledge.  I think that all the pictures used 
on the site are super generic, except the Elmore pic that is, so none of 
them were painted with T4 in mind.

Could I request RTF or Works word processor format, and Works spreadsheet 
formats?  I have Works 3 (for Win 3.1 but I use Win95), and I can\'t as yet 
afford Excel or Office, especially just to play Traveller.  Works does a 
very bad job of converting Excel sheets; almost every other field generates 
an error, and the sheet is useless.

I think it would be a good idea to have the files available in every format 
you can get your apps to save to, just to be friendly.

OK, I get it now, when you said "think planet, I was thinking "planet =
stationary" not "planet = many kilometes of depth to use."  I guess you
could (using CG) dig out a sphere, and put the gun in it and use CG to
"create" down in any direction you wanted to fire anywhere, right?  The
length of the barrel would be dictated by how much support you could give it.

Has anyone figured out how much stress this would put on a typical hull

would do a bit of damage to the hull moving that much mass.

Those numbers are based on current neutrino detectors - giant tanks of 
(insert substance here) hoping for a neutrino to hit and interact with an
atom of (insert substance here) through the weak interaction, which has, as
noted, incredibly low cross-sections. 

Traveller neutrino detectors don\'t have to work this way. Traveller technology
includes that favourite D.E.M., the nuclear damper, with its ability to
magically mainpulate the strong and weak nuclear forces. One could easily
imagine that among the many uses for such a capability is increasing the
cross-section for neturino interactions, making neutrino sensors much more
practical. Since we\'re making up numbers, we can make them as practical or
impractical as game physics dictates - I\'d personally make them marginally
useful for detecting fusion power plants at ranges of a few kilometers - but
we certainly don\'t need to be bound by what the 20th century can do.

   I would say that would be a good guess. Traveller physiscists seem
to have a good grasp of the nuclear forces, and MGs come out about the
time dampers and grav tech emerge so it wouldn\'t be unreasonable to
assume.

   This could explain how Traveller MG\'s are relatively non-interactive
with matter, compared to what we expect.

   This also gives a good way to explain how MGs get better at higher
tech levels. Early MGs are "sloppy" with poor control, so they waste a
lot of power and aren\'t as good at doing damage. Later versions keep the
decay rates within narrower parameters, are more efficient at generating
yield, and are less affected by matter.

   Early MG\'s would also be easier to track because of the meson
"droppings".

I hate to break it to the anti-"rock throwing" crowd, but this "problem"
has been known of since classic Traveller days.  The Imperial Navy even
has a name for it: "deadfall bombardment".  

CruRons are tasked as orbital support for the bombardment phase, and
have attached to them a munitions replenishment vessel and a "deadfall
ordnance carrier" which would collect rocks from local moons and 
planetoid belts for this sort of thing.  (This is all from the old JTAS
article "Battle Fleets of the Marches".  It glossed over just how nasty
deadfall ordnance can be.)  High Guard also refers to using empty bays
to carry this sort of weapon (in the ship design section).

Presumably, one reason why this sort of weapon might be used instead of
nuclear weapons is due to the development of nuclear dampers.

...and at the time, Efate suffered from an active insurrection by the Ine
Givar which caused the Imperium to impose martial law on the world.  Not
a great situation for the Imperium.

The Zhodani even tried deadfall bombardment attacks on Efate.  They tried 
to sneak a captured _Broadsword_ through the defenses and crash it into 
the main Imperial garrison with a vector of about 30 km/s.  The plan was
to jump it into system under computer-controlled Auto/Evade, and use naval
units to engage the defenses in a pitched battle on the other side of the
world.  This was the amber zone adventure "A Dagger at Efate" in an old
JTAS.  It probably fails -- system control spots it stepping out of jump
space immediately, and dispatches the PCs to investigate.  (My vector
estimate comes from the knowlege that the safe jump distance from Efate
is 3.2 light-seconds, and from the time limit set in the adventure.) 

Rough estimates of the effect of the impact:
  Assume that a _Broadsword_ masses about 8000 metric tonnes.
  Assume surface gravity, Efate, is about 0.75 G (crater figures).

According to the equations in the sci.space.science FAQ, the ship will
strike with an energy of 860 kT, digging a crater 640 meters in diameter.
5 psi overpressure to 6.6 km (high enough to cause total destruction to 
urban areas).  Third degree burns to 11 km.  Impact was eight hours after
jump breakout.  The damage estimates are based on some figures for the 
effects of nuclear weapons.  

Let\'s change the scenario.  Instead of sneaking in, the Zhodani thrust
at 3 gee the whole way in from jump breakout.  Initial velocity is still
30 km/s.  Breakout is at 3.2 light-seconds.  Now they burn 15 G-turns to 
impact after a bit over two and a half hours.  Impact velocity is about
290 km/s (0.001 c).  Impact energy is 80 MT.  Crater diameter adjusted 
for Efate is about 2000 meters.  5 psi overpressure to 30 km.  Third 
degree burns to 70 km.

It is supposed to be tough to make it.  I don\'t mind that.  I mind it when
it becomes impossible.  With the later design sequences, it appears that
they were more and more designed to be scientifically accurate with out
regards for the fact that they were part of a game.  How would Monopoly work
if in the 437th printing you started getting $2000 per rail road because
rail roads have to be like real life.  Forget the rest of the game, trains

I don\'t mind the 10% jump fuel.  It keeps most ships down to J1 and J2 which
is a game balance thing.  J4-6 should pretty much be Military Spec only.
Don\'t know too many commerical air liners powered by a Pratt and Whitney

This is a good option.  With the latest QSDS release (1.1) prices for ships
are reasonable.  I built a Free Trader last night, with a few extra\'s for
less than the Book 2 Free Trader.

There are a few specific things that need to be addressed here:

    Standard Cargo: 1000Cr / Ton
    This is competion here.  The game needs to allow some flexability in 
    charged rates.  People are going to go with the lowest cost shipper in
    most cases.  And people should be prepared to pay more to get it there
    quicker.  But you have to remember, in the grand scale of Trade and
    Commerce, that you, Mr. Free Trader, are picking up the special cargos
    and left overs.  The Big lines who can do jump-3 or jump-4 have gotten
    the high speed delivery contracts, and large bulk shipments.  There could
    be a traders union which kinda requires people to keep prices somewhat
    consistant.  I would like to see this addressed and include some rules
    for varying the rates based on speed, and such.  We will have to wait and
    see.  Most of this goes for passangers as well.

    Speculative Trading:
    This has been broken since Book 7 The Merchant Prince.  I cannot fathom
    a ton of computers and a ton of wheat costing the same.  CT\'s trading  
    system was cool, but it needed to be extended to include a lot more cargo
    types.  36 Cargos was not a lot.  I felt that the new rules were generic
    and felt cold.  My players never wanted a part of trading again.  That
    chance to get Gem Stones in route to a rich world would drive them bonkers
    but to pickup Cargo X at Cr4000 that will have a +3 on the die roll at a 
    Rich world just wasn\'t the same.

So I await T4.  I will accept whatever Trade Rules are there, but we can
dream that they have been fleshed out.

It appears to me that the Moot is what\'s left of the Sylean Grand Senate.
The Senate has representatives of all the Imperial worlds, has the power
to dissolve the Imperium, advises the Emperor on legislation, and has the
power to confirm Imperial successors.  I\'m sure we\'ll find out one way or
another soon, but my suspicion is that the Senate re-structured itself
into a more "General Assembly" style Moot when they made President Zhunastu
the Emperor.

Actually, the bureaucracy is a perfectly recognized part of the government.
It\'s all the executive ministries under the Emperor.  Whether or not the
Imperium as a whole has an actual constitution is unknown.

   The point is, they\'d get a clue something\'s up. Vector a ship in the

   Leonard, I\'m disspointed in you.

   You\'re a ship Captain, you\'ve just got word from PD that a frac-cee
weapon is on it\'s way. You are in a position to *intercept* the course of
the rock, your FAMILY is on the planet, your HOME TOWN is on the planet.
Do I have to get any clearer than that?? <g>

   I calculate the impact energy at about 1.8e21 J - should be enough to
vape the rock. (Assuming 6G and a 400td [4000mt] PC) 

   I imagine the crew would offload before heading out, leaving a skeleton
volunteer crew to leave on the Cutter/Pinnace/LB after they\'re close
enough to guarantee a hit.

The IISS logo first showed up in JTAS.  It was in JTAS 5 or JTAS 6 probably
(I confimred it in Best of JTAS vol 2, (selected articles from JTAS 5-8)).
This was written by Marc Miller and Loren Wiseman and was published a long
time before DGP\'s World Builders Handbook.

See my earlier post about magneto/gravitic lenses for this beast. You 
would either need that or you would have to have the emplacement in a 
spherical room on a gimbles (free to point in any direction). This is 
simpler than the lenses. Even simpler still would be to put the DMG on a 
rotating platform like a carousel but then you would have to wait until 
the planet is in the right position to fire and this could be up to 24 
hours. Of course you could cut this time by having multiple DMGs.

This is correct. You could use the planets rotation to help point the 
meson gun but wouldn\'t it be better to just have some sort of a big 
magnetic (for charged mesons) or gravitic lens to aim the charge at the 
the end of the accelerator barrel. I don\'t know what cannon is on these 
meson guns and my physics geek friend doesn\'t get here for another two 
months so if this question is stupid send me a private e-mail to get up 
to speed.

You\'re not attempting to blow up the rock, that\'s good for the 
terrorists. You\'re attempting to blow up the Free Trader or Scout ship 
towing the rock before it gets up to a significant velocity. The DMG is 
of no use towards this though because it cannot reach out to 100AU or so 
to hit the terrorists where they are accellerating the rock.

   Well, first off your thrust doesn\'t increase, so the hull should handle
it. (Your G drops as the combined mass of rock and ship) Secondly, a
terrorist ship wouldn\'t necessarily CARE about damage to the ship. "Just
close the for\'d bulkhead hatch so we can keep breathing, Mike"

   My Patrol Ships are all close configuration, and designed to push rocks
so damage isn\'t a concern there.

I agree.  Whatever the ship design system looks like in the game, it 
must work with the economic system, and with the combat system.  Just 
being able to work 1, but not the other, won\'t cut it.

A better system than a standard Cr 1000 ton would be to base not only 
quantity of freight, but shipping cost on starport class.  For 
example, a guy looking to ship his cargo from a starport E, where 3-4 
ships might land in a week, is going to be willing to pay a higher 
rate per ton than a guy who is shipping the same stuff from a 
starport A, where the ships are too numerous to count.  An ideal 
system might use a matrix, cross-indexing destination port with 
source port, and come up with a base number that could then be rolled 
by a random multiplier...

Yup, a ton of wheat does not equal a ton of 28.8 modems, to use a 
present day example...

I play with MT rules, but still find myself using the old CT cargo 
system, which was much better than the generic Merchant Prince rules, 
which were the basis for MT & TNE.

Maybe we ought to work on a better set of trade and cargo rules...

If somebody wants to throw some ideas my way, I\'d be happy to put 
something in writing...  I have my own ideas, but let me know what 
somebody else might want...

So do I...

In my very early days as a Traveller referee, I had a guy who tended 
to think that NPC\'s were put on Earth for 1 reason, and 1 reason 
only...  Target Practice...

The good news is that the rest of the party was much more rational 
than he was and detested him.  Quite often he\'d get the party 
involved in a fight, only to watch the rest of the party back away, 
as though they had no idea who he was.  Then he\'d wind up fighting 5 
people by himself (or rather getting killed by 5 people)... 

Sometimes, they\'d actively plot ways to kill him..

I laughed at this because I know the type...

Thanks for the impulse figures, they make it much easier to figure out 
what the effects of these drives is going to be. I wouldn\'t want to 
release 86 TeraWatts of heat energy into the biosphere of a planet as a 
regular part of day-to-day business though. That kind of heat would be 
very difficult to remove.

The way I ran my campaign the captain would use gravitic generators to lift 
the ship out of the atmosphere (if any) and then the fusion drive to push 
the ship around in system. There was no speed limit but what fuel you 
could carry so there was nothing keeping the captain of a 200 tonne free 
trader from picking up a 10 tonne rock in the asteroid belt and lobbing 
it at the surface of the mainworld (pushing it out of the cargo hold just 
in time of course.)

This is a terrible amount of power for player characters to have but _it 
could not be avoided_ without resorting to Bugs Bunny physics. I kept the 
rule in place and let the players know that these antics would not be 
allowed by frequent encounters with Close escorts and such.

Nope, I was intertwining the lifeboat at 0.1c thread with the baseballs at
30km/s thread. To drop an asteriod on a city would be the work of a
madman. To drop 1000 baseballs on a field of grav tanks is the work of a
simple navy gunner.  BTW I was wrong here too. pretty much anything moving
at 0.1 c will make it to the surface all the way through the atmosphere.

Oh gawd, no, the world of the future will be a wonderful place and we 
will have eliminated poverty, hunger, and all the other inefficiencies of 
that any human economy would have by simply saying "make it so". 

Seriously thank goodness for one other person who things that the star

Thats a good idea except for:

a) Its probably too late, but it might make a supplement or JTAS article.

b) We haven\'t been asked to input on that yet :-)

So with that aside:

There are three parts to the trade system, freight (includes passangers),
trading, and charters.  Charters may be best left to role playing, but if
the system gives the new GM a starting point, it would be benificial.

Freight:
   Strengths:
       Simple
       Factors in TL, population, and danger codes (Amber, Red)
       Factors in special handling.
       
   Weaknesses:
       Brainless (this is a good thing and a bad thing)
       Does not factor in distances, or trade codes.  A Barren world is
          less likely to attract passangers and a rich world is going to attract
          more.
       Does not factor in Starport Quality.
       Others?

Trading:
   Need to expand the CT Trading columns.  Factor in more planetary trade
codes. 
   CT only used six of the 10 or so.  I think we should include things like
   Sector and sub-sector capitals, research stations as affecting some goods,
   in particular information.

  },
  {
    'body' => 'I\'ve used a modified set of Book 2 trade rules for years.  I sent the full
version off to IG (and haven\'t heard back yet), but here is a summary:

TRADE TABLES

Every planet has unique trade tables, just as every planet has unique animal
encounter tables.  These look like those in CT Book 2, except that:

a) There is a base cost (for buying) and a base price (for selling).  
b) There are no purchase DMs (figured into the base cost already).
c) Referee adds names (just as for animals).
d) Goods also have a \'volatility factor\' (see below)


BUYING

Players must first find a \'good deal\'.  This is a task:

To find a good trade deal:
<difficulty>.  Trader, Streetwise. 6 hours.
Referee: Difficulty is based on planetary population (Lo=Difficult,
Mod=Routine, Hi=Simple).  Use standard rules for retries (ie harder unless
you wait or have JoT).

Players should role-play the purchase.  Roll on the purchase table as usual,
but modify with (a) how well they role-played and (b) their Bargaining skill.


SELLING

Players must find a buyer.  This is a task:

To find a buyer:
<difficulty>.  Trader, Streetwise. 6 hours.
Referee: Difficulties as for buying.  Modify task as necessary for local
circumstances (eg. food will always be purchased in a famine!)

Players should also role-play the sale.  This is where volatility comes in. 
Some goods are more volatile, and so their final price tables go farther to
the extremes.  (Eg. 10% to 800%)  Roll on the appropriate final price table,
modified with bargaining skill and the Sale DMs for that good.


CONSTRUCTING TRADE TABLES

Without posting loads of tables, here is the procedure:

First, pick a template table.  Table size is based on plantary population: Lo
get 1D, Mod gets 2D, Hi gets 3D.  (This is a Q&D way to represent greater
economic variety.)

Fill in tables with general good classes (rather like MT good classes eg. raw
materials, refined materials...).  Mods to this based on world trade class.

>From general trade class, create specific good:

a) Roll for description (eg. machine parts).
b) Roll to modify base cost & price.
c) Record sale DMs
d) Roll for lot size (modified by population).
e) Name good (eg. grapple grommets)

The completed line would look something like this:

Grapple Grommets (machine parts)    1500Cr/2200Cr  Ni+1, In-2  1D x 1kL (5
tonne)

Thus, grapple grommets can be purchased for a base cost of 1500Cr per kL, and
sold for a base price of 2200Cr per kL.  There are 1D lots available, and
they mass 5 tonnes per kL.


COMPUTER ASSISTANCE: Needless to say, I don\'t roll up these tables by hand! 
That\'s what spreadsheets are for.


NOTE: I put all my prices on a per kL basis, just so I had a standard of
comparison.  For vehicles/weapons/etc (stuff that already had prices) I just
used those with a fudge factor for packing space.

Also, the full version (which I only used for a trading campaign) included
rules for faulty goods, trade restrictions, etc.  In retrospect it was too
complicated, but I that campaign ended before I could simplify the rules.

Well what possibly could be the reasons, then we can decide which ones
are the most exciting. I think the Astubula (I really should try to
remember how to spell that name, what does it mean anyway?) should have
an epic fate, something that the players will get excited about, its
rescue? would bring in several highranking Navy brass.  It should be
something different then all the rest.

1) A TED has captured the ship,  ITs been done before, ALOT!

2) Virus got the ship, either infected it, or a Vampire Ship blew it
up. Again its been done before.

3) The Guild captured or Blew up the ship.  Also been done before.

4) The Hivers got the Ship.  But why would the Hivers want the ship,
they are supposed to be our friends. :)  I think I might spread rumors
that the Ashtabula has been captured by the Hivers, and that is at one
of the Hiver Staging Grounds.  The players try investigate, and get
warned away.  Of course the Hivers don\'t have the ship, but someone
wants friction to form between the RC and the Hivers.  In my campaign
it will be a Hiver Shadow Nest.

5) Ship just broke down,and needs repairs, it sits on a distant planet,
trying to build a new jump drive out of a few cocoanuts and chewing
gum.  Kind of dull, but might work for one of the Victrixs

6) Ship misjumped and is  in another sector, it heroically tries to
fight its way back to the RC, on the way discovering strange new
civilizations.  Well, this is ST:Voyager, would make an interesting
campaign, but doesn\'t bring around an adventure for the players, again
it might make sense for one of the Victrixs.

7) The Crew turned traitor and stole the ship, and is now working for a
TED/Solee/Guild or independent pirates.  This is kind of neat, but I
don\'t think it works for the Ashtubula, it was the Flagship of the
fleet, doesn\'t seem like they would station anyone but the best on
board. Again maybe one of the other shps.

8) The ship isn\'t actually missing, it was sent on a secret mission to
do something or other, so the RC said it was lost.

9) The Crew found a mission that was more important than the RC, I
don\'t know, fighting against an ancient enemy from beyond the stars or
something.  Guess I have been watching too much Babylon 5.

10) The Crew found out a dirty little secret of the RC, or a high
ranking official, and the official sent them off on a suicide mission,
but some members are still alive. Or the official arranged for the ship
to be captured, and killed.

Well I am about out of ideas, How do these sound?  Anyone want to add a
few more, expand on any of these?  Hopefully this gets someone\'s
creative juices flowing.

Oooh Oooh I got another one.
11) The ship landed on a planet, and an insane terrorist dropped a
relativistic rock on them. There I knew I could bring in the killer rock thread. :)

Perfect example.  My party is on Promise, yes we went through Vampire
Fleets, we\'re getting as much distance from Star City as we can in a large
diesel truck.  It\'s been a trying week to say the least, Stinger (His name,
we call him Stone Wall) was killed on the bridge of the Archer as we siezed
the ship.  Grumble was killed as we tried to escape the city.

We were being followed by trogs, I stayed behind to ambush them,  a fire
fight ensues Grumble inorder to come to my rescue at a higher speed "Pulls
his Tabs" read any section about the RC body sleave and you\'ll get the
refference.  The fire fight continues Grumble gets hit and goes unconcious.
Unaware that Grumble has just "Pulled his Tabs" I pull them again causing a
massive heart attack and killing Grumble.  I was kinda upset about this.

So anyway\'s we arrive at this little roadhouse for gas and food, I buy so
bottles of wiskey, head to the back of the truck and proceed to drink myself
into unconciousness.  Meanwhile in the bar, Birdman deciedes to pick a fight
with a local rough and tumble bounty hunter.  Bad move, the guy turns out to
be an anderoid with similar construction philosophy to a terminator.
Needless to asy all hel breaks loose as I\'m pleasently blotto in the back of
the 5-ton.  

Then they had the audacity to say, I didn\'t start the fight, wasn\'t me, etc..

You get the picture.

MAV is an acronym used by the former Imperium for a particular type of vehical.
Meson Artillery Vehicle.  This TL15 bad boy has a short range of 3,000 km
inflicting 129 points of damage on whatever it hits.  The armor is pretty
horrendus by Armored vehicle standards but who cares you park it 500 km away
from the action and use it for fire support.  At 3000 km it\'s capable of
hitting anything in orbit from the ground.

See PG 40 of the RCVG (Regency Combat Vehicle Guide).

Yep, know the type well.  I on the other hand tend to think this is a bad
thing.  As generally there\'s way more of them than you.  I mean there\'s no
such thing as a completely squemish PC, but lets face it every drop of blood

whatever it is you\'re trying to accomplish exponentially.

Actually I believe there\'s an "H" in there, Ashtabula, lets check.  Yep,
Ashtabula.

Believe it or not this might be an option.  The ship incharge of Archer\'s
Vampire Fleet, in the module of the same name is a Broadsword.  Perhaps
Ashtabula has infiltrated the Fleet and is running it on our behalf...

>3) The Guild captured or Blew up the ship.  Also been done before.

This I have my doubts about, Ashtabula was a pretty heavily armed ship.  The
Guild (boo hiss) would have to be packing some serious hardware to take out
Ashtabula.

This I like, its a great adventure plot even if it is untrue.  Perhaps
Ashtabula has been sent back to Hiver space for some unknown reason.

This is actually a possibility.  The Ashtabula might have cottened on to
something and decided what ever it was, was far more important than losing
the scent.  So technically they\'re awol with a purpose.

I\'ve alway held a special place in my heart for Ashtabula.  Perhaps the crew
was killed by a mysterious alien lifeforce and the ship is just drifting
aimlessly about some gas giant in Diaspora.  Personally I think there\'d be a
much more intensive search for Ashtabula, it is terribly important to the
people of the RC.  Perhaps they sent it off to contact the Regency?

There\'s a fundamental rule of space operations which, once you really 
absorb it, know it instinctually, will make everything else about space 
ops (rock dropping, near-c lifeboats, and even ordinary in-system travel) 
make more intuitive sense.  That rule?

   *SPEED DOESN\'T MATTER*

Now, before everybody jumps on me, there is a single notable exception to 
this rule.  At really high speeds, say 0.1c or more, both relativistic 
effects and (related) increasing hazards from dust particles in your path 
become a factor.  Other than that, though, speed is utterly irrelevant to 
how things work.  Remember, you can always choose a reference frame in 
which you and the rock you\'re strapped to are stationary, and the whole 
system around you is zooming by at 30 km/s.  (It gets more complicated 
when you accelerate, but the general principle stands.)

What *does* matter in space is acceleration.  Acceleration is what uses 
fuel, puts stress on your ship, and so forth.  TL 8 Terrans have a hard 
time getting used to this idea, as all our common experience (cars, for 
example) tell us that merely travelling fast is both stressful on 
machinery and requires constant power input.  Not so in space, though.

So, if I nose my ship up to a convenient asteroid, clamp onto it, and 
start pushing, I can pick any acceleration I like, based on how much 
stress the nose of my ship can take, and how massive the asteroid is.  
The force on my ship\'s nose is given by F = ma, where m is the asteroid\'s 
mass, and a is the acceleration.  I can bring F arbitrarily close to 
zero, by doing the same with a.

Of course, the lower my acceleration, the longer it will take to push the
rock into the target world, and the slower it will be going when it
arrives.  Assuming we start effectively at rest relative to the target
world, and boost continuously toward it, cutting loose just short of the
target, we can derive the travel time, t = sqrt(2d/a), and the velocity 
at impact, v = at = sqrt(2ad).

Hope this makes sense.

It\'s possible a high tech forensic kit would include a device that could
instantly reconstruct a persons face from just a skull.  Or even from their
DNA, though this would probably take longer and be more of a Solomani thing.
If the perp left DNA you could reconstruct them too.  Skin, hair, blood,
well you can imagine the rest of this list.

You could probably differentiate between the different sub-species of
humanity (yes I dislike the other spelling immencly) based on genetic
markers in the field.  A protable retina scanner for fresh ones.  

There\'s a substance you can currently spray into a room that when viewed
under UV light causes human oils, finger prints, to glow.  Something for
detecting blood in limited quantities, it washed clothes etc.  Again this is
currently available.  

A balistic analysis kit, capable of telling you what kind of gun the slug
was fired from possible even where the bullet was made.

Something that would be useful in the collection of hair samples, some kind
of light.

A portable crime scene reconstruction kit.  It analyzes the size and 3D
characteristics of the crime scene, and based upon evidence immediatly
available reconstructs what happened with little geometric people.

The contents of your forensic kit are really only limited by you\'re
imagination.  I\'m sure there\'s something you could tell about an individual
just by the air they exhale so you could analyze that too.

By the way Mark I lost that world map you sent me, computer ate it.  Could
you re-send it.  Thanks

Perhaps we should look at the example set by the USAF, or even civilian
airliners to answer this.
on a B-52, there is allways a flight engineer.
on a 757, there is allways a flight engineer.
Admittedly, the traditional role of engineer on a starship bears little to
no resemblance to that of engineer on an aircraft (except perhaps with the
B-52, where some inflight engine repairs have been made) the precedent is
available.
Besides, its just common sense. check out the "starship operators
handbook" from DGP, it explains exactly why you need a engineer, in
depth.

You don\'t really *need* to know how much actual energy is involved,
although you\'re right: this is certain to be in the rules and can cause
problems (I\'ve proposed one way to solve the velocity problem, though).

This is an example of where things need to be thought out in advance.
If the drives require too little energy, there may be "free" kinetic
energy for the taking. If they require *tremendous* amounts, there may
be ways to use the powerplants or drives as ultra-powerful weapons.

True (and we can do that now). But at least that:
o is likely to take a while, and
o requires finding the rock first (sorry, you just can\'t seem to locate
  one in this system!).

You can\'t do anything about suicide attacks, of course. Non-military
non-commercial ships would hit the ground like nukes. Big ones might
even be able to do some decent ecological damage. Hopefully anything
worse should only be possible with military (or perhaps with *big*
commercial) vessels.

That could work. The hazards *may* have to be unrealistically severe,
though. If you are pushing a rock, for instance, you will be behind
it, somewhat protected. Will the rock be completely obliterated by
the random particle of dust it encounters? If not, its trajectory
may be changed, but the would-be attacker could leave reserve thrust
to compensate or simply take another pass at the planet.

Other than that, this level of discouragement is sufficient for me.
You may be willing to waste ships (and risk negative press) in some
military campaigns, but at least nature has some chance of stopping
a lone suicidal madman.

  this time think of a single topic that is currently being

  Additionally, all of the current traffic seems to be on various
  topics associated with Traveller, a product line yet to be
  released by Imperium Games (as opposed to Traveller, a product
  released about 20 years ago by Game Designers Workshop).  I do
  not contend that this is a bad thing.  Far from it - it signals
  that there is quite a lot of enthusiasm for the forthcoming
  product line, and much involvement in seeing that it succeeds,
  from both a technical and marketing/social perspective.  I
  support this concept wholeheartedly.

  I do contend that the duplication is unnecessary, both to the
  recipients of the lists, and to the administrator of the lists.

  I am therefore formally requesting that discussion on
  reunification of Traveller and XBoat be opened, with the proposed
  name for the combined list being "Traveller".

  This is not to be taken as an objection to redivision, or a new
  division, once the new products have become available - if there
  is truly a legitimate need for a separate list to support one or
  more of the superseded product lines, I will support the creation
  of that list.  I simply feel that at this time, the focus is
  clearly on the forthcoming product line, to the apparent
  exclusion of all else, and that given this focus, the separate

I too have been getting slightly annoyed by the duplication of messages

about a combined list containing all of the members of both lists?

Does anybody know if majordomo makes it possible to automatically

Just a thought to reduce congestion in the mailboxes of those people
subscribed to both lists.  What do people think?

   When "mesons" decay, they release energy (probably in the form of gamma
rays, or some other energetic radiation) this is what\'s detectable.

As a dedicated fan of Classic Traveller who doesn\'t own MT nor T:NE, I 
support a reunification of the lists.  I think people can refrain from 
flaming others\' tastes in Traveller flavors.  (Besides, we should all 
agree to police this sort of thing, and hopefully Rob will boot truly 
abusive folks off the list.)

I don\'t know how difficult it would be to create another list if it 
becomes necessary after T4 is introduced, though.  Maybe Rob would rather 
not go through that, eh?  Might be easier for him to keep Xboat around, 
which he can then designate as the CT/MT/TNE list, leaving the Traveller 
list for T4 (or whatever division seems logical at the time).

What do you say, Rob?

What is bad is when you are also on GDW-Beta where the ship design stuff
is being designed.  I frequently get the same message three times.

I don\'t know, but there are ways to make it happen.

Actually Paul, the list ADMIN could issue an edict similar to:

>From your ADMIN:

     The Traveller Mailing List is for discussions about any Traveller
     version of Traveller.  All discussions regarding T4 should be 
     discussed here.  

     The Xboat mailing list is for discussions of Classic and Mega-
     Traveller.  TNE and T4 discussions are not permitted there.
     Any one on Xboat who wishes to discuss T4, or follow its development
     should subscribe to Traveller as well as Xboat.

     Cease and desist any further posts to Xboat that relates to T4 or MMT.
     
     Cross posts should be kept to a minimum, and should only address specific
     issues that are important to both list such as administravia, or questions
     of a generic nature such as "Why was there no Grandmother for Grandfather"
     that needs the input from multi-era people.  Announcments of Web sits, and
     other things that are of the common good are ok to be cross posted.

Now these two lists have very specific missions.  T4 seems to be important to both
lists, but specifically by the charters of the two mailing lists, T4, while its 
roots are CT/MT, is clearly to be discussed in Traveller, and since its not CT/MT
should not be discussed in Xboat.

Discussion?  Do we need a list to discuss the RFD?

   Chem analyzer of some sort. (sniffer perhaps)
   
   Computer, possibly AI to analyze patterns, do data searches, etc. (even

Should be portable enough to easily carry on belt.

    'body' => 'Hi all.  Okay, I\'m not usually big on the discussion of dropping rocks, 
but I got this idea and I just have to fly it past people.  I\'m a mere 
arts student with a semi-science background, so please feel free to make 
corrections to my reasoning/math.

I was thinking about possible defences against dropped/propelled rocks and
I remembered someone noting that you could take one out by hitting it with
a very low mass projectile (i.e., the pebble would do the same thing to
the boulder as the boulder was supposed to do to the planet.)

Then I thought:  Why not protect your planet with a big layer of particles
in orbit around it?  A boulder hitting one of the particles would go poof
(Or would it? See below.).  Then I pulled out my trusty calculator and
figured out the following: 

If you want to create a spherical layer of particles around your planet of 
50000 km radius and 10 m thickness, you end up with a shell having 
a volume of  314100000 km^3.

The calculations for this are as follows, ignore \'em if you trust me :-): 
Outer sphere has radius of 50000 km, therefore volume of 4/3 * PI *
50000^3 = 5.235987753 x 10^14. Inner sphere has a radius of 49999.99 km,
volume = 5.235984612 x 10^14. Subtract volume of inner sphere from that of
outer sphere to get the volume of the shell (3.141 x 10^8 km^3). 

If you want to put a 1 gram particle in every cubic meter of that volume, 
you need 3.141 x 10^17 grams of matter (or 3.141 x 10^14 kg, or 3.141 x 
10^11 metric tons).  Assuming you have a nice asteroid belt around and some 
asteroids with an average density of 10g/cm^3 (or 10 tons/m^3), you need 
3 x 10^10 cubic meters of crushed rock.  That\'s a mere 30 cubic 
kilometers! (Okay, so "mere" isn\'t quite the word, but for a high-tech 
society it shouldn\'t be a big problem, I don\'t think.).

(I think my density assumption may be a little high, can anyone let me 
know one way or the other?  Even if it\'s only 5g/cm^3, 60 cubic km 
isn\'t so daunting either.)

Anyway, you get this crushed rock and stick it in orbit around your world. 
Any boulder coming in is sure to hit one or more of the particles.  If it
is travelling at the infamous velocity of .1 C (300000 m/s) and hits just
one pebble, it receives .005 * 300000^2 = .45 gigajoules of kinetic
energy.  I\'m not sure if this is enough to vaporize it (depends on size
and composition of course), but it should bust it up into very tiny
peices.  And the larger the rock, the more particles it hits.  If this is
not enough, then you can always up the size of the particles to 10 g and
get 300 cubic kilometers of rock (though now were talking a bigger
project, of course). 

One problem with this scheme is letting freindly ships in and out.  This
could be accomplished by a network of sattelites with big magnetic /
gravitic grapples / repulsors which open "gates" in the particle shell for
ships to pass through.  These statellites would also serve to repair
occasional holes and such in the shell. 

Of course, this scheme isn\'t foolproof (nothing ever is, cuz fools is so
ingenius :-), but it does allow a basic defense against occasional
long-distance rock lobbing.  I picture it as something that would be used
to protect major industrial centers and capitals and such.  I wonder if 
Trin/Trin\'s Veil wasn\'t selected as a capital because it had such 
defenses naturally in the form of dust clouds?

Here are a couple more designs.  There doesn\'t seem to be much use for 
both a Free Trader and a Far Trader, as far as cost goes, under the TL 11 
design rules for T4.  The cost is almost exactly the same, yet with the 
Far Trader you get Jump-2.  The only advantage of the Free Trader (other 
than a tiny cost reduction) is the increased cargo space.

The Subsidized Merchant is a great deal under this system, since it costs 
about seven megacredits more than the Free Trader, yet has nearly 200 
tons of cargo capacity.  

(By the way, before I forget, there was a typo in the Far Trader 
listing.  The Sensors are listed as Improved TL 12.  They are in fact 
Improved TL 11.)

At any rate, here are the designs:

=====
Free Trader

Tons:  200		Volume: 2800		Cost: 84.42 (63.31)
Crew:  2/5		Passengers (H/M): 6/0	Passengers (L): 20

Crew Detail (Minimum) : Engineer/Electronics, Pilot/Astrogator.


(Note: The Medic/Steward may be foregone if no passengers are carried.  
The Gunners are optional if the weapons will not be used.)

The Free Trader is based on a 200-ton, box, streamlined hull and has a 10 
ton/hr fuel purification plant.  A variant without the fuel purification 
plant is available with greater cargo capacity (70.8) for a slightly 
lesser price (MCr 63.24 after the standard discount).  In either format, the 
Free Trader contains standard civilian TL-11 avionics and improved TL-11 
communications systems.  There are 7 Large Staterooms available, one of 
which is typically used by the senior individual.  The rest of the crew 
makes use of the four bunks available.  

===================
Subsidized Merchant

Tons:  400		Volume: 5600		Cost: 94.37 (70.78)

(Note: The Medic and Steward may be foregone if no passengers are carried.  
The Gunners are optional if the weapons will not be used.)

Using a 400-ton, cylindrical hull, the subsidized merchant (nicknamed fat 
trader) is a trading vessel intended to meet the commercial needs of 
clusters of worlds.  The ship has nine staterooms (one of which is used 
by the Commander), nine low berths, and eight small staterooms (to be 
used by the crew).  The sensors and communications are of the Improved 
TL-11 type, while the Avionics are standard civilian TL-11 components.

but haven\'t been paying that much attention to the latest one (how many 
have their been?  How far back does this go?).  If no-one\'s 
covered it, let me take a shot.  

Here\'s my idea:  You put a network of railguns around your world about
100000 km out, and make the network dense enough that there\'s no more than
10000 km between any two railguns.  If you assume a rock coming in at .1 C
and a detection distance of one light second (this is based on Grand
Survey\'s assertion that desitometers can detect any size of spaceship at
500000 km), that gives you ten seconds to get something in front of the
rock that will vaporize it on impact.  The rock\'s own velocity will
provide most of the needed KE, so the main thing to do is get something in
front of the rock.  You need to do this in 10 seconds and the max distance
to cover is 5000 km.  You therefore need to launch a projectile at 500
km/second.  Here\'s a diagram.  Each character represents about 10000 km.

How feasible is this?  Is the 500 km/s figure implausible?  Could rocks 
go faster than .1 C?  Sorry if all this has been covered recently...

 Sneak into your local hobby shop and peak through the character

I can name at least one (and I haven\'t been keeping up with xboat very well):
        The world map thread on xboat.

Untrue.  I am still working on my development of the TNE-RC universe (so is
the thread of the missing RC ships, another exception).  I really don\'t want
to have to put up with a bunch of people jumping on my case whenever I want
to talk about the era in which I want to game.  I don\'t mind hearing about
Mileau 0, Imperial 1100, or the Rebellion(I wouldn\'t be subscribed to xboat
if I did mind).  However, I do think there a some people out there who don\'t
want to hear about the RC era, and although I don\'t understand the bias, I
do respect it.

As long as there are people on either list who can\'t stand reading about one
of the other GDW created eras, there will be problems.  If we could somehow
make everyone post their messages with CT, MT, TNE, T4, ALL before the
subject, I think it might be able to work, but we can\'t even get everyone to
stop posting with "Re: Traveller digest #652" (or whatever) in the subject line.

Please don\'t take this the wrong way either.  I would love to only have to
read one list, but I think there are people on both sides of this fence that
can\'t come to terms with the fact that others don\'t see things their way.

My vote is that we\'re not ready for this yet.

Clear as mud!!  (How did I ever even pass high school physics?)

I never have been able to comprehend the concepts of relativity.  I\'m
assuming that 1. All  these formulae are correct, and 2. You Physics whizzes
have determined that this is possible.  I mean to my feeble brain, it seems
impossible that a tiny 1-6G starship could possible move an asteroid of any
decent size fast enough that it would really cause damage.  Really, I find
it difficult that a ship could move an asteroid period.

OK, let me explain why I think this.  I\'m using a car as a frame of reference...

wait, wait, wait...   (sounds of wheels turning in head)

OK, I get it.  This would be more akin to moving something in water, only
without the water creating a sort-of friction/drag element.  The car example
is bad cause of the friction on the road as well as the problems of gravity.
(does gravity create a problem?)  I think I\'m getting clearer.

Another question, someone mentioned that a rock moving near the speed of
light (I think that was the speed to which they referred) would make it to
the surface of a planet regardless of size.  (I think that\'s what they said)
How is this possible?

I\'ve been getting answers from a number of people, but we might want to take
this private.  I would like to know though.

I already mentioned to Jo that we ought to work up an Imperial College of
Arms for Mileau 0.  I can see it as a part of the history what with the many
nobles and such.  Besides, where else woud the MegaCorps go to register
their emblems.

Only two right now, Jeff.  I downloaded the Admin Handbook fo the College of
Arms of the SCA today as well as Stephen Gold\'s heraldry primer for a
refresher.  Like I asked Jo, do you have any reccommendation on good books
with the Heraldry rules in them, I can\'t find any and I haven\'t done any of
this stuff since high school.  (BTW, Jo, I do need that ISBN number if you
can get it.  I don\'t remember if I told you or not.)


I would like to know if either of you can point me where to go to find out
more about the SCA, and joining.  Jo, I looked at the site you gave me, and
I either never got back to the original site from an early taken link, or it
wasn\'t the right place.

Ethan, you get on your cell phone and call AAA...or in the case of
Toronto the Canadian version of 911.  <g> And before you bring it up,
if you are cell-less you can *always* try to walk for help.  Try that
in space.  Try it in a star system somewhere off the beaten track.

Starships are not automobiles, not in my games anyway.  An air-raft,
that\'s a car.

So what\'s an engineer?  It\'s someone with "mechanical,
electronic, robotic, gravitic, engineering, etc-1" skills Maybe the
problem is a difference in terminology, I\'m saying you\'ve got to have
someone with repair, technical & engineering *skills* to fill the
engineering function.  That person can *also* have other duties...when
he isn\'t keeping the gravtics working he\'s in the kitchen.  <g>

Depends on what you did to *their* ship.  <g> You could kill them or
drive them off without a working JDrive, that doesn\'t affect your
ability to maneuver or fight.  So when the fight is over and you\'ve
won, you still have a fried jump coil...and no engineering skills
aboard?

..but a surprise that wouldn\'t have happened if the pilot wasn\'t
trying to do *everything* herself.

I repeat, a starship is *not* like a car.  

You don\'t drive your car 24 hours a day, at high speed, through almost
constant hailstorms, not stopping for *anything* for a week.  You
don\'t regularly generate 10 million k temps in your car\'s engine.  You
don\'t do to a car whatever jumping does to a starship. 
Air-conditioning is a lot more important on a starship than on a car.

Did I see engineer-1 up there?  So you do need that engineering skill,
huh?  <g> 

Look, I\'m not ragging you, it\'s just most folks here act like the crew
numbers are physical laws.  The way I read them they are functions
that should be covered.  A ship that shows 3 Engineers doesn\'t mean
you\'ve got to hire 3 beings who do nothing but service the engines, it
means there is expected to be enough work to keep 3 beings busy with
Engineering duties, and that might *really* mean a full time job for 1
depending on how the GM wants to play it.

Not in *my* universe!  <g> I know most folks don\'t, but the way I run
things the technical/engineering people are as busy in jump space as
normal space.

There you go again! <g>  

A Starship is *not* a car!

...and Rob it\'s not a commerical jetliner either. <g>

What a starship is, is a cranky, complex vessel with millions of
components running at the edge of their spec, on a constant preventive
maintenance schedule, and with so many quirks and so much
"personality" you\'d swear it was alive.  You keep this beast running
through a black void of constant danger with just the materials and
skills you have aboard.  If you can get her to a port where somebody
else can do work on her you can\'t do, then count yourself lucky
because that just won\'t happen very often.

See?  In my Traveller ships don\'t fly themselves, it takes a Pilot
with skill.  Ships don\'t jump by themselves, it takes someone with
Astrogation skill.  And a ship won\'t keep running unless someone with
Engineering skill keeps her running.

Rob, check out my post to Ethan about this.  We actually agree about
*dedicated* engineers aboard, but it\'s clear I give my technical
people more work to do than Ethan..probably more than you too. <g>

>Also, once the ship is in jump, there doesnt have to be any one

Flight controls?  No, agreed.  So, during jump everybody is busy with
various maintanance task, and repairing the hundreds of little things
that go wrong.  How many hands are needed to do this depends on how
reliable the ship is, I guess...and I guess mine are less reliable
than yours.

You hit A and B ports very often?  My PC\'s are lucky to see an A or B

Yes, but 747\'s don\'t stay aloft for a week at a time either.  The
between flight for a 747 comes up on the order of 8-12 hours max. If
that 747 was going to stay in the air for a week, I\'d expect a bigger
crew aboard...wouldn\'t you?

The Shuttle doesn\'t get more than a few hundred miles from a landing
zone either.  If it *really* needs an engineer, it lands...actually it
better not *really* need one.  <g> I\'d say all the crew of the Shuttle
have Engineering skill at some level, given that they are in constant
communication with experts on the ground and the level of training
they go through.

Pretty different as a whole.

Character Generation rules are radically different, as well as ship 
design & combat (space & ground).  No good backwards compatibility either...

Trade & Commerce are identical to MT, world generation is as well, 
although there is a modification system for creating the "Wilds" used 
in TNE.

All in all a drastic change in system.  More importantly to old line 
players, there is a much bigger emphasis on military adventures...
2 sample adventures are included, both of which are very military 
oriented, the character generation system even requires the players 
to be given call signs.  

There are a lot more career choices than in MT, but since virtually 
all the published material for TNE was designed with military/merc 
style adventures in mind, it\'s hard to imagine why somebody would 
want to play an entertainer or athlete in the game...

A lot of people objected to Virus.  I personally do not.  My only 
real beef with TNE was that it looked too much like Twilight: 2000 
with spaceships...  That and the fact that it was not backwards 
compatible with CT or MT.

I\'m sorry but the old Cr 1000 standard just sounds too arbitrary to me...

Envision this scenario...

Mr. Smith on the mainworld of system Backwater, with an E starport, 
hasn\'t seen a ship arrive on the cleared landing pad he has set up 
for the purpose in 6 weeks...

He has a few tons of cargo (say the cargo is several tons of a 
critical component of a vaccine for a plague on the high population 
world some 4 parsecs over), and the freight is very time sensitive... 
(people are dying after all).  A pharmaceutical company there will 
probably buy the component from Mr. Smith to manufacture the vaccine 
at a huge margin, making Mr. Smith a wealthy man, but only if he gets 
it there quickly...

Suddenly, in jumps Hal with his tramp free trader.  He comes into 
system about every 3 months to deliver mail.  Mr. Smith probably 
won\'t see another ship for 2 or 3 weeks minimum.  Hal finds out how critical 
it is to get this cargo to market for Mr. Smith, knows that Mr. Smith 
may not see another ship until Hal comes back in about 12 weeks, and 
knows how much of a bind Mr. Smith is in, and... GLADLY AGREES TO 
SHIP THE CARGO FOR THE STANDARD RATE OF Cr1000 per ton.

Is Hal a philanthropic sort, who would not want to take advantage of 
Mr. Smith (who will probably make a killer margin off the sale of the 
goods being transshipped, unless of course Mr. Smith paid the 
standard Merchant Prince base price of Cr4000, and plans to sell for 
the standard  base price of Cr5000)?  Is Hal a socialist, who completely 
ignores the realities of the free market system that Traveller\'s Imperium 
encourages...  Is Hal running a non-profit organization centered 
around his tramp freighter  (well, maybe)?  Nope, Hal is just following 
the rules for trade and commerce in Book 2, or the Merchant Prince 
system, which is the trade and commerce rules for every edition of 
Traveller released since CT.

Get real.  It\'s not a matter of whether Cr1000 makes a ship 
affordable or not.  It\'s a matter of totally ignoring how capitalism 
works.  The facts are that Hal is probably going to rape Mr. Smith 
for 3000 or more Cr per ton, because Mr. Smith\'s cargo is worthless 
if he doesn\'t get it to the pharmaceutical company fast...  Mr. Smith 
will gladly pay it, because the stuff only cost him about Cr2000 to 
produce, and he has an agreed to price from the pharmaceutical 
company to buy all he can ship at Cr10,000+.  And the pharmaceutical 
company will use a tiny bit of this in a vaccine that they will make 
a tidy profit off of, since you can\'t put a price on life...

Actually, the speculative rules for the newer editions of the rules 
(everything but book 2) are even more broken than the rules for 
shipping freight.

Let\'s carry on the example above...

Hal buys this time sensitive cargo off of Mr. Smith.  He buys it for 
slightly lower than the Cr4000 base price, at Cr3800 (base price according 
to Merchant Prince, MT & TNE), because Hal is, after all, an experienced 
trader.  Hal then assumes the cost of shipping that cargo himself (let\'s say for 
illustrative purposes, that Hal\'s cost to ship (salaries, overhead, 
payments, etc), is Cr800 per ton.  Hal has 4600 credits sunk in this stuff.  

He then busts a gut to get things loaded, and then ships this 
wonderful, time sensitive cargo over to the pharmaceutical company, 
where he gladly sells his cargo for Cr4200 credits, a net loss, per 
ton of Cr400.  Oh, I forgot to mention:  These two fictional worlds 
are on the Imperial-Solomani border.  The vaccine component is grown 
and processed on an Imperial world, but the plague (and the 
pharmaceutical company) are on a Solomani world, so deduct Cr1000 from 
the standard Cr5000 base to yield a Cr4000 base price.  Hal, shrewd 
trader that he is negotiated a gain of Cr200/ton over the base 
price...for a final selling price of Cr4200.  Never mind that the 
pharmaceutical company has people lined up waiting to buy the drug, 
never mind that Hal has a corner on the market, the pharmaceutical 
company is going to make Hal sell at a loss, and Hal is going to sell 
at a loss and smile about it...

It would be very conceivable under the trade and commerce rules for 
everything but Book 2, for ANY ship to lose money, if trade was their 
sole source of income...  Megacorps would be going the way of the 
dodo if they bought and sold in accordance with the Merchant Prince 
system...

Even worse, there is NO reason whatsoever for somebody to hire a 
carrier (like Mr. Smith did with Hal in the first example). since the 
difference in base price would be eaten up by the cost of the Cr1,000 
per ton to ship.

Book 2 isn\'t much better.  Some of the numbers there are badly out of 
whack at this point.  Try fitting Cr10,000,000 worth of computers 
into 14 m^3, for example.  Heck, by the time the 57th century rolls 
around, you probably wouldn\'t be able to put that much worth of 
computers into the cargo hold of a free trader, at the rate computer 
prices drop compared to power...

The trade and commerce rules do need an overhaul...If not in the basic 
rules, perhaps in a JTAS article, or a future supplement...

The book 2 speculative system is better, but needs more cargoes, and 
the numbers need to be tweaked.  At a minimum freight transshipping 
should include factors for all of the below:

Class of the shipping Starport
Class of the receiving Starport
Need for quick delivery
Negotiating skills of the shipper and owner of the goods
Amber Zone or Red Zone bonuses

Any thoughts?

To me, the idea that there can\'t be any kind of cross-fertilisation
between the different flavours of Traveller is ridiculous.  Don\'t
like the TNE stats for an interesting NPC?  Substitute some CT/
MMT stats instead.  The real work is there in the ideas of the
description and character.  Stats are easy.  Don\'t like the CT
description of a long endurance stealth intelligence cruiser
because the CT description doesn\'t include the dimensions of
the waste water pipes in the plumbing system?  Maybe the
posting might inspire you to design your own version of the ship.
Maybe you could just skip over it.  Personally, I have to confess
that I am not too interested in the rock-velocity-planet-boom
thread, but hell, it\'s relevant to Traveller, and if people want to
discuss it that\'s fine by me, I\'ll just skip to the next thing that
does interest me.

This is getting a bit much like the Wars of Religion for my liking.  Is it
really that much of an effort just to move on to an article that does
not offend your principles?  I think that if we all got this blinkered we
could end up with a proliferation of mailing lists - CT, MT, TNE, MMT,
CT with planet killing rocks, CT without planet killing rocks etc etc.  If
we all tried really hard we could end up with a list each that suited us
perfectly.  You could then be master of your own domain, where the
things you weren\'t keen on never darkened your RAM.  Conversation
would be a bit dull, mind.

Reality check:  It is only a GAME, much as we all love it.  A bit of
toleration for the things we don\'t like but others do might make
the list a more productive and interesting place. (Apologies for
sounding like the end of a Disney film..)

So, I would support a trial of a merged list.  After a while perhaps
we could all be invited to comment on what has really annoyed
us all and what we have liked most.  This might indicate the most
appropriate ways of splitting the lists should we need to.

Wasn\'t there some discussion a while ago as to how the Regency knew
about the RC early enough to make the quotes in the main rulebook?  I
think we have a viable suggestion.

Personally I like the idea of a Hiver plot, after all would they

        Good one!  That hadn\'t occurred to me yet, actually.  Insider
Traders in Space!  Something that\'s been bugging the hell out of me is the
question of securities regulation; just how the hell does one regulate
securities markets over the distances we\'re talking about?  What about
arbitrage between planets?  Would you get out-of-system incorporation
jurisdictions?

        I really have no idea how the absence of instantaneous
communications would affect a stock market.  I suspect that the equivalent
of today\'s trend towards globalization just wouldn\'t occur; that each
planet, perhaps each system, would have its own markets and regulators.
Perhaps where strong central governments existed, you\'d get uniform
regulation and practices within their jurisdiction.  I\'m just beginning to
wonder how this would affect financing practices.  Ye gods...

        Basically, I think that for all but the Mega-Corps, trading on more
than one planetary or systemic exchange would be pretty rare, although not
unheard-of.  Going multi-systemic would be a critical-mass sort of
operation, done only to finance major operations or expansions on the part
of smaller corps, or used by the really big ones who\'d require such a huge
amount of capital that they\'d have to tap into several planetary or systemic
markets simultaneously (!!!).  For stocks traded on only one (planetary or
systemic) exchange, the usual central depository system would probably work,
much like today.  For stocks traded in several systems, OTOH, I see two
possibilities; either it\'s all done via book entry systems (which would be
slow, impede trading, and make couriers rich), or it\'d be done via bearer
securities (which would make heavily armed couriers rich).  Alternatively,
maybe  you\'d see central depository systems located on several worlds
cooperating (actually, I think that this is most likely).  From an RPG angle
though, I much prefer the latter option >:).

>
>Your ideas on bearer securities are great...  I can see adventure 
>ideas forming in my head as we speak...

        Here\'s one that I\'ve been mulling over: Mega-Corp X appears to be
the target of a systematic attempt to drive down its share prices by
releasing perfectly forged bearer shares (voting ones) into several
planetary markets.  Obviously, the directors of Xco don\'t want the news to
get out, because then Xco stock would tank, and aside from the damage to
their personal portfolios someone could pull a street sweep takeover and
then they\'d all get turfed.  So, they secretly assign the players (all of
whom, it turns out, actually work for Xco or one of its subsidiaries in
whatever capacity) to find out and deal with whoever is responsible, and off
they go in a nice fast spanking new ship with enormous expense accounts,
letters of introduction, get out of jail free cards, lots of really big
guns, and solid gold plumbing in the Jacuzzi.

        The ending (after the usual RPG shenanigans/carnage/much
intimidation of yuppies) would be as follows:  it turns out that the
individual behind it was the chairman of Xco\'s board, who was using Xco\'s
own facilities to turn out the counterfeits.  His aim, (which succeeded
during the shenanigans) was to have the news get out, so that *he* could buy
up a control block at a really, really cut rate and take over the company.
Their mission, in fact, was just a distraction for the other directors, and
in fact had no chance of success.  When confronted by the PC\'s, he simply
offers them huge promotions and a block of stock that while being
chicken-feed to him is worth more than they\'ll make over a couple of
centuries.  Optional endings include:

1) They Do The Right Thing And Blow The Whistle: they fight their way out of
the boardroom, the villian gets fried in the crossfire or goes to jail, they
all live happily ever after, perhaps getting gold watches and minor
promotions from the grateful Xco (the goody two-shoes ending).

2) They Sell Out:  this gives us more options:

        2.1: They become fabulously wealthy over the next few adventures
acting         as heavies for the villain (the amoral ref ending).
        2.2: As per 2.1 save that they begin disappearing mysteriously,
leading         the survivors to run like hell to save their butts: end
result is they         have a Mega-Corp out to get them (the evil ref ending).
        2.3: They figure that 2.2 is going to occur so they gracefully
accept,            and as soon as they have their hands on their share
certificates then         get the hell out of Dodge.  End result is as 2.2
save they all live and         are somewhat richer (the paranoid player ending).

3) They Figure It Out and Run For It: They solve the mystery, and decide to
take the ship and set up as pirates or open a spacegoing brothel or whatever
(the really paranoid player ending).

        What are your plot ideas like?

On space physics in general:

This isn\'t a relativity issue it\'s a frictionless environment issue. In
space there\'s nothing to slow you down like there is here on earth so you
don\'t have to constantly add more energy to the vehicle to keep it moving.
To go back to the car in space you can coast forever with the motor turned
off because their isn\'t anything slowing you down. So a ship with a couple
of low passage berths stranded in between stars with a dead jump drive has
a reasonable chance of survival just by pointing at the nearest system and
accelerating for as long as possible. If they can make 0.1 c they\'ll 
cover a system hex every 32.6 years. 


BTW: The reason 0.1c is bounced about as a number here is because it\'s 
the highest speed you can reach and still ignore the effects of relativity.

Near the speed of light being above 0.5c. This is a horse of a different 
color than the current discussion. The reason that it would make it to 
the surface is because it\'s moving so fast that it wouldn\'t have enough 
time to vaporize before it hit. 

You lose a lot of energy liberated into the atmosphere this way but you 
gain it back in earthquakes when the rock hit\'s the ground.

You\'ve hit the nail on the head. But keep in mind that in a star
system, the relative velocity of objects is generally below 50 km/s.
If you start having spacecraft accelerate (themselves and/or rocks)
to over 30,000 km/s relative to the rest of the system, you have a
problem.

You could look at it this way: acceleration adds energy to the
system. The real problem is that no civilian ship should be able to
generate enough energy *on its own* to destroy a planet. Sure, it
could redirect an asteroid from a nearby orbit--we could do that
with today\'s technology. Sure, it could hit the planet at 50 km/s
just by "stopping" in front of it, hitting like a nuke (but not
*destroying* the planet). There\'s no point denying that these can
be done. This is not in the same league as being able to add over
30,000 km/s (0.1c) to your velocity, though.

CT thrusters were capable of terrific and sustained acceleration.
They also had far too low of an energy requirement. You could just
raise the energy requirements. If you keep high acceleration you are
still adding a great deal of energy to the system, but at least you
are acknowledging it. Unfortunately, it raises the issue about how
else that energy can be used (e.g., by blowing the reactor). I only
suggested the "zeta field" as a way to keep the acceleration but not
the energy. If anyone has a better way to do this, I\'m all ears. Of
course, you could instead reduce the acceleration capability, but I
was under the impression that CT-type thrusters *were* coming back.

Are you sure about that?  Would the rock not be vaporized?  If the rock
gets busted up small enough, the smaller particles would tend to burn up
in the atmosphere more easily (more total surface area) and deflect off
the atmosphere (less individual momentum) more readily.  Also, if they are
small enough, the damage would be significantly less due to lack of holes
in the planetary crust and other nasty effects of a single big impact. 
Generally speaking, it is always better to spread out an impact then
absorb it in one spot.  If the shell is at 50000 km (.16 ls) from the
world, and the peices of the busted rock fly outwards at 5000 m/s (not
sure this is a realistic figure, just kinda made it up.), then the peices
of a rock moving at .1 C would spread out in a circle about 8 km in
radius.  If this is not enough to lessen the effects of impact, you 
simply have to move the shell out more. 

It all depends how much energy is being put into the rock when it hits a
particle in the shell and whether that\'s enough to really pulverized it. 
As I mentioned, if the 1 gram particles are not enough to do this, then 10
gram particles can be used (or 100 grams, whatever). 

You could even make two layers of shell: one to bust the rock into peices
and another to bust the peices into in dust.  You would seperate the
shells somewhat so that the peices had time to spread out and each hit
their own individual "inner shell" particle.  This is all off the top of 
my head, so trash away! :-)

B) You\'d create your own navigational hazard with all that stuff floating
around your world.
__________

As I mentioned, there are ways around this.  The satelite network which 
creates gates in the shell can also keep it in place so that it would 
have clearly defined boundaries.  In any case,  demanding that ships 
near your planet move in a certain manner so as to avoid damaging impacts 
with the particles is not a big imposition (one would expect this as a 
matter of course in space traffic control to prevent disastrous crashes onto 
the planet surface anyway, I would think).

I\'m not arrogant enough to think that I\'ve got it all figure out, so any 
feedback (especially about energy levels required to pulverize rocks) 
would be appreciated.

There is a certian "Gung Ho" attitude about the adventures but neither of 
them are true Military Op\'s.  And the Call Sign thing is only for RC 
characters.  Not an uncommon thing there are plenty of military 
organizations today that use call signs.  Besides its more fun to call

Actually an entertainer makes a great charater, you just have to figure

This is because it used GDW\'s house rules system.  The system that began 
with T2000.  Unfortunately you\'re right about backwards compatibility.  
If you had all the old books there was nothing you could do with the gear 
contained there in.  It ment a constant re-engineering of stuff to give 
it NE stats.

we don\'t have large numbers of starship traffic as of yet (UFO believers
aside). 

	On a Type A starport planet with high traffic, there will be a constant
amount of junk placed in orbit from paint flakes, waste emissions, leaks,
accidents and orbital industries. This will present a hazard to navigation and
will probably be very expensive to clean up. So there may be cleared space lanes
around planets that are certified as safe for civilian traffic, and travel
outside those lanes is both prohibited and dangerous. Of course there would be
cleared military lanes as well. The lack of repulsor technology in FF&S
eliminates one solution. ESA is a possible defense against the smaller junk.

	This illustrates the problem of speculating about hypothetical defenses
against hypothetical weapons - we don\'t have all the details we need, and
peoples prejudices differ as to the answers we want. Or do you want all your
starship captains to be subject to constant psychological scrutiny and testing 
for stability and fitness to safely operate a potentially planet-killing

Gah!  Y\'all are still overlooking something important: a starship is NOT 
an airplane!  A better analogue is a SHIP.  An even better one is a 
SUBMARINE.  Airplanes do not leave the ground and fly around for 2 or 
more weeks before returning; ships leave port for cruises like that all 
the time.  Ships and airplanes stay in radio contact with home base, and 
don\'t have to worry about life support beyond food and water for weeks 
at a time; submarines go out of contact with the rest of the universe 
for weeks or months, and have to carry internal life support or extract 
it from the surrounding hostile environment. 
 
Guess what?  Both ships and submarines carry full-time engineers, whose 
job is that and nothing but that.  A lot of them carry many more than 
one. 
 
And another thing: some of you are still overlooking the difference 
between military and civilian crew requirements.  They are different, 
and should be calculated differently.  Military ships have as large a 
crew as they can get away with for two reasons (a) spare crew, and (b) 
DAMAGE CONTROL!  Military ships are intended to "go in harm\'s way", and 
possibly lose crewmembers, and have big, ugly holes punched in the ship. 
Someone who\'s manning the guns or babysitting the reactor can\'t always 
be spared in the middle of a battle to help plug that hole in the hull 
that seawater is pouring through...  Or put out that fire on the flight 
deck that just killed 27 guys when the loaded bombs on the burning 
fighter blew up... 
 
Civilian ships have as small a crew as they can get away with, because 
crew cost money!  You have to pay them, and you have to have space to 
house and feed them that could be going to paying cargo hold or 
passenger cabin space.  Civilian ships are intended to stay far, far 
away from trouble, so they don\'t need a crew the size of a military 
vessel\'s crew.  They just need enough guys to operate the ship and take 
care of any passengers. 
 
I suspect that the rules for calculating civilian ship crews and the 
rule for calculating the size of a "skeleton" crew (minimum to get the 
ship underway) for a military ship should look almost identical.  A 
civilian ship *has* a skeleton crew + cargo-handlers/pursers + 
passenger-service crew.

This is a stroke of sheer genius!  Generating trade tables the way you

Between my recent marriage and business trips, I haven\'t had a lot of time
to keep up with the threads here. But I *do* know that the next edition of
Traveller will be based on the original.

My question is: HOW closely? If I start a Classic Traveller campaign with
my roleplaying group, will it be easy to update once T4 (MMT) comes out?

If someone could e-mail me and let me know approximate answers to the
following questions, I\'d be REALLY greatful:

1) How close will the new Traveller be to the classic? In particular, with
regards to character generation and combat.

2) Does it look as if ship design will be compatible with High Guard or
Trillion Credit Squadron?

3) Does it look as if the starship combat game will be more along the lines
of Mayday or of Brilliant Lances?

4) Will ship and weapon design be as complex as FF&S?

I know much of this may still be speculative, but I\'d really appreciate any
educated guesses. I\'m trying to figure out whether it\'s worth restarting my
campaign now, or waiting until T4 (or MMT) is out.

Many thanks,

John Kovalic

PS. I hear characters will no longer risk death during generation. Am I the
only person who LOVED the fact that they could kick the bucket before the
game even started? To me, this was the risk you took in trying to come up
with a pumped-up "Super Character." The time alone you\'d spend creating
your character meant that you didn\'t want to take that one last crap shoot
and risk losing your beloved creation.

Yup...so much for the Rodney King, "Can\'t we all just get along..." 
approach to the mailing lists...God, I do so much love people that 
have such an open mind that they can\'t just ignore somebody saying 
something they disagree with...

The silly thing is that other than FF&S being the ship design system, 
there has been almost NO discussion about TNE on the TML list in 
recent weeks.  If people like Brent Woods could just ignore the 
occasional TNE related posts (as I often do), the non-T4 related 
traffic on TML is so low that there\'s no reason to have 2 lists.  95% 
of the stuff on XTML right now is crossposts from TML.  TML is so 
heavy because of discussion of design topics related to T4.

But, I guess that until any remaining support drains away from either 
CT/MT or TNE we\'re going to have 2 lists.  Or be prepared to don the 
asbestos underwear from the occasional totally disgruntled TMLer 
going postal like Phil Pugliese last week...

The bulk of ships don\'t go to those systems. Why would anyone

Ah! What\'s an engineer? I\'d say someone with min. engineering-3
and engineering is their primary skill... someone with
engineering-1 is competent, but not "an engineer". (Plus,
for you Canadians, the engineer needs to have a little iron
pinky ring too...) Anyways, I think our main difference is
one of terminology.

My point was that if you\'re running a ship with only one or two people,
you\'l l likely get wiped out by pirates. Besides, where is this
fight taking place? If it\'s an uninhabitated system, well, it didn\'t
happen as no short handed trader  crew in their right mind would
go there... otherwise, limp back to the port you came from.

I never said you didn\'t need engineering skill, I said you didn\'t
need an engineer. :) There\'s a difference. Again, please note
the engineer\'s completely irrelevant degree from the Institute
on Rhylanor (or whereever) stating he\'s an engineer. This is not
the same as the scout who has completely done a field disassembly
of his entire class S Scout on a vacuum moon once \'cause he was bored. :)

I agree. But a ship that only requires one or two engineers can
get by with one 80% of the time and a big starport crew the other
20%.

Well, like cars, some people have cars that act the way you describe 
starships - cranky, hand-assembeled collections of highly volatile
and odd parts. Of course, some people never lift the hood. 

I don\'t think it would be possible to support the volume of interstellar
traffic that exists in the imperium without a reasonable level
of automation and reliability in starships. Which is not to say
that every ship is like this, but I\'d say that a lot of traders are.

But to get back to my first paragraph, I think my main point

It\'s like saying Medical-3 is a doctor (in CT terms, sorry).
Engineering-3 is an Engineer. Enginering-1, while perfectly capable
of filling an engineering crew spot, isn\'t an engineer.

You know, I really wasn\'t sure about this 1 either, but I suspect 
that stock markets (particularly for those dealing off-world 
securities) are going to be even more tightly regulated...  I 
remember 1 of the early-TNS entries talking about Tukera buying drop 
tanks from General Shipyards, and Oberlindes lines dropping 27 
poijnts, and the exchange suspending trading...

Kind of brings up an interesting scenario...  Imagine what would have 
happened to Johnson & Johnson during the Tylenol scare, if J&J 
headquarters didn\'t happen to be in the same system as the exchange it 
was traded on.  News releases about people dying from tainted 
capsules spreads far and wide across the sector, before J&J top 
management even hears about the disaster to begin formulating the 
responses.  Meanwhile, every day, the stock drops like a rock.  
Pretty soon, a thousand shares of Johnson & Johnson would be worth 
the price of a cup of coffee, and J&J might not even have heard about 
the incidents yet.  Again, the megacorps have the edge, because they 
have offices on most major worlds (and 1 would imagine just about 
every world where their stock was traded...   

I could see several scenarios out of this.

1)  Megacorporation thinks small, but dynamic competitor is becoming 
a serious threat, and starts sending xboat messages about pending 
demise of and disasters affecting the company.  PC\'s must trace 
source of rumors and eliminate (possibly incurring rath of the 
megacorp).

2)  New company on a backwater world develops a dynamic new process 
for manufacturing or a new technology, but needs to send a press 
release to the nearest xboat route.  PC\'s are charged with 
intercepting this message before it hits the xboat network...

3) As a follow up to number 2, Megacorp, having successfully 
preventing the transmittal of the message, substitutes a message of 
their own, telling a tale of woe about the smaller company, causing 
the company\'s stock to plummet to the point where they would not be 
able to finance the new product\'s manufacture, allowing Megacorp to 
buy the company for pennies on the dollar, and then manufacture the 
product itself...

Even if the central depository systems cooperating would be very 
subject to a corporate sponsored PC group creating a lost message 
here, a lost message there...  Basically with STL communications, you 
should be able to manipulate the stock market artificially in all 
sorts of ways.  Probably much like the robber barons of the late 19th 
century did in the US...

I\'m all in favor of intimidation of yuppies :-)

I hadn\'t developed any of them to any great extent, but here they 
are.

1)  Company X has a large number of securities stolen, PC\'s must 
recover
a) theft was an inside job by company employees
b) theft was a simple burglary
c) theft was result of piracy
d) some combination of the above...

2) I saw the same sort of forgery scenario as well...
a) forgery is inside job
b) forgery is being done by Company Y, which is plotting hostile 
takeover of Company X
c) forgery is the work of a total outsider, with no motive other than 
simple greed
d) some combination of the above.

3) PC\'s are hired as couriers of bearer securities for a critical 
transaction, a buyout of company X by company Y, but somebody doesn\'t 
want the deal to go through (a major shareholder in 1 of the 
companies, upper management in company X who fear for their future 
employment).  PC\'s face a number of attempts to recover bearer 
securities ranging from muggings and robberies, to piracy, to 
impersonating the legitimate receiving parties of the securities...

I\'m sure with a little creativity, we or someone else could come up 
with more...

Once the ship is in J-Space no.  However, having said that and I know I\'m 
likely to get jumped all over for this one, if you watch a ship enter 
J-Space you can figure out where it\'s going.  If the military is persuing

You\'ve been watching Sol Bianca haven\'t you?  Being in J-Space consumes a 
lot of fuel, cooling etc.  In theory yes, however unfortunately because 
of the way things work in J-Space you\'d be stuck there for a week unless 
you\'ve found some really nifty way of getting around that feature.  I\'ll

No, it is not possible to survive in J-Space.  You\'re talking about 
spacing some one here right?  See Challange issue 75 "The madness 
effect."  It\'s an adventure set on a Sub-liner that forms a defective 
jump bubble.  Because the passangers are incapable of dealing with the 
effects of J-Space they start to go crazy.  This should answer both 
questions I hope.

Not copyright, *trademark*. Trademark law is rather different. But as
an example, while "chevrons" have been a heraldric charge for
centuries, anyone trying to use them as a logo for an oil or gasoline
related company will get slapped down *hard* by the lawyers for ???
(the branch of Standard Oil better known as Chevron).

Please note that Apple *computer* got into trouble with Apple *records*
a few years back. Apple Records originally allowed Apple Computer to
use "Apple" with the stipulation that they stayed away from music. Once
Apple added sound capability to their computers, they got sued for
violating the agreement.

The reason that you are more likely to get sued is that unlike
copyright, you can *lose* a trademark by not defending it against
mis-use. That happened to "Aspirin", and the "Kleenex". It hasn\'t
*quite* happened to Xerox, but it\'s pretty close.

Must have missed that.  I beleive though that all the Regency Quotes that

Actually if you think about it it\'s really in the Hiver\'s best interests

Maybe. But as I understand it, the general circumstances surrounding a

The Moot may well *be* the Senate. Remember, the Roman Senate bore a

Not bloody likely! A typical ballon has something like a *one* psi
pressure difference between the inside and the outside. Usually a lot
less than that.

Sorry, but 14 psi is nothing to sneer at. At 14 psi, a one sq yd
section of wall will have 9 *tons* of pressure on it. 

For what it\'s worth, the "blast overpressure" that knocks down
buildings and the like is frequently on the order of *2* psi!

What saves you onboard ship is that the regular doors (those not meant
to contain pressure) will rip off their hinges. Figure it out. They
average a couple of sq yds. That\'s about 18 tons. How well do you
expect the typical door to hold up if you place it and its frame
horizontally and then place 18 tons (distributed evenly) on the door?

Another way to help visualize this is that 1 atm is equivalent to 30
feet (10 meters) of water. So picture the wall or other structure laid
out horizontally, with 30 feet of water on top, and only air at normal
pressure underneath it.

Consider that a standard cargo container these days is roughly 2.5m
square on the end and about 8-10 meters long (I don\'t have exact
figures). That\'s about 4 displacement tons. The trailers on
tractor/trailer rigs are about the same size.

So we need to check with local trucking concerns and with shipping
firms.

I seriously doubt it. A typical car is a good 6 meters long and 2
meters wide. Going for even *one* meter thick (convertible?) that gets
you 12 cubic meters right there.

14 cubic meters is about an 8 foot cube.

You might be surprised. Regular cargo carriers routinely handle
"official documents" (like all the records when they move the IRS
office into a different state). And countries that don\'t print their
own currency (there are a lot of those) get it shipped in from the
printer (the US has several companies that print banknotes).

I dunno about "flavored water". Let\'s assume 2 liter bottles of soda. A
quick check gives me 9 bottles in a 40 cm cube, or about 200 per DT. So
that gives me a value of $1000 per DT.

As for weapons, I know what sort of shipping case SKS rifles and AK-47s
come in (a friend used to be a dealer). A 2x1x1 meter box holds a dozen
rifles. So 7 such boxes in a DT, for 84 rifles per DT. So we get about
$4000 per DT. 

Mineral ore, I can\'t say.

To me, one of the cooler things about a hard-SF game like Traveller (or at
least like Trav *can* be) is that you can actually learn some real-world
science as you go.  Sort of sneaks education in the back door. :)

I\'ll tell you why you think that.  Every really big object you\'ve ever 
tried to move by rolling or sliding has been in contact with the ground; 
a small push results in zero motion.  If I\'m pushing my broken car along 
the side of the rode, and try doing it by tapping the rear bumper with my 
index finger, *no* motion happens; there\'s not enough force to overcome 
static friction.

The key insight here is that, if my car were in orbit beside me, and I 
tapped the bumper with my index finger, it *would* acquire a small 
velocity, and begin moving away from me, very slowly, but never slowing 
down because there\'s no friction.  Of course, I would slide off int the 
opposite direction a bit more quickly (though still at very low speed), 
because my mass is much less than that of the car.

Humans just aren\'t built to handle this stuff intuitively.  Our view of 
practical physics is dominated by static and sliding friction, strong 
local gravity, and hard surfaces preventing us from free-falling very 
far.  Our monkey brains are really good at gauging force vectors required 
to swing from limb to limb of a tree, in 1g, with air resistance; they\'re 
not so great at figuring out how to get from Earth to Mars on a 
minimum-energy trajectory.  That\'s why you so often get that startled 
this-can\'t-be-right feeling when you start learning space physics...a lot 
of it is counterintuitive until you learn new kinds of intuition.

Somebody wrote an SF story in which an orbital construction worker was
killed when he found himself between two large girders, slowly approaching
one another.  He absent-mindedly stuck out his hands to either side to
hold them apart...and they inexorably slid together, crushing him.  It\'ll
be a hard road as we move to the stars, learning over and over the lessons
that mass isn\'t weight, and friction isn\'t common. 

The trick to rock-pushing is that you can push as gently as you like, 
your total push over time keeps adding up, and you never lose velocity 
due to friction.  You can easily nudge a rock from the asteroid belt to 
Earth at 0.001g -- given a few years to do the job.  Higher accelerations 
just let you work faster.

Gravity creates a problem in that it holds surfaces in contact, enabling 
friction, and prevents free-fall dynamics, which are easier to calculate.

To a first approximation, it\'s simply that it doesn\'t have time to burn
up.  The speed of light is 300,000 km/s; let\'s say our rock is moving at
the now-canonical speed of 0.1c, or 30,000 km/s.  To a first
approximation, Earth\'s atmosphere is 100 km thick (and that\'s being rather
generous).  So, our rock will be in the atmosphere for 100 km / 30,000
km/s or about 3 milliseconds before hitting the surface.  There\'s not
enough time to do more than singe the outer layers of the rock.

        I think the scenario you have scetched above is _exactly_ why the 
Imperium has chosen to standardize freight rates across the Empire.  If 
they did not, all those little backwater worlds would be at the mercy of 
traders and shipping companies who could gouge them at will, particularly 
when lives are at stake, as in your example.

	I agree that the fixed Imperial freight rate should be dependent 
on the factors you mention.  1000Cr should probably be the rate between 
two Class A starports.  For TNE I ran a lot of numbers for a merchant 
campaign I am working on with some other folks on the list, and found 
that with a big, integrated shipping system you could actually make 
money on 1000Cr/Td.  But such a system only works between hi-pop worlds 
with a lot of regular trade.  The Empire also knew this and knew that 
the outer reaches of the empire (which most needed trade to bring them 
into the Imperial fold) could not support such a system and that Free 
Traders could not make any money at the 1000Cr/Td rate.  That is 
why subsidized merchants were invented.  Since they only have to give 
half their gross to the Empire, rather than pay a mortgage, they can 
actually do quite well at 1000Cr/Td.  
	For the kind of trading at E class starports and whatnot that Free 
Traders do, 1000Cr/Td just is not going to cut it.  What I think should 
happen is that the rate should be modified by the factors you mention, 
shipping and receiving starport, delivery time, Zones.  But since the 
empire has chartered subsidized merchants to encourage trade I think 
they should have to charge the flat 1000Cr/Td anywhere on their 
assigned route.  This reduces the disincentive to private shippers 
created by subsidized merchants but also encourages them to move off 
the beaten path, which is, after all, where Free Traders belong.
	Oh yeah, negotiating skill might only come in for the planet-dweller 
to _lower_ the price from the official rate.  If a subsidized merchant 
was scheduled to come into the system soon, then he might convince the 
Free Trader that he was willing to wait to get the subsidized rate.

Yes, but how realistic is this...  I mean the Imperium lets 
dictatorships exist with impunity.  Heck, they\'ll even let 1 system 
invade another, as long as they don\'t use nukes to do so.  What makes 
you think that your average subsector duke is going to give a rip 
because a trader decides to triple the cargo rate from an E-class 
starport to an A class starport...

And even if the Imperium can regulate rates, they can\'t control the 
market.  If I\'m a trader, under the current rules, I have NO 
incentive to jump into an E class port.  Because they generally are 
going to have less goods to ship, I\'m usually going to wind up 
leaving with a half empty hold, and I\'m not going to be able to make 
extra cash to compensate for that.  

The Imperium is so high and mighty about keeping the shipping rates 
at Cr1000/ton, but they don\'t give a rip if I bought say a cargo hold 
full of electronic equipment at a cheap price, from a high tech 
industrial world where computers are included in boxes of cereal, and 
take it to that same backwater world, and jack the price up 400%.

I guess what I\'m trying to say is that there should not be a FIXED 
Imperial freight rate.  Maybe a maximum and a minimum, varied by a 
great number of factors and a little bit of random chance.  Cr 1000 
would work as a minimum, but not as a maximum...

You\'re going against the face of logic to some extent with this 
argument...  Trade between high pop, high value worlds, aren\'t going 
to be serviced by free traders or subsidized merchants.  They\'re 
going to be served by the bulk carriers, the megacorps...

Free traders and subsidized merchants are going to exist at the 
fringes.  Yes subsidized ships should have the edge in the backwaters 
(they are after all being subsidized to serve the backwaters), but 
free traders should be able to make money too.  Otherwise, there is 
no reason for free traders to exist...  A fixed, 1 size fits all in 
every circumstance shipping rate just doesn\'t work in a capitalist 
system, which is what we are led to believe the Imperium is...  It 
doesn\'t exist on Earth, with instantaneous communication, and next 
day shipping, and it has even less of a chance of existing in a 
far-flung, star spanning empire with no FTL communications, and next 
week shipping if you\'re really, really, lucky...good intentions of an 
Empire in regulating commerce or not...

This part, at least I agree with.  1 point though, C, D & E class starports 
AREN\'T on the beaten path...

Not going to be the case when time pressures come into it, and not 
for backwater D&E ports, where ship arrivals are still a relatively 
infrequent thing...

I\'ve been arguing this for a while.  A while back we had a discussion going
about starship construction times, and some of the folks on the list kept
wanting to compare the construct times of starships with 747\'s.  Sorry, not
a good comparison.  Cynthis is right, ships and subs make for a better
example, the only problem with subs is when have you seen a civillian
submarine? ;)

Being in the marine construction industry, I can say that this is true.
However, the groups that we deal with are companies large enough to purchase
multiple ships.  Rarely do we build a first ship for someone.  I would
immagine that a smaller company with a smaller ship would readily crosstrain
people.  When you think of the number of people it takes to run a ship, it
doesn\'t seem like a small fledgling company (or individual) trying to make a
living (much less a profit) out of shipping cargo is not likely to have a
full crew complement.

On the other hand, this one ship is the whole world for this little company
(or individual).  I would not be surprised to see a skilled and
knowledgeable(sp) engineer on the ship because the very life of the owner
depends on the maintenance of the ship.  A single engineer is not a problem
or issue.  I think any jump capeable ship will have at least (minimal) a
crew of three: Pilot, Astrogator(navigator), and Engineer.  Add passengers
and you\'l need a Steward.  In system craft under 200 tons could probably get
by with a crew of two: Pilot and Engineer.

I\'m not sure there\'s been much arguement about military ships, everyone
tends to agree that they will be fully manned, I think the disagreement is
over civvies!!

  I haven\'t noticed any lack of CT/MT talk on the TML.  The Traveller list
covers all Traveller, CT to T4.

I agree.  T4 fits the TML charter, not the Xboat charter.  As a general
rule, I only post to xboat when responding to a thread that was only
on xboat.  All other Traveller posts, CT to T4, go to the TML.

I\'ve wondered when someone was going to comment on this.  Yes, busting
the big rock would make small rock, but how destructive they would be
depends on just how small the small rocks were. How many tons of rock
falls on Earth every year...causing minor to no damage?  

So, if you want to break up the big rock make sure you also break up
the medium size chucks, and the small hunks...pebbles the atomosphere
can deal with.

Of course, the original idea had 1 g/m^3, spread over some thousands
of km, right?  So the boulder and it\'s resulting chunks would collide
with *hundred* (if not thousands) of these grains of sand....

>B) You\'d create your own navigational hazard with all that stuff
>floating  around your world.

There would have to be lanes, channels to travel through going out and
in.  This is analogious to many harbors..I recall from my history that
ports often defended themselves from opposing fleets using sand bars
to make it difficult to sail in, requiring a harbor pilot.  In this
situation, a fleet wouldn\'t "run aground", but it might require them
to slow down, making it much easier for the planet based guns to pound
them.

Frankly, this is very interesting idea on several levels.  I don\'t
know how realistic it is, but it bears consideration.

Someone else (I\'m sorry but I can\'t remember who) also mentioned the comparisons
between starships and automobiles, stating that the commonality of starships in
the Traveller universe is on par (?) with auto ownership today.  These ships
cost in excess of MCr30+ (or the equivilent of 6,304+ TNE Ground Cars) at the
very least and the only people that seem to have one are legitimate businesses

the commercial fisherman or helicopter tour operator in regards to cost,

Interstellar trading has been part of Traveller since the beginning. The
original system described in Book 2 of Classic Traveller provided for
specific trade goods with individually varying values. The later Book 7
(Merchant Prince) system changed this to generic goods differentiated only on
their sourceworld. 

Being Nicholas van Rijn fans, my group preferred the original system. Using
an idea from FASA\'s Merchant Class Ships, we created a trade system based on
unique trade tables for every world. These tables allow individual economies
to appear, without slowing down the game session. (All the world of creating
a table is done between sessions, just as with animal encounter tables.) 

Enhanced Trading

The successful trader buys low and sells high. Anything else leads to
bankruptcy. 

That said, the purpose of trading in Traveller is to have fun. Trading should
never be a mechanical process of rolling dice and calculating financial
statements. If trading is not a core element in the current adventure, then
use the basic trade rules (ie. Merchant Prince/MegaTraveller). These enhanced
rules are intended to add greater flavour, variety, and most importantly
chances for adventure. 

Trading Process

The mechanics of trading are handled by tasks. However, the referee should
strive to integrate these into the adventure, rather than making them simple
die-roll hurdles to be overcome. 

Task Difficulty

The ease with which goods can be moved is governed by the size of the
economy. To reflect this, many tasks have a difficulty of \'<population>\',
which means that the task difficulty is based on the population code as
follows:
     Lo     Difficult
     Mod     Routine
     Hi     Simple

Any of the following steps can be turned into an adventure: 

1.     Find a possible cargo
2.     Negotiate a price
3.     Load the cargo
4.     Jump to another system
5.     Find a potential buyer
6.     Negotiate a price
7.     Unload the cargo
8.     Collect payment

Finding a cargo

The first step is to find a decent cargo. This system assumed that there are
many possible cargos, but the players are looking for something with
extraordinary profit potential. As well, regular shipments of standard items
will, in settled space, probably be carried by a regular freighter with a
contract (ie. a subsidized liner). Thus, what the players are picking up are
the fortuitous crumbs of trade that slip between the megacorporations\'
fingers. 

To find a potential cargo:
<population>.  Trading, Streetwise. 3 hours.
Referee:  Several characters can pool their efforts. Use the highest skill in
each catagory for the success roll, but total all skills for the time roll.
(The extra help means several leads can be followed up simultaneously.) 

Notice that finding a cargo will, on average, occupy a single individual for
most of a week. If a cargo is not found, or if the players do not like the
one they do find, another attempt can be made with the usual penalties for
retrying. 

If the players find a cargo, choose one from the world\'s trade table. 

Negotiating a price

Once a cargo is found, then a price must be negotiated. While this will, in
many cases, be the lowest one possible, circumstances might warrant paying a
bit more. Possibly the players feel sorry for a real hard-luck case. Possibly
they want to cement an ongoing business arrangement. Possibly they learn that
the seller has a cousin in the starport engineering department...

Canny players will want to investigate the goods (and the seller) before
making a deal. Possibly the goods are defective, or stolen. Possibly ...

To investigate the goods:
Routine. Admin/Legal, appropriate skill. 15 minutes. (uncertain)
Referee:  An appropriate skill is one that relates to the goods being bought.
Gravitics for grav modules, Prospecting for ores, and so on. 

Rather than a task, a simple die roll is used to set a price. Roll two dice,
modified by all appropriate factors, on the actual value table and multiply
the base cost by the indicated amount. The Bargaining skill of the players\'
negotiator is a negative modifier (tends to lower cost); the Bargaining skill
of the seller\' negotiator is a positive modifier (tends to increase cost). 

Loading the cargo

This is relatively straightforward, unless the cargo has special requirements
or is illegal. In each case the referee must adjudicate the requirements.
Don\'t be afraid to use a bit of humour; after all, players who have bought
2000 live rabbits without the cages deserve everything coming to them! 

One enhancement I use is to make the players pack their cargo hold. To do
this I use deck plans and cardboard templates. After a couple of days spent
loading sacks of grain (by hand - because the low-tech cargo robot kept
tearing the sacks) my players invested in a couple of standard shipping
containers.

Jumping to another system

Covered in other rules (specifically Starship Operators Manual). 

Finding a potential buyer

Posting a notice on the starport computer net will probably find a buyer, but
a better price can be obtained with a little salesmanship. 

To find a potential buyer:
<population>.  Trading, Streetwise. 3 hours.

Referee:  Several characters can pool their efforts. Use the highest skill in
each catagory for the success roll, but total all skills for the time roll.
(The extra help means several leads can be followed up simultaneously.) 

Notice that selling a cargo will, on average, occupy a single individual for
most of a week. If a cargo is not found, or if the players do not like the
one they do find, another attempt can be made with the usual penalties for
retrying. 

Negotiating a price

Once a buyer is found, then a price must be negotiated. While this will, in
many cases, be the highest one possible, circumstances might warrant paying a
bit more. Possibly the players feel sorry for a real hard-luck case. Possibly
they want to cement an ongoing business arrangement. Possibly they learn that
the seller has a cousin in the starport engineering department...

Canny players will want to investigate the seller before making a deal. Do
they always pay on time?

To investigate the buyer:
Routine. Admin/Legal, Streetwise. 15 minutes. (uncertain)

Rather than a task, a simple die roll is used to set a price. Roll two dice,
modified by all appropriate factors, on the actual value table and multiply
the base price by the indicated amount. The Bargaining skill of the players\'
negotiator is a positive modifier (tends to increase price); the Bargaining
skill of the seller\' negotiator is a negative modifier (tends to decrease
price). 

Unloading the cargo

As with loading, this is relatively straightforward, unless the cargo has
special requirements or is illegal. In each case the referee must adjudicate
the requirements. Illegal cargos should certainly be role-played! 

Collecting the payment

Again, this should be relatively straightforward. However, don\'t neglect the
fun of individual planetary currencies. Difranian marks are probably not
legal tender off-planet, so the players may be forced into buying another
speculative cargo...

Example Trading Session

The players\' starship is grounded at Genese on Echiste, a water-world in
Lanth/Spinward Marches. While the engineer overhauls the jump drive, the
pursor heads into town to look for a profitable cargo. 

Echiste is a low population world, making this a Difficult task (11+). The
pursor has Trading-3 and Streetwise-3. The referee rolls a 5 for success;
only her high skills let the pursor find cargo here. The time roll is 16
(less 6 for skills) for a total of 30 hours. The pursor is in a hurry,
working 10-hour days, so it will be three days before she finds a cargo. 

Rather than simply rolling the dice and annoncing the result, the referee
describes the startown district and general flavour of Genese , giving a
brief but vivid description of how weary the pursor is trotting after leads,
visiting grungy warehouses, and so forth. The referee rolls for encounters,
and on the third day gets a street gang. Sensing an opportunity for
adventure, he improvises. 

"On your way back from talking to M. LeFarge, one of seedier local sashimi
brokers, you see a scruffy man, mid-forties, ringed by leather-clad young
punks. \'Donnez moi, gramps,\' snarls the leader as he swings a chain."

The pursor is feeling heroic. "I pull out my deck-sweeper, fire a round into
the ground, then cover the gang. \'Another day, boys,\' I smile. \'You\'re up
past your bedtime.\' I jerk the muzzle down the passage."

The referee quickly rolls a morale check for the gang. They fail. "They glare
at you, but back away. \'Another day, midons,\' growls the leader, \'another
day.\' They rumble down the passage, making out like they were leaving anyway.

"Their victim breathes a sigh of relief. \'Merci beaucoup, madamoiselle, je
pense que j\'ai morte.\' He notices your shipsuit. \'Ah, vous etes une voyageur!
Please to excuse my manners. I am Jean-Guy Morseau, a simple coureur des
fonds waylaid while peddling my poisson-fue. I have much for to thank you;
this trip I capture deux - \'ow you say, two? But of course, I must buy you a
drink. Come, my cousine has a little bistro...\' He leads you off..."

The contact is made. Poisson-fue is a delicacy, live animals bringing a
premium price on Regina. And who better to teach the players how to keep one
alive than Jean-Guy? 

*Note: Poisson-fue is detailed in a 20-page writeup on Echiste I did before
my players visited it. (I had more time in those days.)

Some fellow here in Vancouver has just bought a decommissioned Foxtrox 
class sub.  They plan to tow it from Vladivostok to Vancouver, 30 days 
then open it up as a tourist attraction.  I think that was actually Pat 
Watson who wanted to buy the sub.

Sorry.  Just thought I\'d let you know.

Well a few weeks ago, I wrote a message about rouge nests of Hivers. (I
was calling them Shadow Nests) Some Hivers feel that humans are too
dangerous, and there are too many of them to succesfully manipulate. 
So they are preforming their own manipulations to destroy the RC.  More
extreme Hivers want to exterminate all the humans.  

Hmmm how about the Hiver observer on the Ashtabula was really an agent
for one of these shadow nests, and he either sabatoged the ship, to
destroy RC morale, or prevent them from finding out about the Shadow
Nests, or maybe they captured the Ashtabula, so they could go around
pretending to be the RC, and ruin its good name, by conducting all
sorts of black ops, assasinations, kidnapping, pilliaging. You know the
normal Smash and Grab operations, but this time against nice people,
instead of evil TEDs. Maybe the crew is now being experimented on by
Hivers. Hmmm I kind of like this idea.
  
Well I\'ll stop rambling.

Gee!  Where do *you* buy your soda?  I never pay more than
$1.50/bottle, usually I can get a 2 liter for under a dollar, but
let\'s say for some reason you\'re pop wholesales to you at $1.50, so...

...200*1.5= $300 not $1000!

BTW, 200 per ton eyeballs as much too low let me figure...I took some
measurements and it looks like a 2 liter bottle is about 10x32cm.
Let\'s say you could get 9x9x3 bottles per M^3 so..

9x9x3x14=3402, let\'s drop that to 3200 to cover wasted volumn and
shipping materials

3200*1.5 = $4800 not $300 or $1000

At wholesale of $.50/bottle the cost is still $1600.

...and where do you buy your weapons?  <g> 

$4000/84=$47.62 each!  

(Of course this is better than the $12/weapon you\'d pay at $1000/dt.)

ACR\'s wouldn\'t be that cheap, even at wholesale, would they? I\'d guess
$100 each giving $8400/dt.

Now Pop is $1600/dt and Popguns are $8400/dt, still quite a nice
spread.  <g>

Developing things like this!  For example, thats\'s where the ship

Yes, but I suspect it\'ll get a name change when Wildstar gets around

Same stuff as here, but there seems to be a more technical edge.

It appears several of us are working on various things, but in the

NO!  NO!  I don\'t assume Windows, and I hope some of the neat ideas
floating around aren\'t going to be tied to just one environment.

I run OS/2, so I can run DOS & Window3.1 stuff too.  I can\'t run ,or

Macintosh or Amiga folks I know can run DOS programs through emulation
at least, so DOS is still the common demominator.

:Character Generation rules are radically different, as well as ship

   I don\'t know if I\'d go that far. The character system is still built
   on a range of 1-15, and the skill granularity has changed but
   characters can be converted. On the whole the character gen system
   is an improvement because 1) It\'s easier on the ref to arbitrate
   skills use, and 2) the available character classes actually have
   a broader range than CT/MT with richer skill bases to choose from -
   characters are no longer the 2D cutouts they used to be in CT.

   Space Combat is somehwat Kludgy, but no matter what you do here
   somebody is going to be unhappy. Make it complex and people scream,
   make it simple and purists (like me) scream.

:All in all a drastic change in system.  More importantly to old line
:players, there is a much bigger emphasis on military adventures...
:2 sample adventures are included, both of which are very military
:oriented, the character generation system even requires the players
:to be given call signs.

   I agree the RC has a more military leaning (I haven\'t seen any
   Regency stuff, so I can\'t comment there) but I can\'t see the two
   adventures in the rulebook as being particularly militaristic.

   In fact, despite being pretty militaristic on the surface, the RC
   background is excellent for traditional adventuring. Avoid "Smash
   and Grab" and the RC Equipment Book and you still have "Path of
   Tears" which is an AWESOME source of world info and RC background
   that can be used for *traditional* Traveller adventuring - survey,
   recover "treasure" (artifacts), intrigue, competing with "wilds"
   free traders...in fact there is no reason for the players to get
   involved with the RC at all. You could paint the RC as the Heavies
   and play appropriately, while the players struggle in their worn
   out hand-me-down Free Trader.

   *SPOILER WARNING*

   "Vampire Fleets" starts out military, but the players get stripped
   of their equipment fairly early, and it rapidly turns into a
   traditional traveller adventure with wheels within wheels and
   role-playing remaining central to the game.

:A lot of people objected to Virus.  I personally do not.  My only
:real beef with TNE was that it looked too much like Twilight: 2000
:with spaceships...  That and the fact that it was not backwards

   Virus *really* stretches believability, but after getting used to
   it I actually like the adventure possiblities. Virus adds a *major*
   source of tension and conflict, and creates an atmosphere of
   adventure that\'s hard to do in CT, with it\'s fairly sterile
   uniform background.

I must admit the first time I heard the virus thing I was kind of 
skeptical, but after that the consept began to grow on me.  Virus can be 
used to spaw multiple adventures using all kinds of role playing styles. 
 Want a fantasy adventure, virus is in control of a medival theme park.  
The possiblitities are endless.  Virus is wierdness and that\'s the best 
way to describe it.

Well... I would think to get an idea about how slow communications lines
would affect corporations spread over interstellar distances, all you\'d need
to do is read up on how big business was affected by being spread over
global distances in the days of sailing ships.   Fortunes could be made or
lost depending on how fast your ships could get your goods to market.  

Typicaly the first one to market with a commodity made the most money in
that commodity. As more merchants showed up with their goods and the supply
increased the prices fell and the profit margin was reduced.

True.  But most of the stuff raining down on our planet isn\'t travelling at the
discussed 0.1c.  We are dealing with a LOT of kinetic energy.  The Trin\'s Veil
scenario discussed earlier suggests placing a field of debris 50,000 km from the
center of the planet.  That\'s still only 1/6 of a light-second away.  Objects
travelling at 0.1c will traverse this distance in about a second and a half (not
much time at all).  The asteroid might be vapourized, but the debris still has
mass and will still stike the atmosphere/surface with the same amount of force
(similar to HEAP rounds or plasma/fusion slugs from plasma or fusion guns).

There is no debating this math.  However, for the Trin\'s Veil scenario to work,
the radius of the sphere would have to be much, much greater to affect a
determined asteroid from reaching the surface.  The spacing of the debris would
also have to be tight, to minimize the chances of a miss occuring.

>From Galen Sendati\'s \'Thus the Cause - An investigation into the emergence
of the Solomani Movement\'  (Imperial Press, 1004):

\'While many commentators point to Zhakirov\'s marriage to Antiama
Shuulingishi (sp?) as the defining moment that brought about the rise in
Solomani militancy, it\'s obvious power over many ethnic Solomani begs a more
dtailed explanation.

To examine the origins of their Cause, one must look at the historical
conditions of the Solomani.  Consider the Old Earth Union - by the time of
it\'s absorption into the Imperium in 588, the Union was a feeble polity,
dependant on the Imperium for it\'s defense and prosperity.  The Imperium had
defended the Union against Aslan incursions during the Border Wars, subtly
ensuring the Union\'s dependence following the Peace of Ftalahr (sp?).

It was a situation that galled many prominent Solomani in 588.  Far from the
dynamic, all-conquering champions that defeated the Vilani and established
the Rule of Man, the Solomani felt themselves to be weak, cautious and
hidebound by traditions that, while perhaps necessary during the Long Night,
were outmoded and restrictive.  For a race so highly charged with ethnic
dynamism, it was perhaps inevitable that a radical new approach would be sought.

Even as Solomani interests dominated the Imperial Court to Zhakirov\'s
marriage, almost unconsiously, a few malcontents despised the increasing
cosmopolitanism of the Imperium. Until 740, they could achieve their ends
from within the system.  Afterwards, they rejected both the Imperium and
their own traditions - striking a new path that would culminate in the Rim
War, a disaster that was unavoidable from the moment the first Imperial
squadrons rushed to the defense of the Old Earth Union.

It doesn\'t pay to underestimate Solomani.  Despite their faults - the
inherent obnoxiouness of their cause, their myopic racism and specism, and
their stubborn refusal to compromise, they draw deep from the reserves of
their people.  They will sacrifice themselves for causes that seem hopeless
to the average Imperial, and they never forget a wrongdoing - real or
perceived.  The popular press dismisses the Solomani as bumbling fanatics -
but with my own eyes I have seen them perform acts of daring, ingenuity,
courage and sacrifice that run counter to the popular perception.

No, do not underestimate them - even the capture of their homeworld could
not break their spirit.  Acknowledge their strengths, exploit their
weaknesses, and dont _ever_ turn your back on them.\'

 (Note:  The following is not canon [unless MM wishes it to be].
 It is merely what I feel is a reasonable summary of what might
 have happened to convert a federal organization into an Imperial
 one.

 The Sylean Federation government was organized using a variation
 on an ancient Terran model.  The Government was divided into
 three parts:

 The Executive Committee was ultimately responsible for ensuring
 the proper execution of Federation law; a bureaucracy under their
 direction was responsible for the administrative affairs thereof.
 Nominally, the Senior Member of the Committee was both Head of
 State and Head of Government; in practice, the Committee acted to
 ensure that no one member had greater public prominence than any
 of the other, and that none had more prominence than the Committee
 as a whole.  This resulted in quite a lot of in-fighting, and
 almost every Committee action was a compromise of ill-will -
 including the frequent selection of the High Judicar as the
 representative of the Government at functions requiring the
 presence of the Head of State, and in announcing decisions and
 actions of the Committee and of the Senad.

 The High Judicar was the final arbiter of justice; all Federation
 courts were ultimately responsible to him.  The frequent
 representations as head-of-state asked of him by the ExComm
 associated the position with that of head-of-state; in -120, the
 ExComm, wishing to eliminate the bickering over the issue of
 representation of the Federation at state occasions, voted to make
 this selection permanent, ceding all Head-of-State duties to the
 High Judicar.

 The legislative powers of the Federation were vested in a Senad
 [sic] composed of one person from each member planet, selected in
 a manner chosen by the member planet.  Legislation developed by
 the Senad was sent to the ExComm for approval (signature of the
 Head of Government).  During the last decades of the Federation,
 an economic crisis due to Federation expansion beyond its capacity
 to cope resulted in attempts to pass "emergency" legislation in
 the "public interest".  Much of this legislation was directly
 counter to many of the governing documents of the Federation; by
 -50 challenges to any legislation passed by the Senad had become
 routine, and by -35 all legislation was routinely submitted to
 the High Judicar for an opinion on its legality.  If the High
 Judicar found no legal problems with the legislation, he would
 forward it to the ExComm for final approval.

 In -15, the industrialist Cleon Zhunastu was elected to the post
 of High Judicar.  He was a charismatic individual, and was able to
 draw much support to the Federation government at the time.  In
 -12, taking advantage of an unrealized loophole in the Federation
 Charter, he was elected to ExComm, while maintaining his position
 as High Judicar.  He used the powers of both offices to block any
 attempt to close the loophole, and won re-election to both
 positions in -10 and -7.  Since he was the only member of the
 ExComm to be re-elected in that term, he became de jure both head
 of state and head of government.  In this term, he began setting
 up and/or reorganizing the organizations and bureaux that would
 eventually become much of the Imperial bureaucracy.  In -5 and -2,
 he was elected to unprecedented third terms in both offices, due
 to policies that brought prosperity to many Federation planets,
 while still allowing for continued expansion of the Federation.
 Only months before the election of year 0, he staged a bloodless
 coup-d\'tat, proclaiming himself Emperor, with the support of the
 Senad (all of whose members had been promised significant
 concessions and titles of nobility under the new Imperium, as a
 quid-pro-quo for their support).  Legal challenges were (in
 accordance with the Federation Charter) brought before the Senad
 (as the High Judicar was a party to the action), who generally
 refused to hear the cases, saying, in effect, that the challenges
 were moot, what was done was done. The Senad was referred to
 derisively as "the moot" in the press; Emperor Cleon\'s public
 relations specialists dug into some old dictionaries, and started
 using (and publicly defining) the term "moot" according to
 ancient Terran usage, which developed into the meaning that it has
 today.

        I just figured out that the trick to avoid taking (serious) damage
on something like this scenario is to have no more than 5% (or similarly
small percentage) of your securities floated on any one planetary
exchange...  This would degrade over time (especially with those nasty
bearer shares!), although you could have timed compulsory buybacks (shares
expire after a certain period of time and you\'d have to issue some more to
cover the cost of the buyback; I have no idea of the financial side effects
this would have yet) to get them out of circulation and redistribute the
equity around the various exchanges again.  Hm....

        Just one point: once the stock has been issued, what happens is that
an underwriting firm or syndicate of firms has bought the issue lock stock
and barrel, and then proceeded to sell it to the unsuspecting greedheads...
er, investing public.  The company, unless it underestimated development
costs, therefore already has all the capital it needs, and stock price won\'t
affect its ability to develop the product.

        Of course, if its stock tanks and it\'s got a valuable asset like the
process you describe, or if it is otherwise fundamentally sound, that just
spells potential hostile (or otherwise) takeover, \'cause then its a bargain.
Of course, poison pills and other takeover defences will probably have
evolved enormously by then :).

        Agreed.  I think that from a regulation point of view, you\'re going
to see one of two scenarios: either Commando Securities Commissions From
Hell, or utter laxness.  Both could get interesting; Regulators in
Battledress(tm) could make interesting adversaries as they (mistakenly or
not) try to prosecute/persecute the PCs for imagined market manipulations...
OTOH, laxness could lead to interesting shananigans/intimidation of yuppies :).

MGs can be LONG-RANGE weapons if you build the tunnel long enough.  
You\'re right about the lasers, though, unless you impose the TL*50 
discharge energy rule, which keeps them from wrecking established canon 
regarding starship design and combat (I mean -- what\'s the point of using 
anything else?).  I think that the thread would be dead by now, if it 
weren\'t for the occasional interjection of poorly-researched or downright

[Bruce goes on to note that at higher TLs, other systems which offer a 
 better chance of detecting neutrinos, including those utilizing nuclear
 damper technology, could be used, resulting in smaller detectors with
 a better chance of picking up the low-level buggers which are the 
 byproduct of fusion plant operation per unit volume]

Good point.  Those ARE contemporary figures I cited.  However, if I AM 
going to have to rely on a deus ex machina (did I figure your 
abbreviation right?) to make neutrino sensors useful for starship combat 
situations, I don\'t want to go and take the liberties that previous 
systems have taken with them ("I\'ll sniff out that fusion flashlight at 2 
AU!") -- I prefer to think of them only being capable of reliably 
locating an average-sized (100 Mw) fusion plant at relatively short space 
combat ranges.  That way, my previous comments regarding them and deep 
meson sites stand, DMS canon (a la TNE) is more or less maintained, and 
we can finally see an end to that goddamn thread.  I don\'t want to send 
you scurrying back to your calculator, but how much DENSER 
(damper-manipulated or otherwise) would your detection medium have to be 
in order to pick up, say, 1 neutrino a minute from a 100 Mw fusion source 
utilizing a one (displacement) ton (14 m^3) detector?  Or am I just 
asking the wrong guy?

This doesn\'t answer your question about necessary depth to get fuel, but I
think that the scene in 2010 when they use Jupiter\'s gravity to slingshot
out to Saturn (I think those planets) conveys what it\'s like to go through
the outer edge of a GG atmosphere.

Or, 2m x 2m x 3.5m.  I should have clarified:  When I said "my car," I 
meant 1988 Toyota Corolla FX, not 1977 Cadillac Coupe De Ville.  Of 
course, if I *shoved* three of my cars into the aforementioned space, at 
least one of them would probably not be driveable afterwards.  Still, I\'m 
sure that we can agree that 14 m^3 is A Lot of Stuff, so I think that my 
previous point (did I have one?) still holds.

Now, were these currency carriers "average Joes," like a typical Free 
Trader who just happened to wander into port looking for freight, or were 
these people with some credentials?  You know, bonds, certification, 
extensive background checks, and not a little official oversight?  The people 
handling this stuff might be civilians, but not as ordinary as "Joe Free 
Trader."  What hacked me off originally is that there are more 
restrictions placed on a Free Trader wanting to handle mail than there 
were on one wanting to haul somebody else\'s currency.

Don\'t need to.  You\'ve already pointed out a factor of four difference in 
"base cost" between two different potential cargos.  I could have picked 
a more radical difference, such as the cost-per-ton of precious gemstones 
as opposed to simple mineral ore.

I would think a sheaf of rice.  Far more rice is consumed on Terra today,
and will be by 2400, than wheat.  Two or three thousand-odd years after
that, it\'ll be rice in a thousand genetically-engineered forms that people
will think of when they think of new agricultural worlds.

        I agree to an extent.  Really well-printed bearer securities with
some sort of fairly foolproof authentication from the regulators on the
planet of origin might be saleable at a discount, but otherwise, the only
people that would be traded in multiple planetary exchanges are the really
big corps that everyone knows about.

        Interesting angle.  For the book entry stuff, all that really
matters is that someone communicates to the company "Shareholder X just
transferred Y% of her interest in the company to individual Z on such and
such a date and such and such a place"; encrypted electronic storage would
work just as well as paper or phone or whatever as a medium to transmit it
the message.

        However, a share is just ownership of a chunk of a company, and
share certificates are just a way of evidencing that the share exists.
Thus, you could see bearer shares existing in non-paper form.  [bear with
me, mental gears are grinding as I write]  So, in this case, the
encryption/password protection would be authentification a) of the validity
of the electronically-incarnated bearer share, and b), the validity of the
transfer of the share; the role of the brokerage would simply be to certify
that the transfer was on the up & up.

        Makes sense.  You could still get the usual bearer-share problems,
only it\'d be much more difficult to steal or forge them.  However, if
someone managed to crack the encryption scheme..>:).  

        What would make for a real kicker of a plot motor would be someone
stealing the Master Encryption Key for the (hypothetical) Imperial
Securities Commission and is busily stealing/forging bearer shares and
making a killing.  This would severely undermine confidence in the integrity
of capital markets throughout the Imperium, possibly causing a market crash
of truly astronomical proportions and economic chaos and depression on an
Imperium-wide scale (hey... and there I was thinking dropping rocks was
brutally cool chaos & destruction) and so the ISC send out the players to
catch the miscreant.

        I wonder what the ISC logo would look like... The imperial shield,
with two rampant yuppies yoked, argent, on the lower portion :)?

        The thing is is that we\'re not talking about commodities here, but
rather corporate securities.  There\'s a world of difference; what gives a
share its value is the underlying worth of the company as a whole (and
therefore its potential to provide regular dividends), not just consumer
demand and vagaies in supply.  Information about the company in question can
affect the market value (not neccessrily the true value) of the stock.
Today, with electronic communications, some people trade stocks on different
exchanges, making their money of the minor (sometimes as low as fractions of
a cent per share) fluctuations in value that exist for brief windows of time.

        Throw in an absence of FTL communication, and things could get
pretty interesting...

 	Well, first of all, a worlds government type is considered to be 
 an internal matter, just like freight rates between cities on a world are 
 an internal matter.  Secondly, I was under the impression that 
 interstellar wars were strictly forbidden by the Empire, nukes or not.  
 The reason the subsector duke cares is because the Empire exists to knit 
 its disparate member worlds together.  One of the most effective ways to 
 do this is trade.  If Free Traders singly or in groups (a la the Guild) 
 are artificially raising rates such that the economic cohesiveness of his 
 subsector is affected, then hed be concerned.

 	Thats true.  Its one of the unfortunate problems of interfering 
 with the interstellar economy by subsidizing ships and so on.  Note that 
 having subsidized ships is as big if not a bigger disincetive to free 
 traders because those folks can undercut your price so much because they 
 dont have to pay a mortgage.
 	The solution, as I suggested before, though perhaps not clearly 
 enough, is to have fixed rates, but rates which vary by situation.  
 1000Cr would be the price ceiling on freight between A&B starports.  
 Maybe 1250 for C ports and 1750 for E ports, or whatever.
 	One big advantage for Free Traders going to out of the way places 
 like E and C ports is that they are not going to be serviced regularly by 
 the big lines, so rather than having to pick up the crumbs left by 
 Tukera, they get to be the main engines of interstellar commerce.  This 
 means there will almost _always_ be plenty of freight at these locations 
 for small fry like free traders.
 	The other big incentive to stay away from the big worlds is that 
 free traders are simply not competitive in these places.  When I get a 
 chance I will dig out the freight hauling system that I came up with that 
 allows big shipping companies to make money at a little over 500Cr/Td.

 	There are two responses to this.  First, yes, this is somewhat 
 inconsistent, but that is what happens when you mess with the free 
 market.  The second is that arbitrage opportunities like this are exactly 
 what "gains from trade" are all about.  You make a big proft, which gives 
 you and other people an incentive to keep on that trade route until 
 enough people enter and the price comes down to competitive levels.
 Discovering and exploiting those opportunities is what Free Traders are 
 for.  The important point is that with low freight rates, even people who 
 do not own ships can import computers and make money -- without the 
 shipping companies stealing all the profit.  The situation is analogous 
 to the late 19th Century when everyone hated the railroads for exploiting 
 their privelaged position.  The answer chosen at the time was government 
 regulation.  The Empire seems to have taken a similar approach to 
 interstellar shipping.

 	We are in agreement here.  1000Cr would be the lowest rate.  
 Higher rates would exist for more out of the way places, like E class ports.

 	Precisely my point.  And all the more reason for Free Traders to 
 go off to the E ports where they can compete and not get squashed by the 
 big boys.

 	I know what you are getting at.  Free trade is often the best 
 solution, and I am _not_ saying that fixed rates is necessarily the best 
 policy for the empire to pursue, but it is the one which it appears to 
 have pursued, along with subsidized merchants and other things.
 	From a gaming perspective, we need a way for PC.s with ships to 
 make a living.  1000Cr/Td for freight is not quite enough.  Since Free 
 Traders are the kind of ships that are going to ply out of the way 
 worlds, they need to be able to make money doing it or there wont _be_ 
 interstellar trade except that which the empire chooses to subsidize.  
 So, freight rates need to be higher in the out of the way places that 
 Free Traders are likely to go.  That said, I think we should also note 
 that Free Traders are not about freight hauling.  They _should_ be 
 carrying spec cargos to scrape by.  If for no other reason than just 
 loading up with generic freight at every port is *boring*.

I agree with both of you -- it\'s a wonderful anachronism that our 57th
Century computers can analyze and process all of the financial information
about a company in the blink of an eye and tell us the likelihood of the
company succeeding or failing (and thus whether to go long or short), but
the information is known to be weeks or more out of date, and the securities
themselves are trading like cash.  I\'m going to be running securities fraud
scams in my games while I sue on them in real life.

Perfectly forged electronically encrytped computer-readable files? yes, it

Scenario number 4:  Purchasers of New Company\'s stock during the time of
Scenarios 2 and 3 institute a class action securities fraud lawsuit against
Megacorp.  Wily plaintiffs\' lawyers find the PCs and offer MCr and passage
incognito to the other side of the Imperium for holorecorded (or otherwise
admissible) statements detailing Megacorp\'s scheme.  If PCs don\'t cooperate,
plaintiffs\' lawyers will have no choice but to turn them over to the
Securities and Exchange Division of the Imperial Ministry of Finance for
interrogation, detainment, criminal trial, and lengthy incarceration.

Scenario number 5:  Megacorp\'s allies in the Moot have previously "reformed"
securities fraud class actions out of existence.  A purchaser of New
Company\'s stock, distraught over the loss of life savings, spouse, home,
etc., pulls a Taxi Driver, but can\'t get into the home or office of
Megacorp\'s CEO.  He finds out about the PCs, however, and (a) starts
stalking them or (b) hires them to get him inside for revenge (as
quasi-insiders they have some access, and we\'ve already demonstrated their
amorality).  Again, if PCs don\'t cooperate, Taxi Driver will turn them over
to plaintiffs\' lawyers -- er, the SED.

Common law systems  (U.K., U.S.A., Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and
possibly some others (Jamaica, maybe)) and civil law systems (basically all
the rest of the world) give different weights to the sources of law.  Common
law systems recognize two primary sources of law:  judicial decisions which
set forth customs and practices of the society, and legislative (and
executive) enactments.  Civil law systems recognize enactments of the
legislative and executive branches of government, but basically don\'t allow
judges to establish law.

These basic differences give rise to some other important distinctions.  In
common law systems, judges review statutes to see if they are lawful; this
may or not be the case in civil law systems.  In common law systems,
statutes or other enactments are drafted rather broadly, and are interpreted
by the courts over time (i.e., a judicial gloss is put on the plain text).
In civil law systems, enactments are long and specific, and attempt to cover
every possible situation.  In general, civil law systems don\'t pay attention
to judicial gloss on statutes, and each court construes the statute as it
sees fit.

There are cultural differences, too.  In common law countries, judges are
clearly part of the society\'s elite:  They are of advanced age; they often
serve for life (U.S. federal judges, e.g.); they are mostly members of the
dominant race, ethnic group, social class, and gender; they are highly paid;
they are in the last job of their legal careers.  In civil law countries, by
contrast, judges are not so clearly part of the elite.  For example, in most
civil law countries "judge" is one of the entry-level legal positions.  A
new judge might eventually become a senior judge, or move on to other
governmental work or the private sector.  

I hope that those comments are of some help to refereeing Traveller.  I
recommend Charles Rembar, The Law of the Land, for a good discussion of what
precedent means in the common law system.

>Scottish law has a nice verdict: "not proven", giving a judge/jury a third

It\'s mealy-mouthed, cowardly crap, that defames but fails to condemn.  I\'m
glad that jurors here have to make up their minds.

It\'s only Louisiana, as far as I know.

It\'s at the opposite end of the process -- verdict as opposed to plea -- but
is a similar concept.

One of my players would agree with you there.  He\'s the guy who figured out
how to mess up those pirates in the boarding party by selectively leaving
areas of the ship pressureized (and filled with all sorts of sharp and
properly positioned objects).  Just teather the crew in place, wait until
the stuff stops flying, and then fire at will.  I guess that\'s the problem
with having former military folks on the payrole.  <G>

BTW, in my game the pirates usualy execute anybody onboard who even looks
like they might have any sort of repair skill before leaving . . . you use
less ammo, and still leave no witnesses (after the air runs out).\'

The problem I usualy have with the engineer folks getting on the crew it the
personality distribution among my players.  about 50% want to be ex-navy
traders or something onboard ship, the rest want to be
FORMER-marine-mercenary types.  (Ok guys, i guess its another active duty

Yes! <g>

A small tramp freighter might get by with a couple of folks with
engineering/technical skills, and nobody with the *title* Engineer,
but the skills *have* to be covered.  If I were the owner/operator,
I\'d skimp on something else before I skimped on having a qualified

It\'d be nice if they at least put it in there as an option.  But, if 
worst comes to worst, we can hack out our own rule, share it on some web

found that concept confusing - you know, tonne mass, displacement ton
volume...)

Anyway, what do people think?  Prices based on volume would make comparisons
between different cargos easier, prices based on lots would make calculations
for a particular cargo easier.

And should I go with cubic metres or displacement tons as the base unit of
volume?  A big advantage of kL is that it allows smaller cargos without
fractions.

As soon as I decide this I will post the completed trading system.

If the new system follows the TNE generation method character will roll a
d10 vs the current generation term.  If they roll equal to or less than that
number they automatically precipitate out into the game.  Saves you from
building a super character in theory, unless you\'re really lucky, and it
saves you from having to roll up ten characters before you get one that
lives.  This happened to me I was rolling up a character for a game and
everytime on my third or forth term the guy died.  It was terrible, like the
gods of dice were trying to tell me something.  Ten characters in a row.

:Hi all.  Have railguns been covered already as a defence against the
:infamous boulder attack?  I was around for the last rock-dropping thread,
:but haven\'t been paying that much attention to the latest one (how many
:have their been?  How far back does this go?).  If no-one\'s
:covered it, let me take a shot.

   Damn it, you beat me to the punch! I\'ve been playing with some railgun
   numbers for the past couple of days (along with DMS sites, but I
   digress...)

:Here\'s my idea:  You put a network of railguns around your world about
:100000 km out, and make the network dense enough that there\'s no more than
:10000 km between any two railguns.  If you assume a rock coming in at .1 C
:and a detection distance of one light second (this is based on Grand
:Survey\'s assertion that desitometers can detect any size of spaceship at
:500000 km), that gives you ten seconds to get something in front of the
:rock that will vaporize it on impact.  The rock\'s own velocity will
:provide most of the needed KE, so the main thing to do is get something in
:front of the rock.  You need to do this in 10 seconds and the max distance
:to cover is 5000 km.  You therefore need to launch a projectile at 500
:km/second.  Here\'s a diagram.  Each character represents about 10000 km.

   Two problems I see:

   1) Too little. A simple railgun slug of small diameter isn\'t enough -
      you\'ll frag the rock, and that\'ll make things worse. You have to
      have a big enough slug to totally vapourize *all* of the rock.

   2) Too close. You don\'t want a multi-gigaton warhead going off
      "next door".  Even if the blast does nothing, you *will* have
      widespread radiation problems. PEMS should be good for farther
      than 500,000km; this puppy is HOT from collisions with particles
      at 0.1c...

:How feasible is this?  Is the 500 km/s figure implausible?  Could rocks
:go faster than .1 C?  Sorry if all this has been covered recently...

   Not possible under FF&S rules - a TL15 railgun firing slugs, much like
   a cannon, has an MV of 10km/sec.

   I have an alternate solution; the railgun fires a _missile_ which then
   uses the initial boost to get a "leg up".  (Even better - salvo these
   puppies to guarantee a "kill".)

Fusion anti-rock missile, TL 15, MCr 10.6, 100m3, 44.2t
Warhead: KE canister submunitions (10t)
Smart Seeker, IR
Thruster: Fusion rocket 6.425g (285 g-turns)(delta-V = 5027.4 km/sec, 22hrs)
Dimensions: 3.57m(dia) x 10m(length)

Energy requirements to launch missile @10km/sec, according to FF&S:
0.0000005*44200*10000^2*1.6= ~352000MW
(yikes! Maybe we should just fire these...)

        Why wait? We weren\'t exactly "asked to input" on the ship design
sequence, we were told it was going to be HG. After quite a few people gave
IG their Cr0.02 worth, they came back and asked us to continue to input
under certain ground rules. I think it would make a great JTAS article or

        3,000km isn\'t exactly "anything in orbit" ... try to hit my Milstar
commsat at 38,400km (geosynchronous). Since starship weapons are rating in
increments of 30,000km, even a 1hex weapon would be able to plaster you
without ever being exposed.

        Not yet ... somehow they got dropped from MT to TNE. That\'s one of
the things we\'d like to put back into FF&S2.

They\'ll be going thru some *very* thin "air". More likely, the suction
created by the airstream flowing *across* the hole is going to try
sucking them out.

Remember, you can trade velocity for density. The faster you move, the
higher the *apparent* density is. So zipping thru the thin air at 50
km/s or more you\'ll get a *lot* of flow.

It turns liquid at pressures a *lot* lower than that. 

1 Atm. = 1 Bar. At 100 kbar, you have things like water turning solid,
and even hydrogen turns solid at around 1 Mbar.

But those pressures are a lot more than 1000 km down.

I seem to recall an adventure where an unco-operative "bad guy" got
left for his friends to find. He was tied up, gagged, and then someone
cheerfully stuffed a grenade under him and pulled the pin. 

As I understand it, he did a *lot* of squawking thru the gag when his
buddies started to pick him up. Of course, being "good guys" the
grenade didn\'t have a charge, just a bit of fusing. So it went "bang",
not "boom". 

I don\'t remember if anybody died from heart failure. But I\'m sure they
all needed a change of underwear. 

Booby traps are an *art*. The best ones are set up so that they are
simple enough to get the average person, but also so that if a truly
suspicious type examines them, he\'ll be able to figure out (with
difficulty) how to disarm them. Only to have the "backup" kill him.
After all, you *really* want to take out the "smart" ones.

Hey, I have *friends* that are like that in real life! 

The .357 goes *here*, the shotgun goes there, the SKS goes *there*,
the .22 goes over there, etc.

And the gunsmith/gun collector I know is really a trip. You check for
guns and knives before sitting down. And you *never* assume that a
weapon is unloaded unless it is disassembled! 

I\'ve had to make a point of asking "Is this a live grenade or one of
the practice grenades?". Then there\'s the 155mm round he uses as a
paper weight....

A *very* relevant quote:

Keep killing people and you will soon have *far* too many enemies. :-)

Not really. As a cross-check, the S-1 stage of the Saturn-V was about
1.4 Terawatts. That\'s not anything you want to be *close* to, but it\'s
hardly a major disaster.

Figure that the starport has landing "pits" about a km apart. With a
decent water deluge system, you get little damage to the pit. If water
is in short supply, then you just shovel in sand and when the ship
lifts and things have cooled down, you dig out the slag, and replace it
with more sand.

For human scale activity, terawatts are big. For natural activities,
they are *peanuts*. For example, the sunlight on a 400 km square of
land is around 120 terawatts. 

It\'s also possible (though a bit tricky) to set things up to radiate
excess heat into space. Or you can just locate the starport someplace
where the climate could use a bit of extra heat (or in someplace like
the Sahara, where nobody will *notice* the extra heat!)

Ports will tend to be set *away* from cities, for much the same reason
that airports are. Noise and hazard. You may also note that in places
that have the freedom to do so, even *seaport* docking facilities are
stuck in the industrial areas, or the outskirts of town. Especially for
things like LNG tankers (liquified natural gas, every one of these
tankers is the equivalent of a small nuke, just waiting for an excuse).

There\'ll be lots of transit facilities, as well as the "star town"
around the port. But areas near the port will definitely be the "low
rent district". All that noise and glare at all hour of the day and
night. 

BTW, I\'m a believer in the idea that "bulk" cargoes are almost *never*
sent between worlds, simply because it\'s usually much cheaper to supply
the requirements for such things locally.

That still allows for it happening in special circumstances. After all,
during the California Gold Rush they were shipping *laundry* fron
California to Honolulu and back by clipper! 

Systems with asteroid belts will be able to "mine" things much cheaper
than systems without. So that gives *some* bulk cargoes of metals and
the like. 

Some minerals (even semiprecious stones, clear down to *marble*) are
worth shipping long distances. We ship marble from Italy all over the
world, and I seem to recall hearing the same of other "decorative"
stones. 

It\'s also possible for minerals to be relatively unique. Biological
materials could be *very* unique. At least until someone finds a way to
synthesize it cheaper. And there will always be folks who think
"natural is better".

*Some* kinds of foodstuffs will be shipped. For example, coffee and tea
varies considerably in flavor depending on where they were grown. Most
people don\'t care. The ones that can appreciate the differences are
willing to pay premium prices. So "Efate Gold Coast" coffee may be a
valuable export. 

Or there may be fruits/vegetables that don\'t grow well elsewhere, but
ship ok. There\'ll be a small be steady market for those. And there\'s
always art.

BTW, if you can find copies, try reading Andre Norton\'s "Solar Queen"
series. It\'s about the crew of a Free Trader (the Solar Queen). The
books I can recall are "Plague Ship" and "Postmarked the Stars". They
give some good ideas on what would keep traders going. Plague Ship has
a good bit about the way traders can get exclusive rights to a low tech
world, and make a somewhat decent living off of unique local products. 
Postmarked the Stars has them running into problems while earning a
living on a contracted mail run. 

In fact *most* of Norton\'s sf can be used as a source for ideas. She\'s
*definitely* one of the inspirations for Traveller. 

Hmmm... y\'know, since she\'s at least *somewhat* "gaming friendly" (she
wrote book somewhat related to D&D, and has allowed some use of her
fantasy material), I wonder if she\'d allow someone to put together a
work that was somewhere between a concordance and a sourcebook. She
uses a "similar" background in much of her SF, it\'s just that not all
the stories *can* exist in the same background. :-)

Unless you are riding a "toy" motorcycle, you are talking about an
object 5 feet long, about 4 feet high, and a foot or more thick.

That works out to about 600 liters, or .6 Td.

Yes, but "real world" heraldry has things that make "slot machine

Actually, it would appear that "proper" for an asteroid varies from
gray to dark grey. Or so say all available measurements. And that "dark
grey" can be a damn close approach to "sable".

But "the right direction" is gonna be a bit vague. Also, given the

Nope. It has to be a suicide run. The target is about the size of a
football field. And moving at several percent of c relative to the
interceptor. By the time you get close enough to be relatively sure of
hitting it, it\'s too late to get out of range of the blast.

Also, if one wanted to get *real* nasty, note that graphite covered
steel spheres survived unharmed at a range of a meter or two from a
nuclear explosion. 

It\'s not that hard to create a nickel iron sphere and coat it with
graphite. Basicly, you use power from the ship to *melt* it, and let it
cool slowly (to avoid stress cracks). Then vapor deposit a layer of
graphite an inch or so thick.

In fact, this is *easier* than grappling the "rock". You can melt it
with magnetic fields, and capture the gases that boil off. And then use
the fields to tow it to speed. This way you don\'t have to neutralize
the rocks spin (which can require an amazing amount of power!)

Release a "cloud" of sand and "BBs" around it before you cut it loose,
and you\'ve just made it a *lot* harder to kill.

The mag field gear is probably standard on prospecting ships.

Impacts have several sorts of effect:

1. shockwave from atmospheric transit
2. actual impact
3. blast effects from impact
4. plasma (fireball) effects
5. earthquakes/tidal waves
6. heat radiated from impact site
7. heat transfered to atmosphere
8. particulates added to atmosphere

Shockwave damage gets *worse* until the pieces get rather small. That\'s
because the effective area hitting the atmosphere is increased.

Impact effects depend on mass and speed. So they stay the same, just
spread a bit.

Blast effects depend on a cube root of power function. So if you break
the rock into 10 smaller pieces, you get *more* damage, because things
like blast *energy* will be 1/10th the size, but crater size and blast
overpressures depend on the cube root of the energy. So instead of one
crater of radius X with a damage radius of Y, you get 10 craters of
radius .46X and damage radius .46Y. Which means you\'ve more than
doubled the *area* affected!

Fireball size depends on energy, and is a volume effect. So it works a
lot like blast effects.

Earthquakes and tidal waves will be pretty much a wash, as they depend
on impact energy.

Heat radiates faster from several smaller craters. This can be good if
it radiates into space, or bad if it gets trapped in the atmosphere.
Which brings us to an important question. Was the impact on land or
ocean? 

Land impacts create a crater and a fireball. If big enough, the
fireball can\'t rise, it just sits on the crater radiating energy into
space. Once the fireball is gone, the crater radiates heat into space,
unless there\'s lots of cloudcover (which the heat tends to disperse. If
it was big enough to punch through the crust, you get lava flows as
well. The crater will take *months* to cool unless it\'s quite small
(Meteor Crater size or smaller). There will be a lot of rock dust
scattered around.

A sea strike is a lot different. The impact creates quite a tidal wave,
and bares the seafloor for a fair distance around the crater. But in a
matter of *minutes* the water returns. A wall of water rushes in on the
crater, and instantly flashes into superheated steam. This invisible
cylinder of steam will rise into the stratosphere before spreading. And
in the process, it\'ll carry not only all the salt and whatnot that was
in the water, but most of the sediment from the seabottom, and rock
dust from the crater (as well as more dust created by the sudden
cooling of the rock). The crater floor (and any lava) is *hot*. But the
ocean is going to win unless it\'s a *very* small ocean.

So inch by inch the water is going to advance, until in a matter of
*hours* the heat from the crater has been used to vaporize cubic miles
of water, and carry gigatons of dust into the upper atmosphere. This
*will* royally screw up the weather patterns. The extra heat and water
vapor will lead to cyclones (aka huricanes and typhoons) like nothing
seen before. And the dust will lead to cooling as the sunlight is blocked.

If the pieces are *very* small, they\'ll burn up. Which still heats the
atmosphere. If they are a bit bigger, they\'ll hit the ground and be so
spread out that they\'ll cool rapidly, via the rising of the fireball.
Either way, the heat winds up in the atmosphere, and will lead to more
water in the atmosphere shortly thereafter (which leads to cyclones).

If they pieces strike at sea, but aren\'t big enough to reach the
bottom, you\'ll still get all the water vapor, and heat into the
atmosphere, as well as a large fraction of the dust (from the rock
vaporizing, and the salts etc in the seawater).

If the rock was aimed for a land target, and was big enough to be more
than just a nuclear bomb equivalent, the *last* thing you want to do is
fragment it. You might get some sea strikes. 

If it was aimed for an ocean, you are pretty much screwed unless you
can make most of it *miss* the planet.

Remember, unless whatever you hit the rock with has comparable
*momentum*, the mess that results from the impact is going to keep
moving in much the same direction! So your 100 kilo projectile
vaporizes the entire 10,000,000,000 kilo rock. Ok, that means that you
hit it with something with 1/100,000,000th the mass. So unless it was
going 100,000,000 times as fast in the opposite direction, the
resulting cloud of vapor keeps moving towards you. Just a bit slower. 

If it\'s a 7% of c rock, then you\'ve just turned it into the mother of
all cosmic ray showers. It\'ll hit the upper atmosphere like the EMP to
end all EMP, and raise the temp considerably. Plus it\'ll be equivalent
to this truly unreal amount of radiation on that side of the planet.
(treat every atom as a 7% of c heavy ion cosmic ray impact). You could
wind up with lethal radiation doses over an entire hemisphere *plus*
firestorms from the "flash" when it hit atmosphere.

I\'ll have to try working out some figures for likely expansion rates,
and seeing what happens at different intercept distances.

Ah! You are trying to have a "planetary sandcaster" type defense. For
big slow rocks, it won\'t deflect them noticeably, nor will it break
them up (you\'d need *huge* amounts of material to create such a shell!)

For fractional c rocks, it\'s too close. At best, you\'d just turn the
rock into a plasma jet aimed at the planet. That means more energy
expended on the surface and atmosphere, less on deep rock layers. Not
good. 


A tip. Work out how big a "dangerous" rock has to be at say, 1% of c.
Then figure out how big a rock at 1% of c it\'ll take to destroy such a
rock. Let\'s say the results come out to be 100 meters across, and 100
grams.

That means that your defense shell must have a 100 gram object for
every 100 square meters of area to be defended.

Ignoring the difference in area between ground and high orbit, let\'s
work that out for an 8000 mile dia planet. Call it 6500 km radius. 
Area is 2 pi r^2. That\'s 2.6e14 sq meters. which means that there are
2.6e10 100 meter squares to be covered. That gives us 2.6e9 kg of shell
material. 

And this is ignoring the problem of arranging orbits so there aren\'t
gaps in coverage. At a guess, you probably need 2 to 3 times as many to
get proper coverage.

Reminds me of the players in an *old* D&D campaign. They finally
figured out that the castle was built on top of something a *lot*
older, and that some features (these *thick* towers around it with the
hemispherical, impenetrable mirrors on top) were definitely "odd".

After some very equivocal responses to an attempt to ask the gods for
clues (vague answers with a strong "you *really* don\'t want to do this"
undertone), they decided to try blasting their way in. 

It sorta worked. Seems the ancient stuff was a mothballed defense
installation for some interstellar civilization that\'d set it up
multiple thousands of years back. They managed to "wake up" the defense
computer. 

Guess who wins in a battle between 10-15th level wizards and a 100
gigawatt space defense laser? :-)

Critical misunderstanding, here:  They were aerobraking to *slow down* in 
order to go into orbit around Jupiter, then Io (Jupiter\'s innermost large 
moon).  Dipping into an atmosphere slows you down, making it rather 
useless for slingshot purposes, but great for shedding excess velocity if 
you want to stick around locally.

Not really. We\'re talking about .16 m/s^2 acceleration here. That\'s
about a 60th of a g. And since you want to have some spare fuel on
hand, you\'ll probably pick a body that is at least partly icy. The ice
will make a good "cushion". 

Or you can build a "docking cradle" sort of arrangement out of girders
on a stony or nickel iron rock. After all, it doesn\'t need to take a
lot of side stress.

No, it gives you *nine* seconds. The rock gets detected 1 light second
out. It takes one second for the signal to get from the rock to the
sensor. At that point, the rock is .9 light seconds out (9 sec at .1c)

Making the 9 second adjustment give 555 5/9 km/sec. :-) That also
assumes that you *instantly* know that it\'s a target. Figure at *least*
one second to get the vector determined well enough to hit it. 

8 seconds makes it 625 km/s.

Even .1c is difficult to pull off. 

The main problems are these. 

1. If the rock gets vaporized (or broken up into smaller rocks) you
need to do so far enough out to let things spread ouut a *lot* before
they get to the planet. Otherwise you just distribute the damage a bit
more evenly on the planet.

2. You need *very* high accelerations on that railgun. At 1 million g,
it takes a bit over .06 seconds to reach 625 km/sec. And in that time
the projectile travels almost 20 km! There are distinct limits to the
acceleration you can use, because the projectiles can\'t hack it. 

3. power. It\'ll take almost 200 GJ per kilo to accelerate the
projectile to 625 km/s. And that\'s assuming *no* losses. 200 GJ in .06
seconds is 300 *terawatts*. 

4. accuracy. A .1c rock doesn\'t have to be big. Say it\'s 100 meters
across (10 is more likely! or even *one*). So, at 625 km/s, your
projectile will cross the width of the rock in 160 one-millionths of a
second. Which means you have to be able to control the firing time, and
angle to parts per million. Lotsa luck!

I have a degree in history, focusing on the Roman and Byzantine eras.  Some 
of my players also have similar degrees, and have pointed out to me that I 
have (unconciously perhaps) run the Imperium very close to an Early Roman 
Empire sort of state.  When they have travelled into more Vilani-dominated 
areas, they have seen a very strong Byzantine influence.  The Zhodani 
Consulate has become very Persian, and the Vargr Extents have become a 
combination of celtic/gothic/vandal intertribal struggles and politics.  
Nonje of this was really a concious decision on my part; I just took GDW\'s 
cues and my own background and ran with it.  It has made me wonder if people 
with an SCA background are running their Imperium more like a traditional 
Feudal model and society.

Ever see a Cray-1? It\'s about $10 million of computer in a package
that\'ll fit in in 14 m^3. As a matter of fact, the prices for
*high-end* "mainframe" type systems have stayed fairly constant. The
power goes up, but the prices stays about the same. So does the size.

Compare a IBM 360, A VAX, and a Cray. Then consider the monsters they
use for the sort of commercial applications we want no part of. Things
like airline reservation systems, where you have 10,000 terminals
accessing the same *huge* database, simultaneously.

See, the important part is *not* that power/price drops. It\'s that the
price for "max" performance in any given category tends to stay about
the same.

Also, just how many pentium chips can you pack into 14 m^3? :-)

Entertainer, that\'s easy. Look at any of a number of TV shows. The
Magician was the first to spring to mind.

As for athlete, consider Bill Cosby\'s first TV show, I Spy. He and his
partner were spies operating with a cover of a pair of tennis pros opn
the international circuit.

There\'s a risk even at the low speeds found in planetary orbits. The
odds are low, but it\'s still possible to get hit by something large
enough to be inconvenient. Remember, two people in the US reported
damage from meteors hitting their property a year or two back. If
either had been a ship, it\'d have ruined their whole day. :-)

The problem is getting info regarding the density of objects of various
sizes. (ie  how many 1 mm objects are there in a given volume? How many
1 cm objects?, etc.)

If we can get the info, then we can try working up odds.

Nothing I hate more than being misunderstood, especially when I wrote 
in very plain language.  I said "Character Generation Rules are 
radically different...".  I did not say that the CT/MT system was better 
or worse than TNE.  I have my own opinions, but I left them out of this 
post as much as I could.  

CT & MT systems use a set of skills which are determined by random 
die roll, determines number of terms by chance, has attributes with 
different names than TNE.  The CT rules also limit the character to 1 
class.  Attributes are 2D.

By contrast, the TNE rules allow the character to switch classes 
between terms, and indeed characters are often better for having done so.  
Skills are picked by the player off the list.  There is no survival 
roll, and the character determines when their pre-adventuring career 
ends.  Very little luck other than attributes is present in the 
system.  Attributes are 2D-1. 

I\'d say these are pretty different character generation 
systems...wouldn\'t you?

Since you interjected your opinions in your post here\'s mine.  Most 
of the extra character classes given in TNE are worthless, especially 
since just about the entire game\'s mililieu is built around Military 
adventures.  Just how useful is an athlete going to be in a Smash & 
Grab operation...  

I like an element of chance in the development of characters.  To me, 
a player being able to pick and choose the skills he/she has means 
that they are going to in all probability, play the same character, 
again and again in campaign after campaign, after they\'ve selected 
what they consider to be the ideal mix of skills...  The only way to 
prevent this is by the referee arbitrarily preventing the character 
from generating the same character time after time.  Luck of the draw 
as in CT & MT prevents this situation from ever happening.  In my 
opinion, forcing the player to play different character types from 
campaign to campaign potentially can enhance the player\'s ability to 
really role play, as opposed to ROLL-play...

>    skills use, and 2) the available character classes actually have

Actually, the best character generation system in the world STILL 
creates 2D cutouts... 1D if you want to get down to it.  Only good players, 
led by good referees, can turn lists of skills and attributes into a 3D character...

The RC is a military background.  So little mention is made of the RC 
as an economic entity, even in Path of Tears, that the player has to 
take a wild guess.  GDW did NO design work on the economic system.  
The trade and commerce section was lifted virtually verbatim from the 
pages of MT Referees\' Manual, which itself was basically Merchant 
Prince with a bit of chrome...

As for the Regency sourcebook, it was good (once you got past the font 
best viewed with electron microscope), but we\'ll never know what the 
rest of it was like, since GDW was so intent on building the 
Traveller:T2K mililieu of RC...

Yes, but Vampire fleets came out a full 2 years after TNE came out, 
and only after a whole lot of people clamored for non-military stuff 
for the rules system.  The 3 best supplements for TNE were IMHO:
Vampire Fleets, Regency Sourcebook (basically Spinward Marches and 
surrounds updated for the TNE era), and Guilded Lilly.  Not so 
coincidentally, they were 3 of the last 4 things that GDW did before 
going belly up...

Actually, self-aware robots and ships have been the topic of a lot of 
science fiction in the last 10-15 years.  Hell, cyberpunk thrives on 
the concept...  Anybody who thinks that Virus stretches believability 
hasn\'t read a whole lot of recently published science fiction...

CT was only as sterile as you let it be...  Ask any long-time player 
in my campaigns just how sterile the 3rd Imperium was...

IMHO, if any  backdrop is sterile, the referee hasn\'t done his 
homework...

Good point, although I suspect that data encryption is going to be 
progressively more difficult to be secure about as TL of computers 
rises, and since the Imperium is about a multitude of different TL\'s 
not every certificate is going to be data encrypted on some sort of 
storage media.  Lower tech issues will be like they\'ve always been.

    'body' => 'This is probabily going to start a war or something, but I\'m going to throw
it on the table anyway.  The most recent (and still ongoing campaing) I\'ve
started went like this. 

My players start out as Active duty navy and marines at a naval research
station durring the final war.  Due to the growing lack of trained crews
(this is very late in the war) the naval archetects have decided to test a
new system to augment the engineering and repair crews with an automated
expert system to be installed in engineering.  The system was to be tested
on a chrysanthemum class DE, and replaced all of the maintainence crew, and
all but 2 or 3 engineers to supervise and direct the system.  (expert
systems require experts as the users ya know.)  

Before the shakedown cruise (actualy, before the ship is really even ready)
a call comes in from some comodore jumping in from some secret research base
nearby.  Lucan had attacked, and the defences were holding, but not for
long.  He ordered everything that could maneuver, fire, and jump to be
prepared for departure (to include the testbed vehicle) and combat.  

After spending an eventful week in jump fixing and reparing almost every
system onboard having fits with the new computers in engineering (and those
darned pesky repair drones), my flustered crew exits jump into a virus
infested graveyard.  The beauty of it was that my more experienced players
actualy didn\'t even figure out that it was the virus until they had infected
the lifeboats, and every hand computer on board in efforts to regain life
support.

Having exhausted all options, the crew placed themselves into emergency low
births for the next seventy years.  

Later they awake to find the ship taken over by two virus infected computer
systems (the regular one, and the new engineering system), and being used as
pawns in the struggle.



Now, for all of this jibberish two main points stand out for discussion:

1.      now that the players have opted to enter into a "mutual" arangement
with the engineering system and have helped it regain control of the ship,
are there any strains of the virus that are actualy helpful?  I mean . . .
I\'m the ref, and I don\'t even trust this thing.  Is there any precedent in
TNE for a trustworthy virus, or are they all nuts?

2.      never trust a fully automated ship.  "The more they overtick the
plumbing, the easier it is to clog" (so quoth (sort of) a famous engineer
that wasn\'t needed on his ship.}

Personal opinion.

We should go with 1 or the other exclusively.  The worst was MT which 
suggested that you could do other one.

   Well, I can tell you *my* viewpoints certainly have unconciously
influenced my Imperium. My players pointed out my small "l" libertarian
artifacts throughout the infrastructure I built for them. I have the
Imperium set up as a VERY impersonal bureaucracy with a very laissez faire
attitude towards many things. ("He doesn\'t have nuke on him, he\'s ok"
Talking about PC with a Fusion Gun and Battle Dress. ;-))

   Except for His Agents, Imperial beaurocrats aren\'t seen much in public
affairs on individual worlds. 

   This isn\'t an unreasonable viewpoint, IMO, because of the HUGE
communications lag inherent to Imperial govenrment, though it\'s arguable
it doesn\'t have to be this way.

   Agreed - as long as the character gets starting skills appropriate to
the character class. One thing that really bugged me about CT was
generating a marine grunt without gun combat, or a Navy medic without
medic, or a navy pilot without Pilot ;-) you get the drift.

   Personally, I still think the player\'s going to have more fun
generating a character where he has a _choice_. Also the richer skill set
and better granularity of TNE allow more detailed characters without
getting imbalanced.

   FWIW, the people I play with generally are very good roleplayers, and
have a good idea of what kind of character they want to play before
starting. Both me and another GM I know encourage rolelaying, and in the
case of "problem" players have ways of encouraging players to make
realistic characters. (Ie, even killing machines have social skills and
hobbies)

   That\'s been a problem as far back as I can remember. Hopefully MM has

   Perhaps I should have made myself clear, I don\'t think AI is impossible
- - I just think the idea of a Virus that can infect *any* machine, alien
or human and spread like wildfire taking control *involuntarily* though
things like Fire Control system antenae is plainly ludicrous.

   *Any* computer programmer/system analyst can tell you how stupid that
idea is. For example, a Mac virus cannot harm a PC at all (different
binaries) so why is it so easy for Virus to invade *any* system above a
certain arbitrary limit of complexity? The concept of Virus invading *any*
system through *any* comunications link is stupid. Have you ever heard of
a virus infecting your machine through email?

I stand corrected; thanks for reminding me.  Still, I think that scene in
2010 is a fair guide to what fuel skimming would be like:  a _very_ bumpy ride.

No, except the Good Times virus ;-)  

Remember though, that the Transponders, as written in Traveller are 
sanitary (untouched by human hands).  They automatically send, 
receive, and process the signal from another ship or communications 
source.  It would not at all be inconceivable today to write e-mail 
software that would download the executable, uudecode it, and execute 
it.  Quite simple in fact.  In those cases, assuming the executable 
was downloaded into the right flavor of machine, it would be very 
conceivable...stupid as hell, but conceivable...

Remember that people are slowly engineering Mac\'s and PC\'s 
towards sameness (Power PC which can run both flavors of software and 
OS\'s).  Mac\'s, PC\'s and Amigas have all been capable of running DOS software 
for sometime.  Amigas have cards made available for them that make them 
capable of emulating PC & Mac hardware at about the same speed as a real 
Mac or PC of similar capability.

As technology has progressed through the last 20 years, various 
companies hardware has shown a tendency to become more the same, not 
diverse...  Extrapolate this trend about 3500 years, and its not as 
unconceivable...  In addition, we are talking at TL 15, about machines 
that are "almost" self aware anyways.  Virus supposedly just rewrites 
itself to make the computer self-aware (along with suicidal, or homicidal 
tendencies, in most cases).  As TL 15 machines are envisioned, it might 
be less of a leap of logic then, than it would be now.

Hmm....well I can see where you are coming from from this, but i"ve found
that when i\'ve given people the *option* to generate background for
charactes and let them choose skills that i don\'t really see alot of
duplication.  there are still archetypes that i get periodically ("the
engineer", "Hotshot Pilot", "scientist", and "Grunt") but overall i get a
better feel for their character, and b/c the background is now seen as
part of *that* characer, i don\'t see the players creating someone with the
same background and therefore skills...

        Pretty much bang on, althoug one quarter of Canada\'s population
lives in a civilian jurisdiction: Quebec.  I\'d just want to add that (to the
lay audience, since you already know this) civil law evolved in Europe, and
is largely based on Roman law; thus, it\'s had nearly 2&1/2 millenia worth of
development.  Civil law systems tend to rely on codes that state broad legal
principles in plain language; the reasoning process in civil law is thus
inductive (reasoning from principles to specifics according to the facts of
the case), and civil law is very accessible.  Plunk an average person down
in front of a civil code, and he\'d be able to understand most of it.  OTOH,
codification does not lend itself to flexibility; and thus the law doesn\'t
evolve as rapidly as it can in the common law.  

        Common law originated in English law, and thus, is relatively young
(about 8 centuries or so).  Traditonally, it relies largely on judicial
precedent, and thus the reasoning process is deductive; you\'re working the
general principles up from study of common threads running through various
judgments.  It tends to be less theoretically coherent than the civil law,
purely because the civil law has had the benefit of about 600 years more of
being studied in universities; what the civil law calls Obligations, the
common law treats as Contract, Tort, and Unjust Enrichment.

        An example of the different approaches: the law of unjust
enrichment.  The Civil Code of Quebec covers it in 5 articles that fit
nicely into the Book on Obligations.  It gets covered in maybe a week of
classes in first year.  My equivalent common law course covered about the
same ground in a term, had a legal-sized casebook two inches thick, and had
about a half-dozen hefty textbooks as recommended reading.  Regardless of
approach, though, both systems often come to the same result.  Both have
their strengths and weaknesses, and both are a lot of fun to study...

        In Quebec, courts may review statutes on constitutional grounds;
that\'s because the court system in Quebec is based on the British model (as
is criminal and constitutional law).  In France, there is some sort of
judicial body that reviews statutes for constitutionality before they pass;
I believe that it\'s merely consultative.

        Characterizing civilian statutes as "long and specific" is a little
off base.  You can get incredibly, nightmarishly, technical statutes in both
systems.  My experience with civilian drafting (mostly Quebec statutes) is
that they only get technical where neccessary; otherwise they tend to be no
more complex than Canadian common law statutes

        Not quite... In Quebec, the reasons of a case on a given point are
_interpretation_, not statement, of the rule.  The judges are saying what
they think the relevant articles mean, not what the law is.  Stare decisis
applies; the articles in the 1866 Civil Code of Lower Canada dealing with
ruin of a building came to be interpreted in such a way that victims could
only recover if some part of the building detached itself under the
influence of gravity and fell.  The 1994 Civil Code of Quebec fixed that :).
In France, the situation is similar, although I\'m not sure to what extent
precedent is binding.

        Bang on.  As well, there are procedural differences; the common law
trial is adversarial in nature, where the two parties present their
arguements to the judge, who acts as a neutral arbiter.  The jury decides
fact, and the judge decides points of law and sentence.  In the civilian
system, the system is inquisitorial, or investigative if you prefer :), and
the judges\' role includes investigating facts as well as judging fact and
law.  There are no juries in traditional civil law.

        Then of course there\'s the Confucian justice system.  That\'s scary
:).  No lawyers, no juries, perjury was pretty much to be expected, torture
was routinely used, the judge had incredibly broad powers, and the aim of
the process in civil cases was more oriented towards dispute resolution via
judically imposed compromise than settling the case based on the parties\'
rights.  Near so far as I can tell, it wasn\'t exactly a system of private
law as we know it, but rather a sort of arbitration.

        Then there\'s modern Russian law: if your debtor is in default,
rather than call your lawyer, you call your local mafia boss, and a
half-dozen guys named Vlad in track suits with Kalashnikovs go shoot him.

        California, too, I believe, since it was originally a Spanish

the California Corporations Code the other day; its laid out in almost
exactly the same way as a civilian civil code is.

...we sometimes used an alternate system as well.  The alternate was 
used when a survival throw was failed, and it offered no chance of 
death.  Instead, it was an additional table that was consulted to 
determine the reason for forced discharge: dishonor, disability (lost an 
arm, eye, etc.), and other things.  In time, though, (about the time we 
finally came to the conclusion that Traveller was one of only two systems 
we truly enjoyed) we came to realize that the survival roll was a part of 
Traveller we enjoyed.

You see, for a very long time we tried numerous game systems, and even 
developed a couple of our own, in search of the perfect RPG for us.  When 
MegaTraveller came out, we didn\'t much care for it.  We thought we could 
do better.  And we set out to do so.  We wanted to take the best elements 
of our favorite games, combine them into one cohesive game, and add a 
new background/setting.  It was the last system we developed together.

What we came up with was a great success as far as playability and 
enjoyment goes (my favorite part was the combat system - a single roll to 
determine "to hit," damage, and hit location - developed by yours truly), 
but it also made us realize Traveller was the system for us.  The system 
we\'d developed, while having its own quirks, turned out to be simply an 
embellishment of the Traveller system, down to prior careers for 
characters (tho it had many more character types, and many more skills, 
used 2D12, had different characteristics, etc.) - but with a new, 
limited setting (Earth in the year 2000, with an alternate future that 
diverged with our world in about 1940).  We went through the whole 
development process, playtesting and really enjoying the hard work that 
went into it...then we realized that, through all of our efforts, we had 
created something like Traveller, but not as good.

So, I filed that game away (I still have the binder with the printouts, 
but not the computer files, alas) and we returned to Traveller with a new 
appeciation of the system.  Instead of taking it for granted that the 
system was broken (that was the way we approached all RPGs back in the 
days of our Quest for the Ultimate RPG), we took a good look at it.  
And you know what?  We found that Classic Traveller works really well 
as-is.  

We played many sessions using the system without changes, enjoying it 
very much.  After a while, we did re-institute some few changes, but only 
after long, hard thought and much discussion.  

Anyway, that\'s my story of how our gaming group finally figured out that 
the survival rolls, among other things, are part of the Traveller system, 
and that without them it is a poorer game (for us, that is).

I developed a twenty ton space mine than utilized passive sensors and a
hefty mass driver.  The idea was you placed the thing in orbit of a gas
giant and let it sit there.  When ships came in they were given a certian
length of time to send a code before the mass driver opened up with a ten
shot burst.  Because of the size of the round it was virtually undetectable
even with active sensors.  The mine would wait till the ship was within
30,000 km  before firing and if the ship was going to approach closer than
that it\'d calculate a best intercept course.  Getting hit with one of these
things would tear huge holes in the largest ships.

The big problem was it took quite a while for the rounds to reach their
target.  I discarded it after a while as essentially unworkable.

You should talk to my buddy, he\'s in armored cav recon.  It\'s his job to
place booby traps to slow the enemy down.  He\'s got some real beauties he

guarded by a real booby trap.  Its frightening, tilted paintings, heat

Most of the early infections took place through the IFF transponder units
and most of the original virus\'s lay dormant for weeks "feeling out their
surroundings".  The problem that I always had with it was how did the
silicon suddenly become alive?  Suspension of disbelief always took a
pounding on this one.

Virus had a hell of a time with both Hiver and Aslan computers.  Hiver\'s
because they were so quick to figure out what was happening and Aslan
because there was no common thread between two clan\'s programming and
architecture structures.  

If you can get past the initial "silicon comes to life" bit things were easier.

My character for my RC campaign is a Spiri and my background skills were so
off the wall the GM loved them.  Music, Philosophy, Painting and Song.
After that I went though the Pre-industrial University, Barbarian (I became
a wanderer and a temple guard), Hiver Tech and Marine.  The only problem in
generation was I had to explain away why all my contacts, way before the
founding of the Dawn League were offworlder\'s.  That was the tough part.

It\'s probably  one of the best most well rounded character\'s I\'ve ever created.

True story actually.  Did a stint in the reserves for a summer.  My Master
Corporal for grenade training pulls the pin, puts the grenade down and lays
down about 4 feet away.  The grenade goes off he gets up and dusts himself
off.  Apparently there\'s a shock "bump" about that far out and none of the
frags go through that zone.  Of course he told us to never try this ourselves.

Tough one...how about both?  <g> A "lot" wouldn\'t be of a single size,
I wouldn\'t think, so each lot would have to include the number of
m^3\'s it occupies, and you would have to indicate mass/volume anyway
for stowage purposes.  A price quote could be something like 800cr/lot
(120cr/m^3).

I\'d prefer cubic meters to displacement tons, personally.  I have a
request however, can we stay consistant and not switch back and forth
between cubic meters and kiloliters, and while we\'re at it what is a
good abbreviation for cubic meter?  I\'ve used m^3, but I don\'t much
like it, it can\'t be cm, and m3 doesn\'t really cut it either.

  I\'ve got QSDS on a spreadsheet now. I\'m not 100% sure all the
bugs are out but it seems OK. Initially I had trouble producing
ships that are profitable at 1000Cr/ton for cargo and 10000Cr/ton
on high-passage. Even when I put in the 25% discount.
  However, remember your TCS rules: _exchange rates_.
  All the prices of the standard Imperial settings assumed a
norm of TL15. The norm of mileu-0 is TL12. A ship produced on
a TL12 world is 15% cheaper than "normal". At TL9 it goes down
to 30% cheaper.
  When I made those adjustments _then_ my ships started being
profitable.
  I\'ll post designs once I\'m sure my spreadsheet works. (Any
volunteers to test it? You need Lotus 1-2-3.)

  Well, you know, you can always start one. Hell, over here

        Instead of either, we could use kiloliters (kl) -- one kl IS one
cubic meter. It\'s just that liters are usually used to indicate volume of
liquids, but there\'s no hard physical rule ("WARNING: FUSION WILL NOT OCCUR

 For the record, Jerry Pournell says he (and about 40 other 
 human volunteers) underwent decompression (he doesn\'t say 
 explosive, he doesn\'t say he went completely to vacuum,
 and he doesn\'t say for for how long). He does say it is
 not something he\'d do again given the choice.

 Anyway, for those of you who want the nitty gritty:

 "Rapid (Explosive) Decompression Emergencies in Pressure-Suited 
 Subjects", by Emanuel M. Roth, NASA CR-1223, circa 1968. Its 
 focus is on decompression, rather than vacuum exposure per se.

 _The Effect on the Chimpanzee of Rapid Decompression to a Near 
 Vacuum_, Alfred G. Koestler ed., NASA CR-329 (Nov 1965).

 _Experimental Animal Decompression to a Near Vacuum 
 Environment_, R.W. Bancroft, J.E. Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 
 (June 1965), USAF School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, 
 Texas.

 "Survival in space: medical problems of manned spaceflight" by 
 Richard M. Harding; Chapter 3: "Pressure and density".
 SBN 0-415-00253-2 Publisher: Routledge, New York 1989

 I\'ll skip the direct quotes. They get a little gruesome.
 There seems to be some disagreement on how long a human
 could remain conscious and able to react to an emergency.

 Frankly, I would think that _non-explosive_ decompression
 events would be more dangerous. Slow loss of pressure is
 hard to detect without instruments, and hypoxia would degrade
 reaction time until you lapsed into unconsciousness, then 
 suffocated.

After 15 years, I\'ve rather got used to them. Drop them for cargo, but keep
them for rating ship sizes.

        That\'s how I feel. Everybody\'s used to using them for rating ships,
and it\'d probably feel funny talking about the "1400cubic meter
Scout/Courier," but for everything else, from cargo to fuel to vehicles to
ship components, I like "real" units.

I can (barely) run Windows 3.0 on this system. I\'d rather have stuff in

Ooops. But I did figure on the "packing". The local store brand comes
in 3x3 "flats", that stack. That\'s where I got the 9 per 40 CM cube.
That gives 64,000 cc for 9 bottles. 14 kl is 14,000,000 cc. That gives
about 200 40 cm cubes per DT, or 1800 bottles. $1000/1800 gives about
56 cents a bottle (including deposit :-)

He was buying in lots of 10 for $75 or so each. I figure that the
wholsaler he was going thru probably paid only about $50 each to the
Chinese. Remember, they were selling these things by the shipping
cannister!

Think "military surplus". At gun shows right now the price for SKS
rifles ranges from $100 to $200. That\'s *retail*. 

Given the tech level variations in Traveller, I\'m certain that when the
miltary upgrades their weapons (say, switching from the M-1 Garand, to
the M-16), the surplus weapons are readily sold to planets who want to
upgrade from older weapons. 

There are folks right here on earth who make a good living taking
working but "obsolete" equipment and selling it to countries where it\'s
an *upgrade*. Every step-by-step and crossbar phone exchange that has
been replaced by a digital exchange here in the US, has had a ready
market in the third world. It\'s much better than manual switchboards,
it\'s built to last, and all the "quirks" are well known.

Given the right sort of spread of tech levels among some "close"
worlds, a trader could make a nice living doing this. Sell the TL-11
"junk" from the TL-12 world to the TL-11 world, buy TL-10 "junk" there
to sell to the TL-10 world, and so on, until he hits the low tech end
and fills up on minerals, or art or gemstones, or some such.

The megacorps won\'t be interested, as it\'s a "margin" type market. But
just consider. How much would *anybody* in WWII have paid for Vietnam
era tanks and APCs. Or planes? Or.... Then you take all the Mustangs,
and Sherman tanks and sell them to the WWI era folks. :-)

Trouble is, you\'ve just *increased* the amount of energy deposited in
the atmosphere. Since we are talking about "dinosaur killers", not city
killers, this is a *significant* point. 

True, the earth gets hit by tons of rock per year. But we are talking
about *gigatons* of rock, in a few seconds (assuming big slow rock)

If it\'s a fractional c rock, then it doesn\'t matter, because the
energies involved make splitting the rock *far* more dangerous. See
other posts.

A point that *far* too many overlook is that your *life* depends on the
ship functioning. Most folks on earth just can\'t grasp the basic
mindset that well. Read "Flatlander" by Lary Niven for an example of
the attitude difference between a spacer and the typical *well
informed* person from a benign planet like Earth.

Starships and spaceships are not cars. If your car has a catastrophic
failure, you may die, more likely you get hurt in the crash and get
pulled out. If it has a major failure, you get out and curse at the
thing, then call for help. If it has a minor failure, you fix it when
it gets annoying enough.

Starships and spaceships are not ships. If a ship has a catastrophic
failure, you get into the lifeboats. If it has a major failure, you sit
there and try to fix it, if you can\'t, you radio for help. If it has a
minor failure, you fix it while underway unless it\'s *really* minor.

Starships and spaceships are not airliners. On an airliner, if there\'s
a catastrophic failure, you\'re dead. If there\'s a major failure, you
try to land, if there\'s a minor failure you fix it when you reach your
destination. 

Starships and spaceships are not subs. If a sub has a catastrophic
failure, you die. If it has a major failure, you probably die. If it
has a minor failure, you try to fix it *now*.

Subs do come close though.

On a starship or spacehip, you are dependent on the ship working
properly for food, water, heat, air, and pressure. If something goes
wrong with the drives, you can run out of food, water, and air unless
you have *very* good recycling, and can fix the drive.

If something goes wrong with life support, you can last weeks with no
food. Days with no water. Hours with no temp control (whether you
freeze or bake depends on circumstances). You can only last *minutes*
with no air, and *seconds* with no pressure (ie, you may be able to
hold your breath for 5 to 15 minutes, but you get into trouble from low
pressure in less than 2 minutes).

Therefore, anything on a starship or spaceship that falls under the
heading "engineering" is *vital* to your continued life.

I\'d go with *some* sort of volume based unit. Remember, standardized
cargo containers are likely to be the order of the day. Current
containers look to be about 2.5x2.5x8 meters (and half sized ones only
4 meters long). That gives 25 cubic meters and 50 cubic meters for
sizes. Make the lengths 4.5 and 9 meters and you get shipping
containers that are 2 and 4 displacement tons in size. I kind of like
that idea. 

"Original" Td was 1.5x3x3, which gives us the following sizes:
1 Td	3x3x1.5
2 Td	3x3x3
4 Td	3x3x6

Cargo holds will be designed to hold whole numbers of standard shipping
containers. And by doing so, they\'ll make it a lot easier for everyone.
No worrying about how to cram things in, no worrying that containers
will break under "normal" handling or accelerations. Etc. And you can
"seal" the containers to show if they\'ve been tampered with.

"bulk" cargoes (grain and other powders, liquids, etc) will go into
specialized tanks or holds, or else they\'ll be packed into standard
containers. 

The only things likely to *not* be packed into containers are small,
*very* valuable items, which will go in the ship\'s safe/vault.

Oh yeah, there should also be a surcharge for any cargo that masses
more than the 10 ton/Td "slop" value. It should be based on how much
the cargo is heavy. The reason being that one "heavy" container means
that unless enough others are "light", the ship will have "empty" hold
space (remember, the manuever drive is based on the ship averaging no
more that 10 tonne/Td).

If you\'ve got a varied cargo, you may waive the surcharge, as long as
the average works. If you have a bunch of heavy containers, but still
haven\'t "massed out", you might even offer a discount rate for
lightweight cargo just to fill the hold (less chance of things shifting
when the hold is full).

There are two conditions that indicate when you are "full". One is
"massing out". That means that you\'ve got as much cargo mass as you can
handle, regardless of how much space is left it the hold.

The other is "bulking out". That means that you\'ve filled the hold,
regardless of how much more mass you could carry. 

Let\'s assume a 100 Td hold (and the corresponding 1000 tonne mass limit).
100 Td is 1400 m^3. 

1400 m^3 of platinum is 30,800 tonnes. Obviuosly, you\'ll "mass out"
long before you bulk out. In fact, you can only haul 3.25 TD of
platinum before reaching the 1000 tonne limit.

On the other hand, if you\'ve got a cargo of, say, cotton underwear, you
are going to bulk out *long* before you mass out. In fact, you\'ll bulk
out on anything with a density of less than .7 tonnes/m^3 and mass out
with anything with a density higher than that (water has a density of 1
tonne/m^3).

It is Adobe\'s Portable Document Format.  Not all that oddball 8-).
Readers are available for Windows, Macs and Os/2, including a netscape

What, you mean every single person in the navy\'s medical service is a 
surgeon?  Every marine truck driver is so skilled with a rifle that 
he qualifies as a sniper?  You mean the grunt who works in the 57th 
century equivalent of the bilges can pilot a ship through an asteroid 
belt while being shot at by a BattleRider?

Not every character is going to develop the same level of skills.  
OK, I agree with you, there should be a few more default skills.  
Marines are all taught to use a rifle.  Give them combat rifleman-1 
if you wish as a default.  Maybe you give a person in the medical 
corps a skill of Medic-1 (although there are going to be people in 
the naval medical corps who do little more than administrative tasks, 
so maybe not).  But I can\'t see any way that you can justify giving 
every single person who mans a gun, or repairs an engine Pilot-1.  
Perhaps a better solution is to let them choose a default skill that 
would reflect their specialty, after the fact...  The navy guy who 
specialized in engineering...give him the choice of adding +1 to his 
skill in engineering, or maybe mechanical or electronics.  Same thing 
with gunners, and so on.

My point exactly.  Hell, the only real traders in the RC (the Guild)

[Applause]  One needs to remember that space is fundamentally inhospitable
to life as we know it.  No man is an island, but star/space-ships sure
are.  If the little island you fly around in the big black empty with
springs a leak, you either have someone on board who can fix it right
quick, or stick your head between your legs and kiss your sorry arse

Anyone know any stevedores or longshoremen?  Ask them how modern
freighters are loaded.  The logistics of loading a freighter get
ridiculously painful when one considers that a freighter will stop at a
veritable smorgasbord of ports, both offloading and taking on freight at
each stop.  The containers they use pretty much have to be standardized to
allow for the most efficient usage of space, and so they can be packed so
that the shipment of tricycles you have to offload isn\'t buried under
those reactor core assemblies that you don\'t have to offload.  Ever wonder
why dockworkers get paid so well (union aside)?  Because they have to deal
with all this nonsense.

What is really needed is an orbital "mechanic" in deep system with a mass
driver sufficiently powerful to "engineer" a new trajectory for the rock.
Have him do some dirty math and then smack another rock into your
"dinosaur killer" just enough to send it past the planet.  Granted, this
has some problems...  First, it\'d have to be a HUGE (anti-rock)
rock-slinger.  Second, the guy would have to be ballistic wizard (two
shots at the very most).  And finally, it very likely that the system
would then have a very ugly and unpredictable orbiting body (i.e. comet)
that could come back to haunt them.

No, you\'ve missed the point Stu.  This guy was a medic and he\'d didn\'t have
any medical skills.  Couldn\'t even lift a litter properly.  It was pretty
funny, he\'d been so focused on  making a cool character he forgot to pickup
any medical skills at all.

Not true there\'s the Free Trader\'s Network.  An invaluable source of
information on the "wilds" and a damn set of heavy drinkers in the
starports.  There are also plenty of Merchants from the RC plying the wilds.
Look at Cardovan Rink, the problem is the game tends not to focus on these
men and women.  Even the RCES is supposed to be a quasi mercantile
opperation.  I\'m not sure what information is contained in the World Tamers
Handbook.  I know POT contains info on all kinds of operations on most
worlds in the AO.  Lets face it though it\'s the Smash and Grabs that get the
attention.

As a minimum, every world should have a trade table. Particularly detailed
worlds can have a trade table for every country, or even for every major
city. 

1.     Select the table size. 
2.     For every entry in the table, determine the general good category. 
3.     For every entry in the table, determine specific good characteristics.

As always, rolling the dice is a substitute for imagination. At any time feel
free to select a result, or to make one up completely. 

The universe is full of unique products. Many of these are suitable for but a
single planet, or are not worth the cost of transporting them to another
star. However, the vagaries of history and economics can lead to bizarre
situations. For example, in the 19th century laundry was shipped from
California to Hawaii, while during the Roman Empire urine (used for fulling
togas) was shipped from Spain to Italy! Part of the fun of Traveller is
devising logical explanations for apparently bizarre circumstances. 

1. Select the table size

In general, larger economies will produce a greater variety of exports. This
is reflected in the table size. Note that the population is that of the
economic unit referred to by the table: thus, most cities will have smaller
table than countries. (But a big city on a high population planet will have a
larger economy - and thus a larger table - than an entire low population
world.) 

The number of dice thrown for a trade table is the population number of the
planet (or country). Thus, a table for a population 1 world is numbered from
1-6, while a table for a population 4 world is numbered 4-24. 

2. Determine the general good category

There are several ways of categorizing goods. I selected the system used in
Grand Survey, mainly because DGP included tables to determine if a particular
resource was present on a world, then expanded it to include the
MegaTraveller categories. These categories are: 
*     natural agricultural
*     natural ores
*     natural radioactives
*     natural gems & crystals
*     natural petrochemical
*     processed agricultural
*     processed ores & alloys
*     processed agroproducts
*     manufactured weapons
*     manufactured mechanical parts
*     manufactured heavy equipment
*     manufactured electronics
*     manufactured gravitics
*     information
Spread the categories throughout the table. Place the most common categories
in the centre (they will be rolled more frequently). 

3. Determine specific good characteristics

Use the following checklist to detail the specific characteristics of a trade
good. 

1.     Select a good from the appropriate table. 

     Note: Not all goods on a resource table are equally likely. Strike a
balance between goods being common enough to be available and unusual enough
to be available to a tramp trader. 

2.     Copy the good type, resale DMs, and density to the trade table. 

3.     Roll for lot size. 

4.     Roll on the actual value table for the base price. Use the same dice
roll, including the purchase DMs, to calculate the base cost. (The base cost
will always be lower than the base price - otherwise the good wouldn\'t be an
export!) multiply these amounts by the lot size to get the cost and price per
lot. 

5.     Determine any special handling requirements. 

6.     Name the good. Be creative: this is where you make the item come alive
for your players. "Poisson-fue", "braidbark", and "breadroot" evoke images of
exotic life forms; "grapple grommets", "QS12a Gravitron Units", and "fusion
coupler gaskets" imply essential industrial components. 


NOTE: Tables will follow once I figure out an easy way to convert them to
formatted ASCII.

- ----

Interstellar trading has been part of Traveller since the beginning. The
original system described in Book 2 of Classic Traveller provided for
specific trade goods with individually varying values. The later Book 7
(Merchant Prince) system changed this to generic goods differentiated only on
their sourceworld. 

Being Nicholas van Rijn fans, my group preferred the original system. Using
an idea from FASA\'s Merchant Class Ships, we created a trade system based on
unique trade tables for every world. These tables allow individual economies
to appear, without slowing down the game session. (All the world of creating
a table is done between sessions, just as with animal encounter tables.) 

Enhanced Trading

The successful trader buys low and sells high. Anything else leads to
bankruptcy. 

That said, the purpose of trading in Traveller is to have fun. Trading should
never be a mechanical process of rolling dice and calculating financial
statements. If trading is not a core element in the current adventure, then
use the basic trade rules (ie. Merchant Prince/MegaTraveller). These enhanced
rules are intended to add greater flavour, variety, and most importantly
chances for adventure. 

Trading Process

The mechanics of trading are handled by tasks. However, the referee should
strive to integrate these into the adventure, rather than making them simple
die-roll hurdles to be overcome. 

Task Difficulty

The ease with which goods can be moved is governed by the size of the
economy. To reflect this, many tasks have a difficulty of "<population>",
which means that the task difficulty is based on the population code as
follows:

     Lo     Difficult
     Mod     Routine
     Hi     Simple

Any of the following steps can be turned into an adventure: 

1.     Find a possible cargo
2.     Negotiate a price
3.     Load the cargo
4.     Jump to another system
5.     Find a potential buyer
6.     Negotiate a price
7.     Unload the cargo
8.     Collect payment

Finding a cargo

The first step is to find a decent cargo. This system assumed that there are
many possible cargos, but the players are looking for something with
extraordinary profit potential. As well, regular shipments of standard items
will, in settled space, probably be carried by a regular freighter with a
contract (ie. a subsidized liner). Thus, what the players are picking up are
the fortuitous crumbs of trade that slip between the megacorporations\'
fingers. 

To find a potential cargo:
<population>.  Trading, Streetwise. 3 hours.
Referee:  Several characters can pool their efforts. Use the highest skill in
each category for the success roll, but total all skills for the time roll.
(The extra help means several leads can be followed up simultaneously.) 

Notice that finding a cargo will, on average, occupy a single individual for
most of a week. If a cargo is not found, or if the players do not like the
one they do find, another attempt can be made with the usual penalties for
retrying. 

If the players find a cargo, choose one from the world\'s trade table. 

Negotiating a price

Once a cargo is found, then a price must be negotiated. While this will, in
many cases, be the lowest one possible, circumstances might warrant paying a
bit more. Possibly the players feel sorry for a real hard-luck case. Possibly
they want to cement an ongoing business arrangement. Possibly they learn that
the seller has a cousin in the starport engineering department*

Canny players will want to investigate the goods (and the seller) before
making a deal. Possibly the goods are defective, or stolen. Possibly *

To investigate the goods:
Routine. Admin/Legal, appropriate skill. 15 minutes. (uncertain)
Referee:  An appropriate skill is one that relates to the goods being bought.
Gravitics for grav modules, Prospecting for ores, and so on. 

Actual Value Tables                         
Stable          Standard          Volatile

12     125%     12     170%     12     300%
13     130%     13     200%     13     400%
14     140%     14     300%     14     600%
15     150%     15     400%     15     800%

The markets for different commodities vary, to reflect this there are three
actual value tables. Most goods use the standard table. Goods with stable
markets are indicated by an "S" following their price; these goods use the
stable table. Goods with volatile markets are indicated by an "V" following
their price; these goods use the volatile table. 

Rather than a task, a simple die roll is used to set a price. Roll two dice,
modify the total by all appropriate factors, and find the percentage value on
the correct actual value table. Multiply the base cost by the indicated
amount. The Bargaining skill of the players\' negotiator is a negative
modifier (tends to lower cost); the Bargaining skill of the seller\'
negotiator is a positive modifier (tends to increase cost). 

Loading the cargo

This is relatively straightforward, unless the cargo has special requirements
or is illegal. In each case the referee must adjudicate the requirements.
Don\'t be afraid to use a bit of humour; after all, players who have bought
2000 live rabbits without the cages deserve everything coming to them! 

One enhancement I use is to make the players pack their cargo hold. To do
this I use deck plans and cardboard templates. After a couple of days spent
loading sacks of grain (by hand - because the low-tech cargo robot kept
tearing the sacks) my players invested in a couple of standard shipping
containers.

Jumping to another system

Covered in other rules (specifically Starship Operators Manual). 

Finding a potential buyer

Posting a notice on the starport computer net will probably find a buyer, but
a better price can be obtained with a little salesmanship. 

To find a potential buyer:
<population>.  Trading, Streetwise. 3 hours.
Referee:  Several characters can pool their efforts. Use the highest skill in
each category for the success roll, but total all skills for the time roll.
(The extra help means several leads can be followed up simultaneously.) 

Notice that selling a cargo will, on average, occupy a single individual for
most of a week. If a buyer is not found, or if the players do not like the
one they do find, another attempt can be made with the usual penalties for
retrying. 

Negotiating a price

Once a buyer is found, then a price must be negotiated. While this will, in
many cases, be the highest one possible, circumstances might warrant paying a
bit more. Possibly the players feel sorry for a real hard-luck case. Possibly
they want to cement an ongoing business arrangement. Possibly they learn that
the buyer has a cousin in the starport engineering department*

Canny players will want to investigate the buyer before making a deal. Do
they always pay on time?

To investigate the buyer:
Routine. Admin/Legal, Streetwise. 15 minutes. (uncertain)

The markets for different commodities vary, to reflect this there are three
actual value tables. Most goods use the standard table. Goods with stable
markets are indicated by an "S" following their price; these goods use the
stable table. Goods with volatile markets are indicated by an "V" following
their price; these goods use the volatile table. 

Rather than a task, a simple die roll is used to set a price. Roll two dice,
modify the total by all appropriate factors, and find the percentage value on
the correct actual value table. Multiply the base price by the indicated
amount. The Bargaining skill of the players\' negotiator is a positive
modifier (tends to increase price); the Bargaining skill of the buyer\'s
negotiator is a negative modifier (tends to decrease price). 

Unloading the cargo

As with loading, this is relatively straightforward, unless the cargo has
special requirements or is illegal. In each case the referee must adjudicate
the requirements. Illegal cargos should certainly be role-played! 

Collecting the payment

Again, this should be relatively straightforward. However, don\'t neglect the
fun of individual planetary currencies. Difranian marks are probably not
legal tender off-planet, so the players may be forced into buying another
speculative cargo*

Example Trading Session

The players\' starship is grounded at Genese on Echiste, a water-world in
Lanth/Spinward Marches. While the engineer overhauls the jump drive, the
purser heads into town to look for a profitable cargo. 

Echiste is a low population world, making this a Difficult task (11+). The
purser has Trading-3 and Streetwise-3. The referee rolls a 5 for success;
only her high skills let the purser find cargo here. The time roll is 16
(less 6 for skills) for a total of 30 hours. The purser is in a hurry,
working 10-hour days, so it will be three days before she finds a cargo. 

Rather than simply rolling the dice and announcing the result, the referee
describes the startown district and general flavour of Genese , giving a
brief but vivid description of how weary the purser is trotting after leads,
visiting grungy warehouses, and so forth. The referee rolls for encounters,
and on the third day gets a street gang. Sensing an opportunity for
adventure, he improvises. 

"On your way back from talking to M. LeFarge, one of seedier local sashimi
brokers, you see a scruffy man, mid-forties, ringed by leather-clad young
punks. \'Donnez moi, gramps,\' snarls the leader as he swings a chain."

The purser is feeling heroic. "I pull out my deck-sweeper, fire a round into
the ground, then cover the gang. \'Another day, boys,\' I smile. \'You\'re up
past your bedtime.\' I jerk the muzzle down the passage."

The referee quickly rolls a morale check for the gang. They fail. "They glare
at you, but back away. \'Another day, midons,\' growls the leader, \'another
day.\' They rumble down the passage, making out like they were leaving anyway.

"Their victim breathes a sigh of relief. \'Merci beaucoup, madamoiselle, je
pense que j\'ai morte.\' He notices your shipsuit. \'Ah, vous etes une voyageur!
Please to excuse my manners. I am Jean-Guy Morseau, a simple coureur des
fonds waylaid while peddling my poisson-fue. I have much for to thank you;
this trip I capture deux - \'ow you say, two? But of course, I must buy you a
drink. Come, ma cousine has a little bistro*\' He leads you off*"

The contact is made. Poisson-fue is a delicacy, live animals bringing a
premium price on Regina. And who better to teach the players how to keep one
alive than Jean-Guy?

Like glenn, I agree with this basic assumption. MTJ4 had some rules on
location and severity, but something like miss by 1=1d mishap; mis by 2=sd
mishap; miss by 4+=3d mishap; random location...

I like that hit locations table, and use it. Reprinting it here for comment
and comparison to TNE\'s
MTJ Hit Locations       Chest Sub-Locations
2       R Hand          1-2     Heart
3       R foot/shin     3-5     Lungs (l/r random)

9       L Leg           3       R Ear                   determine.
10      L Arm           4       L Ear
11      L Foot/shin     5       throat
12      L Hand          6       Roll twice more

I added another step to taking damage:
when a given location takes damage: the damage rating is the difficulty
level of retaining function of that location.
1= Simple       2= Routine      3= Difficult    4= Formidable   5= Impossible
6+= No chance at all

<Difficulty>, End, Toughness (New Skill), Unskilled OK, Hazardous, Fateful,
Instant
Referee: on a failure, roll a mishap of 2d; on a crit fail, roll a 3d
mishap. This is the level of damage to that location (no extra hits or
attribute mods apply, and no damage iincrease occurs). On a minor, the
location is unable to be utilized consciously (but autonomic systems like
heart, lungs, etc continue to function, possibly at reduced level) and no
additional treatment is needed. On a major mishap, the body part is still
there, but no longer working. On a Destroyed mishap, the limb is missing,
or the organ need to be replaced, it cannot be healed. Trivial mishaps
indicate the limb is not usefull for 1d6 rounds. Major mishaps require some
kind of therapy or medical treatment.

Toughness (falls under Special Combat, Inborn, and/or Physical)
This skill is the ability to withstand abusive physical punishment and keep
functioning. While the system shock is not negated, it indicates a much
better ability to function after trauma.

To Remain conscious when Unc Threshold has been hit:
Difficult, End, TOughness, Instant, Fateful, Semi-safe,
Referee: if made, the character may continue to function, at +1 Diff.
        If failed character is unconscious.
        Roll no mishaps, unless character must remain conscious to avoid
        some other hazard.

Just some related ideas.

Costs and prices should be given in terms of lots.  

Lot volumes should be in cubic metres/kilolitres, but the increments should

roughly 2 and 4 displacement tons.)

I think I\'ll use kilolitres, just because you can write "kL" in ASCII, while
without superscripting "m3" looks a bit odd.

Although I\'m still working on converting my current table to ASCII, I\'ll
describe the format here.  Each item is actually a column on the table:

Good Type: A nice generic type of good.  For example, grain, rice, manoc,
potatos and corn are all "bulk carbohydrate". 

Lot Number: Expressed as a dice throw for the trade table.  Eg. "4D".

Lot Size: Given as a number or a formula - must be resolved into a number for
the trade table. Eg. "1D x 50".

Base Price: This is given in credits per kilolitre, because the lot size may
change.  Must be multiplied by lot size for trade table.  

Purchase DMs: As given in the Book 2 system.  Could also expand to include
other world trade codes, starport types, etc.

Resale DMs: As per Book 2.

Handling: A list of handling requirements and probabilities (from MT), to be
rolled and determined when the table is being created.  Eg. "Fla 6+, Exp 4+".

So, as an example, an entry might be:

Good Type         Number  Size     Base Price   Purchase DMs     Resale DMs  
 Handling
Bulk Carbohydrate  5D     1D x 50     20        A-2, Na+1, I+2     A-2       
 Fla 6+, Exp 4+

Lets say that this is a good found on an agricultural world.  The referee
copies the good type to the trade table.  

He then rolls for the lot size, getting 4 x 50 = 200 kL as the base lot size
(8 displacement tons).  He copies the number and lot size to the trade table:
5D x 200 is the lot entry on the trade table (indicating 5D worth of 200 kL
lots).  

He rolls for price and gets a 10.  Looking up 8 (10 - 2) on the actual value
table yields 110%, so the lots cost 200kL x 110% x 20Cr = 4800Cr each ==>
this is the base cost.

Looking up 10 on the actual value table yields 130%, so the lots will sell
for an avergae of 200kL x 130% x 20Cr = 5200Cr each ==> this is the base
price.

He copies the resale DMs directly to the trade table.

He then rolls 2D for each of the handling codes, getting 7 and 2
respectively.  This good is flamable but not explosive.  (How can bulk
carbohydrate explode?  Ever see a grain silo blow up?)

His 5-year-old neice comes up with the name "purple gumroot".

So, the final entry for the trade table is:

Purple Gumroot (bulk carbohydrate)     4800Cr/5200Cr     A-2     Fla   5D x
200

Oh... Sounds like the player who rolled him up or designed him kind

your chances by picking the right table to roll from...  If you\'re

Probably, but I guess I\'ve got a problem with somebody having the 
ability to go through the skill list and picking and choosing things 
like they were combing the aisles at K-Mart.  Also, its not all that 
realistic in military careers, where guys not getting the assignments 
they want are more the rule than the exception, in most cases...

This is probably the single biggest reason that a lot of CT & MT

I didn\'t, but a lot of people did...on the other hand, I haven\'t used it yet...

Somebody\'s going to correct you.  The aurora is caused by interactions
between Sol\'s stellar wind of charged particles, Earth\'s magnetic field,
and the upper atmosphere.  Basically, said particles get steered and
concentrated by the mag field into Earth\'s polar regions, where they
strike molecules in the upper atmosphere, which fluoresce.  The whole
thing is strikingly similar to how a TV picture tube operates, actually. 

Trin\'s Veil, on the other hand, is a hazy mass of dust which orbits Trin. 
It gives Trin a gauzy appearance from space, and produces nice effects
when seen at night from the surface.  This next part is non-canonical, but
this must be a very short-term phenomenon, as dust particles would quickly
be swept away by the solar wind around a habitable (and hence near the
star) world like Trin.  I estimate that the Veil couldn\'t have formed more
than about 10,000 years ago, tops.

So the Zhodani did not take advantage of the chaos and attack Deneb? 

Was the Virus an intelligent collective organism capable of planning things
or did they simply reproduce and take over things? 

When did the Virus become intelligent? 

Imagine what the virus would have been like if the Imperium had FTL

Battle ship???  Hell it was a battle group, though it was only one ship that
did all the damage to Trin.  Sounds nice, orbital ring, poets would love the
place.

I\'ve never had this problem, as a player or GM.  People generally try to
stay within the confines of the character.  
There\'s base skill package, continuing term skills to chose from and special
duty skills to chose from.  Special duty skills are generally combat or
intrigue oriented.  The only thing that gave characters the ability to chose
something wierd was their secondary activity, if you got one.

>OK, I forgot about the FTN.  But there\'s a lot more written on the

That\'s because they never really had time to develop the FTN and the RC
generally works harmoniously with the FTN, or at least they get along to an
extent.  The Guild on the other hand is a whole different story.  The Guild
constitutes a major adversary for RCES and had to be detailed.

Okay, not so much mercantile as RCES operations are "generally" supposed to
pay for themselves.  The materials recovered can be sold for a value that
covers the operating costs of the mission.  You get the point.

I\'ve never really looked at WTH.  I know it\'s got a half dozen ships and
some interesting black powder weapons in the back but other than that.  I\'ve
got WBH and I\'ve tried to convert some of the gear contained therein to TNE
standards.  The GRAV-BIKE is a bit of a problem.

Which the TNE book or Virus?  Have you got Survival Margin?  It\'s got some
interesting stuff on the origin\'s of Virus.  I guess the thing is if you\'ve
created a self-aware computer (go with this for a second) would it\'s ability
to be selfaware a result of the computer or of the software?  

Both, the software would be the means by which the "entity" interpreted it\'s
surroundings, and the hardware\'s ability to process information would
determine how smart that entity was.

This kind of stands to reason doesn\'t it?

So if the software is the source of the intelligence would it not be
possible to transfer that intelligence back and forth between computers,
much like I\'m sending you this message now only a million times larger and a
million times faster.  The computer that the program is now in will
determine how intelligent the entity becomes and how much external stimuli
the computer can interpret.  ie. a cash register wouldn\'t know that someone
was in the room with it until they touched its buttons and given the amount
of space in the processor it wouldn\'t get to smart.  

Now imagine this same program in a Cray II at the corporate headquarters of
a geo-sat company.  This computer would have access to a greater amount of
external stimuli (security camera\'s [possibly], satilite infromation on the
planet including satilite views of what\'s going on and Internet access.

Now assuming that this self-aware program makes use of it\'s resources would
it not stand to reason that this program could potentially become very
intelligent.  Given the amount of information it has access to.

Now if you incorporate into this program a sub-routine in it\'s intial
processing sequence (first thing run) that told it to carefully observe it\'s
surroundings and learn as much as possible before acting.  Instinctive
behaviour like the kind found in most animals.  Does this scenario become
more likely?  Especially if the program is so advanced it immediatly
subverts any virus detection programs contained withing the computer.

Given the amount of data flying around between computers, how much of that
data do we actually see.  The binary code for a single character is 8(?)
characters long or is it 11(?), can\'t remember.  So for every character that
appears on your screen the computer is actually processing considerably more
data behind the scenes.  It becomes even more possible to slip a program
into a computer without the user being fully aware.

How\'s that?  Just thought it up on the spur of the moment.  Is that a better
explanation of the Virus?

This is true if the planet is in the habitation zone of a star.  What if
it\'s in the habitation zone of a brown dwarf?  I beleive the concept is put
forth in 2300ad.  Aroura is in the habitation zone of a brown dwarf, a very
large gas giant (a star that just didn\'t quite make it) that radiates
immence amounts of UV & IR radiation.  I\'m not sure about the IR part of
that equasion and a friend of mine has the orignial sourcebook.  Because the
gas giant is radiating so much energy it creates it\'s own habitation zone
with no visable light.  Would a system such as this create a solar wind
capable of blowing the Veil away?

Ya he wasn\'t such a bad guy, he just had an idea about change and a plan
that didn\'t quite work out.

It is most likely that Lucan died in the carnage.  Lucan\'s strong hold was
at the center of what happened.  Even if the Virus didn\'t kill him it\'s
likely his people did after everything went to hell.

There\'s no mention of Strephon in any of the NE source books.  It seems
likely that he too was killed in the collapse.  Perhaps he died of old age
but he never went to the Regency and we never hear from him again.

>
>So the Zhodani did not take advantage of the chaos and attack Deneb? 

The Zhodani had their own problems to worry about.  There was some kind of
internal strife going on within the Consulate as early as 1118.  No one\'s
really sure about what was happening there and besides that with the
destruction of the Imperium the Domain of Deneb no longer represented a
threat to the Consulate so they just let them be.

>Was the Virus an intelligent collective organism capable of planning things
>or did they simply reproduce and take over things? 

This is a little more difficult to determine.  Some Virus\'s work like a
collective organism, Vampire Fleets.  Though each ship in the fleet is
self-aware they work together like a single entity.  Virus\'s intelligence
seems to vary dramatically depending upon the type of computer it infects
and the strain of virus.  The type of computer is important for the bigger
the computer, ie. more processing power, the smarter the Virus becomes.  The
Virus reproduces at a dramatic rate and most of them killed themselves off
in the initial generations.  Stranding ships in deep space, blowing
themselves up, etc.

>When did the Virus become intelligent? 

The Virus was always intelligent.  It just got more intellegent when it had
more room to grow into.  All imperial ships possessed IFF transponder\'s it
was through these transponders that most infections occurred.  The
transponder itself contained a very primitive version of virus that
interpreted information from other IFF transponders in the area and told you
who the contact was and whether they were frendly or not.  These were known
as Deyo Chips.  The Deyo\'s would chat back and forth, form their own
opinions and then tell you what was going on.

>Imagine what the virus would have been like if the Imperium had FTL
>communication. 

It was bad enough on worlds that knew what was coming imagine the worlds
that had no idea.  The X-Boat service spread most of the Virus\'s through
Imperial space.

Actually this is not entierly true.  The earliest Virus\'s simply shut
everything down, locked out all access and self terminated.  Because of the
high rate of transfer errors developed and the Virus began interpreting its
commands differently.  This development occured within a very few
generations, to a Virus thats a matter of hours or days.  These Virus\'s
began blowing up power plants when they killed themselves etc.  The
destruction got worse, starships crashed, orbital cities fell out of orbit,
everything and everything that could became murderously alive.  Part of this
could be due to the fact that human technitions, not knowing what was going
on tried to shut things down.  The virus, a sentinet entity, enterpreted
this as a hostile act by an individual desiring to kill it and acted
accordingly.

Again this is close to true but not entierly.  Most of the early strain of
Virus are dead and thus most 99% of the intially infected machines are gone.
Most of the strains that remain have resisted the suicidal urge and have
become all the more deadly and homicidal.  They are however extremely rare.
The modifiers on the encounter tables are such that travelling in the wilds
in a system with an X class starport, most systems, the odds of running into
a starship are 0 if the system has a starport the odds are better to a
maximum of 4 in 6 if you encounter an A class starport.  This added to the
fact that inorder to encouter a Vampire you have to role 13+ on 2d6 with a
maximum modifier of +3 for wilds.  The odds of ecountering a Vampire unless
the GM wishs it are slim and none and slim just left town.  Granted there is
a great potential to find virus infected equipment in the wilds.  The odds
of running into a live virus are low, again this is unless the GM wishes.
 
>> Also, there is an area shown on the maps as "the black curtain"; the text

It essentially follows the borders of Lucan\'s Stronghold and no one has any
idea of what\'s going on in there.  I think thats where the Puppeter\'s are
coming from and that they\'re producing infected equipment to send out into
the wilds.

That would work really well for me.  <g>

It would really be best to be as generic as possible, because we have
people with all kinds of systems out here...Macs, Amigas, OS/2, DOS,
TRS80, Windows and the varity of software on those systems is even
more varied.  The best way probably would be ASCII for text and comma

I just thought of something to add to that Virus idea.  And this is where
the idea breaks down.

If you allow the Program to carve it\'s own circutry it can imprint itself in
the machine and allow for it\'s re-activation after a period of domancy.
This stops players from simply picking up every piece of TL15 equipement
that\'s laying around in the wilds and knowing it\'s safe.  This adds an
element of danger everytime the players find some new gear.

How does it re-write the circuts?  God if I know...  Potentially it could
hide in magnetic bubble rams.

Well, if you want to play the it-is-the-57th-century-card, and you take a
look at data correction systems nowadays, it is conceivable (and likely)
that some computer guy somewhere said, hey, why don\'t we make self
maintaining and correcting hardware...

    'body' => 'The following is a workup of a Sylean Navy unit which would play a major 
role in the expansion of Sylea and the subsequent 3rd Imperium.  As the 
Sylean Federation (?) began its expansion, it found that its technological 
superiority allowed it to avoid a lot of fighting.  Many worlds were more 
than happy with the concept of a new interstellar government, as long as 
their own needs were seen to and their societies and ways of life were not 
affected by this new government.  Some worlds were more forceful about it, 
and gave some level of resistance to the Syleans.

Since it became apparent that the major combat units of the Sylean Navy were 
not needed for most of the more peaceful (or at least less violent) 
contacts, The Sylean Navy, in conjunction with Sylean Foreign Ministry and 
the Sylean Exploration Service, came up with the concept of the Recontact 
Squadron.  This would be a unit of 12 ships, some civilian and some naval, 
under the command of a Sylean ambassador and a naval Commodore (a Captain 
with a promotion of convenience).  The squadron consisted of:
6 Commander-class Destroyer Escorts (1000 td) 
3 Kaalimar-class Destroyers (5000 td)
2 Decision-class Assault Corvettes (5000 td)
1 Martinique-class Exploration Cruiser (5000 td).

Since the Foreign Ministry lacked a fleet of its own (beyond a collection of 
Scout and Courier ships), it was decided to use an existing naval ship, the 
Assault Corvette, as the basis of the ship\'s design.  The Exploration 
Cruiser was equipped with the best available sensor technology, room for a 
diplomatic staff of 20 people, 10 double-sized meeting rooms equipped with 
the finest in Sylean audio-visual technology, and room for 6 Sylean Scout 
ships to use for remote exploration or to establish as "pony-express" route 
of courier ships to maintain quick contact with Sylea.  The Exploration 
Cruiser was armed for self defense (and carried a 40-man Marine platton for 
security) but overall the ship was designed for peaceful uses, and great 
efforts were made to de-emphasize the military nature of the original hull 
design.

The Assault Corvette was the result of a naval cost-cutting exercise.  The 
goal was to create a vessel capable of carrying a reinforced company of 
marines throughout the Sylean Federation and to its client states on "show 
the flag" expeditions.  A marine company was not expected to be able to 
conquer a plaent, but the marines and their vehicles could certainly deliver 
a strong message when needed.  Generally, the Assault Corvette and its 
troops were little more than a mobile recruiting poster for the Sylean Navy, 
but in those cases where a rapid-response police action was called for, a 
squadron of Assault Corvettes could be "the fastest with the mostest."  Like 
the Exploration Cruiser, the Assault Corvette was based on anoterh existing 
design, the Kaalimar-class Destroyer.

The Kaalimar-class Destroyer was the light workhorse of the Sylean Navy.  
Working in conjunction with the smaller and agile Commander-class Destroyer 
Escort, the Kaalimar carried enough firepower to take on nearly all 
non-capital naval vessles of the governments surrounding the Sylean 
Federation.  Those governments capable of deploying large naval; vessels 
were handled (when necessary) by the capital ships of the Sylean Navy, but 
even then the Kaalimar would operate in support, screening the flanks of the 
main fleet and providing fast-moving raiding vessels to help their larger 
cousins.  The Kaalimar was greatly aided in this mission by its complement 
of 24 Dirk-class fighters; agile 10-ton space vessels organized into three 
8-ship squadrons (normal Sylean practice was to use the Dirk in 12-vessel 
squadrons).  A squadron of 4 Kaalimars, with their 8 Destroyer Escorts and 
96 Dirk fighters, could easily interdict the average independant spacefaring 
world until heavier fleet elements arrived.  The destroyer could also act in 
a "show the flag" mission, as each ship carried a 40-man marine platoon.

The Commander-class Destroyer Escort was one of the newest designs in the 
Sylean fleet at the time of the Imperium\'s formation.  This ship was the 
first jump-capable vessel in the Sylean Navy to be equipped with thrusters 
capable of 6G acceleration.  In addition to its great speed and agility, the 
Commander-class carried a respectable suite of weapons, as well as a 12-man 
Marine squad and a 40-ton Pinnace.  In addition to its role as a screening 
unit in the heavy squadrons of the Sylean Navy, the Commander-class was used 
to support the Kaalimar-class Destroyer and as a general merchant convoy 
protector and escort.

I shall be posting the four designs separately.

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS NOT INTENDED TO BE THE STARTING POINT OF A
FLAME WAR!!!!!   DIRECT ANY FLAMES TO MY PERSONAL EMAIL ADDRESS ABOVE!!!  I
ENJOY READING A FLAMELESS DIGEST!!!!!!!


This source of tension was the original idea behind Virus IIRC.  I\'m not
sure about the original location, but I seem to remember reading somewhere
that GDW suggested that ref\'s not overuse Virus, but let it reside in the
background to keep the players on their toes.  

A while back I posted the statistical probablilties on running upon a random
Virus during normal ship travel.  I was amazed at how rare Virus was.  I
have a copy of the original posting if anyone is interested, but to me it
showed quite plainly that Virus was more a means to an end (RC setting)
rather than an end in itself.

I don\'t think so, DS.  The 5ft x 4ft x 1ft(to 1.5ft) block described above
represents a solid.  A motorcycle has mucho void areas.  (I\'m assuming
you\'re using 4ft to be to the top of the handlebars since your inseam
probably isn\'t 4ft.)  True, a block 5ft (1.5m) x 4ft (1.2m) x 1ft (.3m)
would give you .6 kiloliters, but .6 Td , I don\'t think so.  More like .043
Td, a far cry from the 7 kiloliter, .5 Td listed in the Trav books!!!

Just for fun, here\'s how big the Grav Bike in the book would have to be
based on the 5\' x 4\' x 1\' example: (Just a reminder, this is a BLOCK, no
empty space)

        at 5\' (1.5m)             at 4\' (1.2m)            at 1\'
        1\'x51\'(0.3m x 15.5m)    1\'x64\'(0.3m x 19.5m)    1\'x255\'(0.3m x 77.7m)
        2\'x26\'(0.6m x 7.9m)     2\'x32\'(0.6m x 9.8m)     2\'x128\'(0.6m x 39.0m)
        3\'x17\'(0.9m x 5.2m)     3\'x21\'(0.9m x 6.4m)     3\'x85\' (0.9m x 25.9m)

        5\'x10\'(1.5m x 3.0m)     5\'x13\'(1.5m x 4.0m)     5\'x51\' (1.5m x 15.5m)

Just a few numbers to think about.  The sizes in traveller are too BIG!!!!

I think we\'ve kind of run this thread through its course...  Maybe 
next time I\'ll try letting my people pick from the lists and see what 
they come up with.  I\'ll reserve further judgment until several 
months of now (probably when I run my first Milieu 0 campaign).

That and the fact that I just don\'t think somebody at GDW was all 
that interested in creating Merchant style adventures...

I won\'t argue this.  But I think they were worried about 
self-sufficiency in terms of recovering relic technology.

Actually, I was thinking more of some of the world-detailing ideas.  
I\'d strongly recommend either of these 2 books for anybody looking to 
run a campaign.  Lots of great ideas...

A lot of people just didn\'t buy into Virus.  Certainly a lot of them 
had no desire to, but some just didn\'t buy the arguments presented in 
TNE & Survival Margin.  To me the concept of self-aware machines gone 
mad was intriguing, and possible.  Some people either didn\'t want to 
or wouldn\'t buy into Virus as presented...

No argument here.  IMHO, self-awareness would be both a hardware & 
software challenge.

Stronger than presented in TNE.  But I\'d kind of come to this 
conclusion earlier.

is coming at you, you\'ve pretty much had it.  So how about keeping them 
from coming at you in the first place?
	If you\'re the kind of planet that worries about .1c rocks, then 
one solution would be to build a set of computer controlled orbital 
observatories which keep tabs on big rocks in your system.  Before you 
scoff, let me point out that this is still going to be a lot easier than 
surrounding your planet with debris shields or playing interplanetary 
billiards by bouncing other big rocks off of incoming big rocks.

Prevention measure #1
	The orbital observatory system would first catalogue all the
likely dinosaur killers in the system (BIG number) and then would check on
each of them, say, once a week.  This would be an enormous number of rocks
to check, but you don\'t have to look at them long, or with any great 
resolution, just well enough so that the computer can see that they have 
not been perturbed from their orbit.  A large number of automated 
observatories flicking their gaze from rock to rock would be expensive no 
doubt, but still less expensive then a whole new planet :-)

Prevention measure #2
	Patrols.  What are SDBs for if not to catch lunatics trying to 
destroy your planet?  Okay, so space is big, but a populous world can 
afford a whole bunch of 400Td SDBs.

Prevention measure #3
	Everyone has to file flight plans, not just in your system, but in
every system.  Flight plans are kept up to date by travelling ships
themselves.  Each one is required to carry encrypted updated flight plans
for all traffic to its current destination. (Sort of like X-Net in the
Regency, only just for flight plans).  If a ship fails to show up when it
was supposed to, its declared overdue and everyone\'s on the look out for
it.  This helps resuces, anti-piracy, anti-smuggling, all kinds of things. 
It also lets you know if there are any potential terrorists in the
subsector who might lurking in your outer system pushing rocks at you. 

	Trying to stop .1c rocks is like trying to get all the toothpaste 
back in the tube.  Ain\'t gonna happen.  Rational beings will try to keep 
.1c rocks from happening in the first place.

of power allocated for additional weapons (but no hull area available) or

"off the shelf" after all.  (possibly a redundant drive system or something

         In all, the design system seems pretty straightforward and solid.

Notes:          hull config: needle, airframe.  Engineering shop and sickbay
equiped.  FPP requires 15 hours to refine 300 disp tons of fuel sufficient
for jump-3.  This ship uses modern TL 12 fusion, and thrusterplate drive
systems.  overpower: 143 MW spare.

        A fairly new design (entering service circa -03 on the new Imperial
calender), the Repulse class interdictor is well suited to its role as a
rapid deployment / piracy suppression vessel.  Heavily armed, defended, and
equiped with the most modern power and drive systems; these vessels possess
a marked tactical advantage over similar sized vessels in the threat
inventory.  This class of vessel also retains a large configurable cargo
hold and power surplus which allows it to be configured for special missions
as needed.  
        Although considered to be "comfortable" from the crew berthing
perspective (even the marines recieve single occupancy staterooms), these
vessels are not equiped with any sort of small craft.  This deficiency
prevents the vessel from being able to render any sort of orbital support to
"landed" marines, but its airframe hull does allow it to function in a close
air support role if absolutely necessary.  This design reflects the current
low crew fatigue design philosophy, allowing these vessels to operate for
extended tours as needed.

I practice law in California, so I don\'t think of it as a civil law
jurisdiction.  You\'re quite right, however, about civil law influence on the
California Code.  The California Code is huge compared to other state codes,
much more like a civil code than a common law set of statutes.

It sounds to me like GDW needed a way to destroy the Imperium of the past, but
still have something left. In MT they were hinting that the Deneb would
be a stand-alone empire. The Virus gave them:
1. A destroyed empire.
2. A single enemy to reunify anyone who was left. They got this enemy rather
cheaply, without having the spend the time developing some very high 
tech malicious alien.

We have to assume that the foundation of circuitry in the 57th 
century is drastically different than now. If they use molecular/organic
computers for instance, they simply can inject new DNA or some other 
encoding mechanism into to the organic structure of the computer. 

Neural Net hardware would be much more flexible than Von-Neumann based 
architectures. The neurons and signal connections may not have predefined
functions.

  I _love_ your historical localisation of the imperial cultures!
  Anyway, you might say that the SCA has influenced my Traveller
by having a lot more politics, sort of. Internal imperial politics become
significant.
  For example, at one point a fief (several systems) falls to one
fellow who is more into pleasing the elite of local governments
rather than protecting and encouraging trade (which is the role
of the Imperial Nobility in my universe). With popular (and commercial)
support (a minor) Dutchess Margaret (no relation) rises against
him. The Navy, although they hate the legitimate heir, are forced
to fight against her.
  The Scouts, however, have a freer interpretation. The players,
who are on a scout courier mission at the time, have their mission
changed. They are, instead, to run an espionage mission for the
scouts on behalf of the Navy. The mission takes them to the head-
quarters of a band of pirates supporting the rebelling Dutchess.
They meet the leader, "The Hen" (herself based on the 16th century
Irish pirate Granuail or Grace O\'Malley). Having won her confidence
over a game of pool she gives them a chance to run a mission for
her.
  This takes them on some specially calculated jump routes and
they end up alongside a mercenary cruiser on a crash course
for the Duke\'s head-quarters. The players are faced with the following
choices: they can board and deflect its course and save the Duke.
Or they can board and guide it down, insuring that the strike is clean.
My players choose the latter, bailing out at the last minute. Because
of their last-minute guidence the impact was precise enough to only
take out the Duke in his bunker and the general troops and civilians
were undisturbed.
  The Navy breathes a sigh of relief and now answers to the Dutchess.
[Now the SCA bit.] The players are given various accolades and
awards. One of which is a disused Imperial Packet (one of Rob Dean\'s
designs) and a lisence to refurbish it as a trader. They then asked for
a "By Royal Appointment" and permission to display the Dutchess\'s
coat of arms on the ship and letterhead.

  Basically, Noble patronage is worth something. On a different level,
an oath of fealty is even higher. Most citizens of the Imperium are
bound by "fidelity and loyalty" to the government of the Imperium. Only
some are actually bound by "an oath of fealty" to a particular noble.
This isn\'t taken lightly by most nobles as it implies obligations on
both sides.
  In a more general campaign, such can be the basis of many adventure
hooks. They might dreadfully impress a noble who offers them the chance
to swear fealty. Players might seek out a noble and offer their services
(but may have to do some things to show they are worthy).
  Players with an oath of fealty on record can expect special leniant
treatment when in that noble\'s domain or when dealing with any other
retainers. They might also attract grief from those opposed to the noble.
  Players who have taken, and then broken, an oath of fealty will forever
be considered "oathbreakers" and reviled by most nobles, noble
institutions, and retainers. [Note it is honourable enough to ask to be
released from an oath of fealty for legitimate reasons.]

  Heraldry is, perhaps, the last influence that the SCA has had on my
Imperial campaign. The arms and badges of various nobles and
institutions are important as they are used to mark ownership. If you
know your heraldry well (or have the appropriate chip for your
computer) it can add useful clues.

Ironically that is why I find Virus *as it was implemented* so hard to
swallow.  The TNE manual specifically states that it came from *silicon*
based life forms.  The odds are that advanced computer systems will *not*
be silicon based, as we have nearly exhausted the computational limits of
silicon (one can only make circuit paths so small before electrons start
bumping into one another).  Research is already underway on organic, DNA
based computing, as well as other molecular models.

This is true even of today\'s neural nets.

Yeah, it takes a while for new role-players to understand this isn\'t a 
game you set out to "win."  The temptation is always there to treat it 
like one does any other type of game (or sport for that matter), and 
attempt to get the indestructable character with the perfect strategy, 
when playing any sort of character can (and should) be a great deal of 
fun.  So long as the referee isn\'t a sadist, playing a character with the 
stats 222222 and with few skills can be a blast.  It just depends on how 
that character is played, and what sort of imagination the referee and 
player have.

So, I can see where the a pick-your-character system would have appeal to 
newbies over the CT one.  And, really, such a system also has potential 
for true role-players, as they can craft the character they most want to 
play.  After all, if I really want to play that character above, I\'m 
going to have as hard a time rolling him up as I would trying to get a 
super-character. :)  

The CT system can be likened to the "Who\'s line is it anyway" style of 
Improv, where a third party tells the improvisational actors what part to 
play, while a TNE-style character creation system is more like being a 
regular actor.

Hmmm.  I remember a CT adventure based on silicon life forms.  Don\'t 
recall which one it was, though.  Signal GK?  Hmmm.  Anyway, there was 
precedent in the canon for this scenario.

True, but did TNE say the silicon life forms developed naturally (as 
they did in that adventure whose name I don\'t recall), or were they 
engineered?  If the former, it doesn\'t matter what sort of tech other 
life forms were using...natural selection decided these life forms would 
be based on silicon, not something else.

Or am I missing something?  I\'m not familiar with TNE, so I\'m just going 
on what I\'ve seen posted here.

Why should a lower thrust to weight ratio for fusion than todays turbofans?
You don\'t put a fusion engine in a ship for good thrust to mass, you do it
for good delta-v to loaded mass fuel included. The same can be said about
Gregs argument about diesel power vs fusion.

Probably and it is not that hard to imagine. I however prefer design rules
like this:
Fusion drive: 5 m3 + 0,1 m3 per tom of thrust. This gives you a minimum
size as well as a scale efficiency. In my design system jumpdrives work
like that so you could put a jumpdrive in a considerably smaller valume
than 100 dTon but the percentage of th drive+fuel makes it economically
impractical. In year 1117 Pondwater & Smiff LIC put out a small 100 m3 J1
ship for leisure use with a pricetag of sligthly above 10 MCr, sort of a
"poor" mans Yacht.

I\'m shure Dave Golden is American as every european knows that one doesn\'t
measure anything in kiloliters, that was a unit invented by DGP for unknown
reasons. Kiloliters and m3 are exactly the same but the former doesn\'t
exist in the real world and the latter is harder to write on crummy

Yes, GDW wanted to destroy the Imperium as all the detailing of it where
done by DGP and perhaps GDW wanted to regain control of its creation. What
they did was making all published material useless (hoping that the dumb
suckers would buy all the new books from them) but most referees I have

Just because Eurpoeans doent use them does not mean kiloliters don\'t
exist.  They do, look in a chemistry textbook in the "measurments" section

I used to use something similar. Basically it was a frame, with an engine,
computer, fuel tank, scoops, and a laser of some sort mounted on it. These
things were turned out in large numbers and dumped into orbit round gas giants,
in asteroid belts etc,etc. Basically they would sit in a system, checking
ships for transponder readings etc,etc, and if anything came in that they
didn\'t recognise, then they would come out looking for a scrap. Not too
much of a problem singly, but if you get a pack of 10 or 20 looking for
trouble...and they transmit the data between themselves...

Jurors here have to make up their minds too.  The net effect of "Not Proven"
for the defendant is the same as "Not Guilty" since a defendant is presumed
innocent until proven guilty.  The verdict is rarely used, but has been
quite controversial recently after it was returned at the end of a
high-profile murder trial, the principle argument against it being
redundancy and the secondary argument being that it was\'nt well understood
by jury-members.  Nevertheless, it remains an option for juries at present.
I assume the second comment above was prompted by the first, which to my
understanding is incorrect.

Just to let you know

The n-body problem doesn\'t apply at all. At those speeds you can
practically plot the rock\'s course as a straight line. 

The problem is that you have to get the ship to the right place at the
right time. Being able to hit the rock depends mostly on how accurately
you can determine its position and velocity at any given time, and how
accurately you can point the ship. You need to get to a point in space
(plus or minus 50 meters) at the same time the rock is going to be
there (plus or minus the time it takes the rock to move 50 meters).

It\'s the timing that\'ll get you. You have to be at that point (+- 50 m)
at a time plus or minus half a *microsecond*. No second chance.

Work out the angular accuracy required to make the 50 meter accuracy
after a couple days of high g boost. Then consider how accurately you
have to be able to boost, to make the *time*.

Not quite. breaking it up after it gets within a certain radius will be
worse than leaving it alone. And "vaporizing" it close in is the
*worst* thing you can do.

Just remember the required accuracy. I\'m not even sure that it is
*possible* to manage an intercept. The only reason the rock vs planet
works is that the planet is a *big* target.

Hey, any engineer will tell you that\'s just a matter of having a safety
factor. Remember, folks have designed ships to be propelled by
detonated nuclear bombs behind a shield plate!

Actually, I think a 12 =gauge loaded with birdshot might be better. :-)

How about Islamic Law? Ignoring the weirdness the Islamic fundies have
come up with (they twist things about as much as Christian fundies
do!), I understand it\'s a "reasonable" system, just very *different*. 
(Probably counts as "civil law")

Hmmmm. I may have to dig up a Koran and some commentaries. I can just
see the players landing on an Islamic planet. :-)

ps. as I understand it, a lot of English common law dates back to
*Norse* influences.

Why waste a perfectly good nuke grenade? Besides, it got the point
across. It\'s much better to show someone that you could have blown them
away if you\'d felt like it than to actually blow them away. Unless they
are nut cases (or *stupid*) they will decide that they shouldn\'t mess
with you, *and* they\'ll try to convince their buddies that it ain\'t
healthy to mess with you.

If you do blow them away, their buddies may go looking for you.

And if they *do* turn out to be stupid, there\'s always the grenade you
*didn\'t* use. :-)

(Personally, I find that a light bulb full of gasoline tends to get the
message across... <click><Whoosh!> ARRRRRGGHH! :-)

BTW, how many of you have players who couldn\'t resist the classic "box gag"?

There\'s a box, with two inset panels and a button. One panel is lit
from behind, and says "Press to test". The other is dark, and you can\'t
tell what it\'ll say when lit (lettering is on the inside).

I\'m sure most of you recognize it. For those who don\'t....

If someone is foolish enough to press the button, the first panel goes
dark, and the second one lights up. It says "Release to detonate".


:-)

(I\'ve gotta *build* one of those... They\'d sell well. :-)

A few useful nasties I\'ve heard of:

"accidentally" drop a grenade while trying to break contact with the
enemy. Won\'t they get a surprise when they discover that it\'s rigged
for 0 delay? (ie pull the pin, release the spoon, *boom*)

slip some "doctored" ammo into the supply chain. Charlie doesn\'t like
it when his AK-47 feeds a round that has had the powder charge replaced
with C4!

And a real nasty for the anti-terrorist folks. Intercept a shipment of
black market supplies for the insurgents. Replace the fuse cord with
detcord rigged to *look* like fuse. (fuse burns at feet per minute.
Detcord "burns" at medium mach numbers:-)

Sure, the ground provides a "shadow" for both the blast and the
fragments. 

Now try that with the grenade hanging 3 feet in the air. :-)

The power consumption for thrust-plate maneuver drives was wrong.  It should
be 1Mw per cubic meter of drive.  I made a formula error in converting to
QSDS (which uses displacement tons for volume calculations), and had them
using 1Mw per displacement ton of drive - too low by a factor of 14.

The latest version of QSDS, 1.2 incorporates this correction (this is the

And before folks complain about how "dangerous" this is, consider the
number of people who freeze to death in the Midwest every winter
because their power failed. Or the folks who die in the summer because
they have no air conditioning. 

In a ship, most people won\'t realize how much they depend on the ship.
But the crew will. Or the crew won\'t live to pay off the mortgage. :-)

You can send me a copy. I can run Lotus, plus my preferred spreadsheet
(Mutiplan) reads *.wk? files. I can also convert to SYLK(a text only

The big problem is that the anti-rock slinger is as dangerous as the
rock! :-)

But your final worry is groundless. Unless the momenta come close to
cancelling, but don\'t quite, the rock will never come back. It\'s *way*
above system escape velocity. There\'s a rather narrow range of
velocities that\'ll keep it as part of the system (say under 42 km/s)
but not be slow enough for the orbit to hit the star. 

Hmmm. Now *there* is a thought. A fractional c asteroid calculated to
*cancel* the orbital velocity of the planet. Sure, the planet would go
to pieces, but most of the pieces would fall into the sun. (note, if
you stop the earth in it\'s orbit it\'ll take 131 days to reach the Sun).

On the Discover Channel they showed civilian submarines that you
*can* buy for a quite reasonable price (i.e., no more than the cost
of a house :-). Apparently, recent innovations in sealing plastic
bubbles together made it possible not only to build really *deep*
submersibles, but also to build cheap small-to-midsized subs. They
are able to remain submerged for a week or two at a time and run
on both deisel and electric power.

Now *that* would be a great toy!

Actually Joe you\'ve hit the nail on the head.  Virus is the direct 
decendent of the Cymbline chips found in "Signal GK."  The only 
difference is these chips have been enhanced through selective breeding 
and programing.  Unfortunately though they got the chips to do what they 
wanted they never figured out how to control them.  When they were 
accidentally released all hell broke lose.

Exactly, by 1201, unless you live on Promise, Virus is the exception rather 
than the rule and you\'re much more likely to be killed or captured by 
xenophobic humans than by Virus.

Ya, that\'d be him.  I don\'t know whether I trust him.  I\'m a trusting 
person who beleives that no life form is inherently evil, it\'s merely 
circumstance that makes it evil.  

I think Sandman has seen the writing on the wall and knows something 
bad is coming so rather than making a deal with his people he\'s 
cutting a deal with who he perceives to be the ultimate victor in the 
struggle.  It\'s self preservation really.  He\'s got a choice, the 
Puppeter\'s are storming out of Core and he can\'t side with them, 
that\'d be suicide so he\'s cutting a deal with the devil he knows will 
keep him alive.

This is not entierly true.  The biggest challange facing both the Regency 
and the RC is not Virus but rather the unwillingness of the peoples of 
the wilds to rejoin an interstellar civilization.  Look where it got them 
last time.  As it say\'s in the Regency Soruce Book, the people of Deneb 
figured they\'d just walk back in and everyone would love to see them, 
they had no idea they\'d have to fight  when they returned.  Okay that\'s 
not a direct quote but its got the gist.

I don\'t beleive that virus "ate".  It parasitized the other chips and 
wrote it\'s code onto them.  I believe I read somewhere that virus has a 
real problem when working with Fiberoptic based computers.  

Is there a down side to organic computers?  How do you keep the organic 
part alive?  Is it vulnerable to electromagnetic radiation?  These are 
serious questions.

Technical quibble:  A brown dwarf would produce negligible amounts of 
UV.  Read up on "blackbody radiation" for the details.  But yes, I 
suppose a habitable world in close orbit around a brown dwarf would hold 
onto the Veil longer than would, say, Earth.  In fact, one could end up 
with a smoke ring effect, a la the Io plasma torus or the setting of 
Larry Niven\'s "The Integral Trees" -- a donut-shaped volume of gas and 
dust around the central body, with Trin sitting in it at one point.  
Interesting idea, that...

BTW, I don\'t have any of my references handy, but I am fairly certain that
the Veil is described not as a ring (i.e., more or less planar) but as a
shell, completely surrounding Trin.  Obviously, there\'s no UPP code for
that, so it gets entered as a ring -- but that\'s how I believe it was
handled in the text.

It\'s Signal GK, and the TNE book even mentions the chips (from Cybemline?)
were part of the Virus\' evolution.  One of the Challenge magazines had an
article explaining the connection between Virus and Signal GK.

    'body' => 'The current thread regarding the economics of trading is interesting in a 
couple of ways. First, for all the people that complained that the RC 
setting is too militaristic, people have certainly been cramming a lot of 
milspec components and weapons into their ship (Caddy, hand me my meson 
spinal mount ;-)
Second I think that (as many have pointed out) we\'ve been using the wrong 
economic model.  That mythic 1000 cr/ton is a standard shipping rate 
inside the \'protected\' Imperium...what else do they have the Navy for, 
anyway?

So, in that spirit, I present the \'YugoBox\' class of simple freighters: 
no armor, no weapons, no passengers, just a hole in space to fill with
stuff and move it from point A to point B. I used the cheapest possible
(but modern TL 12) components, but included fuel refining capability,
since the hull design comes with scoops anyway. 

YugoBox class Simple Trader (QDS modular construction)

Jump 1 version
Tons	200	Volume 2800		Cost 26.4 (incl QDS discount)
Crew	4	Passengers H/M/L 	0/0/0
Cargo	154.7	Controls Std.		TL 12
Size	8		Jump	1				
			G-rate	1
			Power	0.8
			Fuel 	20 SR
			Sensors 1A 3P 0J
Armor	0		Structure	6 (Box Streamlined)

Jump 2 version
Tons	200	Volume 2800		Cost 26.9 (incl QDS discount)
Crew	4	Passengers H/M/L 	0/0/0
Cargo	154.7	Controls Std.		TL 12
Size	8		Jump	2				
			G-rate	1
			Power	0.8
			Fuel 	40 SR
			Sensors 1A 3P 0J
Armor	0		Structure	6 (Box Streamlined)

Using the full crew rating, and Book 2 figures for costs, assuming a full 
cargo hold, the jump 1 version is profitable after 11 trips/year, the 
jump 2 after 14.

(A trip is calculated as 1 week in jump/1 week out.) That puts a maximum 
of 23 trips/year, since 2 weeks/year are given over to maintenence. This 
also assumes buying unrefined fuel at 100 cr/ton. If you\'re cheap and 
scoop your own fuel, that adds 2kCr for the J1 and 4 kCr to the J2 
version per trip of profit.

				Profit (loss) /trip	(kCr)			
				J1			J2
Trips/Year		5	(169.88)	5	(198.98)
			10	(12.44)	10	(38.99)
			15	40.04 	15	14.34
			20	66.28 	20	41.01
			23	76.55 	23	51.44

Multiply this figure times the number of trips to calculate the total 
profit/loss on an annual basis.

Most importantly, as a PC ship, needing to make only 11 or 14 standard 
trips/year leaves 12 or 9 weeks/ year for speculative trading. If you\'re 
good at it, spec trading will pay this puppy off in a hurry.

Of course, this design doesen\'t allow for much in the way of surviving a 
fight (or running away), it\'s the spacelanes equivalent of a tramp 
frieghter or Liberty Ship...cheap holes in space.

Next design...the Yugobus class 200 T Cheap passenger ship...the feeder

Now that I\'ve learned from this discussion, the whole idea of the Virus 
sounds much more realistic.  GDW seems to have done as good a job with 
the Virus era as they did with all previous eras.  I should probably try 
it sometime.

Only thing is, I\'m so fond of the "nice future" of CT, and so tired of 
"dark future" stories that it\'s unlikely I would enjoy it . . . no matter 
how well-done it is.  

I saw the boxed set of T:NE (rule book, FF&S, etc. in it) at the local 
game store the other day.  Perhaps I should have bought it, if only for 
reference.

I\'m not to familiar with the extended system generation rules.  I only 
became a GM of Traveller a few weeks ago.  It is possible to though to 
create a "Main World" in orbit of a gas giant that receives very little 
visable light.  In such a system would the Gas Giant/brown dwarf be 
considered a star for purposes of the Stellar type ie. G5 V or would it 
simply be subsumed in the system and ignored in the stellar 
classification.

I used to have this data but what do the various stellar classifications 
stand for.  I think that the earths is a G5 V, Main sequence yellow star.
 what do the other letters stand for?  Red Giant, White Dwarf?  Or are 
they just color?  Wait just a sec...  Letter refers to color, Number 
refers to Luminosity and Roman Numeral refers to size.  Is that how it 
goes?

    'body' => 'Hi!

	What *I* like to do (meaning, nobody else in the world,
usually :) is to use a SINGLE roll during generation, with the
appropriate DMs:
Suppose the target is 8, but it depends on the career of the
character;
Roll	Diff from Target	Result	Meaning
2	-6			Death	Character is dead, big fumble
4	-4			Wound	Was wounded (or demoted
twice)
6	-2			Demoted	Lose a rank - if you fall
below 0, you\'re fired
8	0			Keep on generating
10	+2			Comission	Get rank 1
12	+4			Promotion	Gain 1 rank

Don\'t forget the DM\'s.  I prefer this system over the 3 rolls (death,
comission, promotion) because it\'s faster although you lose a tiny
bit of game detail.  Also you have very unlikely to die, which
shouldn\'t happen, really, during character generation, because
there\'s no point to it!  unless you\'re playing solo.

Also I like the idea of having some control over your skill selection
- - in real life you do have some control over what you want to study,
but you don\'t always have the chance to to what you want.

So what I like is a system where you ROLL your \'duty\', and you get
to pick a skill in a skill table associated with that duty.
(i.e. you don\'t really get to chose what happens to you in life,
but you try to make the best of it.)

Actually that could open an interesting vista to character
generation, where your \'duty\' is actually a setback or something,
and you get to choose which setback you prefer for your character so 
you both get a character you like and isn\'t too 1-dimensional.  
It might be a \'killer char\', but he might have flaws.

Anyways, just my 2 cents (Quebecois :) worth. :)

Well, somebody trying to mount a meson gun on a merchant is not 
building a merchant ship, to begin with.  Every bit of canon I\'ve 
seen considers them to be military...

Oh, you mean the YugoBox class of derelicts.  Sorry, but there is no 
such thing as space protected that well in the Imperium.  Piracy was 
and would be a continuous problem everywhere within the Imperium, 
even at the core.  Or did you think the Imperium stationed all those 
SDB\'s & Gazelle Close Escorts in Core sector for military parades?  
As a pirate, I\'d be licking my chops to puncture the hull into a few 
of these ships.  Be easier than stealing candy from a baby...

Nice design, but I didn\'t even necessarily buy into the unarmed XBoat 
concept...let alone stepping on board an unarmed Merchant.

The Liberty ship comparison isn\'t all that good either.  WW2 
Merchant ships were almost routinely armed with a deckgun, and there 
are accounts of merchant ships sinking or damaging U-Boats (the 20th century 
equivalent of the corsair).

Ya dark future does get kind of...well depressing after a while doesn\'t 
it?  I think the thing with TNE is there\'s a ray of hope because you\'re 
involved in rebuilding the future after so much senceless destruction.  
There\'s a quote at the begining of the book that kind of sums it up.

"I don\'t get it.  How did the Imperials build and empire of 11,000 worlds 
and then throw it all away like it was a bunch of garbage?  There are 
entire airless worlds out there where a billion people died when the 
lifesupport ran out.  There are bombed out starports that are still 
radioactive, and there are people out there who call themselves \'human\' 
who are murdering each other just to be king of some scrap heap that\'s so 
deep in dead bodies that it just makes you want to puke.
  I\'ve been out there a half dozen times, and if that doesn\'t give you 
religion, I don\'t know what does.  Yeah, I know, religion shmeligion, 
where did it get them?  It\'s not where it got them, its where we\'re 
going.  This is history, pal, from here on out.  If you don\'t want to be 
in on it, get the hell outta my way.
  We didn\'t come this far to become extinct on 11,000 separate isolated 
worlds.  By Allah, by Buddah, by Krishna, by God--we were created for 
better than that.  Those stars out there--we had them once, and we\'ll 
have them again.  Nothing\'s going to stop us.

I like Rebba, there\'s a poetry and eloquence to what she says.  This is 
about history, where individual efforts make a difference and are not 
lost in the cosmic background noise.  Where failing a mission means more 
than a loss of quarterly profits.  I think it\'s a great quote and it sums 
the whole thing up.

I\'m not going to tell you one way or another whether to buy it.  There\'s 
some interesting stuff in there.  There\'s some garbage, but all in all 
it\'s a good product.  

I think perhaps the main reason it failed, other than that T$R thing 
which we shall never mention again, is because it destroyed the Imperium. 
 Everything comfortable and familiar was swept away in an instant and GDW 
expected people to simply deal with it.  Had they published the Regency 
source book first I think it would have been better received but instead 
they went with something completely different whether that choice was 
ultimately right or wrong I\'m not going to judge, I like the RC, but it 
did in a way cost the company it\'s life.

FF&S is a good supplement, the whole thing is you can\'t get discouraged 
while designing your first starship, it\'s a complicated poorly organized 
book but once you\'ve done it once or twice suddenly the book makes 
complete sence and it\'s really easy to create a starship.  I can do it in 
under an hour now.  Sure if I want something really custom it takes 
longer but a quick hack job is pretty fast.

The Post Collapse info on Diaspora is simply, tables of UPP codes, but it 
gives you an idea of the devestation that was caused by Virus.

I\'d say its worthy of a look through, whether you want to spend your 
money on it is your choice but it is worth of a look through.

most of the ships being posted are designed to TL 12 specifications, when

Leaving out the rules differences for the time being (IMO, rules are a
matter of personal preference), I don\'t think GDW made all published
material useless.  There has been a lot of discussion about how rules
systems exist apart from background.  All of the CT/MT era background
information can still be used!  If you like the TNE rules but not the
background, just use the rules with the old background.  Saying that GDW
made "all published material useless" is like saying that when Mark Miller
and Imperium Games comes out with Mileau 200: Aslan Border Wars, all the
information in Mileau 0: The Third Imperium will be made useless!!  This is
simply not true.  I will use the background setting of TNE with the new
Traveller until they get around to publishing new material on the RC.  The
RC is my preferred setting, but I wouldn\'t say that MMT is going to
invalidate the material for TNE that GDW produced simply because they are
putting in a revised or completely new rules system.

I just printed out your trading system posts, and I\'ve gone through 
them.   It looks good.  I love the trading aspect of Traveller, and your 
system looks like it will lend itself to not only better trading 
simulation, but better role-playing as well.  It\'s well-written and 
understandable.

There\'s just one possible problem with using the system that I can see...

Maybe I\'m wrong, but the 1D per population number rule seems like it would 
make it really hard to get many of the goods on higher population 
worlds.  As you probably know, the greater the number of dice thrown, 
the steeper the curve.  That is, on a Population 9 world the resulting 
table will yield results that are at the top of the curve (the middle of 
the table) very, very often and the rest of the results in the table 
will come up only once in a while.  

I\'m afraid I haven\'t come up with a better system, though, so this isn\'t 
too constructive.  :(   I just wanted to point this out before you got 
too far with the system, when things get really difficult to change.


- -Joe

PS:  Oh, maybe the old method...uh...you know, where instead of reading a 
roll of "5" and "1" as "6," you read it as "51"...would be of use.  That 
way, you could come up with a table based on more dice as the population 
increases, and avoid the curve.  Hmmm.  Well, just a thought anyway.

Bruce, 

These designs are a great idea!  Why not have unarmed/unarmored ships?  I 
mean, it\'s not like every passenger plane/train/ship/bus in the world is 
armored, let alone armed! :)  Very realistic.  Referees will have to take 
care not to go overboard on the number of Pirates roaming around space 
(if there were tons, then this sort of ship would quickly be abandoned by 
all but the most foolhardy of traders!) so as to make the universe 
consistent.  
Otherwise, I see no reason why there shouldn\'t be such ships commonly 
used throughout the more secure areas of the Imperium.

Great job!

I agree.  I wish I knew more about the future of the RC.  When I sent 
that quote to Joe I came across another Quote in the book that I\'d read a 
thousand time that suddenly made me shudder.

"As attractive as we might find their life-style (this give me hopes that 
the RC is still around), or what they claim to have stood for, we must 
never forget that they were murderers (this is the part that makes me 
shudder, "claim to have stood for").  And if, as they claim, their way 
was the only way to reknit humaniti (god I hate that spelling) together, 
we must be even more vigilant that we never allow civiliztion to get to 
the point that the \'Star Vikings\' methods are the only means to our

This quote scares me and makes me think that the RC and the Regency go to 
war or at least duke it out for a while.

yes. At work (novel netware, 10 station lan, Groupwise) we got a virus or
two in attatchments containing software upgrades.

Agreed, tho, the virus is silly due to the fact it can hit *ANY* computer
system. Unless you assume the imperium has required a stadardized (or
hardware translated) machine code schema.

Having a BA in History, with an emphasis on Russia, and 40 Cr(Sem) in
music, and anthoer 10 in Physical Geography, It has shaped my imperium into
a cross between brittish style nobles without power and russian
"renaissance" (1850-1900) semi-parliamentary, pwerful nobles and
businesses, and a fading "enlightened Despotism" and military dominated by
militarily gained patents of nobility. Social ranks above 12 can only be
earned for service; a duke\'s children can earn that duchy easier than a
baron\'s, but until they have served, they are both barons... Admirals and
Generals cannot go above 1 star without being at least knights, two stars
at baron, 3 at viscount 4 at marquis, and 5 at count, and the 6stars
(service head) for a domain or the imperium must be dukes.

Major distinctions in authority for a landed noble vs a military noble vs a
civilian service noble, but the same social ranks... I also see locals
being allowed to style themselves on whatever pattern the locals choose,
but off their world, they must use their "Imperial Title".

Also, add in a dose of "TANSTAAFL"... Lots of SCA style pomp at imperial
courts on all levels, and hefty doses of SCA style respect for those in
power.

That was the standard in MegaTraveller... failed SR meant enough time in
rehab to force one out of service with a short term. Death was the optional
rule.

Which is a mirror of CT, which, in all editions I have read, had an option
to convert death to injury during CGen.

cubic meters are the same as kilolitres. 1L= 10cm x 10cm x 10cm

10x10x10 blocks of 1l (IE: 1m x 1m x 1m) = 1000 L or 1 KL

Tons Displacement is 14KL=14m^3. It refers to volume displacement of LHyd.
(and actually varies, based upon temp, pressure, etc, to 13 and 15 KL per
TD in real world terms... (See Perry\'s Chem Engr Hndbk.)

It is nice to finally have someone agree with me.  I don\'t think during the
previous discussion that anyone wanted to hear this little bit of info,
cause no one commented on any of my "Virus is Rare" Posts.  :)

Yeah, I knew you didn\'t do the math, but I also knew you asked the original

I think Sandman is a Hiver in disguise!!  Talk about intrigue.  No, I really
don\'t, but consider the possible connections to the Hiver.  The Hiver
learned to control the Virus and planted Sandman to manipulate the RC into
accepting the Hiver strain Virus.  The Hiver are in contact with the Black
Curtain Society and are negotiating for the control of the petty humans.
The Hiver created the Virus originally to get Humans under control. (OK, I
kinda stole that last idea.)

Really, I think Hiver and Sandman would get along well, so long as the Hiver
could hold their curiosity in check and refrain from "opening the box" so to
speak.  (Have you ever seen a paranoid virus?)  ;)

Of course it would be easier than stealing candy from a baby to knock off 
one of those Yugo ships.  But, like my example of the character with the 
stats of 222222, if the referee and players want to have a 
universe/setting wherein that type of ship can survive and/or have an 
interesting and fun time, then why not?  Heck, it don\'t bother me if 
group X wants their Imperium to be secure at its\' center.

My Imperium has historically been a wee bit more dangerous, and I don\'t 
doubt Milieux 0 will be even more so...but, like I said, why not? :)  
It\'s a new idea, and that\'s nice to see.

   Nope, but every _MEDIC_ should have medic skills - that\'s what a medic
DOES.

  YES. *In the marines* _everyone_ qualifies with rifle - even truck
drivers. (This is less true with army troops) Not as a sniper perhaps, but
certainly Rifle-1.

  Nope, but every *pilot* can.

   Sure, but the fact remains this is NOT a choice with CT. Sure, you can
use Book 4 for Marine characters and Book 5 for Navy characters, but where
does that leave the scientists and bureaucrat types? or spies? or
entertainers?

   TNE remains the best character generation system - why should I tinker
with CT when TNE already does everything I want better, easier? It even
has consistent education options, which only Books 4/5 characters do under
CT.

   Hopefully T4 will address these problems, and I believe that T4 will
probably be a lot closer to TNE than many CTers would like at first glance
but hopefully MM will be able to pull off acceptable compromises.

   At fractional cee velocities? The trajectory would be hyperbolic, not

  Battle Dres isn\'t standard issue. The closest thing to standard issue is

Everthing has a down side.  Just as an EMP disables a silicon based
computer, other radiations would no doubt destroy or inhibit organic
computers.  Organic doesn\'t necessarily mean alive though, just carbon
based.

Good for you Joe.  I\'m sure someone\'s going to flame you for buying it

   I can\'t see how anyone could think of TNE as excessively dark. One of
the Big Things about TNE is the way players actually feel a part of the
rebuilding in a tangible way. You don\'t work for a huge impersonal
Imperium, you have a good chance of meeting senior personnel in the RC
hierarchy and the AO is still small enough for one group of characters to
become well known heroes.

  Done right, with enough background work by the ref, and players can get
a real charge after a "job well done". A difficult "Hot Recovery"
(personnel especially), a poli-sci job, whatever...

  (deliberate misunderstanding) So the text in the message - data, not
code, caused your machine to become infected by a Virus?

  I could _almost_ buy a standard computer argument from the Imperium
standpoint (the "standard" trasnponder is a believable argument), what I
don\'t buy is:

1) *all* races - no matter what mental predjudices, tech level, social
viewpoint, engineering know-how, etc, were threatened by Virus. (Hivers
dodged the bullet, but only because they used active measures to defeat
Virus)

2) *all* computers, of *all* tech levels have architectural similarities
such that Virus can infect.

3) Fire control sensors (routinely used as vectors in Virus adventures)
which plainly have no use in computer communication, are able to receive
virus infections.

You would ignore it for purpose of stellar classification, the only way

	Not quite, the letter and the arabic number refer to the
spectral classification.  Which corresponds to how hot the star is. 
The hottest stars are the O, then B,A,F,G,K,M.  (Originally the stars
were classified by strength of spectral lines,and were later
reorganized, when people figured out why the lines varied) We only have
7 letters listed, and all O stars are not going to be exactly the same,
so we add a number to further specify the type.  
	The Roman Numeral gives the Luminosity class, which tells you
the rough age of the star.  
V=Main Sequence (When the star is burning Hydrogen at its core)
IV=Subgiant
III=Giant
II=Bright Giants
I=Supergiants.

I have no idea why the earliest stars are V, while latter stages are I. 
Hope this helps.

Another thing.
Characters that survive the generation and have gone through the

Don\'t look now, but we might just have gained a convert!  ;)

Just kidding, Joe.  I hope you find lots of useful stuff in TNE.  I\'m sure
you will.  DS (I think) is right about FF&S, though.  The first two to three
time through are killer, but after you get through it a few times, it takes
little more than a half hour for a slop ship, and about an hour for a normal
one.  Hope you enjoy your new stuff.

 Y\'know, I never really thought about it, but now that you mention
 it, I think that my knowledge of history, as gleaned from my SCA
 activities, _does_ provide a minor influence on my Imperium.
 Later European history provides my Imperial government; my
 Imperium is a "strong fealty" Imperium, much like the later
 English/British and French models (before the English king was
 reined in by Parliament). Vargr tend to have a middle-eastern
 Bedouin feel about them, Aslan are Feudal Japanese more than
 anything else, and Zhodani are Roman Republic, with a touch of
 Inquisition (although one of my players thinks of them as a
 socialist (nominally Communist) oligarchy).

Thanks for the support.  As far as people flaming because I\'m 
investigating TNE, I hope not.  Even if I have no plans of using the 
system (which I don\'t...after all, T4 is coming out in less than 2 
months!), it\'s a good idea to buy it for several reasons.  1)  FF&S, in 
modified form, will be used in T4, so learning that now will give me a 
head start, 2) Lots of people here play and/or are familiar with TNE, so 
if I want to talk to them I\'d better know about it, too (common frame of 
reference), and 3) even if I hate TNE after reading it, I\'ll at least 
have the advantage of "knowing mine enemy." :)

No kidding!  I had no idea.  (Sorry, off topic, but that surprised me.)

"Reasonable" ?!!!
Recently the high court of Iran ruled that anyone who did not believe
that the world was flat was an athiest.  And athiests are commended to
death in Iran.  

By the way, just to be fair.  Chistianity also went through this 
same "reasonable" set of laws once upon a time.

Excessively dark?  True, it\'s not in the league with the White Wolf games 
and such, but it does fall into the Gamma World type 
category...rebuilding after a major distaster.  The rebuilding part is 
good, the disaster isn\'t.

Good points.  I\'ll try to set my pre-judged opinions aside until I\'ve 
actually read the manuals.

I\'m not sure I get your point here.  Are you saying that you don\'t 
beleive that Virus presented a threat to all the races or something else? 
 The Hiver\'s antivirus countermeasure was a hastily developed "tame" 
virus.  The Hiver\'s still took a beatin\' from the Virus.

Virus can infect all computers, that\'s what it was designed to do.  Virus 
cannot control all computers.  SOme computers just aren\'t "large" enough 
for it to become a problem.  ie virus could inhabit a portable medical 
computer, it couldn\'t do anything with it because the computer isn\'t big 
enough for it to grow properly.

In this case the Virus would be received in one of two ways.

1)  Sensor\'s as they are designed to send and receive information 
although it is technically pulses in active sensors  could be used as a 
conduit.  Passive sensors would be much more susseptable than active 
ones.

2)  Missle communication sensors.  Knowing where a ship is if you had the 
same communication system you could in theory, talk to the ship.  ie two 
missle gunboats if they wanted to their MFD opperators could chat back 
and forth through the laser communication system that the missles use.

There would be areas where SDB\'s would make a system pretty immune
from pirate attack. They would escort merchants out to jump points,
patrol areas around gas giants, etc.  Merchant ships that stick to
systems like that wouldn\'t need armor or arms.  In fact, armed ships
would be looked on as *potential* raiders by the local system police.

Other parts of space would be much less safe.  Fringe areas, low
pop/tech worlds wouldn\'t have System Police with SDB\'s to insure safe
passage of merchants.  This is where merchant ships would be armed and
armored.  However, I don\'t think they would have much armor or be well
armed...too costly, eats up too much cargo space.  Traders will almost
always prefer running to fighting.

OTOH, I haven\'t checked Bruce\'s designs to see if they reflect the
MDrive bug-fix yet.

Sure, that\'s exactly what they were up to.  I\'d have much preferred an
extended civil war and general economic collapse.  I thought that\'s
where MT was going.  We did have the "Long Night" as a model after
all.

The Virus gave them:

>1. A destroyed empire.

It did that!  Unfortunately, I think it went too far.

...and it left a bad taste in my mouth.  <g> You know, there were a
lot of things about the TNE rules I liked..and lots I didn\'t like, but
I never bought into the Virus.  Mankind is plenty malicious enough to
have done it all by himself.

The problem was after the Basic Set and FFS, I stopped buying
*anything* concerning TNE. It just didn\'t fit the way I wanted to do
things.  I didn\'t like "Smash and Grab", or the RCES, or even the
Regency.

What I\'d have liked to have seen were several small multi-system
states competing for the opportunity to rebuild the Imperium to its
former glory.  I think that\'s where things would have ended up, sans
Virus.  I *think* Milieu 0 is going to put us there, and give me the
environment what I want to play in. <g>
