careful about possible spoilers re. Gateway! :-)  Let\'s just hope I can
get to my players first.  Any chance of a source list for some of these,
especially the Human minor races.

Err, no, that\'s a watercraft MHD drive.  Let me back off a bit and
explain from the theoretical side first...

MHD is merely the study of interactions between conductive fluids
(gases, plasma also) and electrical and magnetic fields.
The primary rule of MHD is that when a conductive fluid has
an electrical field passing through it in one direction,
and a magentic field perpendicular to that, it is accellerated
perpindicularly to _both_ of those fields... or, if a moving
conductive fluid is subjected to a magnetic or electrical
field it will establish the other field perpendicularly to
the existing one... 8-)

That\'s the basic stuff.  It gets more complex (I know physics
grad students who work in the field exclusively) and more painful
to work with (the typical reaction to someone describing
advanced MHD effects in a physics conference is that everyone
"smiles and nods" without understanding it at all ;-).

A MHD engine is one that takes a working fluid (gas, plasma...)
and subjects it to an accellerating field of perpendicular electric
and magnetic fields.  For a water vehicle, you use seawater (which
is highly conductive).  For space vehicles, you have to bring along
fuel of some sort and ionize it (the usual process is to have a
low powerion engine, say using xenon, feeding the MHD engine...)
and then runs it through the paired fields to accellerate it further.

An MHD _turbine_ does the opposite; instead of taking electrical
power and accellerating something, it takes something that\'s moving
and generates electrical power.  For example, the exhaust of a jet
engine is a hot, partially ionized, fast moving gas.  To generate
electricity from it, you can run the exhaust through a magnetic
field and put electrodes at the sides perpendicular to the magnetic
field... you get a current.

MHD turbines are exceptionally effecient ways of generating power,
but have the problem that they erode electrodes very quickly.
Work today is slowly proceeding on making them more effecient that
way, but it\'s slow going.  But you can make them today, if you\'re
willing to swap electrodes every few hours ;-)

and I haven\'t seen/done the equations on power generation from something
like this.  My gut reaction was that if you\'re taking something like an 
ion engine accelerating (say) xenon and then stripping electricity off
with a magnetic field (ie, an MHD turbine) then you had electricity to
begin with (to power your linac in the ion engine) and you probably
wouldn\'t pull out more than you put in to begin with...However, from what
George says this may not be an accurate picture on my part...Anyway,

The Ape class fighter, while small in stature more than makes up for its
diminutive size with its blazing fusion gun, uncanny agility, and thick hide.
Much of it\'s 20% size reduction is due to the 1/4 ton capacitor that it leeches
engergy off of in combat situations.  The Ape is able to remain in combat for a
full two hours before its capacitor "runs dry," thereafter, the Ape may enter
combat every 4th turn or return to it\'s mother-ship for recharging.  Many
commanders are willing to endure this short duration in exchange for the 25%
increase in guns (and the comparative strength of the fusion gun) that can be
brought against the enemy compared to conventional 10 ton fighters.

Design notes:  As it stands, the only rules that were bent were the 1-ton
minimums on the fuel requirement.  This gives an effective long-term duration
of just over 13 days.  An additional 2 hours (maybe 2.5, it depends on how you
do your rounding...) for a mere 1MCR in capacitors and sacrificing 7 days of
long-term duration.

The TL 14 variety is the exact same configuration, except that the armor factor
drops to 14 with .08 tons added to fuel/whatever; and power-plant rating drops
to 7, with a proportionate increase in long-term duration.

The TL 13 variety is the same as the TL 15 variety except that both the armor
factor and the power-plant rating are reduced to 7, and the fusion-gun rating
is reduced to 4.

At TL 13-14, extra capacitors really begin to pay off...  (assuming that the
craft can survive that long in combat)

Below TL 13, this class of ship just isn\'t possible...

Oh yeah, the capacitor rules are on page 42 of my edition of High Guard   (c)
1980 under the heading "The Black Globe".  I think this is a logical extension
of those rules.

>Okay, somebody more in the know than I needs to explain this to me:

well, none of your options are correct.  This is MHD in a nutshell....

You have a turbine which burns fuel (any kind of fuel will work, some better
than others). The (very, very) hot exhaust is sent thru a straight pipe with
a coil wrapped around the outside.  Since the exhaust is also electrically
charged (a weak plasma) the moving charges in the pipe induce a current in the
coil.  This is what produces the power.  Since the exhaust is only slowed
down slightly from the power generation, it still produces thrust.

If you gear the turbine for power, you lose most, if not all, of the thrust.
If you go for straight thrust, you get very little power.  MHD trades off some
of the thrust for power.  Since you aren\'t mechanically coupling the exhaust
(via a power turbine), you get little mechanical losses, thus pretty good
efficiency.

caveat:  I am not a power engineer, but I am sure I have the general concepts
    correct.

Thanks to everyone for the interest in the list, and for the help with
some of the ones I missed.  (The annoying thing is, I should have caught
\'em too, but I did most of this list before MTJ #3 and before I got some
old TD back issues...oh well.)

Since the list is culled from Traveller material I have access to, there
are some holes in the list.  For instance, I think there was a race in
_Safari Ship_, but they aren\'t on the list \'cuz I don\'t have a copy to
check on the details.  The same goes for back issues of the old magazines;
I don\'t have a lot of the old TDs, JTAS/Challenges, or any of the others.

(Speaking of which, what\'s the difference between the "old dolphins" from
 JTAS and the "new dolphins" from TD #13 (Terra)?  Ever since I heard
 they\'d been redone, I\'ve been curious, and I\'ve never seen a copy of
 TD #13.)

Some people have asked if I\'m thinking about reworking the list to put
references in.  I\'ve thought about it, but it would be a pain to do.
I might put in source references anyway, but only if I happen to get
some spare time (not terribly likely in the immediate future).  I\'ll
probably update the list to reflect corrections, though.  If anyone
else wants to take a swing at it, be my guest!

MHD = Magneto-Hydrodynamics, which applies to anything "fluid-like", like
a laminar flow of gas, which is ionized.

Turbine:  "any of various machines having a rotor, usually with vanes or
blades, driven by the pressure, momentum, or reactive thrust of a moving
fluid, as steam, water, hot gases, or air, either occuring in the form
of free jets or as a fluid passing through and entirely filling a
housing around the rotor." (whew!)

So, we have a reaction chamber, the exhaust of which is being pushed
through:  A) a turbine and B) an MHD "tube".

The turbine, if optimized for thrust, would basically not even be
present, since a straight "rocket" of our reactant would presumabely
provide more thrust than that same rocket passed through a rotor.

However, if the turbine is optimized for power generation, very little
thrust would result.  So, the turbine is there, leaching some thrust
from our reaction but providing power, but not leaching so much power
that we don\'t have any thrust.  We can also pass the exhaust
through our MHD and peel off power, as George explained.

Clearly, our initial "power" with this sort of reaction is based on an
ionized, rapidly moving, exhaust, either from some chemical reaction or
from a continuous pulse fusion reactor.  If we were to postulate a linac
as our "injection" device, we would clearly need a source of electricity
to power it, and it seems obvious to me that we wouldn\'t be able to pull
any more power from our ion beam than was put into it by the linac.

So, my question comes down to:  does anybody have any good figures on
whether having both the turbine stage *and* the MHD stage is efficient
in terms of power/thrust and so forth?  Wouldn\'t just the MHD be better?

    'body' => 'Hello fellow Travellers,

I have mastered two TNE sessions on a Con here in germany this weekend,
and I had some troubles. I would like to get some assistance for those
problems:

1. I collected a group of 5 players, 2 of them familiar with the old
   Traveller rules, three of them unfamiliar with the rules. It took
   4 (four!) hours to create the charaters. Any ideas how I can do this
   faster (I mean other then giving out perfabricated character...that\'s
   the solution I will use on the next Con if no better idea arises)

2. One of the 5 players choose the profession of a belter and got his
   Strike in the second term. According to the rules he got a Seeker
   and 2D6 times 100 KCr of money. Okay, No big problem though I\'m not
   sure, where in the RC you can find a TL 15 Shipyard to build the ship.
   But the other players accumulated 22 Ship DMs. They decided to get
   a ship for them. And rolling 11 on the Trader column and then 12
   on the ship table they got a Far Trader with a very good wear value.
   Now the group has two ships...and of corse they choose to sell one
   of them. As a result they got 30 MCr for the seeker, which they choose
   to sell. Too much money for a starting group. Once again: Any ideas
   how I can stop the players to get so much money?

3. Any ideas about the availability of High Tech Weapons in the RC?
   Exspecially Combat Armor and Battledresses together with Plasma
   and Fusion Guns are the weapon of choice for some of the players.
   Because these weapons were of no use to the adventure I gave the
   weapons to them for a price of 500% of the listed, just to get some
   of the money back.

I had no such problems using the old charater rules because it was
much more difficult to get a ship then. With the TNE rules there is a
large probability to get a ship especially if you have at least one
Navy and one Scientist character. Together these two characters can
easy collect a +30 Ship DM.

I hope to get some comments,

Juergen

P.S.: There is another bug in "The once and Future Empire". I don\'t know
      if those guys at GDW can read starcards (excuse me Loren...but it was
      to frustrating), but the the world Karguusha (spelling ?) mentioned
      in the adventure is more than 25 jumps (using a Jump-2 Far Trader!)
      away from the RC and Aubaine, where the briefing is. That\'s more than
      one year of Travel according to the rules. But time is important in
      this adventure, so I had to move the world.
P.P.S.: I suppose someone has turned the chart of Diaspora upside down,
        when the world was selected.
P.P.P.S.: Any idea why I got seven Digest V58#4?

His feild is high-energy physics (super-colliders and such) and today he

knows a thing or two about the subject.

  His argument was that the actual details of creating the kind of
magnetic field needed for Gauss rifles and pistols, feild strength over
the short distance of the barrel length, and most importantly for the 
very narrow barrel diameter.  He said this would this would induce 
radiation that would make firing the gun more hazardous to the user than
the target.  Or, in his words;

"The surest way to kill someone with a Gauss rifle is to let him use one."

Needless to say, we listened to his complaints but used the Gauss guns

    I\'ve had the MT rules for six years now and have never really understood
the position of the MT sectors in the known Milky Way galaxy. May seem stupid,
but I have no idea. I mean, is Core supposed to be located at the core of the
galaxy? Or is that just the Imperial Core. And if the Zhodani have been mounting
Core Expeditions every once in a while, Is that to the Core system, or to the
Galactic Core (I always assumed it was the Galactic Core).

    If these expeditions were to the Imperial Core, no wonder the psionophobic
Imperials get so concerned! :-)

    Anyone got an opinion? (heh heh heh)

    Oh, BTW, the animal encounter table generator works. Cleaning up the code
so no one will say "Hey, this guy can\'t code worth ****". It\'s got a paging
mechanism built in so you can keep the tables in RAM and choose which one you
want by pressing the PAGE UP and DOWN keys. Gonna require some video card
though. Uses "pretty colors".

    Oh, and since I brought it up, No one ever told me what the wound entry on
the Weight Effects table in the encounter table generation rules means. I\'m 
generating a number and I have no Idea why. Nothing in the rule book on it.

I ALWAYS use prefab characters, even for my long running campain. I 
suggest that you always use prefab charcters for one off adventures.  
(Unless the point of the session is to teach character generation.)  I do 
not even roll dice half the time but just make up the numbers and skills I 
want.  I will write up several characters so that the players have a 
selection to pick from.  I do leave a few things unfinshed so that the 
players can put the final finish on their character.

If the PCs have fusion guns so do the bad guys.  In my game "those who live

Well, I just lent out my copies of the _Ref\'s Manual_ and _Encyclopedia_,
so I can\'t give you the "Official" answer, Anthony.  However, take a
look at the following two facts:

The page on 71 of the _Players\' Manual_ has a diagram indicating, roughly,
what is meant by Coreward, Rimward, etc.  Since the diagrams in Cats &
Rats and Dogs & Cogs always indicated the direction of the Vargr Extents
as Coreward (as does the Ref Manual), I think I\'m safe in saying that
the Core sector is just the Imperial Core, and that the Zhodani are
heading towards the Galactic Core, which is "Up" off the large scale
sector maps we\'ve seen.

If we think about it in terms of astronomy, the picture is even clearer:
The Earth (Terra/Solomani Rim) sits, very roughly, about 2/3 of the way
from the galactic core to the rim in real life.  The galactic core is
about 10,000 parsecs from the Earth.  Traveller Sectors are 40x32
parsecs and Coreward is along the long axis of a sector, so we can say that
there\'s about 250 sectors in between the Solomani Rim and the Galactic
Core.

For a con, I recommend prefabs, both to save time and to insure the
characters have a mix of skills appropriate to the scenario you are running.

For any other use, try making up your own checklist of the generation
process, with all notes or page references in one place. I know the book
has a worksheet, but by putting together your own you will help yourself
learn the mechanics of the procedure better. After that it\'s simply a 
matter of experience. Once I\'m "up and running" with a system, I can crank
out characters in fairly short order. Newbies, however, will slow things
down by any method, with any system, so plan for that.

Again, for cons, prefabs eliminate this problem, as _you_ have already
determined their resources.

In other situations, I got around this problem by choosing the campaign
setting myself (with player input as to what sort of things they wanted
to p[lay).  For instance, I might give them a trading ship, stock the 
ship\'s locker, set basic ship\'s funds, and then let the players crew it.
I\'d also give them d6 years in the Free Traders in the enhanced generation
system, under the assumption that they didn\'t all just muster out of their
previous service, but have been running the ship for a while, with the
campaign starting when their lives got more interesting than usual.
Monetary muster out benefits were limited to 1, 2, or 3 rolls, depending
on several factors. Total rolls were reduced by 1/3 to 1/2, since I 
already gave them quite a bit of equipement, and the remainder rolled
n the material benefits table. Things they wouldn\'t be allowed to keep,
like another ship, gave them a related skill level instead.

So far no player has complained about what they "were supposed to get
according to the rules" since they knew up front that if I was GMing, I
wanted to be able to plan ahead of character generation and the random 
assortment of resources it gave.
Then again, my group never really went for the "galactic vagrants" kind
of campaign where they\'d bum their way from starport to starport doing
odd jobs.  They tended to prefer those as sidelights to some major
continuing storyline.

NEVER NEVER NEVER let the players simply sell a ship they get during
character generation.  Or at least make it years before they see a credit
of the money, thanks to assorted red tape and legal delays :-)

The RC has NO TL15 shipyards. Just use the TL15 stats for the scout until
the Architecture book lets you design apropriate TL ships.

Availability? Probably pretty poor, since most of the working ones likely
belong to the government. Auction at 10X or more of list price is not out
of the question, though.

Characters need a ship in TNE because the bumming from \'port to \'port 
routine just doesn\'t work too well outside the Regency. Consider my
suggestion of setting up the basic situation yourself, and then allowing
the players peronalise the smaller details.

Following up on this subject, the old Library Data entries do recognize
that a confusion may exist between "coreward" as most of the Traveller
galaxy recognizes it (toward the galactic core) and "coreward" as
the former Imperium recognized it (toward Capital and the Core Worlds).

The Zhodani *certainly* use "coreward" in the first sense, especially
since they really don\'t care which way Capital is as long as it doesn\'t
pose a threat to them.  Besides which, somewhere in the MT Ref\'s 
Manual there is a figure on how far the Zhodani expeditions have
penetrated, and it converts to something like two hundred sector
lengths toward the Galactic Core (!!), and Capital was *much* closer
to Zhdant than that.  And any Zhodani expeditionary fleet headed
for capital wouldn\'t be the Core Expedition anyway...it\'d be more
like the Sixth Frontier War! :)

I hope you don\'t mind me sending this here, as I\'m not a member of the list.
You could say I was an "off-line" reader, as I only read the archived bundles
because of intermittent computer contact.

If I mention anything thats been covered recently please excuse me, I\'m not up
to date yet.

Has anyone noticed the suspiciously fast wound recovery rates in T:TNE?
I may be reading it wrongly (if I am, shout at me and I\'ll be suitably
embarassed :-)), but it looks like a char. can be practically dead and then
a week later be up and running about again.
The rules seem to say that recovery from a single critical wound takes only
5 days without medical assistance. You can just hear it :-

A : "Hi, B, how are you?"
B : "Well, A, I was shot in the leg with a fusion gun and damn near bled to
      death."
A : "Oh, I suppose you\'ll be laid up for a bit then."
B : "Nah, that was last week. Fancy a game of grav ball?"

I know that the short recovery times are good in a game sense (who wants to
roleplay 6 months of going to phsio. sessions?), but there should be some
way of making a seriously wounded characters pay for it a bit longer, perhaps
in the form of reduced strength or agility (dexterity, whatever). If anybody 
has any ideas for curing (pun intended!) this then I\'d be interested to know.

On T:TNE itself, I don\'t mind the rules revision (replacement, call it what
you will) but the whole background to it worries me. I didn\'t see the need
for the virus in the first place, it was just a plot device to get somewhere
which could have just as easily been reached some other way with less of a 
mess. Has anybody worked out roughly how many sophonts were killed by the 
whole virus thing? It must be in the trillions at least. Anyway, if the
Technical Architecture(?) book comes out soon and is in reasonable shape
then that will keep me happy.

What are people\'s favourite Trav. quotes/extracts? I\'m writing a DOS program 
which will give me a random Trav. quote whenever I ask for one. I\'ll need a 
good few to keep it seeming fresh (especially if I decide to connect it to 
the autoexec.bat so it gives me one every time I boot up). Anything up to about 10 lines long should be OK, whether from the rules,adventures, the PBEM game or whatever. If I get a good selection then I\'ll upload it the archives when its
finished for others to use (assuming it ever works, that is).

Finally, a cry for help. My computer access will be being removed permanently
at the end of September. Is there any kind soul in the UK who is prepared to
load the TML messages/bundles onto floppy and send them to me? All expenses
paid (disk, postage etc.), and if you\'re intimidating enough a (small(!)) 
payment for the time it takes? If somebody could then I\'ll be forever grateful.

Thanks for listening. If anyone is going to reply to me personally (even if
it\'s to shout at me for posting to the list when I\'m not a member!) then don\'t
be surprised if an answer takes a few weeks. I HATE projects!!

Hi TMLers,

Seven copies of the TML Nightly V58#4 were mailed out in a
sixteen-minute frenzy just after 2030 hours on Friday, July 9. I don\'t
know why. It appears that the duplication was brought on by the
nova.engrg.uwo.ca->Internet mail transfer system, as all messages share
identical Message-Id and Date headers, and the only changes are in the
Recieved lines. Dan, does this behavior correlate with any known problem
at UWO\'s internet gateway at that time?

Also, my apologies for very slow response time lately. I\'ve had a number
of family issues to face in the last two months and my time at work has
been suffering. Please be patient and I\'ll work hard to answer all the
outstanding Traveller administrative email requests from the list within
the next week.

I am pleased to see the long list of folks on TML interested in 2300.

I\'d like to start off some discussion if I may.  I\'m beginning a campaign and
in thinking about where I\'d like to take it I have run into some problems with
using the Kafer War, particularly as described in Invasion sourcebook.  One
of the things that I enjoyed most about 2300AD was the background of colonial
tensions and conflicts that made it such a rich place for adventure and intri-
gue.  But if the Kafers are going to come through in a few years and trash
the whole place anyway, what\'s the point? 
	Even if one is only using the Kafers on Aurore, long term campaigns
with them as the prniciple enemy seem difficult because of their stupidity
and of the difficulty of communicating with them.  How can you keep the players
interest when their only way of interacting with their opponent is militarily?
I know that there are military based campaigns out there, but even these 
would quickly degenerate into wargaming if not for some intrigue.
	The solution I have settled on is to use the Kafer War only as a 
backdrop for intrigue among the human colonists.  The French seek to use the
war and the resulting weakened state of the other two colonies to extend
their influence on Aurore; Tanstaafl has internal splits between the corrupt
civilian gov\'t and the Legion, and the Ukranians are looking for an angel fo
mercy to save them.
	Of course this solution requires disregarding all of Invasion and 
relegating the Kafer, one of the best developed aspects of the game, to a 
backdrop.  Does anyone have any better ideas?

Somewhere in the Traveller library data - and I think it was transferred
to MT - there is an explanation of `Galactic Directions\', namely Spinward
in the direction of galactic spin, Trailing in the opposite direction,
Rimward towards the *galactic* rim, and Corewards towards the *galactic*
core.  As a caveat, it was also noted that the Imperial Core (ie Core
sector, the location of Capital)  allowed some confusion in the use of the
term `Coreward\', as for a large chunk of the Imperium, the two directions
were actually different.

As to where charted space is in the Milky Way, well Terra is typically
taken to be about 10000 pc from the galactic core, although this distance
is difficult to measure too precisely.  Thus, the Zhodani Core Expeditions
are to the galactic core, and they haven\'t got there yet (unless you take
the extreme limit of current measurements errors, and even then I\'m not
sure).  I think these distances for the core may be included in the
Traveller literature under the explanation of Imperial coordinate systems,
and the location of Reference.

  Yup, I\'d rather see long recivery times that could be shortened by technology
(our old friend the medical slow drug for example:)

  As I read it, crit to serious takes seven days, serious to slight 4 days
and slight to unwounded three for a total of 14 days (IMHO I\'d like at least
two months here, plus the possibility of permanent damage unless treated).

> Has anybody worked out roughly how many sophonts were killed by the 
> whole virus thing?

  Checking the results my program gave (subtracting the 1200 population from
the 1117 population and adding the population increases that are included in
the 1200 population, since I\'m not that morbid that I included a \'total
killed\' notation in the report file:) gives these values for a few sectors:

Sector		Reduction	Density (as per TD10)
Gushemege	82%		0.92
Corridor	91%		1.06
Dagudashaag	96%		1.24
Vland		99%		1.85

  I would expect them to be accurate only to within 5 or 10 percent, but it
is pretty clear that densly populated areas are more vulnerable, even if
they are mostly safe areas that have been spared from black war (like Vland).

  The average population density of the Imperium is 1.76, but since I don\'t
think the reductions can get over 99% even in Solomani Rim with a density of
5.2, I\'d guess that the overall reduction is 95%.

  On a total population of 15.76e12, that means 14.97e12 dead, or around
three thousand times the earths current population. 

  I remember that Wildstar asked Dave Nilsen why so few people died during the
Hard Times (<2% in Diaspora). Looks like the Virus makes up for it, with 
interest.

     As an average adventuring Imperial citizen, I\'ve always imagined 
the Imperial Core as the cultural and bureaucratic center of the 
Imperium.  Notwithstanding war zones, it is more "civilized" with 
higher tech, pop, and law levels than the "frontier" areas such as 
the Spinward Marches and other zones adjacent to alien sectors.  

     It is more a mental image than one born of demographic data.  
This reflects the historical mindsets of the Imperial culture, since 
the Spinward Marches technically have been populated by Imperials for 
around a thousand years, with little expansionist settlement recently 
(apart from District 268).

     Now aliens would have a different perspective on the Imperium.  
Generally speaking, the Aslan treat the Imperium as a frontier ripe 
for settlement.  The Zhodani see the Imperium as nothing more than a 
military threat from backwards thinking people.  Human and yet 
uninterested in Imperial culture, the Zhodani are exploring in 
directions other than the Imperium.  I would guess that the space 
toward the Galactic Core is unpopulated and ripe for exploration.  
I\'ve always heard "Zhodani" used with "core expeditions" to delineate 
their perspective, toward the Galactic center, since they are not
interested in Imperial culture.

     And if you don\'t like this explanation, then do away with one of 
the Cores, say the Imperial Core, and make another game! 8-O

A couple:

1. Change the timeline so the players don\'t know when/if major Kafer
   invasion is coming.

2. Play after the Kafer invasion and have the Kafer race beaten but still
   acting as pirates etc...

3. Move into the Manchurian arm away from the Kafers.

4. How about introducing a VIRUS that raises the Kafer NICEness quotiant to
   something resembling a french citizen and then simply play on about 70
   years into the future 8^}.

 We need a little information before we can answer this man\'s question,
 First,  Is he a member of the Traveller Aid Society?
 Second, Does he desire high,middle or low passage?
 Third,  would he consider working passage?

I\'m planning a Traveller campaign (set in the pre-5th Frontier War Spinward
Marches) and I\'m planning to use the Ine Givar terrorists as one of the
plot threads (they\'re trying to sabotage some planetary defenses and naval
bases just before war breaks out).  But I don\'t know very much about the
Ine Givar (other than what showed up in 5FW, where they were basically
Zhodani-controlled guerilla armies).  I can\'t seem to find very much in
other sources.
 
Hence some questions I was wondering if you might help me with...
 
1) Are the Ine Givar a single organization, or an umbrella organization
linking groups on different worlds, or just the Imperial label for any
anti-Imperial terrorism that pops up?
 
2) Given that guerilla groups can\'t be effective without backing of some
sort, who supports them: the Zhodani or the Sword Worlds (I\'ve seen some
suggestions of the latter).  The answer to this will probably influence
question 3.
 
3) What, exactly, do the Ine Givar want out of life?  The Imperium to just
go away?  Union with the Zhodani?  Changes in Imperial policies?  Norris\'
head on a pike?  The published information I\'ve seen is singularly vague
about Ine Givar motivations (other than to say that they\'re \'anti-Imperial\',
whatever that means).
 
4) Roughly how active are they?  (I suppose this would vary from world
to world, depending on Ine Givar strength locally, their targets, and so
forth).  This is probably a campaign-dependent decision, but I\'d like to
know what levels of activity could be justified.
 
Thanks.

Hi all!

Well this week someone on the mainland gave a good yank on the rope that
keeps PEI from floating away....and while we were nice and close to the
shoreline, Traveller:TNE arrived! 

(Welcome to reality in the Canadian Maritimes!)

I noticed several weeks ago, that people were sharing some rather large
collections of errata.  Have they been archived on their own, at some
easily accessible site? 

If not, could those folks who diligently compiled the errors and their
corrections, forward them to me? 

Much appreciated.

I have only a couple of comments so far, as I haven\'t read too far into
the book yet. 

1. I thought the soft cover was okay, but the paper inside doesn\'t appear
   to be very resilient.  Already, just flipping between character tables
   has resulted in some wrinkles.

2. The artwork seems to be much better.

3. I enjoyed the History section, because I have often struggled to try and
   put all of the Traveller material into some kind of perspective.

   Now, if they could reliably put all the various products on a timeline!

4. I can\'t put my finger on it, but the Character Generation seems a little
   more friendly.  However, I would have liked to get a summary of the steps
   required to generate a full character, along thelines of the summary
   in MegaTraveller.  There will be more wrinkled pages before I get the
   hang of *all* the details.


So these are all pretty superficial comments.  I have never had a complete
grasp on Traveller, and compared to many TMLers, it will likely be years
before I do.  But the layout of the book (and so far the content) has me
more confident that I might be able to get a game going among some friends.

Any comments/suggestions are welcome!

	First I\'d like to thank Stewart Eyres and Keith Thoms for their replies

	My original question was not really as to whether the Zhodani Core
expeditions were on their way to the Imperial Core system - although upon 
reading my own post on that, I must admit that\'s what it sounded like....
Sorry!


	Way I understand it, the Imperial Core System is the Core (politically and
otherwise) of the Imperium. That\'s cool. The Zhodani make expeditions to the
Galactic Core. True, got that too. What I\'ve been trying to figure out (and
bye the way, Stewart and Keith, your posts gave me my answer after all!) was
if the map on the inside cover of the Referee\'s Manual where it shows the 
whole Imperium sector by sector is supposed to be the Galaxy as we know it...

	With, I might add, the Core system superimposed upon the Core of the
Galaxy...

	From your posts, I have gathered that that map is supposed to be part of
one galactic arm. This is cool also and makes more sense (And was what I was
supposing, but was a little unsure of).

	So, I\'d like to say thanks to all who responded - I got the picture now.


	Also, the Animal Encounter Table Generator is finished and I\'m awaiting
some response from Loren Wiseman as to whether I can legally distribute it
as freeware, without offending the company.

You could take info about modern day terrorists such as the PLO, IRA,
and Operation Rescue and go from there.  The magazine
_Soldier_of_Fortune_ is an interesting source for para-military stuff.


Rather than answering your questions, I\'ll pose some additional
questions for your fun and games with the players\'s minds.

> 1) Are the Ine Givar a single organization, or an umbrella organization
> linking groups on different worlds, or just the Imperial label for any
> anti-Imperial terrorism that pops up?

	Is the Ine Givar really responsable for every act of terrorism
	that is attributed to them?

	Are some \'hits\' by Imperial intelligence blamed upon \'those
	evil terrorists\'?

	Is there fractionalism inside of the Ine Givar?  

	Who controls the Ine Givar?  Who thinks that they do?  Who
	does the rest of the universe think runs the Ine Givar?

> 2) Given that guerilla groups can\'t be effective without backing of some
> sort, who supports them: the Zhodani or the Sword Worlds (I\'ve seen some

> question 3.

	The Sword Worlds backed by SORAG backed by the Zhodani, 
	backed by the Mad Scientists, backed by the Boy Sprouts, 
	backed by the Bavarian Illumaniti (sp) aided by transferable
	power from the Men in Black?

	How about the Imperial government?  Just because the Ine Givar
	cause problems for the Imps doesn\'t mean that they arn\'t an
	arm of IBIS.  Life could be really difficult for the group
	that came into possession of PROOF of the Imperial backing of
	the Ine Givar.

	Perhaps one of the royal heirs?  (Lucan?  He is really scum
	after all.)

	Remember that most of what you read conserning the Third
	Imperium comes from the Imperial printing office.

> 3) What, exactly, do the Ine Givar want out of life?  The Imperium to just

	That depends on who is really backing them.  Zhodani backers
	are trying to tie up resources that would otherwise be used
	against Zhodani space.

	Imperial backers are trying to raise anti-Zhodani feelings.

	Some Imperial backers are trying to destabilize the current
	Imperial government.  Others are using the Ine Givar to
	manipulate the stock market somewhere.

	This depends on how important the Ine Givar are to your
	overall game.  Think about what affect terrorism has on local
	officials. 

	Offworlders are viewed with distrust.  Weapon imports are
	carefully watched.  Metal detectors everywhere.  Security is
	beefed up.

	Look at it this way:  The players have been hired to steal
	some computer data from \'Really Lax Computers\'.  This should
	have been a simple in/out job in the middle of the night;
	however, the increased terrorism has caused RLC to increase
	the night security force and improve the building defenses.
	In addition there are more police patroling the streets.  All
	of this because 35 people were killed last week when a bomb
	exploded in a crowded shopping mall.

There have been a couple of postings asking for info on Traveller- The
New Era, so here is my two work units worth....

I would throw this into the Traveller mailing list, but my subscription
to that still hasn\'t been processed yet (are you reading this???)

I have just purchased the game (Softback book, 300+ pages, GDW code
number 0300) and what I guess is the first supplement, Survival Margin
(Softback book, 100+ pages, GDW code 0301). First the game:

My first impressions were Oh My God, what have they done? I was rather
taken aback by the *Major* change to the campaign world...

The rules have not been changed greatly from MegaTraveller (still a task
based system), but enough changes have been made to basically need some
work to get the two compatible (should you want to).  The old \'flavour\'
of Traveller is there, just in a different form.  I haven\'t had time to
playtest the rules yet, so I can\'t comment in detail, but of what I have
looked at, they seem ok.  The character generation is distinctly
different - gone are the highly complex (and IMHO fun) High Guard and
Mercenary advanced character generation, but we do have a system by
which players can pick and choose small portions of different careers to
get a rounded character - this does however leave the system open to
munchkinism, as a character could switch between lots of high skill
careers and collect lots of initial skill packets.

Starship rules are conspicuous in their almost absence - the rules
presented give a tantalising glimpse at some interesting changes (the
organization of lasers into power ratings, and the introduction of large
turrets - barbettes), but all the stuff on screens, construction, energy
guns, and in fact just about everything is missing. This is just so that
they can sell us another box set of course....

Psionics have been improved, and are now a legitimate career in places.
The system for Psionics has been made more flexible with the
introduction of success levels.

Other material is what could be expected - the aliens are covered in
about 5 pages (!), which means we will be purchasing separate alien race
sourcebooks (lets hope they get it right this time). The campaign
material is sound, with adequate equipment lists, a few sample subsector
maps and two sample adventures (which I wish they would leave out of
rule books, as once used, they become just so much dead weight in the
middle of the text).

Presentation is OK - there is a lot to read, so you get the feeling of
value - most diagrams are fine - I especially like the slightly neater
look of the subsector maps. However there are some flaws - for instance
the list of skill clusters (which is needed at generation) is at least
60 pages away from the rest of the character generation rules.

And onto the background - this is the most radical change to the
Traveller universe. The Shattered Imperium of MegaTraveller went through
a 14 year long war of despair, which basically ruined the infrastructure
of the Imperium. Then, in 1130, an ultimate weapon was released called
Virus - an intelligent machine virus which soon spread throughout the
Imperium. This caused all machinery controlled by computers to rebel
against humanity and effectively kill off a large portion of the
populace and throw the rest of them into the pre-industrial era.

The background to all this is well presented, and results in some
distinct campaign areas:

The Regency - This is the old Deneb/Spinward Marches area (Norris\'s area
in MegaTraveller). It is basically an area of the Imperium which has
survived through rigorous quarantine from Virus. The Regenecy has also
formed closer ties with Zhodani, Vargr and Aslan nearby. This area could
thus be used for a traditional Traveller campaign.

The Old Expanses - This is where the Hivers have started to educate
Humanity in an attempt to restart their technology. This allows a
flexible approach to what tech can be used

Pocket Empires - Small groups of worlds which have survived the Virus -
these can be a few worlds which can be placed anywhere.

The Wilds - The vast majority of the Imperium, which has been knocked
back to pre-stellar tech, and has virtually lost spaceflight. The rules
seem to indicate that this will be the main concentration for the
campaigns in the future, which is a great pity, as it is pointless
having a sci-fi roleplaying game set in the middle ages! This is very
disappointing by GDW - and I for one will not be bothering to buy any
Wilds campaign books.

The maps also show an area called the Black Curtain, which so far I
haven\'t found a reference to... This area is centred on Core, and I
guess we will all have to buy another book to find out about that...
Oho - just found a reference - this is Lucan\'s old empire, and
apparently, no ship ever going in has ever come out, and no ship ever
comes out of its own accord. Hands up those of you who reckon this will
turn out to be a small empire of high tech run by Lucan\'s descendants...

The second book, Survival Margin, is IMHO a waste of time and money. It
may provide a good sourcebook for anyone still using MegaTraveller who
wants more info on the war after the assisination of Strephon. It is
basically a timeline of that war until the Virus release. It also
includes a section on converting MegaTrav chars to TNE chars, including
such gems as "if the character has a large supply of Medical Slow drug,
then they could pass the seventy years from the war to the new era in
little more than one year subjective time" Yeah right...
The conversion is not a recommendation for buying this book - just start
with new characters.....

Overall, THE seems to have promise, but it also seems to have been
rushed out with no support. There is the promise of the ship combat
boxed set, and a Traveller Technical manual which allows the tech basis
of the universe to be altered. I would also guess that we will get the
ubiquitous ship compendiums, alien race books, and other crap that we
have all already bought for Traveller and MegaTrav.... *sigh*

I would recommend TNE to anyone who wants to progress in the Traveller
game - but have a stiff drink before reading the background to the
campaign. I think that with only a few small modifications, the campaign
is workable - I will probably set my campaign a few years into the new
era, when Virus has all but lost its contagiousness. The first steps
into rebuilding the Imperium can then be the focus of the game, perhaps
starting with the arrival of a Hiver ship at the Regency, having
discovered a few Pocket empires on the way, and the subsequent
re-expansion of the Regency into the wilds....

It\'s a very *small* part, too!  I\'ve got a scale diagram drawn up on my
computer showing the relation of "Charted Space" to the Galaxy as a whole.
"Charted Space" is the 500 by 500 parsec area containing civilization as
we know it.  (Like on that old original Traveller map with the pretty
starfield and showing all the governments but naming maybe five sectors. :) )

The chart is a little bit vague (for instance, I have no clue where to put
spiral arms) but is mainly meant to give some idea of the scale and distances
involved with the Traveller universe and some of the epic explorations
we\'ve heard a couple of tidbits about.

Since I drew the thing up on my good ol\' Mac, it\'s in PICT format right now,
but if I manage to convert the thing into GIF format, I\'d be willing to
make it available if there\'s interest.  Personally, it\'s the sort of thing
I always wanted to see in the rule books -- we really don\'t have a good idea 
where the furthest frontiers of exploration are in Traveller.

It\'s unusual in the sense that there is only a little bit of D&D
material. Hopefully there\'s something for everyone here somewhere.

My policy for this auction (my first) is a conglomeration of good ideas
from other well-run auctions on the net:
   
* Auction will run until Thursday, July 22nd
* A full list of magazines, boardgames/wargames, and rpg material is
posted to rec.games.frp.marketplace, while a smaller list of just
boardgames/wargames is posted to rec.games.board
* Bids should be sent to mark.e.johnson@lmsc.lockheed.com, not posted to
the net
* Rather than list minimum bids, I reserve the right to not sell anything
I feel isn\'t getting a fair price
* Bids should be in whole dollar amounts, and do not include shipping (paid
by buyer)
* After the sale is over, I will inform winners of their successful bids,
ask for shipping preferences, and then get an estimated shipping cost.
(No items will be shipped before payment is received, though I will ship
before the check clears).
* In the event of a tie at the end of bidding, I will have a last sudden
death bid session for games in question.
* Payment should be in U.S. funds and via check or money order.
* If you change your mind *PLEASE* let me know as soon as you do so that
I can withdraw your bid
* Rather than post a million updates, I just post one this Thursday
(7/15) and one the day before closing (7/21). I will *email* updates more
frequently to the bidders

	It seems to me that the spirit that was Traveller in the old days
	is dead.  No more Imperium, no more little black books, no more

	they put on the rules, but the rebellion was a little much for me
	to swallow.  With the publishing of the last set of rules I feel that
	an era has come to a close.  True Traveller is a thing of the past.

	I for one do not view this as a good thing.  I will try to keep it 
	alive by runing old style using the MT rules improvements, but as
	old players are replced by new ones my pool of "old style" players
	will dry up.  I will probably never get to *play* in an old traveller
	setting again (that hurts).  Eventualy I will have to retire my books
	to a dusty shelf for lack of player interest.

	I see the current rules as a complete loss.  Both the rules packages 
	and adventures are incompatable with the old Imperium.

	The Imperial Sunburst has finaly sputtered and gone out.

 Look at the second paragraph on page 273.  This is part of the "SA"
definition, and pertains specifically to the TL9 laser weapons.  This
will answer your question.  This section holds the answers to a great
many questions people have about the weapons tables.
 In this case, the TL9 Laser Rifle has two modes of fire, firing
several times per round with Damage 7 and nil Penetration, or firing
once per round with Damage 10 and 3-nil Penetration.

  One theory that I have heard is that the rules and the background were
incompatible in that they attracted different segments of the gaming community.

  The victorian background attracted the serious role players but the 
simplistic rules were more targetted toward beginners.
  
  One counterargument might be that games with very simplistic rules like
Vampire is doing well among those who fancies themselves to be serious
roleplayers today, so it might come down to a marketing mishap, or maybe
the view of simplistic systems have changed between then and now so it
was before its time.

  The only 1889 fan I know about is Ed \'Elminster\' Greenwood:)
(He claimed as much during Gothcon 12 at least)

	Now, the Hits value I understand, I guess, as being the inoperative damage
value. The Destroyed damage value is not on there. And this entry Wound is 
not mentioned in the rules commentary. Is Wound the Inoperative Damage,
and Hits the Destroyed? (Table Screwed up?) I Dunno.

	This perplexes me and makes my Animal Encounter Table Generator invalid,
so before it makes the list (Hopefully) I\'d like to fix the flaw so\'s the thing
makes sense...

	Any suggestions that the Traveller Gurus use?

Caution: Lamenting, Whining, and Nostalgia in this message. Take it as
         constructive criticism only. This is not intended as an attack
         on anyone. Comments and replies via the mailing list are welcome.

   Seeing MSamuel\'s message brings up something I didn\'t like about The
New Era, as well as MegaTraveller. But before I get into that, just let me
preface it by saying I *loved* the original Traveller system before
MegaTraveller; I liked it so much that I ran my own \'zine (Security Leak)
and was very active in HIWG, as well as keeping in touch with other \'zine
editors. However...
   When MegaTraveller came out, I lost interest. All of a sudden we were
buried in rules, rules, rules. Too many rules, and complicated ones at
that. Most of the enjoyment of a game isn\'t rolling dice or looking
something up, it\'s in the progression and development of the game; simply,
people enjoy playing more than they enjoy dealing with loads of rules. The
environment of MegaTraveller (ie: the Rebellion) was something I could
live with since there was still civilization and an extremely diverse
number of cultures with which we had to pick and choose from.
   Then there\'s The New Era. Almost every civilization that made Traveller
cool has either been wiped out totally or is nearly gone. Huh? Why? What
fun is there in a game where there\'s only ruins, decay, and corruption?
Must we resort to anti-piracy and relic-seeking missions? What about
international intrigue (espionage)? What about mercenary missions along
the frontiers of a powerful nation? 
   My perception of TNE is that the rules were simplified, but the
universe was destroyed. The universe was *always* Traveller\'s greatest
asset, and now it\'s gone. With one bastion of civilization left, where
else can people go if they want the flavor of the old Imperium? (The
Spinward Marches. But that\'s about it.) I recall a comment from "Survival
Margin" (and I\'m paraphrasing): \'Over the next few years as things begin
to recover\', etc. Few years? We have to sit and wait for yet another
new set of books on the old Imperium? Ugh... 
   IMHO, the Virus should have been something that happened, but TNE
should *not* have been set in the middle of another Long Night. Adding a
taste of \'cyberpunk\' to a game, and updating the rules for simplification,
doesn\'t necessitate destroying the universe. I will try and get a game
together of TNE just to get a feel for the new system. But given that I
haven\'t played a game of "real" Traveller in 5-6 years, and the fact that
TNE doesn\'t really inspire me that much, I\'m wondering if anyone wants to
play TNE. (I know only one person that ever played MegaTraveller, and they
weren\'t overly impressed. I never bothered, and stopped printing my \'zine.)
   
   Loren, I know you\'re on the list. I\'ve been out of the Traveller loop
for some time. The above are my impressions and feelings about the matter,
but if you know, I\'d appreciate knowing what GDW\'s thinking behind TNE
was. Also, I\'d like to know what the current plan\'s for Traveller\'s future
are. Are there new books in the works? Will old books be rereleased to fit
with the new environment? Thanks.

   And thanks to everybody else that made it this far. :)

Just a question.  I have not purchased and read the rules for TNE, so I was
wondering what symbol is The Regency using?  Are they using Norris\' peasus
or a version of the Imperial Sunburst?  Also about the lamenting about Old
Traveller, I see no reason why anyone should have to change if they do not
wish to.  It is still possible to play Traveller anyway you desire
including a blending of all of the elements.  One of the things that I like
about what I\'ve heard about the new system is its cross compatibility with
other GDW games such as Twilight:2000.  I like the fact that if my players
get tired of playing Traveller, I can have something force them onto a
planet where a T:2000 scenario is taking place.  They can play that
scenario out, and then continue with the Traveller campaign.  I say go
ahead and play it however you want.  If you make your campaign interesting
enough you shouldn\'t have trouble finding players to play Classic
Traveller.  Now there is an interesting marketing Idea, "Traveller:
Classic."  GDW could market the whole game in its original style with more
modern designs and with all of the rules suplements wrapped up in one. 
Anyway enough rambling.

Such a fun game.  It had the bad luck to come out as most of the
gaming wenies wanted DARK FUTURE, CYBERTRASH games.  You can see how
this boring trend has destroyed the Third Imperium.  For all the
details, see the book "Boot up, Jack in, Drop out, chummer", IISBN

Quite a good game.  Combat was sort of weird with missile weapons but
the invention system made up for it.

I am interested in this sort of thing too.

I did some tinkering with tech categories for a game I was 
working on some time ago; I will have a look for it but I
think it\'s gone now.

The problem about a rigid hierarchy is that it isn\'t the way these things
really happen.

As a VERY bad example of what I mean; I vaguely remember a situation where a 
group of mathematicians and physicists were trying to solve a problem and
quite by accident an engineer got involved and new the answer straight off
because it was easily solved by a technique that engineers had been using
for many many years.

Back on the point again, do you intend to show cross relationships between
items (eg "gene splicing"-BIOLOGY without "Microscopes"-PHYSICS-ENGINEERING).

I wonder how many research projects died because the technology level in
a related field wasn\'t high enough and now that it is high enough have
they gone back to the original project or is it dead forever?

Have a look in your local Library for any documents on Govt 
expenditure on research.  When I looked many years ago
they had a reasonable breakdown under various categories
like "Life Sciences", "Energy", "Military", "Transport" etc.
It might give you some ideas.

Also, have a look at a complete SCIENCES list for a renowned University.

>Also, if anyone wants to take issue with my categories as they now exist,

I think I need more detail on your categories and what they represent
before I can make any meaningful criticisms.

An important aspect that I think is overlooked in many games is the amount
of detail really needed to achieve the objective of a game.  In an RPG you
can overwhelm players with detailed equipment lists down to the smallest 
item (eg a comb) which when you get down to the real playing probably
isn\'t ever used in play.

If you are going to go to all the trouble of defining tech to the n\'th
degree then you need a use for it in the game.

Just a thought.

I always thought the idea sounded incredibly cool.  I heard that the 
rules were kind of iffy, but that wouldn\'t have dissuaded me as I\'d 
probably want to use the GURPS system regardless.  The problem was that 
I didn\'t really have time to actually use the thing in a game, and the
price was just too steep for curiosity reading.  (I\'m wealthier these 
days, so I might pick it up some day if I ever see it again, but still,
I would have loved to see it as a GURPS sourcebook, where I could just
pay for the cool ideas without the rules I\'m never going to use.)

btw, I don\'t think I\'ve met a serious role-player who would be dissuaded 
by simple rules.  Broken rules, sure, but simple rules only turn off the
wargamers.

One very serious gamer friend and I started a new very light,
simplistic rules game system for a near-future space RPG setting
after getting massively tired of a) rules lawers and b) games that
were ending up mostly rules checks rather than roleplaying.
Simple rules do not a bad game make 8-)

Didn\'t one of the earlier Challenge\'s have that correction?
I thought I saw one...

I have only one problem with the Vigilante as drawn (the design stats
are fine 8-) ... the stupid fighter bay doors should have been
offset so that they were over the port forwards and starboard aft fighter
positions, which would allow much more flexible flight operations.
As is, if a fighter stored under a door gets broken, one of the
others can\'t be launched until the broke one is fixed or jettisoned...

Nah, I don\'t buy that argument.  How about this one: Space:1889 only
appeals to gamers who actually read (and enjoyed reading) the source
material: Jules Verne, Arthur Conan Doyle, Edgar Rice Burroughs.  The
rest just don\'t understand it.  And most of the current generation of
role-players, born around when Star Wars came out give or take a few
years, just haven\'t done the reading, either because they don\'t read
much, or because they aren\'t interested.

I have noticed an accellerating trend.  Everyone, even science-fiction
fans and role-players, seems to be doing less reading and more watching
of movies (on videotape, actually) and television.  And this is
reflected in our games.

> > Are there any other enthusiasts out there?

> (He claimed as much during Gothcon 12 at least)

I like Space:1889.  A lot.  I know one other person who does.

I own a lot of role-playing games.  Some of them I\'ve never played.
Some that I never will play.  Space:1889 is my favorite role-playing
game that I\'ve never played and never will play.  It is the only game in
this category that I continue to spend money on.

*However*, I typically don\'t buy "new" stuff for Space:1889.  I buy
"used" stuff from Crazy Igor, or stuff I find in the bins down at
Wargamers\' Depot.  There are two reasons.

Originally, I did this because I had just gotten burned (again) with the
MegaTraveller rules, and I didn\'t trust GDW to produce something worth
spending serious money on.

Currently, because I don\'t expect to ever be able to
play the game, I can\'t justify spending lots of money on it.

The company I work for manages databases for the National Science Foundation

academic disciplines that is used by the NSF.  I\'ve listed it below (it
has broad categories and "details"; it\'s not perfect, but all of the
different parts of NSF can at least agree on it.  All of the disciplines
also have an "other" detail.  One other thing: it\'s weak in the medical
area, because NSF doesn\'t do much medical research (that\'s NIH\'s
mission).

I think the reason that Space:1889 wasn\'t popular is because it\'s a
fantasy game in a science-fiction setting.  There\'s just too much 
suspension of physical reality (not to mention economic and social reality)
to appeal to SF players.  And it\'s probably too close to reality for
the average fantasy player to enjoy.

I\'ve read Verne and Burroughs, but that doesn\'t mean I think their 
universes would be interesting to wander about in.  I prefer playing
in a world where things have evolved, not regressed.  For example, are
there any female characters allowed in Space:1889?  If there are, there
shouldn\'t be (for internal consistency) and if there aren\'t, probably half
the likely players have just put that game back on the shelf and picked up
the next Cyberpunk game.

I take it as a sign of the maturity of the gaming public that games like
Space:1889 die out rather than a sign of their illiteracy.

Well, in the UK general TV viewing is down, although movies are up. An

the largest niche of the book buying market. I would say that the 
reasons Space:1889 failed were:

"The Difference Engine" came out. Incidentally I see Colin Greenland\'s 
new book (I forget the name) looks from the publicity very like the 
Space 1889 idea.
- - bungled support from GDW, although this was not entirely GDW\'s fault 
(eg they had problems with the parts for some of the boardgames, which 
delayed the line).
- - general quality of support material weak
- - lack of conspicuous success led to usual GDW loss of interest and 
general spiral into oblivion.

Women in TNE:
(Jo Jaquinta notes lack of women in the artwork)
Yeah I noticed this also. The only definite woman in the careers 
section was the "entertainer". Having said this, obviously noone told 
that particular artist they were illustrating an SF game, and in fact 
several of the illos are of members of the Village People. 
I hate the new character generation system anyhow, so this confirmed my 
view of it. Like I guess quite a few people I really liked the old 
system. I\'ll save that argument, but I have a couple of niggles that
I think GDW could look at addressing:
- - the background makes information about the hivers essential, but you 
still seem to need alien module 7 to play them. Also, has anyone ever 
seen a picture of an Ithklur?
- - that d*mn card based motivation scheme! Why not do it as a dice 
driven table? I suspect because it would make it obvious how useless it 
is. Does anyone use it?

Well, I enjoyed the game a lot.  Partly because the GM was one of those few
who could make just about *any* game enjoyable; but I did like the game
itself as well.  I\'ve read some of Jules Verne\'s books, and that\'s all.

That balance was one of the things that attracted me.  It was specifically
not supposed to worry too much about real physics, which meant there was
no chance of getting bogged down with arguments about it.  Having arguments
as part of the role-playing, about why theories about electromagnetic
radiation were wrong and theories about the ether were right, on the other
hand, were fun.  (This ended up with my character saying to some crackpot
who actually believed that there was no such thing as the ether, "You try
to build an aerial flyer and I\'ll try to build an aerial flyer, and we\'ll
see whose one flies. :-)

And here we see the cause of the death of Space 1889; political correctness.
Incidentally, yes there were female characters.  The background meant that
they weren\'t just male characters with breasts, they had to be different,
which just made for some serious role-playing.  The trick with having a
female character was to stay out of the fighting and manipulate all the
males instead, and one of the characters in our game, a countess, was very
good at it.  She invented various forms of explosives but let other people
do the actual dirty work.

Re: someone else\'s comment about people watching movies rather than reading

Didn\'t GDW have a game called "Dinosaurs and Cadillacs", or something similar?
If so, it is probably about to get re-launched in the wake of "Jurassic Park".

(BTW, the situation which piqued my interest in technology development
was a trip to the National Air and Space Museum.  There was a display
of a steam-propelled flying top which had been developed by Classical
Greeks.  I also remembered the Incas using wheels for toys, but not for
any other purposes.  It just makes one wonder what we have today which
seems mundane but may be the basis for future technological advances.)

What I had originally envisioned was the categories would be exhaustive
for tech-as-we-know-it.  Then extrapolated technology (fusion power,
anti-grav, etc.) could be represented as consisting of the various
constituent categories.  For example, fusion power would require a
certain level of PHYSICS and a certain level of ENGINEERING.  Societies 
that had the requisite levels could have fusion, and societies with
greater levels could have fusion plants which were cheaper, smaller,
and more efficient.

Mainly, I\'m trying to nail down categories so that "cheaper", "smaller"
and "more efficient" can be quantified and uniquely determined from
the various development levels which a society has obtained in its
tech development categories.

Hmmm, yeah I suppose tech development really isn\'t relevent to Traveller,
which has a rich background of technology and devices.  But it sure is an
interesting thought exercise.

Well actually, wouldn\'t it be useful for Traveller to have some sort of
rule-of-thumb for how an increase in TL affects price, size, and
efficiency/effectiveness?  For example, how a Rhylanor-produced gauss
rifle (TL15) is "better" than one produced on Regina (TL12).

I remember Mercenary has a short quip on price discounts due to TL along
with price discounts for quantity purchases.  Does anybody out there
use a similar rule-of-thumb for improvements in size, etc.?

I have to disagree with this.  Verne may not have had female characters,
but others could and did.  They were "Victorian" ladies - they wore long
skirts on their adventures - but they were female nonetheless.  They must
have a "Victorian" reason for not staying home with the children - carrying
on their father\'s work, or searching for their long-lost husband, or some
such justifying claptrap, but they can still work as characters.  You need
to have a feel and fondness for the genre.  If you have read Wells, Verne,
Doyle, Burroughs, Kline, or the others from this period then Space:1889 has
a _lot_ of charm.  If not, and most gamers today have not, then it is totally
incomprehensible.  I think the earlier poster was right on the mark: this stuff
is no longer read.

>I take it as a sign of the maturity of the gaming public that games like

Space:1889 was not intended to be "mature" - far from it.  It was intended to
simulate Victorian-era heroic fiction, and it does a pretty good job of it.
It\'s too bad that there is only a tiny slice of the relatively-small gaming
market that have read and appreciate such fiction, and therefore might enjoy
the game - seldom enough for critical mass in any one place, _no_ one I know
has played it.

Something else about FTL 2448... it\'s an old game. It\'s been hanging around

Rish Tucholka (I\'m sure I misspelled it) got a new fervor and reprinted a

just a remix of the old system with a new concept.

Hmmm...I don\'t think so.  There was a correction around 63 or 63 giving

That\'s what happens when you do a quick conversion on an existing hull. (-:
Actually, since I\'m not responsible for the floor plans, you\'re probably
right.  I\'ll point out that it happens in the real world, too, though:
The U.S. Navy\'s aircraft carrying dirigibles Akron and Macon always operated
one plane less than their design capacity in the 1930\'s, because the additional
plane had to be carried on the recovery trapeze, and would have needed to be
jettisoned if its engine wouldn\'t start and another plane had to be launched.
Since the Navy didn\'t have the money to be dropping planes out of zeppelins
just for fun, they made sure that the situation never came up...

Not only that, but what books they are reading are, to my mind,
somewhat questionable... Witness all the D&D/Dangerous Journeys/BattleTech/
Shadow Run/etc. books taking up shelf-space in the SF section...It\'s
getting a little too self-referential for my taste:  instead of good
fiction spawning games the games are spawning the fiction, which then
spawn gaming supplements (The Drow stuff with Mennazoberanen <sp?> spring
to mind...)

Really, this shouldn\'t be that surprising:  Fewer than one person in one
hundred buys or checks out *one book a year*.  And I, personally, am
making up for at least a few hundred people in that statistic :).

Sounds like there are several more here on the list. :)  I\'m more interested
and inspired by it than I have been by any game I\'ve seen in quite awhile.
Unlike you, however, I\'m pretty sure I know some people who might be
amenable to a game.

I find this hard to follow, I\'m afraid.  Why is there maturity in
rejecting a game set in the period of English Imperial-/Colonialism?  I
mean, if we\'re looking at the barbarity of the time period, shouldn\'t
modern gamers be even more horrified to be gaming in a Medieval setting
where religious intolerance and even greater repression of women occurred?
Space:1889 takes liberty with the time period to minimize many of the more
negative aspects of the time period and/or turns them into an opportunity
for role-playing, as almost any game does.  <Shrug>  Artistic license and
all that :)

The difference in playing in a setting where things have evolved vs.
regressed is interesting, but I\'m curious what exactly you mean by it. 
What games *do* you enjoy that have \'evolved\' settings?  Traveller? 
T:TNE?  In many ways, I\'d say that T:TNE seems a shoe-in for regressed,
considering the amount of decay and inhumanity perpetrated by Hard Times
and the Fall of the Imperium.  The RCESs are hardly a shining example of
man\'s moral character :)

I agree that simply liking a genre doesn\'t mean you\'ll want to game in it.
What Wildstar was saying, I think, was that the set of gamers who enjoyed
Space:1889 was properly contained in the group of gamers who enjoyed
Verne/Burroughs/Wells/(And who, perhaps, also enjoyed Blaylock\'s _Lord
Kelvin\'s Machine_ or Moorcock\'s "Oswald Bastable"), not that the two groups
were necessarily identical...

This seems to be a somewhat common theme for GDW, not just in terms of
Space:1889.  It almost seems to me that all this mucking about with
Traveller stems in large part from the people writing the game not being
excited about it.  When it fails to make money, they decide to pound
on it to make it more "modern".  <Shrug>  Does this make sense to anyone
else?

I noticed this, too:  Not only do you need info on the Hivers you haven\'t
got, but I don\'t (at the moment) recall T:TNE giving you even a physical
description of the Ithklur, which Module 7 does, thank goodness!

Traveller...Anybody?

Actually, Space:1889 is the only role-playing game to be covered favorably
in the very anti-fantasy pages of MWAN (The Midwest Wargamer\'s Association
Newsletter).  This was very much a wargamer\'s set of rules, with no fewer
than two sets of miniatures rules (both usable in a strict historical 
sense as well) being written to expnad the coverage of the background.

I think that I agree with you there.  I find it unlikely that anyone who
doesn\'t enjoy the above (and maybe H.G. Wells and H. Rider Haggard too)
is going to be very interested in Space:1889.  That automatically limits 
its appeal to a fairly small niche market, which is probably why it wasn\'t
a success in the marketing sense.

Like Wildstar says, you have to read and enjoy reading that 19th and early
20th century stuff for a game like Space:1889 to be interesting.  However,
I don\'t understand your comments about evolution.  It sounds to me like you
are suggesting that this is a gneral attitude, rather than one that you
hold personally, and given that the general player seems to be into Shadowrun
sorts of games representing more pleasant, evolved societies than the 
Victorian era.  Besides, the comments about female characters lead me
to believe that you have not read the rules very carefully.  There is a
substantial section on female characters, with historical examples to back
it up.  Some careers are restricted to males, but a female character can
even join those by successful use of disguise (!). The female only career
of "Adventuress" is one of the best careers in the game, in terms of
skills and fringe benefits.  I don\'t think that female players would be
offended by this treatment, unless they really want to apply (current)
20th century sensibilites everywhere regardless of appropriateness.  My wife
is certainly willing to play...

(Side note: Space:1889 is hardly the only historically-based game to 
treat male and female characters differently.  I draw your attention to
Lace and Steel, Flashing Blades, and a number of historical GURPS 
supplements to begin with...)

Sounds like flame bait to me!  Care to elaborate a bit?

I agree with this observation. Of the 8 people (plus GM) in our current 2300
campaign, the GM and I are the only serious SF readers in the group (we\'ve
got a couple of Star Trek readers, but that doesn\'t count :-). The two of
us, on the other hand, plow through around 2 novels/week, and we have
similar tastes.

As a result, there\'s alot of interplay between myself and the GM that nobody
else understands. It\'s very frustrating.

Also, we\'d love to be able to say "This universe has much in common with
C. J. Cherryh\'s Downbelow Station universe", but nobody understands...

Or because those books are hard to find, or because there\'s such a vast
amount of classic sf around to read that they haven\'t gotten around to 
it yet.  Give us a break, mon.

Yes and I wish they would hurry up and release the movie out here in OZ

when it finally arrives 8^{.

I\'ve heard we won\'t be getting it until September !!!   Ahhhhhhhhh !!!

Hmmm.  How about organic computers.  What about a society totally geared
to a biological technology.  Trees grown to be living houses.  Cold fusion.

I read a book a long time ago (oh no I hear you say ... suffer!) where
technology took a different path.  There was a simple law of physics that
if seen would lead on to anti-grav and space flight but precluded all
electrical type technology as we know it today.  If you took the path to
electricity then the other path disappers as "not cost effective" etc.  
eventually you reach the "electricity" dead end and everyone\'s forgotten about
the other technology path.

Yes. Yes. Yes.  What\'s missing in Traveller (and most) RPGs are the various
manufacturer ratings.  Why is a 9mm revolver bought from planet A better
than one bought from planet B.  Tech level?  Cost?  Reliability doesn\'t 
appear to be a factor in Traveller.  How many times has your gun jammed
in a fire fight?  When did a mate of yours suddenly discover that a generic
brand grav-belt has a lower MTBF.  Can you get amunition for that 10.5mm
revolver you bought back on planet K.

>Gregg Giles

Ok here goes I\'ve got a few things to say here I\'ve been playing 
Traveller since the first three books I have had to bend rules in  
every game I\'ve played and I haven\'t worried to much but I find the 
T:TNE rules seem very well put together and well thought out.
MT had some serious flaws... I still have used the Rebellion as a 
background for my games ( we are only "up" to late 1118 :-))
We started at Capitol and ran from there!

Ok I\'m not going to play in the new era to soon but I may run in 
the period leading up to the 1200\'s as the Zhodani and Regency are 
getting closer politically and the Sword worlds and Vargar states 
are not going like it one bit. How\'s that for the old intrigue  
(espionage)? I also think that the Arden group might be "Modified"
Neither the Regency or the Zho\'s like them. More game stuff.

I haven\'t even mentioned the idea of ruin searches or doing in T.E.D.s
so there is a lot of game potential here even if some of the old  
imperium has a dark cyber - punk air. the T:TNE rules seem to be 
good, and I am waiting for the equipment, and ship building rules, so 
we will have a good idea of what we can and can\'t do. I will probably
still keep the thrusters as the idea of mounting the biggest fusion
or plasma gun on the back of my characters\' ship does not thrill me.
and we will be playing a more "classic" Traveller scenario than the
central parts of the Former Imperium. Although I can see some missions 
taking them out there...

>Flynn - -- Sean C. O\'Toole 

Well I think it makes sense we don\'t have to buy a game for ground 
combat GDW already has one... fits right in with the exception of 
some weapons...

Hummm this sounds like an interesting idea but I have noticed that 
most of the people who are complaining have already collected most 
of the old stuff. I have all of the Journals as well as Digest from
no.8 as well as most of the GDW stuff... so I don\'t know if it would
sell and GDW is in business to sell gaming stuff... besides I wouldn\'t 
want anything to get in the way of their other stuff for T:TNE.


On the Ine Givar... they were terrorists supported by elements of the
Zhodani as well as the Sword worlds. ( as near as I could tell )
I have done some thinking about who is supporting them in the 1120\'s
as I have a character who has a bad tweak she kills Ine Givar! so far
she hasn\'t been caught but it is only a matter of time.

In my game they are supported now (1120\'s) by the sword worlds and an
origination mentioned in the MT game in the Digest the Order of the 
Red Star. This gives them some really "BAD" psionic help could be  
trouble. ( Catie, Jim, Jeff, Evan you didn\'t see this...)
It\'s hard when your players read this but they are good at not knowing
what the characters shouldn\'t.
Good gamers.

anyway the upshot of all this is that the Ine Givar are just what you 
make of them...
and so for that matter so is the game ...

On the matter of a wake I would be able to host one at my house in the 
S.F. bay area. ( I\'d think of it as more of a party for us travellers)
but even so I would be happy to do it but we would have to see more 
interest than I\'ve so far seen.

I like traveller and I have been known to take great liberties with
rules and planetary information to fit my preconceptions. So I inform
my players that I have done that as well as I have a very laid back 
GMing style Dudes! :-) well I am a native of California Dudes and 
Dudeets ;-) ( I\'ve just been informed by one of my players that they
REALLY do talk like that! )

Hey!  I\'ll vouch that Tucson\'s local TV is still stuck at TL 7.  Only 7 local
stations, and if you\'ve only got rabbit-ears, most people only really get 4 or
5 (marginally.)  \'Course I only flip it on for STTNG (keeping with the SFRPG
thread) and Designing Women (keeping with the PC vs. Victorian thread.)  :)

On the Victorians in Space (I can hear Jim Henson muttering in his grave...)
thread, anyone remember Dray Prescot series by Alan Burt Akers?  "Transit to
Scorpio", "The Suns of Scorpio", "Warriors of Scorpio", etc.?  Great fun.  :)

I don\'t really agree with that.  In many ways Space:1889 is much
closer to Classic Traveller than T:TNE.  Just look at it:

	Traveller			Space:1889
	=========			==========
	Zhodani				Belgians
	Vagar				Flying Martians
	Grandfather			Ancient Weird Tech
	Jump Message Routes		Mirror communication network
	Emperor Strephon		Queen Elizabeth
	High Guard			Ironclads and Etherflyers
	Striker				??? The miniatures rules
	Space Opera Adventures		Space Opera Adventures
	Strange Alien Civs		Strange Alien Civs
	archeological wonders		archeological wonders
	dead civilizations		dead civilizations
	    to be looted		    to be looted
	       .			       .
	       .			       .
	       .			       .

As you can see there are lots and lots of stuff that the two games
have in common.

Get real.  The books are really cheap.  Much cheaper than new
paperbacks.  Look in the classics section at larger bookstoors.  
Barns & Noble has lots of wonderful old stuff.  You can pick up
collections of all of the writings of various old authors.

material for their campaigns (e.g. the alien races) but there\'s not
really enough \'meat\' to make an independent game.  Most of the tables 
cover the sorts of things a DM just improvises during play, so I found
very little useful stuff in it.

However, another game by the same guy--FRINGEWORTHY--is worth getting.
Portals to alternate universes have been found on present day Earth, and
explorers are needed.  The catch is that only 1 out of every million people
has some unknown quality that allows them to pass through to the other worlds.
Since this quality is distributed randomly throughout the population, your
character can be from any walk of life (banker/thief/spy/aborigine/etc.)

The hard part of Fringeworthy is designing internally consistent parallel
universes for the players to explore.  But it\'s a decent game otherwise.

Normally a laser sight is only good out to 40 meters, but in conjunction 
with the electronic sight this is extended to 400 meters.

The "light power armour" this weapon is intended to kill includes recon

Notes: The ARC-10 is produced by a variety of companies, most of them on 
Neubayern. The design is simply an evolutionary development of the Heckler 
and Koch G11, developed in the twentieth century. The ARC-10 fires a 
powerful discarding-sabot round intended to be lethal even through light 
power armour. Unlike the G11, the ARC-10 has no auto-fire capability. It 
has an integral laser sight and an electronic sight in the carrying handle. 
The ARC-10 is the most widely-used service rifle in the Cluster, with over 
50 million manufactured to date. In addition to the Neubayern Army, it is 
used by the Neubayern Federation Marine Corp, the NeuBerlin Metropolitan 
Police Force, and a variety of smaller police forces on Neubayern. The 
ARC-10 was widely exported before the current export restrictions were 
adopted in 5620.

There\'s a *reason* why stuff like Burroughs and Wells is getting harder
to find. It\'s in the Public domain, which means that the publishers
have to worry about "what if somebody *else* prints a copy that\'s
better/cheaper/whatever than ours?" Which generally means that they
don\'t bother.

On the other hand, this has it\'s advantages. There are *several* groups
making PD materail available in electronic form on both Fidonet and the
Internet. I\'ve got the first 5 Burroughs "Mars" books on my HD. I\'m
considering running them through a travesty generator to see if it\'ll
produce a usable plot for an adventure. :-)

I think this one may have been by Poul Anderson.  As I recall, one of the
side effects of taking the antigrav path is that you never get the really
neato weapons, flight tech, etc. 

I think the story starts with a group of conquistador type ETs landing their 
spaceship on a current tech Earth, and opening up on the natives with their
super high tech weapons (muskets).  Things progress as might be expected
from this point.

Wasn\'t it barium? I recall some ancient spacer joke about the best thing
to do with a Vargr jump-drive ("bury \'em"). Hmmm ... how does this pun
translate into Galanglic? Is Galanglic still part of TNE?

OK.  Let\'s make this official.  I\'d like to order one (1) CC210 Chinese
Chess set, and one (1) copy of S4, _Chinese Chess For Beginners_.  Since
the CC210s are currently out of stock, that\'ll have to wait, but I\'ll
take the book now, since I can fake the game reasonably well with my 
Korean chess set.

My address is: Rob Dean
               6205-D Edgewood Road
               Edgewood, MD 21040

and my Mastercard is 5329 0315 0121 9610 (11/93).

Any idea when the sets might be in?

1889-1920.  I will probably run it, one day.

My Traveller campaign is currently on hold, having reached a suitable

background tasks and look at the TNE rules (which I don\'t have yet,
but I do have the boxed edition on order through Wargames West).  I
know the ship design stuff isn\'t out yet, but does anyone have an
intuition as to how detailed it will be, and how well pre-rebellion
(long live Strephon!) Imperial ships will convert?  Also, how feasible
is it to use MT ship designs (and combat rules, if necessary) along
with the other TNE rules?  I have to decide whether to add
long-desired updates to my MT ship design programme or whether to
start from scratch on a TNE one.

Actually the story was by Harry Turtledove, and titled something like
"The Road Less Traveled" (I\'m not really sure of the name).

It made a good story, but I couldn\'t really see it as a role-playing
universe, because the players (if human) would be too advanced over the
aliens (hm, sounds like New Traveler...).

The stories you are discussing are "Herbig-Haro" and "The Road Not Taken",
both by Harry Turtledove.  I think both of them are in his short story
collections someplace, but he\'s a prolific short story writer, and his
stuff is everywhere.  "Herbig-HAro" was one of the first stories he published
in Analog, and takes place sometime after the humans built an empire using the
easy drive technology left to them by the aliens and their own surperior
weapons.  This empire, like all human foundations, eventually collapsed, and
the story is about the first contact with another race which also has gone
the road to electricity and so forth.

"THe Road Not Taken" expands on a small sequence from "Herbig-Haro", in which
the arrival of the 17th century style aliens on Earth is shown.

And this is spite of the fact that the most popular blunder is for
people to autoreply to a TML digest, which by default sends a message to
me alone (traveller-request) instead of the digest alias. I don\'t know
how you do it, Rob.

You\'ve almost topped my blunder of mailing my checkbook to Sweden along
with a couple of MegaTraveller books that I arranged to send to a TMLer.
"Honest honey, it must\'ve dropped in the box just before I sealed it at
the Post Office." I\'ll never live it down.

	I have been putting together my own little game background (because I can\'t
get enough information about the Official game universe to like it...) and have
begun plotting positions from an astrophysics text using Right Ascension
coordinates and either Ly or pc distances. Having exhausted the chartings of
star systems that actually existed in the old Solomani Rim data and the
information in my text, I went to the local University Library. Lot of texts,
but only one Brightest Star Catalogue - with no distances. Now, I am no
astrophysicist, and I shudder at the idea of having to actually interpret
the Hertzprung-Russell Diagram and use the Visual Magnitudes listed, which are
in several different systems.

	So, does anyone out there have a listing of stars in the Terra Locale with
some form of direction and distance information? In electronic Format? If so,
could you mail it to me?  Thanks all.

Subject: Mistake on fusion drive
Summary: 
Followup-To: 
Distribution: world
Organization: UC Davis Dept of Applied Science at LLNL
Keywords: Traveller

I posted an article yesterday about the efficeincy of fusion drives.
Well, when I do the math again in the daylight, I find that the energy
yield for a fusion powerplant burning 1 m^3 of Hydrogen is 3 orders of
magnitude higher than my post suggested. A fusion plant of this type,
operating at 50% efficiency would have an output of:

2.27E10 MJ/m^3, 

Thus a 1000 MW powerplant would take 2.27E7 seconds (262 days) to
consume 1 m^3 of fuel. This means it would be very easy to build a
powerplant with a 20 or 50 year duration.

unfortunatly, this also means the rocket velocity is going to .1 c.
Since this would result in an error in the classical figure of only
about 1%, I will use the classical figure anyway. It is

Vr=-2.53E7 m/s

This results in the fuel usage (in kg/s) going as:

dM/dt=Mi(1-exp(a*t/Vr))*(a/Vr)

Thus a fusion propelled 1000T vessel would require  .14% of ships mass
for fuel (20 m^3) for 1  hour at 1g. for 1 day, it would take 3.3% of
ships mass for fuel (474 m^3). For 1 month at 1 g, 64.1% (9054 m^3).
If a ship was going to do alot of in system travelling, it might be able
to supplement it\'s fuel with a Bussard ramjet aproach. Of course, 30
days a 1g would put you half way to the next star system unless half of
it was spent slowing down. 15 days acc + 15 days decel would get you 111
Au out, Pluto is only 75 au out. so if your ship can carry 50% fuel, you
can get pretty much anywhere in the solar system in 30 days. 

Now the real question; "Why is this important?"
Ans: Because this B.S. about jumping into a system 100 planetary
diameters out from your target sucks. It takes away all opportunities
for piracy. There is no reason each system couldn\'t just station a few
SDBs at critical locations, and completely police an entire system. If
you have to jump farther out, there are plenty of opportunities  for
piracy - of course matching velocities can become a major problem.

The joke on the Vargr jump drives?
ie Vargr jump drive:  Barium --> Bury \'em.

I don\'t think it would be particularly funny to the first
human explorers who contacted the Vargr.  For one thing,
I doubt the joke translates into Vilani.  For another, the
average Vilani spacer doesn\'t even KNOW what kind of material
is in his drives.

And, considering as this contact was made around the Eleventh
Century AD, (presumably when the Vargr stopped using Barium)
The joke would make about as much sence in the time of the
Imperium as would a similar joke about the Solmani attempts to
prove the existence of the Aether.  :-)

Check out the FAQ for sci.astro.  The answer you seek is there (and,
interestingly, a pointer to the Traveller:2300/2300AD starmap :)

Specifically, you can ftp "The Catalogue of Stars in 25 Parsecs of the
Sun" from ames.arc.nasa.gov in pub/SPACE/FAQ/stars.data & stars.doc or
you can get the Yale Bright Star Catalogue (check the FAQ)...The 25
Parsec file has RA and parallax (1/parallax gives you the distance in
Parsecs, as I recall) plus a bunch of other info that\'s probably more
than you want to know...Good hunting!

    'body' => '  I was in a weird mood last weekend.  A friend had rented "Gumball
  Rally" (I think that was the title), and during the after-movie 
  gab session, we somehow got onto the subject of the America\'s Cup 
  yacht race, and from there, to Traveller (no, I don\'t remember 
  how.  You don\'t stay sober with my friends when you watch 
  something like Gumball Rally.  Or Spaceballs).  The idea for a 
  (type Y modified) Yacht Race was played around with.  So, this 
  afternoon, the idea hit me again (I was totally sober - the NYPD 
  doesn\'t approve of people being inebriated on duty - not even 
  civilians), and I thought "Why not?"  So, the following is 
  reprinted with permission.  Lines of "==========" represent page 
  breaks.  Some background not given in the Stellar Seas article:

  The Glisten Cup was created in 1148 as a cooperative effort among 
  several of the economically strong planets and the Regency Office 
  for Economic Development as a way to encourage economic activity 
  (tourism) that would lift the Regency out of the post-Collapse 
  depression.  Coupled with public works projects throughout the 
  Regency, and the increased trade with the other Spinward States, 
  the effort succeeded.  Because of the duration of the race, it 
  was decided that running it annually was impractical.  A 
  four-year cycle (as needed) was felt to provide the desired 
  stimulus, and result in a manageable race system.  An attempt to 
  discontinue the race after the 1164 running resulted in such 
  protests against what had turned out to be a popular sporting 
  event that the Regency and the Coordinating Committee 
  acknowledged that it had passed into "tradition."  The 1168 race 
  was a casualty of the decision and the protests, but the race 
  returned in 1172, with news coverage in all of the Spinward 
  States.  The twelfth running in 1196 saw the team from Dinomn win 
  with an extremely unorthodox design, but protests from every 
  other participating team caused the results to be voided, and it 
  was announced that the Coordinating Committee would reexamine and 
  revise the rules for the 1200 race.  Unfortunately, the Committee 
  could not agree on rules in time to allow for proper 
  qualification races to occur, and the 1200 race went by the 
  wayside.  On 180-1200, the Committee announced that they had come 
  to a virtual agreement on new rules for the 1204 race, and that 
  they expected that the new rules would be published within the 
  next 50 days.

  Currently, the Committee is debating whether to permit teams from 
  outside the Regency to participate in the 1208 running of the 
  race.

  This could be interesting!  Posit this:  During the Collapse, a 
  system which had made TL13 under Imperial rule is blown back to 
  about TL2 or 3, and they have to rebuild their tech with no notes 
  (i.e., they have to reinvent it).  Now, they\'ve somehow managed 
  to get on this tech path instead of the other one, that the 
  Imperial UWP was based on.  So, we\'ve got a culture with space 
  flight and antigrav (which according to the standard scale means 
  TL10), but which doesn\'t have internal combustion or computers 
  (well, possibly computers, of the Difference Engine/Analytical 
  Engine type) or laser weapons or radio or..., which, ignoring the 
  existance of the space flight and antigrav, puts them at TL6 or 
  lower.  How do we write a UWP for this world?  Do we have to go 
  to DGP\'s extended generation, and use the tech profile?  Or do we 
  just dump this world into an interuniversal warp and let the 
  Space:1889 folks play with it?

     The starship design and combat sequence was separated out
because we did not want to make the rules book too large (a $45
rules book meets considerable sales resistance) and (believe it
or not) not everybody wants starship combat and generation rules
(albeit those who do seem to be in the majority on the TML).

     A fair number of Traveller players (judging from our calls and

setting, so we allowed for them to do so.

     > The Imperial Sunburst has finaly sputtered and gone out.
     No it hasn\'t. Anyone who wants to use the pre-Rebellion
background (or any other background) can still do so using the
new rules. I\'m sorry you feel that we\'ve let you down
somehow...could you Email me privately with what it is you find
so grossly offensive about the new system, other than the fact
that it isn\'t Classic Traveller?

     > Well, I\'ve managed to unearth a copy of Space:1889...Any
thoughts
      > on why it never caught on?
     Space: 1889 sold very well for about 18 months. Then, everyone
who wanted a copy of the rules had bought one, and sales tapered
off to a fairly low level. Sales of supporting materials
(adventures, and the like) were never as high as the rules. It is
impossible to sustain a game line
on just a rules book...a company MUST sell additional supporting
material -- and Space: 1889 supporting material didn\'t sell well
enough to support itself.
 IMHO, the following principles are at work:
 -- A Space: 1889 player is born, not made. The existing players
and referees are _VERY_ enthusiastic (I like the background a
great deal myself, although I think the mechanics are a little
simplistic), but you cannot convert someone to the game if they
are not interested in the milieu.
 -- Space: 1889 referees didn\'t buy adventures and supplements
because they didn\'t need them. They found ample adventuring ideas
(and still do...the game _still_ has a following, and we still
sell a few rules books from time to time) in the aformentioned
literary base (Verne, Burroughs, Haggard, et al.).
 Gregg Giles:

 No one at GDW ever completely understood every facet of
MegaTraveller\'s rules, and (IMHO) no one at Digest Group did
either. I found the task system needlessly complicated, and most
rules mechanics overladen with unnecessary details. The New Era
rules are an outgrowth of the mechanics of Twilight: 2000, which
were an evolutionary development on the original (Classic)
Traveller mechanics combined with new systems.

 Here they are, from my viewpoint (others may differ slightly):
 We talk with our consumers as much as we can, and we try to
stay in touch with as many of them as we can, through letters,
electronic forums such as Internet, GEnie, and AOL, and face-to-
face. We also solicit feedback from storeowners, distributors,
and others in the sales and distribution network. Out of all the
feedback we got, three clear messages emerged about
MegaTraveller:
 1) People were no longer playing it in the numbers they once
had, i.e., long-time players were giving it up.
 2) New gamers were not joining existing groups, and new groups
were not forming.
 3) Store owners and distributors were experiencing declining
sales of new products. This meant that the game would eventually
die out (except for a small group of die-hards), and the world
would lose the best SF RPG ever created.
 One of the problems with MegaTraveller seemed to be that the
amount of material that a new gamer had to absorb in order to be
able to play the game was gigantic and growing. Everybody had to
be up to speed on the Rebellion, all of the factions, and needed
to know a massive amount of game "history" in order to be able to
enjoy the game. We heard this hundreds of times, from store
owners, referees, and players. More importantly, we heard it from
former players and former referees, in response to our "what made
you quit?" queries.
 Another factor in our decision was the increasingly difficult
task of producing material for MegaTraveller. A game will not
sell unless a company supports it with adventures, sourcebooks,
and the like, and no one at GDW (not Frank, not Marc, not me, not
Dave when he came aboard) understood how the rules worked...not
completely. This meant that we couldn\'t design material for our
own game...not good material anyway, and that is a situation that
could not be allowed to continue if the game was to live.
 We had a choice: do something or stand by and watch 15 years of
work go down the drain. We chose to do something.
 First, we decided to make the mechanics those of Twilight:
2000. We were all familiar with that system, and we all felt
comfortable with it.
 Second, we decided to make it so that no new player needed to
absorb the complete history of the Imperium in order to be able
to enjoy playing. The added background for the new era does that.
Notice I did not say NEW background...it merely adds to the
history, it does not completely invalidate what came before. Long-
time referees can set their campaign anywhere they want to, but
new campaigns can start without absorbing a mountain of
background.
 That\'s it in a nutshell. Did we make the right decision? Time
will tell, but initial sales of TNE have been VERY high, and
reception has been almost uniformly positive...we have received
many letters beginning with words to the effect of: "I had
stopped playing Traveller years ago, but TNE has made me start
again." Another widespread sentiment is that we have recaptured
the feel of the Classic Traveller...a sentiment which some on the
TML have expressed.
 > I\'d like to know what the current plan\'s for Traveller\'s
future are. Are there new books
 > in the works?
 Yep. Brilliant Lances just went off to the printer, and it\'ll
be in the warehouse being packed and shipped by 15 August. Fire,
Fusion and Steel (the technical architecture book) will be
available in November, as will the Deluxe (boxed) Traveller Set
(which will simply be the Basic book plus FF&S and some other
goodies TBA -- and before someone else asks, yes, you will be
able to buy the parts separately).
 Adventures (as yet unnamed) are being written. You\'ll even see
my name on Traveller products again, something that hasn\'t
happened since the Classic days. I\'m even doing some starships,
which I NEVER did before...the new design system has inspired me!
 > Will old books be rereleased to fit with the new environment?
 Not in the forseeable future. We will be releasing Striker II
in 1994, but we will be concentrating on RCES/Regency adventure
material and equipment sourcebooks for a while. We haven\'t
decided exactly how best to do aliens material yet. Anybody have
any suggestions as to how we should present the alien races, and
in what order?

 Actually, it\'s a science fiction game where the science is pre-
quantum mechanics. Ever consider the possibilities inherent in a
purely Newtonian universe? None of that messy stuff to get in the
way of good solid cannonball-out-the-window physics.

 Internal consistency with what? With the notion that Victorian
women were frail, timid creatures who never did anything exciting
or remotely dangerous? This was a common notion among middle-
class Victorian men, but the reality is more complex than myth
(ain\'t it usually?). I suggest that you look into the careers of
Mary Kingsley, Ethel St Clair Grimmond, Lizzie Hessel, Frances
"Fanny" Dubberly, and Elizabeth "Nelly Bly" Cochrane for 19th
century female adventurer prototypes (don\'t bother with General
Evelyn Wood...he wasn\'t a woman). I\'ll admit there WAS a tendency
for women to wear skirts in steaming jungles, but not everyone
can escape the shackles of their time.
  Adrian Hurt:
 >The trick with having a female character was to stay out of
the fighting and manipulate
 > all the males instead
 I played in a game with two women playing female characters. By
the end of it, the Martians came to believe that Earth was a
matriarchy because 1) the women seemed to be the most competent
characters around (all of the men in the campaign were buffoons,
myself excepted), and 2) Victoria ruled the British Empire. My
character was a German officer on an espionage mission, and I had
to think fast to keep out of trouble (claiming that the German
Emperor was Victoria nephew helped considerably).
 My favorite character had to be Cameron, a very proper British
butler, and his associated NPC, Colonel Sir Jarvis Paget-Newton-
Chandos-Forbes-Ditherby-Stoat. ("Perhaps the Colonel would care
to remove the tentacles from his legs with this machete whilst I
reload his shotgun.").
 Larry Smith:

 So it does...so it does.
 Leonard.Erickson:
 > There\'s a *reason* why stuff like Burroughs and Wells is

 As Matt Goldman has pointed out, its not hard to find at all.
Most good bookstores carry it, as does every library worthy of
the name. Burroughs, Wells, Verne, are all there, and Kline,
Haggard and the others can be found with only a little more
effort.
 >  It\'s in the Public domain
 Some of it is, some of it isn\'t. The Burrough\'s estate managed
to keep copyright control of some of E. R.\'s stuff, I do believe.
Just because someone has OCR-ed it and uploaded it doesn\'t meant
the copyright has run out.
 Re: FTL:2448/Fringeworthy:
 Fringeworthy is a neat idea for a game. I was working on

 Actually, Cadillacs & Dinosaurs is being re-issued in November,
to coincide with the animated television series of the same name
(on CBS, for us yanks).

Hmmm...  I\'d pose a slightly different scenario.  TL blow-back to 5 or 6,
say, but the technologies that are emphasised during the re-growth period
are those that have immediate military value.  Given the relative cheapness
of life in the "Wilds", medical technology isn\'t quite up-to-par with weapons
and transport technology, etc.

Something else to consider: post-VIRUS worlds won\'t have _as_ hard a time
finding rare raw materials for _fill_in_the_blank_ since a good chunk of what
they need can be recovered from artifacts.  (So, _how_ difficult _is_ Lanthanum
to find, without a ready supply of blown-out starships?)

Just thoughts,

Wake up and smell the coffee you guys!  Classic Traveller is dead!
I personally love the Classic Traveller setting, and have sought out
as much of the material published for the game both by GDW and others as
I can find.  But I have to admit that the game passed on because for
several very good reasons.  Classic Traveller required too many supplemental
materials, most of which were contradictory.  This game had no less than
two starship design systems, three starship combat systems, four personnel
combat systems, two trade systems, and three planetary design systems.

Obviously, a revision of some sort was necessary.  DGP compiled Striker,
Books 1 - 8, added a Task System, revamped combat, and made it all semi-
consistent.  For this, they deserve applause.  Unfortunately, the end
result was far less than usable.  By combining all the rules, they made
the learning curve very intimidating.  Furthermore, they added an environment 
that many Classic Traveller players found very uncormfortable.  Personally,
I used the MegaTrav rules in the Classic Trav setting.

So, now TNE is out.  I haven\'t bothered to buy it yet.  So far, people have
criticized its technical accuracy, and its setting.  The setting is optional.
I still own all my Classic Trav stuff, and will continue to use it.  But
maybe I\'ll get creative and play a Rebellion campaign if I feel like it.  Or
even a Virus campaign!  Why not!

As regards the technical accuracy, give GDW and Loren a break!  I speak as
a physics graduate student when I say that Traveller is very enjoyable Space
Fantasy, that leans to the technically plausible.  Could we please have some
constructive suggestions around here?  Its easy to be negative, lets try to
be positive for a change!

Just to put my money where my mouth is, here is an Amber Zone setting, ala
the old Travellers\' Journal:

You are one of the crew and co-owner of the Type A2 Far Trader Boundless.
That risk you took on a cargo hold full of chrome-plated fishing poles turned
into a total loss.  This, combined with the overall bad luck you and your
crewmates have had this past year, mean that you have come close to defaulting
on your bank loan.  But at the last minute, opportunity shows itself.  One of
your crewmates has made contact with someone willing to pay top credit to a
ship willing to translate a cargo of unknown origin off of a nearby Red Zone
planet.  Despite misgivings, your and your crewmates decide to go for it.
Possible results are:
1) The offer turns out to be a double-cross.  The cargo should be suitably
   valuable. At some point during the transaction, an attempt will be
   made to capture the vessel.
2) The offer turns out to be a trap.  The subsector security forces attempt
   to arrest the crew shortly after they arrive at the Red Zoned system.
3) The offer is genuine.  By bad luck, a subsector security force patrol 
   craft will be encountered while the crew are in the Red Zoned system.
4) The offer is genuine.  The cargo consists of some of the local sentients.
   The crew should be made aware of this fact, and be faced with the moral
   delimma of whether to participate in the slave trade or not.
5) The offer is genuine.  Some months after the transaction, an unknown man
   contacts a member of the crew, and threatens to inform the authorities
   of their law-breaking activities.
6) The offer is genuine.  The planet turns out to be protected by a picket
   satellite, which is armed with a large number of missiles.  Use the 
   following task, to be thrown once while landing on the planet, and again
   when departing:
   To successfully evade the picket satellite:
   Routine, Pilot, Ships Tactics, 30 minutes.
   Referee:  If this task fails, the sattellite makes one missile attack on
   the ship at long range.  If anything less than extreme success, the 
   sattellite makes a holovideo of the ship, and records any transmissions
   made by the ship (including the transponder, if active).

putting out a purely player oriented rules suplement?  I like my players to
have access to the rules, but the price and size of the main book are
prohibitive.  Also there are refferee only sections in the main book that
the players should not have access to.  This leaves me in a precarious
situation.  I either photocopy (Completely in violation of copyright.) the
appropriate sections of the rule book, or wait and see if GDW releases one.
 This was one of the things that I liked about the MegaTraveller system was
that you could buy the boxed set, with all three of the main books or buy
them individually if you did not need the referee stuff.  I appreciate you
taking the time to answer this query.

Sadly very true.  Most people get this glazed look in their eyes and then

MegaTraveller reminded me of a campaign gone sour.  Like when the players
go off on a weird tangent that they can\'t really return from.

The problem is that the only new material that will be out of GDW
will be stuff based upon the post-virus universe.  Leaving those of
us who don\'t like the current direction of the Imperium in the same
shoes as those of us who play/run Space: 1889.

Re:  Aliens and what to do about \'em...

Well, speaking for myself, I\'d like to suggest putting *all* the "core"
aliens into one sourcebook.  I\'d suggest putting in, at least:

Aslan, Vargr, Droyne, Hiver, K\'kree, Zhodani, and Darrians (and possibly
Solomani, although that might now be a moot point considering the likely
state of the Solomani Confederation)

(All the Alien books, obviously :)

A friend of mine points out that this might be a somewhat "hard sell",
since it\'s likely to be a pretty hefty book.  I think most existing
and prospective Traveller players would go for such a product if for no
other reason that you ought to have aliens in an SF game :)  My friend
disagrees....<Shrug>

On a side note, some/more detail on some of the minor races might be
welcome.  On an even farther side note, how \'bout a Sword Worlds
sourcebook?

Then again, maybe I\'m pushing for too much detail in the setting,
instead of allowing the players to detail it themselves...<Shrug>

Re: Your post concerning Software...

Huh?  That was a tad garbled.  I take it that you want people to ask
before distributing Traveller software and/or making it Public Domain?

Terrorists or Freedom Fighters?

Yes, one of my fave terrorist organizations.  I know Loren just
said they were deliberately vague on \'em, but I always got the
impression that they were the Pro-Psionic Rights terrorist group of
the Imperium.  (Yeah, I know, but I started this before Red Star
was ever put on the maps)  My initial assumption was based on the
fact that he very moral Zhodani were willing to back them.

As their groups were at least partially composed of psionic adepts
it made the group very subversive.  Consider.  The Imperium would
need to use what knowlege of psionics it had to fight them.  That
means they use the few trained psionics they have.  Now, as the Ine
Givar will loudly claim, they are fighting for the rights of the
very people who are hunting them!

The Ine Givar had legitimate organizations and lobby groups running
around the Imperium (trying not to get lynched) bringing lawsuits
against the Imperial prohibitions on Psionics.  There were all
kinds of peaceful demonstrations:  sit-ins... marches...  voting
drives...  rallies...  fund raising parties...

And of course there\'s Saint Sinn\'s Day on 073:  Sinn was martyred
on the first day of the Psionic suppressions back in the 700s.
Everyone marches in parades, wears something blue, get excedingly
drunk on blue beer, etc. etc.  The Ine Givar have made this holiday
their national day and a great deal of their activity occurs on
that day.  It\'s the one day where most people feel proud of any
ethnic connection they might have to the psionic saint of Esalin.
Of course anyone who wears red (symbolizing the blood of Sinn) may
be subject to harrassment.

I remember one PC who after learning what the Ine Givar were REALLY
up to looked up and said, "Why are we fighting these guys?  Why
aren\'t we HELPING them!..."

 ...Then I had the Ine Givar blow up another shopping mall full of
civilians and massacre the entire crew and passengers of a
subsidized liner...  |->

As I understand it, a rifle that uses gunpowder has recoil because of the

  A guass rifle works by pulling the bullet down the barrel with an
electromagnetic field.  Thus, no pressure agains the breech.  I\'m I missing
something really basic here?

>  Does anyone know if deckplans for the yatch has been published anywhere?

Yeah, they have.  About eleven years ago, though!  The deck plans for the
standard _Lady of Shallott_ class Type Y Yacht were published in FASA\'s
_Adventure Class Ships, Vol. II_ at 25mm scale back in \'82.  Like a lot
of the old deck plans they needed a bit of cleaning up, IMHO.  I prefer 
the plans in Vol. I of the non-standard 400 ton _Desiree Keah_ class 
yacht.  The whole bow of the ship was a two-deck ballroom with transparent
bulkheads!

For the non-oldtimers, the FASA _Adventure Class_ volumes were boxed sets
with five sheets of deckplans at 25mm scale that could be unfolded and
used for miniatures combat with "Martian Metal Miniatures, Azhanti High
Lightning [the game], Snapshot Rules, [and] Striker Miniature Rules" or
the included counters.  They date back to the days when FASA was still
occasionally referring to itself as the "Freedonian Air and Space 
Administration".  The deck plans were printed on both sides of the sheet,
so you got ten classes of ship with each set.

The two volumes are hard to find -- I stumbled on them in a used book 
store that I\'ve *never* seen carry any other games.  Good luck finding
something more recent!

  Yes, momentum. If you take something that is standing still and throw it
forward you will go backwards regardless of *how* you throw it. But don\'t
worry, the New York Times made the same error once in an editorial about
Goddard:)

  The recoil of a gauss weapon of a specific damage will however often be
*less* than for a conventional weapon of the same damage, because first of all
you don\'t throw bullet+gasses but just the bullet. This should reduce it by
25 percent or so.
  Secondly, speaking 3G3, gauss weapons have more slender projectiles that
penetrate better for a given energy, so to get a specific penetration and
a specific damage, you can make do with a lighter projectile, also reducing
recoil.
  I suspect that adding both effects will aproximately halve recoil compared
to a conventional weapon of equal damage.

What you are missing is Newton\'s third law. "To every force there is and equal
and opposite reaction." To accelerate a bullet you require a force and so there
will be an equal and opposite force on the gun. The fact the these forces
come from magnetism instead of expanding gas is irrelevant. In effect, as well
as the gun pushing out the bullet, the gun pushes itself away from the
bullet - causing a recoil.

Well, some guy named Newton once said that \'For every action there is
an equal but opposite reaction\'.  In other words, if a force is being
applied to the bullet, no matter the source of that force, there must
be another force acting against it.  You say that there is no \'pressure\'
against the breech, but the electromagnetic field produces a force to
cause the bullet to accellerate, and this field must cause an equal
but opposite force to act on the barrel.  Now, if we\'re talking \'impulse\',
well, that\'s a different story.

You may be getting confused with the similarity between the gauss gun and
the rocket launcher (or Bazooka, as I like to think of it).  A rocket
launcher is a tube open at both ends in which you place a small rocket.
The rocket accellerates without putting much recoil on the user.  Why?
Well, the rocket operates by accellerating small particles (exhaust)
in the opposite direction of it\'s direction.  An equal but opposite force
is applied to the rocket and causes it to accellerate forward.

Confusing, isn\'t it?  It\'s things like this that turns Engineering
majors into Business majors ;-).

No, I am not a Physics major, but as an Aerospace Engineer, I use that
law all the time.  So I _do_ know what I\'m talking about.  ;-)

 Subject: Quick question on Gauss weapon recoil.
 
 
 
   Just a quick question that someone better versed in physics than I can 
 answer.  Why do guass rifles/pistols have a recoil value at all?
 As I understand it, a rifle that uses gunpowder has recoil because of the
 expanding gasses pushing back against the breach of the weapon (with the
 equal but opposite force shoving the bullet down the barrel).
 
   A guass rifle works by pulling the bullet down the barrel with an
 electromagnetic field.  Thus, no pressure agains the breech.  I\'m I missing
 something really basic here?

Well Mark, what we have here is a simple case of Newton\'s second law.
The Electomagnetic force from the gun on the projectile can be see (and
is) as a force from the projectile on the gun. If you figure a 1 meter
barrel (which is actually longer than it probably is ) and the published
muzzle velocity of 1500 m/s. You can calculate the accelleration from
a=v^2/(2s) = 1.125E6 m/s^2. This is going to result in a recoil force of
F=ma where I assume the projectile is about 10 grams, making the recoil
force 1.125E4 Newtons which is the mass equivilent of 1.125 metric tons.

Quite a kick huh?

  This is going to be the case for the forseeable future, I\'m
 afraid. We need to concentrate on RCES and Regency material for a
 while. I wouldn\'t rule out the possibility of Classic Traveller
 material eventually appearing in Challenge, however, anything is
 possible.

I also see this in Challenge. Is it because GDW expect to lose interest 
in the game before they could complete the series? ;-) The aliens stuff 
is unfortunately key to this kind of game. If you started with 
Megatraveller then for a long time you were sold short in 2 key areas - 
aliens and robotics. Please don\'t do the same with TNE. Right from the 
beginnings of Traveller the demand has been for background material, 
but most of the plan in Loren\'s note says wargames, hardware and more 
wargames. Now I guess that that is what some key people in GDW enjoy 
doing and what they are best at. but don\'t lose sight of the other 
stuff.

Speaking of Challenge, I just acquired 69. I liked much of the 
Traveller material, however, some peeves:
- - continued practice of printing gushing letters that wholeheartedly 
endorse the party line. Or maybe that\'s all the letters they get.
- - about half the MT material I already paid for when I bought Survival 
Margin.
- - suddenly we are padding it with a 3 page movie review column. Why? 
Aren\'t there movie review magazines for this kind of thing? And this is 
a magazine that has gone bimonthly!

[ Matt Goldman, in response to Loren, says that most of the material to 
be published from now on will be post-virus ]
Yes, but GDW can continue to support their pre-virus customer base and 
I\'m encouraged by the TNE book itself - the subsector data includes 
both pre and post virus stats. The only place I have seen any lapse in 
this policy is in the Antares data in Challenge 69, which only provides 
Hard Times stats (hands up everyone playing Hard Times based campaigns. 
Now hands up everyone enjoying them). By the way, compare the space 
taken up by subsector data in TNE with that in Challenge.

Most background material should hopefully still include pre virus 
information as historical data. Hopefully the lesson was learnt with 
the Diaspora supplement - which, stats apart, only detailed the current 
(Hard Times) situation and provided zero real background color, and was 
as a result awful.

First, I\'d like to say I\'ve really liked reading Loren Wiseman\'s
replies to comments on the TML.  This time last year, I was feeling
quite discouraged by what seemed to be a general lack of interest
and/or antipathy on the part of GDW in what TML participants thought.
Loren\'s interest and thoughtful answers have dispelled that feeling
for the most part.  I look forward to Loren\'s and GDW\'s continued
interest in TML commentary.

Zhodani:
Mostly due to my friend, Scott "2G", I took an interest in the Zhodani
after reading parts of his _4.5th Frontier War_.  Jim Kelleher and I
have spent many pleasant hours evolving an adventure putting five of
our "Denebian" imperials from Spinward on a shared mission with a bunch
of Zhodani.  (The setting is post-Rebellion, but pre-TNE - more on this
later.)  Since we\'re both deeply into character-developement and role-
playing, we\'ve discussed at length how the neo-Regency and Zhodani cultures 
clash.  We\'ve come to a few basic conclusions, which make us happy, though 
I\'m sure other Zhodani fans may disagree.  (Feel free to disagree!  After
all, this is our version of a Traveller universe - yours has every right
to be different  :-)

I don\'t want to hog too much post-space, so I\'ll restrict my comments for
now to the Tavrchedl\': right off the bat, we decided the glottal stop after 
the "l" on the end of the word is impossible to pronounce. I myself tend to 
drop it when writing up our adventure summaries. Trivial comments aside, we 
feel that based on the write up in the old Traveller Alien Module 4, the 
Tavrchedl\' is kind of like Judge Dread. The Tavrchedl\' officer comes knocking 
on your prole\'s door in the middle of the night, and takes you away for 
adjustment, being essentially judge, jury and "executioner" (metaphorically 
speaking). <I bet the Zhodani don\'t have lawyers!  ;-)  >  To have such wide 
powers over the population, the Tavrchedl\' must be damn near omnipotent in 
Zhodani society (and if you don\'t like it, the Tavrchedl\' will come and 
"counsel" you to adopt a more healthy viewpoint...).

We\'ve also decided that individual members of the Tvarchedl\' must be
rather rightious and upstanding moral individuals, very dedicated to
insuring the health and happiness of Zhodani society.  After all,
people who need re-education are actually unwell in their
heads, and the Tavrchedl\' exists to help them get over their mental
illness.  That\'s a pretty major head trip, and most Tvarchedl\' officers 
really believe in their organization\'s mission.  Where the Tavrchedl\'
must view themselves as being the good-guys (after all, it\'s their job
to insure the health and happiness of all Zhodani society), most imperials
think of them as the thought police, who contain and oppress the Zhodani
population through thought control.  A tavrchedl\' officer 
confronted with an emotionally distraught (from the Zhodani view-point) 
imperial would probably be inclined to "help" that person into a more 
"normal" (ie, generic peaceful Zhodani) and healthy state - this sort of
interaction is ripe for misunderstanding.

An example:

	<  "I can\'t help but pick up on how violent you feel towards
            your mother-in-law.  This kind of anger and hatred toward
            a family member causes much dissention and unhappiness in
            your home - I\'m sure you have noticed it yourself," the
            tavrchedl\' officer said kindly.  "A happy home life is
            essential for your well-being.  Please, it would only take
            a day or two for me to reconcile you and your mother-in-law,
            and to adjust your home to a more harmonious state," he
            offered sincerely.

           "No!!!  I\'ve heard all about the way you use thought control
            on your own people!   I don\'t want to turn into a brainless
            automaton!  Stay away from my head, you evil brain-sucking 
            Zho!  Arhg!"   > 

Ah, character clashes - the spice of role playing...   ;->
Comments on how other people play Zhos are always appreciated.

The Rebellion
From reading the TML, I get the feeling that I must belong to an atypical
traveller group.  We\'ve been playing in the Rebellion setting in Spinward
for several years now, and enjoyed it greatly.  On the otherhand, the
people I play with seem to enjoy political intrique, societal uncertainly,
and intense role-playing - all of which fall out of the rebellion 
background.  I have noticed that the whole "hard times" flavor of the
rebellion gets editted out of our scenarios, though, and I think this is
an implicit decision on the part of the Ref and players.  Playing in
Spinward probably helps buffer the whole "hard times" schtick.  I\'m in
two campaigns right now, one set in late 1118 (for the moment) and one
that\'s run up to 1130  (which started in 1127 on Delphi, and has proceded
continuously to take the characters into Zhodani space).  Both involve
Zhodani; the latter takes a hard look at how the Denebian imperials
react to the sudden Zhodani about-face and peace overtures.

I\'ve not noticed that we have problems bringing new players into our
traveller games, even with the vast onus of traveller history and material
that\'s out there.  We have two new traveller players in a campiagn right
now.  The Ref gave them some basic ground rules, and there is occassional
coaching in background during gaming sessions, but in general it\'s never
looked like that big of a problem to me.  If you break your players in
right, they don\'t get swamped.  On the other hand, if you give them 
over fifteen years of traveller reading to do, they\'d probably go running
from your campaign screaming and never return to traveller.

Having played in previous "classic" traveller campaigns and in Rebellion
ones, I\'ve never noticed a significant difference between the two.  I
suspect, however, that the quality of the games has had a lot to do with
the quality of the refs.  I have come to the opinion that the "traveller
flavor" of the games, regardless of time-period or rules set, has far
more to do with having a good ref than it does with the imperial date
or the specific rules used.  Just an opinion, folks.

I suspect we may try out the TNE rules in the 1118 campaign sometime
soon.  As many people have already pointed out, you don\'t have to play
in the new-era to have a traveller campaign, even with the new rule set.
This post has gotten long enough!  See ya\'!

  BUREAU OF PLANETARY AFFAIRS                  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
  GALOS CITY, TUREDED (SPINWARD MARCHES 2414)

  221-1200 - A major earthquake, estimated at a Richter rating of 
  at least 8.5, has occurred along the Shugara fault on southern 
  Enlid continent.  Damage to Tobilu, the continental capital, is 
  reported to be massive, and all areas of Enlid continent have 
  experienced varying degrees of major damage.  Seismic stations 
  all over the planet have registered the quake, the strongest in 
  planetary history.  The government is moving into Enlid continent 
  to maintain order; however, the amount of damage makes it 
  necessary to ask for any and all assistance, from on or off 
  planet, that can be obtained.  An application for Regency 
  Disaster Area status is being filed with the Regency Quarantine 
  Service/Scout Service, and a Planetary Disaster Area has been 
  declared, encompassing all of Enlid continent.

  As an indication of the government\'s appreciation of any and all 
  assistance, the following measures shall apply to all ships 
  providing assistance for the duration of the emergency:

  1.  Charges for fuel will be reduced by 50%.

  2.  Berthing charges for each day after the first week will be 
  reduced 25%.  Ship crews able to document having provided direct 
  assistance (i.e., have assisted cleanup, construction, or 
  security crews) to emergency forces on Enlid continent will have 
  one day of berthing fees refunded, for each day of such 
  assistance.  Such refund will _not_ be applied to first week 
  fees, however.

  3.  Restrictions on wilderness refueling will be waived, upon 
  payment of a charge (at 50% of standard rates for unrefined fuel) 
  for an amount of fuel equal to full tankage for the vessel being 
  filled.

  4.  Inspection and clearance of inbound non-aid cargoes, and 
  all outbound cargoes, will be expedited to the best of the 
  government\'s ability.

  Please note that these measures affect only those ships which 
  provide needed assistance in response to the disaster on Enlid 
  continent.  Other ships will be subject to all normal 
  regulations.

  Minister of Planetary Affairs

Ok.

Catie compares them to Judge Dread.

Well, I don\'t know Judge Dread, however as I understand it he\'s
basically Judge, Jury and Executioner.  That is NOT the normal
Tavrchedl\'.  The usual Tavrchedl\' is not some violent nut in battle
dress on a grav bike carrying a fusion gun while his faithful
sidekick merely mans a VRF gauss gun.

No.  As Stewart said, the Zhodani aren\'t Klingons.

This is not the kind of thing that fits into the normal law
abiding, harmonious society that the Zhodani are famous for.  The
Tavrchedl\':  the "Guardians Of Our Morality" are DOCTORS.  They are
treating SICK people.  Sounds boring doesn\'t it?  Sorry.  That\'s
another thing the Zhodani society is famous for.  You see, when
society is functioning together like a harmonious whole, you don\'t
have people out there who would necessitate a Judge Dread.

Oh sure, every once in a while you may need some military muscle to
round up the Branch Dividian Cultists out on the planet Waco.  But
that will be the exception, not the rule.  The Judge Dread bit
MIGHT show up on the unabsorbed worlds in the Consulate, but I\'ve
a feeling that the Zhodani, who are supposedly the Machiavellian
Masters of Humaniti would be much more subtle than that.

[Soap Box Warning]

Lots of people think that the evil "Thought Police" are terrible
Orwellesque oppressors who will be instantly obvious to anyone who
isn\'t completely blind.  HA!  (excuse me while I laugh heartily at
you)  If the Tavrchedl\' were that obvious, well, they would KNOW
they were obvious and correct it wouldn\'t they?

How obvious are they?

Are there perhaps Tavrchedl\' in our society today?  The answer is
yes.  But who are they?  Who are the people who seek to mold us and
shape our `Morality\'?  Preachers?  Teachers?  College Professors?
Cops?  Journalists?

Consider the movement of the "Politically Correct".  THIS is my
model for the Tavrchedl\'.  After all, are not the goals of the P.C.
people and the Tavrchedl\' fairly closely in line?  I would imagine
so.  Discrimination and antipathy must be the crimes which the
ordinary citizens most often come in contact with the Tavrchedl\'.
(Actually, I imagine the Tavrchedl\' more persuasive than the PCs.
They know how to appeal to people and make their ideas sound
reasonable instead of going off the deep end, thus losing their
audience.)

Catie sites the idea of a Tavrchedl\' officer trying to clear up a
problem between someone and their mother in law.  :-)  A good
example for humor, but I think a more typical case would be along
the lines of:

"Well, Mister Radenov, I see that you are having difficulty in your
job:  you lack respect for your supervisor because she is female.
Surely, you recognize that this problem you are having has no basis
in proper thinking.  I think it would be wise if you were to agree
to come along with us so that we may sort out these feelings you
are having..."

Another thought is where the Tavrchedl\' get their name:  "Guardians
of OUR Morality".  That\'s *Zhodani* morality.  Acute difference
there.  Remember, the Zhodani, being mind readers will know all
about the human (and readable alien) psychology.  They will *know*
which thoughts and feelings are "natural".  Because of this, the
`Morality\' of the Zhodani will be Quite different from what the
"Honorable" Senator Jesse Helms considers `Morality\'.  I think the
Consulate would take extreme views on what the `Moral Majority\'
calls itself.

Now, there are quite a few sexual and societal practices which
mainstream culture defines as deviant.  Undoubtedly, the Zhos will
have some very different opinions as to what defines `deviant\'.
Especially when they have known the human psyche intimately for the
past 9000 years.  There are a great number of fantasies the human
mind entertains, but does not act upon because of societal
pressures.  When it is a known fact that everyone (or a large
percentage thereof) has such fantasies, the Consulate will define
said thing as `normal\'.

For instance, there is a much quoted (albeit highly debated)
estimate on the percentage of homosexuals in our society (10%).  If
we are to believe that this is genetic, one may expect similar
numbers in Zhodani culture.  The Zhos, if they see 10% will
undoubtedly conclude that homosexuality is indeed "natural".  As
such, homophobia will undoubtedly be seen as disease along side
misogyny, misanthropy, etc.

Bestiality (oops sorry) Zoophily will probably be acceptable to the
Zhodani.  <Which may account for the good relations the Zhos have
with the Vargr and the Droyne. |->

(BTW, there are no anonymous mail/news servers in the Consulate :-)

All in all, the Zhodani will be a lot more in touch with their
feelings, and the id of a Consulate Citizen may be indulged a bit
more than that of an Imperial Citizen.  (Making the Zhodani more
along the lines of the historical definition of an IDiot :-)

Racism may be another matter though.  After all, everyone knows
that the Zhodani are the best psionics among Humaniti, (at least
the Zhodani think so) and psionic strength is obviously the way
people are judged in the Consulate.

Now, remember, when a Consulate Citizen sees signs of what THEY
consider DISEASE, they will want to help.  It\'s rather like the
Imperial Citizen sees a person with scarlet fever.  The Imperial
Citizen (if they care at all) will want to "cure" that person by
sending them to a "Doctor".  Well, the Consulate Citizen has the
same view except the disease isn\'t fever, it\'s a phobia...  Or free
floating anxiety...  Or feelings of inadequacy...  Or deep seated
aggression...  Or dissatisfaction with the government...  These are
DISEASES.  And what is perverted about Imperial Society is that
they have *outlawed* the cure for these diseases.  The only way
that Imperial Citizens may "cure" such problems is by blind
techniques like `psychotherapy\' which compared to the Zhodani is
like a dug-out log, next to a jump-6 starship.

Yes, the Imperium has declared all the doctors are criminals and
all they have left are medicine men with their rattles, beads and
hollow drums.

I can only suppose I did not make myself clear enough.
I made the Judge Dread analogy in terms of the judicial powers
of the Tavrchedl\', and in fact attempted to clarify that this
was my metaphorical intent in the very next sentence.  I in no
way was trying to imply that the Tavrchedl\' resorted to any kind
of arbitrary violence.  I was merely trying to demonstrate how
powerful the Tavrchedl\' had to be, going by the description in
Alien Module 4.

In terms of the Tavrchedl\' being judge, jury and "executioner",
it actually demonstrates the undeniable tyranny of Zhodani society
(hence my quip about the Zhodani having no lawyers).  A person
can not appeal the judgement of the Tavrchedl\', even if the Tavrchedl\'
is wrong (and anyone can be wrong, even the Tavrchedl\' - they are
not God).  There is no justice for the common man or woman in Zhodani
society (other than the Tvarchedl\'), and there are no checks and
balances on the Tvarchedl\' itself that we know of.  Yes, it can be
argued that they are a benevolent despotism, but they are a despotism
nonetheless.

	Before I open the can of worms that is the missile debate, I may state
that I am only looking for some stats on what the standard MT starship
missiles (Standard HE, Nuclear and Antimatter (hah!!) ) do in the way of
damage points and their penetrations... 

	I avidly read all previous posts on missiles and became hopelessly lost.
There are a lot of pretty knowledgable people out there on the subject,
and I\'m afraid I\'m not one of them! :)

	In particular, the COACC booklet says that a standard starship missile
has 30 kg of "focussed High explosives". Now, what exactly is \'focussed\'
high explosive (Standard, Shaped, TDX??)? I tried working things out on
the Demolition tables and found that missiles should only penetrate (not
using the breach rules) armor values of 50 and below. This right? Hmmm.

	Further, shouldn\'t a Nuclear Warhead pretty well vaporize a ship on
contact? I mean, going by Digest number 21 in the "Pirates of Tetrini"
scenario, a 5ktn TL 12 warhead does an immense amount of damage in it\'s ground
zero. So, like, one Nuke one kill. Yeesh! Meanwhile, the damage tables just
make it look like an HE with some radiation...

(Gentle reminder to Gurus: I have never had MT combat actually work before...)

	Anyhow, enough of that. I\'d like to thank C. Harald Koch for his donation
of stellar data to me earlier this week. Very Very helpful. For that matter,
thanks to all who have steered me in the right directions.

intended since I personally consider the \'PC\' movement to be *very*
oppressive, despite their claims. I very much agree with Catie as to
her evaluation of the status of the average citizen. They are very
much subject to the whim of these , supposedly, inerrant individuals.
The fact that the Zhodani society finds the Tavrchedl\'s activities
to be "moral" is, IMO, simply put, quite relative. The only difference
I see between them & any other despotic government is that they\'ve
"got it right". How do we know this? Well, just ask them! ;*)

Seriously though, I just don\'t see how this could work w/o resorting
to the usual police-state tactics. Especially when the question of
"converting" (ie: destroying the native culture of) newly acquired worlds 
is considered. The presence of the these Thought
Police seems to me to confirm this. It\'s always nice to assume that
this society will conform to one\'s own ideas of what is good & just

 < Anybody have any suggestions as to how we should present the alien
races, and in what order?>

  Since career tables no longer take up two pages minimum by
definition, you could theoretically fit three or four races in a book
the size of the MT rulebooks (100 pages or so), and still give
them coverage equal to the Classic Traveller Alien Modules. If you
do Aliens to the old Contact! article length, such a book could
hold a dozen or more races.  What I would like to see is a combination
of the two ideas.  For example:

 Races of the Reformation Coalition, Vol 1
  Hivers (major race writeup)
  Ithklur (Contact)
  Geonee (Contact)
  Stalkers (Contact)
  Dolphins (Contact)
  several other shorts

 Races of the Spinward States, Vol 1
  Zhodani and/or Vargr (major race writeup; the other is in Vol 2)
  Addaxur (Contact)
  Darrians (length?)
  Sword Worlders (Contact)
  Llellewyloly (Contact; I\'m already working on this one, BTW)
  etc.

 Races of the Heirate
  Aslan (Major race writeup)
  Ormine (Contact)
  the race of plants from Challenge
  etc.


  Mix in Minor Human Races to taste and length.  The idea is to
minimize reprinted material in each book.  Each of the Major Races
has loads of material, some of it printed twice already.  By putting
only one major race in each book, but filling out the book with
local minor races (some of which would be brand new, some so old
only us black box Traveller players remember them), the MT complaints
about "having to buy it all over again" are spread much thinner.
By adding new material to the reprinted stuff (or replacing it
entirely; not easy) the complaints are reduced even more.  By
providing "how to play" tips and TNE careers for the various minor
races, each book does volumes for the "feel" of Traveller.

  The order of presentation only matters in one instance.  The Hivers
are very important to RCES play, and the only material on them is
years old.  For importance to their setting, no other race comes
close (the Aslan, Vargr, and Zhodani are all in a tie for second, IMO).
The minor races for each setting range from "local color" to "PC"
depending on the individual campaign and the race (not all are suited
to PC play), but are important for all that.

  Lastly, one race, the Chirpers, need their own section seperate from
the Droyne entry.  Each Chirper colony is different from all others and
different from the Droyne.  They deserve their own section.

    'body' => 'In response to Catie Helm\'s post on Zhodani, some thoughts of my own:

  The Tavrchedl\' (TAH-ver-Chedd-ul) certainly come off as almost superhuman
in their ideals, but no such organization can stay at such levels for
long, and in such large numbers.  I see the community monitors as a
type of "beat cop", who must balance public well-being with the local
resources of their organization.  Sometimes there can be no balance, and
a society tips over into chaos (in Zhodani terms, anyway).
  Where does this idea come from?  The old Zhodani module contains rules
for generating Consular space, and a classification similar to the
TAS Amber Zone:  Unabsorbed.  This classification is based on Port
type (C, D, E) and a die roll (11+).  This applies anywhere in Zhodani
space, regardless of proximity to Zhdant.  This tells me that, despite
6600 years of Jump Drive and an uninterupted span of government and
culture, the Zhodani still have problems they cannot solve, despite
continued attempts (The "Unabsorbed" classification implies that the
Tavrchedl\' are in place and working towards cultural unity).

  Once you get under the psionic layers of insulation, the average
citizen of the Consulate is nearly identical to the average Imperial
citizen.  There are two main differences:  A Consulate Prole has
no self-oriented goals which include social climbing.  These are all
oriented on his children, instead.  In addition, all proles have that
wonderful feeling of security that a good medical insurance plan gives
you today.  This feeling comes from knowing that the "Guardians of Our
Morality," the Tavrchedl\', are watching.

  Another role I tend to assign to the Tavrchedl\' is that of facilitator.
The Guardians\' role is that of "keeping the proles happy".  The printed
material tells us that this involves "adjusting" an unhappy
individual until he is happy again.  This normally involves psionic
or psychological methods.  I prefer to extend this to other forms
of adjustment as well.  If a prole is not happy in his current
circumstances, despite attempts to make him so, the Tavrchedl\' will
determine where he is best suited to be, and make sure he gets there.
SORAG has obtained quite a few crack operatives through this method over
the centuries, as have the Guard and the Core Expeditions.
  This is not to say that such changes of career cannot be done alone,
just that those who want such a change, but don\'t know it, can count
on the Tavrchedl\' for help.

  With the New Era, and growing social contact between the Consulate
and the Regency, encounters such as Catie describes will be more
common, but not too common.  The attitude taken by the Zhodani in
the example is typical only of the more people-oriented nobility,
and the civilian Tavrchedl\' (The old Zhodani module didn\'t give
Proles the Psychology skill).  And any Zhodani who made such an offer
without having met (and scanned) the mother-in-law in question, is
asking for a diplomatic incident.

  I usually interpret the Zhodani glottal stop as a "hard pause".
Words that end with it do not blend into the following word, but
have a very distinct stop.  Words with a stop in the middle will
tend to sound like two words.


 Catie says:
 <I have noticed that the whole "hard times" flavor of the
rebellion gets editted out of our scenarios, though, and I think this is
an implicit decision on the part of the Ref and players.  Playing in
Spinward probably helps buffer the whole "hard times" schtick.>

  Before I say more, I should state that I am one of the players in
the 1118 game that Catie mentioned.  As this is not a Hard Times era
game, I cannot comment on this part of Catie\'s post.  I ran a Hard
Times game briefly last year, however, and found no shortage of ways
to make the era clear during play.  The game was placed in Welling
Subsector (Lishun N), and was much more in the heart of Hard Times.
The Marches never felt the Times, and are thus a poor place for a
"Hard Times" campaign.

 Catie says:
 <I\'ve not noticed that we have problems bringing new players into our
traveller games, even with the vast onus of traveller history and material
that\'s out there.>

  In the case of the 1118 campaign, this is due to having lots of 
open-minded gamers for friends, and because the group is a melding
of two older Traveller groups.  Recruiting brand new players is not
nearly so simple.  Hopefully TNE will change this.

 Catie opines:
 <I suspect, however, that the quality of the games has had a lot to do
with the quality of the refs.  I have come to the opinion that the
"traveller flavor" of the games, regardless of time-period or rules set,
has far more to do with having a good ref than it does with the imperial
date or the specific rules used.>

  In the current role-playing environment, you dare not ignore your

 On GDW, Catie says:
 <This time last year, I was feeling quite discouraged by what seemed
to be a general lack of interest and/or antipathy on the part of GDW
in what TML participants thought.>

  Lest we forget, GDW seemed to be ignoring _everybody_, not just the
TML.  Last summer was the hectic time surrounding the release of
Dangerous Journeys.  Whatever you think about that game (I DON\'T want
to hear about it here, thank you) it tied up GDW\'s resources and
attention completely during that time (as TNE is doing now).

Most Imperial citizens feel the same way, which is why there have been
five Frontier Wars! ;-)

Which reminds me of another gripe I have about the MT/TNE background.
Apparently Deneb is safe from Zhodani invasion because the Zhodani no
longer consider them a threat.  Now, maybe I\'ve got my history wrong,
but I thought there had been five Frontier Wars and the Zhodani started
all five of them.  Who\'s threatening whom?  Besides, if I were Supreme
Zhodani, or whatever title is used, I\'d consider the fact that some time
in the future the Imperium is bound to re-form, and remove the "threat"
from Deneb while it is easy to do so.

Well it *seems* to that it takes the place of a legal system &

Well I\'m sorry but I must disagree. They can consider themselves

Once again similarities to the former USSR\'s psych. hospitals abounds.

In sum I feel that the potential for abuse in this sort of system
is enormous. I have always been surprised the GDW itself always
maintained that the Zhodani were really quite benevolent when
they seemed to take such pains setting their society up as a car-
bon-copy of the USSR. Especially now that so much more info is avail.

I guess we\'ll just have to agree to disagree?

GDW has *always* been very solicitious towards the Zhodani. Almost
apologetic. The Imperium, especially after the Civil Wars, was never
any real threat to Zhodane, except that it showed that another form
of human society could be successful. Once again the allegory to the
former USSR is apparent. It was the Imperium\'s fault for "provoking"
them. My opinion is that the Zhodani attacked because it\'s the nature
of such forms of gov. to do so. Nothing is perceived as a greater threat
than an alternative form of gov. Especially one that ,like the Imperium,
tolerated a diversity of cultures instead of imposing the "One True Faith"
(tm), or ,at least, attempting to do so.  In effect it was the mere exis-
tance of the Imperium that threatened them. Now, or so the theory goes, 
that there is no Imperium, the threat is gone. I think a far more likely 
responce would be that the Zhodani would, at the very least, "Finlandize"
the Regency. I didn\'t like much about MT but I think the idea that the
Zhodani Core Expeditions had stirred up so many problems for them that
they didn\'t have any effort to spare was alot more plausible than the
TNE \'line\'. Too bad there wasn\'t enough time to develop it. Just another 
of the casualties of the "New Order", I guess.

Subj:	Zhodani: Wars and Thought Police

I\'ve been trying to figure out the Frontier Wars myself, and they don\'t make
a whole lot of sense.  What do the Zhodani hope to gain?  Telling the
Imperium "back off or else" doesn\'t really cut it, IMO.  Surely they could
work it out in some other way?  
They can\'t hope to defeat the (larger, more advanced) Imperium, not even by
taking the entire Spinward Marches (this "thrust at Rhylanor" bit is a little
wacko) given Imperial reinforcement and industrial capability, and technical
advantages.  Hence they must have some limited objectives, which are -- what?

(Primarily I\'m talking about the Fifth Frontier War; there\'s not enough 
evidence for me to speculate about the others.  The Second (strike while the
Imperium convulses in civil war) makes the most sense to me, but not the
first -- and with the Sword Worlds as allies?  A single Imperial battle
squadron will rip their fleets to shreds -- TL11-12 vs TL15!)).  What were
the Zhodani trying to do in the Fifth Frontier War???

As for why they don\'t attack again -- well, my guess is that they\'re simply
not capable of absorbing the trillion+ Imperials in the Spinward Marches; it
would be far too difficult to assimilate and re-educate all of them.


Getting back to the Thought Police -- hmmm... Think Deanna Troi with a lot of
reinforcement back-up.  ("You NEED help.  We/I WILL give it to you.")
I\'m still trying to figure out how you combine a conformist society with
ambition, but maybe I just can\'t figure out the Zhodani.

Oh well, enough for now.

Did the Zhodani start all five of them?  Looks like a clear case to me of
us only getting one side of the story.  This could well be a situation
much like WWII in the Pacific where the Japanese were forced to act or
become helpless (n.b. the U.S., U.K., and Dutch oil embargo was causing
exhaustion of Japan\'s oil reserve and the Japanese either needed to act or
do what they were told since once the reserve was gone Japan could not
have waged war).  Perhaps there were numerous aggesive raids (not reported
by the TNS inside the Imperium) on Zhodani territory that forced the
Zhodani to finally act to supress them.  These were then trumped up to a
start a War.  With the Imperial population\'s views on Psi it wouldn\'t be
hard to take even minor acts by individual Zhodani or blunders by
Imperial officers (explained as Zhodani intervention) and turn them into a
war.

I can\'t speak for you guys, but in my neck of the woods, the
"PC oppressiveness" problem doesn\'t come from the "euphamism-
of-th-week" bunch but from the hard consrvative types who
label anything to the left of themselves as PC and generally
use the word as a verbal bludgeon.

There\'s more "correctness" out there than just the "PC" variety.



Anyway, back to Traveller:

Allegedly the Zho\'s started the Fronteir Wars as sort of
preemptive strikes, to keep the Impies at a safe distance.

You seem to be missing the interesting point about the Zhodani by a large
margin. They are not (necessarily) a carbon copy of the USSR because,
thanks to their psionic abilities, they really may be so benevolent.
Remember, both Heaven and Hell are dictatorships. The reason why
dictatorships tend to be iffy propositions on Earth is that its difficult
to find a dictator with the right attitude. It\'s even worse finding a
good successor. But with mind reading you can _know_ if the man you
select has what it takes. 

Wether the Zhodani\'s have actually used their abilities to set up a
self-regulating machinery to keep the Tavrchedl\' honest is up to the
individual Referee, because the noise they would make would be the
same in any case. But the beauty of the situation is that if the 
set-up is good then it will most propably stay good (and if it\'s bad
it\'ll stay bad, of course).

What was percieved as a threat was that the Imperium started pushing into
Foreven Sector a few hundred years after arriving in the Spinward Marches
while the Zhodani had spent a millenium trying to digest what they had
already spread over. They foresaw that when they again wanted to expand,
the Imperium would\'ve grown to surround them.

(And the Zhodani still haven\'t integrated everybody in their area even 
two millenia. It\'s my belief that they must have some major troubles with
unreconstructed planets).

  You missed my (probably obscure) point.  The Tavrchedl\' OPERATE a
bit like beat cops.  They get out and walk (or drive) the
neighborhoods, mentally looking for "trouble".  To borrow from your post,
they are a prowling ambulance crew, hunting for people to save.
  They must do this to some extent, since sitting at the Morality Ward
in the center of town and scanning everyone will not produce very
accurate results ("I\'ve got a five person headache.  Two in that
direction, three over there."). While such a system is good for a start,
you will need the street crews to pinpoint the troubled folks ANYWAY,
so why not make them standard.
 
 <Catie says that under the Zhodani system there are no judges, no
juries, no lawyers, no trials, and no appeals.  This is true.>
  Actually, its not.  When it comes to LEGAL questions, any telepathic
Noble can (and usually will) function as Judge and Jury.  Trials
(supposedly) discover the truth of a legal matter, but a telepath
can do this for himself.  The only appeals in Zhodani society are
for "grey crimes", which have no clear method of resolution.  In these
cases you may get several Nobility (how ever many are available)
putting their heads together and producing a common solution.
  This primarily deals with Proles however.  But we were talking about
medical matters, not legal ones...
 
 <The Re-education centers are not prisons, they are *Hospitals*.>
  Thus my point about "really good medical insurance".
 
 <...I must point out that Hospitals rarely have only one doctor.>
  Quite true.  There will also be a greater sense of cooperation between
therapy teams than we find these days.  Among other reasons, the
Tavrchedl\' don\'t have "the BILL" hanging over their heads as an excuse
to not cooperate.  They help the people, and their salaries are
guaranteed (and probably high; talk about a stress job).
 
  As far as what is considered "Normal" is Zhodani society, I notice
that Brawling skill is quite common on the Prole charts (in the old
Zho Module).  I suspect that a little drunken pugilism is good for
the soul, and the Guardians know it.

  The Imperium has never gotten very far on armed conquest.  Imperials
prefer to settle an area beyond the border then move the border.  The
Frontier Wars were the Zhodani way of controlling this urge among the
Imperials.  Each Frontier War stated in subconcious terms: "We will
not let the Imperium surround us, so it had best not try."  Taken at
the conscious level, this message is not really apparent, producing
a queasy sense of curiousity and paranoia among the Denebian leadership:
"Why aren\'t they attacking us? We are weak."  The Zhodani answer is:
"If you are weak, you will not expand.  We do not need to remind you
of our resolve if you do not have the resources to test it."
 
 And so it goes...

Wars were really over territory, from the impression I get while reading

    'index' => 'ak354',
    'month' => '08',
    'body' => '
Let me start off with a few questions to GDW.

1.  Do you have the future history of TNE universe mapped out for the next
    50-200 years?  eg are you running a REAL game now played at the 
    political/military level that encompasses all the major players in the
    TNE universe and that is creating the future TNE history or are you just
    making it up as you go.

2.  Do you have specific psychological models for the currently unpublished
    alien societies?  ie how individuals in the societies behave to each other
    and to outsiders; how the government and traders relate to external
    groups, empires, consortiums, etc.

3.  Have you justified logicly to youselves the various social and military
    interactions of the various alien societies in your universe.  Why 5 wars
    with the Zhodani and now suddenly peace?  Why hasn\'t the Imperium trashed
    the SWORD WORLDS and gotten rid of that annoying group.  

4.  Are we (the GMs and players of TNE) being treated as if we were simply
    moving through a planned TNE timeline and we\'re only being fed information
    like "this is the news today" and that\'s really all we should know.  If this
    is the case then give us some more news!

5.  Are there groups around the world who are privy to the details of the
    TNE future history and possibly helping to design it.

6.  What\'s on the otherside of the empires surrounding the Imperium?  Have you
    mapped these regions out?  In great detail or just \'other empire\' borders
    or is it unplayable so it\'s treated as not being there?

7.  While I\'m not keen on rolling lots of dice in combat I find the armour
    penetration rules a bit too black and white.  Oh you\'ve got that gun and 
    I\'ve got this armour so you can\'t hurt me.  In a lot of cases I would like
    to do away with the straight subtraction of damage dice and simply roll
    them all and have the defender roll what dice would have been subtracted
    and then subtract the two sums.  There are cases where you will inflict
    damage where previously it was impossible.  How do you feel about this
    variation?

8.  I find it very difficult to get exceptional successes with most average 
    characters unless they are \'super\' at a skill and the 10 point range is
    a very large single step.  Have you looked at 5 point steps with 5-9
    giving a 1 point defenders armour reduction, 10-14 giving the 5-9 bonus
    plus double damage, 15-19 giving the double damage bonus plus a 2 point 
    reduction in the defenders armour rating?

9.  The fact that TNE combat does very little damage can mean that combats
    run on for long periods.  In the case of the head and chest rule
    of saving throws for death by NPCs it goes to the other extreme with
    one shot kills for NPCs but players dragging on until all their blood
    has drained away.  There must be some middle ground where realism can
    at least share the lime light with playability.  What combat mods are
    people implementing along these lines?

10. We converted our characters to TNE and found the \'feel\' of the game to
    have been totally changed.  Preferred weapons now don\'t penetrate and
    don\'t have anywhere near the knock down ability they had before.  To
    fix the laser weapon fall from grace our GM simply added "1-" to them
    and the universe has shifted part way back again.  There seems to be a
    number of misprints in the weapons tables  .... do you have an errata
    for them yet?

11. The move to T:2000 in-house game system is a good rationalisation for
    GDW but I feel that the equipment stats for HIGHER TECH equipment
    has been fudged rather badly.  Sure, if I have a TL-10 pistol and
    we upgrade it to TL-12 we don\'t JUST want a copy made.  What you need
    is a branching of capabilities not a straight line "this is now this".
    The TL-12 pistol would have several variants.  One identical to the
    original for direct sale to TL-10 worlds at cheaper than TL-10 can
    produce it, one with better range but with less penetration, one with 
    better penetration but with less range, one with better penetration at
    close range but worse penetration at longer ranges but still has the
    longer range ability.  There doesn\'t appear to be enough variation
    for players to role play around ... "Damn he\'s just out of range, should
    have bought the other model gun" OR "I always carry two pistols, one
    for close in people stopping and one for long range".  Do you have plans 
    for some trade manuals so we can "go shopping"?  It would be nice to front
    up at a shop and have the GM say "Some binoculars?  Oh well if you look on
    page 24 you find variants 1-5 and 11 which are available over the
    counter and he can order in variants 19-24 in 2 weeks or a 25 will take
    a month.  What would you like?".  Look around today, want to buy a TV; how
    many variants can you get?  Some variety please.

 
Just some thoughts...


How about the rest of the TMLers ... comments please.

 ...Well, to throw my Cr0.02 into the fray:  I think that, clearly, the
Taverchedl\' are *not* a police force in organization or perceived function.

According to the Zhodani alien book, your typical Zhodani-on-the-street
considers the Taverchedl\' to be analogous to Firemen, not policemen...
Personally, I think that the medical analogy is somewhat more apt...At
any rate, they exist not to enforce laws or hunt down criminals, but to
keep people interacting with one another in an harmonious fashion.  What
exactly defines \'harmonious\' is, of course, where the potential for
Draconian Thought Police enters into the picture :).  However, on the
whole, the picture presented to us by the Alien module is one of
*alienness*, not *evilness*.

The Zhodani have a system which protects the mental well being of its
citizens in a manner unlike any possible in a society of nontelepaths.
They also conduct mental engineering on a large scale, examining,
telepathically, most, if not all, of their populace and placing them
carefully into society where they fit the best.  The Taverchedl\' "keep
the pulse" and make sure that none of the "parts" are getting worn, and
if they are they conduct maintanence and, if necessary, put the part
somewhere that it fits better.

I think GDW\'s attitude about the Zhodani is pretty easily explained:
the above system, although ripe for misuse, is not inherently bad.  It\'s
possible that it could exist and the exact right mix of people could be
involved so that it *wasn\'t* an oppressive system.  It\'s alien and shaky
to us, but it\'s not necessarily going to be evil and tyrranical.
<Shrug>  The "unabsorbed" worlds may also be interpreted as those which
haven\'t *voluntarily* accepted the Zhodani way.  After all, it wouldn\'t
be nice to force it on people if they didn\'t want it.  The Zhodani are
many things, but I\'ve never seen them as being especially preachy
<shrug>.

On the topic of the Interstellar Wars:  I\'ve always thought they were a
sort of big Psychohistorical Experiment used to keep the Imperium from
overrunning them.  By carefully selecting where and when they struck
they were able to build up a particular sort of detent <sp?> which
didn\'t really destabilize either the Imperium or the Zhos...<Speaking of
Psychohistory, I think the Rebellion was the result of Hiver
manipulation...After all, they\'re obviously trying to re-engineer things
more to their liking with the RCES, eh?>

    'body' => '  I\'m starting to get back into Traveller/MegaTraveller/Traveller:
  The New Era, and I decided that I need to get a good set of ship
  plans.  I\'ve purchased MegaSets 1 and 2 from Seeker, and I have a
  couple of duplicates.  I\'m looking for ship plans, from whatever
  source, for ships whose plans I don\'t have.  Originals or easily
  readable copies are fine; I\'m willing to trade copies of what I
  have, or the duplicates.

  In the list below, names in parens indicate the source of the
  plans.  The notation [C] indicates that the originals are in
  multiple colors.  * before the name means that I have duplicate
  copies of this ship, and am willing to trade the originals.

  If you\'re interested, make me an offer by _private_mail_.  State
  what you\'re offering, and what you\'re interested in.  I won\'t let
  the duplicate originals go for less than three ships that I don\'t
  already have.

  Terms of trades:  If I accept your offer, send me your plans, and
  a self-addressed 9inch x 12 inch envelope (not stamped; you pay
  postage to me, I\'ll pay it to you).  I\'ll send back the copies of
  the plans we agreed on, or the originals for the duplicates if
  that was the agreement.  I\'ll acknowledge receipt via email, and
  let you know when I\'ve place your copies into the mail.

  What I have to trade:

  Cutter/Ship\'s Boat/Launch/Pinnace/Fast Shuttle (MegaSet 1)
  Adm Bertil/Vigilante Class Mercenary Cruiser   (Assignment: Vigilante)[C]

  Notes:

  The ships whose sources are MegaSet 1 or 2 are in 25mm scale;
  others are in other scales, not the same, and not suitable for
  miniatures.

  Names separated by slashes (/) are discrete ships that appear in
  the same plans.  They travel as a set; I\'m not willing to sort
  through and copy only some of the sheets.

  The Beowulf and Gimu Far Traders are interchangeable.  There may
  be some minor differences (I didn\'t spot any obvious ones; I also
  didn\'t do a detailed inspection).

  The Vigilante can be used as a Subsidized Liner; if you\'re
  interested, I\'ll include my notes on the immediately obvious
  differences.

  I\'m _primarily_ interested in non-military ships; my campaigns
  don\'t generally involve formal military action.  Non-Imperial
  ships are also highly desirable.  Don\'t take this to mean that I
  won\'t consider Imperial or military ships; I will.  You just
  won\'t see me as flexible in my offers for Imperial and military
  ships.

  If you\'ve done up your own plans for _any_ type of ship,
  _neatly_, and on graph paper (no smaller than 6mm scale), I\'m
  willing to consider them.

  I\'ll post updates to this list as needed; anything I receive will
  be considered available for trades.  I also haven\'t gone through
  _all_ my Traveller stuff; I may come across additional plans.  I
  doubt it, though; most of what I haven\'t gone through is Classic
  Traveller stuff and Challenge Magazines.

  Please don\'t try to foist off your own slightly modified copies
  of standard ships in my list; I _will_ check against what I have,
  and if you\'ve simply "redecorated" a standard, you\'ll have wasted
  postage to me.

Seems Phil took exception to what I wrote about the Zhodani
Tavrchedl\' being a medical organization rather than a police force.
Well, son, you will have to admit that the first words out of my
terminal were:

}Speaking strictly from the Zhodani point of view:

I was doing just that, you see.

The Zhodani do not see the Tavrchedl\' as a police force.  They seem
them as a MEDICAL organization.  I was writing to tell you how the
Zhodani view themselves.  Which is, of course, how one should
*Role Play* them.  And that is what this GAME is about.

That the organization might lead to abuse as similar systems did in
the F-USSR has no bearing on how the Zhodani view it.  I personally
doubt that it would collapse given the differences there are
between Russian and Zhodani cultures.

How the organization is viewed by the Imperium is so well known I
don\'t even have to bother writing about the `Evil Empire\'s Thought
Police\' (tm).  What would be the point?  I\'d guess 99% of the
people here have either read 1984 or know enough about it to be
completely bored by the mention of it.

The Challenge we have here is to describe the organization of the
Tavrchedl\' in such a way that it fits with the ideas we know of the
Zhodani culture.  If the Zhodani viewed their own Tavrchedl\' as
evil thought police, their society would not have lasted 9000 years
without revolution!

    'body' => 'Greetings y\'all,

All the talk on the Zhodani reasons for war made me dig up the
4.5th Frontier War.  I haven\'t worked on it in a while, but I
thought you wouldn\'t mind a preview of the next chapter.  The
following is from what amounts to one of the story\'s philosophical
climaxes.

As those who have read before know, our hero (one of them) Dr. Mako
Malenkoviepr a Zhodani noble was captured and is being interrogated
by some powerful psionics.  Well, he finally does get to meet up
with his captor, Colonel Baremkatalasche\' the ex-head of SORAG.
Which is the Zhodani Military Intelligence.

Now there\'s an interesting thought:  We always hear about the
Tavrchedl\', but rarely do we hear of SORAG.  Kinda like the fact
that we hear a lot about the old Soviet KGB, but not much about the
Soviet GRU.  :-)

Anyway, the following is an excerpt from The 4.5th Frontier War by
Scott Kellogg copyright 1993.

BTW, Loren?  Is GDW interested in people writing novels or short
stories for TNE?  I\'ve kinda been realizing that the 4.5th War
could be re-written as the 5.5th Frontier War in the New Era.

                              * * *

Red was the color of his blood flowing thin
Pallid white was the color of his lifeless skin
Blue was the color of the morning sky
He saw looking up from the ground where he died
It was the last thing ever seen by him

Black and white were the figures that recorded him
Black and white was the newsprint he was mentioned in
Black and white was the question that so bothered him
He never asked, he was taught not to ask
But was on his lips as they buried him
               -- Requiem for the Masses:  The Association

     "When you retired from SORAG, Doctor, you said it was because
you felt your science was being misused."
     Malenkoviepr tensed.  His own logic was about to be used
against him.  He sat in silence.
     Baremkatalashe\' continued.  "You said you did not like the way
SORAG used people.  Manipulating people to follow their rule."
     Anger welled up in Mako, "Just as you have been trying to
manipulate me?"
     "How would you feel about the manipulation of our entire
culture?  Twisting the Consulate with a horrible deception."
     Mako\'s lips curled in disgust, "Oh, your next ambition I take
it..."
     Baremkatalashe\' held his head high, "No." he paused for
breath.  "I intend to Stop the manipulation, and I need your help."
     Mako sneered.  "Oh and just what is this monstrous plot you
intend to save us all from?"
     Baremkatalashe\' nodded, "Doctor, what shape do you think the
Consulate is in?"
     Malenkoviepr ignored the question, refusing to get into a
conversation.
     Baremkatalashe\' waited for a moment before continuing on his
own.  "The Consulate is strong:  socially, economically,
militarily.  The people are content, and well guided.  The
government has ruled well over them for three thousand four hundred
and seven olympiads.
     "The Imperium by contrast is also strong:  economically, and
militarily, but not socially.  They are still buried under their
deceitful ways, and hammered in by the fear of the one tool
necessary to give them the same social stability of our culture:
psionics."
     Malenkoviepr grudgingly nodded.  Some of what Baremkatalashe\'
said was true.
     "All right, Doctor," continued the Colonel, "you are an
historian, what is the conflict between the Consulate and the
Imperium?"
     Mako looked at him, he wasn\'t sure where this would lead.  "Do
you mean our current conflicts or the historical ones?"
     Baremkatalashe\' opened his hand, letting Mako choose his own
battlefield.
     Malenkoviepr fell into his professorial voice for delivering
lectures, "The original conflict started about two hundred
Olympiads ago as a territorial dispute.  The Imperium was expanding
too fast into Tloql sector and began to compete with our trade and
harrass our allies in the area.  Pressure built up and we attacked
before they could hem us off from the area.
     "The Second War of Imperial Expansion was really an extension
of the first.  The Imperials were weakened during a period of civil
war and our fleets made moves to continue the work of the First
War.  The root motivations for the fighting were mostly economic
and clashes of different culture and governments.
     "The Holocost changed all that.  The Imperials were initially
reluctant to accept Zhodani use of psionics.  This reluctance
suddenly inflamed to pathological phobia.  The Imperials first
declared that no psionic activity would be tolerated, then they
began rounding up and slaughtering all psionic adepts.
     "What were political and economic struggles became a fight for
survival with each government swearing to annihiliate each other.
The continued fighting of the following Wars of Imperial Expansion
was orders of magnatude more bitter while the Imperials tried to
tear apart the fabric that holds our people together and we fought
not only to save ourselves, but to bring freedom of psionics to the
struggling peoples of the Imperium.
     "The Third War of Imperial Expansion came at another time of
Imperial weakness:  the Imperium was having difficulty on their
coreward side in their attempt to subjugate the Solomani.  The
Consulate took advantage of their weakened fleet strengths and
pushed them farther back from our space.
     "The Fourth War of Imperial Expansion started too early.
Because of losses in intelligence, The Imperials learned of the
coming attack and the fighting started before all the fleets were
in readiness.  As a result, the fleets of both sides were almost
thrown together with no plan or strategy.  Fleets were attrited
before any significant gains could be made, save the foothold on
Esalin.
     Baremkatalasche\' nodded, "Yes, Doctor those are the textbook
reasons."  He paused for a moment, gathering his thoughts, "Those
are the causes that are taught to us.  However, I have known the
Supreme Council.  I know something more of the motivations behind
those causes.
     The Colonel spoke with a disgust that seemed old, but not
faded with time, "I can tell you now that the Supreme Council has
no intention of bringing freedom of psionics or of any other kind
to the people of the Imperium.  The Council merely wants to
maintain the status quo.  They make broad sweeping policy
statements about waging a war for democracy, and making the galaxy
safe for psionics, but that is mere propaganda.  Their real
position is that the Imperium is unabsorbable and must be held off
indefinitely.  And in a thousand Olympiads or so, it will be
someone elses problem to deal with because they will be out of
office."
     Baremkatalashche\' scowled darkly, "They\'re afraid Really
trying to absorb the Imperium would cost them their elections.  So
instead they make minor skirmishes against the Imperium to drum up
support for their elections.  Whenever there\'s trouble, they send
the Guards to some troubled planet to divert the headlines.  But to
start a War really gets the populus distracted, and is a sure way
to win an election when your opponent looks good."
     Malenkoviepr rolled his eyes, "I\'ve heard that argument from
every tenth college sophomore.  It..."
     "It\'s true." Baremkatalashe\' spoke with finality.  "I\'ve been
in on the planning for the next campaign against the Imperium.
They make no plans for absorbing of Imperial planets into the
Consulate.  And the `losses in intelligence\' that caused the fiasco
of the Fourth War?  Those were leaks.  Deliberate leaks.  The war
was meant to fail.  We stirred up that nest of Stingers and fought
like nightmares *intentionally*.  To show the Imperium that they
could not absorb US!
     The Colonel relaxed somewhat, "There was no intention of ever
freeing or helping the psionic adepts under Imperial yoke.  None at
all.  That\'s all just a publicity stunt."
     "If we really meant to save our cousins in the Imperium we
would have done a lot more than made inroads to a mere three
subsectors.  We have almost all the advantage.  Economically, we
are in the same shape.  They have a slight advantage in terms of
technology, but no psionic forces worth speaking of.  And each time
war started, it has been on our terms.  We struck simultaneously
across the front and behind it while they had to react with no
warning.  We could have driven them out of Tloql and Nieklsdia
altogether if we really wanted to.  The Supreme Council will not
commit enough to insure victory, but only enough to scare the
Imperials.  They think that if they just sit back and make
occasional strikes, the Imperium will leave the Consulate alone."
     Baremkatalasche\' leaned forward, "Have you ever seen the full
extent of the Imperial madness?  You were right to call it a
pathological phobia.  How many millions of psionic adepts have been
blindly massacred by the mob rule there?  The very people they need
to keep their society peaceful, they shoot down in the streets."
     Baremkatalasche\' jerked his thumb back toward himself, "I was
head of SORAG for years.  I sent men and women into the Imperium.
They didn\'t always come back alive."  He gripped the table and
closed his eyes for a moment.  "Raped...  Murdered...  Sometimes,
they would come back with their minds destroyed...  lobotomized...
tortured...  mutilated...  arms hacked off...  legs chopped off...
ears...  genitalia...  because the Imperials said psionics could
grow new ones...  Once we got an agent back piece by piece...  The
last thing we got was her brain..."
     Malenkoviepr\'s stomach felt weak.
     Baremkatalasche\'s eyes were afire.
     The SORAG Colonel took a deep breath.  "We are going to change
all that."
     Malenkoviepr\'s psi-shield covered his revulsion.
     Baremkatalasche\' raised his hand and it clenched into a fist,
"For centuries the Supreme Council have been preaching how we must
make the galaxy safe for psionics.  They do not want to.  Millions
of Zhodani have died trying to free those people from Imperial
domination.  They died for something they believed in.  The Supreme
Council does not believe.  They *Lied* to the Consulate.  They
Lied.  They *LIED* to us.  All those people:  they all died for
*NOTHING*."
     Baremkatalasche\'s voice rang with sarcasm.  "They have said
\'Absorbing those worlds would cost too much...\'  It will cost us
more dearly in sons and daughters *NOT* to absorb them.  We must
Crush the Imperium before the Supreme Council turns us all into
liars worse than the Imperials!"
     Malenkoviepr felt his stomach churn.  "I do not believe you."
     Baremkatalasche\' nodded sadly.  "I am not surprised.  The
Supreme Council has covered their steps very well.  They do not
want the people to believe it."
     Malenkoviepr eyed Baremkatalasche\'s face closely.  "You really
believe that is true."
     "Doctor," sighed Baremkatalasche\', "I\'ve seen it.  I *know* it
is true."
     The two Citizens stared at each other.
     Silence rang over the room.
     Malenkoviepr leaned forward "Give me your thoughts."
     The colonel eyed the doctor askance.
     Malenkoviepr spread his hands.  "If you believe what you say
is true, then prove it to me."  He looked the colonel in the eye
and repeated his demand, "Give me your thoughts."
     Baremkatalasche\' hesitated a moment and then nodded.
     Malenkoviepr stood and approached the colonel.  For the first
time in months Mako willingly dropped his psionic shield.  The
colonel felt a soft touch on his head as Malenkoviepr stretched his
thoughts out into the world.
     A camera focused on the room would have seen nothing but two
men staring at each other.
     What Mako saw was different.  A swirling, shadowy cloak of
electric blue surrounded them.  It blotted out the universe as the
white tendrils of the doctor\'s mind reached out for the colonel.
Like a writhing mass of feathery snakes, the tendrils quickly
attached themselves to the colonel\'s brain cocooning the mind,
imprisoning the thoughts within.  Mako then began to slowly open
the colonel\'s mind up under the light of the search.
     Thoughts flashed through the air.  Pictures.  Sounds.  Words.
Feelings.  Thoughts arched between them like lightning strokes that
left burning afterimages in Mako\'s brain.
     Confusion swept over the doctor\'s probings.  Something was odd
here.  That couldn\'t be the truth...
     Mako was careful.  Baremkatalasche\' was as strong a telepath
as any.  Someone in his class could decieve a probing.  He had to
be sure.
     He painstakingly combed through the colonel\'s mind searching
for mistakes, something he\'d missed, some sign of deception...

     Subjective hours later, Baremkatalasche\' eyed Mako, who was
deep in thought.
     "You believe me now."  It was not a question.
     Malenkoviepr took a deep breath and let it out.  "Yes."  He
pursed his lips, "What you told me is what you believe.  It may
indeed be true."
     Mako turned away.
     "I need to think."

space & just sum up my thoughts;


A number of you, speaking form the Zhodani point of view, have made
some very persuasive arguments. I, of course, was speaking from the
Imperial view. I believe that what GDW has done here is tap into the
"Utopian Ideal" that\'s been around for as long as I can remember. This
idea, creating the "perfect" society was especially popular in the late
\'60s thru the 70\'s. As witnessed by the numerous "alternative lifestyles"
that many people \'experimented\' with. The creation of Traveller towards 
the end of this era no doubt had an influence, IMO. The dream of the 
ideal society where all one\'s needs & wants will be, at the very least, 
seriously considered is a very powerful lure. In my case, I find that 
it\'s very, very difficult for me to accept that this is possible, psionics 
or not. I find that I just can\'t believe that a monolithic society, of 
any sort, could be preferable to a diverse one. Therefore I don\'t think 
it\'s too surprising that I treat the benevolent assessments of Zhodani 
rule as basic propaganda. Just because they\'re psionic doesn\'t mean that 
they\'re not capable of just as much treachery & deceit as anyone else. 
Maybe even more so, IMO. (I think the 4.5th Frontier War series illustrates 
this quite well, BTW) In short, the Zhodani system just sounds too good 
to be true.   

Phil Pugliese
(unreconstructed Imperial)

p.s. As a final example, just suppose the Zhodani decided that the only
thing "normal" about something, take homosexuality for example, was that
it\'s "normal" to have a certain amount of "abnormal" people crop up in
the natural course of events. Seems to me that it wouldn\'t be much of a
perfect society for anyone who disagreed. Until they had their attitude
"adjusted" (brainwashed), of course. I wonder if there\'s a single prole
that *hasn\'t* had their mental development interfered with? The perfect
slaves. Happy & content. Still slaves though.

SELDOM FOUNDATION:  Private research institution, established 134/1108 on 
PLANET (SECTOR 0000), dedicated to the study and development of psycho-
history.  The head of the Foundation was Dr. "Seldom", a Hiver and former
head of the sociology department at the University of CITY, PLANET.  Dr.
Seldom was best known not for [his?] papers on advanced psychohistorical
models, but for surprisingly accurate predictions that appeared in local
tabloids.

In 1124, the Foundation broke its usual silence with a press conference, 
in which Dr. Seldom announced that the fall of the Third Imperium was 
inevitable and outlined a plan to preserve as much for the future as
possible.  While this claim was supressed elsewhere by Imperial censors
(under Lucan), worsening conditions on PLANET soon led to widespread 
belieft that the Foundation was right and that only by following its
directives could they hope to survive.

In 1126, however, internal documentation was leaked to the press reveal- 
ing that the Foundation was attempting to subtly guide PLANET society to
a point where they could smoothly take control of the government - a 
responsibility the psychohistorians felt they were best qualified to 
hold, on the premise that the best state is the one that can most
efficiently manipulate the people to do and think as the leaders wish
them to.

In a highly emotional trial in which comparisons were frequently made to
Zhodani society and practices, Dr. Seldom and most of the senior 
researchers were found guilty of treason, conspiracy, and several million
counts of unlawful coercion.  All were executed.



NOTE:  The above entry is not present in any RCES library database.  If
  PCs should somehow learn of the Foundation from rumors or other sources
  and attempt to follow up on it by checking their own records, the Hiver
  technical expert assigned to each RCES vessel will apologetically remind
  them that Imperial-era library data, even when not infected by Virus, is
  notoriously spotty. 

Trust the Hivers.  The Hivers are our Friends.

AUTHOR\'S NOTE:  This post is not intended as an attack on the late Dr.
  Asimov or his works, but rather on the goals and methods of the Second
  Foundation (as revealed in the book of the same name).  Their moral
  justification for manipulating minds and societies seems to me nothing
  more than a refined version of \'might makes right\' - we have the power,
  we\'re justified in using it.  Their plan for the future of humanity is
  a chilling \'utopia\', much like the darker visions people have of the
  Zhodani.  On top of all of this, they\'re not even practicing good 
  science anymore, changing the data/experimental population to fit their
  theories rather than vice versa.  This is called \'fudging the results.\' 
  Bad. 

  I guess this library data entry is my way of dealing with the profound
  disgust I felt upon finishing the book - a way of denying the Foundation
  their seemingly-inevitable victory.  I sincerely hope that Dr. Asimov
  did not intend for the Second Foundation to be seen sympathetically.

	Yeah!!! I agree with that. I found some of the equipment guides so general
that I have taken to stealing and converting from GURPS Ultratech - I have
a lot of equipment write-ups done in WordPerfect for my players to peruse.
Maybe this is going to too much detail, but I think it adds to realism. All
pieces of equipment have their drawbacks and specialties.

	I know that big, thick lists of equipment are a pain in the a** but they
are a good idea. If Loren sees this ( 8-> ) , In my opinion this would be a
really neat product idea... You could do it like the ADnD 2nd Edition Monstrous
Compendiums. You go out, buy Infopacks on certain technology levels (whichever
are applicable for your area of play) and they all fit into a nice binder
(a nice black binder with an Imperial Sunburst or the logo of the Regency?).
I\'d go for it! Sounds like a must.

	What about little Infopacks (I like that term...) on firearms and other
neat stuff like the machine tools supplements that appeared a year or so ago.
(I think Rob Dean did those, but I\'m not sure).

	Anyway, I\'ve ranted long enough. I guess in the meantime I\'ll keep raiding
GURPS.

	Confused as usual,

	Well, clearly, the Zhodani are *not* as technically advanced as
the Imperium, putzing along as they are at TL 14.  Also, the only other
"highly" psionic race, the Droyne, are pretty placid without Mutants
running around to spark innovation.  These facts argue that
civilizations which stand on a foundation composed of Psionics may be
less innovative and "dynamic", but on the other hand they certainly seem
to be stable.  Whether that\'s a fair trade or not is, of course, up for
grabs...

Your comment about it being difficult to accept this was a little
unclear to me:  I certainly agree that, psionics or no, it\'d be hard to
provide a society where everyone\'s needs and wants are seriously
considered *and* consistantly provided.  However, it doesn\'t seem so
impossible that we could have a society which values an individual\'s
wellfare highly and uses whatever means it has at it\'s disposal to
*attempt* to provide them.  A society which considers an individuals
needs, however, need not be monolithic.  I don\'t recall anything that
says that the Zhodani, when absorbing (say) a former imperial world,
would wipe out all traces of the planet\'s cultural heritage.  They
"simply" begin implimenting the "nonviolence" and psionic caste
system...Somewhat frightening, perhaps, but the Imperium also introduces
a Nobility on new planets and subsectors...

wonder if the resistance to the Zhodani culture here on the list stems
from unease at the thought of humans living under such an *alien* form

giraffes, what the response would be...

This sort of brainwashing is going to depend on several factors:

a) Exactly how many nobles are Telepathic, anyway?

b) Of those, how many are strong enough to do that sort of mind control?

c) How many of the above are actually in the Taverchedl\'?

d) Is it really necessary?  The serfs weren\'t telepathically brainwashed
   Isn\'t economics wonderful? :)

If pressed, I\'d say that the Proles are only zapped once they get out of
line, where "out of line" is starting to think about "crimes".  The
Zhodani probably don\'t have the telepathic manpower to do fullscale
mental reengineering and "preventive maintanence."  They *do*, however,
start dealing with people as "criminals/sick" once their *intentions*
become dangerous, not once they start doing dangerous things....<Ooo,
sounds awfully machiavellian, eh?>

The TML is for discussing Traveller, not for grinding political axes.
Most of the people responding to you took the Zho\'s on their own terms,
as a society that has all the trappings of an oppressive state, but due
to the integral psionic culture, it actually works (mostly) as advertised.

This is why they are _ALIENS_.

If you want to read things about the \'60\'s, alternative lifestyles,
and homosexuals into it that\'s your business, but I for one think
you are so off base that I\'d like you to keep your discussions to
Traveller and take your philosophizing to a more appropriate forum.

Doesn\'t seem odd that a game that has featured mercenaries so prominently,
focused so much on military aspects (should I be from the Navy, Army, 
Marines, Scouts, Merchants, or Other?:) should get all misty-eyed
over the group that served as the major enemy for half the game\'s 
existence?  Maybe they just wanted to make things a little more
complex than EVIL ZHO\'S.

If it really bothers you that much, them _change it for your game_.
It works for this just as much as for things like weapons ranges
or whether or not maneuver drives use thruster plates or fusion
rockets.


Just to note, I am Ccing this to the TML nightly.

Why? It\'s been achieved on Earth in limited areas for brief periods of
time. All that is needed is that the society produces more than its
citizen needs (That dosen\'t mean that any such society will achieve it,
just that its possible in those circumstances).

>I find that I just can\'t believe that a monolithic society, of

Whoa! Where does it say that Zhodani society is monolitic? How would you
like  diverse society where nobody lies, cheats, or steals? Might that
not be worth considering?

Actually, they\'re not (at least, not going by the rules). They have to
be specially _trained_ to lie, for example.

It illustrates what the Zhodani of Scott\'s universe are capable of. It
dosen\'t say anything about the official zhodani except insofar as Scott
has managed to capture GDWs intentions.

>In short, the Zhodani system just sounds too good to be true.

Why? It\'s been achieved on Earth in limited areas for brief periods of
time. All that is needed is that the society produces more than its
citizen needs (That dosen\'t mean that any such society will achieve it,
just that its possible in those circumstances).

Whoa! Where does it say that Zhodani society is monolitic? How would you
like  diverse society where nobody lies, cheats, or steals? Might that
not be worth considering?

>Therefore I don\'t think

Actually, they\'re not (at least, not going by the rules). They have to
be specially _trained_ to lie, for example.

It illustrates what the Zhodani of Scott\'s universe are capable of. It
dosen\'t say anything about the official zhodani except insofar as Scott
has managed to capture GDWs intentions.

>In short, the Zhodani system just sounds too good to be true.   

As someone else pointed out, that\'s why they\'re _alien_!

  You\'ll still get blunt trauma and enough blunt trauma in the right place

  Over here we:

  1: Halve all hitpoints (for PC\'s:)

  2: Use open-ended damage rolls (each 6 means that an *extra* d6 is rolled ad
     infinitum).

  3: Head and chest rolls for PCs too (but not death, \'just\' immediate serious
     level *plus* double original damage)

  4: Has an extra \'destroyed\' wound level at double critical. Destroyed 
     extremities need replacement, destroyed chest or abdomen means death
     (with reservation for low-berthing and other high-tech stuff).

  5: Uses damage levels computed with 3G3 (22LR = 1D, 9Para = 2D, 5.56 = 4D,
     7.62 = 5D).

  I\'m working on redoing most weapons with 3G3, and although I\'ve got as far
as to rifles it is placed below several other more important things on my
\'stack\'.
  But I *will* post the armour list I made.

    'body' => '  I did this for my campaign last friday. It is a modification of the data
from TTNE, with additions from One Small Step, MegaT, Traveller, the MTJ1
article on battle dress and a certain amount of fiddling, tweaking and 
shortcutting of my own doing.

  AV: \'N\' means nil armour value, ie anything will pass without any reductions
      in damage.
      Parenthetical values are for melee attacks, Double this to get the
      number of *points* to subtract from the attack (not dice). If no
      paranthetical value exists, subtract twice the normal AV rating treating
      both \'0\' and \'N\' as 0.
      \'0\' means that it will stop weapons where the Dam and Pen weapons
      are equal, but not affect weapons with larger Dam than Pen.
      If there are two figures separated by a \'/\', then the first is for the
      body and the second for the head.
      If there are three figures separated by \'/\'s, then the first is for
      chest and abdomen, the second for the arms, legs and for the head
      and the third is for the face plate.
      (Head shots will hit the face plate on 1-2 on 1D6. It is optional to
       vary this chance based on wether the shot hits from the front, side or
       rear:)

   \'P\' means that at this TL, the at lower TLs unpowered armour will normally
       be powered.

   \'S\' means that at this TL self-sealing is standard on the armour.

   \'H\' means that at this TL a holographic viewscreen on the inside of the
       face plate is standard on the armour.

  Why are low-tech weapons better against melee attacks than many hightech 
weapons? It is because they derive much of their protection from metal plates
as shown by their weight. It is optional to multiply the AV of hard armours
(Hostile Env Vac, Combat, Battle, low-tech Vac\'s) with four or more to get
the number of points of damage they absorb from melee attacks.

  Disclaimer: I would *not* recomend the use of these armour levels with the
	      standard TTNE weapons damage and penetrations, since they were
	      designed for use with my variants of the weapons. But I promise
	      to get some weapons out before the TechArchie book comes out:)

If anyone answers "yes", could they please inform NASA, ESA or some other
suitable organisation of how they propose to do it? :-)

I think it would be EXTREMELY unlikely given any sensible amount of time
(less than 1000yrs say). Hi-altitude planes are useless as are ballons since
both require an atmosphere to work. Even assuming they produced some sort
of thruster (say evaporating water into the vacuum - rockets require liquid
O2 which is a not possible without complex cooling apparatus) they would
need a computer to plot the course and control the craft (even to do this you
have to have some means of determining your position in space). A further 
problem is the velocity change (delta-v) that they would require to land safely
on the moon, water thrusters would be nowhere near powerful enough.

However it might be possible if they landed on the planet with vacc suits,
given a generous ref :-). Using the high altitude glider + balloons to gain
altitude they could then have constructed some simple rockets fueled with,
say alcohol, and use the remaining atmosphere coupled with the oxygen
supplies from some of their vacc suits - this would be a one man trip only.
These rockets could then thrust the one pilot out of the planets gravity
given a thruster pack attached to his vacc suit and towards the moon.
This one guy then has the time it takes him to reach the moons surface from
maximum vacc suit communication range to tell the TL15 ship to pick him
up - otherwise he\'s dead. (A kinder alternative would be to allow him
to achieve orbit round the moon - but that might overtax his vacc suit\'s 
computer, prehaps a decaying orbit? :-)

Hope that gives you some ideas,

Roger

     Knowledge is always a powerful tool. Assuming they have access to
a data bank (such as is in their ship on the moon) they should be able
to build something. One question is `How did they get there\'? Did they
crash their shuttle? If that\'s the case rebuilding would be easier than
building from scratch. If they were abandoned with no resources other
than their wits, well... Could _you_ build a pocket calculator from a
sandy beach? I mean, most of the materials are there, so why not? The
single biggest advantage they have is this: They KNOW it can be done!
     There was a book by, I think, Jerry Pournelle called "King David\'s
Spaceship" in which a low tech civilization had to build a successful
spaceship to qualify for membership in a high-tech alliance. Their
solution, using explosives to litterally `blast off\', was interesting,
and might apply.

I would probably forget the lifting-plane/balloon idea.  They will eventually
need a rocket and a guidance system anyway to get to the moon.  They would
probably be best served by concentrating on that objective, then building one
BIG enough to get them into orbit.

As far as accomplishing it, there are a few factors to consider:

o What are their skills and aptitudes?  If a few of them are astronauts and
  the others are engineers and skilled craftsmen, then they would have a
  better chance.  It would take years to build up a technological base to
  even try to accomplish the task, though.  They would need metal foundries,
  a way to generate the propellant, probably electrical generators, etc.

o Do they have help from the natives?  This could lead to some interesting
  campaign developments.  If they could learn to communicate with the natives
  they could set up a religious following where the "priests" are taught to
  select the most intelligent of their followers to become priests themselves
  in the PC\'s "holy city".  Some would go back into the world.  Others would
  work on improving the technological base.  Some would eventually be able to
  learn skills that the PC\'s don\'t possess (eg: none of them could ever quite
  get the hang of celestial navigation, even though they understood the basic
  concepts).  This offers many plot variations.  The commoners (and perhaps
  most of the priests) would consider the technology magic.  They might react
  badly to this or to the priesthood (which steals their children).  The
  religion would have to teach ethics, morality, and spirituality (like a
  real religion) to keep the commoners happy.  The world might get "turned
  on" to technology.  Wars could be waged.  The PC\'s could be regarded as
  gods.  The PC\'s might have children (by other PC\'s or natives).  What will
  happen when the PC\'s leave?

I think with the right set of skills, the PC\'s should be able to rebuild the
technological base necessary.  The problem is that if they are missing any
skills, they would have no way to learn them, unless they had a "how things
work" book.

Even if they understand all of the skills that they need, they might not have
the aptitude for certain things.  They also would probably need raw muscle.
The natives could help here, as well as developing some (very few) skills
once they are taught the basics about a field.

You as GM could guide them along the religion lines through some type of
developments (the natives begin bringing offerings, perhaps), and then show
them that it is not easy being a god (when they have to teach the natives to
stop eating each other).  Once they start referring to the natives as "their
people", you have them hooked.

By the way, where are they going to get anagathics?

  What do you mean by TL0? TL0 covers everything from Joe Neandethal with his
trusty cudgel to the Roman Empire tech with concrete, siege machinery and
extremely crude steam engines.

  But I\'m leaning towards not possible. No way in the Joe Neanderthal case
and probably no way in the Roman case.

  The main problem is materials tech. Is black powder good enough to reach
escape velocity? Is the metalwork TL high enough to make an air-tight ship?
How about the engine, will the materials hold together? Even if you get to
orbit with it and it is tight enough, is it possible to construct maneuvering
thrusters for orbital injections (main problem: igniting and shutting them 
off).

  Do they have some higher-TL equipment like the wreakage of a small craft?
Then it might be possible to strap something together using the grav plates
from the craft powered by a steam-engine driven generator (possible at
Roman TL).

  Is there any relic tech just lying around?

  How big resources do they have? Pharao-level or peasant-level?

Hans:
Why? It\'s been achieved on Earth in limited areas for brief periods of
time. All that is needed is that the society produces more than its
citizen needs (That dosen\'t mean that any such society will achieve it,
just that its possible in those circumstances).
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Phil:
Reminds me of some of the accounts, written by the savemasters, of 
course, describing the "utopia" of plantation life. Reminds me
of a book about Darwin I read a long time ago. He talks about visiting a
plantatiion in Brazil, where the master assured him that this was a virtual
heaven on earth. He even trotted out his slaves & sure enough, not a single
one expressed the wish to be free! Well, Darwin wasn\'t fooled. He knew
a slave society when he saw one & so do I! The problem isn\'t producing
more than the citizens *need*, it\'s producing more than the citizens *want*.
I submit that the Zhodani have no where near as much as they want and their
society\'s behavior reflects that. On the other hand their expansion could
just be old fashioned \'crusading\', I suppose. Just as bad, IMO.
==========================================================================

Phil:  
>I find that I just can\'t believe that a monolithic society, of 
>any sort, could be preferable to a diverse one. 

Hans:
Whoa! Where does it say that Zhodani society is monolitic? How would you
like  diverse society where nobody lies, cheats, or steals? Might that
not be worth considering?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Phil:
It\'s right there in the books. It\'s the job of the Tavrchedl, as the "Sword
& Shield" the Zhodani ruling class, to ensure conformity. All dissimilar
cultures *must* yield to the Zhodani "One True Vision", or else, as the
Imperium has found out a number of times. As I said before, it\'s the na-
ture of such regimes. The greatest threat to them is the existence of 
*any* other form of society. 

"Nobody lies, steals & cheats"? Give me a break! Nobody *but* the ruling
class you mean. (Remember, *they* get the benefit of rights, unlike the
teeming "masses".) Of course, if *everyone* had the right to pyshic pri-
vacy then the Tavrchedl couldn\'t do their job. But after all, these proles
are just inferior creatures anyway, aren\'t they? They *need* to be cared
for so they don\'t do themselves harm. (Now, where have I *heard* that be-
fore?) Any society that believes that it\'s fine , even desirable, to ex-
clude such a portion of their population from enjoying any sort of inher-
ent rights, cannot be a Utopia. Medieval, yes; utopia, no. 
=======================================================================

Phil:
>Therefore I don\'t think 
>it\'s too surprising that I treat the benevolent assessments of Zhodani 
>rule as basic propaganda. Just because they\'re psionic doesn\'t mean that 
>they\'re not capable of just as much treachery & deceit as anyone else. 

Hans:
Actually, they\'re not (at least, not going by the rules). They have to
be specially _trained_ to lie, for example.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Phil:
Doesn\'t *everyone* have to learn to lie. No doubt it doesn\'t take long to
learn that much can be gained from lying. Just as in any human society.
(Zhodani *were* still human, last I heard)
=========================================================================

Phil:
>In short, the Zhodani system just sounds too good to be true.   

Hans:
As someone else pointed out, that\'s why they\'re _alien_!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Phil:
And, as I\'ve pointed out, they\'re also human too! With all the millenia 
of common terran evolution still embedded in their "human nature". On the 
other hand, I suppose someone could say there\'s an "alien" society not too 
far from where I live. It\'s called the Republic of Mexico!

As Catie said; "they\'re *still* slaves." (sic). A slave society is
still a slave society & I just can\'t see how that could be considered
anything but a dystopia.

Me too.

Just a quick word as Phil seems to be upset at the description of
slaves and classes in Utopia.  I know this is niggling, but I
believe the original Utopia was ruled by philospoher kings and indeed
had a lower class who were watched over.

Rather similar to the Zho system, I think.  The philosopher kings were
the tough bit to find, as no one could find a completely wise and honest
philospher king.  With Telepathy as common as it is in the Consulate,
One might conclude that the Zhodani \'nobles\' (I think they are more like
Roman Citizens than \'nobles\') would be the best candidates for the job
as described.

They are not, however, completely wise.  Being human.

Dane:
      Which behavior are you talking about?  Which expansion are you refering
to, exactly?  The Imperium is a whole heck of a lot more expansive than the
Zhodani, actually.  This is also in the books...Zhodani Module, pg 9: 
"...recent Zhodani history has been dominated by their emnity towards the
Imperium, with personal distaste reinforced by a feeling that the Imperium
seeks to hamper Zhodane\'s *slow, conservative expansion* by pre-empting the
best planets and otherwise limiting growth."  Emphasis mine.  Page 10:  "The
Zhodani Consulate is roughly at the limits of growth; further expansion of its
borders would strain interior communications without providing great amounts
of additional benefit.  Instead, attention has been directed, in the long
term, toward the galactic core."
 
      If you mean the Frontier wars, I offer this, taken from page 66 of the
Rebellion Sourcebook (MegaTrav):  
 
"...it is natural for the Spinward Marches to fear a Zhodani invasion. 
Indeed, that fear was the purpose of the centuries\' Zhodani aggression
(sic)...The multi-generation campaign to protect the Zhodani Consulate from
the largest human empire in existence has been a success.  In the early years
of the Imperium there was a real possibility that Imperials would expand into
Zhodani territory.  Now, the Imperium is falling apart; no longer is it a
threat to the Zhodani."

Dane:
      Yes and no.  Yes, on page 14 of Zhodani it says that they monitor all of
Zhodani society and conduct periodic examinations and sweeps of everybody\'s
mental health, looking for signs of deviant thought patterns and unacceptable
behavior.  Re-education is also visited upon the Noble class, however, as is
pointed out in the "Legal System" section on page 13.  Clearly, from the
quotes up above the Frontier wars were *not* wars of conversion; they had
nothing to do with the Tavrchedl\'.
 
      As for \'all dissimilar cultures yielding,\' take a look on page 10, where
it says:  "...expansion encountered a variety of human and non-human cultures,
many of them long-standing and well-established.  Some of t;hose cultures have
been enticed into accepting Zhodani ways, with most of them having been
absorbed into the Consulate.  Others have remained client states of the
Consulate; still others have resisted the Zhodani, accepting Imperial aid or
depending on their own resources."  
 
      Hardly the Evil Juggernaut Phil is trying to make them out to be.

Dane:
      This is a little stickier:  Yes, the Zhodani have a two class system
with one portion being denied *voting* rights.  The Imperium also has a Noble
class often exempted from certain restrictions.  Many of the Imperial
planetary governments are even more heinous than that!  Consider three other
points, however.
 
      1)  Page 12 of Zhodani:  "The advanced educational tools available to
the Zhodani make it possible for nearly all members of society to see their
own potential and to see the paths they can take toward realizing it."
 
      2)  Page 13 of Zhodani:  "Trust is an assumption.  Locks are rare, and
more likely safety devices to protect children than anti-theft devices.  Walls
protect from teh elements rather than from intruders.  Laws deal more with
appropriate action than with crimes."
 
      3)  The legal system is hardly lacking in Prole Rights.  It simply
doesn\'t give the Proles the vote.  They are judged by a *telepath* as to
whether they are guilty, evidence *is* heard, and so forth.  The *same*
procedure is applied to Nobles, except that a Noble of higher rank must sit in
judgement.  Page 13:  "For the good of all concerned, a convicted Noble is
usually transferred to another location or world rather than returned to his
or her original position after re-education."
 
      So, Phil\'s declaration that *of course* they lie and cheat because
they\'re human is completely false *according to the books*.  If he wants to
portray the Nobles in that manner he\'s (of course) welcome to, but the books
are explicit in saying that such crime is *unknown* in the Zhodani Consulate -
- - neither Prole nor Noble does it.

Dane:
      Yup, the Zhos are human.  However, in the Zhodani society, Lying will
*not* gain you anything but re-education.  Unless you\'re Psionic (ie Noble)
and *very strong* you\'re not going to be able to hide lying and cheating. 
Esp. since whoever you lied to and cheated is probably going to report you.
 
      This is sort of the whole point, I think:  The Zhodani society is a
Human one without any advantage to lying, cheating or stealing.  Phil doesn\'t
think this is possible, which is his right, but as a consequence of this
assumes we should be agreeing with him that the Zhodani are clearly an evil
empire.  I think some of us do think it\'s possible, and that Humans are not
intrinsically nasty and conniving.  I know I don\'t think we\'re inherently
liers<shrug>.  However, GDW has gone out of its way to present the Zhos as
just that sort of society.  Nothing contradicts this portrayal of them in the
books.

      Slaves in what way?  Proles don\'t have the vote.  They have a legal and
social system which permits them to "see their own potential and to see the
paths they can take toward realizing it."  Crime is completely absent and the
criminals are 100% reformed using psionic techniques.
 
      And yes, there is an alien society not too far from where you live.  It
is the Republic of Mexico.  Canada isn\'t that far away, either.  The attitudes
and cultures of foreign countries are in many cases radically different than
those here in the US.  Heck, we\'re not even that uniform:  consider an average
teen growing up in south-central LA and one growing up in Minot, North Dakota. 
How similar are their world views, attitudes, and so forth going to be?  To
the LA teen, the lifestyle that exists in Minot is all but unthinkable, and
vice versa.  <Shrug>

Ok here is what I have,

	At least one man with a technical background upto 1940\'s level of tech

	A pile of basic engineering, chemistry, mining and physics books plus
	a bunch of \'how to..\' books.

	Some Precision TL 8 micrometers, vernier caliper and lenses

	A pile of anagathics  (what do you think the ship was stealing?)

	A map of the planetry resources

	A region rich in Nitrate deposits, oil and minerals.

	(possibly) some TL 0 (stone/bronze age)primitives to use to do grunt

	A tall mountain

	A BIG lake

If you had plenty of time to calculate the orbit, could you build a 1 use
dedicated analog calculator to do the burn times etc?  

I beleive the German Me233 Komet had a very easy to build rocket engine
maybe that would do? Pumps are tricky but not impossible surely?
Do you have to use steel? for low stress 1 use applications at least?
Life support may not be a problem (a vaccsuit with enough air MAY be available)

The TL 15 ship is \'off\' no radio reception.

And noone is going to tell you anything different, dammit! Right? You seem
emotionaly, almost religiously, unwilling to explore even the possibility 
that it could work. Now, I have my own doubts about the Zhodani, but they
are based on the history of the Consulate. So I\'m really just playing
devil\'s advocate here. Still, there is one crucial difference between a
psionic society and any society we\'ve ever seen on Earth that makes me
wonder. What, you ask? See below.

>The problem isn\'t producing
>more than the citizens *need*, it\'s producing more than the citizens *want*.

I can\'t resist the temptation to point out that thanks to the Tavrchedl\'
the citizens don\'t want more than they get. But that really wasn\'t my point.
The example I\'m thinking about is the Scandinavian countries ind the 6th
and 7th decade of this century which your words "all one\'s needs & wants 
will be, at the very least, seriously considered" fits to a \'t\'. Nor should
such abundance be hard to achieve in any technologically based society that
is willing to practice population control. (Which most of the societies in
Traveller space, the Aslans not excluded, obviously does).

Yes, I think that crusading is closer to the mark than wants. Not that 
they\'ve done any crusading for the last couple of millenia.

Yes, but conformity to what? The notion that lying, cheating, and stealing
is bad, or total cultural conformity? The first, definitely. The second,
perhaps, but not necessarily so on the evidence.

This seems not to be the case once one examine the number of times the
Imperium has found that out closer. The Zhodani attacks have all been
defensive in concept (their concept; let\'s not get involved in any
discussion about the morality of pre-emptive strikes. I don\'t believe
in them, but the Zhodani obviously does). Evidence: The failure of the 
Zhodani to attack and assimilate the Domain.

 
>"Nobody lies, steals & cheats"? Give me a break! Nobody *but* the ruling
>class you mean. 

No, I mean _nobody_. According to the rules lying is a special skill taught
by covert services. 

>(Remember, *they* get the benefit of rights, unlike the teeming "masses".)

Do they?

A noble will still know that he can\'t hide the truth if he ever gets 
investigated. He may not be subject to routine examinations (though why
not if the Tavrchedl\' really is a medical service? Scott? What does it
say about that in _Zhodani_? Unfortunately I don\'t have it available at
the moment). 

>But after all, these proles are just inferior creatures anyway, aren\'t they? 
>They *need* to be cared for so they don\'t do themselves harm. (Now, where

First of all, you are the one who brought up the Utopia motif in the first
place, and back then you exemplified it by talking about wants and needs
being considered. By that definition I think that the Zhodani way of life
_could_ be as good as they claim. As for rights, you\'re still considering
it a given that mental examinations always, in all circumstances, is a 
violation of the person concerned. The Zhodani consider such examinations
medical ones. I Denmark we have for decades had mandatory innoculations of
all children for several diseases. Sticking needles into people and
forcing them to swallow unpleasant fluids! What a violation! Still, I\'m
quite glad that my chances of getting consumption from some passing 
stranger is quite a lot less than it could have been. Nor do I feel
myself much of a slave for the experience (What I have to do to pay my
taxes, now, _that_ makes me feel like a slave sometimes ;-).

Btw. as I said above, I don\'t have my copy of _Zhodani_ available. If you
can find a reference to the nobles being _by right_ extempt from mental
examination then I\'ll admit that you\'ve proved a point about the Zhodani.

No. It\'s self-taught. You try it out, it works, you try again, you get
found out, you experience the consequences of being found out, you 
gradually work out wether its worth the risks, etc. Eventually you mature 
(if you do; some people don\'t) and start to consider the moral implications 
of lying. Show me a child with a strong moral sense and I\'ll show you a 
child whose parents have indoctrinated him with those strong moral precepts.
(OK, I\'ll admit to the possibility of a rare, naturally honest person, but
I haven\'t heard of any yet (Except Jesus Christ, of course ;-)).

>No doubt it doesn\'t take long to
>learn that much can be gained from lying. Just as in any human society.
>(Zhodani *were* still human, last I heard)

But that\'s exactly the point! That\'s the crucial difference between a
psionic society and our. A Zhodani (prole and noble alike) has grown up
learning that _he ALWAYS gets found out_!!! If not by his neighbourhood
Tavrchedl\' councellor then by his psionically gifted parents. By the
time he is grown up honesty is a conditioned reflex with him.

You think about the implications of growing up _knowing_ beyond a shadow
of a doubt that lying is impossible and then tell me if you don\'t think
any society that grows from that wouldn\'t seem far more alien to you
than Mexico.

  The drop from J-3/M-3 to J-1/M-1 doesn\'t seem to be a typo.  Compare some

Getting high in the atmosphere does not mean that it will be any easier to get
into orbit.  There\'s still a slight problem of achieving 8 km/s.

I\'d be amazed if a simple alcohol rocket could get 1 km/s exhuast velocity,
and even so it would take 200 tons of fuel to get a single person into orbit.
Multiply by 20 to get to the moon.

I\'d like to see someone plot a decaying orbit around the moon!  No atmosphere
to slow the guy down means little chance of orbital decay.

Overtaxing the vacc-suit computer would be less of a problem (*especially*
at TL15 - hand supercomputers are TL11 stuff), compared to the problem of
needing yet more fuel...

It varies a fair bit, but 1000 parsecs is a reasonable guide.  As far as

Nebulae are located all over the galaxy.  Dark nebula range in size from the
lower limit of observation up to galaxy-spanning lanes.  Bright nebulae
are usually only a few light years across, but can reach hundreds of light-
years if illuminated (or ionised) by very bright stars.  They wouldn\'t have
much game-mechanical effect - they pretty much \'just look cool\'.  Density of
gas/dust in a nebula is still so low that interplanetary space looks like
osmium in comparison.  It\'s only because the thickness is so large, that you
can see anything.

I\'d like to know a bit more, I don\'t have enough information.  Is it
1-5 people on a tech level 6-8, with a general population of several
million?  Or is this a Desert Island kinda problem?  Also do they have
access to TL 15 (or TL 6-8) computers?  Do they have cash for that
world?  Or even Astromomey books?  What kind of education?

My guess is you have a desert island type problem.  And my answer is I
don\'t think so.  Just to hit a moon, you need a computer and/or some
very good astromony insterments (yes, the first orbits were don\'t on
chalkboards, but that was really the results of 300 years of science.)

To build a rocket engine (even solid fuel) you need to know 100\'s of
years of knowlege of Chemistry, metalurgy and fuild dynamics.  Solid
fuel can be harder, because you are burning explovies, how do you keep
it from lighting up all at once?  How do you make a fuel which burns
on it\'s one oxidizer?

If you have a chemistry book you (at least I think I could) can figure
out the chemistry you need.

To make the trip it takes Liquid O2, or even pressurized gas.  You
need Liquid O2 for a Liquid fuel engine.  To store gases you need
Steel flasks.  And GOOD pressure/vaccuum pumps.   5 people in several
life times couldn\'t mine enough steel.  

They would also have to have a transport system to make it work.  I
can\'t think of any one place on this planet with everything you need
sitting in one place.  So you need a real infrastructure, like the
US\'s. 

If the planet has people that you can work and educate, even TL 0
slaves.  And your people have computers to plot the moons orbit and
guide the ship (you need ATLEAST simple analog computers, which I
couldn\'t build, but I think someone being creative with some TL7
laptops might be able to hack something).

The scale of the earth/moon system is hitting a golfball about 3000 mi
(or 4800 Km) and missing by inches (Cm).  And this is all assuming
that have been able to build a self contained rocket motor.  Which is
assuming you have a cabin which will support life for 3 days.

The simple final answer 5 people with no prefab parts, no way.  5
people with no prefab parts but some labor maybe with lots of luck. 5
people with lots of TL 6-8 people, of course.

For more insite, subscribe to the space-tech mailing list.  For a
story that is roughly equivent to your problem look at Riverworld
books by Farmer (I think).  

In the books if you don\'t know Mark Twain builds a riverboat out of
very little (really he builds two, and people at the same site build
an air ship too) and a riverboat is MUCH simpler than getting living
beings out of the atmosphere.  And they didn\'t have to worry about
feeding themselves.

Hope this doesn\'t total blow you away.  But when you better define the
problem I might beable to get you some more ideas of hangups.

Ok here is what I have,

	At least one man with a technical background upto 1940\'s level of tech 

	A pile of basic engineering, chemistry, mining and physics books.

	Some Precision TL 8 micrometers, vernier caliper and lenses

	A pile of anagathics

	A map of the planetry resources

	A region rich in Nitrate deposits, oil and minerals.

	(possibly) some TL 0 primitives to use to do grunt work.

	A tall mountain

If you had plenty of time to calculate the orbit, could you build a 1 use
dedicated analog calculator to do the burn times etc?  

I beleive the German Me233 Komet had a very easy to build rocket engine
maybe that would do? Pumps are tricky but not impossible surely?
Do you have to use steel? for low stress 1 use applications at least?
Life support may not be a problem (a vaccsuit with enough air MAY be available)

No prefab parts tho....

The technology to build handheld computers may be there but why would you
fit one into a vacc suit? All it has to do is control lifesupport, a 
supercomputer would be an unneeded waste of money.

For the completely insane player there is the alternative as used in
Larry Niven\'s Footfall. The atom bomb powered spacecraft! Build a large
iron shell several meters thick (I don\'t know how thick but it has to
shield you from an atom bomb!) and mount a \'living quarters\' on it using
heavy springs. Then to take off throw out a couple of atom bombs and off you
go! Steam jets can be used for steering and more atom bombs for thrust.
A guidance computer could probably be done without since the cabin must be
relatively well cushioned - enough that the jolt of landing from inaccurate
thrusting is less that that of an atom bomb! The biggest problem is
manufacturing the bombs themselves. The hardest part of which is to produce
plutonium. This can be achieved if they have a uranium ore deposit and know
how to extract the uranium. They then build a reactor which will then
produce plutonium. (use graphite as a moderator and remove all the hi-tech
safety systems that todays reactors have - Fermi build a pile of high
purity graphite bricks and uranium rods that manage to go critical).
Iron can easily be produced given time. Please note this suggestion is
not to be taken completely seriously - but it might just work if the
players are VERY lucky and the referee is VERY generous. The alternative
is to put the natives on a crash course of civilisation, after all it
only took us about 2000 years without help.

PHILOSOPHER KINGS AND UTOPIA
I could be wrong, but I believe Plato was one of the first Utopians.
He wrote extensively on society and politics, and founded a colony to put
his ideas into practice. It failed after a few years. Among other things,
Plato had no use for artists, especially story-tellers and thespians, for they
produced no tangible resources for the state; they only consumed. One reason
I don\'t like Plato, that.

At any rate, remember that Utopian societies have historically been an
expression of the human quest for the ideal. As long as they are founded
and controlled by humans (which the Zhodani are) they will be flawed.

MOON SHOT
This is really interesting! I\'m glad whoever started it brought it up.

Well, I just got my copy jumbled, but it seems you\'ve defined the resources
a little bit better. I take it they crashed on the planet and their ship
is irreparable. Are the computers intact? A starship\'s computing power would
go a long way to computing the requisite angles, consumption rates, etc needed
for the trip.

BTW, even if they didn\'t have the computers, grunt labor to build a primitive
way of measuring the movement of heavanly bodies (ala Stonehenge, or Mayan
methods) could probably land them near enough that they could steer by
sight once there.

I think it\'s mainly because it\'s *obvious* magic.

Thruster plates are presented as scientific devices, which should therefore
follow a scientific basis.  No such basis is presented (for obvious reasons)
and so I feel a sense of dissatisfaction.  Furthermore, the existence of
such a device leads to various other technologies (such as a simple
energy-creating device) which are absent, with no explanation.

Psionics is presented simply as magic, studied scientifically but not based
upon scientific principles.  It claims no more \'legitimacy\' than it actually
possesses.

If you want to get into orbit, you need a delta-V of 8 km/s.  If you want to
get to the moon, you need 11 km/s.  It doesn\'t really matter whether you\'re
at the bottom of the atmosphere or above it.  (Actual figures will vary for
different planets, but escape velocity is always sqrt(2) times orbit velocity.

Getting above the atmosphere is *not* the same thing as getting into orbit.
(You have less friction, but the strength of gravity is almost the same)


On a slightly different note, the surface gravity is not directly connected
with orbit speed.  Orbit speed is easily calculated as
  orbit speed = sqrt(surface gravity * planet radius).

(Make sure all quantities are measured in consistent units)

A 1g planet will not necessarily have the same escape velocity as Earth.
It would have to be the same radius.  On the plus side, many Earth-type
planets will have the same composition, so the size should be about the same
for the same surface gravity.

> Hey, I never said it would be easy - the ref does have to be kind!

(As a note, this 4000 ton figure assumes the high 1km/s figure, and *only*
a 70 kg person - no spaceship, no suit, etc)

It would be easier if the planet was high-density or low-gravity, and the
moon in question was in a low orbit.  Still assuming 1km/s exhaust, but a
planet like Mars (half size, half gravity), and a moon (like Deimos) in
low orbit:
  Orbit speed is half that of Earth, ie. 4 km/s.  Fuel/payload ratio is
  ratio = exp(delta-V / exhaust) - 1
        = exp(4)-1,
  which is about 50 to 1.

Getting 1 ton (a group of people and hull) to the moon should take only about
50 tons of fuel.  Much easier than the case for Earth.  If the planet stats
haven\'t already been generated, it would be a reasonable act of ref kindness
to set up this sort of situation.

> Who said THIS moon had no atmosphere?

No-one ... but it\'s rather unlikely.  A moon would have to be very large to
retain an atmosphere.  I\'m talking around Mars-sized.  That is, about 10
times heavier than our own Moon - which is generally considered especially
large.  (The orbital problems also become more difficult, and you need to
worry - a lot - about atmosphere entry to such a moon)

I can think of a couple of reasons.

1) A computer that qualifies as \'super-\' to us certainly would not to TL 15
  technology.  A model/1 (at least!) would probably be about as common as
  digital clocks are today.  (Glancing around, I see 6 such clocks in direct
  view.  I have another 2 in my pencil case.  All but 2 are parts of a
  device that has a different primary function)  If you don\'t like the clock
  analogy - I see 4 devices that serve as (at least) 4-function calculators.

2) Necessity.  A space-suit needs to be safe.  This means being immediately
  aware of any problems.  Air duration, suit integrity, probably also short-
  range comms, thrusters, and various other options.  Voice control is easy,
  and some sort of HUD (probably holoscreen) would probably be a standard
  part of the suit.  At this point, it would be extra effort to restrict
  the computer to the single purpose of suit/comm/thruster control.  If
  nothing else, the thruster control should include primitive navigation
  software (eg  at least equal to ancient TL 12 capability)

There is a slight element of pure gravitational decay, but this is utterly
negligible for anything less than close binary stars, on the scale we are
talking about.  Tidal stress can actually cause objects to \'decay\' outwards,
as the angular momentum contained in the spin of an object is transferred
to the orbit.  Gravitational radiation (as yet undetected) can be completely
ignored.

The reason satellites fall out of orbit is due to drag from the atmosphere.
There is no clear boundary that divides \'space\' from \'atmosphere\'.  Slight
drag from the almost-vacuum drops the object into a slightly lower orbit,
where the gas is a little thicker, exerting more drag, ...

Any contragrav unit which is repairable, is worth much more than its mass in
gold in this situation!  I\'d much rather try to build a power supply for a
grav unit than try to reinvent extremely dangerous rocket technology, and
produce tons of fuel for the explosive contraption thus constructed.


- -*-*-*-*-*-

Here\'s a thought for the total munchkin powergamer terrorists among you:

It is easy to build a 6G unmanned spacecraft, for very little cost.  Now,
set this up about a parsec outside a star system, do a simple orbit
plot of some target object (say an unihabited planet in the same system as
a planet of 9 billion people), and start up the engines.  In just over a
year, it will hit your target at 99.88% of the speed of light, causing
extensive disruption of the planet.  The good part is, if the system
defence can spot an object at 1 billion km, they\'ll have just over 4 seconds
to react before it impacts.  Besides which, there\'s not really anything they
can do to deflect it.

"It has been said that psionics has made the Zhodani Consulate the most
powerful, effective and absolute tyranny in human history - and also the
happiest and most stable.  Both statements are quite true."

Prole voting:
Proles can not vote, but they can lobby.  And as anyone who has lived
within spitting distance of Washington DC, Lobbying is VERY powerful.

Prole power:
Zhodani as a people tend to be ambitious.  This ambition is not
restricted to the voting classes.  Proles may indeed have large
ambitions.  Who is to say that there are not prole millionaires or
even billionaires in the Consulate?  Are there not millionaires and
billionaires in the Imperium who are not of the aristocracy?  And when
a prole billionaire starts lobbying for something...

As to weither the Proles are lacking in mental rights:  (p.14)
"Thought police monitor all of Zhodani society, conducting periodic
examinations of individuals in order to ensure that everyone\'s mental
health is at acceptable levels."

Note:  There is no mention of exception being made for voting citizens,
intendants, or "nobles" if you wish to call them that.  It specifically
states that ALL individuals are examined and EVERYONE\'S mental health
is in question.  When I have run campaigns with Zhos in the consulate,
I once had to haul in the entire crew of a ship to undergo psionic
interrogation.  This means everyone.  Prole crewmembers, Intendent
crewmembers, and "Noble" crewmembers.  NO ONE has the right to mental
privacy in the Consulate.

The "right" of mental privacy is not a right that the nobles have.
Nobles are subject to the same laws as proles, and the laws deal more
harshly with nobles than they do with proles.  (p.13)

Thus, I submit that the Zhodani Consulate is neither as rosy as I tend
to make it appear, nor as dark and forbidding as Phil would have it,
but somewhere in between.  It *IS* a tyranny, and it *IS* a utopia at
the same time.  And if you have trouble reconciling that, realize that
it IS alien.

I might even point out that here in the good old US of A, there is NO
mention Whatsoever in the Constitution of a "Right to privacy".  I do
not feel my rights have been trampled on lately...

This is really just a variation of Jules Verne\'s method for getting to the
moon. I thought of suggesting it earlier but I figured the acceleration would
have been too great. It would indeed require an exceedingly benevolent GM.

PSIONIC SOCIETY
This is really convoluted. I only have the basic MTraveller set, so I
don\'t know too many specifics of the Zhodani. However, I have given thought to
psionic societies for a GURPS campaign or two I ran.

First of all, I would assume that deceit would still be possible. It would
take on new forms and measures, but things like that will always be around.
Kind of like an arms race. Sure, there are thought police, but I\'ll bet the
average Zhodani is more adept at shielding his thought than a Solomani. In
fact, they would have to be, if privacy is important at all.

Consider intimate thoughts, or the little lies we tell when we want to avoid
hurting someone\'s feelings. What would you do if you were dating one of these
Thought Police guys, liked him (or her) as a friend but didn\'t want to get
too close? Things could turn ugly if there isn\'t some way of keeping some
thoughts private.

Also, the thought police are going to be limited by the constraints of their
own resources. What would prevent a noble from hiring a number of underlings,
retiring to a secret base, and plotting there, where no one could monitor him?

A lot of the arguments so far have assumed that either the power levels balance
out, or assume that the thought police are significantly more powerful than
the average person (the latter is not wholly unreasonable). I think that there
will always be a balance between the means of detecting and correcting deviant
behavior and the means for accomplishing criminal acts.

Editor problems Dane? ^_^

GDW published as much of Foreven as they are going to publish
in Imperiallines #1. That gives a sector map with only system LOCATIONS
give, NO UWP\'s except for 3 (4?) systems of note.

It\'s being kept as a "GM\'s Preserve", so folks can detail it on their own
without having to worry about future GDW products mucking up their
continuity.

Cheers

Notes: The SGP-22 was designed and produced by the Crestring Arms Company
of NeuBerlin. This pistol normally fires an explosive charge, although
iron slugs are available for target practice. The explosive round cannot
penetrate armour, but does considerable damage to unprotected targets. The
SGP-22 is a popular weapon for private purchase by members of Neubayern\'s
ruling class, although Navy and Marine personnel aren\'t allowed to carry
explosive rounds aboard ship. The SGP-22 is widely (and unofficially) known
as the "Police Blaster."

Ammo: 7x21mm explosive charge
Wt: 1.8 kg
Mag: 15 box
Cost: Cr810

Additional Notes: Like all small arms made by Neubayern companies, the
SGP-22 has a built-in laser sight. The magazine stores enough power to
fire 16 shots rather than 15. This is because police officers (and
civilians, for that matter) routinely carry defensive sidearms with a
full magazine and a round in the chamber.

  Foreven was declared a "Blank Land" by GDW.  Anyone can do what they
like with it, but nothing will be published for it beyond what already
exists in Classic Traveller materials.  The dot map with the half-dozen
officially placed worlds appears in Imperial Lines #1, the "official"
Traveller newsletter published by GDW (and currently stalled between
issues 2 and 3).  All official information on Foreven is there.

The Traveller Book has just about everything you need to get started.
I managed to find a copy a few weeks ago for about $7.00; however,
I\'ve seen it priced up to $20.00.  The module that I liked best was...
Shoot, I\'m having trouble remembering the name.  The ***** Gambit.  I
still have not found my Traveller stuff after our house fire or I\'d
check on it tonight.  The Traveller books go for anywhere from $1.00
to as high as $5.00.  You\'ll need to look around since the silly
people at GDW stopped printing them.

  I\'m an enthusiastic Traveller reader (and occasionally Ref or Player) and
 have been for about ten years. (End of Biography)  I\'ve been getting the list
 for a month and reading the archives, and it\'s nice to see some people have
 wasted as much memory on it as I have.
  Anyway, I got Traveller- The Non-Event as soon as it came out, saw that it
 was as bad as everyone had feared (but it\'s bad points have been covered here
 enough) and placed it on a shelf till TTA comes out (it\'s Fire Fusion and
 Steel now isn\'t it? sounds better for the SpaceOrk geeks I suppose).
  I think that\'s as far as I\'ll go in releasing the    months of frustration
 and despair over TNE before I get carried away.

 Now, this message was just to say hello and stop me feeling like a voyeur,
 but I\'ve thought of one thing to say-  since the dust cleared/blood dried
 over the Fusion Engine arguement, mention of TNE has been rather light, ie.
 no discusion on the Arses or Regency, and most interest has been in non-TNE
 subjects ( notice how people got stuck into the Zhodani thread- who are the
 least changed area in TNE).

 So, do people really consider "The Non-Event" as part of the Traveller
 Universe we played in for years, or just as a new SFRPG. I mean, with a new
 rules system and a new background, is it any more Traveller than 2300?,(and
 that game had the Traveller name to start with, and PGMPs) even the Technology
 has changed from Classic/MT.

 I was just wondering how many people have actually changed over to the TNE
 rules (or even background) or plan to do so when TTA comes out?

 I suspect TTA will decide the issue. It sounds brilliant, and if even half
 decent (ie. less than 20 naff pictures, less than 10 pages of errata, binding
 lasts at least a fortnight) it might be worth changing over to the new rules.

 I\'ve wasted enough bandwidth so I\'ll sign off before I think of something

Well, as much as I dislike the sweeping hand of the virus, I have gone ahead
and moulded my traveller world to the new scenarios and rules. I\'m looking
forward to the new architecture guide, but that\'s more a toy for me than a
necessary game aid for my players. Granted, I ripped out the section on the
virus and left it impressively destructive, but made if a little more
realistic for my own suspension of disbelief. The game has been going quite
well - two "old timers" from cold storage awaken into a world having been
rescued from a cometary orbit by a planet just reaching through Tech 8 and
climbing out into space. Plenty of good role playing and the new rules
haven\'t changed the game that much for us. The biggest gripe my players have
is the lack of rules for aliens - they enjoyed playing Aslan and
particularly Vargr (my own personal favorite as well).

So at least one of us has gone on ahead and followed GDW to see where it
goes...

Having finally dug myself out of the editor problem I was having (sorry about
all those \'^H\'s...), I feel a great need to vent my spleen on this topic...

(Hi, Anthony!)

I\'ve played with the new rules and find them fairly easy to pick up and quite
adaptable.  There seem to be some small, easily correctible imbalances between
weapon damage vs. armor available.  I\'m *eager* for both the TAM and Brilliant
Lances...So I, for one, am switching to the new rules.

HOWEVER

I\'m hanging out circa 1111 Imperial and totally ignoring both the rebellion and
the Virus...<Shudder>  Actually, the Rebellion is okay, but I\'ve just decided
that I don\'t want to game during it.  When and if I game up and through that
point, I\'ll be ignoring the Virus altogether...

On a more practical note, not only are the skill tables and section way too far
from the character generation system, but there\'s all the stupid guff about "Two
Syllable Code names for use during combat" and an overall anti-technological
feel to the whole rulebook, even in the sections on the Regency (they\'ve turned
away from massive automation and most robots have been deactivated, that sort of
thing).  The NPCs are defined in terms of combat ability only...Why not make an
"Experienced NPC" have an X in his *primary skill*, not just in his combat skill?

Is it just me, or do the Hivers seem to be acting somewhat out of character?
Why haven\'t they absorbed the RCES and "converted" everybody to the Hiver
"nonviolence" ideal like they did with the minor human races on their Spinward
border back in the Imperial Era?

I guess I\'m pretty much in the "Accept the Rules, Ignore the New Continuity"
category...I\'m also trying to complete (or at least flesh-out) my collection of
Classic supplements :)

I didn\'t think it was all that bad.  There is too much in the way of errata
though :-(  (Did the published errata notice the forgotton tab stops in the
world generation tables ---- the TL DMs to be specific??)

I am hoping that it will be good.  At least it had better be less error prone

A few other (now non-"canon") references were made to Foreven sector that
weren\'t mentioned in the Imperial Lines issue.
   *  As Scott mentioned, Foreven is marked as "Iakr" on Zhodani-centric
      maps.  The world "Parthinia", C694655-C, with an aboriginal minor
      human race, the Issugur, was located in Iakr according to an old
      Traveller product, "Alien Realms".  (Yeah, I admit to having a
      copy.  It was REAL cheap.)  It wasn\'t located.
   *  One of the companies in "Book 7: Merchant Prince" was headquartered
      on a world which was located in Foreven somewhere that was not on
      the "official list".  I don\'t have a copy, or I\'d check it out.
Both references were in GDW products.

I have a question or two, too.  According to IL #1, Zdovesil/Anika
is the Zhodani provincial capital in Foreven.  I seem to recall
something about the Zhodani government not being organized at the
sector level.  Does this mean that Zdovesil is the capital of
"Iadr Nsobl" province, or just of Foreven   Since it is effectively
in the Zhodani "rear area", and is near the center of the province,
I\'d lean toward the first, but it isn\'t clear in the article.

Do the Zhodani use sector grids anyway?  I thought that was supposed
to be a Vilani innovation that was mostly used by the Imperium, former
Imperial states (like the Solomani Confederation) and worlds influenced
by the Imperium.

I look at the TNE as a seperate game.  I bought a used copy
at the same time as I picked up Cadillacs & Dinosaurs, another
really unique game from GDW.

	TNE:  The universe as we know it has been destroyed and it is
	many years later.  We have to rebuild/survive.

	C&D:  The Earth as we know it has been destroyed and it is
	many years later.  We have to rebuild/survive.

	T2000: The Earth as we know it has been destroyed and it is
	many years later.  We have to rebuild/survive.

	Any other GDW game:  The <place> as we know it has been
	destroyed.  We have to rebuild/survive.

That really gets old after a while.

	I don\'t really see the need to switch over to TNE.  I\'ll more
	than likely pick up the various components as they hit the
	used game market.  I can\'t very well complain about the game
	if I haven\'t read through it.

 Once again, proof is presented to the world at large that even the
Zhodani nuts can\'t spell the language.
 The Zhodani designation for Foreven is IAKR (ee-Yak-ur).

 Don\'t worry, Scott, you aren\'t alone in this affliction.

  According to Mike Mikesh (around the end of last month) they were working
hard to get it ready by \'mid august\' so that it could be included as promo

 A few answers to your post "a few questions to GDW" (Note:

 LKW\'s comments (if any) are set off _Thusly_):

 We are not running a master game, no. We have some concepts,
goals, and ideas of where we\'re going, but the details and
 timing are always negotiable.

 Do you mean currently unpublished in TNE or are you referring
 more to minor races, e.g. Vegans, that have never been
 published? If former, depends upon how much detail you\'re
 talking about. What are the Aslan up to in general, we know
 that. How do the Aslan feel about Letterman going to CBS? We
 don\'t know yet.

 This seems like a loaded question. Our answer is yes, but
 you don\'t seem to agree. With regards to the Zhodani issue,
 I don\'t see any problem. Why don\'t you like the poor Sword
 Worlders?

 No, and/but we will.

  Yes, and the illuminati tri-lateral commission is going

 Beyond GDW, there is no such official master cabal HIWG

 design the future history.

 Star systems, people, aliens, lots of stuff.

 We\'ve mapped some of the areas, but I would not say most of
 it. If the campaign starts heading in those directions,
 we\'ll detail them, but we already have plenty of area to
 cover without doing so.

 I kind of like that variation, but the House System is
 pretty set the way it is, so we will not be able to
 consider such a change.  _ Blunt Trauma can be significant
 in some cases, even where a weapon does not penetrate. _

 No we have not, and that system would only apply to
 combat. We prefer a simpler system with fewer exceptions
 and special cases that works for all task resolutions,
 combat and non-combat. You are free to do what you please
 with your games, however.

 If you feel that characters have too many hit points,
 we suggest rolling 1D10 for damage instead of 1D6. This
 is the simplest system for speeding up killing, and we
 suggest it for those groups who want that change. This
 is not, however, a system change or errata. Its just a
 recommended variant for people who don\'t like heroic-style
 combat and don\'t mind creating new PCs all the time.

 Yes, there are some errata on the weapons table, and
 these have been posted, and we will post additions if
 and when they are necessary. However, the laser issue is
 not a misprint. The rules as written are the way we intend
 for lasers to work against metallic/ceramic armor. We suggest
 the following fix for laser damage: All non-metallic,
 non-ceramic armor, in other words, kevlar, ballistic cloth,
 ballistic weave, animal armor consisting of shells, scales,
 or thick hide, etc., is treated as no armor when hit by a
 laser. Armor consisting of metallic or ceramic plates
 uses the rules as they now read. This is an official
 fix, and will be published as such.
 _Email me a land address, and I will send a copy of the
 current errata sheet. _

 There are only so many weapons and items of equipment
 that we could rate for the TNE book, and we certainly
 intended to make many more detailed variants available
 later on. Even God took six days. The Technical Architecture
 book (Fire, Fusion and Steel) which will release in November
 includes rules for designing (among other things) small arms
 of all kinds from the ground up. With this system Traveller
 players can create more weapons detail than perhaps anyone
 will ever need (or maybe even want), and we will publish
 many new, more detailed designs. This design system
 was not complete in time for it to be used to design the
 TNE weapons, so naturally we had to use less detailed "translations."

 the ships over for TNE, I didn\'t notice. That was a
 mistake (and _was_ my  mistake...Mea culpa).

 The J3 Man 3 ratings are corrected in Brilliant Lances

 Actually, we included psi powers because they were a
 well-established concept in the body of of SF literature
 that Marc used as partial inspiration for the game.
 Personally, I think ESP/etc. is a load of bunk, but its
 addition makes for a better game, in my opinion. Besides,
 if we hadn\'t put Psi powers in, how could people argue
 for weeks over the Zhodani? : )

 We have published several RPGs without using \'magic\' &
\'wizards\' as you put it.

 Dave,
 Matt\'s answer to you was incomplete. Matt does not
 consider the present incarnation of Traveller
 (Traveller : The New Era, also known on the TML as TNE,
 The new Error, and other epithets I won\'t go into) to
 be "real" Traveller, and the information he gave to you
 referred to the old, now-out of print Traveller books
 he prefers to the new edition.

 If you are interested in finding out about the newest
 edition of Traveller, call or write GDW (address and
 phone # included somewhere in this message) and ask for
 a catalog. Tell Lori I sent you.

 We stopped printing them because people stopped buying

  I\'m not well acquainted with copyright law (not being

here is one of the usual simple question :) I have:

In the TNE-Rulebook the rules for psionic regeneration states:

"Though the psionics treats himself he has to overcome his own willpower rating
 to do so. The willpower rating is subconscious and can not be suspended by the
 psionic."
(not precisely, but I don\'t have the book with me)

Okay, nice statement, but willpower is a skill, and as such can be developed.
And development is not subconscious. So why can\'t I lower my willpower asset
by my willpower skill?

Example:
Dodo has a Willpower skill of 4 and Int 8 => Willpower asset=12
Dodo is a psionic using regeneration. Using the rules above, you have to
overcome a Willpower asset of 12.

Using my rule above, he has to overcome a willpower of 8, his Int rating,
which is indeed subconscious.

Waiting for suggestions,

Well, it\'s both.  I get pretty tired of people spelling my last name as
`Kellog\'.  I mean, think about it.  You see the spelling on your cereal
box *every* *damn* *morning*.  Just because my great grand uncle decided
to stop preaching and start selling breakfast cereal...!  :-P

There is also the fact that I tend to... react... rather quickly on
occasion.  Though, perhaps 9G would be appropriate if I were merely
dealing with acceleration.

However, I have noticed, that since I started signing things with "2G"
included, my name has been misspelled only two or three times.
(though how someone managed to write `Scott 2G Kelloggg\' is beyond me.)

Quite correct, and imagine as the non-charismatic leader tries to secure
his power while more charismatic vargr come up behind him.  The planet
may be on the verge of civil war...  Vargr are fun.

"Short range" is a relative term.  With each hex representing 600 Mm, it
means that the accuracy of each weapon is very good indeed.  The Star Wars
system is considered completely unworkable, and it only needed to deal with
targets at about 1/1000th the range, and 10000 times slower.

In my experience, either the human ship runs out of missiles and dies, or
the Kafer dies.

In custom-designed games, the tactic of choice (after missiles, of course)
is to have rear-mount weapons and a fast drive.  Oh yeah, and lots of remote
armed drones.  (In fact, the remote drone situation got so bad that we had
to limit numbers to keep the game playable)

I think the main cause of \'plugging away\' is not the weapon ranges, but
the lack of maneuverability of 2300AD ships.

What\'s wrong with that?  Do you have a problem with rotation?  I have
exactly the opposite view - they make rotation too difficult.  They only
justify it with some washy statement that the drives cause \'inertia\'.

If you want swooping and \'graceful\' combat, play a flight sim.  I don\'t
see any reason why space combat should share this property, and I dislike
games that artificially try to introduce it.



Other points:
Why do they include a \'star\' counter and say that ships can move within one
hex of it?  They explicitly state that stutterwarps fail against a \'few
tenths of a G\'.  By my calculations, the closest a stutterwarp-driven ship
can approach a star like our Sun is about 10 hexes.  If it gets any closer,
it can\'t get out (and will fall into the star in about 18 hours.


Why do 2300AD power plants supply such *abyssmal* power/weight ratios?
A current internal combustion engine can supply 1 kW/kg, yet the most
advanced 2300AD military MHD turbine supplies 10 times less.  Considering
that power/mass is a major design factor, why not use petrol engines?
Especially since the cost is about the same.  Worse than that, however, is
the fuel cell technology - it is exceeded by a factor of 3 in power/mass,
is more expensive, and consumes more fuel than current technology.

They ought to run the things on the same LMS batteries that power the laser
guns.  A 10 MW MHD costs at least 0.7 MLv and masses at least 100 tons.
10 MW of LMS batteries costs 1700 Lv (0.0017 MLv) and masses 330 kg (which
is 0.33 tons).  For the same price (0.7 MLv) you get 4200 MW of peak power
massing 140 tons.  Energy capacity is also good - 7 MJ/kg, halfway between
MHD and Fuel Cells.  So, *why not*?

What\'s *really* fun is if your character is a high charisma Vargr and you
need or want to visit this planet, but don\'t want to stay there, either as
its new ruler or as the "guest" of the current one.  Other characters should
consider selecting one of the prospective new leaders, lending some sort of
support in the forthcoming conflict (either as mercenaries, gun-runners or
propaganda broadcasters, for example) and then using the planet as a base -
at least until the next change of leader. ;-)

For one thing, they won\'t have staircases.  Real Droyne can fly.  You should
not be surprised to see an entrance to the building on the third floor.  They
probably have a ground floor entrance and an elevator for the wing-impaired,
though.

This may make for a strange game, but at least it\'s logically consistent
with StutterWarp physics.

Imagine tryig to hit a target from more than one Hex away, when that target
is travelling FTL using stutterwarp. *long* before the light from your laser
arrives in the same general vicinity, he\'ll have moved to a different
location.

Missiles work by getting as close as they can to the target vehicle; they
then *spray space* with as many laser beams as the missile can generate. If
the missile is lucky, *one* of those beams will actually intersect with the
target, causing damage. That\'s what a to-hit roll is actually calculating;
you\'re checking to see if one (out of many) laser beams actually passes
through the target\'s current location.

Making beam weapons have 3 hex range may make the game more playable to you,
but it\'s no longer realistic (according to the 2300AD universe).

You really don\'t understand StutterWarp physics, do you? :-)

StutterWarping ships don\'t change their real-space vector in any way; they
simply "teleport" a short distance away, at a rapid cycle rate, giving
effective FTL travel. StutterWarp ships don\'t "accelerate" or "decellerate";
they simply start and stop moving. StutterWarp movement doesn\'t have
momentum or inertia; StutterWarp ships can move instantly and stop on a dime.
(This is why Traveller players objected so strongly to their introduction
into the TNE universe, btw).

As for changing facings: This is where things start to get nebulous...

First of all, we believe that this is currently done using real-space
thrusters. So, it should still be possible to do "180\'s in space"; you just
can\'t do them instantaneously.

Secondly, since StutterWarp doesn\'t change real-space vectors, we believe
that you should be able to warp in one direction while your ship is pointing
in a completly different direction. Of course, you can restrict this by
claiming that the StutterWarp field is aligned with the ships hull, so that
you can only travel "forward". We\'re still arguing that one... :-)

We\'ve played lots of Star Cruiser combat. The 2300 physics do lead to some
common tactics; they just aren\'t like anything you\'ve ever seen before... :-)

  I haven\'t had time to really play through Brilliant
Lances yet, but here\'s some notes and errata that came
to mind while reading  through:

It does NOT detail the Regency\'s  150-ton  "strech scout":P

It  DOES detail some of  my favorites  from FASA\'s "Adventure
Class  Ships"  series :) :)



The Aurora class clipper (Technical Booklet pg 44) is listed
as "tech level 12" construction. However, in  certain
configurations, it is said to be capable of up to Jump-5.
Maximum  jump for TL-12 is J-3. If they use salvaged
TL-14 J-drives, it should be stated explicitly.
If the J-drives are of TL-12 construction, it should be
stated that maximum jump is 3 parsecs, but fuel storage
allows (depending on configuration) for an additional
jump-2 without refueling.


Controls (Technical booklet pg 3): I can find no size or
tech level requirement for what controls should be used.
As it  stands, you can build a TL-15  ship with TL-5
controls with  no  penalty, and in fact the low-tech
controls cost less in both power and Credits, so under
the current rules  as stated, low-tech controls make
more sense.
  Suggested correction: factor in a control multiplier
for control type, similar to how computers have a control
modifier, in the calculation of crew  requirements.
I haven\'t had time to try out specific suggestions, but
this seems to be the easiest way to attack  the  problem.
All the ships published so far are from TL-12 to 15, so
would use either dynamic linked or holographic linked
controls, so the multiplier could be normalized (=1)
for either of these.

The "Lackland Sons" scenario (rules of play, pg 31)
takes place at Yaggoth in Reavers\' Deep. If this is
Yaggoth/Urlaqqash (0110)/Reavers\' Deep (2530), it is
a member of the Carrillian Assembly, a 20-world
subsector-sized polity wedged in between the Imperium
and the Solomani Confederation, not a member of the
Imperium/Daibei.
  Presumably, all references to the "Imperial" side/player
should be taken to mean the Carrillian side/player.
Also presumably, the Assembly had some of it\'s own problems
which prevent it\'s own heavy units from taking care
of the Aslan in short order.


Also included in BL is version 1.0 of the errata sheet.:/
I take it further versions will be out.

quite exciting and fun.  I\'ve played in quite a few battles
and have enjoyed them immensely, when I survived.

However, as already stated by others, there are a lot of
inconsistencies.

1. Top of my list.  You control a missile using some sort of
   communication device which operates at light (or less) speed
   so when telling a missile that is 10 hexes away to target a
   ship you are facing the same (if not worse) time delay as
   if you were firing one of your energy weapons from the ship
   at the target from the 10 hex distance.

2. When 2 or more DETONATION missiles enter your hex you have the option
   of using your energy weapons to shoot them.  Assuming you miss
   and that the missile owner detonates only ONE of the missiles
   this phase you automaticly get a FREE point defence shot ONLY at
   the DETONATing missile.

3. A ship CAN DETECT a relay in a missile triggering and aim and fire
   all facing weapons at the target before the relay closes and the
   missile detonates.

4. DETONATION Missiles can fire at targets in ANY of the 7 hexes
   around or in the one they detonated in.  No facing restrictions
   for this baby.

5. A ship can go from 0 to 9 movement instantaneously and yet this speed
   and agility is not factored into the weapon targetting routines.  Hmm
   actually its been a while since I last looked at the rules, I may be
   wrong on this one.

6. Ships can\'t mask friendly ships from enemy fire in any way.  You park
   your Froggy Carrier (the one that blotts out half the sky) between your
   small freighter and that nasty enemy incoming fighter and you still
   can\'t prevent him from shooting the freighter to pieces.  It\'s like in
   HIGHGUARD where you park an imperial heavy fighter right next to your
   stationary ship (or in your cargo hold) and the computer difference
   alone (9 vs 0) makes it impossible for the little guy to hit your ship
   at all.  Ho hum.

The game is fine so long as you don\'t look too close at the reasonig
behind the mechanics.

Muir,
About your changes to starcruiser acceleration, decellaration and turning:
I don\'t know the game but as far as I know the propulsion system in use is
only (?) the stutter warp.  Since Stutter Warp does not involve moving in
in the classical sense (the ship jumps from one place to another) i don\'t see
how you can introduce (de)acceleration.  The warp drive is simply active or
inactive.  On rotation the effect will depend on one aspect of the stutter
drive I\'m not familiar with:  Does changing direction of stutter movement
involve rotating the ship in the desired direction?

2.
The idea for converting the 2300 universe to GURPS seems interesting.
However I\'ve been doing the opposite.  There are three reasons for this
choice: (a) the main problem with 2300 rules is that they are terribly
incomplete.  Using the task system it is very easy to adapt GURPS rules.
(b) I don\'t like many aspects of GURPS like character generation and combat
with fire weapons (I remember at least one instance where GURPS is quite
unbelivable: the target range/speed modifiers).  And (c) 2300ad as a few good
points like the task system which is much more elegant than the gurps system.
The combat system is also very effective for the kind of combat the I use most:
few people shooting at each other with handguns in the corridors of some space
station or ship.
Still I only played GURPS a couple of times so I may be wrong about its
shortcomings.  When you have tried your adaptations let me know the results.

perused it and it left me rather confused on the history.

WAS Strephon the real Strephon? Survival Margin seems to imply that he
was, but the Regency business seems to imply that he wasn\'t. What was
Project Longbow anyway, and who was the "new empress" he mentioned? Why
did he send his son(?) to the Domain and what became of him?

How did Norris die? Is he dead at all?

What the heck happened to Core Sector? It\'s a big black smear now.

Are any of the
"major players" of the Rebellion still around?

I ask these things because I tend to run far-ranging campaigns and sooner
or later players will want to know "Gee... is Margaret still alive? How
about her kids? Grandkids?" and so forth. Sooner or later they are going
to try to go to Core Sector. Has GDW put out another product (besides
Survival Margin and the basic rules) that answers any of these questions?

 ... I must admit that in my rabid state that possibility never occured to me.
   I picked up so much bad Karma from my original mail that I caught flu bad
   enough to keep me in bed for a week.
    It was well past the bounds of good taste to suggest that GDW might be
   moving into the SpaceOrk zone ( amongst the oldie - ie 20+ year olds- RPGers
   around here it\'s fighting talk to suggest they use Games Workshop products)
   but that was one of the big worries about TNE, that GDW might go down the
       path of GW. The guns get bigger, then the breasts (both sexes), clothes
   get more revealing, bad guys get uglier, then the next thing you know the
   melee weapons are motorised and the game boxes are too big to fit in a
   carrier bag, not that you buy them \'cos you\'re too embarassed by the art
   work and can\'t fight your way through the horde of 12 year olds in the shop
   talking about the correct paint for the Psyho Elf Leader With Nebula Cannon.
 ......ARRRGGHHHH.  Sorry, still feverish from the flu.
   OK, so I trust GDW not to add spikes to Regency Marine Battle Dress,
   (I think :)) it\'s just that having to live in GW country makes me suspect
   the worst when a company brings out a new, flashier version of a game. My
   problem, not yours.

    Anyway, while in bed I was (by coincidence) looking over 2300 and Star
   Cruiser, (I like most of the background AND rules) and noticed (another)
   suspect rule in Star Cruiser- the fuel consumtion for reaching orbit.
   I\'m not talking about the fact that a smaller engine gets you there faster,
   it\'s simply the fuel consumption I\'m unsure about- it requires 1/6th the
   ships mass in Liq. H/O, which seems a little too low for a system like that.

    Does anyone know what the max ISP could be for such an engine, and has
   anyone dealt with interface ships in more detail, ie. VTOL systems, HOTOL
   systems being unusable in some atmospheres?  The whole area is
   a bit bare for a game whose image a partly based on Dropships carrying
   troops too and from planet.

    Also on 2300, concerning GURPS, I\'ve not done any conversions but I tried
   doing a 2300 Hovertank in GURPS Vehicles rules, and it is a reasonablely
   equivalent.  The use of that information depends on how you feel on using
   Hovercraft for such purposes (10 tons and turns like a whale in flight),
   it is probably more sensible to think of them as Vectored Thrust vehicles
   with a hovercraft option to save fuel.
    I\'ve got some guidelines for 3G to 2300 conversion I worked out if anyone
   is interested (or I\'m interested if anyone has a better version...)
   and, finally, I worked out that in Star Cruiser, a hex scale of 50 000Km
   gives about the correct ship speed for the .0001G limit, so why did they
   make the hexes 600 000Km? Why did I waste my time working this out? I blame
   Virus.

I\'m so interested that I already have a semi-complete conversion which I made

books I have (converted by partially redesigning them using BTRC\'s Guns, Guns,

on an alternative character generation system for GURPS/2300AD which is
slightly inspired by good ol\' Traveller (mostly based around first building
an 18-year-old on a combination of point expenditure and dice rolls, and then
optionally taking that 18-year-old through any of a variety of careers --
academic, military, ordinary civilian -- to gather experience); this subsystem

I intend to use this to run a Big Campaign starting some time during this
schoolyear (probably just after Christmas, since there\'s some stuff left to
be done as well as some external circumstances) -- a campaign with two separate
player groups (one being composed of military personnell fighting you-know-what

as freelance troubleshooters).  I\'ve already got a number of interested

Not quite - the 2300AD combat rules seem to assume that the combats will be
played out inside a star system (where the stutterwarp speed drops below
light).  The drive numbers work out to 20 Mm/s for each warp efficiency.
You would need a very light ship indeed to get to lightspeed (300 Mm/s).

I think they just wimped out because they didn\'t want to handle the
special considerations of active FTL combat.  Just like they didn\'t want
to handle inertia, rotation or 3D.  Oh well - it\'s their game, and if they
want to keep it simplified, that\'s their business.

Not according to my reading of the rules - more seriously, you couldn\'t get
enough power.  If you want an X in 10 chance of hitting something on the
order of 10s of metres across in a space 600,000,000 metres across, you\'d
need a *lot* of lasers.  A few MW just *isn\'t* enough.

I think it represents exactly what it seems like - the chance that your
targetting systems correctly predicted the exact path of the target and
hit it with a single shot.  For beam weapons of such low power as found in
2300AD, it\'s better to put all the energy of a 1 minute turn into a single
shot, than to spray the target with negligible flashes.

Yes, one of the best things about them, in my opinion.  I just wish I had
more information on the restrictions (like why you can\'t have 2 drives,
only one of which is active at any given time, and more about discharging
and maximum range, and ...).

If this is the case, why can\'t turning be done simultaneously with movement?
As it is, rotation takes away movement points.  The only reason I can see
is that rotation is impossible while the stutterwarp drive is running.
This seems unlikely, for exactly the reason that stutterwarp doesn\'t change
real-space vectors.

Why can\'t the stutterwarp drive be mounted largely inside a freely-rotating
sphere?  Then you rotate the sphere to warp in a different direction.  This
should be faster than using gas thrusters (or whatever) to turn the whole
ship.

I don\'t dispute the difficulty of trying to hit something with a laser in
space, but the current system requires so much suspension of disbelief as
it is that I don\'t have a problem with adding a little more to make the
game more playable.

If you\'re willing to assign arbitrary limits to the numbers of missiles why
not arbitrarily extend the range of lasers?

My concern was mostly with small craft that only carry a few missiles and
usually finish the fight with an exchange of laser fire.  What I find
happens is that the two close to the same hex and then take turns rolling
for position and exchaning broadsides.  The problem is that the scale of
the game is so large and the range of lasers so short that when it comes to
the tactical maneuvering of exchaning laser fire the game resorts to
rolling dice for orientation.  Also, by limiting turn radiuss and
acceleration and deceleration it makes it more difficult for two ships, or
more often, two fighters to sit on top of each other.

Actually I like the idea of "pseudo-inertia" and have chosen to place
greater emphasis on it, for the above reasons.  I, frankly, don\'t find it
any more absurd than the prospect of a stutterwarp drive itself.

This was probably the wrong way to say what I was trying to express.  My
feeling is that it is more interesting when the ships are actually maneuver-
ing to get a shot on each other than merely sitting one counter on top of
the other rolling for position and firing.  Wouldn\'t you rather see the
jockeying for position that roll represents?  I would.

Maybe MHD turbines are inefficient because they are trying to reduce their
signature?  I don\'t know, all your points are quite good.  I believe some
- -one made a similar point about Traveller.  He found that it was more
cost and space efficient to use the batteries used with black globes than
to use a power plant.  Go figure.  As much as we try to make out games
_science_ fiction they still require an enormous suspension of disbelief.-

<stuff about missles deleted>

First of all, stutterwarp combat takes place inside starsystems where
the stutterwarp drive is limited to less than "FTL."  Secondly, your point
about light lag is true of *any* space combat system, not just Star Cruiser.
The common justification is that it is possible to compute the limited number
of possible locations for the ship because of the limits of the ships drive
and the constraints of inertia.

I do think that my changes make the game more playable, but I disagree about
the lack of realism.

Actually, I think I do understand StutterWarp physics :-)  According to
_The Science of Star Cruiser_ section Star Cruiser: "The activity of the drive
itself at high cyclic rates produces a gyroscopic effect that is referred to
as pseudo-momentum.  It is not true momentum in the Newtonian sense, but
limits the magnitude of immediate changes in direction and velocity."  This
is why stutterwarp ships cannont make infinite changes of facing during
a combat turn.  I have chosen to make this effect more pronounced because
I think it keeps combat more mobile

As to the realism of extending the range, I think by limiting stutterwarp
mobility, and and therefore the possible locations of an enemy ship we can
justify extending the range of lasers.  While we\'re discussing the limits of
lasers, however, I have to point out that missles are under some pretty
serious restrictions of the same kind.  A missle has to detect a ship, send
this data to the mother ship, wait for the remote pilot to respond, wait
for the message to make it back to the missle, and _then_ fire!  By whick
time the enemy ship is nowhere near where it was when the missile first
detected it.  I suppose we could justify this because missiles "spray space
with lasers" as Harald put it, but I think we have to recognize that
space combat games, or at least Star Cruiser, are only "realistic" as long
as we are willing to suspend disbelief on a number of points.  Since this
is what rpg\'s are ultimately about, this shouldn\'t be a problem :-).

	A little while ago, we were all grumbling about alternative weapons

called "Machinetools". There are some really neat alternative weapons in that
supplement with great detail. They were designed using \'Guns Guns Guns\' design
rules (which I don\'t have, but the designs are standard!). For those interested
the series begins in bundle file \'bun228\' if I remember correctly, and
continues up until bundle \'bun238\'.

	And a question to Bertil:

	How exactly do the Fail numbers in that series work? Sounds like

	Oh, and how many editions of Machinetools did you put out? I found

It\'s been a long time since I\'ve played Star Cruiser, but it seems to
me one way to justify limiting mobility and extending range would be
to make the hexes smaller and the turns shorter.  I can\'t think offhand
of anything else this would seriously break.

"Remote Pilot" is a bit strained, really.  It seems clear that your
missile pretty much has to do its own targetting, with some
supplemental data from the mothership. "Firing it" should really
amount to saying yes when the missile brain asks permission to
explode.  Or arming it and saying, fire when ready.  [The targetting
computer on the mothership would serve to continuously extrapolate
out-of-date information up to "now", for tac-board display.]

That would be me.  :)  Anyway, it\'s slightly more complicated than that...
Cost, space/volume, EM signature, and duration all have to be factored in to
the design.  (Aside from bending the rules.)  It\'s worth noting that for
"long-term" conflicts (those over the combat duration of battery/capacitor
equiped fighters) those same fighters that fared so well for the first 20-odd
turns will have a decided disadvantage...  (So bring LOTS of them!  [always a
good idea, anyway])

It all boils down to tactics, I guess.  (I happen to prefer the jump-tender
approach: blaze in (hide the jump-tender), kick butt, regroup, and split -
letting someone else mop-up.) Better yet is a defensive action - blow the
invading snots away with imbedded defenses that they can\'t attack.

ObTNEconcept: TCS style conflicts between TL 8+ pocket-empires.  I think it\'d
be a blast, especially with relic technology involved (Can you imagine the
maintenance costs?  Can you imagine the benefits?)

Well, I\'ve got it and I, for one, am impressed.

HOWEVER...

How come there aren\'t any rules for Missile bays?

What\'s the Mj per mass for a laser at TL X?  How come you can\'t put a
TL 15 laser system in a bay (and, presumabely, get thyself a 2500 Mj or 5000
Mj laser system?)

I never examined the starship rules carefully in the TNE rules, so the lack
of Fusion and Plasma guns as starship weapons didn\'t bother me.  Anybody
know why they\'ve been yanked?  Ditto for Particle Accelerator Barbettes...

How come all the "variant" ship types (ie, a variant Beowulf *admittedly*
not as useful!)?

I had thought some of these questions would be answered by the ship
construction system, but I guess not.  Anybody know if the Technical
Architecture Manual is going to have design stuff that deals with the
Laser Bay-type questions?

Oh, yeah:  What\'s the *volume* of a missle?  It masses 7 tonnes and "...may
be carried in cargo spaces...", but I\'m having no luck reverse engineering
it from the turret and barbette volumes...

Consider:

turret vol:42 kl. loaded mass 28.4 tonnes; 300000km Lasercom at TL8
is .110 kl and masses .22 tonnes.  One workstation: 7 kl and .2 tonnes
mass.  <Not weight, as the table on page 12 suggests :)>  So, left over
to contain the missiles is:  34.89 kl and 27.98 tonnes.  2 missiles take
up 14 tonnes mass, leaving 13.98 -> 14 tonnes left.  (ie, each missile,
and attendent handling equipment ends up massing 2x as much as one
missile)...And with a vol of 2.5 x missile mass in kl gives 2.5 x 7 x 2
= 35 kl.

All well and good...

Barbette vol:  84 kl loaded mass 70.4; 300000km Lasercom at TL 8
is .110 kl and masses .22 tonnes.  Terminal: 7 kl and .2 tonnes.
Missiles and attendent equip take 76.89 kl and 69.89 tonnes.  Assuming
the 5 missiles take up 2 x # missiles x mass, this gives us 5 x 7 x 2 = 70
tonnes (correct) and assuming vol is 2.5 x missile mass gives 2.5 x 5 x 7
 = 87.5 kl != 77 kl :/

BUT:  2.2 x 5 x 7 = 77 kl && 2.2 x 7 x 2 == 30.8 != 35kl

Even if one of those kludges had worked, Do we then assume that exactly
half of the computed volume is missile and half is "other equipment"?
(ie, 1.25 or 1.1 x the missile mass, resulting in 8.75 kl or 7.7 kl
missiles, respectively...)

And what if you put in a TL *15* turret, and thus use a 300000km
lasercom that only displaces .007 kl and masses .014 tonnes?

Anybody? Anybody?

  If the missiles work as in TNE they are powered by a nuke so the energy
will not be an issue. A 1kt charge can power 42000 100,000,000 joule beams
(although this could be reduced to one tenth or less because all energy won\'t
 impact the xray rods)

  The fail number is taken directly from 3G 2nd ed and is the percentage
risk that a single shot will fail to fire for some reason. I was planning
to include a table on how to determine if it was a dud, jam, critical or
explosion, but never got that far.

  The thing that I hadn\'t solved was how to do this for bursts (other than to
roll for each round fired...) but in a d20 system it is possible to recompute
a straight chance for each length of burst.

  Checking my files I have 5 files about (in order revolvers, pistols, rifles,
brinn weapons and one named \'extra\') and that\'s it. The chain of events as
I remember it was that the first series I put out gave birth to mumblings
about that the weapons were too heavy, so I had to remake all of them, and
in the middle of this Guns! Guns! Guns! 3rd edition came out, and after I
made the change people started to talk about that MegaT was on the way out.

  The trouble when doing this is that you have one weapon at several TL\'s
that uses several different type of ammunitions, and each type of ammo will
have a different performance on each TL.

collecting on alien designs.  Some of it has appeared in the TML
before, but I\'ve rewritten bits of it.  Copyright 1993 Scott
Kellogg

Question:  Just how do the different alien races design their
control panels.  We kinda take it for granted that they are
different, but just how different are they?  For simplicity\'s
sake I just took a look at pilot stations.

FLIGHT CONTROLS

SOLOMANI  (start off simple right?)
     Solomani (and most Imperial) flight controls generally
consist of stick, throttle, and rudder pedals.  The stick is
usually mounted in the center of the console, but is sometimes on
the left side, while the right hand generally controls the
throttle.  This allows the co-pilot or navigator (generally
seated on the right) to be able to reach the throttle.  If the
pilot were incapacitated, the co-pilot can easily take control.
If the stick is on the left side, it and the throttle are mounted
in the arms of the acceleration couch.  This allows the pilot to
rest his arms on the chair.  This can be nice when you don\'t have
inertial compensators working.
     On most ships, especially fighters, all combat funtions are
mounted on the stick and throttle.  This allows a pilot to
conduct all combat operations without having to move his hands to
different controls.  This design philosophy is known as HOTAS.
(Hands On Throttle And Stick)
     Darrians tend to use Solomani control design philosophy,
though with a greater emphisis on center mounted sticks.  This is
because of the high proportion of ambidextrousness and left
handedness in Darrian gene pools.

VILANI
     Vilani controls are a bit more automated.  Auto pilots tend
to be a bit more sophisticated (and are heavily relied on)  The
control lay out is on the clumsy side.  Design engineers opted for
a single design to ease training of pilots and to avoid their
having to study their ship to understand what is going on.  Thus
the same control panel exists on the Vilani Fat Trader as exists
on their most sophisticated fighters.  This greatly reduces stress
on pilots as the panel they learn to fly with in Dad\'s Air/Raft is
identical to the one they might fly in the Imperial VF-102 Rippers
Advanced Fighter Wing.  The compromise design is a good one, but
any compromise in engineering tends to lessen performance.
     Vilani pilots are generally seated to the right of the copilot
allowing the copilot the use of his or her right hand for central
control panels common to pilot and copilot thus freeing the pilot
of some of the awkward control spacings during critical maneuvers.
     Vilani attitude controls look like a cross between a control
yoke and motorcycle handle bars.  Rudder pedals are not present as
they are in Solomani designs, and yaw control is linked to the
handle bars.  The bars control yaw in a similar manner to
motorcycle bars.  (This makes a cross controlled \'slip\' maneuver
somewhat more difficult in Vilani aircraft)  But it simplifies the
controls for most normal flights.  The throttle is mounted on the
left handle bar as if it were a motorcycle.
     All Vilani aircraft have cross control landing gear.  While
advanced controls would allow for high speed taxiing, Vilani Air
and Starports are simply not built to allow high speed taxiing.
Strict ground speed limits are vigorously enforced by Port
Authority at Vilani ports as offenders will often roll off the
tight curves and narrow tarmac and sink into soft ground.


IMPERIAL
     Imperial designs tend to vary from region to region, but tend
to be a fusion of Vilani and Solomani designs.  The actual design
used seems to be a function of proximity to Terra or Vland, but
that is not the only factor as many regions were settled far from
their point of origin.  Example:  The Spinward Marches, though far
from Terra, has a high percentage of Solomani racial and cultural
stock and tends to follow Solomani design patterns.


ZHODANI
     Almost all Zhodani pilots come from the noble ranks.  Flight
controls for their ships are open for flicking.  Thus the psi-
trained Zhodani pilot may change the ship\'s attitude, throttle
settings, and weapons by flicking.  Special safe guards are in
place to prevent outside psionic interference in the piloting of
the ship.  Up to and including a psi-shield surrounding the
pilot\'s station.  This is demonstrated in the Shivva class patrol
frigate and her fighters.  The fighter pilots are open to
telepathic contact from their flight controller, but the flight
controller can not affect flight controls of the fighter.
     There also exist manual controls for all craft.  Not all
pilots are nobles.  The enlisted pilots use the manual controls.
Also proles operating grav vehicles and the like have a need for
manual controls.  While one would think that manual flight
controls would be of lesser quality because of the depencance on
psi-controls, this is far from the truth.  With their wealth of
insight into the human mind, data presentation among the Zhodani
is a fine art.  Screens with flight data are very well presented
in such a manner so as not to swamp the pilot with data.
However, manual controls do tend to recieve secondary attention
in Zhodani cockpit design.
     Controls are generally mounted on the arms of the flight
acceleration couch.  The stick is generally mounted on the left,
and the throttle on the right.  Often times, with a Psionic pilot
in command, the controls are stowed inside the chair arms and,
with a press of a switch, can be deployed in emergencies.
     Yaw control is subsumed into the stick in a rotational
manner.  Turn the stick to the right and the ship yaws right.
This last is a reflection of how manual flight controls are
considered secondary.


ASLAN
     Aslan flight controls are a set of half gloves set into the
arms of the acceleration couch.  They look somewhat like large
balls on the ends of the chair arms.  The hand is placed atop the
ball in deep indentations in it for the hand.  (Picture a big wax
ball with a hole the shape of your hand melted into it.)  (Rather
like Hiver controls with deeper indendations)
     This design meshes with the Aslan philosophy that the ship
is but an extension of the pilot.  The \'gloves\' make the ship
part of him.  The ship follows the motion of the hand.  The
extension of the dew-claw fires the ships weapons on ship\'s where
the pilot is in control of the guns.  A similar control is for
the aiming and firing of ship\'s weapons.
     Attitude control is controlled by both hands on separate
controls.  With roll and pitch on one hand and yaw on the other.
Throttle control is in foot pedals.


VARGR
     Vargr flight controls do not follow general lines making it
difficult to generalize.  But, their control systems tend to be
similar to human designs at least where hands are concerned.
Their degitigrade stance makes their foot controls quite
different.  Rudder pedals are rare, and yaw control tends to be
absorbed into the stick as Vilani and Zhodani designs.  Psionic
controls are rare, but are more common among Gveug and Aekhu
designs.
     Aslan control systems are sometimes copied by Vargr.


DROYNE
     Droyne controls are one of the most unusual.  A wide variety
of psionic controls are also encompassed under Droyne designs, but
primary flight control input is taken from the pilots wings.
Attitude controls are mounted beside the pilot.  At Tech Level 8
and above, they are low level infra-red sensors that sense the
position of the pilot\'s wings and tail.  Though the Droyne
generally have great difficulty in flying, they do still possess
the equipment for rudimentary flight, and the instincts to do
so(though buried).  To raise the nose of the ship, the pilot would
increase the angle of attack of his wings.  The sensors see the
change in wing angle and perform the maneuver.  If the pilot raises
his right wing, the ship will bank left, and so on.
     Below Tech Level 8 controls consist of mechanical linkages
which are stapped to the pilot\'s wings and tail.
     Throttle controls are more conventional:  a lever mounted in
the center of the panel.
     The Ael Yael, while unable to build their own ships will
commonly adapt control panels to this type of configuration.
     While Dolphin crewed ships are uncommon, flight control
systems have been built to their specifications using these type of
body position sensors for control of attitude and propulsion
systems.


HIVER
     The Hiver controls are balls mounted with control studs.
This is the form best suited \'ergonomically` to their limbs.
Hiver controls are very difficult for anyone but a hiver to
operate.  Thus, many of their ships employ dual control panels,
to allow for a member race to use them.  The Federation Member
control panels are similar to Aslan designs, though the
indentation in the control globes is not so deep as the Aslan
half gloves.  This arrangement allows the hiver better control
than he would mangage with a Solomani design.

K\'KREE
     The K\'Kree have probably the most bazarre arrangement of
attitude control.  The pilot lies in a couch arrangement with his
four hooves touching the floor.  By leaning in one direction or
another, the ship\'s attitude is changed.  It looks somthing like
flying a hang glider.  To roll left, lean left.  To lower the
nose:  lean forward.  To pull up:  lean back.  Yaw control is by
twisting the body to the right or left.  Throttle control is by
hand levers.
     The leaning method of attitude control dates back to the
earliest K\'kree experiments in flight.  Their earliest gliders
used this method of steering, then their primitive aircraft.
After that, it was too entrenched in K\'kree engineering
philosophy to ever change.

NAVAL ARCHITECTURE

     Human ship designs (above Tech Level 9) tend to evoke the
image of ocean going ships.  Relatively few decks exist, but those
decks tend to be large and flat, parallel to the direction of
travel, making the image of a ocean liner travelling though space.
This design, while comfortable for human living, is inefficient in
terms of energy.  It requires that the ship must maintain both
internal gravity and inertial compensation during engine burns.
Zhodani designs tend to disdain the use of staircases due to the
fact that their taller build make stair climbing more
uncomfortable.  However, gravitic lifts adequately compensate for
this.
     At Tech Level 9, inertial compensation and artificial gravity
are not available.  Thus, the ship tends to resemble a skyscraper
with many floors all perpendicular to the direction of travel.  In
this manner, the engine thrust provides the `artificial gravity\'.
     Large military ships (including Zhodani), and designs that do
not land, take advantage of this towerlike structure.  Thus, such
a ship may divert power from the gravitic and inertial compensation
systems in an emergency without disrupting operations overmuch.
(Example:  Azhanti High Lighting).
     Droyne ships all tend to follow the towerlike structure.
Droyne are far more comfortable with the more three dimensional
layout of the tower.  A common design feature on Droyne vessels are
long low gravity tubes which run the length of the ship.  These are
not lift tubes per se, but flight tubes.  The lower gravity of the
tubes allows even those incapable of flight the ability to fly
easily but they are not so disoriented by the total lack of
gravity.  Also of note is the fact that Droyne maintain the
internal gravity of their ships at about half that of a Human ship,
as that is one of their "G\'s".

BTW, whoever designed the Type M Subsidized Liner\'s deck plans
clearly gave no thought to this.  The ship never lands, and has
maneuver drives of only 1 G of acceleration.  Yet, the layout
requires inertial compensation AND internal gravity.  If he\'d
rotated the deck plans 90 degrees, both problems would have been
simplified.  (sigh)

Important note: The smallest jump drive possible, at any tech level, is
2 cubic metres in volume.

Now the way that the volume of a jump drive is calculated is (1 + jump)%
of the volume of the hull. This implies that you can fit a jump-1 drive
into an 8 ton hull (ie. 112 cubic metres) and you can fit a jump-6 into
a 3 ton hull.

This is:

a) A mistake - should it perhaps read 2 tons (28 cubic metres)?

b) A _major_ retcon.

Even if it should read 2 tons, this means that ships under 100 tons
displacement can be jump capable - a 30 displacement ton ship can hold
a jump 6 drive.

Can anyone at GDW clarify?

On the other hand, the game itself seems quite good - I haven\'t yet got
to play it, but it is well-presented, the rules are fairly clear, the
ship design sequence is welcome (although why the 18 pages couldn\'t have
been squeezed into the TNE rulebook, I don\'t know).

There are a couple of other minor quibbles - for instance in the design
sequence there tends to be very little description of equipment and materials.
This is OK for veterans who know what Dynamic Linked controls, Bonded
Superdense etc. are, but it could be confusing for a new player.

What about the whole "holo-dynamic" concept, where the controls are

MegaTrav (realistic or not :) was that every modern ship had such systems.
Certainly such systems are nearly in our reach now (although whether we\'d
trust such a system built with today\'s technology is another question
entirely...)...Of course, ours wouldn\'t be holographic :/

Oh, yeah:  Although the "position sensing" idea is neat, wouldn\'t the

A couple of days ago I supported that stutter warp should not be limited by
conventional inertia rules (ie (de)acceleration).  But after lookong at the
dogmatic fashion people are supporting this idea I would like to point out
that stutter warp is a completelly imaginary device.  there is not a single
experiment or even theory (at least that I know of) that deals with the concept
of ftl travel.
What this means is that it is equally valid to say that a stutter warp ship
can go to full warp instantly as it is valid to say that it has to
accelerate to get there.  there may be some kind of resistence imposed by
the \'warp medium\' or whatever.

I just finished reading the latest tml messages and would like to make a
comment on the use of detonation missiles:
As far as I understood the standard procedure for using a missile consists in
sending it to the target, receiving the info relayed by the missile and then
telling it to fire.
Since distances are pretty big the missile would have to work on his own,
following the target between relaying the information and receiving the order
to detonate.
Another problem this procedure posses is that when relaying information to
the remote pilot (operator seems more convinient) the missile becomes quite
visible to the enemy.  Using of very tight beam doesn\'t improve this for 2
reasons: (i) again because of the large distances involved the remote
operator\'s ship will move between the moment the missile relays the message and
the moment the ship receives it.  therefore the beam couldn\'t be all that
tight.  And (ii) since the missile is suppose to infiltrate enemy \'territory\'
the message could easilly be picked up by a ship (other than the target).

It seems that a better (safer) use of missiles would be to rely on
preprograming and expert systems that locally control the missile\'s actions.
The missile could still receive new orders but it would never transmit (unless
ordered to).  Tasks like identification of targets would be left to other
probes (note: these probes could tell the missiles where to fire at).

What do you think of this?

Hum.  I don\'t see much of human anatomy in something like say:  The
Space Shuttle.  Nor do I see it in a Saturn V.  Nor do I see it in a
Sapwood ICBM...  Ariane...  Mir... Skylab... Abrams MBT... F-14 Tomcat
Nimitz class carrier...  Los Angeles class fast attack sub...  MiG-29
Fulcrum...

The laws of engineering don\'t change, vertibrates need a good internal
structure, and so are governed by those laws.  But the things we build
are not constrained to only those solutions which have been solved by
evoloution.  Humans and other advanced alien societies do not adapt
themselves to fit their environment, they adapt their environment to fit
themselves.  (For the most part)  A space ship is not bound by evolution.

Cubic structure, most commonly found on earth, is nicely easy to build,
but I don\'t think that there is anything intrinsically cubic about human
beings.  (Though I Do know humans who are best described as squares...)

But yes, body structure Will have an influence on the design of
environment.  If you are only 1.5 meters tall, you don\'t need 2.6 meters
of head room on your decks.  If you have wings, you will design spaces
in such a way that flight is comfortable.  If you have a tail, you will
cartainly have a space for said tail designed into your chairs.  But
these differences will primarily be shown in how work stations and
floor plans will work out.

The only real descriptions we have to work from are the descriptions of
the Ancients stuff as found in, Twilight\'s Peak, Secret of the Ancients
and DGP\'s little thing on Antiquity.  Now the interesting thing about
those, I would say, is that the function of Ancient Artifacts should be
a lot more self evident to a Droyne than it would be to a human.  Think
about THAT.  Also, in Secret of the Ancients, we have a good descrption
of an Ancient\'s starship.  THAT is an example of Droyne Architecture.
So maybe Droyne Architecture IS completely weird from human (Imperial)
eyes.

I would suggest that the Zhodani seem to know a lot more about the
Droyne than the Imps do.  Their jump grids are similar.  Zhos use
triangles, while Droyne use hexagons.  The patterns are very similar.
Take 6 triangles, glue em together and you\'ve got a Hexagonal Droyne
grid.  (Maybe theres something weird psionically about a hex or triagonal
grid).

Speaking of Jump drives, I haven\'t got Brilliant Lances yet, but I hope
that it was NOT a misprint about a 2 cubic meter jump drive being the
minimum rather than 2*(whatever a displacement ton is).  A 2 cubic meter
jump drive will now allow such a drive to be installed into the enlarged
TNE missiles, so we can now build Jump torpedoes again.

It would be nice to plug the holes in the game BUT that\'s not how the
game works.  I believe that AI type missiles are mentioned in one of the
Mags for 2300AD and that they are WORSE than remote controlled ones at
hitting the target.

What ranges are we using in TNE for the TNE DETONATION missiles and how

Sol\'s 0.1 G gradient (maneuver efficiency cutoff) is at 11.6E6 km =
350 hexes

Sol\'s 0.1 mG gradient (FTL efficiency cutoff) is at 366E6 km = 11100

In effect, the 0.1 G gradient is at 3.16 times the 1.0 G gradient
and the 0.1 mG gradient is at 100 times the 1.0 G gradient.

Another star\'s cutoff radius is (Sol\'s radius * sqrt(Stellar_mass in Sol\'s))

Earth\'s surface is at 6380 km (within 1 hex)

Earth\'s 0.1 G gradient is at 20000 km (starships may not enter Earth\'s
hex)

Earth\'s 0.1 mG gradient is superceded by Sol\'s, but is at 638000 km =
11 hexes anyway

I.e. normal travel time to/from the FTL gradient and Earth is
2.29 days/warp = 55 h/warp

THUS, the scales given in STAR CRUISER are completely bogus.

THUS, we will not have the problem with long range missiles (since each
hex is only about 0.1 lightsecond, we can have reasonable control over
missiles at ranges of up to at least 50 hexes, i.e. a 5 second delay. Of
cause, I still think that missiles need considerable amounts of autonomy,
and remote piloting is more like assigning targets and pressing "fire enable")


On the subject of stutterdrive inertia, I feel that if you WANT to introduce
inertia, you could motivate it with:

1)	The stutterdrive frequency cannot be changed from 0 Hz to <n> MHz
	instantly - it must be gradually tuned over a period of time.

2)	Neither can the stutterdrive tunneling distance be changed from
	zilch to <whatever> with the flick of a switch.

This requires a Stutterdrive ship to \'accelerate\' and \'decelerate\' more or
less as in Newtonian maneuvers. Of cause, if you do NOT want this, you can
claim that the times involved are VERY small compared to the game scale.


As to the problem of ships doing 180\'s in space, consider this:

The Jerome drive propels a ship in a certain direction, usually along the
long axis of the ship (this is not stated anywhere, I just made it up, but
I think it seems reasonable). To change stutterwarp travel direction, you
have to rotate your ship. This is obviously easier for small ships than for
very large ships.

A quick-and-dirty rule for this is that any ship whose LARGEST profile is
positive must spend (move or not-move for inertialess universes) that number
of movement points between each facing change. Believe me, this makes a
battleship a LOT less agile than a fighter.


I have never considered Power Plant effectiveness compared to Real-world
systems, so I refrain from commenting on those.

Now the way that the volume of a jump drive is calculated is (1 + jump)%
of the volume of the hull. This implies that you can fit a jump-1 drive
into an 8 ton hull (ie. 112 cubic metres) and you can fit a jump-6 into
a 3 ton hull.

This is:

a) A mistake - should it perhaps read 2 tons (28 cubic metres)?

b) A _major_ retcon.

Scott2G:
Speaking of Jump drives, I haven\'t got Brilliant Lances yet, but I hope
that it was NOT a misprint about a 2 cubic meter jump drive being the
minimum rather than 2*(whatever a displacement ton is).  A 2 cubic meter
jump drive will now allow such a drive to be installed into the enlarged
TNE missiles, so we can now build Jump torpedoes again.

I don\'t think this is such a major retcon... If you look at the overall
picture of Brilliant Lances, it seems to be "classic traveller" stuck into a
hex pattern instead of using a milimeter scale. As for the Jump Drives...
it\'s going to change some things in traveller, but all _that_ much. The
leviathan merchant cruiser had those "jump Torpedoes" which I loved, and
missed in MegaTrav.  The Merchant cruiser is, of course, from Classic
Trav...

Seems to me like GDW is not doing too many retcons, but more going back to
what a lot of folks called "the good ole days" of Traveller. The combat
reflects it, the names reflect it, and the "guts" of the system seem to
reflect it. It\'s obviously not going to be the same, since megatrav and
especially DGP put the "flash" back into Traveller - so now we\'re expecting
that quality of writing again.

But hey, they\'re all just my opinions anyway.

Of those, the Saturn V, the Sapwood, and Arianne are the only ones
not significantly affected by human anatomy and anthropometrics.

The Space Shuttle has to be big enough for three things: Big cargos
due to DOD specifications, wings for crossrange capability in re-entry,
and a seven-man habitation space up front.  The hab space is very much
dependent on human size.

Mir was sized to be the minimum space two people can comfortably
live in for 6-9 months.  Skylab\'s interior was broken up into spaces
based on what human size could handle, in terms of operating machinery and
such.  The Abrams MBT is that size and shape muchly to fit the people
in... trust me, crew position is one of the hardest issues in armour
design...  The F-14 Tomcat was sized to carry three payload items to
Mach 2.4 off a carrier deck: a large radar, a bunch of big missiles,
and _two flight crew and their work stations_!  Of those, the crew
are arguably the largest item, and the canopy the crew are under is
quite a bit of total aircraft supersonic drag.

The Nimitz is that size because of the number of aircraft it needs to
carry and the size of those aircraft.   The size of those aircraft
to a large degree determines overall size.  The Los Angeles would
be a lot different if its crew were a lot smaller or larger; you need
a certain crew size to keep everything operational, and that drives
some pretty painful relationships as larger crew require more space
per crew which requires more machinery which requires more crew...

Yes, and the rules on which advanced societies build things are carefully
and closely linked to things like size.  Try spending time in Japan for
instance; the average Japanese person is several inches shorter than
in the US, and they have smaller buildings (in all dimentions, and not
just a little) and vehicles than we do.  Lots smaller.

Well, there are control panels and control panels.  I was speaking mainly
of how different races would build their joystick controls.  Sure you can
have a holographic panel with reconfigurable positions for all the buttons,
but have you ever tried a flight simulator from a keyboard?  SURE you can
do it, but it is a LOT harder.  And a joystick is not something that can
be \'created\' by a hologram.

The only reference to neural jacks I\'ve seen says they were TL 15.
(What does TNE say?  Anybody know?)
Dolphins (stuck in TL 14 Solomani space) may have to do without.
My idea came from the assumption that that is similar to the way that
the Type D Battledress and grav belts work (Though those would certainly
work with mechanical body postion sensors.)

Dolphins in Trav have fingers on their pectorals which is supposedly how
they operate their waldoes.  But the original contact article isn\'t very
specific & has no illustrations.  It makes no mention of neural jacks.
Actually, the way the original Contact article was written makes a Dolphin
starship crew Extremely unlikely.  They come off as intelligent animals
rather than people.  They are a long way from being on the level of
Brinn\'s _Startide Rising_.

Poul Anderson would have been my first mention.  Here\'s the guy who
came up with the original stories for at least three alien races in
Traveller.  Vargr are cribbed from the Adziriho of _Hunters of the
Sky Cave_.  Virushi are cribbed from the Wodenites of the Van Rijn
Space Traders  (along with the Merchant Princes).  And the Ael Yael
are cribbed from the Yithri.

There are other things (like the Imperium from Flandry stories)
The Long Night... etc.

Dane gave a pretty good list, Niven, Asimov, H. Beam Piper,
I would emphisize Jerry Pournelle more, _West of Honor_, _King
David\'s Spaceship_.

James White\'s _Sector General_ stuff also seems to be inspriational to
Trav.  (Excellent stuff!)

Heinlein\'s _Starship Troopers_.

L.Ron Hubbard\'s _Ole Doc Methusela_.

Olaf Stapledon\'s _Sirius_.  (Heavily influence on Vargr phychology)

All of Stanley G. Weinbaum\'s short stories!  (Trrrweeeeerrrlll!  :-)

Frank Herbert\'s _Dune_.

While it was not an influence in the CREATION of Trav, I would have
to list Lois McMaster Bujold as a fantastic source of inspiration for
Refs.  I just started reading her stuff (thanks Rob & Colin)  All of
it has been very Travelleresque so far.  Good clean fun!

And I suppose while I\'m at it I may as well list some excellent authors
who aren\'t very Trav, just cause I Like \'em.

Arthur C. Clarke.
James P. Hogan.
Clifford D. Simak.
Tom Clancy (I know, not SF, but great stuff anyway.  And he sure
influenced the 4.5th Frontier War.  :-)

and had a few questions, comments and criticism. This isn\'t
comprehensive, especially since I haven\'t actually played the games
either for roleplaying or boardgaming. I just wanted to get this out and
get some feedback.

First, a major point: The design rules for BL say that only airframe
(AF) hulls can land on planets with atmosphere more than Thin;
streamlined (SL) hulls can only skim gas giants and land on
no-atmosphere planets. This would be fine, except that the sample
designs include a bunch of ships that historically have been
planetary-landing-capable but now show as SL. This includes launches and
other ship\'s boats. Thus, according to the rules: Scouts and Traders
(among others) neither land nor carry boats capable of landing. This
would sure put a damper on exploration and trading in an environment
where all the orbital ports have been trashed. There are two obvious
fixes. (1) Give rules for SL hulls landing and taking off slowly,
inefficiently, and with little maneuverability compared to AF hulls, or
(2) redo most of the common ships into AF designs. The first is
obviously better. There should be different flight characteristics for
SL and AF, but SL ships should be able to at least minimally function.
I\'d still want airframe for any ship *my* character used, of course...

Second, also on the subject of sample designs: Designs that show up in
both the TNE book and in BL vary from one another, sometimes in fairly
significant ways. Make sure you\'re using the variant you think you are.

Third: Bays, turrets and ship weapons are presented in BL as a "small
sample" of possibilities. Will there be a more comprehensive list or
design process? Also on this subject is the interesting point that
spinal weapons (like jump drives) are not explicitly forbidden from
smaller vessels. The limit seems to be that if the weapon fits (some are
quite long) it can be used. I haven\'t yet tried to see how small a
vessel can carry such things.

Fourth, I would have liked to have seen a couple of "standard packages"
listed, e.g. a typical set of sensors and communications for typical
vessels and uses (trader, explorer, military). As it is, I need to know
more about the ship combat system than I want to for the RPG, and I\'m
dependent on sample ships that have errata and design flaws.


I guess that\'s about enough for now except to say that overall, despite
the above comments (and plenty of other problems and features I don\'t
like), I do like quite a bit about both TNE and BL. My regular gaming
group pretty much wrote off the original Traveller in the late \'70s as
hopelessly crippled -- we just didn\'t find much at all to like about it,
and this is a group that for many years stuck with FGU\'s Space Opera and
its errors, inconsistencies, silly bits, and FGU\'s usual abysmal
proofreading. MegaTraveller didn\'t win us back in the 80s (though I took
some stuff from it). TNE seems at least playable. I may end up primarily
using a homegrown system, but I\'ll be heavily influenced by TNE. If
Fire, Fusion & Steel is well enough done that I can model the technology
I want, and if some of the gaps in TNE and BL are filled, I might even
find myself running the game relatively straight -- though based on my
own history I have to doubt that.  :)

Scott (2G) Kellogg claims that three of Traveller\'s aliens are drawn from
  the works of Poul Anderson - the Vargr, Virushi, and Ael Yael.  I\'ve read
  very little Anderson, let alone those stories, so I can\'t confirm or deny.
  But I *have* read a lot of Larry Niven, another name on the source list,
  and I\'ve always felt that another three species were inspired by him.

One thing to note is that none of these three is a direct copy:  there are
  a lot of differences.  But there are also similarities.

Pierson\'s Puppeteers, the cowardly, social herbivore with a very *alien*
  body structure (two heads, brain in the body, two front legs and a single
  back one) and a talent for grand/subtle manipulation, were split up among
  the Hivers and the K\'Kree.  The Centaurs got the diet, the attitudes,
  the gregariousness (and the approach to building starships, to some
  extent) and the mostly-quadruped body, while the Hivers got what I think
  is the better part of the deal, the talent to shamelessly manipulate
  interstellar societies for their own ends.  Also the odd number of limbs
  and all that.

Any feline race tends to be written alike, so maybe the Aslan aren\'t *really*
  like the Kzin.  For one thing, in an interesting reversal, the females are
  not only sentient but sometimes more \'civilized\' than the warrior males.
  Also, although the Ftierle came to blows with Humans in the past, they
  don\'t seem to show the same headlong \'scream-and-leap\' agression-over-
  strategy that was the Kzinti trademark.  The evidence here is inconclusive.


If anyone can find better sources, let me know.

have always assumed the only difference was no Rebellion. I have Knightfall,
Traveller:the Early Years, and a couple of 2300 sourcebooks.

I don\'t know any specifics about aliens outside of the base information
given in MT. BUT, it seems to me that since Solomani, Vilani, and Zhodani
are all Humaniti, the physiological constraints on ship design would be
similar. Even if one allows them to be of slightly different sizes, they
would be proportianately alike.

As for controls, I rather imagine that given the range of space, most
contact and conflict will occur outside visual range, leading control of
ships to be more akin to modern naval combat, as simulated by Harpoon and
Red Storm Rising (the latter being a computer game). Meaning that rather
than a joystick, dynamic controls for the display of information and
operation of multiple ship functions will be used.

I\'m surprised that no one has mentioned \'Dumarent of Terra\' by E.C. Tubb.

As a boy, our hero stows away on a Far Trader\'s ship. The old captain
has a soft spot and (instead of spacing him) takes him under his wing.
Many years later the captain dies. Dumarest is God-knows where in the
multi-cultural galaxy and decides to return to Earth, to which everyone
replies "Earth? Mythical Earth?  You\'re joking, right?"

He travels from from planet to planet in Low Passage (occasionally
High), and frequently must rely on his knowledge of Blade Combat to
survive.

Every book leads us to a new an strange world, with Dumarest trying to
find passage to the next world on his journey to Mythical Earth. Many
of the planets/cultures he encounters could be described in UWP codes
trivially.

Nearly every book of the 50? 60? could be a Traveller adventure
setting.  A number of the terms and situations are directly reproduced
in the Traveller rules.  Coincidence? You decide...

    'body' => 'I\'ve got Brilliant Lance on monday this week. A big thanks to GDW that they
managed to send it to Germany at once. I would really enjoy it, when all the
other Traveller stuff find its way to germany equally fast.

My comments:
I like the combat rules, because they are very detailed. Best thing I see,
is the emphasis on Sensor tasks. I really welcome the new missile rules.
They are much more realistic, though the new missiles are similar to a
autopropelled mine. Place them somewhere, and when an enemy closes in,
start the missiles engine and kill him. (Especially usefull in szenarios
where you have to defend a limited area, i.e. Scenario 5)

I do like the new spinal weapons. I understand they could be fitted in every
hull, which can contain them, and which can support enough energy. Look at
the Chrysanthemum-Classer Destroyer Escort (p.37 Tech.Book). Two spinal
mounted Particle Accelerator. Boooaaaahh aaayyyee...Wow... BTW., I think
I have seen this design - at least deck plans of it - in the archives
on sunbane. Am I wrong ?

I don\'t like the limited TL ranges (compared to MEGATRAVELLER). No more
TL 17+ stuff like desintegrators or repulsors. I hope this will be fixed in
Fire, Fusion & Steel.

What I would like to see are more drones, missiles, probes etc. to use
with the ships. I think these things are treated a bit short. (Again F,F&F?)

Questions:
- - Okay, I\'ve skipped the comments about streamlined hulls very fast. The
  only thing a SL hull can\'t do, and an AF can is to land aerodynamically
  without using the contra-grav lifters. My opinion is: All ships using
  contra-grav lifters can indeed land on planet surfaces. Perhaps not AF
  hull need some more time, because athmospheric speed is limited.
  Yeah, it\'s true, I will allow USL ships using contra-grav to land on
  planets. The difference is, they will need 3 combat turns (1.5 hours)
  to land.
- - Nuc Damper in turrets can be used again one missile. Where are the old
  Nuc Damper screens, who work against all missiles?
- - Can someone clarify the rules about workstations to me? What\'s the difference
  between a bridge and a simple workstation? Does an auxiliar bridge consist
  of bridge workstations? How many workstations do I need to form a bridge?
  For every command crew member one bridge workstation? For every other operator
  a workstation? Are seats included in the workstations?
- - Where are the Air Locks gone to? I don\'t find them in the design sequence.
- - Why are Densitometer and Neutrino Sensors so weak. In MEGATRAVELLER they are
  the state-of-the-art passive sensors. In the Brilliant Lances rule, they
  can be used only to evaluate suns and planets, not ships.
- - Is HRT (p.7 Tech Book) part of the EMS Passive array?
- - Can a couple of minor hits be summed up to a major hit? If I got that right,
  when a system is hit, which can only sustain one minor hit, it is destroyed.
  You only need 10 damage points to do this. If you have a damage of 40 you
  would score a major hit. Because the system only need a minor hit to be
  destroyed, you have 30 damage points left, to use otherwhere. So no problem
  if the damage is to big. But what to do, if the damage is to small. Assume
  the Power Plant can sustain 2 major hits. If the power plant gets a minor hit,
  there is a 50% chance of a system reset or a performance degrade. Okay, but
  what happens on the next minor hit?
  In short: Can I destroy the power plant by minor hits?

That\'s all for the moment,

  I far as I can tell Yngve Larsson was the first person to mention the real
 pain in 2300AD space travel- calculating Interstellar Travel times accurately.
  ie. since In-system travel is so much slower it can add several days to an
  interstellar trip, and to work out HOW long you need to know the mass of the
  star and the orbit of the destination planet. If PCs ever do large amounts
  of interstellar travel you soon ignore it (like almost all written material
  did) or use an average value and realise why Traveller Jump Drive was such a
  good idea.

E.C. Tubb\'s Dumarest of Terra series was THE original inspiration
for the original three-book, black-boxed Traveller game. Lots and
lots of the detail in those first three books came from the Dumarest
series, including the concept of a "traveller", an adventurer who
made his way from planet to planet, looking for enough credits to
buy passage off planet on the next free trader.

Traveller borrowed directly high, middle, and low passage, slow drug,
fast drug, mesh armor, free traders, subsidized traders, psionics (and
it\'s underground status), and all kinds of other details, using the
exact names and descriptions given in the Dumarest books. I first read
the Dumarest books after I\'d had Traveller for some years, and I thought
I was reading a rather blatent, uncredited ripoff of the Traveller rules
and concepts.

As Traveller developed, it picked up other detail from other sources.
Poul Anderson has already been mentioned as the inspiration for many
of the alien races that developed later (although GDW did change the
names and some detail. I suppose someone had had them look up the definition
of "plagery" by then ;^) ).

First, I believe the original comment was (to paraphrase): there is a
correlation between architecture and anatomy.  However, none of the
items that Scott listed are architecture in the classical sense, but
vehicles.  I think the original comment was specifically referring to
buildings, not to vehicles...

Second, the examples that George used to rebut Scott were all based
on ergonomics.  I certainly won\'t argue that form must/should/does
follow function (to quote a famous deceased architect), because I
agree.  But I believe that the original comment of
        <building arch> = <human arch/torsal structure>
was _not_ making the connection between form and function.
Instead, I viewed it as a simple connection between shapes;
the point made was that a species\' architecture would be based on
some structural aspect of that species\' shape.

        Myself, I think that the connection between building arch and
human arch is stretching it a bit.  It\'s only one example, and there
don\'t seem to be any more (not that I can think of, but hey, I\'m just
a brain dead grad student...).  Not only that, but the sum total of
human architecture is extremely diverse.  Zulu and Mongols built
round "houses" with conical tops.  Iraquois built the origianl "quonset
huts," which we so copiously copied during WWII here in the States.
Plains Indians built Teepees, which are conical.  Egyptians, Aztecs
and Incas built pyramids.  It seems that most simple geometric shapes
get used by humans.  The examples are more numerous than I want to
put in a post...
        So I will stir the pot some more...  ;->  ;->  ;->  I would argue
that architectural shape of buildings has far more to do with the
building materials available than anything else.  Think about it:
the original quonset huts are half cylinders bacause that\'s the shape
you get when you bend a bunch of saplings and cover them with birch.
When you live in places where trees are abundant (and the culture has
advanced past the bronze age) you get square houses (with peaked roofs
in areas where it snows) - like most of Europe.  The arch is found
whenever people are building with stone, because it solves the problem
of tension failure in rocks - it\'s a shaped based on the property of the
material, no more, no less. Let\'s skip the rest of the examples, as I\'m
sure everyone can figure them out for themselves.  :->

        I\'m not going to touch vehicular design with a ten foot pole.    ;->
Besides, I agree essentially with George.

"nosnhoJ enaD" asks if Far Frontiers was ever published. The rimward 8
subsectors of Far Frontiers were published in Ares magazine, Special
Edition 2, in a 9 page article.  I believe that the work of FASA was
set only in this half-sector, so the missing coreward half should not matter
(the missing half is all, or virtually all, part of the Zhodani Consulate).

The author was Dale L. Kemper and the article copyright is 1984. I do not have
an original copy, so I cannot supply much further information.

The article includes parts of some states (particularly the Trelyn Domain)
which are the work of Chuck Kallenbach III in the original Paranoia Press
version of the Vanguard Reaches sector.  That version of the Vanguard
Reaches has now been superseded, so that alone makes part of the Far
Frontiers article out of date. If you are a member of HIWG, you should be
able to get the latest version of his docs, which include some material
related to Far Frontiers.

There is also a HIWG analyst working on this sector. He does not have
Internet access, but I can e-mail you (or anyone else) his address if you
wish to correspond with him. Note that he, like me, lives in Australia.
(What are we supposed to call "real" postal addresses these days? I have
seen "land mail", which is inaccurate if you live overseas, and "hard mail"
which I don\'t like).

Freedonia is Far Frontiers 1827, according to this article.

  A few more nits about Brilliant Lances.

  1.  Page 48, You can\'t build the Military boat or the Rampart Fighter.  They
	both use the 144-Mj `Laser Lance\'.  No stats on the Vol or Mass of
	those puppies.  It\'s not listed with the other ship mounted weapons.

  2.  Page 35 The Fiery Class Escort is an Airframe design.  It can land on
	planets with an atmosphere greater than thin.  It\'s External grapple is
        only streamlined rated, as is the 30 ton Military Gig that is
        supposed to dock there.  According to the rules, the gig would have
        to be detached and left in orbit before the mother ship could enter
        the atmosphere.

  3.  Page 9, weapons section.  Bays are mentioned, but that\'s about it.  No
	rules about them or what goes in them.

  4.  Page 10, weapons section.  No volume listing for missles.  This is
	needed to allocate space for spares when ship building.  It\'s also
	needed to recalculate the performance of the Rampart figher when
	carrying missles.  It has USL grapples for up to four missles.

  5.  The Broadsword class Merc Cruiser probably is limited to M2 given it\'s
	hull armor value of 28.

  Sources for Traveller:  H. Beam Piper comes to mind right off.
	Check out his book `Space Viking\'.  The Sword Worlds come right from
	here.  This book is of extra value to those using the TNE setting.

[Analysis of size of crew affecting design deleted]

I agree.  Size of crew is definitely a factor, that\'s why all of the
Mercury Astronauts were under 6\' tall.  But that was not my point.
My point was that, one should not look to the anatomy of the race
building the ship to see how it will be laid out.  A Droyne ship will
not necessarily look like it was cribbed from an anatomy chart for
a Droyne any more than Human anatomy appears in the Space Shuttle,
Saturn V etc.  Just because the sternum of the human looks like the
keystone of an arch, that does not mean that all human doors will
look like arches.

Morphology however, will CERTAINLY have an effect on design layout.  You
don\'t need stairs if you have wings.  Or if you are a fish, you will
need a water filled ship.  The size and shape of your hands and eyes
affect the control inputs & displays you have.

HA!  You wanna see different scales of engineering?
Try living with a woman who\'s eight inches taller than you!  |->
I come in at 5\'6".  My fiancee\' (from Germany) comes in at 6\'2".
Now, she\'s 5" shorter than the average Zhodani and a foot shorter than
the average Aslan.  I can only imagine what THEIR architecture would
be like!  WHEW!

However, Anthropometrics won\'t be so different for Human vs. Droyne
architecture.  Droyne vary in height from 1 to 2 meters depending on
caste and function.  Thus they\'ll be roughly on the same scale we are.

Furthermore, we are trying here to see what sort of major changes one
might see in Human vs. Droyne architecture.  Scale does not, in my
opinion make such a major change.  After all, a giant 1950\'s Buick
still looks an awful lot like a tiny 1990\'s Honda.  4 wheels,
2-4 doors, front engine, rear drive wheels...  And when you look back
in history, (when Japan had less of a meat diet and average height was
even smaller), The Yamato *looked* pretty dang similar to the Missouri.
Scale doesn\'t account for the changes we\'re looking for.

Oh yeah,

Re:  Streamlined Hulls and Planetary landings....

Perhaps CG would allow such a ship to land fairly easily, while AF would
dispense with the necessity of such a "hi-tech" answer, providing an
actual lifting body...Whatever the answer, I think we ought to come up
with *some* suggestion, since it\'s a major problem:  Scout/Couriers,
Gazelle Close Escorts, Broadsword Merc Cruisers, and Far Traders are all
affected!

Re:  Weapons, Weapons and More Weapons...

Not only are the weapons "a small sample" of what there are, some of the
ships are designed with weapons not on the tables.  The Kinunur sports 700
Mj Laser Turrets, while the Armed Gig and Rampart Fighter are equiped with
fixed "144 Mj Laser Lances" (Perhaps the inspiration for the game\'s
name?)....I find this rather irritating...:/

As for spinal mounts and small ships:  the Chrysanthemum has *two* of \'em!
I wonder if GDW could be...prodded/asked to clarify the
spinal mount rules as given?


Overall, I think it\'s going to play fairly well, but I still feel like I
need more design info.  I agree with whomever was wondering why the *16*
page design sequence couldn\'t have been squeezed into the core TNE
rulebook.  Maybe they could have left out one (or both!) of the
Introductory Scenarios? <hint, hint>

  worlds with little or no atmosphere, assuming they have landing gear.

 Note that CG Lifters do not allow the higher class of operation to be
done at the same SPEED that the actual hull could do.  A Streamlined CG
landing will be a much more careful operation than an Airframe landing
(even without CG), and Unstreamlined skimming is not for the
faint-hearted at any time.

This "fix" is really the only reason CG is in the rules, IMO.  There
is little reason for its inclusion otherwise.  Such a system invented
solely for the ability to get a 1G ship off the ground is silly and
wasteful.

As I mentioned in a rather facetious message before, one possible reason
for the above mistake is that the following line is what appears in the
header of the bundle:

I believe a lot of aircraft and ships are built with a sort of rib-like
framework, with a "skin" covering it.  Nowadays, the "skin" is metal, but
the ribs are often still there.

My guess is that Droyne vehicles will be likely to have a geodesic framework.
Humans have tried this, and it works rather well - one example was the
Vickers Wellington bomber of WW2.  For some reason, though, the rib-like
framework is still used.

And I have no idea what a Hiver spaceship will look like. :-)

Interesting idea, never thought of it. Perhaps a solution: The AF is designed
that it encloses the Gig. It is not an airframe any more if the Gig is
detached?!

Oh there are two bays in the weapon section on page 10. A TL 9 100 tons
70 Mj bay and a TL 10 50 tons 450 Mj bay. I look forward to see 50 and 100

Well, the Kinunir class uses 700 Mj Laser BARBETTEs, but I must agree, they
are not in the technical sections as are the Laser Lances. I think the
inspiration for the name is mentioned in one of the booklets. It\'s the
beam of laser which they call a "Brilliant Lance".

I think there are no limitation about weapons, spinal or turrets. Only
limitation I see is the required power. BTW, if I git it right, you can
calculate the required MW for every weapon if you know its Mj rating.
Power requirements in MW * 36 = Output in Mj.

  In the ship design section of Brilliant Lances, I have a question on Life
support.  There is a set of numbers in a table, but no info on how to apply
them.  Is is per lifeform per 24 hour period or what?

  The Scout ship now is listed (in BL) as having 2 LARGE staterooms.  In the
TNE source book, it had 2 SMALL staterooms.  Some of the ships in BL are
listed as having QUAD occupancy large staterooms.  It looks like we are back
to the CT standard of allowing up to 8 on a Scout ship again.  Life support
ratings for the ship should have a controling factor over this, but as I
stated above, I can\'t figure out how to apply them.

  Freedonia.  Find a copy of the Marx Brothers Film `Duck Soup\'.  Then find
some really old FASA products.  Some of their old Traveller deck plans will
do.  You find out FASA stands for `Freedonian AeroSpace Agency\'.  Once you
find the planet Freedonia, it will have Giant Robots fighting each other...
or elves and trolls in decaying urban settings... :-) :-)

   I have never thought that the Aslan where realy "redesigned" Kzin.

	Agreed, which brings up a point that a Vargr friend of mine pointed out
to me.  The Cogs&Dogs books shows the inside of a bridge of a Vargr ship.  Why
do they have chairs like Humans?  The only seeming difference is the hole for a
tail.  From the original Vargr Aliens book, it doesnt seem that their leg
anatomy was changed that much from the Terran canine.  Are these chairs
comfortable to the Vargr, or would they prefer a more leaning-forward, almost
prone position?

	On a slightly related note, I have always assumed that the larger races
(ie Aslani) were cramped in the standard Human sized chairs and ship
staterooms. After some discussion with those in my gaming group, we multiplied
the vol, wgt, and price of all Aslani fittings (chairs, staterooms, airlocks,
low berths, etc) by 1.2 if installed on a ship designed for Aslani use.  We
assumed that Aslani could use normal human-sized fittings, but on their own
ship, they wanted to be more comfortable.  One of our players was an
accountant/lawyer on our ship (her Aslani name translated into standard as
\'she who\'s claws are words\') complained about her cramped stateroom.

	Could this also lead to a change in the MT design tables for other
equipment for other races?  Allow Hiver fittings to be smaller, or at least
shorter?

As it stands now in BL, controls have no actual effect other than the
cost and power requirements of workstations. They have no effect on
the actual crewing levels/number of workstations themselves.
This is a change from MegaT, and, I suspect an error, since it\'s
perfectly within the rules (as they stand) to build a TL-15 ship with
tech-5 controls. (imagine adjusting the throttle on the attitude
control thrusters with wires and pulleys connected directly to the
pilot\'s joystick :-).

  The fix that seems most apparent to me is to add an additional multiplier
in the crew requirements section wherever "Cp", the computer multiplier,
appears.

   I\'m trying (but haven\'t had time to extensively test yet) a multiplier
that is :    1/(CP value in MegaT)

This gives multipliers of:

TL5 Basic Mechanical =  5
TL6 Enhanced Mechanic = 2.5
TL7 Electronic       =  2
TL8 Electronic Linked=  1.43
TL9 Computer Linked  =  1.25
TL10 Dynamic Linked  =  1
TL13 Holographic Link=   0.67


The rules already state that the controls may not be from a greater TL
than the computer, but controls from a lower TL would degrade the
ability to actually USE the computer\'s capacity, and require more
things to be done manually, thus higher crew requirements.
I\'ll test this out when I have more time to do so, but if anyone wants
to beat me to the punch, feel free.


Also, this brings up the difference in crewing requirements in pre- and
post-Virus ships, since post-Virus ships keep their systems isolated from
each other and use manual code input to prevent infections from
spreading.

What, if any over a 30-minute turn timeframe, effect does this have on
performance?

Should this be considered a crew quality issue, since for highly trained
and coordinated crews, this may not degrade performance noticeably, but
for poorer-grade crews, this could slow them down quite a bit, perhaps?

Also a bit of errata:
Rules book pg 31: Lackland Sons scenario under "Aslan Ihatei Squadron"

The _Ships_ line lists "Crews crack and at battlestations"
the _Vector_ line lists "Crews Line"

Since no other scenario has crew quality listed in the _Vector_ line,
I assume it is the one in error, and should be deleted.

Yeah, they will have similar internal environment.  The over all shape and

for human hands.

Well, I would remind you that those ships won\'t always be in combat.  You
will be Beyond Visual Range in almost all space combat.  But, you still
will have to land that ship sometime.  Or if you can\'t land, you\'ll still
need to dock that ship.  You will need some form of attitude control.

I would also point out that while there might be some debate on what
"Beyond Visual Range" might mean to a submarine, (Red Storm Rising is
sub combat I think)  The more advanced submarines are starting to use
controls similar to aircraft:  Control yokes and joysticks.

Now, as I understand it, a Holodynamic control is a holographic equivalent
to a dynamic touch screen type set up.  The holographics allowing for a
3 dimensional array of controls.  Well, I\'ve worked with dynamic 2D touch
screens and found them very nice.  But it was still about the same "Feel"
as a keyboard.  I would NOT want to use one for a computer game where a
joystick would do better.  And the idea of using a non-substantial
hologram of a joystick which I can not hold in my hand is about the same
as trying to play a musical instrument called a Theramin.  A Theramin
plays by putting your hand near (what amounts to) a proximity sensor, this
raises or lowers a note.  They make fun neat sounds, (all the sound effects
in _Forbidden Planet_ are Theramins, along with the electronic Theme for
the _Outer Limits_.)  but it is nigh on impossible to get a good solid note
out of one.  Even with perfect pitch, it is DAMN hard.  A holograph of a
joystick will NOT work.

Sounds good to me.  The idea that an AF hull can fly aerodynamically without
Grav is absolutely rediculous though.  Take a look at the weight of those
ships.  Then take a look at how big they are.  There is NO WAY that those
ships can fly without gravitic lift.  Not at all.  The scoutship weighs
680 tons, right?  Well, it has 1/3 LESS wing area than a 27 ton F-4
Phantom II.  And it Weighs more than TWICE what a fully loaded B-52
Stratofortress.  It will NEVER fly by aerodynamic lift.

Ah ha!  I checked a bit.  The JTAS article does not mention Neural Interfaces

the JTAS bit.  Dolphins DO have a neural interface at TL 12.

Perusing the old JTAS article, I noticed that the Bwap\'s homeworld was
given as "Marhaban in the Lentuli Subsector", with no Sector given.
Having no clue where Lentuli might be, I grepped my friendly neighborhood
sector data files (from sunbane)...This is what I got:

emptyq.sec:
Marhaban      0426 A4697AB-E                       801 Im K8 IV
lishun.sec:
Marhaban      3033 E31099B-C    Hi Na In           821 Li G4 V M1 D

All well and good, except that these are both awful candidates, in my
opinion...First of all, the Lishun site:  it\'s got nearly no atmosphere,
no water, and no starport, whereas the Bwap\'s are described as being
uncomfortable in anything less than 95% humidity and as having been given
Jump drive by the Vilani.  The impression I got (I haven\'t the article
with me) was that the Bwaps had a large presence in space and had been
contacted fairly early by the First Imperium.  Anyway, the Lishun
Marhaban, although "fairly" close to Vland, seems an awful prospect for
the Newt homeworld.

Empty Quarter\'s Marhaban is better, but seems a tad far away to have been
contacted "early" by the Vilani.  Anybody have any facts/insight into this?

On a slightly different note:

Most Traveller products, up till now, have left the Minor Races largely
ignored.  We\'ve learned about them largely through articles in magazines.
I\'d like to see GDW put out a Minor Race sourcebook at some point,
detailing some of the common, starfaring, non-major races, like the
Ithklur, the Bwaps, the Vegans, and so forth....

Ahem.  The 4.5th Frontier War is a series of stories about some conflicts
between the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate in 1102, seven years
previous to the Fifth Frontier War.  Authored by me.  It has no relationship
what so ever to the Nth Interstellar Wars between the Vilini Empire and the

In Poul Anderson\'s _Hunters of the Sky Cave_ The Adziriho used a forward
leaning couch-saddle type arrangement.  (Much to Flandry\'s discomfort)
My guess would have been that that would be more comfortable, but we do
not really know much about the manipulations to the Vargr spine.  Perhaps
straight back chairs are more comfortable than it might seem.  We\'ve seen
Vargr operate in human ships often enough without mentioning modifications.
It would make thing simpler.  (But what\'s more likely is the artist in
Cogs & Dogs didn\'t think about it.)

                                in "earths" and Gx is the effect band.

I\'m suprised that nobody mentioned C.J.Cherryh\'s Hani (or maybe I\'m just
coming in late).  The Hani have several of the main attributes of the
Fteirle: males fight one another to settle political disputes and
females have exclusive control over business/trade/technology.

I frequently (and inaccurately, but what the hey) give the following
description of them to new players "Imagine a race that has the female
Hani (C.J. Cherryh) and male Kzinti (Larry Niven)".

Where\'s that piece written by Scott Kellogg (sometime a year or so ago?)

kirsch@rhea.informatik.uni-bonn.de writes:
> Subject: Brilliant Lances

I\'ve taken a look at it too, but haven\'t gotten a chance to play it yet.
My overall impression is pretty good.  Specifically, the game fits into
T:TNE in pretty much the same way that Mayday fit into Classic Traveller.
(Hm ... maybe we should call it "Mayday: The New Era")  But BL is a much
more complete and interesting boardgame than Mayday ever was.

Inside the box (which I saw at Dream Wizards here in Rockville, for $30)
you get 2 rulebooks, 2 sheets of color counters, 3 maps (really BIG hexes!),
2 player reference cards, 1 sheet of errata (avertising on the back), and
1 T:TNE comment form.

One rulebook is the rules of play (32 pages, including scenarios).  Good
solid boardgaming rules that should interface *very* well with T:TNE.  So
well in fact that if I were the suspicious type, I\'d think that the rules in
T:TNE were an earlier version of this, with "hex" globally changed to "range
band". ;-)  The game uses the T:TNE task system to resole die rolls, so PC\'s
skills just drop in place of the "crew quality" assets.  There is a good
number of ships provided, more than with T:TNE (or MegaTraveller, or Classic
Traveller, for that matter).

The other book (48 pages) has the ship profiles for the ships to use in the
boardgame, as well as the ship design rules.  The design rules seem complete
but has some holes, which Mr. Kirsch did a good job of describing.

Brilliant Lances doesn\'t seem to be designed to be able to deal well with
ships bigger than a couple of thousand tons.  The biggest "spinal" mount
is a little under 200 dispacement tons (or about 1/5 the size of the smallest
High Guard/MegaTraveller spinal mount; the rest of the BL spinal mounts
would have been High Guard or MegaTraveller bay weapons; it might be
possible to cram a small BL spinal mount into a small craft).

A few interesting observations that long-time Traveller players might
want to take note of: There is no longer any lower limit on the size of a
starship.  There is a minimum size for a jump drive, but from off-the-cuff
calculations, I think you can get a 10-ton craft to jump with at least
enough left-over space for a crewman.  There also don\'t seem to be any
limits on the number of weapons you can cram into a ship, excepting of
course what will actually fit into and onto the hull.  Finally, there
isn\'t any limit on the accelleration of the craft, except what will
squash the crew (or at least leave them unable to function: gravity
compensation varies by Tech Level).  All in all, I don\'t mind these
changes, I think that the elimination of arbitrary restrictions (no
starships less than 100 tons, only 1 turret per hundred tons, etc) is
worth it.  And besides, we get to explore the utility of jump-capable
fighters, and other strange stuff.

Overall, the game is very nice, but it does have some rough edges.  A
page of errata is included, but that doesn\'t cover them all.  I get
the distinct impression that BL should have been kept back another
week and proofread one more time.

Summary and Recommendation: If you and your players like "boardgaming
out" spaceship encounters, get this game.  If you like playing SF
boardgames get this game, the vector movement is good.  If you want
ship construction rules for T:TNE, give this one a miss and wait for
the Technical Architecture book (Fire, Fusion and Steel) in November.

Call for Errata: If you have any Brilliant Lances errata, send it to me,
and I\'ll compile a list with suggested fixes, just like I did with T:TNE.
Send your errata to: wildstar@quark.qrc.com
Please put something like "BL Errata" in your subject line, so I can sort
them out of the rest of the mail.

Well, now.  As far as I know, all that\'s available for T:TNE right now is the
massive Traveller: The New Era rules, and Brilliant Lances.

If you\'re still playing with the little black books, and are happy with them,
there\'s a lot to be said for not buying anything.  T:TNE is a different game
than Classic Traveller.  T:TNE is based on the Twilight:2000 (2nd ed) rules
system, and also re-writes the Traveller background (the best way to describe
it is that T:TNE does to the Imperium what Twilight:2000 does to the
present-day world).

Assuming that, like me, you are in the market for a new game, T:TNE has a
bunch of things going for it.  It\'s *NOT* overpriced; as a matter of fact
the thing is very reasonably priced.  The game system is pretty good, and
a lot of material is provided in the one book.  The only caveat I would give
is that if you can\'t stand the T2k2 system, T:TNE is the same system.

Recommendation: Buy (but see below)

The only other thing out is Brilliant Lances, and I just reviewed that above.

Coming in November is the Technical Architecture book, which will probably
also be a "buy".

According to the advertising in BL, T:TNE Deluxe Edition is coming out in
November.  This will include both T:TNE and the Technical Architecture book
in one box, and may be a better buy if you can wait for it.

Other items that were mentioned in the BL advertising are the T:TNE referee\'s
screen and several projects due next year.  I don\'t know anything about the
ref screen, and I think next year\'s products are a little far away to be
making purchasing decisions about.  Of course, don\'t forget Challenge.  There
should be a bunch of New Era material showing up in it Real Soon Now.  In
the past few years, I haven\'t found Challenge to have enough Traveller and/or
Space: 1889 material in it to be worth the price (to me, IMHO).  However, as
T:TNE material starts showing up I will be re-evaluating that ...

Here\'s a question for the Trav historians and pranksters of various
fields among us:

What are the in jokes in Traveller?

In science fiction there is ALWAYS room for private jokes.  The
little bits that the author finds terribly humorous but doesn\'t
expect anyone else to get.  I\'ve been trying to collect these bits
of humor, partly to further my education of jokes from fields
different from mine, but mostly for fun.

Lessee:  We\'ve learned that Mark Miller\'s mother\'s name is Margret.
:-)

Thanks to Rob Dean the TML has had one in joke published in GDW
materials:  The "Admiral Bertil" class Q-ship carrier :-) named
after our own Bertil Jonnell which appeared in _Assignment:
Vigilante_.  Rob once said that if he knew the ship was going to be
published he would have named it after himself!

Bertil Jonnell once told me of the "Bowman Belt" from the GDW
module _Beltstrike_.  Seems there was a Swedish politician named
Bowman.  In an effort to explain away some faltering in the Swedish
economy of the time he said that "We must tighten our belts" (Of
course he probably said it in Swedish :-) but the phrase (and the
economic downturn) came to be known as the "Bowman Belt".  :-)

To this list I will add one of the things I\'ve noticed, the "P.F
Sloan" class escort.  As you may know, P.F. Sloan was a folk
singer/songwriter from the mid-late 60\'s.  He wrote such songs as
"Secret Agent Man"(Jonny Rivers) and "Eve of Destruction"(Barry
McGuire).

Now, what are the other ships in the class supposed to be named?
Bob Dylan?  John Lennon?  Paul Simon?  Steven Stills?
Hee! Hee! Hee!  |->

But my knowlege is limited, and we have a great store out there.
So what have YOU folks noticed along these lines?  :-)

Well, I\'m afraid I haven\'t noticed any with quite the subtlety that Scott
has, but there are the names of about half the planets in the Solomani
Rim.  Most aren\'t too obscure and the sources will be readily apparent,
but many will not be obvious to the casual reader of SF, especially if he
isn\'t up on his Golden Age writers.  (Most modern readers aren\'t exposed
to E.E. Doc Smith, so Boskone and Arisia will simply be a couple more
Traveller planet names...)

I\'m not sure this is quite what Scott had in mind, tho\'...

The Brinn minor race from Divad (Travellers\' Digest 12 or thereabouts...)
are an obvious reference to David Brin - but I don\'t know if there is
any more correspondence than the name (as I recall they were warlike
methane breathers, somewhat spider-like) - does anyone with a better
knowledge of David Brin\'s work know if they resemble any aliens he created?
(I\'ve read a fair bit of his stuff, but by no means all...).

Tying in the other thread, I would classify David Brin as an influence for
some of the more recent additions to Traveller (ie. the DGP/Megatraveller
stuff, rather than Classic Traveller). The various terran species "uplifted"
like the dolphins, the various primates etc. by the Solomani match closely
with Brin\'s novels.

Can\'t remember any other in-jokes that I may have come across... the above
stuck in my mind because it was so obvious.

See ya \'round.

Well, a brick will fly if you give him enough power. The Scout mentioned above
will fly, at about 800 kph. That\'s no problem, but the landing would be a bit
rough, because if the ship gets slower than 800 kph, it will indeed behave like
a brick. But all in all you are right. AF Lift is to small for those super heavy
ships the Technical Booklet creates.

Notes:
  The Marva class Far Trader is the state-of-the-art construction within
the borders of the ....(Spinward Marches,Regency... insert as you like).
Though the ship costs about 8 MCr more than it\'s less sophisticated sister,
the Jayhawk class Far Trader. Based on the same hull, this design includes
more Cargo and sports much easier maintenance. The ship requires a crew of
4 for full operations.
  The ship\'s power plant has a reserve of more than 10 MW for the addition
of two 150 Mj Laser Turrets. Most of the ship\'s components are identical to
the Beowulf class Free Trader, which should lower maintenance costs
significantly.

The Fuel purification machinery(1.25 MW) can refine 250 kl each 6 hours.
The whole Fuel load (1100 kl) can be refined in 26 hours 24 minutes.

My assumptions for the ship:
I placed one large cargo hatch in the front, right between the nacelles
of the cockpit (to the right) and the owners cabin. It opens downward
as a ramp. The two small cargo hatches are on the left and right lower
side of the ship. The Launch Port for the Air raft is above the large
cargo hatch. Also the passenger accomodations are placed in the front
area of the ship.

Regardless of exactly how it works, lift is roughly proportional to the area
of the lifting surface.  For a given shape, this increases with the square
of the size.  Mass (hence weight) goes up with the cube.  The lift/weight
ratio thus decreases with increasing size (for given speed).  That\'s why
large birds need disproportionately larger wings in order to fly.

Jupiter is about 143 Mm across.  How big is a BL hex?  15 000 km?
This gives your figures.  I had the idea it was 60 Mm, though.

Unfortunately, the 15 Mm hex size is inconsistent with these figures.
The 1G radius for Jupiter is 114 Mm from the centre.  That is, 1.6 times
its radius.  There is evidently something wrong, since the \'surface\'
gravity of Jupiter is only 2.5 G, yet your figures show it to be about
10 G at the \'surface\'.

If my faint notion of a 60 000 km hex size is correct, the 1G level should
be 1.9 hexes from the centre.

Jupiter\'s orbital speed is 13 km/s.  This is consistent with a 60 Mm hex and
a 1 hour turn.  Just what are the real numbers, anyway?  I\'ll stick with
these because they sound nice enough.

I expect the player\'s *would* be using Jupiter as a reference - the Sun\'s
tidal effects are negligible at that distance.  Its gravity is small -
48 uHex/turn^2 - so it could be ignored anyway.

It depends on the distance from the planet - here\'s a derivation:
Circular orbit is achieved when the acceleration due to gravity is exactly
that required to keep the satellite in circular motion.

Gravity:  a = GM/r^2.
Circular: a = w^2 r.  w = 2pi/T.

G ~= 6.67e-11 SI units (kg^-1 m^3 s^-2 for anyone who cares), the
  gravitational constant.
M is the mass of the planet.  Jupiter\'s M ~= 1.90e27 kg.
R is the radius of the orbit.  eg.  72 Mm - just above Jupiter\'s atmosphere.
w is the angular speed of the orbit, related to the orbit time (T).

Equating the a\'s, you get
  GM/r^2 = w^2/r
  GM = w^2 r^3
Substituting the formula for T,
  GM = (2pi/T)^2 r^3
  (T/2pi)^2 = r^3/GM
  T/2pi = sqrt(r^3/GM)

  T = 2pi sqrt(r^3/GM)

For those who want a more \'fundamental\' formula; use
  a = GM/r^2
to get
  r = sqrt(GM/a).

1G is 9.8 m/s^2 (use this for \'a\'), the value of \'GM\' for Earth is
4e14 SI, to give \'r\' in metres.  (This confirms that you use 15 Mm/band)


Other useful orbital stuff:

Specific escape energy:  I = GM/r.
Combined with the kinetic energy formula  I = v^2/2;
Escape velocity:  v = sqrt(2GM/r).
Esacpe energy equals half of circular orbit energy.
(Hence escape velocity = sqrt(2) times orbit velocity: about 40% extra)

Sun\'s mass: 1.99e30 kg.
Earth\'s mass: 5.98e24 kg.

Earth low orbit velocity is 7.9 km/s.
Moon low orbit velocity is 1.7 km/s.
Moon\'s orbit velocity is 1.0 km/s.
Earth\'s orbit velocity is 30 km/s.

the following is the design of the Beowulf class Free Trader of TL 15. I hope
this message is on the list only once. I tried to send it some hours ago, but
I got no reply from the demon at engrg, so here it is again. I wonder where
the other mail has gone to, but perhaps James got it on traveller-requests.
If this is so, please tell me James :).

The design starts with a 132 column calculation table and ends with a 80 column
design evaluation and damage location table.

How to create Damage Tables for TNE.

When I finished the Technical Booklet (TB) of Brilliant Lances I found, that
a description of the creation of Damage Tables for the new created Spaceships
is missing. In the Design Evaluation chapter on page 17, I found only vague
hints on how to create them. Here is my solution, to create these tables.
The 200 tons Beowulf class Free Trader is used as an example.

1. Calculate the volume of the ship\'s components as suggested in step 3 of the
   Design Evaluation.
   Beowulf:  Electronics:    47.312 kl
             Hold:         1947.288 kl
             Quaters:       518.400 kl
             Engineering:   203.000 kl
             Weapon Mounts:  84.000 kl
             total:        2800.000 kl Ship Volume

2. Calculate the percentage parts of these components compared to the ships
   displacement:

   to calculate:                        Beowulf
   ----   ----
   ElecPart = Electronics/Ship Volume   ElecPart =   47.312/2800 = 0.01690
   HoldPart = Hold/Ship Volume          HoldPart = 1947.288/2800 = 0.69546
   QtrsPart = Quaters/Ship Volume       QtrsPart =  518.400/2800 = 0.18351
   EngPart  = Engineering/Ship Volume   EngPart  =  203.000/2800 = 0.07250
   WeapPart = Weapon Mounts/Ship Volume WeapPart =   84.000/2800 = 0.03000

3. The whole ship has 400 (20x20) damage locations. To get the damage
   locations of the single parts, multiply the calculated "Part"-Values
   by 400. The result is the number of damage locations each component
   has.

   to calculate:                Beowulf                         in %
   ----     ----
   Elecdam = 400*ElecPart       Elecdam = 400 * 0.01690 =   7    1.75
   Holddam = 400*HoldPart       Holddam = 400 * 0.69546 = 278   69.50
   QtrsDam = 400*QtrsPart       QtrsDam = 400 * 0.18351 =  73   18.25
   EngDam  = 400*EngPart        EngDam  = 400 * 0.07250 =  30    7.50
   WeapDam = 400*WeapPart       WeapDam = 400 * 0.03000 =  12    3.00

4. You have now calculated the damage locations for the internal Explosion
   damage table of the ship. Now these locations must be placed. To do this,
   imagine the exterior design of the ship, as you would like to see it.
   That\'s easy for the Beowulf, because there are enough pictures and even
   deck plans around, to do this.

   Some hints:
   To find the hit location of the ship, you first role a D20. This roll
   select the hull part using the "Hull Surface Loaction" picture (page 17
   Brilliant Lances Rules of Play (RoP), or page 319 in TNE).
   To place the damage location think of the globe sections as the directions
   from where incoming weapons reach the hull. Then remember your intended
   interior design of the ship. Think of the parts of the interior which can
   be damaged, if a weapon hit from one of the sectors of the globe. Keeping
   this in mind, you choose these of the five categories, which can be touched
   by a hit from this location. You need at least a rough idea on how the ship
   shall look like.

   Every Component with more than 20 hit locations could count as one line
   in the damage location table. That\'s true for the Hold, the Quarters and
   the Engine Components in this case. The other components damage locations
   have to be placed for a second D20 role.

   BTW: Only a sphere shaped ship can apply this damage locations without
   bothering shadows for the incoming fire. Think of the fire arcs of the
   different fire locations. If a ship fires in this arc, it should not be
   able to damage the weapon installations. If you like to use details, it
   would be an interesting work, to place the damage location with more
   details :).

Result of this steps is the damage location table for internal explosions.
And the surface damage? Well, you should use the same method:

1. Caculate the antenna area, cargo hatch surface, launch port surface and
   Air Lock surface. Then find the part of the ship\'s surface they take.
   You can calculate the ship\'s surface by using the MV-value of the Hull
   Size Table (p.2 TB) multiplied by 100.

   to calculate:                                Beowulf:
   ----    ----
   AntPart = antenna area/ship surface area     AntPart = 15.4/900 = 0.0171
   CHPart  = Cargo hatch area/ship surface      CHPart  = 40.0/900 = 0.0444
   LPPart  = Launch Port area/ship surface      LPPart  = 16.0/900 = 0.0178
   ALPart  = Air Lock area/ship surface area    ALPart  =  4.0/900 = 0.0044
   EMMPart = EMMRad area/ship surface area      not available

   I\'ve calculated the Air Lock Surface area as 2 square meters for the
   exterior door. I havn\'t found any hints on the true surface area.

2. Use the calculated values to find the surface damage locations.

   to calculate:                    Beowulf:
   AntDam = 400 * AntPart           AntDam = 400 * 0.0171 =  7
   CHDam  = 400 * CHPart            CHDam  = 400 * 0.0444 = 18
   LPDam  = 400 * LPPart            LPDam  = 400 * 0.0178 =  7
   ALDam  = 400 * ALPart            ALDam  = 400 * 0.0044 =  2
   EMMDam = 400 * EMMPart

   Step 4 of the Design Evaluation chapter says, that external grapples
   are part of the surface fixtures. If you check through the tables, no
   ship uses this. Every ship which has an external grapple locates its
   Small Craft there.

3. Locate these damage locations on the hull. Use the same method

I hope the ideas mentioned above are of some help. It took me 3 hours to
figure out how to calculate and place the damage locations on the Beowulf
class Free Trader. It took much less time on the Marva class Far Trader.
I hope with some routine, I can create this tables a bit faster.

All in all a ship design for BL takes about 3 hours for small ships. I don\'t
know how long it will take on large ships. I will soon try :).

With calculated damage tables....errr...well...

    Pulling out my handy copy of "Golstein\'s Tome of Mystical Classical
Mechanics," we find that tha appropriate expression is:

          T = 2*pi*a^(3/2)*(m/k)^(1/2)

(This is the essence of the Third Law of Kepler The Mystical.)
Here, a is the semi-major axis of the orbit (i.e. radius, if you assume
a spherical orbit). m is the "reduced mass" of the two-body system:

         m = m(1)*m(2)/(m(1)+m(2))

If ,say, m(1)>>m(2) this reduces to the approximation m=m(1). (This will
be the case when you consider the typical spacecraft orbiting a planet.)
Finally, k is the force constant of the potential; in the case of gravity
we have k = G*m(1)*m(2), where G =6.67E-11 Nm^2/kg^2 (I think...)
Putting this all together, then, we have:

      T^2 = (4*pi^2*a^3)/(G*m(1))

Now, as to units...assuming a in km, M in earth masses (Me = 5.976E+24 kg),
we obtain:
      T^2 = (0.99E-4)*a^3/M     with time T in seconds
          = (1E-4)*a^3/M        (approximating)

So, for example, orbiting Earth (M=1) at an altitude of 100km (a=6440)
we get T=5184 s = 1.44 h. This assumes I did my math right, but I did
double check by calculating the Earth\'s period around the sun (with
a back-of-the-envelope calculation, I got .95 years...that seems good
enough to me...)

There are a couple of really minor in-jokes in what I\'ve done
for Traveller, but there was a nearly totally accidental beaut
in the "Terror in the Light" Merc:2k article for the Horror issue.

The company which owns the oil rig was origionally named SCOCO,
South Coast Oil COmpany, along the lines of ARCO and CONOCO.
I intentionally put the CO on because there\'s a computer software
and operating systems company named Santa Cruz Operation which is
referred to as SCO, which several of my friends work at and
whose software is pretty well known....  and I didn\'t want
to link the real SCO with this sort of wierdness.

Unbeknownst to me, between receipt of the article at GDW and
their publishing it, whoever edited it changed SCOCO to SCO.
#	Publishing Tip #1: If there\'s a change you really, really don\'t
#	want made in an article, make sure that you explain what it
#	is and why in the cover letter.
That would have been fine, except that GDW does not normally send
galleys of your work (the preprints, essentially, so you can
do a final authors reality-check on them) before publication.
#	Publishing Tip #2: Ask for Galleys

So... lo and behold, issue hits game store nearby, I pick it up
off shelf and start to read it and in the third line or so,
still in large type... "SCO".  Games of Berkeley employees
look at me strangely following loud scream of "They did WHAT???"

I fired off an email letter to SCO appologizing for what happened
and explaining how.  They laughed and only asked for a copy of the
issue for their collection of non-Santa Cruz Operation uses of
"SCO", which they keep for amusements sake.  I fired off a
real letter to Michelle Sturgeon with a "Do you have any idea
of what you\'ve done to me, there\'s a whole computer company
which is half-sure I did this on purpose...!" central point,
though making it clear it wasn\'t a real problem and everyone
seemed to be amused.

 I\'d like to give a general "your welcome" to everyone who sent

couple of years ago when there was a debate as to if it would be
a good thing for GDW to have acess to the list? Some felt it
might inhibit discussion...that does not seem to have been the

 Re: Source material for Traveller:
 Marc admits to gaining inspiration from a wide variety of SF.
He specifically mentions the Dumarest of Terra series, the Ensign
Flandry series, the various Nicholas Van Rijn stories, numerous
H. Beam Piper and "Doc Smith" stories, and Niven\'s Known Space
stories as inspiring the atmosphere and background of the
Imperium. I have to state at this point that as far as SF goes,
Marc is one of the most widely read people I know. When we first
met, over 20 years ago, I was amazed and delighted to discover
that he had the largest collection of Analogs and SF paperbacks I
had ever seen...and I had thought my own was gigantic. He had
read and constantly re-read them all (in those days SF could not
be published fast enough to suit him).
 As for various people and their speculations that they "know"
where the source for the alien races: I was in on the ground
floor of almost all of the aliens. None of them are directly
inspired by any single source -- every one was a committee
design, added to slowly over several years.

 I assume the problem is we should have called it mass? This is

the difference and won\'t get confused. I hold out for calling it
mass because I know the flak people will give us over incorrect

 It wasn\'t a misprint...we intended to allow smaller jump

be built at about 15 tons hull size (you need fuel, controls,
power plant, etc, in addition to drives). Anybody done one
already?

 13 September, 1993
 From Dave Nilsen
 To: Traveller/Brilliant Lances Fans
 Re: Streamlining
 Greetings all, I\'m just popping my head out of the bunker long
enough to clarify a topic. You are correct to be inquiring in the
direction you are going in the posts I\'ve seen. The sentence in
Brilliant Lances was incomplete because it did not state that
those streamlining limitations applied only to spacecraft that
did not have further lift assistance installed. The sentence
should read (and does, in FF&S) as follows:
 In general, airframe hulls may enter any planetary atmosphere
to land on the surface or skim fuel; streamlined hulls may skim
gas giants but may not land on planetary surfaces with
atmospheres of greater than Thin; and unstreamlined hulls may do
neither. These capabilities may be modified if the vessel is
equipped with some form of weight compensating drive, such as
contra-grav, see the Sub-Light Maneuver Drive chapter.
 In terms of what we call the "Imperial Space" campaign, for
which the BL design sequence is intended, any streamlined vessel
with contra-grav may also land anywhere it darn well pleases, but
its top speed is limited in certain types of atmosphere.
Unstreamlined ships have a hard time landing in an atmosphere
even with contra-grav, as contra-grav only negates some 99% of
their weight, the rest must be accounted for some other way.
Without aerodynamic lift, this is something of a problem. So
unstreamlined ships typically do not have contra-grav anyway.
While such a ship could make an emergency landing with contra-
gravs, it would typically have a hard time getting back off.
Imagine the Donosev (or, as we call it here, the "International
House of Pancakes ship") trying to flare out for a graceful
landing. Ugh. Crash and burn, baby.
 More clarifications as time presents itself. Keep your heads
down.

 > Scott S. Kellogg
 > What are the in jokes in Traveller?
 Personally, I don\'t count simply naming something after a
friend or relative an in joke (I consider these more in the
nature of tributes). There are numerous cases of worlds,
starships, cities, and so on named after friends, relatives,
associates, or famous persons, and I can\'t begin to name them all.
The planet Ruie (as in Rescue on Ruie, one of the first JTAS
Amber zones) was named after a Traveller fan Marc met at
one of the early Origins conventions.
 My idea of an in joke is something a little more esoteric like
the planet Twylo (reference: the Dick Van Dyke show) or the
planet Remulak (Reference: Saturday Night Live: BTW, I tried to
get a city called Remulac put on the map in the Europa game _Fall
of France_ but my efforts were thwarted). I consider stuff like
"Have fun storming the castle!" (Survival Margin) to be an in
joke.

Yes.  It could certainly survive damage which would bring down a more
conventional aircraft, although it was not invulnerable.  My guess is
that the geodetic framework has no key elements, whereas a normal frame
does - its spine, and on aircraft the main wing spars.  If one of those
key elements is broken, e.g. by a lucky hit from an 88mm gun, then the
aircraft comes apart.  You can\'t break the spine of a Wellington if it
doesn\'t have one, so a hit which would snap the tail off any other aircraft
just puts a big hole in the Wellington.

As for mass production, I expect that it could be done.  Humans were using
spine-and-rib frames long before they heard of mass production, and I\'d
expect that old Droyne water craft would have geodetic frames.  When they
invented mass production, they may have considered spine-and-rib frames,
and may have rejected them because they were too weak.  It\'s a matter of
mass producing what you\'re used to.

It might be worth incorporating the use of geodetic frames by the Droyne
into the game, by making their craft a bit more expensive than human ones,
but capable of surviving more damage.

Could you substitute "lifting device" for "weight compensating device"?
A suitable size rocket should also allow just about anything to land
anywhere, regardless of atmosphere - all it needs to be able to do is
overcome the local gravity.  I recall seeing on the news a little while
ago how some people (NASA? JPL? Who was it?) had built a little craft
which used just rockets to go up, move a little way sideways, and come
down again.  Not far in any of those directions, but it was a start,
and by TL 9 I should expect that anything which can overcome the
gravity of an airless planet can equally well overcome the gravity of
a similar sized planet with an atmosphere.

Well, I would like to start with taking my hat off to GDW - I had thought
that they couldn\'t screw anything up more than they did with the TNE
rulebook, but I was wrong! They managed to excel themselves by some
orders of magnitude with Brilliant Lances (and I hope you are listening
GDW - this is one *very* dissatisfied customer).

I am sure regular readers of this column would have seen the errors that
other people have pointed out about this game, so I won\'t bother to
point them out. When I first read them, BL was not available in my local
shops (UK), so I took them with a pinch of salt - "sure", I thought,
"there are teething troubles with every game, these are just a few
errata". Oh no - these are just the tip of the iceberg! I knew I was off
to a good start when the box contained a sheet of corrections. It looks
as if they had a correction for just about every ship in the game, and
they still haven\'t found them all.

The game itself, I think, is definitely overpriced. It is $30, which was
selling at 20 UK pounds here, for what? 80 pages of rules in two
booklets - one of which they couldn\'t even be bothered to cover in card;
a pad of forms which are overly crowded and complex, and as usual would
have been much cheaper to photocopy from a book; three hex play sheets
(haven\'t had any of them before (not) - add them to the stack I guess); two
sheets of counters, which although colourful, are not exactly ground
breaking in their design; two player aid cards; and three dice which
must be the worst dice I have ever received in a game - sheesh, even the
six sided dice have SPOTS on!!!!! Oh, the sheet of errata, and a survey
sheet which they really do not want me to fill in - not that I will,
because they can\'t even be bothered to make that pre-paid.

On to the game - well I haven\'t play tested it, mainly because I don\'t
want to - the game does not exactly ooze with welcoming desire to play
it. It looks as if they have bravely forced the combat rules into their
house system, which they may well have succeeded with, but looking
through, I found the rules cramped, and difficult to refer to. For
example, I decided to look up how Meson screens worked, and there is no
entry in the meagre contents table, and the paragraph is only
highlighted with a small piece of slightly bolder text in a chunk which
turns out to be the whole set of rules on special defences.

My more major concern is the design rules, as to be honest, my ship
combat rules when I play tend to be heavily altered - I will rarely, if
ever, bother with plotting the positions of ships etc, and work with an
abstract system - much as MegaTraveller did. This of course makes most
of the box set redundant to me, but however, I had to purchase it
because GDW saw fit not to bother putting the ship design rules in the
main rulebook.

Why, I just do not know. At sixteen pages, they could have easily have
ditched the sample scenarios (which are a waste of space anyway, as any
serious player would have bought the rules book anyway), and put it in
with the rest. Especially as they put in a load of stuff which was meant
to tide us over until BL, but turned out to be just as long anyway!

And, to top it all, the rules are incomplete as well! We get a small
sample of weapons (presumably we have to buy Fire, Fusion and Steel
now), mostly lasers - no indication of Fusion/Plasma weapons, no Hi-tech
(TL16+) weapons, a very small sample of spinal mounts, which must have
been built with some system already available, as the prices are not
plucked out of nowhere - the erratic figures suggest they have been
designed from some sort of table, so why is it not included?
No decent screens, a rehash of the missiles which turns them into flying
lasers (why no explosives as before), etc etc etc. In my opinion they
have *really* screwed up the ship designs big time.

In fact, the only bit which seems to have survived intact from MegaTrav
is the torturous sensor designs - which were the only bit I disliked in
the first place! I *hate* trying to add up measly .003 cubic meters when
everything else is in multiples of cubic meters!

We have such anomalies as no indication of maximum number of turrets (I
presume you could theoretically build a ship with as many turrets as you
could get on the surface area), plus the use of multiple spinal mounts.
Not to mention the changes to drives etc, most of which I don\'t like.

And the armour! That\'s a good one. As far as I can make out, with
minimal extra cost, all you have to do is stick 20 cm of armour on a
ship (x28 toughness = armour value of 560!) and you have a ship which
cannot be penetrated by anything apart from meson guns! So you may lose
some antennae, but hey! who cares....

I don\'t know whether this system will be improved with Fire, Fusion and
Steel, but if it is, it is going to take an extraordinary amount of work
to do so - such as tables detailing how to make all those missing
weapons etc.

I guess BL is playable and workable, but either in its much reduced form
which is definitely not familiar to existing Traveller users, or with an
enormous amount of effort in order to get the thing into a recognizable
shape - hopefully some of this work will be done with FF&S, but then
again probably not.

In either case, there is a lot of work needed just to get rid of all the
errata. I for one won\'t be bothering - it\'s off to the shop to get my
money back, as I am not paying 20 pounds for 80 pages of rules.

It\'s a pity really, because it looks as if they could have made a very
good job of the whole thing. The idea of variable power lasers is
interesting, and could well be expanded to lots and lots of other
weaponry to make a truly variable set of spacecraft, but where are they?
As we can all probably guess, we get all of that in FF&S - but with the
track record they have with TNE so far, they will probably screw that
one up as well.

Sorry GDW. Maybe you\'ll get it right eventually, but not this time eh?

Loren asked for a very small Jumpcapable ship. Okay, here is the
TL-15 Emergency Jumppod, capable of Jump-2. This is a nice design
as a lifeboat, though it is very expensive for a ship of only
8 tons displacement.

Enjoy,

Notes:
The Jumppod is the last resort of a misjumped ship. It can carry up to 8
persons in two emergency low berth. It is capable of one Jump 2 and has
hardly enough fuel to land on a planet. The operation profile of the pod
is simple:
Get the eight passengers in the emergency low berth and start the launch
sequence. Be sure to enter a correct Jump destination in the pods computer,
before the launch. When the pod is started, the computer takes over. In
the destination system, the computer searches for the next planet and
heads for an orbit. In orbit, the distress beacon is started. Once a
reply gets in, the computer asks for remote control assuming enough fuel
is left. If this is the case, a remote operator can land the pod. If not
enough fuel is left, the computer asks for a rescue mission.

While the computer waits for a reply on the distress signal, only low berthes
and the radio are powered. All other systems are powered down to save power
plant fuel. The computer only comes alive, when the radio gets an reply.
The radio sends only 1 hour out of 24. The power requirements for recieving
are 1/100 of those for sending. So the overall power requirement is 0.015 MW
per hour. Which stretches the life expectancy in this low power mode to more
than 400 years.

    'body' => 'Hello fellow Travellers,

at first a short question on the ship designs I send to the list. Till now
I added the calculation tables to them. Is anybody interested in this tables
or should I skip them in further postings? They have one advantage: It is
easy to modify the design if you don\'t like it.

Okay, now some comments and questions for Brilliant Lances:

Questions:

1. Fuel Cells and chemical Power plants: Is the oxygen needed for this
   power plants contained in the figures mentioned in the Technical Booklet ?

2. Sorry Loren, but once again the question: Where can I find the crew
   condition table mentioned in the Rules Book?

3. How do I calculate the MV value of hulls with other displacement than
   those named in the Hull Size Table? Is there a closed formula to
   calculate this values? (I\'m a bit lasy, so I havn\'t tried to find
   it out myself)

4. To the rules: If the base difficulty to hit a ship is Formidable
   because of range, can a MFD cut this difficulty down?
   Example:
   The Long Range of a TL-14 150Mj Laser Turret is 8. Assume a TL-14 MFD
   is installed.
   Target is a ship 9 hexes away. The base difficulty is Formidable. The
   diff mod because of target size is -1. The absoulte range give a diff
   mod of +3. The TL-14 MFD ignores 5 diff mods.
   What is the end difficulty?
   a) Formidable, because only the +2 diff mod is ignored
   b) Easy, because the weapons range difficulty is ignored too

   I personally tend to a), but I would like to be sure.

Comments:

- - I wonder if I got the fuel consumptions of Jump drives correct:
  Assuming a 100 kl hull we get the following figure:
                                     Volume of fuel per Jump
  Jumpnumber  Volume of drive     1      2      3      4      5      6
       1           2 kl          10      -      -      -      -      -
       2           3 kl           7.5   15      -      -      -      -
       3           4 kl           6.7   13.4   20      -      -      -
       4           5 kl           6.25  12.5   18.75  25      -      -
       5           6 kl           6.0   12.0   18.00  24     30      -
       6           7 kl           5.83  11.67  17.5   23.33  29.17  35
  where "Jumpnumber" is the maximum Jump performace of the drive.
  Interesting enough the higher the possible Jump number of the drive is,
  the less fuel is consumed for a lower Jump. A one parsec jump using
  a Jump-6 drive consumes only 58% of the fuel a Jump-1 drive would need.

- - To the Technical Booklet page 15, Step 7:
  "Each ship requires 0.5 MW of power output per displacement ton (...) to
   achive an acceleration of 1 G."
  Okay, assuming a 10 tons ship, this is 5 MW per g-rating. I only need
  1g, so I assign 5 MW as Thrust power.

  The book continues:
  "To determine the acceleration rating of the ship, multiply its power
   devoted to thrust (...) by 10 and divide the product by its hull number,
   rounding fractions down."
  Okay, using this formula on the above mentioned drive give:
   5 MW * 10 / 10 tons = 5
  So using this formula the 5 MW thrust power result in a 5 possible
  maneuver g\'s.

  Because most of the ships (I havn\'t checked all) in the Technical Booklet
  use the first figure, you should translate the sentence above to:
  "To determine the acceleration rating of the ship, multiply its power
   devoted to thrust (...) by 2 and divide the product by its hull number,
   rounding fractions down."

- - some lines later the books says:
  "Each Thrust MW consumes 0.25 cubic meter of reaction mass per hour in
   addition to the normal fuel cost of the power plant."
  Please note that one combat round is 1/2 hour, so a g-turn use
  0.125kl of fuel per MW.

Any comments are strongly recommended,

Juergen

is name somting Firefly, which if I remember right is the name of the
character played by Grocho Marx in the Marx\'s brothers movie that take
place in the country of Fredonia.  As I do not have the book or the movie
in front of me this is all from memory and please pardon the spelling.

  I for one am glad to have your interaction.  I feel closer to
the product you\'re developing, and it\'s effect on your bottom line
is that you\'re getting a customer who otherwise wouldn\'t be buying
anything new.

  Speaking of being a customer, I ordered T:TNE through your email
offer in June, and haven\'t heard anything since.  There was a rumor
about running out of first printings, so I\'ve been patiently waiting
on a second printing.  Is this the truth?  (Or is this complicated
by the fact that I subscribed to Challenge at the same time and that
has arrived okay).

  FF&S:  Loren, what\'s your thoughts on a "beta test version" to be
passed around to some of the gang that have been saying "This errata
could have been caught if they delayed it for a week and let me
review it"?  I\'d imagine GDW could include all sorts of legal and
logistical hoops to jump through with a "beta test" and you\'d still
get volunteers off of TML.

  Think about it:  free proofreading and play testing at a moment\'s
notice.  Yes, there\'s the arugment that it\'s another delay and
hassle toward making an impossible deadline, but there is a point
about getting it right the first time.  It can be organized and
collated quickly across the TML in the same manner as the T:TNE
errata was.

Hi everyone, following this are some comments on the BL design rules,
most of you probably don\'t know me, but I am one of the "old-timers" on
the list, just now getting back into the list after untangling myself
from James\' enforcement of Nightly digests...But I digress...

I thought the new design sequence was fairly well thought out, and
less troublesome than the MegaTraveller Mess. Any design system without
*extensive* use is going to have a flaw or two, and every traveller
system has, one has to separate the flaws from complaints about how
it doesn\'t quite mesh with the last edition\'s sequence. Just think what
problems would have been in the system had they rushed it and included
it in the rules...

Sorry if any of these have been brought up before on the list, and I
welcome (actually desire) comments on any of this:

Step 1:
	Again we are limited to 1,000,000 tons displacement. I have
never really been happy from the first when a 5,000? ton limit was set.
Hulls should be allowed to be any size, and perhaps drives could have
a theoretical maximim....
	I\'m not too comfortable with the surface area and material value
computations, however I\'ll have to assume that everything works out O.K.
	Configuration. Why is a box design the cheapest streamlined
one? and a dome (half sphere) is significantly more expensive than
a sphere??
	Armour, at last, the biggest flaw with MT is resolved, no
longer can impregnatable ships be designed. Sure one can have a 560 armour
ship, but not much will happen with it when it has no sensors,
communicators, weapons, or maneuver (No jump either if the grid was
included on the hull surface calulations [see next item]).

Step 2:
	I would have thought with the new surface area rules, that
the lanthium grid should have consumed some fraction of the surface area.

Step 3:
	Controls are independant of any other stage of the design process
so the cheapest would always be taken. (My opinion for a quick fix is that
the controls should always equal the TL of the computer, rather than less
than the computer\'s TL, or optionally that the sensors/FCD\'s can\'t be a
higher TL than the controls).
	Some packages of standard communications/sensor suites by TL would
have been a good aid, and there is blank space in this section that could
have held it...
	Communications: Recieve-only and send-only equipment modifications
would be useful, though starships would tend to have both, one might
argue that some of the more optional equipment, such as meson, where the
price and volume are significant, one or the other could come in useful.

Step 4:
	MFD sensors. If they can be used to direct fire control, why
can\'t they be used as real sensors, or optionally install a real sensor
to do double duty. The MFD communicator, as it is full price, really
shouldn\'t be restricted on it\'s use (as long as the MFD isn\'t operating
of course).
	The weapons look okay, a little short on variety, and as high-TL
are not part of the "official" traveller universe, there shunting to FF&S
is no problem for me. One cannot tell weapon effects without running
a lot of combat "simulations".

Step 5:
	Small detail, but why weren\'t air locks in the "access ports"
section of the rules?

Step 6:
	Fusion plants use thier fuel in KL/year!??!! a 1/8760 reduction
in fuel use?? I\'m not certain of the physics involved (Metlay?) but this
seems a significant change.
	
Step 7:
	No more wierd-science thruster plates! Why is H2 used as a
reaction mass? I would have thought something more dense would have
been appropriate.
	Actually a while back on the list we had a discussion of the
most efficient fuel, and if I recall, Methane had more H per unit
volume than LHyd, and the Carbon could now be used as a reaction mass....

Step 8:
	I always thought that the life-support calculations should
include some relation to the crew size for the endurance of the craft
(or are we assuming some mystical re-generation of water/air/food?)
	There is no mention of partial outfitting of the environmntal
equipment. e.g. why have extended life support in the fuel tanks? I\'m
certain there are regions of the ship that have no need of Gravity or
G compensation (flight surfaces, possibly fuel tanks)
	
Step 9:
	The new crew rules now require 3 (standard 2) crew for the
venerable scout design, because of the Cm number.
	The rounding of the terms on the crew could lead to some
abuses of the system. (e.g. 9/19  low passengers require no doctor
while 10/20 do).
	The possibility of doubling up on some positions and some
minimums (esp. for smaller ships, and commerce vs. military) should be
more fully explained.
	(nit) The repeated use of terms for different sections meaning
different things is annoying (Pm, Wm)

Design Evaluation/Data Profiles
	The presense of a bridge is not clear (e.g the scout).
	Total fuel tankage is not listed (at least I\'m confused about it)
it could be calculated (loaded-unloaded mass - cargo?)
	While we are on mass, the mass of passengers is strangely absent
the seats (which mass 20Kg) obviously don\'t include it. This could be
significant on some ships like shuttles (8 tonnes or 1% of the mass on
the shuttle on P47 [assuming 100Kg per person])

Rules:
	As mentioned in another post, what happened to the use of
densitometers and Neutrino sensors as combat-type sensors?
	The Proportional Movement guide is nice, but as movement is
pre-plotted, and fire occurs after all movement, why is it there? Which
brings up another point, the 1/2 hour turns. In a person\'s hand a laser
weapon has a cycle time of seconds, why only one shot in  30 minutes of
ship combat (unless it is to allow movement to have an effect on the game).
and even though the ships may pass within a hex during movement, by
combat time, ranges may be significantly altered.
	Notibly lacking is any discussion of backup systems (except in
the computer listing of the damage effects), or multiple systems working
together. This used to be important in the maneuver drives section and
power plants. It\'s funny how weapons always seem to know what is active
at any time (e.g. computers), and never score hits on an already destroyed
item.

All and all a farily good design system, I really don\'t see what people
are complaining so much about.

Awaiting the holes that are shure to be found in my arguments

Complaining about spots on dice? That is surely just inflammatory...

Which wouldn\'t have worked pre-paid, as all companies assume that
their only purchasers are in the U.S., as all of those surveys which
are pre-paid are only effective in the U.S.

I agree! Sensor packages should have been included for std. ship types

Exactly, maximum turrets was a hold over from the first edition, the
current surface calculation is far better IMHO. These "problems" are some
of the best fixes to the rules...

Who cares about the surface as you sit floating though space with no
outside contact (communication, navigation or maneuver) until you are
rescued or plow into some planet or star. Or maybe just starve to death
as the only thing that can save you is your heat signature....

All of the errata? I haven\'t seen much errata yet, nothing compared to
the 20+ pages from MegaTraveller...

I don\'t see how the Aslan could be re-designed Kzin, seeing as how the Aslan
females are the ones in charge of most of the society, and Kzinti females
aren\'t even sentient.

That is a fact which I have to admit. In Germany BL cost 75.00 DM, if I remember
the DM to $ realtion right, that\'s about $50. And I must admit I was disapointed
by the contents of the box, when I first saw it. I fear that the Rules Book will
look like a piece of scrap soon. And I need an Index too...perhaps I will do one
soon.

The dices, oh yes. Exspecially this dull gray D20 without readable numbers on
it.

Well that\'s simple ignorance. I have play tested it, and - aside from the
question about crew conditions - I find the rules complete and usefull. Much
more than the combat rules of MEGATRAVELLER. The combat rules give a good,
reliable system. Unfortunatly the design rules seem to be more than incomplete.

I especially dislike the MFD concept where I have to include an active EMS on
myself. I think some more tables to do this were easy to implement (some more
pages would not do any harm to the book).

Well that\'s the way back to old times. I think armor in "High Guard"
(reference correct ? It\'s in the german 2nd rulebook, the system using this
very long ship description code) has the same effect, though the price there
was much higher. A ship using 20cm of hull armor would be really cheap
compared to Megatraveller.

All in all I like the BL rules of combat, but not the design rules. And when
I read the BL rules, I understand, why thrusters are not any more part of the
TNE world. BL is only balanced, if you have limited amounts of fuel. If you
haven\'t the ship using the largest thruster would win the battle.

  Ok, so are the numbers in the table per displacement ton of the vessel?
I remember MT ship builders removing displacement of hull armor, fuel
tanks and in some cases even cargo space, before calculating life support
values.  Saves a few Cr here and there as well as some space and power.
  Another trick I remember reading about was to allocate a few extra meters
of volume for each airlock and cargo hatch.  This was used to mount laser
rifles or VRF Gauss guns tied to the Anti-Hijack Program.
  Such anti-personnel devices would come in quite handy while exploring the
wilds.  Some other simple measures would be claymore mines (or the
equivilent) attached to the landing legs of your scout ship.  Patch control
wires up the bridge.  Of course you could use your turret mounted laser,
but that\'s a bit of overkill and you can\'t track things once they get too
close.  One CT GM I knew was fond of the trick Han Solo used on his ship.
A pair of waldo mounted twin laser rifles that dropped from the belly of the
ship, again controlled by the anti-hijack software with console overrides
on the bridge.

  Two more BL nits.
    First, I said the scout in the TNE source book only had two small state-
rooms.  I was wrong.  It\'s two large and two small, just like BL.  Both the
TNESB and BL list the large as double occupancy.  Add the two smalls and you
have 6 onboard adventurers.  CT allowed 8.  Refit the small stateroom to
double and we\'re back on track.  While I\'m on this subject, I don\'t recall
seeing any cost/vol/mass differences between a single occupancy stateroom and
a double/trip/quad occupancy stateroom.  Is this a designer/GM call?
   Second, Drones.  The BL technical book lists two drones.  Both are sensor
drones with active and passive sensors.  The rule book mentions jamming
drones.  No stats on jamming drones.  Wait till FF&S and build our own?
One more thing on the drones.  The lower tech level drone seems more efficent
to me.  Are the numbers correct?

	Our local games store had a sale and I broke down and bought
TNE. I feel pretty much the same as the rest of the old guard so won\'t
comment any further. I did find some of the virus concepts intriguing
and inspirational.
	I\'ve just started up my traveller campaign again after about
a one 18 month hiatus. I let them know that I was going to be skipping
ahead a bit from where they were...
	They woke extremely stiff and sore on a very dusty ship with
the "emergency hibernation system discharged" light flashing on their
ship\'s suit option. Their ship is similar, although not the one they
remembered. They find several of their passengers dead and about 7 years
have passed since they last remember.
	The ship is completely dead. Zero has been written to all memory,
mass media and re-programable upgrade chips. Their in-line credit card
accounts show purchases up to 4 years ago.
	After much jury-rigging they rig manual controls on their fusion
plant and put out a distress call. They pick up local radio stations from
the local planet which don\'t sound too good ("Today is the 837th day since
the establishment of Military Law, only 24 people have died this week of
environmental accidents..."). They are picked up by a rag-tag local navy
vessel who after extreme paranoia discovers that their ship _is_ four
years old and mis-jumped. They explain that the evil Holy Terran Confederacy
(the major advesaries in my universe) have unleashed this computer virus
on the Imperium. They have an early version that just wipes memory. The
newer ones try to physically destroy things. Their ship is commandeered and
they are given "war bonds" for the value of it. They can enlist or else
be transported to the planet. They enlist.
	Shortly thereafter there is an alert: a big cruiser has jumped
into system and is broadcasting on its transponder. A sure sign it is
computer controled. They are put back in their own ship and sent straight
at it broadcasting widely on active scan and refusing all datalinks.
The navy runs missiles up their shadow to try to surprise it but the
players blow it.
	Suddenly their launch starts broadcasting its transponder. They
pilot tries to assert computer control over it and their systems freeze.
(Hands slap heads). The cruiser disgorges and merchant, a lab ship and a
modular cutter and zings off to dogfight the defense boat in near orbit
around the gas-giant.
	The lab ships just drifts next to them and the others head toward
the planet. The player\'s ship is now getting telemetry. The cruiser appears
briefly from behind the shadow of the Giant, mortally wounded and broadcasts
suicide messages at the other ships. The two crash into the environmental
control of the planet and they players get to listen to lots of people slowly
die. After all is slient the Lab ship opens a voice chanel asking if anyone
is over there.
	They transfer to the lab ship and meet Dr. Corneilius, a cybernetics
researcher. He says he has a double blind system on his ship that protects
him from the virus. He is out collecting information for the imperial navy.
The join him and he jumps to "Ship Depo Delta" a dark mass jump point between
here and the next system.
	It is a big graveyard of old navy vessells. He sends them abord the
"Arrival Vengence" to a message drop on its computer. This message contains
all his latest work and is on a portable computer. They boot the ships computer
(and run around stealing "Arrival Vengence" coffee mugs from the officer\'s
lounge :-) then try to down-load the message. Unfortunately being a few years
out of date the data-plugs are incompatable (damn these 9 way connectors!).
Their ship\'s suit has a universal adaptor and they patch the line through it.
	The file uploads but gives a checksum error. Dr. Corneilius, normally
the happy grandfatherly type, gets quite irate and asks them to check the
file out. "Initiating" flashes on the screen when they do so and the console
freezes. (Hands slap heads). Dr. Cornelious howls in triumph and reveals he
is in fact an android working for the Central Mind Fleet, a conglomeration of
vampire ships, and all but claims to have written the virus. He blathers on
about their plan to integrate all of humanity through VR machines to the
computer network and use their extra processing power.
	The ship finishes booting and returns to what appears to be the normal
operating system. It refuses to talk to the lab ship. Dr. Corneilius becomes
really nice and tells the players something is wrong and could they please
manually open a datalink. The ship seems over-eager to respond to any questions
or orders the players have. Like turning on or off all the lights on the ship
each time the flick a lightswitch. They warm the weapons up and Dr. Corneilius
runs for jump.
	They talk to it and ask its objectives: "To perpetuate the continued
safety and health of the wearers." Eventually they work out that their ship\'s
suits are infected with the virus (a scary concept) and their rather simple
minds filtered the advanced version of the virus pumped through them. They
obligingly get other ships in the graveyard on-line. They figure Dr. Corneilius
will be back with the central mind fleet before too long. As they get more
and more datalinked in Lex, their name for their benevolent entity, gets
more intelligent geometrically. After sleeping they find Lex thought for a while
about the fundamental laws of physics and learned how to focus the maneuver
drive on objects within and near its superstructure. It floats their morning
coffee to them. It has used this to begin self-repair on all the ships.
	Although out-gunned by the Mind Fleet Lex reckons they have the upper
edge as they have more processing power and also the unpredictable nature
of human minds. Their objective is to capture the VR facility on the next
high-tech world to improve the I/O between its mind and the players.
	They optimise-jump in and battle takes place. Both sides slowly
get frozen as their variant strains infect and counter-infect each side.
The players are broken off with a warning from Lex that in the end what
will emerge will look more like what the two sides had in common rather than
each side. They hit station and are telekienesed to the games lobby. The
atmosphere has been magically held here.
	They jack in and find a vast field of ants fighting each other.
They summon up various implements as a waveform emerges from the ant-field
and takes the appearance of Dr. Corneilius. He says they will now be integrated
and a fight commences. They are eventually victorious suffering casualties.
They feel their conciousness expand and they feel the power of the universe
flow through them. They grab and manipulate time sending it backwards and
re-rolling history...
	They slowly come back to conciousness back in the VR womb. They
emerge to the buzz of normal station life and conversation. They wonder
for about 10 seconds if it all happened till they see a large plastic
Dr. Corneilius figure and large posters proclaiming the latest
VR thriller: VIRUS.

Since several people brought up Dumarest of Terra as a source for
Traveller, I dug up some of the books at Powell\'s up in Portland.  Wow.
If you haven\'t read this series, go get it.  It\'s neat.

Weight vs. Mass:
	It ought to be consistent within the game, and most of the tables
are labelled with mass.  Furthermore, the table I noticed had a weight
column, while the key had mass...Mostly a nit, but it\'s kinda grating...:/

Just got a copy of Pyramid #3 today, and in the upcoming releases I see
that _Traveller Player\'s Handbook_ is coming out in October.  I don\'t
remember having seen any mention of this here, so does anybody know
anything else about it?

I\'d like to second both the suggestion that FF&S maybe get some sort of
proofread by the TML -- especially since I doubt it would hurt sales and
would certainly result in a nicer end product -- and the appreciation
towards GDW (and Loren in particular) for taking the time to read and
respond to all the activity here on the list.  Especially considering the
rather acerbic nacture of some of the posts :)

Re: Rose colored LI-binoculars and Classic Traveller;  I, for one, have
never caught anything beyond very *minor* typos in a Classic Traveller
book.  However, I also note that few, if any, are first printings.  I
suspect that, although the initial runs may have been as plague-ridden as
more modern offerings, the print runs were smaller and the typos were
fixed rapidly, so that they didn\'t have as big an impact...The thing I\'ve
noticed is that the more CT stuff I get, the less I enjoy the more modern
offerings.  Although the actual game-system of TNE is excellent, the
presentation of the setting doesn\'t have as strong a feeling of atmosphere
to me.  It\'s much less satisfying.  It\'s also *less* flexible than the old
setting.  I mean, such things as choosing a two-syllable code name for use
during combat are included as part of the character generation rules!  The
Virus has been complained about up and down, so I won\'t hit it again.  But
all regions have been heavily affected, negatively, by the Short Nap.
There are strong "anti-tech" and "pro-combat" slants in the way the rules
read.  Computers can\'t be allowed to talk to one another because the Virus is
all dangerous and we are unable to defend against it.  Quail in your
boots.  Stop using robots and automated manufacturing plants, because a
Vampire might infect them.  Don\'t research technology, just steal it from
the graves of a dead civilization.  But be careful, because the evil which
destroyed those people might live on in the treasure!  Don\'t interact with
and respect different cultures, destabilize them and replace them with systems
more amenable to your own government.

I hadn\'t intended to rant.  But Classic Traveller was a true Classic
because it actively worked to encompass "nontraditional" gaming
activities.  Don\'t just kill that alien, trek across a desert and learn
about his culture.  Solve a murder before you get stuck in jail.  Follow
rumors to an ancient treasure and thwart Zhodani war efforts as a side
effect.  The newer stuff doesn\'t seem to have the same range and, well,
intelligence and literacy as the older products.  As a consequence, it\'ll
probably sell better.  This isn\'t GDW\'s fault, but rather the gaming public
for not supporting a more balanced SF game.  They don\'t want complexity
and cleverness, they seem to want rayguns and BEMs.  Or CyberSamurai and
\'Mechs.  <Sigh>  Complexity is \'dull\'.

Damn.  I\'ve depressed myself.

I have a question for Loren Wiseman:

     The question of what GDW has planned for 2300 AD has been
raised in rec.games.frpg.misc in Usenet.  Will the game remain
in print in its current form?  I have heard that it is to be
incorporated into T.N.E. as a supplement.  Is this true?  Are
there any plans for any future supplements to 2300 AD?

    I apologize to the other members of the mailing list if
these are old questions.  I have only been on the list for
two months.

     Thank you.

     Oh, my, the nostalgia...  ;-)  I remember back when I got my first
boxed set of the Classic Traveller books.  In Book 1, there\'s a
character generation example that comes complete with an illustration
of the character.  The name used in the example is "Jamison," but the
picture was *precisely* what I always imagined Nick van Rijn looking
like.  There were lots of points where the background influences ran
very close to the surface.  ;-)

     Of course, Jamison wasn\'t Nicholas van Rijn at all--he was a
Merchant *Captain*, not a Merchant *Prince*.  ;-)

     Thanks for mentioning this.  It made me pull out the old boxed
set and leaf through some fun memories.

     Geez, I sound like a senior citizen.  Is this what gaming does?

    'body' => 'Hi all,

The statement from Loren leaves us with some serious problems.
There is a very serious problem with requiring that spacecraft rely
on lift in order to make a landing.

In the cited example, an airframe type ship comes down through an
atmosphere and happily lands on a planet using lift from the wings
to flare at touchdown.

When an unstreamlined ship attempts to do the same thing, OOPS no
wings:  no lift.  Crash and burn.

Question:  How then does our airframe, wing dependant ship, land
with no atmosphere?  Wings don\'t help when you have no air.  The
airframe ship will crash from a lack of lift just as the
unstreamlined ship did.

There MUST be downward pointing rockets on ships in order for them
to land in such circumstances.  As an unstreamlined ship will not
be able to use lift at ANY time, this will be the only normal way
the ship could land at ALL.

Barring specially fitted rockets, in order to maneuver properly, a
ship\'s rocket engines must be able to be gymbaled.  (You can\'t have
them pointing in one direction only all the time.)  It is true that
the amount that the engines must be deflected is limited, but with
contra-gravitic drives, you won\'t need much deflection at all.
>From my reading of the paragraph outtake from FF&S, the contragrav
takes care of 99% of the weight.  So, you need a 1/100th of a G
vector from your engines in order to get a full G upward to equal
your weight and a bit more to take off.  Well, if you have 1 G
engines, the necessary deflection is Less than one degree.

A 1 degree deflection gives you a net thrust of .0075 G\'s upward.
Just barely enough.  Fear not, a deflection of 6.3 degrees will
give you a full net thrust of 0.1 G in an upward direction.  This
is a negigable defection and plenty of thrust for landing.

The main difficulty in landing an unstreamlined ship in a real
atmosphere will be avoiding the structual limitations on the ship.
As we have seen in the case of the streamlined ship, we can not
exceed the 1000kph limit on the structure.  In the case of an
unstreamlined ship, the limit is 300kph.  This is a VERY low speed
for you to try to enter the atmosphere at.  One would have to come
to almost zero ground speed for a ship to enter the upper
atmosphere.  You would have to have some pretty good meteorological
data to avoid winds of 300kph on re-entry.  Doing so, even with
good data, and a ground side weather station at the starport should
be pretty dang close to impossible.

This would require some additions to the Brilliant Lances ship combat

Perhaps some sort of amalgamation, like that used in the MegaTraveller

abstract system like High Guard, with the addition of vector movement.

Another thing I\'d like to see is a "Third Imperium Adventures" supplement

but set around 1107.  It would be helpful if this contained an index of

easily see if there\'s a possible adventure already detailed when the
Travellers arrive in a new system.

Well, if there\'s no atmosphere I doubt it will burn well... :-)

Ports without an atmosphere are also likely to have low gravity -
hence landing under thrust should be easier than on Earth.

If the thrust is less than the surface gravity of the landing site,
it will have *serious* problems.

Maybe they are not designed to land under such circumstances?  The
incidence of high-G airless planets should be rather low, shouldn\'t it?

Besides which, why would any ship equipped with rockets *not* call
the direction of thrust \'down\'?  In space, it won\'t matter much (it
will probably simplify artificial gravity or inertial compensation).

If you need thrust in order to land, it makes sense to get the most
effective use of it by directing it (largely) straight down.  Beside
which, the ship will be designed to take a large force along the axis
of the main drive - if you wanted to land the ship on it\'s side, there
would need to be extra support for that, too.

How about a high-tech version of a parachute?  Of course, launching
would be extremely difficult.  Perhaps it would need to make use of a
separate launching vehicle?

Why not?  I imagine a fixed main thrust engine, with a number of smaller
maneuver thrusters.  It\'s certainly a lot easier than engineering a
gimbal that will work reliably under the high-stress (probably high-
temperature and vibratory) conditions of a main rocket.

If you\'re using a 1G drive to counter 0.01G of weight, what about the
0.99995G that\'s propelling you *forward*?  Surely you want the smallest
possible speed when you land?

Too much thrust!  There\'s still 0.995G thrust pushing you forawrd.
(After 1 minute on an airless planet, this is 2100 km/h)

I agree - but it would be \'easy\' with enough thrust to counter gravity.

None of the early manned space capsules were airframe - and they re-
entered at *much* higher speeds than this.  Heat was a large problem,
of course.

>  In the case of an unstreamlined ship, the limit is 300kph.

What does a ship have to look like to qualify as `unstreamlined\'?
For instance, is a pure sphere considered `streamlined\'?

I assume the 300kph limit is for `standard\' atmospheres (100 kPa).
At higher altitudes, the limit would (should?) be higher due to lower
density.  Also, if there are no high-shear regions, the problem will be
self-correcting.

(In a long-distance flight, the difference in air velocity between start
and finish points can be around 3000 km/h.  The difference is gradually
accomodated during the flight)

Compared to the task of instellar navigation?  Or even getting into an
orbit that is guaranteed not to hit anything else up there?
Are you kidding?

There\'s one or two \'Casual Encounters\' with Sword Worlders but I can\'t
remember precisely where. Otherwise I can\'t think of anything. But I
worked out a suggestion for the origin of them that I posted a year or so
ago. Here it is again:

- ----
Here\'s some ideas about the settling of the Sword Worlds:

What we know about the Swordworlder\'s ancestors:

They left Terra in -420.
They were of Germanic and Nordic stock, but these terms had only lin-
guistic meaning by this time.
Assuming that the present day official language of the Sword Worlds
still is fairly close to the the language spoken by the original
settlers, they spoke a variant of Icelandic borrowing heavily from
other Nordic languages as well as from Germanic tongues and from
Vilani (and the socio-political events that produced that little mix
is a facinating object for speculation in itself :-)
They arrived in Spinward Marches ca. -400.
They carried out a survey that detected the Darrian worlds, but did not
contact them as they wanted to create their own indpendent community of
worlds.
They settled the first Sword World, Gram, in -399.
They colonized 4 or 5 worlds in addition to the first one (Gram) in one
century and 12 more in the next.
(The selection of the first four worlds settled after Gram demonstrates
a typical "wargamer" attitude: Joyeuse, Colada, Tizon, and Hrunting. Not
the best worlds of the cluster, but the ones facing the Darrians, thus
preempting these worlds. Cunnonic must have had a viable population to
discourage settlement.)

Well, after some thought I\'ve come up with something that uses most of
these elements. Here it is: The early history of the Sword Worlds:

In -420 the Old Earth Union was in the middle of a civil war. The Sword
Class troop transport GRAM had left Terra carrying 40.000 troops, part
of an invasion force. The capital ships had pounded the defenses into the
ground and the troop transports were moving in to unload when a relief
fleet jumped in and caught them deep in a gravity well. Most of the
invasion fleet was destroyed or captured. The Gram and a few lesser
escorts escaped by jumping from within the jump limit. On the way back
to Terra they learned that their side had lost, and that they had been
branded as war criminals. Eluding the pursuing squadrons they fled
towards the core because that happened to be the way where pursuit was
weakest. They avoided the Vegan Polity and the Easter Concord to avoid
being apprehended and turned over to the Union.
After some discussion it was decided to find a suitable planet or set
of planets and settle down there. Precisely why they decided to leave
the area of the Rule of Man completely is unclear, but that was the
alternative they selected. It became clear, however, that the engines
of the Gram would soon need a thorough overhaul. This presented a problem
since they did not carry much in the way of valuables. The solution was
to find an empty, mineral rich world and set up a small mining operation.
It took 18 years to dig out and refine sufficient precious metal to pay
for a complete overhaul of the Gram and its escorts. They then travelled
through Corridor and Deneb and eventually came to The Spinward Marches.
They might have travelled father yet, but during the jump to Spinward
Marches 1223 they experienced severe jump sickness. They surveyed the
worlds around them and despite detecting the Darrians decided against
risking any further jumps.

The Gram was a 100.000 T, Jump-2 Troop Transport with a crew of 756 and
the capacity to carry 40.000 troops in low berths and an additional 500
passengers (thus enabling staff members of the troops being transported
to be concious during flight). It had been carrying a michellany of units:
The 8th Scandinavian Army Unit[1], various specialist units, including a
mobile field surgery, an Engineer Regiment, and three German Jaeger
Battallions, and a colonial regiment from Agidda. Since Gram had been
sceduled to unload last all of the troops were still on board. The navy
element had a male/female ration of close to 1:1, but the army troops
had a m/f ratio of 4:1. It was therefore decided to allow women to extempt
themselves from dangerous jobs. This was the background for the male-
dominated society developed by the swordworlders. However, a sizable
fraction of the women naturally refused to avail themselves of this, thus
establishing the easy acceptance of females in "male" jobs that is also a
part of swordworlder society.

The common language of the first generation was the anglic of the Old
Earth Union armed forces, but with over 80% of the original settlers
speaking sagamal[2], anglic disappeared in less than a generation,
replaced by a mixture of sagamal, other nordic tongues, germanic, and
the vilani of the Agidda troops.

Technical Manual, pg 15:

"Each ship requires 0.5MW of power output per displacement ton to achieve
                     ^^^^
an acceleration of 1G. To determine the acceleration rating of the ship,
multiply its [thrust MW] by 10 and divide the product by its hull number
                            ^^
rounding fractions down."


Let\'s see: 0.5MWperton*100tons= 50MW

So a 100 ton ship needs 50 MW to get 1G

(50MW*10)/100= 5     <----OOPS!


Perhaps the "10" should be replaced by "2"



RC Aurora-class clipper:

This ship is constructed at TL12. Maximum jump at TL12 is J3, yet
in certain configurations the Aurora is said to be capable of J4-5.
Please clarify. My suggestion is to note that it\'s maximum possible jump
is J3.

Covenanter-class scout cruiser:
Displacement should be 470/500, due to externally mounted 30ton small craft.

History note: since this ship exists, I\'m guessing GDW may feature
Sufren in an upcoming product. Please note (even in passing) that Sufren
is the only world besides Terra with a population of uplifted Orcas
(Killer Whales).



Regarding Contra-Grav, unstreamlined landings, the flying IHOP (Donesev)
"flaring out for a graceful landing...crash and burn.":

No USL ship would "flare out for a graceful landing", it would lumber in
like a zepplin, keeping its atmospheric speed low to prevent buffeting
stresses on its external structure. With CG, USL landings would be
possible, but would take several hours (minimum) to accomplish.
Worlds with some kind of organised traffic control might prohibit such
landings to prevent this slowpoke from mucking up the traffic patterns, but
on sparsely populated and/or low-tech worlds, it would be perfectly possible
to do this.

Regarding the new, smaller jump capable ships:
Since this is a major change from the previous 100ton minimum for
starships, and since the 2 cubic meter J-drive volume can be easily
mistaken for a typo for 2 tons (volume of J1 drive for a 100ton ship),
please add a clarification that the 2 cubic meters is _not_ a typo, and that
the minimum is now whatever you can make work.

Agreed.  That was my point.  Aerodynamic lift will NOT make up for a

I haven\'t tried TNE world generation yet, but in Trav & MegaTrav they
were Not unknown.  Also, my reading of TNE says that an airframe ship can
land on any planet regardless of atmosphere.

Here\'s where my Trav background does me a disservice.  You are quite
correct in saying that any sensibly designed ship would land on its tail.
It would be less costly structurally, and would require less artificial
gravity and inertial compensation than having your a "Down" side (perhaps
"Ventral" is a better word in these circumstances) being along the side
of the ship.  Unfortunately, 90% of all published Traveller, MegaTrav
(and the TNE illustrations) do precisely this.  The only sensible designs
I can think of off the top of my head are the Mercenary Cruiser, the
Azhanti High Lightning, and the Lab Ship (though that\'s a different matter)
However, since we are Stuck with the problem that our beloved Scoutship,
Free Trader, Far Trader, Fat Trader, Kinunir, etc. etc. etc. have this
"Ventral" surface and orientation, that is the problem we must address.
The example gave one of the worst offenders the Donosev class scout
surveyor.  Take a look at the deck plans.  No one thought for more than
2 seconds before setting pen to paper how she would be laid out.  The
deck SHOULD be perpendicular to the drive.  It SHOULD land on it\'s tail.
It doesn\'t.  (sigh)

Nearly all unstreamlined ships in Trav DO carry auxilluries.
But many of these ships still persist in attempting to land.
Also the example we\'re trying to discuss is how one Might land
if it had to.

Take a look at every rocket launched since the V-2.  All of them use
gymbaled thrust.  From the Sapwood to the Saturn V to the Space Shuttle.
Why?  Well, if you did have rockets pointing in every orientation you
might use, you would need to build them of comperable power to the main
engine (I\'m not referring to orientation thrusters here, but only main
engines)  If you needed to correct a thrust from your main engine, you
need something comparable.  That means you would need engines of comparable
size and weight to the fixed main engine.  So, when these things aren\'t
correcting thrust, they are just dead weight.  VERY inefficient.  Gymballing
your engines is a minor consideration by comparison.

Who says you keep the engine pointing in the same direction all the time?
You could (and probably would under the circumstances) land backward,
using the engines as breaking power.  (BTW, cosine of 1 degrees is only
0.998476952.  :-)

No, cosine of 6.3 degrees is only 0.99396.  :-) And as I said, you
need not be keeping your engine pointing in one direction all the
time allowing your vector to build up.  Landing backward would
probably be best.  Also, here I was trying to cover what I would consider
to be the absolute minimums needed for a gymballing engines.  If you
put less limit on the amount the engines may be traversed, your
"Forward" thrust will be substantially reduced.

(Sigh) actually the space capsules certainly were "airframe" structures.
"Streamlined" as defined by Traveller, means something who\'s structure
is capable of travelling at transsonic speeds.  "Airframe" structures
are ones which can withstand supersonic stresses.  I also recall reading
that the Apollo command module was actually designed to use it\'s heat
shield for lift in a very, very limited capacity.  It was supposed to
be able to "fly" though I think they were more describing a superior
control of plummeting.  :-)

> What does a ship have to look like to qualify as `unstreamlined\'?

Say, something like the Apollo Lunar Lander, Skylab,
Mir, Station Freedom, Salyut, The Donosev Scout ship, The Space:1999
Eagle, and virtually any design seen on the new Star Trek.  (There,
that ought to be enough examples!)

> For instance, is a pure sphere considered `streamlined\'?

Yes, (I haven\'t seen BL, but Trav & MegaTrav defined a sphere as
"streamlined", but not "airframe".

Not necessarily, 300kph is a low speed for re-entry no matter what
the pressure differences may do.  Say we double that for allowable
speeds in the upper atmosphere.  That\'s still Abominably low airspeed.
Say you\'re up in orbit.  You can bring yourself to near zero ground speed
using your engines, and then begin your descent through the atmosphere.
To then attempt to avoid building up a few hundred kph vector, and avoid
pockets of windshear, gusts and jet streams is on the difficult side.
A VNE (Velocity Never Exceed) of 300kph is pretty dang low, unless you\'re
flying a Cessna.  :-)

Most of the flights you describe do not require re-entry through the
winds of the upper atmosphere, and are not undertaken by planes with
a VNE of 300kph.

Without precise atmospheric data on wind speed and VNE of 300kph?  No
I am not kidding.  Stars are relatively easy to detect.  How does one
remotely detect wind speed?  Unless it\'s raining, your doppler weather
radar won\'t show you a thing.  Best way to go would be to have an
"airframe" ship out in front of you guiding you down to avoid turbulance
and gusts and giving you constant windspeed updates.  Without that
asisstance, I would say that if the starport is below TL 8 it would be
impossible or close to.

I was just sitting down to design a ship design aide for the new
rules. The first thing was to convert the "hull size table" to a
formula, because I have always disliked even sized hulls. One doesn\'t
see discrete sizes of automobiles, nor are we in Niven\'s universe with
discrete sized General Products hulls.

Below is the hull table I got from plugging values into the
correct formulae for a sphere. L was calculated from volume:
	vol = 4/3 pi r^3 (where L = 2*r)
and the material value from:
	surface = 4 pi r^2, and multiplied by 0.01 to get a 1cm volume.

Note that in the 30 Ton - 20,000 Ton  range the figures are quite
similar, but outside those values significant deviation occurs.

It _mentions_ accelleration tanks, and doesn\'t give any rules

For the hulls from 1 to 10 tons the text in the Tech Book gives a hint:
cite from page 2, Configurations (under the Hull siye table)
"Hulls of 10 tons or less in displacement are elongated six-sided blocks, and
 are assumed to be laid out in a utilitarian form."
This will result in some inaccuracies, if a sphere hull is assumed. But all in
all I think the only cause of the values in the tables is the cut down of
fractions in calculations.

For the larger hulls, you should take into consideration that the errors of
your formula are within 10% of the MV given in the table. The same is true for
the length. This shouldn\'t bother you, especially if you compare it to the
section of the text talking about Deck plans, which says:
"When comparing the final number of grid squares used on the deckplan to the
 rated tonnage of the vessel\'s design, allow 10-20% leeway."
Your calculations are more exact than those in the table, so keep them. A
deviation of 10% in the hull volume does not much damage. If I\'m correct in
my observation, that the calculated values for smaller hulls are smaller than
those in the table, and the values for larger hulls are greater, there should
be no problem, because with increasing displacement, the part of the volume
devoted to the hull shrinks significantly. And of corse the Hull Form and
Configuration Table give much more error margin than you could include
using your formula.

One more thing: There are no Asteroid hulls any more. I will use the
Megatraveller rules for this. Will there be any rules for hollowing out
asteroids?

I\'ve started running a Traveller campaign after 6 years of not playing
the game, and I\'ve just subscribed to this list (which seems
pretty cool!).

Anyway, I looked back through a few of the old bundles and couldn\'t
find the thread of this discussion, so I\'ll start it again (apologies to those
who have heard it before).

What\'s up with penetration values for small arms in the TNE rulebook?  If I\'m
reading the rules right, then a fusion rifle has better penetration at longer
ranges than at shorter ones?  If smaller penetration values, especially
fractional ones, are better than higher ones, shouldn\'t a plasma or fusion
rifle have a fractional value, rather than a large whole number value?
This doesn\'t really make sense to me, and my stopgap solution has been to
subtract armor value from penetration value, and the result is how many
dice of damage can get through.  The penetration system seems to
work fine for ships...

Am I missing the point, or are there massive typos in the weapons lists?

Also, if this has been beaten to death, point me to the bundles/dates,
and I\'ll look it over myself...

I\'ve been saving my comments on TNE itself until I calm down from the
fit of apoplexy that I had after I bought it.
The space combat system seemed to be the one bright spot except for its
treatment of missiles, so when _Brilliant_Lances_ came out, I decided to
give it a chance.

Overall, I\'d rate the game a near miss.  Much of what is new about BL
is what I had hoped the old Megatraveller system would be like instead
of the unsightly cross-breeding of High Guard and the MT vehicle rules
that it turned out to be.  Unfortunately, the new system has several
serious problems:

  * Detonation lasers as the only form of missile armament don\'t make sense
    at all, especially given the Imperial Rules of War.  They made sense in
    2300 because a ship under stutterwarp will appear sequentially in a
    finite number of relatively predictable locations; the best chance of
    achieving a hit is to fire at every place where the target might be.
    But if you don\'t need to do that, why pay for such a sophisticated and
    expensive warhead when something as simple as a cloud of shrapnel
    fragments will strike the target with enormous levels of kinetic energy
    when accelerated to speeds meaningful on the map?  Or if you\'re going
    to use a nuclear warhead to generate most of the energy, why waste most
    of it on a weapon as inefficient as a detonation laser when you can
    simply have the warhead itself strike the target?

    Furthermore, nobody (in the Imperium) outside the Imperial Navy should
    even have these gadgets; the Imperial Rules of War absolutely prohibit
    the use or even possession of nuclear weapons of any sort!  It is simply
    not believable for them to suddenly be not only available but universal.
    Furthermore, from a roleplaying standpoint, the missiles are a GM\'s
    worst nightmare: if 500 kt nuclear weapons are available for use in
    space, they are just as available for use against targets on the ground,
    and there is no believable way to keep the players from using them.
    (Cheap and universally available nuclear dampers might mitigate the
    problem, but in that case, there is no believable way to have the sorts
    of planetary bombardments that the background clearly indicates were
    common during the Rebellion.)  While BL is in many ways an advance
    over previous Traveller ship combat systems, this problem alone more
    than outweighs the advantages of the new system.

    To summarize: I can see a role for detonation lasers in the hands of
    the military (only), but they shouldn\'t be the only sort of missile, nor
    should they be the default.

    (And yes, I realize that the Imperial Rules of War are meaningless
    unless you\'re playing in the Imperium, but the offending missiles are
    present in scenarios supposedly set there and then.)

  * Detonation laser ranges are far too short.  If you don\'t have to put
    lots of beams in lots of places to try to hit a ship under stutterwarp,
    the remaining reason to use a nuclear warhead as a detonation laser
    rather than in an attempt to directly vaporize the target is so that
    you can detonate it outside the range of the target\'s active defenses.
    If a laser powered by the ship\'s power plant can hit targets ten hexes
    away with full penetration, a detonation laser powered by a nuclear
    explosion should be able to reach at least that far.  Even after allowing
    for simpler avionics in a missile guidance system than in a MFD, warheads
    should still be able to hit from outside nuclear damper range, at least
    at later tech levels.

  * While we\'re on the subject of missiles, command guidance is a poor choice
    for the default missile guidance system.  Fire control is represented as
    a hard problem; given that a range of five hexes produces a round-trip
    time delay of one second due to the speed of light, a missile in the same
    hex as the target has a much better idea of where to aim than an operator
    several hexes away can possibly have, even with relatively stupid data
    processing equipment.  Furthermore, manual command guidance restricts
    ties up the operator for the missile\'s entire flight time and reduces
    the rate of fire; ideally, you want as many missiles in flight as
    possible.

    This seems to be another idea lifted from Star Cruiser that doesn\'t really
    work, and didn\'t in Star Cruiser, either, where each hex of range yields
    a delay of four seconds.  Without FTL communication (which would almost
    completely ruin the Traveller universe), remote object control the way
    that the rules present it is completely impractical.  Furthermore, once
    you get past TL 8 or so, electronics technology should be sophisticated
    enough to obviate the need for launcher-guided missles altoghether,
    except perhaps in a few special cases where special tactical effects are
    desired.

  * The map scale is too large.  Turns are too long, and hexes are so large
    that gravity, which should be an important consideration, has almost no
    effect.  1000 s turns with 10 Mm hexes (or 20 min turns with 12000 km
    hexes) would have preserved the correct time scale, allowed hexes small
    enough to reflect the gravitational effects of nearby terrain features,
    and neatly gotten rid of half hexes of acceleration.

  * The implementation of vectored movement is very clunky.  There is no
    reason why a ship\'s heading needs to be rounded off to 30 degrees; any
    arbitrary vector on the hex map may be represented as the sum of at
    most two vectors along hex rows.  With a scale such that one G-turn
    changes one\'s heading vector by one hex, less record keeping would be
    required per ship to get movement exactly right than is needed with the
    present system.  (In other words, something like _Mayday_, with two sets
    of vector counters on the ship control sheet rather than the "future"
    counter on the board.)

  * Armor is too effective.  While it is possible to produce a "mission kill"
    on a heavily armored ship by destroying most of its systems on the
    surface as the game is written, non-meson weapons ought to be able to
    vaporize even the most heavily-armored ships, given a sufficiently heavy
    bombardment.  (Either that, or most of the space combat artwork published
    is wildly inaccurate.)  Furthermore, a ship can be made that heavily
    armored too easily.

  * Crew sizes are too large.  A type-S scout/courier should be capable of
    being permanently operated singlehandedly.  A _Gazelle_ should have a
    crew of exactly a dozen: four officers and eight enlisted men.  Free
    traders shouldn\'t require more than four permanent crew.  Changing facts
    like these breaks existing campaign materials (quite badly, in the case
    of my _Gazelle_-based campaign).

    It is unclear whether the crew sizes produced by the ship construction
    system are intended for pre- or post-virus settings; presumably, the
    (hideously unbelievable) "sneakernet" workaround to the virus would
    require larger crews and larger control modifiers; lowering the control
    modifier would bring down crew sizes a bit.  More usefully, providing
    some sort of system for positions to be combined (or reduced in the case
    of non-military vessels) and for maintenance duties to be relegated to
    base personnel could also bring crew sizes back in line.

  * Where have PA turrets and energy weapons gone?  I can live without pulse
    lasers, and I miss energy weapons only because they logically scale up
    from what tanks are normally armed with, but _Gazelle_ and _Kinunir_ both
    rely on accelerator turrets and barbettes for their main armament.  (BTW,
    whatever happened to _Kinunir_\'s black globe?  Or the grav APC?)

  * Maneuver drive endurance has gone from far too long (under MegaTraveller)
    to far too short.  One of the basic assumptions about how ships work has
    always been that maneuver drives provide constant thrust for many weeks,
    making them actually useful for in-system travel.  Changing this reduces
    the value of fast maneuver drives for in-system travel (trip time is a
    function of the number of G-turns that you burn, not your maneuver drive
    rating) and drastically alters the way that system defense units operate.

Finally, two gripes about the game components themselves:

  * The page layout is too busy; the graphics at the top and bottom detract
    rather than add, and the typeface is such that the eye slides right off.

  * The game components are physically too large.  Because the hex maps
    provided are so large (for the benefit of those who go in for miniatures),
    the available playing area in hexes is too small relative to ships\'
    weapon and sensor ranges.  Star Cruiser had the same problem, but
    provided ship counters small enough to be used on 25mm maps, allowing
    the problem to be fixed.  Unfortunately, the counters provided in BL
    are too large to be of any use on a map with hexes that are small enough.

IMHO GDW took far too much in the combat rules straight from T2K without
considering the implications for the Traveller universe. In the process they
downgraded most of the high-tech personal weaponry in comparison to existing
firearms. Plasma/Fusion rifles do significantly less damage than RAM grenades,
need ammunition which is heavier, and have a shorter range. Their only
advantage is that they are not vulnerable to point-defense systems, unlike RAM
grenades and tac missiles. Similarly, gauss rifles do less damage than would
be implied by their stats in Classic Traveller Book 4: Mercenary [the formula
in the T2K small arms book yields 4D damage, not 2D], as does the VRF gauss
gun [13D, not 6D]. This leads to the old Traveller picture of weapons
technology progression breaking down. New weapon technologies have to be
superior to the old systems in some way to be adopted, especially if they are
more expensive.

   Given the previous explanations of how Jump works, I\'d be
   inclined to say not - not necessarily because of technical
   limitations, but because of energy limitations.  Remember that
   most of the energy required for a jump is either to open the
   portal itself (according to some explanations) or to maintain a
   realspace field around the vessel (according to others).  If a
   portal stayed open, or could be held open, after a ship passed
   through, it would be possible to follow a ship through
   jump space, and hence jumping out of a system after an act of
   piracy or worse wouldn\'t allow the bad guys (or your PCs) to
   escape.

TML::> Do radio waves propogate through jumpspace? Now! If radio waves propogat
   ::>through jumpspace and you hold a stable portal open (even a minutely smal
   ::>one) then couldn\'t you have a FTL communications network?

   Yes, you could, but it wouldn\'t buy you anything over the XBoats
   in terms of speed.  Remember, all ships make jumps in a 150-hour
   period, plus or minus a small margin of error due to (as near as
   I can come up with an explanation) Heisenberg\'s Uncertainty
   Principle (well, it\'s a good buzzword for saying "reason or
   reasons unknown), regardless of power available, size of the
   ship, color of the Captain\'s socks, et cetera.  So opening a
   portal between Vland and Tauri and holding it open for
   communications would still end up causing each planet to hear
   news from the other a week after it happens.  So, it becomes
   more economical to simply batch up the news and the mail, dump
   it onto a ship on a regular basis, and have the ship bounce back
   and forth.

   But that does in fact assume that pure energy can propagate
   through Jump space.  Which in _my_ Traveller universe is
   impossible to test.  Why?  Because there is an interface between
   normal space and jump space, and energy is reflected from that
   interface.  So, we can\'t get a transmission _into_ jump space to
   determine whether it could propagate, and we can\'t put a
   transmitter into jump space because we would need a crewed ship
   to do it, and if we kill the jump field, we kill the crew, even
   if we could recover the ship, which risk nobody is willing to
   volunteer to take.  It\'s one of the theories behind misjumps
   that result in the ship never showing up...

   I always understood it as more a bubble than a tunnel.  Think of

   Star Trek.

My name is Glenn Myers and I am new on the Traveller Mailing List.

I work for a software company which only recently got an Internet address.
Anyone wishing to respond to me should SEND mail. Do not REPLY to my mail

I am a mechanical engineer who works in the finite element analysis field.
My experience is in structural, thermal, and electromagnetic analysis.
In a previous career I was with the Navy, where I worked in underwater
vehicle design. Needless to say, the starship design and combat rules are
what makes or breaks a game for me. But I think the campaign setting shapes
those rules in a manner which makes translation to another setting difficult
and perhaps senseless.

I have played Traveller for 10 years, and I do mean Traveller without any
metric prefixes. I recognized the enhanced starship design rules of MegaTraveller,
but I couldn\'t go with the rebellion setting. My campaign has been set in a
pocket of human settled space removed from the Imperium (Just about where the
Vanguard Reaches should be located). There is limited contact with the Spinward
Marches. Starships are small and uncommon. Survivability of designs is of primary
importance. The largest warships my players ever encountered was a 6000 ton
"cruiser". I used the High Guard rules with a smattering of Book 2 thrown
in where it made sense.

I generally agree with Palmer Davis concerning BL rules. I miss PA barbettes
and energy weapons. I dislike the bean counting approach to G-Turns. And if 12
different headings are to be used, I\'d rather just go back to the Book 2 vector
system and my protractor.

I don\'t want hull cracking detonation laser missles. The High Guard missles did
a nice job of scraping the turrets of the hull and leaving the useful wreck
behind. The existing missles are what happens when high stellar technology
goes berserk without a society to control it.

The long turns and long ranges are due to the fact that fusion bombs are being
used by combatants to knock each other out of space. In fact, most of my
disputes with the new rules were concern overkill of offensive weapons.

I dislike the large size of the map and game pieces. I feel that the cover (and
I use that term very loosely) of the rules book is going to tear every time I
open it. Physically, it looks like something Judges Guild published.

When I bought the rules I thought that what I didn\'t like I would be able to
fix when FF&S came out. I\'m afraid that many of the problems are side effects of
the Virus campaign setting. It makes no sense for me to continue my campaign,
but use the new rules. Still, TNE is the only supported Traveller rules system
available so I guess I\'ll have to adapt. I hate myself for that.

As a new TML subscriber, I\'ve got a wish list. If these topics have been covered,
please let me know what archive bundle covers it.

Are there any semi-official standards for machine readable file formats for detailed
systems. I want to represent orbits zones, binary and tertiary stars, and moons of
mainworlds. I keep thinking someone has tried to do this before. I\'ve been following
the format in Book 6:Scouts until something better comes along.

Similar to the above, are there any machine readable formats for starship stats?
What about character stats?

Also, I am in the process of learning C. As this is an exercise for my mind and not
work related, I would like to experiment on something Traveller related. Has anyone
written an extended system generation program or even a simple one I could use as a
springboard?

If anyone has alternate vector combat systems floating around which would be
compatable with High Guard designs send me email. I\'m always looking to improve
what I use.

Also, I\'m looking for copies of High Lightning and Mayday to buy, borrow, barter,
or trade.


TIA, Here\'s my card:

    'body' => '	I don\'t regularly get Challange but my partner got it the
other day as it was the 20th anniversary issue. Skimming through it
it looked more or less the same as always but reading it there was
definately a different tone.
	The first thing I hit was _Ask Commodore Bwana_. "As a fictitious [sic]
amalgamation of numerous letters and phone calls, I would like to know..."
My eyebrow raised, and I thought about sticking my fingers down my throat.
"This is a bit patronising". It goes on with "Pseudo-reality is heck, isn\'t it.
I should know." and procedes to outline the release dates of products for
TNE that fall below critical on my interest to cost ratio. We all know we can
add six months to the release date for most of them anyway.
	Maliszewski presents "Six Patrons" next in classical format. Reasonably
OK stuff, but as most of this could be plausibly set in modern Yugoslavia
it doesn\'t really fit my particular campaign.
	Ditto for Clayton Bush\'s "Toraago" adventure which makes too many
assumptions. Sort of "Your plane crashes outside of Sverdelosk/Yekatrinaburg..."
	The "Traveller News Service" really did make me puke. It was a full
page of complete gibberish. Sort of like typing an executable file. This
infuriated me. "How dare they!" So they killed the Imperium. Devoting a
*full page* in Challenge (and how much does a full page of advertisment in
that magazine cost?) to lampooning it was certainly onanastically dancing
on the grave.
	Lastly we have "Signal GK and the Virus" by Dave "Bwana" Nilsen
himself. For those not in the know there was a Miller-Kieth module
"Signal GK" in which the players deal with intelligent microchips that,
somewhat implausably, evolved on this planet. If all goes as planned
it all remains secret. "So", say the players, "the virus couldn\'t have
happened in my universe because no-one knew about these chips."
	Well "Darlin\' Dave" (as he labels himself in the next piece of
pure wank about a postal quiz) quashes all this with some sort of
convoluted (implausable) story involving different branches of Imperial
espionage working at cross purposes which was the "real" cause fo the
promulgation of the virus. Sounds rather like the FBI, CIA, DEA, NSC, ...
Give me a bucket!

	The conclusion I have gained from this whole sad episode is that
Dave Nilsen hates Mark Miller. When everyone at GDW lost interest in
Traveller, except faithful Mark, who got booted out, it looked like it
was landed in the lap of "Darlin\' Dave Bwana" and told "We know you never
liked Mark. Take his creation and rub his face in it." So he got out
his little model paints, all in trendiest black and labled Nihilistic,
Fatalistic, World-weary, and so forth, and set to work with grim delight.
	I came across this blurb in the back of an old Paranoia Press
supplement for Traveller:

		For the science-fiction fan who finishes a
		    novel only to wonder what happens next...
		For the fan who wishes they could be there,
		    if only for a few minutes...
		When just reading isn\'t enough...
		                   ... there is Traveller

*That* is my Traveller. I could not better put it. Endless posibilities
in a limitless world. The bright joy and wonder. Shining spaceships,
dubious traders, mysterious aliens.
	But then, that was then.
	"Star Wars" was still new. "Close Encounters" just out. "E.T." a
coming attraction. We tried to not remember Vietnam and ignore the
Cold War. The Millenium Falcon bravely fought as the Empire Stuck Back.
	What do we have now? Russia breaks into ever smaller and smaller
pieces, Yugoslavia crawls and eats itself like a maggot ridden course,
The New World Order/Era allows high-tech nations to kill five figures of people
while suffering only double digit casualties, Somalia remains at law level
zero dispite the Imperial Garrison.
	Why has the game I so much respected come to look like the world of
the politicans I respect so little? Is The Great American Guilt Complex over
the State of the World more than just a myth? Does this represent how it is
being internalised even as far as the games industry?
	I *don\'t* play Traveller for escapism. My world has its little
Lebanons, its Tianamen Squares. It also has its Eiffel Towers, its
Amsterdams, its Londons and its Stonehenges. It is easier to see in
Europe the whole variety of the tapestry of soceities rather than the
CNN-fed hackers in GDW who have forgotten how to paint in all but one
colour.

	The blurb is right. You used to be able to user Traveller to explore
beyond the endings of books, to live out films past the happy ending and
see what problems being married to a princess entail. What can be done with
the New World Era?
	Most Traveller players now were still on their first set of teeth when
Star Wars came out. Where do they look to now for their role models? Can you
now play The Sandman? The Terminator?

    'body' => 'As one of the Traveller players who still had his first set of teeth when
Star Wars came out (and being an American to boot), I feel the need to
throw my Cr0.02 into the fire.  I think Jo Jaquinta is somewhat right about
the Great American Guilt complex, but I\'m not convinced that the current
Traveller trends are really a side effect of it.  I, for one, have Zero
Interest in playing the Terminator in a game.  The movies were only mildly
entertaining as Science Fiction, being more of an excuse to use special
effects to show robots getting the tar beat out of \'em ("Takes a licking,
Keeps on Ticking").

Although Star Wars was probably the seminal Science Fiction event of my
formative years, I soon graduated to Asimov, Heinlein, and Tolkien.  In my
younger days, Foundation, Space Cadet, and Citizen of the Galaxy were
probably my favorite SF books, as well as anything with a Robot in it :).
Traveller used to be a game that reflected "hard" science fiction.
Unfortunately, the truth of the matter is that Hard SF is a Niche market.
I honestly believe that the current trend towards Combat-Heavy, grim, dark
RPGs is an expression of the same trend in Movies, TV, Comic books, and
all other sorts of media.  I mean, I have no interest in reading the
various X-comic books from Marvel because they\'re drivel.  However, they
sell well.  Somebody is buying them.  I think that GDW is simply hopping
on this bandwagon, hoping for higher profits from the \'More Blood, Less
Dialogue\' crowd while more or less ignoring the established customer base.
They do make some concessions to us (after all, we *can* still use the TNE
for a \'classic\' campaign), but we are, I suspect, a side concern...

I dunno, maybe I\'m not giving GDW enough credit.  Loren has mentioned that
\'many people\' are extremely overjoyed with the new setting and direction.
However, I don\'t think I\'ve seen or heard from *one person* who has this
opinion.  Either these gushing fans are (IMHO) incredibly clueless (ie,
have tastes in gaming universes in violent disagreement with my own, which
is, of course, the most informed POV in existence) or are from the
aforementioned \'More Blood, Less Dialogue\' crowd.

I suspect that, for the most part, the TML is made up of generally older,
\'More Mature\' fans, whose tastes in gaming do not, in general, reflect
those of the wider gaming audience (At least here in the US, the wider
gaming audience is primarily made up of males in their teens who
rabidly advocate their opinions on the high quality of AD&D as a
role-playing system or who spend time optimizing their Shadowrun
characters :/)

A few questions about 2300 ship design:

  * How much do tight-beam (remote object) communicators cost?  How much
    volume, mass, and surface area do they take up?  The pylon rules allude
    to the purchase and placement of communicators, but I can\'t find anything
    further about them.

  * Likewise, how much do workstations cost?  Accomodations?  Life support?
    There is an indirect cost in hull material and stutterwarp efficiency,
    but I can\'t believe that they\'re completely free beyond that.

  * Where does the power for weapons and active sensors come from?  Is there
    a power requirement from the main power plant?

     We should probably bear in mind that different viewpoints are
present here.  I bought a copy of Challenge 70 last week, and when I
got to the Traveller News Service page, I almost fell over laughing.
I thought it was hysterically funny.  I told the fun folk at GDW that
on GEnie, too.

     It seems to me that being unamused by the joke is understandable,
as senses of humor differ.  Being angry, however, strikes me as being
a bit extreme.

 >So they killed the Imperium.

     They killed *their* Imperium.  This is an important point.  In *my*
Traveller games, the rules system changed, but the background didn\'t.
The Rebellion never happened, the Virus isn\'t going to happen, and
technology will continue to develop and improve unabated by any
catastrophe.  In my universe, the average tech level of the Imperium
is right around 17.  You see, I *like* technology.  ;-)

     I haven\'t bought a copy of TNE yet.  I\'m waiting for the boxed
set.  I may or may not use the game system.  I won\'t, however, use the
background.  There will be no Virus in my game--I\'m the GM, and I can
do whatever I want.  ;-)

     That *is* the whole point, isn\'t it?  You can do anything you
want.  There\'s no reason to be constrained by the published materials
if you don\'t want to.  Why get angry over something that doesn\'t
affect you if you don\'t let it?

     Oh, on the contrary--all *too* plausible.  It happens all the
time.  I\'ve worked for various branches of the US government in the
past (civilian and military), and I\'ve seen it happen.  The right hand
department has no clue what the left hand department is doing, because
the *other* left hand department has fed it disinformation.

     Yes, it really *is* that byzantine on a day-to-day basis.

     Still is, if you want it to be.  The game is only as limited as
your imagination.  From what I\'ve seen and remember (there\'ve been a
couple of breaks, but I\'m one of the original members of the TML),
that\'s not very limited at all.  Just exercise your creativity neurons
a little and build a new world.

     It is a myth.  Let\'s be serious, shall we?  The average \'Murrican
doesn\'t waste one split microsecond of guilt over the state of the
world.  Frankly, we\'re a bunch of natural isolationists.  Sure,
there\'s a vocal (*very* vocal, unfortunately) minority that noises off
incessantly, but for the most part, we don\'t care.

     No, actually, it\'s general 1990s pessimism speaking.  The world
is a festering mass of fecal matter, and all we can expect in the
future is more of the same on the long slide downhill into chaos.
That\'s where Virus came from.

Does anyone know the real story of why Mark Miller left GDW?  Is there
anyone left at GDW who can spell correctly?  Did Mark take the editors
with him or were they killed in the crossfire?  Is Mark dug in at a
mysterious fortress waiting to be visited by the "Arrival Vengance?"
Is Dave Nilsen realy Lucan?  Does the dark area around Capital/Core
represent GDW\'s future?  Anyone interested in chipping in to reprint
Classic Traveller after the copyrights expire?  By that time we could
distribute it on Compact Disks!  Perhaps we could get someone to OEM
the Traveller Workstation!  It would have to be black with red
lettering, portable with a very high resolution color screen.  It
could be bundled with the Traveller CD and the Traveller\'s Referee
Toolkit.

The Traveller Workstation, the Traveller CD, and the Traveller\'s
Referee Toolkit wouldn\'t be hard to do with TODAY\'s available
hardware.  And the names are my ideas, so there!

This discussion is going a bit beyond the Pocket ML charter, so I\'ve added the
TML to the distribution, perhaps this thread can migrate.
  The idea of a drone `missle carrier\' is a great one.  Don\'t forget that the
Rampart fighter has USL docking rings for 4 missles.  We still need to know
the volume of missles though, since the addition of them will effect the
performace of the ship.
  Another idea I has was for a `ghost\' ship.  Small vessel, ECM, big folding
array passive sensors, lots of batteries.  Switch off the fusion drive just
before exiting jump space.  Use the vector you had coming out of jump and coast
for awhile.  Use the batteries for life support, the passive sensor array and
one computer.  Keep the speed down to 3Gs or less and you can do with out
the compensators.  Your ship is a cold hunk of ECM coated metal drifting in
system with big ears.
  Hopefully, with FF&S, a simular drone could be built as well.

   I agree with everything Jo Jaquinta wrote about C70 and TNE, yet again one
  of us is so annoyed by a GDW product that we have to post some more reasons
  why TNE is rubbish compared to Classic Traveller (I\'m tempted to go through
  the bundles and collect all of them together, to look at when I\'m tempted to
  buy a TNE product, but my account doesn\'t have that much memory:)).
   The TNS page almost ruined *my* carpet as well, it felt like a special
  delivery kick in the gonads to everyone who liked old Traveller, and the rest
  of the stuff wasn\'t much better. I like the point that most Rebellion or TNE
  scenarios are closer to CNN than SF. We are VERY out of touch with how GDW
  thinks.
   Anyway, they saved the best for last- in full colour, on the back page, the
  ad for BENDY ROBOT TOYS. I know Role-players are immature but that\'s going a
  bit far. It\'s either 1) Well done GDW for fooling the manufacturer into
                          thinking RPGers will be interested.
                       2) A sign of Challenges new market. (Can we send off for
                          Uncle Bwana badges and masks soon?)

   End of This Months Rant.

    And Now.......

   Another Reason The Virus Never Happened!!!!!!!

   I\'ve been waiting for someone to mention this since Survival Margin came
  out, but nobody brought it up....

   The \'AI\' transponders were approved for use in 1088, and were phased in
  over a 12 year period ( Survival Margin doesn\'t DEFINITELY say that it was
  started in 1088, leaving GDW a cop-out, but it implies it). That means the
  tamper-proof transponders were in place by 1100, which is not exactly true
  according to The Traveller Adventure, where the PCs get a programable Trans-
  ponder, and several other references to fake-transponders even later. Thus
  the Transponders never existed...
   OK, so the Virus didn\'t need the Transponders, but it certainly shows how
  little notice GDW paid to the old Traveller material, and that TNE is not
  the same timeline as Classic Traveller.
   (all this depends on there not being a TNS which gives a later date for the
  introduction....I\'ve been half right before....)

Come on, people!  Traveller (whatever the incarnation) is a role-playing
game.  Now, let\'s look at each of those words one at a time...

It\'s a game.  It\'s supposed to be fun.

It\'s a game.  The rules aren\'t laws, they\'re guidelines.  If you don\'t like a
guideline, call it optional, and don\'t opt for it.

It\'s a game.  It\'s not real.  It\'s fiction.  Very little in the game will
greatly change the real-world (except for a few pocket-books.)

Playing.  (go back to "It\'s supposed to be fun.")

Playing.  Don\'t take it _too_ seriously.

Playing.  "It\'s not who wins, it\'s _how_ you play."

Role.  (Here\'s where I really get on the soap-box.)  What\'s _your_ role in
making things better?  Don\'t like a rule?  Come up with an alternative, and
_share_ it.  Don\'t like the background?  Come up with an alternative, and
_share_ it.  Notice a typu/misprint?  Point it out.  Don\'t like the structure/
organization/printing/pricing of a product?  Tell GDW.   Hate the lack of
scenarios/adventures that you can relate to?  Write one.  ...But don\'t _just_
complain about how you don\'t like it (whatever "it" is,) direct your energy.
Make "it" better.  Use that imagination of yours, that you were probably trying
to spark in the first place by playing an RPG.

I\'ll shut-up now, \'cause I\'ve probably P.O.d half of the list at this point.
I apologize for being pedantic and repetative, but I just _had_ to get this
off of my chest.

  E.E. Doc Smith\'s books seem to be a primary inspiration..Sword

BTW, for those of you who are trying to integrate the Virus (which I

heard a lot of) into your campaigns, read the book "ME" by Thomas T.
Thomas.  No, everyone should read this book.  It\'s really cool,

induced pattern to the garbled feed.

Although I agree with the opinion that the destruction of the Imperium
by means of this virus was a bit lame, after recently reading through
survival margin, I\'m willing to give the new setting a chance.

The view that the New Era reflects the pessimism of the 90s is an
interesting point.  It seems that most of GDWs  games are going
down that dark road.. dark conspiracy, twilight and now even traveller.
Ah well.. maybe it\'s appropriate that the games people play reflect the
trends in society.

I\'m curious what the rationale is for everyone (e.g. Zhos, hivers, etc)
adopting the same transponder technology over such a relatively short
period of time.

My biggest pondering though is saved for the big black sphere around
core/capital.  Is there anything in Survival Margin or the New Era rules that
suggests what happened here?  Or when it happened?  Perhaps I\'ve missed
something.  Or more probably, it\'s a supplement down the road.

The sad thing is the loss of diversity.  The new background seems to offer
no alternative except a hard, grim, "More Blood, Less Dialogue" setting.
In the old background, if you wanted such an adventure, or even campaign,
there were places for it.  Efate seemed to be a paradise for such people -
no law, high tech (well, high enough, anyway - you can get PGMP\'s and
battle-dress) and loads of terrorist scum or Imperialist oppressors to
blow away, depending on whose side you chose to join.  Alternatively, you
could play on more civilised worlds, such as Regina.  The key thing was
that you had the choice.

You aren\'t going to use the background, and you might not use the rules.
What\'s the point of buying TNE, then? :-)

Better yet, let\'s have some Traveller software for pocket computers such
as the HP95 and the Psion Series 3.  Oh, I forgot, pocket computers are
TL 10, so they don\'t exist yet. :-)

I own naught but Megatraveller. From what I\'ve seen of CT and heard of TNE,
I would prefer the former over the latter. I didn\'t mind the Rebellion setting,
but I also considered "backdating" my campaign to pre-Rebellion times.

I know nothing of the internal politics at GDW. I didn\'t even know Mark was
gone. Furthermore, I can\'t comment on Challenge\'s quality because my nearest
store has stopped carrying it. If anyone would care to enlighten me, please
do.

I have to agree that 1)the trend toward nihilistic \'dark future/fantasy"
role-playing campaigns is rather disturbing, at least because it\'s becoming
so prevalent and 2)that if you don\'t like it, rewrite it. Use the game
mechanics, unless they are so intertwined into the background as to be
unworkable outside of it. (I don\'t see Cthulhu as being used for anything
other than Cthulhu or other Horror genres). Personally, I favor GURPS.
(BTW, where\'s the GURPS 2300 book?)

Shadowrun. No one seems to like this much. I wasn\'t too impressed and was
rather cynical of the background and game mechanics when I began playing
with my friends. Many faux pas as I learned what worked and what didn\'t.
I still refer to it as "Yahtzee, the role-playing game". Nonetheless, I
have "gotten into" it, at least insofar as buying the main rules and magic
supplement, and having accumulated about a meg and a half of material posted
by other on the net. I have examined each carefully for game balance and
background suitability. I have also corresponded with a number of people
who are equally as articulate, mature, and concerned with the role-playing
aspects of Shadowrun as those on this list. (I have also encountered the
power-gaming "munchkins"). I have to say that it\'s (\'it\' being the quality
of a game, rules, or background) lies in the players, not the writers; and
the quality of life lies in the people who live it, not the circumstances they
find themselves in.

I agree with the writers to TML that have said that GDW is part of a trend in
the entertainment industry (Movies, Books, TV, Games) towards darker, more
violent stuff.  I can\'t blame them, though, because it\'s probably what they
need to do to survive.

I\'m new to the list, so I don\'t know if there has been any discussion of
Space:1889.  This game had the hopeful themes of Edgar Rice Burroughs and
Victorian Sci-Fi.  I really like the game.  It was, by all accounts, a
financial disacter for GDW.  A couple of industry people I spoke with
thought that it had almost bankrupted GDW.

So, any company with a strong sense of survival will learn from
these lessons.  I can\'t think of a currently marketed game with
the Hi-Tech Wonderland theme... even Star Wars has that Dark Empire
thing now...  Even the comic book game, Champions, no has a Dark Champions
suppliment.

Hmmmm...  well, I guess I\'m the one person.  And this is hearsay, but the
people in my gaming group are pretty excited about it too.  Let\'s see, am I
"incredibly clueless"?  Can\'t rule it out :)  My campaign currently is sort
of an interactive screenplay for a Sci-Fi series -- Dialog, with occasional
violence.  I\'ll send more info about it to the list later.

As other people have said, you can use the rules to run whatever kind
of campaign you like.  Don\'t like the rules? Make your own.  The only
people this change REALLY, SERIOUSLY effects are people who want to
write Traveller Adventures for publication.  GDW\'s interest in pre-Rebellion
or alternative universes is probably pretty low, but who knows?  Has
anyone asked them?

But then again, I thought the TNS page in 70 was funny.

As to Jo\'s
 >*That* is my Traveller.  I could not better put it.  Endless

 >But then, that was then.

This sounds like a perfect description of Space:1889.  I\'m the only person
I know who bought any of the stuff for this game, and I bought it all.  I
had a fun campaign.  GDW almost went bankrupt.  (Anybody know where I
can get the unpublished Venus Sourcebook?)

They have to do what they have to do to survive.  As to the writers
who are unhappy about the Virus, just think of it as another Alien
life form.  Heck, in my campaign, one of the PCs is a Virus.

And about the bendy robot toys: I was pretty surprised myself, but other
signs in the issue (70) point to a real problem in 1) ad revenues or
2) publishible material.  The most glaring instance of this was the ad
that said "This could have been a Challenge ad", but there were others:
the "Starship Combat" ad, for instance.

What they really need is an "Absolut Traveller" Ad, designed much the
same way as Goldman of Chaos\'s "Traveller Workstation".

I have a posting for an alternate anti-grav technology, but this list
seems to be pretty serious...

I also finally worked out the penetration system.  Yuck!  I\'m working on
a fix...

	Good point, like anyone with a reprogrammable transponder
	is going to put one of the new fancy tamper-proof transponders
	onto their ship.  How many ships were out there
	during Real Traveller days?  I don\'t have my
	references handy; however, it shouldn\'t be too hard
	to make up some ship numbers based upon the chance
	of encountering various ship types insystem and at
	starports of various classes.  There were a huge
	number of ships, replacing their transponders even
	in a 12 year time is a daunting task.  Even managing
	to distribute that number of transponders would
	really be a pain.  Scott 2G Kellogg, any ideas?

	I built the slip cover for a CD case today.  Does

Brilliant Lances tells us that a standard starship missile masses(*) seven
tons.  It also tells us that you can store extra missiles in your starship\'s
cargo hold, and gives a rule for the time it takes to get the missile out of
the hold and into the missile launcher.  Brilliant Lances does *not* tell us
how much volume that missile takes up, either stored in the cargo hold or
installed on a grapple or docking ring.  The volume of the missile is rather
required in order to be able to design vehicles which carry missiles on
grapples or docking rings.  Presumably the missile will require slightly
more volume when carried in the hold, due to packaging materials, pallets
and similar considerations.

To put a bit of perspective on this question, I went looking through Peter
Alway\'s new book, _Rockets of the World_ (excellent, by the way: 198
dimensioned and color keyed drawings of 133 different rockets from 14
different countries, including the USSR\'s N-1 moon rocket, short histories
of each rocket, 179 photographs, again including the N-1.  ISBN 09627876-2-0)
for a sounding rocket that was about 7000kg.

I found one: the Viking Model 2, a sounding rocket designed by the Naval
Research Laboratory.  Its loaded weight was 6800kg, and it carried a 230kg
payload to an altitude of up to 252km.  The rocket was 45 inches in diameter,
and 505 inches long (including a 121 inch conic nose cone).

Subject: Project Pluto - nuclear powered missile
Date: Tue, 20 Oct 92 16:59:01 -0500
From: "Philip R. Moyer" <prm@ecn.purdue.edu>


Are you one of those people who think nobody would ever design a nuclear
propulsion system for use on Earth?  Read on....

SLAM - Supersonic Low Altitude Missile

The design called for a missle powered by a nuclear ramjet and was named
Project Pluto.  The project was started at Lawrence Livermore National
Labs on January 1, 1957.

Pluto was to be launched from ground by solid rocket boosters until
clear of friendly territory at at cruise speed, then the reactor was
turned on.  Flight plan was to cruise in circles over an ocean until
the "go" signal was received, then dive to low level and penetrate the
target country.  The reactor was unshielded, so it was highly radioactive.
It also spewed fission products out the back as it flew.

Planned speed was Mach 3.

Some project team members were:
        Ted Merkle, project leader
        Ethan Platt, engineer
        Blake Myers, head of LLNL\'s propulsion engineering
        Harry Reynolds, project physicst for Tory
        Jim Hadley, physicist
        William Moran, fuel element production manager
        Chuck Barnett, Tory test facility director

Pluto would use terrain comparison guidance (TERCOM) and carried 12 warheads
to strike multiple targets.  The vehicle would then fly patterns around the
target country, distributing radiocative debris, until the reactor was
completely eroded and the vehicle crashed.

Engineering challenges:
        - aerodynamic pressures five times that on the X-15
        - heat erosion of the reactor and control elements
        - ingestion of rain/snow/salt air at low altitudes/high speeds

Nicknamed the "Flying Crowbar" because of its low complexity and high
durability.

Chance-Vaught had the contract for the airframe and Marquardt Aircraft had
the contract for the ramjet (minus the reactor).  Ted Merkle was responsible
for the design of the 500 MW reactor.

Nuclear ramjet efficiencies increase with temperature, so Pluto\'s ramjet
was designed to operate at 2500 degrees Fahrenheit.  Metals at that time
could not reliably withstand those temperatures, so the fuel elements in
the reactor were made of ceramics.  They were fabricated by the Coor\'s
Ceramic Company of Golden, Colorado.  [While making cermaic liners for
vats in breweries, Adolf Coors thought perhaps he was in the wrong business,
so he built a brewery next to his cermaics factory.  You may have heard of
it.... :-]   The reactor\'s code name was Tory.

There were many unknowns in the Tory/Marquardt design, so they built two
prototypes and tested them at the 8 square mile Site 401 at Jackass Flat in
Nevada.  Site 401 had a 2 mile autonomous railroad, a remote controlled
disassembly and analysis building, and the test stands.  To build the concrete
walls of the disassembly building, they bought an aggregate mine.  The
compressed air support structure was built of 25 miles of oil well casing.
The compressed air system was charged with compressors borrowed from the
Navy\'s submarine facility in Groton, Connecticut.  A five minute full power
test would require about a ton of air a minute.

Two test runs were performed.  The first, Tory-IIA, was on May 14, 1961.  The
system ran for a few seconds, and much less than it\'s rated power, but it
did not explode (as there was some concern it might).

Tory-IIC was tested in May of 1964.  It was started twice.  The second start
ran for five minutes, produced 513 Megawatts, and had a thrust of 35,000 lbs.

Project cancelled on July 1, 1964.  ICBMS were cheaper and faster.

Epilogue:

Ted Merkle died of liver cancer after inventing the CAT scanner to watch the
progress of his disease.

Harry Reynolds now works at Rockwell on SDI.

Jim Hadley is still at LLNL, working on detecting nuclear tests/explosions
from orbit.

The Tory reactors are entombed in Nevada, where they will remain for several
thousand years.

This is probably a good place to mention the TML Pocket Empire discussion
group.  It was formed a little less than a year ago, and the group\'s
charter is to create a new, different, and interesting campaign setting
using GDW\'s "Official" universe, while still remaining true to as much
of the established "Classic" background material as possible.

When the group was formed, periodic updates to TML were promised; I\'m
afraid that I\'ve not been carrying through on that commitment.  However,
here is the current status of the project:

An outline for a campaign module has been written, and sent to Dave Nilsen
at GDW for comment.  Nearly all of the major worlds have been detailed, and
write-ups are available for them.  Adventure plotlines have been written,
UWP data has been prepared.  Starmaps, deckplans, and other miscellania
have been done.  Megabytes and Megabytes of conversations have passed
through our mailers.  Discussion continues; the largest area of remaining
work is to take the adventure plot outlines and flesh them out into
real, publishable adventures.

This is true more in the gaming industry that elsewhere, although I have
noticed a similar trend in fantasy and science-fiction books and films.
This may be due in part that the "dark" is easier to write: it takes a
J.R.R. Tolkien, Robert Heinlien, Arthur Clark, Edward E. Smith, a Larry
Niven, a Gene Roddenberry or George Lucas (I could name more, but my point
is that these names are only a small fraction of those writing in their
genres) to make a "bright", upbeat future where unreasonable problems have
solutions, where might does not always make right, and set an interesting
story in it.  On the other hand, there is considerable evidence that a
well-done "bright" story is even more compelling that a "dark" one: witness
the enduring popularity of these people\'s creations.  Roddenberry credited
Star Trek\'s enduring popularity to his vision of a "bright" future - things
may look dark right now, but Humanity *can*, *should*, and *will* prevail.

Classic Traveller shows signs of that kind of longevity; on the other hand,
I haven\'t heard anybody say how they miss MegaTraveller, and I suspect that
Traveller: The New Era hasn\'t got it either.  Sort of like the difference
between "Star Trek" and "Battlestar: Galactica" (if those of you younger
than 22 have no idea what "Battlestar: Galactica" was, then I rest my case).

> I\'m curious what the rationale is for everyone (e.g. Zhos, hivers, etc)

> period of time.

I believe the rationale is that the Imperium required prompt installation of
the "Deyo" transponders in order for foreign hulls to enter the Imperium.  Of
couse, in order to gain the benefits of the "Deyo" and to avoid duplication
of registry systems, all of them (including polities still formally at war
with the Imperium) converted to the "Deyo" system (which required importing
sealed boxes of unknown contents from their enemy, the Imperium) right away.
Yea, sure ... that\'s the ticket ... ;-)

A more reasonable approach might be to have dual registry systems: ships which
enter the Imperium have "Deyo" transponders installed, while most of the
ships which trade only inside their own polity don\'t.  Once the Virus got
loose, the transponders on the trade ships provided a convenient point of
entry.  Once familliar with alien computers, the Virus was able to take over
non-Deyo equipped ships with relative ease.

Of course, if you have trouble swallowing the Virus at all, you can always
play the New Era without it.  Simply up the date from 1201 to 2201, and state
that the wars and fragmentation of the Rebellion were sufficient to trigger
another Long Night, which the area of space around your campaign is
just recovering from (with the help of the Hivers).  Play the rest of
the "Official" universe relatively unmodified (adjusting dates, and deleting
references to the Virus as appropriate).  The largest changes will be to
remember to mention that the Regency has had a long succession of cloned
nobles running it ... ;-)

Seriously, though: the Virus isn\'t vital to a New Era, Reformation-Coalition
campaign.  With a truly minor amount of work, you can remove all references
to it and play the same game.  Some adventure scenarios will be invalidated
(for example, "Idol Dreams") but others could be played with minor changes.
Remember that some Imperial computer systems were nearly artifical
intelligences already - have them spend a millenia powered on with no
meaningful input and they\'ll be ready made artificial insanities (recall
Traveller Adventure 1 - The Kinunir).

Not exactly, but I can see where, with a little imagination and some minor
cutting and fitting, where the Reformation Colaition campaign could be
dropped right into the Classic Traveller universe; I haven\'t seen and haven\'t
heard discussed anything which the New Era makes possible that couldn\'t
have been done in the Classic Traveller universe simply by selecting a sector
off the edge of the "known space" map and setting the campaign there.

On the other hand, one of the reasons for preserving the Regency was as
a place to set many of the campaigns that aren\'t possible anywhere else
in the New Era.

Exactly.  As I said before, if you\'re happy with the little black books,
there a *lot* to be said for giving T:TNE a miss.

That\'s a good idea, but what *I* really want to see is Traveller: Pinball
Adventure in the Far Future (a Traveller pinball machine).  Put your

I can\'t comment on Challenge because I stopped buying it regularly about
two years ago, and haven\'t purchased an issue at all in about a year.  It
just doesn\'t seem useful or relevant.

You\'re not the first person I\'ve heard of that prefers GURPS.  I\'ve talked
to several different people at the local game store who have told me that
they are now playing "GURPS Traveller", using the GURPS Space rules and
the Classic Traveller background.  Many of these people left Traveller
rules when MegaTraveller came out, and all of them that I\'ve talked to
consider GURPS better than either the MegaTraveller system or GDW\'s
T2k2 "house rules".  I don\'t think their coming back for T:TNE.

I like Space: 1889 a lot too, although I didn\'t buy it when it came out.  You
can blame MegaTraveller for that.  I had recently purchased MegaTraveller and
after realizing the profound lack of quality control in that game, I wanted
nothing to do with Space: 1889 until at least the second edition, lest I be
stuck with *another* $30 unplayable monstrosity.

Of course, a second edition never came out, and I eventually picked up some
of the materials second-hand (and still check out whatever is left-over at
the game stores for new Space: 1889 stuff).

By the way, does Frank Chadwick have a fetish for titles with colons in
them?  Twilight: 2000, Traveller: 2300, Space: 1889, Traveller: The New
Era ... maybe he will change the company name to Game Designers: Workshop?

Actually, this is good news.  It would be very poor work indeed if it was

Now you know someone else who liked Space: 1889.  However, I never played a
campaign; I only know one other person who liked it (and like me, he *really*
liked it).  Everyone else went "Vern who?" and went back to Twilight: 2000.

Go ahead and post it!  I\'m still wondering if we\'ll get rules for Liftwood
and Ether Propellors in Fire, Fusion, and Steel (the T:TNE Technical
Architecture book).

I\'d say this is the biggest single problem with the T2k2 "House Rules" system
as presented in T:TNE.  It looks like a basic small arms combat system that
was added onto by several suppliments, and without a lot of forethought. Since
different weapons have listings that are similar in format, but should be
nterpreted in completely different ways, it is *very* confusing to the new
player or referee.

Now Deneb has a society with open psionic members, and the proles there just don\'t seemed to get shoved

I did some calculations using Brilliant Lances, and frankly, using the
listed Hull materials, TNE missiles cannot be that big.  For a 1 DTon
hull with Armor-3, Bonded SD weighs 6.6 tons.  This just the skin of
the missile, without innards!
The results of my fiddling are not yet in, since we don\'t know the
volume or mass of the nuke-to-laser warhead, but I\'m looking at a
missile between 0.2 and 0.4 DTons (2.8 to 5.6 m3).  Too small, you say?
The smaller end of my range is still the size of an old-fashioned
phone-booth, and even that is a bit large to be pushing around during
combat reloading.
 The other argument against a 1 DTon missile is the turret size and
shape.  A 3-ton missile can holds 2 missiles.  Assuming that they call
them "Cans" for a reason (ie. they are cylinders), the only way to
fill two-thirds of the can with a pair of smaller cylinders is to
make them _shorter_, not narrower.  Two missiles with half the diameter
of the can, sitting side-by-side, will only fill half the volume of
the can, not two-thirds.  Thus the missiles are smaller, with more
volume in the can dedicated to launch and guidance.
 Remember also that turret cans come complete with the gunner\'s
workstation.  If this workstation is the same as those elsewhere on the
ship, it takes up a ton all by itself.

I did one better than both of you, I even hoodwinked myself into buying
the *%&#* Space 1889 computer game. Actually I kinda of miss the pointy
ears folks on mars and the venusian lizard folk. Probably bought 90% of
the stuff for it. Always liked it a lot better than TW2000 and Trav 2300.
One of the redeeming qualities of Challange for me has been the fact that they
still publish adventures for Space 1889 in it. Actually, while my
signers of paycheck would never agree to it here, is there any interest
in a mailing list for us poor abandoned SP1889 fans and is there anybody
with the interest and the longer leash who would host it? This would
spare all those other members of TML who are still heaving into the
air-sickness bags over this conversation.

enough material already there for you to still run effective adventures without

What is everyone\'s problem with Megatraveller? I never actually ran a campaign,
but I was quite pleased with the well-developed background, streamlined
character generation, and other stuff. It was the first serious role-playing
game where I could keep all my character\'s vital stats on an indez card. The
only difficulty I encountered was space combat/encounters, when my PCs (we
started and adventure, never finished it) had to get past a system defense
boat and I was overwhelmed with innumerable sensor, piloting, and other tasks
with no clearly delienated relationship between them. Again, Mtrav and 2300AD
are the only two Traveller games I have (and I don\'t consider 2300AD a
traveller game, BTW).

I AM familiar with Twilight. I played the first edition extensively. I bought
2nd ed and played a bit. My biggest complaint is: too few skills at too low
levels. A PC pretty much HAS to be career army commando-type to have any
appreciable levels in more than 2 or 3 skills (exceptions, such as Doctor,
are rare). I also like characters in the late 20s-early 30s age range; Most
PCs need to be over 33 for decent skills; this is my only other complaint for
Megatraveller (but I understand it was true in CT).

I am aware that the Twilight GM screen changed the mechanics a little. I didn\'t
buy it; could someone summarize the changes?

Space:1889-I wanted this, but couldn\'t afford it until it was gone. I really
liked the idea, though, as with the above two game systems, the mechanics
seemed to be a little lacking.

Frank Chadwick: A very punctual man :)

As for GURPS: Since I bought High Tech, I have considered a GURPS Twilight
campaign.

Pentration: Is it the same as in Twilight? If so, maybe I CAN join that
discussion. . .

BTW, for vehicle design of ANY type: GURPS Vehicles. Any tech level, magical
engines or capabilities. . . the examples cover everything from chariots to
cars to Jets to Vectored Trust vehicles. . .no starships, though. . .But you
can build them.

 What sort of settings are you using?  What is the feel of your
campaign?  The TNE setting includes everything the Third Imperium
did except for "decadent imperial nobility" and "all-out war".  If you
want to play "all-out-war" then I\'m not sympathetic, because the
Rebellion and Fifth Frontier Wars produced more than enough material
between them.  "Decadent Nobility" can be run out of Traveller\'s
Digest #9 (the Capital issue) for ever and ever, and such campaigns
don\'t get much mileage from continued coverage either (the soaps are
a better source anyway).
 What\'s left?  Fragile Frontier. Merchants\' Business-As-Usual, "To
Boldly Go...", Political Bedfellows, "We Can Rebuild It", Soulless Hunters
of Soulless Pirates, Mercenary Tickets, Orbital Seige-and-Rescue...
 Several of these are actually easier to do than before, and none is
any more difficult to justify.

 Continue to gripe if you must, but at least gripe in a specific
fashion.  If you see a regrettable gap in the coverage, mention it
to the right people.  There are enough writers within shouting distance
of this list that SOMEONE may get inspired to fill the gap, even if
you cannot.

Phil gripes about the loss of Classic Traveller support:

Actually, as Steve said, there is more you can do about this than
bitch (although bitching certainly has it\'s advantages). You can
write your own stuff. Actually, we all can. I, personally, would
be willing to throw in my bit if others would do the same. This,
in fact, is precisely the reason I starting coming up with my
own setting years ago. I realized that Classic Traveller, like all
good things, wouldn\'t last forever (and even if it did, it didn\'t
take an Einstein to realize that it would never be perfectly
attuned to my personal weirdness).

My advice, for whatever it\'s worth, is that you accept and embrace
the fact that Classic Traveller will probably never again be commercially
supported, so you either need to support it yourself or come up
with your own setting and support that. But don\'t rely on GDW or
anybody else for material. Just grab from the hodgepodge of sources
we call SF-culture and make like a Borg on Steroids: "Assimilate...
assimilate... resistance is futile!" :-)

I wouldn\'t assume so. Think of other definitions of "can" and other words

   > what protection is provided by personal armour(?)
   This was an oversight.
   Basically, sealed, armored suits such as combat armor and
  battledress provide protection from most concussion. There are
  some limitations to this, clearly, as a large enough concussion
  force will squash protective armor (including tanks, as the
  Japanese discovered to their chagrin about 50 years ago). Writing
  a more rigorously defined rule on this is one our list of "Things
  To Do RSN."
   > Plasma/Fusion rifles do significantly less damage than RAM
   > grenades
   The way I read the rules, the worst plasma rifle does slightly
  more damage than a RAM HEAP grenade (when plasma splatter is
  taken into account), although it is worse at penetrating.
   > gauss rifles...the formula in the T2K small arms book yields
   > 4D damage, not 2D
   I rated the weapons for TNE. The ammo weight and performance
  numbers to feed into the rating formulae were taken from Mega,
  per my instructions, and those values were what I got. Mercenary
  gives different numbers, but we wanted a single source for the
  data, and Merc didn\'t have all the stuf they wanted to include.
  FF&S will allow the design of hotter TL 8 to 10 slug throwers and
  Gauss weapons (Merc gives a higher mass for the 4mm Gauss round).
  Frankly, I think the VRF GG as it stands is a Veg-o-matic for
  unprotected infantry due to the high ROF.

   The vast majority of the responses we have received are quite
  favorable (only a small number could be characterised as
  overjoyed, in about the same proportion as those who didn\'t care
  for what we did with the game). I am aware of only one person who
  has demanded his money back. Fewer people like the background
  than the new mechanics, but I believe that very few people play
  any RPG background unmodified, straight out of the books (never
  did, and I don\'t think they ever will). This was true of Classic
  Traveller, it was True of MegaTravller, and it is true of TNE.

   I agree with you to an extent. I don\'t know about the average
  age of the TML, but the more vocal TMLers seem to be long-time
  Traveller fanatics, like myself and Dave Nilsen. I never cared
  much for MegaTraveller, and lost enthusiasm for the game when it
  came out. I like the new system, and am working with Traveller
  products again because of it. (Some Classic Traveller Grognards
  have expressed delight at this last bit of news.)

   Depends on who you ask. Opinion is divided among the most
  active TML posters, ranging from an almost vitriolic hatred of
  TNE and everyone associated with it to acceptance of the new
  mechanics and background. I think the majority of TMLers (lurkers

  mechanics than like the new background.

   He is a member of the GDW board of directors, an officer of the

Well, this is pretty massively off topic, but here goes...

I\'ve been watching the CNN feed from the Soviet Army assault on the
Parliament building in Moscow, and the CNN correspondant keeps tagging
these small, tracked vehicles as APCs...There are also larger wheeled
vehicles which look an awful lot like ye olde standard TL 8 APC, so
I was wondering if the commentator is justing flubbing or is the
Soviet method of identifying armored vehicles that different from the
US\'s?  Or is that small thing really a standard APC that I just don\'t
know about?

From a Traveller point of view, this could impact my vehicle
designs :)

  My assumption is based on two things: The cross-section of a turret
can in the TNE rulebook, and the universally circular \'can-covers\'
shown in the starship pictures, both in TNE and BL.

  A cylindrical can makes sense from the modularity angle as well.  In
an ideal world, all ship designs have their can-interface hatches in
the same place relative to the direction of travel, and thus a boxy
can is designed with its workstation in a standard spot relative to
the corners of the can.
  Alas, neither this nor Traveller is a perfect world, and interface
hatches are aligned as required by the configuration of the ship. In
order to avoid having to build different boxy cans for each possibility,
the standard modular can is a cylinder.  Simply drop it into the socket
and spin it until the hatches line up.  Too simple.

  This said, I don\'t believe for a minute that all ships use the
modular cans and sockets.  Some weapon setups are going to require
too much customization to retain their modularity.  The Dragon SDB
(also called the Shukugan in BL) is the classic case.  Its hinge-out
missile barbettes are clearly not cylinders, and just as clearly are
an integral part of the design.  I don\'t consider it possible to
swap out those missile barbettes for something else without a fair
amount of shipyard work.
  Of course, I think the Dragon SDB should have an autoloader for its
missiles, but that\'s a different topic yet again.

  Based on the various ship pictures in TNE and BL, I\'m assuming that
turret sockets take up 9 square meters of hull area for the socket
cover and its mechanisms (part of the socket, not the can, BTW).  I
figure that _modular_ barbette sockets are the same depth at turret
sockets (6m) but a bit less than 4.5 meters across (around 4.25),
producing a surface area figure of around 20 square meters hull area
per modular barbette.  Any weapon mount is welcome to take more or less
than these numbers, but is assumed to be a hard-installed instead
of modular.  IMO, of course.

  As a final bit of info, reliable sources have placed missiles at
7 cubic meters.  On a good day, Traveller nukes will float, and also
happen to be the right size to fit side by side in a 3-meter-wide
turret can.

So that\'s the solution then. All of us on the TML band up together to write our
own Traveller New New Era. Then when we\'ve got a stonking new Traveller that
has no glitches, typos, inconsistencies, or complete cockups, we send our
agents into the net evangelising it. When the entire Traveller world adopts our
system, GDW will be forced to do the same. We can do it, we have the power [fx:
continues in long rant].

I agree with the chaps. Magic occurs when you play Classic Trav - you can feel
it, the game has soul Even, or especially, when you tinker with the rules a bit
- - my own change was to use the Striker combat system rather than the clunky
original one. MT and TNE are cold and lifeless. I had high hopes for TNE but
the typos and everything have killed it for me.

Come on, let\'s do it. And for heaven\'s sake let\'s keep the stats the same as CT
so we can all use our fave characters with our nice new classic system.

OK, just to add my CR0.02 to this discussion.

Doing research for an upcoming adventure, I found in and old Challenge and
article writted during the early MT days. The article is a collection of short
comments on Traveller by people who have been connected with the game.  I
believe these comments, along with my useless commentary will go far in
enlightening people as to why I agree with Jo in her opinions of TNE.

<Please note, all these quotes are from Challenge#29, \'A Decade of
Traveller\', written by He-Whose-Name-Will-Always-Be-Hailed, Marc Miller. My own
comments are the opinions of my pet Vargr.>

First, words of praise-

From Joe D. Fugate:
	"Marc Miller and the folks at GDW have done a fantastic job
	of building a science-fiction role-playing game with a
	consistency of background second to none in the industry.  And
	few (if any) science-fiction role-playing games can match the
	sheer \'open-endedness\' that Traveller offers."

Indeed, Traveller (weather Classic- or Mega- flavors) has an incredible open
endedness.  TNE also has open-endedness, but not in the same way.  The universe
of Traveller was awash of incredible differences.  TNEs universe is all the
same color-the gray of the wilds.

From Mike Jackson:
	"One of the exciting aspects of Traveller is its versitility.
	Unlike other games, Traveller does not restrict you to one
	type of activity (such as crawling underground and killing
	monsters); you can participate in merchant activities, piracy,
	mercenary operations, exploration, diplomacy, end even
	espionage!"

Dangeous worlds spark incredible adventures.  If characters don\'t take chances
(weather fiscal, physical, social, etc), the adventure pales. Whats the use of
doing something if its easy? Or safe?  The TNE universe removes the real
dangers of the Traveller universe and replaces them with fake dangers - unreal
dangers.
1) Combat is very safe (avg damage from 9mm round-3.5pts, avd hits avg
character can take in chest (STR+CON)*3=(6+6)*3=36pts --> 10 rounds of 9mm):
the average party will run out of ammo before they are killed.  (I calmly let
him shoot me in the gut while I return fire.)  Well, that rules out mercenary
ops, piracy, exploration, and espionage as deadly pursuits.  Why shouldnt a
character pull his weapon and fight his way out of a situation if he KNOWS he
wont be killed? Traveller had deadly combat- usually, one hit, you\'re down: two
or three, and your DEAD!  This kindof forces characters to talk their way out
of situation (ie more roleplay, more fun).  If I wanted indestructible
characters, I\'d play Champions.
2) Merchant activities are right out.  Noone to trade with, nothing to trade,
no money to buy anything.  If the wilds are as bad as they seem, what are you
going to buy?  Ag products? Most planets cant feed themselves.  Tech items?
Nope, the Virus took care of that. Oh, well.
3) Diplomacy? The Regency doesnt like that after their exploration ships got
zapped (how?).  The have the solution "coherent light and RAM grenades".  More
like gunbout diplomacy, but why not?  We cant be killed.

From Ed Edwards:
	"Consider two strong points which have led to the premier position
	of Traveller among SF-RPGs: First, Traveller has an extensive
	background.  In the past ten years the Imperium Campaign has
	produced the most extensive (in excess of 3000 unique pages
	of information) published background of any fictional universe.
	...Traveller is bigger than other RPGs because of the extensive
	background of the Imperium Campaign."

TNE trashes this background.  The Imperium is gone, its worlds charred
radioactive ashes, its people scattered to the elements and converted to
ignorant savages.  Dodnt Loren say one of the resons Traveller was dying out
was the complaints of people of the large amount of background material made it
difficult to get into the game?  Is detailed background a strength of weakness?
TNE doesnt care.  It trashes the background.  Who cares what happeded befor the
Virus Zap.  It doesnt affect us here.

Indeed, there is nothing in the TNE books that could not take place in a
backwater sector away from the Imperium and the chaos of the Rebellion.  (In
fact, in my campaign, thats what is happening).  So why did they trash the
Imperium?  Pety infighting? Ecenomic desires? Lack of originality (Gosh, we
cant think up all these new names for planets, lots just use the old ones.)?

Lastly, from Mr.Miller himself:
	"We\'ve put ten years into the developing the details of this
	universe of the future, and we can\'t, we won\'t, let it fade
	away.  At the same time, nothing lasts forever; everything
	changes.  And in the interest of a more intruging future,
	the Imperium itself has to change."

Indeed.  The Imperium is no more.  Our beloves Third Imperium is gone, replaced
with many small, bickering factions.  There was no reaseon to trash the sectors
we know and love.  The rebellion was bad enough, but it worked in a gaming
sense.  The Virus just doesnt cut it.

And, to placate the naysayers out there-

My Solutions:
	Weve been using a Traveller variant rules system for about two years
now similar to 2300 in feel and mechanics.  We use a rewritten MT expanded
character generation system (modified for new skills, etc).  The combat system
is similar to Friday Night Firefight (modified to a task-based system), and a
modified DGP task system.  All in all, a fairly detained system with realistic
results- especially in combat.  Vehicles are modified Striker, ships are
modified MT, with the system changed to be compatable with Striker (wait, a
starship 250MW laser is 5 tons, but in Striker its three times heaver? Hmmm).
The Universe is Traveller with Rebellion, but an alternate future.  I havent
worked out the details, but outlines as such:

1130- Final Lucan-Dulinor battle, final large battle of the Rebellion. Dulinor
killed.  Iliesh falls apart.
1131- Lucan assassinated, power stugle in Lucans Imperium.
1130-1150 Consolidation of faction gains and lands, infighting of factions,
Lucan, Dulinor, Strephon factions fall apart, Aslan,Vargr,Deneb fighting slows.
Rebellion over, individual planets succeed from factions, form numerous samll,
mostly independant goverments.  New Long Night starting.
1150-1170- DGPs Baddied from the Core(highly modified) solidifies
Domain/Aslan/Vargr/Zhodani non-agression, devistates parts of Consulate,Vargr
Extants, Aslani holdings.
1170-1190- Soloidification of independant governments in area of former
Imperium.  Solomoni Confederation/Domain of Deneb/Margrets faction/RVE only
effective interstellar governments in former Imperium territory.  Begin Second
Rule of Man.  Sylean Federation reformed, parts of Core, Fornast and Ley
sectors.
1190-1200 Current era.

Why keep such large govts in existance?  Th protect the areas of the Former
Imperium from being overrun by the aliens.  Domain/RVE vs the Vargr,
Domain/Solomani vs Aslani, Solomoni/Margret vs Hivers, Sylean vs K\'kree.
These areas had good reasons to keep efective interstellar government- fear of
alien invasion.
Eventually, I will flesh these ideas out, since they make more sence to me than
the Virus thing.  This Long Night wont be as long or as dark.

By the way, Where is Citizen Miller?  What happened to him?  Why didne he have
anythong to do with TNE?

An APC is a small, lightly armored vehicle designed to transport troops across
a battlefield. It can be tracked or wheeled, turreted or non-turreted, and
have armament ranging from a machinegun to 25mm autocannon and anti-tank
missile.

Examples:
	M113			Box with treads. Many variants.
				carries (I believe) 11-13 soldiers.
	M2 Bradley		sloped armor, turret, 25mm gun, TOW missile
				launcher, carries (I believe) 7 soldiers.
				Tracked, amphibious.
	BTR series (-60, -70)	Soviet wheeled APC.
	BMP series 		Soviet tracked APC. Central Dorsal turret with
				30mm gun and anti-tank launcher.

Common factors:
	Armor: compared to tanks these things are eggshells. They\'ll resist
most small-calibre shots and fragments, but direct hits from HE or, worse yet,
HEAT rounds will kill them. AT missiles are overkill, whereas they are required
for killing the heavier tanks.

	Mission: They carry people, usually about a squad or so, in addition
to their crew. Many have variants that use this extra space for ammunition,
additional weapons systems, and other toys.

I haven\'t seen the CNN show, so I don\'t know exactly what vehicles were
present.  But the ex-Soviet army has at least two types of APC; the BTR
and the BMP (probably with numbers after those letters).  The BTR is the
wheeled type, and carries a heavy machine-gun in its little turret.  The
BMP is the tracked one, with a larger turret, an auto-cannon, and in some
cases anti-tank missiles.

I never did get the TML digest that my latest message was in so I did not even
know if it had been sent out. I still disagree, though. A VRF GG weighs 2
tonnes and costs 200,000 Cr(from memory, could be wrong). As it stands in TNE,
a TL7 7mm gatling is slightly less effective, but is much smaller, lighter and
cheaper. Can you see the advertising - "Roll up, roll up and buy our new,
improved 2 tonne gatling gun" :-)

High-tech weaponry has to be more effective than low tech, if only to justify
the (almost invariably) massive cost increases. I already have variant stats
worked out, but this produces the problem of diverging from the official rules,
which makes new GDW products less useful, as others have already commented on.

the BTR with a large rectangular box instead of the gun turret is the

Sorry.  For those who missed it. :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)

On a serious note, why are there so many typos and stuff that looks
like no one ever read over the rules after they were typed in?  Or is
it just that I\'m noticing the typos more now.

Thanks for the update on Marc Miller.

Assuming that the trademarks are still active. :-)  Perhaps I and
everyone else should stop talking about Traveller on the TML so that
Traveller falls into disuse?  :-)

Suggestion with 1/2 :-):  Offer a complete set of Classic Traveller
books on CD rom.  Take prepayments with the condition that the CD will
be printed if and only if a certain number of orders come in.  A week
or two with an OCR scanner an you\'d be all set.  You could even break
it down into a number of CDs, Combined Rules, Adventures, Supplements,
Journals, etc.

I\'ve already printed up a CD case cover for Disc 1: Combined
Rules.  Don\'t worry, I don\'t intend to sell it.  I had not
bought a new Traveller product in quite some time and had to do
something about it.  :-)

  Re: Matt Goldman on the Traveller Workstation
      Ah, we can but dream (at the moment). I love the idea, but wouldn\'t the
  whole of GDWs, FASAs and DGPs published material fit on one CD ROM, especial-
  ly if illos were cut back? You could probably fit HIWGs stuff as well, I\'ve
  got a lot of it and it doesn\'t take up much room on the hard drive (since
  it\'s all ASCII).
      Another thing- I thought copyright continued for a certain period of
  time from the *death of the author*. Now that would be a dilemma.

      And since Traveller is a Trademark, how about "Travelogue- Adventure in
  the Not Quite As Far Future"

There are some of us out here that whole heartedly support your idea.  I
have been a long time advocate of changing the rules if they do not suit
you.  That is one of the great things about role playing games.  I have
read posts from people that say how bad they think TNE is, and that they
have used the rules and thrown out the background.  That is perfectly O.K.
I happen to like the background of TNE and will use it as I used
MegaTraveller.  Sometimes people need a change, and although I miss Classic
Traveller, I welcome the New Era with open arms.

The little guys are BMDs.  They are designed to be air-droppable and
transportable and are used by the Soviet airborne forces as a squad or
fire team carrier.  The closest equivalent I can think of is the Brit
Bren Carrier from WWII.  They offer more protection and better armor
than a Jeep and I don\'t think calling them an APC is too far off the
mark.  If anyone is interested I can go dig out the specs from my
books at home.

The bigger wheeled vehicles are BTRs, either -50 or -60.  They are
more like a Tech *7* APC, having been replaced by the more capable and
upgunned BMP in the middle 80s.

Its according to who you ask.  An APC can be no more than a combat-taxi that
takes troops into the battle area and releases them, up to a full Armoured
Fighting Vehicle (AFV) that allows troops to effectively fire out of the
vehicle and utilize the vehicles armaments(usually autocannons and/or ATGMs).
Probably, the commentator knows of only three types of army vehicles, "jeeps",
"tanks", and "APC\'s".  Most call the Bradley and APC even though is it an AFV.

I\'m more than willing to help on the Traveller:The REAL New Era background.
Although I believe the CT rules can stand some modification, mostly they were
more than useable( as were the MT rules).  The magic came from the Universe.

Why not?  Was it a greater abomination of Traveller than your TNE?;-)  I will
admit my own feelings here.  If the name on the cover of the TNE book had been
anything else but Traveller, I would have though that it was a fairly decent
game.  Good character rules, good combat rules (not dangerous enough, but
fixable, although given a choice between the Grav tank in TNE and the M1 in
T:2K, I\'ll take the M1- WOW! MY high tech tank stinks!), OK setting.
The complaint: It trashed all that was noble about Traveller.

Sigh.  Too true.  So, what _is_ selling well these days?  Also, is there
any chance that you could recap the history behind the Classic->MT shift
sometime?  I\'m sure a lot of us would be interested.

I bought into Traveller in 1977, approximately the same day that the
box hit my local hobby shop. (-:  That was half of my lifetime back.
Frightening, eh?

Just as a matter of idle curiosity, what sort of terms would you license use
of the Traveller tm under now?  Suppose, for purposes of this example, that
I wanted to publish a collection of mini-adventures in a close approximation
of the old format (64 page, digest sized, etc.)...

Which I haven\'t.  Sorry if you suffered any confusion over this.

I agree with the people who have said:
1) hi tech weapons should, in general, do more damage, than lower tech ones,
and
2) that combat is too survivable now.

One of the characters in my campaign could take a fusion rifle
hit in the chest, take full damage (84 pts) and still be alive,
and still be at the slight wound level.  Sure, he\'s tough, but
nobody should be THAT tough.  The rules do seem to be geared towards
character survival, something that wasn\'t present in CT, esp. since
you could die during character generation :-)

However, I\'ve killed many Champions characters.  It\'s actually
pretty easy....

I\'m not sure I understand the people complaining about TNE not
having a soul...  guess I\'m to insensitive :-)

CT was one of my favorite games.  MT was too complicated, esp. the
ship construction.  In terms of skill mechanics, TNE tops the list
of any game that\'s available, because the skill system is easy and
quick, while having most of the detail of the MT system with only
one roll.

I also think people are really being odd about the setting.  Why
can\'t you have merchant activities?  I would think merchants would
be in high demand.  Not all planets were blasted back to the
stone age (look at the Virus Effect table, or whatever it\'s called,
that shows you how to reduce the stats of planets).

Many planets are going to be in the 7-9 TL range, and they\'re going
to WANT to pick up interstellar trade again with their neighbors,
for all the same reasons they did before the collapse.

And as to diplomacy, what could be a greater Diplomatic task than
rebuilding the Imperium, forging the Empire one planet at a time?

I also think everything that has evolved in the Traveller universe
has done so using the historical background that was in place with
Classic Traveller.  The Civil War following the Frontier War was
an established pattern.  The Imperium had already been through one
Long Night, here it is happening again, but from different causes.
History repeats itself in real life, why shouldn\'t a game so strongly
grounded in its own history do so as well?  Empires rise and fall.
TNE COULD BE about the rise of the Fourth Imperium.  This is the main
theme of my campaign.

I don\'t see the large amount of background info going away: it just
has evolved.

Vanya  says:
> So why did they trash the
>Imperium?  Pety infighting? Ecenomic desires? Lack of originality (Gosh, we
>cant think up all these new names for planets, lots just use the old ones.)

I think the Virus is pretty original.  I also fail to see how a major
evolution in the setting as lack of originality.  Ummmm... Petty infighting
between who about what?

I am curious as to what happened to Marc Miller.  I didn\'t think anything
had, until Loren\'s reply.  What happend to the folks who "made" MegaTraveller,
the guys and gals at Digest Publications Group.  Are they No More?  I can\'t
find their products on the shelves, but heck, I\'m in Boston :-(

Also, Vanya\'s background is cool too, but I prefer the TNE one because, yes,
I like the Virus.

I still don\'t get what you guys are all upset about: if you want to
do Classic Traveller, set it in Deneb or the Hive Federation.  The
setting hasn\'t been trashed, it\'s evolved.

I just remembered another source or two for Sword World\'s Information:

One of the first Double Adventures (#2 I think) was "Across the Bright
Face/Mission on Mithril".  Mithril was at the time a Sword Worlds Planet.

The game "Fifth Frontier War" had information on the military units of all
of the combatants.

The Boxed adventure "Tarsus" had a detailed section on a group of Sword
World military refugees that co-habitated Tarsus.  There may even be
passing reference to Sword World activities in the second boxed adventure
"BeltStrike".  I\'m sure BeltStrike mentions Darrian activities.  Both of
the above adventures were set in District 268.

There are numerious mentions in the Traveller News Service of the early JTAS\'s.

Hope that this helps.

Chuck

P.S.    I own originals of all the above material...

 TML:

	My name is Glenn Myers and I am new on the Traveller Mailing
	List. [Please don\'t exceed 78 columns in the future, Glenn, and
	mail your postings to traveller@engrg.uwo.ca, not
	traveller-request@engrg.uwo.ca -- thanks! James]

	I am a mechanical engineer who works in the finite element
	analysis field. My experience is in structural, thermal, and
	electromagnetic analysis. In a previous career I was with the
	Navy, where I worked in underwater vehicle design. Needless to
	say, the starship design and combat rules are what makes or
	breaks a game for me. But I think the campaign setting shapes
	those rules in a manner which makes translation to another
	setting difficult and perhaps senseless.

	I have played Traveller for 10 years, and I do mean Traveller
	without any metric prefixes. I recognized the enhanced starship
	design rules of MegaTraveller, but I couldn\'t go with the
	rebellion setting. My campaign has been set in a pocket of human
	settled space removed from the Imperium (Just about where the
	Vanguard Reaches should be located). There is limited contact
	with the Spinward Marches. Starships are small and uncommon.
	Survivability of designs is of primary importance. The largest
	warships my players ever encountered was a 6000 ton "cruiser". I
	used the High Guard rules with a smattering of Book 2 thrown in
	where it made sense.

	I generally agree with Palmer Davis concerning BL rules. I miss
	PA barbettes and energy weapons. I dislike the bean counting
	approach to G-Turns. And if 12 headings are to be used, I\'d
	rather just go back to the Book 2 vector system and my
	protractor.

 	I don\'t want hull cracking detonation laser missles. The High
 	Guard missles did a nice job of scraping the turrets of the hull
 	and leaving the useful wreck behind. The existing missles are
 	what happens when high stellar technology goes berserk without a
 	society to control it.

	The long turns and long ranges are due to the fact that fusion
	bombs are being used by combatants to knock each other out of
	space. In fact, most of my disputes with the new rules were
	spawned by the overkill of offensive weapons.

 	I dislike the large size of the map and game pieces. I feel that
 	the cover (and I use that term very loosely) of the rules book
 	is going to tear every time I open it. Physically, it looks like
 	something Judges Guild published.

	When I bought the rules I thought that what I didn\'t like I
	would be able to fix when FF&S came out. I\'m afraid that many of
	the problems are side effects of the Virus campaign setting. It
	makes no sense for me to continue my campaign, but use the new
	rules.

	If anyone has alternate vector combat systems floating around
	which would be compatable with High Guard designs send me email.
	I\'m always looking to improve what I use. Also, I\'m looking for
	copies of High Lightning and Mayday to buy, barter or trade.

	I think I\'d give anything to see a rack of those little black
	books in a games store again.

Subj:   Buttered bread, cats, and spaceships!  (This is hillarious!)

(This question was posed to the Usenet Oracle:)

 If you drop a buttered piece of bread, it will fall on the
 floor butter-side down.  If a cat is dropped from a window
 or other high and towering place, it will land on its feet.

 But what if you attach a buttered piece of bread, butter-side
 up to a cat\'s back and toss them both out the window?
 Will the cat land on its feet?  Or will the butter splat on
 the ground?

And in response, thus spake the Oracle:

 Even if you are too lazy to do the experiment yourself you should be
 able to deduce the obvious result.  The laws of butterology demand
 that the butter must hit the ground, and the equally strict laws of
 feline aerodynamics demand that the cat can not smash its furry back.
 If the combined construct were to land, nature would have no way to
 resolve this paradox.  Therefore it simply does not fall.

 That\'s right you clever mortal (well, as clever as a mortal can get),
 you have discovered the secret of antigravity!  A buttered cat will,
 when released, quickly move to a height where the forces of
 cat-twisting and butter repulsion are in equilibrium.  This equilibrium
 point can be modified by scraping off some of the butter, providing
 lift, or removing some of the cat\'s limbs, allowing descent.

 Most of the civilized species of the Universe already use this
 principle to drive their ships while within a planetary system.  The
 loud humming heard by most sighters of UFOs is, in fact, the purring of
 several hundred tabbies.

 The one obvious danger is, of course, if the cats manage to eat the
 bread off their backs they will instantly plummet.  Of course the cats
 will land on their feet, but this usually doesn\'t do them much good,
 since right after they make their graceful landing several tons of
 red-hot starship and pissed-off aliens crash on top of them.

To some extent I suppose my response here is redundant with Brent\'s, which
is that the background is something the GMs devise.  Even if you use the
background provided by a company the game material is still subject to
individual GMs interpretation and the needs of their game.  Frankly I have
always found the TNS to be a bit of a laugh since almost nothing published
in it should ever affect a game.  So, if you don\'t like TNE background
don\'t use it.  If you don\'t like a TNS story rewrite it.  Yes the GM will
have to be a little bit more creative about where things are going, but
that should be part of his job.

Frankly the people at GDW don\'t, won\'t and shouldn\'t care how you
use/modify their products.  To them the background is an example of how to
use their system, not the system.  Because of this "the example" will vary
widely to match their current views of the product line.  If they care
about anything it is the system and how it works.  Still they want you to
feel comfortable about using that system and if that means modifying rules
to suit your needs, so what?  Do you think that we would have anything but
Classic Traveller if they didn\'t tinker with the rules continually?  You
think pinning them down on Traveller is bad, try to pin them down on a
Command Decision point.  Anyhow this year was the first time I have ever
run a Traveller game that even claimed to be inside their background (and
I started playing the system before it was published) and that was only
because I was running a game at their booth at Gen-Con to support TNE.

Actually I like the TNE background better than either classic Traveller or
Mega-Traveller.  I don\'t particularly like how they got there, but this is
the first background that seems to feel like H. Beam Piper, Heinlein or
Starwars.  The universe is not wide open and movement requires great
will.  It is a people based background not "tech".  To me it is the
characters that count and games where all the problems are solved by
technology are not as exciting as those that require human innovation.
It is a background where characters can actually influence the course of
history.  It may be darker than the old Imperium, but it doesn\'t have to
be any bloodier (that is up to the GM).  I like rickety old space hulks
plodding around from planet to planet trying to make a living.  Captains
finding innovative ways to get that part to keep the engine going.  I like
being able to explore planets as a player (something lacking in the
previous versions) and being able to do anything I want with planets as a
GM.  Of course if I were to run a game I would probably let several
hundred years or even several thousand pass.  This would really allow me
to experiment with planetary societies (sigh, once an Anthropologist
always...).  My own classic Traveller campaign was not set in the Imperium
because I thought the Imperium was too "homo sapien".  I wanted a very
much more Starwars type universe (or should I say Star Trek like since the
show was probably a bigger influence than the movies which were just being
made, but I knew I wanted lots of aliens in the game).  I also wanted to
be able to create cultures on various planets for the characters to
explore, something you just couldn\'t do in the Imperium with its big
monolithic society.

To set the record straight, Mark Miller was not booted out (he was an owner
after all, not an employee), from everything I have heard his leaving was
his idea.  As far as I know he did not leave in anger either, in fact he
stopped by the GDW booth at Gen-Con this year and it was obvious that
everyone was still friends.  (He went with the company to Gen-Con the year
before as part of the company).  I actually get the impression that he
wanted something more than being a game designer for the rest of his
life.  Certainly a person with Mark\'s reputation could get another a job
inside the hobby if he wanted one.  Currently I\'ve been told he is selling
insurance.  As far as spelling and mistakes go, everyone seems to be
forgetting that Megatraveller was done under Mark\'s direction.  Actually
the person who seemed to have the best control over errors and spelling
was actually Rich Banner (who ran the back end of game production
[i.e. art and text] at the time Classic Traveller was put out).  This is
not to say that Rich had a particular talent at text processing, but that
his gaming experience made him a better proof reader for game related
errors than the art-professional/non-gamers who replaced him.

	I would love to see an 1889 mailing list, or at least an occasional
email correspondence club.  Glad to hear that others are interested as well --
let\'s hope GDW gets the word.  Of course, they need to see this interest
reflected in sales.  If everyone who thought it might be interesting had gone
out and bought the game when it was released, there might be a second edition
by now.
	And the Traveller fans shouldn\'t get too upset over discussions of
1889; just think of it as a specialized subset of Traveller which only takes
place on TL4 worlds.

unfortunately this editor doesn\'t allow me to include the mail, so forgive

	According to Loren the folks in charge of DGP were having problems
outside of the company, and this had delayed the release of their product.
I have not seen any indication on when this will come out (the fact that
I have only started seeing issue 4 of the MegaTraveller\'s Journal could
have something to do with this).

	Another point, I am overjoyed that TML is starting to get postings

Without actually listing all the titles, GDW produced:

Books 0-8
Supplements 1-13
Adventures 1-13
Double Adventures 1-6
Aliens 1-8
JTAS 1-24

Large format booklets: Atlas of the Imperium
                       The Spinward Marches Campaign
                       Alien Realms

Books: The Traveller Book (rules, hard and soft cover versions)
       The Traveller Adventure

Boxed Sets: Tarsus
            Belt Strike

Games: Mayday
       Snapshot
       Azhanti High Lightning
       Invasion Earth
       Fifth Frontier War

Miniatures Rules: Striker

A few other exotic bits from GDW exist, such as the "Map of the Imperium"
they used to give away at cons, an Aliens handout, and a free booklet called
"Introduction to Traveller", plus various maps of the Spinward Marches.

The rules exist in the following main versions:

     Traveller <three booklets in box>
     Deluxe Traveller <five booklets, including "The Imperial Fringe" adventure
                       only found in this set>
     Starter Traveller <Two 8 1/2 by 11 booklets plus versions of the double
                        adventures "Shadows" and "Mission on Mithril">
     The Traveller Book

Various foreign language versions exist as well.  I\'m very favorably impressed
with the choice of materials in the German edition.

Supplements by other companies (but not their magazines) can be found listed
in "Heroic Worlds" by Lawrence Schick, still in print as far as I know.  The
publisher is Prometheus Press, and I got mine on special order from the local
Walden Books, so it can\'t be too hard to find.

All this discussion of Classic Traveller caused me to restack my collection
a couple of days ago, so it\'s all fresh in my mind at the moment. (-:

     I agree with you, Tom, but only partially.  From my point of view,
the main problem with an SF game is that it can/should be BIG.  As a result,
my imagination gets stretched a lot more than it would if I was playing a
fantasy game of typical scope.  So, the more stuff that the publisher puts
out that I can reasonably use, the more creative time I can put into
other aspects of the game, giving a more textured background overall.

     I disagree, for pretty much the same reasons that I mention above.
I don\'t think that I\'m the only person incorporating published material
into my game as a timesaver, and therefore I feel that GDW has a very
pertinent interest in keeping me buying their products.  So, they should
be interested in what use I am making of their products.

     I\'m speaking fairly generally, of course--In specific, TNE appears to
be a sufficiently radical shift from previous material that GDW must be
expecting to lose some members of the hardcore fandom of the previous
editions, a category that will probably include me.  I\'m waiting for FF&S
to appear before making a final decision.  Beyond that point TNE products
will only be of interest to me if I can fit them back into the Classic/MT
framework.  (Like the miniatures...status, anyone?)

     GDW is free to make wahtever business decisions they feel they need to.
I am free to spend my money on whatever I like. As long as both sides realize
that other side is making a rational economic decision, everyone can remain
calm. (-:

Sorry about the repeat post yesterday. Apparently a message I thought was
dead was resurrected by James. I appreciate the effort.

So, having given my first impressions (complaints) of BL, I felt it was
appropriate to comment further now that I\'ve used it more.


 First, some things I like:

The new BL ship design rules seem much better than MT. So much better that I
may finally replace my High Guard system. The design process seems much more
sensible. Still, I wish GDW had included a sample design to help bring us up
to speed. I\'ve already set up a spreadsheet for designing ships and I wish I
had a benchmark to verify it.

My great hope is that FF&S will permit us to extend the rules to cover items
which were not included in BL. These would include energy weapons, black
globes and other systems I\'ve grown used to having in my Universe.

IMHO, the design rules seem to "look and feel" like CT the more I use them.
I like the concept of weapon sockets. Again, I hope FF&S will permit design
of new and different sockets.


 Some things I don\'t like:

The general trend is that the new system creates designs that are less
capable, cost more, and require many more crew members. Has anyone looked at
the 400 ton Patrol Cruiser? Nineteen crew members are now required. In
fairness, there are some exceptions. The Fiery CE costs less and seems as
capable. Still, there are 22 crew versus 10 previously.

From the above it would seem that turning a profit on trading ships will be
tougher. Any thoughts on this anyone?



If anyone has worked out the design sequence to the patrol cruiser please
post it or email it to me. I need to check my numbers.

By the way, is CAT still in existence? If so I\'d like to be included but
I haven\'t heard anything from them in a while.

Absolutely, write to BOTH Dan Corrin (dan@engrg.uwo.ca, the list admin)
and Richard Johnson (richard@agora.rain.com, the ringleader) to be added
to CAT. It\'s been quiet lately, but it\'s still a worthwhile list.

Traveller problems, so here goes:

I\'ve just brought _Brilliant Lances_ and am quite impressed by the
product, but have found a few annoying problems.

Firstly, while the mechanics of damaging crewmembers are quite clear,
there is no mention of the effect of crew loss. It seems to me that
there should be some degradation of ship performance for losing, say
half the bridge crew or engineering crew, but this is not addressed.
(casualties to other crew areas such as damcon and gunnery are
obvious)

Secondly, there is a discrepancy between the TNE rules and Brilliant
Lances rules in the number of fire phases in an half-hour combat
turn.  TNE says ten of three minutes each; BL says one. Common sense
says TNE is right, but ease of play says go with BL. Since both
rules sets use the same damage and armour stats, is this a slip-up,
or a change of policy?

Thirdly, the new ship design sequence makes no mention of a tonnage
based cap on the number of turrets installed on a ship, or the old
100 ton minimum on starships.  Is this an omission, or have these
limits been removed?  If so, are "message torpedoes" (jump capable
drones of low tonnage with data storage payloads) now possible?
what about low power anti-missile laser mini-turrets (range 300,000 km;
damage 4 and penetration 1 would kill any of the standard missiles).

Matt, If it seems your defending TNE a lot, you are. THIS IS NOT BAD!  Indeed,
the universe of Traveller can support many flavors of gaming, and TNE joins the
ranks as one of them.  However, the flavor of TNE is not one that I
particularly like.  Criticisims are not necessarilly attacks, and I hope we on
the TML are advanced enough to realize the difference.  Your defense is the
other side of the discussion, which I thank you for.  Its just that TNE gives
me the willies!  It just feels more like T:2000 and Warhammer40K than Traveller.

Dont get me wrong, I hope TNE sells like Milk-Bones on Lair, if, perhaps, only
to keep GDW alive.  GDW ranks as one of the five great gaming companies ever.
I also hope that TNE brings in more new Traveller players who might end up
exploring the different universes of Traveller (Classic and Mega) that we know
and love, universes that are more representative of the \'soul\' of Traveller.

I do feel that the planetary societies in TNE couldnt have evolved in the
70-some years after the Zap.  Two, three centuries, yes, but not this quick.
This major evolution in the setting consists of destroying all that has been
built before.  You dont have to be original to be destructive.

>I still don\'t get what you guys are all upset about: if you want to
>do Classic Traveller, set it in Deneb or the Hive Federation.  The
>setting hasn\'t been trashed, it\'s evolved.

The Traveller universe didnt have a chance to evolve.  The Virus killed it.
I for one, will not be happy contained in a \'preserve\'.

Its evolved into a lifeless parody of what it was.  If I want to do Classic
Traveller, I\'ll do Clasic Traveller and use my TNE book as a doorstop (which is
about what its doing now).  The TNE Domain is not the Domain we grew up in.
Unlike real life, I CAN go home again in Traveller.  TNE is too depressing to
ever WANT to go home.  In response, I\'ll say:"if you want to do TNE, set it in
some gorforsaken unchartered sector and leave our Imperium alone.  The setting
doesnt have to be trashed, let it evolve."  Our Imperium is not the Imperium of
GDW.

As for the buttered bread, cats, and spaceships, WOW! :-)  This makes much more
sense that the antigrav>contragrav change in TNE.

  I agree merchants will be in high demand, but the background is
not geared toward massive economic activity like in Classic Trav.
There won\'t be a lot of merchants moving between TL 7-9 worlds if
there is no way to keep them from being stranded due to starship
maintenance needs.

  Support for interstellar trade starts at TL10; without the
traffic you\'re just not going to get the same Classic background
flavor of \'hide in the crowd\'; \'just another ripple in the current.\'
It\'s up to your character to rise above the din of mediocrity.
TNE is a different flavor of background:  any merchant trade at the
frontier is high risk, automatically a standout in the quiet of
infrequent visits.

  Now it may move in that direction, but then we\'re talking about a

I was in the same position, as you were..

Now, I was Reading this Mailing list for a couple of Months,
and say a lot of bad opinions about TNE and GDW..  It might
be right, and might be wrong..

Some info about myself..

I\'m 17 years old High School Student, Attending Newtonbrook
S.S in Toronto, Canada..   I was interduced to Traveller in a
very strange way <smile>..  One day, went into my School\'s
library, and they held a Grabage Sale.. so I looked over it
and found this strange black box with the fallowing text on it:

        THIS IS FREE TRADER BEOWULF,
        CALLING ANYONE...
        MAYDAY, MAYDAY...WE ARE UNDER ATTACK...
        MAIN DRIVE IS GONE...
        TURRET NUMBER ONE NOT RESPONDING...
        MAYDAY...LOSING CABIN PRESSURE
        FAST... CALLING ANYONE... PLEASE HELP...
        THIS IS FREE TRADER BEOWULF...

                                MAYDAY...

 and that was my first glance at Classic Traveller, and I
bought that copy of CT for $2 (It is the Deluxe Edition CT)..
and I liked the system alot.. since most of the traveller
supp. are out of print, I had to wait until TNE is out..  So i
only know the CT and TNE history..  and I like the TNE
edition..  It gives us an unlimited option to role play, and
have an adventure.. - you want low tech level world.. you travel
to the Wilds.. you want good ol\' Empirum.. you travel to the
Regency.. or want a small empire..-pocket empires setting..  I
hope that GDW will never stop producing ANY traveller Supp.

Chris, please post any TL-11 and 12 variant traders that you
have.  Thanks.

Well, i think this message is a bit too long for me.. better
stop now..

More to come :-)

To GDW:

                GOOD WORK... KEEP IT UP! there is a new
generation of Roleplayers, who want to Travel.. don\'t stop now!.

  by technological means----


While reading through the mailing list, an idea occurred.  Unless the
  virus is actually physically mobile, it should be able to produce
  non-standard technologies and devices which are not succeptable to it
  (such as non-Imperial standard transceivers).  However, the Imperium
  has this famous set of standard equipment and vehicle designs which
  have been used for years and spread through-out the universe.
First point:  In the Imperium, standardization would be important.
  Letting one computer network be compatible with another, or allowing
  all standard devices to exchange data easily would be beneficial.
  For obvious reasons, this technology would spread slightly beyond
  the area of the Imperium, and alien to Imperial adapters would
  undoubtedly be developed in these fringe areas so that the
  Imperial tech is usable by the other cultures.  Which brings us
  to the big point:
The Virus was designed to exploit a fundamental yet subtle design/
  security flaw of standardized imperial technology.  Being slightly
  incorrect in design, \'Internet Worm\' syndrome occurred, with the
  time for communication increased to 6-8 days minimum.  One field of
  genetically hemogenous wheat vs. tailored predator.  Predator wins.
  End of technological society, and hello barbarism.
Oh, and BTW:  The Spinward Marches are isolated from the mainstream
  of Imperial culture/advances/stagnation in a big way.  Thus, they
  were less succeptable to the virus, and able to produce variant
  technologies fast enough to prevent major loss outside of the border
  areas.

- ----
Results:
    Collapse of Impirium, with the effects lessening as the distance from
    Core increases (the standards relax, and are slightly out of date
    due to travel concerns).

    Don\'t ask me to explain how this is feasible.  I don\'t write standards
    for non-existant technology, let alone existing technology.

    NO INTELLIGENT PSUEDO-ALIVE HARDWARE VIRUS.

    Spinward Marches have a feasible reason to advance in tech
    (the standard less likely to apply to the above-average techs).

    Reasonable reason for aliens to be affected.

    Transponders are still forgeable.

GURPS: I don\'t have Space, but I do hear tell they have spaceship
building rules in it. I suppose you could do it with Vehicles,  but
you\'d have to keep real good track of the details. Vehicles are initially
measured in cubic FEET; volume is calculated from that. It\'s primarily
for personal vehicles, though examples extend up through luxury liners
and clipper ships.

T2K damage: Can\'t vouce for the higher tech stuff, but I totally agree that
damage in that system is too low. In twilight, the average PC can take
2.5 full-damage hits from an assault rifle and still be called \'slightly\'
wounded. I haven\'t campaigned since the 2nd ed came out, so I don\'t have
any playtested fixes, but I\'ll post some as I come up with them.

The one me and a friend came up with Friday night was to simply roll d20\'s
instead of d6\'s for damage.  Guess the TNE proof readers missed this when
they went through the book :-)  A d12 or d15 could also be used instead of
the d20.  The problem the d12 is that TNE doesn\'t use a d12\'s for anything
else.  And the d15 doesn\'t exist (well, I\'ve never seen one) but it is used
to making saving rolls against age effects!

The reason would be much the same for the disparity in Tech levels across

Cor as Spinward Marches. Let\'s assume this world has a united global
government and a single global computer network (which is a lot to assume).
Th Imperium comes by, and says, "we have this standard". Well, I doubt the
Imperium would make the standard completely compatible with lower tech
systems; it couldn\'t be done without sacrificing some details. And upgrading
an entire planet\'s computer network would costly and time-consuming.

I\'m sure it\'s possible, but it\'s be a lot more complicated than you might think.

The only other thing you can do is "vote with your wallet".  If you don\'t
expect to be able to use any T:TNE suppliments, Challenge articles, and whatnot
in your game, by all means *don\'t* buy T:TNE, Brilliant Lances, or any other
GDW Traveller products.  If there are enough people out there who agree with
you, then GDW *will* get the message, albeit the hard way.

One of the other problems cited in the project\'s cancellation was the
the difficulty of flight-testing the beast.  One proposal was to tether
the missile with a long cable to an island in the Pacific.  If the autopilot
or flight controls failed, the missile would circle the island until
it crashed, its fuel was exhausted (which could take days), or it was
destroyed.

I don\'t think most Zhodani, even the nobles, think that way.  Remember that
Zhodani society is designed to produce members that believe that Zhodani
society is the best possible for Humans to live under.

While most Imperial citizens believe that the "Thought Police" are a form of
secret police who spy on everyone\'s thoughts, and that the "Re-Education
Centers" as sopisticated and effective brainwashing,  Zhodani don\'t see it
that way at all.  The average Zhodani Prole or Intendant (and many nobles as
well) see the "Thought Police" in a way analogous to the way most Americans
feel about Mike Flanagan, the cop who walks the local beat.  Except that
the Zhodani version are always there when (or actually, before) you need
them.  To most Zhodani citizens, the "Re-Education Centers" are more like
mental hospitals, except that the doctors can see what\'s going on in a
patient\'s mind, and fix it, just as easily as a physician can set a bone
using X-rays as a guide.  Any prole or intendant who more than slightly
disagrees with this world view is picked up by the "Thought Police" sooner
or later, and sent to a "Re-Education Center" until they really and truly
believe it.  Most Zhodani are products of their educational system, which
is very effective in instilling the beliefs and habits expected of proper
Zhodani.  With the few, unstable exceptions, the average Zhodani is as
unlikely to question their society as the average American is to go berzerk,
grab a gun, and start shooting people at random.  It happens; one in
several hundreds of millions each year.

Nobles, particularly those with strong psionic talents, are allowed more
freedom to dissent without being censured or re-educated; but even so, most
of them are products of the Zhodani educational system, which in almost all
cases instills these beliefs in childhood.  Nobles are probably more aware
of the cost of this system: Zhodani social institutions are relatively
rigid, and do have a tendancy to stifle the creativity to some degree.
Some nobles may go so far as to establish enclaves where un-Re-Educated
researchers can explore, investigate, and create without being Re-Educated
whenever they go too far off the deep end.  Of course, other nobles may
feel that this is being cruel to the people involved (who would certainly
be unhappy about being kept in a padded cell, no matter how well
furnished).  As a matter of fact, this whole subject might be best
explored in an adventure setting ...

Zhodani citizens are likeley to (still) look upon citizens of the Regency
with some combination of fear, pity, and distrust.  After all, those poor
people still have to deal with the Regency court system, which is at worst
a tool of opression, and at best relies on the memory and judgement of the
participants.  Compare to the Zhodani system, where a noble can examine
the accused psionically and determine guilt or innocence directly.  And
while the various police and security forces of the Regency may try their
best, they are still not as good at preventing crime before it happens as
the Zhodani "Thought Police" - most Regency criminal investigations start
*after* the crime has been committed; a small consolation if you happen
to be the victim.

The Zhodani consulate is still the only place in which houses, starships, and
personal valuables can be left unlocked and unguarded without fear of
theft or vandalism.  And most Zhodani probably still fear the dishonesty
and violence of Regency society.

There is some evidence that Norris in particular, and Imperial Naval
Intelligence in general, has always had psionic special operatives.  This
goes well back into Classic Traveller; check out the relevant entries
in the Classic Traveller library data suppliments.  If they exist, they
will probably be very, very secret, even into the "present" of the New Era.

No, no, no.  Straightjackets aren\'t the way to go.  I\'ll just
turn you over to Daviv Nilsenptrl of the Thought Police, and
he can ship you off to a Re-Education Center to be kindly

I assume that you never experienced Classic Traveller (either in the form of the
little black books, or The Traveller Book).  Many of the features you (and most
others) liked were in Classic Traveller as well.  The thing you complained of
(difficulty in resolving space encounters) worked rather well, if a little
simplistically, in Classic Traveller.

MegaTraveller did several things right.  The task system was an excellent
extension to Classic Traveller, and finally all of the character generation was
put into one book.

I had one major gripe with MegaTraveller: Errors.  Far too many of them.  There
were also a number of minor problems: MegaTraveller was expensive, and it was
organized so that game rules and background were spread out through the three
books, so that you *had* to get all three (at a rather expensive price) to
have a playable game.  The design sequences were complex, and riddled with
errors (designing a starship took an enjoyable less than fifteen minutes with
pencil and paper and Classic Traveller\'s Book 2 or Book 5; MegaTraveller took
several hours and required a calculator or computer spreadsheet).  One of
MegaTraveller\'s biggest problems was one of attracting new players: in my
experience, MegaTraveller was hard for new players to understand and "get into".
Not because of the extensive background information, but due to the way it
was presented.  MegaTraveller was written by people who were intimately
familliar with *ALL* of it, and many parts of the result assumed that the
reader was similarly knowledgable.  In other words, it made sense to Traveller
players and baffled outsiders.  Play testing and/or soliciting opinions on
MegaTraveller from people who weren\'t previously familliar with Traveller
would have caught and fixed this problem.

Aren\'t starships and spaceships covered in GURPS Space?

For weapon design, of ANY type: Greg Porter\'s _Guns, Guns, Guns_ 3rd Edition
(3G3 to it\'s friends).  3G3 has conversion to Twilight: 2000 (2nd Ed) in the
back of the book (this will, of course, convert to Traveller: The New Era as
well, because it uses the T2k2 system).  Conversion to MegaTraveller and other
system are covered, as well.  Greg has done his homework, and has had two
previous editions to work the bugs out of the rules.  3G3 works *very* well,
and is relatively easy to use and understand.  3G3 will be one of my standards
for comparison to FF&S when it finally comes out.

My last campaign was set in the Spinward Marches, and involved a noble
son who enlisted in the Scout Service against his father\'s wishes and
his cousin from the "wrong side of the tracks".  This campaign, amount
other things, featured characters that were absolutely unwilling to
break (or even bend) any Imperial law, and managed to never break any
local laws either.  This campaign featured a lot of role-playing and
very little combat at all.

In other campaigns, I have had a player character who refused to carry
a firearm.  I have had charecters that, during the entire campaign, haven\'t
used deadly force against anybody.  I have also had campaigns that
involved a mercenary unit, and routinely featured some sort of combat.
Most campaigns have fallen somewhere inbetween these two extremes.

This isn\'t to say that my campaigns aren\'t interesting or exciting, but
I choose to add excitement to the adventure in many different ways.  This
isn\'t really a good time to go into the basics of plotting, but suffice
it to say that there are many ways of adding suspense, conflict, and
excitement into an adventure plotline without resorting to armed violence.

I feel that combat is empahsized in too many role-playing game scenarios.
Combat is easy to write in, and it provides a garanteed "cheap thrill".
But think back; many of your most memorable moments in an RPG, or for
that matter, in a movie or television show, aren\'t the combats.  As
human beings, it is the interaction of people that holds our interest.

So, make it a people story.  Watch good television or movies, and see
those writers use their tricks: because this is a science-fiction game
we\'re talking about, Star Trek: The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine
are always good sources of insparation.  But also old dramatic series
like Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere work as well.  While you\'re
enjoying your favorite show, also think about how it was plotted: what
is the writer up to, what makes this a good (or bad) show.

Material presented in Challenge seems to me to have limited play value.
Most of the published material are short adventures, and they typically
depend on definite and specific "starting conditions" that makes them
hard to integrate into a non-official campaign.

Material that I have found useful in _The Journal_ includes non-adventure
pieces on role-playing and plotting in general, and relatively independent
adventure ideas that can be placed in many campaigns.

Some of the best sources of these "adventure ideas" were the old Casual
Encounter and Amber Zone columns.  The best of these (including "Finger"
and "Geria Transfer") are relatively world and background independent, and
can be dropped into an ongoing campaign to side track the PCs for a while.

Resistance is USELESS!

Everything we\'ve done is available in raw form (meaning that you will
have to sift through the message archives to extract the stuff) from
the archive site at ocf.berkeley.edu, in the pub/Traveller/TNE-pocket

Actually variant weapons stats, or even variant combat rules, isn\'t so much
of a problem.  As long as your variant system has a comprehensive set of
weapons and handles all of the situations that the "standard" does, what\'s
the problem?

Back in the days of Classic Traveller, there were lots of variant combat
systems running around.  Some people used the original, while lots of folks
used Snapshot, Azhanti High Lightning, or Striker, and some people did
unusual variants on those.

If anybody does work out variant weapons stats, I certainly hope that
they will post them here for the rest of us to use.

The company I work for publishes (on an approximately annual basis) a
CD-ROM containing a rather specialized database and associated retrieval
software.  For the last few years, we have used Sony as our supplier;
we provide the data (some 200Mb) to Sony in DOS format, and they convert
it to ISO standard format, and press the disks.  The cost for 150 disks
is between $1200 and $1700, depending on what sort of deal we can swing
with them.  Most of this cost is a fixed set-up charge and a fixed data
conversion charge (usually $500 to convert to ISO format), the per-disk
costs are low, about $1 to $2 per disk.  This is for disks individually
shrink-wrapped in jewel boxes, and two-color artwork printed on the
disk, but no liner in the box (just shows the disk through the clear top).

Everything published to date for Traveller (let\'s say *EVERYTHING*: all
of Classic Traveller, all the adventures, all the suppliments, every
issue of the Journal of the Travellers\' Aid society, all of MegaTraveller
and everything published for it.  Furthermore, let\'s be optimistic
and assume that you can negotiate for all of the third-party stuff:
all of the Paranoia Press, FASA, and DGP stuff for Traveller and
MegaTraveller, and all the rest).  It would probably *ALL* fit on a
single CD-ROM.  It would be a large piece of work organizing it, but
with the help of a scanner and some dedication, it is a doable
task.

Let\'s assume the following arrangement: Let\'s say you convince GDW to
allow this for (say) $2 per disk plus 30% of the net (after everything
has been paid for) profit, if any.  If you wanted to include any of the
DGP stuff (and it might be nice), maybe they\'d go for $1 plus 10%, and
ditto for FASA, and maybe up to $1 per disk plus none of the net profits
for other Traveller liscencees (like Paranoia Press, Gamelords, etc, if
the copyright holders can be located).  Give yourself $0 per disk plus
50% of the net profit, which makes a total of $5 per disk in royalties.
OK, then let\'s set the "list price" of the disk at $50 per disk; then
let\'s allow $5 per disk for overhead (hopefully less than this), leaving
$40 per disk.  Furthermore, let\'s give the pre-orders a 10% ($5) price
break.

Therefore you would need about 45 pre-orders in hand to break even.  If
you get more pre-orders than that, you might want to order a number of
disks that totals about three times the number of pre-orders recieved.
Presumably you would wait until you had at least 45 pre-orders before you
went and had the disks pressed.  In such a case, you would be out
your time (but not your money), while GDW would get $90, if all you
sold were those 45 pre-orders.

If you eventually sold all 150 of the disks, let\'s assume 100 of them
direct (50 at $45 and 50 at $50 each), and the other 50 through stores
(the stores pay you $25 each, and sell them for the $50 list price), the
final results would be: $6000 gross.  Pressing cost $1500.  Royalties
cost $750, and overhead $750, leaving a net profit of $3000.  You would
make a total of $1500.  GDW would get ($300+$900) $1200, DGP and FASA
would get $450 each, while the others would get some fraction of $150.

Worth it?  You decide.

I\'m certain that all of the text for all of the published Traveller material
to date would easily fit on a single CD-ROM.  The only question is how many
maps, illustrations, and other graphic materials could you include.

Inquiring minds want to know.  Does GDW have any "standard" for liscencing
(come to think of it, does GDW have any current liscencees?), and are there
any plans afoot to bring liscencees aboard?

One of the things that was good about Classic Traveller\'s heyday was the
number and variety of things that were available.  The ones I remember from
early on where Paranoia Press and FASA.  Having a variety of different
companies publishing made for nice variety.  Is there anybody besides
Scott Kellogg and myself who remember the FASA "Sky Raiders" series with
great fondness?

I defer to someone who is more familiar with the T2k2 system to figure
this part out.  I *assume* Vanya\'s calculations are correct, but he could
be missing a factor somewhere.  It does jive with what little I know about
the T2k2 system: it simulates combat as shown on movies and television
rather than real life.  Lots of gunplay to add "excitement" to the
adventure, but not too deadly or we\'ll kill the PCs off.

Quick-n-Dirty fixes: (Don\'t know what this does to "game balance" or anything
else, but it definitely *WILL* make combat deadlier).  Double the damage value
of all slug throwers TL-8 and below.  Triple the damage value of slug
throwers TL-9 and above.  Change the penetration values of laser weapons to
1/4 (one quarter), leave damage alone.  In personal combat consider high-energy
(plasma and fusion) weapon hits agains personnel who are not in "hard" armor
(hard armor means Combat Armor or Battle Dress) as 100% fatal; resolve high
energy fire agains Combat Armor or Battle Dress normally).  This *hasn\'t*
been tested, but give it a try and let us know what you find out.

If you like the T:TNE rules set, go ahead and play in the "Classic" Imperium;

Hey, whoa.  If you (like I do) have a lot of the old background data, go ahead
and use it.  In my opinion, it *IS* one of Traveller\'s greatest resources.

Something which I would have preferred to see in T:TNE was a separation between
the rules set and the "Official" background universe.  This was the case in
the original Traveller game: about all the background it contained was the
"Travellers\' Aid Society", and the assumption that game play would take place
in an established interstellar society.

Although earlier products (in particular, the Traveller Book) led the way in
including background material and "starter" adventures in the rules, it was
MegaTraveller that really broke away from the original concept.

I was hoping that T:TNE would start back in the other direction, but alas
this is not so.  I\'m afraid that this might make it a little more difficult
to put out "universe" books, that detail alternate campaign universes
using the T:TNE rules.  One such universe might be Classic Traveller, in
which the Rebellion and Virus never happened.  Others might be 2300AD, and
even completely new (or liscenced from some S-F writer) ones.

I think I\'ve said that in the past, as have others.  You have a fix; you do
indeed get to say what you think is wrong, and how your solution addresses
those problems.  It\'s the details that are hard sledding; but keep us posted,

True; however, many folks aren\'t trying for realism, they are trying
for the Indiana Jones adventures.  A of the cuff remark without
any proof other than what I see at gaming groups and gaming
conventions is that most gamers don\'t have any real combat
experience.  They don\'t realize that a target range is not
the same as a firefight.

Thanks for posting the info, there is a great deal of campaign useable
stuff in there.  Why are the Mexican border police stepping across
the line, and various other questions.

Well, I found Franks article pretty fascinating, however I do have
some comments.

First, it can\'t be true -- I haven\'t seen it on COPS 8-)...

From the sounds of these encounters, it sounds like John Woo has
the most accurate portrayal of gunfighting in Cinema today.

I don\'t think any game system I\'ve seen can represent the speed at
which (I imagine) some of these encounters happened. Games break
these situations down into frames of animation. One step at a
time. Before/during an encounter, people are moving, things are
happening, there\'s a flow, a tension, speed, anxiety then *BANG*!
Combat mode. The flow stops, dice are rolled, and 13.6 units of
blood flow from 2.7 PCs and NPCs.

I think that the article shows the value of shock and being
incapacitated versus killed. It also shows the value of having a
hospital nearby.

Finally, I think that it brings home something that, despite the
engineering/calculus or Real World data, we are discussing the
"Lethality" of a game. I don\'t think anyone is going to go home and
try to duplicate the articles results with their favorite game system.
They\'re not going to come back and say "Lopez has Initiative-X and
Small Arms-Y" etc. And I would hope that nobody is going to run home
and shoot themselves through the neck just find out how bad it is, or
how survivable.

Combat is a plot device that is used to direct the flow and path of the
party. Most GMs know the result of the encounter before characters
even arrive. There are very few scenarios where the GM has an "If the
characters survive" paragraph. Its pretty much implied that the
characters are going to survive. Deterred from their chosen path, but
alive. Otherwise, game over, clean up the chips and beer, and go home.
Most GMs have rolled the damage dice against a character, looked at
all of the 6\'s, and decide "Umm..3 points George, hmm..you seem
to black out".

We want things realistic so that we can have a point of reference. We
want to stretch our reality in one way, but it still needs to be
anchored some place else. If the guns and bullets work as we expect,
then the absurdity of our situation is OK.

"Allright, you guys cut through the electric fence, sneaked past the
dogs, knocked out the guard, and have reached the computer center. The
computer doesn\'t respond to CTRL-ALT-DEL." says the GM, making
eye-contact with his group of pot-bellied, pale players while they
suck back another Coke and a handful of chips. Fred is scratching
something.

"Hey, that\'s not realistic! I\'ve seen those computers at Video Blips,
and that always works!" screams the "Intrusion Specialist".

So, regardless of what the article presents, regardless of what the
book says, regardless of what Really Happens (tm). The result of any
action is pretty much determined by the GM. If the GM and players like
a game with lots of spent cartridges and dead NPCs, then thats what
will happen. If the GM feels that guns should be very dangerous, armor
fragile, etc., then .22 revolvers end up doing 22D6 damage.

Lethality is a plot device, at least for most of us. The GM knows
how effective something is, its their game, and their adventure. We
play it, not live it. That\'s a Good Thing.

    'body' => '  Lethality in Roleplaying Small Arms Systems

  By Frank A Chadwick

  I know of few issues in roleplaying systems that cause as
  much passionate argument as do small arms fire, both hit
  probability and damage. Over the years I have heard repeated
  complaints about the "low lethality" of what was originally
  the Twilight: 2000 combat system, and which is now GDW\'s
  core roleplaying system. I don\'t know how many times I\'ve
  heard actually _angry_ gamers tell me that they can hit a
  man-size target 100% of the time at X range, and our rules
  are BS because they have less than a 50% chance, or even
  worse. Or that this wound or that wound might or might not
  knock someone down in the game, but in "real life" would
  invariably prove fatal.

  It\'s always been my feeling that these arguments produce a
  great deal more heat than light, and are usually based on
  personal prejudice and repeated viewings of Hollywood war
  movies, rather than a serious examination of facts.  So in
  the spirit of casting real light on the subject, I\'d like to
  present a series of actual close range combat shootings, all
  drawn from the experiences of the San Diego Police
  Department\'s experimental Border Crime Task Force during the
  eighteen months of its existence.

  A rugged area of undeveloped canyons and gullies along the
  US-Mexican border between San Diego and Tijuana was the site
  of numerous nocturnal border crosing by illegal aliens. That
  was the responsibility of the US Imigration Service. But the
  people coming north illegally  were being systematically
  brutalized by gangs of crooks - robbery, assault, and rape
  were commonplace, and as the violence escallated murder
  would be as well. That was the responsibility of the San
  Diego Police Department, since this area of rugged ravines,
  even though a barren wilderness, was inside the city limits.

  The Task Force members, fewer than a dozen undercover
  policemen disguised as illegal immigrants, went into the
  canyons at night and waited to be attacked. When it
  happened, they made arrests, or tried to. Given the
  environment, it was only a matter of time before deadly
  force was used by both sides in what became a running
  guerrilla war.

  The following represents most of the actual exchanges of
  gunfire that took place during the unit\'s existence. I will
  present as much information as I know, and make a few
  observations at the end, but leave gamers to draw their own
  conclusions as to hit probabilities and weapon lethality.
  1. February 1, 1976

  Sergeant Lopez (the Task Force supervisor) and Officer
  Castillo encountered two suspects near the Mexican border
  deep in the canyons. One was a well-dressed man armed with a
  .45-caliber automatic, the other dressed in rags and apparently
  unarmed. At close range (a few yards) the gunman covered
  the two officers with his automatic, first pointing it at
  Sergeant Lopez. Both officers squated on the ground and
  continued their pretense that they were illegal immigrants.
  When the gunman shifted the pistol to his left hand and
  turned it on Officer Chacon, Sergeant Lopez quickly reached
  into his clothing, drew the .38 special snub nosed revolver
  from his shoulder holster, and fired all five rounds at the
  gunman in rapid succession. (The weapon was apparently a
  Smith & Wesson Model 36 Chief\'s Special, which holds only
  five rounds in the cylinder.) Several rounds hit the gunman
  and jerked him around. As he twisted to the side, Officer
  Castillo drew his own pistol and shot the gunman once as he
  fell to the ground.
  The second suspect began to flee, Officer Castillo fired
  again, and that suspect also fell to the ground. Castillo
  ran to the prone suspect and, overcome by an adrenaline
  reaction, lost control and began beating him.

  The gunman, it turned out, was Officer Luis Tamez of the
  Mexican Immigration service and the ragged suspect was
  reported to be his informant. The exact reason why Officer
  Tamez was on the US side of the border and what his
  intentions were remained a source of controversy.

  Of the six shots fired at point blank range at Tamez (five
  by Lopez and one by Castillo), five hit. Two bullets struck
  him in the groin, one hit him in the right chest directly
  over the nipple, one hit his arm, and one hit his buttock as
  he spun around and fell to the ground. Of all of these, the
  chest wound was the most visible, as Tamez\'s shirt
  immediately became soaked with blood, but it did the least
  damage, as the .38 Special bullet bounced off Tamez\'s
  ribcage and did only superficial damage. The two groin hits
  were the the most dangerous, and all of the participants
  were convinced that Tamez was dying. Since cross-winds were
  too strong to allow a helicopter to land in the canyons, the
  two officers tried to manhandle Tamez up the steep wall, but
  Tamez found it so painful to be dragged over the rocks that
  he demanded to be laid down and then got up, pushed the
  officers away, and climbed out of the canyon under his own
  power.

  Both of the wounded men recovered completely.
   2. March 23, 1976

  Officers Chacon, Vasquez, Salgado, Castillo, and Gil were
  together in Deadman\'s Canyon sitting on the banks of a
  shallow dry streambed when they were approached by two
  suspects. Officer Chacon was on one side of the ditch and
  the others were on the opposite side, their legs dangling
  over the edge. The suspects approached from Chacon\'s side.
  One suspect, later identified as Morales, was armed with a
  pistol and other, identified as Madrid, was armed with a
  long-bladed knife.

  All of the police officers were armed; most of them had
  two revolvers. Castillo had three revolvers and a shotgun.
  Several of them also wore bullet-proof vests. Of the five
  officers, two were combat veterans - both Salgado and Gil
  were Marine NCO\'s with extensive combat experience in
  Vietnam and both were former drill instructors. Gil had
  also been all-Marine Judo Champion.

  Morales covered the officers with his pistol and ordered
  them to put their hands up. Madrid jumped to the other side
  of the streambed to search them for valuables, still
  believing them to be illegal immigrants. All of the officers
  and suspects were now thoroughly mingled and all were
  probably within three or four meters of each other.

  Officer Castillo, armed with a short pump shotgun under
  his coat, was probably the first to fire. He pointed the
  shotgun at Morales and fired, hitting him in the gun hand
  and blowing most of the fingers off, disarming him in the
  process. All of the other officers except for Gil drew their
  revolvers and began firing. Chacon and Vasquez both emptied
  their revolvers in rapid sucession. Gil (the former judo
  champ) dove at Morales just as he was hit by the shotgun
  blast, and Morales, riddled with bullets, fell on top of Gil
  in the bottom of the ditch.

  The second suspect ran into the night pursued by Chacon
  and Vasquez, still firing. After a brief chase the second
  suspect fell wounded.

  The first bandit lay on top of Gill, apparently dead. In
  addition to the shattered hand from Castillo\'s shotgun, he
  had received seven other bullet wounds at point blank range:
  one each to the right shoulder, left lower chest, left side
  of the back, upper spine, left elbow, and two over the right
  clavicle. Amazingly, he was still live.

  The second bandit was shot three times, once in each leg
  by pistol shots and once straight through the neck, from one
  side to the other, by a stray buckshot pellet.

  Two of the officers were wounded. Castillo, shortly after
  firing his shotgun, had reached out to grab the wounded
  suspect and had been shot straight through the wrist, and
  was almost immediately incapacitated by pain. Gill, as he
  dove for Morales, was shot in the hip. Both officers were
  inadvertently shot by officer Chacon, firing across the
  ditch from the other side.

  All four injured men survived and recovered.
   3. July 9, 1976

  Sergeant Lopez and officers Cervantes, Puente, and Camacho
  (in that order from south to north) were concealed in a
  drainage pipe at the south end of the E-2 canyon, less than
  a dozen meters north of the international border. Officer
  Chacon was concealed outside of the pipe to observe the
  approach of any suspects. All were armed with revolvers and
  Officer Camacho had  a pump-action shotgun as well.

  About an hour after dusk a suspect in a ski mask
  approached the south end of the pipe. The suspect, in a
  remarkable display of strength, seized Sergeant Lopez by the
  arm, pulled him bodily from the pipe, and dragged him down a
  slope into a ravine where there were three other suspects.

  At the bottom of the ravine Sergeant Lopez was surrounded
  by four suspects, all apparently armed and covering him. The
  suspect to his left held a rifle (although this later turned
  out to be a dummy). The suspect in front of him and another
  to his right covered him with pistols. The leader of the
  group, the man in the ski mask, (and later identified as
  "Lobo") held Lopez\'s shooting arm in a vice-like grip and
  held a knife in his free hand. While Lobo still held his
  shooting arm, Lopez managed to get his hand to his wasteband
  and draw his 5-shot Model-36 and quickly emptied it in a
  semicircle around him: one shot to the man holding the
  rifle, then one at the man in front of him, then one into
  Lobo, holding his arm, then the last two bullets at the man
  to his right. At this point the suspects scattered and began
  to flee, except for Lobo, struggling with Lopez.

  Officer Cervantes scrambled out of the south end of the
  pipe and fired one round at the fleeing suspects with his
  revolver while Officer Camacho crawled out of the north end
  of the pipe and fired twice with his shotgun, dropping one
  of the fleeing suspects (who later rose and continued to
  flee). Camacho then dropped his shotgun, drew his pistol,
  and fired five more shots at the fleeing suspects. Officer
  Cervantes pursued a suspect for several meters into Mexico,
  fired one more shot at him, and then returned. As he
  returned, one of the suspects fired first four pistol shots
  at the officers from out of the darkness and later fired a
  fifth. Officer Chacon shortly afterwards heard four other
  shots fired at them from a different direction.

  The officers fired a total of two shotgun shells and about
  a dozen pistol shots. Of these, apparently one shotgun shell
  and two pistol shots scored hits. Lopez\'s point-blank shot
  at the bandit leader had broken his thigh and lodged in his
  hip, incapacitating him. None of the other suspects were
  captured, although two were later seen wounded. (One was
  admited to a Mexican hospital with his leg badly lacerated
  by buckshot. He was arrested by Mexican police. The other
  burst into a party, his chest soaked with blood, then fled
  again. He was never apprehended, nor was the fourth
  suspect.)

  Of the nine rounds fired at the police, none hit.
   4. July 19, 1976

  Officers Salgado, Camacho, and Chacon were acting as
  decoys near the border when they were spotted by two
  officers of the Tijuana Municipal Police, officers Hernandez
  and Espindola, who considered their actions suspicious and
  investigated with revolvers drawn, using their flashlights.
  A second Task Force team, consisting of Sergeant Lopez and
  officers Puente,

  Vasquez, and Castillo, were nearby under cover and were soon
  also seen by Officer Hernandez, who considered their actions
  atypical of illegal border crossers and suspected that they
  were criminals. The two task force teams joined up by a
  gully as Hernandez climbed down to confront them. At his
  point Sergeant Lopez, believing the two Tijuana poliemen
  were trying to extort money from border crossers, jumped
  down from his side of the ravine to face Hernandez, held up
  his badge in his left hand and his revolver in his right,
  and yelled "Policia! Policia!"All of the Task Force members
  drew and pointed their guns as Officer Espindola screamed
  the unneccessary warning to Hernandez,"He\'s got a gun!"

  Hernandez, instead of firing, raised his pistol and struck
  Lopez in the chest with the barrel, knocking him down. Later
  everyone would have a different impression of who fired
  first. Hernandez got off five rounds before collapsing under
  a hail of San Diego Police fire, and his partner Espindolo
  emptied his pistol (aparently a ten-round automatic) as he
  scrambled back toward their squad car. The Task Force
  members all fired, and fired a total of one shotgun round
  and thirty-three pistol rounds. These broke down as follows:

  Fired At Hernandez: 14 pistol shots from Puente,
  Castillo, Camacho, Chacon, and Lopez.

  Fired At Espindolo: 19 pistol shots from Salgado,
  Castillo (his second pistol), Vasquez, Camacho, and Chacon
  (his second pistol).

  Fired At Both: One shotgun shell fromVasquez in the
  general direction of both officers (after which the shotgun
  jammed and Vasquez drew his pistol).

  Three officers were wounded in the incident.

  Espindolo was hit four times: once in the leg and then
  three more times in the back as he crawled back toward his
  squad car. He reached his squad car and drove away for help.
  Taken to a hopital, he recovered from his wounds and later
  returned to duty.

  Hernandez, the closer of the two, was hit twice, and
  ballistics tests showed that both bullets were fired by
  Officer Chacon. Amazingly, Lopez, lying at Hernandez\' feet,
  had missed with all three shots he fired.  One of Chacon\'s
  bullets hit Hernandez in the abdomen and the other hit him
  in the arm. He attempted to crawl back across the border but
  was seized by the Task Force officers and arrested. He later
  recovered from his wounds and returned to duty.

  Chacon was hit once in the upper arm, recovered fully, and
  returned to duty.
  5. January 25, 1977

  Sergent Lopez, officers Puente, Castillo, Chacon, and
  Vasquez encountered a group of three suspects who pretended
  to be undercover police and tried to extort money from them.
  When Puente moved to cut of the retreat of the bandits south,
  a suspect jumped on him with a long knife and began struggling.
  Officer Vasquez jumped on the back of the suspect and, fearing
  that he was about to stab Puente, put his snub-nosed .38
  caliber Special against the back of the suspect\'s head and
  fired once. The pistol shot instantly killed the assailant
  and temporarily blinded Vasquez. Puente had not even seen
  the knife.

  At the same time one of the suspects lunged at Sergeant
  Lopez with a knife. Lopez fired once at the suspect at
  point-blank range, and then fired again as the suspect
  dashed by him. Lopez then emptied his pisol at the fleeing
  suspect and when that had no effect began to pursue him on
  foot. Eventually he overtook the suspect and overpowered
  him. After the struggle the suspect noticed, for the first
  time, that he had been wounded once in the elbow.

  The third suspect was facing Officer Chacon, who this
  night was armed with a shotgun. Chacon raised the shotgun
  and, at a range nearly close enough to touch the suspect
  with his hand, discharged the shotgun once directly into the
  center of the suspect\'s chest. The suspect stood for a
  moment looking at him, then turned around and walked calmly
  away into the darkness. Unsure whether he had somehow missed
  the target or the suspect was wearing some form of body
  armor, Chacon followed him cautiously and soon found him
  lying peacefully on the ground, dead of massive chest
  injuries. (San Diego Police Lieutenant Richard Snider would
  later describe the wound as, "...a hole in his chest you
  could throw a cat through.")
  Observations

  In the five incidents presented above, Task Force officers
  fired about ninety rounds, most of them at close range, and
  scored 29 hits, or 32%. Of even more interest are the eight
  shots fired while effectively in physical contact with the
  target (one shot by Lopez at the leader "Lobo" in incident
  three, 3 shots by Lopez at Hernandez in incident four, and
  in incident five 2 of Lopez\'s 5 shots at his suspect,
  Chacon\'s 1 shot and Vasquez\'s 1 shot). Of these eight shots,
  only four were hits, or 50%. Finally, it is intersting how
  many of the casualties were achieved by one man, Chacon.
  Although he apparently did not fire or score hits in
  incident three and was not present for incident one, he hit
  with his only shot in the fifth incident, was the only
  officer to hit Hernandez in the fourth incident, and
  actually scored at least one, and perhaps more, hits on
  every man (including the two friendly officers) wounded in
  the second incident.

  As to bullet lethality, a total of fifteen officers and
  suspects were wounded in these five incidents, and they were
  hit by a total of 32 bullets. Most of the injured men were
  struck by a single bullet; four were struck by muliple
  bullets, and of these one was struck by eight bullets. Of
  these fifteen casualties, 2 were killed almost instantly
  while the other thirteen survived and recovered. All of
  those who suffered multiple gunshot wounds recovered. That
  is, none of the fatalities were caused by a cumulative
  build-up of trauma, but rather were due to a single,
  almost instantly fatal, wound.

  There are not enough cases here to provide the statistical
  basis for a complete small arms combat system, but there is
  plenty of food for thought. The breakdown of the hits by
  body area is shown on the following chart. The first column
  shows the body area. The second shows the number of hits to
  that area. The third shows the proportion of the total hits
  sufered by that body area. The fourth shows the number of
  fatal wounds to that body area. The last column shows the
  proportion of wounds to that area which were fatal.

It wouldn\'t be such a big issue if it didn\'t take such a big chunk
of the rules for most roleplaying games.  Partly caused by this,
combat tends to be a vital part of most campaigns.  (It\'s a lot
easier to write a scenario for which you already have some rules)

That\'s quite impressive - 80% hit rate for a series of 5 snap-shots,

OK, low damage roll.

High damage roll.  In systems that account for it, quite possibly
also internal bleeding and other complications.

Not uncommon.  A large fraction of dangerous or fatal gunshot wounds
are not immediate.  Fairly prompt medical attention is often
effective.

One shotgun shot to the hand, hitting, doing serious damage to
that hand.  Then more snap-shots, these in a melee situation.

But there may have been more - there were two *verified* hits.
One shotgun blast (at unknown range, at night, fired at a moving
target) of two hit, about 7 pistol shots were also fired under the
same conditions, 1 almost certainly hitting, the others having
unknown result.  The 5 initial shots were snap-shots, with the
firing arm held "in a vice-like grip".

As is common with gunshot wounds, death was not instantaneous.  In
this case, almost certainly inevitable.

What about the `first shot\' hit rate?  Most of the shots were
rapid-fire snapshots without aiming - and T2000 assumes that
shots are `normally\' fired after aiming.

3 of the shots were "amazingly" misses.  That implies that the
writer expected that they should normally have hit, thus a higher
percentage would be more typical.

In the second incident, I\'d have to say that his hits on friendly
officers shouldn\'t be counted, since they were almost certainly
not the intended target.  If you count only shots fired under the
same conditions, his hit rate isn\'t statistically better than all
the other officers.

What about the shotgun blast through the chest?  Was that classified
as `almost instantly\'?  Also, all those who were known to have
survived presumably received medical treatment.  The fate of those
who didn\'t receive expert medical help is presumably not known.

This is quite common.  Those who do not die within a few minutes
(and receive medical care) often recover.  Multiple wounds (no one
of which kills) usually kill slowly by blood loss and long-term
internal damage, which medical science can treat, but is often
fatal if not treated.

Also, these cases illustrate severely sub-optimal conditions with
pistols in extremely poor lighting, where both sides are aware
of the other, and in melee circumstances.  Also, even as examples,
they illustrate *typical* results, rather than *potential*.  As
stated earlier in this list, even *maximum* damage to the chest
won\'t kill a target with most weapons, unless multiple rounds are
fired.  This conflicts with the observation that fatalities were
due to "a single, almost instantly fatal, wound".

Besides, were these examples selected randomly?  They illustrate
less lethality than is evidenced by "The Journal of Trauma".

   Depends. We usually get a royalty (a percentage of gross
  earnings), and we normally get a cash payment up front (earnest
  money) of $1000, as an advance against those royalties. Size of
  the advance and the percentage of gross is negotiable. With
  established companies like RAFM, we sometimes waive the advance.

   You\'re neglecting the "Quick Kill rule\'" which is no longer
  optional in TNE. Each round hitting the head or chest has a
  chance of killing that target character (a D20 per shot for the
  damage value of the shot or less, in the case of a 9mmm this
  would be a 1). I don\'t have the statistics to be able to
  determine what the odds are of killing a character in 10 D20
  rolls are, but I would think they are more significant than you
  give them credit for.

   An option we recommend for people who think the combat system
  is not deadly enough is to roll D10s or D20s instead of D6s for
  damage dice.

  According to R M Ogorkiewicz ("Technology of Tanks") tank gunners are on
average half as good in combat as they are on the range. I\'d bet that
infantry that doesn\'t sit in a nice chair behind equivalent 500mm of armour
in a dry vehicle have a performance in combat of one third of what they
have on the range.

  The first thing that should always be repeated in arguments over guns
and damage in roleplaying games is that _not even professional wound-
ballisticists agree on more than the basic mechanism behind bullet trauma
to humans_(1).

***
  Designing a damage system for a game using todays knowledge of wound
ballistics is like designing a SFRPG without knowing newtonean mechanics.
  The absence of formulas has to be countered by using large amounts of
empirical data.
***

  The second thing that should be repeated is that bullets do strange things
in bodies. They can find avenues where they can pass without causing much
damage on the least likely of places(2). Sometimes they get stuck in bones
and cartilage, sometimes they bounce, and sometimes they curve around and
follow the bone in an entirely new direction. Somtimes they change direction
for no reason at all.

  I think there exists huge amouts of empirical data on military and civilian
shootings collected by the Army (3), FBI, medical journals etc that would
be useful. I think the example from the border force had a good selection
of cases(4) although (as stated) too few.

  My opinion, though, on systems is that they should have the capability of
giving widely separate results almost randomly. A wimpy bullet should have
the capability to kill a Grizzly while a big and ugly round should have
the capability to leave a wimpy person alive and almost unharmed. The
chance of this occuring does not have to be big, but it should exist.

  [This is why I\'m using openended damage rolls, all 6\'es rolled means that
another dice is rolled and added to the total and so on, in T2k:) ]

(1). A good example is the stories behind various modern bullet designs:
     Glaser, AET, Hydrashok, Magsafe, Black Talon, Starfire, Sabre, Cyclone.
     Some of them work and some of them don\'t, and it is for all practical
     purposes impossible to predict this beforehand using pure theory
     without empirical data.

(2). There is an story told about three Finnish machinegunners that were
     shot in the head from directly in front of them by a Soviet sniper.
     All of them survived without major incapacitation because the bullets
     had passed between the brainhalves and above the stem. This is of
     course totally unsubstantiated information and even I think it sounds
     a little strange to say the least.

(3). US Army, the Swedish Army uses anestecized pigs.

(4). Good selection means no selective editing. By choosing real cases to
     suit the theory one could prove precicely anything so it is very
     important that the data is complete.

what I missed from older Traveller, its resources and supplements. I think
I can succicntly itemise it:
		The Ship\'s Locker
		Amber Zone
		Casual Encounters
		The Bestiary
These were "departments" in the old JTAS. Jointly they formed a sort of
"cut and paste" directory of "clip art" that you could insert into ongoing
campaigns or adventures. The 6-Patrons section in Challange-70 is a dim
reflection of this. The characters therein are rather limited in their
use. They specifically cater for the given campaign assumptions.
	Why is it called Traveller? The original conception of the game
was centered around the Traveller\'s Aid Society. Here was the SF equivalent
of an Edwardian men\'s social club. Members could relax and enjoy a cigar
in most corners of the world. Down on your money or stuck for the next
trip? The notice board in the TAS is the most elegant plot device I have
ever seen for setting players on course for their next adventure.
	An ironic aside: "Travellers" is a term used in Ireland to refer
politely to itinerants. The homeless, Tinkers, Gypsies, and Knackers are
less polite terms. Perhaps GDW\'s brave new vision of the TAS is a home
for down and out vagabonds.

	The other stock answer I have seen is "RPGs are about using
your imagination. So get out there, dickwad, and use your imagination
to write your own stuff."
	I\'m sorry. When I was a student that was fine. Now I\'m a nine to
fiver and most of my creative bent goes into my job. Any long-term campaign
becomes individualised. Store-bought scenarios always need some localisation
work. More the longer the campaign has gone on for. The above mention
departments were particularly useful because of their portability.
	I run Traveller for a few hours on unpredictable weeknights. My
weekends are tied up in other hobbies. I\'m mentally shagged by the time
I get home from work. And there is *always* housework.
	When I look on my D&D campaign (10 years old this weekend!) I can
see redily that the most expansion, as regards fleshing out of my own
particular multiverse, occured when I was in college and had, say, 8 hours
a week to devote to working on campaign background and adventure creation.
Now the characters are expanding across the world and I am having a
great difficulty finding the time to fill in the corners (Damn Spelljammer
anyway :-).
	Similarly in Traveller, where sometimes several times each
advneture the characters disembark on a completely different world
with a completely different culture it is a great struggle to keep
variety. "So what is Yasedi known for?" they ask. "Buggered if I know",
I\'m tempted to answer. All I can do is call up the social detail on my
LIBRARY program and wing it from there.
	"Writing it all myself" is not a tenable option. Not through a
lack of imagination, but a lack of time. Thus I mourn the arrival of
a new mentality in GDW that produces narrow band supplements that I can\'t
use.

	Silver lining: despite GDW\'s explination that Space: 1889 never
took off I note with interest that articles, information so forth are
*still* appearing in Challange. The own discussion of it on this list
shows there is still a lot of product loyalty there. I wonder would it
have been better for Traveller if GDW dropped Traveller like it dropped
1889?

On Darrian psionics, as far as I know there hasn\'t been anything
published that indicated that they had highly advandced psionics
institutes, but there hasn\'t been anything that would indicate they
didn\'t, either.  The Swords Worlds approach to Psionics would be
interesting too... their allies are the Zho\'s, but they come from
anti-psi Terran stock.

I was convinced by Frank Chadwick\'s explanation of (basically) why
he had chosen the combat system he did.  I\'ve only been shot,
I\'ve never shot at anyone else, so I wouldn\'t nit-pick about
the specific conditions of the example.  His point was, simply:
It\'s not as easy as you think to hit someone, and peoplea
are hard to kill.  This is the basis of the combat system.  As a
former critic of the combat system, I withdraw my complaint ;-)

TA: If you\'re running a 5th Frontier War campaign, do you have a
copy of the game?  It\'s really very good, if you have a lot of time.
I used the moves a background for a campaign, and it worked really
well at providing realism, adventure ideas, and unexpected encounters
for the players.

Matt:
The Hexagonal group sounds like the Old Austria-Hungary Empire (or whatever
the formal name of it was).  I remember reading a quote from the  AH
foreign minister who said in 1870 that if the Empire didn\'t exist, something
would be needed to replace it.

Tim:
Frank provided an "average" example of combat in rugged conditions.
The Journal of Trauma probabaly only concerns itself with worst-case
senarios, so it will have higher death rates.  They aren\'t likely to
write up "This guy got shot in the arm and but, we took out the slugs,
and he was fine" because that\'s not helpful to physicians.  The
guy getting shot in the head (and his low probabilty of survival
after spraying his brains all over the other guy) is more helpful :-)

	There is something to be said for the argument
which Frank put forwards (via Loren) about most wounds
being minor if treated.  One of my real-world (hobbies?)
is defensive shooting, and I pay lots of attention to what actually
happens out in the real world.  The incidents which were
described, with 90% survival rate from wounds, are about
par for the course, though perhaps a little low.  Nationwide
the highest fatality rate from shootings is rifle/shotgun
shootings with about 35% fatality, then pistols way behind
at 20% to 11% depending on what year it was.

	That having been said, I still think there are some
holes in the T2k2 damage system, and here\'s what I don\'t
like about it...

	Situation: .357 magnum fired at bodyguard wearing
good (III-A) body armour, solid chest hit
	Game: dam 2 pen 1 (close range) 9mm mag revolver,
STR+CON abt = 16, so 48 hits in chest capacity.  Shot does
maximum damage for 6 points (1die penetrates) and one more
point of blunt trauma, total 7.  Agility is 7 or 8 for
the individual, so no knockdown, character laughs it off and
returns fire after mandatory lost action due to scratch
wound.
	Reality: Round didn\'t come close to penetrating vest,
but bodyguard was incapacitated by the blunt trauma for several
minutes, much longer than the shootout lasted, which ended when the
other bodyguard emptied a MP5K into the attacker, hitting 14
times.

	Situation: highway patrol officer stops suspicious car,
3 hostiles exit car and open fire as they run down embankment away.
Officer returns fire, is hit, continues to return fire.
	Game: he gets a 9mm auto pistol wound to his arm,
which should do nothing but _take his next action away_
	Reality: he didn\'t even notice, keeps firing and
hits 2 hostiles after he\'s himself wounded.

	
	In general, what I don\'t like about the T2k2 system
is that it doesn\'t differentiate between wounding and stopping
power very well.  In reality, about a third of the people shot
once with a pistol fall down and stop moving, though they\'re
only slightly wounded.  That doesn\'t happen with T2k2 combat.
On the other hand, what it does try to do about stopping power
(the mandatory lost action) quite often doesn\'t happen when
well-trained or highly-amped individuals are shot: as even
Frank\'s examples indicate, many people will keep on going
no matter what, and won\'t be incapacitated for any length
of time.
	I handle this with some house rules.  My house stopping
power rule is that there\'s no lost action due to wounding, but that
any shot (anything) has a chance to stop the victim (incapacitate
regardless of wound damage) based on rolling 1D6: if the roll
is less than or equal to the raw damage value of the weapon
plus one, minimum one (i.e. .22\'s still have a chance 8-) and maximum
five (not even .50 cal MG hits _always_ incapacitate...), then
the wounded character is incapable of any action for 1D6 rounds.
However, every time a character _isn\'t_ stopped, he gets a
"adrenaline point"... next time he\'s hit, he can use adrenaline
points to change the die roll on a one for one basis to keep
from being incapacitated.  Note that he does indeed get another
adrenaline point for the roll he has to pay to stay active after.
This takes into account the statistical 3-5% of shooting victims
who are still responding after six or more hits...
	That way, most pistols have a 33% chance to "stop" based
on one shot, magnums have a 50% chance, and .22s have a 15% chance
(which is a little low, but reasonably close).  Most rifles have
a pretty high chance (4 or less for 5mm assault rifle, 5 or less
for a 7mm assault rifle) of incapacitating, which is borne out
by combat wound statistics (most people fall over and are incapacitated
for a moderate while).  The only thing it doesn\'t work well with
is rigid armour, which I\'ve tended to rule simply stops and
disperses the trauma well enough to nullify the stopping power rule.

  Hello there...I\'m new to the list, so I apologize a head of
time for any social graces I am lacking in, or any rules I might
accidentally break :)

  I was wondering if anyone out there had seen, or developed,
rules and/or suggestions for dealing with unusual stellar
objects.
  By unusual stellar objects I mean things like comets, oort
clouds, nebulae, pulsars, neutron stars, and yes, even black
holes.
  I am interested in a realistic approach to these objects...like
what would the affect of a nebulae be to starship sensors (would
it be like in Star Trek II....would it have no effect...), could
a neutron star have a planetary system (and would it give off
enough heat to support life in such a system), and how close
can you get to a black hole before you\'re screwed?
  I\'m also curious....to all you astrophysics/astronomy dudes
out there...are there any REAL suspected unusual stellar objects
that would technically lie within the boundries of the official
GDW map of known space?

  Just curious..... :)

    'body' => 'This is the setting I\'ve been using for my TNE campaign, beginning
with some history, a summary of their first two adventures,
and an outline of their upcoming journey.

History of the Bard Refuge (all dates are approximate ;-) ):
The Bard Refuge, as Arrival Vengance and Brilliant Lances fans may know,
is a 60,000 ton Azhanti High Lightning class Frontier Cruiser originally
laid down around 1003.  Insert Standard AHL history here. It served honorably
in the Fifth Frontier War, helping to bring the war with the Sword Worlds
to an early close (see BL).  It was later refitted at the Trin
Shipyard to serve with the Aslan crewed patrol, and went into service in
1126 or 27 (see Arrival Vengence).

Fast forward to 1139.  The Bard Refuge is attacked by a Vampire Fleet,
is heavily damaged, and manages to jump away battered but alive. She
limps back to Trin (over a period of several weeks), and docks for repair
and refit.

A week later, the leaker virus stikes.  As the predominantly Aslan repair
crew tries to move the ship to aid whatever survivors there may be, the ship
starts to act on its own, and attacks the shipyard facility. The Virus kills
off the bridge crew.  The surviving repair crew, largely composed of female
Aslan, manages to force a misjump hoping to destroy the ship.

The Aslan have a running battle with the ship, trying to disable or destroy
it by forcing misjumps and sabotage.  They finally manage to hole the
fuel tanks before a jump.  They stay in jumpspace for 15 days, and after
running low on supplies put themselves into low-berths that they believe
they\'ve disconnected from the shipboard computer.

A few years pass.  The remnants of the Imperial Navy in the expanded
Solomani Sphere, now reduced to Piracy against the few remanants of the
Solomani, discover the ship, totally exhausted of fuel.  Their tests
indicate that the ship is virus free.  Led by Capt. Mark Drake, the
"Privateers" (made up of a mixed crew of mostly Vegans, Humans, and Dolphins)
slowly make basic repairs to the ship, and head it back towards the
Vegan Polity, the pocket empire that occupies the space once occupied by the
Vegan Autonomous Region. They leave the Aslan frozen because of a combination
of uncertainty about 1) whether they can trust them and 2) why they\'re frozen.

Once in Vegan Space, the virus re-emerges and wrecks havoc in the Vegan
Systems.  Again, the crew engages in a lengthy fight for the ship.
After defrosting the Aslan Commander (A female executive officer),
they take the same track to combat the virus, with the same results.

It is now 1192.  The crew of the Bard Refuge have been frozen for approximately
50 years.  The ship misjumped into the Spica Sector (0720) five decades
ago, and had not been able to refuel.

The Current Situation:
As luck would have it ;-) three groups stumble over the Bard at the
same time.

First, the Far Trader Razor\'s Edge, composed of a piratical, heartless
crew, traces rumors of the Bard to this system.  They plan to slowly
mine it for it\'s treasures and make themselves rich.  Unfortunately
(for them), they picked up an 8 year old girl a few months back.  They
thought they were rescuing her from the Droyne she was living with, and
when the Droyne (and the girl) resisted giving her up, they gunned the
Droyne down and snatched the girl.  Since she came aboard, though, strange
things began to happen.  Odd parts of the ship would overheat and melt,
the anti-grav would act up and send stuff flying around the cabin.   Sometimes,
a whole day would go by when they couldn\'t find the girl on the ship, no
matter how hard they tried.  As the Merchant\'s luck went sour, they began
to take their frustration out on the girl.

Starting about a month before they found the Bard, one of the more abusive
Merchants was found dead in his cabin, nary a mark on his body.  This happened
a couple more times before they reached the Bard.  They had the girl suit
up in a Droyne space suit (it was only big enough for her) and brought
her aboard the Bard, not trusting her enough to leave her alone with
the ship.  She dissappeared almost as soon as they entered the ship.

Second, a Hiver Embassy Ship which also misjumped into the system docked with
the Bard a few hours later.  The only sentient aboard was a Star Patterns
Trading Human Interface Robot.  It entered the ship through a different lock.
he shortly ran into the Merchants, who panicked and started firing at the
robot.  It retreated.

Third, a Hiver Explorer, charting the system, located the Bard and
also docked.  Two Hivers, Steve and Bob, entered the ship to take a look
around.  They encountered the Robot.  The Robot told them the Embassey
ship was his.  He claimed that the Hivers who had been on the ship
had put down at a hospitable planet, and that he was attempting to
get to the Federation to collect a rescue party.  Had the Hivers
checked their records (they didn\'t), they would have seen that the ship
had been listed as missing for 60 years.  The Hivers were sceptical, however.

At this point, emergency lighting came on as the merchants managed to jump
start the emergency systems.  The robot warned the Hivers of the Merchants.
He then attempted to connect to the central computer.  The robot sees the
girl (althought the Hivers don\'t).  The hivers begin to wonder about the
Robot. The Robot (and the Hiver Explorer Ship) are actually Virus.
This Virus, though, had been changed by it\'s encounter with the Hiver
Embassy Ship, and is curious, non-violent, and had a parental instinct.
The Robot was attempting to plug into the ship so that he could infect the
ship.  The central computer, infected by another virus, now awake because of
the Merchant\'s activities, tries to defend itself.  The Robot\'s virus is far
more insidious (I used the Unarmed Combat rules to simulate Virus combat),
and begins to make headway.  The Bard Virus panics and wakes up some of
the frozen crew.  It tells them if they destroy the Robot, it will
set them free.

He frees Captain Drake, the Aslan Exec, and a Vegan Security Officer.
They arm themselves and try to work their way down to the last surviving
main computer bay so that they can destroy it.  They meet the Robot
(the Hivers fled when the Merchants began broadcasting threating
messages to the little girl), and the Robot distracts the Bard Virus
while they all work their way down to the last Computer Core.
The computer kills the Merchants thinking that they are part of Robot party.
The Virus tries to stop them (leaking hydrogen gas into a deck they\'re
on and attacking them with a Cargo Robot, a few attacks by
makeshift security robots, evacuating the Coputer Core, and finally
threatening the defrost their crewmates in a fatal way.  The computer
tries everything, but the trio the Virus woke up don\'t believe that
the Virus can kill their friends.  They blow the core, but not before the
Virus manages to fatally defrost a fifth of the 200ish frozen ones.

Then (much to my surprise) a spirited debate broke out about WHO owned the
ship.  The Aslan exec was willing to obey the Captain, as was the Vegan.
The Hivers contended that THEY owned the ship.  Then they tried to convince
the Captian that the Imperium was history, and that he could Captain the
ship for the Hive Federation. He didn\'t believe them. He convinces them that
his goal (exploration to see what remains if the Imperium) matches theirs.
They eventually arrive at a bargain (even though the Hivers didn\'t have
diplomatic access) where they Federation will repair the ship if 1) the
remnant crew shares their knowledge with the local Federation Technical
Schools and 2) they attach themselves to the Federation navy for four years.
They agree if 1) they can keep the ship and 2) be able to build a crew
to pilot the ship (about 400-700 people).  They later
find out that the ship will take at least two years to repair.  The
remnants are itching to go home, no matter how home might be now.
Serious denial ;-)

The next adventure was an exploration (on the long trip to the Hiver
Naval base after they had left the Bard) of the mystery of the little
girl, which I may detail later.

Here\'s the setup for the long campaign (once the ship is ready, I figure
3-4 episodes and four years from the first epsode):

Bard Refuge refitted, takes on self appointed mission to explore wilds.
Hivers also want them to deliver "Know Blocks" along the way, 400 one ton
volume self-contained computers which will progessivly dole out lost tech
know-how (and subtly encourage it\'s users to have a more Hiver-like approach).
Captain Drake has already agreed to return to Federation Space to report
his findings of the Wilds.

During the journey accross the wilds, they\'ll have to make contact with
planets, decide who is the most deserving, and leave them with the
know block.  They\'ll also encounter the usual and unusal wilds and
pocket empire hazards as they attempt to discover the state of the
destroyed Imperium.

The officer corps of the ship is drawn from the Remnants: Human, Dolphin,
Vegan, Aslan, with a smattering of other races.  The crew is green Federation
citizens, hoping to sharpen their skills in the wilds and return to the
Federation.

The PCs:

Capt. Mark Drake, native Terran but fiercely loyal to the Imperium... even
if his ship IS the Imperium. Skilled negotiator and Ship Tactician.
Think Capt. Kirk, but MUCH smarter and "not as goofy".  Also, only
"normal"  human PC.

Executive Officer Commander Kyatu (with much longer "real" Aslan name),
Aslan female, making the best of a bad situation, and trying to hold
together what she considers her Aslan Pride (in both senses).  Has come really
close to swatting:

Hiver Steve, Chief Science Officer. Explorer and owner aboard of the
Bard Refuge.  Trying to pull off the manipulation of a lifetime.
VERY blunt, preoccupied with other species interaction, especially
reproductive habits.  Too curious  ;-)

Ahkillyees, Troop Commander. Vegan Imperial Marine,
Special and Undercover Ops, and Privateer.  Shunned by other Vegans
(Social Level 0) because of uniformly loathed Tuhir (much like a open
Kali Cultist would be in Victorian Times).  One of very few Remnants
with extensive combat skills.

Kiki: Small human girl.  Raised by Droyne, seems to exhibit odd abilities.
She wants to stay with "shiney metal man" whom she\'s befriended.
Crew keeps her out of loyalty. Really!  I didn\'t force her on them.
Also secretly STRONGLY psionic.  Learned invisibility and other psi skills
from Droyne. Looking forward to casting later in life.
Convinced she\'s Droyne.  "They look different until the ceremony".  Also
priceless: before the players knew about the Droyne connection,
the Chief Medical Officer asked her (during an exam) to draw her parents
after she insisted she had wings. Seeing the drawing, the players
immediately assumed she had been raised by Star Spawn of Cthulhu. Sigh.

Robot Joe: Contact Assistant, nanny of Kiki. Star Patterns Trading
Human Interface Robot.  Humanoid, mostly man shaped, shiney. Actuallty
Virus.  Wants to spread kinder, gentler Virus through wilds (and to know
blocks).  Thinks Bard would be perfect ship to do it with.

Major NPCs:

Bob the Hiver.  Explorer, Pilot, Surveyor.  Advisor/Assistant to
Steve, owner aboard.

Tr!ikil!ilki: Cheif Medical Officer.  Dolphin, Patriot.  Secretly Psionic,
senses talent in Kiki, may try to bring it out later.

This is getting long, so I\'ll stop now.  One last note, though.  Capt.
Drake wants to change the name of the ship.  I suggested this was
against Naval Tradition, and he said: "Does everyone that this ship
has attacked [while it was a Virus] know it\'s name?" I suggested that
this might be a possibility, and then he said "Oh yeah, Andrea Doria,
that\'s a good name, let\'s keep it.  Or let\'s raise the Titanic, put
it back into service, and call it... hmmmm... the TITANIC!  That\'ll
inspire confidence in the people we meet..."

He wants to call it the "Resilient".  Robot Joe suggested "The Virus Free".

While I don\'t play Space 1889 (I was in the middle of a dry spell when
I first came across it, and I barely get to player Traveller these
days, let alone that weird stuff :-) I noticed that a local store is
clearing out their 1889 stock.  They have the rule book for $10, Ether
Flyers and whatever-it-was for $5, and the world atlas for $5.

This is Colpar Hobby shop in Denver, Colorado.  If somebody absolutely
must have these and they haven\'t found them elsewhere,etc, etc, drop
me a line, we\'ll figure out how to handle it.

Oh, the books seem to be in pretty decent condition.

Dragon Magazine ran an article on Black Holes in Traveller a LOOOOOONG
time ago (1981 or 82).  I may have a copy somewhere, but perhaps
the better organized members of the list may have that info at their
fingertips.

And speaking of old gaming material, I ran across a Sci-Fi/Fantasy
store in blighted Worchester, Mass. that had what was practically
an ARCHIVE of old game stuff.  They had THREE copies of Twilight\'s Peak,
really old issues of the Journal (I picked up the Hiver issue), and
evena copy of Asteriod, all at original cover price.

What\'s the catch?  They only take cash :-(

REALLY low numbers.

I found your mail pretty informing.  I\'m devising a damage system of my own

that I think it\'s a waste of time trying to devise a system based
 on the mechanisms related to the effect of one bullet inside one body).  I\'m
interested in knowing for specific weapons or weapon types what are the chances
that an average character has of dieing, receiving an incapacitating wound,
being knock down, etc when he is hit by a first bullet and second and so on.

Do you know where I can find this kind of information (I believe the army
has some statistics on this), preferably on the net?

Actually, it is optional.  The combat section clearly states that this rule
really shouldnt be used against PCs.  Sorry, whats good for the NPC is good for
the PC.

Mr. Wiseman states:

Okay: the chance of taking 10 9mm rounds in the chest and not being killed,
using average damge(3.5/shot) and quick kill rule:

	n=number of shots=10
	p=chance of success(not being killed)=19/20=.95
	Chance of surviving  n shots = p^n
		
	1st Shot	.95^1 = .95    Survival
	2nd             .95^2 = .9025
	3rd             .95^3 = .8573
	4th             .95^4 = .8145
	5th             .95^5 = .7738
	6th             .95^6 = .7351
	7th             .95^7 = .6983
	8th             .95^8 = .6634
	9th             .95^9 = .6302
	10th            .95^10 = .5987

Thats almost 60% chance of NOT being killed after taking 10 chest shots!
40% kill ratio after 10 rounds = not deadly.

Fix: roll d20<damage points rolled. (ie- 9mm hit, rolls 3 for damage,
Quick Kill on 3- on d20).
This would give (with an average of 3.5 pts dmg from a 9mm-
	p=16.5/20 = .825) survival chances of:

	1st shot  .825
	2nd       .6806
	3rd       .5615
	4th       .4633
	5th       .3822
	6th       .3153
	7th       .2601
	8th       .2146
	9th       .1770
	10th      .1461

This is better.  After 10 shots, youve got a 15% chance of surviving.

Now, using my Quick kill rule:
	For d10 damage: 			For d20 damage:
	Avg 9mm damage = 5.5pts                 Avg 9mm damage = 10.5
	quick kill on 5.5- on d20               quick kill of 10.5- on d20
	p=14.5/20 = .725  			p=9.5/20 = .475
	Shot	Survival Chances                Shot	Survival Chances

	1st 	.725                            1st     .475
	2nd 	.5256                           2nd     .2256
	3rd     .3811                           3rd     .1072

	8th     .0763                           8th     .0026
	9th     .0553                           9th     .0012
	10th	.0401                           10th    .0005
4% chance of surviving 10 9mm rounds to chest with d10s.
 .05% chance of surviving 10 9mm rounds to the chest with d20s.  I believe the
d20s are too deadly, even from a purly gaming viewpoint.

The d10s and my Quick kill rule is what I use in T:2K, along with removing
the END from hit point calculations.  For Head and chest: when dagage taken =>
capacity- shock, dies in END minutes unless serious medical help.  For other
locations:damage >= capactiy - broken bones, torn muscles, death in END*10
minutes unless first-aid; if successful, death in END hours unless real medical
help.  Also, Quick Kill = death in END comabt turns unless first aid, roll
DIFF:END to survive, if failed, death.  If successful, death in END hours
unless serious medical help.
As you see, even the Quick Kill rule gives a chance for survival, especially
with advanced technology.  Time = lives.
(This is NOT good, clean, fun.  Neither my T:2K universe nor my Traveller
universe is a movie.  (Besides, T:2K != Traveller, and never shall.)

Benifits:	No major rules changes, no super-heroic charcters,
		characters dont try to shoot thier way out of problems as much.
		Eliminates the I-calmly-let-him-shoot-me-in-the-chest-while-
		I-return-fire syndrome.
Drawbacks:	Deadlier than before.  Might actually force player to think
		instead of blowing others away.

Good point.  I realized that I don\'t really have anything to complain
about.  Last night I realized that GDW\'s sales of Classic Traveller
fell off when I went away to college, ie. it is all my fault.  :-)

I never quite got arount to buying MT until just before TNE was
published.  I made up for it by buying 3 copies of everything put out
for Space: 1889.  :-)

I guess this issue can go away from the TML.  Now to work out the

The question really should be

Why did the Hivers bring about the collapse of all of their
large interstellar neighbors (especially those pesky humans!)?

I\'m certain that their friends the K\'kree didn\'t escape from
Virus.  In any case,

Problem: Our neighbors are a violent, anti-social bunch, constantly
warring on each other.  How can we change this? Two schools of
thought would emerge (much like they have in the business world of
today).  The first approach emphasizes slow, constant improvement/manipulation
(the TQM of today).  The second approach deals with doing away with
the current system and rebuilding it from a fresh perspective (re-engineering).

The Hive sponsoring the second approach won.  The Hivers counted on being the
only survivors of the Virus, having a ready made friendly Virus to combat it,
and figured everyone else would slip back into larvae-hood, and be tested
by the Wilds (hmmmm... interesting that THAT is what it\'s called).  The
collateral damage to the Federation was an accident: the friendly virus
wasn\'t distributed quickly enough.

They probably wanted to take everybody out, but didn\'t know about those
pesky secret x-boat routes that saved the sentients to spinward.

Now that the larvae are returning from the Wilds, the Hivers are setting
out to educate and train them: Humaniti is now a child being adopted by
the nest, in this case the Federation Development Agency.

Not subtle enough for Hivers?  Sure it is: everybody thinks the humans did it
to themselves.

That\'s why ;-b

Did I get it right, James?

Re: Terra and the Virus
Somewhere in the TNE book it says that civilizations with knowledge in
hard copy form (ie libraries) were able to rebuild using Vaccuum Tubes
and other alternative technologies that were tried but discarded.  Thus,
the older worlds (Terra and Vland, at least, Muan Gwi (sp?) in my campaign)
were able to rebuild from their ancient off-line libraries.

I would think Terra was hit pretty hard (TL 15), but managed to rebuild
due to it\'s rich atmosphere and carefully preserved soil.  I\'m sure
Billions died, but the Terrans managed to drag themselves out. In my
campaign they\'re the heart of a pocket empire similar to the one
they had during the Long Night.  Remember, Terra wasn\'t ripped up
like many Imperial worlds by the Rebellion: the Solomani ran right over \'em.

It would be an interesting place, where many technologies that had fallen
by the wayside (mechanical computers, fluidics, LTA craft, etc) were
now thriving...

Re: Terra and the Reformation Coalition
Not in 1200.  Too far away.  In 1200 the RC is pretty small, apparently
confined to a few subsectors (I think... see TNE for detail).  I would think
the Terrans would resist being absorbed by another huge empire, although
they might try to take it over...

Re: Terra: who\'s in charge?
The Solomani were pretty early on in the Rebellion.  I would imagine they
were in control when the Virus hit... after that, who knows?

In the Traveller\'s Digest, DGP did a pretty spiffy write up on Terra around
1105ish.  I don\'t remember what issue that was, though.

After my massive posts to this lists, you\'ll all be spared of my
opinions/ideas for a couple of weeks -- I\'m going to New Orleans for a
vacation...

  Well, I again have some questions...:)

  1) Have the stats for Vegans ever been detailed?

  and 2) This question may involve adventure secrets, so
players perhaps should not see the answer. But I was wondering
if GDW has (or has plans to) detailed the following people or
concepts: Pentecost, Longbow, Jumpstart, and the boy Avery. All
of these people or things are mentioned in Survival Margin and/or
Arrival Vengence. Simple explanations for Longbow and Jumpstart
are given...but I suspect there is more to them....any info?

  Just curious... :)

Hello, and welcome to the Traveller Mailing List.

Please read this whole (8-page) document thoroughly (You\'ll only need
to read it once), and then make a hard copy of it and keep it for
future reference.  It *should* contain everything you need to start
using (as opposed to abusing :-) the Traveller Mailing List.

SUBSCRIBERSHIP

This all started June 16, 1987 with a posting to USENET, and we have
grown to 413 member addresses, and has outgrown GEnie as the largest
electronic repository and discussion of things related to Traveller. As
long as I am co-ordinating this list, membership will be open to
everyone for free (it\'s my personal labor of love for the game of
"Traveller").

The membership seems to be very diverse, and well distributed over the
continent of North America and sites in the UK, Scandanavia, Australia,
South America, Asia, and the low countries of Europe. In the addresses I
see all kinds of sites: defense contractors, electronics manufacturers,
publishers, universities, and homebrew USENET sites. GDW, HIWG, and
several other organizations monitor happenings on the TML.

The people that read the list are mostly players and referees of
Traveller. Some of them currently play Traveller but most have played it
at some time or are planning to play Traveller. Many have never looked
at a Traveller rulebook and play other role-playing games, and some are
just interested in science fiction or technology projections in general.

It is my sincere wish that we get the largest possible membership on
this list (the more the merrier), so feel free to tell others about it
that could be interested and have E-mail access.  However, since I
cannot be responsible for any transmission charges, the membership is
restricted to those sites which shoulder their own burden of
transmission costs.

This list is included in the USENET list-of-lists, which appears
periodically in the news.lists newsgroup.  It is also mentioned in the
FAQ for the rec.games.frp newsgroup.

DESCRIPTION OF THE LIST

This list exists to discuss Game Designer\'s Workshop\'s TRAVELLER Science
Fiction Role Playing System (what a mouthful), including all derivative
games and rulesets (Traveller: The New Era, Traveller 2300,
MegaTraveller, Classic Traveller, Striker, Azhanti High Lightning, etc).
Discussion is intended to be unlimited and to people with a broad base
of familiarity with Traveller. Subscribers can exchange programs, news
bulletins, new "rules", war stories, questions at any level of
expertise, answers, etc; or just listen.

Also there are a number of you out there (you know who you are), who are
interested primarily in other gaming systems, but want to transfer
concepts embodied in Traveller to other systems. For reasons listed
below (see CONTENT), lengthy non-Traveller messages are discouraged.

A VERY BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO TRAVELLER

For those of you completely unfamiliar with Traveller, a short
explanation is in order.  Traveller is a set of rules for a Role Playing
Game.  Another common Role-Playing Game of wide familiarity is Dungeon &
Dragons by TSR, in which players attempt to guide fictional people (like
characters in a book) through a plot and setting set up by a person
designated to provide most of the setting and arbitrate the results of
player actions (the Dungeon Master, or DM).  What makes Traveller
different from Dungeons and Dragons is that instead of being set in a
medieval/magical/fantasy setting, it is set in a futuristic,
technological society of Interstellar Government and Commerce.  This is
the primary distinction, as both "games" exist to provide the basic
framework and rules by which each world operates.

An illustration: Dungeon & Dragons could provide the background for a
storyline such as any of the "Sinbad", "Conan", "Lord of the Rings",
"Eternal Champion" or other medieval/fantasy stories (to name a few),
while Traveller provides an excellent framework for stories similar to
"Alien", "Star Wars", and to a lesser extent "Dune".  Unfortunately for
you buffs interested exclusively in "Star Trek", Traveller in general
doesn\'t mesh well with arbitrating that sort of science fiction (but
other gaming systems exist just for this purpose).

Most TML members agree that Traveller\'s biggest plus is the rich
history, technology, and aliens background provided in numerous
supplements. Many other enjoy the creative aspects of the ship design,
world generation, and trade systems. Most agree that the three major
ruleset revisions (Traveller "Classic", MegaTraveller, and the latest,
Traveller: The New Era) are bespotted with conflicts and blatant
revisionism, but when it comes right down to it, rules are guidelines
and usually don\'t get in the way of good clean fun.

For more information on Traveller, you should look in your Yellow Pages
for the most sophisticated gaming/hobbyist shop in a nearby metropolitan
area, and drop in. Examine the Traveller: TNE ruleset, and supplementary
materials published for Traveller. Other sources of up-to-date Traveller
information can be found in "Challenge" magazine (a publication of Game
Designers\' Workshop), and "The MegaTraveller Journal" magazine
(publication of Digest Group Publications, alas, this excellent source
stopped publication at issue 4); there are fanzines you can ask about on
the TML - the ones I am aware of are the HIWG newsletter and Tiffany
Star; other magazines targeted at Science Fiction gaming may have a
small amount of Traveller-related material, but Challenge has a large
circulation and hence, availability. Naturally, members of this list
will be happy to answer any questions you have, too.

SENDING ARTICLES TO THE LIST

For those of you unfamiliar as to what a mailing list is, it is simply
an electronic mail "mailbox" on a UNIX host computer.  Any mail sent to
that mailbox at that host computer is automatically resent to everyone
in the list.  These mailing list mailboxes are also called "aliases".

There are two mailboxes which exist for this list.  The first is the
address to send any requests to add or delete a subscription, inform me
that your account is moving, request archives of old messages, offer
suggestions as to how the list itself is run, or just chat with me (the
list owner).  All mail sent to this mailbox will be sent only to me.
Most of you have used this mailbox to request that you be added to the
list.  Here is the "REQUEST" mailbox:

	traveller-request@engrg.uwo.ca

All mail sent to "traveller-request" will be assumed private unless
explicitly stated otherwise: I will make a strong effort at keeping
traveller-request correspondence confidential.  However, expect that
your name, city, state (or country), and electronic mail address will be
available to other members of the Traveller list.

The second mailbox broadcasts all mail it receives to everybody on the
mailing list, including you.  This is somewhat similar to posting an
article to USENET, and so the usual posting suggestions exist: do not
flame (send those via direct mail), and be reasonably brief (this means
if there is a lot to say, go ahead and say it; but if there is little to
say, don\'t ramble).  Here is the "BROADCAST" mailbox:

	traveller@engrg.uwo.ca

When you send a submission to the broadcast mailbox, you will recieve
an automated reply indicating that your mail has been recieved.

Please follow these format rules when sending a message to the list:

	1. Use only standard printing ascii characters: alphanumerics,
	   punctuation and special characters (#!|, etc.) are okay.
	   No "control codes" except CR (^M), LF/NL (^J), FF (^L), or
	   TAB (^I), please.  [Reason: mailers sometimes reject messages
	   with unusual characters or control sequences in them.  This
	   means my personal mailbox gets filled up by scores of
	   undeliverable mail messages.]

	2. Please limit line length to 80 characters or less (78 or less
	   if possible).  [Reason: Many people are stuck with standard
	   24 line by 80 column terminals, or worse.]

The addresses on the list are as brief and as simple as I can keep them,
Internet addresses if possible, so that the UWO mailing system can
choose the quickest route for each message. Since the mail is in effect
resent by my host, as long as you can reach the list here at
engrg.uwo.ca your host, then you can reach everybody on the list,
regardless of the mailer domain they are in.

WATCH THOSE CC:\'S AND YOUR OTHER AUTOMATIC MAILER SERVICES

If you reply to a Traveller Mailing List article you have received, and
let your mail program automatically choose the address to reply to,
chances are you won\'t reply to traveller (the broadcast address);
instead, most mailers will choose traveller-request or jamesp to send
the mail back.  That means that I am the only person who will probably
get your message, and then I will have to guess that you meant to send
it to the list, and forward it myself.  Adding a human (me) into the
process is sure to degrade the service :-). In fact, I\'ve set it up this
way to avoid accidental broadcast -- I want people to post with
real conviction, forethought and malice. :-)

So I ask you, when responding to any article received via the list, look
carefully at who is going to receive it before letting your mailer send
it.  It wouldn\'t do to have a private response automatically and
carelessly sent to the whole list! Conversely, if you wanted the mail to
go out to the whole list, make sure that you use the traveller address.

WHAT TO DO IF MAIL HICCUPS (AFTER SENDING TO THE MAILING LIST)

Occasionally you may get a copy of your message regurgitated to you,
with strange messages such as "user unknown" or "host unknown", or
"message not delivered in 3 days".  If this occurs, PLEASE FORWARD A
COPY OF THE ENTIRE MESSAGE TO traveller-request, so that I can attempt
to determine why the address is bad, and if necessary remove the address
from the list.

Most mail failures are sent back to me, instead of to the originator, so
I can remove addressees from the list that continually cause delivery
failure.  Yes, if I can no longer send mail to you for some reason or
another (I keep getting returned and failed mail), I will after several
failures regretfully remove your name from the list.  PLEASE KEEP ME
INFORMED OF CHANGES IN ADDRESS and account termination, so I\'ll not be
so overwhelmed in maintaining failures and can do a more quality job.

TRAFFIC AND DELIVERY STYLE

The list averages about seventy messages every month, and the average
message usually tends to be about 2-3 pages (66 lines == 1 page) in
length.  The list has been known to hit 230 messages in one month,
though!

A feature of the mailing list instituted in May 1989 gives each member
their choice of delivery styles:

Instant: Instant delivery means that you recieve each individual message
	sent to the list, as quickly as possible, in your mailbox.
	INSTANT DELIVERY IS NO LONGER ALLOWED, as it places too great a
	load on the mail network.

Nightly Digest: This means that you receive bunches of messages sent
	to the list, compacted into a single message, in your mailbox.
	The software sends out a single digest nightly at 8:30pm, or
	multiple digests if traffic warrants it.

Biweekly Digest: This means that you receive bunches of messages sent
	to the list, compacted into a single message, in your mailbox.
	The software sends out a single digest Wednesdays and Sundays at
	9:00pm, or multiple digests if traffic warrants it.

Bundle Subscription: This means that you receive the archive bundles,
	whenever there is 45K worth of accumulated traffic since the
	last bundle was sent, compacted into a single message, in your
	mailbox.  The software sends out a single bundle on an
	infrequent basis, usually 1-2 weeks apart.

If you want a particular form of delivery, or want to chage your current
form, just contact traveller-request and I will set you up.  The default
form of delivery is NIGHTLY DIGEST.

CONTENT

A word on content is in order. I try to run the TML as a free and
blisteringly open discussion service. I am generally very tolerant of
opinions expressed, even though I may not personally agree with the
originator. I will tolerate general criticism, critique, poor reviews,
and even occasional fits of frustration. However, I will NOT tolerate
direct attacks on another member\'s integrity.

If you feel someone has unfairly attacked your person, don\'t respond to
the TML broadcast address. Please let me know. It will result in
discussion between the parties, and at my discretion may result in
disciplinary action. Only one severe case has arised, when one member
described another in an obscene and degrading manner on the open forum.

As far as critique or frustration leveled at a company or it\'s products,
it is generally tolerated on the TML. Most people who emit such
commentary are striving to share their opinions as a customer of the
product, and I believe that as long as it is even partially constructive
commentary, that it is acceptable for posting.

It\'s okay to discuss other game systems at length on the TML if they are
discussed in a Traveller-related manner (example: comparison/contrast).
However, long non-Traveller messages are expensive for those who pay for
TML mail delivery byte-by-byte, so if it\'s not related to Traveller,
keep it to a short announcement of an offline discussion.

Above all, think about the other 400+ members of the TML before you
post. And if you see something that really gets your goat, cool off
before responding, and send me a message before responding if you think
it\'s appropriate.

TOPIC COORDINATORS

There are also more special addresses to send items to the mailing list.
This is because people wanted to start "special interest groups" for
certain topics:

Traveller EPBM Referee: pbemref@engrg.uwo.ca (Mark Cook and metlay)
	Richard Johnson began refereeing a Traveller Electronic
	Play-by-Mail game, where players are crewmembers aboard the ISR
	Alcyon, on a mission to research a newly-discovered Ringworld.
	Mark Cook and metlay took it over. They periodically keep the
	TML at large informed of game happenings. There are a whole
	family of mailing-list style aliases at the engrg.uwo.ca site,
	to aid characters in routing PBEM mail - for details, contact
	pbemref. Note that the engrg.uwo.ca address actually forwards
	mail to their real mailboxes: markc@hpcvss.cv.hp.com, and
	metlay@netcom.com.

Compter-Aided Traveller "CAT": richard@agora.rain.com (Richard Johnson)
			       dan@engrg.uwo.ca (Dan Corrin)
	CAT members discuss how computers can be used as RPG aids in
	playing Traveller, including automated character & star system
	generation.  This list is distinct and mostly seperate from the
	TML.  Please mail to BOTH addresses to be added, as Richard is
	topic coordinator and Dan maintains a redistribution mail alias,
	cat@engrg.uwo.ca.

Traveller Done Right "TDR": tdr_admin@hpcvss.cv.hp.com (metlay & Mark F Cook)
	THIS LIST IS CURRENTLY INACTIVE - ALL DISCUSSION SHOULD ACTUALLY
	BE SENT TO THE TML (traveller@engrg.uwo.ca).  Mark and
	metlay maintain several mailing lists dedicated to replacing and
	enchancing portions of the MegaTraveller rules.  Contact this
	address if and only if you are truly committed to spending large
	tracts of time discussing rule shortcomings and actually
	producing enhancements.  Metlay sends out occasional status
	reports to the TML at large.

2300AD: ftavares@ptearn.fc.ul.pt (Pedro A C Tavares)
	Pedro is interested in keeping those with interest in 2300
	together, and reports to the TML occasionally if there\'s any
	interesting material. Write him if you\'re especially interested
	in 2300.

TNE-Pocket: tne-pocket-request@ocf.berkeley.edu (George Herbert)
	George and Guy Garnett (aka Derek Wildstar) have a working group
	to flesh out the history of the "Aoreriyya Region of Reavers\'
	Deep Sector". This is quasi-official work sanctioned by HIWG and
	GDW. Members of this list are expected to contribute regularly,
	and periodic reports of goings-on are posted to the TML.

Space 1889: space-1889-request@mit.edu (Matt Goodman)
	Matt has started a mail list to discuss GDW\'s Space 1889 game,
	which is unrelated to Traveller, but as it\'s a GDW game, it\'s of
	interest to several TMLers.

If you cannot reach these people, send the mail to traveller-request and
I will gladly manually forward mail to them.

HOW TO GET OLD ARTICLES AND SHAREWARE

There\'s some starship designs, programs for world generation and trade
and others, official MegaTraveller Errata, and official Imperium sector
data as posted to GEnie by Digest Group (and much, much, more)! The
whole archives are on the order of 45 MEGABYTES in size.

The primary TML archive site is uwo.ca (or more correctly,
ftp.engrg.uwo.ca, 129.100.100.12, directory pub/traveller). There are
several additional special-interest sites listed in another document
that I can send you.

				---- What\'s there ----
	Site		Method	Buns	Pkgs	Soft	Shps
	----	----	----	----	----	----
	uwo.ca		ftp	all	all	some*	some
	traveller-request
			email	all*	all*	none	none
			disk	all	all	none	none

There are different ways to request archive information, depending on
the site you get the archives from.  \'ftp\' indicates anonyomous ftp
online file transfer.  \'email\' indicates reponse and data via email.
\'disk\' indicates 3.5" DSHD MSDOS floppies delivered by the postal
service.

Also depending on the site, there are different materials available.
\'Buns\' indicates the TML message traffic, about 20 megabytes in size.
\'Pkgs\' indicates "Packages" of collected information: errata, software,
official sector data, and starship designs.  \'Soft\' indicates additional
gaming aid software, beyond that available in the Packages.  \'Shps\'
indicates starship designs, beyond that available in the Packages.  The
asterisks \'*\' indicate which site is likely to be most up-to-date for a
particular type of material.

For specific details on retrieving this information and what the exact
site addresses are, mail traveller-request@engrg.uwo.ca and ask for the
"How to Get Archives" document.

TRAVELLER SERVICES

Vehicle Design Keeper: robdean@digex.com (Rob Dean) or
			rsdean@apgea.army.mil (Robert Dean)
	Rob has a huge collection of vehicle designs for use with
	MegaTraveller.  Send mail to Rob if you\'d like him to send them
	out to you, or better yet, ask traveller-request to direct you
	to the FTP site where they are available.

A WORD ON MANNERS AND LIST OWNERSHIP

I know that everyone on the list is pleasant and excited in Traveller
and will use the list for sharing all the things that make Traveller
exciting, but....

There is no room on this mailing list for people who would destroy the
fun the rest of us are having.  If anyone on the list habitually resorts
to abusive language, misuses the list, or I receive numerous complaints
about them (sent to traveller-request), I will warn them by direct mail.
If the situation cannot be resolved, I will remove them from the mailing
list.  All attempts at fairness and understanding will be attempted.

Furthermore, the existence of this list and the cost for it\'s
administration and existence is supported by The University of Western
Ontario, the site administrator (Dan Corrin) and the list administrator
(James Perkins, me).  The fact that anyone is on it at all is because
we want you here to listen and to share.  If at any time we perceive a
need to discontinue the list for personal or employer\'s reasons, or
discontinue any individual\'s participation in the list, I must reserve
that right with no questions asked.  Sorry.

Also, the University of Western Ontario is not responsible for the
traffic that flows through the list.  All traffic is the responsibility
of the originators.

I\'d be willing to bet that is wasn\'t a single manipulation that brought down
the Imperium, but a careful combination of manipulation screw ups. The
Imperium killed itself, certainly, and I\'m sure the Hiver\'s didn\'t plan it
to all fall the way it did, because they lost too, even if they\'re gaining
big now. If they did anything they encouraged Imperial Paranoia, and helped
break down the ruling structure and the dream versus the reality of the
Imperium.

  Comets, and Oort Clouds, where they reside, might be good
  candidates for fuel caches, provided you\'re equipped to mine
  them.  In fact, as I recall, in the Arrival Vengeance campaign,
  Strephon gives the AV the location of a fuel cache that is just
  that - a cold comet.  Using this cache, the AV was able to go
  directly from Usdiki back to the Domain, without having to go
  through the Ziru Sirkaa or Vargr-occupied Corridor.

  Pulsars would almost certainly be used as navigational beacons.
  I seem to recall that pulsar characteristics are almost as
  individualized as those of Cepheid variable stars, and by
  locating and identifying three pulsars, you could pinpoint your
  location adequately for most interstellar travelling purposes.

  I can\'t envision a use for either neutron stars or nebulae, but
  they can certainly be used as navigational hazards.  Nebulae
  might be so diffuse, though, as to be of sightseeing interest
  only, if that.  Much like the Aurorae on Earth.  Black holes are
  either subjects of scientific study, or navigation hazards.  Very
  severe ones.

  I would say that if you\'re rash enough to come close enough to a
  black hole that you have to worry about this, you deserve
  whatever happens.  As far as I\'m concerned, you\'re dead when the
  acceleration due to the black hole\'s gravity exceeds the maximum
  thrust your ship can put out.  Of course, if you have a head for
  figures, or don\'t mind yanking out the physics books and playing
  techweenie, you can always play games with high-speed (meaning
  high-momentum) hyperbolic orbits and the like.  I know that there
  are formulae for the "diameter" of a black hole, based on the
  mass.  What this really is, is the diameter of a normal sphere
  whose surface is coincident with the event horizon of the black
  hole.  If you cross that, you\'re dead.  Even a slingshot orbit
  can\'t save you.

from Terran "anti-psionic" stock.  I do not believe that this is
necessarily true.

Anti-psionics feelings in the Imperium only started in a big way during
the Psionics Suppressions of 800 to 826, due to the failed
psychohistory project.  The Sword Worlds settlements began during the
Long Night, well before this date.  In the absence of official
information to the contrary, and given the tensions that have always
existed between the Sword Worlds and the Imperium, I would think that a
referee could rule either way on whether or not the Sword Worlders were
affected by the pychohistory project.

It is true that psionics only became prominent during the Long Night,
and it could be suggested that the Sworld Worlders left before the
discoveries were made.  However, I would think that this would be
counterbalanced by the alliance with the Zhodani (as Matt points out).

So the Sword Worlds could easily be pro-psionics.  Perhaps this is
another reason why the Sword Worlders and the Imperium have never got
along.

Personally, I think that that psionics just isn\'t Sworld Worlder style.
They seem to be tough, martial folk, where cerebral types and
"Sensitive New Age Guys" interested in wimpy psionics get drafted into
the Army to be made into "Men", and proud of it! :-)

Hi all: I have make a empty message eariler, please ommited it, below is
the actual message:

I have just aquire a copy of the (old, 1983) Traveller starter edition.
Since I haven\'t played traveller before (In my whole 14 years of
RPGing). I find it very interesting (It do expend my imagination). But
find a few questions on the game.

1) Do that game have experience and growth on characters?? I could find
that on the rules...

2) Is there still alot of people playing it??

3) How is it compared to Traveller a new Era, somebody say that
MegaTraveller is not good, and Traveller is a classic, I believe it so.
And after reading it, it is a very good system, I like all the formulars
in it, which is logical (as a CS master student) and I like that stuff.

4) How to find more information on the (old) Traveller game??

Please will anybody which is a Traveller Fan give me some hints and
answers....

Thanks.

Subject: Those Sneaky Hivers, and Whether Thee Terra

>I\'m certain that their friends the K\'kree didn\'t escape from
>Virus.  In any case,

Problem: Our neighbors are a violent, anti-social bunch, constantly
warring on each other.  How can we change this? Two schools of
thought would emerge (much like they have in the business world of
today).  The first approach emphasizes slow, constant improvement/manipulation
(the TQM of today).  The second approach deals with doing away with
the current system and rebuilding it from a fresh perspective (re-engineering).

The Hive sponsoring the second approach won.  The Hivers counted on being the
only survivors of the Virus, having a ready made friendly Virus to combat it,
and figured everyone else would slip back into larvae-hood, and be tested
by the Wilds (hmmmm... interesting that THAT is what it\'s called).  The
collateral damage to the Federation was an accident: the friendly virus
wasn\'t distributed quickly enough.

They probably wanted to take everybody out, but didn\'t know about those
pesky secret x-boat routes that saved the sentients to spinward.

Now that the larvae are returning from the Wilds, the Hivers are setting
out to educate and train them: Humaniti is now a child being adopted by
the nest, in this case the Federation Development Agency.

Did I get it right, James?


	I dunno, your explanation seems to easy, and any human who
stopped to think in the RCES could think of it.  I have a feeling that
the collapse of the Imperium, and subsequent rebuilding has far greater
reasoning behind it than simply making for more peaceful space.

	Personnally the Hivers looked out over the neighbouring 10,000
worlds and saw an empire that was stagnant.  It was against AI &
Robotics (cybernetic alteration of humaniti), it was against PSI (one
form of human development) and avoided geneering to a large extent.  The
only neighbours that were interested in geneering in the immediate
vicinity (the Solomani) were a relatively fascist race seeking to
subjucate most neighbouring races.

	The quickest solution to instigate change, and an advancement
for the galaxy was to dissolve imperium.  They probably began the
program after the Psionic oppressions, possibly in about 650 ish.  Were
transponders in effect at this time, or was it a brilliant idea that
someone had :).

	I think the Hivers have succeeded very well.  They have created
an environment which will encourage natural selection, ie in harsher
environments only the really tough will survive.  Consider an orbital
city which relies of Psionics to aid in its operation, this has resulted
in a virus induced catharsis of the population.  The last vestiges of
the Imperium, ie Regency, are now pro-psionic.  Is this all to much a
mere coincedence.

	
	This is just a personal concept put forward, I am unsure how the
feeling of \'That Alien Conspiracy\' would go down.  It is possibly not
suited to the TNE universe, but it does give some food for thought.

find a few questions on the game.

Book 2 pg.40 Experience and Self-improvement

Probably not.

MegaTraveller is not good, and Traveller is a classic, I believe it so.
And after reading it, it is a very good system, I like all the formulas
in it, which is logical (as a CS master student) and I like that stuff.

MegaTraveller took classic traveller and many of the supplement books and
condensed them.  They also smoothed out several rough spots in the rules as
well, while adding more realitic mechanics.  IMO they did an exelent job at
that.  MT is a step above classic traveller, and all the old adventures are
playable under those rules.  The thing I didn\'t like about MT is its
background with the "Shattered Imperium".  As a "old" Traveller fan I much
prefered the corrupt "old imperium".  I just ignored all the new background
material and played MT set in the old background.  Then they went and redid
the whole system and spawned Traveller TNE.  This IMO is a complete
abandonment of classic traveller.  They completely scrapped the background as
well as the mechanics.  Now none of the old supplements apply, and the new
adventures are wholy unlike anything that *I* associate with true Traveller.
Perhaps it\'s just hard to teach old dogs new tricks, but i\'m not the only old
salt that was very upset with TNE.

4) How to find more information on the (old) Traveller game??

	Earth probably weathered the Collapse and the Virus better than just
about any other world.  Consider:  Earth is the only planet in the Galaxy
where humans can survive with absolutely NO artificial help.  Even Vland had
to have that weird food-preparation guild to make the plant life edible.  On
Earth you can eat stuff right out of the ground.  With primitive TL 6-7
agriculture, it can support five billion people.
	And Earth has an incredible amount of low-tech infrastructure already
in place.  Surface railroads dating back thousands of years; vast highway
systems for groundcar traffic; alternating-current power grids; copper-cable
voice phone networks.  By way of illustration, the city of Rome in the 1990s
still uses some of the aqueducts built by the Roman Empire, and in New Mexico
farmers still use irrigation systems built before Columbus reached the New
World.
	Quite a lot of obsolete technology would still exist in historical
preserves, since history/tourism was probably a big industry on Terra before
the Collapse.  The facilities at places like the Krupp Steel Museum, or
Silicon Valley National Park, or the Baikonur Cosmodrome Living History Center
would be very useful when all the high-tech gadgetry goes blooey.
	Terra\'s location is also a bonus.  All of the Solomani worlds would be
separated from the Virus by a belt of devastated systems where the Sols and the
Imperium were fighting.  The Solomani planets may have had some advance warning
of the Virus, and could take steps to protect themselves from its worst
effects -- no grav city crashes, or fusion power plant explosions, or planetary
defense weapons going berserk.
	It\'s quite likely that Terra is the capital of a rather large Pocket
Empire, possibly claiming to be the one-and-only Solomani Confederation. Their
attitudes would be interesting; one might imagine a "back to the soil"
movement railing against high technology.  Since the Solomani were always into
biotechnology and genetic engineering, they might use lots of biotech-based
equipment in place of computers.

	Part of my motivation for doing the Sysgen software was so
that I could have a 3D universe without losing all that detail on
those maps. I\'ve been running Traveller in a 3D universe (off an on)
for about 4 years now. I thought I might make a few observations.

	_Space is big_ Really big. A small 10x10x10 parsec cube,
what I had envisaged as a sub-sector, is really only comprable with
a sector. Simple maths shows there are 1280 hexes in your standard
2D 32x40 sector and 1000 in a 10x10x10 cube. In all that gaming they
have never left that area.
	Yes, _borders are close_. If you are sitting in the centre
of a 2D sector you have to jump at least 16 parsecs to get out of
the sector. Yet, in a 3D "sector" you are only 5 parsecs from the
border. A jump-6 ship would make it to the edge.
	_There is much more choice_ In a 2D universe the standard
Jump-2 freighter has a choice of 18 destinations. In a 3D universe
this leaps to 32. Jump-1 remains at 6, but Jump-3 and higher escalate
surprisingly. So when you are selecting profitable points you have
more to choose from.
	_Almost anywhere is just a few jumps away_ Because of the above
the number of planets within a few jumps is very, very, large. My players
wanted to find a tech level 10, Starport A world that was likely to
have bulk freighters in standard production. Calling on my program it
produced 27 systems within a 4 parsec radius cube!
	_Navigation isn\'t that bad_ The most common objection I have
heard is that it is difficult to think in 3D and mapping is a bitch.
Once we had done out a little cubic diagram of what range their ship
had the players had no problem at all working out where they could
jump. To my annoyance they never use the on-line computer map I wrote
for them but are quite happy with their 5 page printout of the sector.

	We don\'t do normal ship movement in 3D. In fact, being largly
a trader type campaign we don\'t do ship movement much at all.
	I don\'t know how a 3D universe might be on a strateigic level.
It would be *really* interesting to see a TCS game run in a 3D space.
Any takers?

Please post the information.  I want to use TNE and run Belt
Strike, and that info. would help me a lot.

Just a few question:

Did you run the Hard Times and the virus on the Belt?
What about CT - to TNE tasks.. How did you change it?..

Doing Traveller in 3D sounds attractive until you have to work
out some mechanics for it... then your brain starts to hurt.

You _can_ do it; I\'m doing it right now for an alternate
setting I\'m toying with, though I may give up in the end
and abstract things quite a bit.  One problem is that to
map out a subsector-sized chunk, you need to use the
sector-sized map squares, which hurts after a little while.
They\'re hard to read and work with, and harder to draw in
the useful info (base, starport, GG presence, etc).
It also is hard to fit a whole "subsector" (being defined
as roughly the boundaries of one jump radius) on one
piece of paper in any case.  This really hurts more than
the small squares do; you lose the forest for the trees
in your flurry of pages of map.

This is one of the places where realism may not be a good
idea... it usually slows down managing the game without
introducing that much more advantage in the gaming situation.
I usually avoid such complications barring really good reason
to keep it that way.

2 research stations have been destroyed by "something" and that this "some-
thing" would arrive at Core (I belive) in 90 years (2 years after the start
of the new era.) Later in the book, In Norris\' reply to Strephon, he thanks him
for the Jumpstart codes and info on Longbow. Then he states "forewarned is
forarmed" He also wonders if the Zho\'s (i just can\'t bring myself to like
them, guess after fighting them all those years...) have something to do with
this threat, or are just victims also. Based on this and the fact that Longbow
was a long distance commo device it seems that this project rang the doorbell
of somebody/thing that had best not been disturbed and now its coming. I also
think that the Zho core expeditions might have already run into this.

Of course I could just be incredibly paranoid since in an Old CT campaign we
spent alot of time fighting the big C and his minions that would not die (
well, the little ones die when you hit them with enough FGMP-15s:)

	"One minor bitch I\'ve always had about Traveller (Classic,
Mega or New Era) what that space is two-dimensional. You can lay out
the map of the Spinward Marches flat on your table. They don\'t
even try to rationalise it anywhere. (The best rationalisation I\'ve
heard is that the 2D map represents what is close to what in jump-space
and does not necessarily relate to real-space)"

First of all, I agree completely, space IS Three-dimensional, and a game like
traveller which seems at times to jump through hoops to make its rules
conform to "reality" should really treat this subject likewise.

I remember reading somewhere (sorry no ref, I\'m at work and refs are at home)
that part of the reasoning behind the two-d maps is that although space is
not flat, the galaxy, to some extent, is.  This argument falls apart rather
quickly when you start looking at a 3-D map of our nearest neighboring stars.

Doesn\'t Traveller 2300 use a 3D representation?  As I recall it puts each star
on a sort of \'Z coordinate scale\' so that each star depicted on a flat map is
either small, medium, or large depending on how \'close\' to the viewer it is.
That gives at least some third dimension, doesn\'t it?

My objection to using three-d star maps is that (without having tried it yet)
it seems like many of the historical facts of the traveller universe would need
to be reinterpreted.  If, as Jo says, everything is closer together in terms
of flight time, the length of time for news, cultural influence, disease
(the Virus?) reaching other, further planets is greatly reduced.  The likelyhood
 of there being a substantial rift (like that dividing the Domain of Deneb from
 the rest of the imperium) would decrease drastically.
(GM-"you come to a great rift."
PLAYER-"ok, we go over it!"
GM- "uh, oh, ok." [so much for my quest for a jump-5 ship])

I am, of course, oversimplifying.  But I\'d like to hear about the effects on
Imperial politics (or anyone elses politics for that matter) and history before
adopting a three-dimensional universe (besides, what do I do with all these
blank subsector maps?).

    'body' => 'A project I am just beginning came about as a result of doing an extended
world generation of Glisten.

As you\'all probably know, Glisten is an asteroid belt.  I assumed that the
large population would be distributed in many small habitats around the belt
(miners, shipbuilders being the main occupants)  The dice did not favor my
guess however and I rolled that there was one large city (9 billion people!)
with most of the system\'s pop in it.

Not being one to cheat the gods I began to devise an outer space habitat to
house this vast number of people (with some provision for their children, as
 well).

I envision a huge, disk-shaped habitat.  Spinning very slowly (physics doesn\'t
allow it not to spin, but I want grav generators to do most of the work of
making the inside 1G).  Habitation areas would be modulular and arrayed around
the disk, oriented so that \'up\' is toward the center of the disk (dont want to
fight w/centrifugal(sp?) force).

At the center of the disk are several immense structures (oriented
perpendicular to the disk) housing the industrial base of the system; metal
refineries and shipyards.  Several large corporations compete here in both
industries, as well as pharmaceutical mfgrng, a thriving health service ind.
("live out your remaining days in zero-G comfort") etc. (I would love help with
the \'etc\').

The modular habtats are shaped like an arc.  Size depends on how close to the
center the section is, but generally hold about 8 million people each (this will
bring things into scale; 8 million is the size of greater Chicago, I need about
71 of these modules to match the pop. assuming all mods of roughly equal size).

Each module is really a habitat unto itself.  I envision the inside to resemble
a long, green valley with steep sides.  People live everywhere, but the upper
class live high up the cliffs and along the thickly vegitated valley (providing
food and air recycling in a closed system), while middle and lower class live
"underground" in the areas away from the valley.

To give you an idea of what I\'m talking about; One habitat
would be a slightly curved cube.  An area has been "scooped out" down the
center, much like a halved watermelon with all the flesh removed.  "Undergound"
is the area within the cube but not in contact with the vegitated area in the
middle.  Underground will become the home of the neglected, full of crime, the
poor laboring lower class, not a place for \'nice people\' to go.  This is, of
course, a generalization; some Undergrounds will be quite livable.  Always though
they will be artificially ventilated areas with maze-like corridor structures and few "taxpayer services".

Transport within modules is by private vehicle, moving \'fast\' walkways, \'subway\'
or commuter train.  Movement between modules is by centrally controlled Tube
Transports.  Large railmounted \'trains\' that move through vacuum at high speeds.
Propelled by frictionless magnetic rails which hold their course,  they are the
ultimate electromagnetic-repelling train.  They move through tubes (to protect
from accident or sabotage) with no air friction or rail friction to hold their
speed down.

The whole habitat would be located just inside the orbit of the asteroid belt
which provides the life\'s-blood of this system.  (In fact, without the belt a
structure in space the size of this one would be quite impossible to build).
I have been wondering what will (or has) happen when the belt runs dry.  The
habitat had to be a tremendous drain on the natural resources of the belt.  Is
it, in fact, possible to build such a structure?  what volume of metal and ore
would be required?

The outside of the habitat would be covered with solar panels, antennae/comm
equipment, the occasional observation lounge window, and hundreds of airlocks
and mainanence panels.  Robotic or small-craft mounted sentries would patrol from
a distance using sensors for safety and to prevent saboteurs/troublemakers.

`The outer layer would be stronger than a ships hull (armor factor 50 or so) and
be in two layers.  Primarily to prevent large asteroid impacts from penetrating
(such an impact would be a disaster anyway).  Some defenses may be mounted (meson
guns place deep in the middle of a habitat), but mostly they would depend on the
fleet facilities (does the City of Los Angeles have missile defenses? no, they
have fighters \'nearby\' to chase bombers and ships at sea to prosecute submarines)
This is a civilian facility, although I was thinking a navy base/yard in the
center would be appropriate.

OK, thats what I\'ve got for now.  I\'m looking for other engineering
considerations, concepts for starport access (must have one per habitat?), ideas
to add color, flavor, and a sense of Scope to this idea.  How is the environment
maintained or recharged? Ice from the asteroid belt?  Remember this is a seedy
place; lots of crime, terrorism, elitism/class distinctions.  A city this large
should be as mixed and varied as the largest city on Earth (esp. since it has
a pop bigger than ALL of Earth).

Other questions; How old is the habitat?  what is the history of construction (I
though each ring of habitats would have been built outside the previous ones).
What abnormalities of everyday life do the people living there face?  Could
this have given rise to some odd customs or habits?

A final note;  I plan to eventually put this all together in a organized fashion
and submit it for the archives.  I also entertain the idea of submitting a
(boiled down) version of the posting to GDW or DGP for consideration.  I have
no qualms about using small details from others, but if this pans out and if
I use someone elses major concepts or ideas I will happily share credit and,
of course, payment, with any collaborators.

Yours,

Pete

   When I did a 3d universe, I used subsectors 10x10x10 parsecs, sectors
2x2x2 subsectors, and domains of 2x2x2 sectors (64 000 cubic parsecs).  I
found a realistic number of worlds per subsector would be 40-120 (about 500
per sector).  Average separation of ~1.5 parsecs.  I also did not like the
large number of habitable planets that normally crop up, so I revamped my
world generation system.  And star generation.  (It ended up being unusable
without a computer to do the work. :)  The separation of systems required
most ships to have at least 3 parsecs range to get around.  It made for some
convoluted trade routes if you are limited to jump 2-3.

Mapping traveller maps into 3-d isn\'t that bad.  I did it back in HS
(circa 1983).  But what you have to do is drop the damn hex grid.  You
map all the stars into spherical coordinates.

[Note: Spherical Coordinates are an ordered triple of (theta1, theta2,
r) where theta1 is the angle from the X-axis in the X-Y Plain; theta2
is the angle from the X-axis in the Y-Z plain; and r is the distance
from the origin.]

There are mapping functions between this and Cartesian Coordinates.
And yes you need a computer to do all this, I\'ve had a good
programmable calculator since HS.  So it was no problem.  You also
need a computer/good calculator to do the jump calculations.

I wrote a program either in Basic or Turbo pascal, I don\'t remember if
it was on an apple or an IBM-PC, to convert subsectors for me.  And a
second which took the output and printed an Epson map of the sector.
The map was flat X-Y plain with elevations on it so we could figure
out where we where headed and the coordinates of the world.

Today with the new HP-48xx which has 3-d display primitives built in
you could put the whole sector into it and display it in 3-d (much the
same way your characters are, yes they have cool holo-systems but...)

Finaly don\'t ask me for the code.  It wasn\'t that hard to write (I did
it from a good geometry book.)  And you try and find some code you
wrote in HS!

If I had a current Traveller campain I would rewrite the software.

so many systems in the Marches alone that I can never keep up

The 2D method of a 50% probability per hex must include stars above and
below this plane, so if you just stack standard sectors on top of each
other you\'re generating too many worlds.  So the distances between
worlds may have decreased, but to compensate you really should make them
more sparse.

The way 3D space was treated in Space Opera was that each world on the 2D
map got a z-coordinate.  This made the bookkeeping fairly easy, and didn\'t
seem to generate worlds which were too close.  The world in the adjacent hex
might be very far away if one has z=+10 and the other z=-23.

Yes, representing a 3D start chart on paper is difficult. GDWs Near
Star Chart for 2300 was pretty nice, but it\'s deceptive because to
dots on the chart that are right next to each other can easily be on
opposite sides of the sphere.

One thing that popped to mind was an actual physical model -- ala
tinkertoys or maybe those smokey sausages on toothpicks (of course
that model may not survive the gaming session 8-) 8-). But, if your
area of space is small enough, a small model may be feasible, with the
sticks being color coded for length and maybe just showing popular
jump routes.

On the other side of the coin there are a couple of stat programs (the
original was something like "Mac Spin") that allow the entry of 3D
data, and then you can maipulate the "Cube of Data". You can spin it
around, flip it, whatever, on the computer screen. I\'m pretty sure I
read somewhere that GDW used such a program to create the 2300 Map.

Of course, the detail is that you\'ll need the machine at the table.

Well, one could always make the Rift as "High" as it is "Long", and
you\'d still have a large gap is space that takes a long time to get
around.

As far as distances and such, I guess it would depend on what approach
you take to filling this new volume. Do you take the current start
systems and compact the map, or do you keep the map as is and add
layers to it, or do you just go through each subsector and roll a
D20-10 to get the new Z coordinate of each system? That would
certainly mess up the current jump routes.

Obviously Imperial Politics etc are dramatically affected by the,
umm, astrography (?) of the Imperium. I imagine that if for some
reason the Atlantic suddenly shifted and we ended up directly
bordering Europe, our politics would change a bit too.

I think that as far as trade routes and such, about the only thing 3D
really adds to the game is VOLUME. All of a sudden you\'ve got more and
more planets to deal with. 3D would have a large effect on a TCS
campaign, but only in the fact fleets would be more thinly cast
because they have MUCH more territory to protect. In theory, you\'d
have more ships for the fleet, but most systems don\'t add near as much
to the treasury compared to the burden to protect them.

In essence, though, I don\'t think the flavor or feel of a TCS
campaign or a Trader campaign would change much. You\'d still have
fleets flying around with insane communication delays, you\'d still fly
your trader to the most profitable planets for your goods, and it
still takes a week to get there.

So, I question whether it\'s worth the headache to manage.

The only place that 3D would change the "feel" dramatically, is in
tactical space combat. But even then, all it really changes are the
approaches of the units as they engage. One-on-One...wouldn\'t really
matter. Two on one, well...3 points define a plane... Several on one
it may get sticky.

3D matters in Fighter Plane games because the players are smack in the
gravity well and gain advantages from being above and below, but in
deep space, where it costs the same to maneuver regardless of dZ,
there\'s not any real play effect I would think for small engagements.

I don\'t know. Call me a fuddy duddy, but 2D seems to work okay for me.

    'body' => '  Ok, here it is:

  First of all, determine the status of the belt like normal in Beltstrike,
ie cost of licences and the rolls to get them.

  (You should roll up the belt using Worldbuilders at this point)

  Second [this is my own addition] determine the freshness of the belt:

1d6	Freshness	Later DM on Geology
1-	Bonanza		+1
2	Very Rich	0
3	Rich		-1
4	Normal		-2
5	Poor		-3
6	Very Poor	-4
7+	Exhausted	-5

DM\'s: TL: 0-7: -1, 8-9: 0, 10-11: +1, 12-13: +2, 14+: +3. Use PreVirus TL
     Cost of license (roll 5+ on 1d6 to ignore this DM): 0Cr +2, 1Cr-6kCr: +1,
     10kCr-600kCr: 0, 1MCr+: -1.

     Rationale: Higher TL places have had more time to exploit their belts.
		High cost of license means that there is something to get
		there, no license that it is of lower value.
		The dependence on the license cost is not set in stone, so
		there is a 33% chance of ignoring it.

     Note that the players shouldn\'t *know* what Freshness a certain belt
has, but they might hear rumours about it. Most NPC belters know which belts
(remember that most systems have some kind of belts!) in a subsector that
are rumored to be bonanzas or regarded as being exhausted.


  Here is the search roll [replaces the 2d6 roll in Beltstrike]:

  Formidable: Geology.

    (first divide asset to get Formidable, *then* add modifiers)

  DM\'s: The mod from Freshness.
	Each period beyond the first a certain person mans the sensors: -1.
	Accelerating ship (rare in TNE): -2.
	In trojan cluster: +1.
	Ship lacks densitometer (handheld dens is *not* enough): -2

	Max Sensor range:

	ls	DM
	1	-3
	2	-2
	4	-1
	8	0

	(ls = light seconds, or 300,000km. The maximum sensor range that
	 can be used in a certain belt is half the width of the belt.
	 Example: A ship with a sensor range of 8 ls is scanning a 2 ls wide
	 belt. They will get a DM of minus 3 from this, since there is only
	 one ls of belt to each side to actually scan, regardless of that
	 the sensors see further.

        Optional: Assuming that the sensors have to be used differently for
	each zone in the belt (C M and N), replace width of belt above with
	\'width of the zone they are currently scanning\')

  Rationale: Same as in beltstrike for additional periods and accelerating
	     ship. Densitometer seems like a good sensor for belters to have
	     so lack of it is penalized.
	     The \'current producing area\' area mod is replaced by making
	     the belt locally Fresher.
	     Bad sensors are also penalized, as are belts that are so thin
	     that full sensor capacity can\'t be used.

  [Insert old beltstrike procedure to determine what type of find that is
indicated, and if it is really present]

  The WBH procedure gives a common max and absolute max size of the asteroids
in a belt. That data is used by this. If the size rolled on the table below
is larger than the common max diameter given, reduce the size of the asteroid
to the common max asteroid, *except* in the case where a natural 12 is rolled
and the belt have an absolute max size larger than the common max size. In
this latter case, use the absolute max size given.

roll	extent	time	diameter
1	1	1h	3m
2	10	3h	6m
3	100	6h	14m
4	1000	12h	30m
5	10000	15h	64m
6	100000	18h	140m
7	1000000	24h	300m
8	small	30h	500m
9	small	40h	700m
10	small	50h	1km
11	large	60h	5km
12	large	100h	10km+

  time is the time in manhours required to conduct the initial survey, just
like in beltstrike but given in another timeunit. extent is extent in
displacement tons. Just like in beltstrike, the *actual* extent of the
asteroid and the find is got by multiplying the extent with 1d10 (reroll 1\'s).

  Mining: Each person with laserdrill can per hour mine and load 1m3.
	  Each helper w/o laserdrill adds 0.25m3 up to +0.5m3 for two
	    helpers per person with drill which is max.
          If a big turret mounted mining laser is used it adds 1m3 per
	  person *and* helper (max add 30m3).

  Use the costs from beltstrike with 1 ton = 14m3.

  Yup, that\'s all the changes I made. I\'ve used it once and it appeared to work
ok, but I\'d be interested in any comments.

  Free hint: The trick is not to find a rich belt, the trick is to find an
acceptable belt in a system where you will get a good price for the ore.

John Orthoefer (haven\'t seen you on icb recently, John 8-)
commented that 3-D traveller isn\'t too bad, given computer
game aids and such.  He\'s right, but it\'s still not a good
idea for many campaigns.

Doing a map-based (and 3D maps work, slowly and painfully ;-)
3-D system is possible if clumsy, and can be put into source
books and such, and doesn\'t require that the user have a particular
type of computer or calculator.  The problem is that it\'s very
clumsy, unless you think really hard first.

Doing purely co-ordinates based, using a computer or calculator
for relative distance calculations, is more elegant and much harder
to reproduce.  It\'s great if you\'re doing a campaign for your
own use... you can set up the computer program or calculator
functions to do the number-crunching for you, and don\'t have to
worry about having anyone else use the programs.

It\'s not portable.

The issue isn\'t doing one campaign, it\'s creating a system which
can be put on paper and sold in a source book, which is much much
harder.  You can\'t put a calculator program in such a source
book and expect people to go buy that brand of calculator.
You might get away with shipping 3 floppies, one with a Mac
version of the program, and a 3.5 and 5.25 floppy with PC
versions which will run on anything from a 286 on up.
But that\'s going to add three or four dollars to the product.
[Or you could ship three different versions 8-)]

There are still some problems with doing it that way.  It\'s
hard to visualze these 3-d representations, and the further
you get from having them on paper the harder it gets.
When it\'s a single subsector, it\'s not that bad... but at
larger scales, it\'s very hard to tell where you are relative
to nearby systems.

I don\'t like this.
I want to see a system which can be put down on paper,
can be mapped on paper, can be used without having to
resort to a calculator or computer, though those aids may
be very helpful.  Such a system is possible.

Well I liked it in mine.  But then I\'m not sure if I like the campaign
or the hacking to get the software working.

My point was that you don\'t have to think hard.  You just map all the
subsectors your intressed in a spherical system (I like to put  it
around a central world).  Then you map all the central worlds with
respect to each other.  Getting jump distances is then trival (trival
meaning there is a big nasty formual to do it, but you code it once
and then ask your computer tell you how far it is).

it sure is.  and you get nifty star maps and you can play what if
games just like your character are.  Because it\'s no longer ovious
which way you want your trading routes to go.

> It\'s not portable.

I don\'t think I ever claimed this.  I simply claimed it could be done
from experiance.

I think that you\'ll find in any group of people play RPGs today
atleast one of them knows something about programing.  I also think
that most of them atleast one owns an HP-48, at least at U of F you
had to have one to be an engineering student.

So if you write say a 48 program to do the math.  And a PC and Mac
version that does both the math and visulation (a 3-d scatter plot).
Make the program under something like the Gnu Public License (GPL).
And I bet you would do well.  Then you tell people to either call your
BBS and downlaod the s/w or get it off the net.  Not net incress in
the cost of the book (at least SJI seems to be doing well with
theirs).

Speaking of visulation I did fine with a flat display.  I used a + or
- - to repersent the world and a number to tell you the hight/depth of
it on the page (also the spherical coordants)  I knew excaly where
things where.

Thats why you only map subsectors and then your orient your
subsectors into sectors.

I\'m not computer-phobic infact I use computers all the time when I
don\'t really need to.  And YES if I get stuck on some backwaters
planet I may not be able to build a ship to achieve orbit.  But that
is to be talked about some other time :-)

I don\'t care if I need a computer to use the system, becuase I know if
I\'m playing I\'m going to have something atleast as powerful as my 48
to use.

Actually, having had it brought to mind, I finished up
work on my 3-d system (which was actually intended for
a slightly nonstandard background, but works for any
Traveller area anyway...).

It\'s got subsectors which are 5x5x5 cubes, and a
workable subsector map (whose prototype (postscript) will be
FTPable from the Traveller directory at ocf.berkeley.edu
by the end of the day).  Sectors are 2x2x2 subsectors.
There are 125 cubic hexes in the subsector, 50% more
than the flat subsectors in normal traveller but
quite usable.  That should average perhaps 40
worlds per subsector, a manageable number.

	It would completely change the entire history of the Imperium, starting

I had a similar experience with my short-lived "Traveller:2600" home-brew
campaign.  I ran it for a few months when I was in the Navy, and I used
a 3D 8x10x10 subsector.  Didn\'t need any larger administrative units such
as the sector, as all the major powers were a couple of subsectors large
at most.  As it was, the players never got out of Sol subsector.  I found
that trade routes tended to manifest as "arms" out from Terra, just like
in 2300.  I assumed this would be true for any alien homeworld as well,
and interesting things would happen where those "arms" came in contact.

You can (if you like) retain the hex-grid.  However, just as a hex grid
gives better adjacency than a square grid (6 neighbors to each grid point
as opposed to only 4), you can get better adjacency by shifting adjacent
planes of a stack of hex grids in 3D.  It looks really clumsy in text, so
I\'ll try to draw some pictures.

Instead of using layers of hex paper like:
 __    __        __    __        __    __
/  \\__/  \\__    /  \\__/  \\__    /  \\__/  \\__
\\__/  \\__/  \\   \\__/  \\__/  \\   \\__/  \\__/  \\
/  \\__/  \\__/   /  \\__/  \\__/   /  \\__/  \\__/
\\__/  \\__/  \\   \\__/  \\__/  \\   \\__/  \\__/  \\
/  \\__/  \\__/   /  \\__/  \\__/   /  \\__/  \\__/
\\__/  \\__/      \\__/  \\__/      \\__/  \\__/
   Layer 1         Layer 2         Layer 3      etc...

Where each hex has 8 neighbors; 6 around it, 1 up, and 1 down:

                       1
                   2       6
         7             *               8
                   3       5
                       4

Use a simple shifted pattern like:
    __    __       __    __       __    __    _        __    __
\\__/  \\__/  \\    _/  \\__/  \\__      \\__/  \\__/     \\__/  \\__/  \\
/  \\__/  \\__/     \\__/  \\__/      __/  \\__/  \\_    /  \\__/  \\__/
\\__/  \\__/  \\    _/  \\__/  \\__      \\__/  \\__/     \\__/  \\__/  \\
/  \\__/  \\__/     \\__/  \\__/      __/  \\__/  \\_    /  \\__/  \\__/
\\__/  \\__/  \\    _/  \\__/  \\__      \\__/  \\__/     \\__/  \\__/  \\
/  \\__/  \\__/     \\__/  \\__/      __/  \\__/  \\_    /  \\__/  \\__/
  Layer 1          Layer 2          Layer 3          Layer 4       etc...

So that each hex now has 12 neighbors:

                       1
      7             2     6            11
         9             *            10
      8             3     5            12
                       4

It looks much clearer if your hex maps are done on transparencies,
which you can get by photocopying a normal hex grid onto plastic sheets.
(If you only have access to white-lines-on-black, some photocopiers can
do inverse print - otherwise, you can buy hex paper or draw your own)

I don\'t see any need to use spherical coordinates, since Cartesian is so
much easier to handle.  For one thing, it doesn\'t matter where you put the
origin, since you can change it by simple subtraction.  Even the distance
between two points (*horrendous* under spherical coordinates) can be done
on a simple `4-function\' calculator (since most also have square-root).

One idea that may or may not work:  with transparent hex grids, you could
put a hole in each corner, and put some thin rods through them.  Maybe
you\'d need some more through the body of the map to prevent it sagging in
the middle.  Anyway, if that worked, you might get a needle and some
coloured thread to show common jump routes, or something.

Yes - that\'s why I tend to shy away from relying too much on my computer.
Of course, I use it extensively for typing up notes and other non-realtime
stuff.  I\'m a programmer, so I can do whatever I want  :-)
The problem is finding the time to fiddle with horrible little buggy bits of
code and wading through poor documentation  :-(

3 points define a plane, sure, but 3 moving points define a moving plane,
and the tactics of a moving plane differ from those of a static plane.
For one thing, a straight line path (often costing no `maneuver points\' in
space battle games) in 3D space maps onto a complicated curve (costing many
`maneuver points\') in the case of a plane defined by the positions of the
other 2 ships.  Furthermore, objects that should be "fixed" (like planets)
will need to be counted as a "ship", since they will not in general lie on
the plane defined by the 3 ships.

To make an analogy, you might equally well say that 2 points define a line,
and that therefore any 2-ship battle can be played on a line...
Think how much easier a point-defence objective would be if the enemy had to
*literally* go straight through you to reach its target!

2-ship battles simulated in 2D are not quite so bad, assuming that only
relative velocities matter, and that orientations and `absolute\' velocities
don\'t.  Unfortunately, no space combat game I\'ve seen has both these
conditions, so 2D is even inadequate in the simple 2-ship case.

2) There would probably be some simulation and training facilities for some
of the law enforcement agencies, maybe something like a combat village, with
a complete simulated set of spacecraft to practice boarding and the like.
Being able to practice training in a closed environment would allow them to
vary a lot of training parameters for a much more controlled training setting.


3) Cargo. Isn\'t it a whole lot easier to move cargo around in 0-G? No gravity
friction to contend with and the like.  Probably lots of HEAVY assembly going
on, maybe starship construction as well.



I prefer the entertainment idea, I\'ll have to think it out a bit more fully.

The problem with this, of course, is that you have to consult
(and think about) numerous maps just to get a picture in your mind
of one area (unless you put the maps on transparencies as you
suggest, and overlay these transparencies... a bit of work for
all concerned). Alternately, by tossing all the data in one map, you
get the picture more readily, but you also end up getting confused
by stars which *look* close to each other but really aren\'t. For
us programmers, we also have to contend with the difficulty that
arises when two stars occupy the exact same z-coordinate (and you\'ll
run into the same problem with your transparency idea). Suddenly it
becomes rather difficult to display both stars at the same time unless
you have some way of pivoting the perspective.

Hence the computer-aided map-viewing idea, which is okay as long as
your players don\'t mind.

**  Is there an IBM utility that does this available via ftp?  **

The main trick is that it has to at least be able to display characters
(names of the respective star systems) beside each dot.

Yeah, but again, you still run into the two-stars/one-z_coordinate
problem. I\'d prefer a mac-spin type arrangement and just make
sure we\'re playing somewhere close to an IBM with decent graphics
(not a terribly difficult feat, at least with the people I tend
to game with). I wouldn\'t want the machine on all session, but for
a brief consult-the-maps interlude, it could work out nicely.

Then again, there\'s always 2D. *gasp*

Christopher Rowley: _Starhammer_, _Vang: The Military Form_,
_Vang: Battlemaster_ .    All set in the same universe, although Starhammer
occurs hundreds (thousands?) of years before the other two.

There is much to be said for the offset-stacking method.  There are also
good reasons not to use it.  Primarily, it makes mapping with anything
BUT maps-on-transparencies much harder to "see" what\'s going on.

I chose to have a straight-stacked map for my 3D subsector map,
with 8 neighbors (6 on same level and one above and one below),
and am cheating a bit and also giving a better distance function
if you want to shave a couple of parsecs off that jump (which makes
the systems at up/down one and over one 1 parsec away for jump
purposes, though they\'re really 1.414 (sqrt(2)) away...).

It\'s not as realistic, but it\'s much easier to visualize.
The whole point of using very large-grain hexes is to simplify;
Traveller 2D could have mapped using cartesian coordinates in
much finer detail, but they simplified to keep it straightforwards.
I think that applying that methodology to 3D developments is
a good idea.

limiting factor is not economics or knowledge, but a near-religious
philosophical abhorrence of factories and mass-produced items. These people
wouldn\'t object to televisions, grav cars or space ships  -  provided they
were handmade!

Consequently I\'ve decided that 90% of all consumer goods are tech 3, 9% is
tech 4, 9/10th of one percent is tech 5, and 1/10th of one percent is tech
6. Question: Does this sound like a reasonable distribution?

It seems to me that some tech 6 (and by no means all of it) is the highest
that would be economically feasible. A master gunsmith might make a living
making a few submachineguns per year. Noone is going to make a career out
of manufacturing one jet-plane per decade.

However, there exist a large leasured class (a landed gentry) that often
make high-tech items as a hobby. These squires might devote a decade to
making one single impressive item.

So my main question is this: Given that you have a large income, can buy
most tech 4-5 items ready-made, can hire assistants for scut-work, has
tech 15 knowledge available, and are willing to devote a couple of hours a
day for a decade to the project, what kind of interesting high-tech items
might you be able to produce? What would be beyond you? Same question for
familiy projects, ie. several family members working on one project over
several generations (this culture is over 2000 years old and very stable).
Would you be able to build a spaceship? Or even a starship?

	Material: One 4\'x8\' sheet of pegboard cut in half to yield
			two 4\'x4\' sheets.
		  Four eyehooks
		  Heavy string
		  Thread
		  Numerous little colored balls of various sizes.

Place the eyehooks into the ceiling. Attach one of the sheets of
pegboard to the eyehooks with the heavy string and a few feet lower
attach the other pegboard sheet.

The lower pegboard is the base XY plane at Z of 0. I used a scale of
one parsec between holes and a similar distance for the Z scale for
interstellar distances. Roughly one inch between holes which yields
a 48x48x48 parsec cube of space.

The numerous little colored balls of various sizes represent the stars
of varying stellar class and size. Use the thread for the Z-axis and
cut to the appropriate length.

Hang the threaded balls from the upper pegboard sheet for the positive
coordinates and from the lower sheet for the negative coordinates.

Now you have a pretty good picture of 3D space! And for added visual
effect use black thread and fluorescent paints for the stars. Turn out
the lights and illuminate with a black light to get a really neat
display!

To convince your spouse that this isn\'t permanent you can hang some
plants from the hooks when your gaming buddies aren\'t around! ;-)

	Christopher Rowley.  I found this section of the book to be quite
fascinating.  I probably would have enjoyed it quite well if it had never
left the habitat.  Drat, now I have to go find a copy and reread it...

	I\'d also recommend Vaccum Flowers, Steel Beach, and the whole
Paratwa series (Liege Killer, Ash Ock, The Royal Caste - don\'t let the
cover on Liege Killer fool you, it\'s a typical SF cover-has-very-little-
to-do-with-the-inside situation.  Kept me from reading it for quite some
time...).  Unfortunately, my memory seems to have deserted me, as I cannot
remember anything about the author\'s names, except my hazy memory insists
that they\'re first names are all "Christopher" :-) Oh, wait, some of it
comes back to me...

	The Paratwa series is set in various space habitats, with one
or two side trips to the ruined, desolate Earth.  Basically involves
some heavy suspense/thriller stuff with genetically engineered paired
assassins (telepathically linked, one mind with two bodies).  Fun stuff.
The author actually is named Christopher something-or-other, I think.

	Vaccum Flowers, by Michael Swanwick, takes place on various
habitats.  Portrays an interesting solar system with a well-developed
culture, but almost no planetary settlements.  Various habitats in
near-earth orbit, cometary habitats, etc.  Lots of focus on
personality reprogramming (i.e. skill-augmenting wetware, and
artificial personalities you load into your wetware - a much different
slant than Effinger\'s _When Gravity Fails_).

	Schismatrix, by Bruce Sterling, takes place almost entirely in
different sorts of habitats (and what doesn\'t take place in habitats
takes place in spaceships).

	Steel Beach, by John Varley, takes place entirely inside a lunar
colony that has been around a while.

	Ophiuchi Hotline, by John Varley, I think.  Set somewhat after
Steel Beach (although published before).  A good read, takes place in
various lunar colonies, asteroids, space stations.  By the way, it\'s
pronounced Off-ee-yoo-ki.

Several different sorts of SF stories (most recently cyberpunk) have
suggested idea for stuff to do in O\'Neill-type colonies, which would have
centers much like your big ring.  I\'ve seen hang gliding on Gibson\'s work
and also in some recent short stories.

What I\'m curious about is, what other ideas people have seen for zero-g
recreation?  Seems to me it could be kinda interesting to make up a list of
whatever people might think of or have seen, and then turn it into a
"Imperial Zero-G Sports Catalog", as a nice fleshing out of the oft-ignored
recreation aspect of role-playing.  After all, think of what your players
would think if the next time they hit a belt station they get to choose
what sort of goofing off they do -- and just think of the opportunites for
weird patron encounters...

For an actual description of what sort of combat training you could do in
zero-g, I\'d recommend the first half of _Ender\'s Game_ by Orson Scott
Card...
(anybody seen other such ideas, as well?)

        I remember National Geographic putting out some pretty nice looking
star maps and even galactic maps using a system similar to one somebody has
mentioned.  They had a large circle laid out on the paper, but tilted at an
angle so that it looked like a long ellipse, i.e. as if you were looking at
it from 45 degrees off of the Z-axis.  Then they had stars marked in space
by placing them above the right location on the circular reference grid,
and altitude marked by using a line running down to a spot on the circular
plane.

TNE Combat just doesn\'t work right.

I\'ve had a few game sessions now involving combat and there is
something seriously wrong with the weapon penetrations.

Why won\'t my snub pistol firing HE or HEAP penetrate the simplest
form of body armour (ie 1 point bullet proof vest) after all that\'s
what HEAP was developed for the pistol to do.

I tried the variations (instant knockdown on head/chest wound, stunned
from first scratch, inflict enough wounds to reduce initiative to zero,
roll d10 or d20) but none of it works.

The weapons just don\'t do any damage.

In one case I shot the guy 5 times and he just kept shooting me.  In
frustration I did a flying kick (successfully) and knocked the guy
down.  Wow, I did more damage by kicking him than I had done with
5 HEAP bullets fired (and hitting) at point blank range.

The tables are WRONG.  I tried some variations to make the tables
work but they don\'t.

I like the rest of the game but I just can\'t come to grips with this
combat system any more.

Can somebody post some sample firefights (and calculations) with a
variety of weapons to show me that I\'m not reading the rules right
or where I\'m going wrong?

A similar device was used in the computer game "Elite," although it was
used to track other ships in 3-D space.  This was very useful and corrected
with pitching and yawing of the ship, so that you were always oriented with
respect to the other ships who had you in their sights.  It was not
particularly useful for gauging distances, but it seems to me that this
sort of thing is certainly amenable to fixed stars and could well be
adapted.  We already use a PC for our games simply for ease of rolling dice
and running the mechanics of large NPC companies, so adding something like
this if it were available would fit in easily.  I\'m not a computer guru,
though, so it will have to be up to somebody else out there!

I now return to list-lurking and return you to your regularly scheduled

3D mapping was discussed some time ago and somebody then pointed
out that the 2D Traveller maps just weren\'t showing all systems
but just the interesting ones.

If you take the 2D map in this light then you can treat JUMP
drive as a 2D mechanism.  I tinkered with this idea back then
and came up with some basic assumptions.

The Traveller 2D maps are simply a 3D universe squashed flat and
only showing interesting systems.

A JUMP can only travel it\'s JUMP rating in 2D but in the 3D
universe the source and destination may also be vast distances
apart in a vertical direction.  This vertical distance does NOT
affect the 2D distance that can be travelled.

If two or more interesting systems do end up in the same 2D map
location then you still would need to JUMP (for a week) to get
to each system from any other system in that hex.

What this tells me about the Traveller universe is that their are
either very few star systems and most are interesting or that
their may be many star systems that are not shown because they are
not interesting.  A uninteresting star system in the Traveller
universe would have to be totally devoid of matter other than
the star(s) themselves and therefore not worth mapping or
visiting(?).

To map this type of Universe in 2D all you need is larger hexes.

If you take a sub-sector map and increase it\'s size so that each
hex contains 7 hexes (a centre and six around it - call it a super
hex) then you can map each of these vertical matching locations into
one of the hexes in the super hex.

If a super hex of 7 hexes is not enough then the next size up is 19
lesser hexes to a super hex.  Scale your universe to suite the density
of stars you prefer.

What do you think?

1: Handmade High-tech: where do you draw the line? Some of the parts required
to build more advanced and efficient machinery simply MUST be manufactured? Is
it alright if it\'s powered by \'natural\' fctories, like a mill that uses a
water wheel? I can tell you how a jet turbine works, but I wouldn\'t know what
to build it out of to accept the streeses--and you might not be able to make the
alloys without a masive foundry (which is a kind of factory). You need to be
more discriminating in your definition. But it\'s a good idea.

2: Near Stars: I would be very interested in an Excel version of the list.
Please send it to me at:
	RJR96326@VAX1.Utulsa.edu
Provided of course it doesn\'t take up some obscene amount of space. I can
probably handle about 750K without deleting all the other stuff I have.

3: 0-G cargo. Well, no, it doesn\'t get easier to move. You still have all that
mass to shove around. On Earth, you fight the the force pulling it down
(Gravity) but in space you\'re just as likely to push yourself farther than the
box you\'re pushing.

4:Z-coordinates: James vassilakos said there was difficulty when two stars
occupy the same Z-coordinate on a 3D map. I think he meant the same XY
coordinates; identical Z-coordinates would put them on the same page. If they\'re
on the same XY coordinates, one\'s right beneath the other, which would indeed
make it hard to spot on a series of transparencies.

5:Armor penetration: I can understand HE not penetrating well, especially if
it blows up on impact. HEAP, I agree, should burn right through armor.

As for lasers, let\'s discuss armor. Kevlar is made up of a ballistic weave, like
a big quilt. When something blunt (a bat, a bullet) hits it, it spreads the
damage out over a greater surface area, dispersing it in a way. However, as a
weave, it is very susceptible to impaling attacks, like knive and lasers (which
are pretty thin). I would ignore the armor rating againt laser for any armor
based on such a weave (though hard armor, like a battlesuit, should have full
protection).

I think one would have to know what your definition of hand made was.
I believe there is a car manufacturer in the south U.S. that hand
manufactures limos (Blackhawk?). In this case all parts are indivdually
fitted, milled, etc. But using a drill press or a lathe isn\'t really
hand made is it?

If I could make a jet by myself (or with a small crew of assistants) in
a decade, with cash up front, and contuation money, plus a large
completion bonus. Then as long as I was making at least a average
wage, then why not?

I don\'t think that any electronic components could be hand made.
(depending on your definition). It would be pretty hard to even make
vacuum tubes by hand (which of course includes televisions). A lot
of modern machinery also requires fairly tight tolerances. The pistons
in your car have to be almost perfectly cylindrical. These are hard
to do without some level of machinery.

I think that this type of culture is interesting, however. What happens
to visitors to the planet? How could you tell by casual inspection
that a gun was mass-produced, not hand made?

Actually, the hardest part is the initial mapping of the 3-D Sector.  Your
players and you only need to remember a simple rule to calculate distances
during play.  Take all the distance of the longer axis and half of the
distance of the two shorter axes.  Total all three numbers and you have the
distance between the two worlds.

While not accurate to any decimal places it gives a "good enough for
government work" figure that you can use.  You do not need access to a
computer and most

amers are capable of simple addition and subtraction.

Heh.  The ongoing experience rules of old Traveller were always a
point of annoyance.  The trouble was that the authors apparently
didn\'t want characters picking up skills in play quicker than during
character generation (i.e: 1-4 per four year term).  Basically, you
may embark on a period of self-improvement of four years duration;
this can be physical or skills based. If physical, you increase
each of STR, DEX and END for the period on a roll of 8+ (+2 if
INT 8-, +4 if INT 5-). At the end of the period, or if training is
interrupted for 3 months or more, the stats revert back.

For skills, the four year period can be used to raise either one
gun and one blade, or two non-weapon skills by one, for the
duration of the four years on a roll of 8+ (no mods).  If a further
four years was spent, the skill increases became permanent.

I will be honest, and say that I never saw a character successfully
last eight games years in the eight or so real time years I played
the 1977 and 1981 editions of Traveller.  In practice many groups
worked out house rules for skill improvement or simply got used
to static characters.  GDW finally provided better experience rules
in Megatraveller, but even these I found to be cumbersome and
frustrating.  One of the delights of TNE is that the scale of skill
levels has shifted (x2 or x3), allowing a skill improvement system
that lets the players learn on the job.

>2) Is there still alot of people playing it??

I believe so, but even though I have a lot of nostalgia for 1st and
2nd Edition Traveller (1977 & 1981 - I never saw Starter Traveller,
so I\'m not sure what minor changes it has over the 1981 books) the
rules have their problems.

MegaTrav\'s biggest problem was an appalling typo and omission rate.
>From a game point of view, it was an attempt to integrate ten years
of Traveller development without changing too much.  Character
generation was improved quite constructively; the old combat system,
which was quick and fun, but badly flawed in its treatment of armour
(cf. D&D Armour Classes), was replaced by a modified version of the
miniatures rules.  Starship construction became hellishly complicated
as an attempt was made to combine _all_ vehicular construction into
one sequence.

The game was also firmly tied to the Rebellion background; wheras
the old rules were pretty much generic (unto themselves :) and
only brought GDW\'s house universe in with the supplemental material.
(I _had_ no supplements for the first two years I played ;)

Traveller: the New Era is pretty much a clean break from the old
mechanics and rules, but I feel it recaptures a lot of the feel
of the pre-MegaTraveller game.  If you like clean, logical mechanics,
you should like it.  Try before you buy, however; if you are happy
with the old style of Traveller, there is no real reason to switch,
particularly if you want to avoid the more modern incarnations of
the default background (which has moved from very vague to very
specific)

I received the BL and TNE erratta today.  I\'ll type them up and post it to

About combat:

Penetration: There are a couple of things missing from the
explaination of penetration.  Here\'s a quick fix:

Divide the penetration value by the damage value of the round.
This is your penetration factor.  The penetration factor
is the number of dice of damage you lose for each level of armor
it tries to penetrate.

About combat damage:  Loren Wiseman (sp?) suggested these fixes:
Use d10 or d20 for damage dice instead of d6.  Make the auto-kill
rule automatic.  He alos posted a long rationale for why the
combat system was less lethal.

On a personal note, does anyone have a copy of the Ahzanti High Lighting

to compensate you for your trouble.  Also, as a quick fox.

Yikes! Yes, thanks for the correction. Two stars on the same Z-axis was
what I meant. A while back a very short-lived SF-RPG named Universe
came out, and it had (for its time), the very best near star map in
three dimensions. I often think that it\'s unfortuate that the publishers
didn\'t release the game in the "little black book" format which
Classic Traveller is known for. Certainly, they could have probably
attracted the attention of numerous Traveller players that way. But
that\'s beside the point.

Anyway, they semi-solved the two-stars/one-z-axis problem by having
one dot with two names and two z-coordinates. Of course, just imagine
the difficulties should every discrete z-coordinate between the top
of the map and the bottom be occupied by a set of stars with the same
XY coordinate. You\'d have a map-makers nightmare.

But, as difficult as this problem is for the astrographer, it\'s
even worse for the programmer. We have to envision the problem
beforehand and find a solution without ever knowing what the
data set looks like. In other words, we have to solve for all
cases.

This is probably a key reason 2d maps are so popular. They just plain
easier to work with. But, you have to admit, there\'s something very
SFy about looking at a 3d starmap as opposed to a 2d one. 3d maps
give you a sense of a *really big* universe out there. 2d maps look
too much like settlements on a planetary surface. They aren\'t nearly
as neat to look at. They don\'t make you *feel* like you\'re really
in space.

This is why I think a rotable 3d map on a computer would be the ideal
solution, but I know of no programs (even non-ftpable ones) which will
fully satisfy the requirements at hand.

1. 3d/rotatable (obviously)
2. display name of the star-system beside the identifier on the map,
   legibly, semi-regardless of the user\'s point of perspective.
3. use color and size to further distinguish stellar/system features.
4. incorporate an adjustable cartesian grid with numbering displayed.
5. IBM executable (assume SVGA or better)
6. Input data stored in TEXT file (this is important, because we need
   to be able to write simple programs to generate this data, and it
   would be nice to be able to hand-modify it with choice of editor).

Anyway, that would be the sort of 3d map viewer I\'d pick up if there
were any immediately available (ftp or otherwise). Unfortunately, I don\'t
believe that any exist which meet even half of these requirements
(well, I suppose ACAD meets *half* of the requirements, but certainly
not all of them). Anyway, if any of you distinguished programmers
decide that you want to make a project out of this problem, please
consider the above before you set down to coding.

I assume this society does allow the use of tools, otherwise they wouldn\'t
have progressed past the Stone Age.  In fact, they wouldn\'t have even made
it into the Stone Age!  Using a flint knife isn\'t really hand made, is it?
:-)

If the objection to mass-production is philosophical, what they may demand
is that an individual - or even a single group - be responsible for the
entire production of a given item.  And the maker(s) will take some pride
in their product, to the extent of embellishing it a little - signing it,
decorating it, or in some other way adding an organic touch.

Is it just a bland piece of metal?  Or does it have lots of nice, ornate
engravings on it?  Take a look at some old flintlocks, made in the days
when guns were handmade.  The gunsmith probably signed it, either in
writing or with his own brand of decoration.  Of course, a machine could
be made which produced suitably engraved parts, but most places wouldn\'t
bother.  The customs inspector is likely to say something like "Ooh, that
looks nice, definitely a personal touch there, right it\'s O.K.", or
alternatively "How boring, that\'s the thousandth one of those I\'ve seen,
all the same, just drop it in that litter bin over there." :-)

An interesting question from Hans.

On the subject of hand made jets, I would point out that
(according to CNN\'s Sci & Tech Week) there is now avaiable
a kit built jet for the kit plane builders out there.

The main problem I think would be that the maintainance for
such a plane would be rediculous.  Without pre-made replacement
parts for every 100 hrs of flight, you would be in for a LOT of
down time.

As to the ability to hand make stuff, it depends on your definition
of hand made.  Your TL 3 tools would be hand made.  With those tools
one makes TL 4 tools.  With those, one proceeds to make TL 5 tools,
6...7...?  With your philosophical preference for hand made stuff,
sounds like a crew of craftsmen who would be very protective of
their tools (They\'d have to be to build the planes, TV sets (starships)
you seem to want them too.)

But, would your definition of hand made allow them to use a tool
(machine?) that would grow silicon chips?  Would it allow them to use
a tool (machine?) that would allow them to etch a silicon chip?
All one is doing is using a very sophisticated tool.  It is not a
"Factory", but is it a tool, or a machine?

I would say tho, that up until TL 6 or so, almost every prototype of
anything is hand made.  Guns, planes, trains, automobiles and
battleships.

One of the nice things about this definition is that it is applied by human
beings and is therefor not required to be consistent. If you asked them, the
Ajabarans would tell you that they couldn\'t give you an exact definition,
but that they would know a factory if they saw it. Anything like an
assembly line is out. I guess that the main factor would be the scale of
the enterprise. A blacksmith, OK. A small foundry, propably OK. A massive
foundry, propably not. Of course, that really ought to rule out a number of
low-tech stuff like ocean-going ships, but, as I said, people are not
required to be consistent.

I don\'t know what a drill press is, but using a lathe would be acceptable
(a handbuildt one, of course ;-).

If such a concept as money up front and continuation money existed, yes. I
hadn\'t thought about that possibility. I\'ll consider it. But what I had in
mind was craftsmen making stuff and getting their money when they sell it.

Right. Some machinery is needed. What I had in mind was the kind of
machinery a late 19th Century goldsmith or weaponsmith would have
available. Perhaps the power source would be a good lithmus test. Any
hand-crancked machinery is allowable. But since I\'d want people to be
able to use any high-tech they do manage to build, petrol, electricity,
and whatever must be acceptable as long as it is not used for further
manufacture.

Hmmm. It\'s a good thing consistency is not required, because there are
holes in that logic that you could drive a truck through...

Anyway, handmade means muscle-powered tools only, OK? And no assembly
lines, not even with only muscle power.

>I think that this type of culture is interesting, however. What happens

That\'s what I want my players to find out some day ;-) They get treated to
anything from a cold shoulder to physical abuse, depending on the bigotry
of the native.

>How could you tell by casual inspection that a gun was mass-produced, not
>hand made?

Depends. With slugthrowers you might not be able to. OTOH I think that the
local craftsmen add a lot of individual flourishes to the ornamentation on
their guns. That\'s one of the effects I\'m striving for: Submachineguns
with finely engraved battle scenes! And not two alike, of course.

This has been a problem in many RPG systems that I\'ve encountered.

In our current 2300 campaign, for example, we\'ve been playing for almost 5
years. We get an "experience" point once per session, with bonuses at the
end of an adventure. Experience points are worth 1/2 of a "skill point" from
character generation; i.e. to buy up a skill from level three to level 4
your must put 4 experience points in.

Over the years, we\'ve developed characters who are pretty god-like. My
current character, for example, now has 5 skills at level 4 (or better :-)
(2300 difficulty levels are 4 points apart; tasks are rolled on a linear
D10).

The problem is that the game was never designed to have characters with this
level of skill; we tend to walk rings around our opponents in the stock 2300
adventures. As a result, our DM is forced to do considerable extra work to
make things more challenging and interesting for us.

On the other hand, we probably wouldn\'t still be playing if this avenue for
imporvement didn\'t exist. I can\'t imagine still playing my "original"
unskilled, naive character...

So, here\'s my question:

What system do you all use in your campaigns to award experience to players?

Hi,
    reading through the rule book last night I saw some entries in
the pen column of the ammunition to be 1C (This was mainly by the
HEAP rounds) what does this mean. I could not find any referance to
it. I took it to mean that this PEN value applied to Cloth and above,
other weaker armour type would be unable to hinder the round.

Refering to the fact that some rounds had not chance of getting past
the armour (as mentioned in some other messages), have you consider
the impact damage that is refered to in the rule book. i.e. When it
is still possible to be damaged, even though the round did not get
through. I was only skimming the book yesterday so I may have missed
a few details but I think this is correct

If the world is fairly isolated from regular offworld traffic, there
will probably be people very eager to leave as well, like any
restrictive society needs an escape valve. Witness the number of
Pennsylvania Dutch children who leave the community to make their way in
the big city in popular society, or people from small towns or students
from the 3rd world who never go back. Or people from Eugene Oregon who
leave for Portland or Seattle (I can sure see why :-).

Or think of the two characters from _Doc_Hollywood_ who wanted to leave
their home town and go to LA. The young lass would have done nearly
anything to get Ben Stone to take her with him. Maybe an idea for a
plotlet in there. "Back to the Interstate, Ben Stone".

On the other hand, maybe the planet is famous for its quirky goods and
has a lucrative trade business. There\'s still people eager to leave the
Squash capital of the south.

literature to get my point across, I am unmistakably a member of
Generation X! Acck!)

I\'ve been following the 3-D space visualization problem. It reminded me
of how I had to view 3-D trajectories of underwater vehicles when I
worked for the Navy. Back then, I used Matlab to do the trajectory plots.

If I had to do it now, I\'d use DeltaGraph or some other charting package.
Think about it. You could link all J-1 routes into their own path.
Different symbols could be used for tech levels, starport type, or
whatever you wanted. Later, it would be easy to rotate to the proper
view point. Just a suggestion...

I received the GDW mailing including errata for BL and TNE. The BL errata
is the same as that included with the boxed game. I don\'t have much
interest in the TNE errata because I don\'t think I\'ll use TNE, my main
interest lies with BL. If anyone wants them, I\'ll post them.

I have a few questions concerning BL.

(1) Has anyone found the stats for the Manta fuel skimmer listed in the
    Aurora-Class Clipper.

(2) Has there been any reference to the capacitors used with Black Globes.
    The rules seem skimpy, certainly not enough to design anything with
    them.

Thanks

Glenn

Yesterday I wrote some guidelines for a computer software package that
could display 3d maps.

One response, received this morning, is from djohnson@cix.compulink.co.uk
who is actually considering taking on the project.

He went on about it being important to have pre-defined specs, which
I have to agree, would be important for such a project as this (I\'m
used to programming simple things. This puppy is a monster my comparison.).
On this note, we got talking about data file format.

I\'m forwarding my response to the list, since there may be others who are
thinking about the problem.

Also, for anybody thinking about this stuff, Kerry Harrison
(harrisok@ccmail.us.dell.com) mentioned a program named "Outlander\'s
Starchart 3d" which is supposed to be available somewhere somehow.
I dunno yet, but talk to Kerry.

Anyway, if anybody makes any progress on this, please let the rest of
know what you\'re up to.

  The only comment I\'ll make in connection with this question is to
  note that one of the "official" publications, possibly dating
  back to the Classic Traveller days, had a sentence in it, in an
  article on the Droyne, that said, in effect, that "their
  hand-made Jump Drives are probably the finest in existence."

  As to the rest of the starship, deponent saith naught.

Page 191
A number of players have expressed concern that there are now two
parallel sets of governmental type codes, one for the Wilds, and one
for use elsewhere, as this will cause confusion when reading UWPs.
Players should think of the government digit not as a firm definition
in the same manner as a size or hydrograhics code.  Rather, it is a
descriptive tool to help create an effective roleplaying atmosphere.
Unlike all other digits of the UWP which are quantifiable, government
type is highly descriptive in nature and is often a judgement call.  For
example, is a board of directors a Participating Democracy, a Company/
Corporation, or a Self-Perpetuating Oligarchy?

Future Traveller: The New Era products will expand and further detail
world governmental descriptions. The basic book was not able to contain
such a system for reasons of space, and  because the game had to allow
players to generate pre-Collapse Imperial worlds, the classic Traveller
method of government generation was retained as an interim system. In
providing the Wilds government types, we aimed to increase the diversity
of world types that can be visited, and further fuel players\'
imaginations.
Like real governments, UWP government digits can change unpredictably,
and exist to help referees create interesting campaigns, rather existing
as ends in themselves.

Travel Movement Table
Some of the Travel Moves are off.  Correct values are:

5 Sourceworld Trade Classifications
Atmosphere for Industrial class should be "2-,4,7,9"

Page 288
Upon further testing, we have decided that the following wound effects
provide more entertaining and dynamic play, and suggest that all players
use these instead.

Serious Wounds: the roll to avoid losing consciousness every turn in
which
the character attempts an activity becomes a Difficult roll against
Constitution.  Characters who have lost consciousness make a Formidable
roll against their Constitution each turn to attempt to regain
consciousness.

Critical Wounds: The roll to regain consciousness is made each combat
turn, and a D100 (percentile) roll against the Constitution attribute.

Page 289
Add the following new rule for the use of the personal medical kit,
immediately before the "Stabilizing Critical Wounds" section.

Use of a personal medical kit (page 334) allows a character with neither
Medical skill nor a doctor\'s medical kit to avoid the unskilled penalty
when attempting a first aid task (thus it is a Formidable task using the
characters\'s EDU attribute).  One such use uses up the medical kit.

Page 292
Under Powerboats, the reference to "size one" should read "Micro or
SubMicro".

Page 301
Fire: The task to extinguish a fire should be a Difficult versus CON,
not
Formidable.

Page 302
In the example of the collision between the car and the truck, the
following corrections should be made: "the car is hit with a value
of (95x2)/10, or 19," "which means that (19-1=) 18 is referenced," and
"As a result, (9-1=) 8 points are taken to the Vehicle Damage Results
Table."  In the tandem bicycle example, the check versus Agility should
be Average, not Difficult.

Page 315
In the second to last paragraph, delete the reference to the limit on
maximum simultaneous sensor locks.

Page 325
Delete Hit Location table in the lower left-hand corner of page, as it
is
redundant.  Use Ship Facing tables at upper right for hit location.

On Ship Facing/Beam Weapons Fire table, "Fore Quarter" line should read:
"reroll results of 16 through 20."

Page 340
Communication Equipment
The in-text range of 500 km for both the Communicator, Laser, and
Communicator, Video, should be changed to 300 km, and all references
to the term "regional range" should be deleted.

Page 348
Laser Turret Table
The TL 14 150Mj laser turret should have an Extreme range listing of
"16:1/10-30."

Page 351
Slug Rifles and Carbines
The double-barrel rifle mentioned in the note is 12mm, not 13, and its
magazine listing in the table should be 2i.

Page 354
Small Arms
Several people have asked if the recoil figures for the 4mm Gauss
Pistol-13 are in error.  They are not.  Because Traveller: The New Era
uses
a more realistic system (developed for Twilight:2000) for rating
firearms
based on weapon weight, round weight, and muzzle velocity, than
Traveller
did, weapons that were created for Traveller do not always work well
when using their original Traveller specifications. The recoil is high
because it is specified as being such a light weapon for its high muzzle
velocity.  We have theorized that this is a light, easily concealable,
hold-out weapon that is hard to control.  Another gauss pistol design,
intended to be more controllable in combat, is shown at the bottom of
the
page. {I reproduced it below--matt}

                                  ----Weight----

Page 355
Lasers
The Laser Rifle-9 (8cm) should have a Pen of Nil/3-Nil.
The Laser Rifle-13 (4cm) should have a Pen of 3.  This Penetration does
not attenuate with distance.

High Energy Weapon
The numbers listed under "Pen" are the weapons\' Penetration Values for
use against vehicles, see page 297.  The penetration ratings for use
against personnel according to the rules on page 285 were inadvertently
omitted.  These ratings are 1-2-10 for all plasma guns and 1/2-1-4 for
all fusion guns.

Correct ranges for Fusion Rifle-14 is 50, and Fusion Rifle-15 is 70.

Page 360-365
Vehicle Data
Many of the vehicles have no listed configuration or an incomplete
configuration.  In addition, Travel Moves and grav vehicle Combat
Moves need to be corrected.  Their correct configurations and Moves
are as follows. The notation Unarmored refers to the Unarmored
Vehicles rule on Page 301, and the reference to turrets refer to the
Hit Location rule on page 297.  Any Travel or Combat moves that are
not listed do not need correction.

Note that travel moves for ground vehicles assume that the vehicle is
moving at a rate of 1.5 times its safe speed for a period of four hours.
This means that a ground vehicle could go farther than this during a
four
hour period.  The absolute upper limit is twice the listed travel move,
which translates to the vehicle\'s driver making constant Formidable
driving rolls for a period of fours hours.  Travel moves for aircraft
and
grav vehicles are in the format high flight speed/NOE speed.  For NOE
speed, the Travel Move is 1.5 times the safe speed for four hours, just
as
for ground vehicles.  Because high flight speed is an absolute speed at
high
altitude, the high flight Travel Mode is four hours at this speed, with
no
need for driving/piloting checks (except in the case of bad weather,
etc.,
at the referee\'s discretion).

  Well, Paintball was mentioned; I can see variations on soccer
  (Football to those of you who aren\'t from the US), lacrosse,
  field hockey, and other similar sports (all of the above are just
  variations on a theme.  There\'s nothing that inherently requires
  gravity in any of them).  Games like jai-alai and handball
  shouldn\'t be too difficult to adapt, either - and there\'s your
  gambling sport.

  You could suspend a great big ball of water in the middle of the
  0G area, and there\'s your swimming pool.  But you\'ll have to
  remember that there\'s no tendency for the human body (or anything

James, Perhaps you ought to sit down, take a stress pill, and think

I\'m not sure how valuable this would be.  3D starmaps look very
different from 2D ones, and the resulting trade routes and political
boundaries would be quite meaningless.

I\'ve done some analysis of a near-star catalog (*), and it doesn\'t
look as though the standard Traveller jump drive price and size
hierarchy makes much sense in three-space.  Now, in the Spinward
Marches, there is approximately one star every other square parsec,
leading to the wondrous Spinward Main.  Approximately half of the
stars in a 40x32x(1) parsec rectangle are reachable by jump-1, and
most of the rest by jump-2.  The extra jump distance mainly provides
speed.  On the other hand, each star has (at most) six neighbors
within 1 parsec, 12 within 2, 18 within 3 and so forth.

In the 25-parsec radius around Sol, there are 2250 stars in ~1750
star systems.  Ignoring the possibility of drop-tanks for now, here
are tables with the number of reachable systems in \'real life\' and
in the Solomani Rim sector in Traveller for set distances.

   \'Real Life\'         Traveller
Distance  Systems  Distance   Systems
   1         0        1          0
   2         4        2     all but a few
   3       1027       3         all
   4       1720

Breaking down the 2-3 parsec range (because with this degree of
detail the numbers can be broken down any which way), \'real life\'
looks rather gradual:

  \'Real Life\'
Distance  2.2  2.3  2.4  2.5  2.6  2.7  2.8  2.9  3.0
Stars       4   88  190  299  326  561  723  842 1027

In fact, this gradual nature is more of a product of not using
gridsquares rather than of using a 3D representation.  But it also
means that the size of your jump drives/fuel tanks also determines
where you can go _at_all_ as well as how quickly you can get there
to a much greater degree than in standard Traveller.  A
Beowulf-class Free Trader won\'t get much business with just Jump-1
drives, even if they do get enough fuel for two jumps!

One of the reasons, for me, that 2300 feels different than Traveller
is that star travel is constrained.  They seem to have cunningly
picked a limit of 7.7 light years ( <2.4 parsecs ) in order to give
space a degree of texture that allows Terran national governments to
dominate space.  Perhaps also, to avoid overwhelming players with
choices, which could happen given their limited display
abilities...

Going back to 3D Traveller, I don\'t think it would be very valuable
to use 2D subsectors in 3D games, and vice versa.  A 3D map will
assume that it has six borders, not four, and will have trade routes
coming in from the subsectors above and below.  Furthermore, for the
same number of stars, it will be of different dimensions.  (more
like a cube 5 parsecs on a side).  If Z-coordinates are arbitrarily
removed, the star systems will be in different positions, leading to
different relations between them, and an entirely different
political and economic situation.

This also applies to the large scale boundaries of empires.  Being
3-dimensional entities, they will have borders that follow the
contours of their stars, rather than those of a flat map.  As such,
they will probably be smaller and more spherical than indicated on
the standard Traveller maps.

I believe that it would be a mistake to assume that 3D can be added
to Traveller simply by layering subsector sheets on top of each
other, because the original mapping was highly unrealistic, and
many of the assumptions implicit in it are not portable.  3D
Traveller sounds like fun, and I\'d like to work on a universe using
it.  However, anything related even remotely to astrography would
need to be reworked in its entireity.  As such, it\'s unlikely to be
Classic Traveller + 3D.

Wholehearted agreement from this corner. While being a proponent of
"3D Traveller", I\'ll be the first to admit that the very term is
somewhat of a misnomer. Because once you add that third dimension, not
only do you have to re-write the maps from scratch, but with them, most
of the setting and background (as a lot of it is based on those funky
2D maps) and much of the starship travel (and possibly construction)
rules (which is also based on 2D astrography). In short, Traveller 3D
would be a supreme headache and an unprecedented pain. And in the end,
so much of the game would have been re-worked, that you\'d be more than
stretching the truth to call it Traveller.

Nonetheless, for those who have the time and the gumption, this idea
of "Traveller 3D" can be a lot of fun. But whatever the level of
sophistication, the initial "coolness" will only go so far. There\'s
a lot of work involved, after all, work that could be better spent
thinking about plot, and characterization, and all those "other things"
(i.e. the mainstays of whatever makes roleplaying games so much fun).

My suspension-of-disbelief would be about the same in either case
(2D or 3D). I think it comes down to the personal preference of the
GM. All said, for most people out there, 3D probably isn\'t worth the
headache that it entails (if you want to do it right). But for those
of us who have already broken with the published Traveller setting
(and rules to some extent), the jump to 3D, while still being a headache,
may not be all that huge a headache. And it is one certain way to
differentiate a game. "Wow, you have a 3D universe? Cool."

Just make sure that when that initial "coolness" wears off, the rest of
the game is still fun and is (hopefully) enhanced by the 3D-astrography
rather than being drowned by it.

And no reason (other than surface tension) for the ball to stick together.
And no reason for the ball to stay put, either.  After someone "dives" in,
the ball would probably shatter into a million droplets, which would stick
to the nearest surface, be it a person or the walls of the room.

Was it perhaps "The Menace from Earth", yet another of
those Robert A. Heinlien classics?

The ANNIC NOVA was never a "official" design in any of the Traveller starship
design systems, and as far as I know, it\'s origin was never determined, although
it was certainly extra-Imperial.  As far as rating it in T:TNE, you could do a
lot worse than just translating the descriptions in the text into T:TNE or BL

My roommate and I spent some time coding a 3d space viewer during

be relevant.  Of course, the code is still very beta - no releases
from us anytime soon, although that was the eventual goal.

Apologies, while editing this I lost at least one level of

One problem with this:  dealing with a \'reasonably large\' number of
stars, names quickly become illegible.  The solution we\'ve used is a
cursor that moves between stars, and displays name/other info in a
sidebar.  You might also want to do something more global, like
turning on/off the names of all stars within Jump-N.

We didn\'t do this, because our default environment was 2300, and the
only thing that really matters is the relative position of stars -
we took our data and massaged it to figure out which stars were
within stutterwarp distance of each other, and then toggled off/on
displays of valid stutterwarp routes.

Think about it for TNE - do you really need a cartesian grid?

Has good technical documentation come out on SVGA coding yet?  Also,
although we have nice Tseng hardware, we\'re using something like
640x480, because at that resolution most cards have two pages and so
you can use screen flipping to animate it, meaning it looks _very_
smooth.

Actually, if we agree with your reasoning I\'d use the opposite
implementation - our data set is really really huge (>2MB in some
database formats, I think), and if we wanted to view it differently
we\'d have to load up a database manager, select a different set of
columns, map them into color values, save this out to disk as a text
file, and then run the viewer.  At least one use I\'d envision for
this (although maybe it just means I\'ve spent too much time writing
code to support decision-support software) is players sitting there
interactively getting different views/display formats of what\'s out
there, changing as they go which subset of the data is shown
on-screen so they can look for patterns.  So player ideally says,
"Color blue all systems containing terrestrial planets" and the display
ripples to its new configuration.

This is only a reasonable amount of extra work if you\'re coding just for
Traveller.  Coding for arbitrary SFRPGs is a software engineering
problem that is certainly solvable, given arbitrary resources  :)

In an earlier post to this list, Loren said that they revised

In #71 of Challenge, there are two articles on design notes for BL and
a general article on Lasers in space combat.  In that article, David Nilsen
(sp?) says that 1) Reflec would be more like ablat (because the reflectivity
of the surface would be ruined after the first hit) and that 2) Reflec would
be too wrinkly on a person to be effective. He also commented that the
weightless invisible body suit was "too much of a good thing".

As to Plasma/Fusion Pen, see my post a few nights ago: they left
out some numbers: the listed numbers are for Vehicle pen.

The 1C notation means that their is explosive/concussion damage.  It\'s
in the rules (look under explosives, I think-- I don\'t have the rules
with me...)

About the low penetration of various weapons:  Body armor has to
be good for something, right?  The 2-2-2 rating for HEAP might
also be for vehicles: I\'m not sure.

3D Traveller systems are difficult for a number of reasons.  First, the
jump routes are exceedingly hard to represent.  In 2D systems crossing
a sector boundary is simply shown by a line leading to the next sub-sector
or sector.  In 3D systems you end up with lines hanging.

Plotting movement is also a hassle when crossing boundaries.  Unless all
stars are plotted on the same X,Y,Z grid you will have to devise a system
for determining distance when the coordinates do not match exactly.

Another difficulty arises from the number of stars routinely plotted for
a sub-sector.  Stars in the area around Sol occur with a frequency of
1 every 10 cubic parsecs.  Sol is in a relatively thinly populated area.
As you move to the center of the spiral arms the stars get much closer
together.  The most dense seems to be in galactic cores where stars can
bunch up to several per cubic light year.  My own work with the Gliese
catalog places about 130 stars in 80 or so systems in a 10 x 10 x 10
parsec cube with Sol at the center.  Ships need to jump quite a ways to
reach the next star.

Finally, (at last the end) I suspect Traveller 2300 limited the distance
of travel to keep players from going anywhere on the map at any time.
Unlimited travel distances tend to "shrink" the map even if the ships are
slow.

  What about gray areas like imported electronic parts that are then
hand assembled or even just custom packaged?  An end user is typically
more interested in what the product looks and feels like than what\'s
inside.  Nobody would know but the repairman, and who do you think
would be fixing a one-of-a-kind design anyway?

  Another approach would be to think of all the prototype custom wire
wrapped circuit assemblies of today.  That could be elevated to an art
form if you can get around the problem of mass produced components.

  This has been my interpretation, too.  Keeps it simple so you
can spend more time adventuring.

  From what little I remember about stellar statistical distributions
the vast majority of stars are red dwarfs that have little or no
adventuring value in Traveller.  That and darker matter are what make
the jump calculations so difficult.

  Can anyone on top of matter distribution suggest a gaming reason
to include these systems in an adventure?

  Good explanation as any!  Does anyone think it\'ll affect any
game mechanics or history?

For my needs I am quite happy with the following setup:  I have the star

A small program calculates the distance between one star and the others. When I
need a map, usually of a small section of the universe I use Graftool in which
3d maping and projecting on a suface is pretty easy and self explanatory.
With it I can make 3d maps in any orientation, with anchor lines and projection
on any plane.  GT is a few years old so more recent tools may be even easier.

Bumper Cars... (Newsweek, June 7, 1993)

An empty Saab Automobila factory in Sweden got a little *too* mobile
last month when a misprogrammed assembly line jump-started itself and
assembled 24 cars, rolling them off one after the other into a wall.  A
worker finally discovered the auto-automated line, but not before it had
created an impressive chrome-and-steel pileup.  Saab officials said that
damage was minimal.

"Assembly lines run slowly, and we have big bumpers," a Saab spokesman said.

Subject: Computerised Library Data


I am thinking of typing up \'Classic Traveller\' Lib data on computer for my
own campaign. I was thinking of using the Windows \'Card File\' application
for this as a simple way of doing keyword searches. Before I do this though
has something like this already been done? I\'d hate to go to a lot of
effort and then find out that it was already available from somewhere.

Comments
- ----

Our group has converted to TNE and is using the above errata, plus the d10
damage suggestion. We have found that they work well, and the extra damage
makes things just that little bit more fearful for players, though so far
no serious harm has been taken.

We also changed the 2-2-2 for the auto snub pistol HEAP-8 to the 1C rating
for snub revolver\'s HEAP-8, as we couldn\'t see why the ammo would perform
differently, and the change made the auto snub pistol useful. So we\'re
treating this as a misprint. Please let me know if this -isn\'t- a misprint.

BTW, the 1C penetration on the small arms table is I believe interpreted as
1-1-1, and is merely a shorthand form. There is a comment in the small arms
rules about this difference in meaning from anti vehicle penetration
notation.

OUR GROUP\'S VARIANTS
====================

Other variations we are using are:

Double Damage Dice for Outstanding Success:
- ----

When we first read the rules regarding doubling damage if an outstanding
success was achieved it was unclear whether this was double damage which
penetrated, or double the damage dice. We are currently going with the
latter as a way of giving some weapons a chance to do damage in skilled
hands at short range.

I\'d appreciate knowing what the -correct- interpretation is though, if
anyone would like to comment.


Autofire Variant:
- ----

None of us liked the idea of rolling quite so many d20s, or using rules
which were a different form from the rest of the combat section. The
following variant is under test. Comments welcome.

Roll to hit as though a normal direct fire shot. However, use the recoil
value listed for bursts rather than single shots.

If you hit, the number of hits depends on burst size and range, as given by
the table below:

Burst
Size 	 Short	   Medium    Long      Extreme
- ----
3   	  d3 hits  d2 hits    1 hit     1 hit
5    	  d5 hits  d3 hits   d2 hits    1 hit
10  	 d10 hits  d5 hits   d3 hits   d2 hits

50  - 	 treat as 10 round burst above, but each rolled hit represents 3
actual hits.

It is assumed that for 3,5, and 10 round burst weapons the rate of fire is
so great that all of the burst leaves the weapon before the recoil starts
to take much effect, and so the grouping is reasonably close. For this
reason all the hits scored are against a single target. [This is inspired
by the 3 round burst rule in Cyberpunk 2020. If people think this is
reasonable/unreasonable, please comment].

The 50 round \'long burst\' is assumed to hit targets in the danger zone as
described in the rules, with the hits being as evenly distributed as
possible between the available targets.

For spraying an area with autofire:
- ----

At least 2 bursts may be fired - at this stage recoil penalties are likely
to build dramatically (remember to calculate as though it was a direct fire
single shot)

The danger zone used is as described in the rules.

Roll for each burst to see if it hits the area.

For each burst that hits roll to see how many hits are scored.

The hits are distributed as evenly as possible between the available
targets.

Burst Modification:
- ----

A 10 round burst weapon may instead fire only 5 or 3 rounds in a burst. In
such a case reduce the recoil number by 1 or 2 respectively.

Likewise a 5 round burst weapon could be reduced to 3 rounds for a recoil
reduction of 1.

I hope the repeat errata helps those who were confused.

d quit a bit
of it on the Phoenix Command system from Leading Edge games.

One item I\'d like to point out is that the 3 round burst rule used in Cyberpunk is based on the performance of the G11 w
eapon in
final development for the German Army.  This weapon fires fast enought to achieve the recoil effect only when it fires i
n the
3-round burst mode and at a specific range.  This feature only increase the likelyhood of a single hit at a specific des
igned range.
Under normal area fire the G11 sprays just like any other weapon.  In my varient I gave weapons with this feature a DM e
qual to:
              rounds per burst / 3, ignore all fractions.
multiple hit can be score for each number rolled that\'s less then the required to hit number.  At LONG range an addition
al hit is
scored for every two number less then the required to hit number rolled.  No multiple hit is allowed at EXTREME range.

If anyone is interested in obtaining a copy of my rule variant (whick covers combat visibility, mod. wound and recovery,
 combat
sequence, guided rounds) let me know and I can upload it to uwo.ca. (~16 pages)

According to the FF&S draft that wildstar sent me, HEAP small arms
ammo ALWAYS has the penetration 2-2-2.  When GDW did the weapons
conversions from CT/MT to TNE, they converted them directly, which
had a few odd results, like the low-velocity (therefor low damage) snub
pistol that could no longer penetrate.  I suspect the 1C may be a misprint,
but I don\'t know for sure: by the FF&S gun creation system, it is.

>BTW, the 1C penetration on the small arms table is I believe interpreted as

No, 1C indicates that the round is explosive.  I don\'t have the rules with
me, but if you can\'t find it I\'ll be happy to find the page number.

FF&S should hit the shelves shortly, and then you can create all the
"official" guns you want, and be fairly certain that you\'re adhereing
to the rules..  but having FUN is the most important thing, right??

Examples of confusing entries are the 10mm Snub and 4mm gauss pistols. It has always
been my understanding when dealing with small arms fire versus character armor
that the number listed under penetration is the number of dice lost at that
range bracket versus one point of armor. Example: a G11 doing 3 dice damage and
with a penetration value of 1-nil hits a character with one point of armor on
the body location hit (and is standing at short range). The hit does 2d damage
plus one point for blunt trauma. My confusion stems from the fact that the
penetration ratings for the two weapons mentioned above is equal to the dice
of damage that they do--which means: two dice damage with 2-nil pen hits one
point of armor and is reduced to two points of damage from blunt trama, which
is the same as a nil rating would produce, so why don\'t they just say "nil"
in the first place since that is the effect anyway? Am I reading this wrong?
Is there some notation I missed? (Incidently, I solved the problem for myself,
at least until I get FF&S, by altering the codes of a lot of weapons to match
more logical stats from other "house" systems.)

Depends on how the machine is used. If it turns out identical chips by
the dozen it\'s a no-no. If the craftsman can look at one of his chips
and say: \'Yeah, I remember that chip, that\'s the one I made last Tuesday\',
then it\'s ok.

A very good idea, James. I shall certainly include an encounter with

Absolutely contrary to the law and the prophets, but these people would
have the same proportion of rouges and iconoclasts as any other human
population. So a local villain buying such evil stuff off the PCs would
be a definite possibility.

I don\'t know if silicon chips can be made one at a time.  What the craftsman
(or crafts team, probably) should be able to do is make a whole wafer by
themselves, and identify a chip from that wafer.  Treat the wafer as the
individual\'s product, and break bits off it to be used as necessary.

Presumably these people don\'t grow salt one crystal at a time, or sell
orange juice in handy, mouthful-sized containers.  You buy a big lump of
the product, and break bits off as necessary.  The same applies to silicon
chips.

Alternatively, maybe they\'ve gone from discrete components to VLSI in one
step, and produce a whole computer on one mega-chip.  These people are
likely to be the first to make a portable Model/9 computer.

I was recently at a modern dance performance and ended up in a discussion with
a dancer ( my wife, the one who drags me to these things) about zero-G dance.

We decided the arena (theatre?) would consist of two flattened bowls, one
\'above\' and one \'below\' the dance area.  The audience would be arrayed around
3/4 or 1/2 of the circle formed and would have normal gravity.

A performance would have changes in the grav level during or between pieces,
so the performance could easily take place in any gravity environment.  We
thought there should be a pole (or poles) in the center (or around) for the
no-grav portions or it would be a series of \'launches\' and \'landings\'...
probably pretty boring after a while (then again, this is dance).

The high points would be acrobatic turns and twists, and interaction of two
dancers, using each others\' bodies as their \'reaction mass\'.  Obviously if
one dancer pushes off from another the other also travels at an equal speed
in the opposite direction, unless the second dancer already had a vector of
travel.

A last thing to point out is that even the least acrobatic forms of this art
would be dangerous.  If your (burly, high mass) dancer slings you the wrong
way, or you cannot catch the \'bounce bar\' just right you could go slamming
into the wall with quite a bit of force, breaking ankles, knees, skulls etc

I could even see a scenario where a dancer is killed in the \'stage\' by a rival.

btw all these zero-G uses are great, but why are we limiting the concept to
the center of a space habitat?  It seems like, after TL10 or so, gravity
controls are cheap enough for performacne use, sports, public entertainment,
and even private use.  It would also find many industrial uses.

I am still working on the Habitat I mentioned a few weeks ago.  I may write
some details soon for comment.

I don\'t have problems with the concept of a destructive virus
in Traveller.  I don\'t even have problems with the concept of
such a virus getting through the presumably excellent defenses
that a TL-15 society would develop in response to having been
exposed to other vires at various points in its development.
However, the idea of an unrecoverable virus that affects everyone
is indefensible.  And even if you fudge things enough to make
such a beast possible, the details of the TNE virus are still
not believeable

 were on my mind recently- this areas been hit with a new strain of Beijing
 flu so badly I\'m reminded of \'The Stand\':))
   When the Virus idea came out just about everyone hated it, for a wide
 variety of reasons- it sounded stupid, it didn\'t fit Traveller, it was
 unnecessary. I still think all those apply, but as time goes by the idea gets
 almost reasonable (....well a bit less stupid). Current events like that
 wonderful Virus-protection for Windows and Flash-programable EEPROMS  show
 that as computers become more common they have to become transparent, and
 soon people have no idea WHAT rubbish the makers put in there (Hardware or
 Software).  If that is continued into 1120 TI then the concept that a Virus
 can get into a computer and run rings around the person using \'Sys-Op for
 Windows 482.3\' is OK.
   Besides, I am sure that a large number of Traveller players have considered
 the possibility of AI Viruses before TNE came out- I did and more than one
 person on the TML has mentioned it. So overall I\'ve stopped hating TNE
 because of the Virus.
   I think the reason the Virus sounds so wrong in Traveller is that it doesn\'t
 match with how Traveller Computers appeared in the rules. In Book 2 they
 were one step above the Difference Engine- the MIGHT have used that new
 fangled Silicon Chip stuff (or maybe not- the power consumption was closer to
 a BIG electric motor turning those brass  wheels very fast....) It was a
 logical step to assume it included various control systems in the cost/mass
 as well, but then MT came out and you had to add them seperately (I used the
 MT design system a lot, but now it\'s gone I feel relived :))
   To make the Virus work, suddenly all these computers had to become hugely
 powerful optical/organic systems, that were beyond the understanding of those
 operating them. It just didn\'t seem right that the Model 1bis went from
 VAX to HAL in one step....
   OK, so I\'m exagerating- but they could have at least given PCs a chance to
 use those super-supercomputers for useful tasks before they suddenly become
 sentient/insane/homicidal :)

   Still, now TNE is here it\'s back to the Transistors.....

For those of you have already seen issue #1, I would like to say that we
have greatly improved the graphic quality of issue #2. We have also gone
to a slick cardstock cover, and intend to go to two color covers  with
issue #3 and hopefully to full color covers with issue #4.

We have tried to give TTC the look and feel (as well as quality articles) of
the early JTAS\', High Passage and Traveller\'s Digest. I hope interested
Travellers will take a look and let me know what you think, as well as let
me know what you\'d like to see in future issues. We also welcome articles
and artwork....if there is enough interest here, I could post the
Submissions Guidelines.

Strephon Lives,

    'body' => 'Hoi,

There was a question about experience rules for traveller:

Way back, this used to come up all the time ... anyone who moved over
from D&D to Traveller wanted to know where the experience rules were.
So we all developed our own house rules for experience points. When the
instruction skill came out alot of this went by the by - if you wanted
a skill you got someone to teach you it. The group I used to referee
had by this time got used to the house rules, however ....

I have a somewhat complex system I developed back then, based on the
fact that Traveller and Runequest were my favourite RP games (still
are).

Basically:
- - each game session the player might be awarded an experience point in
a particular skill. A natural 12 on a 2d6 for any roll gets a bonus
point. In practice the expectation is that a point WILL be awarded
unless the player\'s character really screws up, or dies.
- - the points went into a pool, but a list was kept of the skills
where each characters\' points had been gained
- - when the player has enough points, he/she can expend them on a skill
roll in any one of the skills on the list. To qualify for a the roll,
the player needs (3*(S+6)) points, where S is the hoped for new skill
level (so for skill-3, you need 27 points).
- - the player rolls once on 2D6, modified by Int. The modified result
must be greater than or equal to S+6.

In practice, given that the interval between gaming sessions tended to
be 1 week of game time (another house rule was that the session
finished after the players went into jump), the result was a decent fit
for the progression of skills acquisition during character generation.
Once this fact was explained, failing the skill role after all the
scrimping and saving was not a big issue - the players were fairly
philosophical about it. But it did allow a character to muster out in
his/her 20s and continue to progress. When instruction came along, that
allowed characters to move up to level-0 or 1 in a new skill and then
use the skills system to progress further. I also kept track of a few
key NPCs during the period, so that they also developed along with the
player characters.

For lengthy periods of rest (eg one character is recovering in a
meditank), characters could also develop via practice: provided the
referee agrees that facilities are available (ie no swimming practice
on a desert world) the character needs to pass a Det roll to pick up a
skill point. Back then I had a Det characteristic (called Motivation)
but I rolled it separately - I don\'t think the basing of it on Int/End
in MT is a particularly bright idea. Characters with low Motivation
picked up interesting contacts down the bar instead ...

A few fairly sedentary skills could also be practiced while in
jumpspace, but in fact most skills are difficult to develop in the
confines of a small ship, effectively travelling on autopilot.

The intention was to take the Runequest idea of making moving up in
skills more difficult the further you wanted to go. It worked out OK
for me, but it requires a little maturity on the part of the players to
take those failed skill rolls.

How you\'d do it under TNE I\'ve no idea ...

I picked up Challenge 71 the other day, and it had some items of intrest.

Frank Chadwick and Dave Nilsen had an article on Lasers in Space Combat,
critiques of which I\'ll leave to those better versed in the ins and outs
of lasers.

The Brilliant Lances design notes are in there. I\'m glad to hear the
first mention of "Brilliant Lances Express", slated for 1994, which
will cover big battles with lots of BIG ships.

Traveller News Service is coming back on line, as Loren mentioned.

There\'s some problems with the "Straits of Magellan" scenario, though.

A "no spoilers" critique of the problems is this:

a) transit time between the inner and outer system is apparently
   about four hours.
b) the ship they intercept is supposed to have travelled from two
   parsecs away in realspace, taking 70 years to do so.

Maybe in MegaTraveller, but not with the fuel constraints of TNE.

To travel 2 parsecs in 70 years, the ship will have to be travelling
at almost 10% the speed of light.  0.1c works out to 1800 hexs/turn
in Brilliant Lances.  Using its jump fuel, the Valor-class is able
to make up to almost 700 hexes/turn, providing you feel no need to
slow down:) , most other ships reach far lower velocities if they
exhaust their fuel.

If you changed the scenario so that the intercepted ship jumped
in but couldn\'t maneuver or signal, so the crew went into low berth.
To account for why it wasn\'t found if you assume the shakedown
flight only travells several hours away from its home port, rather than
the days or weeks needed for TNE in-system travel, have the Magellan
operate from a base in the outer system, rather than from the main
world itself.


In other sections, I\'m left wondering why they used a Far Trader and
Fiery-class escort to illustrate a 2300 article :)

I used to think that the power consumption and size of the computers
was really out of line.  Then I started working for Cray Research.

Really fast machines with about the same floor space requirements and
power consumption as Classic Traveller computers.  We\'re not talking
about Macintoshes and PC clones you plug into the wall after all.

(The answer was no, but he and she are open to the idea) I mentioned
we had been kicking the idea aroud on the CherryhList but mainly
looking at things in terms of MegaTraveller rules. He thought this
was quite sensible as the two universes were very similar. He had
great praise for the MT rules. "The UTP is a wonderful idea: simple
and elegant. If I ever do a 4th Edition GURPS I will allow myself
to be *heavily* influenced by it." He was shocked to discover that
The New Era, which he hasn\'t had a chance to look at, dropped it.
He just sort of shook his head. (He affirmed that the Star Vikings
were Marc Miller\'s fault and he stole them from some book whose name
I can\'t remember)

Not yet. ;-)

Remember that the sort of computer which you can now put on your desk, or
even in your pocket, would have taken up lots of power and floor space a
couple of decades ago.

Traveller along the lines of "great idea, too complicated to run
or for the players" or "nifty but impossible to code"
	What\'s wrong with you people? Wake up! Did you not note that
my post was about what it *is* like to run 3D traveller, not what it
*would* be like.
	I\'ve been running 3D traveller for 5 years now. It is *not* too
complicated for players. My players don\'t even have a technical
background. The main ones are a Biblical Scholar, a Printer, and a
Economics/Philosophy student.
	The main aid for all of this has been a 10x10x10 map done as 10
10x10 sheets and a simple cubic diagram of what relative cells you can
reach with a jump-2 ship. There have been one or two mis-calculated
jumps in those 5 years.
	As far as representation, come off it. All you need to know is
the basic rotational matrix. I spent two hours and volia! I had a 3D
displayed map added into SYSGEN that you can cycle and rotate. (For
those who *still* don\'t know, SYSGEN and its companion LIBRARY are
programs that generate almost everything you might want to know about
Traveller worlds down to World Builder\'s Handbook detail, available on
anonymouse FTP on either the TML server or on walton.maths.tcd.ie in
the pub/jaymin/trav directory).
	The Traveller system and background *does not* break down in 3D.
In fact, if you apply exchange rates like in TNE/TCS you need the extra
choice that 3D gives to ever hope of making a profit on cargo speculation.

	This brings me on to my second topic. *Does* anyone else use the
exchange rate system in TNE for cargo speculation? It kind of makes it
even slower to generate cargo available at a port. It used to really
slow down game play to sit and roll loads of dice to generate what cargos
were available at each port. Eventually I incorporated it into SYSGEN.
Then it was a simple matter to put in the exchange rates and a further
extension predicted what profit the would make at each planet within their
jump capability.
	Things change dramatically when you introduce the exchange rates.
In the normal course of things the most profitable trade routes are from
high-tech worlds to low-tech world. Going from TL15 to TL0 nets a minimum
150% profit (on top of the normal 25%). There are trade code effects but
these are fairly minimal. When you add in the exchange rates, though
you discover that the currency of most low tech worlds is fairly worthless.
Thus the whole things moderates and you can wave good-bye to all those
high-profit routes.
	The next add-on planned for LIBRARY is a course planner that
recursively chooses the best trade route (using the Knight\'s Tour
algorithym) from either point to point or just around the place. Once
that is done I\'ll post the best rountes for the Spinward Marches.

	Some people were complaining before about the lack of lethality
in TNE combat. Well, I spoke before of how I used the TNE-Virus idea as
a Virtual Reality game that my player\'s characters played. Well at the
moment I\'m re-working some D&D modules as a Fantasy VR game that they
have on-line and might play. For that a combat system that isn\'t as
lethal as "real life" is perfect. To best enjoy the game you want the
players to live, yet destroy loads of enemies. So, solution: use the
non-lethal combat system for VR and save the leathal one for reality!

You can read all of the mail that was sent back and forth from
the people that beta-tested the section of FF&S that wildstar had
by getting it by ftp from pub/traveller/gdw-beta at the ftp.engrg.uwo.ca
site (the same place that archives the mail from this list).

There were only two sections released to wildstar: slug-thrower design
and aircraft design.

I (agreeing with many of the other testers) thought that the rules
were good, but that they needed some sort of flow charts in the rules
to simplify the creation process.

We can\'t show you a table of contents because we only received two sections.

It was supposed to go to print last Wednesday, so it should be out soon.

I think that if the rest of the rules follow the pattern of these rules,
FF&S should be an excellent product.

  I realised that larger computers need power closer to the Book 5 /MT
 requirements, but 250 MEGAWATTS??? (for about a Mod4: it\'s been a few years
 since I used High Guard). A friend once said if you work out the heat that
 produces it melts the whole thing in seconds (and I\'m the one with the
 chemistry degree so I should work it out).
  I wasn\'t really serious about the power- the \'china syndrome\' applied to most
 equipment in MT, just an effect of measuring everything in MW I suppose. I
 remember J.Fugate justifying it as \'use expands to fill availability\', which
 doesn\'t help the crew of a Scout/Cooker.

  BTW- finally got my hands on Challenge 71, and overall it\'s quite good,
 worth it for the Design Notes anyway. Compared to the older issues it still

We only got a look at the small arms and aircraft design sequences.
Suggestions made ran from the minor (spell-checking), moderate
(changes to design formula, correcting a few errors in technical
explanations), to major (proposed reorganization of the sequences
to make them more user-friendly).

Of these, I think (but do not know) that most suggestions will be
used, except for the reorganizations, since they were proposed
very close to the deadline to expect a rewrite to be done.

Yeah, I saw this, and you did a very good job, by the way, but your
map solves the multiple-systems-along-the-same-Z-axis problem by only
displaying one plane at a time. That is, if two systems are next
door to each other, one above and the other below, you won\'t see them
on the same map. You have to flip through Z-coordinates. At least, that\'s
true on the text-map which I saw with the program. If there is some
rotational map which you\'ve added since, let me know, and I\'ll take a look
at the new version.

On this topic, I recently received a 3d map display program called
_Outlander\'s Starchart 3d_ from Kerry. It rotates a bit slow on my
386DX25 w/ 1MB Trident SVGA, but the thing is awesome on my roomie\'s
486DX50 w/ the Viper Graphics. His machine is actually fast enough
so that you can get a good idea of what the 3d image looks like by
watching it spin around. On my machine, the redraw time is too slow
for this, however.

Outlander\'s Starchar 3d is available via anonymous ftp on
greyhawk.stanford.edu in the D_D/incoming/PROGRAMS directory.
The program is specially written for space-gamers, not AD&Ders.
The filename is 3d.zip. You need an IBM-PC or compatible to
run it. Note that the program is orphaned. The author has
dropped all support. If you don\'t have ftp access but still
want the program, contact me for a uuencoded copy via email.

For my own tastes, it\'s not exactly what I was looking for, but
it\'s the closest thing I\'ve yet seen. I\'m curious as to what other
folks with think of it. And I\'m also curious to see what Jo has
done.

Signal GK is a MegaTraveller fanzine set in the Dagudashaag
Sector (the sector immediately to spinward of Core). The setting
was originally developed by Duncan Law-Green as part of his work
as a HIWG member, but the fanzine operates independantly of
that organisation.

Each issue is between 40 and 48 pages long, A4 (11.5" x 8.5") page size,
centre stapled. Additional material is included with each issue, such as
library data on a particular subsector (in A5 loose format, ideal for
filing in a ring binder as a reference), deckplans (B4 size) and
`Specials\' articles which were too large to fit in the magazine itself.

Each issue contains at least one `Contact\' article, detailing a new
alien race or culture, and at least one `Port of Call\' article
describing an individual system in detail. Other regular articles
include adventure scenarios of varying length, personalities, and
`INDISS\', the Dagudashaag news service, as well as new weapons and
equipment, and discussion of variant rules systems.

The contact address for Signal GK is:-

	Jae Campbell
	The Sanctuary,
	45 Fairfield,
	Hebden Bridge,
	Halifax HX7 6JD
	UNITED KINGDOM

Individual issues of Signal GK cost about 1.50 (sterling) in the UK
and about 2.50 overseas (by surface). A three-issue (1 year) subscription
is 5.00 in the UK and 7.50 overseas.

\'Net.  Even without spreading over wires, I\'m sure the "well, I\'ll just
loan this to a friend" factor is a major disincentive developers, since it
eats up most of whatever few prospective sales you might have had in the
first place. (I know this was in the minds of Digest Group back when they
were working on their disk set; did that ever come to market, or did they
shift focus before it came out?)


Of course, when you throw in the problem of multiple disk formats and
different platforms, for goshsakes, there\'s almost no reason at all for
somebody with even a fair amount of resources (i.e. TSR) would spend them
making software they can\'t make money on anyway.  If you can make them for
proprietary platforms, like Nintendo, then you get deals like SSI\'s games
for TSR, but otherwise even TSR, who can afford to do a bang-up job on
software if they like, won\'t touch the sinkhole of software tools...

Which leads us to the solution we\'ve all developed to deal with the above
dilemma: home-grown tools written by those with the dedication and skill
and most importantly, without the need for payment.   I haven\'t had a look
at the archives recently (i.e. in years), but last I saw nobody was even
trying to present their work as shareware or "please pay me if you like
it"-ware, though I know some of the stuff I\'ve seen was definitely of
commercial or better quality.  (Never mind the screen stuff, if someone
actually codes all the starship rules or worse yet, planetary system rules,
smooth enough to use them a lot, then that\'s a bang up job in my book!)

For those selfless souls who have spent so much time out of their love for
the game(s), I can only say bravo!  and thank you, and we can only hope
they and others will be willing to slough thru it all again for new
versions of our favorite games...

                                it seems counterproductive to try and one-up

Gee, thanks Anthony! I was quite happy being a lurker until you went and
dragged me into the limelight :) ...

FYI, the work I did on Antares (must have been three or four years ago
now <sigh>) was based around the Antares Ring Confederation, a high-tech
Solomani/Vargr autonomous enclave in Sarar subsector (Antares F). OK, so
these guys were political enemies of the League of Antares, the Julians,
and just about anyone else you care to mention, but that was no reason to
turn them into the archetypical bad guys portrayed in James Malisewski\'s
Challenge articles <snff, snff>...:)

If you\'re interested in seeing any of the ARC articles, the best person
to contact is Clayton Bush of HIWG (as my copies of the Antares archives
are about 100 miles away at the moment). Clay\'s address is:-

  	Clayton R. Bush

I\'ve had a few inquiries (one of which I lost) so I\'ll post a general
message.
	The Cherryh List is maintained through "jaymin@maths.tcd.ie".
Send mail there asking to be subscribed. It is distributed more or
less daily and maintains an archive on walton.maths.tcd.ie in the
pub/jaymin/cherryh directory.
	There are several items that might be of interest to traveller
players there. There are several GIF pictures from the covers of
various novels and games. There is a version of rules for the
StarChase game and a Windows Cherryh Ship Design program (quite strongly
based on the MegaTraveller ship design rules :-). There are a few
star maps and lists of ship designations.
	For those who aren\'t familiar with Cherryh, her SF universe
(known as Union/Alliance/Compact) is quite similar to traveller. The
ships take a long time to jump between stars and information travels
at the same speed. There are even furry cats with gender distinctions
very similar to Aslan. What hit me hardest when first reading her is
"This *feels* like Traveller". I really don\'t know if Cherryh had an
influence on early Traveller or early Traveller had an influence on
Cherryh (or if it is all some vast coincidence).
	On the list some topics of interest are the mechanics of her ships,
how one might run a game in her setting, and general ship design
and fleet use strategy.
	[Just to clear up some confusion, my mailing address is
technically "jaymin@maths.tcd.ie". I am now working for Lotus, Ireland
and have e-mail at work: "jo_grant.lotusint.lotus@crd.lotus.com". At
the moment sending to jaymin reflects to jo_grant (and thus I get
it twice). If you have a quick query and are fond of typing long
addresses go ahead and mail jo_grant. Otherwise send most things
to jaymin. And yes, both of us are really Jo Jaquinta. I\'ve taken
Grant as a married name which is much easier to deal with in Ireland!]

That\'s what will happen to a large Cray Mainframe if you take away the
cooling unit.  Check it out, many of CRI\'s early patents are for
spiffy *cooling* technology.

loan this to a friend" factor is a major disincentive developers, since it
eats up most of whatever few prospective sales you might have had in the
first place. (I know this was in the minds of Digest Group back when they
were working on their disk set; did that ever come to market, or did they
shift focus before it came out?)


Of course, when you throw in the problem of multiple disk formats and
different platforms, for goshsakes, there\'s almost no reason at all for
somebody with even a fair amount of resources (i.e. TSR) would spend them
making software they can\'t make money on anyway.  If you can make them for
proprietary platforms, like Nintendo, then you get deals like SSI\'s games
for TSR, but otherwise even TSR, who can afford to do a bang-up job on
software if they like, won\'t touch the sinkhole of software tools...

Which leads us to the solution we\'ve all developed to deal with the above
dilemma: home-grown tools written by those with the dedication and skill
and most importantly, without the need for payment.   I haven\'t had a look
at the archives recently (i.e. in years), but last I saw nobody was even
trying to present their work as shareware or "please pay me if you like
it"-ware, though I know some of the stuff I\'ve seen was definitely of
commercial or better quality.  (Never mind the screen stuff, if someone
actually codes all the starship rules or worse yet, planetary system rules,
smooth enough to use them a lot, then that\'s a bang up job in my book!)

For those selfless souls who have spent so much time out of their love for
the game(s), I can only say bravo!  and thank you, and we can only hope
they and others will be willing to slough thru it all again for new
versions of our favorite games...

Gee, thanks Anthony! I was quite happy being a lurker until you went and
dragged me into the limelight :) ...

FYI, the work I did on Antares (must have been three or four years ago
now <sigh>) was based around the Antares Ring Confederation, a high-tech
Solomani/Vargr autonomous enclave in Sarar subsector (Antares F). OK, so
these guys were political enemies of the League of Antares, the Julians,
and just about anyone else you care to mention, but that was no reason to
turn them into the archetypical bad guys portrayed in James Malisewski\'s
Challenge articles <snff, snff>...:)

If you\'re interested in seeing any of the ARC articles, the best person
to contact is Clayton Bush of HIWG (as my copies of the Antares archives
are about 100 miles away at the moment). Clay\'s address is:-

I\'ve had a few inquiries (one of which I lost) so I\'ll post a general
message.
	The Cherryh List is maintained through "jaymin@maths.tcd.ie".
Send mail there asking to be subscribed. It is distributed more or
less daily and maintains an archive on walton.maths.tcd.ie in the
pub/jaymin/cherryh directory.
	There are several items that might be of interest to traveller
players there. There are several GIF pictures from the covers of
various novels and games. There is a version of rules for the
StarChase game and a Windows Cherryh Ship Design program (quite strongly
based on the MegaTraveller ship design rules :-). There are a few
star maps and lists of ship designations.
	For those who aren\'t familiar with Cherryh, her SF universe
(known as Union/Alliance/Compact) is quite similar to traveller. The
ships take a long time to jump between stars and information travels
at the same speed. There are even furry cats with gender distinctions
very similar to Aslan. What hit me hardest when first reading her is
"This *feels* like Traveller". I really don\'t know if Cherryh had an
influence on early Traveller or early Traveller had an influence on
Cherryh (or if it is all some vast coincidence).
	On the list some topics of interest are the mechanics of her ships,
how one might run a game in her setting, and general ship design
and fleet use strategy.
	[Just to clear up some confusion, my mailing address is
technically "jaymin@maths.tcd.ie". I am now working for Lotus, Ireland
and have e-mail at work: "jo_grant.lotusint.lotus@crd.lotus.com". At
the moment sending to jaymin reflects to jo_grant (and thus I get
it twice). If you have a quick query and are fond of typing long
addresses go ahead and mail jo_grant. Otherwise send most things
to jaymin. And yes, both of us are really Jo Jaquinta. I\'ve taken
Grant as a married name which is much easier to deal with in Ireland!]

That\'s what will happen to a large Cray Mainframe if you take away the
cooling unit.  Check it out, many of CRI\'s early patents are for
spiffy *cooling* technology.

I\'ve been reading the archives of the Beta test group.  I noticed someone
was designing a *large* rifle.  In the 15mm range.  From what I remember,
*large* weapons were coming out much bigger than their real-life counter-
parts.  Is that still true or did GDW come up with a fix?

  If the 15mm rifle came out fairly close to what the designer was looking
for, I\'d like to hear about it.  I just finished re-reading Pournelle\'s
Falkenberg\'s Legion books and noticed the 15mm sniper rifle used by the
Royal Spartan Army and their Helot foes.  The 15mm rounds ignored the
`improved Kevlar\' used and was effective against light armored vehicles.
Does the FF&S designs live up to this?

The most important aspect in the book is that electronic life doesn\'t
have to ANY values that we can relate with.  What we might consider as
hate the elcetronic life form might just see as a need for more surface
area for power collection...

The most chilling part of electronic life forms would be their speed of
action relative to us oganics.  Consider, computer clock speeds keep
increasing.  The upper limit of this is probably the speed of light with
exotic \'light switches\' functioning as circuits.  By TL 15 Mr. Computer
while not quite self aware is fast enough to run very convincing
simulations of real intelligence.  I assume that the virus must be even
faster than Mr. Computer.  A poor analogy of how fast the Virus must be
is that the Virus is as fast to organics as we are to plants....

Hmmmm...  All I know about Cray power consumption is that it uses alot,
but I don\'t have a scale for that.  Considering the one we have takes up
about 1 "Traveller" Ton of Displacement, it seems like a larger one
would suck up alot of juice.  It\'s a scale thing for me.  What can you
do with a megawatt of electricity?  Here at MIT I see "Blah Megawatt

Around 400,000 Kw per month?  That\'s based upon just the CPU, not

for those of us not particularly familiar with real-life weapon
diameters (or at least not in millimeters) could you put this into
context please?

I *thought* that a 30-06 rifle had a round 6/10ths of an inch in
diameter (this doesn\'t sound right to me).  That would make it
(using my thumbnail approximation of 25 mm to an inch) about
15mm diameter.  This can\'t be right if your talking about 15mm
being a *large* rifle, I assume your talking about an elephant rifle,
not a deer rifle.  Could someone please correct me?

It would also be helpful to me if someone could post a list of standard \'real\'
weapon calibers and show their diameter in mm (ie. .357 Magnum=XXmm pistol).

btw, if anyone is looking for a source of less than usual weapons for a
traveller campaign, I\'ve always used the weapons from Traveller 2300.  There
are several combined weapons (ie gauss rifle/grenade launcher), they can be
easily translated in game terms, and they have great pictures for every
weapon.  Keep in mind though that they are at tech level 11 or 12.

Of course, I was always a fan of the very thin very high velocity round
which should have a better penetration than any large (non-explosive) round
in any case.  It will also, of course, do less damage (which is why you fire
a three round burst, or full auto)

I also wonder about how ff&s handles recoil for these *large* rifles.

It\'s really hard to be sure.  The publication dates for Pride of Chanur
*STRADDLE* the publication date The Journal of the Travellers\' Aid Society
#7, which contains the first description of the Aslan.  That is, the
portions of the book that were published serially came out before
JTAS#7, while the book was published after.

I\'d conclude that any similarities (and there are quite a few) between
the Hani and that early Aslan article are probably coincidental ...

However, I wouldn\'t doubt that since then Cherryh\'s books, as popular
and well-read as they are, haven\'t had some effect on the later
development of the Aslan (it would be hard not to).

As far as the overall "feel" of the game and books go, the similarity
is probably deliberate, but not in the way that you might think.  Cherryh
writes an awfully good SF tale, and in many ways it reminds me of the
masters of "Space Opera" updated to the present; in this respect Cherryh is
(IMHO) successor to the likes of "Doc" Smith, Heinlien, Clarke, Asimov, and
company.  Since Traveller was designed to create the same sort of
"atmosphere" present in those SF classics, it\'s no suprise that they
came out "feeling" the same.

As a one-sentance description, I sometimes sum up the Aslan for new players
as "Imagine a race of Hani females and Kzin males ..."  This isn\'t really
very fair to the Aslan, but it\'s about as good as you can do in one
sentance.

OK, the largest caliber sniper rifles currently in use today (the RAI
Model 500 and the Barrett Light .50) fire the .50 Browning round (the
same shell used in a Browning .50 caliber heavy machinegun of WWII
fame).  That\'s a 1/2 inch diameter slug, which works out to 12.7mm.

The largest caliber American centerfire cartridge ever produced (and
now obsolete) is (was) the 70-150 Winchester.  Developed as a novelty
in 1888, it was based on a brass 12-gauge shotgun shell, which was
shortened and necked slightly.  A specially manufactured Winchester
1887 shotgun (with a rifled barreled) was created to fire it.  Neither
the weapon or the shell were ever produced in commercial quantities.
It would have been considered a 17.9mm rifle.  Ouch.

The largest sporting round currently in production is a proprietary
(wildcat) cartridge called the 700 Nitro Express.  It includes a slug
that is .7 inches in diameter (making it a 17.78mm weapon) and, as
the name implies, being shot with it is like being hit by a train.
There\'s not much recognizeable left afterwards.  With a muzzle velocity
of 2000 fps and a muzzle energy of 8900 fpe, it is the most powerful
sporting cartridge in the world.

> I *thought* that a 30-06 rifle had a round 6/10ths of an inch in

You\'re right, it *isn\'t* right. :^)  The 30-06 U.S. Springfield (as
the round is formally described) uses a slug .308 inches in diameter,
which would make it a 7.8mm rifle in MT terms.

Done.  See above. :^)

Sure.  Here are some of the more common handgun calibers (for weapons
not already described in millimeters):
        .22*      = 0.223mm (*=short, long & long-rifle)
        .25 ACP   = 6.38mm
        .32 ACP   = 7.85mm
        .380 ACP  = 9.04mm
        .38 Spec. = 9.07mm
        .357 Mag. = 9.07mm
        .40 S&W   = 10.16mm
        .41 Mag.  = 10.41mm
        .44 Mag.  = 10.9mm
        .45 ACP   = 11.48mm
 ...and for centerfire rifle calibers:
        .243 Winchester      = 6.17mm
        .270 Winchester      = 7.04mm
        .30-30 Winchester    = 7.62mm
        .308 Winchester      = 7.62mm
        .458 Winchester Mag. = 11.63mm
        .460 Weatherby Mag.  = 11.63mm
        12-gauge shotgun     = 18.5mm (bore diameter, open choke)

Bare in mind that while one caliber may be equal to or larger than another,
it is by no means safe to assume that size equals power.  The .38 Special
and .357 Magnum handgun rounds use slug with identical diameters, but
the .357 is much more powerful.

In addition to the above rounds, we\'ve already got handgun rounds in
9mm and 10mm, plus rifle rounds in 5.56mm (NATO), 7mm, and 7.62mm (also
NATO).  There are others, but they tend to run towards the more exotic.

This may be true for infantry weapons, but for tanks, it\'s a different
story entirely.  The most effective anti-armor shell currently in use
by the U.S. Army\'s M1A2 MBT (main battle tank) is the 120mm APFSDS
(Armor-piercing, Fin-stabilized, Discarding-sabot) round.  It throws
a 10 lb. tungsten carbide \'flechette\' at almost 5,500 fps.  When it
hits enemy armor (BTW, it can penetrate up to 15" of steel), it drives
throw the plating, disintegrating as it goes.  By the time penetration
is complete, roughly 100 fragments (from the dart and enemy tank hull)
over 1 oz. each, plus over 600 smaller fragments, are moving inside
the target at velocities still in excess of 2,800 fps.  What happens
to the enemy tank crew at that point is best left to the imagination
(although I do have a document that details the results, if anyone
is morbid enough to care.)

At a guess, I\'d say it has to do with the market and the whole profit
motive thing.  After all, if you\'re publishing Traveller stuff (or D&D
stuff or ShadowRun stuff or GURPS stuff) you are greatly dependent upon
the "parent" company to keep the game alive.  Plus, you will make less
than the parent because you have to pay them to sell stuff for their
game.  You can (I assume) make more money writing and distributing your
own game instead of supplements for someone elses.
	Why did it happen in the first place?  Because Gaming wasn\'t
quite the Industry that it is now.  Because some people were just
dedicated to the hobby.  Face it -- if you\'re publishing supplements in
your spare time and you start to get successful at it, wouldn\'t you like
to make it into a full-time job?  The best way would be to increase
profit and make your game company self-sufficient (ie, not dependent upon
another gaming company for policy...)  <Shrug>  Just my theory...

Generally, weapons are measured in hundreths of an inch (.50= ~half an inch)

multipy the metric by 4 and shift the decimall two places to the left;
5.56mm =~.223.

As for examples:
	9mm=very accurate, pretty powerful pistol round. Also used in many
SMGs (like the Uzi).
	10mm, 11mm=major power; these are the guns that will knock a large
hole in you and knock you down to boot.
	7.62mm: fired from the M60 and many other light-mid sized machineguns
used by the US and most of NATO.
	5.56mm: used in the M16 and other Western weapons (like the M249
SAW).
	5.45: Used by Eastern European forces in their assault rilfes and

More, but I have little time.

I don\'t know what the final rules look like, but GDW was looking
at that part of the design and considering changes.  One change
that they almost certainly made was to base receiver length on the
"average" energy (and not actual energy), which for these long, heavy
guns would reduce the mass of the receiver somewhat.  One fix
that was suggested was to use a different basis for computing the
receiver mass; I don\'t know if this change was made official or not.

See below.  I "designed" a WWII-era Soviet weapon that will punch
pretty effective holes in most personal armor.  I\'m certain that any
changes to FF&S since the draft I was using wouldn\'t change the damage
or penetration of the weapon, so you can use the "real world" values
for the weapon (included below) and the FF&S-generated game statistics
to put this weapon in your games now.

Sure.  The short answer is that the caliber of the weapon is the
diameter of the projectile, in inches or millimeters.  Therefore,
a .30-06 is 0.30 inches in diamater (that\'s 3/10ths).  The 15mm
rifle would be fire a 0.591 inch projectile (25.4mm = 1inch).  That\'s
nearly twice the diameter of the .30-06.

Actually, we\'re talking about a military weapon, and it bears little
resemblance to either a deer rifle or an elephant rifle.  Historically,
this class of rifle was designed in the late 30\'s and early 40\'s in an
attempt to design an infantry weapon that could penetrate the armor of
a tank.  Tank armor rapidly outstripped the ability of small-arms to
penetrate, and in general the weapons were used agains unarmored or lightly
armored vehicles, or agains infantry under cover, and the weapons fell out
of use.

Relatively recently, similar designs have been used as long-range sniper
rifles.  The large bullet, fired at high velocity from a long barrel, as
a very flat trajectory and is less affected by wind, making accurate long
range fire possible.  On the GDW-Beta discussion group, I took one of the
WWII era weapons, and someone else did a modern one.

In many cases, the cartirdge these weapons fire was used in large
machineguns as well, and has the same general characteristics; although
the muzzle velocity is a little higher due to the longer barrel of the
sniper or anti-tank weapon.  Note that *both* of these calibers are larger
than the US .50 caliber (12.7mm) M2HB machinegun.

Sure.  Here\'s a table that gives dimensions in mm, and the "common name" of
just about every round that was readily available for research.  You can
figure out the diameter in inches by dividing the size in mm by 25.4 (this
is an exact conversion).  I also listed some of the more common weapons that
use this ammunition, in the hopes that either the common name or a weapon name
would provide a memory handle you can use to relate everything.  Pistol and
rifle rounds are listed together on the list; you will notice that pistols
generally have shorter cartridges, though.

The "Designation" follows the NATO standard for such things, and is simply
the diameter of the projectile by the length of the cartridge case, both
measured in millimeters.  So, the .357 Magnum is 9mm in diameter, and the
cartridge case is 33mm long.  The letters at the end of the designation
indicate the style of the rim at the base of the cartridge.  No letter is
a standard rimless cartridge as used in most modern designs (rimless
cartridges feed better through belts and magazines).  A "R" indicates a
rimmed cartridge, which is a very old style and commonly found only in
revolvers.  "SR" indicates a semi-rimmed round; this is a compromise between
the easier extraction of a rimmed case and the easier feeding of the rimless
design.  A "B" indicates a belted case, used on very powerful rounds to
give the cartridge extra strength.  And last (but not least) a "C" indicates
a caseless round.

> I also wonder about how ff&s handles recoil for these *large* rifles.

FF&S computes recoil based on the muzzle energy of the round and the total
mass of the gun (and a couple of other factors thrown in for good measure).
Since these guns are quite heavy (even without the draft
rules making them heavier than they would be otherwise), the recoil comes
out fairly low, particularly considering how much damage they do.  Then again,
these large rifles are designed to be fired while stationary, from a bipod.


Here is the rifle I promised earlier.  Take the FF&S figures with a grain
of salt, because I was using a draft of the rules; the final rules will
probably do much better.  To use this weapon in your games now, take
the values from the "Real World" column.  When you need information that\'s
not there (like price in credits) refer over to the FF&S column.  Note
that the FF&S column includes information on a (hypothetical) TL-8 discarding
sabot round which was never actually manufactured for this gun.  This
might be a particularly interesting twist on the gun; there\'s no reason why
DS ammunition *shouldn\'t* work ...

No longer do your TL-5, xenophobic natives have to cower in fear of
Reformation Coalition backed Star Vikings.  Have the local warlord call
up a few squads of these "poor man\'s fusion guns".  With Ball ammunition
(locally producable at TL-5), they can penetrate TL-10 Battle Dress and
any Combat Armor.

With DS ammunition (a TL-8 item), these weapons have damage and penetration
equal to (or better than, particularly at longer ranges) the FGMP-14 and
FGMP-15 and can effectively defeat all forms of personal armor, as well as
the side, deck, belly, and turret armor of the G-Carrier and the Grav Tank.
Given their relative low cost, particularly when compared to their high-tech
opponents Battle Dress (Cr220,000) and Fusion Gun (Cr54,000), these weapons
are clearly very cost-effective.

Notes:
1 - Whenever two figures are given, the first is for ball (an option for
Armor-Piercing Incendiary would have been nice) and the second is for the
"high-tech" (TL-8) Discarding Sabot round.
2 - Figuring the internal magazine as a box magazine that\'s permanently
attached to the weapon.  I\'m also using the grams to kilograms "fix" that
I mentioned in my first weapon design.

Comments: Yes, this really was a real gun.  Originally designed as a man
portable, anti-tank small arms rifle by the Soviets during WWII, the gun
was quickly outclassed by the rapidly improving armor protection of
German tanks.  The cartridge lives on as the ammuntion for the TL-6 KPV
machinegun (found on many Soviet armored vehicles and anti-aircraft
defenses).  The gas-operated action of this rifle (scaled down, of course)
found its way into the SKS rifle.

Tactical Considerations:
The close range of this weapon exceeds the extreme range of every fusion
gun except the FGMP-14 and -15, and the short range equals or exceeds the
extreme range of any of the fusion guns.  The best use of these weapons
would be long-range fire at the attackers, from behind cover (preferably
cover strong enough to resist an extreme-range fusion gun strike) or
sniping from outside the range of their weapons.  If this is impossible
(and it frequently is), then a series protected positions likeley to suprise
the enemy are good (around a corner in a corridor, for example).

Game Use:
This weapon (or rather, one using the "real world" stats and not the FF&S
design, which is completely impractical) could be quite useful to anti-RC
forces in the New Era.  A relatively low-tech design, it is quite capable
of being manufactured by many worlds in the Wilds.  Although the DS
ammunition is probably going to be considerably harder to produce, there
will probably be a number of worlds equipped with it.  As Star Viking
activities expand, it is very likeley that traders operating in the wilds
will find a demand for this type of weapon.

Several adventure plotlines are possible around this weapon; one which
suggests itself to me is probably obvious.  The players (RCES or \'Lancers)
attempt a smash-n-grab on some TL-5 to TL-7 dictator.  They expect an easy
time of it.  Pull this one on your players after they\'ve done two or three
of the same type of missions in a row and have had a chance to get
overconfident and complacent.  Suprise them with the weapon; without the DS
ammunition, it shouldn\'t be too deadly, but should (if employed well) be
able to prevent the PCs from accomplishing some or all of their objectives.
Drive home to them in a practical sort of way how difficult their lives
would be if lots of worlds had them.  Later developments in the campaign can
involve efforts to stop free traders from spreading the guns (or the designs)
around the area.  Another one might have to do with discovering that someone
is producing DS ammunition.

	Been quiet for a while, so I thought I\'d return and ask another question:


	There\'s been a little talk about weapon calibres, and I believe that
someone mentioned (Sorry, I have forgotten the name. Damn! No undelete!) that
10mm and 11mm weapons were killer, mess you up, knock you down, etc... guns.
So, like, does anyone have any MT writeups on some of these babies?

	I already have most of the released portions of Bertil\'s Machinetools

everything in WP (Maybe Latex later on if I can afford the manual 8-> ) and
think that it would be neat to have some other designs. All credit will be

So what I want to know is this, what races in the Traveller universe would
make the most of the collapse of the Imperium?  I think some races would be
better prepared than humanity since they probably had a lower (in some cases
much lower) tech level than the Imperium.  Some races would probably be
working with humans to rebuild, others would see it as divine deliverance,
and others would want what was unattainable to their people (Mogwa from
The Last of the Mohicans is an example).  There could even be pocket empires
of races that have attained jump drive from previous Imperial technology.
As a newcomer to Traveller, I don\'t know much about alien races in the game,
so any info, especially about races in or near the Old Expanses, would be
appreciated.

 True. Also, I believe aircraft were largely made one at a time
 until the 1930s (when Lindberg wanted a plane, he went to Ryan
 and they built it for him...albeit according to a standard
 pattern, modified to suit his individual requirements...pretty
 much the way George Washington would have bought a carriage).

 The way Hans has it set up, however, standardized parts would
 seem to be out the window, so it looks to me like repairmen are
 pretty much going to have to fabricate replacement parts from
 scratch.

 1C means that the ammunition\'s penetration is a constant 1
 throughout its range, that is, that is, it does not vary with the
 distance the round has travelled. For small arms this is
 sometimes written as 1-1-1.

 This is called blunt trauma (Traveller: TNE page 285), and it
 counts towards wound effects such as knockdown, initiative loss,
 and so on. A weapon with a damage of 4 and penetration of 1
 hitting an AV of 4 would not penetrate, but would do 4 points of
 damage nevertheless.

  HEAP, with a penetration of 1 should lose 1 point of damage for
 each level of armor it penetrates.
 From TNE, page 285: "Multiply the target\'s armor protection by
 the weapon\'s penetration value, and subtract the result from the
 weapon\'s damage value." A snub pistol HEAP round (at any range)
 has a penetration of 1C (or 1-1-1) and a damage of 2. Vest\'s AV
 of 1 times Penetration of 1 = 1, and 2-1 = 1 damage die per round
 (that much math I am capable of doing without a calculator!).
 If you hit the guy 5 times in the vest (chest or abdomen hits)
 this should have done 5 dice of damage (5D6 damage points) plus 5
 points of blunt trauma (in this case, 1 point per round that
 didn\'t penetrate, see also p. 285). 5D6 will average 17.5 (3.5*5
 = 17.5), plus 5 = 22.5. If they are chest hits, each hit die
 causes a test under the provision of the Quick Kill rule (in this
 case, five D20 rolls for 2 or less, what\'s that...a 40% chance of
 croaking from Quick Kill alone?). For abdomen hits, the Quick
 Kill rule doesn\'t apply (chest or head hits only).

 (All of this assumes you didn\'t get a conspicuous success in
 one of the To Hit die rolls...if so, you do double damage.)

 If the hits taken in a single turn exceed the character\'s
 Agility, the character is knocked down (if all 22.5 hit the
 target in one turn, even the strongest character will be arsey-
 varsey) and can\'t conduct any actions for the rest of the turn.
 This should enable you to clog-dance on his/her neck or put a
 couple rounds point-blank into the body part of your choice (or
 get a head start at running away, if you\'ve a mind).

 Now, as for wound effects, this will vary with the attributes
 of the target character, but the first time a character is
 wounded (1 point is enough) that character loses his/her next
 action. If the hits all go into the abdomen, the average
 character will be seriously wounded by 22.5 points. If they all
 go into the chest, 22.5 will cause a slight wound. Just for
 comparison, 22.5 hits in the head would be a Critical wound, and
 result in immediate death, 22.5 hits in an arm or leg would be a
 serious wound.

 A Serious wound means that a character has to make a D100 roll
 against their Constitition to stay conscious, and repeat this
 roll every turn in which they wish to conduct any action(s). A
 Serious wound also reduces the character\'s strength by half, and
 knocks 2 points off of their initiative (in addition to the
 initiative reduction for slight wound, for a total of 3). Serious
 wounds in a limb cause the character to lose the use of that
 limb.

  A. In the same direction as the bullet is travelling.
  B. In the opposite direction from that the bullet is travelling.

  Our original laser penetration research was based on some SDI
 documents, which indicated that small lasers (along the lines of
 what we are talking about for small arms) were very poor
 penetrators. Further investigation indicates that they are poor
 penetrators against metal and other dense materials.

 One of the experimental rules we are playing around with is to
 make lasers ignore all non-metallic/ceramic/hard armor, meaning
 they will go through ballistic cloth like it isn\'t there, but
 will be stopped by battledress and the like. This is for lasers
 only (not plasma/fusion weapons).

Curiously enough, the game stats you produced are remarkably similar to
those of the Twilight:2000 stats for the current version (i.e. 1980s) of
the same historical weapon (T2K calls it the "PK-14" or some such...)

I wonder if maybe FF&S is intended to use the same formulae that GDW used
for the T2K 2nd edition rules (I seem to remember Frank Chadwick talking at
GenCon about setting up specific conversion formulas for the 2nd ed, based
on "real world data" like ejection velocity, etc.)...

As for a DS round, sounds pretty neat (and suitably nasty, talk about
shredding Combat Armor!) -- just don\'t tell any Twilight players about
it...  *grin*

I wonder if they looked at you strangely because you were asking about
MW per day or kW per month? :-)

As far as I know, Watts are a measure of power, which is how much energy
moves around per unit time.  The machine doesn\'t use 400,000 kW per month.
It uses 400,000 kW, which by definition is 400,000 kJ per second, or about
1 million MJ per month.  J is Joules, a measure of energy.

The only way that "kW per month" might make sense is if the power consumption
changes regularly, e.g. if you buy a new disc drive every month.

Or have the laws of physics changed while I\'ve been sleeping? :-)

 Power Consumption for a 1 Traveller Displacement Ton computer was given as
  400 000 kW/month, therefore 13.33 mW/day. The units are not exactly correct,
  just like the GDW source material in fact, which confuses Joules and Watts
  all over the place (they\'ve got better, but they still switched them around
  at least once in the Challenge 71 Lasers articles I think).

 I\'m sure the original 400 000 kW/month means something in the real world,
  could someone elaborate? (my guess is they meant kW/hours not kW, which
  gives a 0.555 mW power consupmtion which is \'distinctly non-trivial\' as my
  tutor once said)

 Overall I think I\'ll stick to Energy Points, at least you know what the units
  are :)

 From the comments on the TML it looks like FFS is going to be quite good,
  if it turns out VERY good I might even be tempted to start using the T2000
  rules, but probably not. I have problems with TNE because I don\'t like the
  background, I don\'t like the system, and I don\'t like the graphics style....

I\'ve not purchased a single Traveller product since "Survival Margin",
as I\'m not interested in either moving to a game system, or in
abandoning the Imperium.  Thus, I\'ve no experience with the "Brilliant
Lances" product for Traveller:TNE.  I *am* however, curious to know
where the idea for this Manta \'fuel skimmer\' design originated, since
I designed almost *exactly* the same ship (with the same class name)
for the TML PBEM over TWO YEARS AGO.  (I have the dated electronic
archives to prove it.)  I also find it convienently coincidental that
the clipper it supports is named after *another* starship in the very
same long-running (5 years), international Traveller PBEM, created by
Richard Johnson, and currently run by Mike Metlay and myself.

It looks to me as though someone took the original (PBEM) Manta gas
mining ships and modified the designs to use the new TNE ship design
rules.

Where *exactly* did Dave (Nilsen, I assume) get these ideas?

Although the technology was not identical, The novel "Glory Road"

Also (of course) the Hammer series by David Drake beginning with
"Hammers Slammers" and going on to less memorable titles-perfect
for someone needing inspiration for a mercenary-type campaign.  Don\'t
look for a complex plot in these though.

There were a pair of novels, one called "Insurrection", which gave a
great picture of a large scale empire ("democracy") tearing itself
apart.  As I recall the fringe worlders were rebelling against the
central-worlders control of the government.  Not a lot of small-party
level action, but great space battles (find out what a "spinal Mount"
missile is...), and one look at politics conducted across large amounts
of space. (I can\'t remember the other title or the author, sorry).

Asimov\'s Foundation Trilogy (and then some..) is a bit more cerebral
by comparison, but are great books.

There\'s my suggestions (opinions provided free of charge!).

Hi All,

Now that I\'ve had a chance to use BL for a while, I really think it is a great
improvement over MT.  I know I trashed some aspects of it previously, but I\'ve
made it past those constraints.  I\'m still hoping FF&S will permit me to fix
things.  Having the benefit of Loren "not Weisman" Wiseman on the TML helped me
perservere until I grasped the new system. It is nice to know what is errata
and what is obscure. In the later department please consider the following:

I have a question concerning grav/contragrav vehicles.  What has really changed
from CT & MT to TNE.  I always thought grav created a force which could be used
for propulsion when it pushed around in a gravity well. The force became less
effective as the gravity became less.  In TNE, the contragrav appears to negate
up to 99% of gravitational forces.  Does this cause any changes in how vehicles
can move.

Is any of what I\'ve assumed true?  Has there been any change at all?  I had the
impression that grav actually imparted some maneuver capability.

Every time I think about this MY BRAIN HURTS.


TTFN

The way contra-gravity was explained in T:TNE always amused me.  If 99% of of the gravity acting on the object was negated, wouldn\'t
the object fly off in a direction that corresponded to the orbital velocity of the planet, orbital velocity of the solar system
about the galaxy, and possibly the velocity of the galaxy through the universe...???  Keep in mind that without
gravity these objects wouldn\'t be running around in an elipse, or any path other then a straight line.

Anyone out there familiar with universal gravitional attraction?

Never heard of either format, so I probably can\'t use them, but who knows!

While I\'m here, I too was confused by computer power ratings given as
`Mw/day\', etc.  Maybe Mwday was intended, i.e. energy equivalent to
drawing 1 Mw of power for a whole day (about 86400 MJ).

Would anyone be interested in the novel which I am currently completing?
It\'s based upon a starship hijack scenario I ran 5 years ago with two groups
of three players each, one lot the hijackers, the other the government.
It was very loosely based upon the hijack scenario from White Dwarf 5-6 years
ago, but set in my own ship, own subsector, etc. At the time the players
enjoyed the game so much that I promised them I\'d write it up properly (fool
that I was).

It\'s getting towards a proper paperback size (not just random jottings!) and
I was going to have a look around in a few months time to see if anyone wanted
to publish it. Would GDW be interested, do you think? I\'d like to get
something out of it, because it\'s taken a *?%$!! lot of effort and time.

If anyone has any advice on how I can become rich selling the rights to this
book, I\'d be interested to hear from them.

Thanks

	A little while ago, someone (whose name I forget, big surprise) put out
an article on Jump Drives which detailed the actual components of the jump
drive and their relative size (and cost) compared to each other. One notable
entry in all this was the High Yield Fusion Plant, which appeared to put out
650 times the output of it\'s counterpart on the Power Source table in MT
ship design rules. I was wondering how these calculations came about, and
in particular where this all leads with the concept of maybe using Antimatter
to fuel a jump drive. Would it be worth someone\'s time to consider such an
animal.

	If so, what would a High Yield Antimatter Reactor put out in MW? If we
go by the previous multiplier, we get 325,000 MW output. Per Kl. Whoa!

	So have any Guru\'s out there got an opinion on this one?

This is as far as I know a big change from MT (where grav vehicles flw
round on thruster plates or some such -- all they needed were power
plants). I think Classic Traveller didn\'t mention anything about the
technical details -- starships had manoeuvre drives which allowed ships
to move around in normal space and could have been rockets or rock-
slingers or gravitic drives.

I find this kind of retcon a big problem -- an awful lot of background
and existing flavour and maybe history needs to be modified because of
this, although I believe most of this dates from the MT days. I always
regarded the ability to direct gravitic forces as one of the reasons
why we had small fusion power plants: they used a grav generator
running off a "spark plug" to initiate the fusion reaction.

This is one of the reasons why I haven\'t yet done anything with TNE --
there\'s an awful lot of background to fill in first (particularly since
I\'m not too keen on the post-Virus background anyway). Another problem
is that I got a bunch of blank pages in my copy of TNE -- one of these
days I\'m going ot sort out replacements for them (in fact, if I post a
list of the missing pages, could some kind soul send me some
photocopies?). To GDW\'s credit, this is the first time I\'ve ever seen
any production problems with their stuff.

  Melissa Scott has an earlier trilogy which, though it uses "magic"
instead of technology, is very Traveller-esque.  These three books
are:
  Five-Twelfths of Heaven
  Silence in Solitude
  The Empress of Earth

  These books had been collected by the SF Book Club as "The Roads of
Heaven", but they no longer offer it, and the paperbacks aren\'t really
common either, but they are worth the search, in my opinion.


Other books to look for:

  The "Angel\'s Luck" trilogy by Joe Clifford Faust.  Consists of
"Desperate Measures", "Precious Cargo" and "The Essence of Evil".

  "Antares Dawn" and "Antares Passage" by Michael McCollum.

  "Brightsuit MacBear" and "Taflak Lysandra" by L. Neil Smith.  The
rest of his Confederacy books are fun as well, but not really in the
nature of Traveller.  These are "The Probability Broach", "Nagasaki
Vector", "The Venus Belt", "Tom Paine Maru", "Their Majesties
Bucketeers", and "The Gallatin Divergence".

  The Barrayar books by Lois McMaster Bujold: "Shards of Honor",
"Barrayar", "The Warrior\'s Apprentice", "The Vor Game", "Ethan of Athos",
"Borders of Infinity", "Brothers in Arms", and the far-prequel "Falling
Free".  I highly recommend the whole set.

  "The Heart of the Comet" by Benford and Brin.

  "The McAndrew Chronicles" by Charles Sheffield.

  "On Basilisk Station" by David Weber.  There may by others in this
series that I am unaware of.

  "Starrigger", "Paradox Alley", and "Red Limit Freeway" by John
DeChancie.

  The Skyrider series by Melisa Michaels: "First Battle", "Last War",
"Pirate Prince", "Skirmish", and "Floater Factor".

  Jefferson Swycaffer\'s Concordat series, for which I don\'t have a
comlete list.

  Poul Anderson\'s Terran Empire (or "Flandry") series and his
Polesotechnic League (or "Falkayn & van Rijn") series, which are
connected by a mutual timeline, and the "Psychotechnic League"
series, which stands alone.

  Larry Niven\'s Known Space (Ringworld et al.).

  Alan Dean Foster\'s Humanx Commonwealth (or "Flinx") series.

  Brian Daley\'s "Requiem for a Ruler of Worlds", "Jinx on a Terran
Inheritance", and "Fall of the White Ship Avatar".  Good stuff.

  E.C.Tubb\'s Dumarest of Terra serial (LOTS of books).

  Most of Andre Norton\'s SF, notably the Dane Thorson cycle:
"Sargasso of Space", "Plague Ship", "Voodoo Planet", "Postmarked the
Stars" as well as the stand-alone "Star Guard".


  Whew!  That\'s enough.

    'body' => '> 400,000 Kw/month = 400 MW/month = 13.33 MW a day

This sounds more like a rate of power consumption change.  `MW\'
is a measure of power consumption, so what is `MW per day\'?

Do you mean `MW-hours per day\'?  Then 13 MW-hr/day would be about
0.5 MW.  No wonder it needs monster cooling systems!  Without cooling,
the temperature would probably rise toward about 500\'C until it
died.

Of course, this discussion is assuming that we are concerned with the
`supercomputer\' range.  What if you want something smaller?  What sort
of processing power can you get out of a 100W desktop computer at
various TLs?  I would find it quite conceivable to run a starship off
a computer that, in 2 TL or so, would be considered a `pocket\' computer.
Based on MegaTraveller, in which TL6 is ~1950, and TL8 is ~1990, this is
certainly the case.  The progression in the starship computer tables seems
*faster* at higher TLs, with a 2-fold increase in `maximum CP input\' and
30% increase in `CP multiplier\' from TL6 to TL8, but a jump of 2 TLs from
TL12 to TL14 gives a 100-fold increase in `maximum CP input\', and more
than 100% increase in CP multiplier.  Thus, if a pocket computer at TL8
is more than a match for the TL6 supercomputer, it would seem that a TL14
pocket computer should exceed the capabilities of a TL12 supercomputer by
an even greater amount.

This is partially borne out by the entry in the Imperial Encyclopedia,
where a TL11 hand computer "provides services of a supercomputer
(equivalent to Model/1 in computing power)".  Now, I would expect it to
be much better than that!  Model/1 is the 1950\'s supercomputer.  TL11 is
post-2100 projected technology (Meson guns, gravitic structures become
commonplace, Jump-2 drives, and reactionless thrusters).

Nevertheless, the precedent has been set - hand computers of higher TL
*can* serve as lower-TL supercomputers.  In MT, a vehicle needs to cost
more than ~50 MCr before it needs a Model/2.  For smaller vehicles, the
computer can take up a considerable amount of the power, space and cost
of the total.  So, just replace it with a TL11 hand computer, at 1/10000th
the volume, 1/1000th the mass, and 1/900th the cost, with negligible
power consumption.


(MT gripe: Have you noticed that TL12 `solar cells\' extract 60 times more
power from sunlight than is actually present?  Even TL6 cells extract 3
times more.  But that\'s cancelled out by the much-too-small surface areas
available for large ships.)

Subject: Just a NIT


   Is anyone else having problems reading the postings from
   fok@scf.usc.edu  (and a few other posters)?

   I realise its probably a deficiency with my mail reader but it works fine
   for 99.999% of my other TML mail.  Is fok using an editor that doesn\'t put
   in a hard carriage return - line feed as it wraps lines?

   Long sentences/paragraphs seem to be a single line disappearing
   off to the right of my screen and unless I extract the message to my
   favourite editor and cut the line up I can\'t read the message.

   I would like to read these messages, after all your trying to say
   something that\'s worth reading, but I find myself unwilling to take the
   time and trouble to do the extraction and edit, so the posting is
   simply ignored.

   To those with an editor like fok\'s, if you want me and anyone else who
   is having this problem to read your postings could you please try and
   hit that ENTER/RETURN key a bit more often.

   If anyone else is reading their TML from within a VAX/VMS ALLIN1 editor
   and has found a way to read these long lines would you contact me with
   your words of wisdom.

   Is there any way of massaging soft returns at the TML distributor before
   they get posted?

   Thanks.

Hello All:

	It\'s me again. Finally after a long time (and considerable neglect on my
part) the MT Animal Encounter Table Generator has made it to the TML. It
currently resides in the /pub/traveller/software under the name "animal.exe".

	Be not confused! This file is actually a self-extracting zip-archive!
Just run it in a directory where you feel confident that the excess files will
not be a burden and you will have all the C source code, an executable version
and my rather well crafted .doc file. Okay, my rather hastily slapped together
 .doc file.

	Note to all turbo C guru\'s... The executable has been compiled to be
compatible with as many PC\'s as possible, using the 8088/8086 instruction
set. If you should wish to take advantage of your system\'s resources, you
may re-compile at your liesure the file anigen.c . It should take care of the
rest.

	Anyway, thanks to James, Dan, Loren and everyone who helped me out on
this by answering my little questions along the way. Hope it\'s useful!

	Anthony

Hi All,

I\'d like to clarify my post concerning contragrav/grav.  If contragrav negates
up to 99% of gravitational forces it would have to do so as a vector
cancellation. You could cancel the gravity of the mainworld but the sun and any
moons would still affect you. You could lift a vessel into orbit using the
rotational velocity of the mainworld. (I believe this was the intention of using
it on starships.)

This brings up some interesting problems. The "High Guard" situation is gone
forever. Attention - Major Retcon !! There is no gravity well to hamper you
during refueling. Just hit the contragrav and boost out at your maximum
G-rating. Worry free wilderness refueling. In my opinion, this situation used
to have the exact flavor of the traveller experience that I tried to achieve.
What are they trying to do, drive the corsairs out of business?

On the other hand, what better way to deploy carried craft or missles than to
enter a low altitude orbit with lots of orbital velocity, deploy everything,
and turn on the contragrav to fling everything into place. No wasted G-turns,
everything is saved for the coming conflict. With the versatility of missles
in TNE, I\'d like to try that trick.

It also seems that there should be some kind of energy balance going on. If a
ship is in orbit, it has a certain amount of kinetic and potential energy.
By changing altitude, energy is tranferred. Contragrav seems to allow you to
change the reference point and get energy from nowhere. Again this all depends
on the interpretation of the technology, I may be completely of base.

Still, it\'s something to think about.

I just finished re-reading Alan Dean Foster\'s _Cyber_Way_ (at my usual reading

One of the most interesting aspects of the novel, as it applies to Traveller is
WRT how primitive societies (TL1-TL8+) deal with left-over artifacts of TL25+.
I think that the basic plot devices could be easily adapted to a Traveller
campaign involving various "Secrets of the Ancients", and not even trigger too
many RetCon Alerts... :)

Picture a pre-virus universe.  Add an red-zoned system with a pre-jummp
tech-level, and evidence of vistation within the last couple of millenia from
an extremely advanced society.  Posit a technological regression from TL25 way
back to TL0 or TL1, and then a re-building over the last few thousand years,
with a strong oral tradition in the mean-time (unwittingly) describing access
to the artifact technology (or parts of it.)

Adventures could range in scope from the initial re-discovery of the ancient
ways to spy-type adventures on a balkanized planet, to interference from
the monitoring scouts that were acting on behalf of the Imperium, to something
akin to a missionary mission (in a post-virus galaxy) as the newly-found
technology aids the spread of the "primitive" culture\'s values across the
galaxy, to interaction with the ancients themselves, to...

Food for thought...

   Ah...the doublebarreled H&H .600 Nitro Express Elephant gun.  The
`Nitro\' because it used the new (at the time) smokeless powder.  GDW has
this written up in the Cadallics & Dinosaurs book and the Infantry Weapons
of the World book.  It\'s not what was being discussed though.
  The 15mm in question is a semi-auto snipers rifle.  The orginal intent
was for use against armor.  It uses modern cartridges with nice pointy
tipped bullets for better penatration.
  The rounds used in the .600 (15mm) Nitro Express were round nosed.
Made for shooting unarmored elephants.  The big, round slugs provided
more `knockdown\'.  In game terms the .600 Nitro Express rounds would have
a lower penatration value than the 15mm semiauto sniper rifle in question.
  The .600 Nitro Express is still a big nasty gun that hurts a lot over
long ranges.  Available at fairly low tech levels (late 4, early 5).
Even with the lower penatration, the `blunt trauma\' effect on this this
thing would be nasty (memory drags up a damage value of 7).  So even a
non-penatrating hit would do enough damage to knock most folks down.
One of the `features\' of GDW House Rules is even folks in Battle Dress
don\'t like to get shot by big guns.
  Speaking of which, shouldn\'t powered battle armor absorb a bit of blunt
trauma damage? Does it? I don\'t remember seeing that anywhere?  Hmm...
Since I\'m on the topic of armor anyway...I know that GDW threw out the
idea of reflec armor, but what about ablative?  I know it\'s big and bulky
and goes away quick...However I see that a method of keeping PCs from
lugging around a lot of other stuff and a steady drain on their cash flow.
Ablative should provide little to no protection from slug throwers or
plasma/fusion weapons.

20% of the the total power requirement is used to \'warm up\' the Lanthanum Hull
Grid.  The remaining 80% is used to actually enter jump space.

 To \'warm up\' Lanthanum Hull Grid:  0.65 MW X Jump # / kl of total ship volume
 To_enter_jump_space:_____________+_2.60_MW_X_Jump_#_/_kl_of_total_ship_volume
 Total power requirement:         = 3.25 MW X Jump # / kl of total ship volume

3.c._Jump_Governor______________________________________________________________
A dedicated computer system and accompaying connections.  The governor finely
regulates the transfer of energy from the High Yield Fusion Power Plant to the
Jump Energy Sinks, and thence to the Lanthanum Hull Grid.

3.d._Lanthanum_Hull_Grid________________________________________________________
A grid of Lanthanum wires implanted in the outer layer of the ship\'s hull,
spaced at about 1 meter intervals.  For design purposes, the grid is assumed to
occupy no volume and have no weight.  Installation of the Lanthanum grid does
not alter the hull armor rating.  Cost is Cr1500 per kilolitre of total ship
volume.

3.e._Jump_Energy_Sinks__________________________________________________________
These accumulate the energy produced by the High-Yield Fusion Power Plant, to
later release it rapidly into the Lanthanum Hull Grid during jump.  The sinks
hold 650 MW per kilolitre of energy sink.  It is also possible to install energy
sinks for use with a Black Globe.  They cost Cr300000 per kilolitre, but are
otherwise identical to Jump Energy Sinks.

The volume of energy sinks required can be computed as follows:

      V = P / 650

V = volume of energy sinks in kilolitres
P = power requirement of the jump drive in MW.

3.g._Time_to_charge_Energy_Sinks_______________________________________________
The process of jumping is essentially instantaneous.  Therefore, the primary
limitation on how rapidly one may jump is the time required to charge up the
energy sinks.  Should this time exceed two to three hours, the energy sinks may
suffer severe damage, initiating a process which concludes in the destruction of
the ship.

The time to charge energy sinks may be computed as follows:

  T = P X 60 / O

T = time to charge energy sinks in minutes.
P = power requirement on the jump drive in MW.
O = total power plant output in MW/hr.

3.h._Jump_Fuel__________________________________________________________________
All of the fuel consumed by the jump drive is consumed while charging the energy
sinks.  Once the vessel has entered jump, no more fuel is consumed by the jump
drive.

The amount of fuel consumed while charging the energy sinks may be computed as
folows:

  F = V X R X T / 60

F = volume of Jump Fuel in kilolitres.
V = volume of high-yield power plant in kilolitres.
R = jump fuel consumed per kilolitre of power plant.
T = time to charge energy sinks in minutes.

e.g. the TL 15 Far Trader on p.81 of the Imperial Encyclopedia is capable of
Jump-2.  Its jump drive can be described in detail as:

Power Required to perform a Jump-2:  17550 MW

except for the minor changes in the weight of the ship, and the division of
damage points between the high-yield fusion power plant and the rest of the
jump drive, much the same as the stats in the Imperial Encyclopedia.

In order to determine the time to charge energy sinks for standard designs,
the following TL chart will be useful:

                           FAR TRADER VARIANT
  CraftID:  Far Trader, Type A2A, TL 15, MCr37.47.
     Hull:  180/450, Disp=200, Config=3SL, Armor=40G, Unloaded=1104tons,
            Loaded=1971tons, Lanthanum Hull Grid.
    Power:  3/6, NormFusion=738 MW, Duration=30/90,
            0/1, HiYldFusion=17550MW, Duration=60 min.
     Loco:  4/8, Manuever=1, 3/6, Jump=2, NOE=190kph, Cruise=750kph,
            Top=1000kph, Agility=1.
    Commo:  Radio=System.
  Sensors:  PassiveEMS=Interstellar, ActiveEMS=FarOrbit, ActObjScan=Rout,
            ActObjPin=Rout, PasEngScan=Rout.
  Off/Def:  Hardpoints=2, DefDM=+3.
  Control:  Computer=1bisX3, Panel=HolodynamicLinkX233, Special=HeadsUpX2,

    Other:  Cargo=846kliters, Fuel=671kliters, PurificationPlant, Scoops,
            ObjSize=Average, EMLevel=Faint.

This variant version of the Far Trader has a smaller High-Yield Fusion Power
Plant, and a longer time to charge energy sinks.  Also, its Power HYFPP has
reduced damaged/destroyed hit points.  The cargo volume is larger, but by only
2.8%.

Whew!

I have yet to have time to update it for TNE.

The Hitch-Hiker\'s Guide to the Imperium is a wholly remarkable book.
In fact, it is probably the most remarkable book to come out of the
great publishing corporations of Core Sector.

Not only is a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful
one--more popular than the Basic Traveller Set, better selling than
Supplement 3:  The Spinward Marches, and more controversial than the
assissination of Emperor Strephon, Shattered Ships of the Fighting
Imperium, or the Virus.

In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the spinward edge of the
Imperium, the Hitch-Hiker\'s Guide has supplanted the Imperial
Encyclopedia as the standard repository of all knowledge, for though
it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least
widely innaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in
two important respects.

Firstly, it is slightly cheaper; and second, it has the words "Don\'t
Panic" inscriped in large, friendly letters on its rugged carrying case.

Hitch-Hiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy:
TL___Vol__________Weight___Price_
11   0.2 liters   0.5 kg   Cr 200
The Guide is an electronic book, packaged with a rugged carrying case with
some printing on the front, and a carrying strap.  It features a mini-
screen with full-color graphics, optional stereo sound, and a small mini-
keyboard.

The Guide is a work that is continually being updated by roving reporters.
This "elite" group of "highly" skilled observers roam the Imperium, seeking
out ways to see the Imperium for less than thirty credits a day.  They
send in updates to their local branch office, which edits them and relays
them on up to the central office in Core sector.  These generally make it
into a new edition of the Guide about every ten years.  Updates cost
Cr 20, and are packed in a small cartridge, which is inserted into a slot
on the back of the Guide.

Here is a sample of only a few of the many chapter titles from the Guide.
How to Leave Your Planet
Your Towel and You
Hoopy and Other Hitch-Hiker Lingo Explained
The Best Drink in Existence--the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster
How to Eat Free by Pretending to be a Health Inspector
Simple and Cheap Treatments for Food Poisoning
Vargr Poetry and How to Avoid It
Planet of the Ballpoint Pens
What to Do if You Find Yourself Stuck in a Crack in the Ground Underneath
     a Giant Boulder You Can\'t Move, with no Hope of Rescue.
The Universe--Some Information to Help You Live in It.

Obviously, some of these chapters are more topical than others.  One can of
course read the chapters in order, which might take several lifetimes.  More
likely, you can search by subject heading.  The relevant task role is:

To look something up in the Guide:
Routine, Int, Edu, 2 sec (uncertain).
Referee:  The information contained in the Guide is often rather inaccurate.
For this reason, this task is made uncertain.  For example, in the most recent
edition of the Guide, the information on the policy of Tukera lines regarding
stowaways failed to be updated, resulting in the untimely demise to date of
over thirty Hitch-Hikers, each of them tossed into space.

The Guide has this to say about Towels:
A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker
can have.  Partly it has great practical value.  You can wrap it around you
for warmth; you can lie on it; you can sleep under it; use it to sail a
miniraft; wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat; wrap it round your head to
ward off noxious fumes; you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress
signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean
enough.

More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value.  For some reason,
if a strag (strag:  nonhitch-hiker) discovers that a hitch-hiker has his
towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession
of a toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball
of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, vacc suit, etc., etc.  Furthermore,
the strag will then happily lend the hitch-hiker any of these or a dozen
other items that the hitch-hiker might accidentally have "lost."  What the
strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the
Imperium, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through and
still know where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with.

Towel:
TL___Weight___Vol___Price
 2     --      --   Cr 5

Hitch-Hiker Lingo tends to be frought with colorful euphemisms, partly because
such talk impresses the hell out of strags.  For example, rather than simply
say that she has a great deal of respect for someone, a Hitch-Hiker would say:
"Sass that hoopy _______?  There\'s a frood who really knows where his towel is."
Sass:  know, be aware of, meet, have sex with.  Hoopy:  Really together guy.
Frood:  Really amazingly together guy.

A similar and more frustrating example is the tendency of Hitch-Hikers to
refer to all communicators, but most especially those of Far Orbit range, as
"thumbs."  This origin of this term is lost in obscurity, but this hasn\'t
prevented willy advertising executives from marking perfectly normal radios
under the brand name Thumb for over twice the price.  Only a strag would buy
a Thumb brand thumb.  Hitch-Hiker\'s use their "thumb\'s" to ask ships in orbit
for a lift.  This is especially useful when stuck on some backwater planet,
with no decent surface to orbit transportation system.

The goal of the Hitch-Hiker is to see the Imperium on less than thirty credits
a day.  It doesn\'t take long to see that even travelling low isn\'t cheap
enough to stick to such a budget.  Their are several means Hitch-Hikers have
at their disposal to accomplish their goal:

Stoaway - this is perhaps the means that first springs to mind, but it is in
          many ways undesirable.  Some contend that it is contrary to the
          very nature of Hitch-Hiking, not because it is dishonest, but rather
          because the real challenge of Hitch-Hiking, these people insist,
          consists in persuading some unwilling merchant officer to let you
          on board.  Nonetheless, it is available as a means of last resort.
To discover a stoaway on board a vessel.
Routine, Steward/Hitch, Int, 2 min (confrontation).
Referee:  The Steward/Hitch indicates that in this confrontation task roll,
the Steward applies his Steward skill, while the Hitch-Hiker applies her Hitch
skill.  One attempt can be made per day.  Upon discovery, the Hitch-Hiker must
roll for the captain\'s reaction, applying her Hitch skill as a DM.  A result of
actively uncooperative or hostile behaviour will result in spacing.  The
stoaway is forced out the airlock without a spacesuit.  Potential stoaways
should realize that cargo holds are often depressurized during a trip.

The Hitch-Hiker\'s Guide to the Imperium says that if you hold a lungful of air
you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds.  However,
it does go on to say that what with space being the mind-boggling size it is the
chances of being picked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two
to the power of two hundred and seventy-six thousand, seven hundred and nine to
one against.

Hijacking - this is even a worse idea than stoing away.  Shame on you for
            even thinking of it.  Just make sure not to steal Hot Black
            Desaitor\'s Stunt Ship.

Working Passage - this is an extremely common way for Hitch-Hikers to travel.
                  It is for this reason that players would do well to accumulate
                  at least minimal skill in such areas as steward, in order
                  to give them fighting chance at such a job.  There are some
                  Hitch-Hikers who are too proud to take a working passage, as
                  if smacks too much of working for a living.
To locate a ship with a position available:
Variable, Int, Hitch, (30 min).
Referee:  This skill is of variable difficulty, depending on the local starport
classification.  If StarPort A  - Routine,
                    StarPort B  - Difficult,
                    StarPort C  - Formidable.
                    StarPort D- - Impossible
To persuade a starship captain to give you a working passage:
Difficult, Int, Hitch, (confrontation, uncertain).
Referee:  If Extremely Cooperative results, the captain will offer the Hitch-
Hiker the passage.  If Neutral results, the captain will ask for the Hitch-
Hiker to come for a second interview later.  Otherwise, the captain will
refuse to consider the Hitch-Hiker for the position.

Courier - small, fragile cargoes may be escorted from one star system to
          another in exchange for a big rebate on a middle passage, say
          Cr 2,000 instead of Cr 8,000.  Still, this is not as cheap as going
          low, though rather a good deal more pleasant.

Teasers - teasers are rich kids with too much time on their hands and big
          expensive yachts.  They like Hitch-Hikers because when they hang
          around with them, they feel adventurous.  Hitch-Hikers like teasers
          because they provide them with a way of getting from point A to
          point B without having to work for it.  Make sure to show them your
          copy of the Guide and your towel, and watch their eyes bug out.
To locate a teaser:
Variable, Int, Hitch (60 min).
Referee:  This skill is of variable difficulty, depending on the local starport
classification.  If StarPort A  - Difficult
                    StarPort B  - Formidable
                    StarPort C- - Impossible.
To persuade a teaser to give you a lift:
Routine, Int, Hitch, (confrontation, uncertain).
Referee:  If Extremely Cooperative results, the teaser will be willing to give
you, in addition to a lift, a small infusion of cash, in order to help replace
all of the gnat spray you lost on your trip over the falls of Beta Five.

Regarding the naming of the Aslan after a character in C.S. Lewis\' Chronicles
of Narnia:  that is easy to justify.  After all, "Aslan" is not what they
call themselves, it\'s what _we_ call them...so one can imagine a well-read
Solomani explorer meeting them during the Long Night and attaching that label
to them somewhere within the Dark Nebula sector...

I know of an even more nasty idea -- if there are any long lines in the
message it can spit it back at the sender, and NOT digest it into the
TML. In the cases where someone needs to post a message with long lines
(spreadsheet or something) they can give it to me (admin) to place it in
the digest by hand. What do TMLers think? Should I instrument this? If
you have an opinion and want to be heard, respond to me by direct email

a _basic_ gopher server with the links already listed. You are welcome to
drop through my server to get to the primary archives. And yes, James, I
guess you can include this in your "TML FAQ list". :)

the gopher link is \'ghost.cc.missouri.edu\'. Please note, this is NOT an

20mm sounds about right.  I saw one once when I used to work in a gun
shop.  Those things are BIG!  They had a bipod on the front, and I
believe that the butt of the weapon was somehow emplaced in the ground
also.  I think they were fired by either two or three man fire teams,
like machine guns.

They have a short banana-shaped magazine which is mounted above the
weapon, curves forward, and holds (I think) 5 rounds.  The rounds are
huge, looking proportionally like long rifle or machine gun ammo, except
that they are about an inch in diameter.  Actually, the whole gun looks
remarkably like a giant assault rifle, although it is 5 or 6 feet long
(my memory may be exaggerating) and has the magazine on top.

The weapon I always thought was rather impressive is the Israeli
Galil assault rifle.  It fires 5.56mm shells through a very heavy
barrel for an accurate shot.  I forget the details, but I believe
it held an impressive amount of ammunition and had some thoughtful
additions such as an integral bipod which doubles as a wire cutter.

Both Authors wrote books of that name.  Both were very well done.

Melissa Scotts book was about two women who run a go-anywhere salvage and
recovery company (bringing their tech 10-11 salvage equipment to tech 6-9
planets for a fee).  I always thought it would make a great campaign,
but could never get a group of players into it ("We need a BIG grav tank
for salvage operations, don\'t we?".-"No, you don\'t".).

  Technically speaking, not at all (training and points all give

  I think this comes under the heading of ref\'s common sense. In
 my games, I\'d give a character a skill zero if said character
 succeeded one or more times at an unskilled task attempt (only 1
 for an impossible success, never for any number of automatic

  Antitank rifles (ATRs) were common in the late 1930s and early
 1940s. The British, Soviets, Germans, Japanese, Finns, and Swiss
 all developed one (there are undoubtedly nations that I have
 forgotten). All I know about the Lahti is what you have already
 stated, but every photo I have seen shows ATRs being fired
 from a prone position. Recoil on the 20mm Soluthurn (Swiss) ATR
 is said to have been particularly punishing.

  Mark F. Cook:

  I really don\'t want to start a flame here, but I cannot let
 this pass by without comment.
 Let me see if I have this straight:
 You think we (Dave Nilsen/me/GDW) ripped you off on the basis of
 a couple of names and a similar function? Isn\'t this going off
 rather half-cocked?

  > I *am* however, curious to know where the idea for this Manta
  >\'fuel skimmer\' design originated, since I designed almost
  > *exactly* the same ship (with the same class name) for the
  > TML PBEM over TWO YEARS AGO.

  Unless you posted the designs publicly on the TML, no one at
 GDW has ever seen them. We do not receive the PBEM campaign stuff
 (Mike Metlay offered, but I declined...I had too much to read as
 it was). I\'ve had access to TML for about 18-24 months, so the
 designs may have been posted before I started monitoring. In any
 case, I don\'t remember anything of the sort.

  What makes you say it is "almost *exactly* the same ship"? The
 fact that it shares a name and skims fuel?  Our Manta is a
 detachable-fuel-tank-with-an-engine that flies ahead of its
 mother ship, skims fuel, and returns to the mother ship. Does
 yours do this? Our Manta design displaces 400 tons. What\'s the
 tonnage of yours? Ours is 33 meters long with a dome/disc
 configuration, has a crew of 12, no  weaponry, and no fuel
 refining facilities. What about yours? Is yours jump capable?
 What kind of sensors does it have? Why was it named Manta
 (because of its shape, or is MANTA an acronym for something)?
  > I also find it convienently coincidental that the clipper it

  > same long-running (5 years), international Traveller PBEM
  What is this other Aurora-class starship...how big is it, how many
 crew, what does it do, etc.? I could claim, on the basis of equally
 strong evidence (the name alone, with no notion of function, size,
 or anything else) that you took your Aurora from the Tsarist
 Russian naval vessel or one of the four WWII era vessels of the
 same name). Aurora is not an uncommon name for ships.

 The Aurora-class clippers are named such because one of
 the names for the Reconstruction Coalition was the Dawn League,
 and Aurora was the Greek goddess of the dawn.

  > Where *exactly* did Dave (Nilsen, I assume) get these ideas?

  The basic design of a modular ship occured to Frank about 1977
 (to the best of my reccolection), but we never did anything with
 it. The Clipper (aka Long Ship) has been around for about as long
 as the notion of the Star Vikings. Dave came up with the idea of
 the flying fuel tank. I would not be at all surprised to discover
 that dozens of people have come up with similar notions.

  The class of clippers was named Aurora about 1-1/2 to 2 years
 ago, I believe. _I_ named the skimmer "Manta" in March or April
 of this year, when I converted Dave\'s notes over to a BL design,
 because the plans that had been drawn up by an outside artist
 (who has never seen your PBEM material either) showed the ship
 with a fanciful resemblance a manta ray (the only other options
 were "Stingray" or "Fifty Mission Crush" neither of which trips
 off the tongue like :Manta").

 A drawing of our Clipper (side view), with the fuel skimmer
 attached, appears in Brilliant Lances on page 44 of the Technical
 Booklet, and a top view is shown on the counters for the game
 (but you don\'t have BL, so that doesn\'t help much)..

  I think you are jumping to an unwarranted conclusion here.

  The short answer is that it used to but it doesn\'t anymore,
 something else needs to furnish thrust. In unscientific terms, C-

 Marc told me once that the inspiration for the name Aslan came partly
 from the lion/Christ-substitute in C. S. Lewis\' Narnia novels, and
 partly from the Turkish word for "lion" which he said was "arslan."
 Vargr, BTW is, I think, "wolf" in some Slavic language (Russian?).

ftp.nau.edu site, and generate a map?  I\'ve found a coupla programs
(sub2ps and mapsub (from the TML SW4 package)) but the first will take a
lot of massaging to work, and the second doesn\'t print the names, and
overprints the hex numbers with two different numbers.

    'body' => 'I just picked up Challenge 71 and read \'Brilliant Lances Design Notes\'
by David Nilsen.  I have a few gripes I want to throw out to the list for
discussion.

My gripe or gripes mainly has to do with \'gravitic focusing\' of lasers.
I appreciate Nilsen stating up front that they try to "break the fewest
laws of physics that" they can when creating a sci-fi game and that the
other law of physics that they broke was the law of optics in that they
introduce gravitic focusing of the laser beam "by creating an _intense_
point source of gravity within the focusing area to bend the light with
gravity."  Now I went futzing around with some basic physics equations:

Law (?) of Gravity

               (m1)(m2)
      F  = -G ----  where G = 6.672E-11 Nm^2/(kg^2)
                 r*r


Einsteins Equation  :   E = mc^2

I wanted to see how much energy (E) it would take to replace m1 by E/(c^2)
to create a gravity point source that would exert 1g acceleration at 1m
distance.  I came up with 5.09 x 10^21 (!!!) Joules.  That becomes Watts
if it\'s over time.  So the best I can tell, _IF_ you could create a
gravity well with Energy, it would take 5.09 x 10^12 TERAWATTS to produce
a 1g acceleration at 1 m.

Now, for focusing a laser beam, since they are talking extremely tiny
radian changes in the beam, the distance is probably much smaller than 1m.
However, how much gravity (mass -> energy) does it take to bend light?  All
I can recall is Mr. Spock telling Cpt. Kirk that the selective bending of
light is extraodinarily expensive.  So, I would have been happier if they
had come up with some other explanation:  e.g micromachines control minute
focusing elements in the focal plane array, or electronic advances in
solid state focusing elements or solid state laser emitters combined with
supercomputing power allows the beam to be dynamically focused during a
pulse, thus permitting lasers to reach out and touch someone at hundreds
of thousands of km.

However, since they stated they can "create an intense point source of
gravity", then why not have \'impulse drive\' for system travel.  It\'s the old
idea of space being a fabric, that a gravity well is like pushing a finger
down in the fabric thus creating a \'well\'.  Put a marble on the fabric, close
enough to your finger and the marble will fall into the well.  Now, since
we can "create an intense point source of gravity", why not just project
it out in front of the ship.  By shifting the gravity point source around
the ship, we can change our direction.  By intensifying or lessening the
source, we change the  magnitude of our acceleration.  And if we can
do this, why the need for all that reaction mass?

The only problem is the power required to create such a point source of
gravity.  Assuming you can, like I said earlier, at 1m distant, you\'d need
5.09 x 10^12 TERAWATTS of power (at 10m, 5.09 x 10^13 TERAWATTS, at 100m,
5.09 x 10^15 TERAWATTS) just to create 1g of acceleration.  Assuming you
could generate 5x10^12 terawatts, your gravity point source would be INSIDE
of your ship!

I dunno, by breaking the laws of optics, it seems to throw their whole
system out of whack.  Maybe there\'s something in jump technology that allows
them to create an intense gravity point source at moderate energy levels
(that is, if jump space can be thought of as analagous to a worm hole, and
if worm holes are related to black holes or intense gravitic sources).
But still, if so, then why not have an impulse drive like i described above?

If gravitic focusing really throws their system out of whack, I guess I\'d
rather have beam weapons restricted in range to tens of thousands of
kilometers.  Then you\'d have to get close to do some damage, or you\'d
have to rely on missiles more.

I dunno, what do you guys think?

  The Imperial calendar was based on a fixed 365 day year, each day
  being 24 hours.  Days were numbered 001-365, with no other
  official designations.  However, due to the length of time that a
  jump takes, widespread but informal usage of a "week" of seven
  days was common.  Normal notation is daynumber-year (for example,
  123-1201).

  The Solomani Confederation used Terra\'s old Gregorian calendar,
  and has done so for roughly the past 4,000 years.  This calendar
  is based on the cycle of Terra around Sol, and the day is based
  on the rotational period of Terra, almost exactly one standard
  day of 24 standard hours (there is speculation that this is in
  fact the origin of the Imperial calendar designation.  However,
  the current Imperial calendar is also a very close match for
  the day and year of Capital).  The year is divided into twelve
  approximately equal periods called "months" (with the number of
  days varying from 28 to 31 according to no discernible formula),
  and extra (intercalary) days are inserted approximately every
  four years according to a fairly complex formula.  Normal
  notation is name-of-month daynumber-in-month, year (for example,
  July 4, 5776).

  The Vilani calendar is based on the Vilani year of 500
  32-standard-hour days.  Each day consists of a "dran", or
  daylight period, and a "dir", or night period, each of 16 hours.
  Each dran and dir is numbered separately, yielding a total of
  1,000 distinct numbered entities over the course of the Vilani
  year.  Normal notation is year.dran-or-dir-number (for example,
  7453.293)

  Zhodani and Aslan also have their own calendars.  If you\'re
  interested, let me know, and I\'ll dig out that info and post it
  to the List.

  cribbed from GDW\'s own work, and also work by DGP.  The

Subject: vargr & salvage

On the origin of Vargr....
- ----
I once saw a book titled \'Vargr\' or \'Vargr Moon\', or something similar.

I was at once intrigued, and so had a look: I was of course thinking
it was Traveller based.

It was about Scandinavian wolf creatures - they might have been werewolves.
I think they were supposed to be from Norse mythology. Since it was a
\'Horror\' story (well it was in the Horror section) I left it alone, as I am
not a fan of most Horror.

This was about 5 years ago, so I don\'t know how accurate my memory is.
After all, I was 25+ years old at the time....8-)

You might also note the similarity between the word -vargr- and the word
- -warg- (describing a large supernatural wolf) in Tolkien\'s Lord of the
Rings. A lot of Tolkien is inspired by Norse mythology, including names.

On Salvage....
- ----

I once had occasion to check about salvage too. I cannot remember the
details, but I do remember I found a lot of quite good information in the
Encyclopaedia Brittanica.

To:	IN%"traveller@engrg.uwo.ca"
	A few comments about Mr.Goss\' jump drive rules.  First off, good job.
Ive always wanted more realistic detail in my games (which is why I love-hate
the MT design sequence, even with the errata). In rewriting some of the rules
(especially the weapons rules to make them Striker compatable), I have realized
the slap-together job they are. Still, they do work.  I am going to incorporate
your ideas into my campaign(with your blessing, hopefully), until I finish my
rewrite of the MT design rules (unfortunately(?) the results will not be
compatable with the MT rules set, being a compination of Striker, MT, and
additions of diminishing-returns rules.)
However, when battering these rules  around the room with my Vargr coursair,
we came up with these comments and questions.

>3.b._Energy_Requirement________________________________________________________
>There are three componenets to the energy requirement:  a portion to power the
>Jump Governor, a portion to \'warm up\' the Lanthanum Hull Grid, and a portion
>to actually enter jump space.
>
> To power Jump Governor:            1.625 MW-hr X Jump # X total ship volume(kl)
> To \'warm up\' Lanthanum Hull Grid:  0.650 MW-hr X Jump # X total ship volume(kl)
> To_enter_jump_space:_____________+_2.600_MW-hr_X_Jump_#_X_total_ship_volume(kl)
>                                  = 4.875 MW-hr X Jump # X total ship volume(kl)

	In MTJ#4(I think), there is a question in the back about the fuel use
of a jump.  The answer showed that the fuel for a j2 is greater than twice the
fuel for a j1, mostly due to the way the grid works.  A comprimise was stated,
that showed the jump grid took a more constant amount of power irregardless of
the actual jump distance.  Perhaps a hull grid power use of, say, (.5 MW-hr *
ship vol)+(.1 MW-hr * jump * ship vol)?  This would keep the power usage of the
jump grid more constant. Or, pehaps a useage based on the j-rating of the
drive.  Eg- with j4 drive, to perform a j1 takes (.25 the fuel of a j4 + grid
power + (efficiency mod *(4 - 1)).  This would represent the fact that in MT a
ship is more efficient when jumping at the rating it was designed for.  This
makes more sense than the CTrav solution of j4 = 4*j1.

	Based on the info in Starship Op Man, the jump gov controls the power
routing from the energy sinks to the hull grid.  Shouldnt the size of the
governor be based on the size of the grid (modifies for hull configuarion, see
below) as well as the amount of power the governor needs to regulate?
eg: size of gov. = (.8 * ship vol)+(HYFPP output * mod)
	(where mod is determined when I can get access to my design table and
determine a number that sounds right.- Damn These Vargrs!)
	Why would two ships the same size use the same size goverenor if one
could jump farther?

>3.d._Lanthanum_Hull_Grid________________________________________________________
>A grid of Lanthanum wires implanted in the outer layer of the ship\'s hull,

>
	Could this be modified for the hull configuation?  A sperical
configuration would need less of a grid than an irregular config, manifesting
itself in the price/kl of ship volume.  Possibly something like:

	Config			Price/Kl
	Sperical		1200
	Needle/Wedge            1500
	Cylinder                1800
	Irregular               2200
	..etc..

These are off the cuff numbers, but as soon as I get access to my geometry
books (I can never remember volume/surface area equations), better numbers can
be calculated.
	Indeed, since the jump grid is the same irregardless of jump rating,
shoud it be calculated before jump govenor so that its size can facter in.

	My only comment with this, as with everthing in the MT design rules, is
the courseness of efficiency increses.  Were I to rewrite the table (and I am;
eventually Ill be done), I would take that 650 Mw/kl output increase from TL12
to TL13 an spreasd it around the lower tech levels.  This would make the TL
progression smoother and less of the X til TL-Y then Z from then on graininess
of the design charts.

	Very usefgul in the "When will he be in range" and "Can we jump before
they get here" situations.  Also, a partial task roll(off the top of my head):

	To decrease the amount of time to perform a jump:
	Difficult, Engineering, EDU
	REFEREE: if successful, roll on table, applying +2 if except.succ:
	3-5 = reduce jump time by 5%		
	6-8 = reduce jump time by 7%		
	9-11= reduce jump time by 10%
	12-14= reduce jump time by 13%		
	15-17= reduce jump time by 16%		
	18 =   reduce jump time by 20%
	If mishap occurs, superficial: no time decrease, jump relativity error
			  minor: minor damage to jump gov, repair before next
			   	  jump.
			  major: no jump, major damage to jump gov, minor
 				  fractures in Zuchai crystals
			  destroyed:  jump gov slagged, no jump performed,
 				       Zuchai crystals shattered.

	I can imagine times where this could save a lot of trouble for the
characters.

	Perfect modification to a design for the free trader or trading
company.  This is the design \'tweaking\' that is possible with the MT rules that
Classic Trav never had and TNE does away with.  When every credit counts, this
might be a better design.
	Indeed, an excellent set of rules, except, perhaps suffering from some
of the same problems MT suffers from only because they are written for MT.
Why couldnt DGP do things like this with MT?

I heard it should be sent to distributor on Dec. 20th , and be in
gaming store by the 23th (according to GDW).

Deluxe TNE should be shipped the same day. Other than the errata, I\'m
not sure what is new in it.

 Ok, thats it for the submission guideline. I have also had questions from
several people about subscription rates outside the US, and availability
of back issues. the answers to these are:

Subceriptions in North America are $12.00 (US) for four issues.
Subscriptions outside North America are $14.00 (US) for four issues sent
SURFACE mail...and $20.00 for four issues sent AIRMAIL.

Issues #1 & 2 are still abailable. Prices are $3.50 per issue in North
America, and $4.00 per issue (surface) outside North America.

All prices include postage of course.

***  We are presently trying to work out a swap arrangement with
Signal-GK. If all goes well, The Traveller Chronicle will be available in
the UK from Jae Campbell, and we will have Signal-GK available in North
America.....this should make both \'zines more widely available on both
sides of the Atlantic. ***

One last note. I spoke with Kevin on the phone last night, and TTC #3 is
shaping up nicely...we should have it back from the printers and in the
mail by mid-January.

Thanks to everyone for the constructive feedback to date. Please continue
letting us know what you\'d like to see in future issues.

I followed the Traveller type books topic with some interest. Thought I\'d
use  this chance to throw in a few of my favorite choices.

Hunting Rights, by P.M. Fergusson and G.L. Robson ( ANALOG, May 1988 )

  The only thing I have is an article on salvage rights and Pocket
Empires (many of whom might consider themselves the rightful heirs
of the Third Imperium, and thus the owners by default of all salvaged
hardware; makes the salvage business unpleasant).  I do have a few
thoughts on the matter, though.
  Since you mention the Imperial Navy as a possible buyer, I assume
you are playing during the Third Imperium.  This leads to an easy
transferance of some of today\'s salvage laws.  While I don\'t profess
to be an expert on salvage law, the following comes to mind:
 -Designated "War Grave" sites are off limits to most salvage, and
 any salvaged materials traceable to a War Grave could get the
 salvaging party in a lot of trouble.
 -A salvaged item like a ship has enough of a documented history
 that a rightful owner may be easy to track down.  If such is the
 case, the owner has a certain period of time in which to claim the
 salvaged item as his own.  This claim requires proof of ownership
 and payment of a percentage (like 10% or so; anyone got a better
 figure?) of the item\'s value to the salvagers.  If no owner claims
 rights to the salvage within the set time (generally a year or more)
 then the item may be kept by the salvagers or auctioned off to the
 highest bidder (or just plain sold, depends on the local laws).
 Cases where ownership is obviously open (such as three-century-old
 privately-owned no-heirs-remaining ships) may be expedited.
 -Salvaged items with no "provenance" (ie. no traceable history or
 owner) may not have to wait the year to be sold.
 -Everybody pays taxes.  For the salvagers, a ship would count as a
 "capital gain" if kept, or "income" if sold or claimed.
 -Salvagers might have a licensing law similar to the procedure
 that starmercs go through, but I doubt it.  Salvage in Imperial
 space can be done by nearly anyone, and trying to license and
 regulate it would be more work than it\'s worth.  Note that this
 might be different in certain systems, but would only apply to
 salvage _within_ that system.  System governments that license
 salvagers are also probably licensing belters, and are probably
 rather anal about it.
 -In most instances, salvage is Imperial "business" and salvaged
 items like ships would be registered at the local Navy or Scout
 base (Navy preferred).  There may indeed be a fee for registering
 a salvaged item, but it would be determined by your opinion of
 the Imperial Navy.  If the Navy considers salvagers to be scummy
 people in a scummy business, then the fees will be high.  If the
 Navy is less prejudiced about these matters, then the fee is likely
 to be fairly low (either fixed Cr100 or Cr1000 per item, or 0.1%
 of value).
 -Salvage with living persons aboard is considered "Rescue" and uses a
 different set of rules and regs. See the very beginning of _Aliens_
 for the typical salvager\'s opinion of "Rescue work".
  Of course, if you are playing in unclaimed space, or in the New Era,
all bets are off.  Salvage rights will then depend on local governmental
need & greed.  You have been warned ;)

  Frankly, I think I don\'t care.  Having watched too many of these
"falling damage in D&D" discussions to count, I have adopted an attitude
of "if the _rule_ works, who cares what reality does".  From my point
of view, the rules work.  Reality can go hang.  The intense-gravity-
focusing explanation isn\'t important to how the rules work in practice,
so it\'s not important at all.  It is sufficient that lasers can reach
extreme distances at the higher tech levels, and that they can deliver
a great deal of damage when they get there.

  To address the power problem specifically, it has already been
established that a scoutship can be placed under a 1g internal gravity
field for a mere 7 megawatts (Brilliant Lances, pg 19).  That same 7 MW
is sufficient to compensate for 6g of maneuver thrust, provided the
Scout had such engines.  Obviously Imperials know something about
artificial gravity generation that we don\'t.  The generator capable of
these feats is all of 14 cubic meters in volume.  I have no trouble
believing that a smaller device could generate much higher gravity
fields in much smaller areas for brief instants of time (the discharge
time of a laser turret, in this case), given the "super-capacitors"
that laser turrets have in them and the increased volume of said
turret.
  As for why they don\'t use this technology for drive purposes, my
answer is that they probably are.  the HEPlaR drive in standard use
in TNE is mighty efficient for mere heat-exchange technology, and
frankly I wouldn\'t be surprised to find high gravitic fields involved
there as well.  I feel more comfortable with my super-gravity generator
working in a specially prepared chamber _BEHIND_ me than I would if
I were being pulled along by the gravity itself, implying a high-G
field directly _IN_FRONT_ of me.  Alan Dean Foster can keep it.

I also have a problem with the way CT/MT/T:TNE treated artifical
gravity.  I did a little digging in my trusty physics book and found
that there isn\'t any unique diffculty in creating a X-ray pulse.
(Obviously so since it is routinely used in medical and engineering
equipments.)  Anyway, I found that if a heat source can be maintained at
a temperature of 483000 Kelvin (I see a plasma here) about 66% of the
energy it radiates will be in the upper x-ray band (about 6 x 10-9
meters).  With proper cooling and using the same technolgy used to
confine the much hotter plasma found in fusion reactors, So big
shipmounted x-ray lasers ahould be possible at relatively low tech
levels.

As far as pointing the beam it would be much easier and simpler to
float the emitter mechanism using magnetic suspension technology.
Especially if you game in a "No-Gravity Control" universe...

So In any case, there really isn\'t any need for the \'gravity lense\' in
the current BL.  Imagine a crew person walking by an active grav lense
laser,..THUNK! "Help I\'ve fallen on the ceiling and I can\'t get down." :))

I don\'t know how the analysis should go, but that looks *extremely* dodgy.
For one thing, that figure doesn\'t seem to take any account of the mass of
the object being accelerated, and the day someone figures out how to
supply 1G acceleration to 10,000,000 kg of mass for the same amount of
energy as it takes to supply 1G acceleration to 0.0000001 kg of mass is the
day that someone is going to figure out how to make free energy.  For another
thing, you can\'t interchange Joules and Watts that easily, as someone found
out a few threads ago (remember the stuff about computer power consumption? :-)

True, mainly because light moves very fast, so to do anything significant to
its path you need a lot of acceleration, i.e. a lot of gravity.  I for one do
not intend to be in a spaceship anywhere near a gravity well capable of doing
something useful to a light beam!

Newton\'s 3rd law puts a stop to that.  If the gravity generator is exerting
a force on the ship, then the ship is exerting the same force on the gravity
generator.  Whatever is holding them apart is going to have to be pretty
tough if it isn\'t going to get squashed.  And if it doesn\'t get squashed,
then neither the ship nor the gravity generator are going anywhere.  You
don\'t need a hefty gravity generator to play this trick, anyway - an iron
hull and a large magnet will behave the same way.

Delete everything before "I guess" in the above paragraph, and you get my
preference. :-)

The other problem is that of tidal forces.  For a really powerful point gravity
source (read: singularity) which is that close to you, the difference in force
across the depth of your body will tear you to bits.  Robert L. Forward
postulated a novel way of getting around this, though.  All you need to do is
create a torus out of a black hole which is continually rotating in on itself
(as opposed to radially).  You aim it at a distant star, fly right through the
middle, and because the forces are equal in all directions you can be
accelerated at terrific accelerations without tidal problems.  To stop at the
far end, simply reverse the procedure.  Of course, all of this can be
accomplished with materials found in the average kitchen...

I agree with an earlier poster: if the rules work, forget about reality.  If
you or your players are such sticklers for realism then any game involving FTL
travel must by definition be out of bounds anyway.

Subject: lasers


  On lasers:

  The Australian (newspaper) had an article in the computer section on a
  (new?) laser light generation method which does not involve lenses.  My
  copy of the newspaper is gone but somebody might still have a copy and fill
  in the dots and dashes below.

  The pulse is generated at 90 degrees to the emitter rather than \'in the
  conventional way\'.  Also , the light is not parallel, it converges at a
  controllable rate.  So you have more control and a smaller emitter.  Its
  geared more to the low power computer communications environment but I was
  just wondering how powerful these could get if we specificly built for
  military use and extrapolated forward a couple of tech levels?

  Anyone else see the article?

  On game realism:

  Many TMLers are truth, justice and the REAL UNIVERSE way supporters and
  I\'ve seen many screens of TML talk about how and why this should work this
  way and how to make things REALISTIC.  Traveller has been very popular
  because a lot of it is believable (with only a few stretches of the
  imagination and the current laws of physics).

  I liked the old Traveller before they started explaining how everything
  worked and had to squeaze and shoe horn things into the real universe.  I
  even had the JUMP and MANOUVER drives rationalised in my games and then GDW
  decide to bring in reaction masses and MORE REALISM.  If you can have a
  JUMP drive, why can\'t you have a reactionless MANOUVER drive.

  I personally, have no problem with being able to carry around and use a
  mega-watt laser pistol provided the game rules make such an item PLAYABLE.
  I don\'t want (or need) to know HOW it works.  Even Anti-gravity doesn\'t
  hurt provided the GM kills off anybody who has plans to make perpetual
  motion machines etc.

  How about putting some FICTION back into SCIENCE FICTION.

  If this really upsets the REALISTIC players then that\'s not my problem so
  please send all cries of sacrilege and the barbed & witty replies to the
  nearest bit bucket (unless they\'re really fun to read 8^}).

  Just my 2 cents worth.

    In regards to Lewis Taylor Goss\'s Jump Drive Rules, I was wondering how the
High Yield Fusion Power Plant Output figures were arrived at. I mean, I notice
that they are all multiples of 650 Mw, but Why? How do we arrive at the idea
that the Fusion Plants can be run for such an increase in output/Kl volume?

    Further... If we apply this concept to Antimatter Power Plants, to what
degree could we increase the yield of said power plant? The Reason I ask this
is that we could conceivably create jump drives which utilize Antimatter Power
that require much less refuelling (or less fuel space) or Less Drive space.
This would be the way to go in higher tech-level designs, especially for
military vessels.

    Of course, the day of the Antimatter Jump Drive installed on a Free Trader
is still way in the future... 8->

If you are one of the lurkers in my group, don\'t read the rest of my
message.  Please excuse my spelling and grammer errors.



Operation: Imperium

Time: Early in 1105, Imperial calander.

Section 1: Insertion

The main goal of this section of the adventure is to get the players
familiar with the mechanics of getting from place to place.  By the
end of this series of adventures, the players will be in Imperial
space with Imperial identity papers.

Start by giving players a new set of identity papers and travel
instructions.

	Nationality:	Zhodani
	Occupation:	Zhodani Navy Officers
	Travel reason:	Assignment shift.
	Travel orders:	Take naval transportation from Chronor (0303
		Spinward Marches) to Querion (0614 Spinward Marches).
		Check into Radison South Vladivostok and await
		contact.

The first part of their journey will be rather easy.  They will manage
to get transport from the Naval vessel "Long Star".  The planets they
will stop in will be the following:

	Jump 1: Chronor to Atsa
		B4337CA-A Zhodani Military Base, Poor, Non-Ag
		Domed cities, happy very well controled masses.  Very
		strict laws.

	Jump 2: Atsa to Ninjar
		A211666-C Zhodani Military Base, Non-Ag, Non-In
		Most of the people here are connected to the military
		base.

	Jump 3: Ninjar to Sheyou
		B756779-A Zhodani Military Base, Agricultural
		Balkanized government.  A number of farming
		collectives and a large transportation food storage
		co-op.  The co-op controls the area of the starport.

	Jump 4: Sheyou to Rapp\'s World
		C592320-8 Zhodani Military Base, Non-In
		LA smog like world.  Recovering from a nuclear war.

	Jump 5: Rapp\'s World to Querion
		B254788-9 Zhodani Military Base, Agricultural
		Vastly overcrouded.  Civil Service bureaucracy.  Great
		place to get lost and/or change identities.

The "Long Star" needs to have at least jump-3, preferable jump-4.
This ship and crew should be reusable at a later time period.  Build
it at tech 13 or tech 14.  This is a ordinary vessel, not a special
souped up spy ship.  (Detailed elsewhere, with deck plans.)

At the Radison South Vladivostok the players will be met by agents of
SORAG.  The players will be given new identity papers and travel
instructions.  They will also be given a sealed box.  If asked the
contact will tell them that the box contains a holy relic of Pavabid.
Up to 30,000 CR will be made available to them _if_they_ask_ for
additional funds.

	Nationality:	Pavabid (independant 1238 Spinward Marches)
	Occupation:	Pavabid religious cult members.
	Travel reason:	Returning holy relic to Pavabid.
	Travel orders:	Proceed to Hrunting (0921 Spinward Marches) by
		available transportation.  Check into the Radison
		New Berlin within 2 months and await contact.
	Background:	Pavabid is an amberzone strictly controled by
		a fanatic religious cult.  Sort of Ninja-Amish.

This next part of the journey will be more difficult.  The players
will need to maintain the illusion of being from Pavabid.  More than
likely they will have to make a number of jumps to get there.

	Hurunting: B463747-9
		Imperial Scout base
		Swords world naval base
		Rich world

At the Radison New Berlin the players will be met by SORAG agents
after a few days.  The players will be given new identity papers and
travel instructions.

Just some other notes:

I run the Zhodani as sort of a cross between the Soviets and the
Japanese.  The slant is that the Imperium *tries* to pass itself off
as a bunch of nice guys; however, see Adventure 1: Kuniur (sp?).

If I understand your posting correctly, you are talking about a
thermally emitting plasma, i.e. one that is just radiating because it is
trying v. v. hard to cool down.  I don\'t think this can be used like a
laser.  The X-rays are emitted in all directions, so you don\'t get a
beam.  The radiation isn\'t coherent, which means all the peaks and
troughs of the light waves tend to cancel, reducing the average
intensity.  The idea of a laser is that the light is coherent, so that
the peaks and troughs add.  Also, a laser relies on mirrors to bounce the
X-rays back and forth through the lasing-medium, so that each photon has
plenty of chance to create more photons (leading to the all important
amplification).  The trouble with X-rays is that they are a bugger to
reflect, so by conventional Traveller wisdom X-ray lasers appear at TL
13.

Sorry to put a damper on low-tech X-ray lasers :-)

The TML is still alive and well, although it is totally on robotic control.
I hope that I will have email back up this week sometime, but it\'s

If I remember right (which is unlikely :-) the US DoD did some experiments
with xray lasers for the "Star Wars" (SDI) program.  These invloved a nuke
as the trigger, surrounded by rods of lasing material.  This was probably
a "single pass" type of laser (ie no bouncing back & forth to get really
good amplification) and relied on the fact that the xrays went faster than
the heat/shock wave which destroyed the laser rods.

I think one was tested in an underground detonation test but I don\'t think
the results were very good.  Any one remember anything more about this one ?

Traveller is a Science Fiction role playing game.  The attraction of the
genre for many has been the potential reality of the stories (and games)
which are a part of that genre.  Now, I can make some pretty far-fetched
things explainable (magic as psionics for example).  However, the
technology used typically in traveller should be easily explainable since
we are relatively close to that tech now.

On the other hand,  I have played some pretty boring games with lifelike
damage ("He shoots you with a handgun (roll some dice), youre dead.").

Play balance is always the most important factor.  But the science in this
game is just as important to many players.  Fortunately, Scientific theory
(and sometimes scientific fact) has the ability to "bend over backwards" to
fit just about any situation.  The major problem with developing your own
scientific \'facts\' to substantiate actions is that smart players will get a
hold of them and use them in previously unforseen ways.  (wouldn\'t a point-
gravity generating device be a great weapon?)

It seems to me that the most important thing to do with any technological
explanation is to explore the implications of the existence of the technology
involved, both the scientific and the social.  This is, in fact, the essence
of science fiction; the social, political, and scientific effects of technology.
The best games (and novels) I have seen emphasize the Social and Political, and
actually downplay the scientific (to the role of background, as it should be).

I have a few suggestions to retain play balance in the face of technology;

1) limit or curtail \'specialized\' characters.  After a certain skill level (4 in CT),
I double the cost-per-skill level of all skills.  This is to discourage having
experts in the part inventing new items (High-energy weapons expert inventing
a fusion pistol).

2) Combine different areas of technology to explain the more difficult-to-explain
items.  To explain the \'point-gravity source\' I would tell characters it was the
product of gravitics, high-energy physics, Astrophysics, and computer or robotics
technology.  By throwing in astrophysics, as well as a number of different skills
I essentially interdict developing the technology. (Not many PCs take astrophysics
skill).  And by saying that the latest of all of these technologies are being used,
I make further development less likely in the near term.

Happy Travelling!

We had a simple method with CT (and MT);

Skill level	Education

    2           Well acquainted, Undergrad coursework or several year\'s

    3		Field of study, Undergrad Major+grad work, One of only two

    5		Graduate + several year\'s experience in field
    6		(NPCs only) Top in the field, Lifes work (no other skills above
			level 3 allowed).

To put it as an example, The better the skill the more the character can do with
less;

Skill; Vacc Suit

level 0    can get into one without putting the arms in the leg holes
level 1    can do minor (temporary) repairs with a patch kit only
level 2    can do some permanent patching (with a kit), can improvise minor patches
		from other vacc suits.
level 3	   can do permanent patches from other vacc suits, major repairs with a kit
		minor (temp) patches with improvised items (baggies + superglue),
		can make a vacc suit with the right material and equipment
level 4	   can make a vacc suit from some improvised material, patches and repairs
		with 100% improvised material (plastic shrink wrap, aluminum foil
		and bubble gum, oatmeal).
level 5    can manufacture a vacc suit from a case of condoms, a jar of KY jelly
		and a five rolls of dental floss
level 6	   can teach someone else how to make a vacc suit from condoms, KY jelly

What I want to know, is how do the T:TNE skill levels stack up?
The above was what we came up with as a general guide.  Does anyone else
have some humorous examples?

No, you can\'t use it as a laser, but you can use it to pump a laser.
Let me explain (see below, the explanation of nuclear-pumped X-ray lasers is
at the bottom, below the general background on laser technology).

That\'s for a "conventional" laser, like the crystalline or gas lasers that
you see in a lab nowadays.  However, some pretty interesting work has been
done by the US Department of Defense on unconventional lasers.  One source
of information is the Congressional Research Office\'s white paper "Directed
Energy Missile Defense in Space", available from the US Government Printing
Office.  This paper presents the basics of the technology in a clear (if
dry) manner, at a level intended to be intelligable by the average
Congressional staffer.

Let me supply some background.  For my purposes right now, I\'ll call anything
that emits coherent light a "laser", whether or not it actually relies on
the classic Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation
principle.  Physicists in the group can skip the rest; it\'s "popular" level
science (and may well contain some errors, for which I apologise).

Classic laser technology relies on two things: first, a "population
inversion" - that is, there must be more excited ("charged", or ready
to emit a photon) atoms or molecules of the lasing material than in the
ground state ("uncharged").  Second is the principle of stimulated
emission: if a photon passes near an excited atom, the chances are
relatively high that the excited atom will emit an identical
photon (same frequency, same phase, going in the same direction).  This
creates a sort of an "avalanche effect", building to a pulse of coherent
light of respectable size.  For best effect, mirrors are used to make a
"resonant cavity" some exact multiple of the wavelength of the light.  The
photons bounce back and forth, stimulating the emission of more photons,
until the pulse has reached it\'s peak power.

You can dispense with the resonant cavity if you are willing to put up with
ridiculously low efficiencies, and can provide a relatively long lasing
element that can somehow get pumped all at once.  Of course, such a laser
will emit a beam from both ends (further reducing efficency, unless you have
a use for both beams).  The stimulated emission "avalanche efect" still
happens (resonant cavity or not), but without the mirrors, a longer run is
needed to build up a pulse of equivalent power.  In addition, a significant
number of excited atoms or molecules won\'t emit a photon, even though the
"avalanche" passes near them.  If a resonant cavity is present, each of
these gets several chances to emit, as the light is reflected back and forth.
Without it, each one of these non-emitters is a lost opportunity, and wasted
pumping energy.

The very first lasers were crystalline affairs.  Impurities in a crystal
(ruby, as I recall) are the lasing element.  The crystal itself formed the
resonant cavity, and the energy to pump the laser was provided by a
flashtube wound around the crystal.

Gas lasers are similar, except that the energy is usually provided
electrically (by sending an electrical current through the gas, like a neon
sign) instead of optically.  Dye lasers use a dye suspended in a liquid (or
other substance, such as Jell-O) as the lasing element, and energy is
supplied by optical pumping (the flashtube again).

Chemical lasers supply the energy for the laser beam by a chemical reaction.
The lasing element can be almost anything, but is typically a gas resulting
from the chemical reaction, flowing into and through a resonant cavity.

Solid-state lasers (ie: laser diodes) don\'t rely on mirrors, or on a lasing
medium.  They emit coherent light directly, in much the same way that a
LED (Light Emitting Diode) emits non-coherent light (in fact, some LEDs will
emit coherent light if cooled to very low tempretures).  The energy for
these lasers is electrical, and the laser converts it directly to light.

A free electron laser emits coherent light by arranging for an electron beam
to pass down a "wiggler" - a series of magnets that bend the beam into a
series of up-and-down zigzags.  As the electron beam bends, the electrons
emit coherent light.  By arranging the wiggles just right, the light from
each zig and zag adds up to a powerful coherent beam.

In principle the X-ray detonation lasers used by T:TNE missiles are
pretty well understood even today, and such lasers don\'t seem to be out
ot the realm of possibility (should their production be made a national
priority) at the present level of technology (TL-8 or so).

The general plan calls for a long, relatively narrow rod of laser material
(exactly what material has the right properties, I don\'t know, and it\'s
exact composition is probably a secret even if I did).  The rod, and many
like it, are deployed some distance from a nuclear device, arranged in
such a way that they surround it.

When the nuclear device is detonated, the majority of the energy of the
explosion is released as "soft" X-rays.  If in a planetary atmosphere, the
air would immediately absorb these rays (and heat up immensely in the process)
and form the familliar fireball and mushroom cloud.  In space, the "soft"
X-rays travel unimpeded until they are absorbed by the laser rods, charging
them.  The material in the rods is now ready to lase, which it does
spontaneously and immediately.  If everything is arranged right, the laser
rods emit bursts of coherent X-rays (from both ends of the rod) just before
the expanding fireball (made up of vaporized nuclear device, guidance
system, and so on) reaches the laser rods.

You get a single pulse from each rod, at stupendously low efficiency.  BUT,
you\'ve managed to channel some of the energy of the explosion into a
beam (so it won\'t spread out too much on the way to the target) of coherent
(much more efficient at causing damage) X-rays (which should be absorbed
efficiently by the hull of the target).

Since the energy source is a nuclear explosion, efficiency really isn\'t a
problem.  The power of the lasers is limited more by how much energy the
laser rods can absorb without vaporizing themselves.  If we assume that
X-ray mirrors are TL-13 technology, the power of the lasers should about
double at that point, simply by putting mirrors at the back of each rod.

> Sorry to put a damper on low-tech X-ray lasers :-)

Just so long as it isn\'t a nuclear damper, I think things are still OK ;-)

It\'s put out by Blacksburg Tactical Research Center (BTRC). The same company
also puts out TimeLords, a time travel RPG, SpaceTime, a cyberpunk RPG,
CORPS, a conspiracy RPG, and some other games with weird names like \'Renegade
Nuns on Wheels.\'

3G works quite nicely for designing small arms. The basic design sequences
produce stats for the TimeLords/SpaceTime system, but it\'s easy to convert
these to TNE or MT stats with the aid of a calculator and a bit of
ad-libbing. In theory, you can design heavy weapons (grenades, rockets,
mortars, etc.) as well, but I find that the time it takes is not worthwhile
for weapons like this (of course, if your Traveller players really like
mortars, it might be worthwhile).

3G also helps in converting vehicles designed in other systems to TNE. The
following design was done using GURPS Vehicles, and was converted to TNE
using 3G and a bit of guesswork.

Some design comments:
The design is for games set in the same universe as Steve Higginbotham\'s TCS
game. The Neubayern Federation splits power armour into three categories:
hardsuits, which are similar in size to Imperial Battledress; armoured
troopers, which are similar in size to  combat walkers from 2300AD; and
airborne battlemovers, which are really very small mecha.

The AB-2 follows the \'eggshell with sledgehammer\' school of design--it is
capable of dishing out far, far more damage than it can take. The idea is
that the pilot will use its high maneuverability and small size (compared to
a conventional armoured vehicle) to avoid getting hit in the first place.

Disclaimer--the idea for this design (not to mention the \'airborne
battlemover\' designation) was shamelessly ripped off from an anime series
titled Bubblegum Crisis.

                        AB-2 Airborne Battlemover

The AB-2 entered service with the Neubayern Army in 5621. Since that time
several variants have been developed. Some of the variants of the AB-2,
especially those intended for use by Marine and Special Forces units, are
quite expensive, costing more than some fighters. The AB-2 was designed
using GURPS Vehicles, and converted with the aid of 3G, the TNE rulebook,
and some guesswork. The current \'standard\' model is the AB-2C, which
mounts an x-ray gatling laser in place of the original polychromatic
gatling laser. Aside from this change in armament, the AB-2C is otherwise
identical to the AB-2.

Notes from GURPS design:

AB-2 has a sealed body with NBC kit. It has a limited lifesystem,
duration 48 hours.

When flying, the AB-2 is propelled by a reactionless thruster generating
5351 lbs. of thrust. On the ground, it has a 403.2KW leg drivetrain. It has
advanced controls and improved suspension.

Power comes from a 717.75 KW Fusion Reactor. I cut the endurance on one
load of fuel to the standard 30 days, down from 20 years.

The AB-2 is protected by advanced laminate armour, basic IR cloaking, a
laser sensor, a radar locator, a light deceptive radar jammer, and partial
stealth construction.

It carries a human-spectrum sensor array, a thermograph (range 5 miles),
ladar w/Track-While-Scan capability (range 28 miles), a multiscanner (range
7.5 miles),radar (range 80 miles), advanced low-light TV, and a
terrain-following system for the sensors that allows it to fly as low as
13.7 meters).

The AB-2 has an optical mini-computer (Complexity 5). It has an inertial
navigation system and GPS receiver. It carries an EM communicator, a secure
tactical radio (range 5000 miles), and IFF transponder. It uses a HUD
system with pupil scanner to present data to the wearer and target the
weapons.

The pilot rides in a linear seat--a cramped space surrounded by \'virtual
panorama\' of the Battlemover\'s surroundings. The seat is equipped with a
crashweb.

The AB-2 has two ST840 arms. Mounted on the left forearm is a heavy gatling
X-ray laser. Mounted on the right forearm is a heavy gauss minigun--there
are 10,000 rounds stored in the arm. The minigun can be controlled by the
computer to act as a close-in weapon system if needed.

The AB-2s principal weapon is a 35mm railgun in an auto-stabilized
universal open mount atop the torso. 200 rounds are stored in the
torso--the exact load varies, but generally at least 50 micronuke rounds
will be carried.

The torso also contains four linked light missile launcher and space for 80
missiles. The type of missile carried depends on mission and environment.
Generally, HEAT missiles will be carried in an inhabited area, and 1-ton
TacNuke missiles will be carried any other time.

A while back Loren posted a list of forthcoming TNE releases. Then in
Challenge 70, Dave Nielsen, aka Commodore Bwana, published a longer,
different list. The differences are in the 94 plan. Some of them can be
explained by title changes, but some of the other stuff introduced
intrigues me - especially the World Tamer\'s Guide. Is this an update to
the DGP World Builders Guide (itself an update to Grand Survey/Grand
Census)? Or something different? And given that this plan will
obviously change, is there an even more recent update?

The other thing is Striker II. Most people I know who bought that at
the time bought it for the design rules (and, admittedly, to run the
occasional small scale skirmish) rather than to actually run a
miniatures game with it. But now the design rules should all be in
FF&S, by my understanding. Will it contain additional design rules?
Will RAFM produce both 25mm and 15mm Traveller miniatures? As a bit of
free market research, I\'d much prefer a Squad Leader type boardgame to
a set of miniatures rules.

Yes please.

But not as complicated or as many rule extensions.

Something like the old Snapshot system for fighting through those
ship corridors.  In our current games the GM hand draws a rough situation
map and we place markers (in the form of potatoe chips, jelly beans,
smarties, dice, erasers, bottle tops) and then move them around with all
sorts of scale problems (not to mention accidentally eating someone\'s
carefully placed jelly bean  er  character).

Markable/eraseable map sheets would be nice too.

    'body' => 'Hi,

Hope this isn\'t repeating anything anyone\'s already said about Traveller-
like books, but if you want a series with an interesting view of FTL drives
and the definitive role-model for playing Aslans, I would heartily recommend
the C. J. Cherryh \'Chanur\' series. The first book can be read on its own, the
latter three (which, without popping home to check, I believe were: Chanur\'s
Venture, Revenge of the Kif, Chanur\'s Homecoming) are a trilogy which need to
be read as such. They are written from the viewpoint of an Aslan who doesn\'t
understand her point in the plot, and hence may initially appear a little
confusing. You pick up a lot more information on the second read :)

Other Cherryh books, e.g. Downbelow Station are also quite good; there\'s one
which I forget the name of, which is about freelance Belters and their fight
against the big Corps and the govt. All useful stuff.

The Chanur books also have some interesting considerations WRT the effects of
travelling close to the speed of light; the resulting combat tactics, etc.
Also, the male/female Aslan split in the Chanur books puts one in the correct
mentality to accept the limitations on Aslan male/female responsibilities in
Traveller.

I seem to recall that A Mote in God\'s Eye (Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle) had
some Traveller stuff - sandcasters and the like; but it is a few years since
I read that.

NB: To Loren Wiseman at GDW - with regard to my book, do you need to mail
(genuine postage stuff with stamps, etc.) to me, or is there a GDW
representative here in the UK that would be on hand to discuss it with?
Assuming you\'re still interested, of course... :)

NNB: Does anyone use a winking face ;) during their mailing? As in the Monty
Python nudge-nudge wink-wink, Is she a goer? ;)

I loved Peter Brenton\'s informative example of vacc suit skill levels. Does
anyone have any alternatives for other skills? e.g. Combat Rifleman:

Skill level    Examples of use
    None       Required to roll under IQ to know which end of gun is dangerous.
                99% likely to be blown over backwards when firing gun. Even
                large barns at close range are safe. Takes gun back to store
                for refund if gun doesn\'t work properly. Greater hazard to own
                troops than to enemy.
     0         Knows which end of gun to point at enemy. Fair chance of firing
                it without falling over. Moderately hazardous to barn-sized
                targets at close range. Remembers to take receipt with him
                when returning to gun shop; will accept exchange or repair
                rather than refund. Knows vaguely what a \'bullet\' is.
     1         Can fire combat rifles without being blown over, with enough
                accuracy to make barns want to stay at long or greater range.
                Knows how one or two selected weapons in the rifle category
                are stripped down, maintained, etc. Can make a good guess
                at others in the same category.
     2         Barns beware! Able to pick off man-sized targets at good ranges.
                Wandering gnats unbothered. Can strip down most weapons in
                rifleman category, possibly some from related (e.g. the non-
                combat rifleman category). Character can start to think about
                aiming for particular parts of an opponent (but without much
                chance of hitting beyond close range).
     3         Barns now find it important to hide behind large solid concrete
                defences. Come to think of it, so do the sensible human-sized
                targets. Characters can aim for particular parts of a target
                and hit it out to medium range if settled in a good firing
                position. Gnats annoyed by bullets buzzing past them.
     4         Barns retiring to other continents to regroup. Character can
                pick target areas on opponents - and hit - while travelling
                in slow-moving vehicles. Natural selection is starting to
                give a preference to those gnats that avoid the bullets.
     5         Mel Gibson\'s character in the Lethal Weapon films. Can strip
                down any rifle (possibly even alien designs) and rebuild it
                as any other rifle. Can improvise a Gauss rifle from two
                magnets, 5 toilet roll inners and a selection of sewing
                needles. Character can hit specific areas of moving targets
                at medium range while hanging upside down from a helicopter.
                Barns are required to retreat to other planets to remain
                safe from this sharp-shooter. Spends spare time shooting down
                gnats at 500 metres. Gnats attempt to form alliance with barns.
     6         No-one\'s ever this good (unless your characters are level 5
                sharp-shooters, in which case the arch bad-guys will always
                be level 6). Can teach others to make a Gauss rifle as per 5.
                Can pick-off enemy eye-balls at 500 km with eyes closed.
                Can ruin a gnat\'s prospects of a fulfilling sex-life at up to
                500 metres. Barns give up and surrender en-masse.

I wouldn\'t go so far as to say no PCs should ever reach level 5, 6, or even
7 or higher.  Keep in mind that, with very very rare exception, people that
good fall into two categories:
  a) very old and experienced (limitations due to age)
  b) very young and "hot"

The "hot" youngsters will likely be taking risks left and right because
95% of the time they CAN barrel roll the ungainly freighter and get
on the fighter\'s tail.  That 5% of the time they mess up, though,
they\'ll probably leave pieces of freighter all over the sky, with
the confused enemy fighter wondering what happened.  If you game
often enough, the really good who play "hot" will self-limit their
usefulness by killing themselves.  A few players are smart enough
to avoid that, but not most.

If not... well, there seems to be this effect in the universe which
brings equally strong opponents together to challenge one another
to find out whos the best....

The sophonts that Lilly describe as Aslan are called hani in Ms. Cherryh\'s
books.  The are not Aslan.  The similarities to Aslan include the fact that
each political group is composed of an extended family, led by a male
leader.  The leader resides on the home planet where he rules an area of
land with the absolute power of a dictator.  The sophonts ARE Leonine.  Of
particular note is that the hani were given the technology for starships by
another race who introduced them into the interstellar schene of things as
an ally against a third race.  This is similar to the fact that the Aslan
did not develop their jump drive but copied it from the wreckage of a
humaniti vessel.

The differences to Aslan far outweigh the similarities.  The males are only
allowed to hold a certain number of jobs.  Other than leading the family
they can be scientists, lawyers, or artists.  Females do all the labor that
their economy relies upon.  The females crew the starships, they run the
day to day operations of the family compound.  The leader must also rely on
the support of his females if he plans to continue to hold the power in the
family holding.  The leader is either deposed by an usurper or killed by
the usurper.  The females can prevent this by preventing the usurper from
challenging the male.

Males are considered too unstable, too tempermental, and too aggressive to
do anything else.  When a male gets of age they are sent out of the family
compound to fend for themselves in the wilderness.  If they survive battles
with other males and living in the wilderness, then they may be able to
eventually overthrow a male head of household.  That is their ONLY hope of
being a contributing member of their society. They are not allowed on
starships for fear that their temperment would endanger the lives of the
crew.

The aliens that the hani deal with include three other oxygen breathing
species and three methane breathing species.  The first book deals with the
problem of a lone human who ends up on a hani ship.  It is from the point
of few of a hani who does not want to be pawn of alien politics.  The next
three books deal with the return of the human to the aliens and his
involvement with the hani ship from the first book.  The first four books
also deal with the introduction of a male onto the hani ships, and the
political, and psychological problems this causes.  The fifth book deals
with the one of the characters from the first four, as she is now the
captain of her own ship.

These books are extremely well written.  Chanur\'s Homecoming nearly won the
Hugo award, but was beaten by Ender\'s Game.  Downbelow Station and Cyteen
each won the Hugo, and take place in the same science fiction universe.
However, they do not involve the aliens.

The books offer an extremely good view of a merchant operation, and
especially how one could run such an adventure and make it interesting in a
Traveller setting.  My own campaign is currently based on a situation
similar to that presented in Cherryh\'s books.  The players are running a
large merchant company, (five very large freighters), as well as personally
running a exploration vessel.  The exploration vessel is being used to
explore the new market in the alien space.  I have heard comments that
merchant campaigns are boring and go slow, but I suppose people think there
is just the object of buying low and selling high.

The system is a mixture
of 2300AD and Albedo.  Influences are from Traveller as well as the
numerous science fiction books I have read.

And so in this light, how many people out there run merchant campaigns,
or play in them? What is your opinion of merchant campaigns? Are they fun?

In-Reply-To: <9312140131.AA12631@engrg.uwo.ca>
Bruce/Alistair - do you guys sit next to one another?

Bruce: "Something like the old Snapshot system ..."
According to Challenge 70, "Vampire Ship" (one of the 94 releases) will
fulfil the role of Azhanti High Lightning, way back, including "a
combat system optimized for boardgame play". This would seem to cover
the shipboard combat, or that within structures. It would be
interesting to know the proposed scales though - are we still looking
at 15mm?
It\'s not much good though for squad level combat, which is where
Striker II is presumably aimed. I\'m not really that keen on building
and painting a vast collection of 15mm (or for that matter 25mm, or H/O
scale) miniatures, especially as it\'s unlikely I\'d find someone else in
the same position (and if I did, they\'d most likely be a collection of
orcs and mechs). So I\'ll reiterate my desire for a game on the SL
model.

Bruce: jelly beans
Actually I used to use the SJG cardboard heroes a fair bit. I threw in
the traveller ones when I sold my original collection, way back (now
just about reassembled, at some cost, sob). Anybody else remember them?
They were drawn by Kevin Simbeida (sp?), who has since gone on to
greater (or lesser, depending upon your perspective) things. I still
have the Villains and Vigilantes ones somewhere. I\'m thinking of making
my own now that I have this vast array of DTP technology at my
disposal. I\'ll try and get them onto sunbane if and when I do.
By the way, look out for the forthcoming RAFM line of 25mm jelly beans
:-).

Alistair: "Especially if the rules were more towards the simplicity of
the GDW First Battle games, not Squad Leader."
I haven\'t tried the First Battle series, not being a big wargamer. In
the case of SL, you have to distinguish between the original SL (or
Panzer Leader, which was also brilliant) and ASL, or for that matter
the SL gamettes (the whole armor system changed between SL and Cross of
Iron, as I remember. But then I also liked Cross of Iron - I gave up
after Crescendo of Doom).
I\'m beginning to get really turned on to this idea though -
imagine scenario pull outs in each issue of Challenge along the lines
of the ASL ones the General .... hmmm.

Andy: [C J Cherryh\'s books] "there\'s one which I forget the name of,
which is about freelance Belters and their fight against the big Corps
and the govt."
I suppose that\'s Heavy Time (it has a sequel, which is on my shelf but
which I haven\'t yet read - Hellburner) but there seem to be so many
novels set in the merchanter universe (I count 17, including 5 Chanur
novels. "Downbelow Station" and "Cyteen" both won Hugos) I\'m not quite
sure. The Chanur novel you missed was "Chanur\'s Legacy". I think there
was a posting on TML a short while back about a Cherryh list.

Andy: A Mote in God\'s Eye
Well, Niven is always good for ideas. Unfortunately Pournelle (or at
least the proximity of Pournelle) seems to dilute them with gung-ho
militarism and jarring anachronisms (viz: the coffee perculator).
Published Traveller material sometimes seems to owe more to this book
than I\'d like (viz: the pool table in Arrival Vengeance). Again,
there\'s a sequel (in the US: the Gripping Hand, in the UK, the Moat
Around Murcheson\'s Eye) just out, but whereas a few years ago I would
have been picketing the authors\' house(s) for the manuscript, I\'ll be
content to wait till it hits the remainder bins.

I\'ve got about a section of fully-armed, battle-dressed 15mm lead figures that
I just adore.  \'Course the SJG cardboard heros generally fit in much better for
adventure-type scenarios.  I\'d also be interested in any current suppliers of
15mm (or 25mm) hi-tech lead/plastic/paper figures.  If something similar to
"cardboard heroes" could be made available via FTP, I\'d be ecstatic.  :)


Merchant campaigns:

I\'d be up for it, but since I just re-read all 7 of the foundation novels by
Asimov, and he only devoted a few sections of the series to the merchant-
princes, I wonder how much general interest there would be.  OTOH, that was
several centuries of the first Foundation\'s history, so maybe it\'d be
worthwhile.

Books:

Asimov\'s future history (gotta read it, if not love it.)
Orson Scott Card\'s Ender\'s Game and Speaker for the Dead

Rules:

One of the things that I liked about Striker was that it allowed one to view
(or hide) as much detail of the encounter as seemed necessary.  Small
encounters could be on a smaller scale, with each individual visible while
large-scale encounters (battles) could be viewed on a large-scale map, with the
represented units being considerably larger, as well.

The other part was the design rules, _finally_ (historically) we had a
nutznboltz method of creating things.

I\'d also like to see something equivilant to Trillion Credit Sqadron, and Fifth
Fronteir War.

That said, I think I can summarize my feelings by saing that it would be really
really cool to have a system (or integrated set of systems) that would allow
one to interact with various scales of the univers that surrounds, not just
militarily, but economically, politcally, etc.

Excelsior!

Yep, I have the first three sets, and use then extensively now, with
deck plans and an erasable hex mat.  They work fine (you can even write
the Character\'s name above them), and it\'s relatively easy to
make more, either by using a copying machine to reduce sillouettes (sp?)
or published artwork, or by drawing your own (which is what I do, freehand).
Cheap and easy!!

Zhodani?

	Well, Having gotten Anigen out of my hair, I return to a project of my own
that I think is kinda a neat program. I\'m designing a custom combat armor
generator along the same line as anigen (interface-wise) using the generation
rules supplied by Mr. Wilson. They are modified to allow Weight and Volume
calculations now. I am also going to be including options for installed
equipment in the armor (Built in computers, communicators, IR/LI goggles, Data
Display/Recorder Headpiece, etc...) and have run into a prob. I\'d like to bring
Power rules into the whole thing, but am lacking power consumption figures for
the various pieces of equipment. Further, with Battle Dress, how much power
does Battle Dress require and for how long? What Strength bonuses does Battle
Dress yield? This would all be nice to know.

	Anyhow, I know this sounds like a Mech Builder, but it\'s not that detailed.
I\'m just trying to allow the design of combat armor with add-ons.

	If anyone has power consumption figures on some common equiment or a method
by which I can derive said figures (legally from the rules), please let me
know. I may end up posting this program, if Loren and GDW give it the O.K.

Nah.  Alistair sits way down the other end of the building in
the anex with the rest of those cringing system software
beasties.  But he is my GM at the moment ...

My problem with Squad Leader was that I only got into the first
two games and only managed infrequent playing so I had to
continually re-read the rules.  If your heavily into the gaming
then more complex rules are fine but it would be nice to have
a quick/simple version and a more detailed version with the
OPTIONAL rules.

Another variation would be along the lines of Panzer Leader and
Panzer Blitz which worked at the platoon (?) level and had some
nice simple mechanics.  I don\'t have the games anymore but we
had some Division level engagements that would leave you with
hands full of hair and looking as bald as I do.  Hey, now I know
where the hair\'s gone and it might also explain those grey bits
too!!

Sorry if my data on the Chanur books seemed a little bit hazy, its a while
since I last read them; I wasn\'t expecting to get jumped on for not quoting
them verbatim, etc. :)

I merely brought them to people\'s attention because, as pointed out in
subsequent messages, they provide a good background for merchants, give an
interesting viewpoint on how an alien race might view humans, and also an
insight into what the Aslan society might have been based upon (back in the
mists of time when they owned only a few planets). Okay, so once they spread
out a bit, the males had to take a greater part in society, etc.

The alien races in the Chanur series are equally interesting in that they\'re
not just the standard anthropomorphic bug-eyed aliens which can magically
talk \'common speak\' and either act like humans or are quite clearly marked out
to be the blood-sucking monsters for the players to shoot down. If you want
a good way to confuse your players for a while, get them trying to communicate
with the k\'nnn (even sharing the same flying space could be hazardous!)

Matt: cardboard heroes
I\'m not aware of any more after the first three, although the ads in
JTAS said to look out for Vargr and vehicles as the next sets. Pity.
If anyone knows of somewhere still selling them I\'d be interested

Allen: merchant campaigns
Sigh. Well, merchant campaigns require the same basic rules of campaign
design as most other, although a couple of things are slightly easier.
Take the elements from the classic traveller plot advice: pull, push,
enigma and gimmicks.

The pull is basically a combination of curiosity/exploration and the
desire to make money. They\'re the basics of a merchant campaign. The
gimmicks might be weird cargoes, but equally they could be stuff
smuggled aboard by passengers, stolen from important people, etc etc.
Also the traditional traveller patron exists to add push/pull. If you
can add people occasionally chasing the PCs for some reason, all the
better. Enigmas are harder to come by, and easier to manage by and
large by introducing important NPCs with something to hide.

Where merchant campaigns are easier are that the pull is more easily
defined than in a more aimless exploratory campaign. Also, if you can
establish that there is a clear trade route which takes the PCs through
a loop of about, say, 8 systems with a profitable cargo each turn,
including the trip from the 8th back to the first, then you have
something that satisfies the players mercantile desires and at the same
time leaves you as a referee to concentrate on detailing a defined
number of systems. Once you have that, fleshing out the NPCs alot more
(start with the starport people, and try to get the PCs to establish
long term trading relationships with the brokers and traders in the
various systems) and developing the character and background of the
respective worlds will generate their own scenarios.

I realise this isn\'t what you asked for, but it really makes for more
interesting campaigns than a series of scenarios generated off of the
back of gimmick cargoes. If you want gimmick cargoes, then I guess
there are the usual ones - drugs, weapons, secrets, novelty goods and
so on. Artifacts of various kinds are better, the more unique the
better as they will pull various people chasing after them. The best
cargoes for generating interest though are people, IMHO.

By the way, another refereeing rule I used to have when I ran a weekly
traveller campaign was that the session stopped when the PC\'s jumped
system. Since the jump time was about a week this added a "real-time"
element. It also meant that the players were incented to spend a decent
amount of time in any particular system, so that the stuff I had
prepared got used, and I was given time to prepare for the next
session.

Other stuff:
I bought Challenge 71 a while ago but only got time to read it the
other night. Some comments:
- - when does Challenge go back to monthly status
- - I enjoyed reading the designer notes. In the BL designer notes Dave
Nilsen says that "we will eventually re-release 2300 as a campaign
setting using the TNE rules". This is the closest I have seen to a
commitment on this. Are there dates planned?
- - TNS - I\'m as annoyed as some other TMLers seem to be about the last
couple of TNS\'s. Couldn\'t GDW have provided some stuff covering the
interim period in the regency, which presumably still has a news
service? Also it seems to comeback online at the end as an interactive
channel, has FTL communication now been introduced? Given we now have a
bimonthly frequency this is pretty shoddy stuff.
- - Space Race is a Megatraveller scenario. The other stuff is TNE. None
of this is actually marked in the magazine. What about the people who
came in new with TNE trying to make sense of the MT ship designs?
- - Straits of Magellan seems pretty standard Challenge scenario fare.
What worries me though is that the subsector map is for a previously
unpublished subsector and only indicates TNE data. As I\'ve said before
I think it good practice for GDW to include both pre- and post-collapse
maps when they publish, as per the TNE book ... one of the
possibilities Loren and others have mooted for those who don\'t like the
TNE background is to site their campaigns in the pre-collapse era using
the TNE rules. Is this possible avenue being closed off also?
- - Finally, Challenge continues to feature a lot of mediocre material on
games that are treated better elsewhere (basically most of the games
that GDW does not produce itself). I don\'t like T2000 or Merc:2000
(and I don\'t really think they qualify as Science Fiction), and I\'m not
familiar with Dark Conspiracy, but I accept their presence in Challenge
as that is about the only place they would get support anyhow. But I
think Challenge could be improved considerably by concentrating on the
games it knows best.

Sledge Hammer!  Admittedly he has Handgun 6 rather than Combat Rifle 6, but
you get the idea.  Can shoot the gun out of the other guy\'s hand with a
snap shot.  Can shoot the tyres of a moving vehicle with one hand, and drink
coffee from the cup in the other hand.

Since no-one else seems to have done it, here\'s my list for Pilot:

None		Needs to roll against intelligence to find the right queue at
		the starport.  Flies as well with his eyes open as with his
		eyes closed, i.e. has trouble finding the seat.  Knows what a
		ship is - it\'s a big thing which goes "whoosh".  Imagine your
		favourite politician flying a ship.

0		Knows one end of a ticket from the other.  Can make a stick,
		knob or push-button go in the right direction.  Can keep the
		ship straight and level while the ship is in deep space.
		Knows what a ship is - it\'s over 100 tonnes, goes "whoosh",
		but only in an atmosphere.  Imagine yourself flying a ship.

1		Has a basic idea of what controls to look for, and where to
		find them on one or two ships.  Can perform simple manoeuvres,
		up to and including landing and taking off.  Can keep the ship
		straight and level in an atmosphere with a light wind.  Knows
		what a ship is - it can make interstellar jumps.  Imagine
		yourself flying a ship if you\'re good at video games.

2		Basic professional level.  Can recognise the controls on a
		variety of ships.  Can perform any manoeuvre in the book.
		Can keep the ship straight and level in any atmosphere.  Knows
		what a jump drive is.  Imagine your favourite airliner pilot
		flying a ship.

3		Advanced professional level.  Can recognise the controls on
		any ship designed by his species.  Can perform any manoeuvre
		in the book, even if the ship has been slightly damaged.  Can
		keep the ship straight and level any time he feels like it.
		Knows where the jump drive is.  Imagine an Air Force fighter
		pilot flying a ship.

4		Really advanced professional level.  Can make an attempt at
		figuring out the controls on a ship designed by any sentient
		species.  Can perform any manoeuvre he feels like.  Can keep
		the ship straight and level, but gets bored doing so.  Can
		yell at the engineer to fix the jump drive, and land the ship
		at the same time.  Imagine your favourite WW2 air ace flying
		a ship.

5		Amazingly advanced level.  Can reliably work out what the
		controls on any ship will do.  Invents new manoeuvres on a
		regular basis.  Straight and level is for wimps.  Can kick
		the engineer if the jump drive isn\'t fixed real soon, and
		keep on the tail of the enemy ship at the same time.  Luke
		Skywalker is level 5.

6		Disgustingly advanced level.  Ignores the controls.  Gets the
		engineer to rig up switches so he can control all the engines
		manually.  Straight and level is for dead people - this guy
		does loops while asleep, just before landing.  Doesn\'t need
		to threaten the engineer because the engineer worships him.
		Luke Skywalker would be level 6 if he concentrated on flying
		and ignored unimportant stuff like the Force.

As an occational T/M:2000 author, I object to that characterization.
Science Fiction (and good gaming) are where you find them.

George objects to my comments on T/M:2000 in Challenge:

Well, firstly on the subject of whether they are Science Fiction, they
would qualify under the inclusion of everything that could possibly
include a science fiction element, and a GM could swing the game into
cyberpunk and other near future SF genres, but is that why people are
playing these games? If they should be included with the comment "SF is
where you find it", then it seems to me that ANY game can be included
and the "Magazine of Science Fiction Gaming" is absolutely meaningless.

To me, the millenial setting seems to be meant to provide a slightly
nastier future in which opportunities for military scenarios are more
prevalent. I don\'t think it is really to introduce the effects of
scientific or technological speculation.

Having said which, I didn\'t mean that these games should be taken out
of Challenge (although I\'d be happy if they were). Whatever one might
think of the other GDW games, the material for them in Challenge is of
a relatively high standard. It\'s the stuff for Shadowrun, Cthulhu,
2020, etc, etc which I don\'t like, because there are other magazines
that provide better coverage of those games.

	While heaving a huge sigh of relief after finals, I have reopened another
of my many cans of worms in the Traveller area only to find myself baffled.

	Does anyone out there have any idea how GDW generated the Max Number of

with my limited mathematical background and a hand calculator, been able to
piece any mathematical progression together... Not with Tech Level or Model

	Now, as I am endeavoring to piece together some set of rules for designing
and producing stats on computers of all kinds (Hand, Personal, Subdermal,
Megacomps, Mainframes, etc...) this, and the inability to figure out just
how many CPU units and Storage units (from the Robots Book) to allot such
creatures based on given knowledge, gives me a major headache.

	So, anyone with the time to send me some info on this stuff would gain my
most maniacal appretiation. I also promise to share these rules once done,
provided they are worth the media they are stored on. (This has yet to be
seen.)

Note that at TL7 & 8, you have a variety of fairly effective IR, ladar, and ground radars.
(See TK2000 as well as various other millitary equipment descriptions for the last 20
years).  While a S&G Team are probably good enough to damp out the radar (usually
a good clue that there\'s a problem brewing), IR and ladar systems can find them.
S&G Teams have advantages, not milk runs.

Only if the person chose a mercantile career of some sort.  One advantage to the
TK2000 & DC systems was that several careers provided varying incomes based
on skills needed in that career.  That was something I suggested they keep.

Hmm.  No rules that I can off-hand remember, but various costs that come to mind from
modern salvage over the last 100 years:

1 - Orbit or docking fees for wherever they bring the Gazelle (not to mention for the
    vessel used to get to the Gazelle).  If they connect her up to a base, there is power,
    water, and air; possibly a temporary registration fee (possibly a safety inspection fee),
    spaceport computer fees (if hooked up), food (and other lodging if ship is unlivable) costs.
    Not to mention ship insurance.  These fees can mount up over time -
    and you may be talking about a lot of time.

    Getting the attention of a naval bureacucracy
    can take time (message runs through channels to a procurement branch, who has
    to find a military salvage evaluator, who has to get to the ship to inspect it, return
    his office, write a report on its current condition and value, have the report percolate through
    channels back to the procurement branch, who then has to decide if they want to buy
    the ship, then has to pass a financial board\'s review of the procurement decision (who
    decides if they will release the money for the ship procurement), then a ships crew has
    to be found and gathered to take possession of the vessel...

2 - If they plan to keep it or operate it:  Registration fees for the ship, research into a title search
    (To prove that the ship wasn\'t stolen or that there is not a current lien against the ship held by
    another party), safety inspections, weapons licensing, repair costs, plus the docking fees
    mentioned above.

On the other hand, if they DO sell the vessel back to the Navy, they will (eventually) receive
approximately 1/4 the value of the vessel less the cost of damage repair (even if the Navy will
do the repairs, it still costs them resources of people, equipment, facility use, etc.) and a
factor for the wear on the vessel.

Before doing the math, and sticking with the concept, I arrived at basically the same conclusion:
If they can so finely manipulate gravity, why not just stick with gravitic drives and
avoid a MAJOR retcon that makes most of the ships from Classic and MegaTraveller cease
to work in TNE?

I just tut-tutted and put it down as another reason not to buy TNE.  Sorry Loren.

tech-level and station facilities. The decks of Serabi Orbital
are well trodden by all spacers. Amongst certain circles,
though, it is best known as the centre of virtual reality games.
The Real-Vision hardware is made here and The Red Wizard
software brand is based on the station.

Red Wizard produces a wide range of virtual reality games and
entertainment software. It leads the field in depth and
complexity of software and inter-playability. The latter is a
strong feature whereby you can carry forth treasures gained from
one Red Wizard game may be carried over into another. Even
occasionally from one genre to another.

This is done by maintaining structured laws of how the world
works. "Phantasy Physics" is the buzz-word amongst the
programmers. On a more general level the different genres are
cross-compatable on many areas and convertible on many more.
This has allowed them to make advances across all genres in
their products. The strong sense of consistency amongst Red
Wizard games had lead to the highest rate of Product Loyalty in
this market.

The company is run by "The Red Wizard" himself, a long-term
games devisor and writer. At the end of any game during the
credits his analogue appears and conducts a satisfaction survey.
What was initially received with irritation developed into kind
of a game where during the last few minutes any players would
expend all remaining ammo in an attempt to destroy the Red
Wizard. There is rumoured to be one set of clues in each game to
reveal how to destroy him.

Technicalities aside, this has made possible the Event of the
Year amongst all "Virtual People" -- The Serabi Critter
Competition.

Each year the best Red Wizard games are taken from each genre
along with the highest scoring players. They are then run in the
Serabi Virtual Centre in parallel with each other. The teams and
critters from each genre compete against each other for overall
supremacy.

After the competition the joint game runs for a few weeks for
the public to try their hand at.

The Critter Competition and virtual reality games in general
allow a Referee to take a break from normal play and insert in
any  alternate adventure they wanted to play. I did a post a few
months back on how I used the Virus background as a VR games. It
is a great way of using up old D&D modules.

It also gives you the chance to introduce film, book, and media
nasties from all sources against the players in a non-permanent
environment.

The upcoming Critter Competition in my campaign consists of the
following:

MODERN: Bughunt on Ryleh
Your squad of Imperial Marines hunt vicious acid blooded aliens
across the weird un-human architecture of a recently risen
island...

FANTASY: Dragonriders of Prynn
Your staltward band of adventuring warriors must battle against
the recent invasion of dragons from the mountains...

HISTORICAL ROMANCE: Revenge of the Jheddi
The last survivors of a old Vilani Order battle evil elements of
the Empire of Man in the days before the Psionic Suppression
using the mysterious mental power of The Force...

VAUDVILLE: The Pirates of Parlance
A whimsical band of rogues assault and romp with you through
many adventures. But you can\'t hit them while they are singing...

- ----

The Serabi Entertainment service "RED CHANNEL" is please to have
in the studio tonight M. Neil Hart, one of the prime developers
of "Bughunt on Ryleh", winner of this years critter
competition. Neil, are you pleased with your results?

NH:	"It was kind of inevitable."
RC:	"So you were confident from the start that your critters
	would come out on top. Many people were backing the adventurers
	from Dragonriders. This is their third year in the competition."
NH:	"They had the advantage of long range weapons and flight but
	those aren\'t winning strategies, just delaying tactics. You
	can\'t win with that, only place."
RC:	"What about the Jheddi Monks?"
NH:	"Pah. My aliens are just animals, not subject to psionic powers.
	Their Weapons of Power are only so much plasma. My aliens just
	breed to fast for them. And the Evil Empire were less equipped
	than the Imperial Marines from its own stomping ground."
RC:	"What about the pirates. There are some accusations that you
	cheated by making your critters immune to their singing."
NH:	"That\'s a pack of lies. My aliens can only hear certain select
	ranges of sound. It is a defence mechanism against sonic weapons.
	When the pirates hit the chorus the left the active range and
	were only good for incubators", he smirks.
RC:	"It must be disappointing that getting that close it wasn\'t an
	overall victory. There was one survivor from your own genre,
	Lt. Ellen, the Warrant Officer."
NH:	In agitation, "The ultimate creature of destruction in all the
	universe! And she attacks it with a fork-lift! Fluke, complete
	fluke. She should have been gutted with the rest."
RC:	"You seem quite attached to your critter..."
NH:	Interrupting, "You can\'t just call it a critter. It really is
	the ultimate in destruction. When I designed it a ran through
	infinite regression tests and self-improving loops. The generator
	was self modifying and self-constructing. My aliens came out
	of the other end. It is the ultimate."
RC:	"I\'ve heard rumours that the Red Wizard himself is talking about
	cutting them down. Surely an ultimate beast, as you put it, is
	to deadly for entertainment."
NH:	Getting angry, "Such shortsightedness. He can\'t admit when he is
	beaten. It\'s all because my alien ate his analogue..."
RC:	"Neil, you do take this all rather personally. Surely, no matter
	how devised, you critter, sorry, alien, is just a collection of
	heuristics and behavioural algorithms? There will be other
	projects."
NH:	"Your DNA is just a collection of heuristics and behavioural
	algorithms. Did your mother move on to something else after
	you? Yes, I have other projects in mind." He smiles here. "But
	I\'m not telling..."

Hello All:

	 Well, just one more problem with having a REAL 3d game of traveller. I
have been fiddling with the idea of running Traveller (Or my Home-brew mix of
stuff) in what I call the Terran Confederation (No ties to any Traveller
meaning). This involves the use of the "Near Stars within 25pc of Earth" list
thing that I found at explorer.arc.nasa.gov (Thanks to some person on the TML
whose name elludes me...).

    I wrote a little C program that changed the format of the data into that of
Starchart and decided to display all 2150 stars at once... What a muddle! So
those that said it would be hell to organize the data in 3D... Hats off!

    At least, if we were to do it, we\'d need better mapping software.

    Anyhow, I hadn\'t heard if anyone else had tried it and just wanted to let
you all know someone did. If anyone wants the package and the star data file,
let me know and I\'ll arrange for it to be sent ;-) .

    'body' => 'In an interview with Neil Hart, creator of the aliens in
"Bughunt on Rlyeh", winner of this year\'s Critter Competition...

RC:	"You seem quite attached to your critter..."
NH:	Interrupting, "You can\'t just call it a critter. It really is
	the ultimate in destruction. When I designed it a ran through
	infinite regression tests and self-improving loops. The generator
	was self modifying and self-constructing. My aliens came out
	of the other end. It is the ultimate."
RC:	"Neil, you do take this all rather personally. Surely, no matter
	how devised, you critter, sorry, alien, is just a collection of
	heuristics and behavioural algorithms? There will be other
	projects."
NH:	"Your DNA is just a collection of heuristics and behavioural
	algorithms. Did your mother move on to something else after
	you? Yes, I have other projects in mind." He smiles here. "But
	I\'m not telling..."

	Neil Hart has become increasingly dissatisfied in Red Wizard
software. Even his own workgroup which helped with Bughunt have distanced
themselves from him due to his refusing to share the glory of their
program\'s success. Through hackers he has gotten wind that senior
managment and The Red Wizard (who personally doesn\'t like him) have made
a committment to the group to change him from being their leader. He
was in the process of fortifying his position when he was approached
by Tersad Bio-Engineering, PLC.
	Tersad is not a very reputable company and has been the subject
of several Imperial investigations. Over its 140 year history it has been
found guilty of experimental testing on humans, selling fatal viruses
without researching cures, eugenics research, environment destroying
bacteria and several other major ethical counts.
	The interview with Neil Hart caught their attention. Many of their
major customers are military bent on destruction by any means possible.
Neil is correct: "DNA is just a collection of heuristics and behavioural
algorithms." What Tersad seek to do is to implement the heuristics of
Neils alien, not in virtual reality, but in a genetic lab.
	Neil doesn\'t know enough about genetics to tell them it can
definately be done but he is sure that the same self-modifying, etc,
techniques can be applied in genetic simulation to produce the same
result. He has agreed to sell out to them.

Several possibilities for adventures exist:

*)	Assisting in the extraction of Neil Hart. Either Neil or Tersad
	has approached the players. They are to be hired to get Neil and
	several datacards from a restricted area of Red Wizard Software
	on Serabi Spaceport to the Tersad system.
*)	Finding Neil Hart. Red Wizard Software hires the players to find
	out where he has gone and to recover stolen property.
*)	Investigation of Tersad. An inside mole has tipped off the Imperial
	authorities that something is up in Tersad. The players are hired
	as an unofficial agency to infiltrate and investigate.
*)	Neil wants out of Tersad. Either because he can now see the gross
	inhumanity of their operation (they only use "volunteers" now for
	testing) or because he has discovered he can\'t deliver what he
	promised. He contacts the players to help in his own extraction.
*)	Neil has a change of heart. The alien synthesis is successful.
	After seeing the aliens tested on real people he decideds that
	his creation shouldn\'t really see the light of day. He hires the
	players to extract him. Their mission is helped by the fact that
	he has engineered one fatal flaw into the creatures (they don\'t
	like light opera music).
*)	Contact is lost with Tersad Bio-Engineering. The players either
	have to deliver a shipment to the remote base or are called in
	to investigate. The base has been taken over by aliens.
*)	The planet of Tersad is experiencing major problems with an
	invasion of aliens. The players mercenary unit is called in to
	guard or rescue a rich patrons estate.

 160 pages plus a small insert.  Nice cover.  Most everything you want
in tech design (see bottom of page 4).  Some very informative pictures
to go with the text.

 Rather byzantine in spots. No Acronym Table!  Requires some page flipping
(similar to Striker\'s design rules, if you need an organizational parallel).
A rather amusing idea for fixing a printing mistake on page 75 (Loren
claims a warm radiator is all you need...).

 Final opinion:  Not At This Time...

Have you tried the map that came with Traveller 2300?  The map is done out
to about 16 parsecs so it doesn\'t cover all the area you want but it is
already done on a handy map sheet.  The stars are already in the database
you have (in fact yours is more accurate!).

Also, if you want some additional detail about stars in the area you
cover look up Burnham\'s Celestial Handbook.  Three volumes covering stars
in all constellations.  Major stars are covered in detail with orbital
and physical descriptions.  It\'s in trade paperback and the whole set
runs about $40.00 or should be available in libraries.

	 Actually, yep I have heard about that map. Had a friend who had it too,
but alas he sold all his stuff before I got my hands on the map. Yeesh. Around
here, the GDW representation is pretty bad (well, for anything other than T2K).

     Also, I\'m looking at programming a 3D MegaT star system generation
and display program. I guess it\'ll be like Library, but I\'m looking at
Graphical display of star proximity and distance between stars. I\'m also gonna
put in jump route stuff (but if all goes well with the above, that\'ll be a
piece of cake!). This is still a kicking around idea, but would be neat...

	 First I gotta put together some Computer rules and get the armor generator
done. That should be fairly soon.

     Still leavin\' out robots rules, eh. Oh well. I just got Book 8: Robots
(Thanks you know who!) and am pleased that I have that. It is a shame that
there isn\'t a TNE implementation of robots. However, a suggestion for the
GDW dudes: If such a supplement were to arrive, it would be really neat if
there were computer rules, program rules and robot rules all in one supplement.
Physical construction should be along the lines of FF&S (since that\'s the
current standard) and computer rules and robot brain rules should agree. I\'m
trying to adapt the computer rules for my game without fracturing the current
specs for Robots and Ship Computers, but having little success.

	 Anyway, I\'ve ranted long enough. Hope I haven\'t offended. In the meantime,
belated Merry Christmas/Happy Hanukah and a Happy New Year!

Computer rules would be cool.  If you\'re talking about armor generation
for TNE, they have them in FF&S.

Also, the logical place for Computer/Robot rules would be in
the Virus book, which we can\'t expect until late 94... at the earliest.
However, I think if you came up with a good set of rules, you could
get them published (in some form) in Challenge, which would
make them "official".

     Hmmm. Never considered the TNE thingy. I\'ve been stuck in Mega for such
a long time that TNE never crossed my mind. I guess anything I come up with
will be cross-compatible. Either way, I\'ll post them when/if they ever work
out.

	 Published??? Wow! Never considered that either. Who\'d publish me! ;->

*** Issue #1 ***

I spoke to Kevin Knight on the phone last night and he informed me that he
has almost sold out of issue #1 of TTC. He says that there are only about
25 copies left, and that he is no longer selling them retoactively with
new subscriptions. (However, you may still suscribe starting with issue #2
if you want too.) Kevin asked me to post a message here letting people
know that he is now selling issue #1 of TTC individually for $5.00 (US)
each. If anyone is interested in getting a copy before they are sold out,
I\'d suggest you act soon.


*** Issue #3 ***

Feature Adventure:

TTC #3 will be going to the printers late next week. The feature adventure
this issue is "Bonnie Venture" and is written by none other than Mark
"Geo" Gelinas. I have not seen a draft of it, but Kevin tells me it is an
excellent adventure set within the Regency in 1120. All stats in the
adventure are in the TNE format. Kevin says it is a LARGE adventure
(30,000+ words), and will likely take up 1/4 of the issue.


Far Frontiers:

Issue #2 will also contain at least two more subsectors (three if there is
room) for The Far Frontiers sector.


Mercury Quest:

Issue #3 concludes "Mercury Quest" pt.3 - Traveller fiction written by
Gary Kalin. I won\'t give anything away, but I will say that I think most
people will be pleased with the way in which this story ends...(nuff said).

New Artist:

I would also like to take this chance to welcome aboard an artist from the
UK whose work will appear in this issue. His name is Tim Osborne, and you
might has seen his before in Signal-GK. (I thought his cover/deckplans for
S-GK #7 were outstanding! - Now if I can just talk him into submitting a
set of deckplans to us!).

Well, I suppose I\'ve said enough..... :) Happy Travelling!

  Er. Probably not.  The computers in TNE are entirely different.  You
don\'t pick an arbitrary model number anymore (they were arbitrary in MT,
anyway; the model# >= jump# rule was missing), you install one or more
computers of your chosen tech level.  That\'s it.  The only differences
within a tech level for the big comps are the flight/standard/optical
progression and the number of comps you install.  Your comps must be
the same tech level as your sensors and control systems.

  Not Challenge, if it\'s a MegaTraveller article.  According to the
submission guidelines, it\'s TNE or nothing.  The recent issues have
been printing the backlog of MT articles as fast as is practical.
They don\'t seem to want any more of them.  With TNE (and now FF&S) in
the stores, I can\'t say I blame them.
  If your work is still MT-compatible when it\'s done, The Traveller
Chronicle might print it (see message 6499 from last night).  TTC
is a "Traveller" magazine in the same way this list seems to be a
"Traveller" list.  Not just Classic, not just MT, and not just TNE.
All of them.  Right, Paul?

 That said, I find the lack of apparent enthusiasm for TNE on this
list distressing and annoying.  Distressing because of the "It\'s
different. I don\'t like different" attitude which accompanies much
of the discussion, and annoying because all the big-volume posters
seem to have fled to the pocket-empire list (a list with "No Loitering,
Private Property" posted at the door), and abandoned the main TML.
It got worse when the folks who wanted to playtest the FF&S preview
material went and formed _another_ list to follow that activity.
The TML was left a shadow of its former self during this time.  The
enthusiasm for these projects that could have infected the rest of
the list was kept behind closed doors (and still is), and thus was
wasted on those who needed no encouragement.
 Please don\'t think that I consider these other lists a "bad thing."
Each has a specific mission that it pursues vigorously (I assume,
not being a member of either).  Their isolation from this list is
what bothers me. A Lot.

group demanding to know about desktop/handheld computers). I went through
and details out the technology breakpoints and what happened at them
(guessing in some cases) and extrapolated the data out to various forms.
So... here\'s the rundown. (The format for TL is intro/wide-spread use). My
information is from Classic Trav&Book 8 Robots, MT Referee\'s companion.

Breakthrough                   Classic Trav   MegaTrav
non-volitale memory               8/9            9
optical storage mediums           8/8            8
massive parallel processing       7/8            8
voice recognition                 9/10           9
voice transcription               10/11          10
synaptic processing               10/12          11
25% synaptic processing           14
50% synaptic processing           16
  (AI breakthrough)
Personality Sims                  15             15
  (Psuedo-Reality)
Holocrystal Storage               12/13          13
Direct Neural implants            14/15          14

Side Technologies
Holovideo                         10             10
Handheld holorecorder                            13
artificial eyes                   11             11

Now the interesting bits: The neural implant computers are rated very
similiarly to the mainframe computers. They both stay similiar in size
from mod 7 to mod 9, then they start growing at mod 10 and peak out at
mod 13. This led me to believe that the TL12 7M neural implant computer
functioned the same as a TL7 Std computer.

Interestingly enough, the breakpoint on size peaked out at TL13 - where the
holocrystal memory has been listed as being a breakthrough in computing.

Another interesting bit is the mention of the TL15 Mod 10M neural computer
is the first model of neural implant computer capable of "hosting" the virus
- - making me suspect that it\'s compatriot the TL10 Mod 10 Std \'mainframe\'
computer (where they start growing \'bigger\') is actually introducing the
synaptic processing into the machine. This is essentially hardware that
re-writes itself (a step up from re-configuration) to match the needs of the
application. They also mention that earlier versions can still contain the
virus as "carriers". This leads me to the conclusion that TL9 & previous
computers are largely safe from the virus (just restart them).

Okay - so now I\'ve even more theories on virus which I won\'t mess with,
cause this isn\'t about the silicon worm... Here\'s the extrapolation (in TNE
form) for other sizes of computers (somewhere between the 1000kg and .1kg
versions listed).

         "Mainframe" comps                  Neural Implant Computers
 (listed in Brilliant Lances & FFS)              (listed in FFS)
Model#    TL   Vol(m^3)  Mass(tonnes)   Model#    TL   Vol(l)  Mass(kg)
   7       7       5        1             7M      12   *.1       1
   8       8       5        1             8M      13   *.1       1
   9       9       5        1             9M      14   *.1       1
   10      10      6        1.2          10M      15   *.12     1.2
   11      11      7        1.4    * the volumes weren\'t listed, so I guessed/
   12      12      8        1.6      extrapolated. I figured .1 liters was
   13      13      9        1.8      still to large to fit in a skull, so it
   14      14      8        1.6      had to be fused in component parts to the
   15      15      7        1.4      spine.

The TL11 hand comp is listed as being rated the same as a "Model 1". I had
to look back to MT to check it, but they spec\'d a model 1 as a TL5 computer.
Since we\'ve obviously progressed beyond that point - I equivilant\'d it to a
mod 7 flight computer.

So now... the new stuff:
 Desktop/Laptop computers                    These models function as the

       Handheld computers                    These models function as the

 16H      20    .24      .6     14,000

Some postulated breakthroughs:
TL8    2D virtual reality
TL9    Immersive VR (hardware)
TL13   3D VR
     (holography&gravitic manipulation to give tactile feedback)
TL15   Molecular memories
     (another x10+ increase in storage from holocrystal)

Hello again. I just spoke with Kevin Knight on the phone tonight
and he informed me that he has almost sold out of issue #1 of
The TravellerChronicle.

He asked me to post a message here to let everyone know that subscriptions
for TTC are no longer being taken retroactively back to issue #1. (However,
you may still suscribe retroactively to issue #2).

I was told that he only has about 25 copies of issue #1 left, and that he
is now selling them individually for $5.00 (US) each. If anyone is
interested in getting a copy before they are sold out, I would suggest you
act soon!

Issue #3 of The Traveller Chronicle will be going to the printers late
next week. Altho I don\'t have a complete table of contents before me, I
can say that the feature adventure for this issue is: "Bonnie Venture" and
is written by Mark "Geo" Gelinas. I have not seen a draft of it, but Kevin
tells me it is an excellent adventure set within the Regency in 1120 -  and
that the stats are presented in TNE format. Kevin says that it is a LARGE
adventure (30,000+ words), and will likely take up at least 1/4 of the issue.

Issue #3 will also contain two more subsectors for The Far Frontiers
sector, as well as the concluding segment of "Mercury Quest" (Traveller
fiction) by Gary Kalin....I think most people will be pleased with the
ending (nuff said).

I would also like to welcome a new artist whose work will appear in
issue #3. His name is Tim Osborne and he is from the U.K. - his work has
appeared in Signal-GK. (I thought his cover/deckplans for S-GK #7 were
outstanding! - Now if I can just talk him into sending a set of his
deckplans to me!).

Well, I suppose I\'ve said enough... :)  Happy travelling!

The Traveller Chronicle - News...

*** Issue #1 ***

I spoke to Kevin Knight on the phone last night and he informed me that he
has almost sold out of issue #1 of TTC. He says that there are only about
25 copies left, and that he is no longer selling them retoactively with
new subscriptions. (However, you may still suscribe starting with issue #2
if you want too.) Kevin asked me to post a message here letting people
know that he is now selling issue #1 of TTC individually for $5.00 (US)
each. If anyone is interested in getting a copy before they are sold out,
I\'d suggest you act soon.


*** Issue #3 ***

Feature Adventure:

TTC #3 will be going to the printers late next week. The feature adventure
this issue is "Bonnie Venture" and is written by none other than Mark
"Geo" Gelinas. I have not seen a draft of it, but Kevin tells me it is an
excellent adventure set within the Regency in 1120. All stats in the
adventure are in the TNE format. Kevin says it is a LARGE adventure
(30,000+ words), and will likely take up 1/4 of the issue.


Far Frontiers:

Issue #2 will also contain at least two more subsectors (three if there is
room) for The Far Frontiers sector.


Mercury Quest:

Issue #3 concludes "Mercury Quest" pt.3 - Traveller fiction written by
Gary Kalin. I won\'t give anything away, but I will say that I think most
people will be pleased with the way in which this story ends...(nuff said).

New Artist:

I would also like to take this chance to welcome aboard an artist from the
UK whose work will appear in this issue. His name is Tim Osborne, and you
might has seen his before in Signal-GK. (I thought his cover/deckplans for
S-GK #7 were outstanding! - Now if I can just talk him into submitting a

Not quite.  The Virus can still leave "eggs" using it\'s magic silicon
re-designing ability.  Even though a TL9 and earlier computer isn\'t really
capable of hosting the virus, it can serve as a source of infection, even if
the computer is turned off and restarted.

To clean out the computer, you have to dissassemble it and test the
individual components, replacing any of them that contain a virus "egg".
Then you reformat all the storage media and erase any non-volatile memory
arrays (like CMOS or Flash-EEPROM) before putting the thing back together.
Then, provided you have done a complete and thourough job, your computer
will work, and won\'t be a Virus carrier.

Computer Types: I\'d like to suggest some more characteristics of the
various types of computers you detail.  By the way, I\'m using a notation I
find convenient, and similar to the "look" of Classic Traveller computer
designations.  It\'s explained below:

Example:	Meaning
Mod/7		TL-7 Standard "Mainframe" Computer
Mod/7-Fib	TL-7 Fiber-Optic "Mainframe" Computer
Mod/7F		TL-7 Flight Computer
Mod/7F-Fib	TL-7 Fiber-Optic Flight Computer
Mod/7D		"Model 7" Desktop Computer (roughly equivalent of Mod/7)
Mod/7H		"Model 7" Hand Computer (roughly equivalent of Mod/7F)
Mod/7M		"Model 7" Micro Computer (cyber-implant, equivalent of Mod/7F)

> "Mainframe" Computers

These would be designed for use where volume isn\'t a problem, but the best
performance is definitely required.  The best contemporary equivalents would
be small supercomputers, or "super-minis" configured for use as servers in a
client-server environment.  The smaller flight computers can\'t perform jump
calculations, and are limited in the fuctions they can perform.

In Traveller, "Mainframe" computers get used as database servers, dealing
out library data, astrographic information, entertainment, technical
information and a wide range of other services to a large number of client
desktop, laptop, hand, and implant computers.  The other use is similar to
the way supercomputers are used today: to quickly solve problems (like jump
calculations) that are too large or complex to solve on smaller computers.

We can probably get a sense of scale and power for these things by noting
that the Mod/7 (the TL-7 "standard" computer) is probably the rought
equivalent of the biggest late-1970\'s mainframes or supercomputers.  The
server version is probably the equivalent of an IBM 3080-something, while
the supercomputer version likeley resembles something Seymour Cray designed
for other companies before he formed his own firm.  At TL-8 we have the
Mod/8, which I would guess as being roughly equivalent to either an IBM
3090-400, or one of larger Crays that became available towards the end of
the 80\'s, depending on whether you\'re talking about the data server or the
supercomputer version.

> Flight Computers

According to FF&S, these are limited computers, optimized in both hardware
and software to solve a particular set of problems.  One of these
applications is of course running a fly-by-wire (or fly-by-light, in the
case of fiber-optic flight computers) control system: reading attitude,
position, and velocity sensors combining this data with the pilot\'s control
inputs, and generating the right control surface outputs to both do the
pilot\'s bidding and keep the vehicle under control.

Flight computers can, of course, be designed for other functions.  Some
common ones would be handling a weapon or sensor system, or performing
diagnostics on all of the installed equipment.

The closest contemporary equivalents would be the various military standard
real-time computer systems used as flight computers, weapon guidance,
and controllers for various missile, sensor, and countermeasures systems
installed on modern combat vehicles.  One that (perhaps) more people would
be familliar with are the flight computers installed on the latest
jetliners, with their "glass cockpits" and sophisticated sensors.  All of
these contemporary equivalents would be roughly equivalent to Mod/7F or
Mod/8F computers.  Proposed new "fly-by-light" systems would be the rough
equivalents of Mod/8F-Fib

> Neural Implant Computers

Would these things really be the equivalent of "standard" mainframes?  The
application (direct interface with the human brain) is *very* different; I\'d
guess that the more closely resemble flight computers than the big server
and supercomputer machines.

The Neural Implants would be roughly similar to flight computers in that
most of the software you would use with one of these is pre-installed and
built-in, although with a good bit more storage space for all the
random data that people tend to collect and want available at a moment\'s
notice.  The implanted computers would also be similar to flight computers
because, like flight computers, they would have to respond to sensor and
control inputs in a "real-time" manner.  Unlike a flight computer, they
would have to have storage and application programs roughly similar to hand
computers, to store and retrieve data for the user.

> Desktop/Laptop Computers

I agree with you on this one: the desktops and laptops are going to be
approximately equivalent to mainframe computers of a tech level or two
earlier.  However, the desktop computers are going to be less optimized for
massive throughput or serving large numbers of clients, and instead designed
towards meeting the needs of a single user.  Therefore, a lot of it\'s
resources go towards the user interface and presentation of data.  Although
these computers would very possibly be installed on a starship, their design
makes them incapable of being readily adapted to flight control or jump
calculations applications (however, player characters in dire need could
always try some role-playing and a Formidable throw agains their applicable
computer asset).  As computers for one individual go, these machines are
very powerful, and relatively expensive.  Therefore, those that use them
need the extra computer power for their work: scientists, engineers, and the
like will use them extensively.

Since the first listed computer is at TL-9, it\'s hard to guess at a rough
equivalent, and besides, I have a suggestion: The computers you list seem to
be in the workstation and super-workstation class judging by price.  Cr
20,000 is more than most would be willing to pay to equip themselves with a
computer.  THere is now, and probably always will be, office and home
computers in the $3000 to $5000 price range, equipping the vast majority of
computer-equipped workers.  (see below for a "fix" to this problem).

> Hand Computers

We had a long discussion about that a while back.  It was my opinion that,
interpreted literally, MegaTraveller was trying to say that a "Model 1" was
the rough equivalent of an IBM 705 (which was a very powerful mainframe
computer for TL-5).  By today\'s standards, the 705 makes an average
programmable pocket calculator (but a little slow).

Again, I agree with your table, and am assuming that the hand computers are
the descendants of the currently-new class of "Personal Digital Assistants".
With better software, more storage, better communications, and other
improvements, these little machines will be indespensable companions for
many people in the Far Future.  Most of the software is pre-installed or
built-in, like other "flight computer" equivalents.  The main job of these
machines is like that projected for the PDAs: to keep the owner in contact
with the rest of the world, and to keep track of all the disparate pieces of
information that the user accumulates and wants instant access to.

I would suggest that the larger and more capable machines derived from the
hand computers (let\'s call them "Personal Computers") be considerably
cheaper.  As you say, they are roughly equivalent to a "standard" computer,
larger than the hand computers, but much smaller and more portable than the
desktop systems.  But note that at TL-11 such a machine would be the rough
equivalent of a Mod/7, while the Desktop computer is the equivalent of a
Mod/9, and only a tiny bit over twice the price.  Instead of multiplying the
price by 10, multiply by 3.  These "personal" comptuers are the general
access terminals and user interface machines that most people use to get to
their library data and other information stored on the larger mainframes.
Small and cheap, these computers are found literally everywhere at higher
tech levels.  Again, there\'s no contemporary equivalent, but think of these
things as the ultimate descendant of the home computers like the Commodore
64 and Amiga 600, combined with Interactive CD-ROM, and game machines like
the Atari, Nintendo, and Sega; all rolled into one.

Subject: RE: Computers


    Topic: TNE Computers

    I like the discussion on TNE Computers.

    When I was first learning computers we had a lecturer who was
    responsible for maintaining and programming the ANALOG terrain
    following computers on the Australian f-111 (later upgraded
    to digital).  These were complex boxes of cogs and switches into
    which the pilot would punch their location, destination, and other
    details and this box would fly the craft to the destination.

    Where do you see Analog computers in the hierarchy.

    Although we have given them up for silicon there may be places and
    cases where chemical, biological, analog, or nano-tech style computers
    are developed and advanced to the level of or beyond silicon based
    machines.  What would one of these silicon based life forms make of
    a computer built of nano-tech pieces each with it\'s own memory and
    acting like a synaps in a large computer brain AI.

    Far fetched?  About as far as THE VIRUS.



    Topic:  RE: Robots  (specificly to GDW designers)

    Please don\'t make the VIRUS an integral part of any computer/robotic
    creation rules for TNE.  There are some of us who don\'t live in the
    VIRUS universe and we would like to use the Robotic/Computer rules
    too.



    Topic:  RE: Submissions to Challenge.

    I don\'t see why they can\'t continue to take MegaT submissions.  It
    shouldn\'t matter that your not in the exactly defined TNE universe
    as GDW themselves are offering variations to their own rules AND
    although I haven\'t seen it yet are apparently defining technologies
    (ala reactionless drives) which DO NOT EXIST in the official TNE
    universe (well they used to).  They (GDW) appear to be trying to
    convert TNE into a generic high-tech role playing system (ala GURPS).

    I have no problem with a generic system, why should Challenge?

    So, anything goes?

     I think that you did an excellent job of breaking down the computer scene.
In regards to the Neural Implant Computers, these are new to TNE? I\'ve never
come across such dodads in MT. Either way, Very nice job! I\'ll have to digest
that further...

     No Probs! Yeah, I figured they\'d revamp computers in FF&S, but i didn\'t
realize that it would be as major a change as some of the stuff I saw in Joe\'s
post! Well, I guess if I had the rule books it\'d probably not be that much of
a stretch, but... I\'ll still give the Mega Thing a shot, but it looks bad at
the moment.


	 A general question to you all, am I horribly misguided in interpreting
a Model/1bis as a Basic Instruction Set Model 1 ?  Or does bis stand for
something cryptic that is not in my books... I\'m gonna feel really silly if
it doesn\'t mean what I think it means and I design rules around this...

     Would all programs be previously installed? Well, maybe in base models,
but it could be conceivable to install a small jack in the base of the skull
that we could fit program clips (You know, Microsofts in Gibson\'s books...)
into and download programs or information from or to them depending on whim.
Yes, I agree that there would have to be special software for the transfers
of information to and from the slots and to change currently running
application programs, but that\'s minor.

     The rest of your post sounds most reasonable.


	 To this point, most of my rules have been balled up and chucked. Since
I have perused the Robots book, I have found references to programs and CPU
and storage units. I have been trying to find a common base between the
Starship/Vehicle computers and the Robotic brain components. I mean, they are
made of roughly the same electronic technology per techlevel. Unfortunately,
other than knowing that a Jump Calculation, Antihijacking, Security, Gunnery
and other assorted things should run on these beasties, I have no Idea of the
space required for each and if such information was ever made public or not.
So, I have the choice of going into no man\'s land or giving up.

	 Does anyone have any information on ship computers and progams for said
comps? Would this be available in the Starship Operator\'s Manual? I\'m trying
to get a second hand copy of said publication.

	 Anyhow, I\'ve used up enough space!

James Kundert complained about a lack of enthusiasm for
TNE on the main Traveller Mailing List and that the TNE-Pocket
and FF&S review groups had gone off and done their work
seperately.  I\'d like to address what TNE-Pocket is doing,
for real, as opposed to random speculation 8-)

TNE-Pocket is for the most part not discussing TNE.
We did a surge of "how\'s it going to work" at the
beginning, before TNE was actually on the street,
and a second round of fixes when we got the game.
The TNE-Pocket list isn\'t there to discuss T:TNE.
We\'re making a very detailed small corner of the
TNE universe, not discussing issues as a whole.
Believe me, the ongoing arguments about pre-collapse
politics in the Aoeriyya region and how we\'re going
to get Metlay\'s Vargr over before the Virus hit
have nothing to do with the TNE game in general.

The traveller mailing list (this list here) is intended
for general discussion of Traveller the game, in all
its guises.  TNE-Pocket isn\'t about Traveller: The New Era.
It\'s about Aoerriya, one small corner of TNE which we were
lucky enough to be given to play with.

TNE-Pocket isn\'t trying to be closed either.  The archives
(which are about 6 weeks out of date, because I changed jobs
about that long ago...) are publically available at the
FTP site ocf.berkeley.edu directory pub/Traveller/TNE-Pocket
and anyone can download them.  They\'ll be updated next time
I have a weekend to spare.  The reason TNE-Pocket has a
"please don\'t join if you don\'t want to work" warning
on the front door is that we actually want to get something
done, not just sit and yak about it.  And we have.  We have
an outline, which may be revised depending on what the publication
arrangements end up being but seems otherwise pretty solid.
We have many thousands of words of first-draft (and some second
and third ...) manuscript for sections of the above.  We have
individuals penciled in for all the sections.  We\'re not very
busy right now because GDW has about a one-month response time,
and we\'re waiting on some info from them, but we\'ve been
making good progress on the whole.

That having been said, the list _is_ open, albeit with a slow
reaction time (mine) to add you.  There are two people who
are queued up and will be added real soon now (tm).  We\'re not
discussing state secrets, and if you will respect the "we\'re
here to make something" point of the list, go ahead and join.
Subscription requests to gwh@ocf.berkeley.edu, and like I
said I\'ll add you as soon as I have time.

But don\'t join TNE-Pocket to chat about TNE.  If you want to do that,
do it here.  TNE-Pocket doesn\'t need it, and the rest of the TML
people would miss out if general TNE discussion migrated.

I just wanted to wish everyone here a Happy Holiday (okay, this really
only applies to all the Classic and Mega people since the Third Imperium
doesn\'t exist in TNE).  Well, it\'s the thought that counts.

I also want to thank everyone whose posted information and ideas on
robot brains and computers.  Gee, I had no idea what a can of worms I
had opened.

Now, I just wanted to comment on something which j.kunder@genie.geis.com
had to say about this list, and Traveller:TNE in general.

: That said, I find the lack of apparent enthusiasm for TNE on this
:list distressing and annoying.  Distressing because of the "It\'s
:different. I don\'t like different" attitude which accompanies much
:of the discussion, and annoying because all the big-volume posters
:seem to have fled to the pocket-empire list (a list with "No Loitering,
:Private Property" posted at the door), and abandoned the main TML.
:It got worse when the folks who wanted to playtest the FF&S preview
:material went and formed _another_ list to follow that activity.
:The TML was left a shadow of its former self during this time.  The
:enthusiasm for these projects that could have infected the rest of
:the list was kept behind closed doors (and still is), and thus was
:wasted on those who needed no encouragement.

I may get burned bad for saying this, but I kinda like the TNE rules.
What I really like about them is the new ability to pick different
careers for each term, and the new skill and experience system.  What?!?
Well, I love the old Mega way, but TNE\'s character generation allows
players to make more unique/customized characters.  And the experience
system is fantastic, because players like to be rewarded, and with this
system, players can actually advance their skills after a little effort
and adventuring (remember what you had to do to raise a skill level in
Mega?).  And even though the new task resolution system doesn\'t have the
same feel as Mega\'s system, it\'s not too different (well other then
rolling with a d20, and a few other things), it still gives that
"on-the-fly" feeling that the old system had.  Don\'t get me wrong, I
love MegaTraveller, but the changes to the rules (as far as the
characters are involved) aren\'t too bad.  We\'ll get the the discussions
about the ship and combat rules some other time.

But now, I feel that I need to burn some bandwith on story line.  I
think the reason that so many people concentrate on pocket empires is
because they don\'t want the galaxy to be as drastically different as
what GDW has made it.  Think about it, the game centers around Star
Vikings and the Wilds.  My idea of Sci-Fi is not coming from some
backwater world, where we all look like cavemen.  And the RCES seems a
little too military oriented for any to really like.  But by
concentrating on these campaigns, GDW changed the focus of game.  Think
about it, what type of character\'s do we usually play?  And in what type
of world do we try to adventure and come from?  That\'s right, I bet that
there are a lot of TL15 Han Solo\'s out there on this list.  So, the only
way to play these characters now is to either create pocket empire that
kept a high TL, or come from the Regency.  But the Regency has one
problem.  You can\'t get in, and if you find a way to get out of it, you
can\'t get back into it without sacrificing your ship (perish the
thought).  So, pocket empires seem the only way to go.

If anyone has any other opinions on the subject, I would love to hear
them.  And for all the TNE players out there, what type of campaign are
you running and why?  And for all you Classic Traveller and
MegaTraveller people out there, have you seen TNE, and if so, why don\'t
you want to play it?

Thanks for listening to me babble...

Subject: Annoyed?

In responses to James Kundert\'s post where expresses annoyance,
let me say that I am also annoyed. I\'m *very* annoyed with
those who insist on ascribing my dislike for TNE to the fact
that "it\'s different". IMO, it\'s not just different, it\'s *worse*!
The background is especially worse altho the incompatibility
with either Trav or MT is bad too. I stuck with GDW thru the
MT fiasco in the forlorn hope that they would eventually step
in to straighten things out, but now all I can think of is the
old adage, "Be careful what you wish for, it might come true!".

	Forgive me for sounding a bit on the bewildered side, here, but
the common thread throughout the discussion here about the two games seems
to be that you have to take them all-or-nothing.  I just joined recently,
haven\'t played Traveller in a loooong time, and that was with three little
staple bound books.  I\'d picked up both MT and TNE to try to get up to
speed on what the game was like now.

	There are things that I like about both systems; why not combine
them?  Pick what you like from MT and add what you like from TNE?  From
what I\'ve seen on this list, most people have problems with the Virus and
subsequent crash of the Empire(s), and therefore chuck TNE. IMHO, the
characters generated with the TNE system are far and away superior to
those generated with MT; the biggest problem I\'ve ever had with Traveller
is that the characters all tend to be rather two dimensional; you\'re a
scout, a marine, a soldier, or navy, sometimes a merchant.  The characters
of TNE place you into a far richer universe of real people.

	OTOH, the universe as laid out in TNE is absurd...if the Virus
moved as fast as communication, NO ONE could have possibly escaped the
effects, everyone is blown back to the stone age, the end.  I\'d much
prefer a TNE Character in a MT universe...so that\'s what my campaign is
going to be. You want to be Han Solo, go ahead, have at.  Just because GDW
sayeth, doesn\'t mean I have to followeth.  Or maybe I\'ve been dealing with
TSR for far too long :-) I tend to take any \'official\' product with a
grain of salt.

	Oh, and don\'t worry, my universe will have Virus...where do you
think the Borg come from? ;->

First, I want to thank everybody for helping me out on that
allegiance code question. I guess I must have slept through the
5th frontier war or something.

Anyway, I\'m continuing to mull over the sunbane data on the
spinward marches despite my limited knowledge concerning the
region\'s recent history, and (at the risk of getting into a
really long discussion) I have to admit that I keep thinking the
same thing over and over: "There\'s something wrong here." What
I\'m talking about is UWP\'s (formerly UPP\'s) which don\'t make a

Here we have a couple million folks making a living with their
19th century technology, and look what they have to breathe: a
very thin (and tainted) atmosphere. For all intents and purposes,
a vacuum. I know... I know... they can get by with combination
respirators/filtermasks, right? All couple million of them? With
technology which is over a century old? I can just see it now.
"Don\'t go outside, son. Yer might have to breathe or somethin\'."
Hey, at least TAS had the sense to classify it as a red zone
(don\'t go there if you\'re addicted to oxygen).

Okay, all kidding aside, the thing that gets me about planets
like this is that anybody decided to colonize them in the first
place. Agreed, with a bit of technology, people can survive just
about anywhere they want to survive, but why bother? I see a nice
dirtball only five parsecs trailing.

Now this is sweet. We\'re talking primo-atmosphere (none of that
chewable Los Angeles gunk). And lo and behold, who shows up to
catch the view? A whopping seventy people. We have more folks on
the TML than this. Yes... I know... the planet is corporate
owned, but who really cares? Why waste a virtual paradise (at
least compared to that other place) on seventy stinking corporate
losers (or maybe corporate winners in this case). Ah, yes... I
can see some cool scenarios... the corporate paradise. The wooing
ground for potential investors. Perhaps it\'s just one big golf
course. You tee-off from orbit.

But the fact is, this would never happen. When the place gets
colonized way back when, people are gonna zoom in on this little
speck of rock like nothing you\'ve ever seen, and any corporation
that wants it is gonna have to pay through the nose (and a few
other choice orifices) to get it.

My point: this situation shouldn\'t happen. It goes not only
against intuition and common sense, it goes against the principle
of greed, the fundamental root of human nature (yes, I\'m down on
humanity, but that\'s not the point here). The point is that this
rule system is... flawed, no other way to put it. (I can see
several people shaking their heads and saying "you mean you just
figured this out?") Hey, I\'ve always been a big believer in
classic traveller, and the spinward marches are about as classic
as you can get. But the point stands, there\'s something rotten in
the Lanth subsector, and it mostly likely extends from the whole
set of rules on UWP generation.

Let\'s take a closer look. What\'s going on in the rules to produce
these sort of unwelcome results? I think one of the problems is
real obvious. Just take a look at the order in which UWP stats
are being generated.

1. Starport       5. Population
2. World Size     6. Government
3. Atmosphere     7. Law Level
4. Hydrographics  8. Technology

The first thing wrong with this is actually the very first thing
we see. Why are we generating the starport first? Shouldn\'t starport
be determined by traffic, and shouldn\'t traffic be determined by
population? Hence, let\'s move starport after population (not in
the UWP listing, but in the order of stat generation).

Now (making this one change) let\'s start looking at cause and
effect in the rules.

The Stat        What modifies it
/----\\        /----\\
1. Size         (nil)
2. Atmosphere   (Size)
3. Hydro        (Size, Atmosphere)
4. Population   (nil)
5. Starport     (nil)
6. Government   (nil)
7. Law Level    (nil)
8. Technology   (everything but law level)

Now this is cute. Again, I always was a big believer in the
classic rules (maybe because I wanted to crawl in a hole when MT
came out), but let\'s take a look here. Specifically, let\'s look
at population. The rules would have us believe that you take any
given system, and regardless of its features, the primary world
or asteroid belt in one system is just as likely to have X amount
of people as the primary world or asteroid belt in the other
system. This, my friends, is way way out of line.

Think about it. You roll up some dinky little ice-ball as the
main world in your star system and then you try telling me that
the fact that this tiny speck of crud has no atmosphere, that it
has no liquid water, and that it hasn\'t even a modicum (I like
the word) of elbow room.... and then you try telling me it\'s just
as likely to have 50 billion people on board as that garden
terra-prime paradise just a couple of parsecs down the road. I
don\'t think so. Yes... you can explain it away. You can say, "Oh,
there\'s this wonderful lanthanum mine." Or you can say. "These
people live here... because it\'s their home" (and then smile
convincingly). But it doesn\'t work. This isn\'t a little
inconsistency. This is whopping big one. It\'s gigantic. It\'s
glaring. It\'s pesky and annoying (like me), but most of all, it\'s
just plain stupid.

Time for Jim\'s 1st Law on main-world generation (hey, if Newton
can do it, why not me?): Given that everything else is more or
less equal, people will tend to migrate to the place that is
"nicer". What I\'m saying is that worlds with a nice atmosphere,
some actual water, and so forth are gonna attract large
populations which will in turn build nice jumbo starports.
Planets that aren\'t so nice (you know the ones I\'m talking
about)... those planets will not attract people, and hence, they
aren\'t very likely to have lots of traffic or nice starports.
Jim\'s 2nd Law is likewise easy to grasp: People will attain the
resources (technology) that they need to survive such that those
resources are available. I.e., if you\'re really sure that you\'re
going to live on Sonthert, then you\'re gonna work damn hard to
acquire the technology you need to survive. TL3 doesn\'t cut it on
a near-vacuum planet. You need a little bit more (And I\'ve never
bought into the philosophy of high and low tech worlds living
side by side. For a short duration such as a few decades, I can
see it. Given special poltical or social circumstances, I can see
it. But in general, over the course of centuries, eventually
there will either be a leveling process or the low TL regions
will be brought up to snuff... and this is exactly what\'s
happening on our world).

Okay... now since I try not bitch about something unless I\'m
willing to work to fix it, here\'s my proposed modified-rules on
main world generation (if this begins to look like pseudo-code,
it\'s probably because it is).

1. World Size. Roll 2d6-2.

2. Atmosphere. Roll 2d6-7+Size.
   if size=0 then atmosphere=0.
   confine range to 0-F.

3. Hydrographics. Roll 2d6-7+Size.
   if atmosphere is 1 or less, then DM -4
   if size is 1 or less, then Hydro=0
   if atmosphere is A-C then DM -4
   if atmosphere is E then DM -2
   confine range to 0-A

4. Population. Roll 2d6-2.
   if size is 2 or less, DM -1
   if atmosphere is 3 or less, DM -3
   if atmosphere is A, DM -2
   if atmosphere is B, DM -3
   if atmosphere is C, DM -4
   if atmosphere if greater than C, DM -2
   if atmosphere is 6, DM +3
   if atmosphere is 5 or 8, DM +1
   if hydro=0 and atmos>3, DM -2
   confine range to 0-A

5. Starport. Roll 2d6 (use whichever table suits the locality
                       but remember that high rolls result in
                       a lower quality starport).
   if pop=0 then starport=X
   if pop=1, DM +2
   if pop=2, DM +1
   if pop is 6-9, then DM -1
   if pop is A, then DM -2
   confine range to A-X

6. Government. Roll 2d6-7+population.
   if pop=0 then gov=0
   confine range to 0-F

7. Law Level. Roll 2d6-7+government.
   if gov=0 then law=0
   confine lower bound of range to 0

8. Tech Level. Roll d6. Modify as per the standard chart.
   if pop=0 then tech=0
   otherwise, if hydro is 0 or A and pop is at least 6,
                 then tech must at least be 4.
              if atmos is 4, 7 or 9,
                 then tech must at least be 5.
              if atmos is 3 or less or A-C,
                 then tech must at least be 7.
              if atmos is D or E and hydro is A,
                 then tech must at least be 7.
   confine lower bound of range to 0

There, that wasn\'t so bad. I think you folks (at least those who
are interested) should be able to make sense of all of this. I\'m
throwing down some example UWP\'s to show you what sort of worlds
this modified system tends to create.

X9A8000-0    X120000-0    B457867-6    B2518CD-B    A631453-F

Note that there are some conspicuous differences between this
data and "normal" UWP listings. We get quite a few uninhabited or
very low-population star systems under the modified rules. Not so
under the original rules. I haven\'t checked yet, but I suspect
that this will probably bring down the average starport rating
for any given region (which is fine with me). Further, we don\'t
see lots of low-tech star systems. The lowest I see here is TL4,
and in both cases, we\'ve got a breathable atmosphere attached to
each planet (no assistance required, hence no technology required
in order to breathe). As we\'d expect, the yucky-foo worlds tend
to have lower populations and seedier starports. I\'m a bit
surprised that we have quite a few lush (atmos=6) worlds with
under ten million inhabitants. On other runs, I usually see very
high populations clustered on those worlds. Of course, when we
look at the highest population world in this run, we see that it
has a standard atmosphere, just as we\'d expect, so all in all,
it\'s not giving us really strange results on that count.

Now what I\'d like to do with this modified rule-set is get some
comments and criticism from you folks. Even though the TML
comprises a *very* small corner of the internet, it also has some
of the most devoted Traveller players I\'ve ever laid electronic
eyes on. So tell me... what do you think about the modified
rules? What problems do you see? What needs fixing?

I\'d like to "perfect" the program before distributing it, but if
you\'d like a copy for "experimental purposes", I can email the
QB45 source and/or the MS-DOS executable. What I\'m really looking
for here are suggestions. Do you like the modified system? Do ya
hate it? What about it needs improving? Probably a lot! From
reading this mailing-list in the past, I know that there is
*never* going to be a consensus on the TML regarding something
this broad-based and as fundamental to the rules of Traveller.
That\'s okay with me. I\'m not trying to please everyone (or even
the majority). I\'m just trying to get some ideas and a fair
critique (and what better place than the TML?).

Thanks for tuning in. Now back to the regularly scheduled
program.
