	Hmmm, tranqs, huh ?
	Well, lets look at a couple of ways they\'ve been used in fiction
	and real-life in recent history ...
	
	First of all we have the wide-area gas effects. Mainly inhaled,
	usually pretty dangerous, these are quite effective. The aim of
	most of these is to tranquilise in the broadest sense of the
	word - to render ineffective. Tear gas, light doses of war gases,
	anything that produces a disabling affect on the targets. If there
	are any serious side-effects, well, too bad. (The Stumm gas used
	by the Mega-City Judges has a 1 in a thousand death rate - perfectly
	acceptable for crowd control where you can be sure that they *all*
	have broken the law ... however, just a little *too* dangerous
	for even the Judges to use routinely :-)
	
	Next we want to look at the tranqs that are a little more selective
	in their targeting ...
	So, we have small gas grenades, that, when delivered *accurately*,
	only affect a few targets ... but they are affected grately by
	environmental effects (like a strong wind ...) And of course,
	the basic gas type is still the same as the ones above.
	Next up are the skin-absorbed chemicals (and if you\'ve ever
	played paintball, you\'ll know just how easy it is for the stuff
	to pass through many layers of clothes) - but still the same
	arguments apply as to side-effects etc.
	
	So, we have to be very selective to ensure that the materiel gets
	delivered - and you see the sort of dart guns that African big-game
	hunters seem keen on sticking into rhinos ... these darts deliver
	a very large dose as quickly as possible, so if the dart gets
	brushed off by a charging rhino, it will still eventually fall over.
	Unfortunately, these darts can have a lot of side-effects related
	to the fact that they are very physical - get hit in the eye by
	one of those and you won\'t notice the tranq chemicals - you\'ll
	be dead. Also, they are very susceptible to simply not penetrating
	a tough outer layer if they hit at an angle - a common complaint
	with many missile weapons (but not nukes ... :-)
	
	Some very nice high-tech solutions to these common problems have
	been put forward - I draw mainly on Larry Niven\'s works here, for
	describing what amounts to TL8 and above.
	First of all we have needle-thin slivers of frozen/soluble tranq
	chemicals (which, is not made clear) fired at high speeds with
	powerful Gauss guns (the chemicals are assumed to have a high
	enough iron content to need no other delivery agent) that break
	the skin easily (being so small) and then dissolve directly into
	the blood stream. The slivers are so small that any that hit
	sensitive areas (such as the eyes) will cause minimal damage,
	and any that encounter normal clothing will be able to easily
	penetrate the weave of the material. The chemical itself must
	be similar to the non-overdosing ones mentioned by Metlay, as
	the basic idea is to pump your target full of them until you\'re
	sure you\'ve hit him ...
	
	Then we have the non-chemical methods - ultra-sound stunners
	being the best method. I\'m sure you\'ve all noticed how sound
	vibration can have strange effects on the body - the basic
	function of the stunners is to make the central nervous system
	shut down into unconciousness. There are no chemical side-effects,
	and by quickly running up and down the frequency ranges that are
	effective on different species and races, a universal humane
	weapon can be quickly developed.
	
	Finally, we have what an intelligent victim will realise to be
	the most dangerous weapon of all ... the tasp, which directly
	stimulates the brain\'s pleasure centre by induction (OK, I know
	that induction isn\'t a direct method, but I mean that you\'re
	bypassing the normal routes to the pleasure centre). While the
	stimulation is going on, the victim is completely incapable of
	anything, and is experiencing the most *pleasurable* sensations
	possible. This can quickly lead to addiction to the source of
	stimulation, and only the most intelligent victim could correctly
	understand the threat of addiction, and what that would mean to
	his life. For more information on that, you are advised to read
	the stories that Niven has written dealing with Direct Current
	Stimulation Addiction (The Ringworld Engineers being the best).
	
	And as a final note, which methods are suitable to combat when
	enclosed in sealed suits (in space, hostile environments etc) ?
	Well, the stunners fail in space, and be less effective in thin
	atmospheres as they rely on transmission of vibrations, and the
	tasp could easily fail is the victim\'s suit acted as a Faraday
	Cage, keeping out all electro-magnetic radiations ... The sliver
	guns couldn\'t penetrate even light armour ...
	Are we left to consider psionic attack as the only non-lethal
	tranq effective left ?

	Anyway, I hope that this missive has introduced a few more ideas
	into the discussion of tranqs and non-lethal weapons ...
	Comments please !

Hi guys, I need help with a game design problem.

In my game world, spacecraft carry missiles (among other cheerful devices).
I am trying to figure out what kind of damage missiles would really do to
a spacecraft.  Here is a sample scenario...

A battleship, in my game world, masses 60,000 tons (= about 600,000 cubic
meters with my ship design system).  Its armor reduces the problems caused
by particle beams (those nasty neutrons!) and makes lasers a laughing 
matter, but there is only so much armor you can put on a spacecraft.  As
a result, missiles are still a problem.

Missiles are smart oversized bullets.  In my game world, they mass roughly
one metric ton (they look a lot like the shells from a 406 mm. howitizer).
They accelerate at 20 gees (= about 200 meters per second per second).  They
can be fired from a LONG way off.  Since they can boost the whole way, they
generally hit their targets moving at anywhere from 10 km./sec. to 100 km./
sec. (usually in the 50 km./sec. to 70 km./sec range).  In some cases, they
can be moving faster (if they are fired at VERY long range, which would 
give them perhaps 20 to 30 minutes to boost).  Oh, by the way, the warhead
(about 100 kg. of high explosives) can be used either on impact or as 
a proximity bomb that turns the missile from one big bullet into about
one thousand smaller bullets slowly spreading the radius of death.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to figure out what kind
of damage a single missile would do to a battleship (feel free to add
comments on what it would do to larger or smaller ships, please, I am
glad to get all the help I can).  Are we talking about severe damage but
some ship systems still working?  A disabled ship that must be towed or
abandoned but could still be repaired?  A shattered, lifeless hulk slowly
drifting off into the void?  

Thanks in advance for comments, suggestions, etc.

This has shown up in several science fiction stories (those by Lois McMaster
Bujold, for example) wrt sonic weapons. The official response is "Shoot
first, ask questions later" because you really can do this. In a confusing
combat scenario, you knock everyone unconscious, and then sort things out
when they wake up.

Unfortunately :-), we often encounter this in our 2300 campaigns. When
Security spots you, they don\'t point a gun at you and say \'FREEZE!\'; They
just shoot.  Makes it very important to post your own guards when breaking
into secure buildings...

Mark, at 50 to 70 km/sec a 100 kg warhead won\'t even be *noticed*.  The
kinetic energy of the impact of a 1 ton missile at those velocities is
equivalent to a *small* nuclear warhead. 

Ever see a picture of the Barringer Meteor Crater in Arizona? Your
missiles could make a crater like that. It was made by a body that
probably massed 100 times as much, but it was only traveling about
10 km/sec. So your missile would have the same energy if it was
going only *10* times as fast (E= m*v^2/2)

The kinetic energy of the missile is equal to converting 1/36 of a gram
of matter to energy. (assuming a 1 metric ton missile at 70 km/sec).
And if the missile is attacking from the front, the energy depends not
on the square of the missile\'s velocity, but on the square of the 
*sum* of the velocities!)

To put it simply, you *can\'t* armor against kinetic energy weapons.
Not when the velocities are tens to *hundreds* of km/sec.

To get an idea of just how much energy is in one of your
high velocity missiles, I did a quick back of the envelope
calculation.

Assuming only the warhead is left (and it won\'t matter much
if it\'s explosive or just dead weight), at 50 km/s to 70 km/s
you get 125 GigaJoules and 245 GigaJoules respectively.

How much is that?  Take the Love Boat (or any other smallish-
medium ocean liner) and drop it (on Earth of course) from a
height of about half a kilometer.  That should be about right.

And imagine all that energy in the space of a 100 kg mass.

$29.95 for Apple II and Commodore versions.

The "Second Survey Data" (as they call it) is priced identically to the

the book, the Mac versions use HyperCard.  SSD is also said to contain
UWP data for *37* (WOW!) sectors in and near the Imperium.  "The World

your heart\'s content," according to DGP.

They (DGP) say this stuff is available in January 1990, so you should be
able to order now.

The suggested weekend, Labor Day, is the date for the annual World
Science Fiction Convention.  Last fall, it was here in Boston. We had
about 20 people attend a party for contributors/subscribers to several
of the role-playing game fanzines (hard-copy digested mailing lists)
there.  We get usually over a dozen for the RGP Fanzine party at
the Boskone annual regional SF con.  This tends to happen at other SF
and gaming cons. 

So... if you want to meet other TML subscribers:
(1) Check Analog\'s calendar and go to any local SF cons in your area,
and anywhere else you\'d like to visit.
(2) Tell the TML where you going, so others going their can look for
you, and you can pick whose hotel room to have the party in.  (And also
arrange to share hotel rooms/driving etc.)

WorldCon 91 is in Orlando.  \'92 is probably off-shore (I forget); 
San Francisco and somewhere inthe south-west are in the running for \'93.  
All Labor Day.  
    I won\'t be at Orlando; if SFinSF wins, I want to take my wife to see 
the Golden Gate in \'93.  Remind me closer to event & I\'ll get you the name
of the RPG APA party organizer.

Boskone is always (almost) Presidents Day Weekend (Feburary), currently 
at the Springfield MA Tara&Downtown Marriot. (Convenient to Hartford & Boston,
at I-90 & I-91). Feb 15-17, \'91. I\'ll be there, and TMLers would be welcome
at the APA (fanzine) party.
     The other boston convention, Arisia, is two weeks before, 
Feb. 1-2, in the Cambridge Sonesta in \'91.  (\'90 was their first, a rave 
success.) I haven\'t done any partying there, but I\'m sure it could happen.
I\'ll probably be there too.

(and just came up in Sunday\'s topics) is programs for generating
worlds, systems, etc.  I\'d like to know if anything has come of
those efforts I\'m reading about back in 1987.  What software
is available commercially?  What software have you guys written?
Would it be legal to post such programs on this list?

I was planning on writing something up this summer, but if
someone\'s already done it...

Has anyone thought of saving those isocahedral planetary maps
as graphics files on computer?  I think it\'d be awfully neat
to flip through them as if you were really flipping through
Imperial survey data on your ship\'s computer :-)  Or how about
a program that takes a planet\'s UPP, orbit, star type, albedo,
axis tilt and generates a map, weather patterns, ocean currents...

Come to think of it, has GDW ever published planetary maps of
some major worlds (like Regina) for general use, not as part
of an adventure?

I\'ve got a million more questions but since most of them are
bound to answer themselves as I read on, I\'ll let them simmer
for now.  (Is Striker still around?  Are there deckplans for any
of those starships you guys posted?  Has anyone written a program

    'body' => 'I just fired up my Mega-Traveller campaign last Friday night and really got
the players moving.  However, as a result of a narrowly-avoided firefight,
one of my more experienced players voiced a loud objection to the numbers
given by GDW for weapon penetration in the Players manual.  When the player
in question discovered that the Gauss Rifles (TL 13) aboard their starship
couldn\'t penetrate Battle Dress or Combat Armor from the same tech. level,
he pointed out that this would be like sending soldiers into battle with
flak jackets, and arming them with weapons that couldn\'t kill an enemy
wearing the SAME flak jackets.

He has a point.

I would like to think that GDW gave more than just passing thought to the
numbers they picked for armor values and penetration values for the armor
and weapons used in MT.  I have consolidated the relevant information into
the 2 tables shown below (taken from Players\' Manual, pp. 74,76, and the
Imperial Encyclopedia, pp. 75):

Armor              TL   Armor Value
- ----   --   ----
Combat Env. Suit   10        6
Combat Armor-11    11        8
Combat Armor-12    12       10
Combat Armor-14    14       18
Battle Dress-13    13       10
Battle Dress-14    14       18

Weapon                    TL    Pen. Value*
- ----                    --    ----
ACR 7mm                   10        4
ACR 9mm                   10        6
ARL 10mm----10       10
Gauss Rifle 4mm           12        7
Gauss Pistol 4mm          13        4
Laser Pistol-13----13        6
Laser Carbine-13          13       12
Laser Rifle-13            13       20
Integral Laser Pistol-14--14        6**

NOTES:
    *  - In most cases, these weapons have a variety of penetration values,
         base on their ammo type.  The number shown is the highest penetration
         available.
    ** - This penetration value is assumed to be the same a that of the
         Laser Pistol-13, since none is given in the Player Manual.

Plasma and Fusion weapons are deliberately being ignored as no sane referee
would let his players romp around with those things in tow during the majority
of a typical campaign. (My apologies to those Refs. among you who do, in fact,
allow this.  Please don\'t shoot me :-).)

Given these numbers, and the description of \'Zero Penetration\' on pg. 70 of
the Players\' Manual, the Combat Environment Suit, Combat Armor-11, Combat
Armor-12, and Battle Dress-13 can only be penetrated by the ARL, the Laser
Carbine and the Laser Rifle.  Further, the Combat Armor-14 and Battle Dress-14
can only be penetrated by the Laser Rifle!  Now, all of this is mitigated by
the fact that you can penetrate these types of armor if you achieve exceptional
success on your attack round, but that doesn\'t seem like something you should
be relying on.  The gauss rifle in particular has been significantly watered
down from it\'s original descriptions in Classic Traveller (Mercenary) and
Azhanti High Lightning.  Does this mean that gauss rifles are passe as battle-
field weapons?

Since the 4mm Gauss Rifle and Combat Armor-12 both evolved at the same Tech.
level (TL 12), and since the Gauss Rifle was obviously intended to be a
combat weapon, you would think it would be designed to routinely penetrate
the standard personal body armor of the period.  This strikes me as a
major oversight in the combat mechanics.

This brings us to the next topic: AUTOMATIC WEAPON FIRE.  Page 73 of the
Players\' Manual describes auto-weapon fire as delivering 5 rounds per
trigger pull instead of 1.  While this may be used to hit multiple targets
adjacent to the primary target, the rules neglect some important points.

First, some weapons (i.e. Gauss Rifle and Pistol) have specific auto-fire
numbers given in the Imperial Encyclopedia (4 for the pistol, 4 or 10 for
the rifle).  Should these be used instead of the standard 5 listed in the
Players\' Manual.

Second, if multiple targets are available, and you hit the primary target,
are the adjacent targets hit automatically or must you reroll for each?

Third, if you are in auto-fire mode and there is only a single target,
is he hit by all the auto-fire rounds?  If not, how many hit?  Do you
roll a separate attack for each round?  Are there any die modifiers
(positive or negative) for successive rounds?

None of these things are covered in the combat rules and they seem to
represent a major oversight, considering how many of the weapons have
auto-fire capability.

My initial reaction to these omissions is as follows:

First, have 2 different versions of the Gauss Rifle, a TL-11 and a TL-12.
The TL-11 version has a PV of 8, and the TL-12 version has a PV of 10.
All other stats. remain unchanged.

Regarding auto-fire: if a weapon has a specified fire rate, use it.
Otherwise, use the 5/rnd. rule.  Also, roll a separate attack for each
round, but if the first round hits, add +4 to the subsequent rolls to
reflect that the initial aimpoint was \'on target\'.  Apply this bonus
only to Low Recoil weapons.  Medium Recoil weapons are not as controllable.

How do you deal with this sort of thing?

Later,

I was thinking about the relative merits of gas giant refueling yesterday,
relative to dipping from a world\'s ocean.  Now, as I understand it, in
"real" life a gas giant, say, Jupiter, has a region of intense radiation
around it.  Now what I want to know is how this affects refueling operations
around a gas giant.  Can a starship with a hull armor factor of 40 withstand
this radiation long enough to skim enough fuel, or is it and its crew going
to get fried real quick?  Can some of the physics or astronomy types help
out? 

 I was maybe thinking that the size of the gas giant might be a factor.  For
example, Jupiter would be classified as a large GG, by _Scouts_ or _World
Builder\'s_.  If the ship could not withstand the radiation around a large
GG, how about around a small GG, say the size of Neptune?  It could have
interesting ramifications to those who would avoid the cost of refined fuel.

"Oh, you can\'t skim fuel from the gas giant, because the radiation is too
intense, but there\'s a world with an acceptable hydrosphere."

"But there\'s an enemy fleet stationed there!"

Well, turn 4.0 is finally here.  Looks like a two-week
turn schedule is about what I can actually accomplish.
Sorry about not being able to do more - but sh** happens.

As I was preparing this turn initially (way back when..)
I had to make an extended driving trip to Eastern Oregon
for family stuff.  Lost an automobile engine 40 miles 
from the nearest town.  Took four days to return to
civilization.

This last week, agora went off-line for three days while
the sysop put in a newer, faster, bigger disk (it\'s about
time).  Simultaneously, the cost-cutters at work went 
after the uucp phone budget and axed my mailing anything 
from oresoft.

*Huge* backlog at agora.  (Anything to mailed to oresoft
I bounced to agora - so it might take a little longer
before you hear from me.)

The result of this is that it seems *something* is going
to make sure we don\'t any more than one turn every two 
weeks or so.  I\'ll keep trying to work one week intervals,
and we\'ll see if it gets any better.

Mmmm.  My SO (aka Rachael Turnskaad in another campaign) :)
just brought me some hot brownies to keep me awake until I\'m
done with this tonight.

=================================
Relevant stuff below:

Go ahead and send in your department descriptions.  I\'ll include
them as they arrive.

If your character is psi, trained or just sensitive, and is willing
to communicate (or overhear) telepathically or telempathically, 
send me a note, and I\'ll make up a psi group for our alias files.

I tried to draw the Alcyon.  It wound up looking more like some kind
of fire demon.  Any volunteers?

That\'s all for this week.  For the time being, people who don\'t send 
participate in character interaction are assumed to be "working" and
are not socializing.  That is, you didn\'t get left behind.

You settle into the routine of shipboard life.  As with the rest of
your crewmates, you set about the tasks needed to finally get the
Alcyon into jump space.  

The chemical strap on boosters have long since jettisoned
themselves, letting you drift silently away from the asteroids, and
your last bit of civilization for at lest the next week.

There is a brief hiatus in the preparations, as engnieers scramble
to get the rider ships hooked up and tested before you jump.

- ----
Bhyarrvouf is excited as a teenager on his first date as he readies 
the drives for the leap into hyperspace... perhaps TOO excited. He seems 
jumpy and snappish at times, almost fearful at others, as if he were 
expecting something bad to happen and was trying to put the thought of 
it out of his mind....


"Engineering, Johann here. We\'ll have to patch the computers of the 
riders and the computer of the Alcyon together before we jump, Well 
actually we can\'t jump if the links arn\'t in place! I\'ll need someone 
with good engineering skill"

"Any takers?"


So Zben, and Aaron head out and make the physical links to the riders,
while you are all in free-fall.

Meanwhile, Nishu completes the nav routines, and runs through all the
calculations a second time (since he\'s also waiting on those engineers)
to verify the jump.

Although preprogammed, Nishu knows enough nav to figure out that this
particular jump is supposed to dump you guys out in empty space, 5
parsecs away.  

Command and Transport aren\'t talking (at least openly) about what this 
means or what they expect.


- ----
After about five hours, engineering and transport give the go-ahead signal.

No matter how many times you make that tumble, it always comes as a
bit of a surprise.  You *know* viscerally that more than one person
here has lost lunch, not just from the tumble, but also from the 
excitement.  [everyone roll 2D6, to keep your lunch:
              endur or better,  DM + years in space, 
                                   - months since last jump
              if you fail, you got space sick.  The difference between
              what you got and what you need is number of minutes
              you are ill.  The bigger the difference, the more 
              violently ill you are.  Critical failure (unmodified 2)
              and you are out of it for now -- a trip to/from a
              medic is in order.]


So now, having a little time to wander about the ship, here\'s what 
she looks like on the inside:  [I\'ll take submissions for your part, too
if you want to do this - this is from a Transport team member]

The bridge of the Alcyon is on the large side of cramped, about 10 meters
long and 8 meters wide, tapering towards the front to 5 meters wide.  Lighting
is dim white (to aid night vision), with red as an option.  A set of view
ports at the front allows vision outside.  The deck is ridged for traction,
and the walls are mostly simple white panels about a meter on a side.

At the head of the bridge are the pilot (left) and co-pilot (right) stations.
In addition to the long dashboard-type console, each station has a control
stick mounted next to their acceleration chair and a pair of footpedals on
the floor beneath the console.  Both stations are holodynamic, with HUD data
projected over the viewports.  The co-pilot\'s controls are usually slaved to  
the pilot\'s; even when both are active, pilot input will override copilot.  

Behind the flight controls, in the center of the bridge, is the command
chair.  The conn includes a small computer terminal on a swing-up arm.  Through
this terminal the commander has access to all command functions, including 
library data and security systems.  Unlike the other bridge chairs, which can
swivel over an arc of about 90 degrees, the conn can turn a full 360 --
allowing the commander to view any station, including the holodisplay.

The holodisplay, directly behind the conn, consists physically of a pair of
projection rings a meter across, mounted on the floor and ceiling.  The
projection area is a cylinder about two meters in diameter.  The holodisplay
can be used to show sensor readings, navigational data, computer displays,
or communications. 

Facing each other through the holodisplay are the navigation (left) and
sensor/comm (right) stations.  Each station has an acceleration chair facing
a console slightly more than a meter long, which is holodynamic.  Both stations 
use the holodisplay for readout, and may "split" it into two different images.

At the back of the bridge is a small assembly/observation area, about two
meters long and eight meters wide, as mentioned.  On the back wall, next to the
iris valve, is a computer station (right, or left facing the exit).  This
station is not usually manned, and is used for readouts on ship\'s systems and
computer queries.
- ----

All of the scientists, both social and physical types, can be found poring
over data, running to another terminal, and just genrally being busy 
creating models, projections, and helping out everyon else.

- ----

A short time after the Alcyon makes its way into jump space and all the
pressing engineering tasks are complete, Christian tracks down \'Vouf --
wherever he\'s hiding himself. :-) "It doesn\'t take much to realize that
you\'ve been avoiding a medical exam", says Dr. Van Der Merwe with a wry
smile on his face. "As an IISS flight surgeon, I\'m quite proficient in
xenomedical areas, and I happened to review the latest in Vargr medical
journals before we left, so you can rest assured there. Since you have
some free time now, let\'s go and get the exam over with, shall we?"

Bhyarrvouf, whom everyone\'s used to seeing as ebullient and forceful,
starts to tremble at the sight of Dr. van der Merwe. His ears fold back 
flat and his tail curves so far forward between his legs that it almost 
touches Dr. van der Merwe\'s leg. "Um, I really have some other stuff to 
do, Doc. I was so busy doing Engineering stuff I never got around to 
looking at the holotapes they made for the Generalists and since I\'m off 
shift this would be a great  time I\'m REALLY sorry maybe we can 
reschedule it for later this week I\'m just really run off my tail what 
with one thingananother..."

He\'s backing away as he says this....then backs into a wall. He jumps a meter
in the air at the touch of the cold metal, yelping fearfully, then seems to 
wilt. "All right, Doc," he mutters. "Let\'s get this over with. Which way to 
Sickbay?"

While viewing Bhyarrvouf\'s unusual reaction, Dr. Van Der Merwe simply stands
in the corridor. He lifts his right eyebrow in a mixture of amusement and
concern at this uncharacteristic display by \'Vouf. He gestures down the
hallway, toward the connecting corridor with the Aurora. "Right this way
to my office." He stands aside to let \'Vouf pass, and then follows behind
him until they reach the cabin in the Aurora where Sickbay has been set up.

Quite some time later, \'vouf reappears from the door to the sawbones, 
practically prancing.  He exchanges a few words quietly with the Doc, and
then starts down the hall.  "Well, what\'re all you Pinkstinks staring
at, anyway!?  Getcher butts BACK TO WORK!"

About 30 minutes after breakfast, your first morning out, your
intercom comes to life:

"All hands muster on the main rec deck.  All hands to the main rec
deck.  Morning muster will be held in 10 minutes."

Around you you can hear the sounds of others also preparing for the
morning ritual.  "Wonder how they\'ll like if I show up half shaved."
and "The way I\'m feeling right now, they\'ll be lucky if they see me
by noon." and so forth.  Nevertheless, you know inside that this is
important, so you find it somewhere within you to go there, if only
to get your morning coffee.

- ----

You have all gathered in the main recreation area of the Alcyon,
except for a very few of you in critical positions that must be
occupied at all times.  The rec deck is not as large as you would like
for a gathering of this many people.  It is shoulder-to-shoulder
bodies.  In the time-honored military tradition, you have grouped
into your respective teams, and your command tem rep has taken
roll.

In turn, each of the command team reps walks to Admiral Ger and
quitely reports departmental status and body count.  He then returns
to his team.


Admiral Ger rises to address you.  In the case of those on station, 
the image is holo-projected at your position.  He speaks:

Good morning, fellow travellers.  We have now embarked on an epic-making 
journey.  We are travelling into the unknown.  What we might discover
there, no one knows.   However, we know there are dangers.  We are all
individually prepared to face them.  Now we must accept the challenge
of facing the unknown and its dangers as a team.  Our best chances lie
with working together.


I have a few announcements to make this morning.

First:  Many of you have not reported in.  Please contact your command
team rep (drop them some E-mail) right away, and let them know you are 
present!  Command team reps are:

	Engineering:	Johann Abuko
	Transport:	Etienne de Mer
	Security:	Lazer Farouk
	Med/bio:	Christian van der Merwe
	Phys. sci:	Karl Morser
	Soc sci:	Dave Sokuku
	Generalists:	Ralf

[If you can\'t reach yours, or if I\'m wrong - fire up the GM!]


=============
Second:  To date, only nine people have reported for their physicals.  
We need to get this done.


=============
Third:  We have some preliminary results of our continuing evaluation of
those R-alpha tapes they showed us.  In a nutshell, we\'ve determined:

   there is roughly 1-g at the surface, 

   whatever power is used must come from solar collectors somewhere 
   (rather than artificially produced),

   light gases (like Hydrogen) are extremely rare in R-alpha\'s
   atmosphere,

   the outside surface of the ring is a hardened, recently (in 
   cosmic terms) repaired, alloy,

   there is weather, but we\'re unsure of the overall air mass flow,

   there are CO2 (imagine a subscript) concentrations - suggesting
   animal life or open fires -- likewise small methane concentrations
   indicating herbivores,

   definitely artificial - no indication why it has been missed before.


We\'ll be continuing discussion of what we know during the jump.  Your 
comments are welcome, but please remember that right now we want to 
stick to facts; we can speculate later.


=============
Fourth:  I have been approached by several people about being on the 
"first" team to the surface, or to organize the away teams. Here, 
several parsecs from our destination, I have ideas for 14 jobs. Highly 
dangerous jobs ar marked with a *, and may not be taken by command crew.

Some of these jobs will require full teams, others just one or two people.
Mission duration is highly variable, but they will be initiated in the
order given below. These are all subject to changes based on new data.

Job 1: Probe Controller:
	Desingate a course for the probe inside the ring and collect data.

Job 2: System survey:
	Examine the solar system for objects not directly associated with
	R-Alpha.

Job 3: Exterior surface ananysis: *
	Match velocity with "underside", walls, and wall-tops, and gather 
	data.

Job 4: Initial flyby: *
	Attempt to match velocities with r-Alpha, and take an atmosphere
	sample. Subject to probe data analysis.
	
Job 5: Surface mapping: *
	Fly-by of entire surface, using high-speed visual equipment,
	generate a rough map of the surface. Depending on conditions and
	equipment capability, this my be a retrograde maneuver.
	
Job 6: Auxilary sturture analysis:
	If such structure exists (day/night cycling, solar energy
	collection, system defenses), investigate by close flyby (possible
	landing), and collect data.

Job 7: Initial landing:
	Choosing an un-interesting spot on the surface. Match velocities,
	discharge grav test vehicle?, and land shuttle? Test out various
	pieces of equipment. Frist surface mission.

Job 8: Satellite placement:
	Launch satellites, or affix them to the tops of the wall at
	the appropriate points in relation to the base camp.
	
Job 9: Base camp set-up:
	Land, and set-up the base camp.

Job 10-14: Site Alpha/Beta/Chi/Delta/Epsilon investigation:
	Based on previous surveys, visit the four-five most interesting
	spots via shuttle or grav transportation.

Remember the atmosphere is presumably rotating  at the same speed as the
surface. When a shuttle enters the atmosphere, it should be able to use the
air to keep it in place... ie fly through the air.

Also, We still need a few people to help create a ring simulation for 
R-alpha landing practice.  If done right, you guys could also 
use the simulation to pre-test some of your theories about how 
this ring is built, what gravity it has, and so forth.  Notify 
Eneri de Aith if you\'re up for this.

Any suggestions for new/overlooked jobs, contact me. Volunteers for various 
jobs, see your team leader, and cc myself.


=============
Fifth:  More than a few of you have indicated a serious dislike of having
your weapons locked away in a major armory.  No one, other than
our security team, has objected to anyone carrying weapons.  There
have been rumors of a few hot tempers as we settle in, and even
death threats.  No one has acted on them.  Please continue to 
demonstrate this self-restraint.

A more pressing concern is just how lethal some of your sidearms
can be to the integrity of your ship.  Some of you are packing 
heavy artillery.  I don\'t expect anyone, with the exception of
security, to worry about fighting those kinds of duels.  This is
supposed to be a PEACEFUL mission of exploration and discovery.

Here is a compromise proposal that I hope will cool everyone off - 
and it\'s OFFICIAL.  For everyone except security personnel:

[Actually Richard is usurping just about everyone here and hopes 
he doesn\'t alienate too many of you - now you know where to aim 
your flamethrowers.]  

All ranged weapons, other than your issue stun pistol, are to be 
locked up.  You can either turn them in to security, or you can 
*lock* them in your personal effects locker.  You can keep ONE 
loaded magazine for each weapon in your locker.  In the locker, 
not in the weapon...

You can keep your personal blades and point-blank-only (like laser
sword or force blade) energy weapons on your person.  High energy
tools, like torches or gas chromatographs, are the responsibility
of the various team leaders.  Keep an eye on them and make sure they
don\'t get used for sabotage or whatever. 


==========
Sixth:  Everyone should engage in the various training excercises we 
have available, while we are underway.  Physical conditioning is on the
Corondor Talisman every morning and every evening.  Personal weapons 
practice and zero-G drills are also on the Talisman; arrange times
with Lazer Farouk or Thule Jonson.   

Sensor operations, navigation, and piloting excercises are on the Paladin 
every morning at 08:30.   Everyone with any skill at all in these areas 
is needed.  [Write the GM for details, if you don\'t have them already.]  

The Paladin\'t computers are being largely turned over to scientific 
programming for the duration of the jump.  See Alexander Nayduz, Karl 
Morser, and Dr. Werner, to schedule time.




=============================

Those of you in the rec room notice the tell-tales on psi shields

Well. That\'s about it for today.  As you can see we all have a lot 
to do.  There is something special about being the first to go in.
There is also something special about doing the job really well.
Let\'s do both.


Carry On.

John Kim states he\'s been reading about programs being undertaken to
generate worlds and systems, and wants to know what became of the
efforts.

There are several commercial programs available containing generation
programs and official sector data from GDW\'s Imperium Campaign: GDW
produced some for Apple ][ some time back, and Digest Group Publications
produced IBM, Mac, Apple ][, and Commodore (Amiga, I presume) versions
of a World Builder program (detailed system/world generation) and the
IISS Second Survey Sector Data (37 Imperium and nearby sectors).

There are some small offerings on the Traveller Mailing List written by
listees.  I wrote gensec, a sector/subsector world UWP generator, and
mapsub, which turns gensec output into hex grid maps, either in ascii
(line printer) format or postscript (laserprinter) format.  Phill
Everson and Gareth Waddell wrote a program that generated systems in
accordance with Scouts (Book 6) Expanded System Generation.  Paul
Netherwood wrote a program to expand UWP\'s into a more human-readable
format.  Bill Morrison wrote a program to generate REAL star systems,
not specifically for Traveller, but in accordance with modern
astrophysical simulation.  Jo Jaquinta wrote a "1,000,000 stars" program
as an example of keeping a database of 1,000,000 stars for a PBM via
generating them as needed via a small algorithm.  All these are
available from the TML Archvies, maintained by yours truly, as TML
Packages SW1 through SW8.

Most importantly, there is a discussion list for this very topic, which
has been chartered to act as a mailing list peripheral to the TML.  It
is maintained by Bill Morrison, and you should contact him to join.
Here\'s the blurb from the TML Orientation message:

Star System Digest: morrison@pyr.gatech.edu (Bill Morrison)
	This person collects messages relating to computer methods of
	the generation, representation, and display of star system data,
	digests it, and resends it weekly to the Traveller Mailing List.

Actually, "weekly" is a misnomer, "periodically" would be a much more
apt description.  I strongly urge anyone planning to spend time
developing a system to join this discussion and get everyone fired up
about developing a program; progress is slow and comes in spurts -- I
think we\'re all pretty busy at our jobs most of the time.

As for legality of posting, it is legal to post your own programs to the
list, or adjustments to previously-posted programs.  It is legal to post
small snippets of data from existing copyrighted sources, in accordance
with law permitting "fair use" of copyrighted material.  As far as I am
concerned, any information posted by GDW or DGP, or members of those
organizations, to other public bulletin boards, are fair to post on the
Traveller Mailing List.  Specifically, anything submitted for public
dissemination by Joe Fugate or Gary Thomas is okay.

Yes, I have, and I\'d love to come up with a program to generate, store,
and display these on my Sun workstation or dumb ascii terminal at home,
and be able to browse through world maps, UWPs, subsectors, sectors, and
quadrants.

I don\'t believe so.

   The old \'Grand Survey\' by DGP included a map of Regina. I *think* it is in
the World Builders Handbook as well, but I\'m not sure about that. 
   Note, however, that this was the only planetary surface map in the \'Grand
Survey\' and was included as an example of planet-building.
   MegaTraveller Aliens Vol1 (also DGP) has maps for Vland and Lair, but there
are some bugs in the Vland map, compared to the map of Vland published in the 
\'Travellers Digest\' # something (between 4 and 8, I think) (also DGP).
   There have been a few maps in the \'Travellers Digest\': Capitol(?), Terra,
& Vland are the only ones that I remember.

   When it comes to maps in adventures, my knowledge is more limited 
(ie: Non-existent :-)

   A TL-12 gaussrifle will penetrate (low penetration) TL 10 to 13 combat armor
and TL 13 battledress if pinpoint location is used. 
   This is somewhat like the situation before the advent of automatic weapons
where a soldier have to take careful aim in order to accomplish anything.
   Even versus TL-14+ armours it will do the minimum damage based on the degree
of exceptional success. (But that would be true even of a sawed-off shotgun vs
TL-15 battledress :-/

   By this numbers, it would seem that the the Gauss-rifle is only used as a
frontline standard infantry weapon at level 13 (Ye olde \'Mercenary\' says that
at TL-12 it\'s only used as a sniper-rifle). And that it is superceeded by
energyweapons at higher techlevels.

   I think that the greatest bugs in the data for the Gaussrifle in the MegaT is
the fact that it\'s difficulty profile is listed as \'Rifle\' when, according to
the description in the Imperial Encyclopedia it should have a diff as \'Rifle**\'
(ie Gyrostabilized Rifle with Scope). With this modification, it is a ok
weapon if one takes advantage of pinpoint and remembers that the vast majority
of users of a gaussrifle has +2 to the task (+1 for Skill-1 & +1 for Dex 5+).
(Yes, I know about the major bug in the pinpoint-rules :-(

   
   For military applications, however, there is a nice solution to the problem.
(But it is probably to heavy for players to run around with). The RAM auto
grenade launcers (high TL) have a pentetration of around 36 for HEAP, thats
high penetration against battledress-15! 
   Since weapons like this (The russian \'Plamya\' 30mm auto-GL) can be used for
direct fire today (Terra TL-8 :-), I see no reason for restricting any of the
weapons on the \'Grenade Launcher\' list of the Players Manual to Indirect fire.
Especially since RAM grenades are rocket assisted and thus have a much flatter
trajectory than \'ordinary\' grenade-launchers grenades (that are more like the
ones that are used in the M203 (the big black tube under the barrel on some 
M16\'s))
   But indirect fire gives a longer range, so the method that I have used is
allowing direct fire as \'Rifle\' whith a maximum range *one range less* than the
indirect fire\'s max range.
   And sooner or later, someone is bound to get the idea to mount grav-
compensators on a RAM Auto GL to be able to run around and play rambo with the
piece...
   The automatic fire feature of a RAM Auto GL will give it an advantage, even
over a plasma or fusion weapon, at least as long as it has ammo...

And, best of all:
   The weight if it will keep the players from using it :-)

I use the Encyclopedia figures.

Reroll for each.

Probably not, especially since the firer don\'t controll where these rounds will
hit. They are just extra rounds that flies \'in the general direction\' of the 
primary target.

Short Discussion on Armor Penetration:
[Oh no! He\'s gonna apply pseudo-real-life physics on Traveller! Stop him! ]

   By using several pieces of data in a way that they not were intended to be
used :-) I arrive at the conclution that Penetration 7 is equivalent of being
able to penetrate 1.75 cm of armor plate steel. Penetration 8 and 10 are 
equivalent of 2 and 2.5 cm ditto. (I got here by using rule 5B in TD#15,
\'Radiation Exposure and Treatment\' that is about thickness of armour)
   A gaussrifle fires it\'s ammo at (i think) 1km/s. Maximum possible penetration
from a kinetic round is achieved when the speed of the round exceeds the speed
if sound in the material that the round is made of (4km/s to 6km/s, I think)
   As a quick rule of thumb, I\'d say that the penetration (in cm) goes up by
1.5 every time the speed of the round is doubled (up to max 6km/s).
(I got this figure from a guy who have worked with tank weapons, but he
 warned that it was very approximate.)
   This would give a 2.63 cm penetration if the round was fired with 2km/s
instead of with 1km/s. 2.63 cm equals penetration 10.
   The kinetic energy of the round, and the energy needed to accelerated, would
double twice, to 4 times the original amount.

   Summary: having a gaussrifle with a penetration of 10 is Ok, but it would
probably be heavier that a standard gaussrifle.

   (I checked this against the VRF Gauss Gun  (that fires ordinary gauss-rounds
but with 4km/s, and has penetration 20 (5.95 cm armor plate steel) and that
gives a factor of 1.85 every time the speed of the round is doubled. The
\'true\' value is probably somewhere around 1.7 - 1.9 instead of 1.5)

   I don\'t claim to be either a physics or astronomy major, but here is what
stands in the Radiation rules in TD#15 on the subject of cosmic radiation and
radiation belts.

   The hull of a standard starship (Factor 40 Bonded superdense) has a shielding
factor of around 2000 (1000 if you go exactle by the book and 2000 if you do
it mathematically :-) (For those interested I can mention that a factor 40
bonded superdense hull is about 1 inch thick (2.31 cm))
   
   Cosmic radiation is given as up to 3000 units per day in a radiation-belt
(I guess that this implies earth-type radiation belts like the Van Allen. I\'m
not sure whether the belts around major GG\'s are stronger than this, but I 
guess that they are. Here I have guessed that they are a factor 10 stronger.)
   30000 units per day means 1250 units per hour (dead within 15 minutes).
But a hull will decrease this by 2000 times to 15 units per day. That is no
*immediate* health threat, but it will be bad news for the descendants of the
crew...
   But remember that this is the *maximum* value in the radiation belts.
And if they are shaped like the Van Allen belts this will occur somewhere 
between 1 radius and 3 radiuses over the surface (wild guess). So any sane pilot
would go full throttle down to the atmosphere of the GG to avoid spending
too much time in the area of maximum radiation.

   But beware of drifting in orbit around a GG in a disabled ship for longer
periods...

If you\'re thinking of the Starform (aka Accrete) program, that was actually
done by me.  Version 3.3, by the way, is currently available.  It generates
moons for each planet using the same accretion algorithm as is used to
create the planets.  The new version also allows you to pick which type of
star you would like to generate, too (ie main sequence G3, giant K1, etc).

At this point, I would like to provide a better interface using graphics or
at least curses-like screen manipulation.  The problem with this is that
whichever way it goes, you lose portability (PC\'s don\'t generally have
curses or xwindows).  Since I\'m leaning towards an xwindows display, I\'d
like to poll everyone out there to see how many could use it.  How about
it?

Since the program is not really specific to Traveller, is it a good idea to
post it to this mailing list?  Where are the Traveller archives kept
anyway?

    'body' => 'Let\'s talk about what high, middle, low passage on a starship actually
buys for you.

According the the MT Imperial Encyclopedia, High Psg. costs Cr. 10,000,
regardless of the jump length.  Middle Psg. is Cr. 8,000 for the same
thing (and can be bumped by a High Psg.).  The price for Low Psg. isn\'t
stated, but I seem to recall a figure of Cr. 2,000.

Now if I\'m the owner of a jump-2 capable ship, and I know that I can get
a passenger from pt. A to pt. B (which are jump-2 apart) twice as fast
and for half the price of 2 jump-1 hops, wouldn\'t I logically charge
more than Cr 10,000, but less than Cr 20,000?  Cr 14,000 has a nice ring
to it.  Ditto for 2 ships with identical jump capability, if one is much
more luxurious than the other.  I could see prices of 120% on up to %300
or more for the nicer ship (maybe even higher!).

I guess my basic question is: does anybody have a \'rule of thumb\' that
they use for determining what the going passage price on a particular ship
will be, based on jump capability and quality, or do you just haggle with
your players each time?

I\'d just as soon not re-invent the wheel if I can avoid it.

In fact my delight with her books reawakened my interest in Traveller and

	I have often thought about using the Traveller system to run a campaign
set in the Union/Aliance/Compact universe. The ships are sufficiently similar in
concept to just use the Traveller specs and change what it looks like on the

Trade, commerce, planet-space relations, aliens and even war all seem just

sneaking suspicion that C.J.Cherryh, Mercedes Lackey, & Leslie Fish all game

Maybe, on the other hand you\'re getting the passenger there in half
the time of the jump-1 ship.  I suspect that many passengers would
happily pay a premium for that sort of service.  Cr 25,000?
Cr 30,000?  It probably depends on the local wealth and amount of
competition. 

Since higher jump ships are more expensive and have less capacity, the
premium should probably increase non-linearly.  What would a jump-4
ship charge for a 4 parsec trip?  Jump-6 and 6 parsec?

Or has the Imperium instituted price control on passages?  If so,
there shouldn\'t be many commercial ships with jump ratings higher than
absolutely necessary.  Of course, with things breaking down now,
that\'s all subject to change.  Anyone want to invest in a high-fee,
express passenger service?

[Perhaps a disclaimer: I\'m *used* to be OT illiterate (Isuppose I\'m a

Hmm.  No one that I\'ve seen has much to say about incidental stuff that
could still be very cool; sports, fiction, bogus news articles,
fashion, entertainment, ....  For instance, I remember an oldish board
game called gravball that would be fun to implement.  The recent posting
of a grav cycle sparked the idea for this sport:

|GravCycle Polo
|
|GravCycle Polo is played by two teams using [you guessed it] some sort
|of anti-grav devices.  These are generally armored but *not* armed.
|Team size varies as a function of the playing field, but might range
|from 5-10 players on a 100m cubic field.  The game ball is generally
|10-25m in radius and filled with some lighter-than-air gas to the point
|of near bouyancy with a small gravic device, anchored at the center,
|keeping the ball within the field.  The object of the game is to drive
|the ball into the other team\'s goal (out the other side of the field).
|The duribility of the ball is not entirely standard, but only in rare
|games at higher tech levels can a player ram the ball at full speed
|without risk of deflation (a penalty - applied to the survivor, if
|any).
|
|There are reports of similar (and not-so-similar) sports being played
|at lower tech levels on lo G worlds using winged mounts and/or less
|manueverable forms of heavier-than-air devices.
|
|Other variants include time limits on the gravic\'s air time between
|rechargings, modifications to the rules (or the ball) requiring the 
|use of special (1-4m) "sticks" for ball handling, use of nets (on both
|the ball and opponents), much smaller balls, ....  In one particularly
|dangerous version found on <insertyourfavoriteworldhere>, the players
|kneel on small discs that have no armor.  The player\'s legs are 
|strapped down leaving his or her arms to use the ball.  The disc is 
|controlled by head and foot movements.  Since the player wears little
|personal armor (disc cannot lift too much for too long; goalies and
|rear defence wear the most), the possibility of knocking the player 
|out cold (occasionally resulting in crashes; always resulting in loss
|of the ball) is pretty good, particularly when the attack is initiated
|from a higher altitude.

What are some of *your* high tech sports?  I\'m really curious how 
american football, european football, hockey, and lacross might be
altered by tech advances.  I\'d also like to see some kind of robot
gladiators (kinda like C-Robots & P-Robots, if you\'ve seen them), an
advanced form of Lazer Tag, PaintGunWars (or Survival or whatever),
BattleChess (ala Star Wars or the recent game of the same name), etc
....  Has anybody seen a fairly aweful cable show called _New Age
Gladiators_?  It\'s pretty outrageous.

I doubt that anything like Roller Ball (is that the name) or the game
in the movie _Running Man_ would ever be played, but ....

Well, the rest later.

Acutally, I would like to see it run in an MS-DOS environment.  I don\'t have X
close at hand (though I hope to have some day).  What would be best is if you
could write it using "Generic Routines" such as Line(), Pixel(), and such, then
in those routines, you could put the specific routines for the target system in
there.  Since most programs need a routine to start and end grapics (under X it
would be to create the window and close it), you could have a generic
StartGraph() and EndGraph() that we PC people could plug our own routines into.
That way, you could get a Mac, a PC, an Amiga, an X person to contribute their
own routines to do what you need.

I got burned in a similar fashion with my Traveller GM Aid.  It is written in
Turbo Pascal which kills it portability on the spot.  It is written to REQUIRE
VGA (Or at least 480 Lines of vertical resolution)...  Talk about non-portable!

I would post it, even if it isn\'t traveller specific, it could be used by
somebody.  If nothing else, mail it to the comp.source.misc moderator.

     True, indeed.  This would make a TML convention/meeting rather

     By all means.

 >WorldCon 91 is in Orlando.  \'92 is probably off-shore (I forget);

     Not quite right.  The upcoming (1990) Worldcon is in the Netherlands.  The
next (1991) Worldcon is in Chicago (Chicon IV).  The 1992 Worldcon is in
Orlando, Florida (Magicon).  If anyone wants the contact addresses, let me know
and I\'ll post them.  Even if you only get a supporting membership (*much* less
expensive than an attending), you can still vote on the Hugos...  :-)

 >San Francisco and somewhere inthe south-west are in the running for \'93.

     Yup.  Personally, I hope San Francisco gets it.  I think rather highly of
their bid.

     For those who live in the midwest, there\'s Marcon, starting  on 18 May.
I\'m going to be there, and I\'m usually pretty easy to find (look for the FidoNet
SF echo room party).

It seems that GDW has outdone itself again.What a wonderful useful peace
of recyclable material. This book is the biggest con since Judge\'s Guild 
went out of business. 

First all large ships have armour over 70. All Battleships rate their armour
as over 100. First this is illegal. At TL15 max armour is 75 as per ref\'s manual
+ a little more if you have a rock for a ship. Two even if this was legal
it gives all hits a minus 20! on the die roll because of armour. Basically
NO weapon except Meson Guns do any damage. They have PA battleships that are
said to stand in line of battle against other battleships. And do what,
pick their noses. "Sir our weapons are bouncing off of their ship.
"Dont worry ensign they aren\'t hitting us either. lets wait a week and hope
that Meson Gun ship shows up." Seriously your secondary weapon will ALWAYS
bounce off and your primaries MAY hit(only if he has armor 100 or less) on a
12.

Second They have carriers but with no launch tubes. Lets see we launch 1 fighter
every 20 min turn. In 2 weeks maybe we\'ll be able to launch our entire group.

They have tanker sqdns but no rules on how much fuel they can transfer per
unit time.

Most importantly there are no ships under 5000 t and only 2 of those. Except
for those 2 everything is 10ooot + ALL cruisers are 100000t. Unless u are 
running a Fleet campaign I see little use for the book in a campaign.

It appears that GDW just got a new spreadsheet program and went gonzo 
over it. Proofreading is at GDW\'s worst. Most ship designs have atleast 1
typo or error in it.

What is scary is that I have seen GDW products for 2300 and 1889 and they are
VERY professionally done. I fear that GDW might be trying to deliberately 
sabotage Traveller. Either that or the staff assigned to M-traveller is
at the bottom end of the game barrel.

First: you can\'t deny that a lot of work went into it.  Fifty plus ships,
quite well done, indicates that Marc Miller did indeed put effort into it.  I
like the idea of tracing the evolution of combat vessels over time, and some
of the comments are quite telling.

Secondly: it corrects a longstanding discrepancy between estimated imperiumwide
naval budgets [simple calculation, everyone ought to have done this a long time
ago] and depicted naval force levels.  The ships shown make naval fleets that
are bigger and more expensive by about the right amount to correct the 
differences.

Third: despite the number of ships that are in it, it lacks depth in a lot of 
ways.  We are asked that imperial naval development produced no more than three
ships in the same size range [BB, Cruiser, whatever...] per tech level...about
a hundred years.  That, and a total abandonment of previously designed fighting
starship designes...[Marc! Where\'d my Tigress go!?!? :-) ].

Fourth: there are some production and design flaws.  A lot of typos, most 
annoying to me being the appearance of a lot of spurious \'300,00 tons is fuel
tankage for distribution.\' lines, particularly irritating in 30kton Battle
Riders... :-)

Things like using spinal PA\'s can be forgiven; note that those are the \'light
battleships\' not the mainline ones.  The armour factor violations...well, in
my humble opinion it\'s a) not the first time [check out 101 Vehicles, which was
approved] and b) a silly rule to start with.  now that mass _counts_, armour
is really its own penalty.

And a couple of observations...
	{SIGNIFICANT} almost ALL the main line ships have a Def DM of 7.  I 
have a feeling that this means something.  The gaming that GDW does internally
must (speculation) have shown that this is the best balanced level.  Note also
that most of the ships have agility=0 to not exceed that level.  This is counter
to my personal intuition, and someone should ask inside GDW and try and see
if i read this right.

	{FOR NORMAL PLAYERS, PERHAPS MORE SIGNIFICANT}  the imperial navy is now
WAY out of reach when it comes to \'player resistance to/attacks on\' naval 
vessels.

The reason all the main line ships have a Def DM of 7 is because it is the best
practical for a large, heavily armored ship.
Def DM = 9	(best computer available at TL 15)
	-2	(size mod for ships 100,000 tons or more)
	+0	(agility)
	= 7

	The reason that the agility is 0 is due to the heavy armor.  Even though
mass doesn\'t affect manuver drive performance (handled, along with many other
tasks, by the manuver drive physics nullifier box), it still is used for
agility.  Thus
the heavy armor makes it prohibitively expensive to get any agility bonus.
Example:  A 100,000 ton ship with an armor factor 100 bonded superdense hull
would mass ~1.535 E7 tons just for the hull. In order to get agility 1,
it would require
*spare* power of  ~2.84 E6 MW = 158,000 kl of power plant (11.7% of the ship)
plus 1,024,000 kl for a 30-day fuel supply (75.8% of the ship if you
really want to try).
	Armor that heavy does have the advantage of making you immune to
everything except meson guns, as was noted in a previous post.
	I\'m sure I will find other problems when I finally get the book. (I wish
these things had warranties)

    'body' => '	In my search for ways to increase the cargo tonnage of merchant ships,
I discovered an interesting technique: Store most of the fusion plant
fuel in the form of water, and only refine it to hydrogen as needed. 
Water is a more space efficient way to carry hydrogen than LH2.  Since 1
kl of LH2 masses ~0.07 tons, and the mass of the hydrogen in 1 kl water
= 1/9*1 = ~0.11 tons, this results in a space savings of about 1/3. 
Most ships have fuel purification plants, and since they can refine
water obtained from ocean refuelling they can certainly refine water
already in the tanks.
	This tactic can be very helpful for power plant fuel, but jump fuel is
needed too fast (all burned in about 10 minutes) for the purification
plant to keep up.  Since the minimum size TL 15 plant purifies 200 kl in
6 hours, it should be able to handle almost any powerplant needs.  The
leftover oxygen can be dumped, used, or saved in excess tankage to
convert back to water with fuel skimmed from a gas giant.  Once a ship
has entered Jumpspace, the fuel for the jump has all been used, so the
water can be refined to LH2 and LOX.  I am assuming that the fuel
tankage for most ships is modular, so that you can have different fluids
in different tank sections (otherwise skimming and purifying would be
difficult).  In the designs I have done, I put in a small (5-10 kl) LH2
"buffer" for the powerplant fuel, and stored the rest as water.
	Hindsight makes this kind of obvious, and I think the only reason it
hasn\'t (to my knowledge) been noticed before is because the way an MT
manuver drive works is counterintuitive (ie only volume is important,
not mass).  In any drive that depends on mass, this won\'t work well
since 8/9 of the mass of water is oxygen, which is useless to the
powerplant.
	Any warship or explorer using this technique should probably have more
than one fuel purification plant in case one gets damaged or destroyed. 
Alternatively, they could just use a buffer large enough to get the ship
back to port for repairs.
	Another case where water can come in handy is for making multiple jumps
without refuelling.  Only the fuel for the one jump at a time needs to
be refined, saving 1/3 the space on the fuel for all subsequent jumps. 
Also if you are carrying fuel in collapsible tanks, it would seem to me
that water would be *much* safer and easier to deal with than LH2.
	What to do if you are a GM and don\'t like this: This is kind of tough,
since the only things needed for this to work are 1) - Purification
plants can handle water, and 2) - Manuver drives don\'t care about mass.
The only real way to get rid of it is to axe 2), which means throwing
out all the existing official ship designs, as well as making certain
types of ships impossible to build (ie anything with heavy armor).
	I\'m interested in any comments or suggestions you might have.

But why stop at water (OH2)?  Let your imagination run wild.

Ammonia (NH3)
  b.p. -28 deg. F (sorry about the English units, that\'s what
                   the book has).
  Density, liq:  42.6 lb/ft^3  =  .682 tons/m^3
  %wt of Hydrogen:  17.65%     (3/(14+1+1+1))
  Density of Hydrogen:  .120 tons/m^3

  About 1.70 times the hydrogen in the same space.
  (Density of H (LH2) is about .0708 tons/m^3)
  (Water worked out to about 1.57 times the hydrogen)


Methane (CH4)
  b.p.  -164 deg. C  (yup, these are in SI)
  Density, liq:  .5547 (not sure about this.  The table
                        also says .466 next to the gas
                        phase, but that is awfully dense
                        for a gas).
  %wt of Hydrogen:  25%     (4/(12+1+1+1+1))
  Density of Hydrogen:  .1387 tons/m^3

  About 1.96 times the hydrogen in the same space!
  Wow, almost doubled capacity!

Hmm, just found ammonia on another chart that says its
liquid density is .7710 tons/m^3 which would give a H
density of .1358 tons/m^3 or 1.92 times capacity.

A quick check into the thermodynamic properties of
these three (water, ammonia , methane) says:

143  kJ/mole to split H2O into H2 and O2
15.4 kJ/mole to splie NH3 into N2 and H2
18.7 kJ/mole to split CH4 into H2 and C(graphite)

Looks like it should be easier to extract hydrogen from
methane and ammonia than water.  Anyone know for sure?

I suspect methane is about the best you can do since it uses
four bonds with hydrogen--the normal maximum.  Of course, there
might be some superdense liquid or really messed up bond structure
out there that I don\'t know about.

Seriously, I am rather pessimistic about getting any kind of official adaption

In Mercenary and Classic Traveller, the to-hit and penetration rolls were
combined.  The gauss rifle\'s rate of fire was what made it so lethal, not its
penetration.  I don\'t know the figures for Azhanti High Lightning, but the
similar Striker system used the same figures as MegaTraveller.

Perhaps the combat armour was developed later in TL12 than gauss rifles, as a
defence against them?  Or maybe the gauss rifle is for use against less
armoured targets, e.g. civilian criminals, or low-tech societies you want to
conquer; and against serious opposition, you use laser rifles.

I still think that either the gauss weapons fire high velocity, i.e. supersonic
rounds, in which case they aren\'t silent except in vacuum or near vacuum; or
they are silent, therefore subsonic, therefore should have even lower
penetration values.  Even present day pistols fire bullets which move faster
than sound; silencers have to slow down the bullets, which is why silenced
weapons aren\'t as powerful - and why low-powered, subsonic weapons are more
easily silenced.  Gauss weapons could be fitted with a switch controlling the
current into the coils, so you could have a choice.

Actually, it\'s probably down to game balance again.  If a weapon with the
penetration to breach high-tech battledress and high rate of fire appears,
all the munchkins will trade in their PGMP\'s for such devices.  You either
get high penetration, and need the skill to use it; or you get lower
penetration, but it\'s easier to hit things.

Yes.  IMHO, of course!  Mind you, I graduated on Striker, where all weapons
had their individual DEX and autofire modifiers anyway.

The Striker system was, for every 2 by which your roll exceeded the required
number, you hit an extra target.  My system was, reroll for each, with a DM
of -2 for the second target, -4 for the third, etc.

> Third, if you are in auto-fire mode and there is only a single target,

The Striker system was, you chose the size of group you were firing at.  If you
got multiple hits, they were divided evenly among the target group.  If you
were only firing at one individual, he got the lot.  My system was, the
second, third and other targets could be the same as the first one.  The -2, -4
modifiers still applied though.  So, for a burst of 4 rounds, I could fire two
shots at the main target (1), one at the guy on his left (2), and one at the
guy on his right (3).  The first shot at target 1 is unmodified; the second
shot at target 1 gets a DM of -2; the shot at target 2 is at -4; the shot at
target 3 is -6.  Add on appropriate autofire, skill and DEX modifiers as well.

This is an interesting breakthrough in starship design. 
Sell your stock in refined fuel companies!
The facilities should be designed to allow sufficent fuel capacity if
water was being used, as the other gasses may not always be avaiable. 
Thus is methane is designated as providing a 30 day supply, then Ammonia 
would give you 26 days, and water 24 days, this should be plenty.

This brings up three points:

First: Are there any astophysicsts out there who can describe the
strucutre of a gas giant. i.e. what gasses are found at the top of the
atmosphere, how far down do you have to go to get ammonia, or methane? 

Second: If a load of mixed gasses come in to the tank, can the
refinery eliminate the unwanted material, and leave ammonia water or
methane. They are designed to extract hydrogen, and dump everything else.
Would two purifiers be necessary? One to sort the incoming wilderness
fuel, and the second to provide hydrogen for the holding tank.

Third: Another method of saving fuel space is logically considering
the energy usage of a ship. The fuel consumption is based on full output
24hrs a day for 30 days. Warships in particular devote a lot of energy to
weapons screens or agility.
We know that the fusion engines can vary their fuel consumption, as the
idling rules imply. anyways if you don\'t agree with this, then you can
always designate two fusion engines, one for the consant energy, and the
other for the on-demand energy.
Thus only allocating fuel for 12-48 hours of combat, a reasonable 
assumption I believe, even more fuel savings can be made.

That\'s what the Galileo mission is for.  It will drop a probe into
the Jovian atmosphere and we will (hopefully) get our first "cross
section" of a gas giant\'s upper atmosphere.

But I don\'t think you guys want to wait until 1996 (or whenever it\'s
supposed to get to Jupiter) so here\'s what I dug up in back-issues
of magazines.  Remember, it\'s all theoretical right now.

Jupiter:     ammonia crystals (white)              Top
             ammonium hydrosulfide crystals (brown)
             water ice crystals ?
             liquid Helium/Hydrogen

Neptune:     Diacetylene clouds                   Top
             Acetylene clouds (CHCH)              20 km down
             Ethane clouds (CH3CH3)               50 km down (from top)
             Methane ice cloud (CH4)              150-200 km down
             Hydrogen Sulfide cloud (H2S)         20 more km down

I suspect the really high atmosphere stuff is determined from the
radio-occultation of Voyager II behind Neptune, so it is probably
valid.  The rest (100 km+) is probably a good guess from spectro-
scopic analysis of sunlight reflected from the atmosphere.

My magazines don\'t go back to the Voyager-Jupiter/Saturn encounters
(heck, I was only 12 back then) so if you really want to get into
this stuff, dig up some good science mags (esp. Sky & Telescope,
Astronomy) of the Voyager encounters.
Jupiter:\'79-\'80  Saturn:\'81-\'82  Uranus:\'86-\'87  Neptune:\'89

I think I\'ll ask the guys on sci.astro

Separation of all this gobbledygook shouldn\'t be a problem.  Most
of the stuff seems to be in solid or liquid phase so all you do is
raise the temperature and each material boils off at its respective
boiling point.  (It isn\'t really this simple but it\'ll do for most
game purposes.)

What I don\'t know is how you go about separating ammonia into
nitrogen and hydrogen gas (or methane into graphite and H gas).
Hydrolysis works with water, but I don\'t know about the other two.
(I am not a chemist.  I\'ve been looking up these numbers in a CRC.
I hate chemistry.  No, I\'m not an astrophysicist either.  Just an
engineer-in-training who had to learn this separation stuff.)

Hey, just had a thought to add realism to the game.  In real life,
separation/refining takes lots of time (like using a still to make
alcohol) unless you use really big machinery.  This is a physical
constraint, so higher tech levels will only help a little.  (Maybe
I\'ll run that program my school has that simulates chemical processing
and separating systems.)

So... why not add a time penalty to refine this stuff after you get
it from a gas giant.  That way, if you regularly skim fuel, not only
are you risking a misjump, but you\'re going to have to wait a few
hours before you can jump away from that patrol cruiser on your tail.

And since only 5%-25% of the stuff you skim is really hydrogen,
make \'em go back into that gas giant where they know three system
defense ships are lurking!  Then make \'em go back five more times
before their tanks have enough hydrogen to make a jump.

I think this would cut down on players skimming fuel.  I always
hated how players would say "What?  500Cr/ton for fuel?  No thanks,
I\'ll just hop over to a GG and skim it."

Excuse me, but I don\'t understand how you can have more hydrogen in one
cubic meter of liquid methane than in one cubic meter of liquid hydrogen.
Just how is this accomplished, or did I miss something in Chemistry class?
In one meter cubed of LH2, it\'s ALL hydrogen, right?  Now in one meter cubed
of NH3, it\'s not all hydrogen, but some of the space is taken up by nitrogen
atoms.  So how can you save space by carrying methane, or anything else?

Hmmm?

Chris, I tend to think you\'re correct.  Liquid H2 has a density much
lower than that of CH4.  CH4 molecules are not much bigger than H2
molecules, but contain twice the number of hydrogren atoms.  Also, the
forces that cause the molecules to liquify may be stronger in the CH4,
so the CH4 molecules are more closely packed.  I think this is likely;
doesn\'t CH4 liquify at a higher temperature than H2? Wouldn\'t more polar
molecules do even better, getting real friendly with each other (oops
they just solidified)?

Sorry, my chemistry\'s a little rusty too.

Aiigh.  I don\'t know my Traveller well enough to comment very authoritatively,
but if the above statement is true, a Traveller perpetual motion machine
(i.e. an infinite energy source) exists.  Proof:

Take a body with finite volume V and mass m.  Let the energy required by the
maneuver drive to move the body a distance h against a gravitational field
of constant g be E(V,g,h) .  For a practical drive, there must exist a V,g,h
such that E(V,g,h) is finite.  Choose such a triple.  Note that the energy
gained in moving the body downward from a height h in the field by
conventional means (i.e. dropping the body :-) is mgh .

Thus, one can construct an engine whose energy consumption per cycle is
E(V,g,h) - mgh .  A perpetual motion machine can be constructed if there
exists an m such that E(V,g,h) - mgh < 0, i.e. m > E(V,g,h)/gh .  But for
fixed V,g,h the RHS of this inequality is constant, and we can make m
arbitrarily large -- Q.E.D.

Note that the energy yielded by such a machine increases with increasing m
for any given V.  Thus, one apparently wants an extremely dense object to
act as a piston in this machine...  Note also that such a machine could
apparently fairly easily realize a Doomsday device for the entire Traveller
universe (proof left to the reader), and thus had probably better not exist...

The densities are bound to change with temperature, but I don\'t

Apparently I was in error about the density of Methane.  Too
bad.  Ammonia takes the top spot again.  Hmm, what about solid
methane and ammonia ice...

The numbers are from the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics,
67th edition, 1986-1987, page B-447.  Great book.  Everyone
should read it at least once through :-).

As James pointed out, all materials don\'t have the same number
of molecules per unit volume.  Sometimes the trend is counter-
intuitive (tiny H2 molecules occupy a lot of space).  I never
did well on that chapter on attractive/repulsive forces so that\'s
the best answer I can give.  Remember all that stuff you learned
about ideal gases?  Trash it.  It only works well for noble gases.
All the other gases act really strange.

	Chris, the reason that you can store more hydrogen in liquid methane thathan in liquid hydrogen is simple: the volume per molecule isn\'t that much
different, even if there are five [one C and four H] vs. two [two H] atoms in
the molecule.  Since there are twice as many Hydrogen atoms in a methane 
molecule than in a hydrogen molecule [diatomic, only way it\'s stable in nature]
then you get twice as much hydrogen, though it weighs a whole lot more.
	I don\'t feel like going into gas and liquid theory enough to justify
the above, just remember that most of everything is empty space anyway :-) and
the ping pong balls bounce about like tennis balls do.

Re: mass-independent drives
	Interesting analysis.  This whole things points out a couple of
things some friends of mine and I have known and dealt with for a long time:
	Traveller isn\'t science.  A lot of it is pseudoscience that looks real
good. and

	If you bend things a little you can still make sense.  For instance,
at the beginning, things like hull armour weren\'t a factor, and so starships
tended very strongly to have a closely similar density.  When high guard came
out, they didn\'t want to deal with mass, so they continued that assumption.
Presumeably the \'armour really takes up volume\' assumption helped to 
counteract that, but i haven\'t done an analysis of it myself...
	Then, with Megatrav, suddenly we have a problem.  Our starships now
are like everything else and _weigh_ something.  Oops, wow, our drives didn\'t
used to take this into account.  Two choices for the designers now: either to
cheat on reality [really just realizing that there\'s been an innacuracy in the
rules] and keep the drives consistent; or they could revamp them totally and
risk having starships that had been made earlier not work in the new system.
They chose to assume that ships really were still close to the same density,
continuing a known reality gap, but that way we can still make ships like we
used to...
	All you have to do to correct this is to follow allong in the 
assumption that the rule is valid under...have a ship within [relatively] 
reasonable densities.  As long as you don\'t armour it to hell and back, it\'ll
work fine.  If you demand reality anyway, kluge a rule yourself and ignore
the new Fighting Ships and you might as well write Marc Miller a nasty letter
about it too :-)

[oh, final comment about ship densities... FINALLY we have starships that 
weigh more then they displace in water. :-) old ships just couldn\'t sink, so
using them as submarines was a bit difficult :-)]

     The PBeM game has brought a few questions to my mind about the
composition of forces for a future mulitary, (TL 12+).

     From Traveller book 4, Mercenary, under OVERVIEW OF EQUIPMENT,
Military Vehicles, pg 47:

"Tech Level 12: All vehicles have sufficient free-flight performance
that ground combat vehicles effectively no longer exist, having
merged with aircraft." ...
"Tech Level 15: Gunships mounting rapid pulse X guns and heavier Z
guns are virtually indistinguishable from orbital craft." ...

What does this do to the current day term of \'tank\' and \'fighter\'?
Grav-tank seems pretty obvious to me, but what do people mean when
they say \'fighter\'?


     The overall mission of a military is to allow your side free
use of a territory and to deny the other side free use of territory.

Specific missions:
   Take and occupy ground; accomplished by armor, mech-infantry and
infantry units.
   Interdict and destroy ground forces; Ground Attack Aircraft.
   Maintain air superiority; Fighter Aircraft.

The overall mission of a future military should pretty much stay the
same, but what about the specific missions and what accomplishes
them?

Well, "Take and ocuppy ground" still applies, and now that task falls
to the grav-tanks, grav-apcs and other grav vehicles along with the
infantry.

Now what about "Interdict and destroy ground forces"?  That use to
be the task of ground attack aircraft because they had the speed and
range to get to around, but can\'t that task now be handled by fast
grav vehicles?  The grav vehicle would have a longer on station time
because it wouldn\'t have to be flying all the time, it would also
be harder to spot, sitting stationary on the ground.  Sneak in fast
the night before, set an ambush for a convoy and split right afterwards.

What does all this do to the fighter\'s mission?  Or is a fighter the
high tech level \'gunship\' able to swoop down from orbit to attack,
not ground, but planetary bound forces?

     It seems to me that the future "Air Force" ceases to exist.
The main staple of a military is it\'s fast armored grav vehicles.
The space arm of a planetary force providing gunships and gunship 
interceptors.

     I recall seeing some TO&Es in The Journal\'s earlier issues, around
13-17.  I\'ll look there too.

     I haven\'t mentioned naval forces at all.  What does the futuristic
navy consist of?

     So, what do people think?

Seems to me some (or a lot) of this mass/volume inconsistency might
go away if the guys at GDW trashed the mass independent drive and
introduced some new lightweight super-strong metal/alloy/plastic.

Going from the armor type list in Striker, armor gets lighter with
a TL 7 composite, and then everything gets heavy.  Sure, the armor
value to weight ratio increases, but the density starts heading for
neutron star.

Of course, then you\'d have to come up with a good reason why said
armor is only used on spacecraft.  Maybe it degrades outside of a
vacuum, and you can\'t coat it for some reason.  That\'d be a better
reason for all the larger ships being non-atmosphere capable than
streamlining.  I mean c\'mon, if a battleship can pull 6 g\'s, it can
certainly match speeds with a planet\'s rotating atmosphere and make
a soft landing.

First of all a typo in John Kim\'s study of ammonia vs. methane vs.
hydrogen: Water doesn\'t really boil at zero celcius.

I agree with George Herbert\'s analysis of the problems of the starship
design vis. reactionless drives, the densities of the ships now
varies quite widely. For example a tanker can have a density
as low as 0.30 MetricTonnes per kiloLitre, a scout ship 0.68, and
a Battleship 15.4.
With regards to using alternate fuel, the difference in mass of 4x for
the fuel doesn\'t change the density so significantly that it is not
benificial to change fuel storage, regardless of drive type. eg.
a scout ship\'s density would increase to 0.84, less than 30% increase
for double fuel storage.

In looking over Fighting ships, for the above I discovered that the
armour violations are there, but not as bad as someone ealier reported.
At tech 15 up to 75 points (15x5) can be *added* to the hull. This gives
a maximum of 40+75 or 115 armour. 6 of the 21 battleships exceed the
armour restrictions: (BH-15, BH-14, BM-15, BL-13 by 5, BB-12 by 10, and
BB-11 by 15). However the error could be on the listing, and the
actual ship values could use the correct weaights.

Finally, I was trying to go through some of the physics/math behind
this reactionless drive problem, and I am having problems, perhaps
someone of a better physics background coul e-mail me directly and
help me out. (This probably explains why I dropped out of physics
back in 2nd year)... The problem is work is dependant on distance, and
given an engine acceleration d=.5at^2, however energy use for the
engine is linear with t, therefore if t varies, the work done by
the engine is not a constant? Help! (More details via e-mail).

Yup, it sure does. However, you don\'t need mass-independence to get energy;
All the is required is that the drive is reactionless.  I worked through
the equations,
and it turns out that any drive that violates Newton\'s 3rd law
(action/reaction) will
*automatically* violate conservation of energy. Here\'s why:
(anyone who doesn\'t want the gory details, skip the rest)

	Say we have a ship that masses 1500 tons, and requires 280 MW to accelerate
at 1g.  After T seconds of accelleration in one direction, the energy
expended will be
2.8e8*T joules, and the kinetic energy of the ship will be 1/2 MV^2
= 0.5 * 1.5e6*(9.8*T)^2 = ~7.2e7 * T^2 joules. This means energy in is
linear in T,
while energy of the ship is quadratic in T; so only at one value of T
will they be equal,
and by choosing sufficiently large T ( in this case more than about 4
seconds) the ship
has more KE than energy put in.
	My perpetual motion machine design is 2 sets of reverse linear accellerators
on an airless world, about 1000 km apart.  The ship runs on batteries, and it
accellerates to ~4 km/sec then cruises through the hoops, decellerating
magnetically,
and in the process generating electrical energy, which is stored. After
the ship is
stopped, it recharges its batteries with a fraction of the energy it
just generated and
heads back towards the other set of hoops. Result: Lots of free electric power.
(HLG Inc., Patent Pending)
	Of course, the energy-producing Megacorps either squelch this or have
a monopoly on it, so you still have to pay for power :-)
	I always have had fun figuring this sort of stuff out to bug the GM with,
especially since he is a physicist :-)  He is smart tho and usually says
"OK, if you\'re
so bright, figure out why everyone isn\'t doing it..."

thats the other half of the problem...:-)  Here are some ideas:
	If most of your fuel is water and your purification plant gets knocked out,
your in big trouble - so thats a reason for Navy ships not to use it.
	The Vilani won\'t use it cause LH2 works fine, and its traditional...:-)
	Anyone in a big hurry, or whose purification plant takes a long time
to finish would want LH2, so they can jump/fight/whatever quicker.
	I think that a combination of these reasons could explain why most
of the "standard" designs use LH2.  However, even if the ship wasn\'t designed
for it, you can still use water; this could be a common "trick of the
trade" for
merchants trying to squeeze in more cargo. I think that GDW and/or Digest
Group might accept that.  (This is also a possible reason to provide life
support etc, for the fuel tankage; it might be modified to hold other stuff...)
This still lets you design your own ships to use water -- have fun.

On the advantages of water over ammonia (heck, I started
the ammonia bit, might as well defend it :-), the point
I see is that although water is safer than ammonia, they
are both waaaaaay safer than LH2 at 13 K (or whatever).
I also don\'t recall which is more abundant, methane,
ammonia, or water.

Now to extoll the virtues of water:  Why should you be
worried about being unable to convert water to H2?  All
you need is some electricity and two wires.  Once you
generate a small amount of H2, you can run it through
your fusion plant to get more electricity, and so on.
"Damn, only two hours of air and we\'re out of fuel.
Frank, bring that pitcher of water, and we\'re gonna
have to bust your flashlight."

Do you even need electricity?  I always thought burning
unrefined fuel was like sending H2O straight through the
fusion plant, where the heat would be enough to break the
hydrogen and oxygen apart{.  Drive failures would be caused
by extranneous oxygen "clogging up the valves".  Hmm, more
to think about...

I have to comment on Dow Rieder\'s joke about bugging me with the little 
ways in which Traveller plays it fast and loose with spacetime. I wouldn\'t
say that I completely dodge the issue by saying, "OK, if you\'re so bright,
figure out why everyone else isn\'t doing it"; I tend to think that "everyone"
isn\'t doing it because it can\'t be done. In other words, I limit the physically
impossible parts of Traveller to doing the things they were designed to do by
the idiots who wrote the rules, and simply draw the line at anyone utilizing
them for nefarious purposes. I suppose I should justify the lines I draw, but
with a group of mature and unmunchkinlike gamers like the one I run, it isn\'t
a problem to say, "Look, there\'s a reason it can\'t be done: game mechanics.
If I must, I\'ll make one up for your characters to grok, but why bother?" 

It\'s easy to wave one\'s hands at fantasy games: if magic works, all bets are
off, period. Dragons and Unicorns and so on can exist, and that\'s all she 
wrote. Science Fiction games are a tougher proposition, though; at least to a 
certain extent, they must follow the physical laws of the world as we know
them. I did an informal talk on this at a GenCon many years ago, and postulated
two extremes when approaching this problem, and tried to rate various games
in terms of their positions between those two extremes. I called the extremes
"ScienceFantasy" and "Scientifiction," or if you prefer, "HyperFantastic" and
"HyperRealist". Both extremes start with the same assumption: that Einstein
was wrong. The HyperFant view is then, "Well, if relativity doesn\'t work, then
all bets are off, and let\'s have some fun." The HyperReal view, however, is,
"We have a lot of data on how the Universe works already; it doesn\'t berc
ome
invalid, only extended in applicability." One view shreds the reality we know;
the other adds elements of wonder to the familiar world. 

The primary advantage of HyperFant games is that they\'re more romantic. The
technology is glitzy and exciting, and it\'s easier to believe in things like
true love and Good vs Evil. The primary advantage of HyperReal games is that
they make sense, and are believable in a fundamental way that makes them easy
to relate to. Both means have their advantages and shortcomings; neither is 
"right" or "wrong." Also, both have fundamental pitfalls; all HyperFant games
eventually degrade into silliness when things get out of hand, and all Hyper-
Real games run into inconsistencies at some point.

Some examples: Star Wars is the ultimate HyperFant game, with starfighters
dogfighting, lightsabres humming, and (dead HyperFant giveaway!) "Blasters"
blazing. A close second is Space Opera, with its melange of Star Wars, Dune,
and the Lensman series of books. Other games with strong HyperFant leanings
are the Mechanoid games, Star Ace, Star Frontiers (if you think OUR jump
drives are nonsensical...!), and Star Trek. The FASA games tend to appeal
to wide audiences because they straddle the fence; both BattleTech/MechWarrior
and Shadowrun go full tilt in both directions. HyperReal games include FTL
2448, Traveller 2300, and (tho I haven\'t worked much with it) GURPS Space.
The ultimate HyperReal game from a scientific standpoint is unquestionably
Albedo, whose starship combat system is totally realistic and VERY unpleasant.
And in a close but fading second place, alas, is Traveller.

In the first ten years of its development, Traveller was the ultimate in
playable, accurate HyperRealist SF gaming. Everything made a fair amount
of sense, certain implied physicalities ("Thruster plates? What\'re THOSE?")
helped keep things consistent, and there was no attempt to glitz up the rules
by adding nifty-keen stuff like reactionless drives and so on. More problems
have been created than were solved by doing this, and instead of attracting
a wider audience with the "new and neato Traveller," GDW and DGP have only
succeeded in aggravating those with a penchant for consistency and accuracy
in their science. 

So what do we do about it, you ask? Well, every GM has his own methods; I
prefer to roll with the punches. Thruster plate technology is only useful
for moving starships, Jump technology only works for Jumps, and antigrav
technology is used for moving things around cleanly. I have other games that
I can run, like Space Opera and my own StarGate rules, that are either 
deliberately campy or brutally realistic; in Traveller, I prefer to wince
through Dow\'s discoveries, dream of the good\'ol\'days, and just try to run
the most fun game I can. Ultimately, it\'s the characters and the fun they have
that makes or breaks any RPG, and at least as of this rev of the rules,
people are still people. 

I\'m a shaddupa now.

You know, I just thought of something...Water is a good fuel source because it\'s
cheap(read: free), stable, and easy to handle \'cos it\'s just plain liquid at
room tempreature...but there\'s something wrong with that:

Who sez your fuel tanks are kept at room temperature?

What kind of idiot would waste all kinds of life support and power by putting
pressurization and heating coils into a starship\'s fuel dump??? Once that
stuff gets purified to H2, one short circuit could(assuming your engineer
rolled a \'2\' :-) blow the whole ship to Kingdom Come!  H2 is flammable at
STP, ani\'t it? 

Now of course, you could just stay on the water\'s surface until your purifiers
take care of everything, but what if you get run off?  If your fuel bays AREN\'T
pressurize and heated, then once you get out of the atmosphere and into the
(I think) ~4 deg. K of Space(tm), all that unpurified water will freeze, 
shattering your tanks! And don\'t forget, you\'re probably still running from
whatever shooed you off the water to begin with! What a lousy day!

Yeah, ammonia, methane, and LH2 have to kept at ungodly low temperatures to
be stable, but in space...no one can hear you melt...:-)

>  I still think that either the gauss weapons fire high velocity, i.e.
>  supersonic  rounds, in which case they aren\'t silent except in vacuum
>  or near vacuum; or they are silent, therefore subsonic,

	I think I\'ll beg to disagree with the intention of this statement.
	The basis of Gauss guns being silent is that they don\'t use chemical
	explosion to launch the missile, they accelerate it over an immense
	magnetic potential energy difference (or something like that ...)
	This means that the *mechanism* of the launch is silent. It also
	means that many varied missile types can be launched - delicate
	ones such solid chemical slivers (remember the bit on non-lethal
	weapons ...?) that wouldn\'t withstand the effects of an explosion
	to launch them.
	As for the rounds\' speed affecting the amount of noise generated,
	yes, I can see the argument about supersonic speeds. You probably
	would hear the MACH barrier pressure wave as it passed you, but
	your target wouldn\'t ... until it was too late.
	If you want to use the gauss weapon as a sniper tool, it\'s important
	that your position isn\'t given away (hence use subsonic speeds),
	but presumably it isn\'t important whether or not they know the target
	has been hit (they will presumably find out sooner or later ... :-)
	so why not use a variant of smart round that explodes on impact and
	gives the final `shove\' to the front portion of the round that has
	to do the hard part of penetrating armour ... ?
	
	Alternatively, do away with hand-to-hand combat and accelerate
	an asteroid straight onto the battle-ground. Nothing like a
	nice 300-km wide crater to encourage the other side to surrender!

Sorry, but I have to side with Adrian.  Speaking as an experienced hunter
and rabid firearms enthusiast, I can guarantee you that a 4mm supersonic
gauss needle makes a very noticable noise and a subsonic needle might not
even go through a thick leather jacket.  That is, of course, unless there
is some characteristic of gauss needles that cause them to behave in a sub-
stantially different fashion that other high velocity airborne projectiles.

Compare a 4mm needle (which is .157 caliber) to a .22 cal. long rifle
round.  The .22 round is supersonic and most of the \'crack\' you hear
when firing it is due to the sonic shock wave.  A .22 short round, on
the other hand, is subsonic and is noticably quieter.  It can also be
stopped by 6 inches of compressed cardboard or a single 2 inch fir board.

Since the MACH wave disturbs the air, even people behind the firing point
will hear the report, otherwise (in the above example) the person firing
the .22 long round would never hear anything but the chemical explosion,
since they were behind the muzzle of the rifle.  Personal experience proves
that to be wrong.

As for your target not hearing the report until it was too late, well,
no one is arguing that.  But the same is true today for game/combat rifles
such as the 7mm Magnum, the .22-250, the 25-06, and 5.56mm NATO (to name a
few), which also fire supersonic rounds.  And finally, what would it matter
if the sonic wave preceeded the slug?  The .45 ACP (which was the standard
sidearm for U.S. armed forces until a few years ago) is subsonic and I
doubt that there are any documented cases of people dodging the slug after
they hear the shot fired at them.

While the magnetic acceleration process of the gauss weapon may be ABSOLUTELY
silent (and I have my doubts about this also), anyone within several hundred
meters of the weapon will be treated to the staccato crack of gauss needles
punching holes in the air.

Bertil, I don\'\'t think your idea solves anything. What sort of potential

is reactionless means that you make an object move without waste, in fact
with the use of less chemical energy than the kinetic energy you require.
Thus, you\'re creating energy out of nothing. My personal wish was that the

            design, weapon effectiveness et. al., this may seem trivial,
            but I though y\'all might enjoy it.

        I recently had to take a trip to Huntsville, Alabama,and spent a
            day at the Space & Rocket Center located there. Now for those
            of you located in the Spinward Marches, Huntsville is the
            home of the Redstone Missile Arsenal (developer of, among
            others, the Nike, Ajax, Hawk and Redstone missiles), The
            George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (NASA\'s center for
            propulsion development), and the U.S. Space Camp and U.S.
            Space Academy. The Redstone rocket that powered the Mercury
            space flight were built and test stand fired here, as were
            the Saturn I (Gemini), Saturn V (Apollo and all Moon
            missions), and much of the Shuttle. All of these are on
            display, including a full scale Shuttle, with external tanks
            and SRB\'s! Very Impressive!

        And the museum has lots of hands-on exhibits on every aspect of
            space travel. I never saw a kid wandering around with that
            "why did I get dragged Here" look! Many items on display are
            the real thing, like Wally Schirra\'s Sigma 7 Mercury capsule,
            and the Apollo 16 cockpit. In addition there is a large
            Omnimax theater (67\' hemispherical screen) that, at the time,
            was showing "The Dream Is Alive". Very Good!

        Also, there is a bus tour that takes you through the Arsenal and
            Marshall center to see the test-stands where engines are
            fired, and gives you a tour through the working mock-up of
            the Space Station Freedom (due to begin launching in 1995).

        Cost for everything (Museum, Theater, and Bus tour) is only
            $10.00. A steal! I spent 6+ hours there and still had more to
            see.... I\'ve been to the Nation Air and Space Museum in
            Washington, and while that\'s great, this is better!

I think what Bertil was trying to say is, what is wrong with turning a ship
from having X megajoules of energy stored as potential energy, to a ship
having .9 X megajoules of kinetic energy and .1 X megajoules of waste energy
(e.g. heat) without having to dump a load of stuff out of the back to satisfy
Newton?  This doesn\'t create energy out of nothing, and doesn\'t violate
conservation of energy.  Having said that, see below.

Let the mumblers take a look at some GDW drawings of starships.  The old
supplements 7 (Traders and Gunboats) and 9 (Fighting Ships - not to be confused
with the new one) have pictures of ships with exhaust nozzles.  

All my models of ships (made back in Ye Olde Traveller days) still have exhaust
nozzles, which should tell you a bit about my faith in reactionless drives. :-)

    'body' => 'Ok, went home and thought about it and cranked some numbers.  Figured out why
you don\'t want to use different fuels.

The average starship has much if not most of its fuel volume as jump fuel.  
Now, from Starship Operators Guide [yes, it\'s not GDW but they approved it so
i figure it\'s official], the Zuchai energy storage capacitors in a Jump drive
can\'t be held charged for more than two hours safely; three max.  Thus, the
jump powerplant must generate its power within [let\'s say for safety\'s sake]
an hour.  And it needs enough fuel to run for an hour...

Now, if we\'re going to purify something else on the fly, this means that we
need six times the usual purification plant [which will take 6 hours].  At
TL 15, the purification plant is 20% of the fuel volume for the 6hr version.
For our faster requirements, it rises to 120%.  This means that the total
of jump fuel volume and purification plant is now 220% of what we started 
with...and even with a fuel of relative hydrogen density 1.9 we are still
16% over the volume of pure hydrogen.  You Lose...

Even if we\'re optomistic, and assume that we can push the two-hour lower
limit on crystal charge, we\'re at 160% volume, divided by 1.9 to 84% of the
origional volume.  We only gain 16%, and in the process lose reliability 
[if the purif plant breaks we\'re stuck], safety [how long do you WANT to hold
those crystals charged???], and convenience [ya want WHAT instead of hydrogen?]
compared to hydrogen.  Plus, the added cost of the purification plant [a not
inconsiderable 150kCr/kl ] makes this a touchy option.

It is no longer the wonder-fuel.  Go home, people, and have a good night.  If
you really want to trade off the 16% for the added headache i won\'t mind if
I\'m GMing, but i warned ya what\'s going to go wrong :-)

real world physics (or chemistry as it turns out)...

Ammonia is synthesized from N2 and H2 by the Haber-Bosch process.
One of the big problems with this process is that for the reaction
N2 + 3 H2 --> 2 NH3  to proceed quickly, you have to raise the
temperature.  But raising the temperature shifts the equilibrium
back towards N2 and H2.  This is a big problem when you\'re trying
to make ammonia out of N2 and H2, but it is exactly what we want
if we\'re out to purify ammonia into H2.  In fact, at 800K the
equilibrium constant calls for:

          (pressure H2)^3 * (pressure N2)
          ---- = 25000
                  (pressure NH3)^2

i.e.  You don\'t need a purification plant.  All you need is a bit
of empty fuel space (to allow for the gaseous ammonia, N2, and H2).
>From there:
     Heat the ammonia to 800K
     It vaporizes and splits into N2 and H2
     Separate the gases with a grav plate.
     Dump the N2 into space
     Send the H2 into the power plant and jump drives

The only other thing you\'ll need is insulating partitions dividing
your fuel into jump-1 amounts.  It wouldn\'t do to vaporize all your
fuel when all you wanted was a jump-1.

Wow, it\'s even easier to purify than water!

     Lately there has been some traffic on subsonic and supersonic
rounds for sniper rifles.  Well, perhaps I can help a little here.

     There are exactly two things paramount in mind with a sniper
with a mission:  1) getting away alive 2) getting the target.
Notice that personal survival is of a higher priority.  This is
emphasised over and over again in training.  You can always come back
for another try at the target (that is, if you get away ok).

Now, before you blow up, no, I have not seen live combat (thank GOD!).
However, I have participated in excercises that were damn real, and
that I was \'killed\' because either I was detected approaching, on
hitting the target, or on leaving.  The first and last were my fault.
The last is dependant on how the mission is set up.  If it is a
relatively easy hit, you can stand off a nice long distance and
deliver the present at conveniece.  However, on most targets that
snipes are sent after, you have to get in relatively close, and
that is where you want the quietest damn shot in the world.  This
really works.  I\'ve succeeded on penetrating a hard target, making
the tag, and getting away safely because I waited until the conditions
were right.

     Ok, ok.  Enough rambling.
1)  Long distance shot.  Use the high velocity rounds.  It makes for
    a better shot.

2)  Short distance shot.  Use low velocity, cause anything you can
    do to cut down detection in ANY WAY increases your life expectancy
    tons.

This really is a decision that has to be made by each man.  I can
think of only one \'mission\' where two shooters actually choose the
same approach and all the rest.  Everything else is personalized to
extreme detail.  Each has different methods, approaches, styles,
etc, etc, ad nauseum.  You may think the shooter as an impersonal
bastard, but in ways we live more in a short time than joe normal
lives his entire life.

(Personally, I like this chemical sliver stuff..they\'d never notice me!)

What you\'re proposing here is just an ammonia-specific purification process.
I would bet that the easy way to do this would be not in the tank, but in a
seperate purifier, which ought to be simpler and smaller than the book ones
since it doesn\'t have to be able to deal with anything but ammonia.

>From a process-design standpoint, i can guarantee you that doing the above
operation in a continuous flow is easier than in one reaction chamber
[fuel tank].  
Shall we treat it as a smaller purification plant?  Let\'s say only 25% of
the normal mass due to less required flexibility?
It will probably also need more power...


Ok; revision of my previous posting with better numbers reflecting this:
For the one-hour version; 30% of fuel tank volume in purification plant, 
at 0.4 mass tons and 150kCr per kl of purifier [the same as normal purif
plants.]  Total vol 130% of ammonia tank vol; with the hydrogen density boost
the total volume drops to 68.5% of what the LH2 fuel would take up.  For
a two-hour charge, it\'s 15% of tank vol in purification plant and total vol 
goes to 115% of fuel vol; corresponding to 60.5% of the corresponding vol
for LH2.  You still have the added cost due to the purif plant and possible
problems from the purifier failing to deal with.

Quite true. I did a similar analysis. I think that in my original
posting it was
stated that the method wouldn\'t work for jump fuel.

>The average starship has much if not most of its fuel volume as jump fuel.

That depends.  A scoutship has jump-2 and, if memory serves, a 864Mw
powerplant.  It needs 202.5 kl of jump fuel, and 311.04 kl to power the
fusion plant for a month.  Storing the power plant fuel as water would
save about 100 kl, which would more than triple the cargo capacity.
	Any ship with a purification plant must have segmented fuel
capacity, so storing some fuel as water and some as LH2 works. (although
you probably want to adjust the temperature in a segment before
switching fuel types :-)

Yes it does.  I posted a detailed example showing why recently.  Even if you
use Bertil\'s idea of  (Energy needed for drive = KE added to ship) it doesn\'t
work because you need a non-accelerating reference frame to measure KE.

Example: Suppose you have your ship between planets A and B, which
are moving with respect to one another.  We now have to choose a frame
of reference, say A.  Say the velocity of B with respect to A is 1e3 m/s.
The KE of ship relative to A is 0, and relative to B is 5e5*M joules.
The ship now accelerates to 1e3 m/s relative to A, in the direction
opposite to B\'s motion.  Now the KE of the ship relative to A is K1 =
5e5*M joules, where M is the mass of the ship, so we expend
(K1 + waste) joules to power the drive.  However our velocity relative
to B is now 2e3 m/s, giving a KE of K2 = 2e6*M joules, which
is an increase of 1.5e6*M joules, creating 1e6 joules of "free" energy
with respect to B.  With a rocket, that energy wouldn\'t appear since
is has to spend energy to accelerate the reaction mass and it masses
less afterwards.

2 hour zucchini (or whatever) crystal limit.  This time, it\'s all
kosher with the rules.  I don\'t have MegaT yet so I can\'t do any
exact calculations (George, you feel up to it?).

Who says you have to purify your fuel "on the fly"?  If you put
in a moveable partition between the refined and unrefined fuel
(like maybe two "bladders" which can expand to fill the entire
fuel tank), you can refine H2O or NH3 before you start your jump.
You wouldn\'t be able to refine it all, but you could string two small
jumps together to go further than you normally can.

Example:

Since I don\'t have Mega-T, I\'m going to ignore power plant and
maneuver drives.  Their fuel capacity should help out though by
letting you "steal" some of that space to put refined fuel in.

Take a jump-3 trader.  The captain gets a hot tip that would
let him make a hefty profit on his latest cargo.  Unfortunately,
the destination is 4 parsecs away.  Never fear.  The captain
fills 77.5% of his tanks with ammonia.  This is enough hydrogen
for a jump-4.  He purifies enough to make a jump-1 (19.4%).
This LH2 occupies 33% of the fuel tank, while the leftover
ammonia takes up 58.1% (77.5%-19.4%).  So everything fits.
After the jump-1, the captain purifies the rest of the ammonia
until his tanks are filled.  He then makes his jump-3 and is
promptly killed by pirates because he has no maneuver drives. :-)

If William Dow Rieder\'s scout ship numbers are right, let\'s see...
202.5 kl of Jump fuel, 311.04 kl of power plant fuel...
Total fuel capacity = 513.54 kl.  Since the purification plant
can keep up with the power plant, store the power plant fuel as
ammonia.  This cuts down its volume from 311.04 kl to 180.84 kl.
You now have 513.54-180.84 = 332.7 kl left for jump fuel.
Even if you go with straight LH2, you have enough space for
three parsecs worth of fuel (101.25 kl Lh2 for one parsec).
If you go with ammonia, you can put in 235.48 kl (four parsecs)
in.  Purify half of that to leave 117.74 kl of ammonia and
202.50 kl of LH2.  They total 320.24 kl so it all fits.  Do
your first jump-2, then you still have enough methane left
(er, ammonia, sorry) for another jump-2.  

In fact, you\'re just 4.03 kl short of being able to do a jump-1,
jump-2, jump-2.  If you really wanted to go five parsecs, you\'d
only have to give up 4 cubic meters of cargo or power plant fuel
space.

seem to have this idea that space is cold. Only objects have temperature, space
is a vaccuum and thus has no definitive temperature at all.
	Remember your thermos flasks? A vaccuum is a very good insulator. If
anything you ship will be too hot. When half the solar panels were ripped off
Skylab when it first went up the team had to contend with temperatures over
100oF at times. A spaceship adsorbs all radient energy, raising the 
temperature. The life support system radiates this back into space.  That\'s
why they\'re all bright and shiny. Remember how important Albedo was in the
old Scout\'s book?
	In my own campaign the engines can process their fuel at a variety of
temperatures (certain are more optimal of course). The life support then uses
the fuel mass as a heat sink. Before jump the fuel is cooled (possibly using
outgassing/evaporation). During jump the ship can\'t radiate energy and so the
heat is pumped into the fuel tanks too keep the place livable. After exiting 
from  jump the heat is then pumped outside.
	My players are crewing an old standard Scout ship. We all already know
the problems that design has with life support. And they are manning eight
people! The jump starts OK but as the days lengthen the temperature raises,
the smell gets worse, and people get narky. The crew nearly mutinied when they
had to jump twice without flushing the air system.
	Other thoughts:
	If your maneuver drives work better with preheated fuel, you can get one
hell of a boost coming out of jump.
	Assuming skimming heats you up, a quick skimm followed by a quick jump
means one hot trip.
	Mold and mildew can be a problem when your life support goes slightly
wonky. They are in Mir. Hot humid air... it\'s no wonder Scout ships smell.
	Misjumps that cause you to stay in jump longer are real headaches. The
heat exhaustion will probably get you before the 4D-madness.

Oh, *@!~.  Relativity strikes again. :-)

After reading this, I did a bit of working out on some scrap paper myself,
which started out with conservation of energy and ended up with conservation
of momentum.  If you really want a long, boring load of ASCII, I can post it
here.  Suffice to say, I was right to leave all those exhaust nozzles on my
model ships!

There is one possible loophole, which someone on rec.arts.sf-lovers suggested.
So-called "reactionless" drives are nothing of the sort; they use the rest of
the universe as a reaction mass.  Someone else can figure out how, or if, this
can be done.  I\'m sticking with rockets - they make the models look better.

You want perpetual motion machines?  Try assuming that a black globe absorbs

FOOL TO FEED THE DRIVE


A hundred parsecs out, on a ship quite second rate
The engineer, McQuillin, sent the word up to the mate:
"Our engine\'s out of steam," he said, "and soon our ship will die,
If we can\'t find a planet with fuel to feed the drive."

Now, our ship\'s a noble lady, and our captain, she is, too,
But our engineer is none too bright; the dimwit of our crew.
The captain said,  "I thought you filled the tanks on Vega Five."
McQuillin just looked sheepish.  He forgot to feed the drive.

Can curses stir the gods of space who dwell beyond the stars?
If so, they surely woke up then, for we used up most of ours.
We thought we\'d drift forever, lost between the stars we\'d die,
And all because McQuillin bought no fuel to feed the drive!

But then the captain\'s eyes grew bright.  She said,  "It seems to me
That a fusion drive burns H2O."  McQuillin turned to flee.
"Grab him, boys, and hold him.  He\'s no good to us alive,
But two hundred pounds of water will feed our dyin\' drive!"

So once again we fly through space, avoiding all the stars.
Who knows what ruin will take us, what evil fate is ours?
We didn\'t find our planet, but we\'ll all but one survive.
As long as we are granted some fool to feed the drive!

It is also worthy to point out that a simple pillow when held against the
muzzle of a gun, be it supersonic or subsonic, quiets the sound to the point
that a person 20 feet or so away cann\'t hear it clearly.  Admittedly we
are talking about a single shot.  But there are TWO things that cause the
noise of gun fire.  First and obviously, the expanding gasses of the burning
gun powder, are easily quieted.  Second is the bullet passing the sound
barrior.  Another easily solved problem.  The only real hard part is making
the silenecer have enough space to allow the compression wave to be absorbed
and still have something that is small and light weight.  That is why you will
notice the larger/faster the round, the bigger the silencer.  It would also
be theoretically possible to silence a 155mm Howizer but not practicle.

I don\'t think I\'d go so far to call the problem "easily solved", Dave,  The
pillow idea (or any other means) still boils down to the same simple truth:
if you want a silent round, reduce it\'s velocity until it\'s subsonic.  This
is not as easy as it seems (and for large, powerful rounds, like a .44 Magnum,
a pillow is not nearly enough).

A typical .357 Magnum round (w/ a 200 grain slug, which is roughly 12.9 gm.)
will have a muzzle-energy of 590 ft./lbs. (800 Joules), and a muzzel-velocity
of 1,158 ft./sec. (or 353 M./sec.), which is slightly above the speed of sound
(1,120 ft./sec. at sea level).  Now, 2 simple formulas involving energy, mass,
and velocity (using the metric system) are:
                (((E(j) * 21,630) / M(g))^0.5) / 3.28 = V(m/s)
        - and - ((V(m/s) * 3.28)^2 * M(g)) / 21,630 = E(j)
where E(j) is energy (in Joules), M(g) is Mass (in grams), and V(m/w) is
Velocity (in Meters/Second).  Given these formulas, and the fact that the
mass of the .357 Mag. slug doesn\'t change, then it follows that to make
the round\'s velocity drop below supersonic, we must reduce the total energy
of the round by 53.9 Joules (work it out for yourself).  Since this equals
only about 2/3 the muzzle-energy of a .22 short, a thick pillow MIGHT do
the trick, but for more powerful rounds (anything in the high-powered rifle
catagory), forget it.  And you still have the leaky cylinder to contend with.

Leaky cylinder?  I\'m glad you asked.  Revolvers cannot be effectively silenced,
since a significant portion of the blast from the powder burning leaks out
at the interface between the cylinder and the barrel.  Semi-auto pistols
don\'t have this problem, but the slide itself is extremely noisy as it works
(let the slide on an empty pistol slam forward and you\'ll see what I mean).
I guarantee you that it CAN be heard more than 20 feet away.  Most silenced
weapons (both military and covert ops.) are single-shot pistols, firing
subsonic rounds.  To be effective, they must be employed at close range
(less than 10 meters), and must be acccurately aimed at an un-armored part
of the victim.  Sniper weapons (long range by definition) are never silenced,
as physical laws prevent the design of a weapon that is both silent AND
effective.

(Note: You can get the muzzle-energy/muzzle-velocity/slug mass data from
any Reloaders Handbook.  Most sporting goods store carry them.)

         should try a more direct approach."

I have been following the discussion of silenced weapons with some interest.
Without wishing to rain on anyone\'s parade, I thought it might be worthwhile
to note that in the Traveller universe (and any game universe set more than
one hundred years in the future, if it\'s high tech), the question is moot.
Lasers are probably going to be VERY silent, compared to slug throwers, and
will not have to deal with the problems of reduced power.  If I were an
assassin, 3,000 years in the future, and I wanted to make a quiet attack, and
had to use a firearm to do it, I would use a laser.  I would suspect that
for any future game universe, a person needing to use a firearm in a stealthy
manner would rely on one of two methods:

   1) A laser, since it is quiet, and does not lose power by being quiet 
(I do not know if it is silent; I imagine there is a soft crackling noise
from the laser superheating the air as the beam passes through it, but this
cannot be any louder than the noise released by contemporary silencers).

  2) A low calibre pistol at point blank range.  (I understand this is how
many assassinations are done today.)  It takes real balls to do this, but
what you do is to walk up behind someone, put a .22 or .25 to the back of
their neck or head, pull the trigger, AND THEN JUST WALK AWAY AS IF YOU 
WERE JOE AVERAGE AND HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING WRONG IN YOUR LIFE.  The guy
you have just snuffed will fall.  On a busy street, it will be several
seconds before anyone realizes that the guy has anything more wrong with
him than stumbling on a cracked sidewalk.  By this time, you\'re gone.

For the second method, I recommend soft-nosed, explosive, hollow-point, or
glaser safety rounds.  Against an unarmored target, they will do more damage.
If you\'re using a .22 or .25 (both 5-6 mm.) pistol rounds, you need all the
help you can get.  

By the way, while we are on the subject of assassinations, I would like to
mention that no one seems to be talking about the possible applications of
microrobotics in Traveller, for assassinations or other enterprises.  What
do you people think about wasp-sized robots, with VX nerve toxin in the
stingers, homing in on people based on their individual chemical signatures?
(Users would need a skill like Robotics or Remote Controls--I call it 
Remotes in my game--to use the robots.)  They fly about as fast as angry
hornets, hardly ever miss, and if the victim does not get medical attention
in about one minute, they are dead, dead, dead.

Any other interesting ideas?

Well, it\'s the end of the year here at dear old Pud U., and I\'ve a few
things to say before I head out. First, and most unfortunately, I haven\'t
yet found out if my friend back home will have an account I can borrow
for this mailing list, so Dr. Morser may be effectively silenced until
next semester. If you just _have_ to get in contact with me about something,
I can be found via snail-mail at:
		3927 Elmwood Ave.
		Louisville, Ky.  40207

Secondly, my final action before going into low storage(or whatever), is
to ask if any of the Social or Generalist teams would care to work on
a somewhat more flexible translator program. I have the computer skill, but
no linguistics, and there\'s no telling what kind of stuff that probe\'s going to shak
going to shake loose.

Thirdly, I\'m very sorry for the last-minute nature of this message(I\'m leaving
this afternoon)...I really should have given more warning, but I\'ve been 
in a real crush this week for finals. 

And finally, on the subject of silencers...Actually, there _is_ a good
reason for putting silencers on military-type sniper weapons; You see,
a silenced weapon doesn\'t necessarily mean the sound of the round going
through the sound barrier is quiet(as has already been explained by a
number of people), but it does mean that that the sound of the actual 
explosion of gunpowder is quiet(if a halfway decent silencer). Now while
that may not sound terribly useful to you, it means that there\'s no way
to tell(by sound, anyway) _where_ the shot was fired from...And let\'s
face it, as soon as some poor fool\'s head explodes for no apparent
reason, somebody\'s gonna guess that there\'s a sniper somewhere anyway...

				Hasta la bye-bye, guys

If you\'re playing Traveller and you\'re that worried about being
both silent and effective, why don\'t you just use a UV or x-ray
laser rifle?  X-ray will probably go through walls as well. :-)

How did all this start anyway?

I thought of the same thing, only for spying/espionage--radio
controlled mobile bugs that look and act like your typical everyday
insect.  Add some high tech visual equipment (you math types can
have fun figuring out the maximum resolution through a small lens)
and you don\'t need to watch where it\'s going or waste weight to
store pictures.  To avoid detection, use an idea similar to what
we\'re using with space probes--have the bug transmit a very weak
signal and use gobs of receiving equipment to filter it out from
background noise.

That\'s as far as I got, never got to use it on players.  They would
have probably killed me if I did.

[character on]

	Suddenly realizing, by the sudden shift in the ship\'s gravitic
compensators that a large number of the crew seem to have accumulated in one
spot, Ralf checks his e-mail and finds that there\'s some sort of party going
on... he takes (another) quick shower,  tosses several of his favorite
creations into his hand computer and heads up to join the fun.

(a short while later, at the party...)

	Ralf wanders around the party for a little while;  those yet
unfamiliar with him will note that he has sharp features, is rather thin, and
has a very dark complexion, (rather like a native of India from earth).  His
build and manner of moving suggest somebody from a low-grav world or space
habitat. The first thing he does on arriving is slide a small holocrystal (if
anybody gets close enough to get a look, the miniscule label says "drunk XVI")
into his odd-looking hand computer.

	Ralf finds a holodisplay and slides one of his creations - a full wrap-
around simulation of a theoretical approach to a ringworld construct, complete
with fractally generated (but vague and unspecific) glimpses of the inner
surface - into the dataport and sets for continuous display.  A few moments
later he jacks in Corporate Wars III, a computer simulation of the early 21st 
century "robber barons" (corporate execs) and the competition they enganged
in, including sending small scale mercenary assault teams after the
competition\'s corporate offices... 

	Apparently, Ralf is catching up quite fast on the rest of the
party-goers;  he\'s either downing a lot of alcohol, or he has an inordinately
low constitution, because he quickly (although nobody has seen him taking a
drink) reaches that state of inebriation that can be referred to as "loose" by
people who like to interpret such vague terms broadly... another phrase
(dredged up from a truly ancient copy of Bartlett\'s Idiom, Colloquialisms &
Slang) to describe it might be "bouncing off the walls."

[player on]

	What\'s been happening?  Aside from a little side-talk with a few of
the other players I have yet to hear from anybody in the game.  True, I
haven\'t exactly been the most active player, but I\'ve sent three or four posts
in - and then in again... and then requests for confirmation of receipt, and
then...

	Rich, I can guess that you\'re busy enough with your own life, and that
the game must be generating one hell of a mail load for you to deal with, but
I\'ve been waiting a month or two on some of these;  even a simple "yes, I got
your mail;  I\'m REALLY busy and I\'ll get to you later." would provide a great
deal of reassurance.  Maybe you should set up a program to look through your
messages and send automatic short replies to each saying "It got here, I\'ll
get back to you." ?  

	Well, somebody let me know what\'s going on, eh?  (and yes, I WILL be
here for the summer, barring something odd, like lightning striking my
modem... or me :-)

It started when I expressed derision at DGP\'s statement that gauss weapons
are silent.  The consensus here seems to be, they\'re not.  There have been
a lot of messages from professional, informed and semi-informed sources (I
include myself among the third, so no offence intended).  To summarise:

1.  DGP are wrong.  Gauss weapons aren\'t silent.
2.  The only noise they do make is due to the needle going through the
    sound barrier.  They have no muzzle blast (or flash), and little or
    no mechanical sound.

So, detecting one is less difficult than detecting a CPR (Chemically
Propelled Round) weapon, but more difficult than detecting a CPR weapon
with a good silencer and flash eliminator.  Without any rules handy, here\'s
how I\'d define the task:

Detect fired weapon: Routine, uncertain.  DM\'s: INT, Tactics

For a gauss weapon, or CPR weapon with flash eliminator, change that "Routine"
to "Difficult".  For a fully suppressed CPR weapon, make it "Formidable".  The
flash eliminator in the "Difficult" case should really have limited sound
suppression as well, while "fully suppressed" means the round is subsonic too.
Ah, for good old Traveller, where I would impose specific DM\'s against the
detector for sound suppression, subsonic round, flash eliminator, and probably
the TL of the suppressor.

As for x-ray lasers; how much damage would they do, if they didn\'t get lucky
and hit bone?

an IR laser beam in the air of a lab. Looks like something out of a

invisible to metal detectors and explosives sniffers. And it has a

Before lots of you send corrections to the above, I\'ll correct myself.
Detecting a gauss weapon is more difficult than detecting a CPR weapon,
but less difficult than dtecting a CPR weapon with a good silencer and
flash eliminator.

That\'ll teach me to read the message properly before letting it out! :-!

I am currently playing a space conquest game that is running over the network,
one where each player plays a character/race type, you start out with a planet,
and proceed to develop it and explore and dominate the universe.  Meanwhile
there are ~40 other people doing the same thing.

The \'character\' I had choosen is Duke Norris; however I am now finding out that
I have large gaps in my knowledge of Duke Norris, like I can\'t even remember
the rest of his name.  I use the term \'character\' loosely because the game is
mainly strategy and tactics, not role playing.  The character playing is mainly
a name for the anonamous mailer alias, a style of writing in communicating with
other players and diplomacy, and pithy phrases to name your planets and ships.

Interesting, eh?

Basically what I\'m looking for is any information on Duke Norris, what he did
during the Fifth Frontier War, and what he\'s been up to in the disintegration
of the empire.

Hi folks! I\'ve been mucking about with the Traveller Mailing List
software.  More specifically, I\'ve physically moved the TML from its old
home (dadla.wr.tek.com, a VAX 11/780 running 4.3 Tahoe) to its new home
(metolius.wr.tek.com, the Sun Sparcstation 1 that sits at my desk).
This is an effort for me to abandon the old VAX for the speedy little
workstation, get all the archives on the local disk (instead of
overloading NFS whenever I build a new archive listing).

Note that you should now use metolius.wr.tek.com in place of
dadla.wr.tek.com for all TML mail.  Dadla should still work fine, but
all it does now is forward the requests on to metolius.  If you have
problems, please let me know at once, with as much detail as you can
provide (entire bounced messages if possible).

I would like the following TMLers to send me a reply ASAP, so I can
ensure that the software is working correctly:

	P.J.Netherwood@kingston.ac.uk (Paul Netherwood)
	bart@videovax.tv.tek.com (Bart Massey)

There were two problems with last night\'s digest.  One was that there

Both of these problems were my fault directly -- V4#6 didn\'t get sent
out at all, so I put everything back, fixed the bug in the digesting
program, and tried to resend the digest, expecting that all would be
well and that it would be numbered V4#6.  I had forgotten to clean up
the temporary message staging area (hence a second copy of all messages)
and reset the digest id (hence the jump from #5 to #7).

I do not expect these problems to recur, nor should the biweekly folks
see anything amiss.  Looks like the TML has pretty much successfully
moved.

Oh, one other administrivia point...  Somehow a stray message (was
listed in the archive index as number 1253, but actually was not stamped
with an Archive-Message-Number) got into the TML archives.  The
automatically-generated TML archive index (bundle 104) contains an extra

Corrin (who manages the TML FTP site) to fix his copy of the index, but
any of you who have a copy of the index I have sent since April 24th may
be in error.

In some instances, I believe using a laser would be very beneficial. I\'m
sure that X-Ray and IR lasers could do the job, if the targets aren\'t
prepared for it (ie using special vision enhancers like IR goggles). Also
I believe if you\'re in a patrol and it is set apon by a sniper, a good
commander will start ordering his men to start popping smoke grenades and
either rush the sniper or retrograde (in the military, we don\'t retreat).
Primarily, the smoke won\'t let the laser fire effectively on the targets,
plus it provides cover for the individuals. So, what\'s my answer to this ?

Lasers are cool, but people can prevent you from really hurting them. After
the commander pops a couple of smoke grenades, he doesn\'t really care if
anyone else sees the smoke because his position has already been compromised
and as Leonard Erickson stated in article 1282 :

" No intelligent sniper is going to use a weapon that draws a line
  connecting him with his target !! "

What I suggest doing is using some sort of shock weapon. In Viet Nam, Special
Force snipers (atleast some) would use .50 caliber rifles on enemy troops.
Now a .50 caliber will definatley blow you away, but what these S.F. guys
did was to use jet ammunition. These babies were armor piercing , explosive
rounds used against other planes. Now I suppose it\'s onething to see the
person crumple up and die from a laser wound, or maybe get knocked down or
head explode from a sniping rifle, but when your buddy gets hit by a .50
with AP EXP, there isn\'t much to send home. It\'ll demoralize the enemy !
Who wants to charge a sniper with a gun like that ?

Again, it\'s the choice of the sinper, using a silent weapon like a crossbow
is good, I wouldn\'t see much shock affect in it, plus if someone has
battle armor  * P-TING * goes the bolt but atleast you\'re not seen by
the enemy. Now .50 caliber, high shoch value, that will devastate a body.
If the target is using battle dress, instead of using a .50, graduate up
to a PGMP. It works for me. :-)

Zzzzap !

Wow, a laser got Chuck, good thing we wore these IR goggles, now we can
track where the blast came from. All units concentrate fire on that bush !

Yow, another sniper hit us, but where is he ? Next time he fires we\'ll
be ready with our handy dandy motion detector, and then, we\'ll show \'em !

Thunk !  *P-Ting*

Blam, kaboom, fizzle-sizzle

Holy Cow, look what happened to the sarge. He\'s missing his upper torso !
Where did it come from ? I don\'t know but next time he fires we\'ll know
and we\'ll get him. Everyone looks at each other with a face of fear, who
will be next to explode like the sarge ?

("Hehehehe" thinks the .50 caliber sniper "I really don\'t care if they
know where I am, their demoralized, and that\'s what counts, or is it
bodies that count !")

Anyways, I\'m sure there are many other ways for a sniper to be efficient,
please write about it, it\'ll be a learning experience.

It has been stated that the starport (downport) is essentialy foreign soil, 
and the local laws do not apply there. Therefore the highport would also
be under the same circumstances. And so (I would presume) be any ship at
the port or nearby.

The question arises, how many of the local laws are the port authorities
going to implement as "courtesies" to the locals. ie. They may pass
local regulations prohibiting gambling to appease the locals.

This is irrespective of tech level. If the planet is pre-stellar+, then
the local navy may have its own ideas about what is legal. I don\'t think
that the number of planetary diameters has anything to do with it. The
locals would claim their entire solar system, (and if you use WBH will
have colonies and spaceports (not starports) scattered all over the
system). Thus the navy may only see designated imperial property (ie.
starports) as being immune to local laws.

Another consideration is alienating merchants. Should said local navy
start harrassing merchants, boarding and checking for gambling, the
merchants may stop coming, and that could play havoc with their
economy.

In summary: It is a political situation and depending on the particular
law, the conviction of the locals, personalities (and orders) of the port 
authorities, and the opinon of merchant lines, a local law may be limited
to the planet, or extend throughout the system. 

Suprise your players, every world should be an unique experience, the
charts for the planet would describe all unusual legal conditions, if the
players bother to read the dozens of pages in detail. My players
rember worlds by their customs and laws, three nights in jail that a
player spent for GASP! not wearing a hat in public still sticks in their
mind.

Hello all.  I\'ve had an interesting idea floating around in my head for a
while that I\'d like to share with you.

I have a group that really wants to play Star Trek, the RPG.  Sigh, I
like Traveller better.  They are not interested in anything else, except
for D&D.  I\'m rather burned out on D&D right not so we are going to
play Traveller, err, Star Trek.  The Game is going to go sort of like
this...

Phase I Exploration:
	The players must locate a sutable class M planet for a 
	new colony.  During this phase they will encounter a
	number of strange items.  Marker beacons from unknown
	cultures, strange energy readings, and ships which vanish
	with a release of strange energy.  They are encountering
	IISS (Imperial Interstellar Scout Service) scouts.  The
	scouts are also noticing them...

Phase II Relocation:
	The players must supervise the relocation of the
	colonists to the new colony.  Focus in the interaction
	between the Starfleet crew and the colonists.  The
	colonists should be a pain to work with.  Some strange
	energy readings should be noted in the system as well as
	coded radio transmissions.  As the colony becomes
	settled, the player\'s starship will frequently be called
	away by Starfleet for some \'secret\' missions.  The
	colonists will be unhappy about the starship leaving the
	system.  They will complain loudly about the lack of
	protection.  During one of the first few times that the
	player\'s ship is not in the system, a few of the
	colonists will vanish with out a trace.  In reality, the
	missing colonists have been kidnapped by IISS agents who
	want to find out about about a new culture.  The last
	time that the players leave the colony things happen.
	The players will return just in time for Phase III...

Phase III Contact:
	The players return to find the colony a smoking ruin.  A
	landing party (all of the players must be in the landing 
	party) is sent down.  The colony has been stripped of all
	computer and communications equipment.  Quite a few
	colonists are dead, they appear to have been killed in
	the defense of the colony.  They were killed with energy
	weapons *and* projectal weapons.  All of the remaining
	colonists are missing.  Well, all but one.  S/he managed
	to hide when the aliens attacked.  So s/he claims.  The
	surviving \'colonists\' is in reality a Zhodani spy (enemy
	of the Imperium.)  The spy is on the planet for reasons
	of his/her own.  While the players are exploring the
	ruins, their ship will be attacked and destroyed.  The
	players will shortly afterwards be captured.

Phase IV Capture:
	The landing party is captured by humanoids is combat
	armor.  If the players resist an NPC will be killed.  The
	party will be loaded onto a shuttle and transported to a
	ship in orbit.  The ship is *big*, the players will be
	able to estimate that it is about 3 km in length.  It is
	bristling with weapon turrets.  It has a logo painted on
	one side that none of the player\'s reconize.  The party
	will be locked into a cargo bay.  Food will be available
	in the cargo bay.  The players will be ignored for two
	months.  Every so often there will be sounds of battle
	during this time.  After the two months have passed, the
	players will be transfered to another ship\'s cargo bay.  
	The players will be questioned indivually at this time.
	They will have chances to escape.  If they do not manage
	to escape, eventually the ship they are in will be
	attacked (there is a war on you know...) and disabled.
	When the players escape Phase V starts.

Phase V The Voyage Home:
	Questions the players will need to find the answers to.
	1) How operational is this ship?
	2) How can we repair this ship?
	3) Where are we?
	4) What information can we gather?
	5) Where is home?
	They may come up with other questions.  The answer to
	number 5 may not be able to be determined.  Allow them to
	explore the Traveller universe.

Overview:
	Outlaws with lots of technical knowledge and a stolen
	starship on the run from an EVIL, RUTHLESS galactic empire.
	Sounds like "Blake\'s 7" to me...

Comments, suggestions?  E-mail me or Call by phone.  If you use
the idea, let me know how it went...

Now for why the adventure will bu such fun to run...
	In Traveller starships move from star to star.  They 
ignore the space between stars.  A sphere of influence consists 
of many points which are controled.  Only the points are 
important.  How many adventures have you seen where the Bad 
Guys (tm) have set up a base at a specific jump point where there 
is not a star?
	In Star Trek Areas are controled.  A few major bases are
occupied; however, for the most part space lanes are patroled,
not each star.
	This leads to some interesting possibilities.
	Two empires overlapping and exploring the same space while 
not knowing that the other is there.
	Some of you Trek people might wonder how the Federation 
starship was suprised.  My answer, suprise and a spinal mounted 
meson gun owned by a shoot first, shoot again, then ask questions 
later culture.
	In my Traveller universe, the Imperium is not controled
by nice people.  Don\'t attract their attention and you are okay.
They are not interested in anything that is small.  If you are
interested in overthrowing a local planetary government, be sure
to purchase the proper permits. :-)

Two things:

1. I\'m going to put together an article for Travellers\' Digest (something
to do when I go back to Tennessee in three weeks, ugh) on insult, invective,
and humor among the major races in the MegaTraveller universe. The only data
on these areas is a brief article in JTAS#9 on what to call a Zhodani or a
Vargr ("gral"? Puh-LEASE!) when you want to be nasty, and a sidesplittingly
funny comic called "Our Friends the Aliens" from JTAS 14 or so... its caption
reads something like, "Many people think the Hivers have no such things as 
jokes, since they can\'t talk. Nothing could be further from the truth, as this
hilarious example demonstrates...." The cartoon that follows depicts a Hiver
gesturing to another, followed by the other Hiver reacting. No dialog or 
translations provided. |->

2. I\'m quitting TML as of today, for a period of about three weeks. I\'m getting
married on Sunday, May 20, and I\'ll be back from my honeymoon (and back in Oak
Ridge, alas) soon after Labor Day. I\'ll see you all then, all right?

Take care,

I know, I know, I know.... "here he goes again!"

I was once again trying to design a ship under the new MT design
rules.  This time, (I thought) something simple.  A 20T (OT)
fighter.

Under High Guard, this ship had a power plant with a rating of 12
and needed 12% of the ship\'s volume for fuel, or 2.4T.  This
roughly equates to 32.4 KL under the MT rules.  The fighter I am
designing is to have a 6G manueverability rating.  When I tried to
calculate the size power plant to accomplish this deed I came up
with the following figures:



          Item                Units           Volume            Wt
       Manuever 6              3.4             45.9             119
       Power Plant            80                7.2             160


I arrived at the power plant figure by determining that the
manuever drive would need 238 power units as input power for their
survival.  I doubled that figure in the interest of maintaining
excess power for agility.  SO far so good, but now comes the fuel 
calculations:

80 power plant units use 0.009 KL of fuel per hour.  I calculate a
30 day supply as 30 X 24 X 0.009 X 80 as 518.4 KL.  Not much, but
the whole vessel only has a volume of 270KL!  

What am I doing wrong?   What kinds of guidelines do other folks
use in this instance?

Boy I miss High Guard!

	Just a quick thought -
	A visible laser, operating on one frequency (which is, I
	understand, what they normally do), can have it\'s effect
	diminished by wearing clothes/armour that reflect that
	frequency light (i.e. a green-light laser\'s effect will
	be much less on green objects, because colour is, after
	all, a radiating of light of a specific frequency ...)
	So how about a universal laser armour that reflects low-
	power lasers ? It could be any colour on the outside (to
	prevent human detection) but a "super-white" colour underneath.
		-- I seem to remember coloured armour in the
		   remarkably light-hearted Paranoia game ...
	The right sort of "super-white" would be effective against
	all lasers near the visible spectrum, but whould have to be
	made of lead to stop X-ray lasers ...

	PS - All London, England, phone numbers have been subject to
	a badly thought out, heavy-handed alteration by British Telecom.
	Central London numbers now begin with 071 instead of 01, and
	outer London numbers are 081 instead of 01. So if you\'re dialling
	over here, be prepared for the changes !
	This has also introduced a certain amount of snobbery and
	is predicted to alter some house prices - the yuppier members
	of society couldn\'t live with an 081 number in case their
	friends thought that they "lived out in the provinces".

	What about area snobbery on some worlds for a strange custom?
	Like if the players take some local accomodation, some people
	will refuse to talk to them when they discover which section
	of town they\'re living in ... ?

	Just another couple of thoughts to keep the discussions going !

What are you doing wrong? First you are not reading the power plant
chart correctly, and second, you are not designing the ship
for its intended use. 

I\'ll address the second one first. The fighter, without staterooms
(as the OT fighters, and any 20T fighter would be designed), cannot
support a pliot for 24 hours, never mind 30 days. Only use the fuel
storage that is required. I typically use 3-10 days for fighters.
(actually I typically put small staterooms in fighters (50T+) and
have them stay on station for several weeks).

The first part: I deduce from your design that the fighter is Tech 15
(this is the only TL case in high guard where the power plant rating, 
and PP volume are  identical).
You indicate you want 2x238 for the Power plant (to include agility),
noting at this point a laser (250Mw) cannot be installed - Missiles only.
(This doubling is a good starting estimate, but will have to be
revised after the ship is sketched out, as agility is a function of mass).

So 476 Mw of power, do not require 80Kl (units) of TL 15 power plant. You
forgot to account for scale efficiencies. Any PP over 14Kl, gets triple 
effieincy. ie. 18 Mw per "unit" of power plant. Thus you plant can be 
26.44Kl (round to 27, which gives 10Mw to power life support, computers, etc.)

(This is the problem with A-M power plants, as they don\'t get scale
efficiency, fusion power plants are quite often better at the higher techs)

Thus your fuel for 30days is .009*27*24*30= 175Kl within your volume
requirements, if you only go for 10 days this becomes just 59 Kl.

P.S. I am still	working on a C starship design package. (With Paul Dale, and
Jo Jaquinta) We are (essentailly) out of the design phase, and have
started coding.

	Trying again - very brave :-)  Two problems with the design.
First - scale efficiency (from the same page as the powerplants, near
the bottom) will triple the output of any powerplant 14 kl or larger, giving
a total output of 18 Mw per kl of powerplant (assuming TL15).  Another
way of looking at it is that any TL15 power plant providing more than
252 Mw of power will have a size of Output/18.  This mistake has been
made by so many people (including whoever designed the fighter in the
Rebellion Sourcebook!) that I think they should either reformat the table
of powerplants or at least put asterisks by the numbers in the "Power Out"
column to refer people to the scale efficiency table.  Note that this does
not increase fuel usage, so this will reduce the fuel used in your fighter
by 2/3, as well as freeing up space formerly used by the plant.
	Second - the "30-day fuel supply" is a suggestion, not a
requirement, and I believe was meant to primarily apply to starships.
The fighter in the Rebellion book had a 5 day supply, and the one in
Fighting Ships even less.  It is also possible to run a powerplant at less
than full capacity, saving fuel.  Thus you could build a ship that has a
30-day supply of fuel for manuvering and life support, but only 3 days
for the weapons and agility. (I don\'t think many ships will fight more
than 3 full days before refuelling - especially not a fighter with no jump
drive.)

>Boy I miss High Guard!
Me too. :-)
	I hope this helps. Good luck.

Ship Status
Ship Name: Tachyon
Ship Type: Interceptor
Owning World or Nation: North America
Ship Purpose: The Tachyon class interceptor was designed as a
vessel with the ability to combat enemy ships at a moments notice 
from on world bases. The ship is mostly power plant, thrusters 
and drives which makes it very fast, and very difficult to hit or 
track. The armament is impressive, consisting of 4 Hyde lasers 
in single mounts around the ship. After take-off, the vessel has 
about 6 hours of use in which to combat enemy vessels. It is also 
good for close system escorts and as express boats for important 
documents or items. With advent of the Kafer Invasion, the 
Tachyon has seen much action as aretaliation vessel versus the 
Kafers when liners, merchants, as well as militarty vessels are 
under attack . The unfortunate drawback is the ship\'s limited range. 
Fortunately enough, if the victim is within the ship\'s range, the
ship is sure to arrive very quickly.

Ship Status:
Ship Name: Wenton Class
Ship Type: Dropship
Owning Nation or World: North America
Ship\'s Purpose: The Wenton Class Dropship was designed 
for the purpose of creating a craft that would be able to drop 
troopers behind enemy lines or for boarding actions, and to 
deploy troopers throughout the colonies as a fast reaction 
vessel. The ship is lightly armed and is not even armored. 
This ship has seen most action after a battle has ensued where 
boarding parties are needed to detain free floating ships with 
hostile crew. The ship is also very fast which keeps it out of 
trouble, and makes it an excellent blockade runner, or when 
troops have to be sent to a specific hot spot in a hurry, covertly 
or otherwise.

It\'s not quite that simple.  Any color can be represented as a combination
of spectral frequencies.  Because human vision relies on three distinct
color photoreceptors, it\'s possible for two colors to look the same while
having different spectra.  So unless you know which frequency you wish to
reflect, caveat emptor.

I\'ve always wondered how effective a reflective, mylar-like layer underneath
a dress uniform would be.

That\'s what reflec armor is, in MegaTraveller.  A thin, super-reflective

Since I posted this response, I\'ve finished converting the man-portable
energy weapons, the grenades, and the grenade launchers.  The entire
document is about 9 pages long.  The down side to this system is that 
it requres one or two 10-sided dice in addition to the standard D6\'s,
it doesn\'t use the standard MT task format for everything, and it is
incomplete without the combat tables from Cyberpunks Friday Night Fire
Fight.  However, the combat is fast and deadly.  This is how it should
be.  Speaking as an ex-marine, I can state catagorically that no one in
their right mind WANTS to be shot at, and this system certainly reinforces
that frame of mind.

I\'d like to see a list of minor races, too.  If there isn\'t one already
available, I\'ll volunteer to wade through my collection of Traveller
literature and compile one.  As a matter of fact, being a devoted xenophile
I was already considering such a project even before the subject was raised.
 
My Traveller collection is quite extensive, though not entirely complete.
I think the best idea is for me to start off by posting a first draft of
the list, and then inviting everyone to send me additions and corrections
to cover any material that I don\'t have, after which I will post a revised
version.
 
Before I start, let me ask for some opinions about what people want to see:
 
1. Content.  Do you want me to include races that have featured in "approved"
   products, e.g. those published by FASA or Paranoia Press?
 
2. Format.  What information should the list have in it?  IMHO, I think
   it would be best to keep it brief so that each record can fit on an

were all drafted (they claimed kidnapped) into the Scout service under some
obscure rule and we have spend the last three months playing out the six
week basic training. Anyway...
	Jump takes a week. A ship usually dieters around for up to another
week and jumps again. So about half a full-time spacefarer\'s life is spent
in jump. Jump is boring. I mean, you can\'t even look out the windows. Great
if you\'re travelling a high-tech luxary liner with holo-vision (tm) 
entertainment &c but your average Subsidised Merchant or Scout is just a bare
TL9 (?). Entertainment facilities = pack of cards.
	So what do your characters do to entertain themselves in jump? Most
referees I imagine just skip over jump declaiming you character spends the
time reading an improving book. But how a character spends its recreation
time says a lot about a character. There\'s only so much maintenence you can
do to a starship.
	In my group there was eight of them packed onto an elderly scout ship.
In theory a scout ship (Snapshot plan) can take eight. But we all know about
the life support. Being different nationalities, religions and being cooped
up in a ship where half the available room was taken up with "cargo" and the
smell getting worse does not lead to domestic peace. In fact is was probably
their unifying hatred of their draft officer/captor that kept them coming to
blows.
	Their relief from boredrum involved constructing a complicated game.
They locked the door between the corridor and the day room open and welded
a ramp over the lintel. Then one person would get into a shopping cart (one
of their few momentos from their home planet) and starting at the bridge
another would push them full speed up the corridor and onto the ramp. The 
trick then was for the passenger/payload to leap from the cart, pass above
the table welded to the floor and below the pipe running across the ceiling
and land on the other side before crashing into the engineering door. Points
were scored for sucess, style, and finesse.
	I\'m not sure I\'ll ever understand how the TL4 imagination works.

	Fighting Ships of the Imperium... Overview.


Biggest ripoff in GDW history. Proofreading is miserable and the ships 
do not follow any of the rules in the book. Battleships are built at TLs
where the max comp does not have the CPs to control them. Armor is plated
in excess of all rules to the point of making the ships TOTALLY impervious
to damage. By Totally I mean you need a die roll of 15+ straight witha spinal\'
mount on 2D6 to do damage!

Somebody appears to have gone Spreadsheet crazy on the ships as designs are
almost identical. Other flaws abound . No launch tubes for any ship even
though they are carrying 300+ fighters. Launch 1 fighter per turn.......

In my opinion save the $10.00 and build your own ships.

I was not impressed by it.  One big bug (or feature; it may have been intended)
is that most of the designs ignore the TL restrictions on armor - the
battleships
have armor between 100 and 120.  If this is permitted, it is not neccesarily
a bad idea, since it makes the ships virtually invulnerable to everything
except meson guns.  Another problem is that some of the ships have PA\'s
as spinal mounts. There is no excuse for this, since many of the ships
have armor that would make such weapons completely useless.  The one
design I liked was the 20 ton fighter with agility 6 and a type 9 computer -
it has a Def DM of 17.  The text on the organization and history of the
Imperial Navy may or may not be useful to you.
In short, don\'t buy it before taking a close look to see if it is worth it
to you.

I have at least one phenomenal example of a great means for a party to keep
itself occupied and happy during Jumps...Near Miss, the party featured in 
my story and adventure-module series at GenCons from 1984 to 1989, is a 
professional music/stage group, and spends its entire Jump period writing
material ("Hey, Cap\'n, what rhymes with \'blowtorch\'?"), researching old
remnants of ancient music for rearrangements ("I am having difficulty 
translating \'Whop-bop-a-loo-bop A-whop-bam-boom\'...."), practicing ("Of
COURSE I can play it right...Give me a month, okay?"), designing new sets
and stage effects ("...and then there\'s this massive explosion and stage 
blood starts pouring out of everyone\'s clothes, and--no? Why not?"), and 
so on. I should also pont out, in more general terms, that keeping one\'s
skills honed requires a great deal of practice, and Jump is an ideal time
to do so. So one would expect martial arts classes, exercise periods, 
marksmanship training, fencing, simulated combat runs, and so on, in
profusion. But a common hobby for the entire party, preferably one that
is time-consuming and cooperative, is a big plus. As has been drawn in 
many Traveller rulebooks by artists looking for an easy joke, why not
play Traveller? Have a game being played by the characters, within the
game the players are playing....ooh, bad karma....what an idea....

Excuse me, folx, I have to get writing...I just had a great idea for 
an RPG campaign.....("No, you can\'t run that character the way YOU\'D
run him, you have to run it the way your CHARACTER would run him!")

Actually a spinal meson gun will get through, and the big ships don\'t have
decent meson screens.  In fact one of the cruisers has a better chance of
survival than a dreadnaught because it has a decent meson screen.  I did
look at cruiser vs dreadnaught and came to the conclusion that mutual
destruction is the expected result (it was the cruiser with the spinal meson
gun vs the TL15 dreadnaught).

As an aside:
	The most powerful ship in the book is probably the experimental
	battleship carrying 3 battle riders.  4 Meson gun-T\'s packed in there!!

Hows about the tankers (I think) with more fuel tankage than available space?
Also many of the designs have more heads up displays than crew members!
(how do you try to rationalise that one???)

I agree.

I don\'t wish to seem ungrateful, but I can\'t help noticing that
Marc Miller\'s list of minor races is hopelessly out of date.
For example, there are no entries for anything in the Travellers
Digest after issue 9.
 
There was also nothing from the Beyond or Vanguard Reaches.
Does this mean that GDW has disowned the Paranioa Press books?

Hey gang,

Well, after getting everybody\'s mail this morning and discovering that
nobody else had heard from Richard either, I started to get worried.
So I called Oregon Software to see if a) he was OK, or b) I needed to
send roses somewhere.  (Hey, I\'m a \'journalist\', right?  After all,
Mike Wallace (\'60 MINUTES\') bothers people at work all the time. :-))

Fortunately (for all of us), the correct answer is (a).  I talked to
Richard for about 5 minutes.  He\'s fine, but he\'s been incredibly
busy.  Also, he was without E-Mail for about 2 weeks, plus agora has
been kind of flaky for a while.  So he\'s missed a lot of what\'s been
passing between us since (I guess, not his) about the beginning of
May.

We should be hearing from him in the next few days, so, DON\'T TOUCH
THAT DIAL!!!

    'body' => 'Hi,

I was reading in an old copy of Scientific American about a computer
program called Eurisko. I\'m not too sure how it worked, but I think it\'s
given a set of "axioms and premises" and uses some general heuristics to
derive things from them. For example, given basic theory, derives concepts
and theorems about primes, etc, etc.

One year the author of the program actually put it to a useful purpose.  He 
entered it in Origin\'s TCS tourney :-) It either won (or came close) using
ship and fleet designs which were laughed at by human opponents (initially
anyway). Apparently, it used *lots* of small agile ships (fighters?).
Unfortunately, thats all I know about. Can anyone expand on this?
Did anyone play against Eurisko?!

Anyone have the parameters used for the tourneys? (I know the TCS supp has some
to about \'82, \'83 I think) Even better would be winning fleet designs
from the various years. I don\'t think they were ever published in the 
JTAS, though there were  a few articles about ship design and TCS in
general. Are they available anywhere?

Thanks,
Eric.

One of our PC ships was top-heavy with characters with computer skill.
Two of them have formed a VideoGames company (whose offices are the cabin
next to the engineering deck, with a branch office in the Captain\'s
Stateroom) for which they moonlight during jump and while the /s/l/e/a/z/e/
Trade Officer is selling more tangible goods on planets.  The royalties
from Metal-Munching-Mice are begining to be substantial.  The games tend
to be semi-autobiographical, recounting our run-ins with various 
exobiological oddities and 1st Empire security robots -- as well as cross-
fertilizing the cultures and video-games of a hundred worlds.

In the Gazoid 8ight-Worlds universe (and Blacow\'s subsidiary The Scarp),
a "special effect" of Jump travel is group-hallucination from the collective
unconcious if you look out the viewports.
      So the GM always tells us what hyperspace looks like this
time.  Rumor has it that no one has ever lived to see the Coyote catch
the Road-Runner and tell about it; and that seeing these mythic characters
in hyperspace is a sure sign your jumper is sick.

Some PCs stock up on back issues of Astrogator Today, Space Bimbos, or 
whatever at each port of call.

The ground-pounders on one ship built a still in one cabin to provide in-
flight entertainment.

A fairly even mix of sexes in the crew can provide fertile ground for
in-flight intra-party role-play.  (one no-skill Corporal Good-Body has
seriously endangered his job by moving out of the cabin of the (female)
Head of Ground-poudners; he didn\'t realize he\'d been hired *only* as
a boy-toy for Major Lollita.  Lucky for him, we\'re too far beyond the 
pale to dump him at next landfall, so she\'s stuck with a useless gunsel
on the payroll for a while.  Meanwhile, she and her Sargeant Major are
busy training the raw-recruit Catperson-Sepoi we hired at a barberous
colony planet.)

If the PCs pick up pets on various planets, all sorts of things can 
happen in between exciting events.

Need I continue?

WOuld the Gazoid one care to elaborate, if he\'s still on this mailing
list?

	I\'m cobbling together a little article on Zhodani & psionics in 
Traveller.  So far I\'m doing fine - I have the original psionics rules,
which haven\'t changed appreciably in the Megatraveller rules, and I\'m 
tapping away at the keyboard.  What I need, though, is some more information
on the Zhodani themselves.  Although I could certainly use any suggestions
anybody wants to post/send about psionics & ideas for zhodani, etc.

	I used to have a copy of the Zhodani Alien module, won it as 
second prize in a tournament somewhere.  Naturally, at the time I didn\'t
play traveller over-much, and what I did play never had anything to do 
with the Zhodani.  Also naturally, when the subject finally came up a
few years later, the module was nowhere to be scene (I\'m talking about the
new line of alien modules, not the Zhodani adventure).  Equally, it seems
to be very hard to find in the stores.  So if anybody is willing to offer
me an old copy, I\'d love to hear from \'em.  Or, if anybody is willing to
photocopy the pertinent parts, let me know. 

	I\'d also appreciate pointers to Zhodani referencess in the various
\'zines and adventures, or summaries of important details.  Mainly interested
in dates & names and that sort of stuff.  For example, a recent Space Gamer
has a traveller adventure called "The Possession Ball, about a small crystal
sphere that... well, never mind.  The point is that I\'m going to try to work
the basic information and the date & place into the article for some "GDW
Continuity" :-)  So any references would help.  I might also be interested
in tracking down articles that could be useful.

	So how about it out there?  Can you give me a hand?  Or at least
some suggestions or questions you think might be interesting in an article
on Traveller Psionics?

|* How much would one have to pay for employing a mercinary unit over a
|* long or short periode. What would it be for a Special Force Commando
|* Group what would a "nice price" be, single assignment or many.

The gating criteria here is:

	1) What size unit?
	2) Equipped to what TL?
	3) How much support does their employer intend to supply?
	4) What is the mission?
	
... and not necessarily in the order of priority.   Also, is this
a success only ticket?

A merc unit that one of my players (the unit has since become a
corporation and are used as NPC\'s in my campaigns) was involved in
actually performed a ticket for "free".  A merchant concern got
tired of its ships being hijacked by a band of pirates.  Since
they (the merchants) knew where they (the pirates) were, they were
quite miffed when the Imperial Navy wouldn\'t supply any forces to
crush the pirates.  Enter Armageddon Industries, a merc unit that
was definitely making a name for themselves.  The deal struck? 

Armageddon Industries supplied a company sized assault force.  The
merchant company would supply ships as needed to transport and
land the force at the pirate\'s base (a large moon orbiting a gas
giant) as well as provide transport for the extraction.
Armageddon Industries would be allowed to "capture" as much booty
as they could find at the pirate base as well as being entitled to
any reward monies as would be paid by Imperial authorities for the
capture of said pirates.   It turned out to be very profitable for
the mercs.

It\'s generally easiest to look at Mercenary prices from the enconomic viewpoint.
Estimate the length of the ticket and the size and equipment level of the 
unit that will be hired.  Figure out what it\'s payroll will be for the length
of the contract (about Cr 325 per person in the unit).  Add maintenance costs
on it\'s equipment ( 10% of purchace price per year; divide by portion of year
the ticket lasts for, minimum 3% ).  Add any specific costs that will be 
required by the ticket.  Total, and multiply by 1.25.  This is the Basic
Mission Cost; the estimate, plus margins for unexpected variable costs.  
Since this is a commercial activity (in addition to a military one...) you
have to allow a profit margin.  Mercenary tickets should use a Profit Margin
Multiplier of 1.3 [safe simple mission] to 1.5 [average] to an extreme of 
2.0 [success-only and difficult ticket].  

For instance, let\'s hire a Platoon sized infantry unit as a Striker unit for
a classic Blitzkrieg.  It\'s estimated to last for one month; just to be safe,
the ticket was written for two, with an extension for two more in case of
lasting hostilities at the same cost.
	The unit size, including some support personell and headquarters, is
fifty five people.  Equipped as medium infantry, with Gauss rifles, equipment
runs about Cr 2000 per person.  The payroll is (Cr325 x 2months x 55 personel)
or Cr35750.  Equipment costs are (Cr2000 x 55 x 0.03 (min. maint. costs) ) or
Cr3300.  The total cost is then (1.25 x (Cr3300 + Cr35750)) or Cr48,800.
Given that this is a more or less \'average\' mission, this should be 
multiplied by 1.5, for a total ticket of roughly Cr75,000 for the two-month
mission.  Of course, if you had to have the unit imported from an off-planet
location, you\'d have to include travel costs of about Cr110,000 per jump...
[and you wonder why local mercenary units are so popular 8-) ! ]

The troops get paid in two ways.  First, they get monthly salaries like
anyone else.  Second, they get shares of the final profit from a mission,
once expenses and salaries have been taken out of the payment.  Higher
ranking members of the unit get more shares.

The standard salaries and shares for the troops, given in Ye Olde Booke 4,
"Mercenary", are as follows:

Rank				Salary		Shares
- ---- 				----		----
Private				300		1
Lance Corporal			400		2
Corporal			450		3
Lance Sergeant			500		3
Sergeant			550		4
Gunnery Sergeant		600		4
Leading Sergeant		700		5
First Sergeant			800		6
Sergeant Major			1000		7
Second Lieutenant		1000		5
First Lieutenant		1200		6
Captain				1400		7
Major				1600		8
Lt. Colonel			1800		9
Colonel				2000		10

Before shares are determined, the ticket holder (usually the unit commander
and his business partners) deduct 50% of the payment as profit.

Salaries of deceased members go to the next of kin or designated recipient.
Shares go only to surviving members.

These are the standard payments.  It is up to the employer and the mercenary
commander to negotiate higher rates for such things as a particularly skilled
unit, a particularly tough job, etc.  The contract may give a fixed sum, which
the unit can divide up how it likes, or it may specify standard salaries, or
double salaries, etc.  If the total payment doesn\'t cover all the salaries,
the mercenaries may get angry.  Getting mercenaries angry is probably another
candidate for Mike Metlay\'s old list of How To Die Young. :-)

            aging rolls back, I would probably increase the lifespan also.
            Comments?

2. Timeline:  I am not sure where I want to start my players WRT the
            rebellion.  I could start them before, say about 1100, right
            around the event, or somewhat after, say 1140 or so.  What have the
            rest of you done as far as the timeline is concerned?

3.  Place:  I am thinking of starting my players in either Zarushagar or

The posting of estimating costs for mercenary tickets forgot simple things
like operational costs for the unit...ammo, food, etc.  In the example I gave,
presumeable the supporting nation would provide all that, so it ought to be
accurate.  However, if the mercenaries need to provide their own supplies, then
add Cr10 per person per day in food, and ammo costs (heavy combat, assume one
full load of ammo per person per day).  This is added in the initial costs
section, along with the payroll and maintenance costs.

Make sure you have your ducks in a row.  Not knowing your players, I can\'t
predict how they will take to Traveller.  In our group, I am the only one who
has played other games than AD&D.  Most people are reluctant to learn a new
game system and it can be real hard to convince them that there are fun other
games.  The biggest problem here to watch out for is the reward system.  In
AD&D you get Gold, Magic, and Experience.  As you progress you get more hit
points.  Many AD&D people can\'t understand or accept the fact that your hit
points never go up, but maybe down.  They don\'t understand that you are
beginning adventuring experienced and now it is for fun.  You can\'t always use
techno-junk for magic because most of the techno-junk is purchasable somewhere.
This usually pushes the AD&D ref to use money as the main treasure.  You have
to get the players out of the "do go, get rewarded" mind set and make them
adventure just to have something to do after retiring.   It is probably the
hardest thing about Traveller.

No RPG\'s rules are fixed.  Do what you think is rational.  If your universe has
longer lifespans then so be it.  From an actual "History of the Imperium" stand
point there was a long period of non-tech growth.  It is reasonable to assume
that medical sciences haven\'t progressed that far.  Anagatheics are expensive,
adictive and a real pain if you miss a dose.

As far as the rule goes, it is there to force the players to cut character
generation off at an early age.  If you allow them to stay in service until
they are 60 then you will have a boat full of Admirals and Generals with
Gun-10, Pilot-10, Computer-10 and so on.  Also as humans go, with the exception
of a few, Speed, Agility, Strength, and Endurance start dropping at around
25-30.  Now your athletes and those who workout more often are near the top end
of the scale.  So 38 is a bit of improvement over todays norms.  Like I said,
do what you want, you are the ref, but there is some more food for though.
Also, one other thing, if your players have played Traveller before, then they
are used to the rules as they are and you may not want to go make changes.

I have in the past tried to stay in sync with the Journal of the Traveller\'s
Aid Society (now Challenge).  1100 is about the time of the 5th frontier war
(near the end if memory serves).  If you are running a merchant campaign then
the post war-pre rebellion period would be more sutiable since the economy is
somewhat stable.  If it is going to be strong military then run it during the
war or the rebellion.  Your choice.  One thing to consider is where you are.  I
am not sure where those sectors are, but it takes a few years from the
assassination of Strephon to the break up to hit the Spinward Marches.

The Official sector data is located on the pay service GEnie.  There are no
maps, but the UWP codes and stuff is there.

of Sunbane\'s sys. admin (Thanks Dan!), I\'ve managed to get all of the
Imperial Sector UWPs that were available on the GEnie network put in
the TML Archive.  If you look in ~ftp/pub/traveller/sectors, you\'ll see
compressed data files for the following sectors:

   Alpha Crucis   Delphi         Gushemege      Reft Sector      Verge 
   Antares        Deneb          Hinterworlds   RiftSpan Reach   Vland

   Dagudashaag    Fornast        Massilia       Spinward Marches
   Daibei         Glimmerdrift   Old Expanses   Trojan Reach

There is also a pair of programs in a single Tar file (ssv.tar.Z) in the
same directory.  The first program is section.c.  By filtering each of
the sector UWP files thru it, 16 subsector output files will be produced
(labelled sec_A thru sec_P).  The second program is ssv.c.  This X-Windows
based program allows you to view the subsector graphically in a high-res
window on your UN*X, allows you to add political/cultural/military borders
interactively, and allows you to print the modified subsector to an XImage
file (ssv.xwd) which is suitable for output to a laser printer (via the
MIT xpr utility).  Both programs are written in C, and should run on
standard AT&T SysV UN*X.

Even if you don\'t have access to a UN*X platform, at least the sector
UWP files should prove useful.

As to the legality of disseminating these files, I got explicit permission
from Joe Fugate (of DGP) to make these files available to the TML.  Since
he originally posted them to the GEnie Traveller library archives, he has
final authority over their disposition and he said, "No problem" (in so
many words :-)).

One final note.  With the exception of (I think) 3 files (Deneb, Corridor,
and Massilia), all the data in these files is pre-shattered-Imperium.
This means that most of the allegiance codes will be wrong.  Also, with
the exception of the 3 aforementioned files, most system names are absent.
Only \'Hi Pop\' systems are named in the other 23 sector files.

Well, that\'s it.  Here\'s all the data.  Go nuts!

On aging: this is one of my big gripes with the Traveller character
system, one only partially addressed by DGP in the Vilani\'n\'Vargr Ahoy!
book. The question isn\'t one of macroscale ("3000 years in the future"
don\'t mean diddly if society\'s collapsed for most of that time), but
of microscale (on Skivgik, you\'re lucky if you reach 35, but on Gloomph
if you die at 150 they bury you in a cradle). The trick isn\'t time 
passage but PERCEIVED time passage, i.e. technological advancement and
quality of lifestyle. I think the GDW folx did a global average of tech
levels for the Marches and used that to ballpark the aging stuff; when
more very-hi-tech worlds come into the equation the average age of a 
character should go up a lot with respect to "aging" thresholds. So I\'m
considering a sliding scale based on tech level of birth, childhood etc.
(But this utterly ignores the primary reason for aging: killing off or
crippling characters that are getting too powerful. I\'m getting soft in
my old age; I let people like Dow (hi Dow) run characters in their 40s.
In my cruel youth I never let anyone get past 34 and stay in the service;
it kept their skills and cash manageable.)

Timelines: Again, you\'re thinking of macroscale vs. microscale. The years
from 1100 to 1140 are a drop in the bucket w/r/t the history of Humaniti
(and a bare sneeze to Yaskoydray, wherever the hey HE is these days), but
on a character\'s level they constitute a huge timespan with a ton of good
history (including two wars, the Fifth Frontier War and the Rebellion) to
choose from. If you choose any time before 1117, you\'re not IN the MegaTrav
universe; you\'re in Trav Classic, with its VERY different assumptions of
how the Universe works. (And, I might add, the appropriate differences in
many of the rules. I\'d hate to put a standard TravClassic character from
anywhere other than the Marches up against a well-hardened MegaTrav character.)
If you go as late as 1140, you\'ll be making it up as you go along, because
only the GDW and DGP crystal ball gazers know what\'s beyond 1121 at this point
(with one VITAL exception: the GDW game writers made a very big slip in the
MegaTrav rule books, one that gives away an important piece of future
history that\'s obvious once you know what to look for. But I won\'t tell. |-> ).
I\'d advise sticking to the years right after the Rebellion\'s peak (1119 to
1120 to start with); the most material is available for that period.

Sectors: Talk to Mark Cook. Both sectors you\'ve named have been fully
mapped with full UWPs for all systems.

The 4th Frontier War ended in 1092 (I think; I\'m not sure on this one).
The 5th Frontier War started in 1105 (I am sure of this one).
The 5th Frontier War ended in 1111.
Strephon was assassinated in 1116.

So, around 1100 they can still be playing a post-war scenario, or a run-up to
5th Frontier War scenario.  From 1105 to 1111 is fireworks time.  After 1111
is another post-war scenario.  From 1116 until news of the assassination
reaches your part of the universe is relatively quiet.  From that time on,
it\'s The End Of Civilisation As We Know It.

While we\'re on the subject of minor races, here\'s something to think about:
 
In issue #14 of the JTAS, the Darrians were described as averaging 1.6m tall.
 
In Alien Module 8 they are 2.0m tall.  They also seem to have acquired
sharply pointed ears.
 
There is only one logical conclusion that can be drawn from these
observations:  SOMEONE HAS BEEN STRETCHING THE DARRIANS BY THE EARS.

the secret of the Star Trigger, and quake in fear at the prospect of the
dreaded Ear Stretcher. *gulp*

Here is the revised Minor Races List.  I managed to unearth about 30 new
races that weren\'t on the Miller list.  Admittedly, a few of them are
extinct, but then Miller did include the Loeskalth in his own list.
 
If anyone can supply additions or corrections I would be pleased to hear
from you.
 
(H) after a name indicates a human race.
(E) after a name indicates an extinct race.

That is, from my point of view, even better, since the (hopefully) updated ones
is said to come out some time this year.
I\'ll give these files to the playes and keep the updated ones for myself :-)

I apologize for being so busy lately.  When one automates a mailing list
to the extent I have, it is easy to ignore it for a while.

There are three ways to get archives:

FTP Archive Site:
	All the Traveller Archives (filled Bundles and Packages) are
	available via ftp from sunbane.engrg.uwo.ca (129.100.4.12).
	A sample session follows (lines that a user would type on
	are marked with a "*", and commentary begins with a "#"):

    *	shell> ftp 129.100.4.12		#begin the ftp session
	Connected to 129.100.4.12.
	220 sunbane FTP server (SunOS 4.0) ready.
    *	Name (129.100.4.12:dan):anonymous   #prompts for your id, but type
					    #anonymous for archives
	331 Guest login ok, send ident as password.
    *	Password: 		#type yourlogin@yourhost.xx.xx here -
    				#echoing is disabled
	230 Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.
    *	ftp> binary		#set transfer type to binary
	200 Type set to I.
    *	ftp> cd pub/traveller	#chdir to the Traveller area
	250 CWD command successful.
    *	ftp> get bun01.Z	#file name assumed to be same on your host
	150 Binary data connection for bun01.Z (129.100.4.51,2328)
	    (20480 bytes).
	226 Binary Transfer complete.
	local: bun01.Z remote: bun01.Z
	20480 bytes received in .34 seconds (59 Kbytes/s)
				#repeat get command as desired
    *	ftp> bye		#terminate the ftp session
	221 Goodbye.
    *	shell> uncompress bun01.Z	#uncompress the bundle

	The files README and TOC provide a brief/detailed summary of the
	contents of the archive.
	
	The site is managed solely by the FTP Site Coordinator:
	dan@engrg.uwo.ca (Dan Corrin).  The University of Western
	Ontario is not responsible for the materials and opinions stored
	in the archives.

Automated Archive Service: archive-server@joshua.atherton.com
	Mail to this address is read by a program which sends automated
	replies.  Almost all of the Traveller Mailing List traffic since
	September 1, 1989, is available from this program.  For more
	information, send a message to the address above with the text
	"help" (on the subject line or first line of the mail message),
	and it will explain to you how to use it.  You can reach the
	human who administrates this service by mailing to
        archive-manager@joshua.atherton.com, or (in a pinch) to
        joshua@atherton.com (Josh Levy).  In UUCP land use
        decwrl!athertn!archive-server, hpda!athertn!archive-server, or
        sun!athertn!archive-server, (note the ommission of the letter
        "o" in the UUCP format).  Archive-server can be replaced with
        archive-manager or joshua in all of the addresses.

Human-run Semi-Automated Archive Service:
		traveller-request@dadla.wr.tek.com (TML Administrator)
	I maintain an archive of every message ever sent to the mailing
	list.  On a time-available basis, I will recover old articles
	for you and resend them to you by direct mail.  I can also send
	you an Archive Table-of-Contents so you can pick and choose
	which messages look interesting.

   Gamemaster \'90 will be held from 8AM-11PM on October 20th at
the Student Union Building at Boise State University.  Among other
events we\'ll be featuring a 

   *********** MEGATRAVELLER TOURNAMENT ****************               

   "Antares Down", written by Philip Athans and will be run by 
none other than Joe Fugate and Gary Thomas of Digest Group 
Publications.   ^^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^^^^^^

   This tournament, written exclusively for Gamemaster \'90
will also be the official RPGA MegaTraveller Tournament of GenCon 
1990.  Well..., maybe they _were_ thinking a little bit about GenCon
when they put it together. 

   Also, Gary Thomas will be giving a seminar on how to write and
be published for RPGs.

   Of course there will also be, AD&D, GURPS Fantasy, board games...

and... a GURPS Space/Cyberpunk tournament based on the film "Total
Recall".   (I\'m co-writing this one.) 

   If anyone is interested, let me know and I\'ll help you with 
the details.  I might even be able to arrange a place to stay if
the demand isn\'t too high.  I realize that for most of you, airfare
to Boise is prohibitive, but for those of you on the West Coast
or Mountain States, maybe this could work out.

Actually, it didn\'t occur to me that folks might PREFER the UWP sector data
from the Classic Traveller period over the MT version.  You see, I \'hand-
cranked\' the post-assassination data for Deneb and Corridor sectors (which
is where my campaign is taking place) from articles in Traveller\'s Digest
issues #18 and #19.  Also, the GEnie library had TWO archives for Massilia
sector: one with the \'old\' data and one with the \'new\' data.

So anyway, if there is enough interest from you TML\'ers, I\'ll go back to
GEnie and get the 3 original sector UWP files for Deneb, Corridor and
Massilia.

Just let me know.

I\'ll manage without it. I\'ll just replace all the fancy alligance codes with
the old standard \'Im\' :-)

BTW, Do you know if there is any other difference between the pre- and post- 
assassination data than the alligance codes? Changes in UWP tend to be few
and a long time between, but I guess that a few planets might have gotten
changes in Gov and Pop.

     Guess what?  You\'re right.  I have issue 9 (the "War Issue") of the

    'body' => 'I was reading the thread about Mercenaries, and some questions struck me.
Being a generally slow and lazy person, I have not managed to write anything
until now, but here it is:

1. Those darn repatriation bonds.
  The olde book \'Mercenary\' talked about \'Repatriation Bonds\'. This was made up
to be the saviour of every merc that was stranded on a (hostile?) world because
the employing government lost the war and ceased to exist. It was defined as 
\'money held in escrew by a third party\' (probably Hortalez or Zirunkarish) that
was supposed to be spent upon mid-passage to some system of the merc\'s choise
(defined beforehand, supposedly).
  What I realized when my players decided to employ two squads of merc\'s was
that the amount of Cr\'s needed to even transport those two squads one jump, 
was far larger than the total salary and bonus of the entire unit! And several
jumps was totally out of the question.
  There is not many countries in desperate need of a merc unit that can afford
to pay several times 8kCr per person in the merc unit. The fact that the money
is\'t lost weighs light when the country itself might  not be around to make use
of the refunded money. They would probably be better off buying weapons for the
money instead of letting them mould in a locked account at Hortalez et Cie\'s :-)

2. Who exacly can hire a merc unit?
  It is hard to imagine that the Imperium let\'s every Tom, Dick, and Norris hire
a band of armed soldiers for some mission that certainly will require that laws
is to be broken. If \'Union of Vranx\' wants to invade it\'s neighbour on the 
balcanized planet, the \'Uurk Federation\', to capture their resources, they\'ll
probably going to break a whole lot of local laws in the \'Federation\', yet, this
seems to be a perfectly ok use of mercs.
  What is the real differece between this and if Wild Bill Hicock wants to
knock over a bank and hires 4 commandos to help him.
  "Oh no, officer, We are just the Dalton brothers, and we\'re a Merc unit!
Look here: here is our mercenary ticket about OK Corral, and here is our 
repatriation bonds."
(Reservations for lack of knowledge about the history of the west :-)
  
  One possible answer to this is that the Imperium don\'t bother with groundling
conflicts unless they break the \'Imperial Rules of War\' that talks about 
\'Major economic damage to the region\'and \'Excessive extraplanetary involvement\'.
  
  By that line of reasoning, travelling to Regina to knock over a bank would be
out, (At least you wouldn\'t get away with calling it a merc ticket :-) on the
grounds of \'Extraplanetary involvement\'. (Remember? *travel* to Regina :-)
Likewise would knocking over the Regina Gold Depository, (Because of \'Major
economic damage to the region\'). But knocking over a local branch on your
home-planet *would* be ok by this reasoning, and since that usually don\'t 
occur every two weeks on all planets, this line of reasoning is wrong.

  Second possible answer: Only governments and similar organizations is allowed
to hire mercs: Probably wrong for several reasons, foremost that several 
MegaCorps have employed mercs repeatedly. It might lead to some amusing 
scenarios, though.
  "Hi! We are the Splutifaxian Air Force and we\'re robbing this bank!"
  "Splutifax? Never heard of it! When was it founded?"
  "About seven minutes ago!"

  Third possible answer: Only governments and companies and similar 
organizations is allowed to hire merc\'s: 
  "Hi! We\'re from Harry\'s bar and grill and we\'re robbing..."
  Ok then, probably not.

  Fourth possible answer: Only if you have friends in high places (Hi Brzk!) 
or if your opponent lacks such friends, are you allowed to hire mercs,
or rather:
  If you don\'t have those friends and hire some merc\'s to knock over the Bank
of Regina, you are going to get a early morning visit from your 
14 (not-so-friendly) neighbourhood plasma-gun-armed marines.


  For some reason, I\'d put my money on Answer #4, How about you, folks?

When doing high-speed space shuttle passes, you have some pretty
sophisticated computer equipment helping you out.

This kind of system exists now; certain combat aircraft and helicopters
have a \'ground-hugging\' autopilot which attempts to travel at a fixed height
above the terrain.  According to sources it works rather well. No human
could do it though; there is too much information and reactions need to be
very fast.

Similar (but much more advanced) computer systems no doubt exist in most
space shuttles, particularly combat drop-shuttles...

As for the Fifth Frontier War, it began with the invasion of Regina
from the Ruie system in 1107, and ended with a cease-fire in mid-1110
and an official armistice on 001-1111. It was the second shortest of
the Frontier Wars. The earliest adventure dates used in any official 
GDW products were in 1105, for Annic Nova and The Traveller Adventure.

     Usually one system for the entire unit, seeing as how mercenary
tickets are only intended for combat-ready, organized units (individual
mercenaries are responsible to their commander, who in turn deals with
the employer).

     That\'s the whole point of a repatriation bond.  If you lose (and,
consequently, are unable to pay your mercenaries), the mercenary unit
can still get off-world (and, presumably, find work elsewhere--they
hope) using banked money that you no longer have any use for (since you
no longer exist as an organization).  If you win, then, great.  Reclaim
the bond, use it to pay off your mercenaries, then take what\'s left and
use it for a much-deserved trip to the famous vacation world of Riviera.
You\'ve won the war--now it\'s Miller time...  ;-)

     Since mercenaries are *soldiers*, they are usually hired for the
purpose of warfare (less often for use as cadre or military police/
occupation troops).  The people who hire them are either "true" (de
jure) governments, de facto governments (such as MegaCorps), or
would-be governments (like rebels).  Notice that all these potential
employers are fairly large organizations, usually with easy access to
the kind of wealth that is needed to hire even a modest-sized
mercenary unit.  Remember, decent troops don\'t come cheap.

 >  What is the real differece between this and if Wild Bill Hicock
 >wants to knock over a bank and hires 4 commandos to help him.

     Easy.  It\'s the same as the difference between legitimate warfare
and commiting a criminal act.  Fighting a war is *not* the same as
robbing a bank, either legally or practically.

     Right.  As long as you don\'t use any nuclear explosives and keep
your invasions *quick* and relatively clean, the Imperium doesn\'t care.

 >  Second possible answer: Only governments and similar organizations

     Since when are MegaCorps *not* governments?  Within their (usually
extensive) on-planet holdings they have the force of a government, and
can still get off world (and, presumably, find work elsewhere--they
in the case where they own an entire planet (or system) then they most
definitely *are* a government.  Anyone who can command the kind of
wealth and power that a MegaCorp represents definitely qualifies for
membership in the Major Players Club.

As far as the Imperium is concerned, none.  The planets in question look after
their own defence.  If the "Rules of War" are broken, the Imperium intervenes.
I suspect the Vranxian invasion is more likely to break the Rules than the
bank job.

It\'s the "excessive" bit that decides it.  For a start, Hickok\'s crowd are in
violation of Regina\'s laws on possession of weapons the moment they leave the
starport.  If they resist arrest, to the extent of killing off any police that
try, they may wind up having the local army to deal with.  If they have the
firepower to wipe out the police and army, that\'s excessive involvement, and
they have the Imperium to deal with.

This is certainly one factor; another is that the Imperium just doesn\'t have
the resources to police every one of its worlds.  Each planet is responsible
for its own defence and police.  The Imperial forces come in when things get
serious, e.g. Zhodani invasion, TL12 mercs robbing TL4 planets, etc.  The
Imperium officially doesn\'t like anyone hiring mercs, because it doesn\'t want
fighting within its borders.  Unofficially, a quick military campaign is
usually preferable to a long economic one, such as sanctions, trade embargoes
etc.  The "Rules of War" have never been written down, and don\'t "officially"
exist, because if they did they would indicate Imperial approval of internal
wars.  Basically, a mercenary unit has to use common-sense, and so does its
employer.  If their idea of common-sense differs from that of the local
governor, the Imperium intervenes.  "Excessive off-world involvement",
"economic damage" are not precisely defined, mainly so a merc unit can\'t
say "But Rorke\'s Raiders did it two months ago on Roup, and you didn\'t bother
them".  There is one exception.  If anyone uses nuclear weapons, the Imperial
forces squash them.

Seriously though, scrap my previous list.  In future, I post with the book by
my side - like now.  From the old Library Data A-M supplement:

The Fourth Frontier War started in 1082, and finished in 1084.  Also known as
the False War.  The armistice was signed before instructions for conduct of
the war got from the capitals to the front lines.

The Fifth Frontier War lasted from 1107 to 1111.

This bit is from a Traveller\'s Digest magazine; Strephon was assassinated in
1116.

Now for the question.  The final battle of the Fourth Frontier War was the
Battle of Two Suns, so called because it took place somewhere between Yres
and Menorb (see Library Data A-M, and Adventure 1 - Kinunir).  What were two

     As a new subscriber to this list, I want to dive right in and see some
action.  If anyone is desperately searching for old Traveeler products I have 
a fair sampling of odd things (The Beyond, Vanguard Reached, 50 Starbases, all

got 40 or 50 new system vehicle designs ranging in size from motorcycles to

      In my opinion this could not have happened, and is really an artifact
of an earlier conception of the game.  The particular entry he cites was
culled from Adventure Module 1 (The Kinunir), which was issued before High Guard
came out (I think), and before Trillion Credit Squadron (certainly).  The mere
fact that that module describes a 1250ton vessel as a "cruiser" compared to
the later 50,000ton+ cruisers, and equips it with a black glode marks it as,
shall we say, a trifle obsolete.  (However--the Traveller Adventure includes
a battle as a deep space refueling rendevous).

  Ah, I\'ve got to admit that I didn\'t think of that possibility. I  guess I was
to focussed on \'You pay them salary, then you pay the repatriation bond\' problem
that I forgot that one can use the repatriation money to pay them off!

  A few megacredits can take you quite far. Unless, of course, there is need of
armed, hitech vehicles or the ubiquitous Battledress & FGMP. If you are willing
to settle for Combat Environment Suits, Gaussrifles & RAM Auto-GL\'s one can
easily hire several hundred people for 1MCr (assuming Cr75,000 per platoon for
2 months. [Yes, this is  George William Herbert\'s exampla :-)], adding the
equipment wont add more than 25,000, for a total of one platoon per 100kCr)

  But replace Wild Bill with Naasirka and the bank with a research station owned
by a competitor. It would still be a crime, but suddenly it is transformed into
a \'legitimate\' ticket. 
(I\'m not sure, but I think that a commando raid against a competitor has been
published in the JTAS as a ticket?)

  I was assuming that there existed some kind of \'official\' recognition of the
governments that makes up the imperium. Remember that, contray to what the name
would lead one to assume, the Imperium is more reminicent of a defence
pact than of a regular state.
  There is numerous references to the fact that the \'real\' territory of the 
Imperium is the space between the planets, and even one oblique reference to
that the IISS is charged with deciding which planetary governments that are
\'legitimate\'
  (Reference: TD adventure number 11 or 12 (?) where a rebel movements first
priority is to make the IISS change the worlds UWP \'government\' classification
to \'balcanized\', thereby transforming the rebels from being a (probably) illegal
organization to being one of two governments on that world, thus giving is some
sort of legitimay in the eyes of the Imperium.)

  My question then is: Why does not every criminal organize their jobs as
tickets, and take advantage of the *repatriation bonds*? Since defeated mercs
are allowed free passage off planet, one would assume that captured criminals
would jump on that opportunity!


  If we look at it from the individual mercs point of view, (s)he is bound to
be quite interested in if the repatriation bond is going to be honored, or if
some Imperial official is going to smash them with a law-book and say:
  "Sorry, but this exceeds the limits for a ticket and enters the criminal area,
Off to Exile/Usani you go!"

  (BTW, In my campaign there is a civil war on a certain planet where bonds
are *not* honored. And since the guerilla is claimed to be Zho-supported, this
has led to that Marines have been forced to do Counter Insugency assignments
there. Quite an unpopular assignment, I assure you...)

Well, there is one thing to consider about this.  In space, stars are rarely
one parsec apart.  I am not sure about the distance between Yres and Menorb,
but for arguments sake, lets assume that it is one hex on the star map.  The
stars could be any place within that hex.  So lets say that this is the setup:

      +----+
     /       \\
    <   Yres  >
     \\    *  /
      +----+
     /     * \\
    <  Menorb >
     \\       /
      +----+

The asterik indicates where the stars are.  It is possible that they are close
to being a binary system, just that one doesn\'t rotate around another.  In
which case the battle could have occured in deep space.

As far as the cruiser comments go, in Suppement 9, Fighting Ships you will see
a whole line of cruisers ranging from light cruisers to heavy crusiers.  The
Kinur (sp) was a colonial cruiser and could have been listed at the 1250 ton
displacement, though I seem to remember it being larger.  (Ah the problems of
not having your reference material handy)  Regardless, High Guard and TCS were
both founded upon the earlier works.  There is a lot of contenuity.  In fact, I
seem to remember the Kinur using the High Guard statistics (don\'t quote me on
that one).

Just my 0.02 credit\'s worth for the sake of arguing.... :-)

[Example saved and deleted for future use :-) ]

I think this is a great idea.  We could build a small data base of these
characters and that would be of great help.  Maybe we could pretty them up and
put them in some kind of "Standard form"  (Should we call ISO or ANSI?) and
when we get a batch of them, upload them to GEnie since they are kind enough to
let us have their files (of course someone is paying for them, but at least
they are letting us redistribute them).

I don\'t have the character sheets handy, but one of the first I will upload
(besides my numero-uno PC, Anton Devious) is a dude named Tad McBad.  He is a
bounty hunter.  He has a cool character sketch, but I will have to find a way
to scan it in :-).  I have a couple of other NPC\'s that I have used on
occasions to give my character\'s fits.  I will try to get some entered into
this computer and mailed out.

I think this is a novel and nifty idea! My characters are what makes
my campaigns special. I\'d be glad to contribute a couple dozen (including

     Sure.  That\'s how bonds work.  If you don\'t forfeit the bond (in
this case, lose the war), you don\'t lose the money; you get it back.  If
you win, then you pay your troops their accumulated pay and bonuses, and
transport off-world is *their* problem.  The larger and better-
established units will usually have their own transport (remember the
_Broadsword_ class mercenary cruiser?), so they\'ll just load up their
equipment and go on to their next ticket.

     Um.  I\'m not so sure about that.  How long are you planning on
keeping your fighting force in the field?  If it\'s any reasonably long
length of time, then payroll costs are going to mount up (not to mention
death benefits for KIAs and medical support costs for ordinary
casualties).  How about ammunition?  You usually have to pick up the
tab for that.  Replacement of combat-lossed equipment?

     Remember, things *always* end up costing more than you planned,
since warefare isn\'t amenable to prediction.  Was is von Clausewitz
who said "No battle plan survives contact with the enemy?"

     Um.  I have two comments on that.  First, Naasirka can buy any
number of judges they want (not to mention lawyers--remember, whoever
has the most lawyers wins).  I strongly suspect that "Wild Bill doesn\'t
have that option.

     Second, I\'d bet long odds that any decent mercenary would be too
proud to accept a ticket that requires him to become a common criminal.

     A strike raid against a research station as part of a combat unit
is one thing.  Robbing a bank is something else again.  I think that
it\'s reasonable for the average mercenary to not have to fight civil
police.

 >(I\'m not sure, but I think that a commando raid against a competitor
 >has been published in the JTAS as a ticket?) 

     I don\'t know for sure.  My collection of the Journal goes back to
issue 9, and is complete to the present.  I just checked 9 through 24
(my issues of _Challenge_ are still packed--I just moved) and didn\'t
find any mercenary tickets.  Could be, though.

     I doubt that it matters.  If you have the actual power, official
recognition doesn\'t make that much difference.

     If the government with the power *isn\'t* your employer, and you
just did something to annoy them that wasn\'t part of legitimate warfare,
they probably won\'t let you off the planet.  You\'re going to prison
anyway, so trying to fake up some some bogus "ticket" won\'t help you.

     Really?  And there are actually mercenaries stupid enough to fight
there?  I\'m amazed.  I certainly wouldn\'t.  Heck, I\'d sooner hang up
my webgear and get a job at McDonalds (I don\'t care if it *is* 3000
years in the future--some things will *never* go away).  :-)

     Try using chooser to select a laserprinter driver and then print

     Fortunately, mine is just across the room.  :-)  Looking in my
copy of Adventure 1:  _The Kinunir_, I see that the ship is listed as
being 1200 tons.  There are no High Guard stats.  The copyright date
on the adventure is 1979, while the date on my (first printing) copy
of _High Guard_ is 1980.

     It may have been redone in High Guard form, but I think the above
dates show that the original design predates Book 5.

  130k...

  So posting directly to the TML is definately out of the question.

I think this is a great Idea as well. Sort of like our own private version
of the JTAS\'s (Actually I forget the name of the article series now :-(  )
Anyway they had a description of a charater and then how a group of PC\'s
could meet and/or interact with said character. This last part is important
as it gives some insight to the operation of the NPC.

As a "Standard format" how about:
Name  UPP
Origins (Race, Age, sex, etc)
(Notable) Skills, Awards
Background (Past service, etc)
Current Activities
Possible Player Interaction
Optional Patron mission.

You are free to upload them to GEnie if you wish, however they were not kind
at all to us. We only have the Sector data, because the people at Digest
group gave us permission (as they were the ones responsable for the original
GEnie post). We have had the data for serveral months, and it took us (mainly
Mark Cook) this long to get around their (GEnie\'s) restrictions. The fact
that they are here at all is because of Mark Cook. 

Uploading can be done to the TML ftp site, just let me know via email that 
you have put something in the \'donations\' directory, and I will move it to 
the traveller area. If you don\'t have ftp access, you can mail me with the 
information directly.

If you *really* need NPC\'s generated in batches:   I have a
program up and running on my "HOME" machine that will crank out
very basic characters based on the OT rules.   The output is very
raw and when I use it for myself, I edit the daylights out of it
to make the characters useable.  

As far as the program itself, I wrote it in C++ and it (much to my
chagrin) has turned out to be not so portable.  

HOWEVER!  If you want some NPCs, give me an EMAIL address and I\'ll
whip up a batch.

There we have it, an opinion (DM -2, die roll 5 on reaction) on
mercenaries engaging in bank robberies...   

Ian is one of my alter egos, (now as an NPC) and is an ethnic Scot
through and through.   With a long family tradition of being
involved in "soldier for hire" situations that he is proud of.
Ain\'t no way he\'d get involved in a bank robbery.  

Probably, if he found out about a group that was robbing banks and
calling themselves mercenaries, he\'d make the victim banks an
offer for his services at unbelievably low prices... damn near
free.

Akian_Ironfist_SP_Gun_TL9
 
 
     The Ironfist is a variant of the Cossack APC design.  Since the MD gun 
requires 35MW to operate, the weapon cannot be fired while the vehicle is in 
flight, and therefore no stabilization is provided. The gun is in a hull 
mount with limited traverse-gross aiming is done by turning the vehicle.

Continental_Defense_Unit_TL15
 
 
     The CDU mounts two starship class fusion gun turrets in addition to a 
large array of smaller weapons primarily intended for defense.  With its 
thick armor and good active defence, the CDU is proof against almost 
anything short of a starship meson gun battery.  Very few have ever actually 
been built, due to the difficulty of transport, and public mistrust of an 
unmanned device so potentially destructive.

Lance_Class_Heavy_Fighter_TL15
 
 
     The Lance class was designed following the Fifth Frontier War, as a 
result of the extremely poor performance of the then-current three classes 
of light fighters employed as auxiliaries by IGN warships.  Lack of computer 
ability was the major complaint of the previous classes, and the Lance 
mounts a state of the art Comp 9.  This is responsible for 75% of the total 
cost per unit, but the increase in capability is considered highly 
worthwhile by the pilots.

Javelin_Class_Light_Fighter_TL15
 
 
     Like the Lance, the Javelin class was designed following the Fifth 
Frontier War, as a result of the extremely poor performance of the then-
current three classes of light fighters employed as auxiliaries by IGN 
warships.  Sizing of the Javelin was dictated by the existence of 20 ton 
capable launch tubes on board some classes of existing warships. Lack of 
computer ability was the major complaint of the previous classes, and the 
Javelin mounts a high performance Comp 7.  This is responsible for about 75% 
of the total cost per unit.

Rocket_Interceptor_TL6
 
 
     The rocket interceptor is capable of flight beyond a planetary 
atmosphere, and thus provides some limited capability for planetary defense 
at fairly low tech level.  With no onboard radar, the pilot is completely 
dependent on ground based intercept instructions.  Usual operating mode is 
to use 70-80% of the fuel to reach a suborbital trajectory, retaining the 
remainder for final attack maneuvers.  The pilot then makes a deadstick 
landing upon reentry.

Archer_Light_Gravtank_TL10
 
 
     The Archer is built under license by a number of concerns in the 
Spinward Marches.  The tank is intended for light combat and reconaissance 
duties, and is accordingly fitted with a powerful sensor suite, accounting 
for about 20% of the vehicle\'s cost.  One unusual feature of the design is 
the provision of two different main weapons, mounted coaxially in the remote 
turret.  Doctrine calls for the use of the laser at long distances and the 
plasma gun at short.  While the vehicle has sufficient power to fire both 
weapons simultaneously, the plasma gun tends to induce atmospehric 
distortions which reduce the laser\'s capability substantially.

I belive it was called Close Encounters.  On the subject of JTAS, what do you
think of "Challenge" (besides we don\'t get any new Traveller stuff here in
Louisville).  I hate it myself.  I understand why they did it, but it really
hurt Traveller.  Maybe if we could get the Digest Group folks "interneted" or
something then WE could put out our own quartly of the JTAS.  We would have to
call it something different, but we could do the same "general" format.  We
could have our Close Encounters, Amber Zone, and Beastiary sectons.  Amber Zone
was one of my favorite columns.  I found the most useful stuff the JTAS News
Digest.  This will be the hardest to deal with since it must come down the pipe
from GDW or Digest Group.  We could have our own articals, but still war news
and stuff we would want to be in synch with GDW.  Ideas?  Volunteers?

Yataghan_Class_Missile_Boat_TL_15
 
     Known as the "Type 1107" during the design phase, the 
Yataghan class has recently entered service with the Imperial 
Glisten Navy.  Vessels of this type are primarily intended to act 
as a covering force while larger or more vulnerable vessels are 
deploying riders or refueling.  Only three have been constructed 
as of 1-1117 (Yataghan, Tulwar, and Kukri).

Type S Scout/Courier
 
     This is a variation of the ancient Type S design as produced 
at TL10.  Problems with this vessel include the lack of grav 
plates and inertial compensation, which make it very unpopular 
when higher tech versions are available. Space has been allowed 
for the installation of a turret, though lack of power restricts 
turret armament to missiles or sand.

Folding Wing Light Aircraft

     This craft is designed to fit in the four displacement ton vehicle bay 
of a Type S scout ship with its wings folded.  It provides an economical 
alternative to the standard air/raft, and also can often be used on lower 
tech level planets where availability opf local maintenance can be an 
advantage.

Poni All Terrain Vehicle TL10

     The Poni is intended as an all purpose low cost all terrain vehicle.  
The legged suspension gives excellent off road performance, and the vehicle 
will float, and is therefore capable of limited amphibious operation. The 
wide range of sensors are intended to assist in exploratory work, and the 
robot arms allow some outside operation to be done without exposing the crew 
to potential hazards.

Prospector\'s_Track_TL10
 
     This prospector\'s track is a light utility vehicle designed to be useful 
under  a  variety of circumstances.  The airlock allows  ingress  and  egress 
without  waste  of air when this is helpful, and also can be  used  with  the 
inner door open to increase the driver\'s available space when safe (that  is, 
operating  in a breathable atmosphere.)  The fuel cell system can  be  charged 
with hydrogen and oxygen to allow closed cycle operation in vacuum or  exotic 
atmosphere, or hydrogen alone when circumstances allow.  Instruments give the 
capability to perform limited survey work without leaving the vehicle.

Shambalator_Class_Escort_TL_15
 
     The Shambalator class was designed for the Imperial Glisten Navy as an 
escort vessel for merchant ships and for piracy suppression, and as such did 
not need to be an exceedingly capable design.  However, the provision of a 
battery of high energy weapons was required by BuShip, along with a model 9 
computer.  The latter reduces crew requirements substantially, and is 
considered to be one of the few positive features of the design.  Since the 
power plant is only required to meet this peak performance during combat, the 
endurance of the vessel can be increased to 26 days when operating without 
weapon use or extended acceleration over 1G.  This policy of tradeoffs in the 
design also led to the unfortunate side effect of the vessel having 
insufficient power to operate the inertial compensators at accelerations of 
over 2Gs. It is also dependent on outside fuel purification capability.  
Despite these flaws, 600 were initially built, and performed adequately in 
the Fifth Frontier War.  About 450 remain in active service. The price given 
below includes the two Stinger class light fighters.

     Deployed by the Imperial Glisten Navy prior to the Fifth Frontier War, 
the Stinger proved to be a failure as a ship attack fighter due to 
insufficient computer capacity, but was reasonably successful in the ground

Planetary_Defense_Sled_TL_15
 
     The planetary defense sled is intended to be able to hide on a planet, 
but still be capable of inflicting damage on a starship.  The extremely 
powerful model 7 computer setup accounts for 60% of the vehicle\'s total cost.

Atlantis_Class_Battleship_TL_15
 
     Only two of these enormous craft were ever built.  The Atlantis itself 
was destroyed by a squadron of Collace battlecruisers during the opening 
stages of the Fifth Frontier War, leaving the Lemuria in service as the 
flagship of the Imperial Glisten Navy.  The ships were originally built with 
a 20 ton launch tube prior to the introduction of the Lance class 40 ton 
fighter.  With the recent deployment of the Javelin class 20 ton fighter, a 
modification to allow the Lemuria to carry 500 Javelins in lieu of the 250 
Lances currently carried is being considered.

Type_1107_Destroyer_TL_15
 
     The Type 1107 Destroyer is in service with the Imperial Glisten Navy.  
While designed prior to the outbreak of the war, interruption of the ship 
building program during the brief Collace occupation of Glisten prevented any 
from being completed until after the fighting was over.

Sun_Tzu_Class_Heavy_Cruiser_TL_15
 
     The Sun_Tzu was one of the more successful pre-war IGN designs.  The 
only major problem experienced in combat was that the spinal particle 
accelerator was not as effective as originally envisioned, and a program was 
undertaken after the war to refit some of the vessels with a spinal meson 
gun.

Collace_Destroyer_TL13
 
     In keeping with the design philosophy of the Collace Independence Fleet, 
these vessels were intended to perform a single function, and to be built 
quickly.  It should be noted that the destroyer is dependent on use of the 
its subsidiary missile boat\'s fuel scooping and purifying capability.

First, the criminals would have to find someone to hire them and supply the
ticket.  Second, there is no such thing as a "legitimate" ticket - officially,
the Imperium does not allow warfare within its borders.  In practise, the
Imperium can\'t prevent it, and will turn a blind eye as long as things don\'t
get out of hand.  But if the Imperium does intervene, a repatriation bond
won\'t help the mercs - if it\'s Imperium vs repatriation bond, the Imperium
wins.

Also, remember what a repatriation bond is - a sum of money, held by some
responsible party (e.g. megacorporation, large bank, etc.) to provide the
mercs with a way out if they get stranded.  The employer must find a
reponsible party who will handle the bond, and that party is going to want
to examine the ticket.  Banks are hardly likely to support a bunch of
commandos on a bank-robbing job (unless, of course, it\'s a rival bank :-)
and neither banks or megacorps are likely to take an interest in a small
outfit like Hickok\'s 4 commandos.  They also won\'t want to antagonise the
Imperium, or the governments of worlds they may want to do business with.
Remember, _responsible_ party - they don\'t get that reputation by dealing
with any bunch of criminals.

Most space travellers have plenty of time on their hands, and a desire to make

Time=Item base cost/cr10000 in hours (minimum=1), done in spare time only
Hazardous=damage to item requiring additional parts
Kit cost would be 70% of normal item cost for a *difficult* kit, 90% for a
*routine kit, and 50% for a *formidable* kit.
Modifiers for hasty performance ok, but kit building is already a cautious
task, so requires a determination check to start.  Lack of proper tools
increases difficulty by one level (usually).

  TASK: Get permission to use ship equipment, Routine, Liaison,

This is for permission to use the ship\'s shop while a passenger rather than a

Well, there is one thing to consider about this.  In space, stars are rarely
one parsec apart.  I am not sure about the distance between Yres and Menorb,
but for arguments sake, lets assume that it is one hex on the star map.  The
stars could be any place within that hex.  So lets say that this is the setup:

      +----+
     /       \\
    <   Yres  >
     \\    *  /
      +----+
     /     * \\
    <  Menorb >
     \\       /
      +----+

The asterik indicates where the stars are.  It is possible that they are close
to being a binary system, just that one doesn\'t rotate around another.  In
which case the battle could have occured in deep space.

***************************************************************************
I like the nifty diagram, but the problem still remains...let\'s accept this
line of argument and say that the stars themselves are only half a lightyear
apart.  Let\'s see, at 180,000mps that is something like 6.7 E12 kilometers.
Two fleets starting in each system, and accelerating at 2Gs to the halfway
point in normal space would take d=1/2at^2 where d=3.35E12 and a=20m/sec^s.
That makes t about 212 days, if I didn\'t slip a decimal, which is too much
to bother with, which means they would have had to have jumped to get there,
in which case Adrian Hurt\'s objection still holds.  QED and all that.

- ----

As far as the cruiser comments go, in Suppement 9, Fighting Ships you will see
a whole line of cruisers ranging from light cruisers to heavy crusiers.  The
Kinur (sp) was a colonial cruiser and could have been listed at the 1250 ton
displacement, though I seem to remember it being larger.  (Ah the problems of
not having your reference material handy)  Regardless, High Guard and TCS were
both founded upon the earlier works.  There is a lot of contenuity.  In fact, I
seem to remember the Kinur using the High Guard statistics (don\'t quote me on
that one).


 ----

  Well, there may be a fair amount of continuity in things Traveller-esque,
but to this old scarred veteran (1st printing of rules), the fact that there
were two incompatible editions of High Guard, not to mention four incompatible
combat systems (Book 3, Snapshot, Azhanti High Lightning, Striker), two margin-
ally compatible character generation systems, and at least two incompatible
trade and commerce systems prior to the publication of MegaTraveller (Which,
much as I love, still has uncorrected errors-a subject for another letter), 
makes that the nature of that continuity a little suspect.  I know that I had
designed several fleets before High Guard was released (the 1st repudiated
edition) in which, since a 5000ton hull was the biggest there was, those
were the battleships, and so on scaled down the line.  A 1200 ton "cruiser"
falls right in line with that.

DGP already puts out their own magazine called travellers digest, 
unfortunately (As far as I know) the publishing schedule has been extremely 
erratic. There are quite a few "fanzines" for traveller as well, some more 
professional than others. 

As for us publishing something...  I think that would be difficult time
consuming, and probably pove unworkable.

The point of the NPC database is to have character backgrounds, and 
objectives so that they can be used as major NPC\'s instead of flat
characters. Unfortunnately these take a while to develop.

Thanks for the people anyways. I\'ll add them to my 101 characters, and
veterens.

for the purpose of stealing the details of a certain proprietary manufacturing
process (that would allow a 5-7% decrease
in the cost of some fairly common commodity).  Still sounds more like Hickok and his four commandos than a real military operation to me.

Is it possible that different rules, if you will, apply when there is a clear
(but of course undeclared) trade war going on between two companies?  In the
case of an acknowledged conflict, the raid on the manufacturing facility looks
a *little* less like a random criminal
act, and more like a *legitimate* military
operation.

P.S.  Any comments on the vehicles?

 crimminals don\'t use then:
         As far as I can tell considering the world of traveller, hiring a merc
 unit to rob a bank is a bit pointless:
         (1) Not much money to be made out of it after all costs have been paid.
         (2) A legitimate merc unit would never risk a reputation on being
             caught as common crooks, the unit does have other jobs to run.

 Now crooks could never get hold of a bond as bonds are issued by some
 megacorparation. The company would probally wish to know the purpose of the
 mission etc and would never back a crime.

 Bonds would only be issued if there was a danger of the employer of the unit
 disappearing, being overthrown etc. The merc need an escape route, the bonds
 provide it. I suggest reading \'Dogs of War\' as this provides a lot of depth
 into the the workings of the merc during the 1960 in africa. They used the Red
 Cross as their bond, to get out of the country.
         If a government was to not let the mercs use their bond to get off the
 planet they may even cause the Imperial or Megacorpartion forces to intervene.
 (Nasty)

 Now lets consider this, a group of crook wish to rob somewhere, They can hire
 mercs as advisors, low cost, good tatics. To the mercs just another 2 bit job.
 Now may the crooks wish to hire someone to do the crime, what do you think
 player characters are for. They have never asked for a bond when I landed then
 with some jobs (but they wished they had when the job had finished)

 So to sum up: Bonds would only be issued in a major war zone to ensure the
 saftey of the merc off planet.
               A fighting merc force would be hired for a strike, defense
 mission only when a major fighting force is expected. Robbing a bank is not a
 strike mission.

 The above applies to my adventures:
 The big note is that in the future merc unit are companies with a job to do and
 it they start robbing banks they may loss costomers

Well that is a little more than I thought about.  I was thinking more like an
electronic version.  We couldn\'t transport graphics very well (since deciding
of a format is like next to impossible) and this kills maps and other artwork.
But we could have a quarterly or monthly electronic go out that contained some
news from our campaigns in a more local sense.  Joe Starshooter was arrested
trying to steal naval ordinance from such and such depot.  This kind of new
would never make the JTAS New Digest, but would go far with us for use in our
smaller scale campaigns.

We could also have a beastiry section, an NPC section, and a small adventure.
We would also need one large frame artical per E-zine.  Something like world
building, hints on building ships, etc.  This later part would be the hardest
to get and the least use to most, but it seemd to be the major theme of JTAS.

                           ^^^^^^
If here you mean Marc Miller, then you should know
that this list actually started its existence as the
"Fugate" list -- Miller had nothing to do with it.

>If anyone can supply additions or corrections I would be pleased to hear
>from you.

Here goes:

>Bolth                /Zachrisson/Fulani [possibly]                vr

not official (Paranoia Press)

>Chirpers             [various]                                    am5,adv2

Chirpers have also appeared in several of the
Travellers\' Digests, most notably number 11.

>Dolphins             Terra/Sol/Solomani Rim(1827)                 td13,boj2

The dolphins in td13 and boj2 are not the same race.
The td13 dolphins are now the official ones.  (The
differences are very slight.)

>Eslyat               Elliador/Trelyn/Vanguard Reaches(3110)       vr

not official (Paranoia Press)

>Geonee (H)           //Massilia                                   mtie,mta1

The Geonee have also appeared in td11.

>Iasat                Zurr                                         tea,wbh

Now this is an interesting one.  The actual name of
this race, as far as I know, is the Lasat.  DGP uses
a typeface without serifs, though, so it is easy to
misread a small "l" as a capital "I", I guess.
Also, sad to say, the lasat should not be on this
list anyway.  They are only an intelligent creature,
not a race with sentience.  They are like the
dolphins of 20th-century Earth in this respect.

>Mal\'Gnar (H)         Mal\'Gnar/Mal\'Gnar Radiant/Beyond(3002)       beyond
>Murians              //Vanguard Reaches [Altarean Confederation]  vr

not official (Paranoia Press)

>Prt\'                 Prt\'//Spica                                  ch26

There was a guy who wanted to play one of these in
Joe\'s campaign, and Joe wouldn\'t let him -- he and
Gary say these are "just housecats", and evidently
Marc Miller agrees with them.  They said this is a
variant rule that should not be in "real"
MegaTraveller.

>Sabmiqys             Sabmiqys//Antares(2117)                      ch28

Reading the Challenge article carefully (and not
that I am -- this is all from memory), I have this
annoying feeling that the code (E) for extinct
should appear somehow on this entry, even though I
know that wouldn\'t be exactly right -- this one
slips into the cracks very well.  These guys also
appeared in 101 Robots and were mentioned in passing
in Book 8: Robots.

>Sred*Ni              I\'Sred*Ni Nest/I\'Sred*Ni Heptad/Beyond(1923) beyond

not official (Paranoia Press)

>Virushi              Virshash/Urlaqqash/Reavers Deep(2724)        jtas12

I vaguely remember some Library Data in a
Travellers\' Digest.  Maybe number 15, but I don\'t
really recall -- somebody else can look it up for
me.  There is also a drawing of a Virushi in World
Builders\' Handbook, with a caption about a mishap in
language translation.

>~~~~~~~~~~
 
>Index to references:
>  beyond   Beyond (Paranoia Press)
>  vr       Vanguard Reaches (Paranoia Press)

Books by Paranoia Press are *not* official according to GDW and DGP.

>  td#      Travellers Digest (DGP)
>  tea      The Early Adventures (DGP)

The Early Adventures contained material from the first four issues
of Travellers Digest -- I guess DGP didn\'t print very many of the
early magazines, and got lots of requests for them.  You might
want to make the list consistent in referring to both of these
where appropriate (although maybe you already have -- not
everything in the first four issues was reprinted, because some
had appeared elsewhere, such as in Book 8: Robots).
This would affect the following entries from above:

>Cafadans (H)         Cafad/Sashrakusha/Corridor(3135)             td3
>Gl\'lu                Kubishush/Inar/Deneb(0917)                   td1
>Iasat                Zurr                                         tea,wbh
>Irdu                 Ishirdu/Two Worlds/Corridor(0338)            td3

>  tsg      The Space Gamer (series)

For point of future reference, you all might want to know that
the only articles in this series that GDW and DGP consider
official are those written by the Keith brothers.

There are three terms. Each is 13 weeks comprising of five weeks lecture,
one week break, five weeks lecture and two weeks inter-term break. Libraries
will be open during off weeks. Transport to Bondi will be arranged for
inter-term breaks and to Thetgung during breaks.

Library courses are available at all times and are self paced. Extra lectures
may be arranged between pupils and administrators.

[Students are limited to the number of courses they can tolerate by their
EDUcation. Basically you are only comfrortable taking EDU*2 hours per
week. If more courses are taken the student must make a determination
roll in that subject to pass.  For the first EDU hours after the base
a routine Determination roll must be made for each extra two hours. For
the second EDU hours a difficult roll must be made, et cetera.
	E.g. Eithne has an A education and is a sucker for punishment.
She wishes to study 40 hours a week. The first 20 hours of course choices
are automatic. For the next ten hours she must roll 5 Routine Determination
rolls. For the last ten she must roll 5 Difficult rolls.
	Student with a 5+ EDU can spread their maximum over two terms. 
I.e. with a 7 EDU you can do 14 hours per week. Say there were a lot 
of courses in first term you wanted to do. You could then do 20 hours 
per week in first term and 8 per week in second term and get away with it. 
Similarly those with A+ EDU can spread their load over
three terms.
	For each group completed the student gets skill rank one in
that skill. If it is a cascade skill they will receive one AT in each
of the relevant sub-skills. Partially completed groups merit one AT for
each course completed.
	If a student already has a rank in the appropriate skill they will
receive a bye for the first two courses. If they complete the group they
will only receive four ATs. There is no point in them doing the courses
they have a bye for. They already know what they are trying to teach.]

was able to damage it). They might be interesting to play - very difficult
to injure, disarming opponents with a little lecture on the benefits of
being nice to people. If anyone wants a copy of the article, let me know
and I can email it to them (that doesn\'t break GDW copyright does it?).

Mercenaries ... I\'m in the process of doing some costings for a typical
TL10 merc company (salaries, equipment maintenance etc) and comparing it
to costs of indigenous troops. I should have it done by Monday. Would a
group of mercs do a bank job anyway? It seems a long way to travel (from
off-world) to spend 20 minutes sticking up a bank. Look at it this way: a
merc private gets about Cr300 a month - that\'s about Cr .25 for a half-hour
bank raid. And then you\'ve all the hassle of moving the troops offworld ...

     Really?  I have the books put out by Paranoia Press (after all,
they were printed in my own home state), and they all say (*very*
prominently) that they were approved for use with Traveller by GDW.
As a matter of fact, Marc Miller\'s name is listed in each under the
heading "Friends and Advisers."  In one case that I can find (_SORAG_),
he\'s listed as a playtester.

     So "approved" means "okay to use, if you want, but wash your hands
afterward, and don\'t expect us to support any of it where you might see
us doing it?"  ;-)

Hoplite Grav Tank TL15

     The Hoplite emphasizes protection and small size in favor of endurance.  
The main armament is unusual--2 fusion-Z guns are carried coaxially in the 
turret, for an increase in the total rate of fire.  The pulse lasers are 
mounted in sponsons on either side of the hull, and are intended for short 
range antipersonnel use.

     The SIE 800 ton escort class was produced by ConTech of Glisten in 
response to an SIE requirement for protection of larger unarmed merchant 
vessels.  The normal crew of 15 can be augmented by double occupancy use of 
staterooms, if an emergency warrants it.

Whippet Ground Car TL10

     The Whippet is an inexpensive basic transportation design, suitable for 
use in urban areas and on improved roads.  The use of a fuel cell allows 
sufficient fuel to be carried for extended operations between refills--low 
maintenance being one of the selling points of the design.

Pioneer Grav Carrier TL10

     The Pioneer is intended as a general purpose large grav vehicle suitable 
for extended wilderness use by military or scientific parties.  The powerful 
Model 1 computer and extensive sensor suite would seldom be required by 
casual users.  The vehicle is designed to fit the standard starship 10 ton 
vehicle bay.

Sorry, gang, but times and tastes change, and this area is one of them.
When Traveller was getting started, Marc Miller and the GDW gang were
desperate for third-party support; such support implies the "legitimacy"
and acceptance of a game as an industry standard. In the late 1970s, this
was not yet the case for Traveller, and the thought of someone actually
caring enough to write supplements for the game was enough to encourage
instant favorable response from GDW. Since then, as Traveller has become
established and its quality has gone up (with the exception of the stuff
GDW is doing, interestingly...I wonder if DGP can take the right to do
Traveller away from the people who created it? |-> ), the older, less
coherent and integrated materials have been officially removed from the
list of "legit" Traveller history. The word SORAG and its definition,
and the names of the two sectors they designed, are the ONLY items that
were retained by GDW, and only because the GDW Universe map had them
printed on it in the latter case. Judges\' Guild released a slew of Traveller
materials, all promiently marked "Officially approved" and all non-legit.
They designed star maps for four sectors, two of which were out when the
Universe map was published; those two names were also saved, but the latter
two were not. 

On a personal note, I find it a very good thing that the Paranoia Press
stuff was yanked...the overall level of technological advancement in the
area, as PP represented it, was more than enough to make mincemeat out
of the Imperium AND the Zhodani. There were two ringworlds and a Dyson
sphere, as I recall, a bunch of really pointless aliens, and such tech
goodies as portable tesseracts (or was that an article in one of the
magazines?) and intelligent, sentient computers. Pfui!

Well, I\'m no expert, but I know some of the DGP
folks, and have been in on some of their playtests,
so I was able to ask them this specifically.

The way I understand it, the Paranoia Press stuff
was very "early" Traveller, and was written before
anyone (including Marc Miller) really knew what the
Imperium was like.  Later, when they all decided
what to do, they decided to change some stuff.  What
Joe Fugate told me was (and I quote):  "In a
conversation with Marc Miller, I asked specifically,
\'Is the Paranoia Press stuff still valid?\'  And Marc
said, \'No.\'"  He also said something like (and this
is not a quote):  "The Paranoia Press stuff was
official at one time, but it is now considered
\'obsolete\'".  Evidently, the stuff that is still
mentioned (like SORAG) is official, but you can\'t
take the whole book as official (at least that\'s how
I understand it IMHO).
 
>Isn\'t it interesting how DGP seems to have avoided this area like the
>proverbial plague?
 
Yeah, now that you mention it, that is rather
suspicious.  Maybe they will do something in their
alien book that has the Aslan in it.  I\'ll ask them
when I playtest the final adventure.

Population = PopM * Base Population, and PopM is an integer 1 <= PopM <= 9

Thus to get your PopM:

PopM = rand() % 9 + 1;

Thus if your UWP Population code was 8  (10\'s of Millions) and your PopM was 6
then your population would be 60 Million.

Hope this helps

The population multiplier is not used directly for any of the rules. It just
narrows down the range of values for the population digit. (e.g. a planet 
with a UPP of Xxxx7xx-x has between 10,000,000 and 99,999,999 people. If the 
population digit is given, and is say 4, you now know that there are between 
40,000,000 and 49,999,999 people). 
It is used in the World builders handbook when determining the size and 
number of cities on the planet (they also have you generate the next two
digits). Similarily with the Gas Giant, and Asteroid Belt numbers, mainly 
people only care if they are zero or non-zero

As for the generation of random planet names, use the language tables for the
various races. (I have used them in a program which names planets without a
name in a sector or subsector file, and they seem to work fine, though
a person\'s selection is much preferred).

OK, so "official" status has been taken away from Paranioa Press.
I don\'t mind that -- it certainly wasn\'t the highest quality material.
What angers me is that GDW should have said this publicly *years* ago,
rather than leading us all on to beleive that these books still had
approval.  As far as I can recall, neither GDW nor DGP has ever
published anything that actively contradicted PP.  So what were we
supposed to think?
 
Incidentally -- if PP has gone, what about all the Far Frontiers
adventures published by FASA?  Many of these were written by the
Highly-Revered-Brothers-Keith, so Miller and Fugate may well want to
retain them as official.  Unfortunately, they are closely linked with
the PP books.  Look in _Trail_of_the_Sky_Raiders_ and see how the
Trelyn Domain straddles Coos Subsector in the Vanguard Reaches and
Jungleblut Subsector in the Far Frontiers.  Has there suddenly been
a mass exodus of Trelyn citizens into the Frontiers as the Reaches
disappear in a puff of dogma?  WHAT IS GOING ON SPINWARD OF THE
IMPERIUM?
 
I agree wholeheartedly with George William Herbert when he calls for
a clear statement of official policy from GDW as to what old material
is still valid and what has been thrown away, otherwise players
everywhere will continue struggling to rationalize all the numerous
inconsistencies that keep cropping up.  What makes matters worse is
that GDW seems to have become excruciatingly bad at checking its latest
works before publication.

  Sorry, none that are finished. But since I\'m in dire need of a set of plans
for a Chrysantemum DE before the 17 of July I\'ll do my best to have a those
finished by then.

understanding that approved never meant official anyhow, just that you
could use it if you wished.  Note that parts of Paranoia\'s Scouts and
Assasins and Merchants and Merchandice were both superceeded (at least in
part) by later GDW books.  This basically gave you a choice on which to
use and certainly if you were established under the earlier stuff you
would not want to change.  The fact that SORAG is mentioned in the later
GDW stuff certainly means that the SORAG manual still has some revalence. 
Also the subsectors which came out of Paranoia are probably still used.

As for GDWs reluctance to make an official statement, it seems to me
pretty natural.  After all any set of roleplaying rules can only serve as
a guide not the ultimate source of knowledge for any situation.  All rules
sets have ambiguities and errors (unfortunately too many in recent GDW
stuff, but they do seem to be working on it and at least they are aware of
the problem) and judges have to make interpretations.  An announcement
would upset a judges ability to tailor his campaign to his ideas and erode
a judges authority in general; those are the last things GDW would want.
Personally I\'ve never set any of my campaigns inside the Imperium and I\'ve
frequently made up new skills to cover characters upbringing or special
situations.  I even added a new character trait at one point to cover how
I was handling Psionics.  I also used major wounds to age characters not
time.  At any rate so long as the judge lets each player know how these
changes affect him he shouldn\'t be restricted by official pronouncements.

The deckplan is impressive, it looks almost identical in style to the one
presented in the Vargr & Vilani supplement. 

What I would like to know is what package are you using to create them, and 
do you have clippable images for items such as low berths?

(BTW the plan is available via the FTP site in /pub/traveller/misc as
deckplan.VA13.Z.uu or TypeVA13.ps)

Now would also be a good time to mention the re-orginization of the
FTP site: I have gotten tired of having over 120 files in one directory, and
I have put many of the files in sub-directories, leaving only 1990 bundles, 
the table of contents and README in the main directory. The following are the
sub-directories now used:

1987 or articles.1987           1987 articles (bun01-bun07) 
1988 or articles.1988           1988 articles (bun08-bun17)

As far as I know (and I remind you I\'m just another
ignorant fan) everything the HRBK has ever thought
or breathed is official -- at least these are the
vibes I have gotten from Miller and Fugate at
various gaming conventions.  I would expect (and
this again not "official" :-] but only my guess)
that anything that DGP does in the future would
match what the Keiths did.  If they don\'t, we can
all flame them.
 
>What makes matters worse is

I just found out the other day (but didn\'t realize
it was important enough to post) that GDW has hired
Gary Thomas of DGP as their "MegaTraveller
Consultant" for Challenge.  He told me that GDW has
two goals in mind:  first, to make sure the stuff
matches, and second to make sure that the stuff is
interesting.  He told me (I\'m not sure I\'m supposed
to repeat this, either) that Challenge has missed
both of those targets pretty badly in the past, and
GDW wants to fix it.

     Ummm...okay.  I wrote a little function that generates a random
number from 1 to any positive non-zero integer (I call the function
die()), so I use the rules that were in the Referee\'s Manual.  Namely:

          Roll D6.  If odd, PopM = D6 + 4 (re-roll results of 10);
                    If even, PopM = D6 - 1 (re-roll results of 5).

     In the course of this little task, I\'ve found that having a random
function that simulates the roll of a single die to be quite useful.

 >Hope this helps

     Yeah, it did, actually.  Thank you.

     Tell me about it.  I had a reason for not using the language
generation tables, actually.  I wanted names that were pronounceable.
One time, one of my players ran a Zhodani character and generated his
name from the Zhodani Alien Module.  We ended up just calling him "Bob."
I\'ve got another player who creatively mispronounces words with a fair
regularity (not *deliberately*, mind--they just come out that way),
frequently with hilarious results.  I don\'t want to give him any more
trouble than necessary.  For instance, I decreed that Archduke Brzk\'s
(of the Antares Domain) name was pronounced "Berzerk."  ;-)  Damn\'
Vargr names...

     Actually, I\'ve had a limited amount of success with what I\'ve
managed to come up with (even though my compiler sometimes chokes on
it a little--ghods, I hate ANSI).  It needs some smoothing, though (and
maybe a better algorithm), since it still comes up with winners like
"Savuvu."  ;-)  Sounds like a little-known make of car, doesn\'t it?

     "Hey, the 1116 Savuvu\'s are in early this year..."

  Claris CAD on a MacintoshSE with 4Megs. Most of the time it took to do the
VA13 plans was spent setting up a library of irisvalves, chairs, freshers, 
beds etc, etc.

  The most useful feature I found in the CAD program was the ability to fill a
closed object with squares of a certain size. It is originally ment to
be used for drawing patterns that indicate the material if a certain part, but
it is perfect for doing the 1.5m squares :-)

  (I imagine that it\'s a standard function in CAD programs)

  In the Rebellion Sourcebook, the part on the Factions of the Rebellion, there
is talk about a table of \'friends and enemies\'. Have anyone out there actually
seen such a creature?

Blunder #2:
  According to the Ref\'s Manual, MesonScreens draws a unholy amount of power.
In a design example of by Joe Fugate (TD 11 or TD 12, I think) where he remakes
the old Regal Class BC from TCS, he gives it a MesonScreen that is supposed to
draw 0.9 MW/kl of craft volume, this would be about 900,000 MW. And this is the
figure given in the text, *but in the table in the article it is reduced to 
90,000 MW* (The powerplant would never in any way be able to support 900,000MW).
  BTW, the article seemed to use the latest version of the design system,
including all erratas, even the \'/50 if over 50\' rule for gunners and bridge
crew.

  When I checked with High Guard (Yes, I know, I\'m a anacronism. But I still
treat the old books as \'default\' when MegaTraveller don\'t make sense) I got a
figure of about 180,000 MW (One enerypoint equals 250MW).

  So here I have 3 opinions about how much power a mesonscreen requires, and
they differ by a factor of ten, sheesh! Is there a errata that I have missed
that divides the energy for mesonscreens by 10 and not only the optimized meson
screens?

  (\'Shattered Ships of the Fighting Imperium\' seems to have been using the 
very high figures from the Ref\'s Manual. But those designs break against the 
erratas, and even against the vehicle design rules in several ways.
   Example: Bay missile battery rounds: According to one of the erratas, 100t
bays have a batteryrnd of 100missiles and 50t 50 missiles, yet the designs give
the number of missiles in a battery round, and the numbers are far to low.) 

Blunder #3: \'The case of the Chameleon Planets\'
  In the library data sections of \'The Early Adventures\' the UPP\'s of Deneb
and Exile/Usani are listed. The Deneb sector was recently featured in the
Digest, with UPP\'s and everything.
  Guess what, they don\'t match! :-(

(A player in my campaign also claimed that Antiquity isn\'t on the correct spot
 as it was given in Imperial Encyclopedia. I suspect that he is wrong about that
 one but I havn\'t had time to check it out yet.)

Class: Bounty Hunter
Name:  Cpt. Tad McBad       UPP: AB78C6    Terms:  3   Age: 37

Skills:
Pilot-3, Ships Boat-2, Pistol-2, Rifle-2, Sabre-2, Grav Vehicals-1,
Combat Engineering-1, Hand Battle Computer-1, Brawling-1, Vacc Suit-1,
Gunnery-1, Disquise-2, Streetwise-3, Stealth-2.

History:
McBad graduated college with honors and went through NOTC.  After college,
McBad attended Imperial Flight School.  He spent four years in the navy working
as a pilot aboard a destroyer and later as a fighter pilot onboard a light
carrier.  He then transferred to the marines and finished there as a drop-pilot
and combat troop.  After eight years with the marines, he left the service and
took a job with the Security firm of Interstar LIC.  His main function with
Interstar was to retrieve those who were lost.  Frequently, his services were
hired out to local governments who had lost a prisoner.

Decorations:
MCG-1, MCUF-1, 3 Combat Commands, 4 Combat Service Ribbons

Description:
The left handed McBad, when seen, wears a marine style Combat Pilot Armor.  It
is much like the standard Imperial combat dress, with a few exceptions.  The
gloves are much thinner and less protective, as to allow the pilot better
feeling of the boat\'s controls.  It also has a modified helmet which has larger
bulges on either side that contains the extra electronics for the Ship HUD\'s,
and troop monitors.

Mannerisms:
While being extremely aggressive in his trade, McBad is relatively quiet.  He
is not a heavy conversationalist and maintains a professional attitude even
when not hunting down targets.  When it comes to capture he is reasonably
creative in his methods, though if the target is wanted dead or alive, he is
very quick to choose the former, as a dead victim is easier to get to come
along.  He suffers from flashbacks as do many combat experienced people.

   Devious Solutions for your Complex Problems

   "You have a problem...  I have a plan"

He is notorious for getting into a hopeless situation and thinking his way out
of it.  He is much like an expert chess player, able to think many moves ahead
of his opposition.

He joined the marines straight out of high school, he took it as an opportunity
to see the universe and to learn all that he could learn from the School of
Hard Knocks.  His natural leadership and talents quickly got him to OCS and
he became an officer.  The Marines bored him, unless he was able to be applying
his tactics in battle somewhere.  Out-witting the enemy was his primary
concern.  He was transferred to the Commandos where his antics lead to some
disciplinary actions, which he was able to talk his way out of.  But after
serving 16 years, it was mutually decided that he could do better away from
the service and he resigned his commission as 1-Lt, honorably, and entered
the private sector.

He quickly achieved the capital and backing to start up his own free trader.
Using a standard type A2 Far Trader, Anton was able to travel about making his
fortune and most importantly his fame from place to place.

Decorations:
6 Combat Service Ribbons, 3 Combat Commands, 1 MCUF.

Special Duties:
Commando School, Instructor at Commando School, OCS.

Description:
Physically Fit and moderately handsome, though some battle scars are present.

Mannerisms:
Anton is EXTREMELY arrogant.  He is quick to quote:

"I am so good, I do not need an ego"  or  "Egos are nothing but mere crutches
for the mentally handicapped."

I think the point is that a lot of people like their campaigns to maintain
consistency with the "official" GDW universe so that they can easily
integrate any new materials that are published.  It\'s a question of being
practical, and not sycophantic as it might appear.
 
At least, that\'s *my* excuse.  :-)

Either I have been spotting some more blunders, or I am suffering from
double vision.  Judge for yourself.
 
First, the data for Massilia Sector in the TML archives.  There are two
entries for the same hex:
 
> Rellam        0720 A100321-G    Ni Va              924 Li K9 III M5 D
> Amaya         0720 A100321-G    Ni Va              924 Li F5 V
 
Did this sector get published recently in the Driveller\'s Teachest?  If
so, that issue hasn\'t made it across the Pond yet.  Can someone set the
record straight?
 
Second, the Vilani & Vargr book.  Has anyone noticed in the map of the
Vargr Extents how there are two sectors named Gotsdzo and two named
Arzul.  Now, I know the Vargr are not renowned for their large-scale
organization, but this is carrying things to silly extremes...

When I started playing around with the design rules (prior to getting a copy 
of the second set of official errata, I noticed the incongruously large amount
of energy needed to use a meson screen.

   >   When I checked with High Guard (Yes, I know, I\'m a anacronism.  <
   > But I still treat the old books as \'default\' when MegaTraveller   <

So I checked with High Guard, too, (you\'re not the only dinosaur), and 
decided that the table would be consistent with High Guard if you divided 
all the energy costs for meson screen by four, and I so noted in the margin
of that page.  Then I got the second errata sheet, and found all the optimized
screens divided by ten, and decided (probably after reading the Regal rebuild
article, too), that all the meson screens should get the same treatment,
and noted that correction in the margin as well.  It\'s not official, so far as
I know, but if anyone is keeping track of these things, it is what I did with
the several large ship designs that were among the packages I uploaded last
week. (Or whenever it was.)

   >   So here I have 3 opinions about how much power a meson screen   <

   As I say, that isn\'t yet part of the errata, unless there is a third 
official set that I haven\'t seen, but it is what I have been using.  As you
note, Fighting Barges uses the unrevised figures, meaning that no one has
better than a meson screen-1 or so (as I recall--I bought it, but I read it
once and threw it down in disgust, thinking that I could do better without
much trouble).  Why bother carrying a screen like that?  It won\'t stop
a real meson gun (i.e., spinal) ever, and the little ones not often.

Another Blunder (#4):

     One you didn\'t mention:  Look carefully at the rule that allows you to
dispense with a vehicle commander.  Subtracting the cps for the sensors
from the total cps and dividing by the computer multiple means that the result
will only be between 0 and 1 if the cp of all non-sensor components is less
than the computer multiple.  For TL15, and Comp 9 (120 mult), this works out
to 800KCr (less for a smaller computer), which means if you carry a fusion
plant as big as 4 kL (only 24MW) you cannot possibly eliminate the commander.
Why bother having a rule for this if the only vehicle simple enough to apply
it is a motorcycle?? It is really intended for combat vehicles, since any
civilian vehicle can get by with only a driver for crew...but it can never
work out.  No change to this is in the official errata, but clearly one needs
to be...

Another Blunder? (#5)

     In the trade and commerce tables, why do passengers move preferentially
from high-tech to low-tech worlds?  Look at the rules.  Maybe they are going
on vacation, but they would probably want to come back in roughly the same 
numbers in which they go, wouldn\'t they?.  Same thing with cargo...high tech
worlds inundate low tech worlds with cargo...I can see where they would want
it, but where is the money coming from?  Why should there be tech level 
effects on the price of speculative goods that represent raw materials?  Most
of the stuff a non-industrial or agricultural world is exporting is probably
food or minerals, and I can\'t see paying a premium for gold that came from
an asteroid as ooposed to gold that was panned from a stream by a TL3 49\'er.
Any comments?  Also...it still looks to me like the sizes of major and minor
cargos should be 1d*10 and 1d*5 respectively, rather than 1d+10 and 1d+5.  I
would really like to hear some more on this subject.

The officila policy when I was working in the Traveller universe was that
only GDW rules books and supplements were official. Even material
published in the Journal was only approved, not official. Marc defined
the difference as approved materials being good enough that he would use
them himself. GDW has also tightened its approval policy over the years.
When we started working with them on HIgh Passage, Their policy was
rather liberal. This changed as time went on, especially when a certain
person, who is no longer with GDW and shall remain nameless, was given
resposibility of approving licensed material. This person was also VERY
slow in getting back to you, and frequently lost manuscripts. Now try
to publish your magazine on time. HINT: Publishing stuff is a job, and
looses it\'s novelty after about three months. If you\'re lucky, you
will break even financially.

Also in the old days, GDW was more liberal in giving licenses. Marc\'s
theory was that TSR refused to give licenses for D&D, which resulted
in a lot of "generic" material being produced. Marc\'s idea was that by
licensing products he could retain some control over published materials,
make a little money (and I mean damned little) from licesees, and help
promote approved materials. He helped us a great deal.

This may be my last note. I am leaving the University of Illinois
next month. If all goes well, and the USAF gets its funding, I will
be employed at Air University, the Air Force\'s graduate schools,
in Alabama this fall. I don\'t know if they have bitnet/internet there
or not. If they do, you folks will be hearing from me. If not, its
been fun.

Yow!  I never noticed this, Alan.  When I grabbed the sector data from
GEnie, I just sucked down the files and ftp\'ed them to Sunbane.  This
is a \'legit\' screw-up for the NEW Massilia UWP file.  I have the same
dup in my original copy of the file.  I don\'t know whether the pre-
assassination version of Massilia sector has the same goof in it, but
I\'m going to check.  Metlay asked for the pre-shattered-imerium versions
of Massilia, Corridor, and Deneb anyway, so I might as well suck down
all three while I\'m at it.  We\'ll see if the dup exists in both files.

I recently had a "conference" of sorts with some of my players.  They 
felt that we needed to change the nature of the game.  For one thing, they
pointed out that some of my adventures were "too narrow"--there was only
one solution and they had to follow a precise course of events to get
things done, or fail utterly.  While I don\'t think the problem is as
severe as some of them felt, I do think they may have pointed out a problem
with my approach to GMing and I decided to look into other options.

(Other problems are less serious.  They want to have more alien characters.
I am willing to do this; it is just that there are less complications when
all or most of the characters are human.)

Now, one of my first thoughts after this conference was along the lines of
"So!  The little darlings want more open-ended adventures, eh?" combined 
with a laugh that would make the Joker wet his pants.  (I already have
some truly funny and disturbed ideas...like an assassination attempt that
will involve singing Chip \'n Dale robots who explode after they do their
"I\'m Chip...I\'m Dale..." routine.)  More important, though, is that the
problem seems to have stemmed from overplanning.  At the same time, I do
not want to simply leave everything open to chance because I have a feeling
that the adventures will simply fall apart if I do.  Does anyone have
suggestions, advice, interesting stories, etc. about how to set up an
adventure with a general scenario, with enough detail that it will be
fun and original, but not so much details that your players are locked into
a single path that they must figure out and follow?  What do people plan
and write down in advance...what do they leave to chance...and so on.

Thanks in advance.

     It *could* be a problem.  It depends quite a bit on how you handle
things.  Back in the dim and misty past (when dinosaurs still walked the
land and I was a freshman) I played AD&D (yeah, I know--hey, I was a
*freshman*, I didn\'t know any better) under a DM who practically wrote
a novel for each scenario.  I could live with this, but the real
problem was that if we deviated from his planned plot the slightest bit
he would *yank* us back on his track.  There were other things about his
style (and his personal changes to the game system) that I didn\'t like,
but that one thing was what I most resented.

     It might be a good idea for you to loosen up a little.  You\'d be
surprised how strange things can get if you let your players have a
little freedom.  Be ready to roll with the punches, though.

     More non-human player characters, or NPCs?  Personally, I don\'t
like having to run with a bunch of non-human NPCs, but I\'ll let my
players do whatever they want.

 >(I already have some truly funny and disturbed ideas...like an

     Nice idea.  I like it.  Has style.  Yeah, you *are* disturbed...
I like that in a GM...  ;-)

     Oh, my...  Let me tell you what I do.  I come to an average session
with a fairly clear idea of where the players are at the moment (the
initial state).  I also have two or three vague ideas for things the
adventurers might want to do.  Everything else is up to them.  I use
the question "what do you do?" a lot.  What do I write down in advance?
Not a damn\' thing.  Details?  Easy; I make them up as I go (sometimes
I take notes, since my memory fades pretty quickly, and I have to
send summaries to my long-distance player [one of my old roomies] in
Oregon).  What do I do when the players decide to go haring off to
bumbletucky, nowhere near any of my good ideas?  No problem, just make
up something new, *fast*.  If you need time to think of something,
there are several things you can do.  Calling a munchie-Coke-facilities
break is one of my favorites, though I also sometimes stall by getting
the players in trouble with the local law...  ;-)  Heck, one time,
that was how I got things started.  There are very few things that will
make a bunch of players more co-operative than impounding their ship...

     Oh, yeah, if you need just a *little* time to make a decision
(like, "Do I nova the sun for snicks and grins, or not?") roll some
dice.  Look at the number you rolled.  Then do whatever you want,
ignoring the roll.  It\'s not fudging, since it was a purposeless roll
in the first place.  However, your players don\'t know that.  Try
throwing random happenings at the players, making sure that they seem
to be things that bear little or no relation to what they really are.
What does this do?  Well, with a correctly applied sense of humor, they
make the game more fun (in my opinion, *everything* goes better with
humor).

I have a photographic memory and a sick streak a mile wide, so I wing it.
(I think Dow\'s figured that out by now. |->) I generally find that the best
way to run an "adventure" is to set up an overall history line that\'s 
internally consistent for a period of several years before,. during, and
after the campaign, and let the characters "fit" into it and maybe alter
it as they go. Once that\'s done, and I have a consistent list of names
for NPCs and places, I just go with the flow. Once in a while, when I 
make up something really brilliant (like Hector, the robot who ain\'t), 
I note down only WHAT THE PLAYERS HAVE SEEN and then fill in the details
they don\'t know yet, later. As a campaign build in time and complexity,
the structure becomes more filled-in and realistic....

I just had an interesting set of experiences in this vein, actually.
last Friday night, my roommate saw that I was feeling glum about another
weekend in Tennessee, so he invited me to a D&D game with his friends. 
His buddy who was supposed to GM didn\'t feel liuke it, though, so I 
volunteered. Half an hour to generate characters, and we were off, with
me making it up as I went for about six hours. Afterward, I heard from
my roomate that all concerned had had the time of their lives. The very
next night, we went to another game, one reffed by a friend of one of
the people in the Friday game (a novice gamer). He had everything planned
out ahead of time, to the last detail, and all attempts to vary from his
path were met with smirking refusal or blank looks. The novice began to 
fidget after about an hour, as she suddenly realized that she wasn\'t 
enjoying herself. My roommate and I left in disgust halfway through the
game, and we aren\'t planning to go back. The ref is very upset, and wants
to know "why we weren\'t cooperating."

Think I should tell him? |->

do surface and radiation damage, and 
there is no defense against them

Blunder#7: In the second errata sheet, 100 ton missile bays up to TL21 and
weapons factor D are included, but there
is no column on the combat table as revised by the first errata sheet that
covers missile-D.

Blunder#8: The reason I was looking at the errata sheets in the first place.
There are no weights or costs given for grenade launchers, recoiless rifles,
or rocket launchers anywhere in book 1,
book 3, or the two official errata 
sheets.

Blunder #9: On page 15 of the Player book there is a "Homeworld Limitation"
rule for skills.  The intent of it may be otherwise, but the actual wording
implies that most military characters
would be barred from learning weapons skills by their homeworld law levels.

I had posed the problem of coming up with ideas for adventures a few
days ago.  I recently discovered a truly loony file I had saved from 
alt.cult.movies and then modified it slightly so that it could be used
for generating titles for adventures, stories, etc.  It is totally
insane, but I think some people will find it amusing and/or useful.
Obviously, some terms must be modified (Frankenstein = "Any mad scientist"  
and Dracula or Vampire = "Any powerful, seductive, life-destroying being
with lots of interesting psionic powers/neato high tech devices") but
I think it will come in handy for some folks.

Here it is....


YES! it\'s here at last! the AMAZING Title-O-Matic!!!!

Now you to can create your own exploitation movie titles in the safety
of your own home!!

IT\'S QUICK! IT\'S EASY! IT\'S FUN!

Just pick one from each column, insert "of the" between the first two
and you\'re ready to put Troma Pictures out of business!

Roll three times (once for each column), using a thirty-sided die, if
you wish to randomly generate titles for adventures, stories, etc.  

Bonus features for advanced users!  Use multiple entries from column 2!
* indicates "of the" not required.  ** means you can use this in column 3
too (and make it plural, if desired)!

ROLL AGAIN means roll again twice, using the second rolled result as the

It also fails to increase the number of extra damage rolls/critical hits
based on UCP and ship hull size.  Disintegrators ratings only go as
far as E, thus they get at most 5 extra damage rolls and can only get
automatic critical hits against small ships (I don\'t remember the sizes,
but quite a small ship avoids the automatic critical hits).  A PA spinal
mount can easily have a rating of Q,R,S or T (and it doesn\'t require a TL
over 15!), these cause 15 extra damage rolls and will critical hit ships
of quite large size 100kT is critical hitted (yukky english there) by a
PA-T.  Of course armour reduces things a lot (it require armour factor-100
or so to avoid these bonous crits from a Meson-T, which wasn\'t considered
legal until fighting ships came along :-)

Once again, I\'ve been working on creating scenarios rather than detailed
plots (this seems to be the main problem with my GMing at the moment, and
for what it is worth it might be worth noting that this seems to be a 
difference between GMing and writing--when you GM, it\'s better to wing
things, when you write, it\'s better to have them planned out in advance).

Anyway, I recently wrote up a table for random encounters.  The actual
people encountered are pretty mundane--01 to 99 scale with the results
being various standard Traveller archtypes like Army characters, etc., 
plus things like "old enemy" or "famous celebrity"--but I thought the
basic opening lines might amuse people.  The table is as follows...

   01-15: "Help me!  They\'re after me!"
   16-30: "I have a problem.  Could you eliminate it for me?"
   31-45: "Could you deliver this package for me?"
   46-60: "I need you to find someone for me."
   61-75: "Someone has stolen my property.  I want it back."
   76-90: "I know the location of something valuable.  Want in on the
           action?"
   91-00: Other (or roll again)

Just for fun, we might want to consider how many adventure movies start
with something like these lines.  Suggestions for the "other" category
are welcome, by the way.

Enjoy.

     My only other comment is: I can easily use the raw character
set-ups, but I enjoy more the "Characters", as in "Boy, he was some
kind-a character, wasn\'t he!" I know this is harder to quantify, but I
think its the kind of information that really adds to creative game

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                 Bertram Smyth
     UPP=686BAC Age= 22

     The third son of Sir Anglus Rostern Smyth, Earl of Olaie Province
     (on Ffudn), Bertram, or Bert, as he prefers to be called (!*Never
     call  him Bertie*!), grew up in relative luxury. He attended
     private schools  which stressed social graces and politicical
     ideology rather than  science or math (other than accounting, at
     which he was very good!)  From early childhood on he had lessons
     in dance, music (he\'s a passable  pianist), fencing and, well,
     charm. Upon reaching age 18 he was  enrolled in the prestegious
     Imperial Sylean University where he studied  Diplomacy and Law,
     these being determined by his family to be in his  "best
     interest". Bert decided on his own to Minor in Acting, much to
     the disgust of his family.

     Then, disaster struck: In his last year of undergraduate studies
     his family business was devistated by a series of Aslan raids
     that culminated with his family declareing  bankrupcy and
     defaulting on serveral major loans. To assist the family  Bert
     cashed in his return ticket and sent the money home. He told them
     he would "find alternative transportation"... So far (122-1119)
     he has made it as far as Rhylanor, mainly by taking odd jobs on
     irregular passenger liners. He has come to enjoy this `vagabond\'
     existance. He stands 1.9 meters tall, is good looking (without
     being striking), has a small scar on his left cheek (from a
     fencing match that got out of hand), and is very outgoing.

copy of Striker to do a few cross checkes, and noticed the answer to something
that had disturbed me previously.  It would appear from the MegaTraveller design
rules that Mass Driver guns are not cost effective because they are such huge 
energy hogs.  However...all other gun rules are completely compatible with
Striker.  Rates of Fire are doubled from Striker\'s "per 30 second" basis to
a "per minute" basis.  On P.78 of MegaTraveller Book 2, ROF for MD guns is given
as 1 for the base energy amount.  If you cehck Striker, you will notice that
that you calculate the same base energy, for a rate of fire of 1 *per second*.
I suppose that this was supposed to be the same, and should be noted by anyone
working on this sort of stuff.

This means that any previously designed vehicles with mass driver guns (and I
ahve at least one in the collection I uploaded previously) should have their
rates of fiore multiplied by 60.  This may or may not hold true for 101
Vehicles (I haven\'t checked yet).

An error noted on Vehicles Part 4:  The "Hoplite" TL15 grav tank is 
displacement 4, not 6.

Does anyone else care about this sort of stuff?

Cougar Fire Support Vehicle TL10

     The Cougar is a member of the Tiger family of infantry fighting 
vehicles, and is the only major variation designed with no provision for 
carrying infantry. The vehicle is designed to provide indirect fire support 
in a variety of combat conditions.  Because large scale use of grav vehicles 
generally leads to an amorphous combat situation with no secure rear areas 
for siting of artillery, the Cougar carries the same weight of armor as the 
remainder of the vehicles in the family. The turret has been enlarged from 5% 
to 10% of the base vehicle size to accomodate the large mass driver gun. The 
Tiger family is particularly popular among mercenary units because of the 
comparatively low cost.  Maintenance compatability with the range of Tiger 
vehicles is also a popular feature.  The machine gun is manned by the vehicle 
commander.

Our GM Gerry has the perfect set of dice for this; They are white cubes with
no numbers. Pick them up, roll them, and do something based on the outcome...

He doesn\'t use them with us anymore (because we discovered the secret) but
he still uses them when running tournaments.

Back in his D&D days they were called the \'search for secret doors and
traps\' dice... :-)

Here are some useful opening scenario stuff that I\'ve used in the past.
(By publishing it here, where the members of my current party can see it,
I\'ll be encouraged not to reuse it.)

"You wake up. It\'s dark, and VERY cramped and stuffy, and there\'s somebody\'s
elbow in your back and a knee in your face. Feeling about with your free hand,
you confirm--YES! You and your party are inside a shipping crate!"

"The sun in your eyes is glaringly bright. You feel like you\'ve been kicked
through a wall. There\'s a salty taste in your mouth, and you\'re covered with
sand and seaweed. You dimly hear the crash of nearby waves. All you can recall
is this horrible dream about a really ROUGH water landing...."

"There\'s blood on your hands and mouth, you have no idea where the hell you
are, and in the distance you hear a crowd of angry voices screaming, "FIND
THE MONSTER! KILL IT! BURN IT!" (OK, that wasn\'t Traveller... it was an opener
for an obnoxious teenager in an old fantasy campaign who "wanted to run a 
lycanthrope oh please please pleeeeeeze...." So I rolled up a perfectly normal
character. "But what about being a Lycnathrope?" "Oh, you mean your weird
fainting spells on nights when there\'s a full moon?" |-> )

On a somewhat more staid note:

"The flash in the sky is horrible in its stark whiteness. Moments later, there
is a wailing siren across the Starport. People begin to run every which way;
there\'s been an accident of some kind at the High Port, and they may need help
up there! What do you do?"

"The dancer wheels closer and closer to you as the song builds to a climax.
She is writhing, undulating, her flimsy gown soaked in sweat... a lovely
sight, it it weren\'t for that ceremonial sword she keeps waving around...."

And then there are these opening lines:

"Here\'s another one that\'s still alive, Pa! Better bring the axe!"
"Pardon me, would you please hold this? Thanks!" (a smoking grenade)
"Engine room reporting. We seem to, er, have a problem."
"Have you heard the Word, Brother?"
or the ever-useful
"Man, what a party that was last night--hey, WHO are YOU?!"

Hoplite Grav Tank TL15

     The Hoplite emphasizes protection and small size in favor of endurance.  
The main armament is unusual--2 fusion-Z guns are carried coaxially in the 
turret, for an increase in the total rate of fire.  The pulse lasers are 
mounted in sponsons on either side of the hull, and are intended for short 
range antipersonnel use.

to get good at vehicle design makes them very useful.  As I discovered
when I started designing starships, there is a big difference between
designs by someone who knows how things work, as opposed to how
the GDW people THINK things work.  I haven\'t had time to look
closely at most of them yet, but I have all 100k of them saved.  The
designs I think are most useful are the trucks, etc.  (Military vehicles
you can generally plan ahead of time, but you never know when the
stats of an ordinary civilian vehicle might be needed...)

Here\'s another NPC for the character lists...

Personal History

During the period Timothy was still a fetus, his mother was taking
an addictive and harmful drug which was to forever shape the course
of his life. The drug, Cyrspasium hydrilexate 4117/82, called
"Spaz" or "Curse" on the streets, was a popular hallucinagen for
the times, and is still marketed in vast quantities by the
underworld. Its effects on the unborn, however, have proven fatal
in most cases due to a complete collapse of the immune system. Tim
was found to be dependent on the drug at birth, and on the brink
of death due to the unchecked syptoms of the common cold.   
Through state-supplied therapy, the addiction in both mother and
child was cured. However, as a result of early complications, Tim
has a very unstable immune system, and thus extremely poor health.
In fact, the cold that he was born with has never subsided, and he
has lived with it and a number of other afflictions throughout his
life.

Tim\'s mother committed suicide only a year after his birth, and his
father was never discovered as the pregnancy was a result of rape.
Tim was placed in an orphan home until the age of seven when he was
adopted by a cousin of his mother\'s, Steve Crawford. Although Steve
was but ten short years older than Tim, he was allowed to foster
the child on the grounds of blood-relation.

Tim stayed with Steve Crawford and three other freinds in a small
urban apartment of Ridgecrest\'s poor district on Vili for four
years until the group broke up after Steve Crawford was killed in
a gangland war. Tim abruptly dropped out of primary school, but he
tested into secondary school and attended Ridgecrest 2ndary. The
experience was marked by violence and feuding with rival gang
members, yet despite the distractions, he did manage to stay in
school, and for his senior year he ranked in the top five percent
of his class.

After graduation from Ridgecrest, he applied for admission to the
Imperial Academy of Science and Medicine, and to Columbus College
of Vili with the idealistic notion that if accepted to either
school, he would be able to find a way to restore his immune system
to full functioning order. His applications were refused on both
counts. Then, through inside connections, he managed to secure for
himself a spot in the work-training program at Ridgecrest
Scientific Labs. There he studied Computers and Gravitics, but was
offered no opportunities for advancement. After four years he
reapplied for admission to IASM and Columbus, and applied to Indi
College of Biological Science and the Vili Spaceport Authority for
a job interview. Again, on all counts, he was denied acceptence.

That same year he was jailed for unlawful resistance of arrest
which constituted of simply running from two watch officers for no
apparent reason when called over to be questioned. The maximum
sentence of a year was imposed by the court.

At an age of twenty-three years, finally in desperation as to the
seemingly ill-direction his life was taking, Tim enlisted and was
accepted into the Indi Armed Forces. He was placed in Infantry
Recon at the request of his Recruiting Department and served a full
four years of training which encompassed primarily Mechanics and
Recon.

In 1105 he started his second term of service as an advisor for the
planetary watch on Vili in the chaotic districts of Ridgecrest.

     Unfortunately, I am missing a few entries.  Specifically, I need the

     Thanks in advance!

     It ought to be an interesting campaign, as I\'m trying to make sure
that the new players don\'t know that the Emperor will be assassinated soon.
Thus, the more "real" I can make the Imperium seem to them, the more impact
the news of the assassination and civil war will have on them.  I\'m also
going to be sure that one of the players is working more-or-less directly
for the Emperor, such that he will be forced into making a decision about
which faction to support. :-)

RHYLANOR/RHYLANOR (0306-A434934-F)                      Date: 147-1109 (delayed)
    Imperial naval forces and attached army and marine units have retaken Calit
(Vilis 0705), according to a highly placed source at the admiralty. News of the
victory was delayed because the local commander did not feel he could spare any
vessels to carry the news out of the system until recently.
    No reports of the battle, or of any casualties among the forces involved
are available.

LANTH/LANTH (0109-A879533-B)                                    Date: 241-1109
    The commander of the Imperial 193rd fleet has officially declared the mop-
up of the Sword World forces in the Lanth system to be completed, after months
of heavy fighting.
    "Reports of atrocities against the civilian populace are unfounded" the
fleet public relations officer declared in a press release. "The enemy forces
were too heavily involved in fighting us to be able to have committed any
crimes against the locals." The officer went on to note that rumors of
atrocities are common after any battle because of the high degree of emotion
generated.
    No information is available on casualties, either military or civilian, but
a highly placed source indicated that the 193rd has requested large numbers of
ground reinforcements, indicating heavy casualties, at least in its ground
forces.

POROZLO/RHYLANOR (0306-A434943-F)                               Date: 231-1109
    Acording to unofficial reports, a mojor battle is taking place at Rhylanor,
involving both fleet and planetary elements of Imperial and colonial forces.

POROZLO/RHYLANOR (0306-A434943-F)                               Date: 239-1109
    Informed sources have revealed that major fleet and ground elements arrived
in this system last night, and are presently refuelling and refitting for
immediate transfer to Rhylanor, to reinforce imperial forces there.

    All Vargr forces allied with the Outworld Coalition have been instructed by
their supreme commander to cease hostilities and surrender to the Imperial
military or present themselves to a neutral power for internment.  Unconfirmed
rumor states the Vargr forces have withdrawn from the Coalition, and are now
negotiating for a separate peace agreement.
    Speculation is rampant in all governmental circles as to the ramifications
of this action, both with regard to the war and with regard to post-war
politics in the Vargr extents.

    A spokesman for the naval forces under command of Vice-Admiral Elphinstone
stated today theat a number of Vargr renegades are still at large in the
Spinward Marches, despite the best efforts of the navy to hunt down and destroy
them. These renegades are the remnants of military unites which refused to
surrender upon the withdrawal of the Vargr from the war.
    A spokesman reports that 90% of the Vargr forces have been dealt with, but
admits that a small core remains to threaten shipping in the region.

    In separate announcements issued today, the Imperium and the Zhodani Con-
sulate announced the cessation of hostilities between all belligerents, to
begin on 001-1111. Borders will be returned to the status quo ante bellum,
and all military forces have begun their withdrawal from opposing territories.
    Despite the fact that neither side acheived territorial gains, both the
Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate are claiming victory in their announcements.
The Fifth Frontier War is over.

    In a report made available today by usually reliable sources inside the
Imperial government, it was revealed that in the last weeks before the signing
separate peace between the Imperium and the Sword Worlds, several deep-
penetration raids on the industrial worlds of Gram and Sacnoth severely damaged
major naval installations and manufacturing capacity.
    The Imperial government is reported to have rejected requests from Sword
World negotiators for financial and technical assistance in rebuilding the
ruined facilities.

No, but since mercs won\'t serve there, the Imperial Marines have to go there
instead. (To their utter annoyance).

I think this planet made it to the second place on the players \'Top 10 Planets
we loved to *leave*\', though. :-)

Even MegaTraveller refers to the 400 ton Patrol Cruiser.  It all depends on
what sort of cruiser you mean.  "Cruiser means whatever I point at and say
\'cruiser\'." :-)

How close do they have to be, to be a binary system?  In Book 6, Scouts, the
companion star in a binary or trinary system may be up to 6000 AU away from
the main star.  Even planetary orbits out to 367,711 million km (2,458 AU)
are listed.  Now, assuming the ship has 6G acceleration (which the Kinunir
hasn\'t), the time to travel that sort of distance is:

time	= 2*sqr(distance/acceleration)
	= 2*sqr(367,711*10**9 / 60)
	= 4951168 seconds
	= 57 days
	= a whole lot longer than doing it by jump.

Putting it another way, you use a jump even to get from one side of a big
system to another.  If the stars are far enough apart to count as two
separate systems, you don\'t use manoeuvre drive unless your jump is out.
If you do, expect to be doing it for a few months.

Lately I moved and I re-discovered volumes of information I compiled on
Traveller games.

Basically I\'ve re-sparked my interest but I\'m a little rusty these days and
all my materials are from 1986.  Bear with me for a while.

Way back then I was working on a program for the IBM PC for generating
characters and their personal effects.  It was back then that I discovered
differences between The Traveller Book and the old Booklets 1 through 3.
Has a new edition been put out?  Am I hopelessly out of date and are all
my questions to be routed to the historian?  ;-)

Despite my graying beard I hope to become involved around here since I
loved Traveller O so much back then.

By the way, has anyone around here been writing short stories about the
campaigns they\'ve run or participated in?  Sometimes that\'s a lot of fun.

  But I wrote it sometime mid-june. Wonder what kept it?
Did the xboat misjump? Did the rebellion break out? Did I mail it to 
traveller-request instead of traveller? Probably the third alternative.

  By the way, did anyone see the big ad in TD#20 about DGP\'s new \'journal\'.
It sure seems that they are taking over after the good old JTAS, even the news
file is there, but renamed from TNS to MoraWorldReview.

  This is probably good news for some and bad for some. Good for those who have
their campaigns behind the claw, bad for those who get left out in the cold in
some forsaken corner of the Imperium.

Josh:

My beard\'s greyer than yours, I betcha. |-> Welcome to the TML; my
name\'s Metlay, and I\'m the Group Historian (although my efficiency
is a lot higher when my books and I are in the same city, alas).
I can answer, or refer you to someone who can answer, most questions
about the game these days, although I won\'t adjudicate rules problems.

In a nutshell, since 1986, the aftermath of the Fifth Frontier War was
barely in its first decade when a bozo Archduke with delusions of 
grandeur put a bullet in the Emperor, and the whole house of cards 
came crashing down. The Imperium is a total mess right now, an admirable
parallel to the erratum-ridden and sloppy new rules system marketed by
GDW in 1987 as "MegaTraveller". Fortunately, a third-party licensee of
the rules called Digest Group Publications has patched a lot of the 
holes and produced some excellent supplementary material. The older 
"Traveller Classic" rules are now out of print and no longer supported
except in occasional pre-assassination adventures etc.

And as for stories, well, I\'ve been known to post a few now and again;
the problem is that I was sent out of town on a two-week research trip
and had to put my game on hold. That was in January, and I haven\'t been
able to get home yet. Argh.

is Robert Poole, I\'m a Physics major at MIT (going into my Jr. Year), and I\'ve
been playing Traveller on and off for about 7 years.  I just recently picked up
the MegaTraveller rules set, and I\'ve been trying to familiarize myself with
the rules.  I am currently working on a character generation program in C which
conforms to the MegaTraveller rules, and it is a PAIN.  I just ran into a
little problem which I need help solving.

One of the rules says that Vehicle skills are limited by homeworld tech level
and that weapon skills are limited by homeworld tech level and law level.
I can understand the need for this system, but it confuses an already arduous
task.  For example, if a player gets Gun Combat, and wants Energy Weapon, what
is the minimum tech level needed?  Energy Weapon encompasses both Fusion Gun
and Plasma Gun, but Plasma Guns are tech level 10 weapons, and Fusion Guns are
tech level 12!  (I got these tech levels out of the Referee\'s Companion.)

Is there, perhaps, a chart in one of the MegaTraveller books which I missed
which gives a rundown on the minimum tech level / tech code for each weapon
skill?  Barring that, could someone post a complete listing of the minimum
tech code (as given on page 13 of the player\'s manual, not to be confused with
the tech level) for weapon and vehicle skills?  The law code limitations are
straightforward enough -- they\'re given clearly on the bottom right of page 13.

Another bit of silliness:  When the rules say that law enforcers, pirates, and
rogues may choose weapon skills one law code lower than their homeworld\'s law
code, does that mean one numerical level lower or one descriptive level lower?
(Descriptive: "Low Law" as opposed to "Mod Law")  I should think descriptive
makes more sense, but you\'d be surprised what game designers have in mind.

Of course, this begs the question of how one treats military characters.  (And
I\'m not even going to begin dealing with the Advanced character generation!)
Do law codes apply to the various military services?  (I\'m referring to the 1st
six services, though "Scouts" is hardly militarized.)  Also, if you\'re drafted
into a service, especially one that wouldn\'t have been possible for your
character to enlist in, do the law and tech level restrictions still apply?

Thanks for your help in advance.  I\'ll be sure to post the shell archive of my
character generator once I\'m done.  The program, when complete, will generate
PC characters using a simple menu-based user interface.

     Gencon?  No, I generally avoid the whole state of Wisconsin during
Gencon (you can\'t be too sure).  Actually, I wouldn\'t mind going, but
there\'re too many gamer-dweebs there (you know, the kind of person who

     However, I *do* agree with this sentiment.  I *will* be in
Louisville, KY, during the weekend of 3-5 August for RiverCon.  If
anyone is going to be there, give me a call (I\'ll be staying in a room

  Hmm..., I\'ll have to try to get into this one.  Also, I would like to
suggest:

     450027  MEGATRAVELLER  (a 1 round tournament)

     Joe Fugate and Gary Thomas (of DGP) are planning to run this
     one.  If you haven\'t had the opportunity to game with them,
     this would be a good chance.  I\'m planning to play in this 
     one myself.

  TL-12 (The PGMP-12 is the first manportable energy weapon, (BTW the Plasmas at
TL10 and Fusions at TL12 is the artillery version. Skill in them is called
HighEnergy Weapons (I think, since the books ar at home))).
  But if this character wants to use a FGMP-15 he will get -3 on his skill-level
(minimum skill-0) since he is trying to use equippment that is above the TL he
got tought to use.

  Hopefully one descriptive level lower.

  I don\'t place *any* law restrictions on military, scout, pirate and noble
characters during generation. And I\'m suspicious about if techlevels should 
apply for those services that spans more than one world.

Sarge: "Right! Time to teach you people to use weapons! Everyone from Efate
	Law 0, Tech 13(?) line up for Energy Weapons training!"
Recruit: "Sir! I\'m from Knorbes, where do I go?"
Sarge: "KNORBES? Techlevel 2?????"
Recruit: "Yessir! I was drafted, sir!"
Sarge: "Ok, You go to the armory and get a shield a sword and a platemail..."

  Probably would there be TL restrictions for planetary armies (wet, dry and
COACC). Planetary and subsector navies etc, but I\'m not sure how this would be
implemented.

     The SPINWARD MARCHES CAMPAIGN, GDW, (Out of Print, no doubt), gives a 
fairly complete history of the Fifth Frontier War, including a compilation of 
all the TNS releases.  Regrettably, it is rather too long for me to type and 
upload.  I haven\'t looked at it in a while, but it seems to me that it also 
contained a much briefer summary of the other Frontier Wars.


Adrian Hurt miscredits a note of mine to Rob Miracle, and answers:

When I used cruiser in this context, I was referring to the sort of cruiser 
that would be expected to be able to deal with an enemy battleship.  There 
can be little doubt that the conception of the Traveller universe was in 
constant change all through the publication of the early GDW adventures.

May have a chance to do a few more vehicle designs soon, so get any requests 
in for things that you want to see.

Is is possible/permitted/appropriate to post for sale notices here?  I 
recently acquired a bunch of old Judge\'s Guild Traveller stuff and I would
be happy to pass it along to someone who would appreciate it more.  Ask for

I don\'t like this.  The main differences between the FGMP-15 and the PGMP-12
are (a) power and (b) the gravitic device which overcomes weight and recoil
problems.  The character shouldn\'t have a serious problem with (a), any more
than someone out of the Wild West would have with a .44 Magnum (except that
he may do more damage than he thought).  He also won\'t have a problem with
(b), as it\'s designed to make the thing easier to use, not harder.  Of course,
someone will have to show him how to use (b), or he will simply not bother
with it and use the weapon as if it were a FGMP-14.  The way I see it, if he
can use high-energy weapons, he can use any high-energy weapon - after someone
has shown him what\'s different from the one he trained on, and that applies to
other makes of PGMP-12 too.

You\'re right, it\'s silliness.  Around here, the law level is 8 - all guns
forbidden on the street, big blades not allowed, small blades frowned on
(i.e. not allowed unless you can give a good reason for having them).  The
police may have firearms up to and including rifles and submachineguns,
depending on the situation.  In Germany, the general public aren\'t allowed
to wander around with guns, but the police are.  As for pirates and rogues,
one of the points of being a lawbreaker is you break the law!

I can just see the sudden rush of players queuing up to get Imperial Marine
characters! :-)

Goodbye friends. I\'m leaving today. If I wind up at an academic institution
perhaps you shall hear from me again. If not, it\'s been fun. James, please
remove me from the list as of today. Thanks. Talking to DGP at Gencon
they finally are reviewing my naval depot article, so maybe you\'ll be seeing
it in print in six montsh or so...

Also, I told them of this list, which they already knew about. They are int
interested in publishing info about it in their new computer column in

The trouble is the sentence that a marquis usually is associated with a planet.
After all, they might be issuing the title of marquis to every planet in every
system of the Imperium, and that is much more than 11000, but I think someone
who has gotten the title \'Marquis of Pluto\' or \'Marquis of Phobos\' is going to 
feel slighted in comparision with those who hold a title to some primary world.	

Knights, Barons and Baronets may be present in any number, but Marquises, and
Dukes etc all the way up, have the limitation that there is something resembling
a maximum limit, due to pure astronomics.

  There is several things that might be different on a PPMP-12 and a FGMP-15.
For starters, the recoil is not present on a FGMP-14. There might also be quite
large differences in user interface. I\'d expect that a FGMP-15 has a flashy
3D-scope/sight with rangefinder and lot\'s of features, after all, it ought to
have that for *that* price :-) While at TL-12 holograpics were much more 
primitive. And an FGMP-15 got that neat rules-defying fusion reactor backpack
that needs service once a day or something (Mercenary) while a PGMP-12 has a
\'dumb\' powerpack like the TL-8 and TL-13 laser weapons.

  It\'s quite clear that I\'d impose a penalty for first use, but for how long it
would remain is another question. A suggestion would be for it to last until 
the first AT in EnergyWeapons, and let the character change each AT in Enery-
Weapons that he had got using the FGMP-15 for one TL reduction of the penalty.
Or he could use the instruction and experience rules to get a new skill level at
the higher TL, which offsets the penalty.
  There is also the question that the rules for TL differences might be too
generalizing. The effects might be ok for computers and such things, but they
are somewhat suspect for some skills.
  Also, in some cases it might have been more realistic to make it harder to
go *down* in techlevels than go *up* in techlevels. Just because the character
will do a *worse* job when he is bereft of all hightech features.
  (Imagine going from a Macintosh to an Eniac :-)

  Not really. There has just been one so far in my campaign. It might have some-
thing to do with the fact that a skill without a weapon is quite useless.
  Also, the players have learned that if they happen to find some goodie without
looking too hard for it, that is just because I am preparing something where
they will need it! (So if they found a cruiser just drifting around with the 
keys in the ignition, they\'d probably leave it, and run fast and far! :-)

  The MegaTraveller Tournaments were well attended!  We had about 50
  people play the the "Flaming Eye" tournament Thursday and Friday.
  This was a lot more than DGP (who ran the tournament) expected.
  I think that this shows that Traveller is alive and well.

  The MegaTraveller seminar given by Marc Miller, Joe Fugate and Gary
  Thomas was also well attended.  I didn\'t count them, but I expect
  that we had 40-50 people there.  Believe it or not, only about half
  of the people in the seminar played in the tournament.  In other
  words, there were at least 70 people who attended a MT event.

  Let\'s see, the seminar went for the full two hours and I\'m not
  sure what facts will be of general interest but here goes.

  -> Marc Miller\'s mother\'s name is Margaret.

  -> Marc, Joe and Gary do have a \'future history\', if you will plotted
     out for the rebellion.  The shatter sun symbol actually shows the
     borders to be if you can overlay it just right. 

  -> Marc was not very happy with GDW\'s support of MegaTraveller.  Marc
     explained that GDW figured that they could ignore MegaTraveller 
     because DGP was providing a lot of the needed support.

  -> DGP has a LOT of products planned and only a handful of people
     to do them.  If you think that you\'d like to try free-lancing,
     now would be a good time.  Challenge would like to publish more
     MT stuff too.  Write to DGP for a copy of their writer\'s guidelines; 
     send a self-addressed stamped envelope with the request.  Ditto
     for Challenge.

  I\'m sure that a really organized, professional kind of guy would 
  have a lot of well organised notes to refer to.  Unfortunately,

Minor quibble - it is present on the FGMP-14, but not on the FGMP-15.  Which
is what I also said - and which would make the weapon easier to use, not
harder.

Therefore the FGMP-15 ought to have some beneficial DM on its to-hit roll,
which the TL 12 user wouldn\'t get as all he\'d be looking for is the cross-hair.
If he really is confused by the display, he takes a -2 DM, ignores the sights
entirely, and fires without proper aiming.

Until he\'d read the manual, or until someone had shown him how to use the new
neato features.  And the penalty would be at most -1.

Only because the lower-tech weapon is less capable.  I imagine that anyone who
could fire a TL7 assault rifle could equally well fire a TL4 bolt-action rifle,
but would not get the +2 DM for automatic fire.

I, for one, would like to know whether a viscount would

     I don\'t know if this is such a good example.  An FGMP is such a
powerful weapon, who bothers to aim it?  It\'s the equivalent of the
shotgun for energy-based weapons.  Just point it in the general
direction of the target and fry, fry away.

     How about a laser?  Now, *that\'s* a weapon that requires careful
aiming.  Not to mention the problems one would have if one trained
with weapons from the tech level just *below* that of the introduction
of man-portable laser weapons (actually, I consider them to only be
semi-portable, since the power pack is so heavy and unwieldy).  Imagin
having to adjust to a weapon that feels different, has different
aiming characteristics (you don\'t have to allow for drop, or lead a
moving target), and has no recoil at all.

     What, you may ask, is the point of all this?  Well, that\'s a good
question.  I was beginning to wonder myself.  Upon reflection, though
I think I\'m saying that there should only be a penalty *where
appropriate*.  Appropriate places would be where the higher-tech
weapon is of a different type (e. g., lasers versus slug-throwers), and
where the weapons require a high degree of precision (e. g., single-
projectile slug-throwers [pistols, carbines, rifles] and laser weapons).

     In my opinion, of course.  ;-)

     I can agree with this, though I\'d go all the way down to a
flintlock (TL3?  2?).  Not quite as far as a matchlock, though.  :-)

Unfortunately, I haven\'t written any software that will take a list of

I think the Imperial Nobility can reasonably be described as a huge
can of worms.
 
Here is the situation as I understand it.  I don\'t have my books in
front of me, so don\'t take this as Gospel...
 
In terms of game rules, noble titles are directly reflected by a
character\'s Social Standing attribute.  Anyone with Soc 11+ is by
definition a noble.  (I know it says 10+ in some places, but personally
I don\'t consider all those Soc 10 peasants to be *real* nobles.)
The hierarchy runs something like this, although I may have got a
few of them mixed up:
 
Soc           Title
 
11 (B)        Knight
12 (C)        Baron
13 (D)        Marquis
14 (E)        Count
15 (F)        Duke     (maximum for a player character)
16 (G)        Archduke
17 (H)        Emperor
 
There is (or should be) only one Emperor.  There are seven Archdukes,
one for each Domain:
 
Deneb:     Norris
Vland:     Ishuggi
Antares:   Brzk
Ilelish:   Dulinor
Sylea:     The Emperor (whoever that might be)
Gateway:   ?
Sol:       ?
 
Once you get down to the Dukes, things start to get really complicated.
As far as I can make out, there doesn\'t seem to be a specific allocation
of land (or space) that a Duke gets by virtue of his title.  Some Dukes
are in charge of a whole sector, while others might have to make do with
one measly planet.  The lower ranking nobles are not necessarily
entitled to any land at all.
 
I hope I haven\'t confused the issue even more with all this.

You\'re not stuck with Ron. I may be poorly organized, but I tried to
keep good notes during the seminar. They may not be clear or understandable,
however either Ron or myself may be able to clear up questons you may have
on the seminar contents.

As mentioned later in the seminar, DGPs new Nugget Format was credited
for allowing extra tables to be run. Without (as reported) the players
knowing that their GM never read the module beforehand. The referee was
able to quickly absorb the information, and understand the direction the
module was taking.

The seminar was basically a Question and Answer period. Most of the
questions were answered and a few digressions occured when someone got
one of the speakers on an interesting topic. A few questions were
not answered directly, or turned aside.

There were four people present; Marc Miller (GDW), Gary Thomas (DGP),
Joe Fugate Sr. (DGP), and an artist from DGP (Whose name escapes me
as I didn\'t write it down). The people from Seeker were also supposed
to be there, but I believe that they didn\'t make it to the convention as
I never saw them in the dealer room.

The following are my notes (expanded from memory, and re-written) I
apologize in advance for any errors, typos, or unclear statements.

1) The Deneb fleet has co-opted Aslan to fight the Vargr in exchange for
   land claims.
2) There are plans to release a map (based on second survey data) yr1060.
   Referees in the time of the rebellion will be able to suprise players
   as the worlds will not be quite the same anymore.
3) A new product: Star Viking, will cover raiders and planetary forces.
   (presumably Vargr-type raids on Imperial settlements). My notes indicate
   that these are minatures rules, but probably not exclusivly (I am a
   minatures player, and the note may reflect that).
4) Marc Miller mentioned that he uses the modern world as a model for the
   Imperium. Whenever he wants to answer a question on what politics /
   trade / law etc. would be like, he refers to the world (Int\'l Airports->
   starports, Airports->spaceports, wet ships->starships, countires->
   worlds/subsectors). Note the "contradiction" where effectively sea-going
   ships dock at international airports. He suggested that if you can
   draw an analogy to modern earth, that is probably how things can be
   done.
5) Strephron\'s name is from a Gilbert and Sullivan Opera
6) The message at the beginning of one of the MT books "Yellow rot" was
   taken from a file of Marc\'s that is over ten years old. (Indicating
   presumably that things are planned well in advance, even though they
   didn\'t know that they were going to be doing a rebellion per-se).
7) Product or Feature in magazine?: Rebels Tales: Guide to the future of
   the rebellion, instead of the "real" history which flows in real-time.
8) After the rebellion product: "Twilight"(possbily "Midnight") along the 
   lines of the long night that followed the collapse of the second imperium.
9) After the rebellion low-pop worlds, especailly asteriods and barren
   worlds will loose all their population, good looting oportunities. A
   rough guide is to drop all tech levels by 2. This causes a spiraling
   decrease in worlds that require a higher tech and/or don\'t have a
   large population to rely on.
10)Pre-rebellion founded on Honour. Bad personalities drive out good
   (When not honorable). Lucan and Norris are both willing to do whatever
   it takes to accomplish their tasks. For lucan it is "to party", for
   Norris "good of the empire". Duke Norris is Mark\'s personal hero.
11)They haven\'t decided (or won\'t admit) whether Strephron is "real" or not.
12)Peace map has been done, set in 1125, it is the shattered imperium
   symbol blown up and placed over a map of the imperium and environs which
   shows the final borders of the factions.
13)Solomani are having some problems defining what a solomani is. Genetic
   pure born on earth?-Too restrictive. Not born on earth OK?-Vilani are
   "geneticaly" human. Are dolphins and/or Vargr Solomani? Most dolphins
   born on earth fit most Solomani descriptions perfectly.
14)Seeker is doing a K\'Kree thing. (Sorry that\'s what I wrote).
15)Marc is discontented with GDW\'s traveller support (even though he admits
   to helping make the decisions). The money from Traveller was used to 
   launch other GDW products instead of helping itself. 2300AD and Space:
   1889 support will be discontinued.
16)GEnie/Compuserve have the first right of refusal for an interactive
   game based on traveller. They just applied for an extension.
17)The Zhodani have progressed 1/2 to 2/3 of the way to the core. The
   Zhodani alien module will have details. But there is a "surpise" out
   there.
18)There was a long discussion about submissions of traveller material.

The August 13, 1990 Electronic-Engineering Times has a neat article
about TL-8 Holo tanks.  Two prototype systems were displayed at
Siggraph in Dallas (TX).

TI\'s presentation (the one I liked) is sofa-sized, and projects
a true 3-D image under a 24-inch (~100 cm) diameter hood.  A
green laser reflects from a spinning disk to create the image.
TI claims that increasing the  size and number of images is simply 
a matter of adding more parallel processing.

The article says TI is thinking of 3-D HUD\'s for pilots, and 
interactive 3-D games. 

The other system uses a PC-driven CRT to simulate 3-D in a realistic
fashion.

Read the article.  It starts on page 1.

=========
So there it is: the first holotank.  A monochrome image and high-powered
computer hard and software.   Just think of the MT simulation we could 
write for THAT interface. :-)

Of course hard-copy is another problem...

That\'s why there are different skills for different types of weapons.  If
one trained on lasers which were not man-portable, the skill one would have
is Heavy Weapons (Lasers).  There is, as Brent points out, a big difference
between lasers (no drop, no recoil, no leading a moving target) and, say,
an ACR (with all three).  Therefore, there are the separate skills Combat
Rifle (usable on all sorts of rifle, from bolt-action to gauss) and Hand
Lasers (usable on all sorts of portable lasers).  Personally, I\'m not sure
if laser pistols and laser rifles/carbines would need separate skills; in
the rules, they don\'t.

Different type means different skills.  There isn\'t a penalty; perhaps the
referee may allow a portion of, say, a character\'s Laser skill to be used
on slug throwers, otherwise the character gets skill 0.  High precision
weapons use an otherwise unmodified roll; rapid-fire weapons get a bonus
for auto-fire.  (I still prefer Ye Olde Traveller, or Striker, where each
weapon had its own DEX modifiers - DEX 6 incurred a penalty on precision
weapons like pistols, but not on easier weapons like SMG\'s.)

   One of the old \'Library Data\' books has the followint to say about nobles:
 "Duke: The fifth level of noble rank is the duke, and is associated with a
  subsector. The noble is referred to by the title followed by "of" and the
  subsector name."
 
   It looks to me as if it would be hard to have more dukes than subsectors and
sectors. Any more than that and they\'ll have to invent new subsectors :-) or the
poor duke will be without a title!
 
   The situation is analogus with the Count and the Marquis, a Count is 
is associated with two or three worlds and the Marquis with one.
 
 "Marquis: ...A marquis is associated with a single world (generally a large and
  important one with a type A or B starport)"
 
   (This will probably rule out the existance of any \'Marquis of Phobos\' :-)

I\'m currently writing a mercenary scenario, and I was thinking about the

Are the spacecraft going to be like whales in sky, easily shot down or
are they flying fortresses, impervious to the weapons of, say, earths
current tech level.

ie who would win, a group of tornados or the modula cutter?

Any ideas? What is the generally accepted performance and normally space-

was kind of wondering why everybody reported Marc talking about GDW in the 3rd

could mean that we could actually see more from Marc on Traveller since he

Hi!

I imagine some of you already know of me from rec.games.frp - but then
again maybe you don\'t.

Just thought I would intro myself to this list.

I was wondering, why did 2300 AD (the revised one, not the Traveller 
2300 AD one) die out?  I found it to be very easy to use compared to
the nightmare of megatraveller.  It was a very good hard science 
fiction game.  Do you think if they\'d had player character alien
races that it might have made a difference?

I\'m just puzzled.  I haven\'t seen this much lack of interest in a game
since checkers.

Also, any recommendations for tackling Mega Traveller?  I just bought
all of the books - again.  (I\'d bought them at 20% off at Brian\'s Books
in Sunnyvale, Ca. once before, then sold them to someone at 10% off
retail later after giving up on the system.  Now I\'ve found the same
books again at the same store, and since they are clearing out all of
their rpg\'s stuff (unfortunately), I bought the same set for $4 apiece.

I\'ve got more irons in the fire than you can imagine.  I just want a
pointer or two on some of the things that have tripped up people before.
Like, what are some of the pitfalls I can expect the rules to be rather
shakey on?

thanx

Joel

     Damn.  Where was my brain?  I never even thought about the skills.
If I had two working neurons to rub together, I\'d be dangerous...  ;-)

     I don\'t think they do.  The effect of the two types of weapons
(laser pistols versus laser carbines/rifles) are a lot closer together
than the slug-thrower equivalents.  With lasers, the only real
difference is the power.  With slug-throwers, pistols are much less
acurate (due to the shorter barrel length and inferior sights) and have
a much shorter range (same reasons, basically).  Due to those
differences, pistols and longarms are used differently.  The laser
weapons are much closer together, so skill with one type should work
just as well with others.

 >(I still prefer Ye Olde Traveller, or Striker, where each weapon had

     I have to agree with this.  Heck, I still use the old damages from
the old three-book boxed set (where each weapon did slightly different
damages).

     I\'ve had some time to think about the issue of usage penalties
based on tech level differences.  I\'m also a little better rested, so
I may be more coherent.  ;-)

     I (personally, in my own game) don\'t think that such penalties
make that much difference.  I don\'t use them, since I assume that my
player characters are bright enough to not even attempt to use a
piece of equipment if they haven\'t (at least) been told how it works.
This, of course, doesn\'t apply to emergency situations.  :-)

     Unless the weapon is *very* strange, even a complete idiot can
pull a trigger no matter what tech level he grew up under.

  {
    'body' => '   The question about if a certain skill should give some benefit when used
as a substitute for another skill or a skill in using material much more/less
advanced as those training took place with it a big can of worms.

   The most realistic solution should be to extensively detail how these factors
would work for each skill. But that is obviously a big job and it would 
complicate the game.
 
   To take another of those infamous "real life examples": When I was younger I
did a lot of target-practice with an airrifle. Then in the AF, I got tought to
use a SMG, and while an SMG is atotally different weapon from an airrifle, I
had good use of the experiance from the airrifle (at least when firing single
shots in competitions :-)

   During an excercise, I had the opportunity to have a close look at the latest
assault carbine in the inventory. And to put it frankly, I didn\'t find the
safety until the owner pointed it out to me :-)
   I don\'t want to think about how long it would have taken me in a more 
frantic situation.

   So the real effect of not knowing how to use a specific weapon is that is is
*much* harder to make it do anything, and if it does anything, there is a big
risk of getting hurt. Hitting things with it, once you know how to use it, might
even be made easier if you have some weapon skill in the same area. (eg. Slug-
throwers, lasers, energy, etc)

   As for servicing (most modern weapons aught to get serviced quite regularly,
even the most rugged ones that can be dragged in dirt and water and fired 
directly afterwards will rust stuck if left damp for more a few days) don\'t even
think about it if you lack a users guide or training.


   The theoretically best solution of the trouble with transferring skills might
be the Shadowrun skill-net (I havn\'t seen it myself, so this is pure hearsay).
There all skills is laid out with lines between them. If you have a certain
skill and want to use it for something else, you go there following the lines
and reduce the skill by one for each line you follow.

   This can be expanded to include some lines that for example halve skill and
so on. The main disadvantage is sadly that the whole thing is probably very
hard to actually design well. The Shadowrun skillnet is rumored to contain
large errors and typos even after several erratas.

would be something like a bunch of gnats trying to annoy an elephant. Most
of the atmospheric fighters are not going to carry weapons heavy enough to 
penetrate even a base armored (40) starship, so all they will do is inflict
10% damage per hit on the structure.  Most starships have structure to burn.
A starship laser hit, on the other hand, will do quite a bit of damage to
a fighter, although I think the COACC damage values for aircraft are severely
inflated.  If memory serves me correctly, a typical TL8 fighter plane can 
absorb a number of hits by heavy SAMs, as long as they don\'t hit the engine,
which is not a terribly good model of the real world.

As far as maneuverability goes, I think you could almost get away with 
considering the starship to travel in straight lines (limited in speed
by its streamlining level).  A small airframe vehicle, like some of the
ones I have uploaded can be rated for atmospheric maneuverability using
the regular aircraft rules from COACC if desired.

It\'s just my opinion, mind you, but I\'d say the worst probelms with 
2300AD were the lack of a trade and commerce system, which on a larger
scale meant that most adventures tended to be combat oriented, and the
Kafers.  Since I can\'t see anyone wanting to use 2300 mechanics without
adopting the rest of the universe (I know, it could be done without
too much difficulty), the Kafers tend to be such an overwhleming problem
that I don\'t feel good about having human/human skulduggery going on with
that in the background.  Do we stop to argue about capitalism versus
communism in the middle of a burning building?  The fact that the combat
system is fairly lethal (which in my book is good, because I prefer games
which don\'t involve a lot of it) becomes a problem when characters are 
pushed into fighting by the published adventures.  The overall lack of
an economic system makes it difficult for me to decide how to reward
characters, although at least the second edition has experience rules.

My comment on the first edition was that there was really no reward system
built into the game, since there was no obvious way to become rich, and
no experience rules.  I have a slew (30+) of role-playing rules lying around
my house, and I am usually planning for four or five (running them is
another matter entirely).  Thus, I like to have games that have enough of
an inherent reward structure that I can build adventures without having to
strain my imagination extensively, if I don\'t feel like it.

Please tell us more about 2300 AD.  I, for one, never really got a

I think the apparant lack of interest is more related to 1) lack of

than having spaceman fantasies (see traveller nobility thread).  It\'s
probably really hard to keep sci-fi games going, unless you have a
well-establishe background before publication (*Star Wars* or
*Star Trek* are two examples).

We\'re interested.  Keep talking.

(mild beef - see note 1).

there are some strange idiosyncracies.

Now, on with the new stuff:

Hello,

        Now to other matters:

        It is quite probable that spacecraft would be quite impervious to
aircraft weapons. However, should the small craft be able to deliver a sizable
nuclear warhead, the situation becomes more problematic. The starship may be
buffetted by the shock wave, possibly overturning or smashing against nearby
shipsmountainsbuildingswhatnot, the superstructure, antenae, weapon
installations may be torn off, exhausts may be caved in or shattered... This
should be taken into account.

        The weapon needn\'t be very accurate, either. Just powerful enough -
a souped-up Genie may be good.

        Also, I wonder if screens would operate at 100% efficiency in the
atmosphere. Possible, but not certain.

	Is it positive that the 2300AD died? It had a reasonable system,
with some very good features (deadly combat, good selection of hardware).

	True, it did lack trade and economic systems, the experience system

merit...

  All common air to air missiles and guns have penetrations that is way below
40. (I think this is the case for the missiles, since they in fact don\'t have 
any penetration listed! I assume that they have the same penetration as they
do damage.) 

  On the other hand, if the spaceship is relatively slow and lacks excessive
agility, it might work to lob some anti-tank missiles and the heavier types
of command guided missiles at it. Those with HEAP warheads have penetrations
above 40, and since the only way to resolve this, presently at least, is to use
the vehicle hits, there is at least a small chance that one will hit at vital
component. The drive, for example :-)

  (Using command-guided weapons against flying objects actually work. One of
the main weapons of the Swedish fighter J35 Draken (Dragon) during the 50\'s
was a big ugly command-guided air-to-air missile. The idea was to use it
against big lumbering high-altitude strategic bombers. The warhead was about 
one ton of high-explosives, so even a close miss would tear the bomber to 
pieces.
  The US equivalent was the \'Blivet\'. a dumb nuke missile that flew in a 
straight line towards the formation of bombers and detonated. Blivet equivalents
would certainly be usable against starships in Traveller.)

  Largely impervious, unless the weapons are exceptional.

  If the tornados could carry mavericks, I\'d put my money on them, otherwise 
they couldn\'t harm the cutter.

  If you cought the ship on the ground, on the other hand, it would be a sitting
duck to any B52 or B1 equivalent with a bombbay full of laserguided 1000kg
iron bombs and with a forward observer on the ground to point a laser at the
ship.

  The onetonners have pen49 and damage60, which mean that they will do 30
unmodifyed. But since hitting a target with laser guided bombs is simple, they
will have their damage multiplied in most cases.
  (Is this correct? COACC says in essence \'apply damage according to the players
manual, and I think that includes the exceptional success multiplyers.)
  I think that the COACC B1 equivalent had a 34ton bomb bay. That would make it 
capable of dishing out about 3000 damage points (modified for multiplication and
armor) which is enough to totally wreck a scoutship (remember the *10 for damage
points, a scoutship has 900/2250, not 90/225) and give inoperable to a ship of
300 tons.

  
  However, if one combines the ship design rules and the COACC weapons, things
get *really* nasty. It is easy to build a realtively fast and agile smallcraft
of 50t that could take 420 tonnes of bombs (if one cuts endurance to about 
4 days)
  So, what could you do with 420 tons of bombs? Well, according the COACC rules
for dropping bombs in big numbers, one is to multiply the dangerspace with the
number of bombs which is totally unrealistic.
  The \'beaten zone\' table in the referees companion gives a much smaller area
which is more realistic, and according to that, the 50ton ship could cover
3.9 square kilometers with 1000kg bombs.
  If it was loaded with HEAP cluster, effective against battledress clad troops,
it could cover 24 square kilometers! (The manhattan island is about 60 square
kilometers)
  That kind of ground attack craft would be bad news for anyone.

  And think about dumping the load of a 30000 ton naval transport down at a
world from orbit....

The pistol is still handled totally differently from the longarm, due to
the different shape and weight.

Rules customising time!  My damage system used the damage codes from the
basic set and Mercenary, modified by the penetration roll from Striker.
If your penetration roll said "Light wound", you rolled the damage dice
as stated.  If the penetration said "Serious wound", you rolled 1.5 time
the number of dice stated (a 1/2 die meant roll one die, divide it by 2,
round up).  If the penetration said "Fatal", you rolled 2 times the damage
dice stated.  The exception was PGMP\'s and FGMP\'s - if someone was hit by
one of those, no roll was necessary!

Translation into Traveller: the air-rifle practise gave you the general skill
level 0 which meant you didn\'t get the -5 for total unfamiliarity.

That isn\'t a matter of different tech levels, or even different weapon classes.
I suspect that someone trained on another assault rifle would have had the
same problem.  In Traveller terms, if a character picks up a new weapon, he
should make a roll to see if he can find all the important controls.  Finding
some (e.g. trigger) will be easier than finding others (e.g. the lever you
turn as the first move to stripping it).  A fumble might mean, he tries to
release the safety and the magazine falls out.

This is highly couterintuitive.  What happens (in TL8 stuff) is
that a "high power" (10 Watt CW or so) laser is pulsed in extremely
short bursts (~200 nanosecond) at about 1000 Hertz.  The beam is
focused on the target.  Typically, the part is held by vacuum.

When the laser (now short, high-energy) bursts hits the part, the
metal vaporizes and "jets" away from the surface of the part.   This
rocket effect makes the part vibrate at an audible frequency against
the parts handler.

Soooo...
Picture a group of mercs in armor.  A sniper hits one of them in the
back with a laser.  The survivors will recognize the sound (and 
possibly the smell) of the attack.  To paraphrase another "Great
American" (from the movie Heartbreak Ridge) "The laser makes a 
clear and distinctive sound when fired at you in combat."

Also explains why ship\'s lasers get better damage pulsed, and better
aim when CW.

     I don\'t think I agree with that, in the case of lasers.  One of the
more important considerations in using a slug-thrower is the recoil.
Recoil compensation for pistols and longarms is very different, due to
the different ways they are handled (unless, of course, your pistol has
a stock, folding or otherwise).  Lasers don\'t have that problem.  Sure,
you hold a pistol differently than you do a longarm (unless you\'re John
Wayne :-) ), but, other than that, there\'s no real difference.  Once
you\'ve been trained to use a laser (any type), I think you should be
able to use any other type without a problem.  Of course, there are
differences between models, but that\'s getting a bit specific.
Sometimes useful in game terms, though.

     Wow.  And you survived the bookkeeping?  That\'s almost as bad as
what I did to a player once.  He wanted a nuclear hand grenade, so I
let him have one.  It did 1000 dice damage.  I made him round up 1000
dice and throw them all.  We used a trash can to roll them.  I made him
count them all, too.  After all that was over, I told him that he had
bought the farm in the blast too.  Seems that the primary blast radius
was slightly more than twice as far as he could throw the thing...
Taking 3500 points of damage ruined his whole day.  ;-)

     Tell me about it.  I had a player use an FGMP on a bird one time.
Talk about overkill.  We ended up with vaporized parakeet.  It *did*
shut the bird up, though.  ;-)

Yes, that\'s right.  I checked in the Rebellion Sourcebook and
it also names Tranian as the Archduke of Gateway.  Like Adair,
Tranian supports Lucan.
 
*sigh*  I wish I had a better memory.  Or did I say that already?

Most combat vessels have more than the standard armour, thus even more
impervious and if its a starship with a nuclear damper...

Speed and agility aren\'t the entire point. The streamlining is. If the
ship is streamlined its max atmospheric speed is 1000 kph, it will be a
whale in the sky. If however the stremlining is airframe the top speed is
90% of its vaccuum movement. a 6-G fighter/ship would go .9*4800 (I think 
this figure is accurate) 4320 kph. As this is 1200 m/s (Mach 3.5) and the 
ship\'s acceleration is 59 m/s/s (in any direction) and of course unlimited
ceiling it would be a nasty opponent for an aircraft especailly a modern
(earth) aircraft. Note that a 500000Ton battleship with 6G and airframe hull
would perform almost identically (probably a larger turning radius unless its
agility was higher) an impressive sight.

The ships lasers are essentially 250Mw beam or pulse lasers. I thought that
there was a (space) fighter described in the CoACC book?

Don\'t forget there is also point defense weapons. I don\'t know if the lasers
can act as point defense. Repulsors and possibly the lasers as they can fire
at incoming missiles, the usual bombing height of a B52/B1 plus the nice
lasers (assuming laser detectors) make the tracking of the bombs easy and/or
destruction of the FO.

Instead of attacking all these civilian-type cutters and ships, try a
military target, things will not be as easy. Think of the effect of an
EM pluse from an air-burst nuke from a military ship on the local
(air) fighters/bombers. (assuming fib computer on the ship).

  It is possible that one should use the common exceptional success multipliers
(half damage if maginal success, double if exceptional etc.) for air-to-air,
air-to-surface and surface-to-air combat.
  In some places, COACC talks about \'inflicting it\'s damage poind value\' and in
some it says \'resolve according to players manual\'. 
  The problem above would be somewhat alleviated if all COACC combat is resolved
using the players manual system. 

  BTW, does anyone have an opinion about the Agility formula in COACC. It seems
that the more percentage of the aircraft that is dedicated to mauever 
enhancement, the *lower* will the aircrafts agility be!

  The formula looks something like this (reciting from memory):

  (Speed/100+TTW*100)/100-ME+MP 
  
  where TTW is Thrust to Wt ratio (or G), ME is % of a/c dedicated to manuever
enhancement and MP is the manuever point bonus from the controls.

  The formula would make more sence if it were:

  (Speed/100+TTW*100)/(100-ME)+MP

  But I havn\'t seen this corrected anywhere.

  Comments anyone?

- -bertil-

PS. It is also quite fun to compare TTW rations and performance for real a/c\'s
    and for COACC designed ones. A SR-71, for example would be quite slow if
    Lockheed had used COACC to design it :-)

Hello,

        Enclosed is a ship design for an armed lander for the 2300AD.
I have heard that the game is now defunct, as far as GDW is concerned,
but I like the design system, and shall probably GM the game until
MegaTr. appears in Israel (circa 2019).

        Designed for the demanding XM-2291/AL-req.12.3 requirement, the
assault lander had a very bad start. The technology demonstator crashed,
killing the pilot, after the advanced power plant caught fire. Two redesigns
followed, with 3 differing power plants. Two of the unmanned test vehicles
crashed in power plant fires, and the project manager resigned.

        The American government intended to transfer the project to
Ramco-Grumman concern and, in an act of desperation, GAS decided to install
the well known, if not overly advanced, General Atomics MHD-3 into the
remaining test vehicle.

        Surprisingly, the vehicle proved very reliable and quite versatile.
Within 2 months, the American government requested a pre-production run of
5 vehicles.

        Heavily armoured and armed for ground support, the AL-22 proved
to be a very useful addition to the US Marine Drop Forces.

        At the request of the USMC, a specialized gunship version was
built, to provide heavy support fire and defence suppression. The AL-22D
has 50% more armour and more than twice the firepower, as well as an
extensive ECM suite.

        Each Marine Drop Battalion has 20 AL-22 landers, plus 5 AL-22D
gunships.

Having handled an air-rifle and an air-pistol, both pneumatic and therefore
recoilless, I can say that you do handle them differently.  Whether the
difference is significant enough to warrant a DM in Traveller is another
matter.  I\'d probably put a -1 DM onto the PC\'s skill if he was trained
only on laser rifles and was trying to use a pistol (or vice versa).

There wasn\'t that much bookkeeping.  As I said, weapons such as FGMP\'s which
have awesome penetration and damage dice, I didn\'t bother rolling for.  If
someone was hit by such a weapon, that someone was vapour.  Other weapons
don\'t have that many damage dice; the most destructive weapon most PC\'s
used was a laser rifle, with 5D damage.  Assuming a "Fatal" penetration,
that became 10D, and usually did mean fatal.

I also altered the way damage was taken.  I added together a PC\'s STR and
END, and the result was how much damage the PC could take before becoming
unconcious.  The DEX was the damage which could be taken after that before
the PC was dead.  If the damage roll was greater than 2 * (all three added
together), the PC was blown apart, vaporised, etc.  These rules were a
direct copy of how damage is handled for animals, which also had damage
points to unconciousness and damage points to death; and if you scored more
damage on the critter than 2 * its total damage points to death, there was
nothing left to eat/skin.

Even a plain simple 100 ton scout/courier can seriously unbalance a battle.
It can outrun most things it can\'t destroy.  (Except other spaceships! :-)

He said Mavericks, the USAF\'s standard anti-tank missile.  If they can destroy
modern heavy tanks, they should be able to damage an "unarmoured" spaceship.
Of course, even the cutter is big compared to tanks, which is why I said
"damage" rather than "destroy".  It also depends on what is in the cutter\'s
module.  I had one filled with every piece of ECM, ECCM and sensor gear I
could find in the Striker books, plus a laser turret, a computer, and an
extra power supply to drive all this.  In a mercenary scenario, it did what
an AWACS plane does nowadays, plus it could defend itself very well!

I did some calculations for ship\'s weapons once, based on the Striker rules
(which aren\'t that far off the MegaTraveller ones for this purpose).  It
said a ship\'s laser had a 250MW input; so did a ship\'s plasma gun; a ship\'s
fusion gun had a 500MW input.  Here are the results:

Weapon	Input	Effective range/pen.	Long range/pen.	Extreme range/pen.
Beam	250	125000 (73)		250000 (65)	1250000 (55)
Laser

Pulse	250	166667 (79)		333333 (71)	1666667 (63)
Laser

Plasma	250	7070 (83)		14140 (71)	28280 (44)
Gun

Fusion	500	17700 (99)		35500 (87)	70100 (64)
Gun

These are the figures for the introductory tech levels; I also have the
figures for the guns which got + DM\'s in High Guard due to higher tech
levels, and also the blast radius and penetration for the plasma and
fusion guns.  Put it like this; a near miss from a fusion gun will
wipe out a heavy tank!  For comparison, the Imperial Grav APC in the
Striker Book 3 has an armour factor of 73 at best.  The ranges above
are in metres, by the way.

Now to answer the question, what happens if a modern jet with Maverick
missiles tries to attack a cutter?  Answer; unless its missiles are longer
range than I think they are, or unless the jet can get close without being
detected, the jet gets fried the moment the cutter sees it.

What do you mean by "the usual bombing height of a B52/B1"?  The B-52 goes
high, the B-1 goes low.

Lasers and fusion guns, as well as sandcasters, can be used against missiles.
So says High Guard, anyway.  Sandcasters can also be used as giant shotguns,
and would make a nice mess of aircraft.

Finally take note, the biggest penetration for explosives is around 60, and
that\'s with HEAP.  Against an armoured spaceship, those bombs would do
nothing - unless they\'re nukes.  Also, if the ship can use its lasers in
point defence, it can use them to zap the bombers long before they get to
drop their bombs.

Subject: (1495) COACC damage


  It is possible that one should use the common exceptional success multipliers
(half damage if maginal success, double if exceptional etc.) for air-to-air,
air-to-surface and surface-to-air combat.
  In some places, COACC talks about \'inflicting it\'s damage poind value\' and in
some it says \'resolve according to players manual\'. 
  The problem above would be somewhat alleviated if all COACC combat is resolved
using the players manual system. 

**I stand by what I said earlier--even at doubled damage airplanes have a large
number of damage points in comparison to the weapons used against them.  COACC
is one of the products that I was not terribly impressed with, since it seemed
to grab those sections which were usable out of STRIKER and insert them without
much consideration being given to the nature of the current combat system.  All
too typical of GDW efforts recently.  (I did, however, enjoy the fact that there
were dirigible and helicopter design sequences, even if I can\'t get the U.S.
Navy\'s Akron class dirigibles of the 1930s to come out properly.)**


  BTW, does anyone have an opinion about the Agility formula in COACC. It seems
that the more percentage of the aircraft that is dedicated to mauever 
enhancement, the *lower* will the aircrafts agility be!

  The formula looks something like this (reciting from memory):

  (Speed/100+TTW*100)/100-ME+MP 
  
  where TTW is Thrust to Wt ratio (or G), ME is % of a/c dedicated to manuever
enhancement and MP is the manuever point bonus from the controls.

  The formula would make more sence if it were:

  (Speed/100+TTW*100)/(100-ME)+MP

***I am virtually certain that your second formula is correct, and have always
operated under that assumption.  My objection to this part of the system is
that "agility" is primarily a funtion of speed, when it seems to me that in
the real world aircraft in dogfights depend far more on turning and climbing
ability at moderate speeds than on raw maximum speed.  Even the fastest aircraft
are seldom able to evade a missile by speed alone.  If you wanted to have a 
"break-off" agility, something akin to the "emergency agility" of spacecraft,
that only applied when you were attempting to run from combat, it would be
reasonable to base that on top speed.  However, I am in a position where I
can criticize, but not do any better myself, so all comments should be tempered
accordingly.***

Nope, Adrian\'s right.  More in a minute.

No argument on this point.

No argument here either, except that recoil NEVER affects the first shot.
It only affects subsequent shots if they are fired in rapid succession
(i.e. before the recoil from previous shots has been totally damped).

This is where I disagree.  Sure, for slug-throwers, recoil is a significant
problem.  But the two factors which make aiming a pistol radically different
from aiming a longarm are a) lack of a brace (i.e. stock), and b) noticably
shorter distance between front and rear sights.  Even if there is NO recoil
whatsoever, these two factors will require you to adopt totally different
firing techniques for pistol vs. rifle.  You could treat a .22 cal. rifle
and pistol as being comparable to firing a laser weapon, since they have
virtually zero recoil.  People who\'ve fired .22 semi-auto pistols may dis-
agree with this statement, but 95% of the recoil that you feel with a small
caliber pistol is the bolt being thrown, and not the recoil of the slug
itself.  I maintain that unless an advanced sighting mechanism (which includes
some sort of automatic stabilization) is used, firing a laser pistol will
be as different from firing a laser rifle, as a slug-throwing handgun would
be from a rifle of the same caliber.

Personally, my feeling is that by the time laser weapons come into wide use
as individual defense weapons, they will include advanced aiming devices
(i.e. gyro-stablized scopes with electronically enhanced imaging capablities).
Once this happens, then there WILL be no different between aiming a pistol
vs. a rifle.  IMPORTANT NOTE: if you assume that this IS, in fact, the way
lasers are rigged, then Brent is right and Adrian is wrong.

Bear in mind that the first man-portable laser weapon (the laser carbine)
appears at TL-8 (according to the Players Manual), which is what we are
supposedly at right now (circa 1990), right?  I don\'t have my stuff here
at work, so I\'m a little fuzzy on that point.  Anyway, given the current
technology available in the way of IR and Starlight scopes, plus the advent
of the steady-cam harness so widely used in the movie industry, I have to
believe that in one more Tech. Level, these advancements will be small enough
to completely incorporate into a standard, sidearm-sized weapon.  At this
point, aiming all personal laser weapons becomes the same.  The only differ-
entiator at that point would be weight and unless the pistol/rifle weight
ratio exceeds 3:1 or 4:1, it shouldn\'t be a factor worth considering.

Most of these observations are based on a lifetime of hunting (since age 12),
plus a stint in the U.S. Marines.  I\'ve had the opportunity to use most major
types of civilian-available firearms, plus my fair share of auto-fire weapons
and other nasty explosive sundries whilst in the service.

     After reading Adrian\'s last reply, I was going to send him some
private mail suggesting that we "agree to disagree."  However, the
(most recent) quoted material "gave me furiously to think."  ;-)

     I\'ve reached the conclusion that we (Adrian and I) were both
"right."  More on that later...

     I agree with this.  I shoot competition, so I have quite a bit of
experience with .22 rifles and pistols (caveat:  I don\'t fire "off the
shelf" weapons; I use match weapons, which are slightly different).

     Depends on the pistol.  My match pistol has no perceptible recoil,
but it\'s very massive, compared to other .22 automatics.

     Here\'s where my disagreement makes itself felt.  I just don\'t see
that much difference between using my rifles and pistol.  The rifles
are heavier, and touch my shoulder, but that\'s about it.  I\'m strange,
though.  I don\'t use the sights.  I just hold the weapon until it feels
right, and then fire.  I\'m a pretty good marksman, too, if I do say so
myself...  :-)

     I do, in fact, make that assumption (no surprise, right?).
However, I suspect that I wouldn\'t use the neat little aiming gadgets
anyway, so your mileage may vary.  ;-)

     Jarhead training, eh?  ;-)  ;-)  (Seriously, I have a lot of
respect for the Corps; the Navy taught me that, and one of my best
friends is a Marine.)  I\'ve been using firearms of various kinds (both
civilian [at first] and military [later on]) since I was eight years
old (my Dad\'s a country boy).  I have some experience working as a
gunsmith, too.

     Anyway, that\'s where the problem lies; a point-and-fire
philosophy, on my part.  It doesn\'t help that I usually hit what I
shoot at, either, I suppose.  So, Adrian and I are both right.  We
just use different basic assumptions.

     I wonder...  Should we consider putting *both* styles of weapon
into our games?  It would make unskilled combat more interesting...
You could never quite be sure what you\'re picking up off that pirate
raider...

  If the ship is relatively low (1000 to 10,000 meters) the COACC could spring
some nasty surprises by scrambling aircrafts from bases under it and firing
almost directly after launch. VTOLs would be ideal since they can hide in
large garages etc. and just roll out and pop up.
  (If the COACC were sensible, they\'d wouldn\'t have spent their money on a/c\'s
but on big SAM\'s :-)

  There is always flying low and hugging the landscape. And if the ship isn\'t
on general quarters, it would take some time from detection to start the power
plant and man the lasers.

     I couldn\'t agree more! As I work as a educational video producer,
I can give you a couple of ideas on how this might work(?).
     One of the problems facing users of the new light weight
camcorders is that they are SO light that they are hard to hold
steady. So the industry is (and in some cases, has) developed a
simplified steadying system. The basic concept is that instead of
steadying the entire camera, you steady the beam of light going into
the camera by means of a very small, lightweight, gyroscopicly
stabilized mirror. Now, swap the light going Into the camcorder for
the light Leaving a laser, and you have a VERY stable weapon. Couple
it to either a visible or IR laser pointer (similar to those in use
today on SWAT and sniper rifles) and you have a weapon with virtual
pointblank accuracy EVERY TIME!

In fact, having just looked at Striker Book 3 to check on weights, I think
I may have to retract that.  The TL9 laser "pistol" weighs 3 kg, and that\'s
not including the power pack!  (The power pack only weighs an additional
1 kg, anyway.)  That makes it about the same weight as a loaded SMG.  So I
suspect that for real precision fire, any decent laser pistol should have
a folding stock, like SMG\'s do, and would then be fired as a carbine.  The
laser carbine and laser rifle weigh 5 and 6 kg respectively, not far off
the weight of an unloaded light machine gun (5.5 kg).  At TL 13, they get
a little lighter, except for the laser rifle which weighs 8.8 kg - not
something you want to carry around regularly, and I hope it\'s got a
bipod!  As for the pistol - like a SMG, you could probably fire it with
one hand, but you would need some sort of check against strength to do
so accurately.

If it weighs 3 kg, it\'s a good simulation of a laser pistol.  (To make it
a little more realistic, fix a 1 kg weight to your belt, tie a piece of
wire to it, and tie the other end of the wire to your pistol. :-)  If it
weighs a little over 2 kg, it can simulate a TL 13 laser pistol.

So you get the -2 DM for snap fire (i.e. not aiming using the sights),
plus a good + DM for skill and probably DEX.

Another thing to take note of when picking up weapons after a battle -
make sure the sights haven\'t been knocked out of alignment ...

Hello,

        I frequently fire 7.65 and 9x19mm pistols (ICPS)... There is a
great importance to the shape of the grip, and where the chink is. In
rifles, this is much less important (experience with the M-16, AK-47,
Galil and Uzi).

        If a pistol has a bad grip (like my CZ 7.65), the shooting
accuracy deteriorates rapidly. I obtain much better results with the Sig
Sauer - a bigger pistol firing a more powerful round. Both pistols weigh
about the same - the CZ is old, while the Sig is a very modern pistol.
All the shhoting is done \'off the hip, unloaded pistols\' - ICPS is
gung-ho! (:-) [smily in a helmet?]

        The only pistol which I hated was the .357 Colt Pyton - couldn\'t
hit anything because the recoil is transferred directly to the hand,
without the benefit of the blowback, and throws one off target.

        With lasers, things mught be quite different - there is no
recoil, so all you have to do is point the weapon correctly. I would say
that in _competition_ there would be no great a difference between the
laser pistol and the laser rifle. However, in combat, there would be a
marked difference - the rifle is longer, heavier and demands quite different
handling. Thus I hold that two skills are justified.

  The personal emergency kit is issued to every passenger and is located
in the passenger\'s cabin. On embarking, the passenger receives the kit,
signs for it and places it in the emergency release clamps above his
bunk. On disembarking, the kits must be returned or paid for. A
passenger may choose not to take the kit, but must be able to prove to
the ship\'s captain or the executive officer (and this duty is never
delegated) that he has appropriate equivalents. Refusal to receive the
kit witout having alternate emergency equipment constitutes grounds for
a refused embarkment.

  The gladbag is a minimal duty spacesuit, designed to support human
life, but little else. It has 6 hours of oxygen, a short range (1 km)
communicator built in, and an emergency strobe light (activates
automatically upon breaking of the suit\'s seal).

        A 0.5MW emergency beacon connected to the solar panels on the
        engine module.

        Price: Lv 818,400

  The EP-1 is an ubiqutious long range escape pod. Designed in America,
it\'s design has become a de-facto standard for a escape pod. The pod is
usually tethered to the emergency airlock of the host ship.

  The pod is constructed of two main modules - the engine module and the
landing module. The engine module contains the power plant, the fuel
tankage, the Jerome drive and the beacon. The exterior of the enngine
module is a solar panel, which powers the beacon. When the pod\'s pilot
establishes a stable orbit around the planet he chooses for landing, the
landing module is detached from the engine module, and is glide landed at
any chosen area. To assist the landing, a reinforced glide parachute is
opened after the pod has been slowed down by atmospheric friction.

  Only the engine module is recovered upon rescue, the parachute and the
landing module are to used for emergency construction on the surface of
planet.

  Note: The personal kit is a great \'make them sweat\' item! After
reading a Paranoia adventure (and my characters being at that moment
stranded on DM-46 11370 A-III - a garden world, but with some problems),
I gleefully watched them using the kit, fixing their ship, moving and
using equipment.

  When they came back... Ho joy! I had my players fill forms. One for
each item expended, used or removed from the packaging. \'57 compact
rations: please explain for what purpose were the said items
expended...\' In three copies. THEN, I sued them for every item, and had
the characters in court, where they countersued, and then they had to
explain to the \'judge\' why did they expend the items. Most of my
characters are French and American. I had the judge (ESA) German. He
glared at them... They fidgeted, and came out as unrelaible (or so they
thought). \'Had enourmous fun!

     Well...  Fully loaded (19 rounds, .22 long rifle), I\'d say it
masses about 1.5 kilograms.  Close enough?  As for the weight on my
belt, I don\'t think so.  I carry quite enough extra weight already,

     Doesn\'t seem very fair.  My accuracy actually gets *worse* when I
try to use the sights.  Go figure.

Yah.  I think so too.  It seems a little like arguing apples and oranges,
but I just can\'t imagine a high-TL laser pistol having "iron sights".
This would be analogous to a modern fighter pilot having to aim all of
his on-board weapons just by looking out the window (without the HUD).

So naturally, the overall weight of the weapon tends to damp the slide
recoil out of existance.  However, for standard "plinking" pistols, the
slide recoil is more apparent (but then, I\'m sure you know this already).

I, too, think of myself as "a pretty good marksman" (even though I haven\'t
shot competition in many years).  However, I still need the dovetail/scope
when I hunt.  I think this is true for most people, especially your
standard ground-pounder.  You know how infantrymen are issued rifles while
their officers carry sidearms.  Most enlisted types can\'t hit the broad
side of a barn with a pistol, even after marksman training (with the rifle),
unless they already have some pistol experience, prior to entering the
service.  Any target over 50 feet away is probably safe from harm.  This
is why magazines like "Gun & Ammo" still recommend a high-powered handgun,
over a short shotgun, for purposes of home defense.  Most home defense
shots are at targets within 20 feet and at that range, a shotgun won\'t
have started to spread out appreciably yet.  With a handgun at 20 feet,
(particularly, a semi-auto handgun) you don\'t aim, you just point in the
general direction and start squeezing the trigger as fast as you can.
(There\'s also the fact that a handgun is easier to maneuver indoors, but
that\'s another story.)  Once you get the bad guy outside, I\'ll go for a
long arm every time.

Again, all of this is moot if you assume a sophisticated, gyro-stabilized
sighting system associated with the pistol (which we do).

Me too.  In fact, I have a general gripe about the breakdown of personal
weapon skills in MT anyway.  I plan to post something in a few days.

     I\'m rather surprised that I never thought about it before.  Now,
what\'s the most obvious type of (simple) sight for a laser weapon?
Laser sights, right?  Heck, the laser\'s already there, right?  Just
point the weapon and look for the little red (or whatever color) dot.
Pretty much guarantees where the weapon will hit, doesn\'t it?

     Hmm.  Further thought--use sparingly in dusty environments...

     Really?  Outstanding.  I\'m looking forward to seeing it.  I have
my minor irks about the skills myself.

     Shame on you.  Damn\' near fell out of chair from that one.

     Seriously, though, I have a lot of respect for the Corps.  One
of my best and oldest friends is a Marine (I\'ve been giving him a hard
time about it for years, and I\'m still healthy--it\'s good-natured:

          My friend:  It\'s pronounced "Leatherneck."  Read my lips.
                      "Leatherneck."  Now you try it...

          Me:  "Jarhead.").

     Aw...  Life\'s too important to take seriously.  ;-)  No \'fence,

Not really - that\'s half the weight of the standard laser pistol, and still
significantly lighter than the TL 13 one.  Yes, by laser standards, I say
your pistol is light!

I believe that this is sufficiently rare to fall under the category of
"referee\'s discretion".  If someone wanted to run a character like this,
they would need a high DEX and skill.  They would get the standard -2 DM
for firing without sights (which they could easily handle with enough
skill and DEX bonus).  They would get a -3 DM if they aimed using sights.
That way, I wouldn\'t get players saying "My character has trained from
childhood to fire without sights, so he doesn\'t get penalised in snap
fire".

Or maybe analagous to the fighter pilot having an ordinary gun and gunsight
in case the advanced electronics failed.  Or analagous to a modern rifle
having iron sights instead of the telescopic, laser, reflex or other fancy
sights available today.  Iron sights have one big advantage - they are
robust.  They are also quicker to use than anything else, with the
possible exception of reflex sights.  I\'d expect a laser pistol -
especially a combat pistol - to have iron sights, at least as a back-up
to any neat high-tech sights.

You can tell I\'ve been busy lately... the recent discussion on weapons
technology is one that sits smack-dab in one of my two favorite areas 
of Traveller (technology in general and character development/interaction)
and I haven\'t had time to post anything. Drag. Well, time for my two
credits\' worth....

My experiences: As a shooter, I\'ve handled everything from .22 target
pistols (rapidfire, not slowfire-- BIG differences in design) up to
.44 Magnums (you should have seen me stagger! |->) in casual shooting,
and have fired rifles, shotguns, and semiauto weapons in the lighter
calibers. I don\'t shoot competitively or hunt, nor do I currently own
a gun: Mrs. Metlay, whose parents spent WWII in concentration camps
and whose aunt fought beside Begin in the Irgun in the 40\'s, regards
shooting, like false ID, as a useful skill to have for when the next
batch of anti-Semites take power, but would rather not have a deadly
weapon around the house until things start turning sour.

But I digress....

As a physicist, I work with lasers on a regular basis, and know enough
quantum optics to know how most of the standard designs work... the 
patent for rare-earth chelating for use in solid state lasers, a technique
used primarily by GE these days, was in my father\'s name. I may also be
the only person on the TML who\'s handled the ancestor of the PGMP: the
hydrogen-plasma torch, an amazing gizmo for cutting stuff that doesn\'t
want to be cut.

Anyway, it\'s my opinion that anyone who hasn\'t handled both types of devices
and who only comes at this question of recoil and control from a shooter\'s
standpoint would suffer from a fundamentally "recoil-oriented" mindset; it\'s
damned difficult to think clearly about what lasers, as weapons, would be 
like, if one doesn\'t start essentially from scratch. 

The laser is not a gun with no recoil. It\'s a flashlight that can kill.

As I run them in my campaign, lasers are used (in all but sniping cases) in
a two-fingered manner: pressing the aiming stud actually fires the laser at
approximately a 0.1 mW level, and "primes" the lasing material (not necessary
at all, but it sounds good to the non-technical |-> ). This has the usual 
effect: it paints a red dot on the target, without generating enough wattage
to "draw a line" to the firer except in very smoky conditions. This dot is 
always perfectly on target, BY DEFINITION; it can\'t be misaligned. It would
also be easy, with tuning, to have the dot lie in the low infrared, so as 
not to be visible under normal conditions, but when one\'s opponents use IR
goggles it\'s moot. The technique becomes simple: wave the laser around until
you touch something you like, then press the other trigger, and in a few 
microseconds the laser\'s power output ramps up by a factor of about a billion,
holds there for a moment, and ramps back down again. Zap, you\'re dead.

This brings back the entire question of why fiberoptic cables aren\'t used
to make lasers where the tube is clipped to the belt and the aiming lens,
which weighs nothing, is held in the hand. The primary reason only holds
at lower TL, and could conceivably go away at higher TL: the fiber optic
cables available to us now are either too fragile for combat use (fused
silica, glass, crofon, etc) or have much too much attenuation (plastic).
This makes lasers potentially VERY dangerous close-in weapons: whip up
your gun hand, see, FLASH, scratch one opponent.

A bigger question, one which has never been settled to my satisfaction, is
exactly how dangerous a laser bolt would be. Would it cauterize the hole
instantly? Or would it flash-heat the user\'s body water to steam? That\'s
the difference between 2D of damage and 4D....

Plasma weapons have not been handled properly by Traveller. Ever. They obey
the 1/r**2 law, unlike lasers: a laser carrying enough power to melt steel 
can pass within a centimeter of your hand and you\'ll never feel it, but a 
plasma flare radiates ENORMOUS heat in all directions. They simply cannot
be used without massive heat shielding and protective eyewear; they\'re too
hot and bright for an unprotected man to fire. Period. And there\'s some 
question of why they have such massive recoil; the plasma flare shouldn\'t
have that much mass to it.

Gripe, gripe, gripe. Comments?

atmospheric range for a 250MW ship\'s laser.

Plowhorse Truck TL5


     The Plowhorse is designed for general purpose work at the lowest 
practical tech level for the manufacture of internal combustion engined 
vehicles.  The model shown here includes a radio installation, useful for 
exploration parties and the like, but seldom installed for ordinary use.  
Reduce cost by Cr500 if this option is removed.  Designed for offroad 
travel, the vehicle is equipped with fairly large tires to avoid bogging on 
soft surfaces.  The Plowhorse is open topped.

Minuteman Armored Truck TL5

     The Minuteman is a limited use armored vehicle produced on the 
Plowhorse truck chassis. Its fairly large turret (5.4kl) allows ample room 
for the gunner\'s and the vehicle commander\'s seats.  Offroad performance is 
comparable to that of the unmodified cargo version.

Raptor Combat Lander TL13

     The Raptor is designed as a multi-function vehicle, forinterface 
military operations.  Capable of serving as a space or air fighter, it is 
also equipped to land a squad of 12 infantrymen (preferably battle dress 
equipped).  Endurance was sacrificed to provide the other desired operating 
features. The Raptor carries a space-rated triple missile turret as well as a 
remotely operated 100MW pulse laser belly turret.

Eclipse Orbital Speeder TL13

     The Eclipse is designed as rapid transport for  executives, although a 
number have been bought by private enthusiasts.  Ordinary operation consists 
of climbing to stratospheric or orbital altitudes to permit continuous 
acceleration with mid-point turnover, allowing for extremely rapid travel 
over planetary distances.  The Eclipse is fully spaceworthy and can undertake 
interplanetary flight, in which case a steward is usually carried for the 
benefit of the passengers.

Dragonfly Light Grav Vehicle TL13

     The Dragonfly is intended to serve as a basic around the town vehicle 
for a sizable family.  Every effort has been made to keep it affordable.  It 
should be noted that up to 1.3 tons of cargo can be carried with the 
performance still at the "unloaded" values given below.  As with any grav 
vehicle, weight is critical. No life support system is included, thereby 
limiting operations to a breathable atmosphere.

I agree.  You\'re probably understating the case though.  Imagine
what you could do *TODAY* with a good computer, your match pistol,
and a power glove.  By TL-13 there will probably be biofeedback
between your (pick appendage you wish to point) and (maybe) your optic
nerve, so that you can simply "throw" the bullet (or beam, or missile)
to your adversary.  For the adventurous, you might choose to "be"
a smart bullet (or missile) and seek-and-destroy.

Calculate the diameter of the laserbeam from a laserrifle out at very long
range. \'The Traveller Book\' claims that the beam is 2mm diameter and has a
wavelength in the infrared.
  And since diffraction through small openings isn\'t likely to change with
the techlevel...
  A friend of mine got the figure 2 meters diameter at 500 meters range :-)
  It seems that manportable lasers are a shortrange weapon.
  (And if we look at ships weapons we might find out that ship to ship
combat with lasers at the ranges given are physically impossible :-)

My 1/4cred about hole vs. vapour explosion:
  I think it is highly dependant on the material of the target. I would imagine
that metals would get a hole and squishy things with lots of fluids (PCs :-)
a vapour explosion.
  On the other hand, don\'t over estimate the effect of an vapour explosion.
There has been a number of handgun bullets developed that had all kinds of 
outlandish shapes, supposedly to better transfer their kinetic energy into a
shockwave in the target. They didn\'t work very well.

About point defence:
  Even if the PD weapon had a 100% effectiveness, it has a rate of fire (which I
don\'t remember, I think it is about 30 shots per minute for turreted weapons?)
and if more bombs arrive in less time than there is turrets to handle them,
a lot of them is going to get through.
  This is the tactics used today for missile attacks against ships. And iron
bombs, even with a laser guidance pack, are harder targets than sea skimming
missiles.

I assume that the standard models have no advanced features because of cost and
skill of the user constraints, and also because there are a lot of situations
where the additional benifit is minimal.  I also believe that in general
society places a higher priority on high TL spaceships for example then making
sure every tom, dick and harry has the most advanced and highest possible TL
weapons with all the bells and whistles.

Advanced features are of course available for the elite who wish to pay more
and take the time to use them correctly, but there are plenty of weapons
without advanced features, and plenty of people who don\'t know who to use them,
and lots of situations where the the additional benifit is minimal.

	Just a question that occurred to me, sorry it isn\'t more traveller
related, but the discussion of firearms (mainly lasers and such) piqued my
curiosity & reminded me of an old question I wanted to know the answer to
at one point:

	What kinds of pistols are there out there commonly available in
our society today that use "non-standard" (for a pistol) caliber?  We usually
here about .22, 9mm, .38, .45, and similar rounds, and of course there are
the fabled .44 and .357 rounds, favorites of filmmakers everywhere.  What
other calibers are out there?  For example, is the 7.62 Nato round fired by
a pistol?  Would it make sense for it to be fired by a pistol, or not?  Why?
What factors determine which calibers can and cannot be used in pistols?

	Something more traveller oriented... I just picked up Traveller 2300
and the Earth/Cybertech supplement for same.  I bought \'em because I\'ve been
meaning to get the newer versions of traveller for a while, and I came across
these at a cheap price.  I\'ve heard that 2300 has been rendered "obsolete"
by the game producers, though.  Is this true?  Why?

than a one-shot integral laser) require this large backpack to power them.
This puts rather a damper on their use as a personal weapon. If someone
out there who knows the power consumption for modern lasers cross-references
that with the battery/fuel cell/micro-fusion outputs of the Traveller sources
then it would be interesting to see what size this would have to be.
	In my own campaign only special squads/comando units use laser or 
plasma weapons. They are just too expensive (don\'t forget the cost of 
maintaining them) to kit out your entire armed forces with. Unless your
potential opponent is going to be dressed in (expensive) combat environment
suits of (prohibitively expensive) battledress a good, simple rifle will
do just as well. Does anybody have a counter-argument I haven\'t thought of?

    'body' => 'well,
having just joined TML, I thought I\'d add my thoughts to the growing stack
of ideas on ironmongery (or lightmongery).  I might have missed something
important before coming on 28 Aug, so accept my apologies in advance.

Most people who have been trained to combat shoot pistols, including me,
have been taught to fire from the hip in close combat (<10\').
At these ranges it\'s quicker than bringing the weapon to bear, and just as
accurate.  From 10\' to 20\' it\'s user preference.  From there on out you
use the sights, iron, electronic, or biological (more on this later).
So, the idea is that the character with pistol skill would react based
on training and target distance (e.g. I would shoot from the hip to about
10\' and then shoot from a modified weaver stance further out).  A snapshot
is just that, a hastily squeezed off round, regardless of whether you bring
the weapon to bear or not.  Indeed, the hip shoot gives you stability quicker
by allowing you to tuck your elbow into your hip, and then you just turn
your body towards the target.  The reason it doesn\'t work further out is the
tendency to aim low.

Currently, most gunplay with pistols takes place at close quarters, so
by looking who wins in these situations, we can pretty much guess who
has better accuraccy.  The stats that I can recall easy are police shots,
and in these cases the badguys usually win.  Why?  Because they shot
instinctively, point the thing at the cop and squeeze the trigger, adjust for
effect.  The cops spent too much time trying to aim.  (It\'s not so much
accuraccy, but effectiveness). Enough already.

Lasers...Is it a typo or is the TL 13 laser a kilo-and-a-half more than the
TL 9 version.  This would be understandabile considering that the ImpEncyclo
describes the TL 13+ laser weapons as being X-ray in nature.  So you would
need to add an x-ray tube, right?  And then add an IR targeting laser, if so
desired.  I agree with Mr. Metlay, fiber optics ought to improve to the point
where they would be robust enough to allow the laser et al to be on your
belt/back/eunuch.  Right now, they\'re good enough (e.g. flexibility, dura-
bility) to be used for tracheal/bronchial surgery.  And we are at TL 7-8.

Sights...Frankly I wouldn\'t spend cr3000 on a laser pistol without getting
all the balls and whistles.  If I wanted something cheap and effective,
I would\'ve got the gauss pistol, which is lethal enough to people even
wearing minimal armor, at cr600.  I would get the laser pistol if I needed
a semi-concealable weapon and I was going against some medium armored targets
If I didn\'t need a concealable weapon it\'d be easier, cheaper, and deadlier
(considering the RAM GL) to have a gauss rifle.  The laser pistol also has
a certain mystique about it as well...Anyway, sights.  The thought occurred
to me that by TL 11 we have nerve refusion, which means we have an excellent
understanding of how neurons work and how to make them more effective.  TL 13
this body of knowledge will have expanded.  If you got the bucks to buy a laser
pistol, the technology probably exists to biomechanical/electronic interface
with the critter.  Everything in your body would be biological (altered
tissue).  The laser would be both.  Essentially the system would work the
same way you type.  I know am hitting an "A".  The gunslinger knows he is
pointing it at the target.  As with typing you\'d need to learn how to use it,
but it could be done.  Think about it, in the future there would be the
fighters, biologically enhanced to use expensive weapons systems, and the
rest of us.

Actually, my primary "research" interest in traveller is the progression
of biological and medical sciences.  We have become progressively better
at saving people from more severe trauma and diseases.  How will this
effect life/combat in the future?  What gadgets will exist? Interested?

Them\'s my thoughts,

I didn\'t mean to suggest that you were over-stating your skill, Brett.
I just meant that my opinion of my own marksmanship is very subjective:
my deer drop when I shoot at them and bottles shatter (most of the time)
when I aim at them.  God knows what kind of damage I could do if I actually
started using ammunition. :-)

Ah-ha!!  Humor as a weapon!!  This is good.  It means that everything
the Piranha brothers taught me is working!!! :-)

Long ago, I came to the conclusion that the Corps is no place for an
intellectual, vis-a-vis the following exchange (during bayonet orientation
in Basic Training):

D.I.: "Occasionally, you will discover that your bayonet has become
       lodged in the body of your opponent.  If this happens, a single
       discharge of your weapon will be sufficient to dislodge the
       bayonet."

Recruit: "Excuse me, sargeant, but if I\'m still capable of discharging
       my weapon, there isn\'t going to BE any bayonet combat!"

>     Aw...  Life\'s too important to take seriously.  ;-)  No \'fence,
>eh?  ;-)  I\'m entitled--I\'m one of them Navy types...

That\'s OK.  Two of my best friends are cabbies...er, ah... ex-Navy types.
Somebody\'s got to drive the boat. :-)

Anyway, enough of this \'moochual admiration society\' hoo-haw.  Let\'s get
back to the gratuitous sex n\' violence.

Let\'s not get carried away with the analogies.  First off, most of the
shooters in the group will tell you that once you put a scope on a rifle,
you typically REMOVE the iron sights.  The scope isn\'t likely to fail
and the iron sights are in the way.  Second, I disagree that iron sights
are quicker to use than a scope.  I can\'t tell you the number of times
I\'ve been unable to line up the front leaf of an iron sight (in dim light)
when a scoop would have been no trouble at all.

Unfortunately, once this happens (within the context of the game) you
start coming uncomfortably close to treading on the ol\' anti-cyborg
sentiment so prevalent throughout the Imperium.  Actually, I prefer
to run my campaign with a strong \'cyberpunk\' flavor to it, so I tend
to just ignore the \'anti-cyborg\' bit and go on my merry way.

To give you an idea of the range of calibers available for handguns on the
market today, "Cartridges of the World (6th Ed.)" lists the 2.7mm Kolibri
Auto as the smallest, and .455 Webley Auto as the largest.  Bear in mind
that this refers to MASS-PRODUCED ammunition only for standard caliber,
multi-shot pistols.

For more exotic rounds, you could look at weapons like the Remington XP-101
bolt-action match pistol, or the Thompson Contender.  The Contender, in
particular, warrents mention due to the fact that, as a single-shot target
or hunting pistol, it has a wide variety of interchangable barrels and,
in addition to a broad selection of pistol ammo, it can also fire is
surprisingly large number of different rifle rounds, up to and including
the massive 30-06.  I, personally cannot imagine firing a round that large
without a stock and a massive recoil pad.

Speaking of 7.62 rounds: while the 7.62 NATO rifle round is never fired as
a pistol round (with the possible exception of a custom weapon), the Russian
Tokarev pistol (the standard sidearm for Soviet officers, from 1930 until
the end of WWII, when it was discarded in favor of the 9mm Makarov) DOES
chamber a 7.62mm pistol round.  This round was adopted in 1930 for the Model
TT-33 auto pistol.  This cartridge is very similar to the 7.63mm Mauser (also
known as the 30 Mauser).

One response you got already, was from Alvin M. Chan at
CHAN93%SNYBUFVA.BITNET@CORNELLC.CIT.CORNELL.EDU, who writes:

>some other pistol calibres besides the \'popular\' .22 .38 .357 (same as .38

I\'m familiar with most of these rounds, but a few of them puzzle me.  The
only .454 round I know of is the 454 Casull, which is a proprietary pistol
round.  I can\'t find ANY references to a .451 magnum.  Only the 451 Detonics
comes close and it, again, is a proprietary round.  I assume the 7.65 para
refers to the 32 (7.65mm) auto pistol round.  I can\'t find references to
a .457 pistol (OR rifle) round anywhere.  Maybe you could site a reference,
Alvin, because now I\'m really curious.

     Anti-cyborg prejudice?  Where\'d that come from?  The only general

Do the MegaTraveller books not give such figures?  Very well; Striker did,
and MT took most of its combat data from there.

TL	Weapon		Weapon weight	Power pack weight	Penetration	
8	Laser Carbine	      5 kg		3 kg		     7
9	Laser Rifle	      6 kg		4 kg		     9
9	Laser Pistol	      3 kg		1 kg		     4
12	PGMP-12		      6 kg		3 kg		    20
13	Laser Carbine	    4.4 kg		2 kg		    12
13	Laser Rifle	    8.8 kg		4 kg		    20
13	Laser Pistol	    2.2 kg		1 kg		     6
13	PGMP-13		      9 kg	       60 kg		    25

The penetration figures are for effective range; the TL 13 laser rifle
has a greater range than a PGMP-12.  The weight of the PGMP-13\'s power
pack means you have to wear battle-dress to carry it.  The early lasers
get 50 shots from a power pack, except for the rifle which gets 100;
the PGMP-12 gets 40.  All TL 13 weapons get 200 shots, except for the
PGMP-13 which gets unlimited shots.

The enemy may also be wearing cloth armour, or vacc suits, whose armour
factor of 5 will stop or seriously hinder a bullet from an assault rifle
(penetration 3).  As of TL 10, you can use ACR\'s whose sabot ammo has a
penetration of 6; at TL 12, a gauss rifle gets a penetration of 7.  These
things are into the CR 1000 range, as is the combat environment suit.  At
TL 11, combat armour costs CR 20000, and its armour factor of 8 is good
against everything except laser rifles or heavy support stuff.  At TL 12,
it gets an armour value of 10, and a price tag of CR 30000; at TL 13,
battledress with the same armour factor costs CR 200000.  Finally, at
TL 14, combat armour and battledress have armour value 18, and cost
CR 60000 and CR 350000 respectively - you need at least a TL 13 laser
rifle to penetrate that.

To summarise: at higher tech levels, you may only be able to kit out a
small force for the same cash, but you can make it invulnerable to anyone
who doesn\'t do the same.  There\'s also the matter of ammo; a laser power
pack gets recharged from the starship\'s power plant (assuming you have
access to one).  Finally, you can use a laser to illuminate a target for
the benefit of laser-guided missiles - the first people to get laser
carbines are forward observers for this reason.

For the rifle, yes; pistols and carbines are lighter than the earlier ones.

(Don flame-retardant suit:  -- somewhat technical material follows.
Most of us already know this stuff but have forgotten it, if in doubt
ask.  I probably blew it on a few points, too.)

The way a laser works (as far a weapons go) is to make a whole bunch
of electrons release their energy in a hurry.  If you do this correctly,
this produces coherent light.  This law-of-the-universe is not going
to change because of tech level.

The way to get all that energy into the electrons, is to "pump" them.
Typically, this is done with light.  sometimes the pump is the same
wavelength as the discharge, not often, though.  A typical laser
uses laser diodes (LED\'s, sort of) to pump the lasing medium.  The 
light frm the diodes is what goes through the fiber optic, not the light
from the laser.  A very small cable does quite nicely for industrial-
strength lasers.

Likely, fiber optic cabelw will work for weapons, too.  I believe Mike
was absolutely right, though when he said there are other reasons you
would not want to take TL8 fiber optics inot combat (heat, dust, EMP, etc.)

Me, I\'d prefer the laser for orbital work (microgravity, no recoil, no
worry about rise/fall of the projectile) and a godd-sized slug thrower
for ground work (10mm gaus pistol?)  (OK, I don\'t have strength 13+ to

or so.  We\'re waiting for those in .edu land to get their accounts.

The new Director\'s guide in _2300ad_ provides you with an extensive list of
possible stutterwarp routes, while the near star list allows you to determine
the true distances.  However, nothing is as handy as a complete travel-distance
list.  Feel free to send me comments, corrections, additions, etc.

to be a few useful(?) reminders to those who want to do a bunch of designs.

SO:


How to Design a Traveller Vehicle Quickly (Rob\'s Rules)
       (without using a computer)

Rule#1: If it doesn\'t matter, don\'t worry about it.  The most critical example
of this is power consumption for electronics on most vehicles.  Unless a vehicle
is extremely small, the total of these values is almost always neglible.  Thus,
you can size your power plant at the beginning of the process based on an 
estimate of power required for weapons, environmental controls (only if grav 
plates are being used), and grav/thruster use.  There are a couple of rules of
thumb to remember.  "Full environment" (basic env, basic and extended life 
support, grav plates and inertial compensation) uses 1MW/displacement ton.  If
your vehicle is heavily armored, the three most massive components are likely
to be the hull, the grav drive, and the power plant.  You can fuss with these
numbers to get a good estimate of grav performance.

Rule#2: Decide what is critical first, and set your hull size accordingly.
For example, I wanted a TL12 small vehicle carrying a Plasma-B gun.  Energy
on that is 13.5 MW, dictating a power plant of at least 6kl.  Usually I build
vehicles around 1)the weapon 2) The accomodations (i.e., if you need roomy
seats for 16 people, this will drive the rest of the design) or 3) The speed.

Rule#3: Decide what factor is being optimized, and ignore the rest--this usually
means that in working on a combat vehicle I set the armor and weapon and let the
speed come out to be whatever it will be, or in building an inexpensive vehicle
I don\'t add any "chrome", or in building a fast vehicle I avoid as many massive
add-ons as possible.  

Rule#4: Having one vehicle makes a variant very easy--something like the 4 Tiger
class vehicles I posted a while ago took 40 minutes to do the first, and maybe
10 minutes apiece for the others, even including the time to write everything
down again, because 95% of each one was copied from the previous one.

Rule#5: Unless it really doesn\'t work, finish every design:  Real governments
have put some dreadful designs in the field, based usually on a false concept
of the conditions the vehicle would face, and there is no good reason that things should be any better in the future.  So unless the hull is too small to
stuff everything into, or you\'ve put so much armor on that it can\'t possibly
fly, finish it.  (And assign it to that country/world you don\'t like...)

Rule#6: Governments don\'t care what it costs.  I have the dubious pleasure of
working for the U.S. Army as a civilian engineer, and this is certainly true.
So when I\'m doing military vehicles, I pile in the sensors and other chrome.
How much is 5% extra capability worth in combat???

     The Falchion is intended as a heavy grav tank.  The heavy armor 
restricts mobility, and the large power plant (45% of vehicle volume and 57% 
of vehicle cost) required to power the main laser restricts endurance.  The 
sensor suite is fairly powerful, as the designer anticipated a need to engage 
at extreme range due to the low speed. Extended life support has been 
installed to permit emergency occupancy of the vehicle for the full 63 hour 
endurance, but the seating design would render this exceedingly 
uncomfortable.

Falchion-B Grav Tank TL12

     The Falchion-B is intended as a light grav tank.  Essentially a 
modification of the Falchion heavy tank, the hull has been reconfigured to 
take maximum advantage of the increased speed gained as a result of reducing 
the armor.  The main gun reduction permits a substantially smaller power 
plant, in turn leading to a further decrease in weight, and allowing a 
sustantial increase in endurance.  Crew accomodations were increased in size, 
and can be occupied for extended periods if necessary.

Arrow Attack Speeder TL12

     The Arrow represents an effort on the part of the designers to pack a 
potent high energy weapon into the smallest possible chassis.  The main 
limitation on the design was the size and weight of the fusion plant 
necessary to provide power for the gun. The gun is mounted in a fixed forward 
firing position.

Quester Scout/Prospector Craft TL15
.pa     The Quester is designed to serve as a capable planetary auxiliary craft 
for a scout or prospecting team.  The vehicle includes an extensive arrary of 
sensors and comfortable long term accomodations.  Robot arms allow outside 
work to be done without leaving the vehicle, and the high speed allows rapid 
investigation anywhere on a planet.  The Quester is generally too expensive 
for the commercial market, but where available, there is a certain snob 
appeal in having one (not unlike the desire of 1990s Earth city dwellers to 
own a four wheel drive vehicle).

Cheetah Light Tank TL8

     The Cheetah was designed as an air-transportable light tank, but as 
with so many government projects, it grew out of proportion to its initial 
mission.  As finally produced, it could only be carried in heavy lift cargo 
aircraft, and had a gun too light for the rest of the vehicle.  In 
addition, as a last desperate attempt to cram everything in without 
upsizing the vehicle again, it was fitted with an experimental computer 
control system.  Difficulty with maintenance in the field made this a much 
complained about feature.  A fully enclosed breathing system is installed 
for the crew enabling operation in a chemically contaminated environment 
without use of protective suits.

Reliable Light ATV TL13

     The Reliable is produced throughout the Imperium, and is very popular 
as an auxiliary vehicle aboard small starships.  It has the advantage of 
using hydrogen fuel, available from the ship\'s tanks, and can be configured 
to run its fuel cells in open or closed cycle, which, along with the fully 
self contained life support system and airlock, enables operation in vacuum 
or any non-corrosive atmosphere.  The three large seats can be folded into 
6 roomy seats, or even 12 cramped seats for short trips.  Low ground 
pressure gives good offroad performance, and limits the possibility of 
damage to road surfaces, making urban operations practical.

Intercity Bus TL9

     This type of vehicle is typically found providing low cost mass 
transportation between urban centers on worlds with an adequate long 
distance highway network. The roomy seats make extended trips barely 
tolerable.  Cargo capacity amounts to 0.7kl per passenger.  Fuel cost 
amounts to about Cr0.01 per passenger per kilometer when fully loaded, and 
would be the main contribution to the cost of travel.  Total cost of a 
ticket to allow for marginal loads, profit, driver salary and vehicle 
amortization would probably be about Cr0.02/kilometer. <It should probably 
be noted that this vehicle could be built without change at TL7 or TL8>

Admiral Bertil Modified Type M TL13

     The Admiral Bertil is a specially modified Type M liner, overhauled at 
Lunion in 1117 for an independent mercenary fleet.  As much of the outward 
appearance of the original vessel was retained as possible.  Major changes 
were made to the control and sensor systems (upgraded to a Model 7 
computer, which resulted in a reduction in the required operating crew to 
two men), and the cargo/living spaces, which were reconfigured into a 
launch/service bay for six Raptor class landers and accomodations for 78  p73 
crewpersons.  The cost given below includes the price of the landers.
Power allocation is such that the lasers cannot be operated at the same

Triumph Class Cruiser TL13

     The Triumph class was designed as a flagship for an independent 
mercenary fleet, and built at Lunion in 1109.  The high cost of heavy 
spacecraft puts them beyond the reach of almost all mercenary units, and 
the Lunion government showed little interest in a craft with such 
diversified capabilities when they were already heavily committed to the 
production of a specialized fleet escort in the same tonnage range.  As a 
result, only two of these craft had been constructed by 1117--the Triumph 
and the Victory.

I\'m not absolutely sure on this, but I think it is found in the Robots book,

Exactly.  For a historical example, you need only look at the naval arms races
in the second half of the nineteenth century.  The most pressing example is
the Union in the American Civil War which would have found itself completely
unable to deal with Confederate ironclads such as the Virginia (aka Merrimac)
had a building program for their own ironclads not already been started.  This
sort of thing was repeated in the naval field frequently--the launching of
the Dreadnaught in 1906 pretty much rendered all previous battleships useless.
A question occurs to me as a result of all of this:  Would low tech planets 
inside the Imperium, that are not balkanized, maintain any sort of army?  If
the only conceivable threat is TL11+ Vargr corsairs, Imperial Marines or 
TL14 Aslan, your TL5-8 army will be useless, except to provide target practice
to the invaders.

I tend to agree--the vehicle damage rules do not "feel" right to me, compared
to the fairly substantial number of wargames I have/have played.  At least
by multiplying the damage numbers by 10, as per the second errata sheet, you
prevent that barbarian from chopping the family car into rubbish with one
stroke of his mighty broadsword...

According to my book ("The Armory", a catalogue of firearms which is designed
mainly for use with role-playing games) the Tokarev round and the Mauser
round are the same.  The Czechs produce a round of the same dimensions, but
with more propellant.  They use it in a number of pistols and SMG\'s.  These
can also use the Mauser round, but lose some of their performance.  It is
unwise to use the Czech round in a gun intended for the Mauser round!

The rounds of that general calibre that "The Armory" has heard of are:

Pistol: .44 magnum, .44 Automag, .455 Webley, .45 ACP, .45 Colt
(The Automag is a custom round.  You make one by taking a 7.62mm NATO
round, cutting off the neck, and putting in a .44 magnum bullet.  It has
occasionally been commercially produced, as has the gun.  The .45 Colt is
the Wild West one, the .45 ACP is the Colt Automatic one.)

Rifle: .44-40, .45 Martini, .45-70, .458 Winchester Magnum, .460 Weatherby
Magnum, .50-140 Sharps
(The .44-40 was used by the Winchester 1873.  The company is still around,
and their .458 Magnum round is for use against big animals.  So is the .460
Weatherby Magnum, the next best thing to an anti-tank rifle, and the most
powerful cartridge available outside the Army.)

It probably refers to yet another round the same size as the Mauser .30.
This one was lower power, and pre-dates the Mauser.  It was used in the
Borchardt, the predecessor of the Luger, and also in the earliest Lugers.

Obligatory Traveller content:
Take note of all these different cartridge types, and note that a 9mm ACR
bought on one world may not accept ammo bought on another world!  Now you
know why many people use lasers.

and added a more meaningful subject line -- James]

I have been reading the remarks on lasers, shooting, etc., and I thought 
I would put in my own two cents.  At the outset, I should let people know
that I run a very modified version of Traveller, and I\'ll try to briefly
explain any odds varients of my own that might confuse people.

For the sake of simplicity, I have have divided small arms into five classes.
Class I = Shoulder Arms (Shotguns/Grenade Launcher/etc.), Class II = Sniper
Rifle/Single-shot-at-a-time rifles (Laser Rifles/Bolt Action Rifle, etc.),
Class III = Automatic Rifles, Class IV = SMGs, and Class V = Pistols.  (Among
my players, Class I weapons are known as "Guns for the blind" and Class IV
weapons as "Guns for the palsied.\')

Now, I know a good case could be made for claiming that laser rifles, lacking
recoil, etc., should be treated as a separate skill, and that even weapons with
recoil might be treated as separate skill based on power, range, etc. (If
you know how to fire a .22 rifle, do you automatically know how to handle a
rifle that can fire a .375 Winchester Express?)  

Fortunately, the easy way out, which, being a moral coward, I have taken, is
that "All of the weapons within any class are enough like each other, and 
different enough from other small arms, that, having learned to use one, you
will gain the benefit of increasing your chance to hit a target with all
similar weapons...after all, your success with any skill is only a matter
of increased or reduced PROBABILITY."  Okay, okay, it\'s a pretty thin
argument in some ways, I know, but it also makes sense, to an extent.  After
all, if you know how to use one rifle, you really do know a fair amount about
the basics of using most other rifles, even if you are not as experienced.
The easy way out would probably be to make people choose a weapon of choice
within a class, and give them a -1 with any other weapon in that class the
first few times they used it.

Of course, in most of the cases I have seen, it becomes a moot point.  Most
of my characters, even if they know every weapon skill in the book, only use
one or two weapons.  (Just curious if other GMs have this happen.  Any
interesting and/or funny stories?)  Which means that all our worrying about
separate skills becomes needless--if they know how to use a rifle, they will
probably choose the good ol\' Durenkell-Smithe 5 mm. projectile carbine 
(3D - 2 damage w. slug rounds, 2.5 kg. mass unloaded, capable of holding a
10-round, 20-round, or 40-round clip, and capable of single shot or three-
round-burst fire) or some other gun and NEVER use anything else, even 
though they could switch rifles every game if they wanted.

On a totally different subject, I was curious which people on this list
are in the Indiana/Illinois area and whether or not you go to sf cons.  I
will probably be at Contact, Windycon, and Chambanacon--the first two are
iffy, the last is about 95% definite--and if you are going and want to 
get together and talk about game stuff, etc., please let me know.

Anyway, take care.

I\'ve been catching up on my mail (ah, vacation) and came across a few
threads that I\'ll insert my meagre moneysworth ...

Spacecraft in atmosphere: Presumably these ships have vulnerable things
like radar antennae and comms aerials sticking out. If you KO a ship\'s
radar, what happens then? May not stop the thing, but it\'ll sure distract
the crew ...

Exotic weapon-gunner interfaces: This is starting to sound like cyberpunk
to me (not necessarily a bad thing - this isn\'t a flame - but old Traveller
was a goodole nuts\'n\'bolts game with no fancy wetware). Anyway some thoughts
about marketing these weapons occurs to me. How many soldiers/adventurers
are going to have the appropriate interface? Is there one standard interface?
How do you sell a weapon with a neural sight to a grunt from a tech 8 planet
who\'s never heard about these gizmos? How do you keep \'em working (heh, the
old malfunction at a critical time trick - my players used to hate this).

Just some thoughts. Also, how does Megatraveller compare to old Traveller?
I never moved to the new stuff. Looking at the vehicle and ship designs,
it seems like MT has some big improvements done. Is it worth an upgrade?

A friend and myself were talking about traveller (what else is
there to talk about?) and an interesting (?) point was raised:

	Starship meson weapons should not be subject to damage on the
	external damage table.

Since mesons are supposed to pass through matter without effect, why should
ships be designed with external meson mounts?  The MT rules do mention the
concept of a deep meson gun site for planetary defence and these guns are
not subject to damage.  It seems reasonable that starship weapons should
be likewise.  Spinal mounts would not need anything external to the ship
as they are not required to move (did anybody every notice the art-work
in some of the traveller books that show large starships with things
sticking out of them that are supposed to be meson guns???).  Bays would
probably have some kind of external opening (since they\'re sort of
changable) and turrets wouldn\'t need any (another interesting question
would be how many internal hardpoints would a ship get?).

Along the same line is the question of meson batteries bearing:  since they
can shoot through the ship itself, they should ALL be able to bear on an
enemy ship.

One objection to this concept is that firing through your own hull is
very dangerous and is not considered a safe practice.
(to me this seems pretty weak especially when the distances involved in
starship combat are considered.)

     Now that you mention it, you\'re quite right.  My (former,
unfortunately) gaming group was mostly US Army officer cadets (and one
butterbar ;-) ).  I could often take up an entire night of gaming with
getting them re-equipped with ammo, since they usually had their ammo
custom-made, using one of their original rounds as a sample.  They
never even *tried* to find compatible ammunition on the open market.
Depending on the local law level (and other factors), this activity
could often result in interesting things happening.  One time, they
had to fight their way out of a large city--but that\'s another story...

To Rob Dean:

My first child, a daughter, arrived in July, so she\'ll be nine weeks tomorrow.
Anyway she has had her nights too, with many more to come I\'m sure. And I am 
already walking around the local malls looking at the girls hairdo\'s thinking,
if Rachel ever does something like that to her hair I will kill her :-). 
But I must say that since my wife and I have been trying for about 8 years to 
have a child, the total experience is awesome. 
I wouldn\'t trade it for the world. BTW, just to get you jealous, Rachel usually
goes to bed about 11-12PM and sleeps to 5-7AM. She is really a great baby,
I know that I am biased, but hang in there and just keep telling yourself that 
it will get better. 

Looking forward to many sleepless nights in the future, the proud Papa,

Greg

\'what do spineless ships do?\' (they run away, of course :-)).  Is it
possible to mount a meson weapon in the center of a dispersed structure

I\'m supposing the damage tables are an extension of "High Guard" when
meson weapons were solely spinal mounts.
As for bay and "turret" mounts, they probably can be, and should be,
buried as deeply as possible.  Then on the outer sections of the ship
you could put quarters, stores, and other areas that would be empty
during general quarters and could be depressurized.
And intuitively, you should be able to bring all meson weapons to bear
(if you can shot them through a planet, why not half a ship?), but the
reason may in some ship design or power constraint I haven\'t thought of.

weekend.  I commented once in an earlier message that it had so disgusted me
that I didn\'t look too closely at it when I bought it.  

Well, that verdict stands.  If there is anyone out there who is thinking about 
buying this piece of trash, I would strongly recommend against it.  

Between the fact that the designers did not incorporate the errata that was
available into the designs (such as reduced gunnery crews, reduced power cost
of meson screens), the out and out typos that occurred presumably as a result
of copying and modifiying the files on a word processor (and I know...I\'ve
made similar mistakes--but for a commercial product I don\'t think it is
excusable) such as the 30,000 ton tanker "battlerider"  (I think it gets
carried in a battlerider slot on a tender) that says it has 300,000 tons
of fuel available for distribution, or the number of flight crew on any
ship in the book (always identicle to the number of gunnery crew--obvious
error, but what should it be?  There is no way of reconstructing because
some ships carry thins like 100 or 200 or 1000 ton subsidiary craft whose 
designs are not included, and therefore whose crew requirements are unknown.)
The crew numbers never add up to the total on large ships, and the control 
sections are completely screwy.  Is there a rule that I missed somewhere that
says that you can\'t add special displays (HUD, etc.) without having an
equal number of conventional panels?  

Not to mention design problems.  First off, I know there is a rule of ambiguous
meaning in the narrative section of the vehicle design that says "added armor
may not be more than 5 times the tech level).  Now, I\'ve always pretty much
ignored it, since it never says whether that means total armor, or armor
above 40 for a space craft but above 0 for a vehicle, or something else
entirely.  Assuming that the ">40 for a spacecraft" is correct, the armor
levels on most of the battleships are impossible.  In any case, if you read the
combat rules, they are excessive:

     Armor 52 (-4 on damage) is the level required to prevent large
     weapons from getting interior explosions on the surface damage
     table.

     Armor 82 (-14 on damage) is the level required to prevent any non-
     spinal mount from doing damage on the surface or radiation damage
     table. (Meson guns excepted)

     Armor 100 (-20 on damage) is the level required to prevent any
     spinal mount or nuclear missile form doing any damage on the
     the surface damage table.

It is certainly a matter of tradeoff as to what level of armor you elect, but
there is no purpose served in the game by going over 100.  Well, you say, armor
can be reduced as a result of critical hits.  Yes...but the only thing that
will cause crtitical hits on a vehicle with armor 100 are meson guns, and 
any hit by a large meson gun will put a ship out of action for the rest of
a battle, same as with the HIGH GUARD rules.

Since meson guns are the main ship killers (as before), there is almsot no point
in fielding a battleship without the maximum allowable meson screens, and even
that doesn\'t help a whole lot.  I played out *a lot* of combat with the HIGH
GUARD rules, and the new rules have not changed these points.

If a few of us got together, we could recreate the entire contents of the book
(FIGHTING SHIPS(?) that is) in a couple of weeks.  Any takers?

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

1. INTRODUCTION

   In the standard  rules of 2300ad all worlds and all ships are created equal.
The time for interface  operations and fuel  use are stated as constant for all
worlds  and ships, for ease and  speed of play.   However, with the current war
situation  along the French arm,  the lack of  detail precludes  many adventure
possibilities and denies the referee certain facets of play.

   This  document,  using  the basic  2300ad  rules,  Star Cruiser, and various
Challenge  articles,  is  an  attempt  to  bring  greater  flavor to  interface
operations.


2. ALL WORLDS ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL

   On page 102 of the  Director\'s Guide,  interface  travel times are given for
the various types of  interface craft,  and it is presumed that these times are
valid for every world a PC might  wish to land on or  take off from.   However,
not every  world has  the same  mass and  size as Earth.   Why treat Crater the
same as King, if they are truely different?

   Using Earth as the standard, a reasonable assumption given the common use of
Earth masses,  Earth years  and Earth gravities,  each  world has an "Interface
Travel Time"  (ITT) modifier  based on it\'s  diameter and mass.   This modifier
is multiplied  by the base travel  time for the type of  craft to find the true
travel time (rounding to the nearest 5 minutes).  This formula is:

- ----
|                   SQRT(mass x 2.1395) - (diameter/27582)                    |
- ----

   If mass is not available, the folling formula will determine it:

- ----
|           ((diameter x 5000)^2 x 980 x gravity) / (3.98653 E+20)            |
- ----

   Plugging Earth into the formula produces an ITT of 1.0, as expected.   Other
worlds have different values.  Using the given travel times as multipliers, the
per-hour rate is the time in minutes per "hour" of trip time.

     Name          Per/Hour Rate               Name          Per/Hour Rate
     Adlerhorst      75 minutes                Aurore          35 minutes
     Austin\'s World  75 minutes                Beowulf         65 minutes
     Beta Canum 4    55 minutes                Cold Mountain   42 minutes
     Crater          36 minutes                Daikoku         72 minutes
     Doris           54 minutes                Dukou          109 minutes
     Dunkelheim      20 minutes                Earth           60 minutes
     Ellis           57 minutes                Heidelsheimat   33 minutes
     Hermes          41 minutes                Joi             82 minutes
     Kie-Yuma       119 minutes                Kimanjano       81 minutes
     King           296 minutes                Kingsland       57 minutes
     Kormoran        32 minutes                Kwantung        45 minutes
     Montana         53 minutes                Nibelungen      26 minutes
     Nous Voila      71 minutes                Tirane          64 minutes

   As you can see,  it takes a spaceplane nearly 10 hours to reach  the 0.1 gee
discharge  gradient when launching  from King,  but only 72 minutes when taking
off from Crater.   The orbital facilities  of most worlds will be at this point
since  it is the  inside limit of  stutterwarp operation.   This time will also
limit the  response time of ground-based system defense craft.   The above list
is  not complete -- I have only  included those  worlds whose mass and diameter
statistics were either provided by the  Colonial Atlas or  calculated on my own
with my s2300 program.

   Note:  the above times  are for reaching  orbital docking.   A ship  that is
"scrambling"  (racing for stutterwarp)  will reach stutterwarp capacity in half
the given time.


3. BATTLESHIPS WITH OUTBOARD MOTORS

   In Star Cruiser,  "multiply the given travel time by the power output of the
MHD turbine to find the actual travel time" is stated as the means to determine
travel time for steamlined ships.  Taken at straight value, this statement says
that  if you want  rapid ascent, use a smaller drive.  This provokes  images of
ships the size of  Alpha-Class  battlecruisers  using Estes  rocket engines for
interface travel.

   Even assuming the intent was "smaller drives equals smaller ships", we still
have problems with large ships adding a small MHD turbine for interface travel.

   Given that  energy is related to mass by the  square of the velocity, we can
assume that  "Thruster Efficiency"  is calculated  similar to "Warp Efficiency"
but using the square root instead of the cube root.  Using a "generic" lander
given in Ships of the French Arm, this formula is taken to be:

- ----
|                          SQRT(output/mass) x 18.5                           |
- ----

   With this formula,  the TE of any interface  capable craft can be found.   I
have calculated several ship\'s values,  as taken  from Ships of the French Arm:

       Krupp 821          German       0.16    None   fully loaded

   "Full" lift indicates  full streamlining -- the  ship is designed to operate
like a spaceplane.  "Part" indicates  partial streamlining, meaning it operates
like  a shuttle  (rocket plane/dead glider).   The Krupp 821  is designed to be
able to land on worlds with no atmospheres, and operates like a rocket.  I have
determined streamlining type from the picture in Ships of the French Arm.

   As for interstellar travel,  divide the average  travel time by the thruster
efficiency to find the actual time.  While it takes a Marseilles 156 minutes to
make a run to the discharge orbit,  an Udet needs only  38 minutes (and only 19
minutes if scrambling for stutterwarp capability).

   It should be  noted that while ships with Partial streamlining take half the
amount of time to get to orbit, they also use twice as much fuel.  As a rule of
thumb, with partial streamlining being the default lander configuration, assume
that no  streamling takes  50% more fuel  for interface  operations  while full
streamlining uses 50% less fuel.

|    At the present time, my Star Cruiser rules are not available to me.      |
|  If some kind soul could let me know how much fuel an interface operation   |
|   uses (both ways), so that I can formulate a reasonable per-MW/hour fuel   |
|                 consumption, I would be most appreciative.                  |

I am not sure I would like to have a meson gun firing through another meson 
gun or the ships fusor for two.  Most of the ship should be transparent to
meson fire although one might expect some "minor" sideffects along the axis of
fire, particularly are the first few tech levels for meson weaponry.  
For a large enough weapon these "side effects", trivial fractions of the 
main weapons power, might belarger than one would like effecting your own ship,
although they may well be acceptable in a planetary defense mode.

- ----

I\'d like to know what some of these "side-effects" are.  It seems the
concept of the meson cannon is the same as TL-8 radiation therapy:
you cut loose a sub-atomic particle of known energy and it gives up
most of its (stored) energy within a well-defined region.  (I don\'t know
why it happens like this, but it does.)  By knowing what our mesons
are passing through, we simply adjust the energy we put into them so that
they are `targeted\' where we want them.

Of course, you\'ll NEVER find me walking the passageways during combat :-)

I\'ll hazard that firing mesons through gravitics, shields, or fusion
reactors would have all kinds of interesting and only marginally predictable
results.

It\'s too bad the rules make these such large weapons.  I\'d have thought that
your jump drive would produce more than enough of these to do the dirty work.

Spinal mounts are the single biggest thing on a ship.  They are so big that
they stick out at one end, probably both ends.  I have the old game
"Azhanti High Lightning", complete with deck plans for the cruiser; the
meson gun is shown on every deck, so it extends the entire length of the
ship.

What I want to know is, what prevents me from designing a battleship with
two meson guns mounted along the keel instead of just one?  That way, there
is a reason to build huge immense Star Destroyers!

Not necessarily.  The mountings may not be able to cover an entire sphere.
For that matter, I\'d expect that a planet would need at least two buried
meson guns for total coverage.

I don\'t think the mesons interact with anything on the way, unless someone
set the range wrongly!

There is also the matter of sensors.  Not the general sensors, which are
dealt with separately, but fire control sensors providing the exact targetting
data for the weapons.  A "weapon" result on the damage table may actually mean
that a fire control sensor has been hit.

      Ok, are you ready for the question of the day?  What
is the rate of fire of missiles in COACC?  GDW\'s Air
Superiority allows ripple fire of 2 missiles per round of
the same type of missile.
      Well, that\'s against aircraft.  More than likely, an
aircraft would be destroyed by two.  OK, what about larger
targets?  If an aircraft went up against a larger target it
seems conceivable to me that systems would be convertible
to fire a larger number of missiles.  What specifically am
I talking about?  Fighter vs. Spacecraft.  Now anti-
spacecraft missiles weigh in at 50 kg for a normal missile
and 70 kg for a nuclear missile.  These missiles are
therefore capable of fitting on any hardpoint, on multiple
missile/bomb racks as a matter of fact, if you use all
available hard points plus two wing tip launch rails and
four fuselage launch rails (allowed for in the errata and
vindicated by the RAF Lightning and the A-7 Corsair II) a
total of sixty missiles are easily mounted externally,
(ignoring the bomb bay for the moment.)  That\'s two battery
rounds of a factor 6 battery, (TL-7) (at TL-13 it\'s factor
7).
      That makes an aircraft unbelievably deadly.  That\'s
the firepower mounted on a 1000 ton ship.
      Real life example:  in less than a minute the \'Six on
six test of the Phoenix missile system, six phoenix\'s
locked onto and fired on six targets in less than one
minute, by an F-14 Tomcat.  Since a starship combat round
lasts twenty minutes, I can easily see an aircraft firing
off a huge salvo of missiles in the time allowed.
      Game balance, you say?  Well... maybe, but you could
easily build a huge number of squadrons of cheap fighters
with Fusion rocket engines.  Also, with the enormous thrust
of the fusion rocket its very easy to build say a 12G
capable interceptor or even higher.
      More mundane question:  What are the penetration
values of the different air to air missiles?  Suppose my
players want to fire a radar homing AIM-7 Sparrow at a G
Carrier?
      Mundane question 2:  If the minimum size ship
thruster plates can be mounted on is 20 tons (Fighting
Shi*s of the Shattered Imperium), what about Anti-Grav
plates?  You can put grav modules on a 4 ton air/raft, Why
not grav plates?  The rules state that fractions of Grav
plates and thrusters can be built Personally, I think the
20 ton min is stupid.  It\'s torn apart a lot of my best
light fighters.
      If you ask me, I use
Book 2-Starships:  to design merchant ships,
Book 5-High Guard:  to design warships,
and Megatraveller to design headaches.
 
I hope you enjoy the designs,

    'body' => '1: Lasers,
   My recollections regarding lasers was somewhat incorrect. For an x-ray laser
with a 2mm beam, the dot at 500 meters would be 3mm diameter, which will lead
to roughly half the effect per area, if one ignores all atmospheric effects.
   For UV, visible light, and IR, the dot will become progressively larger, and
the laser will this become less effective at long ranges.
   X-ray lasers thus seems to be the best choise.

   However, the probability of spontaneous (premature) emmission from the atom
in the lasing material rises with the cube of the frequency, and this means that
an X-ray laser is some orders of magnitude harder to get to work than a visible
light laser.(?)

2: Mesonguns,
   There is an example of mesonguns mounted completely inside large structures:
The Imperial Palace on Core has several internal meson guns according to a
cutaway drawing in an old Digest.

As with most subatomic particles the Meson decay rates are governed
statistically.  With clever physics one can get the decay curve to be
very steep but there are undoubtedly a few particles that decay early
and a few that decay late.  For smaller weapons this might not matter
but for a main ships gun emitting 10**N somethings a fallover of
10**(N-10) might still be mode energy that a shipsuit can shield
against, especially if it appears inside you soft tissue.

Furthermore one of the things mesons interact with is mesons.  Point
defense technology against an energy beam weaopon may not be reasonable
but shooting through another beam as it leaves its apperture sounds
likely to stress the componenets of the system in question and possible
generate unintened aim perterbations to the smaller beam large enough to
be, undesirable.  ("Activate meson beam 13", Pzzzap, "What happened to
Lt.  Awkins?", "Probably those jokers in bay 5 shooting through us
again.")

Obvious more (pseudo)science can be applied to worsen or minimize the
effects but if meson weapons do have even minor side effects like these
I would expect a significant morale factor involved in a ship design
that shot through the crew a lot.

[A ships fusor is also likely to contain enough high energy particles to
generate an interaction with the meson beam whioch would probably pump
some energy back into the fusor which has a small but unpleasant chance
of an induced loss of containment event as the reports no doubt would
refer to it.]

To put in my two coins worth in.......
I don\'t know what the side affect are of shooting through your ships, or
why they aren\'t smaller or such things, but they do exist today.

They are used in treatment of non-operable tumors in the brain.
I have not seen one in real life, nor read about them in medical journals,
but I saw one on NOVA or Nat. Geographic special on medicine.  These machines
are huge, very power hungry and by traveller standards, weaker then pop guns.

Remarks:  Well here it is.  COACC designs only require 1
computer so it is an extremely cheap fighter for it\'s
class.  Of course in space combat a single hit from any
space craft weapon will totally destroy it, but most
fighters will be blasted any way and with a DefDM of +12 at
TL10 to +17 at TL15 it can do a good job of staying out of

primarily just under the surface of the water.  The plasma
turret, sand caster and beam laser are all mounted on a
mast outside the main body of the tank.  The mast is
projected above the water surface to fire.  At TL 10, no
sensors have the capability to locate it effectively
underwater, at higher tech levels densitometers can
penetrate water, but even then the air foil combined with
the high thrust engines give it good speed underwater to
relocate before opening fire again.

Worlds\'.)

Hello Cristian,

[I copied this to the list for any others who may be interested in where
to find information about Traveller -- James]

I don\'t mind if English grammar is not your strong point.  You seem to
be able to communicate well enough.  As far as I know, you are the only
TML member in Chile, the only South American TMLer, that I know of,
anyway.  Now the only continent not reached by the TML is Antarctica!

I may not understand your question correctly, but I will try to clear up
some possible confusion...  There is a MegaTraveller computer game,
which is advertised in Traveller\'s Digest magazine, but primarily,
Traveller games are printed sets of rules and guidelines played among a
group of people, with paper, pencil, and dice, in a manner similar to
Dungeons and Dragons.

Here are the addresses of Game Designer\'s Workshop (publisher of
Traveller, Traveller 2300, and MegaTraveller) and Digest Group
Publications (publisher of many very high quality approved Traveller
materials).  If you ask in a letter, they would be happy to send you
product catalogs, and tell you how to subscribe to their magazines,
Challenge (by GDW), and Traveller\'s Digest (by DGP).  I recommend TD
highly, Challenge less so.  They would probably be interested to find
out how you learned about Traveller in Chile!

You bet.  I had been thinking of going over it myself, just to get some
reasonable
large ships, and it would be a lot easier with more people.  Working together
will also allow debate about design priorities and more effective error
checking.
Send me email, and we can work out details. My email address is

My reference was to comments made in the MT Referee\'s Companion, pg. 36-37,
which states that Solomani (and the SSMM, in particular) prejudices against
robotics extend to people with \'robotic body parts\'.  Margaret\'s faction
also demonstrates similar feelings.

  IMHO, the greatest goof in FSOTSI is that it just is a dry listing of ship
data. The ships have no history, no names, no commanders, no victories, no
defeats, no life, just long listings of how they perform, listings which, to
add injury to insult, also happens to be the largest collections of bugs I\'ve
seen this side of a TI99 \'computer\'.

  The ships in the old Fighting Ships had names, some of them had stories about
past exploits and tactics. They felt alive.

  So, while I\'m interested in participating in the reconstruction, I propose
that we also/ reconstruct the ships from the old Fighting Ships, and, if anyone
has the data on them, the large ship designs that has been published in other
products like Spinward Campaign and so on.

They\'re not, but the difference is tiny (although enough to keep them from
being used interchangably).  They both have a rimless, bottleneck case (0.02mm
shorter and 0.01mm larger dia. for the Tokarev).  The number of twists is
significantly less for the Mauser: 7.9 vs. 10 for the Tokarev.

Oops.  Now that I read my notes, \'Cartridges of the World\' DOES say that some
brands of Mauser ammo can be fired by the Tokarev.  Generally speaking, the
30 Mauser round is a better pistol round: flatter trajectory and longer range.
I think this is kind of ironic, considering that the 30 Mauser round is 27
years older than the Tokarev round.

Definitely a problem (and thus, a good potential source for local adventures),

Right!  As a result, you get reactions like, "I don\'t care HOW good a shot

Mine too, but I love it.  Picture this: cyborged-to-the-gills PC chases a
much weaker NPC into a ruined building.  PC hasn\'t had any routine mainenance
done on the weapons interface in MONTHS.  He rounds a corner, where the NPC
is patiently waiting with a bucket of water.  ZAP!!  Instant neural stir-fry!

How big is a High Lightning class cruiser?

Fighting ships metions several BattleRiders that are in the 30kTon range and
one of them (at least) has a Meson-T spinal mount.  A 1MTon ship is 30 times
the size of the battlerider.  For a spherical configuration, it is three times
the size in each dimension (for other configurations, it could well be longer
e.g. needle/wedge would likely be longer in proportion), thus the weapon that
took the entire length of the smaller ship now takes only one third the length
of a real battleship,  I doubt it would stick out both end of a large ship.

Not that I think of fighting ships as a particularly good reference...(I won\'t
bother going over its shortfalls again).  Back in the good old days of 2nd
edition High Guard it was possible to get a Meson-T into quite a small ship
and I doubt that that has changed much (I did try to do the smallest ship
with Meson-T under MT and failed hopelessly due to the problems of design).


>What I want to know is, what prevents me from designing a battleship with

Better yet use three!  As a ref I doubt that I\'d give a ship like that three
shots at separate targets since it does have to line itself up to bring the
weapon to bear (if I did give it shots at multiple targets the second and
third would have pretty horrible DMs to get correct aim).

Point well taken.  This seems like a nice way to correct the problem.

In my nebulous capacity as Historian, I\'ve taken the liberty of sending
Cristian a very long letter describing the concept of role-playing games,
with which he has informed me he is unfamiliar. I have yet to receive a
reply from him (I hope that his English and my attempts manage to meet
somewhere in the middle |-> ), but I\'ve done what I can to help out.

Anyone interested in the file I sent him can request a copy from me; I
think I did a half-decent job. One error I did make, though, was in 
assuming that he was a foreign exchange student here in the USA... it\'s
going to be hard for him to check out game groups and local game stores
in Chile. Oops. |->

BTW, who are our Asian and African representatives? Just curious....

I have two questions for you all and one vehicle for any Heinlein fans.

  First, is there an Errata sheet for COACC?

  Second, are there any MT gamers at UCSD?

  Third, I now present my version of Gay Deceiver (From Robert Heinlein\'s
The Number of the Beast, as well as later books)


		Gay Deceiver

Craft ID:  4 passenger Duo spaceplane, TL 12 (no Anti-Grav available)
		59.8Mcr
Hull:  40/100 Disp = 21, Weight loaded = 10 tons, Airframe = Subsonic
		through Hypersonic (STOL on Subsonic only)
Power:  Storage batteries = 60 Mw-h, Endurance = 120 hours
        From Engines = 39 Mw, Endurance = 120 hours
Loco:  4/10 Fusion Rockets x 1/2, Thrust = 50 tons
       Agility = 6, Speed see below
Commo:  Radio continental x 1
Sensors:  V.Dist All Weather Radar x 1, Laser Sensor x 1, Dist LADAR x 1,
          Headlights x 9, Dist Active Audio x 1 (loudspeakers), V.Dist
	  Magnetic Sensor x 1, Inertial Tracker x 1, Chaff discharger x 1,
 	  Radar Direction Finder x 1
Off:  5MW Beam Laser (Pen 28/3, Dam 10, V.Dist)
Control: Boosted/Computer Enhanced Fly-by-Wire (1/6 Maneuver Points) 
	 Computer Model 2 bis, Comp-linked Cp x 2, HUD x 1
Accom:  Crew = 2 (Pilot, Observer), Passenger = 2, Cockpit Armor
	Basic Env (sealed), Complex Cockpit, Crew Station
Other:  Feul .12l, Cargo 300kg

Table 1:  Air Speed
	Airframe	Cruise	Maximun	Minimum
	----
	Subsonic	 600	  800	  80
	Transonic	 825	 1100	  88
	Supersonic	2100	 2800	 140
	Hypersonic	2813	 3750	 175

The Airframe can be modified in flight (variable sweep wings) from STOL
subsonic through normal Trans and Supersonic to Hypersonic.  Also, It can
be flown in a boosted mode or Fly-by-Wire depending on the speed and pilot\'s
desires.  I\'m not positive that I have the minimum speed for the subsonic STOL
airframe correct.  I will check and let you know if it is (unless someone else
beats me to it).
  The very high price is due almost completely to the storage batteries 
(which seem overpriced to me).  They cost 51Mcr out of the total of 59.8.
  One thing I left out that should be in there is a wheel based suspension
transmission.  If I had tried to add them using the MT starship desing rules
the weight would have been HUGE.  I am kind of assuming that a suspension
would be included for the landing gear and am ignoring the transmission, for
now.

Any Questions, Comments, Critical Complaints (aside from the fact that I
seriously bent a few rules)?

Nergal Class Battleship TL15

     The Nergal was designed as a follow-on to the successful Osprey class 
following the Fifth Frontier War. Since it was determined that the Jump-3
capability of the Osprey was seldom required in actual usage, the Nergal was
built with Jump-2 drives, allowing a larger proportion of the ship to be used
for fuel and power plant.

Osprey Class Battleship TL15

     The Osprey class vessels were originally designated "Light Battleships",
but the nomenclature was changed to "Battleship" following the Fifth Frontier 
War.  At the time they were built, the Ospreys were armed with a spinal
Particle Accelerator-T, which proved to be insufficiently effective in combat.
Following the war, the surviving vessels were refit to the current configur-
ation, with Meson Gun-Ns.

Revenge Class Battlecruiser TL15

     The Revenge class was designed by the Imperial Glisten Navy prior to
the Fourth Frontier War, although the prototype did not fly until 1088. Due
to the powerful meson gun armament, the Revenges were the mainstay of the
Glisten Fleet during the Fifth Frontier War/Collace Rebellion.

Piranha Class Light Cruiser TL15

     The Piranha was designed following the Fifth Frontier War in response

escorts.

H.B. Piper Class Attack Carrier TL15

     The Piper class carrier was designed for the IGN following the Fifth
Frontier War as part of the general rebuilding of the Navy.  In keeping with
the changed design philosophy, the Pipers are specialized for support of
300 Lance class fighters, with minimal self-defense capability.

Silver Star Class Passenger Liner TL15

     The Silver Star and its sister ships are owned and operated by the
Argentia Line, which is active primarily from Trin to Glisten.  Argentia
vessels are famed for their luxurious accomodations, and gourmet meals. 
The company also runs the chain of Argnetia Hotels, found in most A and B
class starports in the two subsectors.

Freedom Class Battlecruiser TL13

     The Freedom class battlecruiser was designed for the Collace Indepen-
dence Fleet, and was built in enormous numbers prior to the Fifth Frontier
War.  Recognizing that quantity was the only way to counterbalance the 
Glisten/Imperial technological advantage, every effort was made to keep 
these vessels as simple as possible.

Lord Adrian Class Light Cruiser TL13

     The Lord Adrian class was designed as a cooperative venture by the 
navies of Lunion and Strouden.  The first vessel in the class was completed 
by Strouden and flown on 343-1096.  One of the main flaws of this design 
was particularly evident as a result of its performance in the Fifth 
Frontier War--the lack of an onboard fuel purification capability.  Two 
ships of a six ship squadron were lost to misjumps during the retreat to 
Lunion when forced to jump immediately after a gas giant refueling.

Wasp Class Heavy Fighter TL13

     The Wasp class has been slightly adapted from standard data packages 
by the navies of Lunion and Strouden. Produced in vast quantities since 
first introduced in 1085, the Wasp can be encountered almost anywhere.  It 
is popular as a light system defense boat, since its 35 day endurance 
allows it to undertake long patrols.

Meteor Grav Tank TL11

     The Meteor is intended as a general purpose grav tank, and is built
under license on several TL11 worlds in the Spinward Marches.  The major
problem of the class is the large fuel capacity.  Had a smaller fuel capacity
been selected, the hull could have been made smaller for the same weight.

Solar Mule TL15

     The Solar Mule is produced by ConTech of Glisten for passenger transfer

     This recon drone is produced in fairly large quantities by the IGN.
The highly capably robot brain (Int11, Ed1) is programmed with GravVeh-4,

use of the trade and speculation rules?  If so, are you using the MegaTraveller
or Merchant Prince version, or some previous edition.  If MT/MP, are you using 
the Tech Level modifiers on passnger/cargo quantities, and speculative goods
resale value?

The reason I ask is that I think there is a problem with this subsystem as it
is currently laid out in MegaTraveller.  The modifiers seem to imply that people
travel form high tech to low tech planets at a greater rate than from low tech
to high tech, resulting in net emigration from the high tech worlds.  (I can\'t
stand luxury anymore, Mabel.  I\'m leaving you and Glisten behind and starting a
new life on Sorel...uh huh.)

In addition, while I\'ll believe that high tech goods are in high demand on low 
tech planets, I have a hard time believing that the value of baisc raw materials
should fluctuate depending on the TL of the mining (or whatever) planet. Cost,
yes.  They should be cheaper on high tech planets.  In fact, it works the other
way around.

So if anyone is using these rules, I\'d like to hear from you, either by email,
or here on the mailing list.

Thanks,

First, the Sparrow has a slight problem - you have to keep pointing at the
target all the time the missile is in flight, because it homes on reflections
of _your_ radar beam which has bounced off the target.  More modern missiles,
e.g. AMRAAM, Phoenix, Russian AA-10 contain their own radar transmitters.  It
might be worth incorporating some rule to deal with this in MegaTraveller; all
TL 7 radar guided missiles have this problem, so far as I know.

As for what its penetration value is, the short answer is not much.  For more
precise figures, someone will need to tell me how big the warhead is,
preferably by comparing it to a cannon shell.  (Is it equivalent to a 5cm
shell?  A 7cm shell?)  I can then get its penetration from the Striker
tables.  Also take note that air to air missiles have high explosive warheads,
and usually proximity fuses.  Aircraft aren\'t armoured much, so you don\'t need
a lot of penetration to hurt one.  As someone said in a previous letter, to
harm a G-carrier or other armoured vehicle, you really want to use an
anti-tank missile, e.g. Maverick, with a HEAP warhead.

Late versions had HMG instead of MMG (13mm guns replaced the 7mm guns).
Most versions had 4 autocannon, not 2.  I only know of 2 hardpoints on the
wings, not 4.  Some of the nice things which could be mounted on those
hardpoints were rockets (one 21cm tube on each, or racks of 24 5cm rockets);
extra fuel; and gun packs (2 20mm cannon in each).

I wonder if the outboard ones shouldn\'t be 2 hardpoints, with dual bomb
racks.  If other loads were carried, it was one unit per wing, e.g. the
37mm cannon used on the Russian front.

What you have described there is the anti-shipping version.  There were two
standard types: the pure bomber version:

Off:	Outboard hardpoints * 2
	Maximum internal stores = 1800 kg

And the fighter-bomber version:

Off:	MMG * 4 fixed forward firing,
	20mm autocannon * 4 fixed forward firing,
	Outboard hardpoints * 2
	Maximum stores = 900 kg internal, 900 kg external

Hardpoint loads can include extra fuel, bombs, or quad rocket racks.
There was also a night fighter with radar in the nose; later versions
had improved radar with a domed covering, which meant the MG\'s were no
longer there.

Not the Dam Buster; that was the Lancaster, and that modified.  Trials
were conducted with bouncing bombs on Mosquitos, but the weapon was not
used on Mosquitos in operations.

Aircraft Carrier TL8

     The aircraft carrier is a common vessel in numerous wet navies.

      Off: 6*6-barrel 20mm autocannon (300000rds), 4*HeavySAM Launchers
           (80 missiles)
      Def: -
  Control: Comp1*3, ElecLink*2500
    Accom: Crew=800, Small Staterooms*400, Env=basic env
    Other: Fuel=4.2kl, AircraftFuel=10000kl, AirOrdnanceMagazine=2760kl,
           Aircraft=30*40ton, 30*24ton, 10*20ton, 2*Elevators, 4*Catapults,
           ObjSize=Avg, EmLevel=Moderate

  Remarks: Since there is no design system (yet) for water vehicles, I was 
forced to wing it.  The following values were used for ship components:

     Suspension: None
     Transmission: 2*tracked transmission of equal tech level
     Catapult: 1 ton per ton of largest aircraft to be launched,
               1kl/ton, Cr2000/ton.  Power ignored (lots of steam available)
     Elevator: 3*volume of largest aircraft to be moved (I used wings 
               unfolded, but maybe folded would be a better assumption),
               0.5ton/kl, Cr2000/kl
     Hangar: Each aircraft allocated 1.3 times wing folded space, 150cr/kl
             (analagous to usual small craft requirements)
     Crew: What fit.  Starship rules don\'t work, and I haven\'t got a good
           idea of what all the thousands of sailors on a real aircraft
           carrier do.
     Environmentals: Power requirements of anything beyond basic environment
                     are too high to be considered.  I can\'t imagine galleys,
                      etc., taking up all the power needed for extended ls.

     Speed was chosen first, and then power plant size necessary to produce
it was calculated using a series of formulas from Mark\'s Mechanical Engineers
Handbook.  I\'ve been assuming that a SL conf hull is needed, that armor 6 is
minimum to assure structural integrity, and that at least 1/3 of the total
volume must be above water.  (i.e. max wt in tons = 0.66*displacement in kl)
Any comments from a real naval architect would be appreciated. Hull form
coefficients were taken from a table based on my perception of the most 
similar type of vessel listed.  I won\'t copy the formulas here, because you 
eventually need a factor that comes off a chart, which I can\'t copy.
     I will eventually upload a few escorts and the air group.  I am working
under the assumption that STOL airframes are needed for carrier use, partly
because of the actual landing length available, and partly to account for 
the more rugged airframe required for catapult launches and arrested landings.

Take a look in Newman & Sproull, Principles of interactive computer
graphics, 1973 (1979 2nEd) (McGraw-Hill):  there have been repeated
attempts to make the rotating mirror, the rotating plane of LEDs,
and similar things work.  Another early attempt at MITRE involved a
flexible mirror stretched over a speaker running 60hz tone.

Bolt Beranek & Newman has recently exhibited an improved model of
the MITRE moving mirror 3d scope which is now for sale at reasonable
prices (was it $10k in quantity 10?) for monochrome wire-frame or
points.  They got around MITRE\'s problems by using custom hardware
to compensate for the varying focal length of the mirror and
resulting paralax of points painted rapidly on the CRT and to do the
(x,y,z) -> (t-scan,h-scan,v-scan) coordinate transform.  Is was at
the demo a year or so ago, sponsored by siggraph/ne.  I believe the
FAA bought a few for experiments in air traffic control. 

If you buy a sheet of mylar & strech it over an old 10\' woofer and
gaze \'through\' it into fast-phosphor monochrome tube, you can do
this as a hobbyist -- the uncorrected transforms are bearable, they
say.

>Of course hard-copy is another problem...

Also currently in production.  I forget the company\'s name, but they
call their 3d output devices, marketed for CAD/CAM services,
\'StereoLithograhpy\', which I find misleading.  But is literally is a
tank.  Their technique is to fill a tank with a polymer liquid which
when given sufficient energy boost will form a solid polymer.  Two
tuned lasers scan a surface in the tank; if both are ON, the light
energies at their intersection is sufficient to cause a local
reaction converting liquid to solid.  The bottom of the tank slowly
drops, moving a new plane into the construction zone.
  It is limited to constructed objects which can be self-supporting
during construction.  Current software results in a fairly grainy
surface I\'m told, subject to jaggies.  This will surely improve.
Typical users take the produced prototype and either cast a mold
from it (master negative) or use lost-wax process to cast a master
positive from which to make molds, after polishing the master.
    I think I saw a net article on this, I\'ll see if I can find it
& forward it along.

If you don\'t insist on additive technology for 3D \'tank\' hard-copy,
there are a number of CAD-driven robotic routers/sculpters
chipping/grinding away everything that doesn\'t look like the CAD
drawing. :-)

hi netters,
          I am looking for some information (any information) about
slicing as it relates to the stereolithography process of 3D systems\'
SLA . Any thing at all that might lead to enlightenment in this matter
will be appreciated.
        Stereolithography : the process of building a part layer-by-layer
by curing these layers of photopolymer with UV laser.any kind of complex
part can be thus made. this layering is what is called *slicing *.
        Now slicing is done after tesselating the surfaces of the object
to be made (in the representation scheme ).The built_in slice program,
propiretary to 3D systems,does not perform very well when doing curved
surfaces or steep inclines.(the surface finish is less than best).
        I am attempting to develop some king of algorithm that will be able
to decide on a slice thickness depending on the curvature or incline.(the 
current system takes only one slice thickness and applies to the whole object
.It is possible to use very fine thickness throughout,but ,obvious problems
of time and cost get in the way ).
        
        If there is anyone out there working on a thing like this,please give mea few * pointers*.  I have a few ideas-like interpolation,,etc.but i need to
know more about the working of the current system before i can tell if these
can work.

     SO. I need : Info about the current sytems\' working
                  Info about other methods,possible
                  References ...

Thank you. And please write to my adres,and not the net,if you can help it,
because i am a very irreg reader of the net.

I was pleased to see the set of vehicles uploaded by Scott Kellog a couple
of days ago, and I hope you will bear with me while I repeat a subtantial
amount of his opening message and one of his vehicle designs prior to making
my comments.

  ***********************************************************************

      Scott Kellogg is the name, Stephen Smith allowed me
to take a look at some of the MegaTrav discussion going on
and I was suitably impressed.  Neat designs you folks have
come up with.  So I decided to repay you all with a few of
my own.  I am afraid, I have no access to e-mail so you
will not be able to reach me very easily and there will be
long gaps between my having access to any comments to any
designs or ideas you might have but I would appreciate it

      Ok, are you ready for the question of the day?  What
is the rate of fire of missiles in COACC?  GDW\'s Air
Superiority allows ripple fire of 2 missiles per round of
the same type of missile.
      Well, that\'s against aircraft.  More than likely, an
aircraft would be destroyed by two.  OK, what about larger
targets?  If an aircraft went up against a larger target it
seems conceivable to me that systems would be convertible
to fire a larger number of missiles.  What specifically am
I talking about?  Fighter vs. Spacecraft.  Now anti-
spacecraft missiles weigh in at 50 kg for a normal missile
and 70 kg for a nuclear missile.  These missiles are
therefore capable of fitting on any hardpoint, on multiple
missile/bomb racks as a matter of fact, if you use all
available hard points plus two wing tip launch rails and
four fuselage launch rails (allowed for in the errata and
vindicated by the RAF Lightning and the A-7 Corsair II) a
total of sixty missiles are easily mounted externally,
(ignoring the bomb bay for the moment.)  That\'s two battery
rounds of a factor 6 battery, (TL-7) (at TL-13 it\'s factor
7).
      That makes an aircraft unbelievably deadly.  That\'s
the firepower mounted on a 1000 ton ship.
      Real life example:  in less than a minute the \'Six on
six test of the Phoenix missile system, six phoenix\'s
locked onto and fired on six targets in less than one
minute, by an F-14 Tomcat.  Since a starship combat round
lasts twenty minutes, I can easily see an aircraft firing
off a huge salvo of missiles in the time allowed.
      Game balance, you say?  Well... maybe, but you could
easily build a huge number of squadrons of cheap fighters
with Fusion rocket engines.  Also, with the enormous thrust
of the fusion rocket its very easy to build say a 12G
capable interceptor or even higher.
      More mundane question:  What are the penetration
values of the different air to air missiles?  Suppose my
players want to fire a radar homing AIM-7 Sparrow at a G
Carrier?
      Mundane question 2:  If the minimum size ship
thruster plates can be mounted on is 20 tons (Fighting
Shi*s of the Shattered Imperium), what about Anti-Grav
plates?  You can put grav modules on a 4 ton air/raft, Why
not grav plates?  The rules state that fractions of Grav
plates and thrusters can be built Personally, I think the
20 ton min is stupid.  It\'s torn apart a lot of my best
light fighters.
      If you ask me, I use
Book 2-Starships:  to design merchant ships,
Book 5-High Guard:  to design warships,
and Megatraveller to design headaches.
 
I hope you enjoy the designs,

projected above the water surface to fire.  At TL 10, no
sensors have the capability to locate it effectively
underwater, at higher tech levels densitometers can
penetrate water, but even then the air foil combined with
the high thrust engines give it good speed underwater to
relocate before opening fire again.

  *********************************************************************

There are a couple of systematic disconnects in the MT rules as they now
stand (Only a couple (-: ).  I like Scott\'s idea of tallying up all the missiles
and firing them off in one or two volleys, as described above.  Personally,
I would be too worried about it, even using the starship rules, but that\'s
just me.  (I like armored hulls, so you wouldn\'t get any critical hits on me,
just knock out my weapons at worst.)  However...this brings up the question
of using the design sequences to give advantages to certain classes of vessels
which may or may not have been intended.  

     I know that COACC gives designs for space-capable aircraft...but they are
incredibly light compared to the Armor-40 minimum spacecraft hull allowed by
the main rules.  I was working over the "One SMall Step" rules for low-TL
spacecraft in Challenge 45 yesterday (best article I\'ve seen for MT in Challenge
in the last six or seven issues), and designed a "40 ton" lander.  That\'s 
displacement tons.  This thing has an Armor 40C hull necessary to make it sp
spaceworthy, and therefore weighs close to 350 tons, empty.  Now, 40 displace-
ment tons corresponds to about a 9 weight ton COACC aircraft.  Clearly a 
COACC craft is virtually unarmored.  (I could probably work out at various
TLs what the "equivalent armor" ratings would be for the various airframe
types based on their weights, apparent displacements, and so forth, but I\'ll
leave that for later.)  Should we allow it in space?  It obviously has a cost
advantage over a craft designed strictly to the MT rules.  The same goes for
the computer...MT spacecraft must have them in triplicate, so aircraft are 
again unduly advantaged.  My compromise position would be to allow the aircraft
out of the atmosphere only with the backup computer systems, and only for
"short" periods of time, to represent the lack of radiation protection etc.
due to the thin hull.  I really don\'t know...

     The other problem that I want to mention comes in when you start mixing
starship components and vehicle components in the main MT rules.  Starship
maneuver drives are the worst offender, since to save on calculational
headaches (apparently) their performance does not depend on the mass of the
vessel.  (Which is silly, given the way the rest of the rules work.)  As long
as everything is consistent (all spaceships or all vehicles) it isn\'t a problem,
but if you are dealing with 10ton fighters designed under the vehicle rules in
a fight with 40 ton pinnaces designed under the small craft rules, you have
a problem.  Let\'s assume for a moment that the Phobos, repeated above, has
a 1-G Maneuver drive (which is how I read it, but I could be wrong).  At
20 tons, I think that corresponds to about half a unit (I figured this out last
night at home, and I don\'t have my worksheet with me).  Since the power 
consumption of a grav maneuver drive unit works out to be consistent with the
weight and volume of an equivalent amount of regular grav drives from the
vehicle tables (except for a lower cost--bulk discount I suppose).  I figure 
that a maneuver drive unit has a thrust of about 650 tons.  The Phobos, with
a 1-G maneuver drive on a 20 ton small craft hull, would not have enough thrust
to lift itself, let alone have any left for drive.  As another example, the 
Scout ship (Type S, beloved of us all) as listed in the Imp. Encyclopedia
has a 2-G maneuver drive, which has a power input equivalent to about 2.5Gs
gross in regular grav units.  This should give it an atmospheric performance
of about 1.5Gs, 2.5 in space.  These sorts of round offs are acceptable to me,
as long as I don\'t have to compete outside my class, so to speak.

     When it comes to weapons, things get more out of hand.  Scott has included
a starships turret plasma gun in this design.  No problem there, except that
I think the weapons factors given in the player\'s book for starship weapons are
exaggerated.  Example:  A vehicle laser does damage points equal to twice its
power rating for beams, equal to its power rating for pulse.  But a starship
pulse laser (250MW) does 750pts of damage.  (Beam laser does 500, as expected).
A vehicle plasma gun does 20pts of damge regardless of power input, while
a 250MW turret plasma gun does 900.  Seems to be a scale problem to me.  A
turret plasma gun is also listed as having a range of "planetary", which it
probably should...in space.  I went back to my copy of Striker (I think they
did a pretty poor job over all, if I can\'t play this game without referring to
my collection of out-of-print supplements etc., but that\'s another gripe),
and worked out a few numbers for a 250MW plasma gun using the equipment design
sequence.  A TL10 250MW plasma gun would have a Pen 83 at ranges up to 7km
(so far it matches), and an extreme range (with a pen of 44) of 28km.  This
fits in with the rest of the vehicle plasma guns, which is no surprise, since
the Plasma-A etc., were all taken from Striker.  In any case, 28km is a lot
less than "Planetary".  I\'m not quite sure how to go about reducing the damage
values to something more reasonable.

     In answer to a few questions that have been raised regarding penetration
values for COACC air to air missiles, I\'d crib from the Striker rules, and make
the pen values equivalent to the penetration of a high-explosive round from a
mortar of the same damage value (basically how do it yourself missiles worked
in Striker.)

Well, that\'s my two cents worth.  Personally, I\'d prefer to do the caluclations
on a ton-thrust based maneuver drive, and know that the results would be
consistent across the board.

    'topic' => 'Penetration of Missiles/Armor of Aircraft',
    'body' => 'I did some cross-checking between COACC and the Referee\'s Manual, and came
up with the following:

Regarding Penetration of Missiles: If you assume the values are equivalent
   to the values for a mortar round of the same damage, you get:

Missile      Penetration     Damage        Equivalent Mortar

IRHM ATA        18            16               12cm
SARH ATA        26            28               20cm
ARHM ATA        26            28               20cm

Portable SAM    15            13                9cm (interpolated)
Light SAM       18            16               12cm
Medium SAM      28            30               22cm
Heavy SAM       29            32               23cm (interpolated)


Regarding the amror values for aircraft I get:

Assuming the aircraft to have the equivalent displacement of a hull in their
wings folded position, and using a 9ton roughly equal to a 13disp ton hull,
and assuming that the airframe weight is the skin (not a particularly good
assumption, but what the heck):

A Simple airframe would have an armor modifier of .024 (Armor 0)
A Fast Subsonic airframe would have an armor modifier of .121 (also 0)
A Transonic airframe would have an armor modifer of .243 (close to 1)
A Supersonic airframe would have an armor modifier of .49 (close to 2)
A Hypersonic ariframe would have an armor modifier of .73 (close to 3)

This was checked at TL7, armor type C.

In any case, alomost any hit would be considered "High Penetration" on an
aircraft.

However, there is still a problem when it comes to aircraft damage.  If you
look at something like the Phantom (oops..I mean the laramie (-:) you will
see that it has a base damage value of 108/270.  Am I supposed to multiply 
this by 10 for use in "personal" combat?  It\'s derived from the vehicle rules,
so tenetatively, I\'d say yes.  But, for sake of argument, let\'s say no for a
moment.  I fire at an oncoming Laramie with a handy Heavy SAM.  (Never know
what you might need on an adventure <snicker>).  Achieving exceptional success,
I see that I do 4x damage.  128 pts.  Whoof! <Cut to big cloud of smoke,
applause of audience, etc.>.  So far so good, although with Normal success
it would take four missiles to knock this thing down.

But, if we *are* supposed to multiply by 10, we have a damage value of 1080,
meaning that I need 9+ exceptional hits to knock down one plane.  If I have the
misfortune of needing to use an air to air missile instead, I could use up
67 1x damage IRHM (Sidewinders, red Tops, Aphids, whatever) to knock down
one jet.  At "damage as written", that is still 6+ missiles.

All of this is a contributing factor to the reason why my Traveller games very
seldom actually use much more of the rules than the task system and the back-
ground.

Any comments?

  They will probably appear there some time soon.

  Mixed notes:
  The decksplans are in 4 files. Each file is equivalent to one page and is to
be printed out separately. This was done for two reasons: 
  1. When all four pages were in one file, the screen update took *minutes* 
each time the view was changed or something added. I got fed up with this
rather quickly and changed it to 2 files of 2 pages each.
  2. The drawing-to-postscript routine seems to be buggy. It causes a system
crash if the drawing is more than one page large.

  The deckplans use the New Helvetica Narrow and Helvetica fonts. It might look
strange to print them out on a laser that don\'t have those fonts.

  I\'ll try to post the MT data and a description of the ships systems when I get
the time. (I won\'t do the same mistake twice so I refuse to mention a specific

First Example Laid Down: December 31, 2293

Fleets of Service: America (USSN, Marines), Australia

  Designed for the demanding XM-2291/AL-req.12.3 requirement, the
assault lander had a very bad start. The technology demonstator crashed
killing the pilot, after the advanced power plant caught fire. Two
redesigns followed, with 3 differing power plants. Two of the unmanned
test vehicles crashed in power plant fires, and the project manager
resigned.

  The American government intended to transfer the project to
Ramco-Grumman concern and, in an act of desperation, GAS decided to
install the well known, if not overly advanced General Electric MHD-3
into the remaining test vehicle.

  Surprisingly, the vehicle proved very reliable and quite versatile.
Within 2 months, the American government requested a pre-production run
of 5 vehicles.

  Heavily armoured and armed for ground support, the AL-22 proved to be
a very useful addition to the US Marine Drop Forces. However, it had
short range of operation. Anxcillary fuel tanks were installed to
rectify this problem.

  At the request of the USMC, a specialized gunship version was built,
to provide heavy support fire and defence suppression. The AL-22D has
50% more armour and more than twice the firepower, as well as an
extensive ECM suite.

  Elated with their success, GAS tried to produce a special, heavy
weapon, version. One AL-22D model was converted into a test vehicle in
which a 7cm mass driver was installed. This vehicle is now undergoing
trials, but the feeling is that such a vehicle shall not be needed.

  Recently, Senator Brian M. Cuff (D, Ellis) called for the installation
of a Jerome drive in the AL-22 line of landers instead of developing a
dedicated insystem troop transport.

  Each Marine Drop Battalion has 20 AL-22 landers, plus 5 AL-22D
gunships.

process of confirming my addresses and so forth extracted some data 
for us to gaze upon:

X-Thought: Is it paranoia if they really *are* out to get you?

Hello again all. I am currently in the process of restarting my
campaign, and a couple of my players have asked about the Imperial
Research Stations in the Spinward Marches. I know that one of them was
covered in a GDW adventure for Traveller Classic, but I can\'t find
much information on the others. What I would like to ask the list is
this: does anyone know if the purpose of such stations is listed
anywhere? By this I mean the actual research taking place at each of
the stations, rather than a list of things that such stations might be
conducting research into.

Thanks in advance for any info,
			     Derek.

  The new batch of space fighters of the American navy, designed for the
XSCVN-1 Ellis (since cancelled and scrapped) were designed to complement
each other. The SF-20 was to be escorted and protected by the SF-19,
while employing their missiles to attack larger targets, while the SF-21
was to maintain local space superiority.

  Surpisingly trouble-free development programme was followed by one of
the greatest disasters and jokes of the American space industry. The
carrier for which these craft were built suffered failure after failure.
For some reason, not a signle system built for the carrier operated as
required. The weapon systems could not lock on to a target, bay doors
refused to open and once open, refused to close, the engine used to
switch off during orbital injections and the escape pods would fire from
time to time. The closest any US crew came to a mutiny was after the
latrines aboard Ellis refused to operate, some 20 of them actually
reversing operation. After 7 years of testing and rebuilding, the
XSCVN-1 Ellis was declared non-space worthy and slated for scrapping.
At the request of the Navy, it was decided to allow the new SA/F-20
fighters to destroy the carrier, using live ammunition, as a training
excersize.

  The honour went to the 12th Space Attack Fighter Wing. On the 21st of
October, 2299, 10 fighter craft fired two missiles each. Only two
missiles detonated on reaching their target. A second salvo of missiles
produced five detonations. The carrier suffered heavy damage, but
refused to explode. SPACOM decided not to waste any more missiles on the
intransigent carrier. Four space tugs took it in tow, and pulled it into
an orbit which will impact the sun sometime during 2302.

  One result of the carrier project was the "Murphy Field Generator"
rumour, spread by the flight crew of the hapless ship.

  The second result is the unsolved problem haunting the fighter craft -
where and how to deploy them. Since they were designed for a carrier, no
thought was given to streamlining them.

  In the years to come, the USSN is going to search for ways to base
these fighters. There is already talk of "baby carriers," each fielding
two to three squadrons of fighter craft.

  The SF-19 was to be the escort for SA/F-20. It was the first of the
batch to be completed, and some of late pre-production developments were
incorporated into the other two craft.

  For a craft of this size, the sensors are very extensive, and pose a
considerable drain on the small power plant.

  An advanced power distribution system manages the power usage,
allowing the pilot and the WO to concentrate on other tasks. Since
operating both the laser and the sensors would leave the fighter dead in
space, normal procedure is to use the active sensors only for the most
necessary scans.

  The development of the SF-19 was surprisingly trouble free, and being
the cheapest of the three fighter craft, it has been procured in the
greatest numbers, for use as a fighter, short range interceptor and deep
space fighter for larger ships.

  The most pressing upgrade programme, as far as the Navy is concerned,
is to increase the range of the SF-19. There are two view points - to
decrease armour or to increase weight. SF-19XA and SF-19XB are test
craft, conducting such tests even now.

  The only unarmoured fighter among the three new designs, this
Bell-Boeing fighter poses considerable threat to larger ships, being
able to outrun almost every ship known to exist, while guiding two SIM-14
missiles simultaneously.

  Four of these ships with their escorts participated in the Battle of
Beowulf, scoring two kills (one Hotel and one Epsilon) and one damaged
(Beta).

  The Bobcats are supposed to operate with an escort of SF-19 fighters,
but are able to defend themselves with their two laser turrets.

  One of the three fighters designed for the projected (and cancelled)
deep space carrier, the Hellcat has more armour than any known combat craft.
>From the first day of its design envisaged as the primary interceptor
and space superiority fighter, the SF-21 had the most care lavished on
it. The design vindicated all expectations, being almost as fast as the
SF-19, and having 50% longer range.

  The fighter is yet too new to have any variants, but there are plans to
upgrade the sensor suites. Bearing in mind the high original cost of the
ships, it is highly probable that in the years to come these ships shall
be upgraded again and again.

     Hm.  Philosophy time, I suppose.  High fatality?  What\'s wrong
with burning and pillaging (no, no, no...first you pillage, *then* you
burn--get it right)?  I had a group of players who did mostly that, and
little else.  I thought it was a lot of fun, personally.

     Of *course* most people in my game walked around armed all the
time, PC and NPC alike.  After all, there were people like my PCs
wandering around loose (you know what the Zhodani say about the
Imperium, heh, heh, heh).  They called themselves the "Rabid Thunder-
Weasels Mercenary Legion."  They\'d do literally *anything*, if the
price was right.  And it suited them.  At the moment.  And something
more fun didn\'t come along in the meantime.  Situational ethics.  Lots
of fun...  ;-)

     Don\'t even ask me about the battle cry...  ;-)

	I have recently been fiddling around with large warship design,
mainly to get ready for the redesign of _Fighting Ships_, and became aware
of a potentially serious problem: I don\'t have all the errata for ship design.
I think before getting serious we should pool our info to make sure we are
all using the same rules.
Example problems from a past post by Rob Dean:

[Fighting Ships problems]
>Between the fact that the designers did not incorporate the errata that
>was available into the designs (such as reduced gunnery crews, reduced
>power cost of meson screens)
 ^^^^^^^^^^ - I don\'t have this.

[later in same article]
>Armor 100 (-20 on damage) is the level required to prevent any
>     spinal mount or nuclear missile form doing any damage on the
>     the surface damage table.

Some of the errata I do have has subtle consequences.  For instance, the
+6 on the damage tables was changed from just spinal mounts to any
weapon with UCP A+.  At TL 15, a 100 ton missile bay has a UCP A,
giving a +6, and it can fire nuclear missiles for a total of +12 - which
means it can damage a ship with armor between 100 and 117, something
no other non-meson weapon can do, and giving at least a potential reason
for armor in that range.

	Anyway, I have the 2nd printing of the Ref\'s Manual (the line
below the ISBN on the copyright page starts with a 2), and I have some,
but obviously not all, of the errata noted down in pencil.  The errata I have
were taken from Metlay\'s set as of a year ago.  I\'m going to check with
him again, and if you think you have any rare errata or subtle consequences
of existing errata, send me email, and I\'ll post a summary when I think
I have a reasonably complete set.
	Thanks,

you know about) will have e-mail available.  I will post everyone\'s
addresses tonight (I hope - maybe tomorrow).  

Be sure to copy personal messages to me.

Include a string in your subject line like PBEM PBM EPBM e-pbm or
something so I get the idea.

mark your subjects as (Public), (Personal),  (Turn) or (Confidential)
You can guess why.  I let a fe things slip before that I shouldn\'t
have.

If you need a reply or action from me, indicate this too.  Otherwise,
I will NOT respond, even to acknowledge receipt.

Many of last season\'s players have not yet checked in.  When you do 
finally come out of your party-induced stupor, we\'ll let you out of 
your stateroom and put you back on watch.  Otherwise you\'ll have to
watch from the sidelines.  Just check-in when you get a minute
(if you can hear me) and let me know if you can play this year.

I seem to be able to actually process a turn about once every two 
weeks.  If we continue to just play as the mood hits us, we should
be able to try to maintain this schedule.

All public-action turns (like "I\'m going to attempt to repair the
anit-matter conversion unit.") Must go through your Team Leader.
I\'ll let your fearless CO decide watch, quarter, and stations for
the crew, so this will fall out in the wash.  There shouldn\'t be
too many changes from last spring; most of the officers are back.

Private-action turns (like "I\'m telling Joe about the private flogging
I watched on Holo last night.") you should discuss with Joe.  Copy
me.  You\'ll hear about it if you get caught.  :-)

Try to only do one turn a week (at least only one Official turn).  
Otherwise, I lose track of synchronization between teams/groups.

========
Other than that some advice/suggestions:

Let\'s all try to stay in character.  I\'m one of the worst violators
of this most fundamental of RPG rules.  I\'ll try to do better.

We\'re here to have fun.  We seemed to do well last season by letting
our characters run away with us.  I will try a little harder to 
remind folks that we\'ve somewhat limited time, and to provide _outside_
stimulation. :-)

Some PC\'s are run by me.  Some NPC\'s are run by players.  I\'m not
telling which are which.  You might not know because some of them
have my e-mail address, or none; some of them have player e-mail
addresses.  I thought this might liven up things a little.

Remember, we seem to be having almost a false start - a lot of 
people will likely return sometime during play, so this can provide
an interesting diversion, too.

Feel free to offer suggestions/critique at any time.  If there\'s anything
at all that you want more or less of, let me know.

Duration ~25 minutes at full thrust.  Terminal velocity ~150 km/sec

Brain: 5 CPU, 11 Storage	IQ 1, Edu 1
Programs: Low Data, Limited Basic Command, Grav Vehicle-1

Notes: This drone can be used as a cheap alternative to conventional
HE missiles in starship combat.  It uses its Neutrino sensor to home
in on its assigned target. Rather than firing it out of a missile
rack, an easy way to launch it is to toss it out of the cargo bay
and order it to attack.  The lack of the warhead is not important
for long range space targets, since the KE of something moving at
over 100 km/sec far exceeds the output of conventional explosives.
It will obviously not work on any target that doesn\'t have a
working fusion plant, and is less effective against targets at
visual range or less.
	The Bighorn also has considerable space left in the hull,
and can be fitted with sensors and solar cells to give it longer
range and scouting capability.  It also is relatively easy to
install a more capable brain for more sophisticated tasks.

You can start playing now.  Try to wake up and take off from where you
went to sleep.  :-)

Here\'s a quick synopsis of Season One:

Several people have volunteered to undertake an exploration of a
newly-discovered, intact, ringworld.  This is a largely scientific
mission, underwritten by a Megacorporation.  The underwriters,
Turnskaad Enterprises (out of the Marches) have been very secretive
about the location of the new world, called R-alpha.

Most of the time so far has spent with pilots in simulations, engineers
trying to make some brand-new engines work right the first time, and
Security folks trying to get everyone else to hand over their weapons.

Scientists have pieced together an incomplete model of R-alpha, but
they do have good adeas about spin rate, gravitics, energy production, 
locations of possible lifeforms, and have identified a few good places
to land.

The exploration team has just nestled down for what might be an 
extended cruise at someone else\'s expense, and have had a rip-roaring
party.  (Mainly because the GM\'s machines went down and he had a
full-intellect immersion in work last June.)

Now people are starting to wake up to the lyrical sound of digitized
trumpet music on the intercom and the Navigator\'s sonorous tones:

"Yo!  Anyone awake back there?"

The idea William provoked in me was kinda sneaky/nasty.

A rather effective terrorist weapon could be constructed quite
easily using the Bighorn.

Just design them to remain quiescent for a specified period of
time (to allow them to get out of your vicinity), and to \'wake up\'
at random intervals after that time period and attack whatever
ship is closest.  If no ship is \'in range\', then it goes quiescent
for another random interval.

It\'s about the size of a meteor/asteroid, it has no fusion plant,
and would be virtually undetectable until it activated, at which
point it would probably be too late.

It\'s duration should be effectively infinite, because the launch
platform (any reasonably sized ship) brings it up to "cruising speed"
and sets it\'s course, not it\'s internal motors.  Internal power isn\'t
used until it starts \'waking up\', and even then, it doesn\'t use a lot
of power until it starts attacking.

Build zilions of them, and you\'ve got a sort of \'doomsday/berserker\'
weapon.
			    How\'s that for terror?

    'body' => 'New Erratum Noted:

     In the starship design system, the crew is divided into segments per
each 1350kl, according to the rules.  The example makes it clear that this is
intended to be per 13500kl (i.e. 1000tons not 100).

Suggested Rules Modification:

     The calculation of aircraft agility given in COACC was taken directly from
Striker.  However, a maximum agility of 6 is permitted in COACC, where there was
no limit in Striker.  Almost any aircraft with a maximum speed of 600kph or more
(which is most) will max out at agility 6.  

Rather than read the formula (((MS/100)+G)*(100/(100-ME))+MP) Watch those
parentheses carefully...

I would suggest:

(((MS/1000)+G)*(100/(100-ME))+MP) which gives you some incentive to use the more
expensive control types and/or to devote a significant fraction of your aircraft
weight to \'Maneuver Enhancement\'.  Supersonic fighters with speeds of 2000 or
more and G ratings of 2+ will tend to have high agilities, just from that, but
a lowly TL5 biplane can devote 80% of its weight to ME (two wings, low wingload-
ing, whatever) and still get a respectable number.  He can\'t run, but he can 
sure turn.

(Of course, it\'s all academic as I don\'t have any airplanes in my game right
now.)

Model 27 Amphibious Light Tank TL8

     The Model 27 is produced by Pegasus Industries of Overnale for export
to a variety of local markets.  The Model 27 is an amphibious vehicle not
intended for heavy combat, and is only armored to withstand hits from 4cm
and smaller guns.  The vehicle is provided with a sealed environment system
to permit operations in NBC conditions.  The heavy machine gun is mounted
on a pintle alongside the commanders hatch, and the two light machine guns
are mounted coaxially with the 10cm gun/mortar and in the bow.  The coax
machine gun can be fired by the gunner (but not at the same time that the
main gun is being fired), and the bow machine gun can be fired by the driver
when the vehicle is stationary.

Kestrel Class Interface Fighter TL13

     The Kestrel is produced under license in the Spinward Marches by LSP
in their Lunion shipyards.  The Kestrel is a compromise design--some 
capability for space combat was considered to be essential, but the 
main use was anticipated to be atmospheric combat. Accordingly, the 
computer installation was limited to a Model 3, which still accounts for
50% of the vehicle cost.

Duke Boris class Mercenary Cruiser TL13

     The Duke Boris class is produced by ConTech of Glisten, at a lower
tech level than possible there, for ease of owner maintenance in operations.
Essentially desinged as a competitor to the fairly common Broadsword class,
the Duke Boris is equipped with a Raptor lander and four Kestrel fighters,
whose cost is included below.  Provision for twenty troops is made, which
restricts the types of operations that can be undertaken by a Duke Boris
equipped mercenary outfit.

Dromedary Armored Recovery Vehicle TL10

     The Dromedary is desinged to complement the Tiger series of infantry
combat vehicles, but can be used as a recovery vehicle in support of any
grav vehicle equipped with lifting hook mounts, and having a gross weight
of less than 200 tons.  Since disabled grav vehicles cannot be towed, the
practical solution to battlefield recovery of damaged vehicles is something
like the Dromedary, equipped to carry off disabled vehicles as a sling load.
The Dromedary is equipped with four heavy robotic arms to enable the sling
to be rigged without leaving the vehicle when conditions make this necessary,
and it should be noted that the one HUD provided as part of the control 
system is used by the vehicle recovery specialist.

Model 28B Air Defense Vehicle TL8

     The Model 28B is produced by Pegasus Industries of Overnale for export 
to a variety of local markets.  Based on the hull of the Model 28 APC, the 
main change is the addition of a larger engine, needed to cope with the 
increased vehicle weight resulting from provision for carrying fairly large 
quantities of ammunition for the autocannon.  A radar system for target 
acquisition missile direction has also been added.  The main drawback of 
the design is that the amphibious capability is greatly reduced.  The 
manufacturer does not recommend attempting amphibious operation without 
offloading most of the 4cm ammunition and all four of the SAMs.  It should 
be noted that the missiles each cost Cr142,000, making a full ammunition 
load worth several times the value of the vehicle.

Manzikert class Destroyer TL15

     Designed by the Imperial GListen Navy as the Type 1108, the Manzikert 
is not intended for independent operations.  The strategist/designers 
intended it to be used as part of a balanced escort/light force grouping
consisting of the general purpose Type 1107s, the high agility Yataghan 
missile boats, and the Manzikert class meson gun carriers.  The Manzikert
is one of the smallest jump capable craft anywhere in the Imperial 
inventory to carry a spinal meson gun, and almost everything else in the 
design process was sacrificed to achieve that objective.
     The large fusion plant is usually operated at approximately one-third 
its full capacity, which provides maneuver and life support power.  
Endurance given below is at this reduced rate, and full power time can be 
traded on a one hour for three hour basis (Operating the plant at high 
capacity for anything less than an hour causes difficulties in changeover.)

Draft Imperial 10000ton Fleet Escort TL15

     This draft design was produced on 29 September 1990.  In order to 
fit the desired main armament of a meson gun bay, it is necessary to have a 
power plant roughly twice as large as the maneuver/life support 
requirement.  Endurance given below is for no combat use of power.  Combat 
power consumes 2 days of non-combat power per day.

Draft Imperial 10000ton Fleet Escort TL14

     This draft design was produced on 29 September 1990.  In order to 
fit the desired main armament of a meson gun bay, it is necessary to have a 
power plant roughly twice as large as the maneuver/life support 
requirement.  Endurance given below is for no combat use of power.  Combat 
power consumes 2 days of non-combat power per day.  Basically, this was 
designed backwards from the TL15 version, the main difference being the 
large increase in power plant size needed at TL14, and corresponding 
changes in fuel capacity.  To keep the fuel capacity at over 30 days at 
running power, it was necessary to trim the fuel purifier back to 18 hour 
capability.

Draft Imperial 10000ton Fleet Escort TL13

     This draft design was produced on 30 September 1990.  Like the TL14 
version, this one was pretty much designed backwards from the TL15.  
However, I didn\'t think that a Meson Gun-3 was very attractive as a main 
armamenet, so I replaced it with two PA-9s.  Not great, but at least they 
take less energy.  The running power on this one is 2/3 of full power, so
each combat day/hr uses up 1.5 running days/hrs.  Due to the decrease in 
overall power requirement, I was able to keep the endurance up and still 
stick in a 12 hr fuel purifier.

Vanguard class Orbiter TL7

     The six ships of the Vanguard class are the mainstays of the space 
program of the government of Crout (Glisten Subsector).  Designed for a 
vertical launch, the vehicle is winged and lands on a runway.  A Vanguard 
can lift up to 154tons of cargo into a stable planetary orbit.
     The solar cell module is provided for long-endurance missions, and 
consists of an array of folding screens.  It may not be deployed while the 
ship is under acceleration.  Power is provided from the rocket motors 
during maneuvers. Turnaround time from landing to launch is usually about 
13 days. Approximately 6.2 minutes of acceleration are required to achieve 
stable orbit.  Life support is limited to the crew and cargo compartments.

Modified IDP-9734 class Freighter TL9
     
     The IDP-9734 (Imperial Data Package) is a standard design going back 
to pre-imperial times.  It is a simple in-system freighter using fusion 
rockets for propulsion, and is very cost competitive with grav-driven 
vehicles of similar performance.  The version shown below has been modified 
by the addition of a 5MW beam laser for support of asteroid mining and 
prospecting.  Since the total output of the fission pile is 5MW, the laser 
can only be operated for limited periods, unless the crew is willing to 
rely on vacc suits for life support.

     The IDP-9851 (Imperial Data Package) is a standard design going back 
to pre-imperial times.  It is a deep space capable craft using a fusion 
rocket drive, advantageous when away from a planetary gravity well.  Two 
standard grav powered landers are carried for planetside operations.

IDP-9851/L Lander TL9

     The IDP-9851/L lander is included as part of the IDP-9851 patrol boat 
design.  It includes a minimum size fusion plant and a conventional grav 
unit developing 380 tons of thrust.  While 121.8kl of cargo space is 
included in the design, carrying a full 121.8 tons of cargo results in a 
useful acceleration of 0.06G, making an orbital ascent very time consuming.  
Performance statisitics given below are for an unloaded vehicle.

 Does  anyone  know if Digest Group Publications (DGP) of Boise, Idaho still
 sell  their  "Computer Software for TRAVELLER" ? Whilst browsing through my
 local  gamestore  the  other  day,  I picked up a couple of old Traveller\'s
 Digests  (a  DGP publication). Inside the back cover was an advert for this
 software under the description "Disk 1 : WordGen/Bestiary".

 Has anyone tested it out ?

 Is it worth my getting hold of a copy (assuming it is still available).

 Have  they  added  to  their  list  of Traveller-approved computerised game
 aids, or is this a one-off ?

 All replies acknowledged by mail - honest !

 All the best,

 Hugh.

the Imperium, and how much it would cost to maintain them.  In support of 
a test campaign I am setting up, I worked out the following group.  Vehicles
mentioned are all from my vehicle uploads.  Annual costs for maintenance and
personnel are taken from Striker.  

As an armored group, it will be quickly noticed that upkeep of vehicles is a
larger expense than payment of troops.  A middle passage repatriation bond
for this unit (abandoning vehicles, is that right?) would run just over MCr1.6,
which is less than the monthly break-even contract rate. I haven\'t yet gone on
and figured what kind of ammunition expenditures, etc, would be required to
keep this unit going.  I also am not yet sure what combat value a unit this size
will have.  It seems likely to be rather fragile, but that is what the campaign
is going to find out.  I\'d be particularly interested in hearing from anyone
who has ever tried running large mercenary units in extended campaigns.

Good Gaming,

up-to-date the data is, ie pre vs post shattered Imperium.  Although they
do call it "Second Survey Data" and if this corresponds to the Imperium\'s
Second Survey then it is pre-shattering.
  The other program is a computerized version of the World Builder\'s

Rocket Interceptor TL6
 
     The rocket interceptor is capable of flight beyond a planetary 
atmosphere, and thus provides some limited capability for planetary defense 
at fairly low tech level.  With no onboard radar, the pilot is completely 
dependent on ground based intercept instructions.  Usual operating mode is 
to use 70-80% of the fuel to reach a suborbital trajectory, retaining the 
remainder for final attack maneuvers.  The pilot then makes a deadstick 
landing upon reentry.

Intruder High Speed Recon Aircraft TL8
 
     The Intruder is a specialized reconaissance aricraft usually built in 
very small numbers.  Its normal mode of operation is to cruise on its 
turbofan engine using fuel from external tanks as close as practical to its 
objective.  The tanks are then jettisoned, the ramjets ignited, and the 
aircraft makes a very speed pass over the target, using radar or 
photographic equipment.

Yeah, RSN.  It was supposed to be last Christmas.  I can find out from
some contacts just what held them up, if you like.

In general DGP products are better and more useful than GDW products.
This seems to be true of MT anyway, as GDW became far too busy with
other projects to spend much time on MT after the initial boxed set.
DGP products seem to well exceed the quality of many of the "Approved
for use with [Classic] Traveller" publications of times past.

There is a review of this somewhere on line in the archives.  Really
good material, although it does raise some questions for physics types.
Good layout and illustration of a Trader ship, really makes it come to
life.  There is a Vol 2 in the works, but it hasn\'t been announced.  I
really ate this material up.

There is a review of this somewhere on line in the archives.  It\'s a
little buggy, but I find it somewhat useful.  Generation is quite
time-consuming, unless it is done by computer! One of the listees (I can
find out who) has a program on line which does something like the WB
program advertised by DGP, but last I heard it needed to have all the
copyrighted material built-in, stripped out, to avoid possible copyright
conflictsas a "derived work".

provide a brief review of it.

Ever since the venerable Book 5: High Guard came out, I\'ve always wondered
about the hows and whys of starship operation. Since most campaigns are closely
involved with starships, it never hurts to know some of the details. Besides,
it adds to the flavor and enjoyment of a game to have a clear picture of the
location.

In my opinion, the SOM fits the bill perfectly. It covers all the major ship
systems, from jump drive to stateroom accomodations. I found the handwaving
explaining the theory behind jump drives and reactionless thruster plates of
particular interest, as well as the details on starship security.

The flowcharts of shipboard systems should be of particular interest to
referees and players alike. Now you have a number of ways that something can
go wrong. The pictures and brief blurbs of various areas aboard ship are also
enlightening.

So, I\'d give it a thumbs up... I\'d be interested to know a couple of things
about other DGP items: When will the next volume in the SOM be out and what
will it cover? When will more alien modules be out?

Thanks.

This is probably a silly question, but has anyone written a ship design
generator?  (A deckplan generator would be a plus but I guess you can\'t
have everything ;-)).  I\'m preparing a rather large campaign that will be
dealing with a LOT of ship to ship combat from varying Tech levels and it
would be EXTREMELY helpful not to have to reinvent the wheel.

     In our campaign we use most of these (except for `Manhunt\'). As a
humble PC (8-))I feel I can comment of a couple of them.

                           >101 Vehicles<

     Very helpful, as much player time is spent getting around on a
variety of planets. The illustrations (with scale) are most helpful.
The groupings seem to be a little chaotic, but managable. Very few
obvious errors.

                 >Starship Operator\'s Manual Vol. 1<

     As our group uses a modified `Beowulf\' class ship, this has
become one of our most used manuals. The illustrations are great, the
flowcharts are acceptable, and the anecdotal comments by the `Old
Timer\' add color to what otherwise could be a dry operators guide. The
operations tasks listed in the back seem to be consistant, but may be
a bit overwhelming. The index is one of the best in DGP history.....

                     >World Builder\'s Handbook<

     A massive amount of information which, depending on how you run
your campaign, may or may not be useful. It may be worth the cost if
you purchase it for no other reason than the Survey Equipment listed
in the middle. As far as the actual `World Building\', Whew!! I would
only go into the detail that this generates if the group were going to
spend a looong time in one spot (can you say Overkill?). And I don\'t
believe it takes into account Really Alien worlds (what ARE the mating
habits of a race that enjoys living on Neptune....).

     Hope this sheds a little light!

Here it IS!  The long-awaited return of the MT PBEM.
Turn 10.1
(I\'m calling this season 10, I guess just to be binary.)

====================================
Nishu Neriika, navigator and second in command of the Transport team,
  raises his head from the smooth surface of his console and looks
  around at the mess that the jumpspace-entry party has left of the
  Alcyon\'s bridge.  He seems to be alone - at least, no one else is
  stirring yet.

Groaning, he stands.  One foot crushes the few Cheezies left in the
  crumpled bag lying on the deck.  The undulating gray of jumpspace,
  visible through the forward windows, does unpleasant things to his
  stomach until he turns away.

"Yo!  Anyone else on watch here?"


There are a few moments of dead silence.


The Alcyon\'s ship-wide intercom blares to life (and way too loud for many
of the party-goers) with a really horrible trumpet fanfare, followed by
this announcement:
    "Bishop to crew.  For those of you that missed to party last night,
and for those of you that attended but don\'t remember any of it, I\'m
done splicing and dubbing.  We\'ll be showing \'The Imperium\'s Funniest
Home Videos\' in the crew lounge at 1400 hours.  Be there to defend your
honor.  And for those of you that don\'t believe it, \'Vouf really can
play that thing.  I have proof on tape.  That is all."


The noxious blarings of Bishop\'s trumpet fanfare slowly drift into silence.
After a decent pause (out of respect for the party casualties), the shipwide
communicator is again activated, but now at a more tolerable volume level.

"Doctor Van Der Merwe speaking. SynthaholFlush (tm) tablets are now available
 at the Alcyon medic station and the main medical facilities aboard the Aurora.
 TAKE ONLY ONE with plenty of fluid. Physical and mental disabilities will be
 cured within 15 minutes. Any additional mental problems are caused by reality
 and are thus your problems.

 Suggestions for Mr. Bishop\'s next physical examination will be accepted from
 the party casualties on a volunteer basis. The person with the most creative
 entry wins a stylish "INS SUCKS" button in several galactic languages. That
  is all."


  The various personal commdots and transmitters that the persons in the
engineering department are(?) wearing suddenly (and loudly, those who were at 
The party probably think) beeps and comes alive:

  "Ehhh, good morning. Johann here. I assume that everyone is awake and
at least slightly mentally present. If you arn\'t, call me.... Eh no, those who
*are* present, call me <slight pause with the sound of something running>
keep away from my anti-hangover pills, bit! NO! put it down now! come back
here you bloody rat!.... <the transmission ends>"



<click!>
Awwwwwright! (damn that hurts!)  Just becuase we had a great time
last night don\'t mean we gotta skimp on the physical fitness!   PT
happens on the \'Talisman\'s cargo deck in 5 minutes!
<click>


Seemingly, only half the crew have managed to awaken.  Those who made
it through morning PT, with the help of one of the engineering robots,
put all the rest in their cabins.  The doctor places medical sensors
on each in turn, and the doors are locked.  (now, if you wake up you
have to call  the GM, the doctor, and the CO before you can go on duty.)

A final announcement before duties/play resume:
<click>  (why do they still click after all these centuries?)

You all, of course, still remember the lilting harmony of your
beloved Captain\'s Darrian accent:
"All hands not actually on duty muster in the recreation area
at 14:00 hours.  All hands to muster at 14:00 hours.  Department
heads perform equipment and personnel checks and report to
me on the Bridge by 12:00 hours.  That is all."

(and somebody fix that click - Richard :-)
<click>


At 1400 hours, Doc Werner wanders the corridors seemingly lost.  No, 
make that LOST.  At 1410 he still hasn\'t found the crew quarters and 
is about to give it up and head back to his 4 dimensional communications
relay compensation simulation.  At 1420, unable to find his quarters, 
Doc Werner walks into the darkened crew lounge unaware that he\'s standing 
right in the middle of the holo projection.  He is at once happy to have 
found his fellow crewman and baffled about their apparent irritation with
him...

Greetings!

      I hope I have these time-space coordinates correct.......

Anyway I hope that someone can straighten my notions of weapon combat
out before I run my first game. (NEVER played before- ME THE GM!)

    1)  Some of the weapons can shoot more than one shot per round.
       If a gun can release five bullets per pull of the trigger, does
       he have to attack the same target?

    2)  If the above player wants the five bullets to hit one target,
       Does the player roll once for all slugs or is it 1 roll per
       slug?

    3)    When it comes down to whittling away the amount of damage
        any weapon does, what happens to fractions?  Dropped, saved
        till they equal a point or WHAT? 

            ( A nice detailed report of this one would be helpful )

I suppose that is all for now!         

Thanks.         Chris Niziol      (CJNST@UNIX.CIS.PITT.EDU)

Well, I\'m glad you asked...

Currently I\'m writing a MegaTraveller ship design program (with help
from Dan Corrin) and it has reached the stage of being able to produce
designs.  It has a few problems with calculating totals for the ship
(power, volume, price, weight) which I\'m working on at present (I think the
problems lie in incorrect data tables rather than bad code).

Apart from that, it needs a nice final output routine that matches the
MT format (currently, it lists the totals for the design and the entire
list of things that the design includes).  A nicer user interface would
also be a big plus.

When the program finally gets finished (it\'s been kind of a long project),
I expect it will become public domain.  At the very least it will go into
the traveller archive and might also be sent here. (these are admin details
which I\'m not much good at processing).

More details should follow when the thing is ready!

The people doing the redesign of Fighting Ships will also greatly
appreciate this program.  For those interested, the program is written
in reasonably portable C and uses a HUGE data table (100k+) to keep all
MT specific info (except for a couple of exceptions :-),  at present the
thing is loosly menu driven.

	Hows this for a medium sized ship design (it took a little over
one hour to produce using the forthcoming ship design program, most of
the time was spent doing the design evaluation by hand).

The design program does (finally) work correctly (I hope), it just needs
a some tidying up around the edges to make it more user-friendly and
a little extra manipulation of the database.

This is basically an attempt to pack a spinal meson gun-T into a very
small ship and to then give it sufficient defences to survive for a
couple of rounds in combat.  Special measures were taken to provide
maximum possible defence to incoming meson fire.

This series of ships was never intended to stay on station for extended
periods.  Its primary function being to cause as much damage as possible
to enemy fleets in a combat situtation.


Would this sort of ship fit into the TML\'s version of Fighting Ships???
[ I spent a fair bit of time getting designs highly optimised under the
old High Guard rules and MT was too complex for that ]

Hello,

  You have made the company vehicle and personnel heavy. It bacame a
battalion (-).

  Let\'s see... I shall use generic company structure.


        Enlisted NCO Officers
Section   7-8     -     -
Squad      15     1     -       Sgt
Platoon    30     2     1       2x Sgt, 2Lt
Company    90     7     5       6x Sgt, MSgt, 4x 2Lt, Lt

  This is as far as direct increase is carried. The next level is
already a Battalion, having organic support echellons.

A Battalion would have:

  1 HQ Platoon(+) (Staff, Intelligence, Medical, Supply and Logistics -
                  officer heavy)
  1 FS Platoon (Heavy mortars, ATGWs, etc)
  1 Signals section + NCO
  1 Recon squad
  3 Companies

  Thus: 402 personnel, of them 24 officers (8 in the HQ platoon).

  Vehicle-wise, you made a classic organizational mistake. There are too
many vehicle types for a single LOW level unit. The variety may be
encountered in a brigade (more probably in a division), but not in a
battalion and certainly NOT in a company. For an infantry battalion you
would have some type of a fast, small, vehicle for all battalion assets
together with a number of medium load vehicles. The FS platoon, parts of
the HQ platoon and the companies would have some types of APC (ACV or
Grav or even tracked). The mixing of unit types comes only at the brigade
level. At battalion level, the entire unit is of a single type (infantry,
mechanized infantry, armour, etc).

  If the battalion is a mercenary battalion, than AT LEAST one training
company must be included, probably two. This would make the battalion into
a battalion(++).

                           Yours in advance,

                 yaniv, Sgt(res), Division \'The Steel\'

  Carrying the mercenary unit structure further, I\'d like to design a
mercenary brigade. For this purpose I do not intend to use specific
vehicles, weapons or technology level. The only assumptions I am making
are:

        1. The unit is at least TL8.

        2. That it is an ad hoc formation, based on the battalion I
           posted earlier.

Brigade, Mercenary, Heavy:

  1 HQ company(+)

          6 Heavy Trucks
          6 Tank/ARV
          5 SPA

        Of these, the greatest variety is in the APC. Some 37% are
        standard infantry APC of the appropriate TL. The rest are almost
        evenly divided between Fire Support, Command Centre, Signals,
        and Artillery Ammunition Carriers. Finally there is a handful of
        ATGW APCs. These can all be based on the same type. In fact, the
        CC and SIG models may be very similar.


  This formation is slightly lopsided. It would do much better _without_
the Training battalion. I assume that a mercenary _unit_ would have
almost 30% of its personnel as trainees at a given time. Of these, 50%
are of a sufficient level to accompany the unit in the field, without
unduly straining the logistic echelons of the unit. Of course, such
consideration comes only at the brigade, the division and the corps
level. The training sub-unit would have to be self-supporting as far as
logistics are concerned.

  I decided to give the brigade its own artillery assets. This is to
allow the brigade to be independent of the employer. The battalions are
dependent on their organic fire support platoons.

  The problems of this formations are, as always, logistics. If the unit
is to operate without advanced support formations, the soldiers must be
their own logistics experts. Everything from system D to systemized
liberation of supplies and fuel will have to tolerated or seen to by the
hiring government. A second, glaring, problem is the lack of organic air
assets unless the unit is grav capable.

  The brigade is heavy in the sense that it can (almost) operate alone.
It is a formidable force, but a breakable one. It must mainly haul
ammunition and replacement parts and rely for food and fuel on the hiring
party. The equipment must be highly standardize. The brigade must
establish a good staging area if it is to conduct lengthy operations.

Listees -

     Hi, I am new to The List so if this question has been asked before
sorry.  I am setting up an empire of my own (ie. distinct from the usual
Imperium and possibly coexisting) and I have just one question:  Where
does one get 5800 different names for the stars/main worlds (9 sectors at 
50% density)?

     My first inclination is to duplicate names already used but that is
not very attractive, especially if the two empires coexist.  Moreover, my
empire has an alien race as its "ruling species" hence alien sounding
names would be better.

     Random word generators (ala MT) produce far too few usable names and
require me to read 100\'s in search of the few suitable names.  Any ideas?

Thank (in advance)

Tony Hayes (alias Kobi Steele - Space Pirate!)

	Well, as you pointed out, randomly-generated names are a bit of
	a bind sometimes (though there\'s quite a good one available from
	the archive-server@joshua.atherton.com), so I always think of
	some underlying reason for names of systems.

	Which isn\'t as hard as it seems ... Niven\'s worlds hold some
	marvellous evocative names - Jinx, WeMadeIt, Mount Lookitthat
	(did I spell that right? Hmm..), but perhaps you\'re looking
	for something a bit more ... serious.
	If you\'re really designing an empire, and not just a series
	of systems, then you\'ll know (or will make up now!) the sorts
	of people who discovered the systems in the first place. Was
	it corageous explorers? Then they\'ll name them after places
	back home (like the Mayflower people ...) or trite descriptive
	names. Perhaps after their favourite authors and musicians, if
	they were more likely to be \'gentlemen explorers\'. If they
	were governmental agents, then they would be designated a code
	name (like LV-426) and named much later by the settelers (Acheron).

	So, get your thinking cap on! Naming systems I have used with
	some success in the past (ie no-one knew where I got them from)
	have included 2000AD artists (Bolland, Dillon, Ezquerra, etc),
	Tolkien dwarf names (for the mining settlements, you see!),
	names of fish (for the water-worlds...) and so on. Or perhaps
	something un-related ... after all, the craters and mountains
	of our fair moon are all named after scientists and mathematicians,
	so perhaps there\'s a lesson to be learnt from there!

	(Mind you, it\'s not always easy to think up things like that ...
	 perhaps a few nice topics can be suggested that provide good
	 system/planet names? And bear in mind that if a section of the
	 empire was won from another species, they\'d already have names
	 them in their own language ... so crank out the random name
	 generators with a clear concience!)

1) If you don\'t mind spending the bucks for it, a good biographical
dictionary is an excellent source of names.  So is any good encyclopedia.

2) The cheap way to do the same thing, for people names, is to get a copy
of a phone book for any major city, but Manhattan is probably one of the 
best.

3) An atlas, and/or an almanac (which lists names of towns, counties, etc.)

4) A dictionary of mythology, or a dictionary of Saint Names

5) A good thesaurus


>From what I have seen, people name places after (a) obvious geographical
features, (b) famous people, (c) important ideas, or (d) other places.

Examples include (a) Falling Rock, (b) Washington, (c) Intercourse (yes,
there is a town named Intercourse), or (d) New York (which used to be New
Amsterdam).

Generally, I think stars will be named after people, probably very famous
real persons or mythological figures.  As for planets, anything goes.  And
when it comes to moons or asteroids, of which there are usually an abundance,
especially below the 100 km. size range, you can expect some of the names to
be damn silly.

If you need a randomizer, there are several methods.  I usually just flip
through pages with my eyes closed and stab a finger down at random intervals;
if I like the name I find, I take it.  If not, I keep going.  When I get
through one list of names, I either start over or go back.

Another method would be to throw two or three ten-siders (depending on the
size of the book) and use that as your page number, or a number to add to
your current page.  If you reach the end of the book, either subtract your
total from the length of the book and use that as your new starting page
number, or just start over.

By the way, I totally forgot another useful source of names.  Baby name
books!  (You can find some that have ten thousand names in them, and there
is at least one "Baby Names from Around the World" books for that international
flavor.  Another source is books of folklore, or folk tales, etc., since
these will have famous cultural figures listed (as the characters in the
stories).

I hope this helps.

Enjoy.

Mark

Hi all, I will be off to Gamemaster \'90 in Boise this weekend.  It
appears that this Con will be well attended by local TML subscribers:

	Ron Abramson, Boise ID (cowriter of "Total Recall" adventure)
	Richard Johnson, Hillboro OR (TML PBEM Referee)
	Mark Cook, Corvallis OR (kid who won the Traveller\'s Digest
		random drawing some months back :-)
	James Perkins, Portland OR (TML Administrator)

I also suspect that some Digest Group Publications folks will be there
that we can install as honorary TML members.  Mark, Richard, and I will
be carpooling the 400-odd miles to attend the event (thanks, Mark!).

Some of the adventures at the Con (these are from mail sent by Ron
Abramson):

	AD&D: written by Jeff Latimer  Rounds 1-3
	GURPS Space: Based on the movie _Total Recall_, the adventure is
	       being written and run by Ken Brough, Jeff Waldeck and me
	       (excuse my immodesty, but this should be _fun_) Rounds 2-3
	MegaTraveller: "Antares Down" run by Joe Fugate and Gary Thomas Round 4

	The time that the rounds will run are:

	Round 1: 8:00 - 11:30 AM
	Round 2: 12:00 - 3:30 PM
	Round 3: 4:00  - 7:30 PM
	Round 4: 8:00 - 11:30 PM

I\'m planning to attend Antares Down for sure, and maybe Total Recall
(although I don\'t know if they\'ll let someone in whose closest brush
with GURPS was several months playing Metagaming\'s The Fantasy Trip).

If you are planning to go, drop me a line this week, so I can know
who to watch for (or should that be, "watch out for" :-).  If you don\'t
know us by name, watch for the TML references scribbled on our name
badges.

Bis Spaeter,
James

PBEM ----  Turn 10.2 ----

Some of the best role-playing I\'ve ever seen happened this last week.
unfortuanely - it was all private stuff between two or three players.

I\'m posting this as a turn so we can get on with the game.  Our beloved
CO really does have an announcement, but his player is incredibly busy at
work right now.  I\'m going to excercise GM privilege and make his 
announcement for him.  It IS fair to chew me out later for omissions and
errors, and for saying the wrong things.

===================================================================

(People start waking up and crawling down the passageway to sick bay.
 A general announcement says that there is an all-hands muster at 14:00.
 The doc and the engineering robot carry the totally incapacitated
 back to their cabins and lock them in.)


At around 13:30 or so you begin to gather in the rec area.  Ranks are
noticably thinned.

Nishu scratches his head.  "I\'ve been to a lot of parties in my time, 
but I\'ve NEVER seen anyone get this blitzed.  I wonder if something was 
wrong with the refreshments?"

"What about Fritz?" asks Etienne.  "Fritz Severin." 
        [That\'s really `Fitz\' btw -- Richard]

Nishu looks sheepish.  "Um, I\'m not sure, sir.  I thought I heard someone over
the intercom yelling about calisthenics on the cargo deck, but I couldn\'t
tell if that was him or somebody else."

"Anyway - we are secure in jumpspace.  Engineering reports no problems with
grid.  Current ETA at midpoint is roughly 152 hours.  One quiet week in jump,
the refuel stop - leastways, I assume that\'s why we\'d be popping out in deep
space - and another week after that."

"I believe Bortai Narayanan left ship before we jumped, something about family
matters."

"I don\'t think we actually have to refeul.   We have enough H2 left for one more
jump, although I\'m not sure how big a one."



(Hssssssssssssssssssssssssssss...CLick...Click...CLICK...cli.........Hssss)

     [a very low background hiss comes on the Engineering Comm dots,
communicators, etc.]

     "Uh, Chief? This is Zben. I found that annoying click in the comm
channels.... There was a bug in the system". [In the background is
heard surpressed laughter, from someone else in the room]. "I mean, a
Real bug, y\'know, with eight legs and all that? It welded itself
across a power lead in the Comm relay.... Ummmm, request permission to
seal room and spray with Bio-hazard Away?" [The background laughter
is no longer surpressed; someone is Very Amused...]

<no click :->
  "Johann here, there are some administration things for engineering that we\'ll
have to take care of. Most important are evaluating the number of engineers
need on each of our vessels and work out which of us that takes care of which
ship. Vouf, Zben, Fritz, how many engineers would you think is needed on each of
the ships? Take different missions like standby, orbiting, insystem transfer and
jump into account. We\'ll talk about this, say, 15minutes after the muster ends.
Also, I never heard from anyone but Vouf, Zben and Fritz, Are the rest of the
team asleep? 4 men and a robot sounds more like an bad holo sitcom than a
engineering team."



Amidst the still-partially-hung-over bustle in the Rec Room, the door
opens at precisely 1400 hours and Bhyarrvouf comes in. His normal
loping crouch has been replaced by an easy, arrogant saunter, and his
grimy Engineer\'s coveralls are nowhere in sight. In their place, he
now wears a flashy black and silver uniform with metallic trim and a
number of ribbons and patches in an unrecognizable ranking scheme. He
looks around the room once, and pauses to nod to each of the Team
Leaders, with a wry half-smile to Dr. Van der Merwe. He steps over to
Dr. Abuko and whispers, "I\'ll speak to you after the muster. But first
things first." Without waiting for an answer, he turns away and
lightly bounds up onto the podium, where he stands stiffly at parade
rest, approximately two meters behind and to the right of where
Commander Ger will stand to address the crew.... 


Almost immediately Count Ger strides in from the other end of the room.
Stepping before you he pauses only briefly to look over the remnants
of the crew.

"Well, we haven\'t much time for meeting like this.  You can see for
 yourselves how the ranks have thinned.  I won\'t bother with the roll;
 It\'ll sound like we just lost a battle, not had a party.

 First, as you might have noticed, we now have an executive officer.
 It\'s no longer necessary for me to stand both port and starbord 
 bridge watches.  \'Vouf\'s PRIMARY responsibility will now be on the
 command team, and secondary responsibility to engineering.
 (In game terms, this means you can send mail to Mike, instead of
  Dan, who is terribly busy for a few months.  Otherwise, the command
  structure is unchanged.  RJ)

 We should be re-entering normal space in 6 hours.  We should emerge
 in deep space, about halfway to R-alpha.  Our orders say we should
 meet a refuelling tender, and a troop carrier with whom we can make
 some personnel changes.  I have four resumes so far: one scout, one
 engineer, one armsman, ... and a [he _almost_ pauses] lawyer.

 Tursnkaad\'s errand boy, Ian Thomas, will be put off when we dock.
 Apparantly he was only here to pass some information to the lawyer.
 While, in a crunch, he might be useful, I doubt he\'d do us a lot of 
 good stuck, in a coma, in a cabin.

 Dr. Van Der Merwe.  Get whatever resources you need, and put the rest
 of the out-of-service characters into a slow, or stasis, or cold-sleep.
 I don\'t want them using resources, dieing, or who-knows-what.  While
 you\'re at it, find out why no one is waking up - or dieing either.
 You can draft whatever you need out of the science teams for it.


 Next, just before the party, Seargant Hammer found a locator beacon,
 a very sophisitcated one, hidden in one of the passageways of the
 Alcyon.  It was probably put there during the initial loading.  Who
 ever did it is, in all likelihood, either no longer on the ship (one
 of the Turnskaad stevedores) or is not now awake.  In any case, 
 all of you should be on your toes.  No telling what it was used for.
 I\'ll take a few brief suggestions whether to attempt disinformation
 or to simply destroy it.

 As soon as we pick up our new crew and passenger, we\'ll need a really
 brief get together to discuss the next phase of our mission, and
 pass along the new watch bill.

 As always, my cabin door is open.  If you\'ve got any troubles, bring
 \'em forward, then we can solve \'em.

 Dismissed."


===========================================================

As predicted, the Alcyon enters normal nothingness at 18:00 on the nose.
At 18:05, sensors report uncloaking of a small ship about 200 seconds
away.  At 18:05:10 an automatic ID query is received and acknowledged.
At 18:10 the Alcyon is alongside the "Ramir" a scout with some
Zhodani-like design features.  Lieutenant Alfeche of the Ramir indicates
that refuelling is to commence at 18:30; the tender will auto-uncloak
at 18:20.  

At 18:13 the troop carrier/corvette "Anslinger" uncloaks and approaches.


==========================================================
GM mode on:

I\'m cutting off the turn description here so you guys can do your
engineering and crew transfer things.

Honestly, I\'ll try to get a new list of players/characters/addresses
out real soon now...  (Hopefully tonight).

To all PBEM PLAYERS, old and new:

Metlay here, running Bhyarrvouf. Having Just been named Mission SubCommander
and Executive Officer of the Alcyon in the game (and backup for the beleaguered
Dan Corrin outside of it), it\'s now vital that I have working mail paths to 
each and every one of you. Over the next few days, I will investigate the paths
that bounce when this message is mailed, but I can NOT investigate "black holes
(i.e. failed mail that doesn\'t return a bounce message), so I need all of your
help. Please take 30 seconds to reply to this message, even if you and I have
corresponded many times in the past!

This message will be sent to the Distribution List I currently have, and a copy
will be posted tonight on the TML as well, since that\'s SURE to reach everyone.
IF YOU ONLY RECEIVE THIS MESSAGE ON THE TML, BE SURE TO TELL ME SO!

My apologies in advance to the TMLers who aren\'t playing; this is hopefully
the last message of this sort I\'ll have to post. (Yeah, sure, right. |-< )

metlay

PS. If you have trouble reaching me at metlay@vms.cis.pitt.edu, as some folx
apparently have, I can still receive mail at mpmst1@unix.cis.pitt.edu, my old
address: it\'s automatically forwarded to my VMS account. But if both addresses
work, please use the VMS one. Thanx again!

kid?  KID??  Listen mate, I\'ve only been called kid by one other person
since I turned 30 (which was a WHILE back).  The only reason I didn\'t
climb all over HIM for it was because he\'s furry, has two laser pistols,
bionic hands (er, paws), and barks.  He also happens to be XO of the
starship I\'m currently aboard... for the moment.

I dunno...  Mebbe it\'s the way I write my TML postings.  I mean, I don\'t
use the high, squeaky voice any more.  I just don\'t know....

DISCUSSION

The Derfflinger is the Kiel Sternskiffbau AG competitor for German
Naval Requirement WRFz-302-166. The specification calls for a
superheavy battleship capable of taking on future possible Kafer
battleships. Requirements include Warp 4+ capability and use of
missiles as the ship\'s main offensive weapon. This requirement was
issued in August 2302, and is based on experience gained in the Kafer
war.

The layout of the ship is a cylindrical main core surrounded by 8
external spin habitats, arranged perpendicular to the main axis in a
staggered fashion.

Two linked 300 MW fusion plants supplies power to the experimental 600
MW Hochkessle-Osaka drive, a drive of previously untried dimensions.
The succes of this arrangement is critical to the acceptability of
this design, and will be extensively tested by the German Navy.

The main offensive striking power of this vessel is the 12 remote
pilot stations, coupled with the 12 missile bays. The ship can volley
launch 12 missiles per minute, and carries a total of 72 missiles. In
extreme cases, the 20 submunition dispensers could be substituted for
SR-9, SR-10, Ritage-1 or SIM-14 Standard Missile Packs on a one for
one basis, or Ritage-2 Standard Missile Packs on a one for two basis.
Thus, in a maximum missile configuration the Derfflinger could carry a
total of 312 SR-9 or SR-10 missiles (72 in internal bays and 240 in
external missile packs.) 

The tactical idea behind the Derfflinger is to disable the main enemy
elements with missile attacks, close with the enemy fleet and dispatch
the those still capable of combat with Particle Weapons and Detonation
Laser submunitions. A very high armor value and redundancy in critical
systems heightens the ship\'s survivability. 20 double turrets provide
point defense fire, and 10 heavy laser turrets have a dual capability
of anti-missile and anti-boat fire. 

Of the 22 Fire Control stations, 12 control their fire through the 12
TTAs, and the other 10 controls the UTES mounted on the PBWS jack
turrets. This arrangement couples the all-aspect engagement capability
of the TTAs with the high survivability of the jack turrets.

Critics of this vessel has but a few points on their agenda:

 * The high-cost-low-profile passive sensor system included could
probably be substituted for a cheaper system with similar capability
with little or no detrimental effect, given the high profile already
presented by this class.

 * The omission of hull masking seems to be a glaring mistake. Even if
the reflected signature of the ship is very large, a radiated
signature considerably less would force the enemy to commit their
active sensors at an earlier stage.

 * At least the 20 point defense laser turrets should have been mounted
on pylons for a better field of fire.

 * The high cost of this system have caused opponents to suggest that
the missions intended for this ship could be resolved more efficiently
by 2-3 cruisers of the French Suffren class, or 4-5 cruisers of the
American Kennedy class. Purchase of such ships seems unlikely though,
given the French and American governments unwillingness to sell
cutting-edge technology to Germany.

At the moment, German Naval High Command is wargaming and simulating
this vessel against all known Kafer forces in order to find the
optimum tactics involved in deploying this ship. Currently, the
Derfflinger is to form the core of a Strike Force, including the
Derfflinger, 2-3 Frigates, 2-3 supply vessels and a number of
fighters. The fighters could be carried aboard the supply vessels or
on a small carrier (but Germany has no carrier at this date). The
Derfflinger and the fighters would make a sweep or attack together,
leaving the supply vessels (protected by the frigates) at a safe
range. 


Date of design:	March 12, 2303
Laid down:	August 22, 2303
Delivered:	Juli 31, 2305 (projected)

Another ship of the class is on order, but not yet laid down.

Yes!  Gary Thomas and Joe Fugate of DGP will be our guests of honor.  I
believe that the MT tournament will now be "The Flaming Eye" instead of
"Antares Down"  Gary and Joe will personally run this event.

myself quite a lot. With the total lack of feedback from the mailing
list I assumed no one out there was interested. Unfortunately my company
has decided to send me to Canada for two weeks (right in the middle
of Ireland biggest games convention... which I am running!). If anyone
interested in sysgen4 please mail me in the meantime saying what sort of
machine you wish to run it on.
	For a recap, sysgen4 extends the other sysgens up to World-Builder-
Handbook level. It includes all the nitty gritty details and will map the
surface of the planet down to 7680 hexes around the equator (It gets a bit 
fractal like the closer you get so the practical resolution is several hundred).
There are several support programs for printing the wealth of information
in a variety of ways and includes a timetable generator (for the whole 100
trillion planet galaxy), language tables, and insystem travel times.
	The Devnaree Collective (Cumann Damh na Righ) is producing a series
of "Planetary Packs" containing the information given expanded with textual
background data. We are always looking for people willing to take system
details and add history. In our MegaTraveller range we have two adventures,
a really advanced scout character generation system, and a vehicle
compendium (by our own rsdean). I\'d have to talk with the rest of the colective
about making it available free to TML members electronically but it really
loses a lot without the illustrations.
	Sumbissions always welcome and if we sell enough we\'ll even pay 
you :-).

That (the subject line) was the initial code phrase, by which we were
to recognize Loda Linnaker, the girl we were to rescue from the clutches
of those nasty Vilani.  We never made it :-)  Mark, our glorious engineer
talked the CO into taking the scenic route, and really messing with Joe\'s
well thought-out adventure.  It was really a lot of fun.  Ever been pulled
over by a 30,000 ton traffic cop with a spinal mount?

Let\'s see...
James won a trophy for best Battle Tech player, even though he\'d never played
before.  Mark won best role-player in Ron\'s "Total Recall" adventure, and
I won a whole bunch of Ace-of-Aces campaigns.  

We arrived Friday night and spent until the wee hours at Joe Fugate\'s
house, where he showed us his wall-sized map of the imperium and home
videos of the DGP offices.  

Saturday we failed to make contact with the organizers of the con for
breakfast, and then played until 11:30 pm or so.  Afterwards we went
to a local dive and talked with the organizers, Joe, and Gary, until
about 1:30.

Sunday we dragged ourselves out of bed and woefully made our way back
to Portland.

After about 60 straight hours of persuasive techniques, we\'ve talked
James into joining the PBEM.  Joe asked for an occasional update of
the PBEM; apparantly no one else (other than me) is stupid enough to
try an open-ended campaign with this many people.  DGP has a survey they
want us to get from Genie and provide for you guys (Mark is doing/will
do this), and they both said they are always desparate for material
for "The Journal" (no longer "digest") and "Challenge" (Gary is now
editor of Challenge).

I\'d do it again tomorrow, given half a chance.  :-)

                ROAD-TRIP REPORT FROM GAMEMASTER \'90

Well, as mentioned in last week\'s TML Digest, James Perkins (our beloved
TML moderator), Richard Johnson (our beloved PBEM GM) and I (nobody in
particular) spent a 3-day weekend in Boise, ID ("The Nightlife Mecca of
the Pacific Northwest" :-)) to attend the Gamemaster \'90 gaming convention.
The Con was well-attended.  There ~150 gamers (IMHO) engaged in all matter
of role- and war-gaming (more on this later).  Needless to say, Joe D.
Fugate Sr. and Gary Thomas were the 2 star attractions for all the die-
hard Traveller players in attendance.

We left Portland early Friday morning and (after a monotonous drive across
eastern Oregon with nothing for entertainment but each other) we arrived
in front of Ron Abramson\'s house about 5:15 PM, mountain time.  Ron had
graciously offered to let us stay with him for the weekend (Thanks again,
Ron!), which is a mistake I\'m sure he won\'t make again.  However, since
we told him we wouldn\'t arrive until 6 PM, and since the driveway was
empty when we arrived, we stood around in front of his house for 15 minutes
before he noticed us and came out to invite us in (you see, to Jame, Richard,
and myself, a garage that\'s actually clean enough to hold cars is a sure
sign of a sick mind!).

That evening we when downtown to help the con organizers fold still-wet
convention programs and then Ron took the three of us to our first big
thrill: we went over to Joe Fugate\'s house where we met Joe, his wife
(who\'s name I\'ve forget, embarassingly enough), and Gary Thomas.  We
spend probably two hours talking role-playing non-stop and just generally
"basking in the presence of greatness" (although Joe and Gary will be
the first to tell you that they HATE being celebrities).

The next morning, we were all up at five to meet the rest of the Con
organizers at a local pancake house at 6 AM.  We arrived 15 minutes late,
only to discover that everybody had overlooked one critical factor: the
restaurant WASN\'T OPEN at 6 AM!!  Ron, James, Richard, and I eventually
settled for an Elmer\'s Pancake house, after about 20 minutes of futilely
searching the streets of Boise for signs of a familiar car.

we arrived at the Boise State University Memorial Union (the location of
the Con) about 7:45 AM and at 8 AM the festivities started.  There were
games of BattleTech, CarWars, Champions, World Conquest, Buck Rogers,
Sky Galleons of Mars, Battle for Moscow, Marvel Superheroes, and on,
and on.  The two big ongoing games during the day were multi-session,
multiple elimination games of AD&D ("It\'s alive - Kill it!") and a GURPS
Sci-Fi adaption of the movie "Total Recall" (which was excellently crafted
and GM\'ed by Ron Abramson)  The big finish was a session of the MegaTaveller
adventure "The Flaming Eye" at two tables, referee\'ed by Gary and Joe.
(This was actually additional playtesting for the adventure module, which
should come out late next year, so Richard, James, and I feel especially
privileged to have been included.)  One of the wonderful features of most
of the game sessions was that you needed no prior experience in the game
to play.

Prompted by that fact, the three of us immediately plopped down to play
"BattleTech" (Jame and I had never played it, and Richard had only played
once, a long time ago).  After a frustrating 2 1/2 hours battling crummy
dice-rolls, two teen-age "munchkins", and a squad CO with a distinct lack
of tactical ability, we were finally forced (due to session time limitations)
to abort our mission.  (Richard and I were privately wishing that Peter
Berghold, Rob Dean, and a few of the other TML\'ers with military experience
had been there so we could have REALLY kicked some 30-meter, cybernetic ass!)
The high point of the game was the end, when the GM awarded James the first-
place trophy for "Best Player" (a decision that Richard and I both agree was
the only correct one to make.  I\'ll leave the gory details of that particular
battle to James.  C\'mon James, don\'t be modest!!)

In the next session, James and I proceeded on to the first round of the
GURPS "Total Recall" game.  Richard attended a "How to Get Published"
talk by Gary Thomas, and then proceeded to take command of  a "Heart of
Oak" game (naval battles with square-riggers).  In the GURPS game, James
ran a sexy, young (female) rock star (and outstandingly, too) while I ran
a MAJOR NETWORK REPORTER (my karma, I guess :-)).  These characters were
pre-generated for the game, but that didn\'t lessen the enjoyment at all.
After 2 full, gruelling sessions (with a quick dash out to a MacDonalds,
in between) we got stomped by the bad guys.  Our only con- solation was
that the other table (did I mention there were two tables running this
adventure?) didn\'t get much further.  The real shock at the end was when
I got handed the 1st place award for Best role-playing!  You had to have
been there to see the field of talent we were up against.  I have NEVER
been in the company of that many outstanding RPG\'ers at once in my life.

The 8 PM (and final) session rolled around, and we settled into the
ultimate reason for our road-trip in the first place, the chance to
play MegaTraveller with two of the guys responsible for making it what
it is today.  James played with a group at Gary\'s table, while Richard
and I (along with 3 other really good players) sat at Joe\'s table.
Both MT tables were deliberately moved as far away as possible from
the "Clay-o-Rama" table, since we couldn\'t hear ourselves think (let
alone, talk) anywhere near them.  Our (economic) mission for that
evening was to rescue a scientist, and her proto-type invention, from
deep inside Vilani space.  Our table didn\'t get nearly as far along
as Gary\'s table, but the role-playing and characterizations were
unbelievable!!  Joe is the kind of GM that you hope you get in role-
playing heaven when you die.11 PM arrived much too soon (sigh).  

After the Con ended, we joined Gary, Joe, and the rest of the Con
organizers for a TGIO (Thank God It\'s Over!) get-together at Denny\'s,
which went on until 2 AM.  As tired as we were, all the gaming just
didn\'t seem to last long enough.

Well, in a nutshell, we had a ball!!  We\'re definitely going back again
next year.  ...And I\'m sure that James and Richard will have plenty more
to tell about the parts that I\'ve left out.

Later,

         and tell the Captain it\'s time for his next shot."

Draft Imperial 20000ton Light Cruiser TL15

     This draft design was produced on 19 October 1990.  Endurance given 
below is for no combat use of power.  Combat power consumes 2 days of non-
combat power per day. Cost of subcraft is included in the total design 
cost.  (4 Lance fighters, 6 Type 1112 landing boats) Probably not really 
intended for independent operations, but does have limited capability for 
planetary intervention with approximately one company of marines carried.

     The MicroFighter is designed to fit the standard starship four ton 
vehicle bay, and to provide its parent vessel with a limited additional space 
combat capability.  Originally developed to a scout service experimental 
specification, the MicroFighter has since been licensed for non-government 
procurement.  Pilots frequently complain about the cramped extended duration 
accomodations, and some of the extending equipment is typically removed to 
provide a roomy seat for shorter patrols.

Chameleon Grav Tank TL10

     The Chameleon is an unusual grav tank design, based on a customer 
requirement for low observability.  To reduce the vehicle signature power is 
provided by an MHD turbine rather than a more typical fusion plant, and the 
main armamament is a hull mounted 20cm mass driver gun. No active sensors, 
and no broadcast communications are installed.

     The Dependable is sold as an all-purpose grav vehicle capable of making 
a planetary landing from orbit.  It is sized to fit the standard 4 ton

on unimproved worlds.  The only problem in this application is the lack of

Tiremese Mule TL11

     The Mule is a common vehicle on Tirem, a high population planet with a 
corrosive atmosphere.  The heavy armor is necessary for the vehicle to resist 
the long term, effects of atmospheric exposure, and the rather expensive 
extended life support capability is mandated by most local governments on the 
planet, to ensure that passengers will be safe if an emergency vehicle is 
delayed in responding to a breakdown. Power plant duration includes the need 
to supply oxygen as well as hydrogen to the fuel cells.

Swift Light Air Raft TL13

     The Swift is a low cost grav vehicle intended for the general market.  
Most of its popularity stems from the fully enclosed, streamlined design, 
enabling comparatively high speed travel.

Small Bulk Freighter TL15

     This small bulk freighter is a fairly standard TL15 design, and can be 
found in fairly large numbers anywhere there is bulk cargo traffic to 
justify their presence.  The weapons suite consumes approximately the same 
amount of power used for the grav plates and inertial compensators, which 
are powered down for combat.  The shuttle provides a certain amount of 
cargo transfer capacity at unimproved or high grav starports where the ship 
would not be able to land.

First; thanks to Robert Dean and the fact that my site supports anon FTP,
we now have free access to a (I think) complete set of the vehicles.
FTP to ocf.berkeley.edu (128.32.184.254) login:anonymous password:your name

the files are in pub/Traveller

Second; Good News! One of my continuing projects was a set of rules for
a legal system for MegaTraveller, and Challenge just accepted it!  8-)
It only took managing editor Michelle Sturgeon four working days to send
the acceptance letter back, too.  8-)  [ <= happy george 8-) ]  I don\'t yet
know _when_ it will show up, but it will.  (alas, as it\'s going to be published,
I can\'t tell ya what\'s in it, but hope you enjoy when you see it....)

From: Richard Johnson <richard@agora.UUCP>
Subject: (1633) "All Vargr who have grey fur are unintelligent..."

Prompted  by that fact, the three of us immediately plopped  down 
to play "BattleTech" (Jame and I had never played it, and Richard 
had  only played once, a long time ago).  After a  frustrating  2 
1/2  hours battling crummy dice-rolls, two teen-age  "munchkins", 
and a squad CO with a distinct lack of tactical ability, we  were 
finally  forced  (due to session time limitations) to  abort  our 
mission.  (Richard and I were privately wishing that Peter  Berg-
hold,  Rob  Dean, and a few of the other  TML\'ers  with  military 
experience had been there so we could have REALLY kicked some 30-
meter,  cybernetic ass!) The high point of the game was the  end, 
when the GM awarded James the first-place trophy for "Best  Play-
er"  (a decision that Richard and I both agree was the only  cor-
rect one to make.  I\'ll leave the gory details of that particular 
battle to James.  C\'mon James, don\'t be modest!!)
****************************************************************

Thanks for the vote of confidence, but I hate to tell you that my 
military experience consists of twenty years of being a  military 
buff, eighteen years of being a wargamer, and nine years of being 
an  Amry civilian engineer who never even gets to touch  anything 
vaguely resembling a weapon.  All theoretical, you know...

Okay, okay, Mark.  I\'ll send in my trip report. :-)

Friday went pretty much as Richard and Mark described.  One thing I can
mention is, if you ever send art to GDW, make sure you either send along
a frame and matting, or a return envelope :-).

One thing the Con reminded me about gamers (since I\'ve been away from
playing games for about 6 years) is that gamers get really carried away.
And when they get carried away, they sometimes get rather loud...  Not
only was Clay-O-Rama loud ("The Flaming Eye" was interrupted by a loud
20-player cheer of "STOMP! STOMP! STOMP! STOMP! STOMP!" from the
Clay-O-Rama table), but at one point in the day a handsome fellow at one
of the AD&D tables, who had a penchant for standing as he played,
brought me straight out of intense character playing for "Total Recall"
at the table next door, with a ear-splitting primal scream.  Apparently
it affected everyone else in the room similarly, because the room
instantly became dead silent, and 300 eyes were focused unflinchingly on
the young fellow at the end of the room.  A second or two later people
recovered their composure and gave him scattered applause and cheers, he
gave the rest of the room a deep bow, and all went back to playing their
games.

Mark, you wanted me to post the gory details of the BattleTech campaign.
Everyone YAWN now before you read further.  :-) The ref (a young fellow
with dark hair, wry grin, and the name "SHAD" written on his forehead in
green soluble marker) threw down about 10 \'mech sheets in front of us.

I picked a moderate \'mech called a "Dragon", which weighs in at about 60
tons and is armed with Long Range Missles, an Autocannon/5 and an arm-
and back-mounted Medium Laser.  While my compatriots all party down the
middle of the hex map with heavier \'mechs, I decide to rapidly skirt
down the right side; that way, my right side is safe from attack.
Suddenly, I discover another mech left and above me on the hillside! He
wounds me and I return fire, wounding him.  He jumps down off the hill
next to me and fires some more (A light \'mech - a Wasp, I see!).  And
then a Locust comes by (another light \'mech).  I shoot the Wasp --
ineffective.  The Wasp misses and the Locust hits.  I kick the Wasp, and
the locust takes off to fry other fish.  The Wasp keels over.  I start
to repeatedly kick the Wasp while he fires back at me.  Eventually the
Wasp becomes an inert, twisted pile of metal, and I resume sidling down
the side of the map to fire LRM\'s at a new opponent.

Meanwhile, across the map, Richard is facing repeated "death from above"
from a Commando - a kamikaze jump-on-opponent type of attack.  Between
damage taken by consistently missing Richard, and fire vectored in from
all the other player mechs, he finally finishes himself off in his final
leap, and crashes into a riddled heap at Richard\'s side.  On the other
side of the table, no matter how hard he tries, Mark can\'t hit anyone,
despite trying to come over and rescue my \'mech, and he is being ignored
by the enemy.  Worse than that, his dice fail to cooperate.

At the end, they awarded me the "Best Player" trophy, which I humbly
accepted.  I feel I earned it through a combination of luck, asking lots
of questions of a Battletech expert that was co-GMing, and a small
amount of previous tactical wargaming experience.

Richard hasn\'t shared anything he learned in the "How to get Published"
seminar.  Come on, Richard, let\'s share some of this with the group.

You should\'ve seen how hard Mark role-played in the "Total Recall"
campaign, faced with his character\'s wife, he is forced to basically
struggle within himself and with her over the topic that she is a
dangerous liar.  I *know* I couldn\'t have maintained character at that
point.  Maybe the fact that the character wife, Lori, has the same name
as Mark\'s real wife, helped him keep character focus.

The other real gem of the Total Recall game was the young fellow playing
the rich-bitch character of Leona Trump.  Dependent upon her hubby,
Larry, but amazingly resourceful with the pistols made from the company
she owns, she was played wonderfully and was very believable (and
annoying at times).  Ron\'s quick-thinking improvisation of a prop was
another good story.  Leona calls up Larry on the video, and guess who
appears on the screen but the image of Arnold Shwarzenegger.  Ron holds
the picture in front of his face, looking at Leona\'s player, and says
(in a deep, legato Arnold accent), "Leona honey, what\'s wrong?!".  The
table erupts in raucous laughter.  Ron was able to milk laughs out of
that prop and accent all afternoon.

The Flaming Eye adventure was a lot like Eastern Pennsylvania to me.
That is, I think that Eastern Pennsylvania must look very pretty when
you aren\'t looking at it through smog from an expressway.  I was sitting
at Gary\'s table, while Richard and Mark were at Joe\'s table -- I had
thought it might be fun to get a little different slant on it than Mark,
since Mark and I had shared the previous three sessions.  Guess I
should\'ve stayed with the more experienced gamers.  I picked a Scout
that was a highly experienced engineer, who chose to run light and not
be the party leader.  Unfortunately, I resorted to poking ideas at the
leader on several occasions, and acted as treasurer despite the fact
that duty ought to fall on the captain.  My attempts at characterization
were encouraged by Gary, but the other players did not seem interested
in characterization, and seemed more interested in exercising their
skill DM\'s, having their very own starship, and provoking Vilani police
with automatic weapons rather than having more subtle fun.  I got the
impression that Gary was moving quickly through the adventure to get it
over with, more because of the other players, as well as the distracting
noises and short playtime.

When I really came to understand characterization and ROLE playing in
games, some years back, it was like a light went on in my head and I
could see wonderful possibilities.  I guess the other players at my
table are lucky that they had not had that freeing experience.  :-) I
hope that some day I can play with Gary when he is free to concentrate
on his refereeing or play - he is quite talented, clever, and very good
at making characters come alive - when there are fewer distractions,
more time, and the more appreciative players.

It was really wonderful to be "on the inside" of the convention -
especially wonderful in our case because we didn\'t do any of the work on
it.  :-) The opportunities to meet and talk to Ron, Gary, Joe, Patricia,
Joe Jr., Ken, Dave, and all the others I haven\'t mentioned was terrific.
They were all excellent hosts.  I think Joe and Gary appreciated us for
having serious Traveller GM\'s to bounce ideas off of, and we enjoyed
bouncing our own ideas off them.  I appreciated their candor and
friendliness.

I\'d like to thank Mark again for providing transportation, and Richard
for the breakfast he treated us to.  I also enjoyed the chance I had to
get to know Richard and Mark better (what else is there to do but talk
when on the road 16 hours round trip:-) )? I had such a great time that
if anyone is stupid enough to invite me, I\'ll do it again next year.

Grav Bike TL13

     The grav bike is a popular recreational and very light transport vehicle 
at appropriate tech levels.  This example includes a fairing to reduce the 
wind resistance of the rider, and a fair amount of enclosed cargo space 
(enough for a couple of suitcases.)

  CraftID: Grav Bike, TL13, Cr2940

NOTE:  After doing this one I noticed that the smallest standard grav unit you
are allowed to build has a one ton thrusts, making this an illegal design. 
However, as it is two tech levels above the introduction of grav units, perhaps
they have discovered how to miniaturize them a bit.

Bumblebee Light Air Raft TL11

     The Bumblebee is a light air raft intended for use on planets where 
hydrocarbon fuels are inexpensive and readily obtainable.  In such situations 
the turbine engine is more cost effective than either fusion power or fuel 
cells.  There are no significant differences between the TL11 version shown 
here, and the TL10 version.

     The Brumby is a high speed grav vehicle built to IISS specifications, 
and frequently used as an auxiliary vessel aboard lower TL Type S scouts.

Type S Scout/Courier TL11

     The TL11 Scout Courier is the first to mount thrusters for deep space 
propulsion, and has a sensor package that includes a neutrino sensor and a 
densitometer.  A full envrionmental suite is carried, but as with any Type S, 
true comfort is difficult to obtain in such a cramped situation.  The cost 
given below does not include an auxiliary vehicle, but provision for carrying 
soemthing in the 4 ton class is made (typically a Brumby or other similarly 
sized air raft.)  An onboard fuel purifier gives the vessel the capability 
for extended wilderness missions.

if you can\'t get through for some reason, to the TML moderator
(jamesp@metolius.wr.tek.com) before November 20th.  This will allow
us to bundle and forward all the returned surveys to the good people
at DGP before the entry deadline of November 30th.  After the deadline,
one lucky survey returnee will be drawn at random to receive $100.00
in credit towards current and/or future DGP products.

The E-mailing instructions given below are for subscribers on GEnie, so
you can disregard them, although the U.S. Mail address IS valid.  If
you want to mail a hard copy of your survey directly to DGP instead
of returning it to us, that\'s find too.  The address is listed below.

Help Joe and Gary find out what a large group of rabid travellers really
want in an RPG.  This way, we all win!!

that sort of thing!"), I\'m living proof that sometimes you CAN get lucky.
Last year, I sent in one of the surveys from an issue of Travellers
Digest, and promptly won a free subscription!  Not bad, huh?

13. Below are some unorthodox ideas for how to do a roleplaying game.
    Indicate what you think of each idea.

    ----
    Game does not use dice
    (Methods other than random generators put in the element of
    uncertainty)

    What do you think of this idea?
    __ It\'s stupid
    __ Bit strange
    __ Just different
    __ Interesting
    __ Pretty clever

    Would this one factor keep you from buying the game?
    __ No, it would make me want the game more!
    __ Don\'t care, if the rest of the game is good.
    __ Uncertain. I might not want a game like this.
    __ Probably would. This seems too different for my taste.
    __ Yes, I would put the game down and look for something else.

    ----
    Game uses mostly guidelines rather than rules
    (Unless the rule can be expressed with a mathematical formula, the
    game presents a guideline/rule-of-thumb instead)

    What do you think of this idea?
    __ It\'s stupid
    __ Bit strange
    __ Just different
    __ Interesting
    __ Pretty clever

    Would this one factor keep you from buying the game?
    __ No, it would make me want the game more!
    __ Don\'t care, if the rest of the game is good.
    __ Uncertain. I might not want a game like this.
    __ Probably would. This seems too different for my taste.
    __ Yes, I would put the game down and look for something else.

    ----
    Game does not use a game master/referee
    (Methods are provided whereby the players can self-administer an
    adventure)

    What do you think of this idea?
    __ It\'s stupid
    __ Bit strange
    __ Just different
    __ Interesting
    __ Pretty clever

    __ Uncertain. I might not want a game like this.
    __ Probably would. This seems too different for my taste.
    __ Yes, I would put the game down and look for something else.

    ----
    Game has no rulebook
    (Each adventure/weapon/device has its own set of mini-rules)

    What do you think of this idea?
    __ It\'s stupid
    __ Bit strange
    __ Just different
    __ Interesting
    __ Pretty clever

    Would this one factor keep you from buying the game?
    __ No, it would make me want the game more!

    __ Probably would. This seems too different for my taste.
    __ Yes, I would put the game down and look for something else.

    ----
    Game illustrates each and every setting/event/creature/weapon/device
    (25-50% of the content would be pictures instead of text. In your
    rating, also realize you would pay significantly more if the game had 
    this high of an illustration ratio)

    What do you think of this idea?
    __ It\'s stupid
    __ Bit strange
    __ Just different
    __ Interesting
    __ Pretty clever

    Would this one factor keep you from buying the game?

    __ Probably would. This seems too different for my taste.
    __ Yes, I would put the game down and look for something else.

    ----
    Game based on a 3-hole binder presentation
    (Basic set comes with a binder, all supplements come as
    a shrink-wrapped pack of three-hole punched lose pages)


    What do you think of this idea?
    __ It\'s stupid
    __ Bit strange
    __ Just different
    __ Interesting
    __ Pretty clever

    Would this one factor keep you from buying the game?

Congratulations to  (uh oh - I forgot your name) for getting the
justice rules into Challenge.  GDW pays more than DGP.

I said earlier we saw videos of the DGP offices - that was supposed
to be the GDW offices.  Monday morning lethargy.

I WILL talk about getting published.  Just give me a couple of days
to get caught up on the PBEM.  All the players decides to PLAY while
we were gone :-).  I;ve just completed the latest version of the
lsit of addresses, and the team asignments.  I sent it to Mark, Mike,
Dan, and a couple of other notable people, so we wouldn\'t clutter the
list.  Write to one of us to get a copy.  (You really should get the
updated version, many addresses have changed.)

Actually, James won the Battle Tech game because he was the ONLY
gamer to actually kill an opponent.  Mark and I spent most of our
time wounding and crippling, then mvoing on to more hostile targets.
and "Shad" had a penchant for mech suicide.

Role playing is much more fun.  Albeit a lot harder to rate in
a tournament situation.

  {
    'body' => 'Here it is, probably not as promised.  Advice on how
to get published.

1.  Carry a little book around with you ALL THE TIME.
    Put every fleeting, seemingly interesting, idea in it to use later.

2.  Write for and get the "Writer\'s Guidelines" and "Schedule"
    for the magazine (presumably either Challenge or Journal).

3.  Pick one of your ideas and write about it.  Get someone to 
    proofread it, even if they don\'t actually review/edit it.

    There is a difference.  Proofing is mainly checking spelling
    and grammar (what I\'m not so hot at), and editing deals more
    with getting ideas organized and well-presented.  On a request
    only basis, I am volunteering to help with the latter.  I do
    that sort of thing for a living, and it doesn\'t really take me
    long.  It\'s free if it\'s on-line :-).

4.  Send a cover letter/proposal (really an ad) to the magazine
    of your choice.  Explain what you want to do, why it works 
    well in their magazine, how it fits their schedule, and how
    long it is.  It\'s OK to guess on some of this stuff, after
    all, this is only a proposal.

5.  They will probably turn you down.  Try again with another idea,
    and maybe the old idea at a different magazine.  NEVER send 
    the same stuff to two different mags at the same time! (I tell
    you three times!!!)  ALWAYS keep trying.  Eventually you\'ll
    either crack the editor that doesn\'t like your stuff, or you\'ll
    get good enough, or (s)he\'ll tell you how to fix it.

6.  They finally accept an article.  Make sure you keep the editor
    informed of your progress.  Absolutely make sure the mag knows
    well in advance if you\'ll be late -- even one day late.  If you
    screw up on this or the multiple mags bit, you\'re out of the
    business for a long, long time.

7.  Your article will probably need illustrations, drawings, or maps.
    Both the Journal and Challenge have staff artists.  According to
    Gary and Joe, the artists at GDW really want some control over
    the art.  DGP is not quite so bad.  Create some sketches that
    show and tell what you need, but don\'t waste any time on them
    (unless you are an artist).  If you want to sell visual art, all
    the same rules apply, only you usually get paid less, have less
    time to do things, and less control over what gets done.

8.  Continue doing articles for the magazines.  After you have done
    many, and are consistent, you can contact them for ideas about
    adventures, modules, and possibly even game components.  Every
    gaming magazine relies on a very small handful of consistent
    producers.  The people who get the juicy assignments are the
    ones who already have a track record.  Unless you\'re Steven
    King, don\'t try to sell them the big stuff until they know you
    well.

Sourcebook, I wondered if they couldn\'t be improved upon a bit. The first
40 ton craft took about 20 minutes to do, and each of the succeeding ones took
less than 10 minutes (on paper) with most of the data needed already looked up

Sword Worlds Majestic Class Heavy Cruiser TL11

     The Majestic class heavy cruiser is a standard Sword Worlds design, 
although very similar vessels can be found serving in Imperial and Vargr 
navies of equal tech level.  Equipped with a fuel purifier, a squadron of up 
to 30 forty ton landers or fighters, and a company of marines, the Majestic 
is capable of independent operations, and is frequently found as a flagship 
for a squadron of smaller craft.  Normal operating power is approximately 50% 
of the full power capacity, and the endurance given below is for non-combat 
operations.  Each hour at combat power uses fuel for two hours at non-combat 
power. Cost of auxiliary craft is not included below.

Sword Worlds Nymph class Fighter TL11

     The Nymph is a long endurance fighter in common Sword World service.  
Notable for its design which sacrifices agility in favor of a main battery of 
2 beam lasers, it also features an armored hull, giving some protection 
against the secondary batteries of larger vessels.

Sword Worlds Sprite class Lander TL11

     The Sprite is a derivative of the Nymph fighter class.  It is intended 
to carry a full squad of infantry and their carrier vehicle, plus a reasona
ble amount of additional cargo, to a planetary surface as rapidly as possi
ble.  Given these operating parameters, there was no need to provide exces
sive fuel tankage, or extended accommodations for the crew.  However, extend
ed life support in installed in case other operations are required.  Addi
tional fuel tankage could easily be installed in the cargo bay to extend 
duration, and modular habitat units could be carried.

Sword Worlds Ariel class Pinnace TL11

     The Ariel is a derivative of the Nymph fighter class.  It is intended to 
provide a reasonable landing and independent operation capability for larger 
craft.  Only one crew memeber is actually required to operate the vessel, but 
six small staterooms provide long term accomodations for up to 5 passengers.  
More can easily be carried for short trips.

Diesel Locomotive TL6

     The diesel locomotive can be found pulling trains on many low tech 
worlds in the Imperium.  Due to the extremely high ground pressure, this 
vehicle can only operate on a prepared route of steel rails.  P/W and result
ing speed must be recalculated for each train, but as an example, the locomo
tive below can pull 15 fully loaded frieght cars at a speed of 55kph, or a 
passenger train consisting of a combine, a diner car, ten coaches and four 
sleepers at a speed of 130 kph.  Locomotives can be hooked in multiple units 
to haul longer trains.

Freight Car TL6

     Given below is a typical freight car, the Traveller vehicle design 
system not being sensitive enought to distinguish between box cars, tank 
cars, stock cars, gondola, hoppers and flat cars.  In its variant forms it is 
suitable for transport of packaged goods, livestock, containerized cargo, 
bulk liquids or bulk solids.  Freight trains transport more cargo tonnage by 
land than any other form of transport at TL7 and below.

Passenger Coach TL6

     On worlds where individual tranposrtation is not practical or cost 
effective, railroads carry substantial numbers of passengers in coaches such 
as this.

  CraftID: Passenger Coach, TL6, Cr35,193
     Hull: 16/39, Disp=17, Conf=4USL, Armor=4B, Loaded=17.1t,

           locomotive)
    Other: Cargo=0, ObjSize=Avg, EmLevel=None

Passenger Sleeper TL6

     On trips lasting two or more days by rail, use of a sleeper car is more 
comfortable for the passenger than attempting to ride in a coach for the 
entire journey.  Due to the lower number of passengers that can be carried, 
and the higher cost of the car, it can be expected that a sleeper ticket will 
be many times as expensive as a coach ticket for the same trip.

  CraftID: Passenger Sleeper, TL6, Cr109,603

Passenger Combine TL6

     The combine (combined passenger and baggage car) provides a convenient 
place for travellers to deposit their bags while travelling by train. Since 
few passengers carry more than a suitcase or two, one combine sohould be able 
to service several coaches.

Passenger Diner TL6

     The diner car provides an opportunity for passengers to eat while trav
elling.  Seating 40 people, it is usually quite busy on a train that may have 
300 to 400 passengers.  Meals are not usually included in the price of a 
normal ticket.

Curricle TL4

     Okay. So I did this one as a joke.  If you really wanted to do a horse 
drawn vehicle, the proper thing to do (in a Traveller sense) would be to haul 
out the horse drawn vehicle rules from volume 2 of Striker.
     Two rules expansions are needed for this...

     First, I added a new armor material:

Wood  TL1  W  WeightModifer=x5 PriceModifier=x0.5

     Second, You need a couple of extra entries on the P/W table for rating 
speed:

P/W 1 = 5kph
P/W 2 = 10kph

     The curricle is an open topped vehicle suitable for sport and light 
transport use.  Motive power is provided by a team of two horses (cost in
cluded below, Cr300 each).

Type S Scout/Courier TL10

     This version of the Type S is the first to mount a full environmental 
suite.  The maneuver drive is still standard grav, which means that perform
ance falls off to 1G thrusts beyond deep gravity wells.  A Traveller air raft 
(from 101 Vehicles) is provided as an auxiliary (and the cost is included 
below), but other four displacement ton vehicles could be substituted. A fuel 
purifier is included, and fuel tankage is sufficient for two jumps.

           ObjSize=Avg, EmLevel=Faint

Type S Scout/Courier TL9

     This is the earliest version of the venerable Type S design. The maneu
ver drive is standard grav, which means that performance falls off to 1G 
thrust beyond deep gravity wells.  No grav plates or inertial compensators 
are available at TL9, making this vessel uncomfortable for the crew. A bay 
for a four displacement ton vehicle is provided, but no vehicle is included 
in the cost below. A fuel purifier is included, and fuel tankage is suffi
cient for two jumps.

Leviathan class Merchant Cruiser TL15

<Adapted from Traveller Adventure#4>
<To adapt to MegaTraveller it was necessary to reduce the cargo capacity and 
the toal number of staterooms--fuel took up more space than it used to.Back-
up jump and maneuver systems were retained from the original design, despite 
being a questionable design feature in my opinion.  Since the Leviathans were 
built at Glisten, I also opted to make them TL15 rather than 13 as stated in 
the adventure.  Crew requirements under the new system were lower, so reduc
ing staterooms was not a problem.  Additional cargo space could be obtained 
by running with the shuttle and pinnace holds full.>

<Blurb from Adventure#4>

     Desgined jointly by Blistein Yards of Glisten and the Baracccai technum, 
the Leviathan was developed from previous designs and is primarily intended 
for cruising in undeveloped trade areas; hihg survivability is also a design 
factor.  The vessel is semi-streamlined, allowing gas giant refueling, as 
well as landing on atmosphere 0 or 1 worlds.  Other atmospheric operations 
are not possible, hence the large complement of ship\'s boats.  Bilstein made 
the design available for general sale in 1087, and nineteen vessels had been 
ordered by 1106.

it if those of you involved in active Traveller campaigns, as players, or as
GMs could take a minute to send me an answer to this one question survey.  If 
you know that other members of your local group are online, one answer per
group would be nice, but I\'d rather have two than none.

I expect that most campaigns are centered around a single ship.  The question
is is that ship:

    1. A Type S Scout
    2. A Type J Seeker
    3. A Type A Free Trader
    4. A Type A2 Far Trader
    5. A Type R Subsidized Merchant
    6. A Yacht, Lab Ship, Corsair, or Safari Ship (please specify)
    7. Some other ship entirely (please describe briefly)
    8. Not Applicable-Campaign does not center around ships
    9. Not applicable-Campaign involves shipping line with
        multiple ships/types

The PBEM game need not apply...I think I already have a good handle on that.
(By way of example, my own only ongoing game revolves around a pair of 
characters pretty much permanently resident on a Type S Scout...by revolves
around, I mean that they don\'t ever buy passages on board commercial liners
although they may leave the ship in port for some adventures.)

Probably best if the answers are sent to me privately, as I doubt the details
would interest the list as a whole.

Many Thanks,

whiled away in 1976 and 1977 playing the asteroid mining scenario of the
first edition of GDW\'s Triplanetary.  I always had a particular fondness for
those incredibly useful little 2-10 cargo carriers.

Now, down to business.  As noted in the fluff for the Packet design, there is
no way that this thing can pay for itself under the current rules.  However,
has anybody given any serious thought to the fact that the current game freight
and passenger rates are an artifact of Imperial regulation?  It seems to me
that in the unsettled conditions prevailing in the Shattered Imperium, those
rates are going to have to cut loose and follow the rules of supply and 
demand.  Of course, as governments always do so, there will be ships impressed
and otherwise forced to carry on uneconomically, but the general tendency will
be for haulage prices to rise.  Speculative goods prices should rise, too, 
particularly on marginal worlds where it could be assumed that there is a
greater dependence on imports to keep the vital machinery running.  The other
thing certain to rise, and I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen a treatement of it in
the game, is insurance rates.  I suspect this may have something to do with the
fact that most campaigns are run around a single ship, which would pretty much
destroy the campaign if lost, without regard to insurance.

Any comments?

   Packet TL13
   
     This armed merchant vessel is produced by LSP of Lunion, and is increas-
 ing in popularity due to the current troubles afflicting the Imperium.  Since 
 a quick economic analysis of the cargo/passenger capacity and the routine 
 monthly payments of a standard starship mortgage shows that there is no way 
 for this vessel to pay for itself, most of the examples presently flying are 
 under government subsidies.  Governemnts with off-world interests, or that 
 frequently transport valuable cargos, find that armed vessels can get through 
 situations which would result in the loss of less capable merchants.  A pri-
 vately owned packet would find it necessary to constantly engage in profita-
 ble speculative trade to make ends meet, and there would be every temptation 
 to resort to smuggling or outright piracy.  With armament equivalent to many 
 military vessels of similar size, the transition from fighting pirates to 
 piracy is an easy one.

Let\'s approach this list in 3 parts: High Tech Weapons (firearms), Primitive
Weapons, and unarmed combat (Brawling).


I. HIGH TECH WEAPONS

This catagory includes all gunpowder, gauss, laser, and energy weapons, and
consists of the following skills:

_________________________|__________________________|_________________________

As a subset of table 1, table 2 omits the skill \'Gun Combat\' since it cascades
to other explicit skills already listed.  Now, let\'s look at some of the
deficiencies of these skills breakdowns (IMHO :-)).

a) The \'Combat Rifleman\' skill includes {ACR, Assault Rifle, Carbine, Gauss
   Rifle, Rifle}, while the \'Rifleman\' skill includes {Autorifle, Carbine,
   Rifle}.  This makes no sense, since the assault rifle is defined (in the
   Imp. Enc.) as "a lighter and less-expensive military version of the auto-
   matic rifle".  If the Autorifle is a better built version of an assault
   rifle, why would a \'civilian\' rifleman be trained to use it when a soldier
   isn\'t?  My reaction is \'add Autorifle to the Combat Rifleman skill and make
   it a pure superset of the Rifleman skill\'.

b) Based on their definitions, a number of weapons are sufficiently similiar
   that they should probably not be treated as individual weapon skills.
   The ACR, Assault Rifle, and Autorifle should be lumped into a single
   \'Automatic Combat Weapon\' skill.  Similiarly, Carbine and Rifle should
   be collectively treated as a \'Semi-auto Rifle\' skill.  Also, Body Pistol,
   Pistol, Revolver, and Snub Pistol skills should be eliminated and the
   broader \'Handgun\' skill (which includes all these types) should be all
   that\'s neccessary.

Given these consolidations, we can reduce all the original mess to just 4
skills neccessary to provide the same capabilities within the game, but in
a more realistic fashion.  I propose that the skills should be:
  - Rifleman: Includes Carbine and Rifle.
  - Combat Rifleman: Includes ACR, Assault Rifle, Autorifle, Carbine, Rifle,
        and Gauss Rifle (more on gauss weapons later).
  - Handgun: Includes Body Pistol, Revolver, Pistol, and Snub Pistol.
  - Combat Handgun: Identical to Handgun, but includes Gauss Pistol.

Now, I know what you\'re asking yourself.  You\'re asking yourself "Did
he fire six shots, or only five?" [Oops!  Sorry.  Wrong movie.]  You\'re
saying,"Wait a minute.  Where does he get off, lumping gauss weapons into
this mess?"  Well, again IMHO, you can treat a gauss rifle as just another
extremely small caliber automatic rifle.  I\'d be willing to wager that the
handling characteristics of a gauss rifle wouldn\'t differ much from, say, a
full-auto .17 caliber assault rifle (recoil, weight, etc.)  Hence, it\'s
inclusion.  Besides, the current MT skills already include the gauss
rifle in Combat Rifleman, anyway (although, maybe not for the right
reasons :-)).  As for the gauss pistol, well, the existing \'Pistol\'
skill would conceivably allow a PC familiarity with an H&K VP70M or
VP70Z, which are existing 9mm pistols with full-auto burst capabilites.
So why not just throw in the gauss pistol?  The difference just isn\'t
significant enough to require a separate skill.

OK, now that I\'ve insisted that gauss rifle and pistol be included with
the other slug-throwers, I\'m going to reverse my position, slightly.
These two weapons (which should really be combined into a single skill,
let\'s call it Guass Weapon) generate so little recoil, that they
feel very different from large caliber slug-throwers, when fired.  Now,
firing a high recoil weapon should provide you with a reasonable amount
of familiarity with low recoil weapons, but the reverse in not true.
A person who\'s only rifle experience is with a .22 caliber rifle is in
for a serious shock the first time they fire a .30-06.  By this token,
a person who\'s only projectile weapon experience is with a gauss weapon
is not going to be skilled at using heavier recoil weapons like an
assault rifle or an ACR.  For this reason alone, I think that gauss
weapons should still be a separately available skill.

Next, let\'s discuss small energy weapons.  Lasers and neural weapons
fall into this catagory.  These are zero-recoil weapons (how much does
your flashlight kick :-)).  Some assumptions have to be made about
neural weapons, since there are no entries about them in the Player\'s
Manual.  Since it\'s an energy weapon, we can probably assume no recoil,
like lasers.  However, unlike lasers, it probably has no visible beam.
The following sentence (from the Imperial Encyclopedia, pg. 73)...

    "Neural weapon fire can be detected at a distance by individuals
     with psionic life sense ability."

 ... suggests that neural weapon fire is invisible to non-psionics.
This means that aiming a neural weapon is probably done in a different
fashion than aiming a laser.  This fact alone is sufficient to maintain
lasers and neural weapons as separate skills.

However, while lasers and neural weapons are different skills, the
rifle and pistol versions of each can probably be combined into simply
Laser Weapon and Neural Weapon skills.  The primary reason for different-
iating pistol and rifle fire for slug-throwers is the effect the recoil
has on the weapons and the differences in bracing them.  Since lasers
and neural weapons have no recoil, it\'s probably safe to assume that
skills in the rifle and pistol forms of each are similar enough to be
treated as a single skill.

The Light Assault Gun should remain a separate skill.  In current TL
terms, you can probably think of it as a .50 caliber sniper rifle (those
of you who\'ve seen the movie "Navy Seals" know what I\'m talking about).
The same unique-ness applies to the submachinegun.  It should also remain
a separate skill.

And what about the Plasma and Fusion Guns?  Should they be combined into
a single weapon skill?  Who knows?  We\'ll save that topic for another
time.

The Machine Gun and VRF Gauss Gun are both crew-served weapons.  Definitely
separate skills.

OK, rolling all of this back into a table, we now have a much smaller
skill set, which still provides adequate diversity at a much more realistic
level

_________________________|__________________________|_________________________

I have deliberately left Early Firearms out of this discussion, since, in
all fairness, it should actually be multiple catagories (percussion firearms
differ sufficiently from flintlock and wheellock firearms, from a reloading
standpoint, to make them separate skills).  Again, let\'s save this topic
for another time.


II. PRIMITIVE WEAPONS
                                 Table 4

__________________________|__________________________|_________________________

As a subset of table 1, table 4 omits the skills \'Archaic Weapons\' and
\'Blade Combat\' since they cascade to other explicit skills already listed.

There aren\'t nearly as many surprises here as there were in the HIGH TECH
weapons list.  Primitive weapons tend to require skills radically different
enough that they are not easily transferrable.  Samples of the fighting
styles used in the Coliseum in Rome tend to bear this out.  However, some
of the weapons are similar enough that, in a number of cases, a "serves
as weapon [mumble] -1" is probably advised.  Groups for this type of treatment
are as follows: Polearms, Large Blades, and Small Blades.  Each of these
is an \'includes\' skill.  Due to the similarity of the individual weapon
types grouped in these skills, if a PC has proficiency in one of the
weapons in a given group, then that PC should be able to use any other
weapon in the same group at a \'-1\' skill level.  For example, if Bob the
Barbarian has Broadsword-3 skill, but no formal skill in cutlass, he
would be able to use one anyway as if he had a Cutlass-2 skill.

The only other quibble I have with these primitive weapons is that, in the
Player\'s Manual, on pg. 74 (COMBAT CHARTS) they list the following data
for Spear and Bayonet:
                                Pen     Block   Damage
                ______________|_______|_______|________
                bayonet       | 3     |   1   |   3
                spear         | 3     |   1   |   2

I just can\'t believe that a bayonet does more damage then a spear.  One
look at an illustrations (under the entry \'spear\') from G. C. Stone\'s "A
Glossary of the Construction, Decoration and Use of Arms and Armor in All
Countries and in All Times" is pretty convincing.  the values should be
reversed.


III. UNARMED COMBAT

Now we come to my major beef with MT skills.  The only official unarmed
combat skill provided is Brawling.  Further, damage for a barehanded
attack is 1 damage point for \'hand\', but nothing for a \'foot/kick\' attack.
This means that without a critical success, it\'s virtually impossible to
kill (or even knock out) a person with a single strike.  Not only is this
not very realistic for a trained combatant, but it greatly reduces the
chance for a player\'s PC to "steal up behind the security and quickly
render him unconscious with a lightning-swift chop to the neck".  IMHO,
this type of oversight needs to be remedied. 

First, I suggest adding a \'foot/kick\' attack, as follows:

                                Pen     Block   Damage
                ______________|_______|_______|________
                hand          | 1     |   1   |   1
                foot/kick     | 1     |   1   |   2

Second, add another unarmed combat skill: Martial Arts.  This skill
encompasses most FORMAL forms of unarmed combat, and includes (but is
not limited to) boxing, Judo, Karate, Savate, Tai Kwan Do, and Kung Fu.
This skill is run exactly the same way as Brawling, with 2 exceptions:
all attacks have an automatic DM of +2, and penetration for hand and
foot attacks is 2, not 1.

There.  Now I\'m happy with the system. :-)

Sorry to burden the list with this private letter but.....

Metlay,

   You sent me a letter a few days ago asking me why I had not posted
anything to the PBEM, or where I was.   
   My reply to you bounced twice.  We (the sysop and I) checked the 
pitt server and your machine was not listed.  So, I think I had a wrong
address.

   Unfortunately, at this time I cannot play in the PBEM.  I just don\'t have
the time.   
   I am finally in a Traveller/MegaT game.  Before I had only played it 
thrice: at three conventions .  Well, now that I have a regular group I 
am getting a Traveller fix.  I probably was the only one on the list who 
had never , ever played the game (when I joined last summer).

will probably never encounter other players, but will, er, seek out new
life forms and new civilizations, to boldly go... etc.  The main purpose
for this game is to try out my universe-generating software.  Some
long-time readers on this list may remember the Universe Simulation
Mailing List from 1988; I have written enough software to generate 90%
of the information needed for this type of game automatically.  The other
10%, generated by hand, contains probably 90% of the most interesting
material to a player.  I will be using the game to improve the software;
I may make available some reader-type programs.  The best players for this
game will be those who have an interest in world building and SFRPG, and
can program in C.  Assuming I\'m not the only one in the world, of course :->

If you are interested, send me e-mail with your address.  Tell me a little
about why you are interested in the idea.  I will send you 400 lines
or so of ship / crew design info and universe background, along with an
example of play.  If I get a lot of interest, I will post the whole thing
to the list.  However, due to limits on my time, I will probably only
pick three players at a time and keep the others on a waiting list.

Thanks for your time!

    'body' => 'Rob Dean writes about an armed merchant, a type of ship near and dear to
my heart -

Captain Grant, my merchant character in Metlay\'s game, could make a profit
with it legally (at least in the Solomani Rim.)  The key here is to constantly
engage in spec trade - take on whatever passengers happen by, but don\'t
let the hope of carrying a full load of passengers influence where you go next.
Don\'t even think about freight, it isn\'t worth it.

Some quick sample numbers:
Monthly payment is price/240 = Cr785,583

>Passengers=16, LowPassengers=20, Staterooms=25, LowBerths=20
>Cargo=1077kl (79t)

Assume an average of 10 high or mid passages and ignore low berths
for the moment - Life support = ~80,000 per month (2 jumps)
Crew Salaries ~30,000; Layaway for annual maint ~20,000
Docking is cheap, and fuel is free.
So total expenses per month = ~916,000 Credits

For trade, find a route with good trade mods and many cargos -
example: 2 Starport A, Hi pop worlds 1 jump apart (such as Suliman and
Vanefa in Concord/Solomani Rim) You also need someone with
Broker (so he can consult the cargo table twice), and Trader (to
determine the first die on the sale price table in advance).

Now 79 tons is small enough that on High pop worlds with 2 rolls on the
table you can usually fill most of your hold with cargo that has a prerolled
"6" on the sale table, giving an average multiplier of 270% with a Broker-4
= 216% after fees.  For these worlds, the buy price is 3,500/ton, and the
base sale price is 6,000 * 2.16 = 12,960 - 3,500 = 9460/ton net * 79 tons
* 2 trips per month = 1,494,680 Credits. An average of 10 Middle passages
adds another 160,000 Credits/month for a total of ~1,655,000 per month
giving a comfortable margin of ~739,000 credits profit per month if all goes
well.  There is enough slack to be able to survive some non-optimal trips,
so things would have to get pretty bad before a skilled merchant would
be forced to break the law just to meet payments.  Of course, these days
many areas have gotten pretty bad, but hey, thats what adventurers are
for...

>However,
>has anybody given any serious thought to the fact that the current game
freight
>and passenger rates are an artifact of Imperial regulation?

The current game freight and passenger rates are an artifact of the old
Traveller
book 2, which was written without any real comprehension of economics.  For
some insane reason, they didn\'t change them in MT, so that you pay the same
price for a Jump-1 as a Jump-6 passage.  What this means is if you use them,
you should only sell passages on Jump-1 ships, and only buy them on Jump-6
ships...:-)  I have been thinking about trying to rework the economic
rules (in my
copious free time), so one of these weeks I\'ll probably send in some of
my ideas
to see how they float.
	Anyway, I like the ship.  Have fun,

In response to the request for a review of the new MT II computer game
I can be of no help but I can offer my opinion of the MT I computer game.

Overall the game is good.  I liked the graphics.  The ship to ship combat
is fun and reasonably easy to do.  Exploring with the characters (there are
five characters) is also easy to do (ie nice, simple to use interface).
The big fault in the game is the combat (man to man) interface.  You can
only be one character at a time in combat mode and while switching between
them is not difficult it is not practical during combat.  So you attack 
with only one character while the other four stand still, don\'t fire, and
get killed.  This is particularly bad if your computer is especially fast.

This may sound like a BIG problem but thus far I have only encountered one
spot in the game where you really notice the problem.  Other places in the
game have required several attempts (save and restore) to get through with
out losing any characters but this one spot always kills off most or all
of my characters (grenade launchers are killers!).

A better interface, in my opinion, would be like the combat interface used
in Sentinel Worlds by Electronic Arts.  The leader selects a target and ALL
characters (even those not directly controlled) attack that target.

Any way with that one exception the game is fun and entertaining and very
much like playing Traveller.  The character generation system is exactly
like the basic system used by the game.

Hope this is somewhat useful/informative.  Sorry for the randomness of
this response but sometimes life is just a little chaotic...like now.

Later!

  Akerut Hercules Class Freighter (Type AH) TL15
  
  <Ship adaptation and blurb from The Traveller Adventure>
       The Hercules is a heavy duty carrier used for both bulk cargo and con-
  tainerized shipments.  The ship is in service primarily in the Aramis subsec-
  tor, but several examples are also in service with Tukera.  Because its jump-
  1 drives makes travel over longer distances difficult, Akerut maintains a 
  supply of 10125kl demountable fuel tanks at its starport locations within the 
  Aramis subsector.  Ships in the Hercules class carry names suggesting immense 
  size or strength, such as Mammoth, Gigant, Titan, Brobdingnag, and Sampson.

I\'d like to disagree with this slightly, and add one comment.  First the
disagreement: I think that combat handgun could be eliminated as well, leaving
you with only three skills to worry about.  Now the comment: As it stands
now, combat rifleman is only available under the cascade skill of "Special 
Combat", and I think it should be made available under "Gun Combat" for
military characters.

     Personally, I have no problem lumping all the heavy weapons together, 
because I don\'t run games where they are readily available, and there would
be no point in adding unused complexity.  I might switch for a primarily
military campaign, but I might not.

     By my reading of the rules, they are now...and that is good enough for
me, for the same reasons as mentioned under heavy weapons.  By the way, I
don\'t see immediately any career in which the energy weapons skill can be 
gained..which means it should probably be included under "Special combat."

     I think I would wing it if this was necessary...Disabling a not very
alert sentry would be a Difficult task, an alert sentry Formidable, two
alert sentries standing back to back with radar, IR, and NAS--Impossible.
(-:  (Ok, so that might be going a little too far, but you get the idea.)

TMLers,

There has been a slight change to the digest format prepared by the
Traveller Mailing List message digestifier.  Now, any line in the body
of a digested message which begins with a dash "-" character, has the
sequence dash-space "- " prepended.  This practice makes it easier to
burst the digests correctly, because you can be assured that any line in
the digest beginning with "--" delimits two seperate messages in the
digest.

This practice was modeled on the behavior of the MH "forw -digest" and
"burst" programs.  Bursters and other undigestifying programs should be
sure to strip the leading "- " from lines in the internal messages once
the messages are seperated out from the digest.

Thank Bob Suckling for this suggestion.

James

Subject: More forwarded from Scott Kellogg part 1
Organization: personal mailbox at The Next Challenge
 
Hello all,
      I\'ve been passing along the replies to Scott Kellogg\'s ship
designs (Vol 9 Issue 3) since he doesn\'t have net access. He\'s been
*VERY* busy again, and here are some new designs, ideas, and even a PC
he\'s come up with. I\'m still reading through the material as I edit it
for my local mailer, (theres\'s ~100k  worth of stuff), and it can only
handle a max of 250 lines per message. I\'ll break Scott\'s stuff into 
parts and post them over the next several days to avoid a glut.
 
      I\'ll recap in each message how to contact Scott, (we only get
together every 2-3 weeks), in case you REALLY need to reach him.
Please
feel free to reply either directly to him,  or me.
 
Thanks, and I hope you find this of interest.

 Oberlindes Lines Cargo Carrier Type CT TL15
 
 <Ship adaptation and blurb from The Traveller Adventure>
 
      The cargo carrier is a standard design commissioned by Oberlindes, and 
 is reflective of its total fleet.  Originally, Oberlindes outfitted his fleet 
 using naval surplus vessels; when the cargo carrier was designed, it reflect-
 ed the Oberlindes fleet\'s predisposition to extensive armament.  Oberlindes 
 ships show no consistent system of naming.

 Tukera Long Liner Type RT TL15
 
 <Ship adaptation and blurb from The Traveller Adventure>
      The Tukera long liner is a proprietary design, and is operated on many 
 of Tukera\'s routes as a standard passenger liner.  Built sturdily and intend-
 ed to last in service for decades, the long liner maintains a standard of 
 quality that other lines try to match.  Tukera\'s long liners are named to 
 recall the worlds it serves: Pride of Vland, Deneb Express and Spirit of 
 Rhylanor, for examples.

 Tukera Freighter Type AT TL15
 
 <Ship adaptation and blurb from The Traveller Adventure>
      The Tukera freighter is a standard Tukera transport ship design, and 
 provides freight handling service along many Tukera routes in the Imperium.  
 Tukera\'s freighters sport a variety of names, often vaguely reminiscent of 
 advertising slogans: Golden Harvest, Safety First, and Star Lines, for exam-
 ples.

 Akerut Hercules Class Freighter (Type AH) TL15
 
 <Ship adaptation and blurb from The Traveller Adventure>
      The Hercules is a heavy duty carrier used for both bulk cargo and con-
 tainerized shipments.  The ship is in service primarily in the Aramis subsec-
 tor, but several examples are also in service with Tukera.  Because its jump-
 1 drives makes travel over longer distances difficult, Akerut maintains a 
 supply of 10125kl demountable fuel tanks at its starport locations within the 
 Aramis subsector.  Ships in the Hercules class carry names suggesting immense 
 size or strength, such as Mammoth, Gigant, Titan, Brobdingnag, and Sampson.

 Type S Scout/Courier TL14
 
      The TL14 Scout Courier is nearly as capable as the TL15 version.  Vast 
 quantities of them were built for the IISS and private owners.  Probably the 
 majority of IISS surplus scouts that are in Detached Duty service are the 
 TL14 version. The cost given below does not include an auxiliary vehicle, but 
 provision for carrying something in the 4 ton class is made. An onboard fuel 
 purifier gives the vessel the capability for extended wilderness missions, 
 and its high capacity facilitates rapid rejumps when the vessel is assigned 
 as a courier.

 Type A3 Far Trader TL13
 
      This version of the Type A2 Far Trader can be built at TL13 when the 
 anticipated trade route needs that little bit of extra jump capability. This 
 version is intended for cargo transportation.  Two extra staterooms are pro-
 vided which may be used to carry middle passengers or extra crew members (or 
 removed to provide eight additional tons of cargo space at a cost saving of 
 0.8MCr).  A Reliable light ATV is carried as an auxiliary vehicle.  The type 
 A3 is known jokingly as the "Real far trader", or the "Even further trader" 
 among free traders.

  Myrmidon Grav Tank TL15
  
       The Myrmidon is a heavy grav tank.  It sacrifices mobility for protec-
  tion, and is equipped with armor that will prevent penetration by anything 
  short of a starship weapon.  Its large size permits long endurance.  Its 
  sensor and communication suite is equal to that carried by most Imperial 
  warships, which enables it to be readily integrated into any sort of combined 
  arms operation.

  Draft Imperial Strike Cruiser
  
       This draft was produced on 31 October 1990.  As conceived, the strike 
  cruiser is almost all offense.  Defensive considerations are limited to light 
  armor, a small battery of lasers and sand casters, and fairly high agility.  
  (I don\'t think you can get a whole lot more agile than this and still provide 
  power for a spinal mount.)  Endurance calculations are based on running power 
  covering life support and 4-G acceleration (as well as the low power weapons, 
  if needed). Running power is 48% of full power, which is close enough to say 
  that one combat hour costs two endurance hours.

  Privateer Packet TL13
  
       This armed merchant vessel has been converted for military or paramili-
  tary service by building bays for three armed launches into the space former-
  ly occupied by the cargo hold, and removing the low berths to provide a small 
  quantity of cargo space. The total cost of the conversion would be MCr93.04 
  including the purchase of the launches.  The price given below takes into 
  account the removal of the low berths, and should be used for calculation of 
  annual maintenance.

Remarks:    Several people have suggested that we come up with
MegaTrav
versions of the old Supplement 9 Fighting Ships.  Well here\'s one of
my old faves.  This one goes along with the old game.  Admittedly, it
has a few changes, but I have tried to get it as close as possible to
the original.  The old one had a model 6fib computer this has a model
8 to try to get the crew compliment right.  (It still didn\'t work, but
I used the original crew numbers anyway.)  Please remember the fuel
scoops on the actual cruiser are only usable in an emergency, normally
the ship relies on its fuel barges.  This takes a total of 106 barge
loads. Therefore the cruiser is most often deployed with a tanker.

Remarks:    From Supp 9:  "The Azhanti High Lightning" is an obsolete
multi-purpose cruiser capable of a variety of different functions. 
Most noticable is the ship\'s high jump (jump-5) capability, which
gives
it great reacitve mobility.
 
It is this quality that has kept the ship in service in spite of it\'s
inferior agility (sic) and weaponry.
 
      Several examples of the ship have been transferred to the Scout
Serviceand friendly client-states.  Much of the remaining examples of
the class were referbished to the above specifications and now serve
as frontier cruisers on the Imperial boarders.

  Agreed. Also note that in the MT errata, Shotgun is also part of the
Rifleman skill.

made >available under "Gun Combat" for military characters.

  Sounds reasonable. Has anyone noticed the apparent absence of Combat
Rifleman skill in the basic character generation system (at least it is
difficult to get). I would have thought that military personell would
have more Combat Rifleman training than any other sort of weapons.
Certainly the US and Australian armies do.

I think a defiency of most combat systems that I have seen is their
inability to handled situations like this. I would propose the
following tasks for disabling (read knocking unconscious) an opponent.

  To render a target unconscious:
  Routine, Brawling, Str, Absolute (fateful)
  Referee: This supposes the target is totally unaware of the attacker.
For semi-alert targets, the task becomes Difficult. For alert targets
it is Formidable. If the target is aware of the attacker\'s presence
(e.g., in combat), the task is Impossible. Decrease the severity of the
task if the attacker is using a weapon approriate for the task, a club, for example.

>>  First, I suggest adding a \'foot/kick\' attack, as follows:

>
>Needed and noted.

I don\'t agree. Except for trained martial artists most people do not
know how to use their feet effectively in combat; even if they did hit
it probably wouldn\'t be as effective as many imagine. By the same
token, during a combat round you could strike you opponent many more
time with your hands than with you feet (you have to stand on something
:-) I suggest that the damage for foot/kick attacks be reduced to only
1. As for martial artists (and I think that Mark\'s suggestions are
excellent) the extra +2 they receive for each attack, plus the
additional point of penetration make them very effective. I think that
game balance is threatened if you opt to use a damage of 2 for feet -
it\'s getting too close to the damage inflicted by most of the small and
medium sized firearms, and besides, your feet never run out of ammo!

Finally, does anyone have a gripe with grenade rules. The lower tech
level hand grenades have a danger space of only 1.5m, which means that
only the target square is effected. That sounds pretty dumb. It means
that if you don\'t hit the target square you can\'t hurt the target.
Also, how do you handle throws that miss. The rules say to use the
indirect fire scattering rules, but they seem have been omitted from
the rulebook. This is a real downer `cause I LOVE grenades.

More later,

Iain.

This is an adjunct to my previous posting re: MT Combat.

In my last posting I suggested a task profile for rendering a target
unconscious. On reflection it could be improved by making it a
confrontation, as follows:

  To render an opponent unconscious:
  Simple, Off=Brawling, Str; Def=Hits, Absolute (confrontation).
  Referee: This assumes the target is unaware of of the attacker\'s
	   presence. Semi-alert - Routine, alert - Difficult,
	   fully aware - Formidable. Appropriate weapon - decrease
	   difficulty. Hits is the number before the slash in the
	   target\'s Life Force (e.g., 3/5 means the defender has a
	   DM of -3).

This now takes the opponent\'s state of health into account.

Remarks:    The above is from FASA\'s Adventure class ships Vol. 1
 
Admittedly, as in the "Lightning" class cruiser above, I fudged the
crew requirements to fit the original, but if I didn\'t, the published
deck plans wouldn\'t fit.
 
      "The "Lucifer" class destroyer escort is a common ship employed
to screen and support destoyers in the 3 to 5-kton range.  Some 4000
of this class have been deployed for front line service, mostly in the
Corridor, Deneb, and Spinward Marches sectors.  With jump-4 and 6-G
capabilities, it has proven capable of fulfilling the escort role
admirably, and is often referred to fondly as "one helluva ship!"
 
      An agile ship, the destroyer escort is nevertheless heavily
armored and well armed.  The mix of weaponry carried aboard allow
effective operations at any range, with nuclear and HE missiles
causing
damage at long range, while the fusion gun and laser turrets (sic)
function best at short range. 
 
      The "Lucifer" class is routinely assigned to garrison and patrol
duties or as part of a larger squadron fleet.  It is often employed,
too, on detached duty, performing a variety of special errands and
missions."  - From Adventure Class Ships Vol 1

Remarks:    "The \'Valor\' class missile corvette is a relatively new
ship, and only about 200 have been placed in service to date.  Few
have
reached the Spinward Marches yet; those which have done so currently
remain on escort duty with ships in the 2-3 Kton range in rear-echelon
areas.
      The \'Valor\' class was originally intended to operate in
flotillas, remaining at long range throughout the course of an
engagement.  Intended to set up intensive missile barrages, the
corvette has four triple missile turrets and stores a large supply of
nuclear and HE missiles.  These are highly effective against smaller
vessels, wtih the HE missiles being of great use in limited
bombardments or against nuclear dampers." -Adventure Class Ships

Remarks:    The above is from FASA\'s Adventure class ships Vol. 1.
 
      "The "Zhdits" clas destroyer is an outdated Zhodani design based
upon a failed tactical concept.  Originally intended to fulfill a
totally offensive role working in concert with destroyers, planners
felt that the ship could survive long enough to see the enemy
defeated. 
This proved to be wishfull thinking; many "Zhdits" class ships were
lost in combat during the Forth Frontier War. 
 
Lacking armor, they were easy targets for Imperial fighters and SDBs. 
It was discovered that the ships could not effectively screen the
destroyers, making them, in the last analysis, more of a liability
than
an asset in battle.
 
      Only 200 "Zhdits" class destroyer escorts remain in Zhodani
service (with others scattered among client states to rimward, sold as
surplus to emerging allies).  The Zhodani tend to employ them in small
patrol squadrons near the Consulate borders with the Vargr Extents and
the rimward clients.  In combat, "Zhdits" class escorts are now held
back to protect destroyers with laser anti-missile fire.
 
      Note:  Laser turret controls aboard the "Zhdits" class ships are
outdated models.  Mechanisms spin the seat and controls in sync with
the turret\'s movements.  This was done to give the gunner a better
feel
for his weapon\'s realationship to the ship, but, like much of the
destroyer escort, didn\'t work out well in field use." -     From
Adventure Class Ships Vol 1

survey forms has been, well, somewhat less than overwhelming.  James tells
me we have over 200 subscribers to TML.  So far, the only E-mail survey
returns I\'ve been sent have been from:

        Nick Christenson        Metlay
        Jonathan Clark          James Nelson
        Scott Ellsworth         J. David Nilles

        Bob Koester             Eric Sergienko
        Jim Lai                 Hans Visser

If I\'d only placed a bet on who\'d return their survey first, Metlay would
have made me at least $5.00 richer :-).  I can\'t believe that most of the
TML readers aren\'t really interested in winning that $100.00 prize (although
one of the above returnees already indicated that he really WASN\'T interested
in receiving the prize and could he transfer it to James if he won?  Amazing!)

Anyway, I hope this low response means that most of you are sending your
surveys DIRECTLY to DGP.  If not, remember, it\'s not every day you get
to help determine what a new role-playing game on the market will be like!

Get those surveys in.

to hit you with one of our own, while you\'re in the mood :-).

Richard, James, and I thought it might be a good idea to get a cross
section of the TML readership to A) determine the amount of computing
power at the TML\'s collective disposal, B) find out what types of
graphics formats folks can support (for distribution of images), and
C) to establish some general demographic data for statistical purposes.

With that in mind, I present to you the first semi-irregular TML Reader
Survey.  It will only take a few minutes and some lucky reader will be
drawn at random from the returned surveys to have his (or her) TML
membership renewed FOR FREE.  The rest of you will just have to pay up
when your lifetime memberships expire :-).

SERIOUSLY, we are going to have a drawing from among the survey returnees.
One person will be chosen at random to receive ANY gaming product of their
choice (value not to exceed $15.00), which will then be immediately shipped
to them.  This offer good only on products currently in production, or
available in stock at the Weekend Warrior.  If you\'re not sure, send me
(Mark Cook) E-mail and ask.

Please E-mail your completed surveys to either me (markc@hpcvss.cv.hp.com)
or the TML moderator (jamesp@metolius.wr.tek.com).  If it\'s less trouble,
feel free to print out the survey, fill it out by hand, and mail it to:

    James T. Perkins                        Mark F. Cook

    USA                                     USA

If you\'d rather not answer some of the questions, please fill in as many of
the others as possible and send it in anyway.  Even partial data will help
us to improve the usefulness and functionality of the TML for everyone.  Also,
we know there\'s some overlap between the DGP survey and this one, but it\'s
minimal and it makes data collection much faster for us.

This information will be held in the strictest confidentiality and will not
be provided to any other person, organization, or agency without your specific
consent.  It will be used for statistical purposes only, in an attempt to
provide a higher quality of service to the readers of the TML.

I too was somewhat dissatisfied with the combat skills in MegaTraveller,
so I threw them away and made up my own. This was already a somewhat
non-standard version of MT, since I was using the combat rules from ICE
SpaceMaster (has anyone else done this?), and the Universe from MT.  As
far as ``high-tech\'\' weapons went, I ended up with 5 groups of weapons
which I considered to be similar enough to be covered by the same skill:

	Handheld    1-Handed    2-Handed    Launcher    Heavy

each of which was then split into ``recoil\'\' and ``recoilless\'\', making
ten skills in all. Each weapons then fell fairly easily into one of the
ten categories. Almost all weapons come in various weights which affect
the range, the damage done, and the way the weapon was wielded.

Examples (note that SpaceMaster has more available weapons than MT, and
some of them are called different things, I\'m mixing and matching here):

Handheld:
	Recoil:
		Body Pistol, Pistol, Revolver, MLA (Gauss) Pistol
	Recoilless:
		Laser Pistol, Blast Pistol, Stun (Neural) Pistol
1-Handed:
	Recoil:
		Submachinegun, Carbine, Shotgun, Flamer
	Recoilless:
		Laser Carbine, Blaster, Stunner, Rocket
2-Handed:
	Recoil:
		Assault Rifle, ACR, Autorifle, MLA Rifle, Auto Shotgun
	Recoilless:
		Laser Rifle, Blast Rifle, Plasma Gun, Neural Rifle
Launcher:
	Recoil:
		Grenade
	Recoilless:
		RPG, Bazooka, TOW
Heavy:
	Recoil:
		Machinegun, SAM (eg Stinger), MLA
	Recoilless:
		Laser, Blaster

I also stuck in a couple of Artillery skills (light and heavy), just in
case anyone wanted to use mortars and such.

A level in any category cost 1 point (my players spend points to build
their characters) and gives +10 on a d100 roll. Additionally there was a
``Gun Combat\'\' skill which cost 5 points, and gave 1 level in each of the
above 10 (what a deal!).

I differ with Mark in that my MLA (Magnetic Linear Accelerator, aka Gauss)
weapons had a heavier recoil than the ``equivalent\'\' explosive weapon, but
they also had much greater range and penetrating power.  Remember, recoil
is caused by momentum change, not by energy expenditure.  Also my Neural
weapons were deemed to fire in exactly the same way as Laser weapons, but
just to project sonic energy of some variety instead of EM radiation. This
made them useless in vacuum, of course, but extremely effective in an
atmosphere. Apart from the normal stunners and pain-inducers, SpaceMaster
has a weapon called a disruptor which does very nasty things to the target\'s
internal organs. One can certainly postulate that the effect of such a
weapon would cause such trauma that a nearby psionic could pick it up.

RoleMaster (with which SpaceMaster is very compatible) has a huge set of
rules dealing with Martial Arts and Primitive Weapons. I was far less
sophisticated than Mark in integrating these, having only 5 categories of
Primitive Weapons, and two for Unarmed Combat. These were:

Primitive:
	Handheld:
		dagger, shortsword, force knife
	1-Handed:
		sword, rapier, cutlass, cudgel
	2-Handed:
		2H sword, power sword
	Chopping:
		battle axe, hand axe
	Extended:
		pole arms
Unarmed:
	Unarmed Combat:
		Judo/Karate/Martial Arts synthesis
	Brawling:
		no rules, use of available weapons

I made these last two cross-over skills at -2, so that Unarmed Combat 3
was equivalent to Brawling 1, and vice versa.

Well, I seem to have rambled on for longer than I anticipated, I hope
that someone gets some use out of the jottings above.

      Designers notes.  OK, folks are you ready for the next design
rules controversy?  Robert Dean recently sent a design for a TL8
aircraft carrier.  In his notes he suggests that the fuel consumption
for a fission reactor is not per hour as printed but per year.  This
started the wheels turning (Very dangerous when applied to Scott
Kellogg).  There is indeed something dreadfully wrong with the fission
fuel consumption figure.  The U.S.S. Nautilus\'s (first atomic sub)
reactor had an output of approximately 11Mw.  It was refueled
approximately every two years.  I calculate that the reactor would
consume about four times the weight of the sub in that period of time.
 
      If we take it that Robert is correct and it would consume the
listed figure per year sounds much better.  But, this means that the
energy density of fission is greater than that of the fuel for fusion,
and we know that fusion is more powerful than fission.  Megatrav
fusion
plants therefore must be EXTREMELY ineffiecient in their fuel
consumption.  This may be because of the fact that fusion reactors
would be very inefficient burning hydrogen.  So, maybe they aren\'t
burning hydrogen after all...  Now don\'t get in an uproar, I mean they
are probably burning only the deuterium that can be found in hydrogen.

This sort of begs the question, what if I fill my tanks with only
deuterium?  I don\'t know offhand what the proportion of deuterium to
hydrogen is 1 in 100? one in 1000? Probably 100 is underestimating it.

But, it is a safe side estimate.  So fill your tanks with deuterium
and
you\'ll get a hundred fold improvement in fuel economy.  It would
certainly be expensive, but deuterium enriched fuel ought to
be available at military bases at least...  At High Prices!
 
      In any case I began pondering the idea of fission powered
starships.  Here are a few for your perusal.
 
      Actually, one original idea did come to me on the subject of
nuclear dampers.  Essentually, they work by shortening the halflife of
a radioactive element.  Conservation of energy says the energy will
have to be released anyway.
 
So what happens when you focus your damper on a fission pile?  All the
nuclei start splitting (fissioning?:  verb form of fission?) at a much
faster rate and so you increase the output of your pile.
 
      This gets into another question I have:  the disintigrator:  A
souped up damper which splits the nucleii of its targets.  What about
the mass difference and good old E=MC^2?  Of course the mass
difference
would be less if you dissintigrated a person rather than a few kilos
of enriched Uranium, but the basic problem is still the same.  I would
think that the amount of energy released by the matter conversion
would
be more destructive than the effect of the disintigrator in the first
place, and would release a hell of a lot of radiation.  What GDW has
described as a disintigrator is more like a partial conversion beam.

Remarks:    The "High Guard" class cruiser is designed for precisely
that mission.  Thus far it is deployed purely experimentally but as
more and more ships are pressed into service by the rebellion, the
class may yet see full production.  The ship carries 2 nuclear
dampers,
the lower powered of these is used for engine shielding and
supercharging.  As a nuclear damper works essentially by shortening
the
half life of fissionable materials, the damper is able to force the
decay of the reactor fuel, thereby greatly increasing the output of
the
reactor.  This of course will lower the endurance, but there is
sufficent fuel to fully power the ship for one year without using the
supercharger.
 
      In practice the ship can sustain itself for longer than that by
reducing the reactors output when not needed, or by using the ship\'s
black globe as an energy collector.  Fuel economy is vital for this
particular ship as while it has a huge endurance, it must still refuel
and large quantities of fissionables are not always available in bulk,
the ship can not just dip into a gas giant or ocean, but must stop at
a Naval weapons facility to take on the large amount of nuclear fuel.
 
      The ship\'s unusual ability to go without refueling for extended
periods is used as its name suggests in a high guard role while other
ships refuel, thus the class is will probably see duty as tanker
escort
when full scale production begins.
 
      As a dedicated high guard vessel, an experiment in jump
technology has been tested in the prototype:  the \'ANNIC NOVA\' jump
technique.  This drive does not use liquid hydrogen, but...
 
**********CLASSIFIED*********CENSORED**********
 
*...influx from the black globe.  As all energy is absorbed by the
globe, the ship would use this energy for jump.  The ship would dive
into a planets gravity well and turn the globe on.  Light, heat, and
gravitation are converted into usable energy and this is dumped into
the jump drive.  Rumor has it that the system has been attempted by
the
prototype \'High Guard\'.  It is said that the resultant misjump placed
a moratorium on all further testing, but the software for the
technique
is still in place.

      FAX: FAX submissions must be sent after 6 p.m. CST. FAX submissions of
 more than 20 pages must have prior approval. Disk submissions are preferred,
 as described above.
      Modem: Submissions by modem are not accepted at this time.
 
 ACCEPTANCE
      After looking over your manuscript, we will notify you within 30 days of
 one of three possible results. First, we may decide to reject the manuscript.
 Where possible, we will comment on how it could be improved for possible
 resubmission. We cannot stress enough the importance of taking a rejection in
 the spirit intended--don\'t be discouraged. Second, we may return the
 manuscript to you with notes on how we would like to see it changed to better
 fit our needs. Third, we may accept the article outright. Accepted articles
 are subject to editing. If you have not heard from us within two months of
 sending in your submission, please get in touch with us.
 
 PAYMENT
      Challenge pays $.02 per word upon publication. You will be paid for the
 number of words published, not the number of words submitted. If a submission
 is a collaboration, we need to know who gets what portion of the payment.
 Payment is for all rights, unless other arrangements have been negotiated in
 advance.
 
FORMAT
      We strongly encourage submissions on disk--see Computers above. Those
 without a word processor will have to rely on the typewriter. We cannot
 consider handwritten manuscripts. All manuscripts must be double-spaced on
 standard-sized white or off-white paper. The first page must contain the
 author\'s name and address, as well as the title of the article, the game it
 refers to, and the publisher of that game. Each page must be numbered and
 contain the author\'s name. If more than one manuscript is submitted at a
 time, please include a brief one- or two-word summation of the title on each
 page so we may tell them apart should the pages get shuffled together. Never
 send your only copy of an article.
 
STYLE
      Manuscripts should be written as clearly as possible, without excessive
 wordiness. As a general rule to the beginning writer, determine what you want
 to say ahead of time--never just sit down and write.
      Headings: Challenge uses three levels of heading. The first is the title
 of the article. Next, any divisions within the article need section headings,
 which are all caps on their own line (like Style, above). Any further
 divisions within a section need subsection headings, which are upper and
 lower case, followed by a colon and text (like Headings, above). Don\'t worry
 about making these bold unless youUre working on a Macintosh.
      Tables: Many of the articles written for a gaming magazine will have
 tables in them. If yours does, we will want to see a printout of each table
 the way it should appear to help our typesetters get the table set up
 correctly.
 
 SUBJECT MATTER
     This is the most important criterion we consider. We want our readers to
 be interested in the articles we publish. Don\'t be afraid of trying something
 new--we are looking for unique ideas. The worst thing that can happen is that
 your idea will be rejected. In general, adventure scenarios are much in demand.
 Sourcebook-type information should be combined with adventure ideas using
 that information whenever possible. In addition, roleplaying games can use
 support articles on game variants or referee\'s notes. Game variants should be
 playtested in advance by you and be applicable to a broad range of gaming
 situations. Referee\'s notes should give hints to the referee on how to
 increase interest in the game, how to make his life easier, or how to spark
 his own imagination.

      Challenge articles deal with science-fiction roleplaying in all its
 myriad forms (and we adopt a rather liberal definition of "science fiction").
 Twilight: 2000, MegaTraveller, Space: 1889, and 2300 AD are GDW\'s SF RPGs,
 but do not limit yourself to just these games when writing articles. We will
 look at articles on any science-fiction roleplaying game by any publisher,
 including Shadowrun, Torg, Star Trek, Star Wars, Battletech, Warhammer,
 Renegade Legion, Call of Cthulhu, GURPS, Paranoia, Cyberpunk, and others.
 
 Articles for Twilight: 2000
 All articles must be consistent with Twilight: 2000 2nd edition. We have
 attempted to make the adventure background of Twilight: 2000 as rich in
 detail as possible to enhance its believability. This remains the continuing
 top priority. What we need for Challenge are:
      -- Short adventure situations (mini-modules) of 8-10,000 words in
 length, which describe a single adventure situation and a small segment of
 geographic territory necessary for the adventure. Preferably these should
 make use of existing modules for the general background information, but in
 the case of new geographic locations this will not be possible.
      -- Descriptions of items of equipment which have not been dealt with
 before and which will have significant value to the readership as a whole.
 Keep the descriptions consistent with what has been done before (when rating
 a new vehicle, for instance, keep things consistent with similar vehicles in
 the game).
      -- Short descriptions of generic locations (a village, an abandoned
 factory, a boatyard, etc.) that can be used in a wide variety of geographic
 locales (anywhere on the eastern United States, for example, or anywhere in
 southern Poland). These should be about 2000 words in length, and can include
 maps or building diagrams.
      -- Descriptions of generic personalities which (like the generic
 locations described above) can be used in a variety of situations and locales.
      -- In-depth examinations of modern military life or military equipment
 by those who have experienced or used it. Try to keep to the basics, and give
 only such details as will be helpful to a referee in making an adventure
 session more realistic.
 
 Articles for MegaTraveller
      All Traveller articles must be usable in the MegaTraveller universe.
      Amber Zone: Amber Zone scenarios should be anywhere from 1500 to 4000
 words in length. Amber Zones should be challenging, interesting, and
 open-ended, and should not require extremely rare skills, combinations of
 skills, or exotic equipment unless that equipment is somehow provided.
 Include tasks where appropriate. Sketches or diagrams--such as maps and
 player handouts--should be included. Don\'t be afraid of obtaining some length
 to add detail to the scenario, but try not to go beyond 4000 words. Amber
 Zones should consist of two parts: the Player\'s Information segment and the
 Referee\'s Information segment. The Player\'s Information section should
 contain an introductory paragraph or two which detail any background data of
 relevance to the job, as well as a general statement of the task. The
 remainder should be devoted to describing the mission in such detail as would
 be available to the players before they accept the job (a run-down on any
 obvious dangers and a statement of the proposed rewards). The Referee\'s
 Information section should fully describe the situation, giving all relevant
 information which the players can find out if they investigate or participate,
 plus all information which the players cannot find out but which may affect
 them anyway. If any material is unchanged from the Player\'s Information
 section, it is not necessary to repeat it.
      Bestiary: Descriptions for a Bestiary should be between 500 and 1500
 words long. When writing Bestiary articles, use the rules to their logical
 extent. Create an animal using the rules, then build from that foundation.
 The organisms described should be logical, well-thought-out inhabitants of a
 particular ecological niche, not monsters (they may, however, be large and/or
 dangerous, within these guidelines). Body parts should all have a logical
 function, which might or might not be readily apparent. The descriptions
 should not be random collections of parts (head of a lion, body of a horse
 with human feet...). Exotic characteristics (such as psionic abilities)
 should be used sparingly and with great thought. You are encouraged to
 include a sketch of the animal. Don\'t worry about your artistic abilities--
 these are for artistic reference only.
       Ship\'s Locker: Descriptions of equipment should be from 500 to 1500
 words long. The items should be of interest to MegaTraveller players and
 widely available. Try to avoid items which have already been described.
 You are encouraged to create interesting science-fiction devices. Another
 gun or another vehicle should have some very intriguing characteristics to
 make it worthy of publication. Try not to directly steal ideas from
 literature or the movies, even unconsciously--add ideas of your own. Provide
 a sketch if possible. 
 
 Articles for 2300 AD
     2300 AD is a unique gaming universe. Articles pertaining to this
 environment should have the gritty, realistic feel of that universe as
 opposed to the free-booting galactic empire space opera of MegaTraveller.
 Since 2300 AD is a much newer system, it is still in its infancy from the
 point of view of Challenge. Much of its background and detail can and will
 be fleshed out in the magazine. However, we who have created the game and
 its environment have the final word on background information, so if you have
 ideas, you may want to submit them in writing before you attempt to complete
 an article on them.
 
 Articles on Other Games
      Challenge is the magazine of science-fiction gaming. We are not
 restricting you to writing just about our games or just about roleplaying
 games. Any significant article which deals with futuristic gaming might be
 accepted. If you\'re not sure your idea fits in, just ask us before you set it
 to paper. Basically, we are looking for meaty articles on these games, such
 as adventure scenarios, rules variants, and gaming hints. Again, ask yourself
 if it would interest you, and go from there.
 
 CONCLUSION
     Now that you have a better idea what we are looking for, it\'s time to get
 down to the heart of the matter and put your ideas to paper. If you have any
 questions, send them to us along with a stamped, self-addressed envelope.
 Good luck.

      Hloch is from the planet Jaeyelya B-484655-4.  (Location unknown
inside the Imperium by somebody\'s oversight)
 
      He is fairly well known inside the Imperium in the science
circles.  Something of a Traveller\'s version of Dr. Richard Feyneman
and James Burke.  (If you don\'t know these people you wouldn\'t have
heard of Hloch.)
 
      Hloch has traveled the Imperium for a long time thus nullifying
most of the effects of coming from a TL 4 planet.  His main concern is
the benefit of his planet.  Traveling Aels have a strong
responsibility
to their entire race. It is only the gifted that actually do so and it
cost the planet dearly to send off it\'s brightest off planet to be
educated so that that knowlege can be brought back.  (They may be only
TL4 but they are highly civilized.)
 
      Hloch is very interested in the dissemination of advanced
technical knowlege and has a knack for making complicated ideas easily
understandable.  This comes from his overall mission which is to bring
back technical data to improve his home planet.  He can be down right
nosey (if he had a nose) in faced with a mystery.  (He has got a
security clearance)
 
      He spent 2 terms in the scout service, one as an explorer and
the
next he was sent up to admin where he began his research carrer. 
Periodically, promising candidates are sent by the scout service for
training in the Imperial Science Academy.  After spending two years
there was given detached duty to continue there permanantly.
 
      The scout service has from time to time given him interesting
problems while working at various reserach stations.  One of these was
the Viper class fighter.
 
      The Navy test pilot he worked with on the Viper project was Lt.
Cdr. Kittan K\'Boutle, a female Ael Yael and leader of the Imperial
Flight Demonstration Team Blue Angels.  Since then Kittan has
transferred to the Imperial Science Academy and is continuing to work
with Hloch.
 
      Most recently he has been working on the Nebula class lab ship.

      The plane can if necessary land at unprepared areas for
planetary
exploration.  The plane would have to glide in and use it\'s rocket for
a VERY quick verticle landing (don\'t risk the turbo fan where there
could be particles that could damage it. (FOD))

Remarks:    The "Nebula" class is another Hloch design.  The ship\'s
repulsor is rather special.  Basically Repulsors are high powered grav
projectors. (according to High Guard) This particular one is set up as
an extremely powerful telescope/densitometer.  Essentually, you have
a device that warps time/space much like a black hole or any other
gravitational well.
 
      Rumor has it that Hloch worked extensively at an imperial
research station investigating artificial black holes before
porceeding
with the design.  It is unknown weither or not the Nebula can actually
create a black hole.  If so, the ship would be the most powerful in
the
Imperium.  (quite a bombardment weapon wouldn\'t you say?)
 
      In an interview the designer spoke of the ship:
 
      "The ship was designed at the request of those of the government
place.  I was tracked by those who would have vessels which could
accommodate Ael Yaels more comfortably than the human designed
closets. 
They wanted to build something like a K\'Kree vessel which are widely
known for their spaciousness. Unfortunately, no Ael Yael of the
government place grasp well the K\'Kree or their vessels (No
carnivorous
Ael Yael has ever met a K\'Kree).  I, however, grasped their designs
were not really suitable.  I designed the ship so that it would be a
versatile and nimble flyer for any prey:  from stars to sophonts.
 
      In an effort to not just make a ship for Ael Yaels I saw to it
that the accommodations could be adjusted to suit different species,
after all we must recognize that Ael Yaels are not the only sophonts. 
I had to fly against the winds of the government place on this point
but in the end, they realized I was looking down from above their
field
of vision.
 
      At the horizon, the ship was built and the architect\'s fee went
mostly to the planetary development fund thus partially making the
ship
pay for itself, but a small amount went towards adding lab equipment
to the ship.  The plans have now been sold to some major ship building
yards to pay back the planetary development fund.  How the business
deals were made I do not grasp, but they did it.
 
      The ship rises much from Scout space for research, exploration
and survey.  I am much bettered for the kind thermals of the Scout
Service.  Their vehicles and setups have been flown well and withstood
many a gale.
 
      The Nebula class lab ship\'s talons have been made into eyes. 
The
"spinal mount" is a high powered telescope.  Instead of glass lenses,
howver, this telescope uses a gravitic lensing system to focus light
to an image.  The turrets mount smaller finder telescopes to aid in
observations." -Hloch of Jayelya
 
      Designed with the comfort of as many races as possible in mind,
the pressure, atmospheric content, gravity and even the walls and
ceilings of the staterooms are adjustable to suit the needs and
comfort
of the occupants.
 
      The ship was designed however, with Ael Yael psychology always
in sight.  The lab ceiling is a transparent dome with a protective
cover.  The sheild is usually retracted to reveal the open sky and
incidentally adding to the efficiency of the telescope as reflectors. 
The lab area is built surrounding the common area thus using the space
of both as an aviary for relaxing flyers. The main elevator of the
ship
which runs down the spine of center of the ship is uncovered, allowing
crew to fly where they are going rather than having to ride.
 
      The cutter bay holds 3 modules easily allowing the modules to be
put directly into the cutter without having to leave one in open space
while switching them.  The cutter is rotated to the proper attitude
and
the module installed.  If necessary a 4th module can be carried inside
the cutter, then incurring the necessity of having to leave a module
outside before obtaining the needed one.

    'body' => 'Prompted by Scott Kellog\'s comments on nuke dampers:

  The nuke damper is a confusing chapter, at least as confusing as jumpspace,
reaction-less thrusters and extremely inefficient fusion reactors.
  Different sources have different opinions about how it works, if it works and
how much it charges per hour.

Nuke Dampers in Old Traveller:
  In \'Mercenary\' it was mentioned that nuke dampers made it possible to prevent
nuclear decay. This was supposed to be used in \'americum drones\', small RPV\'s
equipped auto-cannons that fired hollow americum (or some other superheavy
element). Upon impact the round collapsed and went critical with spectacular
results.

  One might have some doubt over whether this will work even theoretically.
An analogus round (but much larger) made of plutonium or enriched uranium will
probably not work because the collapse of the round is too slow and to coarse
to produce a real nuclear explosion.

  In any case, old traveller (and striker?) claim that the nuke damper damps
nuclear reactions by making the strong/weak force (I\'m not a physisist, so I\'m
not sure which one is responsible for nuclear reactions) fluctuate in nodes in
a field. It will have local maxima and minima in those nodes, and if the nodeis
placed at the location of a nuke missile that detonates, the nuclear reaction
will be supressed, and the fissionable materials will be just so much junk
metal.
  Laser-ignited fusion warheads were mentioned as a countermeasure somewhere,
but I think that this was played down because of play balance in TCS.
  The opposite nodes (when sufficiently strong) would make everything very
radiactive and even lead would dissappear in a burst of radiation (this is the
background of the disintegrator).

Nuke Dampers in MegaTraveller:
  Some newer sources (MT Refs manual (Vehicle Design) and (?) Starship OpMan)
claim that the field of a nuclear damper will make fissionable materials
(permanently?) inert when they pass through it.
  (This probably surprised many a General when everyone took the banned weapons
out of the closet at the start of the Rebelion. All those expensive americum
rounds just went \'plonk\' instead of \'Ka[0.1kt]BOOOM!\':)
  There apparently is another explanation sneaking around where the nuke damper
cause the fissionable materials to decay prematurely, creating a small \'hot\'
cloud of gaseous plutonium on a safe distande from the ship.

Nuke Dampers in Reality:
  "What? Now he\'s really off the deep end!" you say. That isn\'t (entirely)
accurate, though. There were an short article in an old New Scientist 
(Brittish paper, Scientific American class but has many shorter articles on
 scientific news. It also runs \'Grimbledon Down\' a comic strip about life at
 a military research installation:) about a curious result of quatum mecanics.

  I assume that you all know Scroedingers cat. ("Shroedingers cat, the TML.
TML, Shroedingers Cat.") ie that radiactive decay is a probability function that
will break down into one of two possible result (have decayed or havn\'t decayed)
when it is observed, not before. Either result will be 50% probable if we have
left it alone for the time of one half-life.
  
  If one keeps observing the atom continousy, it will be locked in the original
state, because the probability function will be be continously \'broken down\'.

  The article was about how a research team had proven this in an experiment.
They had used very fast laser pulses to illuminate the atoms of an radiactive
substanse, thus forcing them into a predictable state. 
  When the time between the pulses became small enough (and that was the real
challenge) the substance\'s half-life became longer...

  It seems that nuke dampers is at least physically possible.

      The Viper:  put some fangs in your Air/Raft bay...
 
      "Pirates?  Corsairs?  The Viper class escort fighter is ready. 
You say you can\'t afford an escort?  Here\'s the one to fit the bill. 
For about what you pay for two triple turrets, here is a six G
capable,
multi-role fighter that fits in...  Your Air/Raft bay!
 
      A three ton fighter, the Viper is capable of taking on all
comers.  She\'s light, fast and carries six tons of ordinance.  Since
its procurement in 1108, The Viper has found its place in all branches
of the Imperial military.  To the Navy, it serves as an escort
fighter. 
To the Army and COACC, it\'s a ground attack and air superiority
fighter.  To the Scouts it is a light penetration probe.  To the
Marines it\'s a multi-role fighter vital to drop troop operations. 
The Viper has served the Imperium well since the Fifth Frontier War."
       -From the advertising brochure
 
                                  Development
      The Imperium is made up of thousands of worlds.  Few of these
have ship yards, and only the cream of these are capable of producing
tech fifteen ships. For example, in the Spinward Marches, there are
only three planets capable of producing tech level fifteen ships for
the Imperium, three capable of producing tech fourteen ships, and
seven
which produce tech thirteen ships out of the ninety one Imperial
planets which build ships in the sector.
 
      But there is little market for a tech level nine ship.  But how
can they improve their facilities if they don\'t sell what they can
build?
 
      Normally, the Imperium subsidizes these facilities out of the
Navy budget with nearly no return.  So in the tighter budgets of the
Fifth Frontier War, the Navy issued an ultimatum:  no more subsidies
until they build something we can use!
 
      The Scout service however, does use the lesser starports to a
large extent.
 
Without the Navy subsidy, the Scout service would suffer.  A
specification was issued for a craft that could easily be built that
could find a good market.
 
      The specification was almost totally forgotten.  No one had any
clear ideas on what to design, and the plan was nearly abandoned. 
However, a young designer named Hloch finally pieced together what was
to become the now famous Viper escort fighter.
 
      Most merchant ships are unarmed, allowing the commerce raiding
of the Zhodani to badly maul the Imperial commercial fleets.  But
arming a ship is an expensive proposition, and then it still comes
down
to the merchant ship coming under fire.  The idea was put forward to
build a fighter that could easily be carried on a merchantman, carry
the fight away from the ship and allow it to get through undamaged. 
Thus the tiny fighter was born.  Designed to fit inside an Air/Raft
bay, the Viper could be carried by almost all ships.
 
      Yet, Hloch did more than just come up with the Viper concept, he
made it work.  He turned a vague specification into one of the best
fighters of its class the Imperium has had for centuries.  Before he
even touched the draft computer he went out and interviewed combat
veteran pilots and ground crews asking, `What do you want in a
fighter?\' and, `How can you improve maintenance?\'
      Pilot\'s have said, `The guy who designed the Viper had wings!\'
and it is true.  Hloch is an Ael Yael from Jayelya, an avian race of
far better flying ability than the Droyne.  Millions of years have
evolved the avionics in his head, and as a designer of space craft, it
shows.
 
                                Cockpit Design
      Advanced fighter are by their very nature extremely complex
machines.  The complexity of their systems place a heavy load on the
pilot, limiting the amount of time the pilot has to concentrate on
situational awareness.  Thus, a key problem in designing a fighter is
the Pilot/Machine interface.  The pilot must have critical information
available without getting swamped in data.  The less time the pilot
has
to scan panels, the more time he can devote to tactical operations.
 
      Often times, cockpit designs swamp the pilot:  the Rampart
(Rebellion Source book), the Iramda, the Magnum, the Sourz, and the
FS-15 all have vast arrays of holodynamic link panels.  The ratio of
panels per pilot is as low as ten to one in the FS-15 to as much as
eighty three to one in the Sourz.
 
      The Viper cockpit is streamlined in this regard by using two
Heads Up Displays (HUD).  One is devoted to sensors, weaponry and
navigation:  the Attack HUD, while the other displays system status: 
the System HUD.  The System HUD is mounted to the right of the
centrally mounted Attack HUD.
 
      The flight controls are designed around the Hands On Throttle
And
Stick (HOTAS) philosophy.  This enables the pilot to control the
combat
and attack phases of flight without taking his hands off the controls.

The HOTAS system is extremely necessary in the tech level nine Viper,
where the pilot is without inertial compensators and would has
difficulty in moving about the cockpit during manuevers.
 
      Also included in the software of the computers is a voice
command
and response system.  Great pains were gone through so that the
computer could understand both the meaning and urgency of spoken
commands, including the use of sudden vague expletives.  It is also
able to synthesize correct responses.
      Another consideration that has been added to the cockpit is its
comfort so as to minimize pilot fatigue.  Twenty four hours in a
cockpit will erode the performance of any pilot.  Therefore,
provisions
have been made in seating and flight control positions for a wide
variety of pilot sizes and anatomies.  With minor adjustments, the
seat
and instrument panels can be configured for pilots ranging in size
from
Droyne to Aslan.  As the chief designer is of a minor race he insisted
that the cockpit be suitable to as many races as possible.  This was
achieved with some degree of success in that the HOTAS system is built
to be operable by a minimum of a three fingered hand.  It feels
slightly less comfortable to the human hand than a specially designed
human grip but it is adjustable and can conform to the shape of the
operators hand.  (The design was actually optimized for the hands of
Humaniti and those of Ael Yael.)
 
      Of course there are limits to the design:  Hivers have found the
controls nearly unmanageable while Vegans have difficulty handling the
controls without complete inertial compensation.  Virushi cannot fit
inside the cockpit.  Racially customized designs are not unknown. 
However, no allowance for K\'Kree anatomy was made because it was
decided there would be no market for anything as small as a Viper in
the Two Thousand Worlds.
 
      It is interesting to note that the Viper has earned a healthy
respect along the borders of the Two Thousand Worlds being the "Natter
G\'naak" or "Winged Carnivore".  The nickname has caused some amusement
to the carnivorous avian chief designer.
 
      The HUDs use color graphics to display information.  The colors
used can be adjusted to the optimum wavelength response curve of the
pilot\'s eyes depending upon what the pilot\'s race considers to be the
visible spectrum. 
 
      The Viper also makes use of one item not used by any other space
craft.  It carries a rocket ejection pod.  The cockpit is not only the
most comfortable and easy to use, it is the safest of any fighter
craft
used by the Imperium.

For the record, Jaeyelya is located at Gushemege 0437.  I found this in
DGP\'s sector files.  The homeworlds of some of the other minor races can
be found in these files, too.

                                  Maintenance
      A typical complaint from ground crews of fighter craft is that
ships equipment typically fills every last cubic centimeter.  While
this is economical in terms of materials, it is insane in terms of
repair.  In some fighter craft, the thrusters must be dismounted in
order to change the fuel filters on the power plant.
 
      The Viper, while compact as possible, manages to get around this
problem by having an oversized hull.  All systems are provided with
convenient access panels, indeed some of the panels are sufficient for
an engineer to crawl inside the hull.  Try doing that on a Rampart!
 
      There are some drawbacks to the tiny fighters design.  The
requirement to make the fighter as small as possible as cheap as
possible led to the decisison to cut back on the backup systems. 
Typically, spacecraft carry three identical computers.  However the
Viper carries one main computer and two 0/bis computers as backups. 
The fighter is fully flyable on backup systems for most combat
missions, but it loses much of its combat effectiveness against
spacecraft.  A further complaint is by the ordainance crews.  As the
three ton Viper normally operates out of four ton Air/Raft bays, there
is not a great deal of room to crawl over the hull arming the hard
points.  This is especially true with the Navy standard load of three
multiple missile racks putting a total of eighteen anti-spacecraft
missiles on the hull.
 
      All systems are compatible and interchangeable.  A Tech level
nine fusion plant can easily replace up to a tech level eleven one
with
no adverse effects to performance while the anti-grav drive units on
all models are fully interchangable.  The systems were carefully
designed so that a fighter could be repaired at any starport
regardless
of tech level.
 
      This has made it popular with the services as it is not
necessary
to haul a fighter all the way to a tech fifteen planet to get it
repaired.
 
                                Service History
      When first unveiled to the service brass, the fighter was looked
on as useless.  The Navy looked at it and appraised it as a lightly
armed Air/Raft of no value whatsoever to their mission which at the
time was to destroy the Zhodani Fleet.
 
      For once, bureaucracy did the right thing, credits had already
been outlaid for the project, so with reputations on the line the
project was put forward despite Naval opposition.
 
      The Scouts swallowed it whole:  a light, fast craft capable of
being carried aboard a scout ship, repairable at so many of the lower
tech level planets where scout bases are.  The Scouts had good success
the with the tiny fighter, but the performance was discounted by the
Navy as irrelevant because the Scouts were using it in missions
specific to Scout operations. 
 
      The Navy reluctantly used the Vipers as trainers.  The Fifth
Frontier War created a heavy demand for trained pilots.  Here was a
cheap ship that is easy to fly, so they used it for the training of
their Naval and Marine pilots. 
 
      This was the decision that put the fighter in history.  When the
pilots had been trained on Viper\'s and were assigned to fly Ramparts,
Magnums, and FS-15\'s they nearly mutinied.  The Viper was so much
preferred by pilots it eventually saw front line service.  The first
action where Navy Vipers played a part was at the relief of Yorbund on
083-1109.  Suddenly, the Navy changed its tune.  The Viper was
reappraised and it then became a front line Navy fighter.  The number
of Viper aces began to climb and soon the Ramparts were hard pressed
to keep their kill ratio close to that of the Viper.
 
      Once it was accepted by the Navy, the Marines made use of the
Viper\'s versatile hardpoints mounting everything from tech level six
iron bombs to tech level fifteen fusion guns mounted in pods. 
Probably
the most original use of the hard points was in the mounting of drop
capsules.  The Viper could easily dive bomb three marines on target. 
With drop capsules retained, it could also act as a extraction
vehicle. 
Many marines owe their lives to the tiny hypersonic medevac Viper.
 
      Quickly, COACC forces realized the ability of the Viper.  By
this
point in the War, nearly all the runways were pocked with craters. 
Suddenly, an space capable hypersonic VTOL looked very appealing and
indeed it is cheaper than some comparable fighters and requires less
maintenance.  Even the Army obtained a few Vipers as scout vehicles
for
the air cavalry.
 
      The Navy finally found a proper role to utilize the fighter. 
Vipers were put aboard merchant ships to act as escort fighters to
convoys thus lightening the demand on escort vessels usable elsewhere.

It is this role in which it is most commonly found.  Merchant ships
can
easily obtain a Viper, and considering that the agile Viper can keep
raiders at a distance from the slow merchantman it tends to keep
losses
down and is considered a fully viable alternative to arming the
hardpoints with turrets.
 
      With an admirable service history in the Fifth Frontier War, the
Viper managed to live down the initial impression of the brass,
becoming a valued part of the Imperial inventory.  Indeed, the opinion
of the fighter has swung around completely.  The Viper has become the
symbol of Naval strength to many in its role as the fighter of choice
for the Imperial Blue Angels Flight Demonstration Team.

Remarks:    The tech nine Viper is the most different from the series
in that it lacks the EMS systems, the inertial compensators and the

simply jump in.  Six G manuvers can be tiring and even dangerous if
one
does not know how to brace one\'s self properly.

system was observed to have a much slower half-life than an unobserved one,
the slowdown being proportional to the frequency of observation.

Actually, when I read the original posting I figured that it was in the

  Gryphon Grav Fighting Vehicle TL13
  
       The Gryphon is a general purpose grav fighting vehicle manufactured in 
  large quantities in the frontier regions of the Imperium.  A reliable design, 
  it was standard with the Imperial forces when they were equipped at TL13, and 
  the data package is now generally available.  With space rated armor and 
  computers, the Gryphon is capable of combat from a planetary surface out to 
  orbit, and can be launched from orbit for a planetary assault operation.
  Armament is laid out "over and under", with the pulse laser in a remote 
  turret on the upper surface of the vehicle, and the fusion gun in a turret on 
  the lower surface. The 2 5MW beam laser are mounted in side sponsons, and are 
  intended for antipersonnel use

  LSP Model 139 Combat Support Tanker TL13
  
       By tech level 13, almost all combat operations are performed by energy 
  weapon armed grav vehicles.  This makes the job of combat logistics support 
  much easier than at lower tech levels, because all that is needed during an 
  operation (and maybe not even then, given the high endurance of most fusion 
  powered vehicles) is food, fuel, and repair parts.  The tanker is intended to 
  refuel combat grav vehicles while moving, to reduce vulnerability to enemy 
  long range attacks as much as possible.  Almost all combat grav vehicles are 
  equipped with the necessary refueling probes.  The LSP Model 139 is equipped 
  with a capable sensor/communication suite to assist in coordinating the 
  refueling activities, and to enable the craft to avoid action as much as 
  possible.

  LSP Model 138 Combat Support Fuel Refiner TL13
  
       By tech level 13, almost all combat operations are performed by energy 
  weapon armed grav vehicles.  This makes the job of combat logistics support 
  much easier than at lower tech levels, because all that is needed during an 
  operation (and maybe not even then, given the high endurance of most fusion 
  powered vehicles) is food, fuel, and repair parts. While a planetary defender 
  is capable, at least in theory, of preparing caches of supplies prior to an 
  attack, an attacker has to be able to carry all required supplies.  To make 
  things easier, the combat support fuel refiner can process hydrogen out of 
  water where available at a rate of 142kl per hour, almost enough to fill a 
  Model 139 tanker.  Field commanders prefer to avoid this whenever possible, 
  because the fuel refiner is comparatively vulnerable in a high intensity 
  combat environment due to the requirement to stop while processing.  A vehi-
  cle large enough to carry the amount of water needed and process it on the 
  move was considered by most logisticians to be prohibitively large.  Again, 
  as a result of the limited onboard tankage, a tanker vehicle must be on hand 
  to receive the hydrogen as it is being processed. The LSP Model 13 is 
  equipped with a capable sensor/communication suite to assist in coordinating 
  the refueling activities, and to enable the craft to avoid action as much as

  Aramis Class Light Fleet Escort TL13
  
       The Aramis is designed to meet the Imperial Navy standard requirements 
  of Jump-4 and 4-G acceleration.  Named for worlds in the Spinward Marches, 
  there was a certain amount of public outcry from the planetary populations so 
  recognized when the class was unveiled, as many didn\'t think that having such 
  a small vessel named after their planet was much of an honor.  The Imperial 
  Navy still engages in limited production of Aramis class escorts at shipyards 
  on TL13 planets.  When active defenses such as meson screens and dampers (not 
  usually installed on vessels in this size class anyway) are not considered, 
  there is not much difference in performance between TL13 and TL15 vessels.  
  The model 7 computer set up on these vessels is sufficient to be superior to 
  that carried by most small raider and corsair vessels.  Thus, Aramis (and 
  similar) class vessels can be used to perform rear and low threat area escort 
  duties enabling more capable ships to be maintained in the front lines.

  Enkidu Class System Defense Boat TL16
  
       The Enkidu is typical of the system defense boats being constructed by 
  the high tech worlds at the Imperial core.  Comparatively lightly armored, 
  the Enkidu depends on its high agility and screens for defense.  Its high 
  output power plant can be run at reduced levels: maintaining acceleration 
  power and life support consumes about 51% of the total power, so endurance 
  could be extended to 53 days if no weapons power were used.

adventure, KNightfall, by Joe Fugate, published by GDW.  I thought that I
might as well put up an initial thumbnail review for those considering buying 
it.

  m   The cinematic nugget format is still a little strange to me.  It looks
like it ought to work, the main objection from me at the moment (please note:
At The Moment) is that the flow is too defined.  However, I can see where the
players would not necessarily know that, or feel that they are being manip-
ulated more than usual, by the time you overlay the usual random events on
top of the skeleton of the adventure.

     The background material is good...I definitely got the feel that I would
be able to describe what a planetary assault looked like with confidence,
and the "flavor" of the descriptive material was right.

     SPOILER WARNING:  I am about to discuss the great secret of the adventure.
If you don\'t want to know, abort the message here.

     I realize that the secret of the ancients has been common knowledge for a
while.  However, personally, I don\'t care for "artifact technology" games (even
though it is a subplot in my current game), and I\'m not sure I like the addition
of an even more Ancient race--the Primordials, to the stew.  However, that 
objection aside, what was there was handled adequately.  I thought the rogue
android to be a bit contrived, and I thought the reward a bit paltry, but like
the matter of the primordials, it\'s all taste.

Total product Rating: 6 out of 10.  I\'d probably still buy it if I\'d read
it first.

(Still 6 out of 10 is a lot better than Shattered SHips, which I\'d have to
rate as a 1.)

*********************************************************
 
      The Wolf class carrier operates in large squadrons, nessecary so
that the firepower of the Indianapolis interceptor can be brought to
bear.  Operating as such, they can often destroy much heavier ships. 
The cost of the ship however is much lower than heavier ships and this
allows the construction of vast fleets.
 
      Typical tactics used by Wolf packs are to hang way back out of
range of the opposition\'s guns.  The 10G+ capable Indianapolis
fighters
scream in and unleash their heavy missile loads from long range.  The
fighters never close with the target, instead using their superior
speed to break off back to the carrier to reload.  With enough
concentration, the fighters can overwhelm the defensive batteries
wearing down the largest of ships.  Even heavily armored ships will
eventually have the weapons scrubbed off their hulls, allowing more
heavily armed ships to close with the target to finish it off.
 
      Should the attackers manage to close on the carrier, the beam
laser would almost never be used.  A directive to all captains went
out
advising them to make use of emergency agility for the protection of
the carrier.  Indeed if the carrier were to come under fire it would
almost certainly jump rather than brave the fire, provided the
fighters
are aboard.  Basically the carriers rely on carrier tactics of the
pacific theater of WWII.
 
      The inexpensiveness of these ships (534.5 Mcr in quantity) is
their main attribute.  The say a battle ship costs 1 trillion Cr or a
cruiser 100 billion, (very conservative estimates) so a cruiser would
have to handle 1,870 fighters, and a battleship would have to handle
18,700 fighters each with a factor 6 missile battery.  Against armored
hulls maybe I can\'t kill, but I\'ll be damned if I won\'t shave the
weapons off you hull!
 
      In addition, on page 100 of refs manual you have the listed
damage for hull penetration by explosives.  Ok, assuming the missiles
do penetrate they cause 15 points damage; if they don\'t 1.5 right? 
Now, say only 1/2 actually connect with the hull. 1/2*1870 fighters*30
missiles*1.5=42075 hull damage points per battery round.  This will
put
47000 displacement tons of vessel out of action per shot.
 
      Admittedly, throwing several squadrons at a battle cruiser is
going to destroy quite a few fighters, But as the old line goes:    
 
"Where ever you send your subs and planes,
       you\'re bound to mark up lots of gains,
             and losses too, but what the hell!
The planes are just flown by young studs,
       and Lieutenant Commanders run the subs."

      Robert Dean (who\'s designs are first rate by the way!)
criticized
the above saying it had insufficient protection in the way of armor. 
Well, I must point out that it is not intended for long durations
outside the hull of it\'s mother ship.  The flight controls are not
linked with the computer (servoes w/gymbaled thrust of fusion rocket
for outside atmosphere) so computer damage would only affect
targetting
systems.  (Be reminded that while Pioneer 10, 11, and Voyager 1 and 2
have been out for years only one computer, (Voyager 2\'s) has been
damaged.  Also, Challenge 45 includes rules for micrometeoroid damage
P.37, 1/6 chance for a strike of penetration 8*1d6.  This is patently
stupid.  Consider the LDEF Long Duration Exposure Facility, 2 meteor
strikes in 2+ years!  In Earth\'s junk filled orbit no less!
 
      Admittedly, this doesn\'t cover possible radiation damage.  But
on the other hand I\'ve heard and seen things about cosmic radiation
that tell me that any armor is going to be useless.  (Cosmic radiation
detected in a covered system\'s optics in total darkness.)
 
      Supposedly, NASA considers the secondary radiation generated by
cosmic rays hitting an armored hull to be more deadly than the cosmic
radiation itself.  An interview I saw recommended having 2 habitats
one
armored and the other unarmored.  The armored section was supposed to
have a slightly dangerous radiation level inside it due to secondary
radiation.  It would be used when lower level radiation \'storms\'
passed
over the ship.
 
      If you like, you could use this to defend against the fighters: 
Hide the opposing fleet close to an asteroid belt or near a gas giants
rings.  But those hazards will affect those hiding too.  Even armor
won\'t stop an asteroid with orbital velocity, and ring systems are
quite well defined.

sent in one not quite up to his normal standards. Repeated below.

      This vehicle is capable of taking off from a size A planet with
a standard atmosphere.  For more advantageous conditions, fuel weight
can be traded for cargo weight.  Optimum takeoff weight of the vehicle
is 500 tons. Modular attachment fittings are provided.
 
      Think about it.  This thing weighs roughly two times as much as
a B-52 long range strategic bomber, and has an airframe smaller than
an F-4 Phantom II.  I am reminded of what they used to say about the
old B-26 Marauder:  \'The Flying Prostitute\' She has no visible means
of support.  Never get it off the ground.  Even the Space Shuttle
Orbiter only weighs 84.8 metric tons loaded.  In COACC an aircraft may
lift 35% of it\'s clean weight in cargo. 
 
      If you want something to fly it comes out that the aircraft
displacement volume is 3.3 (displacement tons) per metric ton.  And
that is a heavily loaded aircraft.  An aircraft weighing 500metric
tons, would displace at least 1600 displacement tons.
 
      I have checked out the displacement volume equations (against a
few jet aircraft)  The displacement figure calculated in COACC roughly
approximates a box capable of enclosing the aircraft with wings
unfolded.  Obviously, an aircraft\'s hull is going to be smaller than
this amount.
 
      If you want to design an space plane use COACC and build an
orbital hanger to store it in for protection.
 
      Otherwise you will end up digging your nose right in the dirt. 
The above design probably has a stall speed somewhere around MACH 1 if
that.  I wouldn\'t care to try to land it.  It would have the glide
angle of a crowbar.
 
      I include a possible substitute for use with the rest of his TL
8 space craft.  See the Orion TL8 Space Plane.

justification for building a couple of fission powered spacecraft.  While
I am flattered that people remember what I write,  I need to point out that 
that was a "quick fix" ruling, intended to make a particular class of vehicles
fit my conception of TL8 reality a little closer.  Before I started doing
cost/benefit analyses using those fuel consumption figures to decide whether
a starship should have a fission plant, I\'d want to be a little more sure of my
numbers.  (As soon as I get around to it, I\'ll get the fuel volume and refueling
rate for a nearby commercial nuclear powerplant from a friend of mine who works
there, and see what that works out to in kl/hour per megawatt of power output.

I also want to comment on the current nuclear damper controversy raging as a
result of Scott\'s post.  While I will not comment on the rationalization of
dampers in the game, I think there is a problem with using your damper to
increase the prodcution of your power plant.  I\'m originally a chemical engineer
by training, and that was a while ago, BUT, I suspect that if you intended a 
fission (or any other steam generating) plant to be a certain size, that is,
have a certain heat flux and boil a certain amount of water, operate at a fixed
pressure, etc...you could not easily "overload" it to prodcue more power.  This
means that if you really wanted to do that, you would need to have the plant
sized for the largest power output that you intended to squeeze out of it, and
run it at a lower efficeincy the rest of the time.  In game terms, you could
"burn your fuel faster" in a nuclear power plant, and thus carry less fuel for
a given power output (with correspondingly lower endurance).  I\'m not sure I
see the advantage of this.

Now, I said I wasn\'t going to comment on damper rationalization, but if you
really focussed a beam on a nuclear pile that caused extra neutrons to be shed
(which is *not* the same as normal radioactive decay for uranium...which decays
by alpha emission, I think) and more fissions to take place, the temeprature
in the pile would rise until it would eventually melt down...unless you shoved
the damper rods in to slow the reaction, which wouldn\'t help your power output.

Anyway, an innovative idea, but I don\'t think it will work.


PS  Fission power vs. Fission warheads: about 4% U235 vs. 95+% U235 if memory
serves me correctly.  You wouldn\'t have to completely destroy the U235 to
render a fission warhead unusable...just get it below 90(??)%.  (I don\'t
know the real crtitical limits, and if I did they\'d be classified.)

I have an idea. It\'s a BAD idea. Why? Because it\'s the kind of thing that
may well end up costing me many man-hours of time that could be spent on
physics, music, or sex. But hell, I put in my time at work, my studio\'s
not always where I\'m in the mood to be, and my wife is going to the South 
Pole for three months in about a week and a half and I won\'t see her again
until around Valentine\'s Day, so what the hell.

I wish to propose, to the TML, a truly sweeping bit of obnoxiousness that 
could get us all arrested on one trumped-up charge or another. I call it
"Gnu Traveller."

For those of you who aren\'t UNIX-heads, "Gnu" is a set of public-domain
programs, shells, and compilers designed by civically-minded hackers to
fix what they regard as the broken aspects of UNIX. Ideally, one should
be able to use Gnu on any UNIX machine, for free, and get more utility 
out of it. (And for those of you who ARE UNIX-heads, don\'t jump all over
me and send me copies of the Gnu Manifesto with annotations as to where
I got it all wrong-- I really don\'t care. It\'s a useful concept, and if
I made a mistake in the details, well, go misjump.) Anyone at all can 
write Gnu stuff, but it needs to be thoroughly checked for workability
before it\'s distributed, etc. 

It occurs to me that for those of us who aren\'t satisfied with the incredible
idiocies of the holes in the MegaTraveller rules, it might be worthwhile to
fix them ourselves, for free, and make them available to interested parties.
A sort of Gnu Traveller, you see? Rob Dean and Steven Kellogg have essentially
overrun the DGP 101 Vehicles book, and Rob and Dow Reider have made some much-
needed corrections and simplifications to the vehicle rules. Dow and I are
looking into replacing the utterly worthless and nonsensical trade and commerce
rules with better ones, and I\'m rolling up my sleeves (with the possible 
assistance of Dow and Paul Reilly, a General Relativist in my Trav group who
will probably join the TML soon) and fixing the glaring physics errors that
make so much of Traveller starship design difficult to swallow, without harming
the game balance too badly. (no Jump-7\'s folx) I\'m probably going to see if I
can talk Iain Fogg and Mark Cook into helping me redo the weapons skills system
in a convincing manner, and I\'d like to tackle the combat system at some point
and add a bunch more weapons to the canonical list....

The end result of all of this is going to be a parallel rules set that may
bear little resemblance to Traveller in places but will at least work in a
relatively consistent fashion. As all of physics is constrained within the
single rule, "Thou shalt not exceed c," we will constrain our rules in the
Miller Principle, "Thou shalt not allow news to go faster than Jump-6." It
may even turn out that the existing Traveller Universe will be no good for
the resulting rules, in which case (sigh) I\'ll just have to create a new
one. But hopefully the end result will be a rules set that one can use and
not feel vaguely cheated by in one respect or another. 

Keep in mind that this is not a going project yet! It\'s a proposal, to
organize and coordinate the work that other people are doing elsewhere
anyway. It may well be decided that people don\'t want to go to the extra
effort. Most people may like MT as it is; I certainly can make it work
in its current form. I may hand off the directorship of this idea to 
someone else. Or whatever. But I wanted feedback. Please post to the TML
if you\'d like to see a Gnu Traveller, and if so what rules you\'d like
to see fixed, whether you\'d be willing to write or help write new rules,
and whether or not you\'d be interested in a new Universe to run them in.
(Also, the Gnu people will probably get mad if we keep using that term,
so we could use a catchy title for this... GigaTraveller? Nah.)

Looking to see if anyone\'s interested,

I\'d like to add a few thoughts to Rob Dean\'s commentary on Knightfall.

First, let\'s get my major gripes out of the way-- the underlying premise

SPOILER WARNING!

of the game is just plain silly. "Oh, yeah, there was ANOTHER race BEFORE
the Ancients that made them look PITIFUL and they all died 600,000 years
ago...from boredom!" Literally. The rules state that the Primordials died
of boredom. And so can you, too, gentle reader. The flow of the game is
not open at all in critical junctures: at more than a half dozen points,
the possible scenaria squeeze together into a rigid set of events that MUST
occur if the adventure is to "work." I realize that this is true of most
if not all adventure modules, but I find the multiple-hourglass nature of
Knightfall to be a bit dizzying. "In Chapter 1, this and this and this
MUST happen. In Chapter 2, here\'s a whole bunch of random mini-scenarios
(most of them not terribly interesting) for people to putz around with. In
Chapter 3, though, you must get the players to here, so this and this and
this can happen. Then we have more random adventures...." And so on. There\'s
relatively little choice on the part of the players; I much prefer the 
Traveller Adventure, whose structure was much less predictable and whose 
bones were meatier. There are a number of areas in which the ref is told 
to fudge rolls; this is OK as a tactic when necessary, but should not be
an integral part of the adventure: it leaves the players feeling railroaded.

On a less sour note, there are some interesting points made in terms of
general campaign color, not all of which I agree with... the manufacture 
of TL11 Gauss weapons on a mining world where smuggling of TL12 guns would
have been better and cheaper. The attempted patching of the Trade and
Commerce system, which Dow Rieder and I are preparing to rebuild from 
scratch. The tremendously anti-Lucan, pro-Margaret slant of the story...
yes, Lucan\'s a scumbag. We KNOW Lucan\'s a scumbag! But I\'m sorry, folx,
as the Travellers\' Digest has made abundantly clear, Margaret\'s no Joan
of Arc either, and it bugs me that the players aren\'t given enough data
to make an informed decision. In any campaign I ran, the players would 
look at me en masse about 70% of the way through the module and say, "Oh,
come off it, Metlay. What are you trying to sell?" But your mileage may
vary: this is a great campaign for idealistic parties, and I may simply
suffer from an overly cynical bunch of players. (Nah.)

So do I consider this a wasted $10? NO! BY NO MEANS! I\'m the TML historian,
and I pride myself on knowing more about the Traveller Universe than just
about anyone outside of DGP or GDW (interesting, the order I chose to name
those two...Freudian slip), and Knightfall is a thick book, full of really
worthwhile information. In the old days, we paid $6 and were very happy to
get books with sector maps: well, here\'s another one, the Massilia sector
in all its glory with full world data! There\'s a ton of good background 
information on the politics and social structures of dozens of worlds, and 
hints at all sorts of nifty groundwork for a campaign in one of the more
dangerous and risky parts of the Imperium these days. Combine this with 
Trav Digest 11 (on the Geonee and more Massilia stuff) and you\'ve got the
strong basis for a good campaign. The artwork, unlike that of recent GDW
MT releases, is almost uniformly excellent, and there are a number of small
adventure bits that could be spliced out of Knightfall and used in any
campaign that needs a quick adventure in a hurry. So I give Knightfall a
dual rating: 

As an adventure:  Fairly Limiting
As a data module: Quite Worthwhile

Make your own choices, based on what your game needs. I consider it the
first truly worthwhile GDW MT book since the Rebellion sourcebook or
MAYBE the Referee\'s Companion. MAYBE.

If a black globe can absorb gravity and turn it into usable energy, does
this violate the law of conservation of energy?  How\'s this for a
perpetual motion machine: a craft fitted with a black globe, a laser,
and anything needed to control it.  The craft activates the globe,
absorbs the gravity, and rises.  (I assume the gravity can\'t be pulling
the craft down and be absorbed by the black globe at the same time.)  At
a given height, the craft deactivates the globe, falls, and discharges
the globe\'s capacitors via the laser, which is pointed at an energy
collection device on the ground.  (We\'re not talking about laser weapons
here! :-)  When the craft has fallen far enough, it activates the black
globe again and goes back up, absorbing energy again.  And so on.

Also, what happens to a piece of matter which hits a black globe?  Does
it bounce off, or get converted to usable energy too?  If it "bounces",
what happens to its kinetic energy?

     I wondered about this myself.  I first heard about Black Globes
when I first bought _High Guard_ about nine years ago.  I\'ve tried to
keep relatively current since.  ;-)  I\'ve never heard that a Black
Globe had any effect on gravity at all.  Electromagnetic energy and
physical projectiles, sure, but gravity?

 >Also, what happens to a piece of matter which hits a black globe?  Does
 >it bounce off, or get converted to usable energy too?  If it "bounces",
 >what happens to its kinetic energy?

     I always assumed that the Black Globe was modeled on the Langston
Field from Jerry Pournelle\'s Co-Dominium series.  It was black,
absorbed all electromagnetic energy that struck it and stopped fast
projectiles cold.  There are differences between the Langston field and
the Black Globe, though.  When the Langston Field had absorbed lots of
energy (from the lasers, nuclear explosions and other dangerous whatnot
of space combat), it would start to radiate it back out into space in
all directions (black body radiation, I assume).  If, however, it had
to absorb too much energy, it bled through to the ship inside the
field, and the whole shootin\' match blew up (sound familiar?).  Another
difference is that material objects *can* pass through the Langston
field, if they are moving slowly enough (very slowly--like molasses
running uphill in winter).  Also, the ship inside the field can poke
antennae and such through the field so that they can have a look around
(of course, once they\'re outside the field, the bad guys outside can
shoot them off--minor drawback).  Couldn\'t maneuver, though--they used
reaction drives, and it could ruin your day to have your exhaust trapped
inside the field with you.  :-)

     Okay, where has this taken us?  To the issue of material objects
(missiles, asteroids, planets, old beer cans, etc.) striking the
surface of a Black Globe, I hope.  I\'d say that, upon striking the
Globe, the object loses its kinetic energy to the Globe (relative to
the ship, of course), and stops.  It could then drift off, I suppose,
or have an entirely new vector applied to it by whatever way the ship
happened to be heading at the time.  In short, it "bounces off," in a
manner of speaking, having its original kinetic engergy absorbed by the
field, and then getting a brand new batch from the field.  This could
possibly be described as a conservation-violating collision.  Of
course, if you use a sufficient amount of handwaving, you can violate
physics all you want.  ;-)

  There is bound to be a very large number of fuel -10% hits, the big, bad

  4 700 tons, actually. The errata corrected all damage point figures. The
correct value is ten times more in every case.

  If the losses per mission crosses a limit, a surprisingly low limit (I\'m not
sure about the exact percentage as described in military litterature, but I
think it is in the 5-15% range, and that is a high estimate), the morale of the
unit will begin to plummet.

  How about manning them with robots? The might not be cheap, but they obey
orders without questioning, and without regards to the odds.

  I think there were a discussion about if black globes did block (or absorb)
gravitation or not on the TML this spring(?). I don\'t remember the result of
it, but IMHO there is several references in the books that would point in the
direction that black globes *dosen\'t* block or absorb gravitation.
 
possible (but quite unlikely) spoiler for Knightfall follows:
^L
  There is mention, in several places, most notably the \'Project Blackheart\' in
an old Digest, and the current Knightfall, about the tactic of jumping in-system
with the globes on and with a predetermined course and speed, drifting along,
presumably under the influence of local gravity in the system, and then lowering
the globe and surprise the enemy completely.

  Naturally, Both the Digest and Knightfall lies at home, so I can\'t be 100%
sure the they specifically mentioned that a black-globed ship will follow local
gravity even when the globe is up, but I think that they did.

another (but comparably very minor) spoiler for, and goof in, knightfall.
^L
  In one of the episodes where the characters are thrown in prison, there is
talk about the gravitic prison door that essentially is a field from floor to
ceiling in which the gravity changes from -6 to +6 gee once per second.

  According to traveller Q&A in the latest challenge, one have to install
gravplates in the entire ships volume because they are too inexact to be used in
just one part of the ship...
  ..but just one part of a cell is obviously ok :(

  The globe is described as an \'discontinuity in the fabric of space\', so I\'d
treat it as a solid, un-yielding wall with the additional refinement that it
absorbs kinetic energy on contact.
  But obviously it can only absorb the kinetic energy from the part of the 
impacting object that directly touch the globe (ie a very thin slice of the 
impacting object). The rest of the object would thus continue and expend it\'s
energy in deforming itself until it too are in direct contact with the globe.
  A fast enough object would thus go splat against the surface of a black globe.

PS. I borrowed Nivens \'The Moth in Gods Eye\' some months back, and the first 
    thing that struck me when I read about the defensive black field that 
    absorbed all energy that struck it but misbehaved when overloaded was:
    "BLACK GLOBE!!":)

Well, I think that by the rules of black globes that would be impossible,
You head down, turn on the globe, and continue to head down.  No manuevering
possible.  Lets see you suck a planet into the black globe.

Unless you head down, turn back up for a little to get upward acceleration,
and then turn it on, ignoring gravity and then float up....

Interesting. Actually, is the energy absorbed by the globe enough to power
the ship out of downward acceleration, or not.  If it is then your plan would
seem to work.  But then again, it is no more a perpetual motion device than
a hydro-electric power plant.

I think that it is a neat way of making energy, but still not comparable to
other methods.

How much energy, would it gain in the balck globe from gravity, light, heat,
etc.  I thought that most of that was ignored as negligible.  Is it?


Well, there\'s just my thoughts on it.

     I don\'t really want to take exception to Scott\'s discussion of the
premises of the game.  I agree that the rules for micrometeoroid damage
in Challenge 45 are silly, and I\'d personally never use them.  However,
the point I originally objected to in the Indianapolis series of designs
is not that they had insufficient armor in a "realistic" sense, but that
it is unbalancing to the game system to have different design standards
for atmospheric craft and spacecraft, and then to pit one against the other
in combat.  Of course something designed under the not very restrictive
COACC system is going to be more cost effective than a ship designed 
using the full rules, with an armor 40 hull and a triple computer 
system.

Well, I never claimed I was an airplane designer, and my only comment to
this is to repeat what I said above...It gets to be a problem when there
are two systems with massively incompatible design assumptions that are
expected to operate together in one game.  Personally, I think all the 
MT vehicles come out way too heavy, but it doesn\'t make much of a 
difference as long as everything is done using the same system.

I vote for Gnu Traveller.

I say GO FOR IT!  We all know Traveller has long suffered from many
obvious problems.  It\'s time they got fixed.

The one thing that upsets me the most about MegaTraveller is ship (and
vehicle) design.  You need the errata in order to do anything reasonable
with them.  I\'ve seen several different sets of errata (some I have, some
I don\'t).  I don\'t have COACC but supposedly this makes it designing
aircraft more reasonable.

I\'m SICK AND TIRED of having to compile volumes of errata and supplements
in order to put together a reasonable picture.  I don\'t even bother trying
to design ships and vehicles under MegaTraveller anymore.  I either use the
old Traveller rules or, more likely, just wing it.

If you could give me ONE source of consistent vehicle rules, I\'d use them.

I agree that some of the skills (especially weapon skills) need rework.
The skill system could also use some finer granularity.

I\'d like to see the Traveller universe untouched, though.  I also would not
want the basic character attributes changed at all.  I\'d like to see the
basic character generation system kept around, although I wouldn\'t mind
alternate methods.  I WOULD like to correct the system so that ALL methods
of character generation are consistent.

(By the way, I think it should be called MetlaTraveller 8-)

I\'ve been working on a fix for justifying the volume-based maneuver drives...
It goes something like this:
	Maneuver drives (not grav thrusters) don\'t actually produce thrust
or force.  What they do is distort the local gravity field...not just play 
with it like lower tech grav, but actually forms a gravitational gradient
(volume of warped grav. volume is porportional to the maneuver drive
volume...) around/within the ship.  The \'thruster plates\' garbage can be
explained away thru pseudogobbldeygook 8-) .  The Inertial Compensators
take this field (which should be uneven, stronger closer to the drives...)
and even it out so that everything in the ship doesn\'t fall towards the
front 8-) .

Comments? Suggestions? Let\'s hear \'em, i\'d prefer not to have to junk the
current rules, even if they need revision (yay metlay).

I hate to sound like an old stick in the mud, but I have a suggestion to make
regarding the current influx of vehicle designs. I prefer reading the
discussions, but recently I have been having to wade through pages of vehicle
data in the digest to get to the discussions. I\'m not saying that the designs 
should not be sent in (I will use them myself one day) but I would like to 
suggest a new format: send in to the list a short description of the vehicles, 
history etc (that\'s the interesting part of the vehicle) and then send the bulk 
of the info, the detailed description, and all data, to be put in the FTP site 
or the mail archives. Anybody agree with me? If not I\'ll shutup!

Cheers

This message probably contains some spoilers for some characters.
I think however that they are necessary for the *players* to keep
a feel for what is happening, and to see the great role-playing
that is happening.  I tried really hard to not divulge anything
that was obviously private/confidential.  For those cases I let
slip, let your characters believe that your conversation got
overheard, or someone just figured it out.  Great deduction is
not beyond the ken of anyone here.  :-)

In order to get things re-coordinated, re-establish a consistent
time line, and generally improve what\'s happening, I took several
liberties.  Some of them might involve your character, and for this
I apologize.  I tried to be as "in character" as I could, but some
things I felt I just had to be a little heavy-handed about.


Sorry this is so long.  However there are lots of things happening.
Even though your character is not affected by all that is happening 
he/she very soon will be.  I suggest you read all the messages, and 
if necessary, tell your character to go to sleep.

Keep playing!

hours ago sir.  Looks like they refuelled here and jumped into empty
space.  The sensors show a 3 parsec jump, only there\'s nothing at all
where they are going."

an extremely faint, and very precise intensity fluctuation.  Only--
the star is not a pulsar, doesn\'t even have the right makeup for a
variable star.  It could only mean something is periodically occluding
it."

"What about locally?"

"Absolutely nothing could sir.  We\'re on the outermost planet of this

nothing there either - even the neutrino flux and densitomiters that

Chapter 1:  Aboard the ISR Anslinger

In empty space (there sure is a lot of that) three ships wait, 
drifting, cloaked, using only reserve power.  Only a new scout ship, 
with a sensor savant, gliding right next to these ships would note 
their presence.  Periodically, the smallest ship uncloaks for a few
moments and checks for  incoming traffic.

The largest ship carries frozen deuterium in huge, icy balls.  It 
has five,  strung out one after the other like pearls in a reinforced 
steel cage.  Aft of the "snowballs" are two bulbous aneurisms where 
mighty hydrogen snow once stood.

The third ship is medium sized.  The ISR (Imperial Ship\'s Registry)
Anslinger is a troop transport.  Couple of hundred medium berths.
The Anslinger carries the most precious cargo for this mission to
R-alpha, people.  This morning they are gathering in a local rec
area, getitng acquainted and trying to work off the jitters of
their new assignment.  Most of them don\'t even know for sure why 
they are here--yet.

    <sorry if I missed a couple of you, I was seriously
     overloaded :-(>

Howdy, Slide. My name is (Judge) Richard Jett, nice to meet you. I expect
that we will be busy enough once aboard the Alcyon, so let\'s take this
opportunity to get acquainted.


Dan turns away from the window, as he overhears Slide and Richard
introduce each other.  His long black hair has been tied back into
a pony tail, and he is wearing his old ISS ship coveralls.

	"A Judge? What do we need a judge for for? I assumed this
    was a scientific expedition.  Are you planning to hold court on
    ship?"


"I do hold a commission from his grace the Archduke of Deneb as an Imperial
 Circuit judge, but I am here as the official representative of Turnskaad,
 the backers of this expedition. They want their rights fully protected, as
 well as have someone keep an eye on all this expensive equipment that they
 have entrusted to Commander Ger and his teams. Just the Alcyon alone is
 worth a substantial sum."


Slide:  "It\'s a pleasure, Judge."

Turning to the Scout....

"Hi. I\'m Wrinkley, Slide Wrinkely." [extends his hand]
"[Eyeing off his service patches] Where did you serve? I spent quite a
few years in Deneb and the Marches. Not IISS mind you, the Navy."

To the scout and the judge...

"How about we go find a drink, Judge\'s shout [winking]"

Dan shakes hands with Slide.  "Daniel Silvmane. I pulled duty down 
in the Trojan Reach. Survey work, and some maintenance work on 
Xboat stations. Not a bad life until they promoted me to a desk.
Navy huh?  Planning to join the transport team?"

Jett smiles. "Buy all the drinks you want, they\'re on Turnskaad. But if I
were you, I\'d wait until you were aboard the Alcyon and in jump again. If
you report for duty intoxicated, Admiral Nanadh Nggemen Ger will *not* be
pleased. Keep in mind that you don\'t get paid until AFTER you get back, so
you\'re encouraged to behave..."

"Yeh, Navy. Spent about 13 years with \'em. Had a minor problem with a
superior [derisively] officer, and was forced to muster out. Seems its
against regs to beat the crap out of the brass, regardless of how big
an arsehole they are. 

You\'re an engineer too? So am I. It sounds like we might be seeing a
bit of each other on the Alcyon. You got any idea what the mission is
all about? I just saw an ad for wrench monkeys and being a bit down on
my luck decided to apply for anything.

Now, how about that drink?"

"Yeah, I s`pose your right, Judge. You don\'t mind me calling you Judge
do you? If nobody has a better suggestion I might go rustle up a litre
or two of flem and practise saying the Admiral\'s name. Nanaaa...
Naadan... Danahd... Maybe if I try swallowing my tongue!"

"If you like, or you can just call me Richard. Not that I mind being called
 Judge. (grin) Now, now, be nice to the Admiral. Apparently he\'s just
 retired from the Darrian Navy; a rather impressive record from what I have
 heard. (pause) It *is* an interesting name, isn\'t it?"


Dan looks down the passenger area for the other passengers.  Seeing them
he walks over and introduces himself.  "Hi Daniel Silvmane." he says.

My name is Jordan Kalhoun Azani. 

Jordan is a rather tall and lithe person. He is a mix of different
races known on Terra. His father is Irish German, while his mother is of
Saudi descent. He has naturally tanned skin, appearing somewhat like
leather. He has cool grey eyes and black hair. He stands at about 6\'2"
and weighs about 185 lbs.

Much T. B. Dezired here.  Prefer to be called MT.  Born in a small rural 
town, suprised everyone by going to college.  After "fumbling" my way 
through 12 years, I joined the research team at the Univ. of Oreheer.  
After serving for 6 terms, I was "convinced" to go into early retirement.  
Sort of took the oppurtunity to "further the advancement of science" in 
my own labship.  You\'ll notice she\'s not here...

I would like to become a member of the Physical Science team.  My main 
interests lie in the discovering of new life/civilizations/artifacts/etc.


This unlikely crew spends the next few hours pretty much in the dark,
intellectually, about the Alcyon and her mission, their individual
parts in her mission and just when she\'ll arrive.

Dan passes the time reading technical manuals and generally being
gregarious.  Others simply sit and stare, work on their notes and
equipment and prepare to move home.

Presently, the lights dim twice, and some faceless voice indicates
that they are to prepare for departure.  Stars once again peep 
through the view screen and the Alcyon, highly magnified, comes
into view.

The Alcyon is a tetrahedron several hundred meters along each edge.
She flies with one pointed end forward, and a large engine exhaust
sticking out the opposite face.  Two scout ships and a merchant
ship ride at the other three vertices, and a central core of
somewhat inhabitable ship connects the bridge at the nose with
the engine/cargo compartment.  Most of the volume of Alcyon is
collapsible fuel balloons, now about half full.

As she nears, two figures crawl along the surface of the hull, 
apparantly inspecting it.  Shortly, two more figures and a small
sphere appear, tether themselves to the Alcyon, and move off
several hundred meters.


==================================================================

Chapter 2:  Alcyon in Hyperspace 

As the muster breaks up, Bhyarrvouf makes the rounds of the various Team
Leaders: first he speaks to Dr. Abuko and the Engineering team, then to
Lazer Farouk of Security, then Etienne de Mer of Transport, then to Dave
Sokoku and Mac Witfield of Physical Science and Generalisms. Lastly, he
walks over to Dr. van der Merwe, and salutes crisply.

"I\'m in your hands, Doctor. When do we begin?"

Doc drifts away toward a viewport, from which his Swiftsure-class scout is
visible. A perceptive observer sees Christian stare out into space and at his
ship. A fist clenches, his face tightens into a mask of mixed emotion. As
quickly as the memory arrives it recedes, leaving Christian to stare out into
space once again, his body relaxing. A regretful shake of the head, and he
heads off for his stateroom.



Turning, Bhyarrvouf accepts Blaine\'s congratulations with a nod. 
"Appreciate it, Zben.  But I can\'t say I was exactly LOOKING for this job; 
I got drafted, truth to tell.  Seems Fearless Leader was getting a little 
wired standing all the Command shifts himself!"  He laughs, and takes off 
his earclip and hands it to Blaine.  "Here you go.  I\'d like that retuned 
and given back before we dock with the transport; you\'ll find me on the 
Bridge."  

He then goes to an intercom, punches up the Engineering line, and says, 
"Bhyarrvouf here. I\'m going to canvass the crew for other people who\'re 
qualified to stand watch in the Drive Room.  As of now, we\'re hearing from 
Dr. Abuko, Kimball Redd, myself, Zben Blaine, and, hrr, oh, kakh, what\'s 
the name of that kid who thinks he can fly a gravbike-- oh, yeah, Severin!  
Anyway, Frieder should be semi-awake any day now, but I haven\'t seen chop 
nor haunch of Ralf. Is he around?"

The intercom comes alive.

 A groggy, gravely sounding Aaron haut Frieder\'s voice is nearly reconizable.
"Ohhhhhh, my heaaadddd!!!.....  Now I know why I HATE the morning after
 a party....  Heading down to see the Doc for hangover pills, I\'ll attempt
 to pull myself through the results of the party.  After the pill takes
 effect, I report to engineering for assignment."


The engineering contingent heads off down the passageway toward (of course)
engineering.  They are deeply involved in a discussion.

"How about determining what it is for, finding all the other probable
beacons and see if there is any way we can take control of them. I bet that
those who placed them here will be surprised if they suddenly stop transmitting
at a, for us, suitable moment?"
   <Johann Abuko>

I agree that we should find all of the other beacons.  I strongly disagree 
about waiting for a \'suitable moment\' to shut it down.  Unless we can discover
who planted the things (and there could easily be more than one party 
responsible), we CAN\'T know when a \'suitable moment\' has arrived.  The buggers
[probably varelse for those of you who have read \'Speaker for the Dead\'] may
have long since learned what they wanted to know and ceased to listen in on us
by the time we decide a \'suitable moment\' has arrived.

Sorry to harp on this subject, but I feel strongly about it.
     <sorry - I lost the source>


"Mr. Farouk, Mr. Jonson: This is Bhyarrvouf. I want one of you to supervise
Mr. Blaine from Engineering as he takes our little stowaway apart and gets
some pertinent facts on who left it here and what it does. He\'s the best 
commo man we\'ve got-- and that means we can\'t afford to lose him. That\'s why
I\'d appreciate a Security man with Demolitions training supervising him, to
keep an eye open for boobytraps. I\'d also like Hammer to contact me, and show
me where the thing was found.... and I may ask one of you two gentlemen to pull
on a vacc suit and join me out on the hull for a little walk, later. Out."
     <vouf>

A few moments later, \'Vouf makes a long general announcement caling for
check ins, engineers, pilots, and all manner of plans.  He signs off:

"That is all. Have a spiffy day, and remember, 
 nobody ever died of a hangover."



As they make their way down the hall, they pass the Doctor and a pair of
medical robots carrying bodies to or from their cabins.  With the help of the
medical robots, he puts the comatose characters into metabolic stasis (i.e.
like a low berth, but not using a low berth cryogenic system) and hooks each
up with a monitor which sounds an alarm in the Aurora if their condition
begins to deteriorate.

As part of that process, he takes a complete scan as well as tissue and
fluid samples from each, for intensive analysis. After all the people are
taken care of, he and any assistants will scour the Alcyon and other ships,
taking air samples at various points and samples from the various fluid
dispensers, galley stores, and any private stashes used in the party.

When that is complete, Christian and his helpers will set down to the
task of analyzing the samples (thank God for computers!) and correlating
the results, looking for known pathogens and other common factors.


- - ----
Meanwhile, up forward on the bridge:

Etienne, to the best of my knowledge the transport will send over a shuttle
with the new crew. We present a kakh awful spectacle as it is, and until we
have a better idea of who survived last night\'s shindig I\'d rather not have
anyone leaving the ship. Stupid reasoning, perhaps, but the less splitting
of effort we can maintain before things start moving again, the better.

We cannot count on the Paladin for standard operations until Mr. Nayduz graces
us with his presence. Similarly, since DeAith is about to be unloaded with
severe absence sickness, we have a gaping hole there as well. In the meantime,
please reassign Mr. Schmud to where he might be more useful: I have decided to
follow Dr. van der Merwe\'s belief that the Aurora will run with him alone at
the controls under normal circumstances. I will see to emergency work on the
Aurora in the event it becomes necessary, as the regular Engineering crew is
busy enough with the Alcyon and the small craft.


The intercom comes to life again:

   "This is Bishop.  One of you clowns now owes the INN one thousand,
   one hundred and sixty three credits for fried \'bot components.  I\'ve
   finally got AGNIS functioning again.  I\'m not sure what got poured in
   thru the dorsal breather, but it smells like beer."  There\'s a pause,
   and then he continues, "I still haven\'t figured out how the culprit
   managed to get past the 360 degree holo-pickups, but I\'m beginning to
   suspect your tree-rat, Abuko.  Anyway, whoever did it, this had better
   not happen again."


Johann sounds somewhat amused when he calls Adrian on the commonet:

   "Sorry, Bit dosn\'t drink beer. If your bot had been disassembled and 
   spread over the ship tucked away in corners everywhere, it would have 
   been his style, but not pouring beer in the fan."

   "By the way, we didn\'t finish that interview, did we?"


Etienne continues:
  
Nishu and I will be on the bridge while we are rendezvousing.  I plan on having
all passive sensors operating at full.  Should I do the same with the active
ones?  It could easily be construed as a hostile move and I have no idea how
jumpy these people are going to be. 

Merde alors, but I hope these new people can be trusted.  We definitely need
them.



And back in engineering:

I\'m on my way, Zben. Be there in two shakes." 
   <shake shake>
"OK, what\'s the story?" says Bhyarrvouf, striding into the storeroom where
Blaine and Jonson are gingerly poking at the beacon. 

Blaine turns to him and says, "OK, here\'s the scoop, as I see it. This little
jewel was made way over in the Solomani sphere, and is quite sophisiticated.
It could easily cover an entire system, but thats about it. To get that power,
it had to lose something, and that was longevity. It had about two
transmissions worth of power, and is dead now. So, my assumpstion, and its
just that, is that someone used it to squib some data off just before we
jumped. I would suggest a thorough search, `cause if there\'s one of these,
there might be more. As far as the robot dissasembling it, hey, sure. As long
it has the dexterity, and I can observe (from a safe distance)."

Bhyarrvouf does something Blaine\'s never seen him do before: he grinds his 
teeth together. "Samshkakh knaervarrgh grrrrrrRRRRRRROURRRGH!" There\'s a loud 
*clang* as he punches a nearby bulkhead with an armored fist. "Too little, too 
late! Why the kakh tsakha wasn\'t this rustbucket searched BEFORE we jumped?!"

About this time, Dr. Abuko comes in, with Leadfoot following along obediently 
behind him. 

Vouf says, "Hello, Dr. Abuko. Told you I\'d be easy to find. What\'d you want to 
talk about?"
 
Abuko replies, "Not talk about, listen to. General curiosity about the
beacon/bug(?) that Zben is investigating. Didn\'t someone at the party
speculate that there would be something like this on our ship?"

"Yeah," \'Vouf mutters to himself. "I did."

"Besides, disassembly of electronic things is within the aegis of the
Enginering department," Abuko grins, peering at the beacon from a safe
distance.

"If you want to sit in, you\'re welcome to," \'Vouf sighs. "I just wanted to 
stop by to tell Thul that if that kakh Bishop comes by to film that thing, he 
can-- Oh, Thul will know what to do...." At that, Jonson looks up and grins
evilly around the mushy stub of cigar in his mouth.

"Blaine says it\'s a Solomani one-shot, and that it probably did a squirt right 
before we jumped," \'Vouf continues. "Solomani! Just what we need right now."


<subdued click>

Etienne here Thule.
  For right now we are going to have to leave your ship pilotless.  We just
don\'t have enough qualified people!  I will patch all data from your computer
into the Alcyon\'s main display so that at least Nishu and I can keep an eye on
things.  I don\'t expect any problems, and the Talisman certainly shouldn\'t be
separating from the Alcyon but I didn\'t want you to worry when no pilot shows
up at reentry into normal space.

\'voir


"I\'ll agree with you on that one, Etienne," \'Vouf sighs. "What with that damn
beacon...KAE!" His voice goes up a half octave. "Etienne! Has anyone gotten
any sort of trustworthy ID on those ships we\'re meeting? How do we know we\'re
not bringing a prize crew aboard?" He calms down a bit. "I\'m jumping at
shadows. More of this and we\'ll all be at each others\' throats! Think think 
think... data squirt before we jump, but rendezvous already in place for our
arrival. Possible? Unlikely. I think we\'re OK, but just to be on the safe
side I think we should take security precautions.... lemme talk to the Count
about that. I won\'t waste your time any longer. Tell Jonson we\'re shy a pilot
for the Talisman as of now, but that may change soon. Gotta go. Bye." >click<


*SOLOMANI*   SHEEEIT!  I haven\'t had any of my favorite targets in
my sights in a LOONG time!   

They probably think that this ringworld we are headed for is some
ancient shrine of theirs or some other nonsense...


UH-OH!  Just had an AWFUL thought... you don\'t suppose they are at
the ringworld already do you?  Like maybe this is some secret base
of theirs?  I know this is a foolish sounding thought, BUT!  I have
run into crazier things in my career and playing my hunches has
kept me alive this long...

\'Vouf shrugs. "If they aren\'t, they aren\'t. If they are, they are. We can\'t go 
in any better prepared than we are now. No sense panicking until there\'s 
something REAL to panic about."

  "Uhuh" Johann does something of a grimace, "Guess we should have expected 
something like that with everything that goes on in the sectors around here.
Margaret and the Solomani are at eachothers throats all over the Hinterworlds,
They don\'t even bother to try to be discreete about it, media all over the place
have done long stories about the "Hinterwars".

  Wonder if there is any way to find out what the little sucker transmitted?"

Thul: "Why am I all of a sudden real suspicious of our pet newsie???"

\'Vouf laughs. "Bishop\'s a nosy bastard, but he\'s no spy. He doesn\'t smell 
right for it."

  Johann turns to Zben, "Is it connected to something or is it autonomus?
It would be very unplesant to discover that it has recorded conversations or
something aboard and retransmitted them..."

  "Something that also strikes me is that we have to be *very* sure that all
ships that claim to be from Turnskaad Enterprises that show up really *is*
from Turnskaad Enterprises."


Thul: "That\'s for damn sure!"

     "Well, I have some good news and some bad news: 
      The good news is that we aren\'t being followed by 
      a Turnskaadian battleship."

     "Good! Eh, what was the bad news?"
     "It\'s a Solomani battleship..."



\'Vouf: "I\'ve got Etienne doublechecking the rendezvous ships. We can\'t let 
paranoia cripple us before we even get started. Let\'s not all start shooting
at shadows."

     Zben turns to Bhyarrvouf "`Vouf, would you know if anybody on
board has an Forensic skills? It\'s a long shot but finger prints, etc.
might be a help......."

\'Vouf sighs. "I\'ll look into it, but I\'ll bet that little dingus is clean
as a stiff shot of ghtranga. They\'re not that stupid."

He says to Thul, "Deal with Bishop when he gets here to film things, Thul,"
and Abuko and Blaine would SWEAR they see him wink. He leaves the room 
saying, "Dr. Abuko, if there\'s nothing else pressing on you, you and Leadfoot
might want to help or observe the operation. I\'ve got some other stuff to
check on; keep me or Count Ger posted. Preferably Count Ger."


     In the corridor, by the beacon, Zben turns to `Vouf to answer his
question.  "I don\'t see any obvious hard-links into the unit or jacks for
inputting. I\'ll check further, but my guess is it was self contained."



=================================================================
Chapter 4:  The Rendezvous


During the last few hours most of the rest of the crew has awakened.  
A few, however, have died mysteriously, and a couple are niether 
recovering nor worsening.   

The Alcyon returns to normal space on target.  (as described in the 
previous turn).  The docs prepare the patients for transport and 
put the dead ones on ice.  


<Please forgive this GM capriciousness.  I tried not to give away 
 anything that wouldn\'t have leaked anyway.>

Doc:  That\'s the story, sir.  Hammer is dead.  Nayduz is dead.  Horne
and Farouk have completely recovered.  Ian Thomas is almost ambulatory.
We don\'t know yet what caused this, but we are looking into it.

Ger:  "Just a moment."  Then, to the private channel - "Vouf, Thule, I
have Hammer\'s locker keys with me.  See me in my quarters now."

Shortly the others arrive.  "The good doctor was just expaining that
we have lost Hammer and Nayduz.  We will discuss in a few moments what
we want to do with the Paladin.  For now, here are Hammer\'s keys.  You
probably need to change the Armory locks.

"Doctor, thank you for the report.  You now need to get back to finding
out what killed them, and not all of us, and also whether the new
crewmwmbers are going to get it, too.  Dismissed."

As soon as he leaves, "Gentlemen, I haven\'t told anyone else, but I
also have areport from Dr. Morser.  Apparantly he IS the only sane one.
We were all asleep for five days.  The ship\'s logs all show us out of
it for that whole period, except Morser, who\'s out of it all the 
time anyway and never noticed.  So now you know, we really are 
coming out of hyperspace on time, no one jimmied the controls.

"\'Vouf, after we\'re back in hyperspace, and we\'ve de-loused (at least
electronically) everywhere, take a team and find out what\'s in the 
Paladin.

"That is all."
<end of GM-crap>


Zben and Thule prep for a complete hull search, and Adrian and JJ
prep for a photo-shoot of the rendezvous.

- - ----

Lazer, are you combat-zero-gee qualified? Beautiful! You\'re just the
man for the hull search. As a partner, I\'ll talk to Kimball Redd. He\'s
the guy who partnered with me on the shakedown check of the jump grid
before we left home: no one else knows the ship as well as he does, at
least on the outside. But do me a favor, OK? Keep an eye open for another
EVA team: JJ Horne is acting as lineman for Adrian Bishop, who\'s gotten
a flea in his fur about getting outdoors shots of the rendezvous....

Kimball Redd, please report to the main airlock and Mr. Farouk. I hate
to tell you this, Redd-man, but you\'re gonna have to search the hull
again, this time for stuff that shouldn\'t be there. OK?

\'vouf



"Dave, JJ? This is \'Vouf. Listen, your man Bishop wants to do an EVA to film 
the rendezvous. Should be a short, low-risk mission, but I won\'t let him go out
without a buddy to secure his tether and haul him back in if he gets into
trouble. You\'re his fellow Team members: would either or both of you have an
interest in going out with him? I\'d prefer Vacc Suit-0 at least, Vacc suit-1
or Zero-G Ops 0 even better. I\'d assign someone like Redd or Severin, but we\'re
bogged down in Engineering right now."


I have some experience with a VACC Suit, had to live in one on my last job.
Can\'t say I like them but do know which end is up. Tell me when this little
space walk is starting and I will be there.

JJ out.


[ON THE INTERCOM]

"Ah yes, this is Manfred Werner.  I am thinking that I could
 be of some small help in engineering.  I will be there shortly."



Bishop steps out of the fresher a few minutes later, dressed in the tailored
vacc suit, carrying the bubble helmet under one arm.  He reaches for a mesh
gear bag, from which he retieves a small handheld remote control unit.
Swinging the unit in the general direction of the deactivated AGNIS unit,
laying on the table, he presses a contact.  Several lights on AGNIS begin
to glow and the sphere slowly rights itself and floats off the table, coming
to a stop about 2 meters in the air.
    "AGNIS, slave mode one-alpha." commands Bishop.  The sphere obediently
falls in behind his left shoulder, trailing about a meter back.  Bishop
clips the hand control to his belt and then grabs the mesh bag and a gear
harness setting next to it.
    "Let\'s go find us some PLSS units, a grav-car, and an airlock, in
that order!" he grins.  Then he heads out the door and down the corridor
at a brisk gait, obviously expecting JJ to follow him.

      AGNIS is a basketball-sized sphere of dull black (plastic?
      metal? ceramic?) which floats silently, about 2 meters off 
      the deck, behind Bishop\'s left shoulder (unless he tells it
      to do otherwise).  It\'s surface bristles with holo-image and 
      audio pickups, plus 2 short, thick antennas which protrude ]
      like a pair of mismatched fingers, from the top, off to one 
      side.  Extending from the center of the underside is a snap-
      clip, which looks as though it\'s meant to carry something 
      additional.  AGNIS stands for \'Anti-Grav Network Imaging System\'.



JJ is dressed in a tailored VACC SUIT, that was issued when he signed on.
If fits his small wirery physique well, but he seems ill at ease in
the suit.
He is carrying his helmet and is chewing on a half-smoked, foul smelling
(even unlit) cheroot. When Bishop comes out of the Fresher he asks.

"Now let me get this straight, all I have to do is make sure that you
don\'t float away, right. I mean we ain\'t expectin\' any trouble are we
cuz if we are I will check out my SMG and we will do this thing right!
Ya see the last time I spent some time in one of these things I almost
got myself killed. I don\'t plan for that to happen again! BTW, you be
amazed at what a mining laser can do to a persons chest, anyway that is
another story. So when do we get this show on the road?"

With that he falls silent.



About 20 minutes after he broadcast his message, Doc Werner sees 
Adrian Bishop in a corridor.

"Oh ah yes.  Herr....  Um excuse me, could you kindly tell me where I 
 could find Herr Fritz in engineering?" 


Judging by Bishop\'s pace and Horne\'s hustle to keep up, they are obviously
men in a hurry.  Bishop is very fidgety, almost hyperactive in manner.

    "You mean Severin?" asks Bishop, "I think he\'s down in engineering."
He starts off down the corridor again, and then stops cold.

    "Oh, you mean, \'how do you get to engineering?\'", he says.  "OK, go
down this corridor until you get to grav-lift 12.  Take it down to deck
3 and head aft.  Turn right at corridor K and left at corridor 6.  Then
grab the first person you see and ask directions.  Gotta go!"  He spins
back around and trots off, with a somewhat irritated (by now, he\'s gotta
be :-)) Horne in hot pursuit.


Zben, near his cabin (on the Talisman) stops dead in his tracks, with a 
glazed expression that rapidly degenerates to a grimmace. Turning, he 
takes off at top speed toward the Alcyon\'s bridge, while hastily keying 
into the engineering channel...

     "JoHann?? I mean, Mr. Abuko? Zben Blaine, the village idiot here!
Something just dawned on me! Could you meet me on the bridge ASAP??
Yes, It may be Very Important! And if you see `Vouf, drag him along!"
     He keeps moving towrd the bridge, muttering to himself. If anyone
listens they hear him saying "...sheeeet, it wasn\'t tight....."


Adrian and JJ are almost run down by the mad rush of engineers.

"\'Vouf!  Waitamminit!" Bishop shouts.

\'Vouf catches himself up short at Bishop\'s yell, turns around in a whirl,
and straight-arms Bishop at arm\'s length before he can take ten steps.

"Adrian," he says in a dangerously quiet voice, "There isn\'t any emergency.
I\'m just in a hurry to get to the various other things I have to do before
I can get some sleep. If you want a newsworthy tidbit, here it is: we may
have a recording of what the beacon broadcast, picked up on our sensor
logs with the other space chatter. If that\'s the case and we can decode it,
we may know a bit more about our enemies before we arrive than we do now.

"All we DO know is that the beacon was a Solomani device. If you want a picture
of it before it\'s taken completely apart, get down to the examination room
as soon as you can; I\'ve told Thul Jonson to expect you. And if you ever
bring me up short like that for a news story when I\'m doing something 
really important....." He leans into Bishop\'s face, and Horne can just hear
his snarl. "I\'ll piddle on your leg."

And with that, he\'s off again, yelling over his shoulder to Horne, "Good luck
keeping up with him! I hope you\'re wearing armor-- he gets shot at a lot!"


Bishop watches \'Vouf hurry down the corridor, and then very pointedly looks
down at his foot.  He grits his teeth and says, "I just don\'t know HOW
he does it.  He KNOWS I\'d rather be shot."  Then he shudders.

Horne waits until Vouf gets out of ear shot.
 
"Testy little guy ain\'t he, Solomani huh... hmm can\'t trust em, any of em
not too fond of Vargr either course you can always depend on em to be
unpredictable" With that he chuckles to himself.

"Ah..., yah." Bishop agrees.  He pauses for a moment and frowns in thought.
"Hmmm.  You know, I think I smell a tree-rat in this mess."

"Well what is it to be outerspace or that beacon thing. You get shot at
alot, well maybe I should go get my SMG from security. I had to be a good
little boy and turn it in like they asked."

Bishop suddenly comes to a decision and heads towards the examination room.
"Co\'mon," he shouts, "Let\'s check out the bug before Thul sends it to bit
hell.  Space can wait.  It\'ll still be there when we get done."  As he
hustles down the corridor, he adds, "Don\'t worry about your SMG.  No one
has ever hit me yet!"  He makes absolutely no comment whatsoever about
previous companions during such incidents.



And, back on the bridge:

      Zben waits in the bridge for Johann and `Vouf to appear. When
 they do [assuming they do 8-|], he leads them to a (hopefully) quiet
 corner by the sensor suite.

  Johann arrives some half a minute after Vouf. "Sorry" he says, "I had to
put the bot back to work down in engineering. Now, what was it that you
wanted to talk about?"

     "Sorry for the rush call, but I just realized something that has
been stareing me in the face. That beacon BROADCAST a signal! It
wasn\'t a tight beam! Therefore our automated sensor recording system
Should have picked up something, even if it was timed to coincide with
one of our standard transmissions. Therefore, if we do a computer
check of those records, we MAY have a recording of the transmission,
and the exact time it took place. Now, I can\'t believe anyone is dim
enough to broadcast an unencoded message, but it could give us some
very interesting information. With your permission, I\'ll start a
search, although someone with better computer skills than mine might
be a help."
    With that he settles back with a small grin....(and a small gin)

(beer in the oven and gin on the bridge, what is this ship coming to???:-)

  Johann pauses to let this sink in.
  "Now that\'s what I call a lead! Good Work, Zben!" he grins, but then something
strikes him "I hope the computer saves the records this long, since we isn\'t at
R-alpha yet it might have been set to only remember a week of sensor data. Well,
its the best we have and it can\'t hurt to try it out."

"Blaine," \'Vouf says calmly, "You have just earned your pay for the week."
He turns to leave, saying over his shoulder, "You and Dr. Abuko can probably
find someone with the cyberskill to look at what you find; try Ralf, for a
start. Don\'t bother Redd; he\'s on EVA with Farouk looking for another bug.
I\'ll inform the Count." Without waiting for an answer, he\'s gone at a dead
run.

"I know my way around computers." Johann tells the rapidly dissappearing Vouf
over the comlink. (Why shout when you have equippment that can do it for you?)
"I\'ll help Zben. Besides, there\'s precious little else on engineering that I
*can* do..."

On the way out Vouf almost tramples Aaron haut Frieder who is on his way to 
the bridge.


Aaron Frieder: I arrive on the Bridge just in time to hear the 
conversation.  As \'Vouf runs out the door, with me dodging aside, I 
yell, "I\'ll take care of the computers.  You keep me informed of your 
progress.  Also, I plan to eventually take a look at the Beacon.  I 
have a few things to test out on the probe."  With that I head over to 
Zben to work with him on the computer.  "Don\'t worry, Zben.  I KNOW 
what I\'m doing."

Abuko: "I think there is enough people here to take care of the computers.
We\'d use our resources better if you\'d take a look at the beacon to find 
out what frequency it used so we don\'t have to go through one week of raw

Not distracted by the sudden re-emergence of high-intensity debugging,
Lazer and Kimball head on out the main airlock, with extra air, and start
their hull search.

Bishop and Horne arrive in engineering and find it virtually deserted.
Leadfoot, the robot informs them that the engineers took the "device"
with them to the bridge, and will probably dismantle it shortly after
the crew transfer is complete and refuelling is being done.  So the
two hustle on outside to record the rendezvous for posterity.

As they reach position, ISR Leviathan uncloaks.  Leviathan is what her
name implies.  She dwarfs Alcyon and blocks out a full eigth of the
sky.  A robot probe detaches from Leviathan with a leader.  Presently,
it docks with Alcyon and drags over a fuel hose.  Similarly, hoses
are dispatched to Anslinger and Frost, the Turnskaad scout.

Anslinger comes alongside and opens a large iris door for a hanger.
A shuttle moves out and docks with Alcyon.  After several minutes,
it returns to Anslinger, and the doors close.

Refuelling takes several hours.

The new crew is aboard, add them to your character/mail lists.

(best Madeline Kahn accent): "Well, it\'s about time!!" (those of you
who have seen the movie \'City Heat\' will no doubt recognize the quote.)
I\'ve been beating my head against a wall trying to differentiate freight

Well, I (for one) feel flattered at the offer, not to mention keenly
interested.  I accept.

Actually, as you may have guessed (based on earlier TML postings), my
weapon designs and overall combat system bear little resemblance to
standard MT.  I find that the RTG Cyberpunk "Friday Night Firefight"
comes closer to real life than any other combat system I\'ve seen  (Just
ask anybody who\'s been shot at and had to shoot back, then argue with
me about \'realism\'.)

Assuming that we constrain ourselves to the Jump-6 limit,  I can see no
reason why the existing Shattered Imperium wouldn\'t be amenable to almost
ANY rules re-write we\'d care to make.

> Please post to the TML if you\'d like to see a Gnu Traveller,

Definitely.

> and if so what rules you\'d like to see fixed,

Well, IN ADDITION to all the ones mentioned above, I\'d like to see a
re-write of the aircraft design rules in COACC.  Scott Kellogg has
already pointed out how ludicrous the aircraft displacement values are.

Also, the robot rules need to be re-written, or at least greatly enhanced.
In the sections under locomotion (for example), no mention is made of
top speed.  I also can\'t find any rules which detail how long a given
power supply will last, only how much power it puts out.

> whether you\'d be willing to write or help write new rules,

Absolutely.

> and whether or not you\'d be interested in a new Universe to run them in.

Well, only if it\'s as  rich and detailed as the current Shatterd Imperium.
I don\'t worry about rules too much (what I don\'t have, I can fudge), but
a detailed, internally-consistant history is a LOT of work!

How about TRAVELLER++.  :-)

I am interested, I have been thinking about doing the same thing for a while
now and didn\'t because it would be an awful lot of work.  If a group of us
got together and did it it might be possible.  Keeping things consistent
could prove interesting...

I\'d able willing to help with the starship design (which has become a little
bit of a speciality with me, mostly due to the design aid program which is
looking good and stable at the moment).  I\'m not very good at the physics
(and never have been) but I am quite good at analysing the effects of designs.
I am a statistics honours graduate among other things so analysing stuff is
one of the things that I\'m good at.  I would like a chance to fix the large
starship weapons systems (e.g. Disintegrator, Particle accelerator).  And, I
would happily make the starship design program conform to any new system
devised, though typing the data might take a longish while.  I was already
thinking seriously about filling in the holes in the existing tables so
everything becomes more like the communicator tables.

I\'d probably not be much good for handling the trade system except as an after
design analysis phase ---- I never got much past basic traveller\'s trade system.

As for modifying the weapon skills and such, I\'d be more of a hinderance than
a help.

As for anything else, I\'d be happy to try.

I was discussing the events leading up to the current state of the
Shattered Imperium with a new player yesterday. In particular, the
controversy surrounding Lucan and the murder of Varian. Official
documentation states that there was a security camera(s) in the Twin\'s
apartment, but that the recording medium (tape, holocyrstal, whatever)
was colocated with the camera (in other words, the monitoring equipment
was not directly linked to a central security station). The question
is, why not? On face value, the turmoil within the Imperium can be
traced back to this very important oversight; had there been adequate
security measures we would know who killed Varian, and the rebellion
may never had occurred. 

Thoughts, interpretations?

Iain.

In message (1694) metlay proposes GnuTraveller:

Great idea! Bloody marvellous in fact!

I\'m more than happy to get involved in a rationalisation/rewrite of the
whole of the combat system (if other people think it needs improving).
I also think that a team should try to revamp the character generation
system. For a start, doing things like having extended character
generation for all careers and races.

work on rewriting COACC and a lot of the other vehicle/ship design stuff.
I have a rework of COACC allready conceptually done (more or less... 8-)
and have some very detailed ideas for expansions of the current system for both
more utility and reality.  Metlay let me on the group 8-) so now i guess
it\'s sort of official...

Anyway, one thing that I told him and that I want to suggest to the rest of
you too: It\'s not that hard to sell GDW a good article or supplement section
these days.  If you REALLY want to make a difference, work with the online
group, but try to get GDW to make the rewrites/changes official...and pay
you for the privelege 8-)

A navy spokessophont today revealed that the publication \'Fighting Ships of
the Shattered Imperium\' has been determined to originate on Terra/Solomani Rim.
"It\'s bound to be an insidious Solomani plot to disrupt the Imperial Navy\'s
 acquisition programs. The navy is amazed that som many loyal citizens fell for
 it. After all, there is a statement on the back of the book that clearly 
 states that it was printed in an provice on Terra!"

I\'ve got a TON of questions.  (Well, a couple Kilos, at least :-)).

Starting with Part 5 "Freight and Cargo" (pg. 50), does the AVAILABLE
LOTS table apply to Freight, or Cargo, or do you use it once for each?
Also, how do you determine lot size for freight?  The note that refers
to "Lot Size" only mentions cargo.

Next comes the REAL mess: cargo cost.  As nearly as I can tell, the rules
which govern the determination of cargo cost (to the speculator) on pg. 53
MAKE NO ALLOWANCE FOR CARGO TYPE.  This means that a 100 Kl. lot of ferrous
metal ore costs the same as a 100 Kl. lot of electronic parts, which costs
the same as a 100 Kl. vehicle, which costs the same as 100 Kl. of TL-15
mud!  It\'s all based on volume (or weight), and modified by trade code,
tech level, and source world starport type.  What a crock of SH*T!  When
I saw the spec. cargo entries on pg. 13 of "Knightfall", my initial
reaction was, "Yah!  That\'s how it\'s suppose to look!"  Unfortunately,
you can\'t get there from here.

What\'s a ref to do?  (BTW, I need answers BEFORE the middle of next week.
Otherwise, James and Richard\'s new characters in my campaign may be standing

Gang, let\'s please stop calling it "Gnu" Traveller. I really do need
better suggestions as to a name, and only one person has suggested one
as of now: "Rebel Traveller" (which ain\'t bad, BTW). My Gnu-using friends
are jumping up and down on my case already, so let\'s change it quick. 

Why is a name so important? Because I\'ve been fielding enthusiastic letters
all day, and it looks like this thing is going to be a going concern very 
soon. But I am NOT set up to archive and redistribute material for this
venture, which will eventually be moving large files and possibly graphics
and charts as well; I need a volunteer to help with the grunt work. Must
be willing AND ABLE to collate, redistribute, store and format this stuff
we collect and edit into distributable form, for free. If no one volunteers,
then the New Traveller rules will not happen, because I just can\'t do them
myself. Keep those notices coming if you want to get involved, folks: I\'m
setting up a list of who wants to do what.

errata on them. Thus one could seperate the pages from the MT books

He mentoined that the manuscript that was sent to GDW was editied by them

    I have been reading the comments on redoing the weapons skills, and I
    have a point to bring up.  Does getting a skill with a weapon also give
    you the capability to perform maintainence on it?  If so, then you have
    to keep the skills seperated.  If not, then there should be a
    Gunsmith Cascade skill for the various types of weapons(archaic,
    revolvers, semi-autos, SMG\'s, MG\'s, Gauss, Laser, Plasma, Fusion,
    Neural, etc).  This is something that must be considered if GNU
    Traveller gets the go ahead.

    Also, I\'m in favor of GNU Traveller, and I\'m willing to help.

    'body' => 'I think the idea about GnuTraveller to be really keen.  I do however agree
(with whoever it was) that the character generation should be left alone.
I agree that more skills are needed and finer granularity of some skills.

A big thing that should be changed is the Trade and Commerce as well as
information of cargo shipping.  The players in my campaign acquired a ship
(bought a used ship at auction, but with stolen money) and decided to go into
the cargo carrying business, so that they could afford the incidentals:
bullets and hospital care.

The cargo carrying information in MegaT and 2300AD was really poor and there
was little information about running a ship.  I also did not see anything
on insurance, costs of operation, and furthermorem, what do you charge for
cargo.

So, I did some research and found a pretty good source on today\'s shipping:
all forms of shipping:land, air and sea.

Some of the information I found out:

Insurance rates are 6% of the purchase cost of the ship per year, and they
do not go down.  Insurance does not cover acts of war or piracy.  Insurance
can be bought for war and piracy but in some cases it could be 100% or even
more than the value of the purchase price of the ship.

Rate charges:  Charges are listed by the metric tonne.  BUT, and this is a
big but: It is "understood" that this really means either metric tonne or
cubic meter, whichever is greater.
   Charges are very often set by committee, a group of shippers decides
that the rate between New York City and London is 7 dollars per tonne.
This is based on an average number of days of travel, and is the same
regardless of the travel.

There is no set time for delivery, but since the carrier is not paid per
day it is in his best interests to get it there as fast as possible.

It is possible to rent a whole ship, and in that case the charges and
stipulations can be anything.  However, most often this is not the case
because cargos people want to send are generally not that big.


****
The person I asked is my father, who is now retired from the shipping
industry.

He is very happy to answer questions regarding shipping and has asked that
I send him my questions written down instead of asking him by voice when he is
paying for the phone bill.  I think he is also intrigued by the possiblities
of space shipping.

So, why don\'t y\'all send in your questions and I will compile them into a
letter and send them to him.  He is also familiar with dealing with customs
(and various types of customs officials around the world).

Subjects that could be asked (and I am trying to think of many myself)
are:
would a shipper ever buy a cargo to sell elsewhere, how risky is that?
mercantile exchanges (including the Baltic Exchange in London)...
who runs the loading and offloading of a ship (I think he mentioned that 
 carrier usually pays for it himself unless special arrangements have 
 been made)?
Any Trade or Commerce questions...
etc.

Of course , I realize that this is now and in the future anything could be
different, but it is a good basis to start with , and is a realistic system
to use.  What information I gleam from him , I use in my campaign.  Also, I
will try to remember to have him give it for both ships and airlines, as
well as trucks (if he has the time).

You can ask any question you want, including anything about illegal
activities (which might not get an answer, but who knows!  :)   ).
Unfortunately, he does not have a computer or net access so this will have
to be through the US Post office.

Go ahead and post them here, or you could send them directly to me, but
then probably I will get a few duplicates.  Also, some questions might
generate more questions from others.  I will probably mail the letter the
weekend after next, if not sooner.

This is an interesting possibility. But I think it should be secondary
to the main goal of fixing up the rules. Many GMs have their own
homebrewed campaign backgrounds anyway (though neat ideas are always
welcome). 

Hopefully, though, the rules will not be changed so much that the
"official" universe could not have happened. I think many will still
want the option of being able to use the NEW and IMPROVED rules with
"official" materials.

On another topic, what ever happened to the SYSGEN mailing list?

     I think the concept of Gnu Traveller is terrific.  I would be more 
than willing to contribute to the project in any way that I can.  I 
have a few concerns though.  Every role playing game is unique, not
because of the system of rules used but because of the background detail.
The flavor and soul of Traveller are its background and history as well
as its game system.  While rewriting the game system is a great idea it
can also destroy much of what it is about Traveller that attracted all
of us to it and to this list.  I think what we are proposing is a huge
project that I find very exciting.  There are numerous and obvious places
where Traveller needs to have its system patched or replaced but the
patches or replacements need to "fit" into traveller without massive 
restructuring of the other pieces.  I guess what I\'m saying is "if it
ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it".

     With that cautionary note firmly in place here is a partial list
(off the top of my head) of places that need to be looked at for possible
patching or replacement:

     1) Man-to-man combat (with and without weapons)
	I like combat systems that have a feel of realism but realism
	like in the movies.  Combat should be fast and furious. Players
	should be on the edge of their chairs not boredly looking up
	charts and tables.  The current system is interesting (using
	interrupts) but I\'m not sure I like it.

     2) Trade and Commerce
	I think this one is obvious.  Star Trek has an interesting
	system for dealing with this aspect of the game including 
	playing the stock market.

     3) Internal Consistency
	From the talk on the list, the vehicle design system suffers
	from this problem.  Does anything else?

     4) Physical Consistency
	While SF-RPG games by their very nature must violate "known"
	laws of physics, it is best if they are done as cleanly as
	possible.  The recent Black Globe discussions are an example
	of the problems of not thinking through the physical ramifications
	of a "high tech toy".

     And I am sure there are others.  Two areas that I like they way
they are are:
    
     1) Psionics
	Not very powerful or very abundant which can quickly turn a
	good SF game into a fantasy game with psionic-magic!  I
	know because I made this mistake once.  It was fun for awhile
	but...

     2) Character Generation
	The addition of some truely alien races would be nice (I have
	a couple that I could contribute if anyone is interested) but
	the basic system is fairly good.  This is a case of "it ain\'t
	broke".  Its not the best system I\'ve seen but there\'s really
	nothing "wrong" with it.

     Anyway, these are just my humble thoughts on things.  As I said 
earlier, I am very excited about Gnu Traveller and would be happy to
aid in any way possible.

In my system the answer is yes, a weapons skill includes the

accordance with current military training. It\'s the PCs
problem if they forget to actually do the said maintenance...

  Marcus Antonius class Attack Transport TL13
  
       The first Marcus Antonius  was constructed for a specialized mercenary 
  company.  Able to simultaneously drop a full platoon of jump troops, and 
  retrieve them when their operation was completed, the vessel was used pri-
  marily for commando type raids.  The cargo capacity of 111 displacement tons
  allows over 200 spare drop capsules to be carried, so the ship can engage in 
  multiple drops while operating independently if necessary.

  Pegasus Armaments LTX TL9
  
       The Pegasus Armaments LTX (Light Tank Experimental) was designed in 
  response to a solicitation by the Parlek Corporation Security Department for 
  a low maintenance, low manpower light armored vehicle primarily for starport 
  security duties.  The Parlek Corporation\'s idea of what that might entail 
  included a specification that the main weapon was to be capable of penetrat-
  ing a typical unarmored starship hull.  Long range weaponry was not a major 
  requirement, and it was determined that a 16cm gun/mortar system would be 
  suitable.  The control and sensor systems are adequate to eliminate the need 
  for more than one operator. Four prototypes are still being evaluated.

I agree.  Please, don\'t take this the wrong way, I do think the designs are

I prefer this version of the Globe too.  It doesn\'t give the user an "ultimate"
defense as traveller\'s version does.  If and when I ever use them, I will allow
overloading them as in the CoDominium.  If you recall, in the MOTE universe you
have to concentrate lots of offense in one small area to overload it, then the
field-stored energy is radiated inward to the generator itself.

Since the field is 3-dimensional, it takes energy to create it and MORE energy
to create the \'hole\' in the middle for the ship to occupy (otherwise the field
would absorb the energy in the ship, and even in the crew\'s bodies).  Speaking
of which, I believe I recall a scene in MOTE where one of the crew works his
way through the field in order to look around.  It seems that when he came back
he was cold because the field had started to absorb the molecular energy of his
body.  Does anyone else remember this?  And does traveller\'s version allow
going through a Black Globe this way (albeit slowly)?

I think this is wrong.  sticking an antenna through won\'t do any good.
The field will just absorb the energy of the electrons coming through it.  I
believe they had to create a \'hole\' in the Field and point their sensors
through it (which, of course, took yet *more* power :) in order to look around.

A friend of mine came up w/ this idea (hi Tim  ;-), Since robots don\'t need
life support, it cuts down on size, weight and complexity of the fighters also.

It is.  I recall reading that primary cosmic rays, if they hit a person, would
go right through without affecting him at all.  It is the secondary, tertiary
and lower rays cascaded by the atmosphere that do damage to humans.  However,
not being a Physicist, I admit that I may be recalling this incorrectly.

Hi Folks,

It\'s been a while since I posted anything on this list, so I
thought I\'d share some random ramblings with the list and see what
I can get stirred up.


I have been long facinated with the mechanics of interstellar
economics and trade within the Traveller/MegaTraveller/Traveller++
framework.  Indeed, many of my characters that I have played out in
other campaigns have been Merchants trying to make a fortune buying
and selling stuff, carting freight, and other such.  Some of my
inspiration comes from history and study of the China Clippers and
the tea trade as well as the novel Tai Pan. 

A successfull Merchant could easily become a rather influential
person in both an economic sense and politically, legally and
illegallly.  But, I\'m getting off on a rabbit trail here...


I think we all agree that there are massive holes in the trade and
commerce rules of MegaTraveller, and the OT rules in book 2 are
somewhat lacking.  Other than that, I also feel that too much is
made of the influence of tech level on a planet\'s ability to trade
with other planets equitably.  There are a number of other factors
to be considered.

One factor that will always be a major influence in an economy\'s
ability to provide product for trade to other economies is the
uniqueness of that product.   For instance, in the China Clipper
trade, tea was a commodity that was only to be found in the
Orient.  Indeed, that was the major commodity in it\'s trade with
the rest of the world.   Bamboo and silks were second to that
commodity.

Another factor would be a percieved or real value.  For instance,
gems and jewels.   Sri Lankha continues to be a place to get good
quality gems in the modern world. 

The so called "Bannana Republics" provide produce to the US economy
on a grand scale.  We provide them with machinery and the like.

Keeping in mind the concept of trade here, how does one go about
paying for an economy\'s products?   The planet Balderdash-VII may
well have enough gold on the planet that it is considered fill rock
for paving projects. As a result that would be a poor choice of
basis of trade.  On the other hand the good people of
Balderdash-VII may have never seen tea before and consider it the
nectar of the gods and pay dearly for it.  

As a result of those differences in values between economies, I
would submit that in an interstellar trade community more barter is
done rather than exchange of hard currency.  Then again, I could be
all wet here.

Where is this text all leading?  I dunno!  I\'m just rambling!  :-) 

Keep in mind I am not a student of economics and such subjects
usually baffle/bore me.  However, for Traveller game reasons I am
trying to get a handle on it. 

I have been for some time trying to come up with a set of tables
that would be used in the generation of worlds for a Traveller
campaign that would allow a ref to figure out what a world\'s major
economic products are and what it looks for in return from other
worlds.  With such a system, setting up trade routes and fitting a
set of reasonable explainations for a planet\'s settlement would be
fairly easy.

Comments?

	Sounds like a reasonable explanation.  However, the problem isn\'t
how the drive works, but what it does.  Reactionless drive (by any means)
equals violation of conservation of energy.  There is no way around it - I
tried to find one, and was finally able to prove that it was impossible.
	I used to have a lot of trouble with traveller\'s rather cavalier
attitude towards physics, but I think an important distinction can be made.
Some of the physics violations are intentional, such as Jump drive,
reactionless
thrusters, etc.  These I am happy to accept as little black Physics
Nullifier (tm)
boxes attached to the relevant machinery, and are part of what makes the game
fun.  However, a lot of the problems seem to be unintentional, such as the fact
that you can get free energy out of a system consisting of TL15 fuel cells and
a fuel purification plant.  Those I want to fix - it will help make the
game more
consistent.
	Since some of the intentional violations will let you build perpetual
motion machines, etc, my favorite explanation for why they don\'t work is
a "nullifier interference field" generated by all those little black
boxes...:-)
	Have fun,

    'body' => '	I recently acquired Challenge 45, which has the "One Small Step" rules
for pre-gravatic space flight.  Overall, I think it is a very good
article.  However,
one of the drives listed, the Fusion Rocket, is an amazingly good drive,
even for
higher tech ships (I believe it was taken directly from COACC, which I do not
have, so I won\'t hold it\'s peculiarites against the writer of the article).

	The stats are as follows:
Thrust: 195 tons	Mass: 4 tons	Volume: 1 kl
Fuel: 0.005 kl/hour	Power Output: 3.9 MW
Cost: 350,000 credits

	In the description, it is noted as having an advantage over grav
thrusters, but it "loses its last tangible advantage" when manuver drive
thrusters are introduced at TL 11.  I disagree.  On the contrary, it can not
even be fully used until the introduction of inertial compensators at TL10
makes it possible to use the high accelerations it can generate without
crushing the crew and passengers of a ship.
	For ships without armor, it is far superior to the standard manuver
drive.  For example, assume a 100 ton ship that masses 1 ton per kl (total
mass 1350 tons) wishes to increase its max acceleration from 1G to 2G.
The standard method is to add 3 thruster units and ~12 kl of TL15
powerplant to power them.  This has the following stats:

Fuel needed	Volume(kl)	Mass(tons)	Cost(KCr)
0.108 kl/hr	52.5		129		4,500

A Fusion Rocket with a thrust of 1350 tons, enough to increase the max
acceleration from 1G to 2G, has these stats:

Fuel needed	Volume(kl)	Mass(tons)	Cost(KCr)
0.035 kl/hr	7		28		2,450

As you can see, it costs less, masses less, takes up less space, and is
cheaper to boot! Oh, yes - it produces 27 Mw of power too...
The only reason I can see to use thrusters on an unarmored ship is to
be able to land and take off without scorching the surroundings.  My
suggested solution is to retain a 1G standard drive, and get the rest
of the acceleration from the Fusion rockets.
	Fusion rockets also make it very easy to get acceleration
over 6G: you can get 20G easily, 30G with some work, and 40G if
you really want it.  This makes it possible to outrun missiles, let alone
system defense boats, patrol cruisers and navy ships.  Figuring out
the exact performance can be a pain though, because you can get
up to a significant fraction of c within a couple of weeks if you want.
I even was able to design a STL starship that could cover 300 parsecs
in less subjective time than a jump-6 ship.  Of course, ~1000 years
will have passed for the rest of the universe, but it might be a handy
way to get away from the Rebellion...:-)
	Alas, this drive has a physics nullifier box (its easy to miss -
its by the fuel intake :-)).  To get 195 tons thrust for an hour with
just 5 liters of reaction mass would require a exhaust velocity well
in excess of the speed of light.  A more reasonable fuel rate would
be ~0.5 kl/hour, I haven\'t worked out all the details yet.
	Finally, a merchant ship design that I modified to use the
fusion rockets:

Yes, about the vehicle designs ...
I admit that I\'m not going to be using the Vehicle designs
myself, I\'m in this game for the background stuff mostly.
As such, it\'s a shame to see so much bandwidth used in transmitting
them. However, it\'s not too difficult to skip past them
to get to other more interesting stuff.

Paul, I think that you can use MH on your machine - use that
to burst each message and then automatcially refile the vehicle
designs elsewhere - they all have a distinctive Subject: .

Other people - it\'s unlikely that you\'re using a pager that can\'t
search for text - usually using the / command. Just skip over
the stuff by searching for the next message - /From:

(Oh yes ... some of you use VMS ... errr ... not too sure about
that, been many years since I read mail on VMS. Perhaps someone
could suggest a method?)

Oh yes, people, can you make sure that the Subject: line is indicative
of what\'s in the messages? I don\'t have much time to spend reading
mail, and so I skip many articles based on their Subject: ...
Perhaps I miss the occasional worthwhile message, but it beats
reading reams of non-relevant (to me) stuff.

          I wonder if anyone might give me some hints on
prefab adventures, suitable for sessions about a day long.
I (and my players) don\'t have the time for Grand Campaigns,
but would like to get together once in a while and play a
little MT.

  If the adventures on the other hand are still small in size,
but can be set in a larger scheme, it would be preferable. This
means that I can keep a sense of coherence in the overall background
and still get away with one session a month... ;-)

  I have played the Annic Nova with them for a start. They liked
it, but most of all: I liked to GM it! It was an intrigueing
adventure, and gave excellent oppurtunities for good roleplaying,
as well as real problemsolving for the _players_ rather than the
_characters_ (Which is always a problem for the GM, as of which
you are probably already aware...)

  To rephrase my question: is there any adventures of the
same _kind_, ie. concerned mostly with rational thinking,
and deduction, rather than blasting the problems away. ;-)

  Thanks a lot!

belongs to the Free Software Foundation.  (Yup, it\'s true, Richard will get on
our asses -- I mean Richard S.)

(2) As for "physics problems": I have to laugh.  How, pray tell, do you justify
hand waving?  Look, the Jump Drive is necessary for the game to work, and if
you insist that all messages are carried by starship courier, then the game
works well and balance of play is preserved.  I\'m not sure why people are
flaming about Jump-7 ships.  As for the maneuver drives and such -- go ahead,
fix them if you must.  I\'m a physics major, I could probably do some
computations in my copious free time and see how plausible some of these things
are.

(3) I am very much in favor of making this system work with the currently
designed MegaTraveller universe.  I think the shattered Imperium is a great
setting for adventures, and I like the alien races that are covered by MT
supplements.

(4) I suggest that TDR be written using TeX or LaTeX, since these text
formatters are (a) free, (b) nearly universal [if you don\'t have TeX or LaTeX,
you can get one or both from a variety of ftp sites for almost any machine,
including your garden-variety PC], (c) EMACS has a TeX mode built in, (d) TeX
and LaTeX are particularly good at formatting publication-quality text and at
formatting any kind of tables and mathematical formulas, both of which are
copiously present in Traveller.  I would even be willing to take tables that
people typed in and "TeX-ify" them.  Since previewers are available for just
about any machine, you can run your TeX document through TeX and then run the
previewer to see how good or bad it looks.  Granted, we could also use
MacIntrash WYSIWYG word processors, but let\'s face it, this short-circuits a
lot of UN*X users who would be using their resources.  Besides, there is a TeX
package for the Mac called TeXtures.  It\'s quite good.  (It\'s not free, but
that\'s what happens when you have to majorly rewrite software to run under a
fascist operating system.)

Well, that\'s what I have to add to the discussion.  Now all we have to do is
get organized.

because there is a lot of interesting discussion and a large volume of
starship designs at the same time.  Traffic has been very high this week
(gee, THANKS metlay :-).  Naturally, messages get jumbled up and
disordered on their way to the TML.

What Carl Rigney proposed is this: all the messages that have starship
designs are sorted to the end of the digest.  What do you all think of
this? Unless there is outcry or a better idea, I am hoping to implement
this before the middle of next week.  Personally, I don\'t find the
complete designs offensive, as long as they are placed at the end.

I should be able to tell if a message contains designs, by seeing if it
contains most of the strings gauranteed to appear in a USP: "Accom" and
"Commo", etc.

One of the downfalls of this scheme is that the archive message numbers
may not appear in serial order, due to the grouping of ship designs to
the end.  Instead, there will be (in serial order) all non-design
messages followed by all design messages.

As for bursting digests, I looked at Ted Kim\'s digest burster earlier
today.  I realized that it is more complex than it needs to be, so I
came up with one of my own.  It works great on the new-style digests and
archive bundles.

It is written in C and assumes a Unix-like mail environment, so those of
you using other sorts of systems will still be out of luck.  Still, you
would have something to start from, and I would hope you\'d share the
results of your work.  It will be included in a later message to the TML
today.

One thing I would like to point out:

  Someone mentioned that they could not understand why it would cost 
different amounts of money to ship different material.  100 tonnes of feathers
as oppossed to 100 tonnes of machine parts.  Well, in my system, it would cost
more for the feathers, since they take up more volume.

  Example:  the macinery takes up 10 cubic metres, but the feathers take up 
1000 m^3.     At 5 Cr/tonne/ly in my game, the feathers would actually be
5000 CR/ly and the machine parts 500Cr/ly   .  I take the greater of volume or mass.

     My interpretation of this, and I don\'t have my rule book with me, is 
that you would be correct in assuming that you are to use it once for each,
cargo, and freight.  Determine lot size for freight using the same table.  
This brings up a comment I made months ago.  According to older versions of 
rules that used essentially that same lot size table, the lot sizes for major
and minor cargoes were 1d6*10 and 1d6*5, not 1d6+10 and 1d6+5.  Since the
latter means that a typical 600+ ton ship can only fill its hold at a Pop9+
world, heading for another Pop9+ world, I have been using the former system.

My suggestion for this is as follows.  I haven\'t got my rule book with me, so 
I\'m winging it on numbers.  Suppose we did this:  The TL9 grav spaceship
drives are functionally equivalent to the StdGrav of the smaller vehicles
table.  I\'d make the assumption that power consumption remains constant
per ton of thrust, but size and weight can be decreased in some sort of scale 
efficiency like the power plants.  This means that a Grav Maneuver unit
produces 650 tons of thrust for the 65MW of input power.  You could calculate
the minimum "economy of scale" size from the 1G drive for the 20 ton hull...
however many units that size takes up is where the crossover point for
advantageous size/weight would be.  Now, for a spacecraft of TL9-10, things
become very easy.  You merely calculate a thrust, same as always, and
divide by the LOADED weight of the vehicle to get an acceleration, same as
for any smaller grav vehicle.  If your thrust isn\'t equal to the local gravity
times your loaded weight, you can\'t land or take off from that planet.
Simple enough, right?

Thrusters would then work like this...they simply become improved grav units
that can work away from a gravity well by some double talk I don\'t want to
worry about right now.  The price you pay for this ability is increased power
consumption...70MW for what 65MW of grav would do. So 13.5 kl of thrusters
would weight 35 tons, consume 70MW and produce 650 tons of thrust not reduced
by distance from a planetary gravity well.  To keep everything consistent, you
can decree that the minimum size these things can be built at is the one that
corresponds to 1G for 20tons, and if you want to stick that (6kl??) unit
and the power to drive it in a 13.5kl vehicle, go ahead.  Multiply your
thruster units by 650 tons, divide by the LOADED weight of your vehicle and
you have your maximum acceleration.  If your thrust is less than your loaded
weight, you don\'t land on planets with standard gravity, and so forth...
Still simple enough, right?

If you actually do the calculations involved for a couple of examples of ships
with minimum armor, you\'ll find that the accelerations work out to be close to
the maneuver drive rating, which implies that that is how they were worked
out in the first place.

Anyway, that\'s a simple fix that will enable you to dispense with any really
bizarre explanations of why the drives were sized the way they are.

As far as inertial compensators go, I have always subscribed to the theory
that they are merely grav plates mounted in different directions, and tied in
somehow with the nav computer so as to provide a dynamic cancellation of
of the acceleration effects of the maneuver drive.  (e.g., if you have a
6-G maneuver drive burning full out at the tail, in normal physics, you will
be standing on the back wall at six times your normal weight.  If you have
1-G grav plates in the floor, you will feel a "gravity" that is the resultant
of the addition of the two vectors.  If you put six G grav plates at the nose,
that vector cancels the 6-G maneuver drive vector, leaving you with a
comfortable 1-G toward the floor.  Did everyone follow that without the 
diagrams?  )  This probably means that the power consumption of the 
compensators should be tied to the size of the maneuver drive, and should
usually be more than the power consumption of the grav plates.

AGILITY: A NEW SUBJECT

     Pursuant to the above discussions on maneuver drives and inertial
compensators, I\'d like to say a few words about the game\'s concept of agility.
To be brief, it\'s another crock of...spoiled butter.  The only use of agility
in the game is in combat, where it represents the difficulty of hitting the
ship with a weapon, and I\'d like to look at that for the moment.  Agility
is tied to the ship\'s mass, which is good...it represents the difficulty
of shoving it around in space, so that\'s rational.  It is calculate by
"dividing the excess energy by the UNLOADED weight of the ship etc.".  I\'d
prefer to see this based on the actual weight of the ship, which is usually
something between the loaded weight and the unloaded weight, unless you have
a cargo hold full of metal ingots...but that\'s not the problem. The first
problem is one of definition.  What is excess energy?  I\'ve always figured
that it was what was left after everything EXCEPT THE MANEUVER DRIVE was 
powered, since it seemed that agility should be a function of maneuver drive.
That being the case, I\'d also always assumed that there was a cap on the
energy used for agility equal to the maximum that your drive used.  (If your
drive consumes 65MW, I\'d hate to see what it looked like after you ran 2000MW
into it to increase your agility...if those 2000MW aren\'t going into your
maneuver drive, then you should be able to buy "agility increasers" of some
sort, but that is a can of worms I\'d rather not open just now.)

     The second problem is that, as far as I have ever been able to tell,
normal inertial physics are supposed to hold true in the Traveller universe
in everything not related to Jumping.. Right?  So the MT definition of 
agility as "ability to change your heading" is meaningless.  If I have a
ship with a movement vector ---->
like that, and I start up my maneuver drive <- like that, except at a small
angle, my vector, which is what people are using to guess where I\'m going, to 
put unfriendly laser beams etc in my path, is going to change very slowly.
Some nebulous ability to change my heading  (What, the direction my ship is
pointing??? If I rotate 180 degrees about my present course, I\'m still 
flying very fast tail first across the universe) is not going to prevent
somebody from predicting my course well enough to get a missile within 
intercept range.  

As a first approximation, I\'d say that your "agility" rating ought to be 
equal to your acceleration rating, as figured above where it depends on
mass, minus whatever loss of acceleration you have by shunting power to your
weapons instead of your engines, PERHAPS modified by some measure of your
rotational inertia if you want to be a completist (a spherical ship should
be able to rotate faster to bring the maneuver drive to a new heading than
a needle shaped ship.)

Now, all of this brings up another question regarding space combat...do energy
weapons actually aim for an enemy ship, or does the firing vessel attempt to
predict the location of the target, and then spray the beams around the 
estimated target locus in an attempt to get a random hit(s) by volume of fire?
In either case a "realistic fix" to the combat system should account for
speed of light lag on detectors (at a greater distance the future position
of the target becomes more uncertain as your data is more out of date) and the
relative speeds of the two vessels (again, adds more uncertainty to the 
location of the target.  The difference would be that in the first case, you
could gain something in defensive ability by using thrust of whatever source
to shove you from "side to side" along your base vector to throw off the 
enemy\'s prediction programs, or for that matter simply pulse your maneuver 
drive in random power levels at short intervals, (Say 1.5 to 2.0Gs in a 5 
second pattern--better have inertial compensators or the spacesickness will 
be fierce ;-)  ), but in the second case that would be less
effective, more like trying to dodge a shotgun blast after it has had time to 
spread. In either case, a missile that retains maneuver capability for the
final interception would be less affected by "small" movements on the part
of the target.  Missile hits, though, should possibly be strongly affected by
relative motion...if your missile is closing at 6-G with a high speed on a
vessel headed straight at it and also accelerating, it would have less
time to use it sensors and drive to effect the final interception, and would
therefore probably be more likely to miss.

HULL ARMOR, CONFIGURATION AND DAMAGE POINTS

     A few more ideas to think about for the vehicle system redesign.  As
Scott Kellogg pointed out, the results you get when you apply current 
technology to the spacecraft minimum armor requirement of "40" can be
ludicrous.  Why not do away with it entirely?  It would involve the following
changes to the overall game system.  The spaceship combat system is based
on the High Guard system, with the old armor levels 0-9+ being replaced by
the new armor levels 40--, with each old "1" equal to "3" new for combat 
effects.  At a minimum, it would need to be reconfigured with a new base 
value other than "40", at a maximum be replaced by something fully compatible
with whatever ground vehicle combat system is adopted.  An absolute minimum 
for spacecraft would still need to be established, whether it was based on
armor needed for radiation resistance, structural strength needed to withstand
the effects of the maneuver drive (in which case it could be a sliding scale...
if you wanted a "space only" craft with a max thrust of .005G, you wouldn\'t 
need much strength), or structural strength necessary to contain a 
one-atmosphere pressure of breathing gas, or some other measure...say heat
shielding minimum for reentry.  (\'Course grav vehicles can reenter very 
slowly--as long as it isn\'t against a planetary defense system.).

     As it stands now, an airframe configuration buys you maximum streamlining,
but we should also be able to set it up so that you can build a grav vehicle
using the new equivalent of the Vehicle Design Sequence to use dynamic lift
provided by wings or a lifting body hull.  If your 2G combat speeder had wings
to hold it up, it would be a 3G combat speeder...(Which reminds me obliquely,
that grav vehicle performance should really be recalculated based on local
gravity, just as aircraft performance should be recalculated based on gravity
and air density.< and composition, to be extremely technical>).  Naturally,
I expect this would cost more, but it wouldn\'t be that tough to add.  
Contrariwise, at low grav-available tech levels, it might be advantageous for 
some purposes to put in a grav module just large enough to hold up a craft, and
then use jet engines, or even propellers, for thrust.  Also, we should 
possibly consider setting things up so that streamlining has more of an effect
than being a top speed limiter.  If I push a brick with 10 lbs of thrusts,
it won\'t got as fast as a cone of equal weight pointed the right way. I think
this could be done simply enough by having a little table, no more complicated
than the ground pressure vs P/W to calculate off road speeds.

     I think vehicle damage should be based on something more than volume...I
realize that it was done that way for simplicity\'s sake, but perhaps a rating
based on unloaded mass would do better.  You need to calculate that number
anyway, and I think that it would be a more accurate "One number guess" of
the comparative damage capacities of, say, a hot air balloon and an M1 tank.

Enough for now.

tried it.

>From a mail program that lets you pipe to a program with a "|" command,

There have been some inquiries recently about the System Generation sublist.
I would like to recount a little history.  In early 1988, a USENET discussion
on system generation spawned a short-lived mailing list called the Universal
Simulation Mailing List (USML).  I was one of the co-originators of the
discussion.  The USML was an indirect ancestor of the Trav System Generation
sublist; some of the members were the same.  The Sysgen sublist also died out.

All of the USML archives are still on line and available via anonymous FTP.
There are some interesting discussions there, and also some programs.  These
archives, obviously, do not include the stuff related to the Sysgen sublist.
I don\'t know where/if that stuff is kept.  The USML archive is on a machine
called topgun.agps.lanl.gov.  Here is a listing of what was there last week.

with everyone who traces the origin of the black globe to Pournelle\'s Langston
Field (I think it showed up in a Pournelle book set in that universe prior to
the collaberation with Niven on Mote, but I could be wrong.)  

In any case, to refer to the current Travller black globe as "the ultimate
defense" when it will eventually overload and destroy your ship in a huge
explosion is, in my opinion, overstating the case a trifle.  Now if someone
who has the books handy can tell me how much energy the globe needs to be
overloaded on, say a 100,000ton ship with a Jump-4 drive (I think we still
use the jump drive as an energy sink even though the Starship Operators
Manual has disallowed jumping using the stored energy) we could make a
considered opinion.  

All I remember is that in High Guard, I never considered it worthwhile
because the addition to the armor class while flickering with any BG generator
you could build in the Imperium didn\'t seem to be worth the possibility of
being blown to atoms by the overload.  This leaves out the tactical surprise
considerations.  (And so without reanalyzing the situation, you won\'t find BGs
on my latest imperial navy design proposals.)

There should be a way to make it easier for you to skip what you do not
want to read.  If you do not like to wade through stuff in a digest,
read on. This is for you.

If you do not like some of the articles you should take advantage of the
new format of this mailing list.  I asked our Administrator

	[ traveller-request@metolius.wr.tek.com (James Perkins)]

to change the format of the digest so that people could skip (or in my
case save) special articles.  The new format separates every article
with a line starting with `--\'.  Any lines in articles that are
submitted with \'--\' starting lines have been changed to \'- -\' to
ensure that mail bursters can separate them properly.

With this change you will be able burst your digest into separate
articles.  Many mail readers know about this sort of thing. My mail
reader "msg", a part of MMDF, has a command \'@\' that bursts.  "MH"
(Mail Handler) also has a burst program.  You could even write a
program to burst a digest and mail the articles to your self, if
nothing else would work.

Good luck!	  And let the special interest groups keep
			their share of the TML.

I agree with this ONLY TO A POINT.  In the USMC, I was trained to fully
field-strip my M-16, so I could clean it and clear serious jams.  However,
if a component were to break, the best I could accomplish is to break down
the weapon, hopefuly locate the broken part, and then say, "Yup.  It\'s
busted."  I couldn\'t fix it unless I had another broken \'16 to scavenge
from.  This wasn\'t normally the case. :-)  Even then, replacing some of
the parts requires special tools not normally available on a battlefield.

Therefore, I\'d say that a specific weapons skill includes being able to
fieldstrip and clean your weapon, AND THAT\'S ALL.  If a component is
broken, you take the weapon to a \'gunsmith\' or, if you\'re in the service,
you have the company quartermaster replace it.

For high TL weapons, this gives fieldstripping a whole new meaning.  If
you\'re the squad heavy weapons operator (i.e. you carry a PGMP-15 while
everybody else carries laser rifles) then routine field maintenance probably
consists of daily barrel swaps, cleaning the weapon exterior, and checking
the connections from the powerpack to the weapon for damage and wear.
There is nothing to \'break down and clean\' otherwise.  For a laser, all
you may have to do is clean the exterior, polish the lens apurture, and
check that the power cable is undamaged.  And so on...

I agree with Gary\'s initial proposal that there should probably be a Gunsmith
(or, more generically, \'Weaponsmith\') Cascade skill for the various types of
weapons.  The catagories he suggests are:

> (archaic, revolvers, semi-autos, SMG\'s, MG\'s, Gauss, Laser, Plasma,
> Fusion, Neural, etc).

I think we could lump (revolvers, semi-autos, SMG\'s, MG\'s) into a single
catagory of (\'chemically-propelled slug-thrower\'), and combine (Plasma,
Fusion) into \'Heavy Energy Weapons\' (since they, too, work on the same
principle).

If we\'re really going to do this right, we should include design

I disagree with the idea of using TeX.  While it is free and powerful,
it is also cumbersome, hard to read and hard to learn.  (It does do

About weapons skills: a very simple way to break down firearms skills is 
by the last three entries in the stats for the weapon: signature, recoil,
and "difficulty as."  This gives us:

Med/Med/Handgun: All types of revolvers, auto pistol, body pistol, SMG.
Med/Low/Handgun: Both kinds of snub pistols.
Low/Low/Handgun: Gauss pistols.
Hi/Hi/Rifle: All sorts of hunting rifles.
Hi/Med/Rifle: Shotgun and autoshotgun.
Hi/Lo/Rifle: Assault Rocket Launcher.
Med/Hi/Rifle: Light Assault Gun.
Med/Med/Rifle: Carbines, Rifles, Autorifles, Assault Rifles, ACR\'s.
Lo/Med/Rifle: Accelerator Rifle.
Lo/Lo/Rifle: Gauss Rifles.
Energy weapons can be lumped into two groups based on recoil.

The method I actually use is to keep the "official" weapon skills, treating
the weapon actually picked for the skill as the weapon the player is most
familiar with.  If the player wishes to use another weapon in a firefight
(or has to out of necessity), I take his skill level in the other weapon,
apply any tech level modifiers to the new weapon, and then subtract one from
the skill for each factor by which the new weapon differs from the weapon
in which the player has the skill.  If the new weapon is primarily a single-
shot weapon and the weapon in which the player has the skill is automatic,
I subtract an additional skill level, and vice versa.  Switching from energy
weapons to slugthrowers (or vice versa) costs two, but in this case the
automatic vs. single-shot modifier doesn\'t apply.  Frequently, the skill
level will be modified to below zero; I keep the result if it\'s no worse
than -3 and use it as a modifier rather than just throwing it out and 
penalizing the player a difficulty level for having no skill at all.  If the
player has several gun combat skills, the one yielding the best result
applies.  I also let these modifiers apply to the character creation process;
if a player has Combat Rifleman-2 and gets a level of Shotgun skill, he can
take it as Shotgun-2 rather than Shotgun-1 since the Rifle part of Combat
Rifleman would give him a Shotgun skill of 1 already.

Re: newtonian violations...
	There\'s a neat explanation for how to get reactionless drives...
some work by one Robert L. Forward into negative matter shows that with
some negative-mass nearby you can move by interaction with the negative mass
but not using exhaust.  If you want to extrapolate those results into playing
with gravity i just bet that you can get away with reactionless drives.
	If anyone objects to the above i\'ll go pull Forwards paper and do it
the hard way 8-)

	Robert Dean thought that a straight thrust-based system would work 
better... I agree, but pose a question: is it worth introducing incompatability
if we have means to remain compatable ?


	Other problems (like the one mentioned above) need real fixes.

I\'d refer to the MT white globe as "the ultimate defense".  Getting one is

Tons of capacitors available = displacement of ship * jump no. * 0.5%
1 ton of capacitors stores 36 E.P.

I say scrap that part of the Starship Operator\'s Manual.  High Guard said
you could use stored energy for jumping, or anything else which needed
energy.  Which meant that when I used a black globe, I usually ran as
much as possible off the stored energy, to reduce the chances of an
overload.  The most important calculation every turn was how much energy
I\'d used, how much I\'d absorbed, and thus whether or not I could afford
to keep the globe on next turn.

The way I\'d handle this in game terms is, the weapons skill allows you
to strip and clean the weapon, and replace components with other parts
taken intact from another weapon or a spares store.  The nature of the
component would dictate the task difficulty level; e.g. replacing a
piece of the trigger mechanism is not as easy as replacing the barrel.

Making new parts from a piece of metal comes under Mechanical skill.
Again, the difficulty level depends on the component, but will probably
be quite high - we\'re talking about precision machinery here.

I don\'t know.  The trigger mechanism is now a switch, which could fail
and need to be replaced.  The power system probably has fuses, and can
also probably be dismantled into a few replaceable parts.  I\'d expect
the gun to be designed to be dismantled into a few standard parts, e.g.
beam generator, sight, stock, trigger switch assembly, power cable,
power generator, power regulator, fuses.  Going much beyond that would
require Mechanical and/or Electronic skills, and possibly Engineering.

        Black Globe generators were designed as an powerful defense system, the

        (1) At tech 15 when they are first introduced they are prototypes,
(Imperial Navy used an High Lighting Class ship to test one)... This gives next
possiblities for worrying players .. will the ship explode when it is turned
on, will it move to a different universe etc etc.
        (2) The Black Globe absorbs all forms of energy. It places a shield
around the ship and absorbs all forms of energy (as defined by Enstein) fired
at the ship. Also all forms of energy from the ship. This means means the ship
is part a of a nasty feedback loop as the ship provides the energy sinks for
the Globe, This means the Globe must flicker to remove the energy which is of a
form that is no good for anything on board. High Guard gives all the rules for
this (40% flicker rate remove 40% of the energy stored)
        (3) The tactical problem of use with the black globe is this. When the
Globe is turned on the ship can\'t fire, communicate or maneuver. The Ship
maintains it present direction and speed, so the opposite ship hjust predicates
the course of the target and fires when the ship drops its Globe to fire (or
maneuver). You may be invisable but this does not help if the target knows
where you were.
        The tactic suggested by High Guard was to enter the system with the
globe on and drift past the enemy and attack them from behind. (might work)

        Now my defense screen that I would is the personal white globe.

ANSI C complier only K&R. This is not a flame or a major gripe as most stuff
that complies on unix complies on my machine, (mine you some stuff I got would
complie on the unix machine I use). It is just a request that the author makes
it clear if the code uses any machine specific commands.

In my own defense, I wasn\'t really sure about the digest format when I

But I do miss one feature from my program: my program printed a

Waitasec.  I thought 100 tons referred to volume, as in equivalent
volume of 100 tons of liquid hydrogen.  The rest of the ship is
designed using volume-tons and this makes it easy to figure out
how much space you have left in your cargo hold.

Incidently, this is kinda like the way merchant ships plying the
oceans in the real world are measured--volume in tons of water.
Why?  Something to do with how much weight your ship can hold
before it sinks.

Of course, I can\'t think of any similar justification for using
liquid hydrogen volume-tons in Traveller.  Maybe if you wanted
to land your ship on a really cold gas (liquid) giant.

    As to the content, I commented that skill with a weapon not only give

    should also consider how this effects the groupings of the weapons. 
    The revolver or even pistol skill should not be grouped with a gauss
    pistol skill because a large part of the training is going to include
    maintainence, especially in the case of the gauss pistol.  The gauss
    pistol\'s maintainence regime is COMPLETELY different from maintainence
    on a pistol or a revolver.  You don\'t have to worry about deposits from
    explosive components, but you do have to worry about electrical
    connections, magnetic alignment and magnetic timing.

     One small quibble.  "Prototype" isn\'t the best word to use.  I
think that "copy" would be more accurate.  The device wasn\'t developed
by Imperial (or any other contemporary) technology.  To quote from page
31 of _High Guard_:

          "Black globe generators are not available commercially; they
     are recovered artifacts installed on a makeshift basis or
     experimental versions installed on tech level 15 Imperial
     warships."

     Also, the behavior of the field is fairly well known--it won\'t
explode or "move to a different universe."  *It* won\'t--the capacitors
that it\'s connected to are a slightly different matter.  They might
explode if you overload them.  I\'ve been playing Traveller for ten
years, and I\'ve never heard this "move to a different universe" rumor.
Where did it come from?

     Yes.  I don\'t know where Uncle Albert gets into this (I assume
you mean "Einstein" above), but that\'s what the black globe does.

 >Also all forms of energy from the ship.

     True, if someone on board the ship is stupid enough to fire a
weapon while the field is on.  However, since I\'m sure the Captain of a
globe-equipped ship would take a dim view of this sort of asinine
behavior, it\'s probably a rare occurrence.  ;-)

     Buzz!  Wrong answer.  Well, sort of wrong.  From page 42:

          "Since a black globe absorbs all energy, a ship with its field
     on is protected from all fire.  Unfortunately, the forcefield
     works in both directions; the ship may not fire, maneuver, or even
     see out.  These limitations would make the black globe of little
     value in battle if not for the ability of the field generator to
     flicker--switch the field on and off many times per second--giving
     the ship part-time protection while still allowing it to fire,
     maneuver, and track enemy ships during the "off" intervals.
     ...
          Energy striking a black globe screen is diverted to the ship\'s
     capacitors will hold 36 energy points.  When the screen is
     flickering, a percentage of the incoming energy equal to the
     flicker rate is absorbed."

when it comes to getting rid of the stored energy:

          "Stored energy may be removed from the capacitors by using
     it to power the ship.  Energy may only leave the ship, however, when
     the black globe is off (or during the off intervals of its flicker)."

     I always assumed that this meant using *any* system that used
energy:  weapons, drives, computer, etc.  If you have a large computer,
it *is* possible to get rid of a small amount of absorbed energy with
the field 100% on.  This assumes that the incoming energy is less than
or equal to the amount needed by internal systems.  On page 43, we have
the *really* fun sentence:

          "If a ship absorbs enough energy to make a jump, and is
     supplied with sufficient fuel, it may jump at the end of the turn."

     Of course, this can be dangerous.  If you overload your capacitors,
your ship is destroyed (by violently exploding capacitors, I guess).  I
imagine that it\'s not a very good idea if you only have your jump drive
capacitors available.

     Kids, these are trained professionals--don\'t try this at home.  :-)

     How about a controversial suggestion?  Let\'s not use TeX.  Let\'s
not use *roff.  Let\'s not use postscript.  Let\'s not use a word
processor formatted file.

     Why don\'t we just use ordinary flat ASCII?  It can be moved from
machine to machine with relative ease, is easily mutable for use with
almost anything else (most word processors that I know of will import
flat ASCII text without too much trouble), and is easily *human
readable*, unlike most formatter source.

     I agree.  If we just use ASCII text, that makes it that much
easier for *everyone* to use, and you don\'t need any extra software
to use it.

  Questions, Gramps, Jump Capacitors, Bad Science, Weapon repairs, Gaussrifles 
  and PS: A Possible Enigma.

Warning: PS: A Possible Enigma might be a spoiler for KNIGHTFALL and about the 
  Ancients, but PS: A Possible Enigma is at the absolute end of the this letter.

  I\'d like to propose this as the first commandement of TDR:
 
"There shall be no LittleBlackBoxes unless they are sorely needed."

  ie Jumpdrive is a typical case where LBB is needed, Antigravity is probably
another one. Xray lasers might be one.

  As for manuever drives, why not use fusion rockets as standard drives? They
might need to be reworked with regards to fuel consumption, thrust, weight and
cost, but they are simple and don\'t seem to violate any major priciples of
physics.
  (ie, one has to go pretty far down in the mecanics to discover that it don\'t
work because the strenght of the magnetic field needed to contain the plasma in
such a small volume would throw around all metal in an 100 mile radius, or 
something like that:)

  Antigravity is another thing that I have problems with. Isn\'t antigravity also
a reactionless drive, or might it be rationalized as the drive really pushing
against the mass of the planet?
  (FLASH! Capitol/Lost in Space (????-???????-?)                        317-1120
   As some experts had predicted, the anti-grav generators on lucans new 
ludicrously large flying imperial palace, was strong enough to actually move the
planet of Capitol. We\'ll get back to you when we pass Vland...)

  I\'ll try to remember to do a comparision between grav modules and COACC 
engines with repect to thrust per weight and price. My impression from a brief
look at it yesterday was that grav-modules isn\'t terribly mor efficient, but
they tend to drink much lesser fuel (and much cheaper).

  The key to this set of problems (ie manuever drives don\'t work, and when the
do, they use far too little energy and powerplants that give far to little 
energy to account for the fuel they use) might be to both increase the 
efficiency of fusion power plants and the power consumptions of whatever we\'ll
use instead of manuever drives (fusion rockets or grav modules)

  Armour. Is there anyone else out there who have trouble with the thought of
spaceships with armour that you\'ll need a heavy shape charge to penetrate? 
Factor 40 armour is the the kind that one expect to find on the front glacis
and front turret of a tank! (120mm HV guns have a penetration of 34 when firing
KEAP at TL8 (I assume that KEAP is an catch-all for the best AP/APDS/APDSFS/
APDSFSDU of the appropriate TL) and the front of a modern tank *might* be
penetrated by a APFSDS fired from short range.)
  But remember that tank armour is much thicker at the front than on the sides,
the rearm top and bottom. And the effective thickness of the front armour is
multiplied about 1.5 times by the sloping of the front surfaces, so while
the effective front armour might equate Factor 40, the effectiveness of the 
armour against shots hitting it from higher elevations is lower.
  The starships, alas, have at least Factor 40 all around. This is probably in
the range of 20 to 30 centemeters of ordinary TL8 armour plate! And those
things fly???

  One idea for getting protection from cosmic radiation even without ludicrous
amounts of armour is putting the inhabitated parts of the ship in the centre
and surround them with water tanks. If we\'ll use fusion rockets then water
might be a good choise for reaction mass?

  What? Me TML? Disclaimer: I\'m not TML, and besides, if FSSE, in the context
of the traveller universe, *were* a solomani plot, it would still be within
the context of the traveller universe. It would simply be a more advanced 
version of the "The Rebel Reporter" series of articles:)

  However, I think that this might highlight a question about TDR. What will
GDW say if we start pouring out things for something called Rebel Traveller?
I think that that name is too close to Traveller (R) and Mega Traveller (TM).
  TDR, on the other hand, is sufficienly non-specific that anyone can claim that
it really means anything. It\'s all a matter of plausible deniability:)

  Someone (I don\'t know who, since I didn\'t find it when I went looking for it
in my old files:( asked, jokingly, if TDR are going to be a hostile takeover of
Traveller. GDW might interpret it that way if the word Traveller is used as a
obvious part of the name. 
  That someone also raised the idea of starting a company to do TDR. This will
definately move TDR away from TML and into the hands of SnailMail. I feel
fairly certain that Tektronix don\'t want to provide another company with 
communications for free, and without really knowing that they do it!
  Even if TDR was disengaged from TML, there would still probably be trouble
for those in TDR that have net access through their employers. I don\'t know any
employer that would be happy if his employees used the net access to run their
own companies...

  Aw, I\'m already overworked! I don\'t have time to lead a major religion!
Perhaps Granps could ship some androids that look like me so they could do
my exams, leaving me with an immense amount of spare time for Traveller?

  250 MW, That\'s what one gets if one compare the power consumption by
weapons in MT and HG. Notice that all starship weapons use power in multiples
of 250 MW. (It\'s also stated explicitely in the rules somewhere. I think that 
it is in the space combat rules in Ref\'s Manual, the part about BG\'s)
  Since each old ton is 13.5 m3, one m3 of capacitor will store 666.6 MW.

  The ship in the example above will be able to store 18 TW (18,000,000MW) of
energy.... waitaminute... "watts of energy?" watt\'s are effect, not enery!
I guess that we\'ve found another hole in the rules, big enough to drive the
corridor fleet through. I think that this error is connected to the fact that
all weapons just have a MW figure for continous operation. That is not enough
data to be able to compute the energy in a hit. To do that we\'d need to know
how long the beam (in case of a laser) was targetted on the target.
  
  I think that the correct amount of energy will be the MW figure for one turn,
ie 18TW * 20 min, which yields 360 TJ. That\'s well into the range of nukes.

  But remember that even if a weapons is damage so that it won\'t work, that
dosen\'t nessesarily mean that any part is broken.
  Example: The magasine of an automatic weapon don\'t need to be bent much
before this starts to interfer with the feed. If the top part of a magasine is
damaged in a certain way, the weapon with refuse to fire at all. Similarly, 
springs might bent out of shape, cartridges might get stuck and so on.
  These isn\'t \'Superficial\' errors, because each one will make the weapon 
unusable, and \'superficial\' damage won\'t interfear with the operation of
something. Yet none of them require any new parts to fix, just some tools
and a little time.


  Lastly I\'m going to challenge one of basic pre-conceptions of Traveller and
MegaTraveller: The recoilless gauss-rifle.
  The gaussrifle fires a small 4mm calibre bullet. This bullet travels at 
1000m/s which is about as fast as an normal 5.56 NATO round. And yet, the 
gaussrifle inflict 4D with a penetration of 7, while a 5.56 NATO in Traveller
would inflict 3D at around 3 or 4 in penetration.
  This would indicate that the bullet from a gaussrifle travels much faster 
than a normal rifle bullet, maybe somewhere in the range of 1500 to 2000 m/s.

  How this weapon can be thought as being particularly recoilless is beyong me:)

PS A Possible Enigma (And spoiler for KNIGHTFALL, Why don\'t ^L work, btw? :-P
  In KNIGHTFALL the Primordials are introduced. They were about 250 000 yrs 
before the Ancients and the Ancients studied them. The big question is: Why?
The ancients are an already established source of fantastic artifacts and 
puzzling sites. Why then introduce another race? If they had no other purpose
but serve as the goal/enigma of KNIGHTFALL, they are totally unjustifiable.
  I don\'t even think that the thought of introducing another old mystery race
would enter anyones mind unless there were some justification.
  I\'m beginning to suspect that there is justification.
  Remember the Aslan Enigma: Nobody thought it strange that the Aslan did things
contrary to their nature and achieved jumpdrive in an extremely short time.
Everyone assumed that they did this without outside influences, until Digest
ran the Aslan story and the interview with MM where he stated that this was an
Official Enigma (tm:).
  The droyne lived a pastoral life as some low techlevel and never showed the
least aptness for conquering the universe. Then, suddenly, Yaskodray appeared,
turned droyne society around and spread them over the stars in pursuit of 
different scientific projects.
  Nobody thinks that strange.
  Another clue might be the usage of the term \'uplift\' in Vilani & Vargr when
talking about geneering a species to sentinence. That usage of the word is from
Brin\'s books (Not the Brin of Sintra/Corridor:). Very briefly those books 
feature a succession of species that each uplifted their successors.
  The answer to the droyne question would then be: No, they didn\'t do it
without outside influence. If the Primordials were involved, it would also give
the Ancients a very good reason for conductiong research about the Primordials.
It would also perhaps explain why the Ancients borrowed so much of their
technology from the Primordials.

  The answer might of course also be that my imagination is working overtime:)

Waitasec.  I thought 100 tons referred to volume, as in equivalent
volume of 100 tons of liquid hydrogen.  The rest of the ship is
designed using volume-tons and this makes it easy to figure out
how much space you have left in your cargo hold.

End of jokim\'s post.

Okay,   my error.    I assumed that you were still talking about mass.  If you
were referring to what I was talking about in an earlier post that 100 tonnes of cargo implies either 100 metric tonnes of mass or 100 cubic meters (volume) then they should cost the same.

I don\'t think it referres to that as the volume of an equivalent mass of liquid
hydrogen: that would be a cumbersome way of working.  Of course, this could be
how it is referred to in Traveller, for something being too cumbersome has not
stopped them before.

I have never designed a starship for Traveller.  However, designing a cargo
vessel for 2300AD, I just determined the volume of the cargo hold that I wanted,
and then determined the mass of the shell and supports used in manufacturing the
hold.  Anyway, it is not too unlikely that the designers use a different unit
of measure than the users.

This is a 2300 AD adventure, but should work well with a number of
things.  Let me know what you think.

CROWLE\'S COLONY                              2300AD.1

ADVENTURE DESCRIPTION

The crew of the badly beat up Fast Missile Carrier, the FMC Ollie
North are given orders to return to Terra to decommission the
vessel and be assigned to a new kind of starship, the Military
Survey Vessel class MSV Ranger.  This ship is fittingly named since
it is the first of it\'s kind to explore new star systems utilizing
the best of military technology.  The new MSV class ship, which
is equipped with the latest in powerplant, drive, hull materials,
sensors, weapons and comfort, has room for fifty civilian
specialists and a press representative.  It\'s mission is to explore
the outermost reaches of the various arm\'s of space and beyond. 
This is the first voyage of the MSV Ranger to a world with a lost
colony that has reverted to barbarism, on purpose!  This adventure
includes a new ship class, a table of primitive weapons, and
information on the discovery of a colony that deliberately went
back to a medieval technology level and erased all evidence of
mankinds other homes in the stars.

PLAYERS CHARACTERS BACKGROUND

This adventure is designed for starting player characters with the
following rough description kept in mind when the character is
designed.  The referee should look them over carefully to see if
they are appropriately matching their descriptions.  Names,
homeworld, etc. are all up to the players.  These are just
guidelines.  The referee should feel free to have these be NPC\'s if
the player\'s choose to have their own characters take the parts, or
leave them out entirely.

1. Reporter:  This person is from Frontier Times magazine and
should have experience in combat journalism.  He or she will be the
official representative for the presses of over nine colony worlds,
plus an expert in mountain climbing, spelunking or survival, in
addition to a good proficiency in journalism skills.  

2. Ship\'s Captain:  This Captain will have to be an outstanding
tactician, leader and jack of all trades, plus be an ex-special
forces expert.  

3. Ship\'s Medical Officer:  This person will have to be one of the
best combat medics/surgeon\'s around if the crew is to survive the
wounds of battle.  He is also a good scientist in the field of
choice.
4. Ship\'s Helmsman:  A "Sierra Hotel" Interface pilot as well as a
good fighter, ship\'s gunner, and starship pilot.  This person
should also be good at sensors and navigation.

5. Ship\'s Security Specialist:  This character will be highly
trained in space combat and all weapons categories.  He or she will
be an experienced special forces person and must be a survival
expert.  
6. Ship\'s Chief Engineer: This NPC is an all around genius with
machines, new technology, and he has an almost magical touch.  The
Chief Engineer is extremely skilled.  (Engineering 7+ with all
aspects of ships power and drives).  This person should be an NPC
specialist associated with the MSV Ranger.

PLAYERS BACKGROUND

The player\'s should be given the information on the new ship, and
if needed and appropriate, read the player\'s information section. 
The adventure starts where that part leaves off.  If the referee
chooses to not use the situation provided with the ship MSV Ranger
he should feel free to improvise, if he has a vessel capable of
making the voyage with the PC\'s on board.  A Trilon Special
Services Survey Ship can handle the voyage with a good enough
Engineer tuning the drives and delaying the discharge.  

REFEREE\'S INFORMATION ON CROWLE\'S COLONY

The Founding of the Colony: The Australian outpost on Ross 863 was
established in the year 2201.  Next, 4.3 ly\'s away, is Ross 868. 
2.77 ly away from Ross 868 is Ross 867.  In 2188 a colony ship
departed Ross 867 and discarding a drive, was able to cover 8.39 ly
to DM +32 2896, a Class G2 V star out of reach of normal space
craft for the next hundred and thirteen years.  There was only a
brief notation in a little read status report that the Colony Ship
Anachronism departed for ports unknown to settle a world.  Over 200
people disappeared at a time when conflict was over colony world\'s
much closer and easier to reach.  This group called themselves the
Ancient Earth Society.  They believed that man should forget all
dangerous technology, and that the old ways of living were better
for all.  Their plan was to someday start a world of their own, a
new world where technology would be discarded and completely
eradicated from all records.  It was founded by a charismatic man
named Alexander Crowle\'s.  The wealthy industrialist organized the
eccentric group.  He spent every credit he could get into a  
colonization effort, and called upon all of his hundreds of    
thousands of followers to raise credits in an effort to allow
the dream to become reality.  The colony group obtained their ship,
a standard colony vessel outfitted with Jerome drives intended to
be discarded once the vessel reached the limit of the drive range. 
By discarding the first drive after it built up to hefty a charge,
they then had their engineers perform the complex task of getting
the next stage on line.  The ship reached DM +32 2896 and entered
the system.  Blind luck brought them to a system with a world not
only inhabitable, but a garden world.  The colony ship was crewed
by Ancient Earth Society members.

They stripped the ship after unloading crew and passengers, and set
the hulk into an orbit around the world\'s largest moon.  On the new
world, which the colonist\'s called Erthe, the shuttles were
dismantled and all evidence of advanced technology was destroyed or
reformed into normal tools and materials.  The colonist\'s built a
thriving medieval technology level community, called Crowle\'s     
Kingdom.   Overhead, the derelict colony ship\'s orbit around the
larger satellite slowly decayed, all the while ready to transmit a
message to any ship that entered the system.  No message ever went
out until the colony ship eventually crashed into the surface of
the moon Thonn, which caused the ship\'s sensors to trigger one
transmission before it was destroyed. This message took over 15
years to reach Ross 863, where an Astronomer\'s radio telescope
picked up a few words obscured by static.  The static rendered the
message into a plea for help, instead of the intended warning to
stay away.  The log records and other information exist in the
damaged computer banks in the wreckage on the moon. 

Erthe:  The only planet in this system, Erthe is a much older twin
of Terra, with conditions similar to that of Terra thousands of
years in the past.  The dim light from the twin red stars keeps the
world in a perpetual twi-light.  The sky is a bright jade green
caused by a combination of an unusual element in the atmosphere,
which actually protects the surface of the world from the radiation
which would normally make the planet barren.  There is also a spore
that is the product of the civilization which once lived here, who
had left little remaining as evidence of their existence save for
worn carvings in piles of stone that might have been the ruins of
a structure aeons before.  An added side-effect of this new element
is that extended exposure in-curably addictive.  Anyone exposed two
or more weeks to the atmosphere, without taking a week\'s break,
will never be able to leave.  Those who leave that world after the
safety margin has elapsed risk going into a coma and brain damage
from the body\'s withdrawals, and then eventually will die.  

The side effect of these spores (which are dependent upon this gas)
is that it prevents any harmful diseases or germs from harming any
carbon based mammal that absorbs it and becomes a host.  Thus,
injuries do not become infected, and disease no longer exists. 
Wounds also heal very quickly.

Colonists:  The colonists who originally landed wasted no time in
settling in with farms, building\'s and home\'s constructed out of
local material\'s using power tool\'s and machinery to get them
started.  Once the place was comfortably established, the machinery
was stored away for the times it was really needed, quickly
learning to be dependent on themselves to build what they needed. 
All reference material, evidence of technology, weapon\'s and   
equipment having anything to do with modern technology was
carefully removed from their lives.  Their children were taught
only what children in 16th century England or France learned and
none of them learned of their true home of Terra.  To the children,
this was home, where they have always been.  Erthe was the name of
their world, Thonn the name of their largest moon, and Djonn the
name of the smaller.  They called their star the Sun and that was
the extent of their science and history.  Story\'s from Terra\'s past
survived, painting a colorful description of past events on earth
as being vague chronicles of Erthe.  Their religion was simple, and
their strongest belief was incorporated into their religion
described all men from the sky as being tricky devil\'s that used
men\'s bodies to try and destroy their way of life with new ways and
sinister machinations.  These beliefs went into cunning detail,
ensuring that any technology based visitor not keeping their
appearance as a native would get a hostile response from the
colonists.  Alex Crowle was no fool.  He knew that only those
complying with his wishes to not disturb this created ecology and
way of life could expect to peacefully communicate with the
colonist\'s.  The fact that his and the others decedents might not
wish to live such a hard, primitive life never entered Crowle\'s or
his follower\'s minds. 

Erthe Life:  The colonist\'s, in an effort to make their new world
more like the ancient Terra they idealized, brought with them deer,
antelope, cattle, pigs, sheep, hundred\'s of variety of bird
including geese, ducks, songbird\'s, pigeon\'s, and other varieties. 
Supposedly to keep the ecological balance, a cross selection of the
major carnivores such as the wolf, dog, cats and bear were also
added.  Fish of every edible kind were brought to stock lakes and
ponds.  The colonist\'s did not expect the variety of native life
that already thrived.  Some of the Terran animals adapted and
thrived, others vanished.  Terran crops grew easily and became the
main source of food for the colonists.  One commonly known
dangerous animal is called a "Dragon" by the colonists.  It is
believed that the creature is not a native lifeform but originated
from Wolf-424B-1.  It has a remarkable resemblance to the giant
lizard\'s on Wolf, which resemble large komodo dragon\'s on earth.

There are countless other mammalian lifeforms that seem to be
harmless equivalents to rabbits, foxes, and deer.  Other dangerous
creatures probably exist, but since the world for the most part is
largely unexplored, these creatures have yet to be discovered.  
 
Dragons:  The Dragon\'s are similar to Komodo Dragons or the Monitor
Dragon on Terra, as far as that they are reptiles, have big boned
bodies, and crawl on four legs.  There the resemblance stops for
these 1000 kg plus monsters are lightning fast killers, capable of
sprints exceeding 110 kph.  They are highly territorial and are
extraordinarily tough.  Their hides are prized for armor, for the
silicon base of their cellular structure creates a hide that is
pliable and twice as protective as any non-metallic synthetic armor
yet made by even Terran technology standards.  This hide would    
make an excellent trade good from this world.  The Dragon\'s inhabit
the desert regions, in rocky areas where wilderness area meets the
desert, eating anything that moves.  No one knows what the Dragon\'s
diet consists of considering that any of the carbon based life
forms living on the world are highly poisonous if eaten by the
creature.  (The creature eats it\'s own young, and if a grown dragon
is killed, the harmless younger versions start to grow unchecked
until hundreds of dragons start to compete for food and territory.
These beasts are quite prolific.  If the PC\'s manage to kill one,
they will have a tough time of it, and the real nightmare will only
then begin as the young quickly mature...) (Read The Legacy of
Heorot by Larry Niven,and etc.)

The local\'s have no weapon\'s capable of killing a Dragon.  The few
times their records show of successful victory was when a local
hero tricked one into a gorge where it drowned.  Another time one
was angered into eating a cow, it died a few minutes later.  Their
stories tell of the entire village being destroyed months
afterward.  They leave the Dragon\'s alone.  Fortunately, the
Dragon\'s rarely wander out of their respective territories.  Except
for this one who keeps getting pushed out of his territory by a
bigger, meaner Dragon...

Referee\'s Note - Encounters:  The only time a Dragon should be
encountered is if the PC\'s are looking for it, or with one
exception.  If the PC\'s shuttle land\'s in the desert area to avoid
being detected, they might just run right into one on the way
toward\'s the medieval settlement.  Normal wilderness encounters
should be wolves, maybe a bear protecting their young, or possibly
a pack of wild dogs.  This could be a surprisingly tough encounter
if the PC\'s have made the decision (or have been ordered) to
utilize local technology level weapons.  It should be noted that
winter has set in and this would be the only reason the canine
encounters would occur.  The bear could have been disturbed from
it\'s hibernation an earthquake, etc.  (There is an active volcano
near the colony site.) Or if the referee wishes to create something
weirdly dangerous/appropriate, he can sick it on the PC\'s. 
Especially if they are heavily armed and intend trample all over
the colonists. 

THE ADVENTURE

The Beginning:  The Colony Ship Anachronism, before crashing onto
the planetoid, broke up enough to fool the sensors into
transmitting the message warning.  Fifteen and a half years later,
the radio message reached the instruments of a German Astronomer. 
The message as heard by the Astronomer is as follows and should be
read to the players at the appropriate time:

"..................invaders, keep away..................... with
...... There is nothing ..........save the Anachronism,............ 
.........abandoned ............................... We are colonists
of...............................................................
...............................out of .................. we...
plead...........warn,.................stay away from...............
..............................................   
.............................humans...It has no ......... any
    .........................................................
    ........................die........................"

PLAYER\'S INFORMATION:

The Orders: "You and your crew have been ordered to Earth to   
decommission your ship, the FMC Ollie North (Fast Missile
Carrier), which has sustained substantial damage fighting the
Kafer at Hochbaden.  You have been reassigned to a new ship,
the MSV Ranger, a new class military vessel designed to be
used for peaceful exploration but fully capable of defending
itself against hostile forces and acting as a warship against
said forces."

The Mission: "To explore systems previously out of reach of
normal starships and carry out duties of scientific nature
while capable of performing duties of a warship.  It\'s first
shake down run is to depart from the Australian outpost on
Ross 863, eventually arriving at DM +32 2896, discharging drives at
Ross 868, and Ross 867.  The ship must successfully delay the
discharge of the drives before departing Ross 867.  There are two
reasons for visiting DM +32 2896.  One, is to investigate the
origin of an apparent distress signal from from DM +32 2896.  The
message was an ordinary radio signal that came from the yellow star
system 15 years earlier.  The MSV Ranger is to see if someone
managed to survive the 15 years since the message was sent.  The
other reason to go to the system is to determine if a potential
threat similar to the Kafer\'s has been or is present in DM +32
2896.

Static obscured nearly the entire message until computer
enhancement and filtering of signals was used to clean up the
message.  The message above should be read to the players at this
time.

If someone with Communications skill of 3 or higher decides to try
to enhance the message further and succeeds, the additional words
"largest moon" will be clarified.  This is to clue the explorers to
check the largest moon around the colonist world of course.  It is
there that the complete actual message can be discovered.  (See
below). 

Task: To enhance message: Routine. Communications. 10 min.

Failure simply means the message cannot be made clearer.

THE WRECKAGE OF THE ANACHRONISM

Entering the System:  Upon entering the system, the MSV Rangers
sensors will indicate the basic information off of the Planetary
Data sheet, such as the stellar data, types of planets at their
various orbits, and the fact that a garden world exists in an ideal
orbit in the life zone. After moving in closer the sensors can pick
up more information about the world.  Initial readings will give
the planetary data given in the Planetary Data sheet.  That is,
that the world is a garden world very similar to earth but having
much less land mass, and two satellites, one of which is larger
than the other.   Once the MSV Ranger is in orbit and begins
cartographic surveys and lifeform scans basic population data is
derived.  The atmosphere has an unusual emerald green tint to it
that is difficulst to analyse.  First hypothesis indicate the
atmosphere has an unknown element mixed in with the gasses. 
Lifeforms vary in size, but movement patterns have yet to be
analyzed to determine probable nature of the alien forms.  A large
variety of Terran animals exist in areas near the colony sites, but
some species have been identified in remote areas.  In particular,
migratory birds.  (note the following tasks are optional.)
 
Task: To disembark shuttle from hangar deck: Routine. Pilot.1
minute.

Task: To enter low orbit, obtain atmospheric samples: Routine.
Pilot. 20 minutes.

Task: To determine effects and properties of gas on humans and
mammals: Routine. Biology. 3 days.

Task: To determine nature of aline lifeforms through sensor       
observation and patterns: Routine. Zoology. 1 day.

Results of studies:  

The atmosphere has three diatomic gaseous elements which are similar to nitrogen,
oxygen, and one new element. The one\'s similar to nitrogen and oxygen exist in
an acceptor state, which means they are more readily able to bond with other
elements.  The new element, normally as harmless as nitrogen, is bonded with the
other gases forming a molecule that behaves in all aspects as nitrogen and oxygen
does in a normal breathable atmosphere, but when absorbed into the blood stream
of humans it becomes highly addictive within a short period of time.  After this
period of time, which is at least two weeks, the withdrawal symptoms are so
severe they would almost always be fatal.  Extensive exposure would cause no
harmful side effect until lack of the substance caused the withdrawals.  The
third element is the cause of the rich emerald green tint of the sky.  

Sensors directed toward the largest moon would show that it is a rocky core
planetoid with no atmosphere.  The heavily cratered surface is interrupted with
plains and mountain ridges much like earths moon.  The wreckage of the   
Anachronism is relatively scattered in the mountain range.  The largest section
intact is the bridge, and it may be possible to find computer memory chips and
clues as to what happened to the colony. After disembarking from the hangar the
pilot has the additional task of landing.  Task: To land make an low-g
non-atmospheric descent using a VTOL space plane. Routine. Pilot. 5 minutes.  

Task: To land on the uneven surface near the remains of the bridge. Formidable.
Pilot. 1 minute. 

After the tasks of getting to the bridge section in the side of the mountain,
clambering through the wreckage, then finally retrieving the necessary computer
memory storage chips, log-recorders, etc., and returning to the ship, the    
following message and the history of the colony can be determined. 

"We do not welcome invaders, keep away.  We will only welcome those who do not
bring things of technology with them.  There is nothing of value, save the
Anachronism, which we abandoned around our largest moon Thonn.  We are colonists
of the Ancient Earth Society, and claim this world for our own and demand all
outsiders to keep from interfering with our society.  Again we plead, beg, and
warn, all outsiders to stay away from our world.  A chemical exists in our    
atmosphere which is highly addictive in humans.  It has no effect in any way on
a human physiology until it\'s presence is absent from the body, which will then
die.  There is no known cure.  It becomes dangerously addictive after two weeks
exposure.  You have been warned."

This clue clarify\'s the "distress signal" as being actually a "Do not tresspass"
message that was transmitted when the colonist\'s abandoned ship\'s decaying orbit
somehow set off the message.  The ship\'s captain should realise now that
there is apparently no threat such as the Kafer in this region of space.  Since
the "survivors" are actually the descendants of the colonists who had prepared
the message over a hundred years earlier, they would need to be educated, not
rescued.  A complete survey and investigation of the conditions down below would
be needed before a message probe could be sent to the nearest command post.  Many 
scientists and specialists will be eager to observe the colonists and others will
be eager to study the world itself.  A basecamp could be setup away from the
colonists where the scientists could wear respirators and perform whatever  
experiments necessary.

Meanwhile, on board the vessel, scientists are presumably busy studying the
colony world.  (NPC) Astrophysicist, Dr. Lester Smith IV, Ph.D.  will report an
amazing find.  The mountain ranges on the continent below show signs of possible
large tantalum ore deposits.  The colonists below could become very wealthy if
they could be convinced of the necessity of trading with the rest of mankind. 

Now the Captain must make decisions.  He can either study and gather information
first hand and after sending a ton of information to Terra await for instructions
or he can do handle the touchy situation of educating the people below with the
aid of the many scientists and specialists on board.  The problems are two fold: 
1) The existance of a gas that after two weeks will kill anyone taken away from
it. 2) The fact that the founder of the colony instilled a fanatical beleif that
technology was "evil" and made his followers prejudiced towards people using
technology as being "devils".  A further complication will be the revelation of
the tantalum ore existing in such large quantity.  This is such a deadly secret
that sabotage, or war could be the end result if the wrong people learned of it.
The perceptive Ship\'s Captain will probably realize that landing in the colonists
"front door", wearing space suits and armed with high tech weapons, will probably
panic and anger them into attacking.  The only way to prevent a massacre is to
carry only concealable high-technology weapons and outwardly wear the low tech
level weapons and armor.

It is up to the Referee to decide what armor and weapons are appropriate if the
Captain is an NPC, otherwise the Captain would determine the weapons and
equipment he wants the team going into the colonist\'s city to have.  A complete
table is given describing the characteristics of a variety of ancient melee and
range weapons.  It is suggested that only very easily concealed firearms be
carried if any, with maybe a few variety of gernades in case any large critters
need to be dealt with.  They don\'t know how the people down there will react to
people who will be as strange as the explorers will act.  Remember Terra\'s early
history - burning to death people that were thought to be witches.  Note that
High Technology armor is greatly superior to anything made on the Colony.  Some
of this armor can be made to look like the kinds of armor actually used, but the
more advanced inertial or combat armors would be difficult to disquise.  The
machine shop and workshop on board the MSV Ranger are capable of manufacturing
weapons and armor identical to that used on the Colony very easily.  

The referee must decide the types of transport available and equipment on board
the mothership that is capable of being put aboard the space plane Voyager. 
Although the Voyager has a large cargo space (500 m3) and can handle a variety
of large vehicles, it can only carry a one or two vehicles, depending upon the
percentage of available cargo space each takes up.  The following table gives a
good assortment of useful exploration and tactical vehicles, and equipment:

Shuttle\'s Survival Kits:  Each kit weighs 26kg. It has the following equipment
in each:

Backpack:   Medkit, Hand Communicator, Lrg Life Form Detector,Farsee, Sampling
            Kit***, 7 compact rations, 1 ltr collapsable water carrier(full),

*** The sampling kits are varied amoung the packs.

Each pack is attached to the top of the locker where each individual keeps his
or her own p-suit, hostile environment suit, and cold weather suit.  In this
adventure the shuttle\'s survival gear is not used but this is useful information
for future situations.

Once the landing area is decided upon, and the base camp is set up, the
exploration can begin.  Have the "Captain" (or if he is an NPC, have him have
someone (a PC) do this) work out the plan they will follow to accomplish their
objectives, but first make sure they know what their objective is in the first
place.

Outline of Adventure:

Things Needed:  NPC\'s of Crowle\'s colony.  There should be three city locations,
one being a keep, another a ruin, and a last the central colony with big castle
and lots of poeple.  Use some old D&D maps etc.  There should be a large gulf,
with the three city locations equidistant from each other and lot of wilderness. 
This crescent shaped gulf shoud be like a 1/2 saucer, with a mountainous barrier
separating the inhabited lands from a vast desert.  No other continents.

Encounters:

o  "Bandits" could strike any walking disquised PC\'s heading toward the keep.

o  A volcano could erupt, sending panicked nasty creatures toward PC\'s.  

These two should hold the combat monsters for a while.

The rest should be role playing, have the PC\'s meet with the locals and convince
them of trade agreement.  The "King" will agree if they can take care of this
nasty "dragon" that keeps causing them greif.

Improvise.  I\'ve given you the bare bones.  This way any players who also read
this won\'t see anything vital.  I\'d suggest having the dragon holed up in the
ruined city.

   Since I get the TML on an IBM 3090-600S running VM/XA, I need a burster that

If anyone who uses these machines know of one, please let me know.  If you have
one written, please send it to me.  If not, I\'ll attempt to write one myself.

   I will write it in REXX (IBM\'s command language) unless I get overwhelming

but I\'d prefer REXX.

   Should I post it to the List?  or just mail it to whomever asks for it?
How about a ruling from the list administrator...James?

Well, since I called it the ultimate defense, I\'ll have to retract the
statement.  I didn\'t know it blows up when overloaded.  I still prefer the
Langston Field version that gets rid of absorbed energy by blackbody radiation.
Can\'t hide that very well.  I also like the fact that it (the LF) doesn\'t
necessarily blow you to atoms, the field generator will go, and depending on
how badly it was overloaded, the ship *could* be destroyed, but it might only
lose the LF generator.  It could also be anywhere in between.

Why can\'t it maneuver?  With reactionless thrusters which don\'t emit anything
to be absorbed by the field, you should be able to maneuver all you want.  Of
course, you can\'t *SEE* where you are going, and running into an asteroid
(after you drop the field) could ruin your day, but what is the handwaving-
pseudo-technical explanation for why you can\'t maneuver?

A PLEA FOR ASSISTANCE

At the urging of several illustrious members of this group, I recently sent my
entire collection of vehicle designs to our friends at DGP, to see if they were
interested in publishing any of them for the benefit of those unfortunates who
don\'t have access to INTERNET.  I received the bundle back today with a note
from Mr. Fugate stating that he didn\'t have time to wade through the entire heap
and would I please resubmit the 25 best designs at my earliest convenience, etc.

This brings up an interesting question: what constitutes "best"?  So, since some
of you have been uysing these things in your games, I\'m going to ask you to tell
me which ones you think should be published--presumably the ones that are the
"most useful" to you.  I could also see picking ones that are interesting 
and/or unusual, even if you haven\'t got a use for them just yet. This may end
up as a running column in the Journal, which would be amusing.

Thanks in advance.

the rules for blacvk globes today, and came to the following conclusions:

     The new rules really do say that gravity is absorbed.
     The new rules are also fairly clear in intending that the energy that
        is absorbed is useless for any other purpose.
     The energy absorption system is screwy, using "energy" and "power"
        interchangeably without explicit reference to period of time, which
        is a bit of a problem.
     A 100,000ton Jump-4 battleship or cruiser or whatever will have 27000kl
       of energy sink, which can absorb 17,550,000 MW (I know--one is energy,
       the other power--it dopesn\'t match.  See above)
     Ignoring the units problem, this means that this ship will not overload 
       and explode with the globe turned fully on until the ship is hit by
       78 Factor-9 nuclear missile salvos, or 59 hits by a Meson Gun T, which
       isn\'t as bad as I though it might be.  However, a flickering globe is
       still only worth 6 lvels (-2) of armor for each 10% of capability.

Overall then, a black globe is probably most cost effective on a large ship
which is already heavily armored, where the increase in danger is still worth
the enormous increase in cost to uparmor the ship.

I still don\'t like them.  (-:

     I have been following the discussion on correcting the physics of 
Traveller.  This is something to which I can relate.  Being a physicist,
it annoys me that games often ignore physics in places where there is
no reason to ignore it.  Obviously FTL travel can cause some physics
problems depending on how you handle it.  Traveller does what most people
and games do these days - FTL exists because you "leave" the universe as
we now know it and enter jump space (hyper space, warp space, ...).  

     However, what I\'m writing to address is the discussion on maneuver
drives.  These have been referred to as "reactionless" drives and people
have been trying to decide how one can have a reactionless drive.  Before
I give my version of the answer, lets step back for a moment and consider
what is going on.

     Maneuver drives get their power from fusion power plants.  In Traveller
the preferred material for fusion is hydrogen and the end result is
helium.  This brings up the first question - where does the superheated
helium go?  The best place is out the engine exhaust but then you don\'t
have a reactionless drive.  This means that the helium is somehow contained
and cooled then dumped someplace or maybe the hot helium is just vented into
space or used as fine adjustment thrusters the point is something has to be
done with the end product.  I would shoot it out the exhaust and take
advantage of the extra thrust (conservation of momentum you know).  Getting
back to reactionless drives - you now have some (large) amount of energy 
that you want to use for propelling the ship.  How do you do it?  Simple
expend the energy out the exhaust.  Since this is energy and not particles
this would (in some definition) qualify as a "reactionless" drive.  Look
at Star Wars space ships, notice the bright glow in the exhaust of the 
engines and how it gets VERY bright just before "accelerating to light
speed"?  This is still conservation of momentum (energy/speed of light).

     If you prefer some sort of gravity based propulsion system then
consider this:  Gravity can be viewed as a curvature of space or the result
of exchanging gravitons (a form of electromagnetic radiation).  If we 
look at gravitons then anti-gravity is the generation of anti-gravitons
which cause two masses to repell each other.  Then your back to exhausting
electromagnetic radiation (granted a rather interesting form of EM).  So
consider adjusting the curvature of space so that you ship (or grav-
vehcile) will slide down the "gravitational hill".  To get a craft to 
hover you would need to "flatten" the already curved space near a planet.
To rise you would need curve space so that the gravitational potential
is lower in the direction that you want to go.  Assuming that some kind
of machine can be made that can efficiently exchange energy for space
curvature then this is a truely reactionless drive.  All you need to do is
take the energy from the power plants and counteract the gravitation
potential.  The problem is (if I remember by Traveller right) that the
books say that gravity (anti-gravity) drives work better near large masses
(I assume they think you need the gravity to push against) but if you are
curving space, your drives would work better in flat space where you don\'t
need to nullify existing curvatures (ie far from planets).  However, if
you take the graviton approach then the drives will act like the book says
because the force (repulsive) is a function of the separation.

     In my games, I usually don\'t try to explain such things but when I
have to I use the graviton explaination.  To me it seems more plausable.
Clearly, "reactionless" maneuver drives is another place where the physics
has to take a backseat to playability or you say that maneuver drives are
not reactionless and be done with it.  In any event this is my two cents
worth on the matter.  Comments?

How about the following idea (would one of the physics types verify if this
is possible):
	You generate a LOT of energy,
	convert the energy into mass (E=MC^2, thus matter and energy
				are really the same) and
	then throw the mass out the back.

	You\'d have a reaction-based drive that didn\'t consume matter
	(except that the energy generation would use up heaps of matter).

Would it be better to use your power plant fuel as propellent?


Now onto a more serious issue (sorry if this sounds a bit flamish, it isn\'t
really ment to be):

I would vote very strongly NO for TeX.
My vote would be for plain text (maybe include a postscript version that looks
nicer).

My major objection to TeX is that I\'d have to learn something which I have
no desire to know anything about.  Even with the macros suggested,
I\'d still have to learn something new.  I\'d also have to know how to access
TeX on whatever system I was using (if it even HAD TeX, not everybody has).

What happens if I would like to boldface titles?  Creation of tables (rather
than formatted text)?  Subscripts?  Superscrips?

The point is I would have to learn how to do these things.  I have no desire
to learn a user-alien text formating system.  I also realise that the nice
word processors that I do own are not going to be any good to most of the
people since they use their own internal formats.

Everybody can use text (ASCII) files, everybody should be able to read them
and print them.  So what if they don\'t come out quite so nicely?  If we
seriously want to PUBLISH the results of the re-design then we can format
the manuscript after it has been written.  If it is as easy as was made out,
this reformat should pose no problems whatsoever.

Letting everybody be able to provide input is exactly the reason that we should
use a format that everybody has.  I say again that not everybody has access
to TeX.

[
 I should note here, that I personally don\'t own TeX in any form.  I do have
 access to TeX and would be willing to learn enough about it if TDR was going
 to be distributed in that format.  However, I do not desire to learn it.

I think that I was the one who suggested it (which I didn\'t really do).  I
do think that this is a really good idea.  There may be difficulties modifying
existing programs to work with any new stuff we create.  The ship design
program (coming soon, it is being beta tested ---- sort of) should be able
to take most modifications without too many problems.  I haven\'t looked into
the other programs available to see how hard they are to modify.  Hopefully,
the changes will not be too sever and they can be modified.  Rewriting from
scratch will be a major headache.  Even modifications can be unpleasent.
(Does anybody realise the quantity of data present in the MT books?  As an
example the ship design program uses a data table that is quite big wc gives
the following figures (the table is human readable text with comments included):

    2138   21011  117516 dat.tbl

I realise that this table contains a lot of redundant stuff because I tried
to capture the special cases in the data table and not in the program (which
is why I believe it will be easy enough to modify).

This task we are undertaking is looking to be a VERY large one.

There\'s been considerable discussion in the TML recently regarding
weapon skill categories. Allow me to put in my two cents worth.

Consistency! When I look at a game system I look for consistency.
Essentially, I\'m after an equivalent level of abstraction in all aspects
of the game. Individuals who argue for weapon skills in individual
weapons clearly do not. For example, if you believe that there should be
different skills for handling an automatic snub pistol and a gauss
pistol, would you also expect to see separate skills for repairing a
ship\'s maneuver drive and am automobile? Except for weapon skills,
most people are prepared to accept a high level of abstraction,
because otherwise the number of skills, by necessity, explodes.
Why does this differ for weapons? Beats the hell out of me.

As a real world example, I served for three years in the Australian
Army Reserve. At that time the standard issue infantry weapon was a
7.62mm SLR. We also learnt to handle the M-16. While the stripping and
cleaning of both these weapons differed quite markedly, they were not
that different when they were fired (the SLR had a bigger recoil).
Therefore, I argue that the justification for introducing individual
weapon skills because they are made differently is totally inconsistent
with the rest of the MegaTraveller game system.

My basic message is that many people are looking to complicate a
simple activity. Fire one rifle, you\'ve fired them all. Fire one handgun,
you\'ve fired them all. Just as with the mechanical skill - fixed one
engine, you\'ve fixed them all. Consistency!

Someone said the energy absorbed can\'t be used in the new rules.
Ignoring that, it should still be advantageous to fire all your
weapons while inside the BG.  Since most of your weapons aren\'t
operating at 100% efficiency, a lot of that energy is going to
be converted to heat, most of which will heat up the ship and
thus not place a strain on the capacitors from reabsorbed energy.

That is, assuming the energy to fire the weapons came from the
capacitors.

P.S.  If you don\'t like the physics violations in Traveller,
don\'t even think about White Globes.  It\'s basically a Black
Globe which absorbs all incoming energy, yet somehow the
person/ship inside can see out.

Reactionless Drives:
The greatest benefit of reactionless drives is that you dont\'
have to solve a differential equation to figure out the speed,
range, and acceleration of your ship when you have x tons of
fuel left.  Is there a way to achive this simplicity with
Fusion Drives?  And keep in mind a ship loses a good deal of
mass during a jump.

Gravity Field Warps:
Is this truly mass-independent?  If you can generate a gravity
field with x amount of energy, and it doesn\'t matter how big
the mass influenced by the field is, with a sufficiently large
mass, you can gain more kinetic energy than x-- another perpetual
motion machine.

btw, I like the idea of a gravity field warp (it\'s the unofficial
explaination for the Star Trek "warp drive").  It always reminds
me of the cartoons where someone is holding the top of a door or
birdbath and pushing the bottom with his/her/its feet, and the
door/birdbath keeps moving forward.

TDR:
You need not start a company immediately to publish it.  Just
make sure the stuff you send to GDW is in parts (pretty simple
considering the amount of overhaul proposed).  Then have GDW
sign some legal form saying the authors have full rights to
any future publication.  Then if people love TDR in the GDW
publications, you can work out future details through snail
mail and have full rights to a *complete* version of TDR.

I agree with ASCII.  Anybody can read it and print it out on
the fanciest printing resources he has access to.  And if you
guys do eventually publish, most printing shops have to convert
it by hand onto their own machines anyway.  I think the stuff
that prints Tex at 1200+ dpi costs about $4/page.  Dunno about
bulk rates.

Is there going to be TDR mailing list?  Will it go the way
of past mailing lists whose problems were, as someone told me,
"All they ever did was talk about considering discussing the
planning to lay the foundation of starting to begin to get
something done."

I\'m sure I read about this in a MT manual, which isn\'t here right now for me
to check.  Instead of absorbing energy, it reflects it.  It isn\'t much use as
a cloaking device, of course.  I can\'t remember whether or not it allows you
to fire out through it.  I think it is available at some ridiculous tech level
(TL 20+, maybe).

Actually, firing out of a black globe shouldn\'t be a serious problem.  You
synchronise your fire with the flickering.  It might be necessary to have a
slightly longer than usual period that the globe is off, to allow some fire
(especially missiles) to get through.  At the simplest, have an interrupter
circuit fitted into the generator which turns the globe off, permits weapons
to fire, then turns the globe back on.  The drawback, of course, is that the
enemy might hit you while you\'re firing.  This could be accidental (roll
dice to see if the enemy got lucky when he fired) or intentional (the enemy
needs to make some sort of Sensors task roll).

And there\'s your answer.  This rule, like so much else, is lifted from good
old High Guard.  And in those days, no-one had heard of reactionless thrusters.

Yet again, I say: ignore the garbage about reactionless thrusters.  They\'re
silly, they violate the law of conservation of energy, and they add nothing
to the game except inconsistencies like the above.

  Data is for enough Grav modules to reach the stated thrust and enough 
powerplant to provide them with energy.

Grav modules the best at TL
Thrust:	20tons		50tons		195tons

15	0,7	6026,7	1,7	15066,7	5,2	58630,0

Grav modules the best except for the 300kCr per kl ones:)
Thrust:	20tons		50tons		195tons

15	1,1	553,3	2,8	1383,3	7,8	5069,0

Just standard grav modules.
Thrust:	20tons		50tons		195tons	
TL	tons	KCr	tons	KCr	tons	KCr
9	40,8	2040,0	42,0	2100,0	47,8	2390,0
10	8,8	440,0	12,0	600,0	33,8	1690,0
11	4,8	240,0	12,0	600,0	33,8	1690,0
12	4,8	240,0	12,0	600,0	33,8	1690,0
13	3,8	239,0	7,0	433,3	27,3	1690,0
14	3,8	239,0	7,0	433,3	27,3	1690,0
15	2,1	173,3	3,7	266,7	14,3	1040,0

  This table is inacurate in two areas:
  1. The minimum powerplat volumes at lower TLs make it uneconomic to make
vehicles with as small thrust as less than 200 tons.

  2. I\'m not 100% sure that I got the scale efficienct right.

  COACC engines, give 195t thrust for 4t of engine that costs 300kCr (Fusion 
Rocket) or 50t of thrust for 4t of engine (High bypass Turbofan) (add 10t if
an AB is used)

  The basic thing still stands: Many \'ordinary\' engines give as good thrust
to weight ratio as Grav modules and is usually far cheaper. The drawback is 
very high fuel consumption, except for the fusion rocket.

(Sorry, have to rush, I\'ve got a Electronics-3 class in 2 minutes:)

Occasionally, when bursting the digest (even with James\'s new burst
program), I end up with resent messages that have inappropriate
headers. In particular, the "From:" field reads that it is from me.
For example, when bursting article 1770 in TML Nightly Volume 12,
Issue 9, I end up with such an erroneous "From:" line. 

I think this is because the corresponding digest article is missing
header fields and the mailer decided to put something in that field
(me). For example, article 1770 header is missing the "From:" line.

I assume the digest article is missing a field, because no such field
existed in the original message. This is somewhat puzzling as I
believe RFC822 requires an authenticated originator "From:" field.

Regardless of why it\'s missing, can the TML software back at TML HQ be
modified to stick in a "From:" field if it\'s missing in a message?

[Actually, the messages do come in with a From line.  The TML digester
deletes it if there is a Reply-To! I see now this was a silly decision
on my part, and starting tonight, the From lines will always remain
unmolested -- James]
