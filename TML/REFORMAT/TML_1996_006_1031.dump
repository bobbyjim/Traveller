No, I live in Dallas -- but was visiting the bay with my wife a few months

I would suggest that the same thing is true with Christians.  Many of us have 
to live not only with living out our lives in the best way possible, but also 
the bad reputation of those who have much zeal with little wisdom .  I 
wouldn\'t consider myself a fundamentalist at all -- yet many think the word 
"fundamentalist" is interchangeable with the word Christian.  Even the word 
"Christian" has many meanings to different people.  You have to live with 
people thinking that they know ALL about you once they hear that you are a 
Christian.  Ah, but it runs with the territory...   :-)>

I agree, my interest in pop occult had nothing to do with gaming either -- but 
in an attempt to gain some power in my otherwise powerless and often 
frightening adolescent years.  My real interest was in joining the military -- 
so I kept myself drug-free and fairly healthy to that end.

Well, I\'m not a \'holy canonist\', but I did use/explain Virus.  My Virus

either.  My background is telecon researcher and software engineer, while my

CT system, in which the number had to be equalled or exceeded.

However, the tables on page 152 appear to be based on the old CT system,
because a grazer is the least likely animal to flee, while a killer is the
least likely animal to attack!  This makes cows more agressive than
wolverines!

The sample table on page 152 contains results that are impossible to get with
the given rules.  Eg. result 6 has grazers fleeing on 13-, but the roll to
determine the flee number is 1D-1.  I think this means that the wrong table

I have to agree that PCs were too tough in T2k:  I had one situation
where my PC took a 50 BMG SLAP round in the face and walked away.  I was
happy that my character wasn\'t worm feed but I became convinced that there
was a problem.  Using Phoenix Command to resolve combat was my solution,
but that was short-lived when the LT took some buckshot in the pelvic area
and spent several months in a wheel chair.  _Too_ realistic for low-tech
medicine!  What I was referring to was that it was possible to reproduce
a realistic result in the house system.

I see your point.  I guess the results will be grossly similar if not
finely reproducing the details.

I guess the big thing that bothers me is damage being dependant
exclusively on weapon, where in the Real World (tm) it is really more
dependant on shot placement.  Being grazed with a 22 LR or 458 Win Mag is
is still grazed; a heart-shot with a 22 LR or 458 Win Mag is still dead.
Off the top of my head, what about damage being 2d6 for limbs, 4d6 for
torso, 6d6 for head, with a multiplier for weapon DV.  BTW, a max DV
after armor penitration makes sense here.  Feedback?

campaign.  I was using this time to write a program that automated UWP 
generation, using the alternate (and far more sensible) world generation 
system, by Zeitlin, et. al. at Joe heck\'s web site.

(side note...this program generates a list of UWP\'s with pop multipliers, 
gas giants and asteroid belts in a format to use with sub2ps. When I\'ve 
debugged it, I\'ll post the source at my web site, it\'s currently in 
QuickBasic for DOS)

	Anyway, I was going over the systems presented in T4, CT and TNE 
(didn\'t drag out the MT books though) and discovered a minor typo in T4.

	On page 133, the same description is given for both Type A and 
Type B starports.  I\'ll go on the old difference between the two, based 
on both TNE and CT, is that Type A\'s have starship shipyards and Type B\'s 
don\'t.

	Also, I was wondering about how to more accurately portray 
non-Sylean space.  After a millenium of Long Night, there\'s gonna be a 
lot of \'crashed\' systems out there.

	If I had it, I\'d look up the process in the Hard Times
sourcebook...I suspect that using the collapse process in TNE (and
Challenge 77) is way too extreme. The TNE Collapse system would probably
be a good indicator of what worlds looked like about 300 years ago, during
the darkest of the Long Night, but there\'s been (I assume) considerable
rebuilding that has occurred. And TED\'s are right out; their toys broke
many generations ago, though I\'ll bet there\'s a bunch of higher tech level
worlds out there in the Milieu 0 wilds who are lording it over their less
advanced neighbors. 

	Ideas, folks? Is it still a Star Vikings universe out there? (H. 
Beam Piper types, not TNE). The collapse of the long night was probably 
pretty slow in most places, and while there was war, it was sporadic and 
confined mostly (IMHO) to squabbling over dwindling high tech resources 
and market share. I\'ll bet far more worlds collapsed over Great 
Depressions than did from nuclear strikes, as trade died and economies 
shranks, and the widgets you needed to keep your sprocket factory 
humming became unavailable, and nobody wanted to buy your sprockets anyway.

	I\'d appreciate anyone who has Hard Times to either e-mail me or 
post a synopsis of the process (or hell, post the whole thing!) so I can 
compare it with the stuff I have for TNE. Maybe we can work out something 
for Freelance Traveller.

	Of course, if anyone has a copy  of Hard Times they\'d like to 
part with, let me know, too.

I noticed that many of the die rolls required in T4 are flip-flopped from CT, 
since I haven\'t really studied the rules of MT or TNE, I dunno if this trend 
started in those games or not.  Can anybody explain the reasoning behind doing 
this?

cut-and-paste of various numbers that needed changing (the cost of an 
air raft, the number of shots for a body pistol, etc.) from some 
leftover labels to the proper locations within the book.

And, after all that finicky work, we finally have an almost-perfect T4 
book.  All that\'s missing is the grammar/typo error corrections, and a 
fix for the recently-noted error in the Animal Characteristics Table.  
Sigh.

This weekend, I also finished editing T4 for IG, wrote a cover letter 
with a number of suggested changes (nothing earth-shattering; just stuff 
like adding more examples, adding a few Patron Encounters and a Casual 
Encounter, etc.), and got one step closer to finishing RPSC.

All this was in addition to the usual stuff (housework, grocery shopping, 
etc.) and getting the place ready for when my parents come to visit from 
California for the first time since I\'ve been here in Illinois, this 
coming Saturday.

Whew!  It\'s been a busy weekend.

It\'s time to go to bed, and get ready for tomorrow, when I meet the new 
President of the company I work for.

You\'ve been reading The Dragon, haven\'t you?
Women have a higher resistance to disease, and are immune to a great number of genetic 
defects (colour blindness, haemophilia etc) but actual physical stAmina depends on 
muscle, where men are greater (that took me a bit to find a half -decent word)
Actual studies of athletes have found that in endurance type tasks, women can get within 
10% of an equally trained man
Pain tolerance, no
Ability to tolerate tedia, yes (studies of women workers from ww2)

Negative again. The ability to tolerate g-forces is a measure of training and physique
In space, however, women are better off because of their higher average fat content
(in short, the more muscular you start out, the worse the effects of weightlessness will 
be on you)

In Old Expanses, the flow of events was roughly 
as follows (I don\'t have dates in front of me right now): 
 
1) The Solomani attacked; 
2) not knowing about (1) yet, Lucan ordered the Sector 
Fleet withdrawn for operations against Dulinor; 
3) with only local sub-sector Colonial Fleets to defend 
against front-line Solomani forces, the sector 
nobility surrendered. However, at best, the Solomani 
only gained effective control of a little over half 
the sector; 
4) attacks by Margaret pushed Solomani control back 
to within the rimward-most subsectors; 
5) Black War attacks wrecked key facilities in some 
parts of the sector; 
6) the Hard Times developed from the economic  
dislocations. The most coreward and rimward parts 
were fronteir zones of Margaret and the Solomani,  
repectively. The central areas were worse off; 
7) the Virus made everything else a moot point. 
 
They\'re likely ex-Imperial Colonial ships whose fleet-of-service 
might have depended on what time period you\'re  
talking about.

Speaking as an anthropologist, religion is a set of beliefs

mythology is somebody else\'s religion, and what is right is what you know to be the

OK, I\'ll get to this in a second.

Thanks. I think that everyone has thought of the Vilani in Imperial
society like Irish people in modern America (prevalent and mostly
assimilated) when in reality they\'re more like the British in 
early America - the Imperium\'s roots and the Imperium\'s enemies.

It is likely that Cleon, like almost all humans in post-Rule of Man
space
had Solomani & Vilani heritage. I don\'t know about exact references.

Yes, it\'s true - the Solomani pushed way out into the Marches. The Sword
Worlds and the Darrians - the Solomani corporation Itzin settled on
Darrian around -1513 3I!! The Solomani were absorbed into Darrian
society 
by -1400 (Darrians, ps.8-9). But wouldn\'t Solomani rather push to Terra,
rather than the marches? Anyways, it makes me wonder how many resources
Cleon
had at his disposal - probably a lot of settled systems just fell in
line
with his (initially) loose trade empire/federation.

(Which makes me wonder if a lot of diplomats way away from Capital still
went around calling it the \'Sylean Federation\' for decades after year 0,
thinking this whole "Imperium" fad would just pass on...)

Well, yes, readings show that Cleon sure as hell pushed into the Marches
at that time, but that isn\'t justification in itself. Neither is his
being Solomani. What was the big deal with the Marches, I wonder? Why
was
Cleon going to a lot of trouble in the Marches (which still weren\'t
totally
settled by the 1100\'s - look at District 268 - it still has a _number_!)
when he had the whole body of Imperial space to roll through without
resistance?

Maybe Cleon was just that good - by 500, the Marches were a solid 3I
territory and in 588, Terra joined the 3I. Of course, this did take 14
Emperors, so maybe Cleon doesn\'t get all the credit.

Enough about 500. By 50, when Cleon I\'s reign was almost at its end,
where were the _real_ 3I borders I wonder? Hm, now that I look at my
maps,
the Marches are past Vland, going from Core... Vland I understand, but
why
keep going? Maybe it\'s that first contact with Zhos in 50... hmmmm...
love at first sight?

Enough rambling,
Ethan

Having done a lot of this, Priority Mail is usually a good way to go 
for books.  $3 for up to 2 lbs anywhere in the US.  Unless somebody\'s 
ordering a ton, this is a good way to go...

If you\'ve got a couple of the thin books, u can probably go plain 
vanilla parcel post...  Unless you\'re getting large, UPS is usually 
more expensive...

Wait a minute...  Not to defend IG unduely, but I haven\'t seen 
anything that indicates their attitude one way or the other on the 
matter, at least not publicly...  From what I\'ve seen, they\'re 
willing to post errata, and are soliciting comments.  Now this might 
just be post release damage control for all I know, but I don\'t see 
that you have anything tangible from IG that indicates a shoddy 
attitude...

As for unprofessionalism.  I used to work for a Fortune 200 company 
that used to send out memos with typos and mistakes on occasion...  
Its hardly IG\'s exclusive province to put out stuff with typos...
As for the missing table (and really there is only 1 of any 
consequence), we knew about this back in July, when Guy Garnett 
realized it had not been forwarded to them with the rest of the stuff 
for QSDS right before the deadline...  It should have come as no shock to 
anybody on this list...

Ironically enough, IIRC, IG originally intended to publish T4 without 
a ship design system...  If they had, the 1 great error present in 
the rules would not have even had a chance to be discovered...  QSDS 
was designed in a hurry, and was thrown in with great haste by IG 
right before the deadline.  Frankly, we\'re lucky that Guy & Don got 
it done as well as it wound up happening...

I would be interested in hearing how you justified Virus:  I could never
buy the software-altering-hardware bits (esp. on TL7 & 8 systems), and the
_total_ devastation was a bit much.  Could you post a summary, or EMail me
if it\'s too long/technical?

I also do not have access to _Hard Times_.  What would MM say about

I listed them seperately because they each showcase a different aspect of
the Empire.  _Mote_ for ship combat, the Falkenberg stuff for the ground
combat.

Thinking back, L.E. Modesitt Jr.\'s Ecolitan novels should also be on the list.

Rich, that is truely incredible. The closest thing to that kind of 
reaction came from the mother of a good friend of mine when he was 
about 16. She banned him from coming to our gaming club and confiscated 
his books. He would still find a way of playing though. 

Rich, I expect the situation is agrevated in your community by the 
current trends in packaging design for RPGs.

Hmm. Talking about religion is a loaded topic, and it is very difficult to 
know what terms to avoid.  "Blasphemy" is a term that will not be accepted 
by the religious unless it is uttered by a religious authority.  However, I 
would object to the use of "ignorant" to describe a person who has a 
differing opinion about spiritual, mystical, or mythical beings. 
 Objectively speaking, the existence of such things cannot be verified 
scientifically and so I cannot consider their existence to be fact. 
 Therefore any claim that they exist is opinion.  Everyone is entitled to 
their opinion, but calling someone "ignorant" because they disagree with 
your opinion is a bit harsh.  One can only be "ignorant" of facts, not 
opinion.

I am an atheist.  I play Traveller and AD&D (well, I almost always GM not 
play), and religion is an interesting theme for an AD&D world.  However, I 
have never believed any of the creatures in the Monster Manual to be real 
(except horses and dogs and such!), especially the devils and demons, unique 
named ones included.  Spells and other such "occult" things are nothing but 
fantasy to me.  I too see the fundamentalist obsession with destroying RPGs 
as an insecure reaction to a game which treats their beliefs that demons and 
the occult are real as simply another element in a game, not to be taken 
seriously.  The game challenges their beliefs, and they cannot tolerate 
that.  Being an atheist, I can look at the problem not from the perspective 
of "which interpretation of religious doctrine is correct," but from the 
perspective of "why is it that the religious get upset by fiction."

I guess you\'re right about that, unless you count DNA analysis as a means to

     It makes sense to me, and helps explain why the early Imperium would

	I think it\'s more a matter of the social group you play with than 
NZ gamers as a whole; the games I\'ve played in the past have usually
included at least one female (who wasn\'t an SO, BTW), and the current
campaigns I play in are about 1/3rd female. Interestingly, my wife ran an
all-female campaign in intermediate school, and was introduced to gaming
by her father (!)

Actually, I\'m suggesting that the Fundies don\'t know what their real
motivations are. I\'m sure the fundies themselves are convinced D&D leads
directly to virgin\'s-blood drinking parties in public parks on Samhain. But
subconsciously they know that\'s utterly absurd; on some buried level they
must be aware that playing a game about demons and elves rather does
suggest disbelief, not belief, in such beings.

>Then some kids go nuts and think the world of D&D is real
[chop]

Ah, but have any real kids actually ever "gone nuts and taken D&D for
reality"? Personally, I\'ve never seen a report of such a case in any
credible news media. Oh, I\'ve heard countless urban legends, I\'ve heard of
reports on sensational tabloid-TV shows, I\'ve seen ads for really bad TV
movies-of-the-week "based on a true incident", I once *played the part* of
a psycho gamer geek in a friend\'s photo-comic, and while editing and
reviewing sf books and magazines I\'ve been assaulted by stories with this
theme.... but an *actual* case of a kid going psychotic and trying to chop
up his mother with a broadsword? No, I\'ve never come across such a story in
any media I would consider even half-way trustworthy.

Let\'s go back to 1980 or so. Even while the "Fundies Ban Satanist Game"
meme was first propagating through the mediascape, there was the first such
incident: a University of Michigan student who disappeared mysteriously,
leaving no clue of his whereabouts. He was said to be socially maladjusted
(read: a "geek") and known for running his D&D games down in the steam
tunnels beneath the UMich campus. [Someone please correct me if I\'ve
mis-remembered which university it was.] The police and news media
immediately jumped to the conclusion that this weirdo had "taken his game
too far" and come to some terrible end in a hidden branch of the tunnel
system.

The story made instant international headlines. Then, weeks later, the
guy\'s body is found, hundreds of miles from the school. The police have
managed to peice together what really happened. A closeted homosexual, the
student had fallen in with some other gays who happened to be involved in
various criminal activities. Either he made a nuisance of himself, or they
decided to have some extreme fun at his expense, and eventually dumped his
body out in the country.

[PLEASE NOTE that this reconstruction could be just as much of a
fabrication as the "Deadly Game" theory, resulting from homophobic
attitudes on the part of police and the media. Who can say?]

But how was this reported in the media? "Gay Student Killed By Underworld
Contacts" perhaps? Heck no. Where\'s the hook? The media still couldn\'t let
go of that nifty "D&D KILLS GAMER" headline. Here\'s how it appeared in that
paragon of journalistic ethics, the London Free Press (for whom I am
ashamed to say I once worked as a freelance illustrator) in London,
Ontario: 
                  "The Game of Fantasy..."
[followed by quarter-page story on the UMich cultic underground
tunnelcrawling weirdo geeks and their twisted obsession with, ick, using
their creative imaginations...]
                  "...that Ended in Tragedy"
[follwed by a much longer story on the discovery that the game had nothing
to do with the student\'s death, which was actually the result of deviant
pervert drugdealing sickos with switchblades.]

Notice something? The second story blatantly contradicts its own headline!
The Game of Fantasy had nothing to do with this particular Ending in
Tragedy. Proving if nothing else that Free Press news editors don\'t bother
to read the stories in their own paper...

What particularly struck me about the incident is that the editors could
have used the headline to tar homosexuals as a group by linking the murder
to the victim\'s lifestyle, but instead they chose to tar gamers as a group
by falsely linking their hobby to a horrible slaying. Revealing, no?

Anyway, perhaps I\'ve been totally out of the loop. D&D has become such a
vast, global phenomenon that I\'m sure some twelve-year-old somewhere has
indeed gone haywire and wacked his little brother with a truncheon while
dressed in fake chainmail, screaming, "Die, hideous minion of Yog-Sothoth!
Die!. Statistically speaking, it had to happen, and perhaps I just wasn\'t
paying attention when it did.

But I still haven\'t seen any such story in any news source that I trust.
(Granted, such sources are few and far between...)

I\'d be interested to hear of examples, but please don\'t "refute" me by
quoting things you heard on Oprah, okay folks? :)

kinds but have always felt that a skill in Gambling was a little 
anomalous since gambling was supposed to be about luck. Also, different 
societies and worlds have different games and events on which they 
gamble. I was often unsure as to where the Gambling skill actually came 
into effect. Some players maintained that it was a combination of the 
character\'s ability to cheat, bluff, and assess odds. Other refs I\'ve 
played under say it is purely a measure of the characters breadth of 
knowledge of the games and the language of gambling that gives he/she 
credibility when trying to get into a game or play the tables. 

Depending on which definition you go for, the skill could either have an 
impact on the outcome, or not. I usually allow some flexibility and go 
for the first definition if the character is on familliar ground and use 
the second definition if the character is moving in unfamiliar circles. 

A character with no gambling skill would probably have no chance of 
getting into a very lucrative but exotic, decadent and mysterious 
gambling cell on some alien world, but a character with gambling skill 
may get in but may fail to realise that s/he is gambling with their life 
until it is too late.

Put simply; It is unrealistic to expect that a character with good 
gambling skill is going to be able to always make a killing from 
gambling. Poker is not the only game in town.

I have never been satisfied with Traveller\'s recognition of weapon 
damage. I still try and use the \'On Target\' rules. They are very lethal, 
perhaps too much so at times. The hit location role is often more nerve 
racking than the to-hit role for players under the \'On Target\' system. 
Players also always make sure their characters never forget their kevlar 
helmets.

The Caravan is a a multi purpose spacecraft, designed for many different 
roles. 

1. Mobile Construction Platform, 

First and foremost the Caravan is designed to allow construction in 
either orbit and planetary sites. Its 2 lasers are actually designed to 
allow escavations, demolitions and basic teraforming (drilling into the 
planetary crust), as well as smelting ores. Its engeneering, labs and 
vehical workshops are optamised for this task, but with the best TL12 
equipmet installed, its capabillity are only limited by imagination (and 
budget).

2. Tugs

The Caravan is also designed to allow the connection of 1 or 2 Stagecoach 
Modular systems. While the stagecoach has its own stationkeeping drives 
and is capable of limited flight (and planetary landings), it needs 
something like the Caravan to jump into other systems. This makes the 
Caravan extreamly attractive as it allows multable configerations of the 
same craft, at a lot less cost.

3. Q-ship

While not designed as a Q-ship, in its Battle-wagon configeration (with 
the Jeep carrier Stagecoach modual), its 12 fighters and 2 missiles, 
added with State of the art sensors, makes this a powerfull anti-piracy 
unit. It is vunerable in fleet actions, but it can be configured as a 
tender ship quite easily, with its engeneering space allowing ship repairs.

The Stagecoach is the ultimate in configerable , modualr hulls , that can 
be used for a multitude of roles. 

1. As part of the Caravan MPS system
2. Temorary installations for ground and space with its own 
stationkeeping drive)
3. Cargo landers 
4. Emergency accomadation (on ground and in space)


For example, you need to beef up the accomadation on your spacestation, 
just add a Passenger modual! You need an impromptue base to repress some 
pirates, just place a Jeep carrier modual in a defendable place, added 
with a passenger modual to house more support staff and troops!

While it has fuel for 20 hours, and 1 year for its powerplant, it can run 
its powerplant for 5 years without a top up (as long as consumables are 
supplied). 

Each Stagecoach has mounting space for a 50tn modular cutter.

Rob -
Strangely, I just looked it up, and Animal Characteristics (p 144) states 
that the roll is X+, not X-.  But I must be missing something.  I tried p 
142 as you suggested, and I couldn\'t find what you were referring to.  
Can you give me more of a hint as to where the rule you reference is stated?

Boyd -
I would think they\'d want all the rolls to be consistent.  Since, in the 
task system, it is required that you roll X or less, all target numbers 
within the game should follow the same rule.  Less confusion.

Sadly, IG kept some X+ and some X-.  Hopefully, this will be fixed in the 
next version of T4.

The problem with the unexplored worlds that close to Sylea is not the size
of the Imperium in Year 0, but that the Sylean Federation is 650 years old
(propably Sylea never did loose jump capacity at all; anyway, they\'ve had
jump ships for 650 years at least). The notion that at least the physical
characteristics of worlds that close to Sylea would be unknown, simply trips 
my "suspension-of-disbelief" curcuit breakers. Its quite possible that some
of them would not have been visited in a while, but being completely unknown? 
No way!

wow I\'ve just realised that was the first roleplaying adventure I played 
EVER. I\'d messed around with the Judge Dredd RPG (based on the comics) 
but Gamma was the first one I really played. I think we spent about 7 or 
8 months once a week on and off (sometimes really "off") playing that a 
lunch times.Our GM played down the Ancients stuff, or we were too dumb to 
find out about it.We eventually saved the Chripers and blew the 
station to hell. Those were the days :-)

<snip>

   Pretty much what I figured.  My point was that though the collector\'s
among us might have most/all of DGP\'s Traveller materials, that\'s no
guarantee that the people at IG have it, or even know of its existence.  So
who ended up with GDW\'s library of Traveller reference copies?

   So the answer is, "no El Dorado".  I hadn\'t figured that he would have
more than a few copies of each anyway.

   Nothing pejoritive at all.  It is useful sometimes to break things down by
who was in charge rather than by game system, since things tend to overlap.
 Also, repeatedly typing "TNE era" gets boring.  :-)

   You\'re probably right.  Dave left *me* with the impression that since DGP
didn\'t exist anymore, the stuff was GDW\'s, but he may not have meant that in
the truly legal sense.  

   At any rate, Roger Sanger bought the DGP name last year.  Roger planned to
re-release the old DGP material and even talked about a CD-ROM product.
 Unfortunately, nothing came of it.  Later, he had some discussions with IG
about the possibilities of producing some Traveller material, then decided to
drop that in favor of developing some other projects (among them finishing
development of the game _A.I._, which DGP had been working on prior to
folding up).  The last post he made to the History of the Imperium Working
Group (HIWG) mailing list was back in the early spring.  I haven\'t heard from
him since.

That\'s the problem with fundamentalist Christians. They concentrate on
those things which are not central to their faith. I am a Christian, but not a
fundamentalist (although I will say that I believe in the fundamentals,
theologically speaking). It\'s not important to me whether Christians go
watch rated R movies, play role-playing games, drink alcohol, or play
cards. What is important is that Christians filter the stuff in those
activities through their worldview, so they can put the proper labels on
things. For example: "You know, that nude scene really didn\'t add
anything to the movie. " or "I enjoy playing cards, but I\'m losing my shirt,
so I better stop." or "I\'m feeling a buzz, maybe I shouldn\'t have another
drink." or finally (to stay on-topic) "My character is conjuring up a demon
from hell to fight his battles. There\'s definitely something, say, *satanic*
about that." That\'s one of the reasons I stopped playing D&D years ago,
before I was a Christian in the first place. It made me uncomfortable. And
that\'s one of the great things about Traveller: it\'s got none of that
baggage to drag people down. I think more of a variety of people who
believe a variety of things can play Traveller than can play D&D.

Fundamentalist Christians blow things way out of proportion, and give
Christianity in general a bad name because of it. I just wanted to defend
my religion, and uphold a hobby I love at the same time.

First of all, I resent you saying I spewed anything.

I experienced some of the same. It is amazing how intolerant of fun some people can be
I still remember the old arguments (does monopoly make me a greedy capitalist? no? 
Then how does pretending to be a wizard make me a witch?) I had a situation where the 
sponsoring teacher became a fundamentalist christian over one summer (in high school)
 and when we got back in September we no longer had a games club. He felt that we 
were dealing in something very wrong (luckily we found another teacher who liked 
provoking loonies like that and we were back in business)
Try being an atheist on top of that (I had the Christian Fellowship after the whole games 
club because I was a member and that "proved" it was bad)

Well said! And to add some shameless advertising to the mix:

For all those interested, Christians and non-Christians, there is a
Christian role-playing game out there that was almost killed by these
same fundamentalists. Several people (including me) are trying to revive
it, because there are still 8,000 copies of it sitting in the warehouse of a
non-profit organization, and it really is a great game. You can download
an electronic copy of the game from ftp://earth.usa.net/users/dragonraid.
There\'s a brochure on the game there and a price list as well. The
brochure talks about what caused the company who originally produced
the game to go bankrupt. 

There\'s also a mailing list: Send email message with "SUBSCRIBE
dragonraid" to listserv@associate.com. There\'s not too much traffic
now, so your box won\'t become inundated like it does with this list :) If
you want to actually get a feel for the game (including having an
automatically perl-generated Character), you can go to 
http://www.associate.com/Innovative/DragonRaid/index.html and check it
out. 

Ok, shameless advertising is over. Sorry for the wasted bandwidth, but I
don\'t have the funds to put those nice graphical advertising banners all
over web pages!

This whole discussion has gone way off topic, but I\'d like to add one
quotation (paraphrased, since I\'m at work and don\'t have access to my
home library) from noted literary scholar C.S. Lewis: 

"There are two dangers regarding devils and demons. One is to
disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe, but have an
unhealthy interest in them." --The Screwtape Letters

When I play a competitive game, I play to win, and expect my opponent to do
me the same courtesy.  After all, competition is part of the game.  I
regularly get pasted at Chinese chess by my students, but as long as they
don\'t gloat and explain (after the game) what I did wrong/they did right I

Probably because that\'s how the very vocal fundamentalist Christians use it. 
I went to a fundamentalist Baptist church for a while (because that\'s where
my fiancee went) and they were very agressive in calling everyone who went to
a different church "non-Christian".  

To drag this back to a Traveller perspective, I\'ve used this type of
word-shift to good effect in many adventures.  Check out the novel "The Man
Who Pulled Down the Sky" by John Barnes for some really neat ideas on
incorporating social science into a Traveller game.  In addition to being a
really good read, it\'s got one of the best explanations of semiotics I\'ve
seen (including the \'drift of the signified\', which is what happens when a
word\'s meaning shifts with time or circumstance).

Oh, and for the record, I\'m no longer attending the Baptist church.  I\'m now
Warden at an Anglican church with a priest who has incorporated elements of
traditional Chinese beliefs into his orthodox Anglicanism.  A bit odd, but
definately an accepting place.

Well, in CT/MT you tried to roll over a target number.  In TNE/T4 you try to
roll under the target number.  So it makes sense for things to be consistent
within the gaming system by flipping a lot of the old rules.

The reason you roll low now is that instead of task difficulty setting the
target number (and your skills modifying it) the task difficult changes the
number of dice you roll, while your sklls set the target number.  Dunno if I
like it yet - I\'ll have to game with it a couple of times first.  But I like
the TNE system...

Although I _am_ beginning to think that IG should give me a free corrected
reprint of T4, especially as I paid them in May (via postal order, before
they could take VISA) and I _still_ haven\'t received my hardback :-(

Whoa! I gotta disagree with Joe and Thomas on this point. Right now, IG
does not have a product that is critically useful to OLD gamers and
those FAMILIAR with Traveller. T4 was designed with the new player in
mind.

T4 is every bit as good, and quite a bit better, than the original 3
little books that launched CT ever were. T4 is a complete game; only
those who already have campaigns where PGMP\'s are used are going to miss
the lack of PGMP\'s in T4. Only those already who have campaigns where
factor T meson guns are used are going to miss their lack in T4. In
other words, only old timers like us are going to feel that T4 is
incomplete. That\'s only because we already know what\'s to come.

I played Trav without gauss rifles, RAM auto GL guns, and factor T meson
guns for a long time ---- I just used the 3 little black books. And it
was a good game, a complete game. I never felt like I didn\'t have enough
resources to run a campaign.

T4 has everything the original CT had (except for easy and flexible ship
design rules) Plus a little bit of campaign information that the 3LBB\'s
didn\'t: like explanations of what the Imperium is, what the various careers
actually do, some alien races, some example adventures, etc, etc.

I think its a fantastic resource for new players. Finally, I have a book
that I can hand an interested new potential player who asks me, "What is
Traveller?" "This, this is Traveller," I can reply, as I give him a copy
of T4, which can sell itself. And that\'s a heck of alot better than "You
see those boxes and boxes of old, out-of-print, hard-to-read, technical
manuals? That\'s Traveller." Let\'s face it, the kind of Traveller we know and
love is not the kind of Traveller that a newbie can begin to know and
love without a lot of technical assistance from an old fart, and a lot
of time to "aquire the taste."

IG, you\'ve got a great new product on your hands.

    'body' => 'Hey, just here to add my .02 gal of fuel to the fire.

I have been reading Boyd, Richard, John, and others converse about the
Fundamentalists and their problems with RPG\'s.  Well, I think I know at
least part of the troubel, and it has been waltzed all around here on the
list in the past few days.

To start, let me pull out my label and wear it proudly.  I am a Fundamental
Baptist.  I believe God exists, I believe that he created the world in 6
days, including man, I believe that Jesus Christ is God, and I believe that
Jesus became a man, lived, died, rose from the grave, and will one day
return.  I say all of that to somewhat define the label I wear.  This
mailing list is not the place to debate the ideas above, I only bring them
up to define my background and frame of reference.

Now, after having said what I said above, some of you, no doubt, have
labeled me as a person who does not think for himself, and takes what he is
told as truth.  I am not that type of person, and I have proven that to a
couple of you through discussions we have had(Ahem, any of you want to speak
up, now would be a good time :), but my point is simply that by classing
myself as a Fundamentalist, I am automatically perceived to be a certain
type of person, and believe a certain way.  The same is true of the
"Christian Community\'s" view of RPG\'s.

I think it was Glenn who came up with the theory about the named demons and
devils being listed with faries and elves and such being perceived as
Blasphemy by religous folk.  I thin Glenn is very right, but only for a
portion of the religous community.  I think the problem is a lack of
understanding about the normal RPGer in the Christian Community and the lack
of understanding of the normal Christian in the RPG community.  Which of the
RPGer\'s of which of the Christians get the press?  The normal ones, or the
ones that exist on the fringe and carry out their beliefs or hobby (as the
case may be) to the extreme?  Being a member of both communities, I can tell
you that it is not the normal ones.

Boiling this down is kinda tough, but I think the main problem is a lack of
an accurate perception by both groups of the other.  I don\'t know how much
can be done to "fix" this situation, though.  I don\'t know how many of you
would sit down long enough to let me clear up the misconceptions of
Christianity.  I don\'t think this would happen much for 2 reasons:

     1. Finding all the misconceptions is not easy, many of them are so old,
that they seem as fact to the one that doesn\'t understand.
     2. Many of you probably don\'t care enough about religion to sit and
listen to the explanations.  This is not a flame or insult.  It is the same
thing as me not wanting Leonard or one of the other Engineering types to
explain the details of quantum physics to me, I just am not that interested.

These same two reasons are true of those in the religous community about
RPG\'s.  That is, their misconceptions are so deeply rooted that finding them
all would be difficult, and they really don\'t care that much about Role
Playing to learn what those misconceptions are.  The problem arises when
someone, out of ignorance or based on these misconceptions, speaks out
against the other group.  It is then that attitudes are charged up and
people get defensive rather than calmly explaining what they misunderstand.

Having said all of this, from my experience, the main problem
(misconception) that most religous groups have with RPG\'s is the fact that
someone plays God (the GM).  While this is true in a sense, we, as RPGer\'s
see the difference, but they, as religous, don\'t.  Why don\'t they see the
difference?  many different reasons, but they all boil down to one simple
one, they don\'t want to.

Well, now that I\'ve added my fuel to the fires, I think I\'m done ranting and
raving, I will turn the soapbox over to whoever else wants a turn. :)

In the late 19th century, folk like these were very suspicious of

I\'m sick of being bashed by people just because I defend something

How can we determine whether it will never improve.  IG has released 
exactly ONE book.  Starships, and the rest could be worse, or they 
could be better...  If these books are worse, then IG will probably die a short 
painless death.  If they\'re better, IG will have learned from their 
early mistakes and improved...  If they\'re the same, IG will probably 
survive...because I didn\'t think it to be too bad an effort...

I agree.  I wish it had been cleaner.  In light of the haste with 
which it was put together, I\'m not surprised.  Actually, I\'m 
pleasantly surprised its not worse.  Guess I don\'t look at it as a total 
disaster.  I can work around typos, and other than the Jump table, 
its pretty clean overall...

My assertion still stands.  Guy and the good folks at GDW-Beta designed 
QSDS (and did a great job IMO) and just plain forgot to send the J-Drive 
table to IG along with the rest of the submission, and neither party 
realized it until after the book had gone to the printers...  Amongst 
16 pages of tables, it\'d be real easy to overlook 1, and that\'s 
probably what happened.  Again I state that this should have been no real 
surprise to the members of this list, at least unless you joined VERY recently...  

Currently, I use the MT system.  After the errata, and a few 
homebrewed patches, its been my game system of choice ever since it 
came out...  Compared to MT, T4 is error-free...  I guess I\'m not 
going to have a heart attack because a J-Drive table is missing, and 
the rest of the stuff is so easy to fix that I\'m not worried about 
it...

To me, the glass is half full.  Somebody is producing Traveller stuff 
again, and my favorite RPG is again being supported.  Yes, IG 
definitely has their warts, but so did GDW, and so does TSR, WW, GW, 
FASA, and just about everybody else out there...  We are definitely 
better off having IG whose main focus is Traveller putting out the 
game, than having a SJG putting out Traveller books "when they get 
around to it."

I do hope they learn from the mistake, and improve, and time will 
tell whether it happens or not...  Let\'s see what happens, that\'s the 
best I can say...

   Actually, my survey showed that over half of Traveller players on TML used
the TNE game mechanics.  Fewer used the setting material, but it was/is (if
you include _Children of Earth_) a bit more popular than *that*.

<snip>

   Interesting analogy.  But what it also says is that all of us will *never*
agree on how to play the game above the gaming group level.  This has some
implications with regard to how any present or future producer of Traveller
material should approach the current customer base.  It would appear that it
is impossible to cater to all of us, beyond trying to maintain a consistent
storyline.

   Actually the concentration should be on new players, and I believe that it
is.  From the moment I opened the new T4 manual I saw a game that isn\'t being
produced for you or me--it is being produced for those who have never played
Traveller before.  As Boyd said, we like things how we like them.  IG knows
that long time Traveller players will accept the new things that we like, and
will reject those things we don\'t.  If they are lucky, some of us will
totally embrace T4--but they also know that most of us will continue to use
TNE, etc.

   Seen any _Dragon_ issues devoted to Traveller lately (or even one
article)?  Many things brought GDW down, but higher than projected sales was
not one of them.  No, we Traveller players are a small group all right (I
prefer the term "elite"), and we are getting a little bit more "elite" with
each passing year.  I\'m doing my part to reverse this trend, and so is IG.

   As far as IG-published materials are concerned, they should market what
sells--whatever that may be--even if it includes ideas and concepts that have
never been a part of Traveller before.  By all means we should still continue
to give them our input in the form of suggestions and constructive criticism,
but let\'s remember who owns the copyright....

>After all, I can meld T4 to whatever I desire in a game.

   Or for that matter, continue to use CT or MT, or TNE and take a few bits
and pieces (or even large chunks) from T4 and use them for your home
campaigns.  T4\'s commerical viability no longer depends upon keeping the
existing fan base happy with regard to storyline or game mechanics--it
depends on new customers.  We might not like that fact, but a fact it is.

That statement makes no sense. Science is a tool; you\'re using it as a
religion, using it as the defining source for your beliefs. Science can\'t
enter philosophical / religious realms, because it isn\'t equipped to do so.
It\'s like trying to use a hammer to tighten a nut. Can science prove the
existence of love? Can it prove the existence of friendship? Hate?
Ideas? No, but we all know they exist.

Ok, If you go to Gen Con and enter a tournament, expect no quarter.  But
if I\'m playing with my 13 year old nephew, I\'m not going to pop out my
most deadly combination the first time we play, and I\'m going to be lax
about letting him "take back" a play.  We are there to enjoy ourselves,
which isn\'t to say that I won\'t hesitate to build "good loser" and "good
winer" skills.

Likewise in (Obligatory reference) Traveller.  I have played with a couple
of kids at one poit (15-16 year olds) and the game was a bit different for
the sake of those learning to be competitive.

  Please tell me more!  Fascinating!!  Thanks!"

I\'ll try, but I\'m hampered by lack of any good way to draw diagrams.
Yes, you are correct that an interstellar trip at relativistic speeds
takes longer for the people left behind than it does for the people on 
the ship.  One can certainly regard that as a kind of time-travel.  But 
it is one-way, only into the future, and in that regard is the same as 
the time-travel we all do at the rate of 24 hours a day.

How would jump drive affect this?  It would give you some leeway.  You 
could cut down on the trip times for both shipboard and ground observers 
by using jump.  Or so I would imagine.  Since jump is imaginary physics, 
how it works with real physics is somewhat up for grabs.

To go backward, you need to mix the faster-than-light jumps with 
the relativistic effects, as Leonard and Erickson and I described (even 
if we don\'t give the same direction of acceleration).

The basic equations for special relativity let you calculate the 
space and time coordinates for an event as they will appear to another 
observer, given the position and velocity of that observer, relative 
to you.

It works out that the time of an event is a function of the other observer\'s
speed AND a function of the distance between the observer and the even.
If an event is taking place somewhere ahead of the moving observer, and 
happening "now" (for him), it happens in the future for you (if the two 
of you are side by side at the moment -- that is, if he has breezing by you).
If the event takes place somewhere behind the moving observer, if it 
is "now" for him, it is already past for you.  And the further behind 
him it is, the further in the past it is for you.  And, of course, the 
slippage gets worse, the faster the other guy is going.

(Of course, if I\'ve got my signs muddled, as Mr. Erickson thinks I have,
then the slippages run the opposite ways.)

I wish I could give you detailed formulas, but I am rather a "fringe" 
Traveller fan and only have some supplements, mostly TNE stuff, rather
than any specific details about jump drive and the effective speeds 
it can reach.

 "And the critical speed is supposedly when the product of your effective

Um, the dimensions on this need some juggling, since the product of two 
velocities is square meters per second squared, and thus cannot be

Two ships are certainly easier (waiving the issue of whether or not 
you accelerate the opposite direction from the way you jump).  I was
giving an idealized, thought-experiment-type illustration.

Well said, Stu!

Here\'s to the hope that IG will do better than they have already done.  T4
is good.  I want Traveller of the near future to be great!  I know IG has
the ability to do this, and I feel confident that they will.

I don\'t see anything wrong with it either. I just wanted to illustrate
that it may take a while for IG to resolve the "uncharted worlds"
paradox, and that that may not necessarily be such a bad thing.

OTOH, if they resolve it soon, that may be an even better thing.

Boy it sure was compelling. Compelling enough to get me to change my
campaign from a homebrew to the GDW canon!

A good point. And that\'s exactly why I didn\'t abandon the GDW canon
after Adventure 12; their other adventures were just as compelling!

It certainly isn\'t a flaw or mistake! It is Traveller\'s greatest
strength! (IMNSHO)

Sorry I didn\'t make my position clearer, Trent. Posting to the TML is
often a humbling lesson in communication for me.

PS ---- I admit to not liking Adv-12 very much, but I recongnize that
this is /my/ problem. I took my players on it, and for them it was the
highlight of my campaign. (I never saw them so excited about an
adventure since the Zhodani attack at Twilight\'s Peak!)

Unsolved mysteries may make it easier for a GM to come up with a plot
device, but what the players really want is /answers!/ And a GM can only
string them along for so long.

The only evidence I know of is an oblique reference (but you know how I
love oblique references!) to the statistical distribution of Ancient
sites. (I think it was in Library Data under "Ancients" or "Ancient
sites.") The astrographic center of these sites appeared to be in the
Spinward Marches.

There is no mention of when this very interseting little fact was first
discovered, but this is no obstacle to a GM who wants to make something
interesting out of it!

Hmmm. All the fundamentalists I know of who dislike RPG\'s (which is by no
means most of them) do so not because of demons and devils, but because
of player characters who 1) Kill people routinely, and 2) practice
magic. In short, they question the morality of pretending to commit
evil, as well as of actually committing evil. They seem pretty aware of
their real motivations.

Interestingly enough, my scientist co-workers who object to RPGing (again,
not the majority) do so for the same reasons. They dislike violence and
the occult (as do I), and they fear that RPGing encourages these things.

These objections are of course mixed into the media hysteria that
surrounds this issue, as you pointed out so excellently Glen. Very
interesting post, BTW. 


Regarding attitudes to RPGing, I haven\'t really noticed any demographic 
breakdown on negative or positive reactions. One of the things that I
like about RPGing is that it appeals to such a broad cross section of
local culture. Because RPGers are such a small group, it forces jocks
and couch potatoes, christians and atheists, skeptics and occultists,
old and young, conservatives and liberals, and moderates and extremists
to get together if they want to play. Very few other recreational
pasttimes get such a diverse group of people together for interpersonal
exchanges.

Unfortunately, it doesn\'t seem to do such a good job at getting men and
women together (as has been discussed lately on this list), or blacks
and whites (as has not).

As far as groups objecting to RPG\'s they seem divided into a
conservative camp, and a liberal camp. The loudest noise from the
conservative camp seems to be the spouting of religious doctrine. The
loudest noise from the liberal camp seems to be the spouting of feminist
theory. Fortunately for us, these two camps don\'t seem to get along with
one another as well as we do! 8^)

        In 1984, I lived in a college Christian fellowship house near the
Central Michigan campus called His House. My best friend and fellow gamer
Ray lived there, and he invited me to move in. We had gamed at the house
before, with the full knowledge and assent of the pastor. At that time, we
played Top Secret and the Star Trek RPG; for religious reasons and others, I
didn\'t even play AD&D. Two guys moved in in the fall, and they were real
tight with the sponsoring demonination. The next thing I knew, we were being
told that we couldn\'t game there anymore; that other groups on campus were
saying that His House was becoming a "gaming fellowship". It turned out that
two people had made that comment. We refused to budge on that, and by the
time it was over, I had been labelled as a cult leader, and told to move
out. (Interestingly, they never went after Ray, and he certainly gave them
reason to. They went after ME because I was the GM.)
        I\'ve been a Christian since 1975. I also lost a fiancee because I
wouldn\'t give up gaming. I made REAL sure my next girlfriend was a gamer; in
fact, I met Susan when she joined our Champions game. We were just starting
to date when all that stuff at His House went down.
        I think we need to differentiate between "fundamentalists" (people
who beleive in the fundamental truths of their religion) and
Fundamentalists, possibly more accurately termed Reactionary Fundamentalists
(RM\'s), who carry things to extremes.
        One of the two guys who eventually started the ball rolling on
throwing me out of the house said something which I thought was revealing.
We were arguing over whether RPG\'s were evil, and I said "But we don\'t play
AD&D! We play Star Trek!"
His comment was "I know that, but people out there don\'t, and I don\'t want
to have to take the time to explain it to them!"
        Sorry for unloading, but it just had to come out.

Here\'s a thought that I came across in a gaming mag many years ago.
Stop and consider how *you* would react if (for example), those clerics
were invoking Christ and various saints to perform miracles for them.
And were worshipping Jehovah.

At lot of folks get *real* uncomfortable when the situation gets that
"real". On the other hand, I\'ve known several witches who got quite a
laugh out of the silliness aspect of magic in D&D and other games
compared with magick as practiced in their religious rituals.

Folks that tend be be humorless tend to get upset. Those who realize
that even the Being or Beings in charge of the universe probably have a
sense of humor too tend to take things in stride.

would require "unobtanium" over on rec.arts.sf.science, it occured to
me that this could be turned into a plot device. 

In Lary Niven\'s Known Space universe, the General Products hull is a
type of "unobtanium". It\'s an artificially strengthened molecule, just
about indestructible, and transparent to visible light in the frequency
ranges of the customers. The hulls come in a limited number of sizes
and shapes, and you specify any openings in advance.

The GP #1 hull is a sphere about the size of a basketball. Obviously
intended for making probes to check out potentially dangerous
environments. 

So I got to wondering about what would happen if a probe built using
such a hull turned up in Imperial space. Or maybe on the frontiers. 

It\'s *obviously* alien technology. Transparent except where the inside
is coated with something, indestructible, and with tantalizing glimpses
of alien devices inside.

Many, many possibilities for involving the players.

1. they find it
2. somebody else finds it, and hires the players to try to track it
   back to where it came from.
3. like 2, but they hire the players to help track it (ie the hirer
   goes with them)
4. Like 2, but it\'s an imperial agency or a megacorp.
5. like 4, but with a representative of the hirer on board, running the
   show.
6. ???

And just what it *is* has many possibilities too. Want to help flesh
this out a bit more?

Obviously, you *haven\'t* done much gambling. Craps and roulette are
about luck. Cards games are about skill. And a lot of forms of gambling
will pay off if you know how to best place your bets and when not to bet.

I\'d say it reflects knowledge of the rules, and of the *odds*. If both
of us know the rules, but I know the odds better than you, I can come
out ahead.

This is getting really strange.  I have my softcover open in front of me now,
and on page 142, in the upper left-hand column, under Animal Characteristics,
it states: 

"A indicates attack predisposition. A7 would indicate that the animal will
attack on a roll of 7-..."

I have checked page 144, and you are right, _there_ it gives the roll as 7+. 
This agrees with the numbers on the table on page 152.

However, if the number is to be equalled or exceeded, then the table on page
152 has some pretty brave grazers: 13+ to flee!  You just can\'t get this
number on a 1D-1 roll (as per the table on 152).

Just noticed, the table also has the atack/flee stats for animals 9-12 in the
wrong order: carnivores should test for attack first, and these have fleeing
listed first.

to explore them, but we might be able to assume that density increases as

be!) and that some crackpot theorists were able to predict that the Marches
would be the statistical center before it was proven to be so.

Not really. It depends on details. After all, according to existing
texts on magic from the middle ages, there were *two* main methods for
getting demons to do things for you. The easy on was to buy them off,
offer them something they wanted. Of course that tended to ensure a bad
end for you. The other method was to compel them to do your bidding by
invoking various holy names etc. That was harder to do, but as long as
you used them to perform actions that were moral, you didn\'t endanger
yourself spiritually. The "white" magician could also attempt to invoke
angelic aid, but that was a definite case of doing things to get there
attention and humbly hoping that they found you worthy of aid.

I once started on some rules for that sort of thing but decided that
it\'d make too many people uncomfortable. But *if* demons exist, the
same sources do list angels and *their* powers with almost the same
zeal and detail that they list those of demons. So they are equally
"correct" from a doctrinal point of view.

I\'d be the last to insist on someone doing something that made them
uncomfortable. That\'s why I dropped the rules idea. But it often pays
to careful examine *why* you are uncomfortable. And to question any
easy answers as to why.

Though the same sort of issues can show up, though they are less likely
to. Read James Blish\'s "A Case of Conscience" for a definitely SF story
dealing with a *religious* dilemma that grows out of contact with an
alien species. The whole thing is based on the simple question od
whether or not they have souls, and if they need saving.

I have a friend who considers herself a "fundamentalist" and considers
the people *known* by that term to have hijacked it. She rather wishes
they\'d all go jump off a bridge or something and quit giving the faith
a bad name.

Me, I\'m an agnostic. Unlike atheists, who are *certain* there\'s no god
(a belief that as much an expression of faith as any Christian\'s) I\'m
not certain. (Actually, I\'m a deist, but that term\'s not well known.
I\'m sure there\'s a God I\'m just not certain about the details)

I disagree whole heartedly, Joe.  I own a business, and most of my 
players are professionals.  We have careers and families to attend to.  
This is not like it was in High School when I could spend a week working 
on the adventure before my gaming group meets.  

I LIKE adventures that do as much work for the GM as possible.  I like to 
see pre-generated NPC\'s.  I want to see all the equipment detailed.  I 
want maps, diagrams, and deck plans.  Heck, I want the whole system 
detailed in case the adventure takes a spur to one of the outer planets.

If I don\'t like what is printed, I change it.  It is as simple as that.  
The difference is that I can choose how much work needs to be done before 
the session.

I\'ve been gaming long enough to recognize that there are many GMs out 
there who hold your view.  I submit that IG produces detailed adventures 
to satisfy people like me, but include a chapter with the more general 
information, for players like yourself.  This way, I believe we both can 
happy.

I also believe, that if Traveller is going to survive, IG needs to hit 
the market hard with published adventures.  GDW\'s problem was that it was 
supplement heavy--not enough adventures.  I love the supplements, but the 
adventures are what drives a game.  They encourage playing the game and 
not reading about the game.

It\'s elementary.  If you want a game to grow, you need people to play it. 
  What better way is there to intice people to play than to have some 
exciting, fast paced, well put-to-gether adventures?

I believe this is why TSR\'s AD&D is still the number one RPG around while 
GDW went out of business.

Kenneth.

Niko,

I haven\'t seen a lot of stuff on gambling other than what is detailed 
in the skill\'s description in the CT\\MT\\TNE\\T4 books, but the now out of 
print James Bond RPG by Victory Games had a dynamite system.  It is 
detailed, fast, and very simple to use.  I think it would be a great 
conversion for Traveller.

I\'ve got all the old James Bond stuff.  If you are interested in 
this, E-mail me at dreamer@brokersys.com, and I\'ll send you the basics to 
use for your conversion.

Great point, I\'m reminded that telephones had a similar response.  I\'ve got a 
reasonable well-developed "white-paper" on a world that is paralyzed by a 
similar problem regarding the import of off-world technology.  I haven\'t 
written any complete adventures for it, but the seeds are there.  There is 
conflict of all sort stemming from the "technibition"; the IISS is involved 
(and somewhat responsible), organized crime, megacorps, various political 
parties, etc.  Good stuff.

Interesting, almost all the Christians I know, myself included, balk at the 
label.  IMO, it represents an attitude wherein the letter of the law, so to 
speak, is emphasized over the spirit -- to the detriment of people.

Yep, my church is full of people wounded in churches like you describe.  
Happens all the time.

Me too, I think that attention to those details makes for a better game.

It took me a while to get there, as I was emotionally attached to GDW\'s

I believe the same thing. I would also add the *reason* for which Christ
died: to pay the penalty for the sins of His people, those who trust in Him
as Savior and Lord. My official label would read "Reformed
Presbyterian."

I guess I, as well, am guilty of generalizing based on labels. In my
experience (which is by no means, of course, exhaustive),
"fundamentalists" always meant those Christians who, while being true
believers, add a lot of extra rules, like "playing cards is evil," "movies are
evil," etc. Please forgive me for incorrectly labeling you that way.

Although it\'s not impossible. I\'ve just convinced my Pastor and the

I think we all need to be less judgmental until we have looked at all the
facts. I know why I don\'t play D&D, probably better than those Christians
who have picketed game stores. Why? Because I actually played the
game and examined it for myself. But I\'m not going to say that gaming in
general is evil--I rather enjoy it as a hobby. People shouldn\'t
over-generalize. It always gets them into trouble.

Joe,

Here\'s something else for your T4 errata:

Yesterday we started using the T4 rules in my ongoing Traveller 
campaign.  The mission was to travel from the main world to a station 
in the outer system for a bug hunt.  

I had a Traveller newbie starting with me, so, in an effort to teach him 
the system, I had him calculate the time it would take to travel from the 
main world to the outsystem station in our SDB.

I gave him the distance in km, the ship\'s G rating, and my copy of T4 
opened to the page with the travel formula.

It took the newbie some time, but he looked up with an answer.  73 days 
he said.  I immediately knew something was wrong, because I had already 
calculated it out to be 2.29 days.

So I looked at the travel formula.  Eventhough the formula is right as 
printed, IG left out the paragraph on converting the familiar units of 
space travel--like the G rating--to the units used in the formula.

GDW included this paragraph with the formula in the little CT 
Starships black book, the Traveller Book, Starter Traveller, and in MT\'s 
Referee\'s Companion.  It seems that it would have also been left in T4.

I see a problem with players new to Traveller using the interstellar 
formula.  Being a long time Traveller GM, I didn\'t notice it, but I think 
the conversion description is important to have in the next printing of 
T4--especially since any type of math scares a lot of people.

One more suggestion.  I think the formula in the MT Referee\'s Companion 
would be better suited in conjunction with the one already in T4.  The MT 
version is already calculated to produce T in hours, and the G rating of 
a ship does not have to be multiplied by 10.  This allows for minimal 
conversion on the part of the player.

Sincerely,

Kenneth.

No, thanks for telling it.  Your story reminds me of the passage in the Bible 
where Jesus and his guys were walking by a field of wheat and were hungry so 
they ate some wheat right off the stalks (which was not forbidden).  The 
religious-elites of the day got on their case and condemned them saying "you 
are breaking the sabbath law", which forbid them doing "work" on the sabbath 
day. 
Jesus later asked them which one of them would rescue one of their livestock 
if it fell in a pit on the sabbath day -- of course they all would, even 
though moving livestock was classified as "work" by their rules.
He said that the "sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath."
I think this is the biggest mistake we (meaning Christians, myself included) 
make towards people who believe and towards people who don\'t belileve.  We 
place the emphasis on the law over the people.  ie. we want people to serve 
the rules, not the rules to serve people.  Hmmm... sounds a little like the 
difference between folks on TML when it comes to "Canon" or not, eh?

One thought on this....  

Cleon had the vargr coreward--who wants to deal with the flakey vargr 
when you are starting an empire?  That type of contact can ruin a 
perfectly good empire from the inside out.  

He had the solomani rimward--better wait and deal with them after the 
empire is firmly established.  We don\'t want them getting any ideas about 
"The Rule of Man:  The Sequel". 

To trailing, Cleon faced the k\'kree.  This is like the Isralies.  Mess 
with their territory and they\'ll just kick your butt--no questions asked.

So what\'s left?  Spinward.  Spinward seperated into two areas of space by 
the claw.

Spinward/rimward you\'ve got the the aslan, but spinward/coreward is the 
unknown.  Zhodani contact was not made until 50.

I submit that Cleon had two primary goals for establishing the 3I.  The 
primary goal was to re-establish contact with all the worlds of the 
former Imperium.  Secondly, the Spinward Marches was the \'new world\'.  If 
your going to expand, then this is the place to do it.

Cleon probably wanted to get his hands on it, and then have the option to 
 either sell it (like France did with Louisiana) or develop it (like 
England did with the New England states).

There are tolerant people and there are intolerant people. I don\'t
think there\'s any real correlation between lever of tolerance
and religous belief - it just happens that in America, the intolerant
(largely right-wing) population happens to be Christian and they use
the Bible as their justification. Christians allso have a historical
tradition of "spreading the word" - thus their interest in making
you see the errors of your ways. Not all Christians are like this
though. I dunno, I\'ve learned a lot about religion in general since
meeting my wife (who is currently pursuing her MA in Religous Studies)
and if there\'s one thing I\'ve discovered, it\'s that people will use the
same words to describe two very different belief systems more often than
not. (I suppose I don\'t have much of a point, other than Christian
!= wacko fundie).

I\'d love to see some projections on the growth rate in the first century

Problem is, I dress up in funny costumes, too. I\'m in the SCA . . . and you can\'t

The American remake starred Bridgette Fonda, IIRC, but the title was not "The Assassin." 
Good movie, just caught it on teevee a few weeks ago, but I can\'t remember the title

You mean like how most NeoPagans have to live with the odium of the bad reputation of

I don\'t. Most of the practicing (church-going, active as opposed to

At the end of the book, the Kinunir that attacked _Vi Et Aramis_, _Royal Vengeance_, 
returned to Mexit in company of a _Midi Ashuguim_(sp) destroyer and one other ship that 
I believe was a Kinuinr as well, but I\'m unsure.

That makes more sense . . . . Solee is located near the center of the Old Expanses, 
IIRC, and the RC is centered in what was the Solomani frontier. The attack on Hitte, the 
future Nike Nimbus, was a classic example of a Black War raid. If it was a forward 
Solomani naval base, a Black War raid upon it would be logical.

I stopped playing D&D for two reasons. One: When TSR bought SPI out, I was a subscriber 
to SPI\'s magazine _Strategy and Tactics_. TSR chose to not honor the subs of SPI\'s 
customers. In fact, they offered me a "discount," asking me to pay once again for 
something I already had: a 3-year sub to S&T. I could not bear this insult to my 
intelligence, not to mention my wallet, so I wrote the Powers-that-Be at TSR at the time 
and told them that they have lost a customer -- for good, forever. I estimate that TSR 
lost thousands of dollars over the years in business from me in products I *didn\'t* buy. 
Two: I was growing uncomfortable with the emphasis on demonic opponents, too. I sensed 
something _wrong_, a vague feeling that I should look into other games. This was not 
driven by any kind of religious motivation . . . it was a \'I\'ve got a bad feeling about 
this . . .\' kind of a thing, and the emphasis on Opposition From (your choice of) Hell 
gave me a tag.

Lazarus Long said something like: You can\'t stop a man determined to be free . . . you 
can only kill him. Moms shy away from _that_ solution for good reason.

Again, To paraphrase RAH, from _Expanded Universe_: just beneath the surface of the 
American character, and as integral to it as as it\'s practicality, is a strain of 
irrationality. That strain thrives here. The California Central Valley, with the notable 
exception of islands of relative sanity like Chico and Sacramento (a college town and 
the state capitol), is as intolerant as the most red-necked regions of the storied 
American South, and it is getting worse. Relocation IS in my future . . . as soon as my 
daughter starts college (fall \'99), I\'m OUTTA HERE!

My NeoPagan friends had the same problems in college; certain elements of the Christian 
Fellowship tried to get the school\'s Pagan Club banned from campus under similar grounds 
. . . fortunately, the Bay Area is another region where a degree of sanity prevails, and 
it was a college, where different standards apply.

Can you say "stereotype"? I knew you could! While there are Christians who fit the 
stereotype -- the seductive thing about stereotypes is that they are accurate for at 
least some of the people so-grouped -- _You_ are not part of the stereotype.

My local problems come from fundimentalist Christians who fit the stereotype closely, 
and from the silent majority who goes along with them, not from ALL Christians.

There\'s also the "big lie" phenomenon: repeat something long enough, it becomes \'truth.\'
I\'m referring to the _misconceptions_, not to ANYONE\'s belief system. [The previous 
sentence was brought to you by the Nomex Co, makers of flame-proof underwear.] Repeat 
the misconceptions enough, they eventually become truth.

_I_ care about _my_ faith (NeoPagan), and in the interests of comity in a world where my 
religion is a minority -- not to mention my interest in self-preservation -- I _have_ to 
listen. No insult taken, or meant. This is a reasoned discussion, right?

I\'ve _never_ heard this as the reason that religious groups attack RPGs, but it makes a

This is an outstanding point.  But, I see this as the increased 
importance of the Spinward Marches, because Cleon didn\'t even know about 
the zhos until 50 when first contact was made.  Since Cleon died just 3 
years later (referring to the MT Imperial Encyclopedia), I don\'t see that 
this had any impact on Cleon\'s policy.  See my post from earlier today 
for my opinion on what Cleon\'s policy was.

But...

I do think that this was a major concern for Cleon II and Artemsus.  
Remember that Cleon II, after abdicating from the thrown in favor of his 
chancellor Artemsus, "spent the rest of his long, active, colorful, and, 
from all accounts, happy, life on the frontier as a self-appointed and 
extremely effective one-man fire brigade".

I\'d say that the zhos scared the hell out of Cleon II.  He decided that 
he could do more for the Imperium on the front line rather than as the 
emperor--a classic example of the "Admiral Kirk-Captain Kirk" syndrome at 
work.

This sounds like a very good idea IMHO.  Now I really would be interested

Complaining about the errors is one way of dealing with them (sorry, but 
I had to say that).  I\'d really like to start my Traveller campaign but 
this annoying rulebook is just not enough (and no, I don\'t have 20 years 
of Traveller experience under my belt and would like to use the official 
background since otherwise I\'d use a better system if I had a to design 
my own background -- CORPS for example).

Make this \'new refs to Traveller\' and I\'d fit the bill.  I have been 
GMing for over a dozen years (13? 15?  Gee, I\'m getting old) and don\'t 
mind making judgment calls.  I just hate having to improvise when I want 
to use the official background and just making up things probably will 
create my own personal hell when finally Milieu 0 is published.

I\'d rather run a SF campaign with a better rule system (CORPS e.g.) than 
right now trying to make sense of the little tidbits I received in the 
Traveller rulebook and having to invalidate half of it just to be 
remotely compatible with the official stuff.

Since IG is trying to re-establish Traveller it\'s very sad that I and 
probably many other \'Traveller newbies\' are having this problem.  I 
really wonder how many newbies quickly will drop Traveller once more due 
to frustration about the patched rulebook.

The problem is that -- as far as I can see -- the experienced Traveller 
players were not numerous enough for some years to provide a broad enough 
fan base to support a company producing the game.  I don\'t think this has 
changed a lot although I might be wrong.

I wouldn\'t call 3000 hardcovers plus softcovers a small print run (yes, 
TSR is doing 10000 printings or so of a product, but TSR s playing some 
leagues above IG).  The problem with this is, that Traveller newbies like 
me might fee tempted to play the game, buy the rules and are pretty 
disappoint.  Result: rules will be stashed away in a rather remote corner 
and the game most probably does not get a second chance.  Very bad for IG.

I hope that it will be possible to return the patchwork available right 
now for a revised rulebook :-(  It\'s really of little use for me (except 
for thinking "oh well, it could have been so great... such a shame") and 
I\'d be pretty annoyed at having to buy another softcover simply because 
IG decided to alpha-test the rules in the public.

Absolutely not.  I\'m helping one of my professors right now to finish his 
first (500+ pages) book and I know how much pain flows into such a 
venture.  I\'m giving IG a second chance (I also subscribed to JTAS a few 
months ago), but if the next supplement is again in such a miserable 
state, they\'ll lose another customer.

> In the long term everything will be OK.

I just hope that IG is able to survive till \'the long run\' pays for them.

Starting with a bad reputation for miserable product quality can yield an 
untimely death.  I really hope that this won\'t happen, but IMHO it was a 
pretty big mistake to release the rulebook in the shape it is right now.

Right now I\'m considering something like 5 for generally peaceful 
animals, 7 for moderately aggressive animals and 9 for dangerous 
predators with a +/-1 adjustment depending on the individual beast.  
Nonetheless I\'d still like to know the official rule :-)

I believe that this is the majority of the skill.  I play poker 
regularly, but I have drawn on this skill in many other 
instances--both gambling related and not.

Figuring the odds, deciding how a player will play, gauging your 
chances to win based on the other players, and other general aspects of 
poker are easily adaptable to any other gambling game--even if you are 
only playing against a dealer.  I draw on this when I go to a casino.

But, knowing poker is much more than just playing cards.  Skill at poker 
is skill at negotiation, skill at sizing up opponents, skill at winning, 
skill at calling someone\'s bluff.  These are things that happen every day 
in real life--not in a poker game.

Many top business executives and politicians play poker.  Look at your 
history book.  Truman was a master poker player.

Of course, this has some impact on the skill.  It is always beneficial if 
you know the game.

Take 5 card stud and 7 card stud.  On the face of it, they are both poker 
games and pretty similar.  One you get one card down and four up.  The 
other you get three cards down and four up.  In both, you are trying to 
make the best five card hand.

But, a good poker player will know that the average winning hand in 7 
card stud is three of a kind, and in 5 card stud, it is a pair.  This is 
knowing the game.

Just as important are the generalities, though--the things that you can 
apply to any game no matter if you know the game or not. 

For instance, in both 5 and 7 card stud, your chances of winning are 
directly influenced by how many people are playing.  The more people 
playing, the better hand you have to have to win.  

I said that the average winning hand in 7 card stud is 3 of a kind.  If 
you\'ve got 3 of a kind and are playing with 3 other people, then your 
chances of winning are pretty good depending on what is showing and how 
the others have been playing.  But, if you\'ve got 3 of a kind, and you 
are playing against 5 to 6 others, then your little 3 of a kind isn\'t 
that good after all.  Chances are that someone out there has a straight, 
flush, or full house.    

In sum, what I\'m trying to say is that, yes, I agree that knowing a game 
is a good sized portion of the gambling skill.  But, more importantly, 
skill at gambling can be used in a variety of situations whether it be 
winning at a game the character has never played before or gauging his 
success at pulling off a bluff with the spaceport customs official.

It was just an \'OK\' movie--two out of five stars.  The original was "La

I find that half the fun of games is the interaction of the Players. I
find that those Folks who want a tuff well fought game are prime Targets
for the old mind fu**. They play to win and I play them for yucks. Sure
I lose but it sure is fun. This is not a plan that works all the time
for all games or all players just an alternitive to winning.

I\'ll come right out and say it: I don\'t use the travel formula.  Now that 
that is out of the way, would I be incorrect in saying that the final 
paragraph on page 98 has the information you are looking for in it?  I 
honestly don\'t know, since I never have used the travel formula.

In my letter to IG, I did recommend that this information (the final 
paragraph on page 98) be moved to Chapter 9 (p. 115), so that all this 
information is in the same location.  (Er, actually, I recommended that 
everything from p 96\'s "Starship Economics" to the end of chapter 8 be 
moved to Chapter 9 - it seems to make more sense to group all that info 
together.)

Anyway, I hope this helps.  And, whether I am right or wrong about the 
info you need, please let me know!

Thanks,

It\'s interesting just how much mis-information is propogated through

(Paul, from the sound of things you don\'t need my moral support but since you 
hinted so loudly...)

First off, I do not share Paul\'s beliefs.  I was raised in the Jewish faith, but 
do not practice any form of organized religion.  I believe in evolution, not 
creationism, and, while I do believe that there is something out there be it 
fate, kizmet, God, destiny, a higher power of whatever sort, that higher power 
and I are going to have to work things out between ourselves without any 
rituals, prayers, etc.  I am what I am and I try to be a good person and 
he/she/it will just have to judge me by that.

That said, I am also pretty leary of anyone who is very religious.  Much of my 
experience with strongly religious people has been that they tend to spout what 
they hear from ministers, etc. as gospel without any thought of their own.  Paul 
has proven to give the Bible thought and is willing to and has given 
interpretations of his own.  Paul has my respect for that, and is one of very 
few I\'d be willing to have a second discussion about religion with.  (I\'ll have 
a first discussion about *anything* with anyone, but....).

(Ok, Paul, was that what you wanted?  <g>)

Ah, my mistake - I misunderstood you.  

Actually, your theory as stated above is more realistic anyway - people 
(including me!) generally do like and dislike things for "gut-level" 
reasons more often than one might expect.  A lot of times, when someone 
tells me the reason they like or dislike something, they end up 
rationalizing their feeling after the fact.

Good point.  I have not seen any solid evidence of this ever happening 
either.

I agree that it\'s a a behavior that would be associated with an "adult" 
attitude - too bad more adults don\'t behave that way, though. :)

Still, the problem remains: what do you do when an adult goes up against 
a kid in a competitive game like Magic: The Gathering?  If the adult 
wins, the kid may be upset.  If the adult wins and gloats...what do you 
do? 

Should they have officials all over the place checking for gloating, and 
ejecting gloaters from the convention?

It\'s a thorny issue.

Rob,

I don\'t think we\'re in disagreement.  T4, as-is, is NOT something I would 
give a new gamer.  There are too many errors, and too much stuff you\'d 
have to figure out on your own.  

T4, once it is error-free, WILL be something for new gamers.

The main T4 rule book, now and in the future, is NOT for hard-core 
Traveller players either.  That\'s what the book "levels" will bring 
about.  Basic stuff will have red lettering on the spine, intermediate 
stuff will have...yellow? I forget...and advanced stuff (the new 
FF&S/Naval Archetect\'s Handbook, for instance) will have a third color 
(sorry, I\'ve forgotten the colors already!).

So, I don\'t think we\'re in disagreement.


> IG, you\'ve got a great new product on your hands.

See?  Total agreement. :)

Thanks for reminding me of the Forever Hero stuff - I was going nuts trying

seen it yet - could you email me a list of titles?

Also, Foster\'s Flinx series has aspects I\'ve nicked for my campaign.

And any number of histories about the Roman or Byzantine Empire, with a
little fall of the Czars thrown in as well.

I don\'t have much to say in this argument, but since Paul wanted a 
character reference:  Paul and I discussed religion on the IRC #traveller 
channel one night (and why aren\'t you folks on there more often? :), and 
I found him to be on stiff-necked son-of-a-gun.

Just kidding.  Paul and I talked about fundamentalist dogma a bit, and 
he\'s open-minded.  I was impressed that he researched various religions 
before deciding on the Baptist church.  He told me that he doesn\'t agree 
with everything they teach (ie, the official Baptist stance on dance is 
that all forms are evil; all rock-and-roll is evil (even Christian 
rock-and-roll); women wearing pants is wrong; etc.). 

Paul has an open mind, and approaches religion intelligently.

I appreciate the apology, but I really didn\'t take it as being

Huh. So it does!

Looks to me like p. 142 should be changed to reflect what is said on p 
144, and the reference on p 144 should be dropped.

Although I still strongly advocate going to a X- system throughout the 
book, which would mean instead dropping the stuff on p. 144 and updating 
the Animal Characteristics Table (and the Regina example) accordingly.

Looks like we have a mix-n-match system right now.  This should 
definitely be corrected!

In the edited verson of T4 I sent to Ken Whitman today, I did note the 
problem with the Encounter Table for Regina, by the way.

Thanks for spotting that error, Rob!

Kenneth,

I guess we\'ll just have to disagree then.   I have a professional career

Hmmm.  I want that, too.  That\'s what I meant.  I just don\'t want every 
encounter mapped out before-hand.  If you have the old GDW-published CT 
adventures, take a look - that\'s what I want.  Lots of background, NPC 
stats, maps, deck plans, and all the other necessities.  But they give 
you an overview of the adventure, not a step-by-step process for running 
it (i.e., players start at A, then go to B, then C, then D - with no 
provision for going from A to D, or D to A for that matter).  Give the 
details about the situation and background, and my group will work the 
rest out.

I just can\'t stand adventures that expect me to herd the PC\'s from place 
to place to suit some author\'s story line.

Maybe we aren\'t disagreeing after all.

Thomas,

Right.  There are relatively few Traveller players out there right now.

I wouldn\'t have either - except that the sofcovers sold out almost 
immediately, and there are only about 300 hardcovers left.

Clearly, demand is exceeding supply.  No one knows how many more 
Traveller rulebooks are in demand right now...but I would guess that, 
once word gets out there (after all, there has been no advertisement at this 
point - a ton of RPGers don\'t even know there is a new Traveller out -- 
or even what Traveller /is/!), there will be a demand for about twice the 
number that has already been sold, and these will be sold over the next year 
(conservative estimate). 

Sound unreasonable?

If not, consider what that means:  within a little over a year, the 
owners of the first printing will be only 1/3 of all those who purchased 
Traveller...and that percentage will just continue to shrink as IG sells 
more and more T4 rulebooks over time.

I think IG\'s first printing of T4 will only lose them customers who they 
never really had in the first place.  That is, those who weren\'t serious 
about getting into T4 anyway.  The game-of-the-week crowd, if you will.

Those who are serious about it should be able to work around all the 
errors - except for the missing jump-drive table, which they can get by 
either going to IG\'s web site or getting the errata sheet (which I assume 
IG will distribute to game stores shortly - an errata sheet was included 
with the hardbound copies that went out recently).

I\'d love to be able to turn my books back in as well...but I\'d settle for 
being able to /buy/ a hardcover copy of the revised rules.  I want a 
perfect copy of T4 so badly I can taste it.  (Thus the long hours spent 
cutting and pasting itty-bitty labels to make corrections in my hardbound 
copy.)

I hope they don\'t lose you as a customer.  

As I\'ve said before, I\'ll give IG two more chances.  If Starships is in 
bad shape, I\'ll let it slide.  But if CSC comes out with loads of errors, 
I\'m outta here.  I\'ll be using CT.

But I really don\'t think I\'ll have to follow through on that pledge.  The 
people who run and work for IG are /not/ the type of people who put out 
slipshod product because they don\'t care.  T4 was a victim of the (now 
well-known) circumstances extant during its "birth."

Your description falls just a little short. The hull is not truly
indestructible...in one of Niven\'s stories, one such hull disintegrates
upon coming in contact with antimatter (admittedly somewhat rare in
Core). Also, the hull is/can be made transparent (at time of
manufacture)
to non-visible light frequencies and all versions are most definitely
transparent to gravitons (one crew was crushed to paste when they got a
little too close to the gravity waves of a neutron star).

The Ringworld RPG, published by Chaosium, gives a pretty good
description
of hull armor effects, etc. It may be worth looking up a copy for
conversion.  Then again, with Runequest and Call of Cthulu supplying low
tech and psi rules, why convert...whoa, now there\'s a thought (light

Well kiss my sweet bejeezus, there it sits on page 98.  

When I was looking at the travel formula on page 115, I should have 
thought to skip back 17 pages, to the chapter before, to find the 
information that describes the formula.

What in the world was IG thinking?

Anyway, thanks for the info, Joe.

I\'ve got two more questions for you.  The first is put forth in my post 
titled "It seems impossible...".   What are you thoughts there?

The second topic is that, if you don\'t use the travel formula, what do 
you use.  I\'d like to hear your replacement.

Regards,

Kenneth.

Take a look at I, Claudius and Claudius the God (Books by R Graves)

figured this whole empire thing would pass after the first emperor finished restoring the

The answer is:

In the adventure entitled "Demon Dark", through one plot vehicle or
another, an intrepid band of adventurers are led to mate airlocks with
a 200 year old derelict Close Escort called the Gina Bounder. To quote
the adventure, "As the PCs explore the Gina Bounder...a malicious and
powerful psionic being from the time of the Ancients was awakened...."

This thing was nothing less than a Terminator 2-type android designed
specifically to annihilate human servants of rival Droyne factions
during
the Ancients\' Final War. The crew of the Gina Bounder brought it onboard
when they picked up some Ancient artifacts for transport back to a Navy
base for study.  The "demon" had *all* psi abilities, including the ones
normally available only to Droyne, plus the "Special" of being able to
generate a field which absorbed all visible light...including lasers up
to TL12! All this in addition to high levels of Strength, Dexterity,
Unarmed Combat, and Tactics, and decent levels of Stealth and Zero-G 
combat. Even if the airlocks weren\'t mated, the d**n thing could
teleport
using Telepathy/Clairvoyance to find the location of the PCs\' crew and,
thereby, their ship (and did).

Take the Ultimate Psionic Nightmare, mix it with Arnold Swarzenegger and
Bruce Lee, and set it loose on a group of unsuspecting PCs...get the
idea?

I should think its not accurate to stereotype RPG\'ers.  Yes, RPG\'s aren\'t
widely accepted but that, I think, is because most people don\'t understand
what Roleplaying is. Even so, the Gamer defy\'s definition in many ways.  I\'m
a straight A student, never did drugs, and never been in the trouble that
many associate with Gamer\'s.  The only thing that is Truly common between
Gamers I think is keen imagination and the love for the game.  Without
imagination you can\'t really play and without love for the game most won\'t
play anyway.  IMHO 8^]

Time out!  The "spewed" thing is Stu\'s standard line... our e-mail 
reader allows you to customize how the quote is preceded... this is 
merely his sense of humor and applies to posts he is applauding as 
well as anything he\'s being critical of... if you don\'t believe me 
watch his other posts.

Well...duh!  What made you think it wouldn\'t be under, "Trade Customs," 
anyway? :)

But seriously...

If you look on page 113 (chapter 8), you\'ll se that the Travel Formulae 
table appears there as well as on page 115 (chapter 9).  Which, along 
with other clues, leads me to believe....

> What in the world was IG thinking?

IG either had the computer file from GDW that contained the contents of 
The Traveller Book (it would almost certainly have been in a different 
format - not MS-DOS - but there are companies who transfer files from old 
computer disk formats/program formats to new ones), or they had someone 
type in the entire Traveller Book contents.  Then, they took that and 
modified it as necessary to make it into T4.

Evidence:  Portions (paragraphs, sections, almost entire chapters) are 
word-for-word from the Traveller Book, some modified slightly (and some 
in need of slight modification in order to fit with the new rules).

In the context in which T4 was created (short time frame, new company 
with people trying to learn how to work together effeciently, last-minute 
fan-demanded (and supplied!) changes, etc.), some of this stuff was put 
in the wrong section, some was never modified appropriately, some appears 
twice (the Animal Characteristics stuff recently noted by Rob Prior, and 
the Travel Formulae), etc.

But, that\'s just my totally baseless theory.  I wasn\'t there, and no one 
at IG has said anything at all on this subject.

Uh...I must have missed that one.  Care to e-mail me a copy, and I\'ll 
reply to the list?  I\'m sorry I missed it now!  Sometimes I go through 
these hundred-odd emails I get every day and use the delete key a bit 
more freely than I should. :(

Well....(sheepish grin)...we just role-played it.  No worry about the 
time...we just figured it was a few hours to get from jump point to 
starport, and vice-versa, and didn\'t worry about it.  Other than that, 
interplanetary travel just didn\'t come up.  We had combats in space, but 
most often the action took place on a world\'s surface, or in the 
starport.  That was just our style...

OK, here we go.

Sunday, I converted my 7 player, year long (so far), Traveller campaign
over to the new T4 rule system.  Before, I was using a house system based
on TNE but using D6 dice and the MT task system (It is just WRONG to use
any other dice with Traveller--percentile and D20 dice are for other
systems--and I don\'t care if the D6 system is a bell curve whereas % and
D20 are linear--I grew up with Traveller being D6, and I like it that
way).

It was a pretty easy conversion from our house system, and I must say, on
the surface, I like what IG has done in T4.  TNE had some great ideas,
especially for long time, detail oriented, gamers like myself, but the
system was just too hard and clunky to run.  I believe that the gods are
in the details, but there is something to be said for playability.  TNE
wasn\'t very playable.

When T4 came out, I was ecstatic.  I yearned for Traveller\'s return to
its roots.  I missed using the old black books and supplements.  So, I
bought T4 the second day it was available at my local gaming store here
in Houston and set about changing our house system to that detailed in
T4.

Sunday, yesterday, was the first use of the new system, and I HATE to say
it, but something just doesn\'t seem right.

We were on this SBD, out system from the main world.  The characters had
been \'drafted\' by the local Imperial Marines for a bug hunt.  The main
world was only TL4, and the four Marines were unlucky enough to have been
in the system (SBD with an attached jump shuttle) whent the distress call
came from the station on the outer fringes of the system.  The characters
were drafted to boost their numbers, and off they went.

Upon reaching the station, they found the destruction of a ship and
several dead bodies (the race has never been seen before) floating around
the station--which was also on minimal power and had taken a tremendous
amount of damage.

The task at this point was to space walk to the station, crack the hull,
and begin exploring for answers.  One of my players wanted to find out
more about the unidentified aliens, and he suggested space walking to one
of the larger sections of the destroyed ship to see if he could somehow
salvage any information from the alien computer.

This character has computer-4 and Edu 9.  That gives him a target number
of 13.

Given the condition of the destroyed ship--there were just pieces of it
floating around, but they were large enough to walk around in to expore
sections of the hull and several decks--I decided that this had to be an
impossible throw.

I was horrified when I realized what the character had to throw for
success.  The average of 4 D6 is 14--50% of the time, 14 or less will be
thrown.  The character\'s target number was 13--ON AN IMPOSSIBLE THROW!

One of my players teaches math, and he worked out the percentage.  There
is a 44% chance that 13 or less will be thrown on 4 dice.

C\'mon, guys, you\'ve got to be kidding.  Yes, the character had a great
skill, but level 4 is not that unheard of.  A 9 Edu is even more common.
 I agree, the character was above average with his stats, BUT TO HAVE A
44% CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING ON AN IMPOSSIBLE THROW JUST DOES NOT SEEM RIGHT.

Yes, I could have added in some additional DMs because of the damage to
the ship (read:  to lower the character\'s chance of success), but that is
redundant with regard to the difficulty levels.

To me, the high chance of success seems impossible.

So, what do all of you think about this?

Two parts on this one:

1. We owe it to the hobby to provide entry venues for kids, to provide
appropriate levels of competition, to support young people and to direct
them toward good role models for their gaming (and doubly so those of us who
are parents)

2.  Having said that, if I understand the original post correctly, what we
had there was a PARENTING problem.  There are lots of games where kids face
off against adults (Bridge and Chess come immediately to mind).  Correct me
if I am wrong, but I have the impression that (a) the governing
organizations have checks and balances to keep kids out of adult competition
unless they are genuinely ready for it and (b) parents of kids involved in
such "serious" activities understand the obligation THEY have to prepare
their children for the inevitable disappointment they will face -- because
everyone loses someday.

We don\'t have (a) in our hobby.  Unfortunately, most parents have no
understanding of any part of gaming or of what their kids are doing in it,
so for the most part we ain\'t got no (b) neither.


Ah, well: at least RPG\'s are the least competitive of the forms.
Personally, I started as a wargamer.  I learned to lose gracefully as a
gamer.  Knock me over and I will gather three men and a dog for a last
stand; wipe me out and I will THANK you for the wonderful tactical and
strategic lessons you have taught me.  But it took a LONG time to learn how
to do that.  Thank God I played with a nice bunch of folks.

For the record, I\'m NOT introducing my sons to gaming: if they discover it
for themselves later, fine.  (Now where was that fire-proof suit :-)

Warning!  Reply-Rant to Follow... :)

You\'re right, Brad.  The sad thing is, most people seem to be unable to 
use their imaginations other than in a limited fashion.  

The person who taught me Spanish in the 9th and 11th grades, John Connally 
(from whom I picked up a several phrases - you may catch me saying 
"something along these lines" every once in a while; I get that from 
him:), repeated to us several times that imagination must be exercised, 
or it will be lost.  (This may seem like a strange thing for a teacher 
of the Spanish language to be emphasizing, but Mr. Connally was a wise 
man, and he didn\'t let the official subject matter restrain him from 
imparting a broad range of knowledge to those who would listen.)  He 
told us to never let our imaginations wither, and lamented the fact that 
most adults have allowed theirs to die.

Another factor working against us - making us weird, in fact, just as 
having imagination does - is our ability to enjoy learning and using 
complex systems.  Look at these "games" we play!  Technical and/or 
complex subjects are part and parcel of what we do (and it\'s not just 
Traveller - SJG has put out some scholarly works on various subjects as 
supplements to the GURPS game; Hero Systems did a fine job of explaining 
Corporations in their supplement of that name; and, well, heck, any game 
that requires reading 200+ pages is going to be looked upon as being 
unworthy of the effort by most people).  

Each of us who referees, no matter what style of game we play, is able 
to keep a lot of rules in mind, read more pages in a month than the 
average American reads in...a year? a lifetime?, balance the wants and 
needs of several participants, keep many different plots/sub-plots in 
mind, act out many different personalities....whew!  I could go on and 
on, but you already know all this stuff.  

The average person doesn\'t /want/ to "work" for his fun.  Okay, I take 
that back.  There are a lot of people who are very happy working 
/physically/ during their diversionary activities, but very, very few 
want to work /mentally/ during times of relaxation.

Because we have imagination, and because we exercise our minds, we are in 
fact very atypical.  We are unusual.  We are, quite simply, weird.

If that\'s what they mean when they say it is weird to play RPGs, then I\'m 
happy to be weird.

>>How did you get started in gaming?<<

I began much the same as everyone else: with AD&D.  I met another girl in my
Latin class (of all things) in college who happened to have the main books
with her between classes.  Within weeks I was gaming with a mostly female
group, the games run by a woman.

Back then I had only one other experience with GMs, and that was with a
fellow who thought that it was standard procedure -- nay, a requisite -- that
all female PCs be raped at least once per game.  Needless to say, we never
invited him to repeat his "guest DM" role again.  And it made me shy away
from expanding into other gaming groups for many years.  (Not that I was
traumatized -- I just didn\'t feel like exposing myself to the stupidity.)

Happily, I have met other male GMs since this time that have shown me that
the dork mentioned above was somewhat of an exception and not the rule.
 Though I have heard stories from other, embittered female gamers out there
of multiple disappointments of this magnitude and worse during their gaming
careers.  Perhaps another reason you don\'t see so many?

The main GM in our group once confided to me (of running games for his
college friends in the past) that the adding of female gamers into a group of
otherwise crass, testosterone-pumped Southern "good ole boys" made running a
game more bearable as it tended to cut down on the belching and farting and
beer-spitting wars and make them behave themselves with some decorum -- in
AND out of character.

Of course, we\'re all older, now, and know better....  ;)  Our ages range from
37 down to a tender 25.  The last 21 year-old (going on 14) that played for a
short time (who never did get the fact that noone else in the group thought
belching, farting and munchkinism were a fun and requisite part of the game)
was invited to leave, but we try not to discriminate against potential new
players based on age.

Our main GM has expressed an interest in getting some other female gamers
into the group, but there just seems to be a scarcity of us out here, as
well.

As for social acceptance....  Gaming is still considered geeky even here in
Los Angeles, and it\'s best not to mention it as a hobby lest you be forced to
explain in detail what it is all about to someone who really doesn\'t care,
anyway.  My parents never expressed any dismay in the fact that I and two of
my siblings played RPGs, even though they didn\'t necessarily approve of the
friends we made through it all the time.

The bulk of my own friends are gamers, writers/artists and computer geeks,
and I have little exposure to social situations beyond gaming.  It\'s almost a
phobia!  :)  And I vacation yearly at GenCon.  Should I seek professional
help?  ;)

And *that\'s* more than anyone needed to know, I am sure.

I have noticed an increase in females running about GenCon and the local
gaming conventions, and I am taking this as a positive sign that perhaps the
ratio of female to male gamers will increase.  Of course, it could just be
that the teens playing CCGs bring their little girlfriends along for moral
support....  :P  Only time will tell.

Happily a gaming geek,

Niko

I took it to mean that you could get +1 Psi to your Psionics 
characteristic, but the maximum is 12 if the character is over 18 (which, 
unless the circumstances are very special and referee-sanctioned, should 
always be the case for player characters).  That is, if you get a 
character with a Psi score of 8, s/he can increase that level to a 
maximum of 12 during the character generation process.

At least, that\'s how I\'ll be handling it.

were drafted to boost their numbers, and off they went.

Upon reaching the station, they found the destruction of a ship and
several dead bodies (the race has never been seen before) floating around
the station--which was also on minimal power and had taken a tremendous
amount of damage.

The task at this point was to space walk to the station, crack the hull,
and begin exploring for answers.  One of my players wanted to find out
more about the unidentified aliens, and he suggested space walking to one
of the larger sections of the destroyed ship to see if he could somehow
salvage any information from the alien computer.

This character has computer-4 and Edu 9.  That gives him a target number
of 13.

Given the condition of the destroyed ship--there were just pieces of it
floating around, but they were large enough to walk around in to expore
sections of the hull and several decks--I decided that this had to be an
impossible throw.

I was horrified when I realized what the character had to throw for
success.  The average of 4 D6 is 14--50% of the time, 14 or less will be
thrown.  The character\'s target number was 13--ON AN IMPOSSIBLE THROW!

One of my players teaches math, and he worked out the percentage.  There
is a 44% chance that 13 or less will be thrown on 4 dice.

C\'mon, guys, you\'ve got to be kidding.  Yes, the character had a great
skill, but level 4 is not that unheard of.  A 9 Edu is even more common.
 I agree, the character was above average with his stats, BUT TO HAVE A
44% CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING ON AN IMPOSSIBLE THROW JUST DOES NOT SEEM RIGHT.

Yes, I could have added in some additional DMs because of the damage to
the ship (read:  to lower the character\'s chance of success), but that is
redundant with regard to the difficulty levels.

To me, the high chance of success seems impossible.

So, what do all of you think about this?

Kenneth.

Yup.  If it\'s Impossible, it really should be Impossible.  Or, if we\'re 
granting that it is an RPG, and the needs of an exciting story call for 
charcters to be able to do seven impossible things before 
breakfast...okay, we find a better chance than 0% for the worst case 
scenario task roll.  Maybe 10%?  20%?  

The problem is that D6 bell curve that neither you nor I care to get rid 
of in our Traveller games.  When IG decided to adjust the # of dice 
thrown (rather than the target number) in response to the difficulty of the 
task to be achieved, they set themselves on a path toward a system that 
has no extremely difficult tasks - for those who are highly skilled with 
moderate characteristics, or moderately skilled with high characteristics.

They could have solved this (to a degree) by requiring the use of 1/2 
characteristic+skill to determine the target number, as some TMLers have 
said they will do (though you may want to adjust the # of dice as well, 
in that case).  

Me?  I\'m just going to use it as-is.  In their specialties, characters 
are going to do great.  Outside of those specialties, they\'ll still have 
a chance...but not a great one (unless they have an awesome characteristic, 
and are performing a task related to that characteristic).  I like this 
heroic style of role-playing.

It\'s more of a James Bond approach than a hard-science approach, that\'s 
for sure.  Perhaps you could try the 1/2 characteristic approach?

Actually, you\'re both sorta right.

\'Science\' works by disproving things.  A scientific theory is \'proved\' by
failing to disprove it after exhaustive efforts to do so.  What makes demons,
angels, God, and many other beliefs nonscientific is that there is no way to
prove that these beings don\'t exist.  (I\'ve always felt Thomas to be the
patron saint of scientists: the other apostles believed, but Thomas wanted
proof.)

Dragging a Traveller angle back in here (and NOT trying to open a debate
about personal beliefs), look at the Archaen Theory/Solomani Hypothesis. 
Rich Sezov shows that you can be technologically sophisticated while
disagreeing with some fundamental theories of biology.  Arguing that humans
must have evolved on Earth because of the fossil record wouldn\'t cut any ice
with Rich\'s many-times-removed descendant.

Rich: could you project your church\'s possible reaction(s) to established
Traveller history?  Ie. what happens when humans (Vilani) are discovered
around Barnard\'s Star?  What about when Terrans encounter their first true
alien?  I have a fairly good idea what the official Anglican reaction would
be, and I know how the Baptist church I attended would react, but I\'m curious
about you and your church.  Either of these events could make for some
interesting roleplaying with a group secure enough in their beliefs to play
with possibilities.

Kenneth,

I have been keeping up with these posts about the "push to the Marches" by
Cleon, and I think this is the best explanation yet.  This makes very good
sense.  Thanks for a well reasoned post.

Been there, done that.  Back in high school I played in a D&D game run by an
Anglican priest.  He held our clerics to medieval Christian standards of
morality, or they stopped being granted spells.  COme to that, we got more
experience points for capturing bandits (so they could be hung after a fair
trial) than we did for killing them.  Best D&D game I\'ve ever played in.

I have but a few more thoughts to add.

Someone else has touched on this, and I thought I would expand on it a bit.

Folks, I\'m afrain that part of the problem is misplaced zeal.  Let me explain...

My wife\'s grandparents are the pastor and wife of our church.  Grandmother
is a very religously zealous person.  She believes as I mentioned before and
adds the one point that Rich made earlier about the reason Christ came being
to save the world from sin.  (BTW, I agree with this too, Rich :)  Now she
is from an old fundamentalist background, and she also believes that it is
wrong for women to wear pants or slacks.  (Please do not ask, I don\'t agree
with that belief and I can\'t explain it! :)  Anyway, her zeal about what she
believes is often misplaced.  If a lady comes to our church to visit wearing
pants, "unsaved" and "bound for Hell"  she would likely tell them something
about the pants.  Now her heart\'s desire is right, she wants to help this
woman, but her zeal is misplaced.  If she would have concentrated on the
more important part, then the other would have followed (I\'m using her
belief structure here, the thought is that God would convict her of pants
once she was "saved").

Now, how does this apply to RPG\'s?  Well, I think some of the attack on
RPG\'s and especially the attack on players is simply due to a misplaced
zeal.  The attacker feels that they are doing something that is right, and
therefore attacks the RPG or RPGer, when the issue (according to their own
beliefs) that they should be more concerned with is the person\'s "eternal
destiny."  Please, no one misinterpret, I\'m not trying to preach at anyone,
just trying to explain a possible motivation.

There is even an example of this in the Bible.  Perhaps one of the most
famous New Testament Character\'s id Paul the Apostle.  He spent years as
Saul of Tarsus persecuting Christians thinking he was doing what God wanted
him to do.  Then one day, God appeared to him in a blinding light while he
was on his way to persecute more Christians.  God basically told him that
what he had thought was God\'s will was, in fact, not what God wanted at all.
The point of the story is the same whether you believe it to be a true event
or a fable.  Sometimes people get their zeal misplaced.

Now, in an effort, albeit weak, to bring this back to topic, what types of
religons would be common at the onset of the 3I, both within the
Imperium/Federation and without?

PS - anyone wanting to continue the previous discussion with me, feel free
to eMail me and I\'d be hapy to discuss.  (I try not to argue though. :)

"The Vargr Campaigns: 210-348" It took them a while, but they made it.
:)
The Vargr are so close to Vland that Cleon has to deal with them one
way or another, sooner or later. There are a serious number of worlds
in the Vland sector with Vargr names (a bunch are listed in _Flaming
Eye_).
I think the Vargr are unavoidable, regardless of which way the empire
expands.

Hm. True.

The Imperium may not have got along with the K\'kree on a cultural level,
but I don\'t see how the K\'kree could possibly have withstood a serious
Imperial military advance. The raw amount of metal and empty space that
K\'kree ships/vehicles have to haul around would make them pretty 
inefficient in combat.

The Vilani have always had a "take no prisoners policy", I doubt they
would
have balked at adopting genocidal tactics when faced with the K\'kree
using
them.

Anyways, the K\'kree are distinctly unplesant and represent a whole-or-
nothing problem. No doubt Cleon had better things to do than wipe out
a major race.

Hm. ~14 sectors, coming back to life for the first time in about
2000 years. Partly settled, partly abandoned, with lots of untouched
planets just waiting for the rediscovery of j-3 or the new discovery 
of j-4. The Vargr starting to rumble coreward. The Aslan still fighting
rim/spinward (though mostly with the Solomani). ALL THIS and he still
has resources to push through Corridor into Deneb and the Marches
(say, when was Deneb settled? Before the Long Night?).

I just have to wonder if there was something more than just virgin 
territory... Oh well, I suppose there\'s always someone who wants
to shove off to the frontier...

Hey! Wait a minute... what about Meshan, Mendan & Amdukan?? These
aren\'t Vargr holdings... they\'re part of the Julian Protectorate
and have _never_ been part of Imperial space... who the hell is 
the Julian Protectorate and why the heck haven\'t they been assimilated??
Geez, maybe the Marches were Cleon\'s last hope for new territory...

This has, naturally, nothing to do with Traveller, but I\'m in a weird mood.

I actually just ran my players through an adventure I cooked up which was
heavily based on that Niven story.  It seems a patron was looking for help
locating his father, a prospector, who had misjumped into an empty hex and
discovered a strange rock.

To make a long story short, the patron finds out where his father went and
gets the PCs to jump there.  They find a spherical ball, billiard-ball-smooth
and actually almost landed on it before figuring out it was antimatter.

Only trouble with the session was that one of my players is a Niven fan and
instantly deduced the nature of the ball.  He agreed to play in character
(ie. a doctor who didn\'t understand anything about antimatter) so as to now
ruin the fun.

I just thought I would add one annotation to what Joe Walsh said:

While I am not a Baptist, in fairness to those who are, Baptist churches are 
autonomous:  what one church may frown on, another church may have a more laid 
back attitude.  (esp. concerning dancing, music, women\'s clothing, etc.)

I don\'t have much to say in this argument, but since Paul wanted a 
character reference:  Paul and I discussed religion on the IRC #traveller 
channel one night (and why aren\'t you folks on there more often? :), and 
I found him to be on stiff-necked son-of-a-gun.

Just kidding.  Paul and I talked about fundamentalist dogma a bit, and 
he\'s open-minded.  I was impressed that he researched various religions 
before deciding on the Baptist church.  He told me that he doesn\'t agree 
with everything they teach (ie, the official Baptist stance on dance is 
that all forms are evil; all rock-and-roll is evil (even Christian 
rock-and-roll); women wearing pants is wrong; etc.). 

Paul has an open mind, and approaches religion intelligently.

You mean like how most NeoPagans have to live with the odium of the bad 
reputation of various darkside "satanic" groups while living their lives in 
the best way possible? :)

I guess, none of my pagan friends ever seem to mention any persecution 
experiences.  Although I have heard about it in a general way -- but the same 
is true for my Jewish and Christian friends.  I guess no matter what people 
say, this country is still pretty tolerant.  How about your own experience?

Yes, but so do many Islamic fundamentalists.  Neither Christians nor
Moslems have a corner on fundamentalism. 

I went to a fundamentalist Baptist church for a while (because that\'s

Yeah, there is that.  <g> There isn\'t an official Baptist dogma, you know. 
The different Conventions (or individual churchs) vary a good bit on a
number of religious issues.  It is fairly common to believe that *your* way
is the *only* way, and everybody else is in danger of "hell\'s fire".  To
qualify as "non-Christian" you\'d have to be *really* non-Christian...or
Roman Catholic. <g>

Cool!  I gues this isn\'t the place to talk about this stuff.  <g> I just
wanted you to be aware that not every Christian that belongs to the Baptist
demonination is as stiff-necked as the ones you\'ve met.

Most of the stories about the south are just that...stories!  We

outsiders.  It\'s our perverse sense of humor...we fousted Jeff Foxworthy on

Paul, I think you\'ll find that there are quite a few of us out here on the
list.  I am a born again Christian and a member of a Baptist church.  I
don\'t disagree with anything you said in the above paragraph, however I
don\'t hold God to a 6 day limit on universe creation.  <g> 

About Fundamentalism...

There are people in most societies that are quite willing to ban books,
that consider GI-Joe and Barbie to be tools of \'Satan\', that pile toys,
books and records in giant piles and set them afire.  I know! There\'s a
church full of them about 2 miles from my home.

I\'ve always thought that these folks are afraid of ideas.  They need so
much structure in their lives that they can\'t allow for the existence of
alternatives.  Anyone that challenges their world-view is a threat, and not
just to them, but to *everyone* around them. That\'s why they can\'t just
leave *you* be, you\'re difference is a corrupting influence and as such is
dangerous.

Geeze Louise, Rich!  

I live in the "armpit of the American South", the "heart of the Bible
belt", and we aren\'t that bad!  <g> There\'s an SCA chapter/fiefdom in
Pensacola, several comics and game stores, roleplaying is spotty, but all
over the place, and we co-exist with the book/barbie/beatles burning
Churches pretty well.

We do have our problems, though.  There is the continuing problem of
ritualistic cat killings, for instance, Satanic Rituals are hinted at..the
pentagons on the walls of buildings don\'t help either. There haven\'t been
any church burnings lately, and the local statues of ML King and RE Lee
have been unmolested for several months now. The arson, explosions, and
murders at the abortion clinics seem to have died down, but that seems to
be seasonal..spring madness.

I don\'t play MTG, for a number of reasons, but I thought part of the game
was that you lose your cards when you lose..like shooting marbles.  The
decks being as hard to create and as expensive as they are, *I\'d* probably
ball my eyes out if I got beat too.  Or do I have it wrong?  <G>

That\'s probably the best way to teach someone to play games.  It\'s
important to learn to be a good loser and a good winner both.  OTOH, it\'s
important to learn that RPG\'s don\'t work exactly like most games.  

Through cooperation we *all* win. <g>

Hans, I don\'t have a problem with the un-labeled worlds in Core Subsector. 
Notice I didn\'t say unexplored. <g>

My take on it is that Marc and the boys wanted to leave a number of worlds
open for individual GM\'s to detail.  I\'d say those systems *have* been
explored and may (or may not) be part of the Federation. They\'ve just been
set aside for us to customize.  That\'s my take on it anyway.

I agree with BOTH of you! <g>

I want the maps, deckplans, equipment, NPC\'s and an entire plot laid out. 
I also want lots of plot hooks so the players and I can detour from the
established plot.  Even leave the established plot completely.  

What I don\'t like is an Adventure so tightly laid out that you have to
follow the plot sequence step by step.

That goes without saying.  <g> I just want the Adventure laid out so it is
*easy* to change, and has lots of alternatives ready to plug in.

Guess what?  I think that\'s what BOTH of you really want.  <g>

Hi there people,

Although I agree with Suz and disagree with Paul (I am an atheist, have
been for a long time).  (I must say that you are a lot more patient than
me Suz since I would not even start a conversation about religion and
usually slam the door :-#)).  However, I think we should think about
moving on to another subject (See I just ignored my rule and commented -
I guess I couldn\'t resist).

Mike Stackpole, Myself, and the other members of the GAMA Media Watch
COmmittee were engaged in looking for such a case for years. We never
found one. We found lotsa newspaper clippings, and one guy who
mistook a _novel_ for a serious case study...

<material deleted, including a discussion of the college student in
Michigan>

Dallas Egbert was the student\'s name. It was the first major "RPGs are
dangerous" story to hit the media.

Partly true. Egbert turned up in Louisiana, very much alive, (albeit
under mysterious circumstances...seems he called one of the detectives
who was searching for him, and turned himself in). Several months later,
Egbert killed himself. Tragic, but totally unrelated to gaming.


Harold:

> So who ended up with GDW\'s library of Traveller reference copies?

I kept my Traveller reference material. Frank kept his...etc. The
company library was divided up my mutual assent ("You want this?" "No
thanks, got two already." "I\'ll take it." etc.).

Supplements sold many times more units than adventures. Rules books
like Mercenary sold even better. Adventures are necessary for the long
term survival of the game, but money is necessary for the short term
survival of the company. I spend three weeks writing an adventure, it
sells 5000 copies. I spend the same amount of time doing a supplement,
it sells 15000. (Actually, it was more like: "Loren spends a month
designing a product versus Loren spends a month developing two
products).


 None of this is meant to be interpreted as saying adventures are not
very important to a game.

Ken, you bring up an interesting point.  

I\'ve often wondered just what *we* think is impossible.  <g> I\'ve listed
the 5 task levels and 5 skill levels below.  Let\'s do a little survey...

What percentage chance of success to you think each skill level should have
for each task level?

Sheesh.  Well, I\'m not an expert on the Baptist faith...I\'m sorry for the 
mistake.  I was just going by what Paul told me, and I was taking it out 
of context and of course stating it in terms of how I understood what he 
said (which may not be necessarily what he meant).

  Also, as the hull metals have their own value,  even the stripped
frames and hull plates would be recycled by someone.
  So, don\'t think of the situation as a car junkyard.   More along
the lines of the merchant marine,  where even old worn out stripped
hulls bring a decient scrap metal price.   If the owners have the
time and finacial ability, (pay towing, old taxes, outstanding
docking fees, back wages, etc.),  that hunk of metal is turned
into cash and razor blades.
  There are places where hulls are stored rather than scraped,
such as navy DEPOT\'s and some asteroids civilizations.   For
the most part they are about as rare as the Psionics Institute.
Except that they do not hide,  heck, the commercial ones even
advertize.

Sounds good.  This is how I will work it:

Herbivore: 5-
Scavenger: 7-
Omnivore: 7-
Carnivore: 9-

The mods on weaponry (eg. Claws+1) affect this number.  Thus, a killer
(carnivore) with claws+1 would have a target number of 10-.  

I will also list this number on the animal encounter table (to save the
effort of remembering it) along with the damage and stuff.  But then, when
I\'m running a game I never want to consult multiple tables, so I frequently
copy out data to have it right in front of me.

Keep in mind that this varies from church to church.  Dancing is iffy, but
most music (including RnR) is OK, and women it\'s when the women DON\'T wear
pants that you have a problem.  <g> 

Also keep in mind that just because *somebody* claims something is dogma
doesn\'t mean individual Baptists have to agree or obey.  We dance, listen
to rock, play pool, wear pants (might have a problem if the men were
wearing skirts though <g>, etc.  We just don\'t recognize each other when we
do it. <g>

I like the sound of that, Idiot/Savant. Thanks for the response. It

Thats true Fred. Gambling of that sort (roulette etc) was illegal in New 
Zealand up until a couple of years ago. There are currently only two 
major casinos in New Zealand, and neither are close to my home town. I 
have never been much into card gambling but I had always thought that 
the skill in those games was in bluffing and in knowing where the cards 
were. I really have to accept your advice in this regard.

You\'ve noticed that too?  <g> 

Winning is a personal thing.  I\'ve been up against people I *know* I can\'t
beat, but I can still *win*..if I redefine winning.  <g> Sometimes winning
is just giving your opponent hell, and surviving to do it another day.

I used to play tennis a lot, wasn\'t good but I played for fun. Sometimes,
I\'d run into *intense* players that were seriously good and played
SERIOUSLY.  I enjoyed playing them even though I almost never
won..officially.  See, I didn\'t play *right*..I played them like Bobby
Riggs.  <g> I\'d laugh and talk, kill the momentum on their shots, dink,
lob, and cut my shots.  I varied speeds when I shouldn\'t to disrupt there
rythem.  I\'d go to the net and dink a return rather than smash one.  I
*always* made them run..to strain for shots.  Everything I returned was
soft and usually with either top or bottom spin.  I made them expend as
much energy as possible. I also mixed in actually fairly good serves,
volleys and returns once in a while..when I could...those they could kill,
but because they never expected them, they were usually off-balance and
often missed them.  <g> They always won the first few games, but they got
more and more frustrated because of the way I was playing them, and if I
could get them mad enough they\'d start making unforced errors and
completely blow up.  Occasionally, I\'d win a match from the SOB\'s, usually
I still lost.  Either way, *I* had a good workout and a lot of fun.  <g> I
can\'t recall even one of these guys wanting to play me a second match.

     __________________________
     The Third Imperium is likely to meet a number of races that have used 
     different means of manipulating the environment. Sophonts have used 
     mechanical, biological, electromagnetic or even psionic methods to 
     promote the basic needs shared by most living beings: water, food, 
     procreation, security, shelter, living space and knowledge. 
     
     Races may also achieve a high level of technology in some fields, 
     while for various reasons falling behind in certain key areas. As an 
     example, the (now extinct) minor race of Sabmiqys/Antares was known to 
     have achieved TL17 in most technologies but because of social and 
     psychological factors never appear to have developed jump drive or 
     even space flight. 
     
     The Solomani found it most efficient to seed many worlds within their 
     sphere with genetically engineered (human and other) organisms. This 
     impetus, combined with the advantage that the human organism is 100% 
     compatible with the Terran biosphere, gave genetic and medical 
     sciences on Terra a substantial head start over less fortunate races, 
     such as the Vilani. 
     
     Some \'minor races\', for example the Vegans, achieved non-jump 
     starflight using technologies that the Third Imperium would consider 
     \'dead end\', such as starsails, interstellar ramscoops, generation 
     ships, extended cold sleep, robotic probes or a combination of 
     techniques. Some races that have not discovered gravitic techniques 
     have compensated by achieving mastery over electromagnetic forces.  
     
     The Zhodani are rumoured to have a superiority in psionic devices, 
     psychology, neurology and the social sciences, largely because of 
     their intense interest in psionic phenomena and the existence of 
     psionic tools to experiment in these fields. 
     
     Other rumours abound, such as those of races using advanced biological 
     technologies to achieve spaceflight, or even altering their basic 
     nature through a combination of cybernetic and biogenetic 
     enhancements.

Not to mention the folks who don\'t know the difference between
"Anachronism" and "Anarchism". One thing that helped here was having a
few cops and a couple of Sheriff\'s deputies in the local branch. It
meant that at least the law enforcement types knew better, or if they
didn\'t, somebody above them would clue them in. Given that one of the
Sherriff\'s deputies was in a position where pissing him off could make
your life miserable (some sort of paperwork thing :-) they tended to
give folks he said were ok the benifit of the doubt.

Y\'know, I recall a group like that mentioned in the Bible. Remember the
Pharisees? I was taught that they were *very* guilty of the sin of
pride (among other things), and that their very attitude was a sin.

Somehow, this fits far too many "fundamentalists" all too well.

Note that Islamic fundamentalists are no better. At least the Jewish
equivalent doesn\'t try to impose their point of view, they just look
down on the rest of the world.

Which neans that you can always use the dodge Star Trek and many SF
writers have used. Have the characters run afoul of "Fundamentalist
XXXs". 

If you want something resembling a current religion, I daresay that the
Church of Bob folks would find it *funny* to have their religion used
that way. Or use something like the Church of Elvis.

There are good technical reasons for claiming that any Church that has
a doctrine inconsistent with the statement of faith embodied in the
Nicean Creed (aka Apostle\'s Creed) is actually *not* a Christian
church. Something I\'ve been mean-spirited enough to use on folks in
online arguments a time or two. 

Having extras is ok. But denying anything in it gets you onto shaky
ground pretty fast.

But when you get right down to it, the anti-gaming attitudes and
everything else run into one major flaw. Sure, their church may say
that members may not do these things. But when they start saying that
non-members can\'t, they are on much shakier ground.

I could give a long argument, but it\'d all be based on one thing:
Where there is no temptation, there cannot be virtue. It takes no
effort to refrain from sin if you are protected from knowing about it.
And thus, you cannot claim to have been virtous, you merely went with
the flow. So by supressing this in non-members, they are denying their
members the opportunity to be virtuous!

The real reason for this is that too many churches are organizations,
and usually *hierarcial* ones at that. As such, they have a need to
expand. It\'s not enough to maintain the faith, and be an example, they
*must* get more people following their rules (the heck with whether
they *believe* them, just so they follow the rules). 

As soon as they start *telling* you what the doctrines mean rather than
helping you figure it out on your own, they\'ve crossed the line. They
no longer are interested in helping people to find God, they are trying
to recruit members.

Reminds me of another thing I was taught about sin. If you decide to
not commit a sin because you will be (or might be) punished, rather
than because it is *wrong*, then you aren\'t making a moral choice.
You\'re making an *expedient* one. And thus you are a sinner anyway. It
may be a lesser sin, but it\'s still a sin.

Joe, 

I can see your point to a degree.  I can see a character being Mr. Bad 
Dude in his specialty.  The problem is the attribute based task system.

On the surface, I like the simple task system IG has come up with.  It 
makes sense, and it is easy to do a quick addition to find a task number. 
 Both the character\'s ability and skill influence the character\'s 
success.

The problem that I am having is that a character with a high, or even 
semi-high, characteristic is good at a lot of things--not just his 
specialty.

Let\'s take a PC with a Dex of 10.  If he has ANY of the following skills 
at level 1 or greater, he has an 11 target number--which is pretty easy 
to obtain even on an impossible throw (which averages 14):  

Battle Dress, Bow Combat, Brawling, Craftsman, Dance, Environmental 
Combat, Equestrian, Fencing, Forgery, Grav Craft, Ground Craft, Heavy 
Weapons, Helicopter, Intruison, Jet Plane, Long Blade, Melee Combat, 
Music, Pilot, Pistol, Prop Plane, Rifle, Ship\'s Boat, Short Blade, 
Shotgun, Stealth, Submachinegun, Throwing, Vac Suit, or Water Craft.

So, you\'re telling me that just because a character is dextrous, he can 
be equally skilled in such diverse skills as shooting a gun, picking a 
lock, piloting a ship, sneaking around undetected, and throwing a 
grenade?

Does anybody else have a problem with this?

I agree that Dex should have a bering on these activities.  But, it 
should not skew succeess that much.  If a character with a 10 Dex (God 
forbid if he has a 12 or 14) has any of the above mentioned skills, he\'s 
got somewhere around a 35-40% chance of success on an IMPOSSIBLE throw!

It seems to me that MT had a better task system (although I think that it 
can be improved upon).  At least it was based on the skill.  The 
attribute only contributed 0-3 points to the throw.

   
Actually, Joe, the bell curve didn\'t work too bad in that system.  Let\'s 
look at:

The same character with Dex 10 and Pistol-1 fires his gun at a target.  
This gave a +3 to the MT task roll.

For a simple task at firing the pistol, the character would succeed 97% 
of the time (because snake eyes always fails).

A routine task?  92% success rate.

A difficult task?  42% success rate.

A formidable task?  A 3% success rate, because boxcars always hit.

An impossible task?  A 3% sucess rate, because 12 always hit.

Here, the bell curve is working for us--giving a high chance of success 
at the simple and routine levels, a moderate chance of success at the 
difficult level, and a very slim chance of success at the formidable and 
impossible level.

The thing I like about it is that the character\'s high Dex certainly has 
an impact on his chance of success, but there is still a wide difference 
in the character\'s level one skills and his level four skills.

In the T4 system, the character with the high Dex is exceptional at 
everything he does using Dex as a base.

Even the 8 or better CT system with all of it\'s DMs is better than this 
one.  Again, I say, what was IG thinking?

Kenneth.

     might be: 
     
     1. no messages that make big changes to the Milieu Zero setting (ie 
     leave big changes to the IG staff! so no Ancient megaweapon buried 
     under the Grand Palace that allows a group of PCs to become 
     Emperors/Empresses!)
     2. TNS items should be consistent with the limitations of the 
     background, such as date and technological level. Announcements of 
     refinements to meson communicator technology, consistent with TL12, 
     are probably OK; while development of Jump-6 drive or disintegrator 
     technology are not. 
     3. Imperium Games has full control over which draft news items 
     actually make it onto the TNS, and will be open to comments on 
     consistency, factual errors and so forth. 
     
     This might make an interesting \'link\' for elements of your campaign to 
     the official \'canon\', but must be consistent with the facts that a 
     journalist might know. For example, if your players have broken into a 
     secure, top-secret weapons research facility at the University of 
     Sylea, the TNS message might read: 
     ______________________________________________________________________
     0010-0001 Sylea/Core/Core
     Unidentified terrorists attacked University of Sylea yesterday, 
     stealing an undisclosed quantity of research materials. There were no 
     fatalities, thanks to the quick actions of Imperial troops guarding 
     the area. 
     ______________________________________________________________________
     *This sort of message doesn\'t \'break\' the background, but raises some 
     nice questions for other campaigners: eg why the hell are there 
     Imperial troops at the University, and what would a group of 
     terrorists be after? Are they terrorists at all, or is something else 
     going on? Were there *really* no fatalities, or is there an Imperial 
     coverup? 
     TNS messages should be the *beginning* of an adventure for other 
     gamers and not a *fait accompli* that cuts off all potential game 
     threads! *

A large part of these sectors were within the borders of the First 
Imperium, and were extensively settled by Vargr during the Long Night. 
The Third Imperium did try to assimilate them - from 89-175 they 
tried diplomatic/economic persuasion, but the region resisted.  When 
military means were tried, the various associations in the region 
joined together into the Julian Protectorate and beat off the 
Imperium (Julian War, 175-191). [source: Vilani&Vargr, DGP]

play in a sexist or racist setting (heck, that\'s implicit in almost all

attitudes.

I\'ve seen religious bigotry in games, including anti-Christian bigotry
(and being a Wiccan Priest I\'ve also noticed a whole lot of rather
wretched and offensive portrayals of Witches and other pagans).  Such
things have no place in gaming, but playing with ideas does.  I\'ve always
believed that if a game isn\'t challenging your ideas or your morality in
some way it\'s not a very good game. 

If a game makes you uncomfortable don\'t play it, I\'ve yet to see a game

Loren,

It is always good to hear it from someone such as yourself.  I do not 
pretend to know anything about the gaming business.  What I do know about 
is playing role playing games.  I\'ve played almost constantly for the 
last 14 years--through high school, through college, through my medical 
sales career, to the the present where I juggle my hobby with owning my 
own business.

What I\'ve always loved about Traveller was the background and the general 
feel of the game.  What I\'ve always hated was that it was so hard to 
play.

I\'ll elaborate.  I own all of the CT adventures and double adventures, 
and all of the MT adventures published by GDW.  Except for some of the 
latter, like Knightfall, basically what you got when you bought a GDW 
adventure was a lot of great background info with a vague idea of how to 
use this in a game.  GDW\'s adventures are what I call supplements.

Contrast this with what TSR was/is putting out (as far as I\'m concerned, 
the only two games worth anything are AD&D and Traveller).  You get 
richly detailed NPCs, complete maps, and pre-generated stats--all at the 
referee\'s fingertips.  

As a consumer, this is one of the main reasons why I, and everyone I\'ve 
ever gamed with over the last decade and a half, have always purchased 
much more AD&D products than Traveller items.  

It was just too hard a sell.  You got more for your money with the more 
detailed items.  

Take, for instance, my current gaming group.  We\'ve been playing 
Traveller for close to a year know, but this is only because of one 
reason.  I "convinced" them to play (read:  I refused to referee AD&D 
until they tried this game).  It was a very hard sell for me.  And, it is 
interesting to note that four out of six of them had never played it at 
any length, and the other two hadn\'t even heard of it before!  We\'re 
talking about avid gamers aged 25 to 33!

You may ask, "Why didn\'t you start a game before?"  Well, I did, but I 
learned the hard way how much time I had to devote to Traveller versus 
the time AD&D required.  

So, you have my reasons behind what I said.  If a game doesn\'t have 
interesting, well designed adventures to play, the game is just not worth 
playing.

Sincerely,

Kenneth.

    'body' => '     Kenneth and Joe Walsh may be disagreeing on what makes a "good" 
published scenario:

   The way I see it, rpg adventures basically come in tow types (although 
over time type 1 has become less and less common): the first type is a
development from the old TSR and Judges Guild "dungeon modules" where the
adventure book basically describes a location in a lot of detail, including
background, inhabitants, points of interest, and reasons why characters 
would want to go there, but doesn\'t have a "plot" as such.  The best example
I can think of for this type is the old RuneQuest adventure "Griffin 
Mountain" which, over 200 pages, provided enough raw material to keep a
campaign going for years (literally!) without having any fixed "events" that
will push or pull PCs towards any specific goal.  The weakness of this type
of adventure is that with an unimaginative or lazy GM or group of players
it can become nothing more than aimles wandering through endless series of
locations getting in fights, gathering up treasure, and moving on.
   The second type of adventure is basically the opposite, where the book
is structured by Events leading towards a Goal and the only background info
provided is what\'s necessary to stage those events.  The best example I can
think of here is "The Traveller Adventure" (also around 200pp).  The chief
problem here (this may be my bias showing) is that particularly innovative
and imaginative groups of players will do things outside the envisioned
scope of the adventure, leaving the GM the choice of improvising (in which
case he might as well not be using a published scaenario at all) or 
attempting to railroad the players, which (if they catch on) is always 
disappointing.  In a good adventure of this type (like "The Traveller 
Adventure") the plot is loose enough and the background described in
enough depth that it shouldn\'t become a problem most of the time, but how
many 200page adventures are you going to come across? (The answer: more and
more, but at commensurate prices-- the days of the $5 adventure seem to be
long gone)
    In page-for-page usefulness, I greatly prefer the first style-- give me
a solid enough basis in factual background info and I can improvise plenty 
of plots from it; improvising the nuts-and-bolts (world descriptions,
character backgrounds/profiles, stats) is harder to do in the heat of a 
game, at least for me.  I think it\'s a shame that Public Opinion (possibly
based on people\'s own memories of their immature "dungeon-crawling" days)
seems to hold the second type as the more Mature or Legit, and look down
upon the first type.  Since IG so far doesn\'t seem to be too concerned with
what\'s "fashionable" (judging by the "retro" look and feel of T4) I hope
that they\'ll carry the same philosophy into adventure design and at very
least give the players/GMs a choice of adventure styles.

Boy I sound like a conservative old fogey for being a 21-year old College
student who started gaming in the mid-80s and bought both of the above-cited
adventures in second-hand shops,

    I see others have noticed that little glaring ommission too. <GRIN> So
WHERE can I get that table?  And more importantly is the forthcoming Starship
Book going to have the expanded design rules?  I mean yeah I can go back and
use the MegaTraveller rules, but since T4 IS being published I\'d rather use
that system unless the expanded design system is going to be a rehash of
previous design systems.

    Oh BTW is there an Erata sheet for the T4 Book that I can find/get?

Many thanks in advance...

I save that for anyone arriving at my door trying to: (a) survey me, (b)
convert me to their religion. Works real well when you\'ve got overalls with
large red smears down the front... (it\'s paint, ok? But they don\'t know that!)

Reminds me of my friend who used to invite in Mormons, sit them down
opposite his array of occult books, offer them tea, coffee or alcohol, then
spend an hour ripping their religion to shreds and mentioning, in passing,
the pentacle inscribed on his floor under the carpet. Never seen people move
so fast for the door... :-) (hope this doesn\'t offend any Mormons on the
group. I\'m an agnostic, so I keep an open mind but I\'m more likely to
believe in flying saucers than the \'average\' person\'s view of God).

>blood drinking parties on Samhain . . . or was that Beltane? Gotta keep the 

Beltane. Now that\'s fun!

Andy :-)

P.S. Boy is this stuff off-track, but it\'s fun!

P.P.S. When\'s someone going to suggest running Traveller demos for Sunday
Schools? What better way to introduce children to the GOOD side of RPGs. All
you need are some suitable scenarios which clearly have GOOD vs. BAD and in
which, perhaps you could allow a smattering of violence but which really
relied upon character interaction and planning to win the game?

Come on guys (and gals, remembering recent sexism debate), let\'s see a
little more positive "GET OUT THERE AND PROMOTE IT". It\'s very easy to sit
at a terminal and type all this stuff, particularly the doom and gloom about
how T4\'s got errata. Hell! (ooops can I say that with all these religious
types around?) I\'ve been writing technical reports for years and I go
through them with a fine toothcomb and they\'re reviewed by others and...
etc. Needless to say there are always some errors.

So, stop talking and get out there and do your bit in converting people to
T4!!!!

And if you want more than one adventure for Milieu 0, then e-mail me telling
you what you want CORE and BITS to publish next!!!

You mean 6 task levels and 5 skill levels below, Eris!

Eris, this needs more qualification. I think skill level should be used as a base 
modified by the governing attribute--not the other way around.  

People should be good at shooting guns because they practice shooting targets and have 
experience using weapons in combat situations (in other words, they have a good 
weapon skill)--not because they have a good dexterity.  

Yes, a high Dex (meaning good hand-eye coordination) should improve their ability to 
shoot, but not allow them to shoot well if they know nothing about it and have never 
experienced it.  

This is what the T4 system is saying--a good Dex allows you to shoot well.  Take, for 
instance, two characters.  John has a Dex of 4, which is well below average, and a 
Pistol-2 skill, which is respectable.  Sue does not have a pistol, but she has always 
been quicker than anyone she has ever known, with a Dex of 12.  

Under the T4 system, these two characters\' chance at hitting a target is exactly the 
same (Sue uses the zero level rule giving her a target number of 1/2 the attribute).

Does it seem right to you that John, with a respectable level 2 pistol skill, would be 
so handicapped by his Dex that he would hit the same amount of time as Sue does, 
eventhough Sue has never fired a weapon in her life?  Or that Sue is so darned quick and 
coordinated that she can pick up a pistol for the first time and use it with the same 
expertise as another person with a skill level 2? 

I say no, it does not seem right.      


But, on with your survey...
In order to compare apples to apples, we need a base line reference from which to 
compare from.  I would have suggested taking a character with an average characterisitc 
of 7.  That way, anybody who answers this question can ask himself, "What chance of 
success would I give an average person with an average skill attempting an easy task?  
an average task? a difficult task, etc."

Looking at the numbers you listed, we would have to use a person slightly below average 
in his attribute because of the starting value of 6 in the novice column.  
Using a character with a 5 ability score.  That would mean the novice has a skill level 
of 1, the average skilled person would have a level 4 skill, and the other levels would 
be 7, 10, and 13 respectively.

Of course, this is crazy.  I\'ve been playing Traveller for a long time, and I\'ve never 
seen a character with a skill level higher than 7 (CT/MT/T4, that is.  TNE used a 
different system, as we all know).  

If we\'re going to do this, let\'s do it right.

Our base line:  A character with an average characteristic of 7
		With an average skill level of 2

Given the base, here is my rough guesstimate, in round numbers, of what I think the 
success chance for each difficulty level should be:


Difficulty Level	Chance to Succeed	Chance to Fail
- ----
Easy				95%			5%

Average				80%			20%

Difficult			40%			60%

Formidable			20%			80%

Staggering			10%			90%

Impossible			 5%			95%



So, Eris, and everyone else, what do you think about what I am proposing?

Respectfully,

Kenneth.

There\'s a female player in the group I game with that has added
tremendously to our sessions with her style of play and wit. As a matter
of
fact, every session in any group I gamed with which included a
woman/young lady
seemed to go smoother, though one or two gamers have been rather
bloodthirsty
(letting loose of a few inhibitions, maybe..but then so do I :-) ).
Although I admit to the occasional need for a crassness fix with my buds
("it\'s
a guy thing" as my wife would say), I\'d much prefer doing without it
than doing
without a mixed group. You all (females) are just too neat to miss out
on (and,
no, my wife is not reading over my shoulder).

I\'m right behind you, Trent.  DGive me this type of adventure anyday.  
The second type of adventure that you mentioned is only a supplement as 
far as I\'m concerned.  Does this come from being raised on AD&D?  


I think it\'s a shame that Public Opinion (possibly

I\'m not sure if I would consider the second type the more modern type.  I 
just think it is two different game philosophies at work.

I remember playing the old GDW adventures in the small books and being so 
frustrated at all the preparation time it required.  Even then, there 
were discussions about "true" role players being the ones who made up 
their own adventures.  I\'ve always disagreed with that.

Give me a few well made adventures, and I\'ll string them together, change 
a few names and organization, and edit them to my liking to make a 
dynamite campaign.

It\'s like I\'m the head writer at a successful TV show.  It is hard, and 
unecessary, for me to write the whole season by myself, so, I send all of 
the junior writers home for the weekend to come up with some episodes.  
Monday morning, we\'re stringing them all together to fit in sink with the 
goals for the show.

When I\'m GMing, the published adventures are my junior writers.

I\'m interested...how many of you out there prefer the type of 
adventure Trent and I like and how many like the vague ones?

Regards,

Kenneth.

when a task is called "Impossible", the players won\'t take it seriously if
they roll 4D (or whatever) and make it 50% of the time.

My solution is simple. You chuck the D3s (except where you want to use D3
increments as DMs instead of modifying the roll required to achieve
something - e.g. you say 4D, player suggests clever idea for aiding task,
you say, ok 3.5D rather than saying ok, you get +2).

Also, increase most tasks by about a D3 level and make really impossible
tasks about 6D. Even a relatively unskilled person has a very faint chance
of achieving this, while a real boffin would have a hard time, but could
succeed a fair proportion of the time.

A short period of playing the new system allows you to quickly determine the
levels at which you need to set tasks to make them seem challenging to the
players, i.e. to keep their interest.

It ain\'t broke, it just needs fine-tuning.

In any case, this is common happening in the media. Films and books often
change titles when being sent to a different country, for marketing, legal or
other reasons. A name that sounds good in one language may have problems in
another. The name may already have been used by a recent product. The importer
may just prefer a different title. It is generally illegal to sell a product
intented for a particular market in any other.

The relevance of this to Traveller: Well, there are far more nations, planets
and cultures in Traveller than on Earth. Given a huge customer base, the media
industries should be really big business. However, I do see a lot of remakes
and rewrites taking place - the Imperium is too big to enforce copyright laws
for any but the most expensive cases, so taking a successful product, filing of
the serial numbers and placing it in your home culture would be fairly safe.
This also prevents successful authors, film stars and makers from being the
richest people in the universe. Loaded, yes, but not astronomically so.

Have you tryed a target number of:
       4 + (stat/2 round down) + Skill

and a Default (unskilled) target number of:
      2+ (Stat/4 round down) + JOT skill


This significantly reduces the effect of the Stat in a characters ability=
 to do something.
In your above example John has a target number of 8, while Sue has a targ=
et roll of 5.

For anyone with a UPP of 777777 it will make absolutely no difference.

Its the system I\'ve adopted in my present campaign.

I totally agree with you. My biggest pet peeve with the GDW adventures
was the phrase: "The Referee will need a map of the installation." That
phrase, in various forms, appears in almost every CT adventure. It
requires a lot of work for the referee. I\'ve got a lot of  half-designed stuff
that was never used because I had to create a map that the players
never encountered. After dropping AD&D, I gave TSR another chance
with Marvel Super Heroes (no flames please), and adventures for that
game as well give all the details the referee will need. It is extremely
helpful for those with limited time to prepare.

Let\'s hope future IG adventures give more stats and details than Rubicon
Cross!

     It was released under the name "The Assassin" in Britain, although I\'m 
     pretty sure this wasn\'t the original (i.e. American release) name.  
     "Nikita" was also the British release name; it was originally "La 
     Femme Nikita".  (The funniest cross-Atlantic rename I heard about was 
     the British comedy starring Robbie Coltrane which changed from "The 
     Pope Must Die" -> "The Pope Must Diet"...)
     
     Go see "La Femme Nikita" - preferably in the dark with no distractions 
     for the full effect.  It is infinitely superior to the remake.  I have 
     great difficulty talking coherently about this film because it had 
     such an effect on me.  I certainly didn\'t enjoy the first half hour of 
     the film (I nearly walked out after the first scene), but I class it 
     in my top 5 favourite films now.  The soundtrack makes good back 
     background music for gaming sessions too :-).
     
     I can\'t wait for Luc Besson\'s sci-fi flick to come out.

>>That statement makes no sense. Science is a tool; you\'re using it as a
religion, using it as the defining source for your beliefs. Science can\'t
enter philosophical / religious realms, because it isn\'t equipped to do 
so.
It\'s like trying to use a hammer to tighten a nut. Can science prove the
existence of love? Can it prove the existence of friendship? Hate?
Ideas? No, but we all know they exist.

Strictly speaking, all the emotions you describe are biochemical processes 
in the brain, so yes, science can prove the existence of these things.  Even 
if it can\'t yet, that only shows that there is room for further advancement 
in science, not that science has failed.  Science is about finding answers, 
not about saying you have them all to begin with.  Religion\'s (any 
religion\'s) claim to have all the answers does not hold water with me.

Second, I am not using science as a religion.  I have no religion, and I see 
no need for it whatsoever.  Perhaps I am using science "as the defining 
source for [my] beliefs," but I don\'t agree that that is the province of 
religion alone.  I do not recognize the validity of religion as an 
epistomological tool, and so I look at the things religion declares to be 
true from as scientific a viewpoint as I can muster. Real life is all the 
same to me, whether someone else thinks part of it is dictated by religious 
rules or not.  If someone says demons, etc. are real, then I to analyze that 
statement scientifically just as I would any other claim of fact.  When I 
say occult beings/spells, etc. have no basis in fact, then I mean that 
without falling upon faith in religion (unscientific), you have no evidence 
for their existence.  I cannot agree with the basic premise of the logic 
used by religion.  Any statement that these things do exist is strictly 
opinion, no matter how many millions of people agree over how many 
centuries.  And although everyone has a right to their opinion, that does 
not give anyone the right to enforce it as fact (which is what I see 
extremely religious types trying to do).

Third, in its ideal form, religion is blind faith in unchanging doctrinal 
truths.  Ideally, science is the seeking out of fact through observation, 
always allowing for rejection of disproved theories.  Religion does not 
tolerate new ideas that go against its teachings, science welcomes new ideas 
that disprove old theories.  That is the advancement of science.  I remind 
you that I said "ideal."  Please don\'t come back with anecdotes about how 
Professor So-and-So refused to let go of his pet theory even when it was 
clearly disproved.  That\'s Professor So-and-So\'s human weakness, not 
science.

Finally, based on what I have said, I find science to be superior to 
religion as an epistemological tool.  I have no religion, only an 
epistemological tool.  I have no need of religion whatsoever.

>>As an athiest, you may want to check out
http://www.cleaf.com/~covenant. That\'s the web site for Southern

If you are meaning to show me an objective fair discussion, then thank 
you.

If you are meaning to enlighten me by showing me a model case of how an 
atheist was proven wrong by the religious, then no thank you.  I am an 
atheist through my own individual personal choices.  The conversion of 
another random atheist has no bearing on me whatsoever.

I am perfectly pleased to study religion from an objective viewpoint (as 
history, culture, anthropology, etc.), and it\'s fascinating.  However, I 
will not actually believe any of it because I am an atheist.  Anecdotes 
about Mr. Atheist getting whupped by Mr. Religion in a debate make no 
difference to me.  I think as an individual.

Perhaps we should avoid this sticky topic on the TML.  Unless someone quotes

Well, I guess we are about due, it has been a while since we had an honest

I have no recollection of that, senator!  (Is that what I\'m supposed to say?)

<grin>

Seriously, This is my last post on the matter, and the reason I\'m posting
this is to prevent me from being mis understood.  When I talked to Joe about
the issues above, it was telling him about where I differed from some of the
specific views of my church.  Someone else has said, and I will now
reiterate, Baptist are as diverse as shades of skin (for lack of a better
metaphore).  The point being that I in no way meant toimply that ALL Baptist
churches believe this way.  This is my fault, cause I sometimes forget that
everyone else didn\'t have the same background and experience as me, and
therefore doesn\'t understand exatcly what I am saying. :)

Sorry for this last post, but I don\'t want to be labeled as a legalistic
Fundamentalist, just as a Fundamentalist (ie, someone who believes the
fundamentals of the faith(in this case Christianity)).

Amen.

I liked the DGP nugget format, in that encounters and so on were neatly
encapsulated, with a diagram showing different ways of moving between them,
as well as dependencies (ie. the players should hear this rumour before
encountering this person).  But then, I also liked the older CT narrative
approach, which provided a nice feel for the referee.

Given my druthers, I\'d like to see a nugget-style adventure, with notes about
which choices the playtest groups made.

They were part of the 1st Imperium, and maybe 2nd Imperium ( I
obviously failed my canon roll :) They were a mixture of human and
vargr planets. Some worlds had both races living together. There is
also a extremly anti-vargr Civlization.
This was discussed in Challenge somewhere.  The 3rd Imperium tried to
conquor these sectors but failed and only was able to conquor Antares. 
This is discussed in the MT rules, in the map that shows all the wars
the Imperium fought.  Archduke Brzk joins up with the rest of hte
Julian Protectorate after taking his domain out of the Imperium during
the rebellion.

       six-siders.


By the way, is anyone taking into account the fact that, under T4, a 
roll that results in *two* dice showing the maximum possible (6 in the  
case of D6\'s, 3 in the case of D3\'s) is /always/ a failure, even if 
the total of the roll was less than or equal to the target number 
(i.e., a 2.5D roll of 6,1 (D6) and 3 (D3), for a total of 10, with a 
target number of 11-, is a failure)?  This does affect the probability
of success for Impossible tasks...

I have found that I can teach more to my players about the Imperium through a 
rumor than by simply telling them.  In the adventure, they are hungry for 
information, so I hand them a rumor, and they scribble it down in their notes. 
 If I simply tell them before or during a game session, they look at me and 
nod their little pointy heads.  Needless to say, I use a lot of rumors now.

The editing wasn\'t confusing, it basically sucked...  You had the 
character creation stuff at the beginning of the book, right next to 
stuff on building keeps???  

So you go to equip the character now that you\'ve generated him/her, 
right.  Look up the chapter on arms and equipment...  Wait, there is 
no chapter on arms and equipment...  The armor is on page 93, the 
weapons are on page 300+ and the equipment is somewhere in between, 
and BTW, the combat tables are near none of the above, and the combat 
tables aren\'t near the armor values either...and things are 
misspelled, the book is chock full of situation where 1 section of 
rules has no relationship to stuff written about on the same page...

Its amazing the book sold at all...but by then the D&D craze had 
already been launched, so it didn\'t have to be good...

> had _LOTS_ of great information for campaigns of all kind -- in

Give me a skeleton.  I\'ve read enough SF to write plot lines, and 
I\'ve got enough ideas of my own.

OTOH, I will agree with you...  After getting used to the complexity 
of MT (which is, after bug fixes, my system of choice) reading T4 is 
like eating Chinese food, flavorful, but not entirely satisfying...

A personal anecdote to add of my own here:

In my last job, which lasted about 3-1/2 years before they folded 
their tent, I published an in-house newsletter for about 200 people.  
Did it once a week.  Ran spell checkers and grammar checkers on it, 
invariably read it several times, and even gave it to a peer to check 
over...

About 1 out of 3 issues, there were STILL errors, much to my chagrin, 
and I consider myself to be a fairly good writer...

The worst part about it was that my boss was an ex-English teacher.  
If I had a dime for every memo, newsletter, or policy I\'d written or 
typed up for him (I type faster than the admin. assistant we had, and 
he\'d sometimes hand me something like this if pressed) that he\'d 
given back to me proofread and marked up, I\'d be a rich man... :-)

Someone on this list has a page where he worked out all the probs of all task rolls and 
stats from 1-15 and skills from 1-12

He suggests (rather wisely) use half-attribute plus skill, but subtract 1D6 from all 
difficulties. Maybe give this a try. I would suggest use DGPs great task system (aka MT

(Feeling the blood pressure rising rapidly)  Grrrrrrrr
In the summer between my junior and senior years of high school, I worked a 
morning paper route so that I could get a lifetime subscription to S&T.  I did 
so, and that fall SPI vanished.  I was enraged at TSR for their pathetic 
"discount" offer, and made a blood oath to never buy TSR stuff again.  Later, I 
heard that the powers-that-were at SPI were well aware of their financial 
instability when they began their big lifetime subscription advertising push, 
and had been largely trying to sell subscriptions to make the company look a 
little more appealing for potential acqiusition.  I\'ve never heard the "real 
story" from the SPI people (and I would love to hear it), but this version is 
one I\'ve heard several times in newsgroups and in print.

One good thing came of that; I did have enough money left to go to a really big 
science fiction convention that summer.  While strolling the market tables for 
some good books, I found this little black box with red and white lettering.  
My friend and I stayed up all that night learning the rules and playing 
Traveller.  Just as something I loved died, something else came into my life.  
Intersting how all of them involved three letter acronyms.

I like symmetry.

That\'s interesting; I had the exact opposite experience in college: the
college didn\'t want us starting a Christian group on campus because
"religion" had no place there. We eventually got it started, but with no
funding from the Student Government Association.

Kenneth,

As I mentioned in the post, you may want to look into the 1/2 attribute 
system suggested by several people.  There are variations to it, but 
that\'s the essential starting point.  Either 1/2 attribute plus skill 
with 1D6 less per difficulty level, or 1/2 attribute plus 2*skill, etc.


Best wishes,

Hi Stephen,

You can get the missing table from IG\'s web site, at 
http://www.imperiumgames.com.  Just go there and click on errata.

Starships will have a more expanded system of design rules.  And an even 
more expanded system of design rules (the type where you can practically 
design each individual bolt used on the ship) will be out sometime next 
year.


>     Oh BTW is there an Erata sheet for the T4 Book that I can find/get?

The hardbound copy had one that shipped with it..dunno when/if IG will be 
distributing these to the stores.  But, IG\'s web site has a more complete 
version of the errata sheet anyway.

and for Unskilled (Default) use:

However, this system while simple, still makes some attempts too easy. On=

Target Number =3D (Skill x2) + Stat

Difficulties =3D Easy        (Auto / 1D)
               Average     (2D)

Which solves both problems.

Thanks for the comments, Andy.

I guess I\'ve got two points to make here.  The first, the most obvious, 
is that there needs to be something done to improve the task system.  
You\'re right, there is no challange in it for the players as the T4 
system stands now.  

What fun is it for anybody if the main character of a story ALWAYS kicks 
the heck out of the bad guy, ALWAYS is the best at everything he does, 
and ALWAYS wins the scenario?  Drama is conflict, and nobody enjoys shows 
or books with these types of characters.

There has to be risk.  There has to be challange.  And, I believe in all 
good stories/series/books, the main character sometimes fails. 

More important is my second point.  I think it is crazy for this new 
edition of Traveller, "based on 20 years of game designing experience", 
to have such a gapeing problem with the basic game mechanic that the game 
is built on--its task system.

We GMs should not have to fix it.  IG should have fixed it before they 
put out the game.

If I sound bitter here, its because I\'m trying so hard to really like 
Traveller.  I was so excited when I heard T4 was coming out.  I got the 
book, and I really liked the design and layout.  I couldn\'t wait to play 
it.  Now, I\'ve played it, and the task system is just not living up to my 
expectations.  I wanted to be blown away with the game.  I want to get on 
TML and tell everybody how great the game is.  I want to tell all my 
friends.  Instead, I\'m experiencing buyer\'s regret.

IG has disappointed me.

Above, you said, "It ain\'t broke, it just needs fine tuning."  I\'d have 
to disagree with you, Andy.  I tinker with almost all other RPGs that I 
play.  With T4, it seems that I am re-writing it.

Not wanting to end on a bitchy note, let me say for the record, that I am 
here for the long haul.  I like Traveller so much that, although I hate 
that I have to do it, I\'ll do whatever it takes to make this game 
playable.  It that means re-writing the rules, then so be it.

Traveller is seductive.  Its background and detail capture my 
imagination.  It makes me wonder, and it makes me get excited about 
putting together a plot and mystery for my players to sift through.

Traveller is like that woman that you know is no good for you, but you 
just don\'t care.  All of your friends tell you to keep away, but you 
just can\'t.  It\'s animal and magnetic.  She\'s passionate, interesting, 
consuming, and if she craps on you once in a while, it only makes you 
want her more.

Well, I guess you get the idea...I really like Traveller.  It\'s the game 
mechanics that I have a problem with.

Regards to all,

Kenneth.

Yup. Use your map and don\'t use the one in the book. If you want to use a
planet, add it to your map or rename the planet in the adventure. That seems
like the best method to me.

Ok, that does it!

A Catholic priest and a Lutheran Minister had been fishing buddies for
a long time. When they heard that the new Baptist minister was a
fisherman also, they invited him along on a fishing trip.

They had gotten the boat in the water and were just starting to fish at
their "special" spot, when the priest said "left my favorite lure back
at camp, be right back". And then he steps over the side ofe the boat
and walks twenty yards to shore getting only his feet wet. Then after
rummaging around in the camp, he walks back the same way. This boggles
the Baptist\'s mind a bit but he doesn\'t say anything.

They fish for about an hour and the Lutheran realizes he left his lunch
back at camp. He too, gets out of the boat, walks to shore getting only
his feet wet and then walks back. The Baptist is beside hinself. He
just *can\'t* let his faith be shown up by these too.

He makes an excuse about getting some drinks from camp, steps over the
side of the boat, and SPLOOSH! He\'s in the water over his head.

The Catholic turns to the Lutheran and says "I think we should have
told him about the rocks..."

I keep a chart on hand that tells me what the chance of success is. If I
feel the need to make a task tough, I just add a negative DM that brings it
down to the level I want. On the whole, my players don\'t mind having a
system that makes things a little easier on them. (Besides, one of my
players rolled a 14 when he needed a 13 or less and bounced his ship off an
asteroid. Things still go wrong from time to time.)
        One thing that confused me was when I first read the rules, I
thought that the DM\'s adjusted the Difficulty Level. In fact, they are added
to or subtracted from the target number! This seems to help with the task
system somewhat.

Actually, that "Satan\'s Church of America" (actually *Satannic*) bit
comes from a police officer who is a fanatic about witches, satanism,
etc, and goes around "teaching" police departments "how to deal with
cults". 

An awful lot of the members of the SCA think that the Board of
Directors is wrong to be just ignoring the guy and telling us to avoid
anything that might even *look* religious. We think we\'d be better off
suing him for everything he\'s got and making an example of him.

have Psi of 9+.  Under Enlistment, it says See \'The Examination\' but
that isn\'t very helpful.

2.  Also under Psionics, what\'s the difference between Psi Level and
+1 Psi?  I\'m guessing that +1 Psi adds to your Psionic ability and,
therefore, Psi Level adds to your level in a discipline?  I guess this
makes sense.

3.  Regarding spaceships, it looks like we\'ll be limited to 6 G\'s of
acceleration.  Is this true?  Does anyone know if the upcoming more
advanced ship design rules will allow ships with more than 6 G\'s of
acceleration?

4.  Were the guns in the T4 book created with the 3G3 rules?  :)

Darn Zhodani, messing with my mind again, have forced me to believe your

But leaves one additional problem:  To wit, how do you define the
spectacular failure?  The any boxcars approach leads to SF much 
too soon.  

Additional question on this is, how doxyou handle "default"/"Jack of
All Trades" usage?  What\'s been pretty scary is how well my players
have gotten on running a trader using JOT for alomost everything 
using the written rules.

The Stat/2 method results in making Formidible tasks damn near 
impossible for untrained people.  What do you people think?  

For JOT, do you add Skill or Skill*2 ?

Also how do people generally handle the situation where a player wants
to use JOT for a skill that is implemented as a die roll modifier
such as Broker?  What I\'ve been doing is allowing a JOT roll, with
success meaning effective "Broker-1" and failure no effect.  Any
thoughts?

Well, Kenneth, I\'ve done some calculating and now, besides being hungry, I
have some numbers for you.  First, here is your table with the current T4
numbers (including the boxcar and snake-eye roll modifications) as well as a
number of "fixes" suggested here on the TML.  Some Notes to follow.  These
percents are based on your given baseline, stat=7, skill=2

Diff   ----Chance to Succeed----
Levl    Ken    T4 Std    MethA    MethB    MethC

   MethB - (stat/2) + (skill*2)  (round down)
   MethC - 4 + (stat/2) + skill  (round up) (From Declan Feeney)

Your numbers are very close to the T4 numbers; however, we both know that is
not the point.  Take a look at another table...

This table is based on an attrib=11 and a skill=2.  I think this will show a
bit more.

Diff   Chance to Succeed
Levl    T4 Std

Easy     Auto

Diff    95.37%   
Form    82.41%   
Stag    62.19%   
Imp     43.89%   

The thing to remember about this table is that a character with an average
attribute of 7 would have to have a skill level of 6, a difficult task in
any of the Traveller systems.

I hope these figures help you express your concern.  I too have a bit of a
problem with the skill system, but as yet, I haven\'t found a good fix for it
yet.

The reason I posted publicly was because your statement was posted
publicly. That statement is as follows:

 "Objectively speaking, the existence of such things [spiritual, mystical, or
mythical beings] cannot be verified  scientifically and so I cannot
consider their existence to be fact. Therefore any claim that they exist is
opinion." I objected to your saying that your statement was true
"objectively speaking."

 To me, your statement is a completely subjective statement, and,
believing the exact opposite, I didn\'t want you to "get away with it" (in a
completely friendly, intellectual manner) in a public forum. I will be
replying to the bulk of your message privately, because:

A) It is a well thought out argument, and one that will take me a while to
counter, and since I subscribe to this list at work, I don\'t want to take up
too much of my work time with non-work related activities (which is also
why I don\'t post all that much on this list). I\'m probably going to forward
the message to my "home" account and reply from there.

B) This list is really not the place to be discussing such things.

BTW, thanks everybody for your graciousness and patience with all of
us who have participated in this off-topic discussion. If it had happened
anywhere else (usenet, BBS forums, etc), we all would\'ve been flamed
without mercy and beyond control. It\'s proof that there are some really
great people on this list.

My next post will be Traveller related, honest!  :)

   Back when TNE came out, I decided that I didn\'t care for the Reformation
Coalition setting.  As the Regency setting was barely mentioned, I decided to
develop my own.  _Children of Earth_, installments of which are appearing in
Traveller Chronicle, was the result.

   While my approach was somewhat more conservative than yours (my setting
takes place within the same era and universe as the rest of TNE), we appear
to agree on the need make the *game* meet *your* needs, not vice versa.

   MegaTraveller was clearly aimed at the existing fan base.  The result was
that few new players came on board between 1987 and 1992, and a serious
decline in sales at GDW (which was also caused by other factors, but I
digress).  TNE, which was aimed at least partially at bring in more fans, was
hurt by the after effects of this strategy.  

   T4 will be a success if IG can once again make Traveller a household word
in RPGs.  No offense to Marc Miller, but at this point to a group of 19 year
olds, "Marc Miller\'s Traveller" could be named "Boyd Schneider\'s Traveller",
and it would mean the same thing to them.  I do not envy the task that lays
before IG--what they are trying to do will take more of an advertising budget
than GDW ever had.

Harold

Dogged you? I\'m just trying to figure out why Cleon would be

.02Cr into it.

I got into Traveller (MT, actually) not for role playing, but for source
material.

I\'ve GM\'d Albedo Anthropomorphics RPGs for several years now, and I have
to say that I prefer it\'s task system to Traveller\'s.  Tasks are
resolved by using the skill level as a _modifier_ to the primary
attribute.
<<quick background.  In AARPG, there are 8 attributes:  Strength,
Stamina, Manual Dex, Coordination, Reason, Intuition, Drive and
Stability.  (the last two being measures of a person\'s \'will\' and thier
\'mental/emotional stability\')>>

For example, Astrogation is a Reason/Intuition based skill.  You take
the average of those, and then compare them on the \'Skill Chart\' against
the character\'s skill level (which go up to 15).  Basically the chart
take the ability (betweein 1 to 15) and multiplies it by the skill/10
(for a range of .1 to 1.5).

the max skill attribute for the players in this system is a combined
Skill/Attribute score of 23.  

All tasks are resolved using the universal (and well named) Task
Resolution chart.  Just take your skill/attrib and subtract the
difficulty.  If the difference is zero, the roll must be 7+.  I don\'t
have it in front of me right now, but I recall for every point or two
more or less difficult, the target goes up or down a point, e.g diff of
zero, target is 7, +1 and +2 points in players favor and the target is
6+

I\'ll post more about this, and try to work up what the probablities are
with this system.

*     *     *     *     *     *
Having chosen English as the preferred language in the EEC (now officially
the European Union, or EU), the European Parliament has commissioned a
feasibility study in ways of improving efficiency in communications between
Government departments.  European officials have often pointed out that
English spelling is unnecessarily difficult.  For example: cough, plough,
here, hear, bow, bough, through and thorough.  What is clearly needed is a
hased program of changes to iron out these anomalies.  The program would be
administered by a committee of top level staff chosen by the participating
nations.

In the first year, for example, the committee might suggest using "s"
instead of the soft "c".  Sertainly, sivil servants in all sities would
resieve this news with joy.  The hard "c" could then be replased by "k"
sinse both letters are pronounsed alike.  This would not only klear up
konfusion in the minds of klerikal workers, but typewriters and keyboards
kould be made with one fewer letter, a signifikant savings.

In the sekond year, bekause of growing enthusiasm, it will be announsed that
the troublesome "ph" would henseforth be written "f".  This would make words
like "fotograf" twenty persent shorter in print.

In the third year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to

   I don\'t know, seems like a perfect time to mention that Traveller
Chronicle #11 will feature an in-depth essay on Gabreelism, the faith of the
people who rule Terra in the New Era.  Among the things the essay will allow
you to do is incorporate religious faith (or a total lack of it) as an
attribute of a character.  Extremely low or extremely high levels of Faith
have implications with regard to PC - NPC interaction, decisions characters
will make in particular situations, etc.  It was interesting to write, and
will hopefully be interesting to read and use in game situations as well.

   As for the current religious discussions, a Gabreelist would probably ask
everyone (except our resident Atheist) to come together in fellowship and
emphasize what we as believers in the Divine Being have in common, and
encourage everyone to be more tolerant of the differences people have in
their rituals for worship.

   Speaking of our resident Atheist, belief in a Supreme Being is an act of
faith.  The same can be said for the disbelief in a Supreme Being--for while
there is no conclusive scientific proof that God exists, there is no
conclusive scientific proof God *doesn\'t* exist either.  Since nobody is
going to prove anybody right or wrong in this discussion, the discussion is
merely a philosophical excercise.  Philosophical excercises are great mental
gymnastics, but like real gymnastics, if someone gets hurt, it\'s not fun
anymore.

   Can I get an amen?  :-)

you\'ve got to make it.  You\'re desperate.  You need the cash.  You\'ve got 
to walk out of here with some money.

you\'ve failed.  The other players have seen your result.  They know that 
you haven\'t got squat.  

They pick you as an easy target and begin to bet you out of the game.  
Everyting is riding on this one hand--you\'re not going to get another

chips across the table, and everyone is suddenly quiet as they realize 
that you just raised to double the bet.  Eyeing you, they all know that 
you have to be bluffing.  One says, "I don\'t think he pulled a rabbit out 
of his butt.  He\'s just trying to buy the pot," before he slides his 
chips out to match yours.  The others are inspired with courage, and they 
match as well.  They stay in.  

The pot is huge.  The cards are flipped (the final quality rating is 
revealed), and everyone gasps at your hand.  You rolled a QR 1 the second 
time--Excellent!--greatly improving your hand.

You can\'t help but smile as you rake the table.  Victory!


		Then this may be the gambling rules set for you.



This is for Brian, Boyd, and the other couple of people who e-mailed 
wanting to see the James Bond gambling system.

The question was, "Does anybody know of other systems that handle 
gambling at any length?"

My answer to that is, "Yeah, I really liked the way it was handled in the 
James Bond game."

As a matter of fact, the whole game was superbly done, with minimal 
glitches, and it really captured the flavor of the movies.

So, for all of those interested, here\'s the system.  Convert it as you 
will.



	Characteristics in James Bond:
The JB game has characters with 5 abilities:  Strength, Dexterity, 
Willpower, Perception, and Intelligence.  These stats ranged from 1-15.  
Hey, now that\'s an easy conversion.



	Skills in James Bond
Skills also ranged from 1 to 15.  For conversion, I\'d suggest dividing 
the skill number by 3.



	Task rolls in James Bond
Percentage dice are used to determine task success.  The primary chance 
for a character to do something, like win at gambling, is calculated by a 
formula--with each skill having its own formula.  The formulas were 
always either one governing attribute added to the skill (just like in 
T4), or was the average of two attributes added to the skill.  This gave 
you a target number to roll lower than with percentage dice (again, very 
similar to T4).

For instance, in the JB game, gamling primary chance was determined by 
adding the character\'s gambling skill to his Perception attribute.  Just 
substitute Int for Per, and, again, the conversion is made.

Whoa!  You might say.  Are you telling me that a person with the best 
characteristic, Per 15, and the highest gambling skill level available, 
gambling-15, would only have a 30% chance of succeeding at a task?
	
The answer is yes and no.  This is the character\'s primary chance, but 
this chance is never used alone.  An ease factor is always used to 
qualify the task.

"OK," you say, "so what\'s an ease factor?"



	The Ease Factor
Think of the ease factor like the difficulty levels in T4.  The harder 
the task is, the lower an Ease Factor the GM would put on the throw.

The Ease Factors used in JB are .5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.  To 
use them, and qualify the task, simply multiply the EF by the character\'s 
primary chance.  This gives you the percentage chance for success.

For guidance, and ease factor of 5 was considered to be the normal 
difficulty for a task.  It the task was harder, the GM picked an ease 
factor between .5 and 4--if it was easier, he picked one between 6 and 
10.

Simple, simple.  To aid in calcultion, a table was printed on the 
character sheet.  All players had to do was cross reference.



	The Chance for Success
What was unique about the JB game, and I have never seen this in any 
other game, is that the result of the throw was also qualified.  

Let\'s think about this.  A character has an average Per of 8 and an 
average gambling skill of 8.  This gives him a primary chance of 16.

On an average gambling throw, EF 5, he has an 80% chance of success, and 
if the throw was extremely easy, his chance is 160%.

What the extremely creative geniuses at Victory Games did was to say, 
"Ok, the character made the throw, but how good was he?  Did he make 
success by a narrow margin, or did he succeed with ease?"

This was determined by comparing the results, if the player made the 
throw, to a Quality Results Table.  

So, looking at our average Joe with an 80% chance of success at an 
average gambling task:

If the player rolled		The Success was considered
- ----
	01-09			Quality level 1:  Excellent
	10-18			Quality level 2:  Very Good
	19-45			Quality level 3:  Good
	46-80			Quality level 4:  Acceptable

How do you use this in play?  Let\'s say the character was talking to an 
NPC trying to get some information out of him.  The GM has, for easy 
figuring, say, four piece of information that would be beneficial for the 
players to have.  If the PC failed the roll, the player got no 
information.  If he made the roll with acceptable success, the GM would 
give him the least important information the NPC knows.  If the Player 
rolled a good (level 3) success, then the GM would give him 2 pieces of 
info.  If he rolled very good, he\'d get all but the most important piece 
of info.  And if the player rolled an Excellent, this was like rolling 
double damage or spectacular success--the PC got the whole enchilada.

If anybody wants a copy of this qualtiy results table, e-mail me at 
dreamer@brokersys.com, and I\'ll post it.



	So, now that you know how the system works, on to the gambling.
- ----Several different games (Roulette, Blackjack, Chemin De Fer, Baccarat, 
etc) are detailed, but to save space on this already lengthly post, I\'m 
just going to describe how poker was handled.  There are other rules, 
too, if anybody is interested, that concerns cheating, automatic success, 
penalty for not having a skill, etc.  Let me know, and I\'ll e-mail you 
directly with what you want.



	The Game is 5 card stud.
	(For those of you who don\'t know the oldest poker game ever, it\'s 
 	done by dealing 1 card face down and one up to each player, then 
	four cards dealt face up with a betting round on each up card.)  

The story at the top of this post is a reenactment of a JB 5 card stud 
game that really happen during play.  As you read the rules below, go 
back and follow it through the story to see how it is supposed to feel.

Gambling in the JB game handled it like so:  All players throw against 
their gambling skill letting all players know the result--quality rating 
or failure--of the throw.  This would simulate judging your hand against 
the other player\'s up cards.  You\'d know at this point whether you had a 
good, bad, or medium chance of winning.

Then everyone would roll again against their gambling skill, but this 
time, the result would be kept secret (the GM governs this) from the 
others.  This simulates the draw of the cards, the bluff, sizing up your 
opponent, etc.

A character could either improve or hurt his hand with the second throw. 
 The below chart is used to determing the final quality rating for the 
hand.  Whoever has the highest final qualty rating wins the hand.  Cross 
reference Failures and quality ratings.

			First Dice Result
Second Dice Result	F	4	3	2	1
- ----
	F		F	F	4	3	2
	4		F	4	3	2	2
	3		4	3	3	2	1
	2		4	3	2	2	1
	1		3	2	1	1	1+

I just love this system.  It puts your players right in the middle of the 
action.  They are there, sitting across a smokey table, gambling with 
money they don\'t have, trying to beat Mr. Big.

What could the final quality rating mean?
	QR 1+ is a royal flush
	QR 1 is a straight flush
	QR 2 is either a full house or 4 of a kind
	QR 3 is either a straight or a flush
	QR 4 is either a pair, two pair, or 3 of a kind
	QR F is a high card only--a runt

If anybody has any other questions, I\'d be glad to help.

Paul, thanks for the work.  I\'m going to print it out and use it to come 
up with a good system.  This is not he first time that I\'ve read one of 
your posts and been in total agreement.  It is good to know that there 
are others out there who play Traveller the way I do.  Your tables saved 
me a lot of work.

Before we wade into fixing this thing, what we need to do is define the 
problem.  What is your opinion?  I say its the attributes being so 
powerful.  I know the curves made with all the D6 make it hard, but I\'m 
not willing to give them up with regard to Traveller.  There has 
got--scratch that--there is a way to make it work for us.  I\'m not 
completely happy with any of the fixes posited yet either.

Keep up the good work,

Kenneth.

I didn\'t mean that in a bad way, Ethan.  It just sounded like you didn\'t 
buy what I had to say.  I respect your opinion, and everyone else\'s, on 
TML.  

I think that one of Traveller\'s strengths is that it appeals to 
such a diverse group of people.  Besides, if everyone agreed, there 
wouldn\'t be a TML.

I worked on this at the office, so I may have made some goofs (not enough

didn\'t factor in the 2 sixes = failure rule, which shows up prominently 
when looking at the figures in the upper right-hand corner of the table 
in relation to the others.  Still, it gives us something to work with.


                6       9        12       15       18     21

Note:  I left out the Easy task level, since it would be Auto for anyone 
with even one level of skill.

Observation:  At Kenneth\'s target number of 9, we see that the distribution 
isn\'t too bad (not bad at all, to me).  Later on, though, it breaks down 
considerably.  If you have a characteristic of F as your basis, and you 
have even one level of skill, you\'ll be doing great no matter how 
difficult the task.  

Comment:  I don\'t have a problem with the extreme high end.  We\'re 
talking about people with attributes of F and skills of 6 there.  The low 
end looks good, too.  So does the middle.  When you get into the 15-18 
range, though, it may be a problem.

In his or her specialty, a character might have something like a 
characteristic of 9 and a skill of 3, giving us a target of 12.  For this 
type of character, I would rather see probabilities like those under a 
target of 9.  

Perhaps if we could shift the whole table over by 3 points, it would make 
more sense.

Anyway....on with the discussion!

According to Greg Porter they were, and I\'ve been reverse-engineering them
for fun while I wait for the new edition of 3G3.  I\'ve also been converting
some of the weapons in More Guns! to T4.  These are *very* loose conversions
based on what Mr. Porter has told me, but they should be servicable until
the full rules come out.

I\'ll probably post the conversions along with my own designs on my web page.

There actually has been a fair bit of material published concerning 
jumpspace theory (speculative, though it is) and jumpspace phenomenae.  
You just haven\'t read it, probably.  DGP\'s "Starship Operator\'s Handbook" 
(published for MegaTraveller) was, in my opinion, the best resource on this.

One could make that assumption if they hadn\'t read FF&S.  In that text, it 
is clearly stated that j-space and subspace are NOT the same thing, 
insofar as the descriptions given for each vary widely.  They are not 
even the same \'technology.\'  If they were, why would jump drives be the 
\'official\' FTL drives in the Imperium setting, while subspace technology 
is an \'alternate\' that does not apply to the mainstream Traveller 
setting, but was proposed as something that could be used by referees and 
players desiring a different setting?

It\'s probably a good thing that subspace technology isn\'t part of the 
\'standard\' setting, too.  A large part of Charted Space\'s history and 
background is shaped by the limited speed of communication over 
interstellar distances (just look at how astrographic separation saved 
the Domain of Deneb -- twice).  The parsecs-per-day travel times afforded 
by the alternate subspace technology for both starships and 
communications would totally disfigure the canonical background, such as 
it is.

A few notes here:

1. James Gariss made a couple of suggestions.  One was to replace Medical
with First Aid in the Educational table.  After a little bit of thought,
I did that.  He also suggested I remove the +/- on Social Standing in the
Social table.  After a little thought, I decide to keep it.  My
reasoning: the journalist has an equal chance of boosting or hurting his
reputation with a story, which could be reflected by his Social Standing.
 Thanks for the suggestions, James.
2.  I boosted the Continuance role from 6- to 8-;  gotta give the poor
guy a more reasonable chance of getting back in.

Below is the latest version of the Journalist.  I haven\'t updated it on
the site yet, but the two notes above should cover the changes I would
make there.

I hope you find it useful.

Marc Miller\'s Traveller - Journalist Career Description

	Journalists are the people who inform the masses on the events of
the day.  Be it the son of the subsector duke discovered dead in his
aide\'s bed, the start of an important diplomatic mission, or the release
of the latest holovid by your favorite entertainer, there is some
journalist somewhere that somehow digs up the story and reports it to the
rest of the galaxy.
	This has given the journalist sort of a mixed reputation.  One
time he might be at the top of his profession for discovering the scandal
of the century, the next he might be seen as the sleeziest human in
existence for reporting on how a person had sex with an alien.  Because
of this, many times the journalist needs to be on his toes for he may or
may not have made an enemy with a story.
	Journalists can be found almost anywhere, from the slow one-page
weekly on a technologically backward world to the editor of the major new
service in the galaxy.  All have one thing in common: find the story and
report on it, no matter what (or sometimes who) it costs.

ROUTINE TASKS: Research, writing, interviewing, investigating, sticking
his nose where it doesn\'t belong.

*An award is a recognition of the journalist\'s exemplary work in the
field of jounalism.  This award can have some monetary or other prize
associated with it.  For example, the Traveller\'s Digest Award, issued by
the Traveller\'s Aid Society, grants a journalist a three year membership
in the Traveller\'s Aid Society, with which he is to travel throughout the
whole of the Imperium, submitting a story on his experiences once a month
to the Travellers\' Digest.  The award should be up to the gamemaster, or
the gamemaster could allow the presentation of the Travellers\' Digest
award.

Yep. Toss the T4 map and keep using your own. Canon is great as long as
it adds to an enjoyable campaign. The whole point behind Traveller or
any other game whether it\'s an RPG, boardgame, cards, or whatever is to 
be a vehicle for social gathering and fun. You and your players are the
owners of your campaign. If it\'s easier and more enjoyable for you all
to go with what you\'ve personally developed then keep it. If you all
find keeping up with canon more fun, by all means go for it.

I *usually* go with canon simply because it\'s less work for me and it
allows some limited solo playing.

Weird. I had an almost identical experience the one time I thought I\'d
try to play a woman character. In the campaign I was in, my character
didn\'t have a day go by without some evil NPC attempt to rape her. What
compounded my problem was that she was the first character in this
campaign that I had designed not to be a fighting machine. That\'ll teach
me to try to expand my role playing repertoire! I haven\'t tried to play a
female character since. (Aliens yes, women no. 8^)

("Hey man, if you didn\'t want me to play a woman, you could have just
asked me not to!")

My next character was a serial killer who preyed on rapists.

I\'d say "yes". One way is to allow a PC to find an Institute and pay the
testing fee at the beginning or end (your choice) of any term, assuming
they have the cash (maybe allow them to roll a mustering out benefit at
the end of each term but no more than 3 cash rolls total). If the player
thinks the character\'s Psi Strength makes it worth the effort, allow the
switch.

You could also allow them to attempt for a scholarship if their Psi
Strength again would make it worthwhile.

You are correct on both. Joe Walsh runs the +1 Psi (according to his
reply to my previous post on this very same subject) as increasing a
PC\'s Psi Strength up to a max of 12, given the T4 statement that
"Ratings
of 13 or more cannot be attained naturally once a character has passed
beyond age 18."  (Jump in here, Joe, if I\'m getting you wrong)

I, being a power-hungry Zho sympathizer, interpreted the previous T4
statement as meaning that training can increase the "natural" roll up
to 15. After all, a characteristic is a characteristic, right?

Keep in mind that an all-powerful PC gets boring very quickly for both
you and the other players. Having run a super-Psi PC for a number of
years, I admit to being in agreement with Joe. IMO, if not run
carefully, a strong Psionicist can easily ruin a campaign.

Geez, I hope not. This limitation is one of the few things in

success for the various target numbers, given a task rating of Impossible 
(4D6).  

The result was interesting.  Rolls of 4 through 13, of course, were 
unaffected (you can\'t roll two sixes on 4D and get those totals).  
However, from 14 through 24, the results were affected...sometimes very much.

For instance, normally a roll of 14 has a chance of 11.2654%, but now it 
becomes 10.802%.  A roll of 18 normally has a 6.17% chance, but it drops 
to 3.85%.  Here\'s a table of the approximate changes (rounding being the 
reason these are approximate):

14  -.4%
15  -1%
16  -1.4%
17  -1.9%
18  -2.3%
19  -2.2%
20  -1.7%
21  -1%
22  -0.77%
23  -0.31%
24  -0.08%

Of course, the numbers of 22, 23, and 24 become automatic failures, as 
they are impossible to roll on 4D without getting at least 2 sixes.

Taking this back to the X- task roll system, you can see that the 
additive nature of the task throw probabilities vis a vis the above 
probabilities results in some degree of change.  At the 21- level, the 
chance for success at an Impossible task changes from 98.88% to 86.28.  
At the 18- level, it changes from 90.28% to 83.28%.  And, if we look at 
a throw of 15-, it changes from 66.44% to 65.04%.

Clearly, this affects the higher-skilled/attributed characters more than 
other.  It is equally clear that the effects of the Spectacular Failure 
are much less pronounced at lower difficulty levels (3.5D6, 3D6, etc.).

However, I think it is interesting food for thought.

asterisk off," or something like that. :)

Actually, I\'ve been trying to cobble together a future history of
Christianity, complete with schisms, revivals, mergers (like A.C. Clarke\'s
"Chrislam") and so forth.  The more I learn about church history, the more
\'real\' my creations seem.  Mind you, I\'m concerned more with broad
theological movements and social implications than individuals.  Eventually
I\'ll post them here.

look at the timeline:

     0     Third Imperium established
     50    First Zhodani contact with Imperial traders [Foreven sector?]
     
     IFrom this timeline, I draw a few conclusions: 
     1. As of Year Zero, the Zhodani have had some contact with the Vargr 
     for 3000 years, with the Vilani for 2000 years and the Aslan for (?500 
     years?). 
     2. Vargr/Zhodani contact probably continued through the Long Night. 
     3. The Vargr were raiding the Vilani throughout the Long Night. [Therefore 
     intermittent news /rumours of the Zhodani might still reach the Vilani via 
     Vargr contact]
     4. The Zhodani Consulate reached the edge of the Spinward Marches 1000 
     years ago and almost definitely contacted the pre-Maghiz Darrians.  
         
     The Vilani were very quick to join the Third Imperium, although it meant 
     being a \'junior partner\', with status nowhere near that of the *Ziru 
     Sirka*. 
     The Vilani are a highly conservative race, and around Year Zero they      
     have spent over 1000 years in a state of emergency: fighting Vargr corsairs
     (some armed with alarmingly high-tech weaponry, possibly of Zhodani 
     origin); the perfidious Zhodani known to be lurking *somewhere* behind the 
     Great Rift; and the land-ravenous and warlike Aslan rumoured to have 
     crossed the Rift as well. 

     In these circumstances, the Vilani may have been in secret 
     negotiations with Cleon for some time. They agreed to 
     join the Imperium immediately, if Cleon could secure their 
     core-spinward frontiers against the possibility of Vargr, Zhodani, and 
     even Aslan, encroachment. Later developments that support this: the 
     rapid push into what became the Domain of Deneb, despite the massive 
     military effort required to secure and patrol Corridor against Vargr 
     incursion; and the extremely rapid colonisation of the Marches. 
     
     The Vilani may have also used the \'carrot\' of super-technologies 
     present in the Marches, in the form of numerous Ancient sites and 
     Darrian worlds.

it is possible to convert any T4 rolls to the MT system with minimal
effort. 

Staggering Tasks don\'t exist in the MT system, but it\'s easy enough to 
define them as having difficulty level of 17+.

For those who don\'t have MT the system is amazingly simple:

Stat/5 (round down) + Skill + 2D6 vs a difficulty number:
1-4   =  0
5-9   =  1
10-14 =  2
15+   =  3

Skill difficulty levels:  

Easy        3+

Routine     7+

Difficult   11+

Formidable  15+

Impossible  19+

The system allows you to add in all sorts of complexities if you like, 
but this basic system alone works for 90% of rolls.

It\'s also easy to write down the die roll you will need for any 
difficulty of task for a given skill.

I am quite disappointed in the T4 system, because like many modern systems
(the Storyteller System by White Wolf being the most obvious) it is simple
to use, but numerically it simply doesn\'t work well at all.  I\'m rather
tired of the current victory of style over substance in game mechanics. 

I\'m just hoping that Starships works out better.

Thanks.  I\'m glad you can use it.  I have a statistical chart of all the
possible die rolls for 1D6 to 4D6 (including 1.5, 2.5, & 3.5) as well as a
chart listing the T4 percent based on # of die and to hit number.  I\'ll try
to get it on my web page (or at least in eMail to you) in the next few days.

Again, glad you can use my stuff.  Hee hee, it\'s also nice that at least one
person agrees with some of the stuff I say. :)

Well, IMHO, you have stated the problem VERY accurately.  We talked about
this a while back (when T4 was just out) and that is when I suggested using
1/2stat and 2skill.  It is ok, but not great.  The best I have seen yet is
the 4 + (1/2stat) + skill.  The main problem I have with this is that I
really like the ability to use different stats based on the task at hand,
and the math is a bit time consuming.  While I haven\'t done an in depth
study of this method like I did with mine, I have a suspicion that it would
work better.

Not being a mathematician myself, just a guy who knows how to do a bit of
stats stuff, I don\'t really know of a good fix.  I am open to suggestions,
and I will also be thinking of other ideas.

Is that right?  I didn\'t think the D3\'s counted in figuring
spectacular failure, just the D6\'s.

Again, total agreement.  I also really like the idea of characterisics

Extraordinary movie, I know what you mean. Someone on the list did post 
the actual US name of the American re-make but I haven\'t been able to 
find it. What was the name of the French actress? 

A local cinema recently played a double feature with Nikita and a movie 
called Diva. I had seen both before on video so I didn\'t bother to go 
because Diva absolutely suxs and is nowhere near the same quality of 
Nikita. 

Tell me more about this Sci fi movie? and what are your other five 
favourite films?

I especially like the part when the mad cleanup guy arrives with his 
jars of acid. It is just so frighteningly credible. It always makes me 
think how great the RPG Top Secret could have been if I had got around 
to playing it more often.

With all due respect for those who do design the official adventures for 
Traveller in all its incarnations, I have to say I have never 
intentionally purchased an adventure. I may have picked one up as part 
of a deal that included buying supplements of CT but never have I played 
 in, run, or purchased a commercial adventure. The rational was simply 
that my fellow gamers and I felt we had adventures that were either 
organic (steming naturally from an ongoing campaign) or tied in more 
closely with what the players wanted to do. The other side to the 
rational was that there was a distinct possibility that if the referee 
had a copy of the adventure, then so did one of the players. Critical to 
a Traveller adventure is the sense of the unknown and unexpected.

On the other hand, I have played in many adventures that relate very 
closely to the latest popular action or Scifi movie in town.

You got the point, but I wanted to emphasize that the keyword above was "rely" 
- -- that is, I use the original CT setting up until the JTAS announcing the 5th 
Frontier War (so long ago...).  I was excited to get it, but after a few days 
the realization began to dawn on me that this was changing the flavor of my 
spaghetti -- did I mention that I was very particular about my spaghetti?  So 
then, my CT became a divergent timeline.

To lay all of my cards out on the table--I just don\'t buy the 
one-week-in-jump-no-matter-what-the-jump-number-is rule.

I believe that, when comparing ships capable of Jump-1 and Jump-5, the 
Jump-5 ship should not only be able to jump farther, but it should also 
be able to make a 1 parsec jump in 20% the time it takes the other ship. 
 
Better jump capability should not only give you greater range, but more 
speed as well.

I\'ve had many a fun session with PC\'s on the run, jumping out system by 
the skin of their teeth, only to find the people chasing them already 
waiting for them at their next destination.

So there it is--my blasphamous thought.  

Either throw stones, or join the dark side--we\'ll rule the galaxy 
together!

system to design space statins, starports, orbital instalations and the like.

Here is some ground rules, mainly to see what the responce is like.

1. FFS shal form the bases of the system.
2. It should be compatable with QSDS,SDSS and SCDS.
3. It will cover technolagy usable for the NAH ie batteries, solar power, 
   MHD et al ( as well as non G-compensator gravity sources like spin 
   habitats)
4. Brings back the astroid and buffered astroid from High Guard, with 
   different variations (ie expanded and escavated astroids) 
5. It should be simple, but detailed (no complex formula\'s, tables or 
   ratio\'s based on 1 displacement ton (14m^3).
6. We should be able to allw people to acurately map an instalation.

The emphasis here is details to allow a GM to define a space station or 
whatever in TRAVELLER TERMS. Designs should b based on "hey , that is a 
cool idea, what would it look like in Traveller" and not "Sh*t, I cant 
put those fighter bays in, And what about the damn generators.."

Reality testing could be compared with Mir, Freedom, Spacelab, The Death 
Star and an O\'neal colony (al la Babylon 5 and Gundam 0083).

Do you feel that there is a need for this system? Should it be under NAH 
or would you like to see it as a quick and dirty system like QSDS?

    'body' => 'Okay, just for comparison here\'s the skill system for Albedo Anthropomorphics 
(<obplug> available from Chessex, </obplug>), developed by Paul Kidd (a way 
cool Australian writer/game designer)

The system revolves around the "Task Roll Chart"  Actually there have been two 
editions, so I\'ll include the details about both.

1st edition\'s skill system took the character\'s \'Governing Attribute\' for a 
skill (or average if it involved two) and multiplied it by the character\'s 
\'Training Level\' in that skill, divided by ten.

Governing Attributes range from 1 to 15, as do skill levels.  \'Average\' 
attributes are about 10, exceptionally high attributes to up to 17.

Here\'s the task roll chart for the 1st ed., with the Difficulty levels:

Difference between      roll       
  Ability Score         less         
   and Target           than:                                             

  -12 to -9	              2       
   -8 to -6               3     
    -5, -4                4
    -3, -2                5     
      -1                  6    
       0                  7    
      +1                  8
    +2, +3                9
    +4, +5               10    
  +6 or better           11

    or a roll of 12 always fails.
    a difference greater than -12

  Difficulty    Target
     simple         5
     average       10
     difficult     15
  very difficult   20
nearly impossible  25


Combat Shot Difficulty by Range
	range   Normal  \'Dart\'
		   ammo    ammo
	close     5        5
	short     8        8
	medium   12       10
	long     16       14
     extreme   20       20

(Dart ammo is an item in Albedo:  rounds that are fin stabilized sabots with 
base bleed)

So here\'s a quick example skill.

Governing Attrib:  10
Skill level		  9  (this should be equivilent to T4 skill-2)
Ability Score:	  9	

Here\'s some task roll examples:

difficulty  difference  target roll
  simple       (+4)	  10-
  average      (-1) 	  6-
  difficult    (-6)	  3-
very difficult (-11) 	  2
near impossble (-16)  	 fail

All sorts of modifiers to the task roll (DRM\'s) can be made due to fatigue, 
wounds, encumberance, etc.

The second edition of Albedo Anthropomorphics changed the system a bit.  The 
task roll chart was changed and the \'Training Level\' was dropped.  Instead a 
character could simply be skilled, be adept or a master at the skill.  also, 
the differnce between the character\'s skill and the target is called the 
\'Chart Number\'

Here\'s the info:

Task difficulty numbers:
  Very Simple     0
     Simple       5
     Average     10
    Difficult    15
 Very difficult  20
 Near Impossible 25

Chart Number	Roll
- -12 or under	 2
- -11 -10 -9         3
   -8 -7           4
   -6 -5           5
 -4 -3 -2          6
 -1  0 +1          7
 +2 +3 +4          8
   +5 +6           9
   +7 +8          10
 +9 and over      11
a roll of 12 always fails


Chart Number Modifiers
No Skill:         -5
Skilled:           0
Adept at skill:   +5
Master at skill: +10

So for a character with a Governing Attribute of 10 who is skilled, here\'s 
another breakdown:

V simple     (+15)  11-
simple       (+10)  11-
average       (+5)   9-
difficult     (0)    7-
v difficult   (-5)   5-
near impsble (-10)   3-

Combat difficulties:
close	   	5
short		10
medium	15
long		20
extreme 	25

also, to help tell the story about the task, there are result grades:

(success grade 5) if the roll is a natural 2, it\'s \'The Tops\'
(success grade 4) roll is 6 or more below, it\'s an Excellent Success
(success grade 3) roll is 4 or 5 below, it\'s a Very Good Success
(success grade 2) roll is 2 or 3 below, it\'s a Good Success
(success grade 1) roll is 1 or 0 below, it\'s a close sucess
(failure grade 1) roll is 1 or 2 above, it\'s a close Failure
(failure grade 2) roll is 3 or 4 above, it\'s a Bad Failure

P.S. (In which I sound off on a topic about which I have no factual knowledge)
    I don\'t have the statistical savvy to figure out probabilities with
more than 2D, but it seems that the proposed method of Easy= 1D, Avg= 2D,
Diff= 3D, Form= 4D, etc would kill two birds with one stone by making the
success rates seem more reasonable (and more consistent with MT) and also
get rid of those weird 1/2D rolls.  Am I missing some obvious drawback here?
    Also, for what it\'s worth, I don\'t think of the T4 task system so much as
being BROKEN as much as just not (as it currently stands) suited to my
personal tastes.  As of right now, if/when I run T4 I\'ll probably stick to
the MT task system (minus all the complex options), but I\'m still curious
to see what all the statisticians on the list can come up with.

game.  You might as well just be saying "I\'ve never really liked it that 
Traveller can\'t have instantaneous interstellar communication; it\'d sure
make things a whole lot more efficient".  No one\'s going to stop you from
thinking that, but unless you can provide LOTS of really good reasons to
back your statement up, you\'re not going to win against one of the fundamental
assumptions of the game
     It\'s too late and I\'ve got too much other stuff to do to think up the 
implications for an interstellar society in which \'fast\' ships could travel
between stars in a day or two as opposed to Traveller\'s 1-week minimum (for 
one, it would irrevocably change trade and communication strategies) but I\'m
pretty certain that they would be significant enough that the interstellar
community structure would be changed enough that it would no longer be
"Traveller" in it\'s traditionally recognizable form.  Who knows, maybe such a
new model would be "better" than the one that we currently have, but it just 
seems to me that if you\'re going to accept the concept of "Traveller" and the
sort of future society it envisions, that there are certain fundamental
assumptions you\'ll just need to accept, and it also seems to me that
"Interstellar travel takes no less than one week" is one of those, almost as
much as "Communication is limited to the speed of travel."
     Like I said, though, I admire a nice attempt at large-scale subversion

    Both actually. ;) And yes, at least "I" think such a system is necessary!
Think of ALL the Asteroid Belt systems and A class starports with orbital

    Hey, I was expecting discussions of TRAVELLER, not having to spend an hour

Digest in the hopes of getting some of my time back.  Pity I had to do it
though.

GREAT idea !!!  I don\'t know of anything that laid out any ground rules for
making maps/plans other than giving you deck heights and maybe grid sizes. 
It would be great if there was a system that would give some help in this
area.  I have always wondered how big the orbital part of a class A
starport might be, not to mention what it looked like.

If the project takes off and you need a hand, drop me a line.  I\'ll do what
I can.

Yeah, If you increase the number of Dice you increase the probability of
a Spectacular Failure. The Impossible Roll (6D under your system), now ha=

a 26.32% chance of resulting in spectacular failure!!!

I personally don\'t have a problem with this - If they are going to attemp=

improssible they should expect spectacularly bad results - but some peopl=
e
might not be happy.

I\'m more concerned that your suggestion doesn\'t affect the heavy influenc=
e
stats have on the outcome.

If any one is interested.

Probability of No 6s:    5/6 ^n (where n =3D number of rolls)

Probability of One 6:   n/6 (5/6^n-1) (where n=3Dnumber of rolls)

Probability of Two or more 6s:  1 - (probability of No 6s + probability o=
f One 6)

I\'m inclined to agree. I think the system just needs balancing, which wil=

probably just take trial and error. If it can be made to work its simplic=

will make it stand out as a superb system.

By the way, a peice of advice for anyone unhappy with halving d6s. Blank

Since the table I provided only has the Target numbers on it, it should be
equally applicable to any system which just changes the Target number.

As for the (Skill x2) + Stat system, hold with me and I\'ll have some stats up

I\'ve been thinking about this one.  If Imperial *traders* contact the Zho in 50, 
would it seem plausible that the Scouts (huzzah!) had already made prior contact?  

Foreven sector?  Spinward would be the logical choice.  By the way, this would make 
for a very interesting adventure.  How about T4 Adventure 1: First Contact (doesn\'t 
it tickle your CT tastebuds?).  An intrepid band of characters, while exploring far 
out on the frontier, stumble across the fabled Zhodani.

Which brings up another point - can you imagine how the chaps at the Psionics 
Institute must\'ve felt when they heard the news of an empire composed of psis.  The 
Psi Faction at Court could\'ve helped push Cleon into making a commitment on sending 
resources into the Marches.  Well, maybe pushed isn\'t the right word.  :)

Yes.... and no.....   Yes, there are those interested in Traveller "history" and no, 
don\'t shut up.  The history behind Traveller is part of what makes the game for me.

Sounds very reasonable, though primarily from Vargr. Another possibility is that there 
might be records of colonies headed that way (Sword Worlds) as well. They are far 
enough out, the thinking might be that they may not have had such a bad fall, or even 
that we would have the moral claim if we get to them first and "rescue" them

Nope, it isn\'t right.  I didn\'t have my book with me, and

I have to agree. All the arguments about canon are not just for the sake of Official status
It is because the Traveller Universe is the largest _consistent_ roleplaying background 
ever. And most of us use it because there is such a wealth of ideas, not because it is the 
"Official Approved" version
And to avoid writing any more about religion (and such) I switch to Lurker mode

This remind me of one of my favourite lines from POGO: "Personally I find
it best not to get into a battle of wits with a worm. If you loose, people
say you can\'t outthink a worm. If you win, people say that you CAN outthink
a worm. It is a subject best left alone." (I forget just who said it;
either Mouse or Snavely, I think).

Joe, it looks like we\'ve come to the same conclusion via different routes. 
I started a thread a week or so ago, saying that the to-hit chances in 
combat were too high and could be made more realistic by increasing 
difficulties by 1 or 2 levels (which is similar to changing the target 
number by 3 points).

Most of the replies I got at the time were that they preferred the more 
"heroic" feel of having the better chance to hit.  I seem to remember this 
view was shared by a certain, well known atari owning, microsoft-free 
80\'s-ophile ;-).  I bet you eat corn-dogs too :-) :-).

It\'s great to see this stuff on the list.  I was mulling over lowering the 
effect of stats myself, and I now see that all the work has been done by 
someone else :-).

Proot!

There\'s no evidence that Cleon did anything with the specific purpose to
encourage the settling of Deneb and the Spinward Marches. What he did was
to push vigorously for exploration of the area. Scout ships were sent out
and bases built in leaps and bounds. The _effect_ was that trades followed
and settlers followed the traders. Cleon MAY have anticipated this, so 
there is equally no evidence that he _didn\'t_ want the Marches settled
quickly.

However a perfectly good reason for wanting the space around him explored
is that he wanted to know about potential threats in advance (and about
potential recruits too, of course).

Personally I incline to the "where traders go, governors will follow"
theory of how the Imperium got to the Marches, but the evidence either
way is weak.

I did something similar when MT came out. I really didn\'t like the rebellion
(as I think about it now, I\'m not sure why). I wound up using my computer
to generate another "core" sector in a different galaxy, created the maps
(minus trade routes--I was going to figure them out as we went along,
but sadly the group broke up before we got too far into the campaign),
and wrote a background for it. I linked it to Traveller history by making
humanity\'s entrance to this galaxy the result of a misjump (stretching the
36 parsec rule, but, hey, I\'m the Referee!) and then projecting several
thousands of years into the future, allowing humanity to organize itself in
the form of another imperium in this galaxy. 

It worked well, allowing me to take CT adventures and plug them in
where I wanted, and allowing me to develop my own campaign
background. It\'s too bad the group only lasted about six months, or I\'d
have a lot more work done on it.

Don\'t wait too long!  I think this would be fascinating to see.  Would a
possible solution be to put it on a web page, where it would be accessible

	I would allow a Con+1/Str-1 for female characters rule,
	for the physical attributes. But if we increase Cha what

	I would advise a different rule: Whenever a charisma

I\'ve been thinking about this for a bit, and I think we are taking the wrong
approach getting so involved with the percentages and all.  Yes, it is an
interesting case study, but what we need to focus on is how to get the "to
hit" number to a reasonable position.  Look at this table to see what I mean...

   To Hit Number for Normal T4

Attrib-->  7     8     9     A     B     C     D     E     F
Skill
   1       8     9    10    11    12    13    14    15    16
   2       9    10    11    12    13    14    15    16    17
   3      10    11    12    13    14    15    16    17    18
   4      11    12    13    14    15    16    17    18    19
   5      12    13    14    15    16    17    18    19    20

No the problem, as I see it, is that moving one column to the right is the
same as moving one row down, or, a skill level is equal to an attribute
level.  When I posted the table for the average guy, they matched your
percents fairly closely, they were a bit skewed to being easy, but they were
real close.  So I think the issue is that we need to make the higher
attributes less powerful.

Now here is the same chart using the 4 + (attrib/2) + skill, which is the
best method so far, I think...  (can\'t remember whether to round up or down,
but I\'m gonna round down).

   To Hit Number for Method A

Attrib-->  7     8     9     A     B     C     D     E     F
Skill
   1       8     9     9    10    10    11    11    12    12
   2       9    10    10    11    11    12    12    13    13
   3      10    11    11    12    12    13    13    14    14
   4      11    12    12    13    13    14    14    15    15
   5      12    13    13    14    14    15    15    16    16

This definitely reduces the effect (or is it affect) that Attribute has on
the to hit number.  I like this method the best, but I don\'t know if it is best.

   To Hit Number for Method A          To Hit Number for Normal T4

Attrib-->1   2   3   4   5   6       Attrib-->1   2   3   4   5   6
Skill                                Skill
   1     5   6   6   7   7   8          1     2   3   4   5   6   7
   2     6   7   7   8   8   9          2     3   4   5   6   7   8
   3     7   8   8   9   9  10          3     4   5   6   7   8   9
   4     8   9   9  10  10  11          4     5   6   7   8   9  10
   5     9  10  10  11  11  12          5     6   7   8   9  10  11

Now for the lower Attribute number, it causes problems.  The plus 4 tends to
make failure much less likely.   Hmmm, well, this is just more wood for the
fire, I don\'t have a definite answer yet, but I am working on it.

That is a reasonable idea and if it is correct then I withdraw my critisism.
Indeed, I think it is an excellent idea to set aside areas as "Refs\' only".
It would also, IMO, be a good idea to tell the Referees about it. ;-)

Then there is the whole question of just how much it is appropiate to leave
for the individual referees. One of the strong points of an official 
setting (more or less the only one, come to think about it) is to help the
referee by providing him with more background material than he can manage
to create on his own. A careful balance must be struck. Leave too much open
and a referee might just as well create his own campaign setting and use
the official stuff as plug-ins.
	No, I\'m wrong. There is one other point to an official setting: To
make fan-created material easier to use by other fans.

Psions weren\'t regarded as scum in the early days of the 3rd Imperium.

The Imperials may have thought that, but the timespan of 10 years between
the first contact in 50 and the settlement of Mora (by a private company,
btw.  even if it was a Megacorporation) in 60 is awfully tight for a report 
to come back to Core,  be verified, an official policy formed and finally
implemented.

You can say that again! The Consulate ceased its expansion in -1000 "to
consolidate" and it hadn\'t resumed expansion (except to corewards) in
1100!

I certainly think that if the Imperium hadn\'t expanded into the Spinward
Marches then the Zhodani wouldn\'t even have colonized those few worlds in 
Cronor, Querion and Jewell that they did colonize. However, I\'m not saying 
that the Imperium would have realized that in 60. Still, it seems unlikely
that they would worry much about the Zhodani 150 parsecs away when there 
were plenty of other starfaring cultures closer to home.

Its arguable, anyway, but I don\'t think it\'s necessary to do so. The
Marches were explored and settled in leaps and bounds and it took many 
centuries to "fill in the cracks". Just because Mora was settled in 60
dosen\'tmean that Mora was settled by hordes of people. A few 100 people
would be enough to make a viable ressource extration outpost. A few
1000 enough to make a viable colony.

     Extraordinary movie, I know what you mean. Someone on the list did 
     post 
     the actual US name of the American re-make but I haven\'t been able to 
     find it. What was the name of the French actress? 
     
Anne Parillaud.  Now married to Luc Besson.  Try and catch her in "Innocent 
Blood".  Not in the same league as Nikita, but still fun.
     
     A local cinema recently played a double feature with Nikita and a 
     movie 
     called Diva. I had seen both before on video so I didn\'t bother to go 
     because Diva absolutely suxs and is nowhere near the same quality of 
     Nikita. 
     
You missed the chance to see Nikita at the cinema?  Poor fool ;-).  It\'s 
well worth seeing if you get the chance - the experience is so much more 
intense than video.
     
     Tell me more about this Sci fi movie? and what are your other five 
     favourite films?
     
Well, I have about twenty top-five favourite films ;-), but here\'s a few:
Star Wars IV-VI(natch), Alien, Aliens, The Terminator, Reservoir Dogs, The 
Usual Suspects, Nikita, Leon, When Harry Met Sally, Rear Window, Some Like 
it Hot, The African Queen, Groundhog Day, Strictly Ballroom, Cyrano do 
Bergerac... I\'d better stop there.
     
     I especially like the part when the mad cleanup guy arrives with his 
     jars of acid. It is just so frighteningly credible. It always makes me 
     think how great the RPG Top Secret could have been if I had got around 
     to playing it more often.
     
Yeah, good old Jean Reno as Victor nettoyeur.  I had real problems with his 
character in Mission: Impossible; he was just so un-cool after Leon (which 
was released as "The Professional" in the US, IIRC - what is it about 
Besson\'s films being renamed?) and Nikita.

For my fix of Techno-Thriller roleplaying, I tend to play Millenium\'s End.  
It also made me do a lot of research on Florida, which came in handy when I 
went there on holiday last year :-).
     

Luc\'s new film is called "Le Cinquieme element", aka "The Fifth Element" 
which has been recently renamed "The Fifth Man".  I\'m trying not to get too 
excited about it, because most of the films I look forward to seeing don\'t 
live up to my expectations (ID4, Alien^3, Stargate).  Anyway, "just the 
facts, ma\'am...":
     
Le Cinquieme Element is a sci-fi film set in the future (500 years); 
directed by Luc Besson; music by Eric Serra (hooray!); budget $75m; filming 
in Pinewood studios; release summer 97 (US); cast includes Bruce Willis, 
Milla Jovovich, Lee Evans, Gary Oldman (and I\'ll take any bets that Jean 
Reno appears, too ;-) ).  There is great secrecy about the plot, but there 
are rumours of a cab driver in NY (unless someone is pulling my leg).

Proot!

The American remake with Bridget Fonda is "Point of No Return".  Unless
you\'re a big Bridget Fonda fan, don\'t bother seeing it if you\'ve seen "La
Femme Nikita" since it is exaclty the same movie, except in English.

I went into a rental place to get the american film, walked out with the
French one since they were out of the former.  Three weeks later rented
the American version and had Deja Vu all throught the flick.

Both were really good though.

     Subject: Cleon and the Marches

[...]
     The Vilani are a highly conservative race, and around Year Zero they      
     have spent over 1000 years in a state of emergency: fighting Vargr corsairs
     (some armed with alarmingly high-tech weaponry, possibly of Zhodani 
     origin); the perfidious Zhodani known to be lurking *somewhere* behind the 
     Great Rift; and the land-ravenous and warlike Aslan rumoured to have 
     crossed the Rift as well. 

     In these circumstances, the Vilani may have been in secret 
     negotiations with Cleon for some time. They agreed to 
     join the Imperium immediately, if Cleon could secure their 
     core-spinward frontiers against the possibility of Vargr, Zhodani, and 
     even Aslan, encroachment. Later developments that support this: the 
     rapid push into what became the Domain of Deneb, despite the massive 
     military effort required to secure and patrol Corridor against Vargr 
     incursion; and the extremely rapid colonisation of the Marches. 
     
     The Vilani may have also used the \'carrot\' of super-technologies 
     present in the Marches, in the form of numerous Ancient sites and 
     Darrian worlds. 
     
     Comments? Reactions? *Any* response to any of my posts? 
     I\'m starting to feel like a late-night radio DJ here. Surely this list 
     can\'t be entirely made up of lurkers, statisticians and religious 
     fundamentalists. :]
     Is *anybody* interested in discussing Traveller history, or should I shut 
     up for good? 

Nonononono! Don\'t shut up! I\'ve stopped posting on this subject only 
because I\'ve said my piece and people have responded to it. (I\'m the guy
who thinks that it\'s ancient artifacts that Cleon\'s after.

I think that your analysis of how the Vargr and Vilani fit into all this
is very interesting. The V&V are two races that I tend to ignore more
than I should in my campaign. Your explanations are very compelling and
plausible. I definately plan to use them in my Milieu 0 campaign when I
start running it next week.

Someone complained here last week that it\'s tough to run a M0 campaign because
there is so little background published for it. These discussions on the
TML are my only resource (besides the T4 book and my imagination) for
ideas regarding M0.

Keep on posting! I certainly will as soon as another interesting idea
infects my brain. 8^)

One question tho. How were the Vilani organised in this period? I assume
they didn\'t have an effective interstellar government, otherwise Sylea
would have joined them, and not vice versa.

Zhodani trade with Aslans in Trojan Reaches in the 4th or 5th Century (I
don\'t have my timeline with me).

Yes, BUT... Given the propable size of any Vargr state the news would have
been fitlered through at least a dozen links. How serious do you think the
Vilani will take them? And what about all the OTHER rumours... those that
dosen\'t happen to have core of truth? We know that the Zhodani had this
huge, but completely quiscent realm, but would Cleon believe in it?
Wouldn\'t he assume that any empire that big 2000 years ago that hadn\'t
reached Core in 2000 years must have collapsed long ago? I would.

No, _Darrians_ clearly state that the scouts of the two nations didn\'t 
happen to come across each other during the time that Darrian had jump
technology.

A 1000 year old emergency isn\'t one. It may be a balance of terror, but
obviously the Vilani can live with their Vargr neighbours (since they
_have_ lived with them and survived ;-)

I don\'t think higher-than-usual tech weaponry would make it through 20
links into the hands of any neighbours of Vland. Assuming for purposes
of argument that the Zhodani would sell high-tech weapons to neighbours
who are liable to use them against themselves -- a very iffy proposition
to start with -- those Vargr would use them to raid and conquer _their_
neighbours. Why trade when you can take? (And remember, there are no
criminals among the Zhodani. If the Consulate dosen\'t want weapons sold
to Vargr neighbours, there are no enterprising private individuals to
run guns).

I refer to my previous argument about rumours. They would be only a few
true rumours among scores of false ones and they would be no more likely
to be believed just because they happened to be true.

Yes, I\'m interested and no, please don\'t shut up!!  The Traveller history is
the most interesting thing about the game, although I find the gaps and
implausibilities exasperating.

Most exasperating gap: big holes in the history of Terra.

Most exasperating implausibility: the various minor human races were
allegedly transplanted by the Ancients 300K years ago, which means the
source genus was Homo Habilis.  Nevertheless, all transplanted peoples
eventually evolved into essentially identical Homo Sapiens.  I love the idea
of transplanted hominids, but wish it had been more scientifically thought out.

This is a given, we want to be T4 compatible.

Rather than a whole new system, it seems like you can achieve these
results by simply adding to the tables for the starship construction
system(s).  

for example; Asteroid and buffered asteroid are just new "hull materials"
with a very big factor for hull material volume.  Other additions would be
additional life support options, "shipyard" sized small craft/subcraft
bays, fractional G thrusters/drives, etc.

Again, in what way that is different from the ship design systems (which
allow you to figure the volume of each component)?

Space stations, orbital facilities, etc are basically large ships without
(major) drives.  Each facility is going to have it\'s own purpose which
determines what the major portion of the volume of the facility is taken
up by.  An ore processing facility, for example, will have the majority of
its interior devoted to ore refining equipment and ore/material transport
equipment.

What\'s needed then, is instructions and table additions for components of
orbital facilities to add to the starship construction tables.

Lets stick to real-world examples, which are TL7 or so.

I think its a great idea, as an add-on.

No, please don\'t stop. I\'ve not played traveller in years (even managed to completely miss
MT) and one of the more frustrating bits about pulling out the black books, TNE, 
and T4 is that I\'m missing a unified time line. 

What you\'re providing is a time line with historical context, something that I\'ve looked
for for a long time. My BA is in history (don\'t ask why I\'m a UNIX admin) and once I 
grew out of the munchkin phase, I started trying to place my campaigns in a context. The
lack of this, and the lack of time/inclination to build one from scratch is one reason
I\'ve been gone from the Traveller Universe.

Hopefully, I\'ve not missed any pieces of the postings. I will offer, however, to put
the entry up on my WWW pages if somebody has not already. I\'ve unfortunately not had 
the time in the last couple of weeks to read it carefully and post in reply.

Oh yes it was.

Oh no it wasn\'t. Hmm...seems the US title was _Point of No Return_. Whatever

Well, if you come up with another plan for tasks, please let me know!

I still haven\'t found a method that I think is perfect.  The idea of 
getting rid of the half dies and using 1.5/2/3/4/5/6 dice is appealing, 
though.

	No, Michael, you\'ve just run into the \'really good post\' syndrome. 
It\'s happened to everyone who has posted stuff to this list. You work 
your a** off putting something really cool together, post it, and it 
vanishes without a trace.

	More often than not, it\'s because the people see it, go \'COOL!!\' and 
it\'s sucked from the mail inbox to their files and/or notebooks.

	It\'s only the bad, controversial, or the posts where numbers can be
tossed about, (or rocks ;-) that generate the huge volume of traffic
on this list.  I\'ve personally posted the occasional \'huge thing\'
and seen it drop without a trace; some people send me a private
note, saying, essentially: "Cool!" and that\'s it.


>Is *anybody* interested in discussing Traveller history, or should I shut up
>for good? 

	Part of the problem, absent input from Marc or anyone at IG, we 
don\'t know what "Imperial History" is going to be; witness the Core 
Map in the T4 manual that has people in an uproar.

	Another part of the problem, at least in my case, is that I\'m 
usually several miles from my reference material when I read this, 
and many points of canon \'history\' turn on obscure references in 
things like the MT Players Encyclopedia, old TNS posts from JTAS and 
Challenge, or Survival Margin. so I can\'t often comment. Another is 
that early history of the imperium also turns on only a few lines in these 
sources...you just posted what is known about the reign of Cleon I.

	But, part what you\'re saying does make a great deal of sense, and would 
account for the rapid assimilation of Vilani space into the Imperium 
for protection from the Vargr.

	Less likely is the influence of the Zhodani, the Daryen, (and even 
less likely) the influence of Ancient sites in the Marches.  I doubt, 
in fact (not knowing the origin of devices like black and white 
globes, though) that any Ancient device has ever advanced Imperial 
technology. Every time I\'ve seen them mentioned they\'re always 
incrutable, usually wildly dangerous devices:

	" Hey Joe, poke at that thing with this stick!"

	POOF

	"Hey! Where\'d Joe go?"

	In fact, I\'ve never seen the appeal of the Marches to the Imperium, 
(as opposed, of course to PC\'s), since they\'re off on the other side 
of the nearly impossible to cross Rift, dicing it out with two large 
empires (Zho\'s and Aslan), they\'re deficient in heavy metals, etc. 
etc.

	Aside from being the setting of \'canon\' Traveller until TNE, I don\'t 
see why the Imperium pushed there at all, especially considering that 
it was STILL a frontier 1100 years later! Why not push rimward and 
antispinward instead?  The Julian Protectorate stopped coreward 
expansion, but what about rimward?  I can\'t see that the K\'Kree would 
have stopped the Imperium from heading \'east\' too much; as someone 
said, the sheer amount of metal they have to haul around in their 
ships makes them inferior opponents, fleet for fleet.

You think like me. That is the system I use. (I never liked those D3\'s
anyway, difficult and needless.) And I have some statistical savvy. So
here goes...

Avg=2D, Diff=3D, Form=4D, Stag=5D, Imp=6D.
Numbers are rounded to the nearest percent.

  Absolutely - that\'s one of the reasons I\'m a confirmed ace in StarFleet
Battles, Air Superiority, and Real Jets(tm).

  If are always one step ahead of the enemy, they\'ll be REacting; not
ACTING. This gives you the initiative, and given enough luck a win.
(Assuming roughly comparable forces, of course - taking a scout against a
BB is _still_ suicide ;)

been made by others concerning novels they thought echoed the 
Traveller-type universe.  I thought I might add my own two cents.

The Icerigger trilogy (Icerigger, Mission to Moulikan, and The Deluge 
Drivers) are an excellent source of material.  They cncern the 
adventurers of several Imperial citizens who blunder into a botched 
kidnapping job aboard an Imperial liner and end up stranded in the 
outback of a barely settled artic world.  I converted the first book into 
a two month campaign under the original Traveller rules and my players 
loved it.

The Forbidden Borders series by Michael Gear is another that I feel would 
translate excellently into a Traveller campaign.  It has just the right 
mix of exploration, ground combat, and fleet maneuvers to satisfy a 
diverse group of players.

If anyone else has run adventures based on these works I would be 
interested in hearing about them.

Actually I could.  :)
What\'s missing here is two things:
	1) How do you handle spectacular failure?  Spectacular success is
	easy, two 1\'s.  But how do you handle the increasing chance of
	spectacular failure?

	2) Many people have commented on how much the T4 system gives

    Yes 26% seems like a pretty high chance of a Spectacular failure, but 
these tasks are supposed to be Impossible, right?  26% auto-fail, even for
someone with super-skills, seems more reasonable to my tastes than 75%+
success rates!
    As of right now, I\'m throwing my support (for what it\'s worth) behind 
the "whole-die" system, which seems to give pretty good results based on
the numbers I\'ve seen posted.
    As for the imbalance of stats to skills, I consider that to be an
entirely different matter, and i didn\'t want to confuse the two issues.  As
a CT/MT player I\'d like for skills to count more, but remember that in TNE
we had more or less the same sort of situation as we do now.  As far as
giving skill-points their due, the "4+ half-stat+ skill" system seems 
pretty fair except that I find that "mystical" 4 extremely aesthetically
unpleasing; almost a throw-back to the CT "mystical 8".
     Although it involves some unpleasant (at least for me) in-game maths,
the "fix" (which I use in quotes \'cause it\'s not really "broken", it\'s just
not my style) I like best of what I\'ve seen so far is the 1/2 stat + 2 skill
which, for mid-range numbers, will give similar results, but shifts the
emphasis back to where I think it belongs.
     Perhaps in future editions of T4, IG can include a paragraph or two
about such "Task System Options" (like they did with the multiple Initiative
rules) allowing individual refs to customize their games.  The "more 
difficult" rolls could be an option, and so could the "skill-focused" 
system. Now we all just need to agree as to what is the best way to achieve
these effects.

Keep up the good work, stat-guys!

Thanks for the interesting discussion, i think you have made an excellent 
case as to why Cleon expanded towards the Marches so rapidly.

This does bring into question the confusion that is common about the Long 
Night.

TNE is about the post-virus era.  Except for the Regency, the whole of 
the Imperium, and all of its neighbors except the Hivers, have been totally 
trashed.  99% of worlds are pre-spaceflight and many are pre-industrial.

The Long Night/Year 0 is (thankfully) not like this at all.  Sylea has 
been an active force in space for the last 650 years, The Zhodani and 
Vargr have been fine, and even the Vilani have been somewhat active 
(Vland, and a few other Vilani worlds never lost starflight), and the 
Solomani were settling Gateway Sector during the Long Night.

Even at its worst, in the early years, The Long Night looked like the Hard 
Times Era, not the post-Virus era.  Sure, lots of isolated, vacuum world
colonies died, economies collapsed, many worlds lost starflight, but the 
collapse was basically economic.  Fully habitable industrial worlds would 
have been able to recover fairly rapidly.  

it seems clear that The Long Night is a time of much commerce, trade,
piracy and other interstellar activity.  The difference is that there is
nothing resembling a central government.  If you travel 20 parsecs in any
direction you may well have passed through two trading federations and a
bunch of unclaimed worlds and ended up orbiting a world more likely to
seize your ship that to trade with you.  Raiding and piracy would be
common except in systems held by the more powerful worlds (who may well be
sending out pirates of their own). 

The true wonder of Year 0 campaigns is going out into other sectors and
either helping to bring word of a new Imperium to the various factions, or
to go trading with folks beyond the fringe of the Imperium, who will be
known to you (and you to them) only though rumor and middlemen. 

You have a setting in some ways similar to the era of Marco Polo\'s travels
to Cathay:  Various kingdoms, both large and small linked together by
fragile trade networks, with distant kingdoms being linked only by
middlemen and legend.  An exciting time to say the least. As part of this,
Cleon has heard legends and reports of the Spinward Marches, and is
seeking to explore and conquer this legendary region, full of Ancient
ruins other surprises. 

However, the bit in T4 about part of the Core subsector being unexplored
is simply silly.  The Sylean Federation has existed for 650 years, it
doesn\'t take that 1/10th that long to explore an entire subsector. 

Anyway, thanks for the informative post.

Trying to shift the table by 3 points would be a pain...but we could

I like a "heroic" feel sometimes and a "realistic" feel other times. 
I\'d like to see the design of the task system be broad enough to
accomidate either. It really should be broad enough so that I can use
the higher levels for the harder (realistic) feel and easier task levels
for times (and games) where I want the heroic feel.

You aren\'t alone. There are quite a few of us that don\'t use the

I don\'t go that far, but I do reduce the time in Jmp space for advanced
drives. I want the length of time in JSpace to still be several days,
because I *really* like the slow communication/transportation feel of
Traveller.  I also want the time in JSpace to be variable for gaming
purposes.  Over the years I developed the following formula....

   ((160-(Jump#-1)*15)+3d6)hrs

This gives the following hours in JSpace...

Jump 1	160 hrs + 3d6 [163-178]
Jump 2	145 hrs + 3d6 [148-163]
Jump 3	130 hrs + 3d6 [133-148]
Jump 4	115 hrs + 3d6 [118-133]
Jump 5	100 hrs + 3d6 [103-118]
Jump 6	 85 hrs + 3d6 [ 88-103]

If you have a squadron of ships then the "Master Astrogator" makes the
jump calculation and the ships jump as a group.   

I also allow ships to be constructed or modified to be "Jump# Plus"
ships.  This means they have better sensors, controls, jump grids,
coils, and powerplants than normal ship\'s of that Jump number, but not
quite up to the next Jump rating. A "Jump Plus" ship can *attempt* a
jump one level higher than their normal rating, but there are a series
of Formidable tasks the crew has to pass: the Engineer has to make a
"Coil Tuning" task; the Pilot has to make a "Piloting" task; and the
Astrogator has to make a "Astrogation" task. If any of the tasks fail
then a Jump Error occurs, this could be a misjump, hardware failure, or
the ship just remains where it was with the lose of fuel. BTW, Jump+
ships stay in JSpace longer too, 
foex: a Jump 1+ ship attempting a Jump 2 would still take 163-178 hours
to make the jump. (Honestly, I might make the tasks Staggering or
Impossible with T4 tasks just to make them hard enough. <g>)

CT never had "spectacular failures," so I didn\'t worry about them.  If 
you like \'em, use a natural roll of 2 as spec. success, and a natural 
roll of the maximum possible for the dice rolled as spec. failure.  I\'d 
just say max roll is always a failure, though.

	I also have to blame us, we are also not using the canon
	week. We are using a slightly diffent aproach :

	The jump takes 7*24*parsec/jumpdrive hours, and you have
	to be very far away from gravity.

	You have to drift exactly in the direction you wanna jump,
	and need to be size*size*10 light seconds away from the
	gravity well.

	So a Jayhawk capable of 24ghours, can spend 10 ghours
	for outbound velocity and an other 10 for inbound and
	can jump at :

		Size	Light Sec	Time to save jump (max 10*1g)
		 0         0             0
		 1	  10		 2
		 2	  40		 4
		 3	  90		 7
		 4	 160		 9
		 5	 250		11
		 6	 360		14
		 7	 490		17
		 8	 640		21
		 9	 810		25
		10	1000		30
		11	1210		31
		12	1440		41

	So a Jayhawk jumping from one parsec from a medium sized
	planet (7) to a large gas giant would make 10 hours thrust
	7 hours drift, 84 hours jump, 31 hours drift and 10 hours
	thrust. So it would take less than a week (168 hours),
	A 2 parsec jump from a huge planet (8) to an asteroid
	belt is a bit crasy as you would need 10 hours thrust
	to get away from the planet, but you\'ll be dumped directly
	into the asteroid belt with 4 light seconds per hour !

	An also very nice implication of our rule is that you can
	disturb and hinder a ship from jumping away. If you fire on
	it, and it makes evasion, its leaving course, and has to
	get rid of you to get back on course.

I don\'t *know* that my idea is correct, but Marc (and I think Ken too)

Sure, but the galaxy is a *big* place. There should be room for both
pre-generated and customized systems.

True.  There should be some core systems well detailed, here and there,
but I\'m personally not a "canonist", I heavily modify the settings
anyway. I want detailed background material, but I want it in a generic
format so I *can* transplant it to my campaign when I want to.

I don\'t see the problem here.  If you post a system/world description
for XYZ, I can plug it in anywhere in my universe.  It gets just a
little more complicated with multiple system scenerios, but only just a
little.

I\'m toying with using the following: Attribute + (Aptitude*Skill) =
Target Number

Aptitude could be a simple number (2 has been suggested), but better for
it to be something that reflects the psychological makeup of the
Character.  I *know* I\'ve moving pretty from from vanilla Traveller with
this. <g>

I feel the same way.  I\'ve bought several adventures, but I never run
them "as is." I simply use them as sources of ideas, background material
(like maps, deckplans, NPC), and springboards for the *next* adventure. 
I figure if I can buy the adventure so can my players, and what I want
isn\'t just a "sense of the unknown and unexpected", but a sense of dread
and forboding! <g>

The perfect Adventure Book, IMO, would *be* a suppliment!  Give me some
worlds, some deckplans, some NPCs, some organizations, some adventure
hooks, and I\'ll mould them into adventures that fit the players in my
game.

And this *alone* is a good reason to dump the idea. It screws up the
flavor of the game. It also not only makes piracy *possible*, but
*easy*. I watch you jump out, jump to your destination ahead of you,
and have a day or so to position myself where my best guess readings of
your jump out say you will jump in. Not good.

Worse, the problem you haven\'t considered. If a J5 ship can jump 1
parsec in 1/5th of a week (33.6 hours), it can jump one AU in .58
*seconds*. Why bother with manuever drives except to/from the 100
diameter limit. And space battles become a joke.

My tracking station with it\'s huge antenna spots you, beams a message
to a waiting task force and next thing you know, you are surrounded by
ships. Worse, if they can do multiple jumps, they can jump in, acquire
you as a target, fire, and jump out before your return fire gets there.

J-1 ships would be sitting ducks.

I have always though it should be played this way. I wrote up an article for a 
games magazine called \'Overdrive\' that put some gloss on this concept. The 
magazine stopped doing RPG articles shortly afterwards. I think it is more fun.

But then I won\'t go into my jump variant that involves dozens of light years and 
200 by 200 LY sectors...

MILIEU 0: The Third Imperium
The essential background for adventuring in Traveller is provided in a number
of Milieu books, each detailing an era in the long history of mankind in
space. Milieu 0 chronicles the emergence of the Third Imperium from the Long
Night, extending its reach to re-explore and re-conquer the vast interstellar
territories that have been untouched for 1700 years. Covers the early years
of the Third Imperium, its history, structure, economics, and library data.
Also includes many adventure hooks and adds direction to players and
Referees.

FIRST SURVEY
This vital companion to Milieu 0 is an atlas of the 50 or so sectors that
were the Vilani Empire and its surrounding territories. The star systems of
the Sylean Federation are well defined. Farther and farther out, systems are
less well-defined. Each adventuring group determines its own survey results
for each system they visit.
Each page is a map of a single sector; systems are marked, but not defined or
identified except for some specified areas.

There actually has been a fair bit of material published concerning 
jumpspace theory (speculative, though it is) and jumpspace phenomenae.  
You just haven\'t read it, probably.  DGP\'s "Starship Operator\'s Handbook" 
(published for MegaTraveller) was, in my opinion, the best resource on this.

One could make that assumption if they hadn\'t read FF&S.  In that text, it 
is clearly stated that j-space and subspace are NOT the same thing, 
insofar as the descriptions given for each vary widely.  They are not 
even the same \'technology.\'  If they were, why would jump drives be the 
\'official\' FTL drives in the Imperium setting, while subspace technology 
is an \'alternate\' that does not apply to the mainstream Traveller 
setting, but was proposed as something that could be used by referees and 
players desiring a different setting?

It\'s probably a good thing that subspace technology isn\'t part of the 
\'standard\' setting, too.  A large part of Charted Space\'s history and 
background is shaped by the limited speed of communication over 
interstellar distances (just look at how astrographic separation saved 
the Domain of Deneb -- twice).  The parsecs-per-day travel times afforded 
by the alternate subspace technology for both starships and 
communications would totally disfigure the canonical background, such as 
it is.

HA!  Based on the conversations we\'ve had about "d6" vs "all others", I

Here\'s a general question...

Why do we insist on normal distributions for task rolls, anyway? (And
don\'t invoke the dreaded canon! <g>) Why don\'t we just go to straight
percentage rolls?

I don\'t have a problem with this per se, by definition, someone with a
_skill level of 1_ in those skills should have an equal chance of
success.

I _do_ have a problem with the fact that the average bloke with average
skill has an average chance of succeeding at an impossible task.

What plasters me is the way the monikers don\'t jibe with the numbers. 

I have been reading with interest the excellent probability charts
posted by Joe Walsh et al. The problem: Probability curve is to flat
going from Average to Impossible for characters with moderate skill
levels.

Here\'s my solution, simplistic as it may be: Change the Die Formulae.
For instance, for each die or half die used above 2, add 1 to the roll:

Average      2d6
Difficult    2d6+d3+1
Formidable   3d6+1
Staggering   3d6+d3+2
Impossible   4d6+2

Statistitians: Get to Work! What are the probabilities with this? Should
it be add 2 per full die, 1 per half die? Does this knock the prob\'s out
the window at low skill levels? Am I out to lunch?

The beauty of the system, IMNSHO, is that it requires little math, and
the 2 sixes=bad failure rule is still in effect.

As for the attribute being weighted to heavily, I don\'t mind. Someone
with very little natural ability (eg. incredibly clumsy) needs to be
_very_ skilled to be as good as the average skilled person - so if he
has a Dex of 2, skill of 6 then his target is 8, the same as someone
with a Dex of 7 and skill of 1. Similarly, the very gifted skilled
person, (Dex of 12+1=13) needs the same target as the average person who
is very skilled (7+6=13) I can accept this. Of course, very skilled
gifted people are gods.

Those who can\'t accept the ability being weighted to heavily, can use
the above dice formulae with the 4 + (stat/2) + skill target number. If
I were to change my mind and decide stat\'s weren\'t as important, that\'s
the one I\'d use :)

I\'ll buy the con/str idea only because the + to con offsets the - to str, 
but if I were a GM (Stu bears that title), I think I\'d opt for a straight -1 
to str and leave it at that.  There is no charisma/empathy attribute in 
Traveller.  Social Standing certainly wouldn\'t be gender biased.  Int & Edu 
wouldn\'t be.  Dex/Agil? well, I wouldn\'t want to even suggest that men 
couldn\'t have a dex of 15, nor would I suggest that as a rule of thumb women 
are more dextrous than men... my own household not withstanding <g>.

   OK, then I\'m sure the world would love to hear the details concerning the
**conclusive** proof you have that God doesn\'t exist.  I\'m sure there is at
least a PhD in Philosophy in it for you.

   Note I said *conclusive*.  Unfortunately for your case, there has been
enough
things that have happened in the last 15+ billion years that still defy a
logical or
scientific explanation so that there is still room for God in the Universe.
 Shooting
down a few paragraphs in Genesis is not the same as conclusive proof, nor is
evidence that Jesus really was just a carpenter\'s son from Galilee.  The
proof you need may never be available to Mankind--and unless you can obtain
it, you have to conceed the *possibility* of God, regardless of how unlikely
his/her/its existence seems to you.  Your only alternative is to take a leap
of faith similar to the one believer\'s in God take, and say "I believe that
God doesn\'t exist."

Actually, teenagers (and young adults) have a _higher_ disposable income than
most adults.  Why?  Because many live at home and pay no room and board.

I have students that earn hundreds of dollars a month, and spend it all. 
They spend more on games than I could afford to, even before I got a
mortgage!

Not saying that cost isn\'t important, but age-population demographics contain
a lot of surprises!

You are making two assumptions here.  

First, that one ship can tell where another ship is jumping to.  If you
want to follow a ship jumping out in one of my games you have a big
problem..that ship could be jumping to any system in it\'s range, and you
have no way of knowing which one.  A pursueing force has to spread out,
covering all possible systems...and that can quickly become a
*dangerous* task. <g>

Second, that you can make "short haul" jumps.  In my games, a ship has
to be over 200 stellar diameters out to jump, and it can leave jump only
within 2 stellar diameters.   I don\'t allow any of this jumping into a
system within "spitting" distance of a planet. If you want to get to a
planet you have to *travel* through the system.  If you want to jump
again, then you have to tranverse most of the inner system first.

See Leonard, once you toss out canon on one thing you can toss it on
several.  You just need to think it out and be *internally* consistent.

Spires  E894789-2
          Size: Large : D=12,800km              Atmosphere: Dense Tainted
          Hydrographics: 40%                    Population: 40 million
          Government:Civil Service Bureaucracy  Law Level: High
          Tech Level: 2 (Circa 1600)            Star port:  Frontier

World Description:
	Spires is a very new planet, only a few primitive plants had evolved 
by -1385 when the planet was colonized.  The Second Imperium seeded the 
planet with modified versions of Terran plants and animals.  These species 
were genetically engineered to better survive in the dense atmosphere.  
	Spires is mostly land, with 4 small seas, and dozens of large lakes 
scattered about.  There is the High Sea, near the north pole, Two Middle 
Seas, called the Upper Middle Sea, and the Lower Middle Sea and a Low Sea 
near the southern pole.  These seas are fresh water and are the only 
significant area where native species survive. 
    The planet currently is in an age of extreme vulcanism, with hundreds of
active volcanos. Earthquakes are also common. The volcanos spew tons of 
rock and ash into the air tainting the atmosphere.  Visitors often remark 
about the smell of the place, the volcanos also spew sulfur compounds into 
the air, giving the entire planet the aroma of rotten eggs.  This volcanism
has also created a great deal of obsidian, with which the populace turns 
into many different types of tools.
	Most Spiri live around the Middle Seas, but Spiri have explored their 
entire planet. Spiri who seek isolation have settled in the far reaches of 
the planet.  The area around the Middle Seas is temperate plains, excellent 
for farming.

History:
	Spires was colonized during the Rule of Man, by settlers from Terra 
itself. During the Long Night, their civilization collapsed and they 
regressed to a very primitive state. Since then their technological 
development has been hampered by the fact that there are very few workable 
metal deposits, and that the planet lacks fossil fuels.  When the planet was
discovered by the expanding Third Imperium, it was interdicted.  The Scout 
Service thought the planet was an interesting anthropology setup, and wanted
to observe it develop.  When the Dawn League surveyed the system they 
discovered the primitive Spiri. Unlike the Imperium the Dawn League didn\'t 
think humans made "interesting experiments" and they contacted the Spiri.  
The Spiri were delighted to find out that other humans existed; all 
knowledge of Terra and the Rule of Man had become the basis for myths and 
legends.  The Spiri were quick to join the Dawn League and many individuals
wanted to help explore the stars.

Government:
	Spires is governed by the Guilds, the Guilds were set up millenia ago, 
as a way to regulated trade.  Since then they have grown in power and in 
scope. They now regulate almost all aspects of life.  The Guilds have grown
into a sizable, bureaucracy.  It can take several months for news and 
information to travel from one side of the planet to the other, because of 
this the Guilds are slow to react to unexpected problems.  
    To help solve this problem, every 10 years, the finest men and women 
come to Yuko, the capital of Spires, There they compete in the Contest of 
Champions.   The Contest of Champions is a series of races, 
athletic competitions, and mental puzzles.  The winner is made Archon, or 
supreme ruler of Spires.  The Archon is the nominal head of the Guilds, but
has little to do with day to day business, but when a decision needs to be
made, instead of forming a committee, the Archon decides.  He is kept up to
date on issues, by a council of advisors.  The council is made up of the
other top contestants in the Contest.  The Archons from previous years 
wander the planet as roving problem solvers. 

Culture:
	Most Spiri are very spiritual, and spiritual matters are given 
considerable thought.  All Spiri are given a basic education.  This 
education usually lasts 5 years. It concentrates on teaching students basic 
mathematics, and how to read and write.  A small amount of history and 
rhetoric are also taught.  The ability to think for oneself is instilled in 
all children at an early age.  The education starts at age 5, by the time 
the students turn 10, they are needed to work in the fields.  

	The population of Spiri lives in many small villages, and a few large 
cities of several hundred thousand. Agriculture is the primary industry of 
the villages. Each of the small villages shares a common religious or 
spiritual belief.  Religion on Spires is very sectarian, when an 
irreconcilable disagreement over a spiritual matter arise, the solution, 
usually involves the minority leaving the community and setting up a new
village somewhere else.  Off world anthropologists suggest that this also 
helps alleviate population pressure.

	The cities are much more metropolitan, they began as small towns on 
important trade routes.  Thousands of people eventually came to live and to
prosper as merchants.  The mixing of people of many different faiths, 
created some conflict, but for the most part, the Spiri are nonviolent when 
it comes to Spiritual matters.  To help insure that disagreements remain 
non-violent, the Guild has prohibited the carrying of weapons.  

	In the capital of Yuko, the Guilds have formed a center for higher 
learning, the Academy of Higher Thought.  Here the best and the brightest 
Spiri are educated. Children who have excelled in the basic education are 
sent to the Academy to learn more.  The Academy develops both the mind and 
the body.  Students are taught philosophy, history, logic, mathematics and 
what science the Spiri know. The body is developed through athletics and 
through the martial arts. Many Contest winners have received an education
here.	 
 
Society:
	The Spiri are a very spiritual people.  They follow many different
creeds and beliefs, but the most common is a version of Plato\'s idea of
forms, mutated through 5000 years of history.  The basic principle of the 
theory of forms states that for all objects there exists on another plane,
the perfect form of that object. When one person says "chair," another knows
what the first means, even though they might be thinking of another variety
of chair.  It is because they both have a common language that "chairness"
implies the same sort of object. A form, then is an extra-planar perfect
definition.

    As to the radical variant of Platonic thought, it refers specifically
to some of the conclusions of The Republic. There, Plato argued that the 
perfect form of government would be a benevolent dictatorship. Now, this 
obviously is in conflict with the nature of the Spiri.  Therefore, the 
Spiri accept Plato\'s Theory of Forms, his Rhetoric Style, and the Socratic 
Method, but reject the benevolent dictatorship.

    The Spiri view psionics as the ability to work on the Plane of Forms. 
They might view the benevolent dictatorship as possible of the Plane of 
Forms, but not in a flawed universe with flawed people. They would argue 
that a philosopher-king, even if he understood the Form of the Good, would 
be tainted by an imperfect universe.

	The Spiri believe that Plato was Philosopher King of the ancient 
civilization of Atlantis.  The Atlantis myth is a myth of mystically 
powerful people who, for a while, brought much good. Later, they became 
despotic. The exact location of Atlantis is quite disputed, most Spiri
believe that Atlantis is on the mythical home of the Spiri, Earth.  Others
believe that the Spiri were always on Spires, and that Atlantis is hiding 
somewhere on the planet.  These Spiri have set off on many great quests to
find Atlantis.  

	Once Spires joined the Reformation Coalition, it learned the truth,
that Earth is not Atlantis, but people, technologically advanced people, 
but people none the less. This event has precipitated a spiritual crisis on 
Spires and some religions would have ended, or become more fundamental in 
their denial of reality. There are a number of cults which deny that Earth 
is the mythical Atlantis and would go off in search of the true
Atlantians.  			 

Spires only had a fragment of the Dialogues of Plato.  The copies that they
did have have been copied and recopied, translated and retranslated over the 
millenia, the result is quite different than the originals.  Now that the 
planet has contact with other planets, it is able to get copies that are 
closer to the originals.  Many people have expressed an interest in reading
the "new" dialogues, and the Academy has bought many copies from off world
publishers and is distributing them across the country.  They are also sending
wandering teachers, to discuss the significance of the new writings.  Other
cults deny the new "rediscovered dialogues" and consider them false. The 
Academy is viewed by these people as either, in the best case, misguided, 
and in the worst, heretics.

Psi and the Spiri
    The presence of psi among the Spiri is rare, and a trait which is
passed in a matrilinear fashion, but only manifests itself in males of
the Spiri. The families which possessed this trait quickly became
important, and in a manner of speaking, the local gentry. Not that
there are any classes among the Spiri, but the families possessing this
trait came to be the mediators of disputes. The pursuit of psi powers
among the Spiri has led to almost a cessation of aggressive tendencies
and an almost fanatical devotion to development of the mind and
philosophy. This focus on the development of the mind and the body has led
to the Great Houses leading an aestic lifestyle, and they tend to have few
children.  So, despite there power, the Psi among the Spiri do not often 
hold important posts in the government or bureaucracy, although they are
usually treated with a certain degree of deference by all.

	The Great Houses of the Spiri believe that the psi ability originated
among citizens of the long fabled Lost Continent of Atlantis. Their
philosophical leanings are a radical variant of Platonic thought. The
technology level is low by choice. While they accept the theories
of forms, the reject the benevolent dictator on empirical grounds:
there never has been one. Rather, they favor individual freedoms above
all else and most of the government is geared towards protecting
individual freedoms {6}.

	They are aware of the fear (and possibly hatred) that many outworlders
feel towards individuals possessing psionic abilities. They are therefore 
careful in their use of it - only using it when necessary and for good.   
Other Spiri know about, but do not understand their abilities, but the Great 
Houses leave them alone, so they return the favor.  Some intellectuals have 
tried to research psionics.  The Great Houses don\'t mind this, every person 
much pursue his own destiny, and possibly an non-psionic will have insights 
that a psionic individual would not.

      The Spiri believe that outworlders place too much emphasis on 
technology and not enough on development of the mind. They fear the 
Oriflammi and their Centrist policies as it could change the very nature of 
Spiri Society. As such, they ally themselves very closely with the 
Federalists, and quietly enjoy the actions of those among Helios.

I don\'t think there\'s any reason to even do a gender based -1 on STR. 
OK, on average, a human female of today tends to be a little less strong
than a human male, but that\'s just ON AVERAGE. <G>

True, not in T4, but there was in TNE. <G>  I think charisma or presence

That depends on the society. <G>  There certainly *could* be societies
where gender makes a difference in social standing.  Hopefully, not the
Federation or Imperial society.

NO! Not in humans!

Well...maybe. <g>  Women *are*, on average, a little better at fine
moter skills..threading a needle foex <g>.., and, on average, are a
little more flexible.  Men and women match up pretty well in agility
(gross motor skills) and balance.

Frankly, I suspect it\'s just better to not make *any* gender adjustments
and let the randomness take care of it.

Darryl,

I like both systems.  I think both have their place.  I always ask myself 
how much work is needed. If I didn\'t plan on the character\'s being around 
the station for too long, but I need some description, I\'d use a QSDS 
type system.  If the station was the character\'s base, the adventure 
included the station, or I had a string of adventures that frequently 
included the station, I\'d use a NAH system if it was available.

That takes us back to your first question--does anybody have a use for 
it.

I know that I would print it out and keep it for when I needed it.

My policy is:  If you build it, they will come.

Looking forward to seeing it,

Kenneth.

Your point is well taken, but as someone else said recently, we have to 
keep in mind that the bad guys have the same advantages as the PCs do 
with regards to the task system.

Yup.  The tricky part is making the challenge be at the right level.  I\'m

MegaTraveller. It should be noted that these dates are in the Terran dating
system; with some exceptions, the IMPERIAL dates don\'t change. For instance,
the Rebellion starts in Year 1116 on both timelines; the Terran DATE
corresponding to that year is what changes. When you see a "+" in the
difference column, that means the T4 date is EARLIER than the MT date; when
you see a "-", it means the T4 date occurs AFTER the date given in MT.

I was quite surprised at the variation in some of these dates. Obviously, we
don\'t know why this variation exists. Purely speculative, but here are some
ideas why;

1.) Legal reasons. This doesn\'t seem likely, since Marc supposedly owns the
rights to all the Traveller stuff. (I certainly wouldn\'t license anyone to
produce products for my game unless I retained rights to use it.)

2.) Lack of reference material; in other words, the folks at IG don\'t own a
copy of the Imperial Encyclopedia. Is this likely?

3.) A desire to assert control over the Traveller universe and say "this is
my game; 
it will be made according to MY vision of how and when things occured."

Nice post, Declan!

I\'m busy collecting data from all of you and my own personal insights 
trying to come up with the perfect fix to the T4 system.

Like you, I like the MT system.  This is what I used as my house system 
before T4 came out (MT task system--my take on TNE detailed rules).

I am very attracted to the grace and ease afforded to the T4 system.  If 
we can down play the role of the attributes, with them still having a 
measurable impact on the throw, and the probabilities come out looking 
good, then I know we will have a superior system.

I\'ve got to find a solution somewhat fast, my next game is Sunday after 
next.

Thanks again for the thoughtful post,

Kenneth.

PS  Hmmm.  Declan.  I like the name--sounds like a vilani noble.  Lord 
Declan.  I\'m going to have to put that in my campaign.

Hmmm.  You\'re right.  I hadn\'t gotten that far with it yet.  I wasn\'t 
even considering spec. success or spec. failure, and I didn\'t plan to 
until I got the ground work for a system that I liked.  You know, one 
thing at a time.

Maybe we can play around with what constitutes spec. success and spec. 
failure.  I\'ve always been inclined to thinkthat they both should have an 
equal probability, which is definitely not the case in T4.

Well, back to the work shop.

First of all, thanks Mark for sharing this with us.  Hee hee, you have a
knack for giving us just enough to peak interest, and at the perfect time,
too. :)

This info really rebuilt my interest in T4.  Since I am running a Milieu 0
eMail campaign, this info is really tantalizing to me.  Now for some comments

Suggestions:
         b. Military Pressures - With the return of men to space, and the
re-beginning of interstellar trade, the return of piracy would eventually
occur as well.  In addition, many small Leagues and Confederations would
form, not all friendly.  Out of fear of pirace and fear of hostile take
over, many world, IMO, would have been eager to join the Federation.

>    3. Establishment of the Third Imperium

Suggestions:
         a. Racial Pressures - The Sylean Federation, as I understand it, is
made up of both Solomani and Vilani.  As the Federation grew, the people
(both S & V) would come to learn that members of their Empire were still out
there.  For different reasons, both races would be interested in the
reestablishment of their Empires.  I could see this as providing some
intense presure on the Grand Senate of the Federation.
         b. Political Pressure - The pressure of governing many worlds is
difficult when under the control of body like the Senate.  Whne a situation
arises, you have to get the word back to the Senate, then the discussions
start, finally a decision is reached, and the message is transported back to
the originating party.  For simple issues, this is a moot point, but for
issues that can be viewed in a variety of ways, this problem is magnified.
Also, with the Racial Problems mentioned above, the discussions may be even
longer.  Under a central leader, there is little or no discussion, only
advisement.
         c. Cleon\'s Ambition - Very little has been said thus far in our
discussions on the list as to whether Cleon is acting for the benefit of
humanity, or on his own selfish ambitions.  In either case, his goals and
desires were probably a very big part of the establishing of the Imperium.

This has great potential.  I\'m working on Official To Hit Tables for 1D6 to
6D6, and I\'m interested in using that along with the aptitude idea to create
a somewhat advanced task system.  A while back, when we were talking about
the skills themselves, some folks were talking about the problem with
general skills and the lack of specifics.  This is the place for aptitudes!!
A specific number could be used to make the system useable directly, but the
idea would be to use the formula Eris posted above as a base and set the
aptitude for the specific division of the generality.

For example, let\'s just say that the base number is 2.  Someone taking a
skill in Medical, for example, would get a level of 2 in Medical:Surgery,
but only a 1 in Medical:Pharmacology, and a 1 in Medical:General, and a 0 in
Medical:Nursing.  (If the numbers are off, forgive me, I\'m not a doctor. :)
Then with each additional skill level taken in Medical, the player could
apply it to any of the specific divisions.

I will work on this and see what I come up with.  If anyone has ideas about
the specifics for any of the skills on the list, please send \'em my way. :)

Well, I know how against hand waving everyone is, but since Jump Dirve
itself is hand waving, you could easily avoid this problem by saying that
Jump covers a minimum of 1 Parsec.

Also, while I agree that the potential of a Jump in 20% of the time creates
trouble for trade and information in the canon universe, I think this idea
has merit for a non-canon universe.

This is an interesting idea, that Vilani elements opposed the establishment
of the Imperium. Another interesting subject to examine; what role did
knowledge recovered or left over from the First and Second Imperiums play in
the decisions on where to explore?

If possible, the idea of an extended Vilani lifespan should be maintained,

I\'m looking forward to this book.

You\'ve hit the nail on the head.  Looking at the target number is an 
easier way than comparing all the percentages.  We can run a percentage 
table to check our work later.

I\'ll tell you, Paul, you can referee me anytime.  And believe me, I 
don\'t say that lightly.  I\'m always the ref around here (in my gaming 
group) because none of them GMs to the level that I expect.

I figure that the top hierarchy of the Vilani Empire was removed by the Rule of 
Man.  You would have lots of "district managers" still around at the planetary 
level, though, and they would continue running things at the planetary lvel 
even after the Rule of Man folded (or, they would continue acting as the 
bureaucracy/power brokers for the Terran ruling class on the occupied worlds).  
The Vilani ultraconservatism in regards to social/political change would make 
it very hard for one of these "district managers" to claim to be the successor 
chief of one of the bureaux, or of the Vilani Empire, so the region would 
likely be filled with lots of small polities and alliances; very balkanized on 
a stellar scale.

I agree whole-heartedly, Liam.  There is a definite problem with the T4 
task system.  I can\'t imagine what IG was thinking, or even if they 
worked out the probs themselves when they publised the book.  What was 
this stuff about "backed by 20 years of game design experience" anyway.

I love Traveller, but I also have more problems with Traveller game 
mechanics than I do with any other game.  

Anyway, I think that there are many people out there that that feel the 
way we do.  The silent majority on this list, and the many others that 
aren\'t on this list, but at home discovering for themselves through game 
play that there are definite problems with the T4 task system.

Just for the record, to let you know where I stand on the "heroic" PCs, 
when I roll up a character with a player, I say Str, and he rolls two 
dice.  That one result is the character\'s starting Str.  Then I say Dex, 
and the player rolls his two dice.  The player can attempt to improve his 
abilities by rolling on the appropriate chart when he earns a skill (at 
the expense of gaining a skill, of course).

We\'ve got a character in our game now with a Str of 2.  The player didn\'t 
improve it through character creation.  Did the player bitch--his only 
character with a Str of 2?  No.  We role played it into the situation.

The character is now quite cool.  He\'s the ship\'s doctor, and he\'s got 
this incurable disease that eats away his muscle tissue.  He uses a 
specially built grav chair when he\'s off ship with the others.  There\'s a 
special compartment built into the back of the chair, just above the 
grav plates, where he can store equipment.  The chair has a handy 
computer with an uplink to the ship, and there is a plug for his laser 
pistol--so the weapon can run right off the chair\'s power plant.

This guy has turned out so much more fun to play than if he would have 
had a 15 Str.  The player is doing a great job with him.

And because he is beating the odds by succeeding not only in the 
obsticals that I\'m throwing at the group, but by over coming his Str 
handicap as well, this, to me, makes him that much more heroic.

know I am.  Therefore, this will be a very important item in the book.

>The First Wave

practices that the Imperium does not condone.

Enough to centre a campaign on each of these planets\\places would be good.

- - more, detailed and bigger (attached poster maps?)

- - this shoudl be important too.  I think the whole Core sector should be
detailed enough.  If Mileu 0 is going to be marketed as the \'essential
background\' for T4, then we shouldn\'t have to buy ANOTHER book, just to play
a campaign using this one.  That\'d make 3 books to beging playing the game.
M0 shouldn\'t have too much, in the way of the WHOLE 3I, but enough to
explore and play in the \'official T4\' core sector without buying another
book would be a good idea.

>	1. Diplomatic Interactions

Sounds good.  Perhaps a new career for someone in the Imperial bureauacracy?

Sounds like M0 is going to be good....

Unless Grandfather et al genetically engineered all of the groups to follow a 
general predetermined evolutionary path.  Since the Ancients could not predict 
or compensate for the natural forces of evolution, the races still show 
surprising differences, but overall are more similar than different.

Or at least that\'s my guess

In MegaTraveller and the Starship Operator\'s Guide, Pilot skill can 
improve the travel time between a planet and a jump point. I\'ve always
allowed the Navigation/Astrogation skill to do the same with the time in
Jump. Also, keep in mind that the time in Jumpspace is computed using
the formula: 124 hours +(1D6 x 2). So it is possible for "canon" to
allow the situation stated above without twisting its barrel into a
pretzel.

The implication that an omnipotent force protects casuality rankles my hard
science fiction neck hairs.  (Of course I find that perfectly acceptable in
a fantasy game) I\'ve heard some pretty darn good ideas on what could happen,
and one idea that I have heard from a Russian Doctor of Cosmology at
Stanford U. made imperfect sense to me and was absolutely perfect for role
playing games.  From him and another science fiction source it works like this:

(Keep in mind I am leaving out the effects of massive spinning objects and
associated frame dragging and relatavistic acceleration on this example, as
well as any other relativity weirdness - more on that later).

1.  Picture the big bang as a rock dropped into the middle of a large smooth
surfaced pond which will be known universe.  Now imagine time as the series
of expanding waves travelling outward from the center of the splash made
from the dropped rock.  The closer the wave to the center, the closer to the
beginning of time.  The further out from the center, the farther into the
future.  

2.  Whenever you are on a wave, you are experiencing it\'s \'present\'.
Whether you are on a wave or not it will continue expanding outward at a
constant rate, so if you leave a wave and return, you can only return to
that wave at the point in time it has moved to, and thus will find that an
equivelant interval has passed.  (If you wanted to go to the point in time
just after you left you would find yourself on another wave.)  You can go to
a specific point in time and catch the wave that is there or you can find
specific waves at whenever point in time they have expanded to.  These waves
are expanding at a constant rate and do not catch up to each other, so a
change on one will not affect the ones that are ahead of it or behind it.
For this particular \'model\' I am assuming that the waves are all identical
(for the most part) and that each experiences nearly the exact same events
as they expand outward into the future, at their appropriate time, UNLESS
some outside influence changes the course of events on a given wave in some
dramatic way.  (I presume that the events of each wave are somewhat
different on some random level naturally, so each wave might not only be a
different moment of time, but have some subtle or grotesque variation of the
events that occur in universe since the beginning moments of that waves
existance.  So it would be possible to speculate on the possibility of a
given wave being rather unique in discovering time travel)

On one of these waves is a time traveller.  He made his time machine
discovery and decides to travel into the past.  Let\'s call his wave Original
wave.  

We will assume the following about his time travelling machine, for the sake
of simplicity:

1. It is able to uniquely identify any wave it has visited.
2. It is also able to return to any wave that has been uniquely identified.
3. It can also travel freely backwards or forward across the waves, as many
as you want, (with femtosecond being at least one wave) until you get far
enough in the direction you are going until you reach the moment in time in
the past or the future that was your destination.  He need only go to the
physical location he wants to be when he arrives in the past or future and
select a moment in time (down to the  quadrillionth of a second) and he will
appear there.  His time travelling machine has to be either set to take him
back to a specific date (which counts the number of waves it needs to hop to
get to a point that is relatively that far into the past or future) or any
uniquely identified wave.  

The traveller decides to conduct some experiments.  He leaves his wave of
Origin and goes back in time.  Note that his Origin wave is still expanding
forward into the future once he leaves. As he travels in time, he can choose
to travel toward the center of the expanding circles of waves and visit the
past, or if he travels outward, past the expanding circles of waves
(including his Origin wave) he can visit the future.  

Experiment One:  Travels five years to past to secretly observe himself for
two minutes.  He knows that he does not recall ever seeing someone that
looked like himself back when he was in college, so he is reasonably sure
that he successful in remaining hidden or no other observing traveller from
some other future wave had visited his past.

Implementation:  He drives to his old University and positions himself in a
good vantage point to observe himself.  He had calculated approximately what
time from old schedules and calendars (since the Big Bang) as to when he had
been in a class room that he could view himself from a window. The current
date and time at his wave of Origin, is 08:00:00 AM 15 January 5490AD.  He
sets his destination timer to 08:00:00 AM 15 January 5485AD.  His master
clock shows down to the femto second the moment of arrival and captures the
unique signature of that wave that was passing by that exact moment of time
and labels it 000001.  He is now experiencing the \'present\' of that unique
wave.  

Effect:  He timed things pretty well, and can see himself through a window
listening to a boring lecture.  After a moment or two he looks at the clock
on his time machine and notices that that the current local waves time is
08:05:16 AM 15 January 5485AD.  He has been "riding" wave 000001 for a mere
two minutes.  The current time back at his Origin wave is on his control
console as well and it too shows two minutes have elapsed.  He uses the
"RETURN TO ORIGIN" button on his time machine to take him back to his Origin
wave and as he successfully arrives and verifies that his laboratory clock
confirms that two minutes had elapsed. He had a camcorder recording the spot
he was in and played it.  The two minutes he was gone, there was no one
there, so he concludes that when he leaves, as far as his Orgin wave is
concerned, he is just no longer there.  He knows that if he had tried to
return to his Origin wave at any other time but the exact elapsed time he
was gone from it, that he would have simply ended up on a different wave. 

Experiment Two:  Travel five years to past to meet himself.  He definitely
does not recall ever seeing someone barge into his class claiming to be from
another time so he is curious to see if his ideas on what will happen are
correct.

Implementation:  Some thirty minutes from when he first travelled five years
back, he set out to travel back again to that same exact date he had gone to
before, 08:00:00 AM 15 January 5485AD.  

Effect:  He travels back to the past to that exact time, his time machine
calculating to the exact femto second how far across the expanding waves it
needs to go to arrive the same point in time as before.  Even though he
travelled to the same femtosecond he had gone to before the wave is a
different, new one.  

As he expected, he sees himself, but he knows it is a self from an earlier
wave that had just gotten to this point in time of trying experiment one.
He waits until his other self leaves and then walks into the class room and
shocks the teachers, students, and his younger self completely.  He
introduces himself and explains how he got there, and then leaves.  He was
there fifteen minutes and arrives at wave Origin having been gone fifteen
minutes.  He realizes that the change he wrought on that wave will only
affect that wave.   Since that wave will _never_ catch up to his Origin
wave, it doesn\'t affect him in a paradoxical matter.

Experiment Three:  Travel to the future.

Implementation:  He travels to the future ten years and while visiting, will
research history as it has manifested, travel back to his wave, use the
information, and go back to the future to see how it ended up.

Effect:  Assuming that waves tend to be similar (unless you feel that
grotesque random variations exist ala Sliders) he could trust that his
Origin wave will experience the same events as a future wave he visits.
He arrives and does a little research.  Apparently he has been missing for
ten years.  His attorneys have been investing his interests in various
stocks and haven\'t done too badly, but he makes a note or two so that when
he goes back, he can advise them.  He travels back to his Origin wave,
instructs his attorneys and goes back to the identical wave he visited in
the future before.  Nothing has changed.  He smacks himself on the forehead
for forgetting that his Origin wave will take a while (ten years actually)
to catch up to this point in time, but in the meantime this wave will be ten
years further out...

LOLOLOL!  I just love to see things like this on a post.  It makes them 
so much more enjoyable to read.  

Sometimes, like with this one, I\'ll print it out and pass it out at my 
next game session.  The players love it!

Sometimes, like the one Paul Walker wrote about the EC and using one, 
unified language, I start one of those fax things where you fax all of 
your friends.  Then they fax theirs.  Then, pretty soon, its on 
everybody\'s fax in the whole city.

Bravo!

Kenneth.

Okay, let\'s say we do.  How would you arrive at the target numbers?  I\'d 
be interested in any idea you come up for this.

This kind of leads me into something that I thought of when Kenneth was 
emphasizing the need to go about this whole "search" correctly.

Here are some thoughts on over-all questions that we might want to answer 
before we get down to the nitty-gritty:

1)  How complex do we want this to be?
	A) How many tables should be involved?
	B) What sort of mathematical operations should be required?

2)  What sort of dice do we want to use?
	A) Stick with D6\'s only?
	B) Use 1/2 Dice?
	C) Use D4\'s, D8\'s, D10\'s, D12\'s, and/or D20\'s?

3)  What should be the "base" for the roll?
	A) Characteristics
	B) Some arbitrary number (i.e., 8+)
	C) Skill Levels (or some multiple thereof)
	D) Something else?

4)  What should the basic modifiers to the target number be?
	A) Characteristics
	B) Skill Levels
	C) Something else?

5)  What sort of probability progression do we want from target number to 
target number?

6)  What sort of probability progression do we want from difficulty level 
to difficulty level?


Answers to the above, as well as additional questions, would be 
appreciated from anyone who wants to participate.

Hmmm. Your example got me to thinking. Obviously, an attribute is only
helpful if it is at least average. And it can be a lot *less* than
helpful if it is below average (picture the bomb-disposal expert with a
dex of 1 and a skill of 6. He knows all there is to know about bombs,
but doesn\'t dare actually work on them).

Also, it\'s ridiculous for attribute to count for *more* than skill. 

So, here are my proposals.

1. Attribute modifiers to skill are based upon the *difference* between
the attribute and 7. An attribute of 9 gives a bonus of 2, but an
attribute of 5 gives a *penalty* of 2.

2. The bonus is limited to the skill level (or to 1 if the skill is
level 0). I supposed penalties can be limited likewise. 

I think #1 will work a *lot* better than the "halve the attribute"
idea, and it\'ll make players make more realistic choices of skills.

#2 might work ok also, but I\'m not as sure. And I don\'t think I want to
know what happens if you combine them.

\'Twould be nice to see a bit more about the First and Second Imperiums

I\'d say that it would be pretty important to at least include more info

I have started to run a milieu 0 game have been doing the rolls as d6

is the difficultly level.  As such some of the players have yet to
notice that I do this and there has been some confusion when the players
dice say the task has worked but are informed that it failed.  Fun for
me and they have a limited knowledge if a task is working or not.

I know that is not a solution that people are looking for but it works
for me and adds some confusion for the players now that they don\'t know
the whole story with the dice rolls.

I will tell what is happening in the game next post.

Excellent idea.  I\'m not sure if it\'s going to work, or be easier to
handle, but I *really* like this.

We\'re going to end up with lower target numbers this way, an average of 2d6
lower.  We\'d need to boost the number back up, maybe by increasing the
skill factor somehow.

Hmmm, nothing about Solomani pressures?  I would think they would be

>Structure of Organizations
>1. Structure of the Sylean Federation

This interests me extremely!  In my PBeM, I have characters that retired
from a variety of organizations.  A few examples...

     Federation Information Bureau - similar to FBI, internal government affairs
     Sylean Special Intelligence - Similar to CIA, external affairs
     Naval Intelligence - Important part of navy, collect military data on
                                 foreign worlds.

>2. Structure of the Third Imperium

So far, the way I am planning to deal with this is that the authority
structure switched to a single individual and the Senate became an advisory
board.  Of course, the addition of the Calandar Bureau and a few other
agencies and the transition in name of everything else.  Also, as I
mentioned before, the Diplomatic Corps is a sub agency under the Scouts
(although they are nearly autonomous).

<<<...snippage...>>>
>1. Personalities
>		a. Cleon (Emperor)
>		b. Third Undersecretary of Interstellar Affairs (he gives assignments to
adventurers)
>		c. Professor Aldin Zhunastu (he discovered Fusion Plus in the Zhunastu Labs)

        Who is Frank Repzinski XVII??????

I would add another couple of people here, but they are based on some of the
agencies I listed above.

          e. Charles MacMillian.  Head Ambassador, and good friend of Cleon.
Charged with the most delicate negotions.

          f. Director of Naval Intelligence - This fellow is indespensible
to Cleon in his expansion.

          g. Director Davis - Director of the Diplomatic Corps.

          h. Directors of Intel agencies - Very important people.

As I said, all of these people are from my campaign and are VIP\'s there,
that doesn\'t mean they WILL be in Marc\'s Year 0, but I still would like to
see them in the book. :)

Much of what is here seems to indicate that the reason the Core sector map
is not fleshed out more is either because of

   1. The map is of the Early or Mid Sylean Federation, and not Year 0, or
   2. The Federation was involved in MAJOR exploration and expansion toward
Vland to either win Vilani support or crush it.

Good, this is much easier.  The only thing is, we need to keep in mind that
we can use either the 2,2.5,3,3.5,4 D system, or the 2,3,4,5,6 D system.  I
am trying to get Excell tables up for both probabilities.  If anyone wants
them when I have them done, I will send them out or post them to my web page.

Well, hee hee, actually, my PBeM is under observation cause I\'m a fairly new
ref.  I am getting pointers and advice on how to be better and better.  As a
matter of fact, this PBeM is my second official game.  There is some stuff
on my web page about it.  Hit the main page, then go to the Traveller page,
then the PBeM.  If you have other questions, send the off list and I\'ll tell
you more. :)

>Here are some thoughts on over-all questions that we might want to answer

Good Idea, let\'s settle on some basics before we get too involved

>1)  How complex do we want this to be?
>	A) How many tables should be involved?
>	B) What sort of mathematical operations should be required?

Well, originally, I thought we should go for the quick basic system, but
then, I remembered the discussion we had about SSDS, QSDS, and NAH (was FFS)
and how we needed to start with the detail and work to the simple to keep it
consistent.  I lean toward the detail, but I would settle for a basic system. :)

By detail, I mean whatever is necessary, and by basic, I mean one simple
calculation to get a to hit number and roll the dice.

>2)  What sort of dice do we want to use?
>	A) Stick with D6\'s only?
>	B) Use 1/2 Dice?
>	C) Use D4\'s, D8\'s, D10\'s, D12\'s, and/or D20\'s?

Personally, I prefer d6\'s only in order to stick with past Traveller stuff
(TNE excluded).  I don\'t mind the 1/2D, but it is not my favorite.  Also,
D10\'s don\'t bother me at all, but I think for the basic system at least, we
need to stick with D6\'s

>3)  What should be the "base" for the roll?
>	A) Characteristics
>	B) Some arbitrary number (i.e., 8+)
>	C) Skill Levels (or some multiple thereof)
>	D) Something else?

I think the skill should be the base, and the modifiers to the skill level
(and possibly the dice) would be what made the difference between complex
and simple systems.

>4)  What should the basic modifiers to the target number be?
>	A) Characteristics
>	B) Skill Levels
>	C) Something else?

Base modifier should be the Characteristic.

>5)  What sort of probability progression do we want from target number to 
>target number?

Hmmm,  Gotta admit, I\'m not too sure what you mean by this one. :)

>6)  What sort of probability progression do we want from difficulty level 
>to difficulty level?

Again, you seem to have stumped me. :)

This is an interesting idea.  So let me try an example to see if I follow
your meaning...

Nakita (hee hee) has a skill level of 2 in Biology and a 9 for EDU.  Her \'to
hit\' number would then be 9+2+2??? or would it just be 2+2? or what?  I
think I\'m confused. :)

>2. The bonus is limited to the skill level (or to 1 if the skill is
>level 0). I supposed penalties can be limited likewise. 

Now this I do understand.  In the example above, if Nakita (hee hee) had a
skill level of 1, the bonus would only be limited to 1 not 2 which is the
difference, right?

Consider two other SF games - GW\'s Warhammer 40k/Epic Space Marine, and Iron
Crown Ent.\'s Silent Death game.  Both have species that take the
biotechnical route - the Tyranids (GW) and the Nightbrood (ICE). Weird stuff
that, in each case (and I\'m DEFINITELY not a GW fanatic) is consistent and
viable and provides a real challenge to the merely human species in the game...

     get to use our internet link once in a while so I have to be 
     selective! So, many thanks to John, John, Hans, Jamie, & Earl for their 
outstanding comments...hope I haven\'t missed anybody! 
     
Here goes: 
1. Scouts probably made contact with the Zhos before Traders did, unless the 
IISS spent its resources exclusively in recontacting former Rule of Man/First 
Imperium worlds. 
2. I recall from somewhere that the Imperium had settlements in Foreven sector 
before the First Frontier War, when the Zhodani pushed the frontier back to the 
Spinward Marches. 
3. Good point about the psionic faction within the Imperium pushing for contact 
with the Zhos. My guess is that they would have used sneaky, covert, sly, wicked
mind manipulation tricks to do this - a great adventure seed! 
4. The model I have used for information flow between the Imperium and the 
Zhodani is based on the interchange between the ancient Roman and Chinese 
empires. Each knew of the other\'s existence, and roughly the direction, because 
of rumours that flowed with the exchange of traders, bandits, etc. along the 
Silk Road. Each trader only covered a few dozens to a few hundreds of 
kilometres, but silk/spices still flowed towards Rome and gold/silver/gems still
flowed towards China and India. Stories and rumours filtered along with trade. 
- - an interesting aside: the existence of Hadrian\'s Wall (built c.2nd century) 
and strong evidence that the Romans started building a wall around the *entire* 
empire (!), roughly a century after the Great Wall of China was completed, has 
led historians to speculate that the idea for the Roman wall may have come from 
stories of a huge wall in the far off Chinese empire. 
- - it is known that Rome traded directly with India, and that Buddhist monks and 
traders regularly travelled between India and China. Eastern Roman empire 
merchants apparently made it as far as Java (modern day Indonesia!)
- - a researcher recently found, in the Chinese government archives from the time,
a letter from the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius to the Emperor of China. This is
the strongest evidence that both empires were aware of each other\'s existence. 
<Back to Traveller-sorry guys!>
Therefore I think that *some* indirect, intermittent contact between Imperium 
and Zhodani during the Long Night is quite possible. Information (mostly in the 
form of rumours) still flows across distance, even though its accuracy & 
therefore value degrades with the number of interchanges! 
5. I concede that there is a vanishingly small probability of high-tech Zhodani 
gear being captured/bought by Vargr and then used against the Vilani. 
6. I recall (Regency Sourcebook?) that the Zhodani had kept the Darrians under 
observation during the Long Night without revealing their presence. 
- - I am most dissatisfied with this part of the \'canon\'; I think that the Zhos 
and pre-Maghiz Darrians were so close to each other (ie 1 sector at most between
their borders) that it is a bit ridiculous to think that TL14 and a TL16 
starfaring civilizations would just *miss* each other for a few *centuries*!
7. The many human races, whether descended from *Homo Erectus*, *Homo Habilis* 
or early *Homo Sapiens* would still be quite close genetically even after 200k 
years. The question is whether they would have drifted far enough to cease being
*interfertile* and able to produce *fertile offspring* (the definition of a 
species!). Even closely related species such as horses and donkeys can produce 
offspring, even if it is only infertile mules! Also, look at the variety in 
size, appearance, etc. among species of dogs/cats/cattle after only a few 
thousands of years of selective breeding. I therefore think it is OK to say that
humans might remain interfertile even after 200,000 years, but since I\'m not a 
geneticist I\'m open to argument here. 
- - this raises an interesting point: are there *non-intelligent* human races out 
there in Known Space? Is it possible that a planet of *homo sapiens* could have 
drifted far enough that they would become essentially animal in intelligence, ie
just another primate? 
- - for a nice look at a number of hominid races (mostly separate *species* ie 
mutually infertile!) after a few *millions* of years of parallel evolution, see 
Larry Niven\'s *Ringworld* and *Ringworld Engineers*. 

Sorry about the length of this one. I will try to behave myself in future.

You missed my point, Harold.  I didn\'t say that I have conclusive proof that 
God doesn\'t exist, I said there is no conclusive proof that God does.  I 
also said that not being able to disprove something does not make it a fact. 
 If I say that I believe that I am directly descended from the Pharaohs (or 
whatever) and thus the Divine Inheritor of the Earth (stop laughing!), 
according to your logic, my claim would be acceptable because there is no 
conclusive proof against it!  Just believing something doesn\'t make it 
reality (except in Disney movies...).  Only conclusive proof can make a 
fact.  Therefore, the existence of God is not a fact because there is no 
conclusive proof supporting the claim.  Lack of conclusive proof is OK for 
opinions though, so you can be of the *opinion* that God exists.  (Claiming 
opinion to be fact based on lack of disproof is what I\'m really opposed to.)

True.  But most things in Traveller have some sort of base that makes sense.  For 
instance, gauss rifles fire rounds at a pace of 1500 m/sec because they have a 
magnetic, frictionless barrel.  Reactionless thruster plates can work through the hull 
of a ship because they work on an atomic level--atoms push against each other not unlike 
two positive ends on two magnets.  

This one-week-in-jump-no-matter-what system has never been justified like most elements 
in Traveller other than to say, basically, "We don\'t understand it, but we know it 
works.  So we use it."  That, to me, doesn\'t make sense.

So, Trent, what I\'m looking for here is an argument for the use of the o-w-i-j-n-m-w 
system without saying, "It is what Traveller was built on."  I\'m questioning that 
assumption.  I want someone to make me a believer by detailing what they think the 
science is behind it.

Actually, Trent, I really like the way Traveller handles interstellar communication.  I 
like that, out on the fringe, starship Captains have the power of the Emperor, can make 
policy, and cannot rely on \'phoneing home\' for instructions.  I like the trade and 
economics system used in the game--it generates a lot of work for the tramp freighters 
that our characters usually run.  This makes for great adventure.

Given that, I don\'t think that making "faster" ships will have that big of an impact on 
the Traveller universe as we know it.  Sure, communication to Capital/Core will be a 
little quicker, but we are still limited by the speed of transportion for communication. 
 

Let me show you this:  X-boats average jump-4.  It is somewhere around 176 parsecs from 
Regina, in the Spinward Marches, to Capital in the Core sector.  Simple math says that 
an X-boat could make the jump in 44 weeks.  The kicker here is:  I\'m not saying that a 
jump-4 ship could make the jump ANY faster.  Under my system, it would take the same 
amount of time.  But, when the X-boat made a jump of, say, 2 parsecs, the ship could do 
it in 3-4 days (1/2 the time).

We\'ve got the jump-6 barrier (which I have no problem with:  we had the sound barrier, 
Traveller broke the speed of light barrier shooting Einstein\'s theory all to hell, and 
Star Trek, of all things, has the Warp 10 barrier.), and the distances that we are 
dealing with in the Imperium are so great, that I know having "faster" ships will not 
greatly impact on the communication/economic situation basic to Traveller.

\'Fraid not, Trent.  My system would not significantly change the community structure 
of Traveller.  See my comments above.

Again, read my comments above.  Communication will basically stay the way it is.  What 
will change is the communications between local star systems, and that, too, will still 
be measured in days.

Look at this:
Let\'s guestimate about civilian jump drives.  What would you guess is the percentage of 
jump-1 plants on civilian ship in the entire Imperium?  Jump-2s?  The other jump 
numbers?

Here\'s my guess.
Jump-1:  40%
Jump-2:  30%
Jump-3:  20%
Jump-4+: 10%

If you agree with my guestimate, then 70% of the time it will take either 7 (for jump-1) 
or 3.5 (for jump-2) to make a jump between two neighboring star systems (1 parsec).

Trent, we are not talking about warp speed and sub-space communications here.  We are 
talking about that unheard of, expensive, fuel consuming, civilian jump-4 ship having a 
little time advantage over vessels with smaller j-drives.  With all the fuel and 
added expense associated with the larger j-drives, this time savings begins to 
make sense.  

I am eagerly awaiting your response.  (BTW, you write a great post!)

I didn\'t say in my last reply to your post that I really like your formula.  This is 
exactly the system I am proposing.  

I said a ship with jump-5 capability could make a 1 parsec jump in 20% of the time it 
would take a jump-1 ship to do it.  7 days x 20% = 1.4 days.  Under your formula above, 
you get the exact same result.

What I meant in my last reply about wanting to get away from the math was your reference 
to the TNE light second and g hour approach to normal space.  I like using the travel 
formula.

I use your (the TNE) approach when a ship has a fuel burning Heplar drive.  Thruster 
plates run only on electricity, and the Travel Formula is good enough for me.

Thanks, again.

Eris, check out my comments to Trent Smith in Re: (To Trent Smith) Hop, Skip, and Jump. 
 If you think it through, my system does not interfere with the slow 
communication/transportation feel of Traveller.  I really, really, really, like that 
feel as well, and it is not my intention to disrupt that.

I like the formula that you posted, but it seems still a little too slow.  I still don\'t 
see that much of a time savings for the more advanced jump drives.

I am glad, though, that we think alike on this matter.

- -- 

Let me expand on my version of the idea a little then.  First a
credit, the origin of this idea comes from my study of the
Aftermath! system.

Possible Aptitudes  (2d6)/2,dn or (2d3)-1

Aggressiveness  - modifies combat type skills
Charsima        - modifies interpersonal/social skills
Esthetic        - modifies artistic skills
Linguistic      - modifies communication/language skills
Mechanical      - modifies technical/mechanical skills
Natural         - modifies biological/wilderness/agurian skills
Scientific      - modifies science/theory skills

foex:

Skill       Attribute +  Aptitude * Skill     Target
- ----
Melee CBT   STR  (4)  +  AGG (5)  *   2         14

    [Character isn\'t Strong, but she is *very* aggressive and can make a
    lot of use out of training!]

Melee CBT   STR  (10) +  AGG (1)  *   3         13

    [This Character is very Strong, but he\'s a pussy cat and even
    though he has a lot of training he still isn\'t a super warrior.]

I haven\'t even *thought* about the numbers much yet.  I just like
the idea of having a psychological component.  We probably all know
people with "green thumbs" (high Natural), people that can look at
something mechanical and it stops working (low Mechanical) or starts
working (high Mechanical), and of course the "natural salesman,
leader, cassinova" (high Charsima)

At this point, I\'m still thinking about it.  If anyone has any ideas
let me know.

"Not So!," says Kenneth.  It is very difficult to calculate another ship\'s jump vector 
simply by watching it.  All those variables concerning the rotation of 
planets...satellites, rotating themselves, spinning around destination planets...both of 
these spinning around the primary star...the system, itself, moving in relation to the 
original jump point, tends to make the jump calculations difficult to match.

Of course, this is possible if you have good sensor data, but I bet if you tell your 
navigator to match a vector just from sensor data of another ship jumping out, he\'d 
probably pull his hair out.  To quote a familiar movie, "Hyperspace isn\'t like dusting 
crops, boy.  One mis-calculation and you\'d fly too close to a star or super nova, and 
that would end your trip real soon.  Wouldn\'t it?" 

In the games that I was referring to (where the ship was already waiting for them), the 
chasing ship knew that the PC\'s ship was only jump-1.  Through process of elimation, and 
role playing, the chasing ship looked at the available systems and guessed which ones 
the PCs were jumping to.  The chasing ship\'s more advanced drives allowed them to get 
there before the PCs arrived.

I can\'t agree, here, either, Leonard.  It still takes the same amount of fuel to charge 
the zuchai crystals and the jump grid (to rip the hole in normal space through to jump 
space)--no matter how long a jump you plan to do.  Fuel consumption becomes an issue.  
Those tanks can only hold so much.  If you micro-jump and plan to jump outsystem as 
well, you\'d better have a place to fill up first.  

This is one reason for manuever drives.  The other is that micro-jumps are tricky 
business.  There is too much room for error and too much of a chance that you will over 
shoot your target point.

Let me give you an analogy:  Take out your stop watch.  Start the watch and stop it at 
exactly one minute (1:00:00).  This is a fairly easy operation because you have time to 
watch the seconds count off, and you are prepared to stop it at the right moment.

I liken this to a parsec or better jump.  The ship\'s nav system can handle this fairly 
easily.

Now, let\'s look at the micro-jump.  Using your stop watch, start it and stop it in one 
one-hundredth of a second (00:00:01).  Very hard to do, isn\'t it.  You might be able to 
do it in, say, 24 hundredths of a second, but this would put you way off course, 
wouldn\'t it.  No.  One one-hundredth of a second is what is needed, and ship\'s nav 
systems just can\'t make the calc.  This does not mean it is impossible--it just means 
that it is not practicle and very, very dangerous.  

Given this--a less than 1% chance of living and a more than 99% chance of dying--I\'d 
sure as heck use my m-drive.

Again, Leonard, you are not thinking this through.  Let\'s go ahead and say that someone 
with a better j-drive than yours watched you jump out, pulled a rabbit out of his butt, 
and guessed which system you jumped to.  This does not mean that both ships came out in 
the same part of the system.  It takes days to travel across most systems, and there is 
some guess work on the part of the chasing ship as to where the target ship will arrive. 
 Will it be the main world, the gas giant, or right outside the asteroid belt?  So the 
chasing ship gets there first.  This does not mean, by any stretch, that the chasing 
ship automatically catches the target ship.


I look forward to your reply.

    'body' => '     Okay, I\'m working from extremely vague memories based on skim-reading 
the DGP "Starship Operator\'s Manual" several years ago, but in that book
didn\'t they state that the various jump-levels (J-1 thru J-6) were actually
(and here I\'m exposing my lack of ability to express myself clearly on
scientific (or even pseudo-scientific) matters) progressively higher 
"dimensions" or foldings of space which didn\'t really connect with one
another, but which require progressively harder computations and greater
energy expenditure to be able to reach?  That is, the difference between a 
J-6 capable engine and a J-1 capable engine is that the former can reach 
that "higher dimension" which allows space to be folded (so to speak, I\'m
flailing for terminology here) up to 6-parsec distance, whereas the latter
can only reach the first level.  "Speed" doesn\'t really enter into the
equation, and neither does "efficiency" (except insofar as 6 parsecs is a 
lot more (2- or 3-D) distance than 1 parsec).
     That, then, is my complaint.  You (Kenneth) seem to be assuming that 
the increased high-end capability of the J-6 engine should go hand in hand
with increased low-end efficiency, but the way (IIRC) Jump-space(s) were
explained, this assumption isn\'t true.  Accessing any of the various
jump-levels (and misjump data leads us to believe that there are more than
6, but the higher ones are REALLY hard to access) leads to a week-long
reaction regardless, and it\'s the level accessed, rather than the "speed" 
of the ship, that determines where you\'ll arrive at the end of the reaction.
(A misjump is interpreted as accidentally accessing the wrong field/ level
of j-space).
     If I continue to recall correctly (IICTRC?) the MT fuel-consumption
formulae gave further credence to this system-  a J-6 capable ship used the
equivalent amount of fuel entering J-6 as a J-1 capable ship used entering
J-1, and a J-6 ship entering J-1 used less fuel, but still more than 
one-sixth the amount of a J-6 (meaning that making 6 J-1s wasn\'t the same
energy spent (over a longer time) as making one J-6).
     While obviosuly these are post-hoc rationalizations for why the
seemingly-sensible complaint you\'ve made isn\'t the case (why can\'t J-6 ships
also make J-1s faster), it seems to fit the bill (to me, anyway) for the 
kind of "scientific" justification which you complained that the jump-space
rules were missing.
     Hope I made myself clear and didn\'t make any major canon-gaffes based
on faulty-memory-induced misconceptions.  Can someone who has ready access
to the DGP "Starship Operators" book either back me up or point out how and
where I went wrong?  Even if it\'s not of general list-interest, I\'d like to
know.

You asked for feed back:  It all looks great, but I don\'t like this leaving systems 
blank, like what was done with the Core subsector in the main book, at all.  I want to 
see the new materials support what has already been published.  

Besides, there is a lot of room for GMs to detail and customize a star system even if 
the stats of the main planet are provided.  In my campaigns, I do a lot with a systems 
outer/inner planets (planets other than the main world).  I use the World Builder\'s 
Handbook and my own imagination to fill in the holes.

The main world stats are just a skeleton to flesh out.  I can guarantee you that the way 
I flesh it out and the way another might is completely different.  There is plenty of 
room for customization.

What I want is for you guys to dazzle us with something new--not change what we are 
already used to.

Here\'s my answer to that, Eris:  Because it feels wrong without them.

You people think that I\'m disappointed with the T4 task system!  You should have seen me 
when I bought TNE.  The Virus--the D20s--UHHH, I shudder.

TNE changed the Traveller system, and I spent a year, off and on, converting the whole 
TNE book to using the MT task system.  Why?

Because I wouldn\'t drop the D6 in Traveller any more than I would drop the D20 in 
AD&D--or the percentage dice from Star Trek.  It is like taking MacArthur\'s pipe away 
from him.  It\'s like revoking James Bond\'s license to kill.  It\'s like leaving some of 
the planets from the Core subsector blank in the main book.  Get the picture?

Why do I support D6s in Traveller?  I don\'t have a good reason other than I like it that 
way.  It feels good.  And, maybe, that is the best reason after all.

The jury is still out.  I\'m printing all of these wonderful tables that you, and the 
many others, have posted.  I\'m going to take my time, meet with my math teacher player,

	My reason to use subspace/gate combination was the jump drive

	components are needed, how much power the drives need, and how

	Yes, this is true. Another way to totally disrupt the "canonical"
	Traveller background, is to use 3D real space model in stead of 2D
	Traveller maps. Many Traveller trade routes cease to exist if the
	starmap takes into account that the stars may be separated by several
	parsecs from the galactic central plane.

        I think that Traveller is slightly burdened by its history. While
        new editions attempt to be compatible with previous editions,
        this compatibility may cause some problems, especially in technology
        rules. That is, after FFS was published the laser output had to be
        limited to TL x 50 Mj, because otherwise strong lasers would make
        all other weapons (and existing "canonical" starships) redundant.

Jump-5 takes one week to jump 5 parsecs--that\'s 1 parsec in 1/5th of a week.  1/5th, 
said as a percentage, is 20%.

The jump-1 ship can make a 1 parsec jump in 7 days.  The jump-5 ship can make it in 1.4 
days.  20% of 7 is also 1.4 days.

I use the MT Starship OP Guide too, but I hadn\'t thought of doing this with the j-drive.

I personally don\'t have a problem with the high weighting of
attributes.  From my experience of TNE, these situations don\'t arise
too often:  Given the choice the players will take the skill they\'re
going to be good at, not the one they\'re going to have to sink six
points in before they\'re reasonable.

This is also reflected in real life (to an extent), for example how
many football players have a low edurance?  Or helicopter pilots low
dexterity?  In my case I will readily admit my strength is below
average, and this has lead me away from concentrating my efforts in
those areas.  I have had no opportunity to achieve that wrestling
skill of six because I know I\'d be no good, and not enjoy it, but due
to a high dex I took up fencing, enjoyed it, and am now skilled in it.

To sum up, I don\'t see the problem since the situation should not
exist.  If you really want to play a pilot, get the GM to allow you to
re-roll that low dex, if he won\'t design a character suited to the
attributes, don\'t try to force the character through years of misery
(and several crashed planes) in piloting school where he is never as
naturally good as the next guy on the course.

Don\'t forget, characters are people too...

I for one am not prepared to handle all the bookeeping with regards to
aging, etc, that would be introduced with different time \'streams\'.  If
your players get anxious, just zip through the week to the next stop.

Once again, two suggestions:
(1) Re wrong world positions, etc. Could anyone with a space science
background tell me if the relative motions of star systems cause the
positions to "appear" to change on the map due to it being only a 2D
representation, and effectively being a map of jump space rather than real
space?

(2) Why aren\'t the Core Worlds explored? Unlikely that they\'re not explored
- - the data just isn\'t available to your average person. If the Syleans had a
strong feeling that to build their power, etc. they needed to keep
genetically clean, they might well have avoided a lot of contact with the
surrounding worlds, preferring to keep to their developed core and not
\'taint\' their populace (either genetically, or through the influx of foreign
religions, ideas, etc.). After 650 years (or whatever), Cleon either thinks
that his people should have freedom from these restraints, or that the
profits out there are just too good to waste, or that his people are now
sufficiently proud and dedicated to the Sylean homeworlds that it is safe to
expose the general populace to external influences.

	Thats why we extended the save jump point to size^2*10 light
	seconds, and the dangerous to (size-1)^2*10 light seconds.

	Ok my system would change defence, e.g. 6 ships waiting 1 au
	around an large gas giant, could jump to an incoming ship (which
	needs about 40 hours to orbit) in some seconds, but as any jumps
	must face directly towards a mass, it will hit the same orbit

	never heard about the term duck hunter for a slow ship.

Now that you\'ve made the idea a little clearer for me, I like the idea too.  I\'d like to 
see this in an IG Combat Supplement.  The only problem here is that I think it will take 
a lot of work to complete such a system.  I feel it is beyond the scope of what we, or 
I\'m, trying to reach with a T4 task fix.

Let me reiterate.  I really, really, like the idea.  I just think we are talking about 
months of work coming up with a clean system for those aptitude numbers.  

Am I wrong about this?

Hold it right there.  You\'ve just touch on the root of my problem.  Why?  Why do the 
various levels of jump space require a week of time regardless.  You\'ve recalled the 
info in the Starship Op Manual correctly, but you are making my point for me.  I said in 
my last post that one of the main reasons that I don\'t buy the one-week-regardless 
system is that it has never been made clear why it is so.  Traveller goes into great 
detail about how other items work--and they usually make sense.  This is not so with 
jump space.  They just ask you to believe.

Yes, jump space is divided into levels--I\'ll buy that.  But, why does each level require 
a week?  Why not variable times.  Why not longer times?  Why any time at all?    

>  Can someone who has ready access to the DGP "Starship Operators" book either back me 	up or point out how and
> where I went wrong?  

Hey, I\'ve got the Starship Op Manual.  Here\'s the section you referred to.  My comments 
are in [].

Pg. 10, Starship Operator\'s Manual, Jump Drive chapter, section on Theory:

The operation of jump drive is quite complex, and varying theories exist as to why it 
works.  Even the greatest scientists of the Imperium admit they do not fully understand 
the principles behind the workings of jump drive.  The following description, based in 
large part on the works of the Jump-space Institute at Deneb, is greatly simplified.

[See.  They don\'t really know how it works.  And below, they give no reason as to why it 
takes a week to travel the jump space levels.  It just is...  You must BELIEVE....]

In understanding jump drive, one must first understand jumpspace.  Following the Big 
Bang (some 15 billion years ago) a multitude of dimensions existed--far more that the 
four which we normally perceive.  

[I\'d buy this.  Makes sense]

Within seconds, however, most of these dimensions collapsed into nothingness and were 
lost.  From that point on, we have the familiar three dimensions of space and the one of 
time.

However, the era of modern physics dawned with the realization that more dimensions than 
the four we know survived the Big Bang.  Modern cosmology places the number of existing 
dimensions at no fewer than 62.

[Hey, what was that post about the ANSWER?  Oh, that was 42--never mind.]

The vast majority of these alternate dimensions do not affect our everday life in 
anyway.  Beyond the first four dimensions, many of the others are in force only at the 
subatomic level, while the remaining three dozen are accessible only via jump drive.

The various jumpspace dimensions are described by modern physicistis as levels. Each 
jumpspace level has its own character, defined by the physical laws which operate there: 
 these laws are known as the level\'s weave.  A level\'s weave ranges from very loose 
(easily entered) to very tight (difficult to enter).

[What they have just said, is that it takes more energy to enter the higher levels, so 
more advanced jump drives require more fuel to generate the energy to rip open normal 
space and enter jump space.  They elaborate more on this aspect later, but I\'m not going 
to type it all.  Check your book or take my word for it.]

[They go on to say that each level corresponds to the 6 jump levels attainable by 
j-drives.  The only mention of time in jump space is the next line below.]

Since jump drive is able to cover such distances in only seven days, jumpspace makes 
interstellar travel practical.

[Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why do they not tell us why jump space requires about a 
week--no matter the level?  They go into such detail to explain how the rest of jump 
space works--why is time just a given?]



I submit to you again.  My idea of "faster" jump drives does not change any of the 
science behind the jump drive, the theory (except duration) behind jump space, or the 
economic/communication situation established in Traveller.

Besides, it feels better as well.

Yeah, when I said increase the difficulty by 1 or 2 levels I *meant* shift 
everything up by 1d3 or 1d6 (whadya mean your telepathy isn\'t working?).

Personally, I think we should abandon the task system completely and 
convert to White Wolf\'s WOD system.

Hey, Joe, what were you saying about adding smileys?

Uh, Yeah, I like your stop watch idea better too, but it was me, Paul, not
Trent. :)  Just don\'t want Trent to get labeled as a canon basher without
just cause. :)  BTW, your stop watch idea would help explain why ships
arrive at different locations in the system as well.

Now a few comments

>Possible Aptitudes  (2d6)/2,dn or (2d3)-1

I think 1D3 for this would be perfrct.

>Aggressiveness  - modifies combat type skills
>Charsima        - modifies interpersonal/social skills
>Esthetic        - modifies artistic skills
>Linguistic      - modifies communication/language skills
>Mechanical      - modifies technical/mechanical skills
>Natural         - modifies biological/wilderness/agurian skills
>Scientific      - modifies science/theory skills

I would move Linguistic into the Charisma group, to make the group only six.
Sorta keeps the Traveller feel. :)

This is good.  I agree with the ideas you\'ve got here.  I am not quite yet
willing to give up on my skill specialty idea yet either.  Maybe there is
some way we could incorporate the two into a single idea.  foex, the
apptitudes would be either a 1 or 0 and the skill specialty would be a 0 to
2 (or 3) then the skill modifier would be gained by adding the two together.

 Okay time for me to rant again.  I hate ranting but unfortunately I\'ve
 never seen anything that would indicate that Spires was ever colonized
 by the Rule of Man.  Or anything else, worlds colonized during anytime
 period are usually mentioned quite proudly in their background.  I feel

 Spiri are a minor race seeded by the ancients 300k ago.

 I never imagined Spires smelling like a garbage dump, but okay.  I   
always though it was more along the line of an airborne virus that the   
local populace was totally immune to.  Harded to detect and far more   
incidious.  I like the idea of obsidian tools, pop bottle bottoms and    
china plates also make extremely nice projectile points, I took a course 
 in university.

 This I like.  I personally find it rather distasteful that the 3rd

 observation of, and controlled experements on, social development."

    'body' => 'Well, I\'ll admit that I have not been following this thread 
very carefully, because I am happy enough with the system we 
use in our game, and so wasn\'t shopping for another.  But since 
there are shoppers on the list, I\'ll desribe our system and run 
the risk of saying something redundant or non-sequitur.  I think 
ours is a pretty slick system.

It involves few, if any tables.  All tasks are resolved by rolling 
percentile dice against a percentile figure.  This figure may be 
an attribute or a skill (or other things, if the GM throws them 
at you) adjusted up or down if circumstances make the task easier 
or harder than "normal" according to the GM.

Example:  You want to dodge a blow in a fist-fight.  You roll 
against your agility attribute.  If you\'re pretty agile, that 
attribute might be 85%.  So you want to roll 85% or lower on the 
percentile dice.

Critical hits:  If you roll *very* low, you have a "critical hit" 
and something extra-good happens.  "Very low" means you roll 0X% 
on your dice, when the stat you rolled against was XY%.  Thus, 
05% is a critical hit if you rolled against 57%.  In a fist-fight, 
a critical hit would typically mean you KOed your opponent.  
In a gun-fight, it would mean you were able to hit *exactly* the
right spot for your purpose -- a momentary sharpshoot.  For various 
skills, the GM usually gets creative.

Critical misses:  The down side is the very *high* roll, the "critical
miss."  You critically miss if you roll higher than 9X% against a 
stat of XY%.  Thus, 96% is a critical miss against 57%

Learning rolls:  If you have used a skill or attribute successfully 
in the course of a session, you can make a learning roll at the end of 
the session.  You roll against the stat, but this time you want to 
roll *higher* than the stat (so learning is easy when you\'re a beginner 
but slows down as you get better).  If you succeed, the stat goes up 
by one "learn rate," which we calculate from the values of the 
attributes involved.  It is typically 2 to 5 percentage points.

We like the "flavoring" that critical hits and misses give, and the 
automatic advancement system, with no GM judgements needed.

Actually I beleive that that number should be more like 90K not 900K 
we\'re looking at Homo Erectus back then.

Austrolopithicus 3,000,000+
Homo Habilus 2,000,000-1.6 million
Homo Erectus 1.6 to 300-400k
Early Archaic Homo Sapiens round about 300k
Late Archaic Homo Sapiens 100k-300k
Modern Homo Sapien 30-100k

If you want to know the morphological differences I\'d be happy to tell 
you but it\'s a bit of a long talk so I\'ll wait till I get a responce on 
that.

For a good system for defining Male and Female differences in morphology 
look at the Harn Master system.  

First the character generates a frame.  

Scant/Light/Regular/Heavy/Massive--  This give you an idea as to the 
general skeletal morphology of the individual and an indication of 
general bulk.  Women roll with a -3 on this giving them on average Light 
Frames.

Then the character\'s Height is generated.  From the Height and Frame the 
characters\' weight is interpolated from a table.  Scant and Light Frames 
have lower body weights and Heavy and Massive frame have highter body 
weights.  +-10% & +-20%

Then the characters generate their strenght.  There strenght is related 
directly to their weight and characters who only weigh 100 lbs have 
minus\'s.  Oddly as a physical characteristic the charater can be 
overweight, but the strenght statistic is modified by their unmodified 
weight not their modified obese weight.

I can vouch for this...  When I was growing up and living at home, I 
was working tons of hours and making $150-200 a week.  I spent a 
little bit of it on gas and insurance for the car, the rest...went to 
local bookstores, record shops, and of course, the local gameshops...

Now, I\'m lucky if I can scrounge the $20-25 to buy 1 thing a month, 
and often don\'t get to do that.

Marc Miller\'s Traveller - Bureaucrat Career Description
by Scott Galliand

	To run any government, the politicians and leaders of that
society need an (usually) efficient organization to run and maintain the
institutions that make up that government.  These oraganizations are the
government bureaucracies, and the basic component of these organizations
is the bureaucrat.
	Bureaucrats can be found anywhere in any government.  When the
down-and-out citizen who just lost his job is looking for assistance in
ending his unemployment, it is the bureaucrat who assists him in getting
the required forms completed so he may get his unemployment check and
other possible entitlements.  It is the bureaucrat who does all the
research on a situation for an ambassador to negotiate, as well as runs
his embassy offices while the ambassador is conducting business.  
	Bureaucrats aren\'t always the easiest people with which to deal. 
The common bureaucrat at times as a tendency to "hide behind the rules"
when dealing with a situation that is too unique for his experiences. 
The bureaucrat also has a tendency to become "set in his ways", not
allowing change to occur or to occur very slowly when such a situation
occurs.  Some citizens sometimes find it daunting to deal with the huge
bureaucracy of his government, and the bureaucrat can seem only as an
unhelpful cog in a relentless and uncontrolled machine.
	Regardless, without the bureaucrat, a government or even
corporation could not run efficiently.
ROUTINE TASKS:Shuffling files, researching proposals, dealing with
citizen\'s complaints/problems, acting as an interface between the
government/corporate entity and the outside agencies & citizens.

NOTES:

*  I have included bonuses for college degrees and service in the
military in the enlistment roll.  In the U.S. government, you get a
certain number of "points" for various different things.  One of these is
the college degree you have.  It is beneficial in some areas to have a
college degree.  If you have a higher degree (Masters or better) your
chances of getting a position are better.  You also get "points" for
serving in one of the military services when you apply for a job after
retiring.  

(Question: Should I consider the Scout or Agent careers as military
services to allow them to have this benefit when applying for entry into
the service?).

** Promotion might be a little confusing.  There are two options.  I have
slightly based the career on a little experience with the U.S. government
bureaucratic system.  In this system, up to a certain level, the
bureaucracy is hired and is promoted through merit and personal
preference.  Progression through this segment of the system is slower
than some other careers, thus the 7- for the roll up to the O5 level. 
Above O5, this is the "Secretary" level.  All of these are primarily
appointed by the chief executive of the state in question and aren\'t
permanent (usually changes when a new administration is elected in
democratic systems or at the whim of the executive in a non-democratic). 
Advancement after this point should be slowed and based solely on the
influence the character has within the government or with the chief
executive.

   It may also be appropriate to include some details about the last days of
the Second Imperium (Rule of Man), and how Sylea came to be the seat of one
of the last emperors.

   As with the Roman Empire (and to a degree the United States), all these
things would have been used and more, including just plain old fashion
conquest.  "By whatever means necessary to expand the empire."  Of course as
the Third Imperium matures, this attitude would change--the desire for
stability, and the sense that might doesn\'t necessarily make right.  But this
would be a very expansionistic period, and those who have too many scruples
would be given posts as minor bureaucrats.

   Without question, the scouts would proceed far ahead of the borders of the
empire.  This is only prudent--because if the Third Imperium has TL 12 and is
the big kid on the block, it is entirely possible that there is an empire out
there that is just as advanced (or even more advanced) and is an even
*bigger* kid on *his* block.  Knowledge of that fact would allow you to
prepare for the threat before the bigger kid invaded your neighborhood.

   And what to say of Terra?  Would they know of the existence of the Old
Earth Union in Year 0?  If not, then is Terra this place where the Solomani
came from that probably no longer exists (in other words, presumed decimated
at the end of the Second Imperium)?  You can\'t say that it is the world on
which humanity evolved, since that theory hasn\'t been proposed yet.  Seems
like there should be some mistaken reasoning at play here which would
preclude the Syleans from rushing rimward to contact their brethern.  Maybe
they try and the OEU and other governments react so negatively that the
Syleans rule out further contact for a while.

   Just make sure that it doesn\'t have a somewhat dispersed structure,
consisting of a saucer section (for the bridge, weapons and crew quarters,
etc.), which is connected to a cylinder section (engineering, shops, shuttle
bay), and that the cylinder section doesn\'t have a couple of engine pods
connected to it by long booms.  Oops, sorry, I\'m thinking of a battlecrusier.

I disagree...

Feedback from others might be good on our ideas.  No 1 person\'s ideas
are so great that somebody else might not be able to build on 1 of
them.  Besides which, this is exactly the kind of thing the list was

Possible...

How about this 1:

4)  Noticing that most of the dates listed in the newer reference are
rounded off numbers (mostly even 50\'s or 100\'s).  What if historical
data for previous events is sketchy in year 0.  What if MM wants
intentionally to leave it sketchy...

14 years is not a big thing in a frame of reference which extends
3700+ years in the future.  Our own history is arbitrary on fixing
dates for historical events.  

Most historians fix the date for the collapse of the Western Roman
Empire as 476 AD, when the Leader of the Ostrogoths lopped the head of
the last Emperor off in favor of crowning himself King...  But really,
the Ostrogoths had pretty much dictated who was Emperor since 452, so
really, the Emperor ceased to be an Emperor in fact for 24 years prior
to the demise of the last 1...  So is it 452, or 476?  You could make
a case for either 1.  Or probably even 1 earlier than that, since the
Western Roman Empire was little more than an Adriatic state even
before 452...

Need a more recent example?  Take a look at WW2.  Most historians fix
the start date of the conflict with the invasion of Poland in 1939. 
Really, the Japanese and Chinese had been going at it hammer and tongs
as far back as 1931 in Manchuria.  This is 60 years ago, and the
historians still can\'t get it right...

My point:  Its hard to fix arbitrary dates on events that take 
several years to evolve.  Maybe being off 14 years isn\'t that bad. 
Maybe MM didn\'t want to get that detailed.  Maybe he wants to rewrite
a lot of the DGP stuff to something he likes better.  The fact that
there\'s 14 years difference for a historical event is NOT all that
significant, and certainly doesn\'t change the broad sweep of history
in the Traveller universe, IMNSHO...

My fortune program some time ago displayed an essay written by Mark Twain,
which is very similar to the thing above.  So it\'s probably a little older
than 50 years :-)

be used for good gaming.  At least your system is consistent, whereas 
many mutable-time-travel stories don\'t worry about consistency until 
it\'s too late.

However, *my* hard science fiction neck hairs bristle at the idea of 
a vast (potentially infinite) spectrum of parallel worlds (your 
femto-second time ripples) laid out in a new dimension of "hyper-time,"
so to call it.  It looks like epicycles to me.

To the suffering time-traveller, our timelock effect probably does 
look like a supernatural genie guarding history.  But it is really 
more like the "omnipotent force" that frustrates the builders of 
perpetual motion machines or those who would trisect angles or calculate
the last digit of pi.

If you try to calculate the last digit of pi, I don\'t know how far you\'ll
get before you give up, but I know you won\'t succeed.  Likewise, in the 
merely four-dimensional system of timelocked time-travel, I don\'t know 
what will happen to prevent you from changing the past, but I know you 
won\'t do it, not because of a mysterious temporal force acting on you, 
but because I have reliable historical information that you *didn\'t* 
do it.

Also, there\'s always this loophole: You CAN "re-write the history books"
if the books were wrong to begin with.  ("But I thought that, in fourteen
hundred and ninety-three Columbus sailed the boundless sea."  "No, no, in

I\'d also include some detail about some of the opposistion to the new
Imperium, both internal and external.  I think some of the internal
politics would be really interesting, scheming nobles, duels, etc.  I
really like the flavor that you gave the Imperium in T4, its the best
part of the book.  It feels different than the 1100 Imperium, which it should.  

As for the external threats, what opposistion does the Imperium face,
pocket empires, Vargr corsairs, etc.  I think a quick overview of some
of the closer pocket empires would be interesting.

Looking in my CT Zhodani Supplement I notice the Zhodani Timeline.  Before
contacting the Imperial Traders in 50 the Zhodani had established contact
with several other species.  For example the two most recent contacts
(before 0) were the Vargr in -2800 and then the Vilini in -2000.  I\'m not
sure but I seem to recall the Vargr and Vilini having contact with Imperium
well before year 0.  So this allows quite a bit of time for not only
knowledge of the Zhodani to meet the Imperium but quite possibly the chance
of Zhodani to physically be within the Imperium.  This could explain some
questions about Zhodani during Mileau 0.  IMHO.

Imperium too. Right now one gets the impression that everyone in the former
Sylean federation is happy, and that nearly every world contacted is equally
happy to drop its existing plans and join the Imperium. There must be some
exceptions to this - it would be good to see them detailed.       

- -people inside the Imperium who opposed the replacement of the Federation
government (was it democratic?) with an autocratic Imperium
- -people inside the Imperium who think the Imperium has no business imposing 
its rule on other worlds
- -on the flip side, people who think the Imperium should be much more 
agressive in expanding, and replace particularly unpleasant local governments
on new member worlds with more pleasant (and pro-imperial) ones
- -economic disruptions inside the Imperium - fusion+ is a new enough technology
that the repurcussions must still be settling out; some people have become
rich, in the long term everyone is going to become comfortable, but in the
short term there are a lot of unemployed power plant engineers out there
(and a lot of people who still haven\'t learned to drive their 3000 mph
speeders very well yet...and probably a handful of people who are realizing
that a small organization can afford to buy a fusion+/thruster powered
cutter, and that a fusion+/thruster powered cutter can flatten a 
large city.)

Outside the imperium - do worlds only join the Imperium voluntarily? Are
there some that have been annexed militarily instead? (Possibly after a 
war that they started, or possibly even after a war that the Imperium
provoked.) Are other pocket empires - some of which might be comparable in
size to the young Imperium - organizing to resist the wave of expansion?

One of the best things about the Reform Coalition setting in TNE was that
it had some moral ambiguity - within the RC there were different factions
with equally valid views of how future expansion should be carried out,
and there were legitimate questions about the morality of the RC\'s
expansion and its long-term stability. It would add a considerable depth to 
the new Imperium if it had similar grey areas (even if we all know in our  
hearts that the Imperium is the right side.)

In addition, it would be good to include all the appropriate rules
modifications needed for the new setting - world generation tables that
produce Milleu 0 tech levels, not 1107 tech levels, for example - in
*both* books - not everyone will buy the Atlas.

A nice historical piece on the 1st & 2nd Imperium would be a good 
idea.  It should be written from the point of view of the Syleans in general, 
and Cleon in particular.  Such an essay should cover the following 
points.

History of Sylea under the 1st & 2nd Imperiums, as well as during the 
Long Night...
Sylean slanted view of the history of the 1st Imperium
Sylean view of the Interstellar Wars and 1st contact with Terran 
Confederation
Sylean view of the history of the 2nd Imperium
Ancestral myth of Cleon\'s family connections to the last Emperor of 
the Rule of Man...

A lot of this would be relatively incomplete, and incorrect relative 
to later essays on the same, as the Syleans don\'t have access to the 
records of the thousands of worlds outside their own domain, and such 
a point of view would be distorted as well due to Cleon\'s desired 
succession myth...  

I can see a lot of adventure ideas coming out of PC\'s just discovering that 
the view they\'ve been spoonfed about the history of various 
things/worlds/peoples in the earlier Imperiums just being plain wrong...

I might take a stab at some of this later, if I get the chance...

Intriguing...  

There should be a lengthy biography of Cleon I, as his personality

Keep the longevity differences of Vilani from DGP, modified if

I\'d stick to previous published work on them as much as desirable, 
possible...

4. Playing Solomani (and the differences between Early Imperium 
Solomani, and later post-Hypothesis Solomani)

Other suggestions:

I was wondering if there any resources which talked about any of the
following:

languages - I assume that many Earth languages were spread throughout
the Imperium, but what other languages are there?  I assume that the
other branches of humanity also have multiple languages.  What\'s the
Imperium standard?  Is there one?  What are the languages of the
Zhodani, etc..?  There are word generation charats in the various old
CT race books, but not one for the Vilani.

religions - Someone else mentioned that they wanted to do a future
history of Earth\'s major religions.  I\'d be interested in what religions
other races and other branches of humanity follow as well.  How did the
various religions react to each other?  Has religion died out?  The
official world seems to evade this issue (with good reason :).

philosophies - These are related to religions, but what major schools
of thought are there?  We have various philosophies on Earth, though
the differences between them and religions is sometimes tenuous.  Does
anyone have any ideas for Imperial philosophies?

This kind of information greatly fleshes out a campaign.  I have been
away from Traveller for a while and am slowly relearning the history
and Imperium and am interested in the background, primarily (I may
convert the whole thing or parts to GURPS... <duck>)

	So the story about the the Ancient artifact is probably being told 
to Ed in a spaceport bar, with Joe2 looking on in awe, while Screegle 
is sitting there clucking his tongue, knowing that Joe obviously was 
violating IAASHA (Imperial Ancient Artifact Safety and Health 
Administration) Directive 324.8955746 Sub 34.23 Para 476 which _clearly_ 
states:

	"No one named Joe may touch Ancient artifacts with (A) devices
resembling or constructed of small woody plant stems or branches, or (B)
other analogues therof constructed of various materials inclusive of metal,
polymer, composite materials, crystal and quasicrystal (both natural and
manufactured), or natural materials. (A) and (B) are not to be construed as
exhaustive lists of possible violating devices, and Field Agents of the
54.9967-X Grade or higher have full authority to declare other devices as
necessary for the enforcement of this directive."

Everyone was complaining that things were "*way* too easy". So how about
shifting the difficulty levels by *one* die. That\'d make the end
result tasks that are one die harder than the rules, but with the
ovrwhelming attribute factor taken out.

Pseudo-scientific Explaination #1:

Jumpspace dimensions, (J-1 thru 6) have a different quantum time, planck
or whatever constant than n-space, which necessitate that the ship exits
J-space in 1 week increments.
(okay, that one\'s a stretch, considering previous canon on misjumps
etc.)

Pseudo-scientific Explanation #2 (the better):

Jump capable ships have a Zuchai crystal grid in the hull. This grid is
powered by the jump drive until it is "hot" enough to punch a "hole"
through normal space and allow the ship to enter jump space. (Ref: the
excellent DGP product Starship Operators Manual, I\'m going by memory
here, so if I\'ve got anything wrong, bear with me.)

The zuchai crystal grid surrounding the ship requires about a week to
"cool down" in order for the ship to exit jumpspace. It is physically
impossible to speed the cooling off of the grid without risking
destroying its integrity and being lost in jumpspace. (but for the
interest of a good story, one could try! Risking a misjump of course :-)
Once the grid has "cooled", the ship exits j-space and enters n-space at
the calculated location, close to a gravity well.


What follows is my minor canon breaking (shock! horror!) extension of
this description, it might be a bad idea, but for those who like
breaking things:

Travel in jumpspace is virtually instantaneous. J-1 is a quantum
jumpspace location spanning circa 1 parsec in normal space, J-2 is one
location spanning 2 parsecs in n-space, etc. There is no known way to
predictably travel from one J-space quantum location to another except
through a misjump. (Tho\' grandfather likely knows :-)

If one wished, power could be continued to be spent keeping the zuchai
crystal grid "hot". In this case, distance travelled would not be
changed, just the time spent in jumpspace extended. Useful for waiting
out suspected pirates.

The reason why it takes one week to travel through jumpspace is that it
takes that long for the grid to "cool-down" and the ship to exit
j-space. Alternate materials cool at different rates. Zuchai crystals
have been found to be the most effective at reducing jump times, but if
Zuchai isn\'t available, <insert fancy material here> Crystals or some
fansy-shmancy Ceramic stuff can be used, increasing travel time by X
days (X hours? X percent?) The ship would also be more prone to
misjumps, or more likely to lose grid integrity from damage in a
firefight. (more drama added here) Zuchai is simply the most efficient
material available at TL 9-16.

At TL-<insert ungodly tech level here> advanced materials and methods
have been discovered that reduce travel time by, say 20%-40%.

I think the simplest and most logical explaination is that in T4 they
just rounded most of the dates to the nearest half century or so,
assuming the actual dates are lost in the mists of time...

I can\'t explain why the beginning of the third Imperium etc. are
apparently out by 3 years tho\'. Perhaps T4 uses CT material as a
reference? Since I\'m at work I don\'t have older CT reference material to
see if MT is different from the earlier material. (though I suspect this
is so - MT was really buggy)

Actually, I\'ve got some stuff in the works, but with my insane 70-hour
workweek have no time to collate it into a readable format.  I will
eventually publish it on my web site.

I\'ve noticed that some of the early Christian \'heresies\' make a lot of sense
- - in sense that they are internally consistent. Add in fusions with other
religious philosophies, and you have scope for new sects that are
\'Christian\', but unlike the ones common today.

A friend has being doing the same with Judaism.  (Being Jewish, he has the
background for this.)  This will also appear as part of the same document.

I\'d say that IG is doing two things:

1) Rounding off some dates to the nearest 50 years

2) Making a judgement between MT\'s canon and CT\'s canon.

dates marked with (?) are speculative. Dates marked with ? are unknown.

I don\'t know why MT changed the CT dates across the board. (There were a
few inconsistancies to be resolved, but the whole dating system
changed!) But there you have it.

In a like vein, look at championship weightlifters. They are not schwarzeneggers, they 
are barrel chested pillars
2300 AD had something similiar for morphology, but failed to distinguish between the

But it absolutely *destroys* the *military* situation.

Consider this not uncommon scenario.

Invading fleet jumps into unimportant system to regroup & refuel before
jumping to the target system. Target system is 1 parsec away. And there
are screening forces in this system.

Under the Traveller rules, the screening forces will send a courier,
and fight until they have to retreat, with heavy ships hanging on to
delay the enemy, and then finally jumping out. Smaller ships will jump
out early, except for possible "rear guard" forces and some left behind
to act as guerillas from hidden bases.

The time between the arrival of the courier with the warning, and the
arrival of the enemy is determined *solely* by how long the screening
force can delay them.

Under your rules, the goal of the screening force is to do as much
*damage* as possible, then get the hell out of there. And the interval
between when the courier arrives and when the invaders arrive is
determined by the difference in jump drive capability between the
courier and the *slowest* ships in the invading fleet. 

So instead of *hours* of warning, you get *days* of warning. This
totally screws strategy and tactics.

Traveller is based on the idea that word of an attack can\'t travel
faster than the attackers. You\'ve thrown that away. "Pearl Harbor"
attacks are a much more difficult proposition in your universe.

As for scientific basis, I\'ll explain why Jump takes a week, regardless
as soon as you explain why Charge and Spin come in fixed quantities,
but mass doesn\'t. :-)

I was referring to situations where you pretty much *know* where they

Better do some figuring. Look up just what the "equilibrium temp" is at
2 stellar diameters out from various stars. You *won\'t* like the
answer. Also work out the escape velocity at that distance. You won\'t
like it either (as in, your ship doesn\'t have the power to get away)

I bought a fair amount of Megatraveller stuff, but no TNE. And I didn\'t
buy the Starship Operator\'s manual. 

*None* of the stuff I have "explains" things. And the explanations I
hear quoted (all from that one book) for things like thruster plates
are pure nonsense.

I\'m sorry, but *none* of the "explanations" make sense. Not even the
one for meson guns. If they make sense to you, that\'s merely because
you don\'t know enough about phsyics.

Because that\'s the way the designers intended the game to work! All
other "explanations" are just BSing.

But given that you accept "levels", consider that just maybe there
*are* other levels. And they take a lot longer. The ones that get used
are the "best" that are practical to use.

You are confusing *how* with *why*. "How" it works is that you build a
piece of equipment that meets certain criteria, feed it the right
amount of power under the right conditions, and you "enter jumpspace"
and emerge a week later at some distance from where you started.

*Why* is not really a scientific question. *Why* do relativistic
effects occur? Nobobody knows. But we have come up with equations that
*describe* the effects, and letr us make predictions about what they\'ll
be in cases we haven\'t tried yet.

And nobody knows *why* the speed of light has the value it does. It
just is. Belief has nothing to do with it. It\'s an observable fact.

Perhaps you are unaware of how many things get discovered and used even
though no-one has any idea as to how they work. Electrical
transformers, batteries, crystal detectors, many chemical processes are
all things that were in *commercial* use long before any real
explanation of them was available. Heck, we\'ve been using catalysts for
centuries and we still aren\'t sure *how* they do what they do.

You are holding Traveller to a higher standard than the real world,
friend.

Besides the fact that "dimension" has a meaning rather different than
most people realize, there are problems with the above. Dimensions
*can\'t* vanish. If they exist, they will continue to exist.

Consider the classic example of a "two dimensional" universe. The third
dimension still exists, even if the universe doesn\'t extend in that
"direction". 

The current theories allow for dimensions that are very, very small (ie
the maximum "distance" you can travel in them before returning to your
starting point. This is likely what the authors were thinking about.

Current theories require between 11 and 26 dimensions to make the
universe "work".

Sorry, but the "subatomic level" *does* affect "everyday life". And
often quite profoundly. For example, *all* chemical reactions are a
result of effects involving quantum exchanges between atomic nuclei as
masked by the surrounding electrons.

They are *describing* how it works. And the time is not a "given",
anymore than the speed of light is. Instead, it is an observed
constant. Science is *full* of these. There\'s no reason "why" they have
these values, just the observed *fact* that they do.

The closest to a "why" science has for some of these is expressed in
the Anthropic principle. This merely notes that when you work out the
way the universe would act if these constants had different values, it
turns out that we wouldn\'t be here to observe them. It takes
*incredibly* small changes in some pretty obscure constants to result
in things like a universe were stars can\'t form, or where they don\'t
last long enough for life to evolve.

> I submit to you again.  My idea of "faster" jump drives does not

Since there *isn\'t* any science you are correct. But if you include the
"science" from things like you quoted, then you *have* changed it,
since the quotes say it takes a week, and you don\'t. (ie, you\'ve
changed the "observed effects")

> the theory (except duration) behind jump space,

Going by what you quoted, they are repeatedly telling you that there
*aren\'t* any theories, just observations!

> or the economic/communication situation established in Traveller.

It *does* change communications. It makes it possible to warn System A
of a fleet leaving System B, as long as the courier has a better jump
drive than the *worst* ship in the fleet. That\'s pretty much a given. 

And in Year 0, that\'s a *huge* advantage. Consider that much of a fleet
would be jump 1. But that a courier could be Jump 2 or even jump 3.
That gives from 3.5 to 4.7 *days* of warning. 

So you\'ve just made surprise attacks by major forces impossible. You\'ve
also made it impossible to *force* a fleet to fight you. If they have
scouts with J3 in the surrounding hexes, they have *days* to jump out
before you get there.

I\'d say that relative motion is definitely a factor, if a small one.
What do our star-maps not show?  Other star systems that have no planets
or just a couple of barren rocks in far orbits.  In the writing project
I belong too we have a name for these:  Null Points.  There\'s no point
(pardon the pun) to use these in everyday astronavigation--as there is
no possibility of trade (code Ba) or frontier refueling (no GG, planets
with water or belts).  The main effect that these stars would have is to
alter the \'Gravimetric Landscape\'

<psuedoscience handwave mode ON>

We all know the main limitation with Jump Drive is that you can\'t
reliably use it while in close proximity to a gravity well.  Gravity
(the warping of our 4-dimensional space-time fabric) obviously has a
major impact on entry and navigation across J-Space.

The convenient measurement of how far a Jump Drive can get you is the
Parsec.  I submit that this is only an approximation or even just a
generalization of the difficulty of the jump.  In this scheme, the
Parsec takes on the same meaning as the Displacement Ton. 

A world that is 1 hex (\'one parsec\') away from another could mean that
it has a mean distance of approximately 3.6 light years, (+/- 50%) or
that because of the relative \'clear route\' (i.e. no other
starsystems/null points effecting the J-Space flight path).

However a world that is 6 hexes (\'6 parsecs\') away from another might
only be a few lightyears away, but because of a \'cluttered\' route (lots
of null points making that initial run into J-Space very tough, or
having to use J-6 space (as per the Starship Ops Guide) to \'leap\' over
the clutter.

At this time the Imperium has just rediscovered Jump-3 drive technology,
and Jump-2 is \'bleeding edge tech\' for the rest of the TL-11 universe
(probably reserved for military ships).  Your average trader is going to
have a Jump-1 drive--it makes getting to those \'unnamed\' worlds very
hard.  It\'s been mentioned before that this is the \'Official\' map.  This
is what the Imperium has released for it\'s general navigation charts.
The worlds not listed might be Red Zones (that\'s if we had a TAS to call
it that in year 0) for various reasons.

Hell, there\'s unknown!!  Get your characters to find a J-2 (or J-3)
capable ship and explore them!  I applaud IG for letting me make my T4
universe exactly the way I want it!

Skill + (attrib-7)

2+ (9-7)= 4

Right.

And if she had the skill at "level 0" then she\'d still have a 1 bonus,
for a total of 1. Not good, but better than the guy with *no* Edu
bonus, or no skill at all.

Great. The Sun is size 432. That means you have to get out to 520 light
*hours* to make a safe jump. Or only 517 light hours to make a
"dangerous" one.

Want to try that one again?

Ships *are* masses. So jumping towards one is perfectly acceptable.

ps. Someone else was talking about having to be 200 stellar diameters
out to jump, and arriving 2 stellar diameters out. For the sun that
means you have to be 1.856 AU out, and you arrive .01856 AU out. That\'s
one *hell* of a sunburn, folks! (4 *megawatts* per square meter of hull!)
There\'s also the not so trivial matter of the sun exerting 1.75 g on
your ship at that distance. What? You only have a 1 g drive. Too bad...

Perhaps you should give him my quantum-mechanical statement of the law of
timelock:

	An event, having been observed, cannot be un-observed.

A restatement in Plain English is:

	You can\'t change your own past.

That\'s it. It\'s simple, and profound in ways like the laws of
thermodynamics.  Sorry, you can\'t make a perpetual motion device. Sorry,
you can\'t change the past.

I understand his fear of mystical forces. Timelock isn\'t that much more
mystical than gravity or gyroscopic effects (Why *do* things fall, and why
*don\'t* gyroscopes or bicycles or whatever fall?). One of the arguments
against the model of the world that says that the Earth is spinning is the
very sensible observation that we can\'t *feel* the Earth spinning at 1000
MPH, and we oughta be able to if it were. This isn\'t stupid, it\'s
insightful. Today we believe differently, and have (what we think) are very
good reasons for believing differently.

Personally, I think that once you wrap your mind around it, timelock is
uncanny but a better explanation than multiple-worlds, just as our model of
cosmology is uncanny, but a better explanation than having to have those
crystal spheres.

I do like the "wave theory" (it\'s also a modification-theory) of time
travel he\'s proposed. I just like our "particle theory" better, because it
lets spacetime be spacetime -- a single substance. You can move in space,
you can move in time (and actually have to move in both). We intuitively
know the dangers that solid objects pose to moving in space. Timelock
effects are really no more than the solid objects of timetravel. These
temporal objects are nothing more than state vectors that are decided. Bump
into them hard, and you\'ll hurt yourself. Bump into them softly (we bump
into air softly all the time), and they\'ll accomodate you.

: Pseudo-scientific Explaination #1:
: 
: Jumpspace dimensions, (J-1 thru 6) have a different quantum time, planck
: or whatever constant than n-space, which necessitate that the ship exits
: J-space in 1 week increments.
: (okay, that one\'s a stretch, considering previous canon on misjumps
: etc.)

This is the most plausible if you look at what\'s been printed for
Traveller over the ages.  Basically, we know that Jump Space isn\'t one
dimension, but many.  We also know that it takes a more or less constant
amount of time to traverse these dimensions.  The only difference
between dimensions is the amount of energy needed to enter them.  If we
go with CT/MT, once in we sit back and relax because all of our jump
fuel was used to energize the jump into j-space.  If we go with TNE,
then the fuel is used throughout the jump to regulate the j-drive and
keep it from blowing up.

Now misjumps could be the result of incorrect energizing of the jump
field grid/drive/bubble/potential (your choice).  That tends to mess
things all kinds of up.  Depending on the type of misjump, you might be
entering a different jump dimension, or you may be travelling between
dimensions (hence to reason for the time incongruity).

: Pseudo-scientific Explanation #2 (the better):
: 
: Jump capable ships have a Zuchai crystal grid in the hull. This grid is

Actually, it\'s the lanthanum grid.  The zuchai crystals are the power
storage capicators in the jump drive.  Your explanation is nice, but the
jump grid is never mentioned as getting hot.  It\'s just the sequencing
of energy to punch a ship through n-space into j-space in a particular
way.  Also, one could argue that the heat idea is negated by the tales
of people being on the hull of the ship (just under the jump bubble).

My take is more for #1 because it seems to stick more with what\'s been
written about Traveller from the MM\'s j-space article back in JTAS 24 to
SOM to TNE.

To be honest, I would probably say that jump should be a combination of
grid and fuel for coolant.  I like the idea that the hull is doing the
energizing and entering of j-space, but I am also enamored with the idea
that the j-drive and engineer actually have something to do once in
jump.

Actually, this would be more like _Homo_erectus_.  Besdies, habilis
is somewhat dubious as a species as I understand it.  300,000 years
is also kinda close to neandertal (_H.sapiens.neandethalensis_) and
archaic _Homo_sapiens_ (what\'s a 100,000 years or so in the scheme
of things :-)

It might be neat to have a more detailled explanation of how the
various humans in traveller relate to one another.

Neandertal isn\'t very different from us now----and not very different
than what you\'d expect from humans on a high gravity world (more
robust).  It would be cool to come up with some reasonable
differences.  Starting at a point near archaic sapiens, or late
erectus, what would we get on the different transplanted worlds?

The "desired" (by grandfather) characteristics would be:  improved
bipedalism, intelligence.  Hmm, what else.  Completing the bipedal
transition (hell, we haven\'t finished that yet :-) would make
erectus more like us.  Same with brain capacity.  It might be neat
to point out the facial differences of the different races of man in
traveller.  As well as differences due to home world conditions
(especially on the transplants who had these new forces acting on
them).

Hmmm, interesting.

Better read the papers physics types are writing. Because that\'s
*exactly* what they suggest. If time travel is possible, it
*immediately* restricts available actions in certain circumstances,
because otherwise, it\'d be possible to create various nasty problems.
The odd thing is that they didn\'t have to add any rules to do this. The
*existing* rules for particle interactions do it on their own.

The trick is that your "path" to the past has to not only let your
"wave function" get at wave functions in the past, but it has to let
their wave functions get at the future. 

For example, certain types of wormholes that *could* allow time travel
turn out to be ruled out because as soon as you get them configured
right, the particle pairs that make up the "vacuum energy" will create
a feedback loop thru the wormhole, which increases until it colapses.

You are describing "serial universes", and as such, it\'s not time
travel *at all*. The big catch is that there\'s no requirement for them
to be identical. 

And since they *are* different universe, it really doesn\'t matter much
what you can or can\'t do.

Now consider the "fun" with *real* time travel.

You get visited by some guy who looks a lot like you but is babbling
about being from the future. He fails to convince you and you throw him
out. He gets struck by a car and killed as he\'s leaving.

The autopsy gets the authorities *very* interested. He\'s got your
fingerprints, DNA, etc. They start a crash program.

Some years later they get a working unit, and after some careful tests
*sending probes and people back to places where they won\'t be noticed,
they tell you that you are going to be sent back. 

You, of course, want no part of this, as you rem,ember what happened to
the future you. But all your efforts *will* be in vain. Because the
wave function only has one possible outcome. You go back, and die. All
other "possibilities" have a probability of *zero*, while anything that
gets you into the machine has a high probability. 

It\'s sort of like the Bell inequality experiments. While a naive
research would say that the chances of measuring the test value are
50-50, in actuality, they are 100-0. If you test for A and the other
particle (far removed) is tested for B, you get *the* answer. If you
test for A, you don\'t get a result. 

The events are linked *instanteously*. You can\'t fool mother nature.

Only trouble is, we have already established that microjumps *are*
used. That was discussed extensively during the summer, when we were
trying to work out the parameters for "safe" manuever drives.

This is not a *chase* scenario. This is system defense dispatching an
interceptor squadron after a bogey that has jumped insystem, using the
"micro" jumps we disagree about.

Also, at least in year zero, guessing the destination system is rather
easy. For a J-1 ship there are only 6 possibilities, and most of those
are empty hexes. Also, for piracy, you likely *know* which hex is being
jumped to from the same source that told you the ship was carrying
valuable cargo!

And if he has buddies in the destination system, he jumps in, beams
them the sensor data on the other ship\'s jump, and they can run it
through a big computer on the ground and be hanging around the most
likely spots at the most likely times.

Hey, it doesn\'t say that in the Starship Op Manual, but, I must say, this is the first 
time the one-week-in-jump-space system has made ANY sense.  I like that idea.  Good job! 
 But, have I been totally convinced?  In a word, No.

I\'ve got to hand it to you.  This is another really great idea.  (he thinks) Yeah, I 
might use this in my campaign.

Do you know what I just love about your idea?  It really makes sense, and it answers 
something about my system.  I was waiting for somebody to say, "OK Mr. Hot Shot.  We 
can\'t explain why cannon states that ships must be in jumpspace no-matter-what, but why 
don\'t you tell us why you think the ships should be in there for shorter periods."  And, 
for that, I had no answer other than to say, "It makes better sense to me."

Ya know, Glenn.  We may have just seen the end of this thread.  I am completely happy 
now.  In the cannon universe, the materials (or the technology is not there) are just 
not available to cool the jump grid in less than one week.  The cooling system is 
working overtime to do the job in one week as it is.  In my version of the universe, 
we\'ve just made some sort of minor advancement in the area of cooling technology.  Both 
systems can logically exist in the same universe!  (This would be great in a future IG 
supplement showing expanding technology in one of the milieus)

Damn, Glenn.  This idea is just brilliant.  Kudos to you!  The more I think about it, 
the more I lose my problem with cannon.  I always like to stay with cannon unless I have 
a big problem, and you have just solved my big problem.

This is what I love about this mail list.  You through an idea out there.  It gets 
tossed around a bit.  And, sometimes, you walk away with a better idea than you had 
going in.  This was exactly what I was looking for, and, I must say, your post is the 
best one I have ever read.  

Now, let\'s see if we can come up with as good of an idea to fix the task system.

   Which is what I *said*, but that doesn\'t prove, as you seem to think, that
there is no God.  Saying \'A\' (any given statement of supposed truth) but not
offering definative proof of \'A\' does not logically mean \'Not A\', no matter
what \'A\'  happens to be.

   There is what is true (reality), then there is what is *perceived* to be
true.  You may perceive yourself to be Pharaoh, but our society (assuming
that you can\'t come up with any evidence to prove your claim) would probably
hold a different opinion.  Whether or not your statement is *correct* is an
entirely seperate issue.

>Only conclusive proof can make a fact.  Therefore, the existence of 
>God is not a fact because there is no conclusive proof supporting the claim.

   Lack of proof for any given statement \'A\' doesn\'t prove \'Not A\'.  I can
make the statement, "you are wearing boxer shorts", and if you are unwilling
to provide proof one way or the other, that doesn\'t mean you couldn\'t
possibly be wearing them.

>  Lack of conclusive proof is OK for opinions though, so you can be 
>of the *opinion* that God exists.  (Claiming opinion to be fact based 
>on lack of disproof is what I\'m really opposed to.) 

   Since we cannot know the trueness or the falseness of the statement "there
is a Supreme Being", then your assertion that there is no God is equally as
valid as John Paul II\'s belief (presumably) that there is.

   My other *point* was that whether or not you believe there is a God, your
decision ultimately has to be based on something other than cold, calculated
logic.  That is where faith comes in--faith that there is a God, faith that
there is not a God.

> Hey, I\'m compromising!  

   If you mean you are more comfortable using the word "opinion" rather than
"faith", and then want to think of that as a compromise, then please do so.

>Let\'s be nice!

   Better idea.  We are solving even less here than the people who were
arguing over relativistic rocks, and at least that was more or less on topic.

>Anybody want to join the Howard Hale Fan Club? ; )

   Not funny.

Actually, Leonard, I don\'t think my system will effect combat the way you 
are saying.  I have a lot to say to defend my system against your 
comments, but, because of Glenn\'s incredible post, I am now a believer.  
My comments have become moot.

You are arguing game mechanics.  What I was looking for is for someone to 
give me an acceptible explanation why time in jump space requires one 
week.  You\'re basically saying that it is because "Pearl Harbor attacks 
are not possible under my system" (and I totally disagree with that).  

Read Glenn\'s post.  He directly addresses why time in jumpspace takes so 
long--and is constant for each type of j-drive.  He doesn\'t say, "It\'s 
because it interferes with combat", or "It screws up the 
communication/economic system basic to Traveller", or even "That it makes 
jump-1 ships sitting ducks."  What he addresses is the technology, and he 
did it so well that I--firmly entrenched with the idea that the 
one-week-no-matter-what system was completely arbritary--am forced to 
agree with him.

It looks like I lost this one, but I\'m glad I did.  It may not seem so, 
but I actually like the cannon--I just want it to make sense.

Thanks for the effort, though.

Well I think they would mention something like the Spiri being a minor
race. Also they don\'t mention in POT, when any of the other major
worlds were settled.
Anyway, we have had this discussion before, and I think we can agree to
disagree here.

Well Brian (my player) and I thought Spires sounded like a relativity new 
planet, mainly because of the lack of fossil fuels.  So we came up with
the volcanoes, and the obsidian.  And since Spires had a tainted
atmosphere. it seemed to be logical to make it all connected. I threw
in the smell at the last moment, as I was writing it up.

I thought that they meant that there were no metals in the crust of the
planet, so you would have to dig huge mile long tunnels to get to any
metals that are in the upper mantle.  

I\'d love to hear any more comments you or anyone else has. (Hint Hint Hint) :)

Please note that there is strong evidence that humans, chimps, and

 "Better read the papers physics types are writing. Because that\'s
  *exactly* what they suggest. If time travel is possible, it
  *immediately* restricts available actions in certain circumstances,
  because otherwise, it\'d be possible to create various nasty problems.
  The odd thing is that they didn\'t have to add any rules to do this. The
  *existing* rules for particle interactions do it on their own."

I knew Kip Thorne and that lot would catch up with us gamers eventually. (-:

 "Now consider the "fun" with *real* time travel.
  ...
 "You, of course, want no part of this, as you rem,ember what happened to
  the future you. But all your efforts *will* be in vain. Because the
  wave function only has one possible outcome. You go back, and die. All
  other "possibilities" have a probability of *zero*, while anything that
  gets you into the machine has a high probability."

Just as our in-house name for paradox-prevention is "timelock," our 
name for this kind of thing is "fating."  Typically, our PCs *hate* to 
learn about their personal futures, because even if they don\'t learn 
anything unpleasant, you get this nasty constricted feeling about upcoming
events.  Besides, if someone *starts* to tell you the future, you never 
know how it\'s going to turn out until it\'s too late.

There is a possible way around this.  Sometimes.  If you\'re lucky and 
industrious.  I call it "causal substitution."  The way you\'d do it 
in the example given is to heartlessly commision a clone, give him the 
proper education, and throw him to the time-travel researchers, who 
mistake him for you.  In fact *he* mistakes himself for you, and thus 
proclaims himself as you when you meet, or met.  Then he dies in your 
place.  Or rather, it was always him who died, rather than you.

Not very moral, in this case.  Maybe there\'s a better dodge.  Perhaps 
you could go time-traveling yourself and bribe the coroners to give 
false testimony about your dead "self\'s" DNA, having thoughtfully bought 
a life-like replica robot, suitably programmed, sent back in your place, 
etc.

The nub is that the events that happened, happened.  You can just try 
to embroider the context of the events to make them mean something else.
It\'s very tricky and usually doesn\'t work.  But it illustrates the 
adventure possibilities of immutable-time-travel.

Jerry, 

I always have something for the engineer to do, but I like this all-important task as 
well.  I think Glenn\'s comments were stupendous.

FYI, if you need more for your engineers to do, there is something in TNE that I use as 
a guide.  Each TNE ship has a listed amount of weekly hours required to keep up 
maintenance.  For example, the subsidized merchant requires 180 hrs.  On our ship (in my 
campaign), the chief engineer is in charge of the maintenance crew.  We\'ve got four of 
the crew members on this maintenance detail--each putting in about 45 hrs a week.  

Our pilot, for instance, has virutally nothing to do in jump space, but he is also our 
chief mechanic.  His job in jump space is to fix, troubleshoot, and maintain all of the 
mechanical devices aboard ship.  He puts in 8-10 hrs a day, while in jump space, doing 
these types of tasks.  

Another thing that this is useful for is to calculate the number of free time a 
character has aboard ship.  A player might say, "I want to start studing Navigation so 
that my character can get a skill in it.  Let\'s see, that\'s one and two and six weeks 
that we\'ve been in jumpspace over the last couple of months.  That should be six weeks 
worth of time that my character has had to study."

Not so, I say.  Your character was indeed in jump space, but you are also the 
pilot/chief mechanic.  You spend 45 hrs a week, while in jump space, taking care of all 
things mechanical.  You need to sleep 5 to 8 hrs a day as well, so, if you used all of 
your free time (which is highly unlikely--people need recreation time is a requirement 
in my book) studying, you\'ve only racked up 36 hrs in that six weeks actually studying 
navigation.

It\'s just a suggestion,

Kenneth.

A "typical" star will move about 1/10000th the speed of light relative
to its neighbors. This means that it would take this star 10000 years to
move one lightyear, or thirty thousand years to move a parsec.

A relatively quick star might move about ten times faster, moving a parsec
(relative to its neighbors) in 3000 years. (See Appendix 13 of Abell,
4th Ed.)

Really unusual stars may move even faster.

Over the course of 1000 years, I\'d be surprised if more than 5% of the
stars shifted by as much as one hex. And that counts stars that are near
"hex boundaries" and cross over.

I\'m not saying that the engineers need more to do.  Heavens there\'s
enough for them to do on a ship.  I am saying that I like what TNE did
by not making the j-drive just a piece of metal that did nothing during
jump.  I\'m not saying the engineer needs to sit around it 24-7, but I am
saying it\'s a system like any other that should be looked over once a
shift/day/etc...

 Instead of trying to confuse yourself (you can, if you want,
 but...), why not just email it to me at the Freelance Traveller
 address - that way, I\'ll look at it, correct it for spelling
 and grammar, and add it, under your name, to Freelance
 Traveller, where lots of people can read it, and make the
 concept more successful.

 The Freelance Traveller address is jeff.zeitlin@earth.execnet.com
 for mail, and http://www.dragonfire.net/~FreelanceTraveller/
 for looking at the actual web pages.

 (It\'s really not all that complicated to set up a web page, or
 to upload to one that permits it, but I want to drum up some
 business...)

 6.  A variant of the Annic Nova adventure.  As soon as I can
 find my copy, if this thread is still going, I\'ll post some
 conversion notes.

 7.  (a mixture of recognizable and strange tech inside)  It\'s
 an experimental concept model being worked on by a megacorp -
 but it\'s a failure.  All of the previous attempts misjumped;
 this is the only one that misjumped to where it could be found.
 Worse, all six attempts were crewed (two or three at the most);
 there is no sign of anyone aboard (Andrea Doria syndrome?).
 When this ship disappeared, the corp terminated the project and
 destroyed all the notes (if they kept them, they would be
 evidence of severe violations of Sylean Federal/Imperial laws).

 8.  (no strange tech visible - except for the hull itself)
 Upon boarding, no life is found - not even microbial.
 Examination of the Master\'s Safe and the computer reveal that
 it is a quite ordinary Imperial/Sylean Federation-registered
 ship, with a Jump-2 drive - and indeed it is, except for the
 unusual hull.  A check of records will reveal that the ship
 filed a "flight plan" between two planets Jump-1 apart on the
 Sylean main, both of which are at least seven parsecs away.
 The ship had been due to arrive at its destination within a
 couple of days of its being found.

 For 7 and 8, obviously the players involvement is either as
 finders or investigators.  Complications ensue due to the
 assumed high risk of attempting to jump, and trying to figure
 out _why_ the ship exists in its present form.

 In both 7 and 8, if the players find the ship, they now have a
 dilemma - how do they account for the fact that there\'s no life
 aboard?  If they report it, they just might be suspected of
 being the cause of the lack of life aboard...

T::>So, what do all of you think about this?

 I think you made a minor goof here - while the math is correct,
 you misdefined the task.  It\'s really several tasks:

 (1)  locate and identify the computer.  If it\'s alien, it may
      not look like what they expect a computer to look like.
      Even if it does, there may not be enough to identify.

 (2)  determine if it appears to be intact enough to be
      functional, or at least that there is enough left to be
      able to reconstruct it and decipher the architecture.

 (2a) reconstruct, if sufficient pieces in acceptable condition
      are available.

 (3)  decipher the architecture.  This includes identifying
      control channels and ports (or their equivalent), which
      may mean that you have to spend a lot of time doing with
      that ship/station what the NTSB has been doing with the
      pieces of TWA800.

 (4)  Get the computer working, or simulate it on your own
      computers.

 (4a) Interface the alien mass storage units to your computer,
      so you can examine the alien software and data.

 (5)  Identify alien programs.  This task needs to be dealt with
      separately for each program, but related programs can be
      made progressively easier as earlier program are
      identified.

 (6)  Correlate alien data from programs with your own data.

 (7)  Apply information learned from correlations to further
      iterations of steps 5 and 6.

 Even for one program, with a 50% success rate, you\'re dealing
 with 7 to 9 rolls - at best (7 tasks), a predicted success rate
 of one in 128, or less than one percent.  Also, any of these
 tasks can also have DMs - for example, it\'d be a lot harder to
 succeed at 3 if 2a fails or is unavailable.

 The virtue of a complex task system such as TNE or T4 is that
 it allows customization of a character\'s ability to accomplish
 something to a greater extent than the CT "8+ with DMs" method.

 The pitfall is in defining the tasks.  Defining too broad a
 task on something can lead to improbable probabilities, like
 the original example.

 I think it would have been a good idea to have said this in the
 T4 task rules.  I may do a more extensive/more formal write up
 for Freelance Traveller.

I\'m actually curious about the problems with Traveller\'s Meson gun since
I don\'t really know enough physics to predict meson behavior.

On a related note, technology in Traveller comes in two flavors.  That
which is predicted by current scientific knowledge, such as lasers,
fusion power, gauss weapons, etc...  These are all based on principles
that we currently understand even if we can\'t make use of them yet.
The other category is that which has no explanation given our current
understanding.  Thrust plates, jump drives, and contragravity all fall
into this category.  The behavior of these technologies is going to be
arbirtrary.  In the Traveller universe, the nature of the Imperium
and galactic civilization is tied to the way these work.  Now only
Marc Miller knows which came first, his view of the technology or
his view of the society.  Regardless, any variation of jump drives,
thrust plates, or contragravity is equally valid as far as we know.
If you like, you can make up a story to explain how they work, using
J-space, warps in the space-time continuim, currently unknown particles,
etc...  These theories don\'t need to be defended and can\'t be attacked,
except where they are internally inconsistent or conflict with our
current knowledge.

Okay... I\'ll stop now.

Sorry, have to disagree with you both there, you aren\'t terribly current on
your relatavistic cosmology...

http://www3.edgenet.net/jrk/physics/Time_Travel.html

and

http://www3.edgenet.net/jrk/physics/index.html


these are good URL\'s full of links to relatavistic cosmology on time travel,
and 
here are some excerpts from the "Everything you always wanted to know about Time
Travel" links...

From, Is Time Travel Possible? by John and Mary Gribbin

"And all this, it is worth spelling out, has been published by serious
scientists in respectable journals such as Physical Review Letters (you
don\'t believe us? check out volume 61, page 1446)." 

"So how do you get around the paradoxes? The scientists have an
answer to that, too. It\'s obvious, when you think about it; all you have
to do is add in a judicious contribution from quantum theory to the time
travelling allowed by relativity theory. As long as you are an expert in
both theories, you can find a way to avoid the paradoxes.

It works like this. According to one interpretation of quantum
physics (there are several interpretations, and nobody knows which
one, if any, is "right"), every time a quantum object, such as an
electron, is faced with a choice, the world divides to allow it to take
every possibility on offer. In the simplest example, the electron may
be faced with a wall containing two holes, so that it must go through
one hole or the other. The Universe splits so that in one version of
reality -- one set of relative dimensions -- it goes through the hole on
the left, while in the other it goes through the hole on the right.
Pushed to its limits, this interpretation says that the Universe is
split into infinitely many copies of itself, variations on a basic theme,
in which all possible outcomes of all possible "experiments" must
happen somewhere in the "multiverse". So there is, for example, a
Universe in which the Labour Party has been in power for 15 years, and
is now under threat from a resurgent Tory Party led by vibrant young
John Major.

How does this resolve the paradoxes? Like this. Suppose someone
did go back in time to murder their granny when she was a little girl. 
On this multiverse picture, they have slid back to a bifurcation point in
history. After killing granny, they move forward in time, but up a
different branch of the multiverse. In this branch of reality, they were
never born; but there is no paradox, because in he universe next door
granny is alive and well, so the murderer is born, and goes back in time
to commit the foul deed!

But this idea of parallel universes and alternative histories as a solution
to the time travel
paradoxes is also now being taken seriously by some (admittedly, not many)
researchers, including David Deutsch, in Oxford. Their research deals with
both time, and relative dimensions in space. You could make a nice acronym
for that -- TARDIS, perhaps?"

represented in traveller.  According to my theory:

Think of Jumpspace as a fluid inside a large globe.  You are at the globes
center in realspace. As with the ocean the fluid is divided into levels.
Each level having its own characteristic Density.  Closest to the core of
the globe is Jump-1.  While it is most easily entered it is also the slowest
medium to travel due to \'density\'.  Each level is seperated from the other
by a thermoclime or an energy threshold that must be met to surpase it and
enter the next higher level.  

In addition every point (probably gravity wells) in real space has a
correspondig point in JumpSpace in the proper level.  All things being
relative: all the objects at 1 parsec distance are at level one.  Objects at
6 parsecs are at level 6 and so on ...  Keeping with the sphere idea all
points within each level are equidistant.  Thus with a fixed density and
distance no matter the jump capability all points will take 4 to 7 days to
reach.  

For instance a Jump-6 ship decides to jump to a planet only 3 parsecs away.
Even though it has a jump-6 the only way to reach that planet from its
current position is to enter level 3.  Once in level three the ship heads to
the planet.  Since \'density\' of the level is fixed (one must allow for
current thus the random amount of time it takes) the ship will still take
the 1 week.  
Now take the same ship.  They decide to jump to a planet 6 parsecs away.
They enter level 6 by pumping the required energy to the engines and...
Inside level 6 all planets 6 parsecs away are equidistant and the fixed
density requires 1 week. 

IMHO 8-P

Any thoughts? Please share them.

Jeff, I think that you are missing my point here.  I only gave the example of play to 
illustrate my point further.  In reality, the players decided not to go to the alien 
ship to find information in favor of saving time and speeding to the station to save any 
survivors.

I guess I could have said:  Given that you are on a piece of an exploded alien ship, and 
that you have found an intact computer core, and you have all the equipment, etc, 
etc...your chance of gaining information from that computer core is governed by an 
Impossible task throw.

You are not seeing the forest for the trees here.  As a GM, I realized the we are going 
to have problems down the road if a character, with pretty good, but not incredible, 
skills can make an Impossible throw 44% of the time.  There is definitely a problem with 
the task system here--regardless of the actual encounter that I used to illustrate it.

Besides, there will be times when only one Impossible task throw is called for instead 
of a situation where you can cheat the odds by making the character make multiple task 
throws.  When this situation comes up, I want an Impossible task to be nearly 
impossible--not closer to average.

Sincerely,

Kenneth.

PS 
BTW, I really like what you are doing with Freelance Traveller.  We need more people 
like yourself.  Maybe I\'ll send something in, and maybe we can post this new task system 
when we all, here on TML, get it hacked out.

A second thing that arose from the SPI debacle: I *never* subscribe to a magazine. If I 
want to buy a game magazine, I ask my Friendly Local Game Store Owner to fetch it for 
me.

That black box with white lettering and a tasteful red stripe made the packaging of the 
original edition of DND look _sick_. Lotsa good memories associated with that tasteful 
game box . . . .

I\'ll have to see _La Femme Nikita_ . . . .Maybe seeing that flick will get that damned 
song from _That Thing You Do!_ out of my head. Sophia wanted to see it yesterday, and 
her Dadster delivered.

Hmmm . . . all the sf flicks you list make my list, as does _The African Queen_. I\'d add 
_Eating Raoul_, _El Cid_, _Exodus_ (the theme and opening title sequence brings tears to 
my eyes), _The Dirty Dozen_, _The Green Berets_, _Patton_, _Monty Python and the Holy 
Grail_, _Ran_(Kurosarwa meets _King Lear_), _Same Time Next Year_, the Dirty Harry 
movies _Sudden Impact_ and _The Enforcer_, and _Henry V_ (with Kenneth Branaugh).

This is crap. In my games, only a truly brutal and twisted NPC would commit rape as an 
"on-stage" event, and then, I\'d give the victim a chance to fight back. I\'ve _never_ had 
a NPC villain gratituously rape a PC. OTOH, putting a rape in a character 
background -- as I did with Gwen, my favorite T4 NPC -- is a good character-building 
device and it gives her a good reason to avoid romantic situations.

Sounds like Gwen, all right. She\'s the first non-grunt Trav character I\'ve ever enjoyed 
playing.

I\'m weak on playing aliens. In my RC game, I ran a number of Ithklur and a few Hivers, 
and I had a hard time individualizing them. I have an all-human party in my current T4 
game; I\'m going to toss a Vargr corsair into the game just to give me practice (and to 
add variety to the Despot of Ardis\' pirate fleet . . . )

I have a great real-life female friend upon whom to model a female character who has 
been abused: my friend was abused sometime in her past (I\'ve never pressed her for 
details). She is not murderous, but she expresses a fascination for guns, explosives, 
knives and other weapons that can only be described as prodigal. Further, she has a 
tremendous willingness to use such weapons, for-real. Nice to have a female friend who 
knows a double-tap from a Weaver stance ;)

Well, when the sacred text of the dominant local religion says "suffer not a witch to 
live," and you _are_ a Witch, and associate with other Witches, and representitives of 
the dominant local religion hold frequent "seminars" to denounce you and yours (the 
latest seminar -- "Cult Classics" -- just in time for Samhain), you simply can\'t be too 
careful. In my community, people who are "different" -- gays, bohemians, the homeless 
and the occasional Pagan -- are targeted for physical assault, usually by teens. I 
remember talking to one young Christian of 15 who told me he wanted nothing more than to 
"stomp a f%gg&t." Chilling. I wonder what he\'d do to a real-live Witch. The local Media 
run their annual Samhain scare-stories . . . .

Maybe I\'m paranoid . . . but I\'d rather be a live paranoid than reckless and dead.

THAT does it! After all this GREAT off-topic religious discussion, I\'m going to enact 
the Ritual of Horse-Slaying By Blunt Trauma to return us to the Realm of Topicality.

I remember an article where a game publisher said that he expects to see at least one 
typo on his tombstone . . . and I well-remember a goof I made in one of my Renagade 
Legion articles in _Challenge_. I referred to the RL supplement "The 2nd ACR" as "The

Well, I\'m just _very careful_. Maybe my local area is a net loser in the racial brain 
cell distribution sweepstakes. If things don\'t get any better (and with **the 
Millenium** coming, I\'m not very positive), I\'m leaving for a More Tolerant area.

Pensacola is a college town and hosts a military base. Lodi isn\'t a college town nor is 
there a substantial military presence -- closest facility is Travis AFB in Fairfield 
with the shutdowns of McClellan, Mather, and the Sacramento Army Depot.

Pentagrams? Cat killings? Ugh! Responsible pagans can work with the police; the violence 
 smears them badly.

Hmmm . . . there are virtually _no_ African Americans here (but a substantial number in 
nearby Stockton) and thus no church burnings. Abortion violence? No clinic here, and the 
cops cover the one in Stockton like a blanket. Protests? I\'ve seen several Sunday 
sign-waving rallys along the main drag. The minority community here is mostly Latino 
with a mix of Indians, Pakistanis and Sikhs.

Most of the bigotry I\'ve experienced directly is the tacit kind that happens when a 
group of white males (I\'m one) gather, and several of them start spouting off about 
immigration or some other hot button topic. Sooner or later, the issue of race comes up 
and the bigotry comes out. I\'ve experienced this directly, and I\'ve overheard similar 
behavior in public gathering places.

Some of what I hear is downright scary -- hunt down and deport \'em all, kill \'em if they 
resist . . . and I have to wonder what they\'d do to a person when their religion gives 
them a tacit go-ahead. Given what medieval Crusaders did to Moslems and Jews, I have to 
err on the side of caution.

I _like_ to improvise. In my TNE game, I ran a lot of _Challenge_ scenarios as well as 
many of those from _Smash and Grab_. The more vague the scenario, the more fun I had 
tossing unprogrammed encounters at the party or sticking in a variety of nasty surprises 
("I _know_ the scenario says those TED troops are Tech 6 . . . this platoon has Tech-8 
gear. Now shut up while I roll where that HEAP RAM grenade hit you . . .). In my T4 
game, I basically improvised the Despot of Ardis. I started with the UPP for Ardis, made 
the gov type a charismatic dictator, with the CD a former Sylean naval officer with a 
hate-on for Cleon. I further presume that NOBODY has the resources yet to build large 
starships as of Year 0. The yards can handle ships the size of the designs listed in T4, 
and only a few that are larger than the standard designs. A tech 12 _Midi Ashguum_ is 
the equivalent of a battleship; the 400-ton patrol cruiser is the common jump-capable 
combatant; like a WW2 Fletcher-class tin can, the PCs also escorts the pride of the 
Imperial fleet: 3000-ton carriers armed with fighters. This is consistant with what T4 
says about the fighter: "The fighter is the Imperium\'s greatest advantage against other 
races."

The Ardin\'s (a resident of Ardis is an Ardin) advantage is a ruthlessly centralized 
economy where slackers are shot. Their yard production rates are higher, but due to a 
smaller pop base, they fly fewer fighters. Ardis also has a pirate\'s haven tradition 
dating back to the Vilini Imperium, the Port Royale of the entire sector

When I see larger vessels in _Starships_, I\'ll add them to the Imperial or the Ardin 
inventory.

I give my players about three to five minutes "on-stage" time to describe what the PCs 
are doing. If players don\'t want to roleplay a few hands of cards (use that Gambling 
skill . . . or LEARN it) or talking to that attractive person or alien from Steteroom 3, 
then I don\'t give out helpful rumors or allow the PCs to make useful friends that might 
just help out down the road.

What I **do not** want to hear is that a character spent the entire week "working out 
with my brawling skill/shooting my laser in the indoor tange/doing anything that takes 
an inordinate amount of dedication." You\'re spending a week with OTHER PEOPLE -- deal 
with \'em or suffer the rep of someone who is unsocialbe and a possible liability to the 
team groundside.

I, too, have found all of Leonard\'s posts to be interesting, and I have agreed with a 
lot of them myself.  As a matter of fact, I have his post on fixing the task system 
printed out for use in finding a system I like.

I can\'t agree with you here.  This is what this mail list is all about.  Otherwise, 
someone would write a post, everyone would agree, and that would be that.

I also don\'t agree with the basis of what you are saying.  I don\'t buy that the 
no-matter-what jump system should be believed just because.  I want to see some support 
for the idea.

I\'ve gotten all types of answers to my question.  You say that the cannon jumpspace 
system can\'t be attacked--it just needs to be accepted.  Leonard, among many things, 
said that the jumpspace system cannot be changed because no Pearl Harbor attacks could 
be allowed.  Others have said that the system cannot be changed because it would change 
the communication and economic situation unique to Traveller (which it would not).

All of these answers do not address the question--why does it take a week in jump space 
no matter what jump you are making.  

There has been no answer to this until...

I read Glenn\'s post.  He actually addressed the question.  Basically, he said that it is 
a deficite in technical knowledge that causes the one-week system.  The hull grid gets 
so hot that, by current standards, the fastest that they can be cooled down is in one 
week.  In other words, we could come out of jump space quicker if we could figure out a 
way to use better materials and technology.

This explains long time misjumps (we\'re having a problem cooling the grid!).  This 
explains my system (we\'ve found a new, better material for the grid that will actually 
cool faster!).  And this supports cannon (we can\'t cool the damn thing down any faster 
than one week).  IG could even use this in future supplements if they wanted to shake 
the universe by introducing new technology with "faster" jump drives.

Believe it or not, I actually want to support cannon.  The jump space thing has always 
bugged me since I first picked the game up.  And I gotta tell ya, I was a staunch 
defender of my system, but Glenn has made a great point.  

I have to conceed, and I\'m changing my system back to cannon after 14 years.

Regards,

Kenneth.

What follows is one ref\'s answer -- MINE!

Uncle Rich\'s Guide to Life In J-space:


CREW:

Crew-beings have two major responsibilities:

	1. Watch-standing
	2. Maintenance

Watches: Every crewbeing stands watches and/or is "on-call" during jump. The 
Captain/Chief pilot and Engineer fall into the latter category.
Every ship has at least two stations that must be manned in J-space -- the bridge and 
main engineering. Long tradition and Imperial safety regs require that a sophont being 
be at the main engineering and pilot workstations during jump. Tradition -- this 
comes from the nautical tradition that the bridge is never left unmanned. Safety -- 
physically occupying the bridge is a security (anti-hijack) measure on traders as 
well as a flight-safety issue. Ships can drop out of jump prematurely; computer control 
of the jump field is a twitchy business  even at TL-14+.

Maintenance: Every crewbeing\'s life depends upon the proper functioning of the 
starship\'s drive, fuel, and lifesupport equipment. You cannot do enough maintenance on a 
piece of equipment if by doing so increases your chance of survival. 


On small ships like free traders/far traders, the steward is on-call to all passengers 
in the event of a medical emergancy and to all high passengers at all times. Stewards do 
not stand watches. Everyone else stands 6-12 hour watches and pulls 6 hrs of maintenance 
 per day. Small ships tend to have high crew fatigue . . . but blowing off stress is 
what startowns are for, right?

As simple and elegant as possible. Best case would be a single roll with
only two dice. Personally, I dislike the idea of rolling 3, 4, 5, even 6
dice just to determine task resolution. Half dice are undesirable as well.

As few as possible. Preferably none.

Again, as few as possible, but some are always going to be necessary. Best
would be a system that allows players to predetermine the roll mods for
each of their skills. Worse is something that needs to be re-calculated for
every situation.

Of course. Anything else should be shot with a canon. :)
Besides, I threw out all my old D&D stuff a decade ago. I wouldn\'t want to
have to buy another set of bloody polyhedrals!

I think the base should be determined by the Difficulty level, then
modified by skills and (to a lesser extent) characteristics.

As regular as possible: the progressions in the T4 system seem rather
arbitrary and irregular, which makes it hard to for the ref to gauge the
Difficulty. For instance, for a PC with stat+skill of 9, there\'s only a
slight difference between "Staggering" and "Impossible".

It would seem difficult or even impossible to come up with a system which
succeeds in combining all of the above. But.... I think I might have an
idea for such a system. It\'s still embryonic thus far, but I think I can
get it to work. It will require a bit of mathematical fiddling to begin
with, but the rolls themselves will be very simple: a throw of two dice,
D6s only, no D3s, no charts or tables to consult (I hope), and a highly
regular probability progression by Difficulty and Skill. Stats will mean
less than Skills. 

Sound nice? Well, I can\'t guarantee anything. Will post more here when I\'ve
either elimated the bugs or thrown up my hands at the problem.

More anon,

Glenn

Keep to one table if at possible.  If math is required,
addition/subtraction would be simplest (depending on the formula).

I favor D100s or D20s.

Skill levels modified *somewhat* by characteristics.

How about allowing a situation to modify the target number? For example,
a certain lock reduces an Intrusion roll by 5% (1 on D20) or a field of
slightly soft earth reduces Stealth by 10% (2 on a D20)? D100s allow the
most flexibility.

With the schema in #4, this is unnecessary.

Same answer as 5)

Although I expect most to fend off the above, I\'ve run RuneQuest for a
number of years and the above system (a D100) works very well because of
its simplicity and flexibility. Of course, it\'s copyrighted which why I
also suggested a D20.

Here\'s a new resource for our previously discussed Traveller 1965 
scenarios. I\'m in the process of reading Robert Zubrin\'s (co-written with 
Richard Wagner) The Case for Mars (Free Press, ISBN 0-684-82757-3, $25.00 
US). Zubrin describes a relatively "low cost" (when compared to some 
plans floated by NASA) process of getting to Mars that definately has a 
Von Braun/Bonestell/Ley flavor to me. 

I would also like to recommend Buzz Aldrin and John Barnes\' Encounter 
With Tiber (Warner Aspect, ISBN 0-446-51854-9, $21.95 US). The story 
revolves around the discovery of traces of alien presences on Alpha 
Centauri, the Moon and Mars. The book alternates between the point of 
view of a historian on the first interstellar (STL) ship, the aliens (in 
the distant past) and a revived space program going to the Moon and then 
to Mars to recover alien artifacts. The revived space program proposes 
some fairly nifty items--such as a modified "Apollo II" command module 
ship to go to the Moon.

Both have some Traveller 1965 possibilities and are on my reading list 
for this project...

I forgive you, but since my starships use the canon "one week,
regardless of jump length" I can send a courier to call off the attack
on your home system. 

Hope you like relativistic rocks, falling comets, and the other
nasties. (Even bought a second hand stellar flare inducer from the

I didn\'t attack *you*, though that may have been implied by comments
about certain holes in your arguments.

And any "conflict" is a result of misunderstanding my position.

You only just figured out that I play devils advocate?

My "position" is that the rules need to be consistent, both with
themselves, and with the real world. And that the rules should describe
how things work, as in "you do this, this and this, and that happens"
rather than try to come up with explanations of why. Especially since
explanations of "why" are far more likely to get trashed as we learn
more about the universe. 

As an example, if the thruster plates were described as using magnetic
monopoles, and then monopoles were actually discovered and found to
have properties that make the explanation impossible, then the game
seems silly (just like a lot of old SF that seems silly for having
obsolete science). But if they are instead described in terms of
putting in so much energy for a given thrust, then all we can do is
list things that they *can\'t* be using.

I did. You just didn\'t notice. :-)

I accept no responsibility for people who don\'t realize that the point
I\'m arguing isn\'t the one they think I\'m arguing.

Nah, I\'ll just consider the source. :-)

Seriously, any "digs" above are meant as friendly ribbing, not actual
attacks. But I *am* serious when I say that several of the failing you
point out are due to you making *incorrect* assumptions as to what my
point was.

<Much snipping of details and well-deserved kudos>

Not to put a damper on the ole nuke warhead with pithy details but the
grid is made of lanthanum. The zuchai crystals are used as an energy
sink to contain the initial charge used to "boost" the tumble into
Jumpspace. I consider this, however, to be absolutely irrelevant to the
theory stated above. After all, at what rate does lanthanum radiate heat
in Jumpspace?

However, I thought a jump drive was nothing more than a fusion reactor
which ran constantly while in Jumpspace to maintain the jump field. Is
this documented anyway (I can\'t recall)? If not, you have another
convert.

The second table was fine, except for the fact that on 2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4 D
rolls, the low to Hit numbers that are marked with 0.00 should actually be
the same as the lowest number because of the automatic success rule.  That
is, If my to hit number is a 3, and I am rolling 4D6, I will succeed if I
roll a 4 (ie four ones) even though it is over the to hit number.  Here is
the old and the new section...

I think that is all.  If I\'m in error somewhere, someone please let me know.
BTW, anyone who wants a Microsoft Excell Spreadsheet with the second table
from above with .5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, and 6 Die percentages
entered in to the nearest hundreth, I should have it done tomorrow.  Let me

that we are working on several product lines that may be of interest to you.
More to the point, we are actively seeking authors for books to be published
in these lines. The lines are listed below.

  We have an agreement with Imperium Games to produce licensed Traveller 4th
Edition products. We are looking for authors, primarily for adventure
anthologies (each adventure being 8,000-10,000 words). We are planning to
release the first of our T4 books next spring to be followed by additional
books through the year.

  We also publish a line of adventure books for use with the Hero System,
called Heroic Adventures. Each volume consists of several adventures for a
specific genre (HA1 was for Champions, HA2 for Dark Champions, HA3 will be
for Fantasy Hero, etc.). Adventures should be 8,000 to 10,000 words, and we
are looking for additional Champions and Dark Champions adventures.

  Lastly, we are working on a new roleplaying game set in feudal Japan,
called Sengoku: Chambara Roleplaying in Feudal Japan. Sengoku will use the
new Fuzion game system (by Hero Games and R. Talsorian), expanded with a
number of genre-specific rules. We have a number of supplements planned which
are, as of yet, not assigned an author. If you have an interest in the genre,
drop us a line.

  Propsective authors should download our current submission guidelines from
our web page at http://members.aol.com/goldrushg/index.htm.

Can we all say "Leviathan"?  I\'m waiting for Starships to arrive at my FLGS
to do a TL-12 version of the old girl, but this is just the type of ship
that would be favored for those long exploratory trade missions.

The IISS would probably order a few to serve as Exploration Crusiers, since
you can stock the cargo bay with all the survey equpment you need.  I could
even see one or two Levi\'s being used as mobile Scout command/repair ships;
serving the Type S ships doing the local area and following up on
interesting finds.

I know how this one happened (I screwed up, and didn\'t even consider 
that), but how the D4 column errors happened is a mystery to me.  All 
four columns were generated using the same (home-brewed) program.  If 
one column was in error, they should all have been.  Maybe something 
happened in the translation from program output to spreadsheet.  

Thanks for catching those errors.

To put it bluntly, you design seperate ships. Look at the real world.
Railroads and trucking concerns *do* have to deal with deadheading
trailers or railroad cars, be they livestock carriers or bulk carriers.

Look at ships. Bulk carriers are specialized. Oil, grain, LNG, sulfur,
and automobiles all have *specialized* ships which only carry cargo in
*one* direction, and come back empty. More generalized "bulk" carriers
can usually find *something* to load for the return trip.

Livestock carriers (a rather unusual ship type!) are almost certain be
running empty on the trip back. But low berths for animals may not be
individualized, it depends on details of how low berths work which I\'ve
never seen put down. Assuming that a low berth amounts to pumping the
body fill of special chemicals, then maintaining it at a low but
controlled temperature, then for the animals, you just treat the
animals, stuff them in a hold, and and lower the temp. You\'ll need
better than usual environmental controls controls for the hold, and
some space to process the animals quickly.

Some local biker types I know tell a story about this idiot standing

Of course, he *could* be lying. 

BTW, one of the *classic* stories about this is part of the little
known "Change War" series by Fritz Leiber. The title is "Try and Change
the Past". Our hero goes to a *lot* of trouble to prevent a man from
getting a bullet fired thru his head (understandably, as the man *is*
our hero). He does so only to watch a bullet sized meteor hit....

The basic principle behind all of this is that your freedom of action
is inversely proportional to your knowledge (or directly proportional
to your ignorance, if you want to look at it that way).

The difference between "what you know" and "what you think you know"
becomes critical.

Numerous articles on the subject say that a human chimp cross would
probably be viable. Human gorilla isn\'t likely, but might work. The
crosses would likely be "mules", but they should still be *possible*. 

So we are talking about a "mule" or "liger" situation.

My sources are in storage. Sorry.

I want to make a clarification, in case my words were misunderstood. I made
sure to put "hot" in quotation marks. What i meant by "hot", was that the
grid is still active. The fancy reaction going on in the grid to create the
jump "bubble" around the ship is still in progress, and the reaction takes
some time to end. Also, the grid does not actually delineate the outside of
the jump field, it just creates the field around the ship. People can still
hang on the ship just inside the field if they like.

I see it as being analogous to a magnetic field created by an electrically
charged rotating coil. Whatever tachyon, graviton, or some other still
undiscovered particle field created by the lanthanum grid is *outside* the
grid, surrounding the ship, keeping the ship from dropping into n-space
before the carefully calculated and planned exit at the intended
destination.

<Glenn blows the dust of his trusty JTAS 24>

I just re-read the article you mention, and I don\'t see anything that my
option #2 contradicted. To wit:

"At the end of the week in jump, the ship naturally precipitates out of
jump space and into normal space." - JTAS 24, p. 36

I just tried to explain the cause of the "natural precipitation" as being
the termination of the reaction within the Lanthanum Grid. I don\'t think I
broke the canon this time. :-)

BTW, my "theory" _includes_ the concept of multiple jumpspace dimensions,
and the requirement of different energy inputs into the grid to traverse
these dimensions.

I like #2 better than #1 because, in #1 it doesn\'t make sense that the time
spent in jump is variable. All the canon I\'ve read (including JTAS 24) says
that the time spent in jump is *about* 1 week, it\'s variable. If the time
was some quantum constant, it shouldn\'t be variable. #2 easily explains
away the variability as being a function of the progress of the reaction,
calculated exit point, lanthanum grid imperfections, energy distribution
... etc etc etc

I agree. My explanation includes this. The engineer has to be very careful
that the reaction occuring in the grid is relatively "uniform" throughout,
and that the termination of the reaction is controlled very closely, so
that the exact time of "precipitation into normal space" is known. The Jump
Drives control and drive the reaction in the grid as a power source and
motor controls and drives an electromagnet (Starship Drama Ahead) If the
reaction ends sooner or later than calculated, the planned location for
entering n-space could be waaaay out...

(Just think if some sabateur "spiked" the grid, causing a misjump, or
perhaps a fiendishly planned precipitation outside a different planet from
the one planned by the astrogator >:->

Well, I hope that ties up any loose threads in that theory. :)

There is no such thing as a faster than light drive.  Lasers are inefficient
as personal weapons.  Thrust plates violate several laws of physics.

Yet I have used all three of these elements for years in Traveller *games*.

understanding the underlying principles, please consider the following:

Many of you may have noticed the CANCER SURVIVOR line in my .sig.  I have
Hodgkin\'s Disease.  This what we know about the cause of the disease:




This our complete knowledge of why it strikes men in their late 20\'s:




There is a very good chemotherapy series, which I had.  This is how it
affects the disease:




That\'s right.  We don\'t know what causes it, why it hits young men, or even
how the treatment works, yet HD has a 90% survival rate!

I always get irked when someone announces that a fictional plot device isn\'t
possible (magic, Virus, psionics), or done wrong (energy weapons, FTL, alien
races).  When it comes to FTL, I have seen games that use everything from
Warp Drive to Stutterwarp, and everything in between.  None of them were
real, but they all worked in their situation.

The same can be said for Traveller\'s jump drive.  It has served well since
1977 and I see no reason to change the underlying assumptions on its
operation now.

    'body' => 'In regard to the discussion as to why a jump of any length takes the same amount
of time, one week, I can give a very "down-to-earth" example of a system that
behaves in the same way.

I saw an analysis many years ago of a tunnel system to connect points on the
surface of the Earth. The idea was to bore the tunnel in a straight line from
one point to the other. A train would travel through the evacuated tunnel on
frictionless rails (magnetic levitation or whatever). The train would require no
propulsion since it would fall into the tunnel drawn by gravity. Since there is
no friction, it would accelerate until it reached the deepest point in the
tunnel, then slow as it climbed back up, and come to a stop at the surface
destination. If you go through the physics and math, you will find that the trip
takes exactly the same length of time between any two points on the Earth\'s
surface--three hundred or three thousand miles! I need to redo the calculation
to reconstruct the travel time.

The concept can be extended to interstellar travel. Although we have drives that
can move ships through normal space, there are no drives that work in jump
space. What the ship does in performing a jump is to establish the n-dimensional
"tunnel" between two points on the surface of our spherical three dimensional
space. The ship then slides through the frictionless "tunnel" until it comes out
on the other side, one week later. (The fact that this trip takes a week could
be used to derive a lot of information about the structure of the n-dimensional
universe.) 

My whole point in this was to indicate that there are known physical systems
that behave in the same way as Traveller\'s jump time rule.

Well, I had TW2K and T2300 to get me used to d20\'s and d10\'s, so that
didn\'t bother me too much.  I didn\'t like the Virus though. <g>

Staying with a strictly d6 system I can agree with, but let\'s do away with
as many of the d3\'s as we can..OK? <g>

All of this is moot (not the organization, the point) as the Lanthanum grid was a DGP

Probably, true.  Each Skill would need to be associated with an Aptitude,

Ben has the following Attributes and Skills...

STR  4 - 7 = -3   <-- negative numbers are going to be a problem DEX  9 - 7
=  2

Melee Cbt 3 + (-3) =  0  <---- a problem!

Pilot     2 + (2)  =  2  <---- awfully low!

Unless I\'m misunderstanding this is going to far in reducing the influence
of Attributes.

Doesn\'t bother me, Leonard.  I don\'t have ships using the standard tech

IAC, you\'re picking nits.  ;-> If you want to use the low
accleration thrusters, then make the jump in at 10 stellar
diameters.

   What futher proof is needed to show that Grandfather and/or his children

as you say, Homo Sapiens dispite envionmental conditions and influences.
  I wonder what project humans were selected for and dispersed so widely among

of the major races, humans have the most leanings towards psionics.

Leonard, it seems you are having a bad day. <g>

The Sun is size *8* in Traveller terms, isn\'t it?  

So:  8^2*10 = 640ls

That would be around 1 1/4 AU, I think.

That would be be me.  Actually, the jump in distance I use is 2d6 stellar
diameters, so 2 is the closest approach.

Yes, for Sol that is correct.

My handy dandy Book 6 indicates a tempreture of around 2700 kelvin at that
range..assuming your ship absorbed all the radiation. Ship\'s in my games
have highly reflective surfaces and that helps, but jumping in that close
is still not a happy place to be.  <g> Your Astrogator better be good and

I\'m trying to do a little background research on the Scout Service, both
from the Milieu 0 viewpoint and the Third Imperium (pre Rebellion).

I\'ve got the various insignia from Scouts and Assassins (Paranoia Press) and
the World Builder\'s Handbook (DGP) but I have no indication of the COLOURS
of the insignia, nor of the standard one-piece uniforms the scouts wore.

For some reason I have the following in mind, but I\'ve not managed to track
down any \'canon\' sources for these, so I don\'t know where I got the info from:

LIGHT GREY one-piece uniform?
Badges are BLACK with YELLOW insignia (i.e. the ponii is yellow)?
The sunburst emblem is yellow on a black background?

The MT Referee\'s Companion shows the guys standing on the refuelling scout
ship in light BLUE uniforms. I thought the NAVY was BLUE. So what colour are
the scouts, and army? Someone mentioned some months back about the sunbursts
for the navy being blue and the army being black?

Can someone please point me to something which confirms or denies the above
(it\'s fairly urgent!!!)?

Andy :-)

Before I forget, I ought to thank whoever it was that

being good.

I have spent a week\'s worth of lunch times wading through
second hand bookships (literally), browsing new bookshops,
surfing the net and checking local libraries, in order to
find an SF anthology with this story.  I finally found it
yesterday at the last place I could think of trying in a book
edited by Robert Silverberg called  SF Hall of Fame  Vol.1.

For the 2nd most anthologised SF story ever, it was
surprisingly hard to locate.  Let me say however, it was
worth every minute.

I even read it on the car journey home to the two ladies I
travel with and had them in tears by the last paragraph.

Many thanks - whoever it was - for an enjoyable search and a
wonderful read.

One thing to consider is how much life support the "animals" require
if they\'re not in low-berths.  If you can make a profit by just
cramming them in the hold and feeding them every now and again, do it.
Modern ships carry animals for months in increadibly cramped
conditions, so I imagine ships of the future could get away with it.
The only problem is the increased life support cost.

Starship Economics - Some Problems

Costs & Profits

What are the actual costs involved in starship operations? Well, we know =
that life support costs are 2000 Cr per stateroom per two weeks (and the =
components - presumably including food - take no space on the ship!), =
and that staterooms can be at least double occupancy, and some sources =
imply that "hot bunking" can be used, which implies that up to four =
people can be supported on a "per stateroom" basis. This means that =
actual Life Support costs (depending on what they actually represent) =
are 250-500 Cr per person per week.

If travelling by Low Passage, costs are a flat 1000 Cr - and there is no =
(or minimal) Life Support costs.

We also know that cargoes can be carried by a ship for 1000 Cr per ton =
(the "standard" rate), and that this is a allegedly a profitable =
arrangement for a commercial design hull (i.e. something like a Free, =
Far or Fat Trader rather than something like a Scout or Yacht).

The Free Trader: An Example

Of course, none of the supposedly commercial designs in any iteration of =
Traveller have actually ever been profitable on this basis. For example, =
a standard Free Trader (T4 model) will cost c. 170125 Cr per month =
(assuming she makes two 1 Parsec Jumps and carries a full passenger/crew =
loadout) not including crew salaries (assuming 1 Pilot/Navigator, two =
Engineers, and a Steward {paid as a Medic}, this adds a minimum of a =
further 16000 Cr per month, for a total of 186125 Cr per month) but, =
even if she travels with a full commercial passenger (all assumed to be =
High Passage types) and cargo load, she can earn a maximum of 291800 Cr.

The Stock Free Trader (as per T4)

On a usable space basis, the FT has 120 tons of commercial space (6 =
Staterooms @ 4 tons each, 20 Low Passage Berths @ 1 ton each, and 75.9, =
call it 76, tons of cargo =3D 100 tons), and the actual cost (assuming a =
round 200k Cr per month costs) is 1667 Cr per usable ton. Since she =
generates 291800 Cr (running full) per month, she has an income per =
usable ton of  2918 Cr. Profit per usable ton is 1251 Cr. Or, in other =
words, she can break even as long as she carries around 57% of her rated =
cargo/passenger capacity.

Lets look at it on a line item basis (all items assume two 1 Parsec =
Jumps per month) -

1 High Passage Cabin + 1 ton Cargo Space =3D 20000 Cr income; 8335 Cr =
cost. Profit =3D 11665 Cr (240% return on costs)
1 Middle Passage in High Passage Cabin =3D 16000 Cr income; 6668 Cr =
cost. Profit =3D 9332 Cr (240% return on costs)
1 Low Passage =3D 2000 Cr income; 1667 Cr cost. Profit =3D 333 Cr.
1 ton Cargo =3D 2000 Cr income; 1667 Cr cost. Profit =3D 333 Cr.

The Modified Free Trader (Type 1.1)

Assuming that the vessel never uses unrefined fuel, then the Fuel =
Purification plant may be foregone. Although the game description of the =
FT-1 does not indicate the capacity of this plant, it the space =
available (on some quick reverse engineering) is only enough for the 24 =
ton TL12 model. Foregoing this plant increases the space available for =
commercial use by 24 tons - for a total of 144 tons. This gives a per =
usable ton cost (per month) of 1389 Cr

Assuming this modification runs full, then the income is 339800 Cr per =
month, or an income per usable ton of 2740 Cr. Profit per usable ton is =
thus 1351 Cr - in other words, she can break even as long as she carries =
approximately 50% of her rated cargo/passenger capacity.

Lets look at this modification on a line item basis (all items assume =
two 1 Parsec Jumps per month) -

1 High Passage Cabin + 1 ton Cargo =3D 20000 Cr income; 6945 Cr cost. =
Profit =3D 13055 Cr (288% return on costs).
1 Middle Passage in High Passage Cabin =3D 16000 Cr income; 5556 Cr =
cost. Profit =3D 10444 Cr (288% return on costs).
1 Low Passage =3D 2000 Cr income; 1389 Cr cost. Profit =3D 611 Cr (144% =
return on costs).
1 ton Cargo =3D 2000 Cr income; 1389 Cr cost. Profit =3D 611 Cr (144% =
return on costs).

The Unarmed Free Trader (Model 1.2)

Foregoing the twin Civilian Laser Batteries and TL12 MFD releases a =
further 8 tons for a total commercially usable space of 152 tons. This =
gives a per usable ton cost (per month) of 1316 Cr

Assuming this modification runs full, then the income is 355800 Cr per =
month, or an income per usable ton of 2695 Cr. Profit per usable ton is =
thus 1379 Cr - in other words, she can break even as long as she carries =
approximately 49% of her rated cargo/passenger capacity.

Lets look at this modification on a line item basis (all items assume =
two 1 Parsec Jumps per month) -

1 High Passage Cabin =3D 20000 Cr income; 6580 Cr cost. Profit =3D 13420 =
Cr (304% return on costs).
1 Middle Passage in High Passage Cabin =3D 16000 Cr income; 5624 Cr =
cost. Profit =3D 10736 Cr (304% return on costs).
1 Low Passage =3D 2000 Cr income; 1316 Cr cost. Profit =3D 684 Cr (152% =
return on costs).
1 ton Cargo =3D 2000 Cr income; 1316 Cr cost. Profit =3D 684 Cr (152% =
return on costs).

The Underlying Problem

So, in our standard example, it seems that it is impossible to turn a =
profit when carrying cargo or low passage types! Yes, I know that the =
system allows a Captain/Owner to buy and sell cargoes for themselves and =
that this potentially allows a greater profit being turned - but it =
seems lunatic to allow interstellar commerce to be carried out on such a =
basis.=20

The problem is obviously not with Passage profitability (there are other =
problems that will be dealt with elsewhere), other than Low Passage, it =
is with Cargo profitability.

The obvious initial problem is with the space taken up by the completely =
unprofitable (as per standard rules, anyway) Fuel Refining plant and =
Armament. There seems no earthly reason why any sane designer would =
include a refining plant of any size (at TL12) or any armament into a =
Free Trader unless there is some variable cost for cargo - which, =
according to the rules as they are written, there is not. After all, it =
states quite plainly (page #7, T4 Rules) "Everything Is Driven By =
Economics" - yet there is no economic benefit for a Free Trader carrying =
a Fuel Purification plant or any armament.

This is obviously ridiculous - the reality would be that the Fuel =
Refining Plant would increase the flexibility of the FT to service =
out-of-the-way planets that do not sell refined fuel. According to =
published data, refined fuel is available only at Type A or B Starports =
- - so there must be an economic cost of having a Type C or worse Port =
that would be represented in the cost of carrying cargo to and from such =
a port.

Similarly, in the interior regions of the Imperium (or any Interstellar =
state), safety can be expected to be such that Piracy is nonexistent - =
or nonexistent along heavily travelled routes, anyway. In the outer =
regions, or in areas where there is pirate activity for other factors, =
then the need for armed ships is obvious - and passengers and cargo =
shippers will pay a premium for them.

What cost increase should apply?

I would suggest that no commercially viable vessel should exist that is =
not capable, as a stripped down, no frills, version (like the FT 1.2) of =
breaking even running with at least 50-60% of each element of revenue =
producing tonnage running full.

Furthermore, I would suggest that any vessel carrying "extras" - fuel =
purification, better than normal sensors, weapons and fire control =
equipment, space to planet transport or small craft - should be able to =
charge a premium for their services based on breaking even at 50-60% =
"full".

Taking the three models of FT described above as an example, lets see =
what sort of costings should apply -

Standard FT 1.0

High Passage x 6: Cost =3D 8335 Cr per Cabin per month, or 50.01k Cr for =
all six. Running with three staterooms occupied at all times produces =
60k Cr, or a modest profit of 9990 Cr.

Middle Passage x 6: Cost =3D 6668k Cr per Cabin per month, or 40008 Cr =
for all six. Running with three staterooms occupied at all times =
produces 48k Cr, a modest profit of 9992 Cr.

Low Passage x 20: Cost =3D 1667 Cr per Berth per month, or 33.34k Cr for =
all twenty. Running with twelve occupied berths at all times produces =
24k Cr, 9340 Cr short of the required minimum. The actual cost therefore =
needs to be 1400 Cr per passenger.

Cargo x 76 tons: Cost =3D126692 Cr per month. Running 60% full (46 tons) =
produces 92k Cr, or a shortfall of 34692 Cr. This means that the cost of =
carrying cargo on a FT 1.0 needs to be a minimum of 1380 Cr per ton.

FT 1.1 (no Fuel Refining)

High Passage x 6: Cost =3D 6945 Cr per Cabin per month, or 41.67k Cr for =
all six. Running with three staterooms occupied at all times produces =
60k Cr, a handsome profit of 18.33k Cr!

Middle Passage x 6: Cost =3D 5556 Cr per Cabin per month, or 33336 Cr =
for all six. Running with three staterooms occupied at all times =
produces exactly 48k Cr, a profit of 14664 Cr!

Low Passage x 20: Cost =3D 1389 Cr per Berth per month, or 27.78k Cr for =
all twenty. Running with twelve occupied berths at all times produces =
24k Cr, a loss of 3780 Cr. The cost of Low Passage therefore needs to be =
1158 Cr per berth.

Cargo x 100 tons: Cost =3D 138.9k Cr per month. Running 60%  full (60 =
tons) produces 120k Cr. a shortfall of 18900 Cr. This means that the =
cost of carrying cargo on a FT 1.1 needs to be a minimum of 1158 Cr per =
ton.

FT 1.2 (No Armament or Fuel Refining) 1316

High Passage x 6: Cost =3D 6580 Cr per Cabin per month, or 39.48k Cr for =
all six. Running with three staterooms occupied at all times produces =
60k Cr - a handsome profit of 20.52k Cr!

Middle Passage x 6: Cost =3D 5264 Cr per Cabin per month, or 31584 Cr =
for all six. Running with three staterooms occupied at all times =
produces exactly 48k Cr, or a handsome profit of 16416 Cr.

Low Passage x 20: Cost =3D 1316 Cr per Berth per month, or 26.32k Cr for =
all twenty. Running with twelve occupied berths at all times produces =
24k Cr, a loss of 2320 Cr. The cost of Low Passage therefore needs to be =
1097 Cr per Berth.

Cargo x 108 tons: Cost =3D 142148 Cr per month. Running 60% full (65 =
tons) produces 130k Cr, a loss of 12148 Cr. This means that the cost of =
carrying cargo on a FT 1.2 needs to be a minimum of 1094 Cr per ton.

So much for the "mythical" 1000 Cr per ton for shipping cargo. though =
you can get close.

Far Trader 1.0

A standard Free Trader (T4 model) will cost c. 187841 Cr per month =
(including salaries); even if she travels with a full commercial =
passenger (all assumed to be High Passage types) and cargo load, she can =
earn a maximum of 269800 Cr.

The Stock Far Trader (as per T4)

On a usable space basis, the FT has 100 tons of commercial space (6 =
Staterooms @ 4 tons, 10 Low Passage Berths @ 1 ton each, and 64.9, call =
it 65, tons of cargo =3D 100 tons), and the actual cost (assuming a =
round 200k Cr per month costs) is 2000 Cr per usable ton. Since she =
generates 269800 Cr (running full) per month, she has an income per =
usable ton of  2698 Cr. Profit per usable ton is 698 Cr. Or, in other =
words, she can break even as long as she carries around 75% of her rated =
cargo/passenger capacity.

Lets look at it on a line item basis (all items assume two 1 Parsec =
Jumps per month) -

1 High Passage Cabin + 1 ton Cargo Space =3D 20000 Cr income; 10000 Cr =
cost. Profit =3D 10000 Cr (200% return on costs)
1 Middle Passage in High Passage Cabin =3D 16000 Cr income; 8000 Cr =
cost. Profit =3D 8000 Cr (200% return on costs)
1 Low Passage =3D 2000 Cr income; 2000 Cr cost. Profit =3D 0 Cr.
1 ton Cargo =3D 2000 Cr income; 2000 Cr cost. Profit =3D 0 Cr.

Breaking this down further -

High Passage: Cost is 10k Cr each per month, or 60k Cr for all six. =
Assuming 50% occupancy, this brings in 60k Cr per month, exact break =
even cost.

Middle Passage: Cost is 8k Cr each per month, or 48k Cr for all six. =
Assuming 2/3rds occupancy, this brings in 48k Cr per month, exact break =
even cost.

Low Passage: Cost is 2000 Cr each, so 10 cost 20k Cr per month. Assuming =
6 run full at all times, revenue 12k Cr for a month, a loss of 8000 Cr. =
Actual Low Passage cost therefore needs to be 1667 Cr per berth.

Cargo: Cost is 2000 Cr per ton, so 65 tons cost 130k Cr per month. =
Assuming she runs at 60% full (39 tons), revenue per month is 78000 Cr, =
a loss of 52k Cr. Actual Cargo cost therefore needs to be 1667 Cr per =
ton.

So, you pay a premium for having J2 capacity. Arming the vessel and =
adding fuel refining capacity would further increase actual costs of =
cargo and passenger carriage. Sorry, but there\'s no way that a 1000 Cr =
per ton value can be achieved!

I think, whatever the exact wording or method (e.g. FF&S had the jump
"coils", etc.) what\'s important is the perception of jump space that you
want to be able to explain to your players when they ask "Why a week..."

An analogy I just thought up (it might be crud but bear with me) is to think
of yourself as at one point on a plane (an infinite "flat" Earth) and trying
to get to another point on that plane. Think of the atmosphere as being
divided into multiple layers - the stuff at ground level is "real" space,
the next level up the Jump-1 dimension/space, etc. upwards to Jump-6 (or
possibly higher). A bit like the atmosphere the layers start off _really_
dense but by Jump-6 are really thin.  The boundary between each atmospheric
layer has a certain \'strength\' which must be overcome to enter said layer.

You load yourself into a shell and fire yourself towards your desired
destination, imagine aiming up at about a 45 degree angle from the
horizontal. If you fire yourself too weakly upwards, you \'bounce\' off the
Jump-1 layer and remain in normal space. To target yourself at a point which
we\'ll call 1 parsec away on this planar surface, the arc of your path will
be such as to pass only through the Jump-1 layer. You need X energy to break
into that layer and once you\'re in it, it\'s pretty dense, so you\'ll take a
week to travel to the end of the arc where you drop back through the
boundary to "real" space, i.e. you land on the planar surface about 1 jump
away from where you started.

When you go for Jump-6, you use the same angle, but you shoot off with (for
simplicity\'s sake) 6X energy - your arc carries you very quickly through the
dense Jump-1 layer and up through the other layers, each less dense and thus
allowing you to travel further, with less drag (eventually entering the
Jump-6 layer). Finally you start dropping back through the layers and land
on the planar surface 6 parsecs from your starting point. Because your
flight was mostly through the less dense upper layers, it\'s still only taken
you about a week to make the trip, but you needed that much more energy to
break through to that nice \'thin\' Jump-6 layer.

Note the "what goes up must come down" philosophy, i.e. gravity. A gravitic
field might manifest itself as localised variations in the density of each
level, such that if you passed close to a really heavy object (e.g. star)
this would be equivalent to entering a very dense region of a layer. This
would \'slow\' your progress, perhaps so greatly that you come to a stop and
just drop \'down\' through the layers to emerge in \'real\' space.

The \'arc\' analogy does have some faults - in theory for Jump-6 you\'ll not be
travelling in the Jump-6 dimension all the time, but spending a finite
period in each of the other layers. However, the "canon" has never gone into
this in sufficient detail to preclude this as a possible theory.

The "one week" just happens to be approximately the amount of time that
almost any Jump \'arc\' takes through the \'layers\', due to their varying
densities.

Also, micro-jumps are more difficult to explain. Basically, imagine you\'re
changing the angle at which you\'re fired upwards and only pumping in just
enough energy to pierce the Jump-1 layer. What this might mean is that a
Jump-0 must have some minimum range, or that a Jump-0 to the same point in
space might take less than a week.

Anyone understand all this? Anyone care to comment?

ships joined become separate) in jump", etc.

Oh, and the jump grid/field/coil/spring/whatever could exist throughout the
trip, or only really be needed to punch through the layers when going \'up\'
and perhaps be fading out when coming \'down\', or perhaps the grid levels DO
have to be carefully monitored to ensure that they are at the right levels
to puncture each layer both "up" and "down", which is why the middle of the
trip might be quite quiet, but the rest of the time the engineers have to
watch the drives?

Not that I\'m trying to force this idea onto people but it makes good sense
to me.

Has anyone got any trajectory modelling software which could have varying
density atmosphere layers typed in to see if the "one week" for all arcs
"Jump-1" to "Jump-6" would actually work out in some weird mathematical way
and what the ratio of energies would be for each jump level?

Not me, no, but Jim Burrows, the co-author of our in-house game mechanics,

our own.  He cut his teeth on D&D (before there was AD&D), and ran 
Fantasy Trip (the GURPS precursor, I think), and a few others including 
an early version of Hero, all of which helped inspire him to concoct his

Exactly. 

 "BTW, one of the *classic* stories about this is part of the little

I\'ve read several of the "Change War" stories, inclding this one and the

You\'ve grasped it perfectly.  In fact, my PC has suffered for years

anybody\'s legendary religious figure.

Makes for a good running gag in the game.

Thank you for the links.  I\'ll look them up.

I am familiar with the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. 
As you remark, it\'s one of many.  It doesn\'t happen to be my favorite.
(Something with hidden variables, but of course non-local and with a small 
side-order of residual randomness, please.)

The differences here, until someone actually does some time travel, 
are stylistic.  Of course branching history can be used to resolve 
the paradoxes.  So can timelock.  I prefer timelock, because I like 
the "elegance" of the concept, and I like the idea that you have to 
live with the consequences of your actions, not just re-edit things
over and over again.  I find the branching-histories idea unpleasantly
spongey and shapeless.

Part of the elegance, by the way, is that timelock does not depend on 
which interpretation of quantum mechanics turns out to be right.

The folks at IG have been on vacation for a couple of weeks, as you may 
already know.  But they\'ll be back in the harness next week, and their web
site will return to its usual weekly update schedule.  

In addition, IG is undergoing some changes.  They\'re off-loading the
day-to-day business processes onto their parent organization, which will
allow them to focus their energies entirely upon creating Traveller
gaming products.  This renewed focus includes, among other things, my 
role as IG\'s representative to the TML.  It is hoped that I will be 
able to provide timely information to TML participants, while freeing 
the folks at IG from spending so much time talking on the phone and  
writing email to the hundreds of people who call and/or write every 
week.  They don\'t want their fans to be left out in the cold, but they
also don\'t want to have to stop making products! :)

The parent organization has given IG a new focus on producing the 
highest quality product at a competitive price.  Expect to see more 
color plates, more custom artwork (no more generic stuff), top-quality 
printing, far fewer errors, and all of the other markings of premium 
gaming products.  At the same time, the parent organization wants 
Traveller to sell extremely well.  Therefore, the prices will be held 
down even as the costs of production rise.  

The idea is to get Traveller into the hands of as many people as 
possible by making it the best RPG available anywhere, without pricing 
themselves out of the market.  This is good news for us.  It means that the
investors are in for the long haul.  They\'re willing to sacrifice short-term
profits for long-term viability.  Needless to say, that\'s a pretty unusual 
attitude in today\'s business environment.

These changes are beginning now, but they will continue to be implemented 
in stages over the next two or three months.  By the end of December, 
everything should be in place.  From that time (at the latest), everything 
will be top-quality and on-time, every time.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

As to your other questions, here is my take:

Any math involved should ideally be done before the game on the character
sheet.  During the game, I want to me able to say "Make a Difficult roll" and
have the player do so without reference to a table (except maybe the back of
my ref\'s screen which has a chart of difficulty levels and numbers of dice).

Although a ref can always tweak the system by assigning individual small mods
to target number/throw, the actual task system shouldn\'t require them to
function properly.

One problem with the Easy to Impossible probability spread is that each
increase in difficulty is only 1/2 a dice, an average of only one more point
of skill or attribute to keep the same chance of succeeding.  (Yes, I\'m
simplifying, but not much.)  I would increase the task difficulties by more
dice, especially at the upper end (Impossible/Staggering).

 "a question: What does all this have to do with traveller?"

It relates to the existence of multiple human races in the game 
setting.  If chimps and humans are still interfertile, then it\'s 
very likely that all the various human races of the game still 
are, even though their populations were separated back at Homo 
habilis or whatever that pre-sapiens species was.

If not, then the different human races would have speciated and 
individuals of the different races would not be interfertile.

(Remembered quote: "I didn\'t know Klingons and humans could have 
children." "Actually, the DNA is quite compatible, given a lot of
help, rather like my mother and father.")

Actually, there\'s a sliding scale of possibilities:

1) Free interfertility.
2) Reduced interfertility.
3) Interfertility only with medical intervention.
4) Production of sterile hybirds ("mules").
5) Production of sterile hybrids only with medical intervention.
6) No interfertility.

(How handy.  Just roll one die.  And I didn\'t even plan it that way.)

And, of course, the situation could be different for different races.
That is, Solomani and Vilani might be at (2), but Solomani and Zhodani 
might be at (3), while Zhodani and Vilani might be at (1), etc. 

By the way, what do these different human races LOOK like?  Just 
within the Solomani, we have variations of pigment, nose shape, 
epicanthic folds, fullness of lip, hair texture, and general hairiness.
If these various races are in danger of being separate species, it 
seems likely some of them have clearly visible physical differences.
("That\'s funny. You don\'t look Vilani.")

Ursula K. LeGuin wrote a series of novesl, the "Hainish novels," in 
which Earth is one of several colonies of the human homeworld, Hain, 
but the old Hainish community broke up so long ago that all the Hainish 
worlds have their own separate species (sometimes several) of human.
Titles include:
 - The Left Hand of Darkness (featuring a race of hermaphrodites)
 - Rocanon\'s World
 - The Word for World Is Forest
 - The Dispossessed
 - City of Illusions
and some others.

This claim might develop from the fact that chimpanzees and homo sap. differ
in ONE chromosome pair.  I can easily dig up the genetics research that
supports this.  But they are not interfertile.

In addition, if Homo Erectus was distrubuted throught the galaxy...and ALL
developed into modern humans, it would be amazing...but we only recognize
the ones that DID develop into humans as that...many minor races might be
Homo Er. with a left turn in a strange environment.

How about adding skill and attribute, with the proviso that the attribute is
limited to the skill * 2?

Thus, your Dex 10 Pilot 1 would roll against a target number of 3, while your
Dex 4 Pilot 6 would roll against 10?

This would still give an advantage to naturally talented people, provided
that they had the training to take advantage of that talent. In the above
example, if each pilot improves their skill by one, the more dexterous will
have a new target number of 4+2=6 (doubling his number) while the \'klutz\'
would have a new number of 4+7=11 (only an improvement of 1).

Actually, in no way could you make the case for changing, 
Charisma/Social Standing, Intelligence, or Education in any way.  To
do less would smack of bigotry.  Of course, the opportunity to get an
education for males or females could be limited by the opportunities
on their particular world, and Social standing could be different for
different worlds...

Don\'t forget the possibility of matriarchies, btw.  There will 
undoubtedly be the occasional world in which women dominate 
politically, and men are 2nd class citizens.

Not to open another can of worms, but what if 1 of the 2 people in
your example are homosexual...or (in the case of alien encounters)
asexual...this would blow the heck out of your model...

I\'d opt for nothing.  Don\'t like not making 1 sex weaker than the
other?  Don\'t think it realistic?  Maybe the woman is trained in
self-defense methods?  Maybe she\'s good with a pair of brass
knuckles...  Maybe she\'s a body builder?  

BTW, if you do use a STR-1, you might consider a DEX+1.  Recent 
studies suggest that women have more manual dexterity, and faster
reaction times than men...

> charisma/empathy attribute in Traveller.  Social Standing certainly

Suz is unaware or has forgotten about the charisma attribute that is
present in TNE, as well as Vargr characters from CT/MT...

Remember when adjusting any of these characteristics, particularly
using T4\'s task system, that the +1\'s & -1\'s can seriously skew the
possibility of successfully completing tasks, and that most racial
differences with aliens in Traveller are modified by +1 or -1, so its
a big step to say that every man is +1 stronger than a woman...

True, quite true.  Ship specialization in on or the other medium would 
definitely work well.  Alternatively your idea of modular cargo holds 
also works to an extent.  (eg. Mamoth Class Freighter, Ships of the 
French Arm)  The only problem is eventually someone has to transport 
those containers back from whence they came which would require one of 
two things.  Either A) the containers rot on world B untill they can be 
refilled and returned to world A, or B) the containers are eventaully 
transported in one massive shipment back to world A.

Either way it requires specialized transport.  I think though that a 
modular vessel is the way to go.  Look at all the container\'s that are 
shipped through the worlds ports, dumped on trains or loaded onto trucks. 
 These things are semi-trailer sized containers that are never opened and 
re-packed to accomidate a different mode of transport, they are simply 
plopped onto the next transport mode and shipped off pronto.

Obsidian is only formed under very specific conditions.  Exteremly thin 
runny lave has to solidify at an extremely fast rate.  There are huge 
deposits of it in northern BC.  Mount Edzidza (sp?).  It\'s really nice 
stuff to work with, and speaking from personal experience it\'ll go

I beleive what they mean are actual surface deposits.  This could also be 
an indicator of a relatively recent genesis for the planet.  The minerals 
are formed underground usually as a result of an intrusive volcanic 
batholith.  As the Batholith cools the surrounding rocks are transformed 
due to heat and pressure.  As time passes the overlaying rocks are 
erroded away exposing the minerals to the surface.

I\'ve often wondered if the change in governement between the 1130 reading

This is pretty cool.  I like the senate like mentality of the place, 
where people serve the people out of loyalty rather than the ability to 
collect a nice fat penison after 8 years.  I like the wondering Archon, 
very cool idea.

I have to ask though,  YUKO?????  Why Yuko?  Sounds terribly Japanese.

Again I like this.  Very Celtic in its feel.  I\'ve often thought that the 
Spiri were a cross between the ancient Greeks (government and 
philosophy), the ancient Celts (art, social equality, and mysticism) and 
the Indians of the NorthWest Coast (art, legend and material technology). 

I also beleive that the Spiri possess their own unique script and 
language, completely unrelated to anything else in the human sphere.

Agriculture and cottage industry, very important.  I\'ve often thought 
that religion on Spires is an extremely personal thing, there is some 
overlaying spiritual dogma, ie. the spirits of nature exist all around us 
blah blah blah, but beyond that people are free to worship as they see 
fit and few would consider interfering in that right.  Religion and 
Higher Learning occurred our of a number of Spiritual centers which were 
centerally located between a number of outlaying villages.  These 
villages were inturn responsible for the maintenance of the Spiritual 
Center and for providing a certain amount of food for the teachers.  In 
return the knowledge was there for all to access with no restrictions.

I imaging city life as being something like Athens during the golden age 
of greece.  Large forums, theatres, open air markets, very cosmopolitan.

In my Spires, my character D\'zvyadya A\'yanshi Kayla, there\'s a whole 
story behind that name.  Was educated at the University of Gwynmark, you 
can see my Celtic bent there.  Universities would be hugely popular on 
Spires and entrance, though open to all, would be granted with a 
preference to the most tallented and then to whom ever wanted.

Actaully there are a number of Archaic Homo Sapiens finds in South (?) 
maybe it\'s East, Africa that have pushed the Homo Sapiens date back to 
roughly the 150-200k limit.  But 300k were, according to current theory, 
still looking at Homo Erectus.  For a nearly complete fossil look for 
Richard Leaky\'s find in 1984, KNM-WT 15000, its about 80%.  He\'s a pretty 
rugged beastie, heavy brow ridges, large muscle attachments etc.  He 
might pass as a line backer.  But he\'d be a big son of a buck.

Oddly enough current theory is, and this is to a large extent bourne out 
by the fossil evidence, that Modern Homo Sapiens Sapiens appeared 
independently in both Southern Asia and Africa.  There is no evidence of 
contact between the two populations and certian skelital traits evident 
in fossils found a Zhoukoudian and Hexian are still present in asian 
populations to this day.

Neanderthal\'s are faily close to us, thats for sure.  Neanderthals appear 
to be a local, European/Mid-East, adaptation to climatic contidions 
during the pliestocene.  Again, large frame but he\'d definately pass as

It is interesting to note that on average, Homo Sapiens Neanderthalensis

Right, I haven\'t finished sifting through the last lot of mail yet so sorry 
if this has been mentioned.

I was sorting through all my CT/MT/TNE books and found in MT Journal 4 a hit 
location system for MT .  It seems worth a look and perhaps could be of use 
to many people out there if you can track a copy down.

As (FOUL WORD WARNING: PARENTS PLEASE ESCORT SMALL 
CHILDREN FROM THE ROOM) "Canon" states it they\'re pretty 
interfertile, probably towards the higher end of your scale...but 
doubtful they are all 1\'s, unless the Ancients genetically 
manipulated, which is quite probable actually.  "Canon" states that 
the Solomani are unique in the number of different racial types, and 
that the other major and minor human races were selected as a pretty 
homogenous lot, i.e. similar range of skin color, hair color, eye 
color, etc...  Of course, 300,000 years of evolution, breeding, 
adaptation to new environments might widen or change this range, but 
this is how previous published works look at it.

Nice post Earl, you stated the possibilities quite well...

That\'s one angle I never thought of.
I have also always wondered whether the Vilani (their world overrun with Ancients 
warmachines) actually discovered jump drive or not. Did they discover an already built 
one and copy it (a la Geonee). Same goes for the Zhodani. There were Droyne and 
chirpers on their world. Maybe they were taught. Geez, that leaves only Solomani as a

how useful they are tactically - how about missiles that use microjumps

other assumptions (changing the 100-diamter rule, weird rules about jumping

Who\'s throwing out the bathwater? Just because Traveller has a new
publisher doesn\'t mean I\'m going to change the way *MY* game works, or
invalidate background *I\'ve* already established. I am going to use a
lot of the excellent background given by DGP. Especially the Alien
supplements which do a good job of explaining Vilani, Vargr, Aslan and
Solomani culture and motivations.

I\'m sure that T4 will give me more background and stuff to chew on (If I
ever get it... still waiting), if it condradicts stuff in *MY* game, I
just won\'t use it. Call me a rebel if you will.

Since I don\'t think they\'ll be overhauling basic assumptions about Jump
travel time (1 week) and distance (max. 6 parsec), etc. I can make up
whatever pseudo-science explaination I want for MY game. I encourage
everyone else to do the same.

I like this. No messy explanation required. However, it still fails to
address the concept of a variable 1 week travel time, and it is terribly
short on allowing for additional drama. (It\'s a week, that\'s it --
nothing can be done about it, sit around watch the holovid for the
duration of the jump, ho-hum)

    'body' => 'another way things change if jump time can be cut down to 1 day for a jump 1:

political binding.

part of the nature of the Imperium, and the other Trav societies, 
hinges on the long delays for turn around of messages. If it takes a 
week to send a message to your overlord, and a week to get one back, 
then you have to have a lot of devolved responsibility to keep on top 
of things. 

If, otoh, you can send a message J1 in a J5 ship (expensive, but this 
is Government Business) and get a reply in 3 days rather than 2 weeks, 
then the a world can exercise considerably more control over its 
neighbours - specifically its immediate neighbours. 

This means that tight-clusters of J1 worlds emerge, with close 
political linkage, and more hierarchy, more captive governments. This 
makes a notcieable change to the Trav star map! 

News also travels faster. The fastest current news (including Imperial 
Proclamations) travels by express-boat - J4 (or J5) in 1 week -- but 
even with a fast squelch transmission of compressed data to a waiting 
express boat to jump on, it then takes a week per jump to radiate from 
there to each immediate neighbour in a cluster off the jump route. 

In the 20% of J5 scenario, news can travel 5xJ1 in 1 week, covering 5 
systems directly and many more indirectly. Those proclamations leap 
across the local space. OK so they still take as long to make the leap 
across 10, 15, 10 parsecs - but that\'s my point -- the local space can 
get news and orders so much more quickly than in mainstream classic 
that this change must upturn the conventional order in favour of local 
regions. 

Part of the fast repsonse includes the jump back time to move ships to 
defend a system against incomers. Systems *must* now have fast 
couriers that can make a quick J1 to get help in the form of other J5 
ships, ratherthan the current mix of ships.

shadow@ (Leonard Erickson) argues persuasively for the 
related case where documented Trav naval techniques rely on the 
surprise of all jumps taking equal time so couriers can\'t leap ahead 
to the next system (only leap further). 

It remains true that we have no *good* explanation of *why* all jumps 
take a week (but plent of waving hands....). I don\'t mind that lack 
too much [ok - it really *bugs* some people]. What I don\'t want is a 
change in that background as a raminficationof an unneeded change to 
rules.

Sorry Leonard - that\'s only if you try to run straight out from the Sun...

Current rocket drives are nowhere near that powerful. Ok the Big 
rockets for earth launch can punch higher for take off but that\'s only 
till they gain orbital speed. Once up, they use lower thrust drives... 
but they use them for prolonged periods to gain orbital velocity 
*around* their primary (earth, moon, sun...) As They increase OV, 
their orbit enlarges, they gradually move further from the primary - 
and so escape. 

A low-G trav ship can do the same. You accellerate horizontally until 
you are moving fast enough. (From a planet, an airframe ship has it 
very easy - look at modern airliners - they take off from a 1G planet 
at well below 1G, because they get lift from the airfoils. The limit 
for most is powert (air resistance) and height (running out of 
oxygen). A tarv ship with an airfram can easily climb up to high thin 
air, then (still using the airframe for support) ramp up to orbital 
velocity and beyond. It just takes longer than zipping straight up 
with a showy tail!

In space, you don\'t use an airfram, you get no support as there\'s no 
air! BUT, you start out moving round the planet, round the sun 
whatever, rather than falling into it. Yo accellarate along your orbit 
and gain speed, and moveto a higher orbit that way. Even a HEPLAR ship 
with low endurance (20 hrs+) can generate much much more trust than 
any current earth ship has ever done, and so easily escape from the 
sun.

Subject: Flame-proof-vesty-bunny (Religion)

Reminds me of my friend who used to invite in Mormons, sit them down
opposite his array of occult books, offer them tea, coffee or alcohol, 
then spend an hour ripping their religion to shreds and mentioning, in 
passing, the pentacle inscribed on his floor under the carpet. Never 
seen people move so fast for the door... :-) (hope this doesn\'t offend 
any Mormons on the group. I\'m an agnostic, so I keep an open mind but 
I\'m more likely to believe in flying saucers than the \'average\' person\'s 
view of God). >>

Same here, but if there *is* a God, I\'m pretty sure He\'s got a sense of 
humour (hey, anyone who\'s seen me naked *knows* He does...)

<< P.S. Boy is this stuff off-track, but it\'s fun! >>

Maybe I should mention the Traveller game where someone tried to summon 
a demon...and succeeded!

<< P.P.S. When\'s someone going to suggest running Traveller demos for 
Sunday Schools? What better way to introduce children to the GOOD side 
of RPGs.  >>

Traveller should be a pretty safe game for that - no demons, magic, 
strange gods, etc...just good, clean, wholesome, mindless violence...

  Good news!  A couple of quick questions:

1.  The Starships book.  Has it been shipped to the distributors?

2. The Equipment Catalog.  Now that it\'s been submitted, could the list get
a \'sneak peek\'?  Things like, topics covered, a smattering of material
listed, that sort of stuff.

3.  T4 main book V2.  Will the 2nd printing contain more than just
corrected data? (corrections should include new artwork for the small arms.
:-<)

Thanks for the news on IG. Glad to hear they have such a vocal voice.:)

Is there any news on the Starships Book or the JTAS? I\'m willing to 
wait for quality (although only until my disposable income runs out),

The refocus on quality and market is good to hear. Do you know if 
they will be relasing a "revised" T4 basic book?

Navy: Yellow Sunburst
Army: Black SB
Marines: Maroon SB
Scouts: Red SB

While my copy of Grand Survey/Census died years ago, I seem to remember that
on the covers the insignia looked like it might have been blue/black on
white, with the red SB.

The uniform itself doesn\'t necessarily have to match the branch color.  Vacc
Suits will probably be brightly colored to aid in recognition during EVA.
At TL 14-15, the Scout uniform becomes the tailored Vacc Suit.

Just as a side note, in my 3rd Imperium, dress uniforms are as follows:

Navy: Black jacket, white trousers, white kepi, black low-quarter shoes.

Army: Khaki Jacket, black trousers, black kepi, black, spit-shined boots.

Marines: Dark red/Maroon jacket, white trousers, maroon beret, black boots.

I tried four different methods to come up with an attribute:

  Method B: ((2D6)/2)-1 (Min 1)             2       1       1

                                            5       2       2
Then I tested the percents for each         6       2       2
outcome:                                    7       2       2

 2  22.22%  30.56%  66.67%  66.67%         11       3

 4  22.22%   8.33%   2.78%   6.66%
 5  11.11%

Personally, I like the two Tables best, although I can\'t decide which I
prefer.  I think the 2D6.

This would give the following To Hit numbers

Stat Skill App To Hit | Stat Skill App To Hit | Stat Skill App To Hit | 
  7    2    2    11   |   7    2    1     9   |   7    2    4    15   |

  3    1    2     5   |   3    1    1     4   |   3    1    4     7   |
 11    1    2    13   |  11    1    1    12   |  11    1    4    15   |
  7    4    2    15   |   7    4    1    11   |   7    4    4    23   |

I don\'t know if these numbers help, but they sure look nice. :)

Seriously though, I think that we are on the right track with the skill
times apptitude thing.  Since each skill would be assigned to a particular
apptitude, the combination could be recorded on the Char sheet and then,
depending on how you want to play the game either add the attribute in, or
leave it off to be added later.

in this instance. It was kind of a D\'oh! moment for me...we get so caught up
in High-Middle-Low passage as the ONLY way to travel, I forgot to think
clearly about what is necessary here. Life support only has to be of the
minimal variety for this sort of journey, so low passage was overkill. 

	This does bring up the economic rock throwing type of question: what 
other modes of interstellar travel exist?

	High-Middle-Low passage is clearly based on the old steamship 
First-Second-Steerage class of travel, probably for the similarity of the 
travel mode..you get on for a week or three at a time.

	But surely this isn\'t the only way things are handled in the
Imperium, there have got to be "Carnival Cruise Lines" and "Greyhhound
Busses" and "Trump Shuttle" service between Sylea and Ordun, for instance,
just to demonstrate the range of services available (and the corresponding
costs). For instance, a Greyhound type of travel service may be a large
container ship with bunks, a community \'fresher, and bad cafeteria food (or
a McDonalds franchise or two) to keep you fed for the week or two you\'re 
travelling.  This is certainly less service than even middle passage,
but not as risky as low passage. 

	If the Imperium is going to be such a trade based empire, a lot of 
that trade is going to be in moving people from place to place.

	As someone else said...discuss among yourselves ;-)

I\'d like to see the period from about -50 to 50 covered so that people
have an idea of how things changed on "the fateful day" - 0/0.

Also, adventure hooks are great, but whole adventures are even better - 
I liked Hard Times, which combined sourcebook material with a series
of adventures to explore the material presented.

Well, of course, I\'d like to see this and Milieu 0 rolled into one, but 
if there\'s lots of good material in \'First Survey\', I won\'t mind buying
it separately. I\'d like to see key worlds detailed and not just inside
the Sylean Federation - I\'d like to see maore detail surrounding Vland
and other important planets.

Also, there should be system generation rules that produce systems
consistent with Year 0 - no 50% Type A starports and such...

I\'ve got it! The PCs are agents who resign from Sylea\'s
intelligence service in disgust with it, only to be kidnapped
and taken to a strange, isolated place called "The Planet".
The leaders \'f "the Planet" go to nefarious lengths
to squeeze information out of the PCs.

Oh, and no one has a name, only a number...

Maps of the border, changing over time. Like those films from
history class showing arrows pointing all over Europe where
the Romans/Nazis/other big military power went where, when and with
how much stuff.

<dry, monotone voice-over>
In year 30, Cleon pushed past Vland into Corridor where
much resistance from various tiny Vargr states was encountered.
The Potentate of Vargrzzr fell first, in 31, followed by the 
Grrvvrd of Frrddrzzrn in 32, then all of the client states of
Vurgrddon, before the pressure from the Zurvvrdr coreward became
too great...

This sort of data would be great! It would be

Something along the lines of DGP\'s old Aliens modules would be good,
although perhaps not as in depth. Revised aging tables for Vilani 
would be nice. How about info on some minor human races too?
What about the race the Vilani discovered during their sub-c
spaceflight days? And the Genoee?

ANyways, those are my suggestions/ideas. I\'m looking
forward to seeing the Milieu 0 book in print! (Almost
as much as I\'m hoping to get my T4 hardback!!)

affect how fast skills are learned, and how high skills peak.

Yet another proposal:
  Skills start at a "base" TN (target number) of 6;   

  Everytime your skill level is increased, you have three attemps
  to increase your Skill TN.  If the primary attribute plus a roll
  of two dice exceed your current Skill TN, then it is increased by one.
  
  Skill-0  -> TN = 6
  Skill-1  -> TN = 6 + the 3 attempts to increase
  Skill-2  -> TN = 6 + the 6 attempts to increase
  Skill-3  -> TN = 6 + the 9 attempts to increase
  Skill-4  -> TN = 6 + the 12 attempts to increase

  If you don\'t like all the dice rolling, a table could created that gives
  the average TN for Skill Level/Attribute combination.  This would make it
  easier to bulk convert existing character to a newer system.

  Assumption:  Novice=6, Average=9, Skilled=12, Highly Skilled=15, Expert=18.
  Skill TN max out at attribute+12, so an average character would max out
  around expert, after years of training.  An exceptional character would
  reach Expert quicker, and could peak in the "Super Geek".

  If you prefer heroic characters, increase the number of attempts per level.

Probably so.  But the goal is to get NEW players while retaining the 
old.  New players like pretty pictures.  So you give them pretty 
pictures. :)

I\'ve received quite a few questions on some topics, so I thought I\'d try
to cover it all once, here. :)  


Q.  When will [insert product here] be shipped?

A.  The correct schedule for products to be shipped (that is, when they
will begin to be shipped to dealers and those who ordered directly through
IG) is:

        Starships                       November 1
        JTAS                            November 1
        Citizens of the Imperium        November 15
        Aliens Archive                  November 15
        Central Supply Catalog          December 1
        Milieu 0                        December 15
        First Survey                    December 15


Q.  When is the web site going to be updated?  How about weekly updates?

A.  The folks at IG have been on extended vacation for the last couple of
weeks.  Starting next week, the web site will be updated _at least_ once
per week.


Q.  When is my T4 hardback going to arrive? 

A.  Foreign orders will take about a month longer than other orders to 
the continental U.S.  In addition, some orders within the U.S. were
shipped Priority Mail, while others were shipped 4th Class.  The method
of shipping depended on the date the order was placed.  4th Class mail
takes quite a bit longer to arrive than Priority, so please be patient
and you should receive it shortly.


Q.  I really don\'t like [insert a rule from T4 here] . . .

A.  If you don\'t like something about any IG product, feel free to change
it!  The folks at IG realize they aren\'t gods, and are therefore unable
to create the perfect system for everyone.  Their philosophy is that they
are producing _guidelines_, not laws carved in stone.


Q.  My local game store doesn\'t carry Traveller products.  (Or, "There
aren\'t any Traveller players in my area.")

A.  Ask the owner of your friendly local game store if you can run a 
demo of the Traveller game.  If s/he will let you do so, some ideas 
for what to do include:
        1)  Run through some _extremely simple_ scenarios with 
            prospective customers.  These might be simply hitting
            a target - give them a character, a situation, a little
            build up, and a number to roll.  Act out the consequences.
        2)  Get a few members of your gaming group together, and play
            at the store, if they\'ll allow it and have an area where
            customers can stop by and watch you play.
        3)  Your own ideas

        The point is, demand drives supply.  If you would like to see a 
supply of Traveller products at your local game store, create the demand
and let the game store owner know that demand exists.  If you can stir up 
enough demand among the gaming community in your area, the game store 
owner will almost certainly begin carrying lots of Traveller products.
        Plus, you you may end up making some new gaming friends! :)



More to follow, as time and information become available. :)

See my FAQ post for the answer to this question.

> they will be relasing a "revised" T4 basic book?

There will be a revised T4 basic book.  I edited a copy of T4 and sent it 
to IG, at Ken Whitman\'s request, for just this purpose.  The revised book 
isn\'t slated to have any changes to the systems, though (ie, no re-write 
of the task system).  It will merely be version 1.1 - a bug fix.  Animal 
attack target numbers, grammatical errors and typos removed, missing 
tables inserted, etc. etc.

(Note to self: add this to the FAQ :)

(apologies if I send the attachment back %$&*#@ mailer)

This has *always* been the case with the smaller Traveller starships.  I
can remember my incredulity when I discovered, after picking up the CT
book *Merchant Prince* that a standard ship mortgage could *only* be paid
off through speculative buying.

To top this idea off, I think the published materials underestimate the
day to day costs of running a starship.  The following expenses are not
usually included as I recall (disclaimer: all published materials are at
home);

Food and drink for passengers and crew
Convoy Escort Fees
Tariffs, Duties, Taxes, and other government fees (avoided when smuggling)
Brokerage fees
Delivery charges
Loading/unloading charges (or, perhaps, heavy equipment rental)
Furniture, curtains, linens, little bars of soap, complimentary towels,
etc etc for passenger and crew staterooms
Plates, silverware, condiments, finger bowls, napkins, dishwashing liquid,
plumbing fixtures (where do they keep the drinking water?), all the stuff
found in kitchens and dining rooms
Oxygen, Nitrogen, Other chemicals for air or waste processing, Other
consumables besides the fuel itself, hookups while docked, septic tank
pumping, waste removal.
Insurance, Delivery bonds, Lawyers\' fees, registration fees, inspection
fees, bank fees, ATM fees, etc. 

There\'s quite a bit to this starship economics thing that doesn\'t seem to
show up.

On the other hand, I thinkthat a huge profit should be possible taking
high demand materials to the right worlds.  More than is represented in
most rules systems I have seen.  

On the other other hand (I\'m a hiver, did\'nt I tell you?) this kind of
stuff can get in the way of Role Playing.

On the other other other hand (I\'ve still got two to go after this) I have
used these types of methods to create the incentive for money making in
the past (especially when the ship in question gets impounded for
non-payment of Fee X).

I may have a need for this detail in the near future, if I do something
I\'ll try to post it.

Excellent point!  This is a game, after all, not a holy writ.  How each of
us decides to run *our* games is our, and our players, business.

So do I. I\'ve run across *many* good ideas on the lists, from the GDW, IG
and 3rd party books, and from private conversations. However, very few of
these ideas will make there way into my games unchanged.  <g> 

I *enjoy* hearing ideas, speculations, different ways of doing things.  I
*don\'t* enjoy people trying to smother this free
expression of ideas with calls to any sort of "canon."

Greetings,
Somewhere out there on the Net I was able to find a Traveller random

Vilani, & Zhodani.  Maybe one of our savants can help with a URL?

I think 300K yrs ago was past H. Erectus\' time. By that time

Another method is roll a pool of points and distribute. 

Rule:  Each Aptitude begins with a base of 1, roll 2d6 and
distribute over the 7 Aptitudes with the limitation that no Aptitude
may exceed 4.  This give the player some control over the
personality of character they want to play.

I like it too.  The next task is to assign an Aptitude to some
Skills, generate some characters and see how it works out.

whole other thread) and doesn\'t sacrifice, enslave, or eat sophonts, they
are left alone to rule or misrule as they see fit.  

#2  Hands-on:  The empire creates a number of noble families (say 1 per

The nobles are loyal to the empire, which created them, and the factional
infighting among them is reflected in the Govermental type.

that we are working on several product lines that may be of interest to you.
More to the point, we are actively seeking authors for books to be published
in these lines. The lines are listed below.

  We have an agreement with Imperium Games to produce licensed Traveller 4th
Edition products. We are looking for authors, primarily for adventure
anthologies (each adventure being 8,000-10,000 words). We are planning to
release the first of our T4 books next spring to be followed by additional
books through the year.

  We also publish a line of adventure books for use with the Hero System,
called Heroic Adventures. Each volume consists of several adventures for a
specific genre (HA1 was for Champions, HA2 for Dark Champions, HA3 will be
for Fantasy Hero, etc.). Adventures should be 8,000 to 10,000 words, and we
are looking for additional Champions and Dark Champions adventures.

  Lastly, we are working on a new roleplaying game set in feudal Japan,
called Sengoku: Chambara Roleplaying in Feudal Japan. Sengoku will use the
new Fuzion game system (by Hero Games and R. Talsorian), expanded with a
number of genre-specific rules. We have a number of supplements planned which
are, as of yet, not assigned an author. If you have an interest in the genre,
drop us a line.

  Propsective authors should download our current submission guidelines from
our web page at http://members.aol.com/goldrushg/index.htm.

Oops again, this wasn\'t (AFAIR) stated explicitly in any of the previous
iterations of Traveller! It *does* make things potentially a lot worse,
but all the figures I used were worked out on the basis of single
occupancy anyway. It just reduces the utility of double occupancy!

Erm, isn\'t that 2000 Cr *per fortnight* ... or 1000 credits per week per
crewmember?

I really think that we *have* to assume that the comment about Life
Support costs being *double* for two occupying the one statement is
*wrong* if there is to be any hope at all of making the starship economics
system work. At worst I would suggest that it should be no more than +50%
(or +1000 Cr per fortnight, 500 Cr per week).

Then we have to assume (I feel) that whatever Life Support actually
represents *cannot* be included in operating costs for crew quarters,
assume that it is, in fact, part of their salary package (like "room &
board"). Otherwise it opens a whole can of worms!

Actually, the reason I was doing the "research" was because I was writing
down some thoughts on exactly what sort of layout and facilities you could
expect in a standard Cabin when in use for High or Middle Passage ... and
I have some ideas of layout as a result. Suffice it to say that, if you
assume foldaway beds (like those in Pullman cabins on RRs), then there\'s
plenty of room for two!

Well, as a old player I have to say that I also like pretty pictures.  If
IG, or anyone, were to produce Traveller products without any pictures I
don\'t know if I would buy it.  So I don\'t see including pretty pictures in
Traveller products as catering to only new players but also as catering to
some of us older ones as well.

Yup, I had forgotten about the firestorm over the pictures, when T4 first 
came out.  Now I do remember, though - lots of old-timers [G] care about 
the graphics in Traveller...

Thanks for pointing that out.

hehehe.  Pretty cool.  Did I ever tell you about the multibillionaire NPC

Yaay!  Glenn, you\'ve got the right attitude.  The published material is 
nothing more than ONE way of doing things.  It can be a source of 
inspiration.  And, there\'s nothing wrong with using the published 
material as-is.  But it should never be a shackle.

I do recall reading that the Scout Sunburst is red while the Imp. Navy
is yellow (gold thread if worn as part of a uniform). Unfortunately, I
can\'t remember where I read this but it was within the last 3 weeks.
I\'ll start looking but I\'m 85% certain these colors are correct. The
sunburst of the Imperium itself was changed to black by one of the
empresses when she found out a newly "citizenized" minor race couldn\'t
see these colors.

Huh?  I don\'t recall receiving two emails from you...not even one, until

confused. 

Perhaps you sent mail to imperiumgames@imperiumgames.com?

Your ideas below are interesting, but they all assume a GP number *2*
(or larger!) hull. I was talking about a GP #1 hull which is about the
size of a basketball. :-)

First thing I\'d do is check and see if such a ship was known, and where
it supposedly originated. Since *we* can\'t make such hulls, where the
hell did they get it? And if the records *don\'t* show such a ship
making a jump between those systems, or if there is one, and it arrived
ok, then we likely have a ship from a parallel universe.

BTW, as long as we are talking about GP#2 hulls, how about having it be
Beowulf Scheaffer and that little ship he was piloting around the
neutron star? Disable the bomb in time and you\'ll have one *nasty*
combat vessel on your hands.

So does the Imperial Encyclopedia by GDW and Travellers\' Digest #20 by
DGP.  Given these three "oh-ficial" sources, Andy, I\'d say light blue
for the Scout Service should be considered "canon". I\'m still hunting
for the  patch colors but my certainty has gone up to 95%.

This post on the world called Spires is the best thing I have seen and 
read on this digest for the past  four or five weeks at least. I would 
really like to see more of this type of thing. I know we used to get a 
lot of RICE papers posted earlier in the year so there are people out 
there with plenty of ideas. The less creative of us (like myself) would 
love to read them.

Oooh.  I like that.  It\'s simple, and effective!

But... (you knew that was coming, didn\'t you? [G]) ...that makes the 
target numbers awfully low. Anyone with 1 level of skill will be pretty 
much out of luck, whereas under the other Traveller systems (CT, MT, TNE) 
a skill level of 1 gave you a decent chance of succeeding.

I hate to complicate it, but how about using 2 as the base for skilled 
people?   Thus, it would be 2+skill+characteristic(max:skill*2).

Oh, and what about unskilled people?  What do they use as a target 
number?  It\'d have to be awfully low...

Hmmm.  Greg Porter made the small craft design system available to people 
on the GDW-Beta list.  Perhaps someone who has been following that 
discussion more closely than I have will let us know where to get it (I 
recall there was some discussion of putting it on a web site).

As for seeing more...I\'ll have to ask and get back to you about that.

As I understand it, the next version of the T4 main book will be more 
like version 1.1 than 2.0.  A bug fix.

I don\'t know for certain, though, whether there will be 
additional/changed artwork, or additional equipment, etc.  I\'ll have to 
ask.  I\'ll let you know.

Yup, the delay has put IG in a bind.  Pray for no printer delays! :)

I don\'t know.  I\'d be happy to ask Ken Whitman, but perhaps one of the 
folks here who has experience in the gaming industry can answer this.

Questions about IG and IG\'s products should be directed to me, as I\'ve 
previously noted.  If I know the answer, I\'ll reply right away.  If I 
don\'t, I\'ll write it on my big list o\' questions for Ken Whitman, get in 
touch with him as soon as possible, and then relay the answer back.

In addition, Guy "Wildstar" Garnett, author of the QSDS system, major 
contributor to the Role-Playing Ship Combat System, and all-around 
gearhead/technical expert has consented to help me out on technical 
questions (which, being a non-gearhead, are way out of my league[G]).  
When such questions come up, I\'ll forward them to Guy, who will respond 
to both the questioner and me (that way I get an education as well[G]).

So, to sum up:  All questions should go to me (and/or the list, if you 
want - just be sure to make it clear that you want an "official" answer, 
please).  I\'ll then either answer right away, or get an answer to you by 
referring the question to the appropriate expert.

I think that\'ll be least confusing, and most efficent for everyone 
involved. 

Oh, and one final note:  My parents are coming here (Illinois) from 
California on Saturday, and will be staying until Wednesday evening.  
Because of this, I\'ll be a bit less communicative for the next five 
days.  Thereafter, though, I have four days off with no major plans, so 
I\'ll be able to catch up (if it turns out that there is a backlog over 
that time).  In any event, I do plan to sign on once a day while my 
parents are here...I just won\'t be able to spend much time online when I 
do.

I liked it too.  Both Rob\'s and Leonard\'s method handle the
Attribute really well, but both give *very* low target numbers.  My
Aptitude idea is going to take time to work up and the numbers it produces
are going to be higher..I\'ll target them at the 1d, 2d, 3d, 4d, 5d, 6d
range.

Other than that I would like to voice my total support of IG with T4.  I\'ve
had the game for three weeks now I am definatly going to love it.  Hopefully
Starships and the Central Supply Catalog will come out soon to follow up on
this.  As far as the typo\'s I can live with them.  It\'s not like IG set out
to do it and besides they are trying to get out as much of the errata as
they can.  In addition, as far as the artwork.  Well, some comments have
been made to the different look of various starships and weapons.  For the
starships I would say "SO WHAT!" its not like theirs only one design for
each starcraft.  And as for the weapons I would like to point a few things
out.  The titles listed by each illustration don\'t mentino specifacly the
model or type being depicted.  So just maybe that tapering 4mm SMG is a 4mm
SMG not the 9mm most seem to assume it is. And that wrist breaking FOIL.
I\'m not sure but it looks like to me that the hand gaurd pointing to he
bottom of the page seems to curve.  So if you were to use the foil the one
side would lie in front of your knuckles and the other would curve around
the outside of your wrist (in such a way it would\'t really interfere).  Just
my thoughts on the various subjects.  

Boy a little rant can go a long ways :)  I mean no disrespect nor do I say
any of this out of anger.  Just another opinion to fuel the discussion.

Dear Traveller Afficionados,
 
I\'ve  noticed some  speculation over  the past  few weeks  on the
mailing lists pertaining to DGP\'s future role in Traveller, and I
thought you might appreciate an update...
 
DGP has been  in negotiations with the managers  of Traveller for
almost 10 months. Those guys sure are busy.
 
Even though  I\'m not as enthusiastic  as I was 10  months ago, it
looks like a deal may be able to be worked out. Keep your fingers
crossed.
 
We are seeking  a renewal of DGP\'s Traveller  license, so that we
can rerelease  our extensive Traveller archives  in various forms
as  well as  produce brand  new Traveller  works for  your gaming
pleasure. We love  sci-fi, and we look forward  to being involved
in Traveller development once again  and working with Marc Miller
and Imperium Games.
 
Wish us luck!
 
I\'ll keep you posted.
 
Sincerely (floating somewhere in limbo),
 
    Rodge
 
Roger Sanger

P.S.:  Out of  curiosity, which  of DGP\'s  publications were your
absolute favorites?
 
What  in particular  did you  like about  DGP\'s works compared to
other game supplements?                                        RS

My comment about DGP, canon etc. was to establish something...
It is an opinion. It is mine. I am stating it. Nothing more...
Now, what attracted me to Traveller was the detail of the universe. Immense, rich detail.
A string of numbers for a planet and you can make an adventure from that. I didn\'t need 
to generate thousands of worlds, they were already done. I could just wing it from a 
string of digits. There were aspects of the universe that were described in loving detail 
(spread out but still there) and these provided more threads.Here was a universe of 
adventure, all you had to do was add adventurers, a plot and go. Traveller was a 
consistent, explicable universe. Forgive an nostalgic rant, but I love _that_ universe. I 
don\'t want a universe where everybody makes their own stats. I can do that on my own. 
I want Traveller for the exquisite background.

Well, the best thing that I\'ve seen on the TML is Glenn Hoppe\'s notes on jumpspace (but 
that\'s only because I had a religious experience when I read it) and all of the 
discussion about fixing the task system (which really needs fixing). 

But, I have to agree with Simon on this post as well.  When ever I see character 
generation rules or planet/system details, I always download/print it for my campaing.  
When I see full blown adventures, I\'m ecstatic.  

This is like getting game supplements for free, and it is that much less work for me to 
do on my own game.

I\'m all for people posting things that directly involve the game--adventures, careers, 
planet or system details.  We should see more of this on the list.

Kenneth.

I have always wanted to see an \'official\' version of the uniforms for the various 
Imperial service branches as well.  It has been my experience that the uniform depends 
on who is drawing the picture, and I have seen the same artist draw uniforms in 
different ways.  Except for the occasional reference, like in V&V about the Imperial 
naval uniforms being influenced by vilani designs, I have never seen anything definitive 
on this.  

If anybody has a reference to \'cannon\' on this particular topic--or just has some home 
grown designs that they would like to share--I\'d like to see them too.

Sincerely,

Kenneth.

Do let me know what you think. If you object to any of the details, such as
my handling of the effect of stats and skills, you are free to alter them
as you like if you want to use this system. I\'ve tried many different
versions, and I suggest that the skill effects are correctly balanced here.
But the stat effects are easily customizable according to taste. In fact,
the base target numbers aren\'t set in stone either.

Do let me know what you think.

             The 2D Task System

          A simple task roll system
   compatible with Marc Miller\'s Traveller (T4)

This system uses a simple roll of two dice to determine task success or
failure. No more rolling a half-dozen dice, no more half-dice, and no more
skewed probabilities in the higher stat+skill levels. Best of all, no pesky
bell curve! And skill levels count for more than stat points. It combines
many of the advantages of a percentile system with the traditional D6-only
system of CT/MT/T4; thus little or no conversion is necessary.

The task roll is two dice in succession, providing a two-digit number
between 11 and 66 (just like the old CT Trade table).

The base target number is determined by the Difficulty Level:

Difficulty Level   Base Target #
   Impossible           00
   Staggering           10
   Formidable           20
   Difficult            30
   Average              40
   Easy                 50
   
The base target number is modified by the PC\'s skill and then by the
corresponding characteristic.

Each skill level adds 2 to the target number. Thus the skill modifier is
(skill*2). For 0-level skill tests, don\'t halve the characteristic (as in
T4). Instead, increase the Difficulty by one level (by simply adding 1 to
the first digit of the base target number).

There are two suggested methods for determining the inflence of
characteristics (other methods are possible):

1) Only above-average characteristics have an influence: for each point
above 7, add 1 to the base target number. Thus the stat modifier is:
(stat-7) for stats above 7; otherwise no modifier. (This may be preferable
at low skill levels.)

2) Above- *and* below-average characteristics effect the target number: for
each point below 7, subtract 1 from the target number; for each point
above, add 1. Thus the stat modifier is -(7-stat) for stats below 7, and
+(stat-7) for those above 7.

NOTE, however, that these modifiers are not added in base-10. The modifiers
are counted as steps up or down the 11-66 matrix:

     <----down        up---->
01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 
21, 22, 23, 24 etc...

Example: a character with Skill 3 and Stat 9 is attempting a Difficult
task. The base target is 30. He adds 6 for the skill (3*2=6) + 2 for the
above-average stat (9-7=2), for a modifier of 6. The result is not 38, as
it would be in base-10, because 38 doesn\'t exist on the matrix. Instead, he
counts 8 steps up the matrix (starting where 30 would be); so the actual
target number is 42-.

If this seems complicated, it won\'t be after you\'ve tried it a few times.
It soon becomes intuitive and quick. To save time, target numbers modifiers
for major skills can be pre-calculated by the players, before the game
begins. Adjusting for Difficulty Level is a simple matter of altering the
first digit of the target number.

For 0-level skill tests, don\'t halve the characteristic (as in T4).
Instead, increase the Difficulty by one level (by simply adding 1 to the
first digit of the base target number).

Each increase in skill level represents an equal increase in probability of
success. That is, the probability difference between skill 6 and 7 is the
same as that between 1 and 2. (Only 0-level skills break this pattern.)

Notice that, initially, Impossible tasks really are impossible: you can\'t
roll less than 11! Only with skill and stat modifiers do these tasks become
barely possible, short of a spectacular success.

As always, a roll of two sixes is a spectacular failure, and two ones is a
spectacular success - even if the target number is below 11. The referee
may also rule that all tasks have a minimum target number of 12 (except for
0-level skill tests).

Here\'s a chart to showing the resulting targets for an average stat
(ignoring for the moment the Spectacular Result rules and the optional
Minimum Target Number rule):

Stat= 7                      Skill
              0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7  
Easy         42    52    54    56    62    64   Auto  Auto  
Average      32    42    44    46    52    54    56    62
Difficult    22    32    34    36    42    44    46    52
Formidable   12    22    24    26    32    34    36    42
Staggering   02    12    14    16    22    24    26    32 
Impossible   --    02    04    06    12    14    16    22

For each stat point above 7, add 1 to these Target numbers.
For each stat point below 7, subtract 1 (optional).
(OR choose your own method of applying stat mods.
Note how easy it is to extrapolate values for higher or lower stats,
skills, or Difficulty Levels. The progressions are perfectly regular.

Probabilities:

Easy        59.4  70.2  75.6  81.0  86.4  91.8 100.0 100.+  %   
Average     37.8  54.0  59.4  64.8  70.2  75.6  81.0  86.4  %
Difficult   21.6  37.8  43.2  48.6  54.0  59.4  64.8  70.2  %

Impossible   --    --    --    --    5.4   8.1  16.2  21.6  %

Bump these figures up by 2.7 if Spectacular Success rule is applied.
When the Minimum Target Number rule is applied, the dashes become "5.4"
(except for 0-level skill use).

Compared with T4, in this system certain attempts are harder, and others
easier. But most importantly, PCs with high skills or attributes are not
super-powerful. Characters become more competent with each level, but
Difficult tasks rarely become a complete cake-walk, while Impossible tasks
always pose some danger of failure. For instance, a PC with skill 5 and
stat F, attempting a Difficult task, must roll 64- (91%); it becomes
automatic only if his skill rises to 6; for an Impossible task he needs
56-. Still not a sure thing, even for him.

In general, most DMs given in the rule books will have a lessened effect on
the results, though they will still be important. The referee may wish to
amplify certain DMs, depending on the situation.

Because this system resembles a percentile system, the referee has more
precise control over the target numbers - it\'s much easier to have a clear
idea of the chances of success, and of how a DM is going to effect them. It
is also easier to understand, for instance, the difference between a
Formidable task and a Staggering one.

If you have trouble adding the modifiers to the base target numbers, you
might want to print out the matrix - perhaps placing it in the margin of
your character sheets, on your combat table page, or referee screen - and
use it to easily count up or down. This method should quickly become
redundant, however, as you become familiar with the system. Skipping from
"26" to "31" as you count up becomes a matter of habit.

- ----
Well, that\'s the system.

I\'m beginning to wonder if the percentages aren\'t too "difficult". Perhaps
I should bump the base numbers up by 10? Thus, Impossible would be 10,
Staggering 20, Formidable 30, etc. (Though this will make things much
easier for PCs with high stats and skills)...

Please do try the system out and let me know if it makes any sense to you.

Thanks,

Glenn

Question for you.  When you did your conversions, did you just alter the amount of 
skills a character can get in a term (i.e. 1 per year instead of 1 per term), or did you 
make other changes?

1) Congratulations/condolences to Joe Walsh for landing the "Liaison" 
position.  The rationale for the first should be obvious, but I can\'t help
feel sorry for someone who\'s obviously going to be flooded with mail.
Thanks for the IG Mini-FAQ, too.

2) Marc Miller\'s Milieu 0 Outline: Looks like good stuff.  I think that 
the already-posted reactions have pretty much covered all of the
uncertainty-bases that I would have remarked on.  Shipping Dec 15?  That 
probably (I\'m just guessing here) won\'t get it in stores in time for XMas,
but we might see it in time for those big post-XMas shopping bashes (for 
those of us who get cash-gifts).

3) Jump-time Theories:  This thread was dear to me (after all, some of the
posts had my name in the subject line!) and I\'m glad to see that it was
peacably resolved in my absence.  I liked Glenn Hoppe\'s (hope I got that 
right!) proposed rationale/soultion except for one question it raises to
me:  are we to assume that all the major races individually came up with
"cooling" systems that had identical (1-week-lag) efficiency on their own
thousands of years ago, or is it possible that long ago some races were
"better" (ie- faster) than others, but that now the technology has been
spread evenly throughout Charted Space?  And also, how likely is the second
case to be true?  After all, not all the Major Races have achieved TL-15,
even though the (1100-era) Imperium has).
     Andy Lilly posted an illustrative theiry for how jump-space works that
he claimed he uses to explain it to beginners, and, while the theory
itself seems pretty useful, it also seems WAY too abstract and complicated
to be using on beginners, unless they\'re all mathematicians and/or 
scientists.  I\'ve been playing Traveller for years and even I had to read
through it a couple of times to figure it all out.
     Someone (sorry, lost the post) pointed out some social/economic/military
consequences of the proposed "faster at lower j-levels" theory that seemed
to confirm my lingering suspicions (to very briefly summarize: faster
travel of short distances will lead to tighter small-scale bonding and
(I may be exaggerating here) cause societies to fragment into many small-
to medium-sized "clusters"; also the business with fleet-tactics, and the
fact that it becomes MUCH more profitable to equip your ship (ANY ship) with
as high j-level engines as possible (which doesn\'t jibe with the 20 years 
worth of pre-gen ships we\'ve seen).  I know that everyone\'s become friends
and that this is a non-debate now, but I missed the chanc to get my word in
and say that these are the kinds of potential changes that I suspected such
a wanton rule-change would make.

   There were also lots of other messages, but I tended to skim/skip those
so I don\'t have any comments there.  

Hoping this list will slow back down to a more manageable level,

I agree with this.  I want to keep the math (and the steps necessary for a fix, for that 
matter) to a minimum.  As I sift through all of the ideas posted to TML and play with 
the system, I am finding that some math may be necessary.  If the final result is a \'fix 
formula\', then it should be easy to calculate all target numbers for each skill a 
character has one time and record those on the character\'s sheet.  There shouldn\'t be 
any math at all to do during game play.

		
	UPDATE TO KEN\'S TASK FIX...KEN\'S 10 GOALS FOR THE NEW TASK SYSTEM


Since I seem to be nominated the team leader on this task fix project (Uh, er, thanks, 
Joe, I think), here is an update on the progress on the new system.

First, I have outlined some goals for the system.  Joe\'s questionaire really helped in 
putting these thoughts together.

1.  The new system should be an easy fix to the T4 system--meaning there should be 
minimal steps involved in getting the percentages and target numbers where we need them 
to be.

2.  To accomplish goal #1, above, the new system should either alter the target number 
or alter the difficulty system, but not both.  We are trying to fix the current T4 
system--not write a new one.

3.  My focus is on altering the target number (see goal #2).  I know many of you want to 
see the half die go (as long as we are bothering to fix the system--I\'m not that fond of 
the half die either), but I have realized why IG used it in the first place.  It gives a 
more flat curve.  
    
I looked hard at Trent Smith\'s 
1-die-for-easy-2-dice-for-average-3-dice-for-difficult-4-dice-for...system, but the 
curve is just too steep for our purposes.  I liked this system because the staggering 
and impossible numbers were consistently staggering and impossible to hit, but the other 
side of the curve was the same way.  All of the early target numbers were just too hard 
to make, and a character would not have much of a chance with all of his level one 
skills.

    The half die system of difficulty used in T4 presents a more flat curve--giving the 
lower target numbers a more fair chance of success.  The problem is that we also end up 
with characters being able to make an impossible throw 44% of the time (which, as I 
recall, is what started this mess in the first place).  By altering the target numbers 
and limiting the high end, we should be able to come up with a system that incorporates 
minimal changes and produces the types of percentages that we are looking for.  Paul 
Walker defined the problem early.  It is not the difficulty system--it\'s the high target 
numbers.

4.  The new system should decrease the importance of abilities but still make them a 
major modifier to a character\'s skill level.  The "I\'ve got Dex 10 and Pilot-1, and 
you\'ve only got Dex 4 and Pilot-6, so I should pilot the ship" problem should be 
addressed and fixed to give more weight to skills.

5.  Skill level should be the biggest component of a target number.  See the pilot 
example above.

6.  I really like Eris\' proposed aptitude system, but upon first glance, I thought that 
it was beyond the scope of what we were trying to do here.  I saw mucho problems 
defining what the various aptitude levels were and how much they should affect success 
on a throw.  Then I figured out an easy way to use them without going to all that 
trouble.  The prototype task system that I am working on now includes character 
aptitude.

7.  The task system should be better than the one used in MT.  This was, in my opinion, 
a very good system, but it could use some improvements.  By \'better\', I mean that the 
new task system should be easier to use (as the T4 system was originally designed), 
provide even better probabilities (the MT system really drops after difficult), and make 
character abilities more important to the throw (instead of just providing a +1, +2, or 
+3 DM to the throw).

8.  The impossible difficulty should be watched to see if it provides too great a chance 
of success.  Right now, I\'m shooting for an ultimate character (Ability-15, Skill-7, and 
the highest aptitude score) to have a one in three or one in four chance of success with 
the impossible.  Average character ability, skill, and aptitude should provide a 10% or 
less chance of success.

9.  All work-in-progress should be checked against a normal-joe character.  I\'m using a 
character from my own campaign as a base line.  I picked this guy because he has a good 
range of low, medium, and high stats and skills.  This guy\'s stats may be a little low 
(average ability score is 6), but he was generated with the T4 system and is 
representative of a standard Traveller character.

    May I introduce Ulric Birtran Harrisani:
	
			SKILL		LEVEL	GOV CHAR
	----
	STR 7		HISTORY		1	EDU
	DEX 7		LONG BLADE	1	DEX OR STR
	END 3		COMPUTER	4	EDU OR INT
	INT 9		GRAV CRAFT	1	DEX
	EDU 6		TRADER		4	INT OR SOC
	SOC 6		CAROUSING	1	SOC
			LIASON		1	INT OR EDU OR SOC
			BROKER		1	INT OR EDU
			VAC SUIT	1	DEX
			ADMIN		1	SOC OR EDU



10.  The low end of the scale should be watched so that characters with level one skills 
(actually, most characters have a majority of level one skills) do not get hit with 
unrealistic (and unfun to play) low chances of success.


I want to come up with a good, playable task fix that is not only desirable too myself, 
but is preferred by all of you out there who don\'t like the problems in the T4 system.  
Joe Walsh has suggested that I send this in to IG when we are done in the hopes that it 
will be printed as an optional rule in an upcoming supplement.  I think that this is a 
great idea, and I want to get this thing right.

Please look over the above goals and post any comments that you might have.  I\'ll be 
posting a prototype task system that we can all beat around, and play with, soon.

Regards to all,

Kenneth.

DGP stuff was hands down the best stuff ever produced for Traveller.  I\'ve said in a 
recent post that GDW may have invented the wheel, but DGP made it roll.  I own 
everything DGP ever produced for Traveller.

As for what did I like in particular?  Well, that\'s hard to say because everything was 
so good.  I liked the detail in the Starship Op Manual.  I liked the fleshed out 
adventures complete with NPC stats, maps, deckplans, and full systems described for the 
whole adventure.  I liked the flow chart system.  Heck, the interior/exterior art even 
beat the pants off of any other company\'s products.

If you keep up the quality and design of your previous materials, you\'ve got a customer 
that will buy every product you produce.

Sincerely,

Kenneth Bearden.

Better chech with Joe on this, but I thought I read (in all the hoop-la before T4 came 
out) that the catalog will contain EVERY item ever published in a GDW adventure or 
supplement.  Hmm.  Maybe I saw this on IG\'s web page, and maybe I\'m wrong all together.

    'body' => '     I really like the 10 "Foundations of Fixing the T4 Task System" that 
were just posted (another list-development from the 2 days (not a week, not
a month, 2 days!) that I was gone-- this discussion\'s become Organized!) but
I have a couple of comments to make:

1) For starters, I don\'t want to take credit away from whomever it was that
first suggested the progressive whole-die difficulty scale, I was just
repeating what someone else had suggested earlier when I mentioned it a few
days back.
   About the perceived weakness of this system (that it makes easy tasks
too hard): I don\'t understand where you\'re coming from.  An "Average" task
under T4 and in the "whole-die" system is 2D, so the difficulty should be 
exactly the same (disregarding changes in target-number determination).  I
suppose you\'re objecting to the 3D vs 2.5D at "Difficult", but Joe Average
with stat 7 skill 2 (target=9) will still succeed a little less than 50% of
the time (soory I don\'t have an exact number handy), comparable to the MT 
system where the same character (DM +3, target 11+ on 2D) has ~35% chance of 
success.  Since I\'ve been using the equivalent difficulty of tasks in MT as
my base-line, this seems pretty good to me.  

2) My second concern is the bit about making the system "work" for characters
with level-1 skills.  In the experience with generating T4 characters so
far (I\'ve made about a half-dozen) I\'ve found that each of them ends up
with a few high-level skills (maybe a level-4, a couple of level-3s) several
level-2 skills (3 or 4) and a bunch of level-1s (at least 6).  The way I
see it, the high-level ones are the character\'s "specialty", and the lower
level ones are things he\'s just dabbled in or has a little rudimentary
knowledge of.  This isn\'t CT where you\'ll end up with your "Other" 
character who\'s got 4 skills at level-1 and nothing else.  T4 characters
are designed to be much more versatile than their CT predecessors.  Rather
than make the mistake (as in Books 4-7) of making multi-skilled characters
much more powerful, I think we should subtly redefine exactly how much 
knowledge is contained in a skill "level".  I\'d say that a level-1 CT skill
should be worth a level 2-3 T4 skill (based on the time it takes to
obtain the skills and the ability of the typical PC) and that L-1 T4 skills
are really closer to CT "level 0".  The point of all this meandering is 
that I don\'t think level-1 skills really need to grant all that good a 
chance of success on their own (without counterbalancing high stats). If we
bend over backwards to make it so, then we\'ll have an even harder time
"balancing" the system for higher skill-levels, keeping in mind that most
T4 characters are going to have at least one or two skills in the 3-4 range
and that even higher levels probably won\'t be too rare (since none of the
characters I\'ve generated could in any way be considered "super", and none 
of them chose (except from clusters) any of their skills).
    Ack!  I just realized something while I was yping the above paragraph.
If, as I\'m suggesting, we "devalue" skill levels, then we don\'t need to
worry as much about increasing their importance vis a vis stats.  I\'ll have
to give this some more thought...

Roger, it\'s difficult to have a favorite; I loved it all! I am leaning
toward the Alien products because they added so much background info. As
for your second question, I\'d have to say overall quality of the product
and the breadth of the material. The idea of tracking a journey across
the Imperium was brilliant! The task and nugget systems vastly improved
my campaigns as did the form for equipment. DGP had as much, if not
more, effect on the direction and "look" of Traveller as GDW. If things
go well with your negotiations and DGP can put out the same class of
material, I\'ll be a customer for life!

I just had an interesting (and perhaps evil thought :-) perhaps he\'s a 
clone. I know that cloning is a possiblity in the Traveller 
universe, but only at high tech levels. Can you do it a tl12. Perhaps he 
was a researcher into the ancients stumbled into a cloning chamber and 
suddenly there were 16 of him. Who then started to argue about who get to 
claim the credit for the discovery, they now only talkthrough their mutal 
lawyers.

EVERY LAST ONE!!  I was always impressed with DGP\'s stuff!  If I must narrow

justice to all the great stuff in the Digests and so on.  It just kept

Thoroughness.  Depth.  Detail.  Creativity.  Artwork.  Everything.  DGP\'s 
books really got me excited about Traveller, and they were great reading 
too!  DGP books always seemed to flesh out parts of Traveller I wanted to 
see fleshed out the most.

	But as this formular makes jump shorter, we decided to extend
	the save jump from 100 diameters to size*size*10 light seconds.

	So a full jump (j2 for a Jayhawk) would take longer than a week
	while a half jump would take a bit shorter.

	You can use the same formular with TPlates :

	Eg. a ship jumping from a A planet to an 7 planet would
	accellerate 14 hours, drift 11 hours, jump, and decelerate
	14 hours. If the ship hadnt drift it would crash in the
	smaller planet, or had to fly some loops arount.

	If these two planets are 2 parsec away it would need 8.5 days
	(207 hours) if they are one parsec away it would need 5.1 days
	(123 hours) for the trip.

whether this was noted in the edited copy of T4 that you sent to IG:
       
        The COSTS of the Helnet and Diplo Armor is not mentioned in the text
on page
76. As there is no Armor Table (which would fit nicely in the blank space on
page 80 under the weapons list, by the way), these costs are not available.
What is the cost of the Helmet and of Diplo Armor?

        And now, a comment; PLEASE encourage IG to at least allow DGP to
re-release the materials they have in their archives on CD-ROM or even
(hopefully) in print. In fact, I\'d like to see the classic GDW stuff
rereleased as well. It could be called "THE TRAVELLER ARCHIVES". It wouldn\'t
even be neccesary to update it to the new game. Put it out as is for those
of us who would like to own the old stuff. DGP could release this stuff
under the auspices of IG, and if they\'re worried about compatibility, a
disclaimer could be included thus:

        "This work was produced for [insert edition of Traveller here]. The
information contained in this work may not be consistent with the official
Traveller Universe as produced by FarFuture Enterprises and Imperium Games."

        I\'d like to see the DGP stuff put out again because it would make it
MUCH cheaper in the long run to get that stuff, and it was great stuff! A
lot of that information would be very useful to me. IG and it\'s other
licensees can support the "Current" Traveller; DGP can be our archivists.

    'topic' => 'Possible Solution for Starship Economics Problems',
    'body' => 'I just worked out the stats for a basic no-frills 1G, J1 1000 ton merchie
(no weapons, no refining), all cargo and no passenger capacity - leaves
757 tons of space for cargo, and the damn thing *still* can\'t run at less
than 72% and even "break even" at 1000 Cr per ton. To run and break even
at 60% capacity, it has to charge 1210 Cr per ton of cargo.

There *is* however, an elegant solution to the problem that doesn\'t
require major tinkering ... it involves a modification to the Starship
acquisition procedure that most PCs will follow ... that is, getting it as
a roll on the Benefit table.

Now, since the minimum time it takes to get such a result (a roll of 7,
which requires the +1 only available with an O5 rank or greater) is ten
years, it appears *on the face of it* reasonable to make the assumption
that Traveller has always made that the ship the character has is 10 years
old and was bought new as, as it states, financing is difficult to get for
older ships.

It is *possible* (tho unlikely) to roll the same benefit *three times* and
get what we have always been told is a 30 year old ship ... all at a
minimum age of 38!!!

OK. Do *you* know any bank in creation that will lend an 8 year old 32 MCr
(around 64 million US$ if previous hints are correct) on no collateral
other than the ship he buys with it? *I*, for one, don\'t ... but if *you*
do, lemme know where! I have this great little bizness proposition for
them!

If you delink the roll on the table and the age of the ship you get a
better possible outcome. 

Consider this. The biggest component in running a Starship is the Loan
Repayment. This is 1/240th of the value each month for 480 months (40
years). This means that a 38 year old Captain can have a 30 year old ship
and *still* be paying 1/240th of the value of it - even tho we\'re told
financing a second hand vessel is difficult - as if *he* bought it 30
years before, at age 8. Obviously not on. Sorry, won\'t wash.

So, what I suggest is this. Each time a ship is rolled, it indicates that
*somehow* the new owner has managed to acquire 1/4 (around 8 MCr) worth of
*equity* in a *new* version of said ship ... and that Repayments are based
on the *remainder*.

So, a Free Trader @ 30.75 MCr gained once would actually represent a
*loan* of only 23.0625 MCr ... and monthly repayments of only 96094 Cr
rather than 128125 Cr if the whole price was financed. This reduces the
monthly operational costs to 154094 Cr, rounding to around 170,000 Cr
(allowing a buffer for yearly maintenance and unforseen problems), or
30000 Cr less than it would otherwise cost in my previous calculations.

So, with 120 usable tons on the stock FT model the cost per commercially
usable ton is now 1417 Cr.

On a line item basis, this translates to -

1 High Passage Cabin + 1 ton Cargo space = 20000 Cr income; 7085 Cr cost.
Profit = 12915 Cr.
1 Middle Passage in HP Cabin = 16000 Cr income; 5668 Cr cost. Profit =
10332 Cr.
1 Low Passage = 2000 Cr income; 1417 Cr cost. Profit = 583 Cr.
1 ton Cargo = 2000 Cr income; 1417 Cr cost. Profit = 583 Cr.

Can she operate profitably on a 50-60% loadout in each category?

High Passage x 6: Cost = 42510 per month. Running with three staterooms
occupied at all times produces 60k Cr, a profit of 17490 Cr.
Middle Passage x 6: Cost = 34008 Cr per month. Running with 3 staterooms
occupied at all times produces 48k Cr, a profit of 13992 Cr.
Low Passage x 20: Cost = 28340 Cr per month. Running with 12 Berths
occupied at all times produces 24k Cr, a loss of 4340 Cr per month. Actual
cost of Low Passage would have to be 1181 Cr.
Cargo x 76 tons: Cost = 107692 Cr per month. Running 60% full (46 tons)
produces 92k Cr, or a shortfall of 15692 Cr. Actual cost of Cargo should
be 1171 Cr per ton.

So, no she can\'t. However, if we assume that (somehow) the Captain gained
8 MCr equity in a 10 year old ship (worth 75% of its new cost), he
effectively has payments on only 15.375 MCr ... or monthly repayments of
only 64063 Cr, dropping operational expenses to around 135000 Cr, or a
cost per usable ton for a stock FT model of 1125 Cr per commercially
usable ton.

On a line item basis, this translates to -

1 High Passage Cabin + 1 ton Cargo space = 20000 Cr income; 5625 Cr cost.
Profit = 14375 Cr.
1 Middle Passage in HP Cabin = 16000 Cr income; 4500 Cr cost. Profit =
11500 Cr.
1 Low Passage = 2000 Cr income; 1125 Cr cost. Profit = 875 Cr.
1 ton Cargo = 2000 Cr income; 1125 Cr cost. Profit = 875 Cr.

Can she operate profitably on a 50-60% loadout in each category?

High Passage x 6: Cost = 33750 Cr per month. Running with three staterooms
occupied at all times produces 60k Cr, a profit of 26250 Cr.
Middle Passage x 6: Cost = 27k Cr per month. Running with 3 staterooms
occupied at all times produces 48k Cr, a profit of 21k Cr.
Low Passage x 20: Cost = 22500 Cr per month. Running with 12 Berths
occupied at all times produces 24k Cr, a *PROFIT* of 2500 Cr per month!
Cargo x 76 tons: Cost = 85500 Cr per month. Running 60% full (46 tons)
produces 92k Cr, or *PROFIT* of 6500 Cr.

Ergo, it *is* possible to run the ship at break even for around 60%
capacity *and* keep the "standard" 1000 Cr per ton cargo shipping cost!

So, the solution, each roll of "Starship" on a the Merchant Benefit Table
represents 8 MCr equity in a *new* starship, which may be increased to 16
MCr equity in an older starship (at 10 years of age added each time this
alternative is used). This would mean that a Captain who was quite lucky
could own a 20 year old stock FT *outright* after two rolls of "Starship"
on the table.

Assume that the incredible luck of rolling a "Starship" result three times
means that you can take a 10 year old ship that is owned *outright* ... or
a twenty year old one that has up to 8 MCr worth of improvements to it.

In this situation, there is *absolutely* no reason why you should have to
take a stock FT. There\'s no reason why the 8 MCr equity couldn\'t be used
to purchase a different vessel ... but adding an extra 8 MCr for age would
not necessarily make the vessel 10 years old, it would depend on the
actual cost of the vessel.

For example, 8 MCr equity could be used to buy a 1000 ton Free Trader (J1,
M1, no weapons or refining, worth 94 MCr. It would mean that the new
"owner" would only own around 3.4 years worth of it, or 6.8 years worth if
he takes the 16 MCr "age for equity" option. Payments would be based on
either a loan of 86 MCr or of 78 MCr depending.

Makes the whole system much more flexible without putting the players into
a deep financial hole!

Oh, and before you complain that its "unrealistic" for a character to have
amassed that sort of money in a potentially quite short time, well, even
the old rule was quite unrealistic if you take that as a criteria. All it
means is that the character probably speculated on his own behalf in the
starship he was employed on - and made a killing (probably a couple!)
along the way. Unlikely, perhaps, but not impossible!

And the huge advantage is that it makes the system work for PCs.

Without a doubt, my favourite product was the World Builder\'s Handbook -
had both of the original two part products and bought *two* copies of the
reprinted single volume second edition.

As for the rest, well, none of it overly impressed me, mainly because I
thought the Task System of MTrav sucked in a major way and this coloured
my opinion of products that used it. Also, I disliked some of the weirder
developments like (IIRC) the "sparklers" ... many of which I heard of only
second hand as DGP distribution to Oz was virtually nonexistent towards
the end (and not good even at the best of times ... I got both copies of
WB V2.0 from o/s sources (Games of Berkeley, as I recall) for example.

What *did* I like about DGP - the (mostly) workmanlike illustrations, but
not the crappy Mac generated ones that appeared in a lot of the earlier
stuff. The completeness ... even when I thought a lot of what was being
written was complete garbage it was at least *complete* complete garbage,
if you get my drift?!

Anyway, I hope to see an updated version of WB "real soon now"!!!

Also, the "AI" game that DGP was working on towards the end sounded
*really* interesting ... I\'d maybe be interested in that, too.

Good luck,

Phil McGregor

My absolute favourite was Digest #9 (Maps of Capital, lots of history) but
all the Megatraveller Journal issues were great. Least liked was 101 Robots
as the designsystem didn\'t agree with me so I couldn\'t use the designstats
and the illos where awful except a few.
I always thought that MT was the (still is) the best version of Traveller
but when I look at my reasons for thinking so I realise that what I liked
about MT was the DGP stuff produced for it. GREAT artwork generally and
good editing and layout.
In depth facts and no 20th century yank in-jokes destroying the feel like TNE.

BTW As I write this there\'s a 70% solar eclipse going on out my window,
kind of reminds me that I live in a solarsystem.

If the analogy tunnel through earth isn\'t entirely straight the time will
vary, the same is true if the planet doesn\'t have homogenous density even
if it\'s spherically symmetrical. Feel free to translate this into j-space

Sorry. The "0805" location is relative to the Egryn subsector, only - I just

updated to the new game.  It would sell to a wider audience than just

The best argument in favor of reprinting/rereleasing it, is of course 
that it would put that much more Traveller material on the shelves, 
making it easier for IG\'s own stuff to compete with the WW, FASA, and 
TSR\'s of the world...

Really, there are several word generators out on the \'Net for 
generating words from the various Traveller languages.

The best that I\'ve seen is Leroy Guatney\'s TrWords...

Has all of the major Traveller languages, and you can easily create 
tables to generate new ones...

50 *sectors*? Subsectors, Shirley?

No, don\'t like that. If people want to ignore or change some of the 
information, fine. No problem with that, I\'ve even done it myself once 
or twice, but a lot of refs simply don\'t have the time (or don\'t want) 
to roll up UWPs for every world of 50 (sub)sectors (and yes, you *do* 
have to do them all, \'cos you can bet your life the players will want to 
go somewhere you didn\'t expect them to). Plus, one of the best things 
about Traveller is the detail and consistency of the background (which 
includes the maps). If I had to pick the most useful Traveller 
supplements ever, #3 and #10 would be high up the list.

You asked for feed back:  It all looks great, but I don\'t like this 
leaving systems blank, like what was done with the Core subsector in the 
main book, at all.  I want to see the new materials support what has 
already been published.  

Besides, there is a lot of room for GMs to detail and customize a star 
system even if the stats of the main planet are provided.  In my 
campaigns, I do a lot with a systems outer/inner planets (planets other 
than the main world).  I use the World Builder\'s Handbook and my own 
imagination to fill in the holes. >>

I\'m inclined to think that in Milleu 0, the term "scout uniform" is an oxymoron. Active, 
adventuresome Scouts are rugged individualists, bot uniformed weenies.

I thought the sunburst was red . . . .

This sounds right . . . . with the marines being maroon. I saw this in the MT Imperial

Thanks for asking for permission . . . and you definitely have my bemused blessings to

I\'d have to say that the Alien books were my favorite, although I did enjoy
the Starship Operator\'s Handbook. I never got to see the World Builder\'s
Handbook, but I hear it was excellent.

        DGP\'s supplements showed an attention to detail and quality that was
sorely lacking in GDW\'s own efforts (except for those like the KNIGHTFALL
adventure that DGP actually worked on) at that time. I think, from what I\'ve
seen and heard, that the DGP folks may have lost sight of the fact that
Traveller wasn\'t their game, as  some of the things they did were obviously
not what was originally intended (witness their being declared "unofficial"
these days), but that\'s understandable. They were (and presumably are)
highly creative people; working within someone else\'s paradigm can be
restrictive at times. Still, it definitley appears to me that DGP kept
Traveller alive, and without them there could have been no TNE and T4 down
the line.

I\'d like to see more information about the final days of the Rule of Man:
even minor events, like the late designation of Sylea as a seat of empire,
have reverberations in the "present".  Could there be rival claimants to
Sylea\'s "heritage"?  What were the characteristics of the collapse around
Sylea: war or simple wasting away?  All that will have a definite impact
on the type of environment (ruins, cultures, legends) that scouts and
traders find, even over a millenium later.

>     2. Sylea\'s Rise
>         a. Economic Pressures
>         b. Political Pressures

Likewise, may we have some history on Sylea?  Fragmentary evidence (viz.
the ship names from *Azhanti High Lightning*) would seem to indicate that
the Syleans are a separate subspecies of humaniti -- is this your
conception, or are they purely a Vilani/Solomani mix named after the
colony they inhabit?  I think the minor-race angle has the potential
for a great deal more "chrome" for the setting, as well as some more
political/economic/social excitement as the Syleans try to hold their
own amongst the resurgent Solomani nobility and the re-integrated Vilani.

What was Sylea to the Ziru Sirka?  How did it come to gain enough
prominence to be a governmental seat for the Ramshackle Empire?  Was it a
bureaux headquarters later writ large, a military depot, a noble preserve?
All this, too, will have repercussions as we imagine and develop our
independent versions of the Imperial Capital.  It is a world we may well
be revisiting again and again: let\'s try to create a consistent base for
divergent play groups to build upon.

> 		d. Frank Repzinski XVII

Would I be right to guess that this is a rival claimant as inheritor of
the Rule of Man?  Can you dribble us a few more juicy details?  :-)
		
> 2. Places
> 	a. Terra
> 	b. Vland
> 	c. The Great Rift
> 	d. Sylea
> 	e. Antares

All sound like prime sites to be mentioned and detailed.  Could I suggest,
also, that the Geonee (minor human race) would be a prime "pocket empire"
located between Sylea and Terra?  (I seem to recall a power structure in
Massilia, borne out by a "mixed-bureaux" area on maps of the Vilani
Empire, no doubt due to the importance of an already-developed and
- -industrialized enclave of sophisticated humaniti providing a potent
trade and administrative area.  I bet they lasted through the Long Night
in pretty good shape too!)

> 5. Maps

Amen to those!  I second the call for "moving-frontier" maps: let us see
when and how Sylea was absorbed into the Ziru Sirka, how the Rule of Man
fragmented around it, what the currently-known astropolitical situation
is, and how it relates to Cleon\'s current political/economic/military
thrusts.

> Rules
> 	1. Diplomatic Interactions
> 	2. Player generic Imperials
> 	3. Playing Vilani

4. Playing Minor Humans.  Prior Traveller history has already established
that the area around Vland is rife with Ancient-seeded offshoots of Humaniti.
To me, those subspecies and their interactions and differences are one of
the most exciting parts of the Traveller background.  Please try to make
minor humans an integral part of the early Imperium, when they have the
potential to make such a difference and produce so much color: well-thought-
out, they could completely avoid Star Trek\'s "funny-forehead" syndrome and
instead draw in, for example, fans of Sterling\'s Shaper culture and Brin\'s
Uplift saga.  Humans can be the most exciting aliens!

    'body' => '        We ran into a serious difficulty last night while playing Part 2 of
my "pirates" adventure. It involves the encumbrance rules. The rules state
that a character can carry a number of kilos equal to his Strength and not
be encumbered, or twice that amount and be -1 to all his physical stats.
Members of a military unit can carry three times that amount and be at -2 to
all their stats. (This is on page 59.) So, an average character with Str 7
can carry 7 kg. (about 15 pounds), and the most he can carry is 14 kg.
(about 31 pounds) unless he is in a military unit (it says nothing about
USED to be in a military unit), and then he can carry 21 kg. (or about 46
pounds).
        I think this is a little low. By way of comparison, most characters
in GURPS would have a 10 Str which is average. An average character in GURPS
can carry 20 pounds with no effect, 40 with only slight effect, so on up to
a maximum carry of
200 pounds (for very short distances). A Traveller character STR is
encumbered by carrying a laser rifle even at Str A! Just think what a plasma
rifle would do!
        I suggest two following fixes to this system:

        1.) Use 2xSTR as the basis, allow anyone to carry triple load at -2
to all physical stats (military types may still have the advantage as they
will often be of higher STR than civilians) OR
        2.) base carrying capacity on STR + END. Same limits as above.

The Fatigue Pool can be used to help determine how long a person can carry
weight above their encumbrance level, possibly lose one point for every
round at Double load and 2 points for every round at Triple load.

        Ranged weapons have a Range stat. This is their effective range.
each range has a number associated with it thusly:

                1 Very Short
                2 Short
                3 Medium
                4 Long
                5 Very Long

If a weapon has a range of Short, it can shoot out to the limit of the Short
range band with no penalty (45 meters). A weapon which is fired at a target
beyond it\'s effective range takes a NEGATIVE modifier equal to the range
number; the above pistol shooting at a target at Long range gets a -4 to
it\'s target number. If said weapon is aimed, it gets it\'s inherent accuracy
equal to the Range stat of it\'s weapon (+2), thus reducing that penalty to
- -2. Weapons take no penalty (and get only positive mods if aiming) at any
range equal to or less than their listed Range stat.
       We used this, and it cuts down somewhat on the effect of high
attributes and eliminates the "I can hit this guy at 1500 meters with a Body
Pistol?" effect.

Just what sort of "top speed" do your ships *have*? Consider that the
heat load at .4 AU is dangerous. And you\'ve popped in a *lot* closer.
Subtract the 1.75 g of solar gravity from your drive, and you\'ll find
that it\'d take you *hours* at any "reasonable" acceleration. In other
words, you are toast. :-)

It\'s been a *long* time, but as I recall the equilibrium temp at .1 AU
is above the melting point of damn near everything but tungsten,
graphite, and some carbides. (I was designing a planet to be in an
orbit that close and wanted to know what would be solid, liquid, etc)

Not picking nits. Just rying to get folks to think thru the

Better re-read the fine print. I bet that\'s *equilibrium* temp. That
is, the temp at which you radiate as much as you receive.

Trouble with being reflective is that it cuts down on *emission* as
well as absorbtion. So if you get hot, it\'s harder to get rid of the
heat. That\'s why the inside of termos flasks are reflective. To
*minimize* radiation of heat.

Amen to that!

Of course, unless you have one *hell* of a drive, and g-comp to match,
you\'ll be that close for a long time.

So it needs adjustment. I suppose you could even shift two dice, but
not having the charts, I can\'t say.

As for negative numbers, well, that\'ll teach you stick to things you

True, but I wasn\'t go to try the more complicated orbital mechanics.
You can\'t figure those without some idea of the delta-V available. 

And the delta-V required to get from a close solar orbit to one farther
out is rather large (it\'s the difference in escape velocity at the two
distances)

There is no way that we can detail 20,000 star systems. And I think that just
leaving the UWPs to the computer provides information without substance. The
concept I have is that we WILL detail several areas (the places mentioned in
the Outline). By leaving large expanses blank (specifically within the
territory of the upcoming Imperium) we make it possible for your adventurers
to particpate in defining theteritory.

And as we define some specific worlds (like Spires), you get to decide where
they are placed within a sector or group of sectors.

Uh...I guess it\'s been too long since I revisited my assumptions.  I
switched to something very much like this *way* back in CT days.  It hasn\'t
occurred to me to even *look* at the way the books say to handle this.

Phil, one thing you haven\'t noted is that in many games there will be
several players with 1 or more Ship benefits.  This came up in the very
first game of Traveller I ran in \'77.  I had two players with a +1Merchant
and a third with a +2Scout, and I *obviously* didn\'t want to have 3 ships
running around.  <g> So I made a command decision on the spot, and I\'ve
stuck with it for the last..gee it\'s almost 20 years!

Special Mustering Out Benefit rules:

Merchant Benefit - 6MCR banked toward the purchace/outfitting of a
                   ship.
                   
Scout Benefit    - 3MCR banked toward the purchace/outfitting of a
                   ship, OR the use of a 100 ton Scout/Courier.

TAS Benefit      - TAS membership OR 1MCR banked toward the
                   purchace/outfitting of a ship.
                   
(The banked credit can *only* be spent on the purchase/outfitting of a
ship.  Optionally, vary the amount a couple of million either way depending
on the kind of ship you want the players to end up with.)

After all the players in the group have mustered out they can pool their
banked credit and buy into any kind of ship they want..or can find.  The
players have to roleplay finding a ship, getting a loan for the remainder
of the ship\'s worth, and outfitting/upgrading the ship.

The players can look for an NPC ship owner (TAS, bars, classified ads, or
contacts) that might offer to take on the PC\'s as partners in exchange for
their banked millions.  They can deal with a
shipyard for the purchase or a new or refitted ship.  They can also deal
with "Shady Sid\'s Ships"..ie a Ship broker <g>..to find a "deal" on an
older ship.  There have been a couple of times when the PCs were *really*
lucky and ended up owning a ship free and clear.

As for how they got all that money...I let *them* figure it out and tell
me, if they have to know, but usually they just go with the flow.  

About used ships...  Most of the time the players will buy an *old* ship..a
"fix\'er upper"..from a ship broker or an independent
shipyard.  I\'ve also had the players "salvage/recover" a lost ship, to
which they are granted title for all or most of the purchase price.  The
players never get *new* ships..too expensive, or just not available, and
they know the used ships they end up with will have problems that end up
costing them their credits, they know me! <g>

Oh yes, Ship prices!  I use a 100 year lifetime model for the ships and 50
years for most of their equipment, and depreciate everything straight line
(1%/year for the ship and 2%/year for equipment).  I *know* that\'s not
especially realistic, but it\'s easy.  If you want more realism, use the
"rule of 78\'s" as your depreciation model to drop the worth of ships on a
more realistic curve.

I\'ve found that this technique will get a group into a situation where they
can at least break even.  It\'s important not to make it *too* easy on them,
but their should be valid ecomonic reasons for them to want to be ship
owners, to haul freight,  and transport passengers.  <g> 

Oh, and in my games the *fixed* cargo/passage rates apply only to the
Established Trade Routes where the governments (Imperium, Federation,
local) provide some level of protection and service for commercial
shipping.  Everywhere else, the prices will be higher to reflect the
increased danger and costs of operation.

Discussion?

The *pseudo*-acceleration ranges from 400 to 800g\'s, and they have a fixed
top end of 2,000 to 6,000kps.  Like I said, not your standard tech maneuver

The reason for the very close approach is to make jump inherently

they use coolant, reflective surfaces, and *speed* to burn out of "the

You might want to *ask* if the poster has "thought through" the
consequences of their changes, rather than jumping all over them. <g> I\'m
*sure* you aren\'t just slamming people\'s ideas with your replies, but it
sure reads like that.  Misunderstandings of purpose and intent can be a

How much hiking do you do?  :-)

If I picked people at random off the street (ie: average) and put a
7kg pack, I\'m sure they could do it, but even that would stress them
a little.  40 lbs would make most people off the street a wreak in a
half an hour.  I carry 40lbs. on weekend trips, and I\'m happy to
ditch it when I set up camp and climb with closer to 10lbs.

When I saw it I found the T4 system quite reasonable.  Maybe we
could add a backpacking skill that would negate one of the minuses
for encumberance.  There is some skill involved in walking for
lengths oif time with a pack (particularly down hill).

I don\'t have it in front of me, but how long til you start feeling
the effects?  Again, 40lbs. is a lot (remember, too, that our
average strength of 7 includes males and females, so it might be
more like 8-9 for a male (on average).

Are those listed 7-14-21kgs with *no effect* for the different unit
types?  Hell, I carry a pack a lot, and it still has an effect, even
if it isn\'t a bad weight for me to carry.

This is a first playtest. My campaign isn\'t up and running yet (it\'s a
massive undertaking), so I\'ve only been able to playtest my system a little
bit on my own. I expect it will require some tweaking, if not a complete
overhaul.

When the bugs are worked out I do intend to use it, because I have deep
reservations about T4\'s task system that can\'t be solved by simple
tweaking. I really hate the idea of totalling up a slew of dice for every
skill test; I especially hate half-dice. I don\'t care much if my
percentages closely match the T4 system or even the results of our recent
"probability survey", but I do want something that makes consistent sense
and is easy to use. I can\'t see how this can be achieved using a bell-curve
system.

I certainly understand those who advocate a RQ-style percentile system,
which would indeed make a lot of sense. Except of course that it wouldn\'t
be easy to adapt to T4. I don\'t want my campaign to drift so far from the
canonical Traveller Way that I can no longer make use of the published
materials without a lot of conversions.

I must also put in my vote *against* any system that adds *new* elements to
character generation - such as the "Aptitudes" someone\'s been proposing
here. This sounds to me like TNE-desease: stats, stats, and more stats!
This threatens the elegance of the CT/T4 system. (TNE fans of course will
disagree - that\'s one reason why they\'re TNE fans and I\'m not. Diff\'rent
stimulae for diff\'rent sophonts and all that...)

2-5, +1 if 6-9, -1 if A. Other modifiers can be used too: a +1
for worlds settled or influenced by the Ancients, First
Imperium, or Rule of Man (old colonies or terraforming efforts).
If Stellar Types are being used, an additional modifier for the
suitability of the star might not be a bad idea. Restrict to the
range 0-F.

The resources score can be used to justify settlements on
otherwise inhospitable worlds, and should serve as a positive DM
for population. The rationale is that there is some type of
valuable resource present (which doesn\'t otherwise show on the
UWP), and therefore it is likely that someone has come (despite
the hardship) to exploit it. A suggestion for interpreting
resources scores:

Resource Score          Interpretation
- ----
0                       Barren
1-4                     Poor
5-8                     Moderate
9-C                     Rich
D or greater            Extremely Rich

Poor: Basic chemical diversity necessary to support indigenous
life. Otherwise, no claim to fame.

Moderate: One solid natural-resource industry. Roll on table 10a
of the MegaTraveller Referee\'s Manual. Re-roll 34-54 if life < 4
(see above). Re-roll 65 if life < 5. Re-roll 55-56 if life < 8.
Re-roll 61-64 if life < 9. Re-roll 66 if life < A.

Rich: Two natural-resources industries, one of which commands
strong subsector-wide influence.

Extremely Rich: Three natural-resource industries, one of which
commands sector-wide influence.

Note: The GM should translate natural-resource industries into
their manufacturing/processing (2nd stage) industries as seems
appropriate. See MegaTraveller Referee\'s Manual (pg52) for
possibilities.

Another note: Under this system, the resource statistic is
rolled before the life statistic, and the life statistic is
rolled before the specific industries are determined. A better
method would be to select a resource type (using Table 10a, or
some other source), and roll 1d6. This is the "amount" of this
resource, but not more than the resource score of the world. The
process would repeat until the entire resource score is
accounted for. For example:

Resource score (2D) = 10
1st Resource: #61, Livestock. Amount: 5
2nd Resource: #42, Plants (wood). Amount: 4
3rd Resource: #63, Livestock. Amount: 1 (a 3 was rolled).

So, our hypothetical world produces Livestock at Level 6 (the
two livestock resources add, at the referee\'s discretion), and
Plants (wood) at Level 4.

Comparing all of the scores and types within the subsector and
within the sector will reveal the primary producers of
particular goods.

The Life score can be used to get a "feel" for the native
biosphere, and to gauge whether or not there is a native race to
consider. One suggestion (for a campaign with few advanced
"minor" races) was:

0: Sterile
1: Amino Acids
2: Single-celled organisms
3: Multicellular bacteria
4: Simple vegetation
5: Complex vegetation
6: Microscopic insects & sea life
7: Macroscopic insects
8: Macroscopic sea life
9: Land/Air-based herbivores
A: Land/Air-based predators
B: Large/Complex predators
C: Tool use
D: Fire use
E: Agriculture
F: Symbology (full sentience, TL=0)

D, E, and F may be given higher degrees of technology. While the
use of tools and fire is pretty much a clincher for sentient or
semi-sentient creatures, by the time they are practicing
agriculture the society is pretty much at TL-0.

These distinctions should really be made as part of the details
for the native sentient or semi-sentient race. The exact stage
of development should probably be determined by the referee

People will attain the resources (technology) that they need to
survive, such that those resources are available. If you\'re
really sure that you\'re going to live on Sonthert/Lanth, then
you\'re going to make sure you have the technology to survive on
a near-vacuum planet. (Sonthert, alas, is rated TL3.)

The philosophy of high and low tech worlds living side by side
is also questionable. It can be argued that it\'s possible for a
short duration such as a few decades, or given special political
or social circumstances. But in general, over the course of
centuries, eventually there will either be a leveling process or
the low Technological Level regions will gain in technology.

The counter-argument to Jim\'s 1st Law is that all things are not
equal. Otherwise, why would anyone live in Chicago when they
could move to Hawaii? (Most people would class the latter as
nicer than the former!) The answer is economics. People are too
poor to move, don\'t have skills, have family ties. Moreover, if
there are no jobs at the new planet, who is going to move there?
Equally, the world profiles don\'t tell the whole story. Just
because a place has a "nice" profile - average size, average
atmosphere, average hydrographics -- doesn\'t mean the rest of it
is fun. The planet could be too hot, too cold, inhabited by
vorpal bunnies, or whatever.

It is also possible that "blue-sky" Terra-norm worlds might in
some cases be more difficult to settle than less inviting worlds
- -- there\'ll be life down there, and who knows what might do to
prospective settlers? Vacuum worlds are much more predictable,
and with proper planning might also be easier on the equipment.
So more people might settle there, especially if the colony is
well established -- a vacuum world colony interior can be much
more sophisticated and spacious than, say, Moonbase Alpha.

Jim\'s Modified Main-world Generation Procedure:

Changes from the standard procedure are *italicized*.

World Size. Roll 2d6-2.

Atmosphere Type. Roll 2d6-7+World Size.
if World Size is 0 then Atmosphere Type 0.
confine range to 0-F.

Hydrographics Percentage. Roll 2d6-7+*World Size*.
if Atmosphere Type is 1 or less, then DM -4
if World Size is *1 or less*, then Hydrographics Percentage 0
if Atmosphere Type is A-C then DM -4
confine range to 0-A

Population Exponent. Roll 2d6-2.
*if World Size is 2 or less, DM -1*
*if Atmosphere Type is 3 or less, DM -3*
*if Atmosphere Type is A, DM -2*
*if Atmosphere Type is B, DM -3*
*if Atmosphere Type is C, DM -4*
*if Atmosphere Type is 6, DM +3*
*if Atmosphere Type is 5 or 8, DM +1*
*if Hydrographics Percentage is 0 and Atmosphere Type is 3 or greater, DM -2*
*confine range to 0-A*

Starport Type. Roll 2d6.
*if Population Exponent is 0 then Starport Type X*
*if Population Exponent is 1, DM +2*
*if Population Exponent is 2, DM +1*
*if Population Exponent is 6-9, then DM -1*
*if Population Exponent is A, then DM -2*
*confine range to A-X*

Government Type. Roll 2d6-7+Population Exponent.
*if population exponent is 0 then government 0*
*confine range to 0-F*

Law Level. Roll 2d6-7+Government Type.
*if government type is 0 then law level 0*
*confine lower bound of range to 0*

Technological Level. Roll d6.
Modify as per the standard chart.
*if Population Exponent 0 then Technological Level 0*
*otherwise, if Hydrographic Percentage is 0 or A and Population
Exponent is at least 6, then Technological Level must at least
be 4.*
*if Atmosphere Type is 4, 7 or 9, then Technological Level must
be at least be 5.*
*if Atmosphere Type is 3 or less, or A-C, then Technological
Level must at least be 7.*
*if Hydrographic Percentage is A, then Technological Level must
be at least be 7.*
confine lower bound of range to 0

Note that there are some conspicuous differences between this
data and "normal" UWP listings. There are more uninhabited or
very low-population star systems under the modified rules. This
will probably bring down the average starport rating for any
given region. Also, there are very few low-tech star systems.
The lowest here are both TL4, and in both cases, they\'ve got a
breathable atmospheres. As expected, the less-hospitable worlds
tend to have lower populations and seedier starports. More
surprising is the existence of several lush (atmos=6) worlds
with under ten million inhabitants. The system usually has high
populations clustered on those worlds. However, when we look at
the highest population world in this run, we see that it has a
standard atmosphere, so these results are fairly plausible.

Jeff Zeitlin\'s Theory of Government Technological Interference

It can be argued that law level will have an effect on tech
level. The more oppressive a society is, the less likely it is
that geniuses will appear and create the new technology. Earth
history supports this view; the cultures that made the largest
advances in technology were the ones with high levels of
personal freedom. Certainly, other, less free cultures may do a
better job of exploiting some forms of technology, but they\'ll
probably acquire it from a culture that is more free. One would
hardly expect a totally oppressive theocracy to be innovative...

At No Law, there is no way of ensuring that the person who
develops new technology will be able to profit from it. If
something is good, it will be used by anyone who can get their
hands on it, and without paying. This reduces the incentive to
research.

At Low Law, there may be some protection, so there will be some
innovation. However, the government will normally not be
powerful or influential enough to make large investments in
research; this will offset part of the benefit gained from the
protection afforded intellectual property.

At Moderate Law, you will typically have a government that has
the power, influence, and revenue to invest in research, and
sufficient freedom of information exchange to make it profitable
(in terms of results). However, at this stage, the government
will probably have a tendency to want to direct the research,
rather than dropping the cash on the table, sitting back, and
saying, "O.K. folks, let\'s see what you can come up with."

This directive tendency will continue at higher law levels, and
with the continuing decrease in personal freedom and freedom of
information exchange, and increasing compartmentalization of
research, the return on investment will typically drop heavily.
At some point, the government will probably decide that research
is unproductive of results, and tech will stagnate (Look at the
USSR on Terra in -2531 - most of their technology was acquired
through intelligence gathering).

Thus the suggested modifiers to TL based on Law Level:

Law Level                    Modifier
- ----
No Law or Moderate Law       none
Low Law                      +1
High Law                     -1
Extreme Law (A-C)            -2
Extreme Law (D-E)            -3
Extreme Law (F-G)            -4
Extreme Law (H or greater)   -5

In a similar vein, one can also suggest a new table for the
effect of government type on tech level.  Note that this table
is intended to replace the Government Type modifier to the Tech
Level table in the basic rules:

Government Code    Modifier
- ----
0                  none
1                  +3
2                  +2
3                  none
4                  +1
5                  +2
6                  -2
7                  See note
8                  -1

Note: For balkanized worlds, generate the national governments
of interest, and use the above table. If the table specifies a
negative modifier, change the modifier to be one unit closer to
"none" to account for intelligence (espionage) effects (i.e., a
- -1 modifier becomes "none", a -2 modifier becomes -1, and so
on).

Rationale:
+0 modifiers - When there is no formal government structure, any
new technology developed is unprotected, save by individual
effort. In this event, even if the technology is developed, it
will be slow to be released, because of concerns of the
developer profiting from it (i.e. the developer wants to; others
may be more willing to steal the technology than buy it).

In a benign oligarchy, or a charismatic dictatorship, it is less
likely that those in power will hear about good ideas that are
not developed within the governmental structure, thus reducing
the chance of advancement. Such a government, however, will not
necessarily reject an idea if it hears about it.

+ modifiers - A company has the utmost interest in development
of technology that will allow them to achieve higher return on
investment. Ideas will be actively sought after, and explored
for their profit-making potential. Democracies have a high level
of personal freedom and will tend to allow ideas to percolate
around without interference. Coupled with laws protecting
intellectual property, and the fact that the government will
generally be pretty busy trying to prostitute itself to the
special interests acting in the name of "the people," there will
probably be significant opportunity for ideas to be pursued
despite theoretical restrictions on the use of government funds.
The less a government has to deal directly with the people, the
more it will be able to direct research, thus the lower DM for a
representative democracy vs. a participatory democracy.

- - modifiers - The fundamental obstacles to technological
progress in these governments are multiple: insularity from
people outside the government, doctrinaire educational policies,
rewarding of conformity over individual initiative, personal
paranoia (in the case of dictatorships), conservatism (including
but not limited to religious orthodoxy and extremism)... All of
these combine, to varying degrees, and result in an inability to
develop ideas once they are presented, and a further reluctance
for individuals to present their ideas for fear of being
condemned or persecuted for them (recall Nazi Germany\'s attitude
towards "Jewish Physics").

Note that these are only guidelines; fiddle with them to suit
your needs. Some of the factors cited for negative modifiers
might be at work in governments that have positive modifiers,
and vice-versa.

Also, star type does affect the rest of planetary generation;
the combination of M-V stars and hospitable (even agricultural)
worlds isn\'t entirely realistic. So if we do add stellar data in
for \'feel\', we should take care not to make the same mistake as
GDW: i.e., we should first generate star-type according to known
stellar frequency data and then generate the mainworld, applying
modifiers to the UWP data as applicable. This would probably
make "inhospitable" worlds even more common than in the modified
system above.

Life and Resources:
One way of expanding upon the limited set of generation rules
would be to extend the number of statistics to include:

Resources (independent) - an indicator of the available natural
resources on the world. A high value indicates extensive,
high-quality, and/or readily exploitable resources (mineral,
fossil, vegetable, or animal - this is non-specific, except that
it indicates the presence or absence of resources which
otherwise aren\'t shown in the UWP). Throw 2d6-2 for Resources;
modifiers subject to Referee whim (for example, the Spinward
Marches is known to be deficient in heavy elements; perhaps a
modifier of -1 to the whole Marches to reflect this?). Restrict
the result to the range 0-F.

Life (dependent on atmosphere and hydrosphere) - A general index
to the prevalence and variety of life on the world. A low score
would indicate a barren world (your average asteroid or iceball)
while high numbers indicate a thriving and diverse biosphere
Throw 2d6-2; DM-8 for Vacuum, Trace, or Insidious atmospheres,
- -6 for Very Thin or Corrosive, -4 for Exotic, -2 for Dense/High,
Ellipsoid, or Thin/Low, No modifier for Thin Tainted, Standard
Tainted, or Dense Tainted, and +2 for Thin, Standard, or Dense.
Also apply a hydrosphere modifier: -4 if 0, -2 if 1, None if

Jim Vassilakos\'s Psychological Effects of Planetary Development

The order in which UWP statistics are generated is non-intuitive:

1.Starport Class                5.Population Exponent
2.World Size                    6.Government Type
3.Atmosphere Type               7.Law Level
4.Hydrographic Percentage       8.Technological Level

Why is the starport generated first? It would be more sensible
for starport type to be determined by traffic, and traffic to be
determined by population. Consider generating starport type
after population. Making this one change, look at cause and
effect in the rules:

Statistic                       Modifiers
- ----
World Size                      no modifiers
Atmosphere Type                 Size
Hydrographic Percentage         Atmosphere and Size
Population Exponent             no modifiers
Starport Type                   no modifiers
Government Type                 Population Exponent
Law Level                       Government Type
Technological Level             Everything except law level

Regardless of its features, the primary world or asteroid belt
in one system is just as likely to have a population of x as the
primary world or asteroid belt in any other system. This is less
than obvious.

Think about it. You roll up some dinky little ice-ball as the
main world in your star system -- surely the fact that this tiny
lump of rock has no atmosphere, that it has no liquid water, and
that it hasn\'t even a modicum of elbow room, makes it less
likely to have a population of 50 billion people than the garden
terra-prime paradise just a couple of parsecs down the road.
Yes... you can explain it away. You can say, "Oh, there\'s this
wonderful lanthanum mine." Or you can say. "These people live
here... because it\'s their home" (and then smile convincingly).
But it doesn\'t work. This isn\'t a little inconsistency. This is
a whopping big one.

Jim\'s 1st Law on main-world generation:
Given that everything else is more or less equal, people will
tend to migrate to the place that is "nicer". Worlds with a nice
atmosphere, some actual water, and so forth, will attract large
populations which will in turn build decent starports. Planets
that aren\'t so nice (you know the ones I\'m talking about) will
not attract people, and hence are unlikely to have lots of
traffic or well-equipped starports.

[Note that `people\' is implicitly humans -- not necessarily the
case on all worlds.]

during the "world building" stage of generating planetary
details.

It might well be better to have the Life score as independent of
the natives\' TL as possible. The Life score can be used to
determine whether or not there *are* natives, but their TL is
more properly the province of the world\'s tech level.

Alternatively:
Life Score
0 = Sterile (although "organic" compounds may be present).
1 = Pre-Life (sophisticated "organic" compounds, precursors to life).
2+ Some Life Present (at least single-"cell" simple organisms).

As the Life score increases, the number and size of the
ecosystems increase, as does the number and complexity of the
organisms which can be found there. Remember that this applies
equally to native life-forms as well as "imported" forms (due to
activity of the Ancients, colonization, or simply by accident).
The minima for native development of a given complexity can be
figured out from the table below.

Whether or not you apply modifiers to the Life score based on
the stellar zone the planet is in (inner, habitable, or outer)
depends on your views on really outrageous biochemistries. If
you believe that sentient life can evolve in ecospheres in gas
giants or on ultra-cold (or ultra-hot) worlds, the zone
modifiers should be no more than -2 or -4. In this case, I\'d
suggest using a -3 for Inner and Outer Zone worlds, and a
modifier of 0 for worlds in the habitable zone. This is probably
compatible with the Classic Traveller vision of the universe,
with intelligent gas-giant dwellers and all sorts of exotic
life-forms, and sentient life-forms are all over the place,
although many of them aren\'t really "life as we know it".

While the above pretty accurately describes the way I feel, I
certainly understand if this isn\'t everybody\'s cup of tea. For a
lot less life in general, and a lot less intelligent life, try
the following modifiers:

- -1 if not a Main Sequence (size V) star
- -1 if not a Spectral Class F or G star
- -6 if in Inner Zone
- -4 if in Outer Zone

This should cause the most life to cluster around the habitable
zone of class F and G Main Sequence stars (in other words, stars
like the Sun or a little brighter). Thus, most life will be
"life as we know it", and will be much less prevalent than in
the first method.

Now throw 2d6 and subtract the results from the Life Score:
0- No significant native organisms (all "boring" or imported).
1 = "Interesting" native single-cell organisms.
2 = "Interesting" native microscopic (multicellular) organisms.
3 = "Interesting" native plants (macroscopic).
4 = "Interesting" native animals (non-sentient).
5 = Complex native ecosystem (multiple "Interesting" organisms).
6+ Native Sentient or near-Sentient life (always interesting).

The second throw should probably be part of the "world building"
procedure, and not part of the basic generation.

Once the throw is made, the referee will then have to decide (as
part of the detailed world description) what the "interesting"
things about the planet are. The followings are minima for
native life forms:
0 = Sterile
1 = Pre-Life
2 = Life (maybe even pre-cellular life)
3 = Single-Celled organisms
4 = Multicellular organisms
5 = "Plant" life
6 = Animal life
7 = Complex ecosystems
8 = MINIMUM for native sentient organisms.

Please note that it is possible for a world to have a Life score
of 12, but not have any "interesting" native life. One
possibility is a world that has been colonized, and the
colonist\'s imported plants and animals have out-competed the
native ecosystem, which as become nearly extinct. This is a
definite possibility, particularly on worlds that have been
civilized for thousands of years. Another possibility is a world
that is covered with oceans, which are literally filled with an
amazing diversity of single-celled organisms. Literally every
square centimeter of the world\'s surface would have something
living on it. Although such a world might have a relatively high
Life rating, it may only rate as having "interesting"
single-celled organisms. For figuring out a world in the context
of a long-standing interstellar community, you can use Resources
to represent the attractiveness of the world to the "outside"
starfaring cultures, while the Life score can be used as a basis
for determining whether there is a "native" culture to interact

Hmmm. IIRC, the rule in CT is something like, "Each stateroom on a
starship, occupied or not, involves a constant overhead of Cr2000 per
trip made." [CT/B2:P6&14]

In MT this changed to "if occupied" along with an explicit statement
that double occupancy requires twice the normal cost. [MT/IE:P89/RM:P82]

I\'ve always taken both to mean "per two weeks" since the expectation
is one jump and one week in port per fortnight.

A two person limit per stateroom makes sense when there _is_ a
provision that staterooms include all important life support
facilities.

The standard Traveller starship designs have always forced their
merchant owners to find clever ways to stay ahead of the bank.


The more interesting question to me is "What custom merchant ship
design can be created that would maximize profit given the economic 
model of trade in the Imperium, since the standard designs don\'t?"

My thougth was that he could trace a direct line through the last Emperor of the Second Imperium, a more valid 
claim than Cleon.  What then, would be his response to Cleon\'s actions/declaration?  Acceptance, apathy, 
resistance, would Cleon know, care, pay him off?  Perhaps an internal thron in Cleon\'s side?

It seems to me that the encumbrance rules account for both weight and
bulk reasonably well.

Take a typical U.S. policeman as an example. A policeman in an urban
area is likely to wear a uniform (ordinary clothes) and a bullet
proof vest. An equipment belt worn around the waist (over the
clothes and pants belt) will probably have holster & handgun,
handcuffs w/ belt pouch & key, radio w/ holder, one or two spare
clips of ammunition (in belt pouches), possibly a small flashlight in
its own holder and perhaps a small can of pepper spray in another
holder. I don\'t have an exact weight figure for these items, but I
can tell you it\'s heavy for a belt full of equipment. An equipment
belt is pretty thick and relatively inflexible when compared to an
ordinary belt, too.

Suppose this officer also has a twin that\'s a "bad guy". The bad guy
probably wears ordinary clothes, might carry a small handgun or other
weapon, and is probably wearing athletic shoes. (The good guy wears
ordinary leather shoes. Nice shine, of course. ;-)

If the good guy has to chase the bad guy down an alley, through
backyards, and over a 10 foot (oops, I mean 3m) chainlink fence, who
is likely to have an easier time of it?

It\'s probably a good thing that the good guy has a bunch of his
buddies helping out. :-)

That\'s what I\'d heard, right from the start.  I\'ve got it on my list of 
Q\'s for Ken, though.  Hope to be able to call him on Thursday (sorry for

Allen,

I\'ve thought about this, and I\'m still undecided.  On the one hand, 
you\'re right, letting them know such information is the right thing to 
do.  On the other hand, I don\'t want 999,999 people emailing me about 
this stuff.  I have my hands full as it is. :)

Ideas?

	The idea in my group was vice versa. We intended to make
	higher jump ship more economical, we intended to increase
	in system transfer, and extend jump transfer.

	All in our group started with C64/Elite as a background,
	where jump takes no time and in system transpher to a starport
	is long and dangerous. It was also our intension to make
	jump calculations more complicateded and interesting, so
	they can fit with our trade rules adepted from Elite.

	These are house rules and we know that, we have a lot of
	other house rules for historical reasons, and I dont think
	that we change them to become canon.

	As we rotate the refree job, discussing rules is a very
	important part in our group.  We are not playing
	Marc Millers Traveller but Vegesack Traveller ;-)

	How said that (our) sun has a size of 432 ? 
	In our system planetoids have a size from 0-2, planets a size
	from 3-10, gas giants a size of 11-15 while stars have these

	So a jump to Sol would exit 4000 light seconds, which is

Many of your ideas here are good, but the TL comments all postulate that
the inhabitants of the various world are human.  A world with
Hydrographics A could easily be TL 1 if the main inhabitants were sentient
dolphins (or the local equivilant).  Similarly, a sentient species which
evolved in an ammonia atmosphere would have no trouble living on such a
planet and could be any tech level desired.  The Imperium only makes sense 
to me if there are lots of aliens (I believe the published figure is 400+ 
separate species in the Imperium).

OTOH, your TL limits of Vacuum worlds make sense, since there are only 
going to be *so* many vacuum dwelling life-forms.

	on the bookfair I\'ve talked to FanPro who is one the

	who translated CT. They dosnt seem to be very interested
	in T4, they are still sitting on a stock of MT&TNE materials.

	I\'ve talked to the two game stores here in bremen, and

	So I wouldnd thing T4 will be in german soon ;-(

	But - My company is a book importer, we have a shipper
	in NY, and perhaps we can make a german order over this
	shipper. BTW we can deliver to ANY bookstore (not gamestore)
	in german over KNO/KV bookwagon.

	I always hate the german FanPro/WDS cartell for their

	T4 on our own.

300 dtons just didn\'t seem right to me.  The various deckplans of the

smaller than either a Far of Free trader (both displacing 200 dtons).  So,
I sat down with my old model of the Millennium Falcon  and after a bit of
measuring and calculating (using 1:76 as the scale of the model, which
gives the Falcon an overall length of 35 meters) I came up with a
displacement of around 150 dtons.  Now I\'ll admit my calculations were a
little sloppy and I was drinking a Guinness, but even then I don\'t think
the ship can be larger than 200 dtons.  I anyone wants I can try and post
the measurements and calculations tomorrow.

	hm tech level 15, a black globe, decent sensors, a missile
	turret for SandMans (sand missile to make the enemy blind)
	and a big cargo hold for the cargo of the captured ship ;-)

	Sorry but I coulnt resist.

	IMHO the smaller (200 & 400 tonnes) ships are intended for

	companys for 1MCr/disp ton.

This has incredible potential!!!  Were you thinking that he would be a
member of the Grand Senate, or just a Noble, or the leader of a nearby
pocket empire, or the leader on Terra?

If I may suggest, as the "official" Imperium grows, release updates of
"official" sector data to coincide with the expansion of the Imperium.  Each
Milieu would detail a new sector (or part of a sector).  Eventually, you
should have all the areas developed, but initially, people only know what
the Imperium knows.


>And as we define some specific worlds (like Spires), you get to decide where
>they are placed within a sector or group of sectors.

If the previously detailed areas (like the Reformation Coalition) are kept
the same, I could live with this, but I would much prefer a UWP on every
world.  Of course, as you said, that is a task of outlandish proportion!

Also, the idea someone had mentioned about IG selling the rights to a planet
to folks like the TML gang is a great idea!  Sell the rights to generate the
planet and put it where you want (within reason).  Generate the extended
system, and the planet\'s history/society/culture within some guidelines
provided by IG.  If IG approves of the info submitted then it is published
in a supplement.  I would consider paying a reasonable amount to do this ($5
- - 10).  Just something else to consider (as if you weren\'t thinking about
enough :).

Thanks again for your clarification, Marc.

I agree with you, Allen.  This is the same as in CT--which was a quick, and young, 
system.  This should have been altered in T4.  

On the other hand, check out how much a character can carry in TNE without being 
encumbered.  I call it the "Here, Fred, move this tank over there" system.

There should be a balance, and more realistic numbers, assigned to the weight system.

Thanks for posting your fixes.  I\'m going to print them (to look at them after I get 
this task thing worked out).  You probably just saved me some work.

Hmm. Interesting system.  I like factoring in End and increasing a character\'s load at 
the same time.  Thanks for the post.

That way, the IG-published materials would paint a picture of the Imperium
and support that, while, at the same time, there\'d be a \'shadow\' universe of
IG-undetailed worlds and subsectors (?) for individual refs to detail.  By
not playing these worlds up too much in IG-published material, they\'d just
be \'those other, unsignificant worldsin which nothing much ever happened\' as
far as the official histories went (for the sake of us canon-toting folk!)

As an omnivorous consumer of Traveller, I really wish that I could agree with what the 
Creator is saying, but on this topic, I just don\'t.  

I don\'t expect you guys and gals to detail 20,000 systems, but some of us like to 
stick to the already published material.  I don\'t want to see you generate new UWPs 
either.  What I want to see is T4 expand on what has already been published--not just 
give us a second version of the same stuff.

I want to see new technology, new ideas, and new background, but I want it to jibe with 
everything else.

What is the problem with adhereing to what all of us Traveller players have come to know 
and love?  If you want to detail certain worlds, then I would welcome it.  If some refs 
wanted to make up their own planets from scratch, then they can simply disregard what 
has been printed in the past--just like they have always done.  I\'ve seen a lot of 
resistance to this idea on this list.  Many people want to know why the materials that 
they have purchased  in the past will no longer be valid.

Anyway, however you do it, I\'m still going to buy it.  You just asked for our comments, 
and this is mine.

Sincerely,

Kenneth Bearden

Don\'t think me sarcastic, but anything from the Middle Ages is highly suspect as to

Generating a UWP on every world is not an outlandish task.  We have always gotten our

Hi, Mark, I printed out your post a while back and just now got around to

Your example #3 is ripe for a bolshevik revolution!  Bill Labor cannot afford 
to live unless the he can get somebody to supplement his income (depends on 
the presence and type of government -- right?).  Starvation level food and 
subsistance level lodging in CT and T4 come out to Cr 120 per month.  This 
leaves poor Bill with a shortfall of Cr 442 every year.  Unless he can get a 
second job, he\'s in bad shape -- forget about raising a family.  Do you think 
you should adjust the curve a bit at the bottom end of the chart?  Perhaps it 
should be based on more than SS alone... 

I didn\'t see how the exchange rate would fit into this.  Also, since you seem 
to enjoy being creative with obscure charts hidden away here and there, take a 
peek in _Striker Rule Book 2, Advanced Rules_ on page 38 under the heading 
_Military Spending_.  I dunno if this was ever reprinted in any other 
materials.

to let the Traveller-fans know that we\'re still floating

other not-for-profit articles. Any chance we can get a reply

Geez, I guess I screwed up already. :(  I put that "a month longer" in 
there from my own experience from ordering stuff from England.  If they said 
they\'d ship \'em air mail, then that\'s probably what they did.  Here\'s 
exactly what Ken told me: "Foreign orders will take longer to arrive.  
It\'s just a waiting game."

I am sorry for misinterpreting that. :(

Bill,

I guess this should be in the FAQ:  I have no idea.  

You see, the business end of things is outside of what I\'m supposed to be 
doing here.  IG isn\'t going to share the details of their business with 
me.  (I\'ve been asked how much profit IG makes on each book - I have 
no idea, and I don\'t want to know!  In another instance, Roger Sanger 
e-mailed me and wanted me to talk to IG about permitting his DGP stuff to 
be re-published.  I had to tell him I won\'t be doing that for him.  
That\'s not what I\'m here for, and I have enough to do already.)

Please, no more questions about who owns IG, how much money they make, 
how much they have in the bank, etc!

Thank you.

	I would multiply these 120 Cr by tech level and starport modifier.

Just letting you know:

1.      My "Traveller Library Data" now goes up to "H" (it includes Bwaps
and Dolphins, BTW ;-).

2.      The Tavonni Constitution is now online. Access via the Tavonni
write-up or my main links page.

3.      YES!!! We have PICTURES!!! A scanned map of Tavonni (304k JPEG) is
now available. Access via the Tavonni write-up, at the "System Details"
heading. Sorry, still have not investigated tables properly, so the system
details are still missing. Maybe next time??

At this time the Imperium has just rediscovered Jump-3 drive technology,
and Jump-2 is \'bleeding edge tech\' for the rest of the TL-11 universe
(probably reserved for military ships).  Your average trader is going to
have a Jump-1 drive--it makes getting to those \'unnamed\' worlds very
hard.  It\'s been mentioned before that this is the \'Official\' map.  This
is what the Imperium has released for it\'s general navigation charts.
The worlds not listed might be Red Zones (that\'s if we had a TAS to call
it that in year 0) for various reasons. >>

I haven\'t seen the map yet (still waiting for my signed h/b <sob>), so I 
don\'t know where these worlds are, or how much info is given, but...

1. The Sylean Federation has been wandering around for what, centuries? 
There will be info on those worlds. There are probably still records 
from the Rule of Man.

2. If, somehow, centuries of data has been lost or classified, pick up 
an astronomy textbook. Chances are, it\'ll have full data on all stars 
within, say, 50 parsecs. It may even tell you which ones have planetary 
systems (gas giants, especially). A small amount of work with a radio 
telescope will get you more info, including a TL-estimation (if they 
have radio or not).

3. If all else fails, spending an afternoon in a starport bar will find 
at least one trader who\'s been there (or knows someone who has).

The *only* possibilities that make sense are: a) they\'re all barren, 
inhospitable rocks, or b) the Imperial Navy is interdicting them and 
destroying any ship that visits.

   You should include the Solomani Rim sector data which is available in
Traveller Chronicle #10 (or available minus maps and other stuff from me if
you ask nice).  As Traveller Chronicle is an officially licensed Traveller
product, its contents would be classified as canon, or at least as canon as

(careful, Johnny. Make sure that Mountain Lion knows you are here or he  will rip you

get it now)
A question. If you have the animals damage already rolled, how does armour work 
against it? I can improv a house rule but I think this could be a prob for a new player 
starting traveller

Why is the pump action on the top of the barrel of the shotgun? Is this some alien race\'s 
shotgun? (p81)

On p115, it states that a captain will discover a stowaway on a 10- and space him on a 
reaction roll of 8+.
WHAT? That means , according to the reaction chart on p150, if the result is interested 
or better, he will kill you. In this case I would say, if you are caught, spit in the man\'s 
face and question his ancestry. Then he won\'t kill you

Something has to be done with the reaction chart. As it stands any given encounter has a 
11.81% chance of an attack. Maybe that is why the animals are so nervous. Someone 
once described the chart by saying that when you ask a bureaucrat what time it is and he 
whips out a PGMP and says "time to leave, a*****e!

 Or, whatever caused it to misjump to here also did Strange

compatible with the Classic Traveller vision of the universe,
with intelligent gas-giant dwellers and all sorts of exotic
life-forms, and sentient life-forms are all over the place,
although many of them aren\'t really "life as we know it".

While the above pretty accurately describes the way I feel, I
certainly understand if this isn\'t everybody\'s cup of tea. For a
lot less life in general, and a lot less intelligent life, try
the following modifiers:

- -1 if not a Main Sequence (size V) star
- -1 if not a Spectral Class F or G star
- -6 if in Inner Zone
- -4 if in Outer Zone

This should cause the most life to cluster around the habitable
zone of class F and G Main Sequence stars (in other words, stars
like the Sun or a little brighter). Thus, most life will be
"life as we know it", and will be much less prevalent than in
the first method.

Now throw 2d6 and subtract the results from the Life Score:
0- No significant native organisms (all "boring" or imported).
1 = "Interesting" native single-cell organisms.
2 = "Interesting" native microscopic (multicellular) organisms.
3 = "Interesting" native plants (macroscopic).
4 = "Interesting" native animals (non-sentient).
5 = Complex native ecosystem (multiple "Interesting" organisms).
6+ Native Sentient or near-Sentient life (always interesting).

The second throw should probably be part of the "world building"
procedure, and not part of the basic generation.

Once the throw is made, the referee will then have to decide (as
part of the detailed world description) what the "interesting"
things about the planet are. The followings are minima for
native life forms:
0 = Sterile
1 = Pre-Life
2 = Life (maybe even pre-cellular life)
3 = Single-Celled organisms
4 = Multicellular organisms
5 = "Plant" life
6 = Animal life
7 = Complex ecosystems
8 = MINIMUM for native sentient organisms.

Please note that it is possible for a world to have a Life score
of 12, but not have any "interesting" native life. One
possibility is a world that has been colonized, and the
colonist\'s imported plants and animals have out-competed the
native ecosystem, which as become nearly extinct. This is a
definite possibility, particularly on worlds that have been
civilized for thousands of years. Another possibility is a world
that is covered with oceans, which are literally filled with an
amazing diversity of single-celled organisms. Literally every
square centimeter of the world\'s surface would have something
living on it. Although such a world might have a relatively high
Life rating, it may only rate as having "interesting"
single-celled organisms. For figuring out a world in the context
of a long-standing interstellar community, you can use Resources
to represent the attractiveness of the world to the "outside"
starfaring cultures, while the Life score can be used as a basis
for determining whether there is a "native" culture to interact
with.

Jim Vassilakos\'s Psychological Effects of Planetary Development

The order in which UWP statistics are generated is non-intuitive:

1.Starport Class                5.Population Exponent
2.World Size                    6.Government Type
3.Atmosphere Type               7.Law Level
4.Hydrographic Percentage       8.Technological Level

Why is the starport generated first? It would be more sensible
for starport type to be determined by traffic, and traffic to be
determined by population. Consider generating starport type
after population. Making this one change, look at cause and
effect in the rules:

Statistic                       Modifiers
- ----
World Size                      no modifiers
Atmosphere Type                 Size
Hydrographic Percentage         Atmosphere and Size
Population Exponent             no modifiers
Starport Type                   no modifiers
Government Type                 Population Exponent
Law Level                       Government Type
Technological Level             Everything except law level

Regardless of its features, the primary world or asteroid belt
in one system is just as likely to have a population of x as the
primary world or asteroid belt in any other system. This is less
than obvious.

Think about it. You roll up some dinky little ice-ball as the
main world in your star system -- surely the fact that this tiny
lump of rock has no atmosphere, that it has no liquid water, and
that it hasn\'t even a modicum of elbow room, makes it less
likely to have a population of 50 billion people than the garden
terra-prime paradise just a couple of parsecs down the road.
Yes... you can explain it away. You can say, "Oh, there\'s this
wonderful lanthanum mine." Or you can say. "These people live
here... because it\'s their home" (and then smile convincingly).
But it doesn\'t work. This isn\'t a little inconsistency. This is
a whopping big one.

Jim\'s 1st Law on main-world generation:
Given that everything else is more or less equal, people will
tend to migrate to the place that is "nicer". Worlds with a nice
atmosphere, some actual water, and so forth, will attract large
populations which will in turn build decent starports. Planets
that aren\'t so nice (you know the ones I\'m talking about) will
not attract people, and hence are unlikely to have lots of
traffic or well-equipped starports.

[Note that `people\' is implicitly humans -- not necessarily the
case on all worlds.]

Jim\'s 2nd Law:
People will attain the resources (technology) that they need to
survive, such that those resources are available. If you\'re
really sure that you\'re going to live on Sonthert/Lanth, then
you\'re going to make sure you have the technology to survive on
a near-vacuum planet. (Sonthert, alas, is rated TL3.)

The philosophy of high and low tech worlds living side by side
is also questionable. It can be argued that it\'s possible for a
short duration such as a few decades, or given special political
or social circumstances. But in general, over the course of
centuries, eventually there will either be a leveling process or
the low Technological Level regions will gain in technology.

The counter-argument to Jim\'s 1st Law is that all things are not
equal. Otherwise, why would anyone live in Chicago when they
could move to Hawaii? (Most people would class the latter as
nicer than the former!) The answer is economics. People are too
poor to move, don\'t have skills, have family ties. Moreover, if
there are no jobs at the new planet, who is going to move there?
Equally, the world profiles don\'t tell the whole story. Just
because a place has a "nice" profile - average size, average
atmosphere, average hydrographics -- doesn\'t mean the rest of it
is fun. The planet could be too hot, too cold, inhabited by
vorpal bunnies, or whatever.

It is also possible that "blue-sky" Terra-norm worlds might in
some cases be more difficult to settle than less inviting worlds
- -- there\'ll be life down there, and who knows what might do to
prospective settlers? Vacuum worlds are much more predictable,
and with proper planning might also be easier on the equipment.
So more people might settle there, especially if the colony is
well established -- a vacuum world colony interior can be much
more sophisticated and spacious than, say, Moonbase Alpha.

Note that there are some conspicuous differences between this
data and "normal" UWP listings. There are more uninhabited or
very low-population star systems under the modified rules. This
will probably bring down the average starport rating for any
given region. Also, there are very few low-tech star systems.
The lowest here are both TL4, and in both cases, they\'ve got a
breathable atmospheres. As expected, the less-hospitable worlds
tend to have lower populations and seedier starports. More
surprising is the existence of several lush (atmos=6) worlds
with under ten million inhabitants. The system usually has high
populations clustered on those worlds. However, when we look at
the highest population world in this run, we see that it has a
standard atmosphere, so these results are fairly plausible.

Jeff Zeitlin\'s Theory of Government Technological Interference

It can be argued that law level will have an effect on tech
level. The more oppressive a society is, the less likely it is
that geniuses will appear and create the new technology. Earth
history supports this view; the cultures that made the largest
advances in technology were the ones with high levels of
personal freedom. Certainly, other, less free cultures may do a
better job of exploiting some forms of technology, but they\'ll
probably acquire it from a culture that is more free. One would
hardly expect a totally oppressive theocracy to be innovative...

At No Law, there is no way of ensuring that the person who
develops new technology will be able to profit from it. If
something is good, it will be used by anyone who can get their
hands on it, and without paying. This reduces the incentive to
research.

At Low Law, there may be some protection, so there will be some
innovation. However, the government will normally not be
powerful or influential enough to make large investments in
research; this will offset part of the benefit gained from the
protection afforded intellectual property.

At Moderate Law, you will typically have a government that has
the power, influence, and revenue to invest in research, and
sufficient freedom of information exchange to make it profitable
(in terms of results). However, at this stage, the government
will probably have a tendency to want to direct the research,
rather than dropping the cash on the table, sitting back, and
saying, "O.K. folks, let\'s see what you can come up with."

This directive tendency will continue at higher law levels, and
with the continuing decrease in personal freedom and freedom of
information exchange, and increasing compartmentalization of
research, the return on investment will typically drop heavily.
At some point, the government will probably decide that research
is unproductive of results, and tech will stagnate (Look at the
USSR on Terra in -2531 - most of their technology was acquired
through intelligence gathering).

Thus the suggested modifiers to TL based on Law Level:

Law Level                    Modifier
- ----
No Law or Moderate Law       none
Low Law                      +1
High Law                     -1
Extreme Law (A-C)            -2
Extreme Law (D-E)            -3
Extreme Law (F-G)            -4
Extreme Law (H or greater)   -5

In a similar vein, one can also suggest a new table for the
effect of government type on tech level.  Note that this table
is intended to replace the Government Type modifier to the Tech
Level table in the basic rules:

Government Code    Modifier
- ----
0                  none
1                  +3
2                  +2
3                  none
4                  +1
5                  +2
6                  -2
7                  See note
8                  -1
9                  -1
A                  none
B                  -1
C                  none
D                  -3

Note: For balkanized worlds, generate the national governments
of interest, and use the above table. If the table specifies a
negative modifier, change the modifier to be one unit closer to
"none" to account for intelligence (espionage) effects (i.e., a
- -1 modifier becomes "none", a -2 modifier becomes -1, and so
on).

Rationale:
+0 modifiers - When there is no formal government structure, any
new technology developed is unprotected, save by individual
effort. In this event, even if the technology is developed, it
will be slow to be released, because of concerns of the
developer profiting from it (i.e. the developer wants to; others
may be more willing to steal the technology than buy it).

In a benign oligarchy, or a charismatic dictatorship, it is less
likely that those in power will hear about good ideas that are
not developed within the governmental structure, thus reducing
the chance of advancement. Such a government, however, will not
necessarily reject an idea if it hears about it.

+ modifiers - A company has the utmost interest in development
of technology that will allow them to achieve higher return on
investment. Ideas will be actively sought after, and explored
for their profit-making potential. Democracies have a high level
of personal freedom and will tend to allow ideas to percolate
around without interference. Coupled with laws protecting
intellectual property, and the fact that the government will
generally be pretty busy trying to prostitute itself to the
special interests acting in the name of "the people," there will
probably be significant opportunity for ideas to be pursued
despite theoretical restrictions on the use of government funds.
The less a government has to deal directly with the people, the
more it will be able to direct research, thus the lower DM for a
representative democracy vs. a participatory democracy.

- - modifiers - The fundamental obstacles to technological
progress in these governments are multiple: insularity from
people outside the government, doctrinaire educational policies,
rewarding of conformity over individual initiative, personal
paranoia (in the case of dictatorships), conservatism (including
but not limited to religious orthodoxy and extremism)... All of
these combine, to varying degrees, and result in an inability to
develop ideas once they are presented, and a further reluctance
for individuals to present their ideas for fear of being
condemned or persecuted for them (recall Nazi Germany\'s attitude
towards "Jewish Physics").

Note that these are only guidelines; fiddle with them to suit
your needs. Some of the factors cited for negative modifiers
might be at work in governments that have positive modifiers,
and vice-versa.

- ----
Also, star type does affect the rest of planetary generation;
the combination of M-V stars and hospitable (even agricultural)
worlds isn\'t entirely realistic. So if we do add stellar data in
for \'feel\', we should take care not to make the same mistake as
GDW: i.e., we should first generate star-type according to known
stellar frequency data and then generate the mainworld, applying
modifiers to the UWP data as applicable. This would probably
make "inhospitable" worlds even more common than in the modified
system above.

Life and Resources:
One way of expanding upon the limited set of generation rules
would be to extend the number of statistics to include:

resources on the world. A high value indicates extensive,

Problem is, GDW never really generated sectors like this...  If you
look at the UWP stats for the sectors they did (Solomani Rim, Spinward
Marches, Diaspora) they cooked the books, did them by hand.  These
sectors were the better for it...  

DGP in creating all those sectors on the net, used a random number 
generator that wasn\'t all that random, and badly flawed besides...
David Nilsen referred to it once as "a needle stuck in the same 
groove."  A lot of the DGP sectors were badly flawed..

As for me, I\'d rather see IG use their limited resources to develop a 
few sectors in detail.  There are about a half dozen sector 
generators floating around in various places on the net.  I can roll 
my own for the others if I want...or write my own, but I can assure 
you that the randomly generated Spinward Marches and Solomani Rim 
would look a lot different than they would be if GDW hadn\'t done them 
by hand to begin with...

Give me the world positions...  I can do the number crunching just as 
easy as IG could.

Thank you...  I can computer generate sectors just as easily as IG,

Best news of all.  I can transplant them where I want...which is what 
I do anyways with world writeups.  Marc, thank you for your input, and 
I for 1 think that you\'re doing good to avoid choking T4 to death with "canon"

Here\'s a spin on this that nobody may have considered...

ALL previous references to the Core subsector are DGP property 
(Traveller Digest, Post of UWP to GEnie).  Right now from what I 
understand from Roger Sanger, IG wouldn\'t be able to publish the Core 
subsector as it previously existed in Traveller Digest, which is after all, 
the property of DGP, until they signed an agreement with DGP either 
to publish it, or to license DGP to publish it.

It is possible that they could have published the DGP sector data 
from GEnie, which is essentially Public Domain, but right now, they 
couldn\'t reuse the world writeups from Traveller Digest if they 
wanted to...

Maybe Marc could correct me on this, but as far as I know, IG has no 
right to republish DGP material if they wanted to, which is 
essentially what some of us are suggesting they do...

in between, but they are robust compared to modern humans.

Anyway, I thought I\'d clear that up.

As it relates to traveller, it means that the transplanted humans

of grandfather\'s abductions as well) very human looking (more human
than erectus).

They\'d keep the robust form (big bones) on higher grav worlds, and
become more gracile on lower grav worlds.  Humans have become
lighter framed since the onset of agriculture, so you\'d expect the
other human races in traveller to look more or less like us.

I\'ve gotten a copy of the article below and started modifying it
for Freelance Traveller.  I need some information from the list:

=46irst, if you\'re one of the authors, please identify your
contribution to the article.  I\'ve identified mine and Jim
Vassilakos\'s; I\'m not familiar enough with other people\'s
writing styles and thought processes to be able to even identify
where one contribution ends and the next begins.

Second, I need current e-mail addresses for everyone below.
Mine is correct - I haven\'t changed it; Jim\'s is correct as well.
I\'m pretty sure that Derek\'s has changed, but I\'m not sure to
what; the others I haven\'t heard from or seen posts from in quite

Jim Vassilakos\'s Psychological Effects of Planetary Development

The order in which UWP statistics are generated is non-intuitive:

1.Starport Class                5.Population Exponent
2.World Size                    6.Government Type
3.Atmosphere Type               7.Law Level
4.Hydrographic Percentage       8.Technological Level

Why is the starport generated first? It would be more sensible
for starport type to be determined by traffic, and traffic to be
determined by population. Consider generating starport type
after population. Making this one change, look at cause and
effect in the rules:

Statistic                       Modifiers
- ----
World Size                      no modifiers
Atmosphere Type                 Size
Hydrographic Percentage         Atmosphere and Size
Population Exponent             no modifiers
Starport Type                   no modifiers
Government Type                 Population Exponent
Law Level                       Government Type
Technological Level             Everything except law level

Regardless of its features, the primary world or asteroid belt
in one system is just as likely to have a population of x as the
primary world or asteroid belt in any other system. This is less
than obvious.

Think about it. You roll up some dinky little ice-ball as the
main world in your star system -- surely the fact that this tiny
lump of rock has no atmosphere, that it has no liquid water, and
that it hasn\'t even a modicum of elbow room, makes it less
likely to have a population of 50 billion people than the garden
terra-prime paradise just a couple of parsecs down the road.
Yes... you can explain it away. You can say, "Oh, there\'s this
wonderful lanthanum mine." Or you can say. "These people live
here... because it\'s their home" (and then smile convincingly).
But it doesn\'t work. This isn\'t a little inconsistency. This is
a whopping big one.

Jim\'s 1st Law on main-world generation:
Given that everything else is more or less equal, people will
tend to migrate to the place that is "nicer". Worlds with a nice
atmosphere, some actual water, and so forth, will attract large
populations which will in turn build decent starports. Planets
that aren\'t so nice (you know the ones I\'m talking about) will
not attract people, and hence are unlikely to have lots of
traffic or well-equipped starports.

[Note that `people\' is implicitly humans -- not necessarily the
case on all worlds.]

Jim\'s 2nd Law:
People will attain the resources (technology) that they need to
survive, such that those resources are available. If you\'re
really sure that you\'re going to live on Sonthert/Lanth, then
you\'re going to make sure you have the technology to survive on
a near-vacuum planet. (Sonthert, alas, is rated TL3.)

The philosophy of high and low tech worlds living side by side
is also questionable. It can be argued that it\'s possible for a
short duration such as a few decades, or given special political
or social circumstances. But in general, over the course of
centuries, eventually there will either be a leveling process or
the low Technological Level regions will gain in technology.

The counter-argument to Jim\'s 1st Law is that all things are not
equal. Otherwise, why would anyone live in Chicago when they
could move to Hawaii? (Most people would class the latter as
nicer than the former!) The answer is economics. People are too
poor to move, don\'t have skills, have family ties. Moreover, if
there are no jobs at the new planet, who is going to move there?
Equally, the world profiles don\'t tell the whole story. Just
because a place has a "nice" profile - average size, average
atmosphere, average hydrographics -- doesn\'t mean the rest of it
is fun. The planet could be too hot, too cold, inhabited by
vorpal bunnies, or whatever.

It is also possible that "blue-sky" Terra-norm worlds might in
some cases be more difficult to settle than less inviting worlds
- -- there\'ll be life down there, and who knows what might do to
prospective settlers? Vacuum worlds are much more predictable,
and with proper planning might also be easier on the equipment.
So more people might settle there, especially if the colony is
well established -- a vacuum world colony interior can be much
more sophisticated and spacious than, say, Moonbase Alpha.

Jim\'s Modified Main-world Generation Procedure:

Changes from the standard procedure are *italicized*.

World Size. Roll 2d6-2.

if Atmosphere Type is 1 or less, then DM -4
if World Size is *1 or less*, then Hydrographics Percentage 0
if Atmosphere Type is A-C then DM -4
confine range to 0-A

Population Exponent. Roll 2d6-2.
*if World Size is 2 or less, DM -1*
*if Atmosphere Type is 3 or less, DM -3*
*if Atmosphere Type is A, DM -2*
*if Atmosphere Type is B, DM -3*
*if Atmosphere Type is C, DM -4*
*if Atmosphere Type is 6, DM +3*
*if Atmosphere Type is 5 or 8, DM +1*
*if Hydrographics Percentage is 0 and Atmosphere Type is 3 or
greater, DM -2*
*confine range to 0-A*

Starport Type. Roll 2d6.
*if Population Exponent is 0 then Starport Type X*
*if Population Exponent is 1, DM +2*
*if Population Exponent is 2, DM +1*
*if Population Exponent is 6-9, then DM -1*
*if Population Exponent is A, then DM -2*
*confine range to A-X*

Government Type. Roll 2d6-7+Population Exponent.
*if population exponent is 0 then government 0*
*confine range to 0-F*

Law Level. Roll 2d6-7+Government Type.
*if government type is 0 then law level 0*
*confine lower bound of range to 0*

Technological Level. Roll d6.
Modify as per the standard chart.
*if Population Exponent 0 then Technological Level 0*
*otherwise, if Hydrographic Percentage is 0 or A and Population
Exponent is at least 6, then Technological Level must at least
be 4.*
*if Atmosphere Type is 4, 7 or 9, then Technological Level must
be at least be 5.*
*if Atmosphere Type is 3 or less, or A-C, then Technological
Level must at least be 7.*
*if Hydrographic Percentage is A, then Technological Level must
be at least be 7.*
confine lower bound of range to 0

Some example UWPs from this system:

Note that there are some conspicuous differences between this
data and "normal" UWP listings. There are more uninhabited or
very low-population star systems under the modified rules. This
will probably bring down the average starport rating for any
given region. Also, there are very few low-tech star systems.
The lowest here are both TL4, and in both cases, they\'ve got a
breathable atmospheres. As expected, the less-hospitable worlds
tend to have lower populations and seedier starports. More
surprising is the existence of several lush (atmos=3D6) worlds
with under ten million inhabitants. The system usually has high
populations clustered on those worlds. However, when we look at
the highest population world in this run, we see that it has a
standard atmosphere, so these results are fairly plausible.

Jeff Zeitlin\'s Theory of Government Technological Interference

It can be argued that law level will have an effect on tech
level. The more oppressive a society is, the less likely it is
that geniuses will appear and create the new technology. Earth
history supports this view; the cultures that made the largest
advances in technology were the ones with high levels of
personal freedom. Certainly, other, less free cultures may do a
better job of exploiting some forms of technology, but they\'ll
probably acquire it from a culture that is more free. One would
hardly expect a totally oppressive theocracy to be innovative...

At No Law, there is no way of ensuring that the person who
develops new technology will be able to profit from it. If
something is good, it will be used by anyone who can get their
hands on it, and without paying. This reduces the incentive to
research.

At Low Law, there may be some protection, so there will be some
innovation. However, the government will normally not be
powerful or influential enough to make large investments in
research; this will offset part of the benefit gained from the
protection afforded intellectual property.

At Moderate Law, you will typically have a government that has
the power, influence, and revenue to invest in research, and
sufficient freedom of information exchange to make it profitable
(in terms of results). However, at this stage, the government
will probably have a tendency to want to direct the research,
rather than dropping the cash on the table, sitting back, and
saying, "O.K. folks, let\'s see what you can come up with."

This directive tendency will continue at higher law levels, and
with the continuing decrease in personal freedom and freedom of
information exchange, and increasing compartmentalization of
research, the return on investment will typically drop heavily.
At some point, the government will probably decide that research
is unproductive of results, and tech will stagnate (Look at the
USSR on Terra in -2531 - most of their technology was acquired
through intelligence gathering).

Thus the suggested modifiers to TL based on Law Level:

Law Level                    Modifier
- ----
No Law or Moderate Law       none
Low Law                      +1
High Law                     -1
Extreme Law (A-C)            -2
Extreme Law (D-E)            -3
Extreme Law (F-G)            -4
Extreme Law (H or greater)   -5

In a similar vein, one can also suggest a new table for the
effect of government type on tech level.  Note that this table
is intended to replace the Government Type modifier to the Tech
Level table in the basic rules:

Government Code    Modifier
- ----
0                  none
1                  +3
2                  +2
3                  none
4                  +1
5                  +2
6                  -2
7                  See note
8                  -1
9                  -1
A                  none
B                  -1
C                  none
D                  -3

Note: For balkanized worlds, generate the national governments
of interest, and use the above table. If the table specifies a
negative modifier, change the modifier to be one unit closer to
"none" to account for intelligence (espionage) effects (i.e., a
- -1 modifier becomes "none", a -2 modifier becomes -1, and so
on).

Rationale:
+0 modifiers - When there is no formal government structure, any
new technology developed is unprotected, save by individual
effort. In this event, even if the technology is developed, it
will be slow to be released, because of concerns of the
developer profiting from it (i.e. the developer wants to; others
may be more willing to steal the technology than buy it).

In a benign oligarchy, or a charismatic dictatorship, it is less
likely that those in power will hear about good ideas that are
not developed within the governmental structure, thus reducing
the chance of advancement. Such a government, however, will not
necessarily reject an idea if it hears about it.

+ modifiers - A company has the utmost interest in development
of technology that will allow them to achieve higher return on
investment. Ideas will be actively sought after, and explored
for their profit-making potential. Democracies have a high level
of personal freedom and will tend to allow ideas to percolate
around without interference. Coupled with laws protecting
intellectual property, and the fact that the government will
generally be pretty busy trying to prostitute itself to the
special interests acting in the name of "the people," there will
probably be significant opportunity for ideas to be pursued
despite theoretical restrictions on the use of government funds.
The less a government has to deal directly with the people, the
more it will be able to direct research, thus the lower DM for a
representative democracy vs. a participatory democracy.

- - modifiers - The fundamental obstacles to technological
progress in these governments are multiple: insularity from
people outside the government, doctrinaire educational policies,
rewarding of conformity over individual initiative, personal
paranoia (in the case of dictatorships), conservatism (including
but not limited to religious orthodoxy and extremism)... All of
these combine, to varying degrees, and result in an inability to
develop ideas once they are presented, and a further reluctance
for individuals to present their ideas for fear of being
condemned or persecuted for them (recall Nazi Germany\'s attitude
towards "Jewish Physics").

Note that these are only guidelines; fiddle with them to suit
your needs. Some of the factors cited for negative modifiers
might be at work in governments that have positive modifiers,
and vice-versa.

Also, star type does affect the rest of planetary generation;
the combination of M-V stars and hospitable (even agricultural)
worlds isn\'t entirely realistic. So if we do add stellar data in
for \'feel\', we should take care not to make the same mistake as
GDW: i.e., we should first generate star-type according to known
stellar frequency data and then generate the mainworld, applying
modifiers to the UWP data as applicable. This would probably
make "inhospitable" worlds even more common than in the modified
system above.

Life and Resources:
One way of expanding upon the limited set of generation rules
would be to extend the number of statistics to include:

Resources (independent) - an indicator of the available natural
resources on the world. A high value indicates extensive,
high-quality, and/or readily exploitable resources (mineral,
fossil, vegetable, or animal - this is non-specific, except that
it indicates the presence or absence of resources which
otherwise aren\'t shown in the UWP). Throw 2d6-2 for Resources;
modifiers subject to Referee whim (for example, the Spinward
Marches is known to be deficient in heavy elements; perhaps a
modifier of -1 to the whole Marches to reflect this?). Restrict
the result to the range 0-F.

Life (dependent on atmosphere and hydrosphere) - A general index
to the prevalence and variety of life on the world. A low score
would indicate a barren world (your average asteroid or iceball)
while high numbers indicate a thriving and diverse biosphere
Throw 2d6-2; DM-8 for Vacuum, Trace, or Insidious atmospheres,
- -6 for Very Thin or Corrosive, -4 for Exotic, -2 for Dense/High,
Ellipsoid, or Thin/Low, No modifier for Thin Tainted, Standard
Tainted, or Dense Tainted, and +2 for Thin, Standard, or Dense.
Also apply a hydrosphere modifier: -4 if 0, -2 if 1, None if
2-5, +1 if 6-9, -1 if A. Other modifiers can be used too: a +1
for worlds settled or influenced by the Ancients, First
Imperium, or Rule of Man (old colonies or terraforming efforts).
If Stellar Types are being used, an additional modifier for the
suitability of the star might not be a bad idea. Restrict to the
range 0-F.

The resources score can be used to justify settlements on
otherwise inhospitable worlds, and should serve as a positive DM
for population. The rationale is that there is some type of
valuable resource present (which doesn\'t otherwise show on the
UWP), and therefore it is likely that someone has come (despite
the hardship) to exploit it. A suggestion for interpreting
resources scores:

Resource Score          Interpretation
- ----
0                       Barren
1-4                     Poor
5-8                     Moderate
9-C                     Rich
D or greater            Extremely Rich

Poor: Basic chemical diversity necessary to support indigenous
life. Otherwise, no claim to fame.

Moderate: One solid natural-resource industry. Roll on table 10a
of the MegaTraveller Referee\'s Manual. Re-roll 34-54 if life < 4
(see above). Re-roll 65 if life < 5. Re-roll 55-56 if life < 8.
Re-roll 61-64 if life < 9. Re-roll 66 if life < A.

Rich: Two natural-resources industries, one of which commands
strong subsector-wide influence.

Extremely Rich: Three natural-resource industries, one of which
commands sector-wide influence.

Note: The GM should translate natural-resource industries into
their manufacturing/processing (2nd stage) industries as seems
appropriate. See MegaTraveller Referee\'s Manual (pg52) for
possibilities.

Another note: Under this system, the resource statistic is
rolled before the life statistic, and the life statistic is
rolled before the specific industries are determined. A better
method would be to select a resource type (using Table 10a, or
some other source), and roll 1d6. This is the "amount" of this
resource, but not more than the resource score of the world. The
process would repeat until the entire resource score is
accounted for. For example:

Resource score (2D) =3D 10
1st Resource: #61, Livestock. Amount: 5
2nd Resource: #42, Plants (wood). Amount: 4
3rd Resource: #63, Livestock. Amount: 1 (a 3 was rolled).

So, our hypothetical world produces Livestock at Level 6 (the
two livestock resources add, at the referee\'s discretion), and
Plants (wood) at Level 4.

Comparing all of the scores and types within the subsector and
within the sector will reveal the primary producers of
particular goods.

The Life score can be used to get a "feel" for the native
biosphere, and to gauge whether or not there is a native race to
consider. One suggestion (for a campaign with few advanced
"minor" races) was:

0: Sterile
1: Amino Acids
2: Single-celled organisms
3: Multicellular bacteria
4: Simple vegetation
5: Complex vegetation
6: Microscopic insects & sea life
7: Macroscopic insects
8: Macroscopic sea life
9: Land/Air-based herbivores
A: Land/Air-based predators
B: Large/Complex predators
C: Tool use
D: Fire use
E: Agriculture
=46: Symbology (full sentience, TL=3D0)

D, E, and F may be given higher degrees of technology. While the
use of tools and fire is pretty much a clincher for sentient or
semi-sentient creatures, by the time they are practicing
agriculture the society is pretty much at TL-0.

These distinctions should really be made as part of the details
for the native sentient or semi-sentient race. The exact stage
of development should probably be determined by the referee
during the "world building" stage of generating planetary
details.

It might well be better to have the Life score as independent of
the natives\' TL as possible. The Life score can be used to
determine whether or not there *are* natives, but their TL is
more properly the province of the world\'s tech level.

Alternatively:
Life Score
0 =3D Sterile (although "organic" compounds may be present).
1 =3D Pre-Life (sophisticated "organic" compounds, precursors to
life).
2+ Some Life Present (at least single-"cell" simple organisms).

As the Life score increases, the number and size of the
ecosystems increase, as does the number and complexity of the
organisms which can be found there. Remember that this applies
equally to native life-forms as well as "imported" forms (due to
activity of the Ancients, colonization, or simply by accident).
The minima for native development of a given complexity can be
figured out from the table below.

Whether or not you apply modifiers to the Life score based on
the stellar zone the planet is in (inner, habitable, or outer)
depends on your views on really outrageous biochemistries. If
you believe that sentient life can evolve in ecospheres in gas
giants or on ultra-cold (or ultra-hot) worlds, the zone
modifiers should be no more than -2 or -4. In this case, I\'d
suggest using a -3 for Inner and Outer Zone worlds, and a
modifier of 0 for worlds in the habitable zone. This is probably
compatible with the Classic Traveller vision of the universe,
with intelligent gas-giant dwellers and all sorts of exotic
life-forms, and sentient life-forms are all over the place,
although many of them aren\'t really "life as we know it".

While the above pretty accurately describes the way I feel, I
certainly understand if this isn\'t everybody\'s cup of tea. For a
lot less life in general, and a lot less intelligent life, try
the following modifiers:

- -1 if not a Main Sequence (size V) star
- -1 if not a Spectral Class F or G star
- -6 if in Inner Zone
- -4 if in Outer Zone

This should cause the most life to cluster around the habitable
zone of class F and G Main Sequence stars (in other words, stars
like the Sun or a little brighter). Thus, most life will be
"life as we know it", and will be much less prevalent than in
the first method.

Now throw 2d6 and subtract the results from the Life Score:
0- No significant native organisms (all "boring" or imported).
1 =3D "Interesting" native single-cell organisms.
2 =3D "Interesting" native microscopic (multicellular) organisms.
3 =3D "Interesting" native plants (macroscopic).
4 =3D "Interesting" native animals (non-sentient).
5 =3D Complex native ecosystem (multiple "Interesting" organisms).
6+ Native Sentient or near-Sentient life (always interesting).

The second throw should probably be part of the "world building"
procedure, and not part of the basic generation.

Once the throw is made, the referee will then have to decide (as
part of the detailed world description) what the "interesting"
things about the planet are. The followings are minima for
native life forms:
0 =3D Sterile
1 =3D Pre-Life
2 =3D Life (maybe even pre-cellular life)
3 =3D Single-Celled organisms
4 =3D Multicellular organisms
5 =3D "Plant" life
6 =3D Animal life
7 =3D Complex ecosystems
8 =3D MINIMUM for native sentient organisms.

Please note that it is possible for a world to have a Life score
of 12, but not have any "interesting" native life. One
possibility is a world that has been colonized, and the
colonist\'s imported plants and animals have out-competed the
native ecosystem, which as become nearly extinct. This is a
definite possibility, particularly on worlds that have been
civilized for thousands of years. Another possibility is a world
that is covered with oceans, which are literally filled with an
amazing diversity of single-celled organisms. Literally every
square centimeter of the world\'s surface would have something
living on it. Although such a world might have a relatively high
Life rating, it may only rate as having "interesting"
single-celled organisms. For figuring out a world in the context
of a long-standing interstellar community, you can use Resources
to represent the attractiveness of the world to the "outside"
starfaring cultures, while the Life score can be used as a basis
for determining whether there is a "native" culture to interact
with.

Note that these movement rates are for entire time periods of overland
travel.  I was in the Army, and can tell you that even 20kg can drag you
down after a time.  50kg is about 110lbs, I know nobody who would operate at
effectivly over a four hour period carrying that kind of weight.  441lbs is
a lot for even a STR 15 PC to carry for hours.. this is what Olympic-class
weightlifters do in the clean and jerk, and they don\'t walk anywhere!

The "in-backpack" should cut the effective weight by about a third, not
half.  While having the load distributed on your shoulders and hips helps,
you are still carrying it.  Since Load Bearing Equipment is designed to both
distribute loads and provide easy access to the equpment, I\'d make some
exception for *legitimate* calls..

I always had a problem with the semi-loons that join the Scout Service
wearing uniforms.  Most Scout Base commanders are happy when everyone wears
clothing, never mind what it looks like...

Reminds me of the time that we were ordered to appear before the Archduke of
Sol, in "full dress uniform".  Alright for the Navy and Marine types, I
showed up in my nightmare vision of Imperial chic..

	somebody asked for a yacht some weeks ago. Unfortunately
	this is probately not the yacht he asked, but its nice
	to provide the comunity with old german CT fanzine material.

	If you need the GIF or dosnt understand the "Last Sane" paragraph
	look at http://www.hb.north.de/hosts/bakunin/traveller/shipyard.

  			---- CUT HERE ----

<h1>	TL 10 Yacht
</h1>
	These ship resembles a CT design from Ingo Martin, published
	in 1984 in Mythos Nr. 19, a small fanzine from a group called
	Friedberger Kreis around Elsa Franke who later made Midgard,
	which is THE german fantasy RPG. (forget about Schwarzes Auge
	they are Schmidt Spiele and came years later to dig the gold)
<p>
	The CT stat where :
<ul>
<li>	200 Tonnes
<li>	Tech Level : 10
<li>	Crew 4
<li>	Jump drive A - 1 parsec
<li>	Thuster drive A - 1 G
<li>	Computer Model/1 - 2/4 standart software
<li>	Fuel 50 tonnes, enough for 4 weeks and 2 jumps
<li>	1 hard point
<li>	Price (including air raft and launch) 51 MCr
</ul>
	This ship is now rebuild on several yards in Gushemege, as
	the empire of the "Last Sane" provides enough freight capacity
	that there is no need for human driven cargo ships. In addition
	to the original design, this ship has a contra graph and a fuel
	scope.
<p>
	The crews of these ships especialy like that its posible to
	build and repair even main parts on nearly any hinterword in
	the wilds. Some of them also mention that the empires thinks
	that tech level A computers are to stupid for a full grown
	AI, and that therefore the ship is flight by hand.
<p>	
	In respect of the modern times the ships mainframes are normaly
	equiped with a sophisticated anti virus software, which has in
	games terms a defensive combat value of 7. In addition KP2 provides
	a tech level F tuneable laser with an interface for the tech level A
	sensor package of this ship. They also sell a better active sensor
	packages (tech level F, 300.000 km active EMS, ladar, fibre optics
	fire control, EMS jammer) which is often additionaly installed.

I was working on my weapons table and worked up grenades from real world

I\'m already doing it; I posted Joe\'s first infomail regarding IG after I
read it. However, it would be nice if mail could be posted to
rec.games.frp.misc at the same time it hits the TML. I\'m can\'t spend
every evening on the Web (my wife requires *some*
attention...fortunately :-) ) and given the somewhat recent flamewar
that went on there, it seems to be getting more and more attention from
non-TML subscribers who play Traveller (or want to). I\'ve noticed a
couple of threads regarding questions on the T4 rules which are, IMO, as
thought out and thought provoking as the ones in TML.

I tend to agree with Merrick on this (and not just because I liked his

Continental Divide with a 10 lb. daypack and a 35 lb. pack and I\'m
definitely in the STR 7 class. Even on easy trails, the daypack got old
after 4 hours of sitting on my shoulders. The 35 pounder felt like its

Good point and one I\'d not even considered!  I\'ve little inkling of

am certainly not suggesting IG violate copyright, but if what you say is in
fact the case, I hope they (DGP & IG) reach some amicable agreement that

Check Dave Golden\'s page.  I\'ve created simple writeups for several of 
the known pocket empires\' I\'ve trying to find the time to write up the

Harold, do you have a problem with me including a short writeup on the 
Solomani Rim in Dave Golden\'s TNE section?  Maps and sub-sector data?

PS do you have any official symbols reguarding those two pocket empires 
of yours.

Based off a set of deck plans I have, which were based off of the full 
scale mockup built for Empire Strikes Back, and visual clues from the 
movie\'s.  ie. The scene in Empire where Leia and Han are in the 
Electronic\'s room we can estimate that the doors to that room are 1m 
across.  And that the tubular corridor utalized in Star Wars was 2m 
across at it\'s widest point.  Also using a number of stills which were 
nicely included in the book and in other references I have here.  We can 
estimate that this deckplan was created on a 1:200 scale, that is 1 cm on 
the map equals 200cm or 2m in real life.  Thus, the length of the falcon 
works out on this map to be 32 cm or 64m long, tip of the forks to the 
back on the engines. and 22.5cm or 45m at it\'s widest point.

Now if we look at the deck plans and measurements presented in West End 
Games Star Wars source book we find that the Falcon is only 26.7 meters 
long.  That\'s their official measurement.

Thus, there is a huge discrepency in ship size here.  Do we trust what\'s 
been done off of original set plans contained within the Lucas Archives, 
a craft which is nearly 200 feet long, or do we trust WEG\'s plans and 
assume that the Falcon is only 80 feet long?  Again I\'d return to the 
photo evidence.  Empire Strikes Back, Han and Leia run to the Falcon from 
the Snow Troopers.  We get a distant shot where we see the Falcon sitting 
there with it\'s door open, then we cut to Han and Leia and 3PO running up 
the walkway.  Carrie Fisher is very short, 5\'2"-5\'4" at the most.  
Harrison Ford is not terribly large either, 5\'6"-5\'8", I can say this 
because at 6\'7" most people are short next to me.  8)

I\'d go with the 200\' concept rather than the 80\' concept.  Having been on 
a number of boats in that size range I\'ll tell you 80\' in modern 
standards doesn\'t make much of a cargo ship, plus there are large 
sections of the Falcon which we never see...

Living in mountain lion country, I can say that this is pretty much correct.
Most of the time when a human is attacked by a lion, it\'s because the human
startled the lion.  Make some allowances for carnivores in the appropriate
situation (i.e. a large pouncer lying in wait vs. a single human)

This is why GMs have brains.  A seesile creature isn\'t going to do much, is
it? Ignore the to Flee roll, and decide wether the thing considers
adventurer a tasty meal or not.  Fleeing might be a simple as a sea anonome
closing up when threatened, or a armildillo\'s "going ball" to foil a threat.
Be creative!

I think you misunderstood my intention. I think the idea that a pouncer will only attack if 
_it_i is surprised is funny

This was noted because one of the generally non-motiles has "if possible" listed under its 
flee rating. Again, it was humourous

Lastly, I think it is important to get these things corrected. As I stated in my original 
dialogue, I can easily figure solutions to these. New players might not. The last thing I 
want IG to do is to scare off new players because of errors. Traveller Gurus, such as 
yourself, may have 10 solutions for each problem, but a new player will not. I have 
spoke to people who have just started gaming and they are quite frequently intimidated 
by massive amounts of rules. They do not need them to be confusing in actuality and not 
just in principle

If I understand you correctly, you\'re saying that the chance of spectacular
failure should increase depending on the difficulty of the task, while the
chance of spectacular success should increase with easier tasks? 

Sure, why not? This would actually make more sense the T4 system, in which
spectacular success becomes *more likely* as you increase the task
difficulty. Spec Failure does too, but that\'s sensible. I don\'t see how
attempting the Impossible can *increase* your chance of an amazing success.
(Unless you subscribe to a Star Wars kind of "heroism bonus"...)

I think we can adapt some of the methods of the more popular percentile
systems. Terry Simpson, a friend of mine who once worked for the creators
of HarnQuest, was telling me about their system (I\'m not familiar with it
myself); in HQ, the magnitude of your success is measured by how far below
the target number you roll. The magnitude of failure, obviously, depends on
how far above the target you roll. I like this.

So in the 2D Task System, we might decide that a Spectacular Success occurs
if you roll at least 40 below the target number. Spectacular Failure occurs
if you roll at least 40 above the target number. (Perhaps that should be 30
above?) Sound about right?

Of course, two sixes and two ones are always Spectacular Results, regardless.

Thanks for the suggestion,

Glenn

You posted a new task system based on DGP\'s (didn\'t know they had their
own). Not having seen DGP\'s, I\'m not sure if I\'ve understood you correctly.


If I\'m not mistaken you\'re suggesting a system where a base target number
is modifed by -(stat/3) rounded down, and -skill level. Obviously you have
to roll higher than the result on 2D, and there\'s the first problem I see:
it\'s not entirely compatible with T4, where almost every skill test is a
roll *below* the target number. So none of the DMs in the book will make
sense without conversion, which could get confusing. You\'d have to change
on the negatives to positives and vice versa. Not a huge problem, I
suppose...

>From your example, we can extrapolate these numbers...

For stat  7 (hence mod of -2):
Your Example...           My figures...
Skill:  1                 Skill: 4   7

        2     Very Easy        Auto Auto
        5     Easy             Auto Auto  
        8     Average            5+ Auto
       11   Difficult            8+   5+
       14   Formidable          11+   8+
       17   Staggering          14+  11+
       20   Impossible          17+  14+

Erm, according to this, even with a skill of 7 this character can never
succeed at an Impossible feat. Have I missed something?

Hear. hear. I agree with Stu on this.

Another point, perhaps not raised yet (regarding the blank UWP data in
First Survey): if the players are supposed to be exploring these regions of
space for the first time, then rather obviously they shouldn\'t have any
*prior knowledge* of what they\'re going to find. If you\'ve been previously
running a Third Imperium or Regency or Rebellion campaign, then switch to
Milieu 0, the players are going to know in which direction to explore to
find, say, that nifty Ancient site with all the artifacts.... "Well, it\'s
there in the year 1100, so it must be there in the Holiday Year, right?"

Well, it will be. Unless you abandon the "canon" laid down by your previous
campaign.

This problem reminds me of all those brainless players I once knew, who
would buy every supplement and adventure that came on the market, even
though they had no intention of ever running them. Keeps the cash-boxes of
industry churning, I\'m sure, but it means these idiots cannot now play
those scenarios.

Too much information is one of the things that killed FRPGs for me. If you
own the Monster Manual, every AD&D monster you meet is a known quantity.
You know its hit dice, its weaknesses, its special attacks... yawn yawn
yawn. Where\'s the mystery? the intrigue? the horror (...the horror)?  Only
the better refs know to mix things up and invent new stuff from whole
cloth, to keep the game fresh and surprising. (At which point the idiots of
course scream, "Hey, you can\'t DO that! What d\'you mean the Droyne aren\'t
the Ancients???" [heh heh heh...])

Which is yet another reason why harping on "canonical" star positions and
UWPs is so incredibly dumb. 

YMMV (but if so, you might check your odometer cable), :)

Actually, you add DM\'s to the dice roll. Thus if you need a difficult roll your total of 2D 
+ DMs (situational, attribute and skill) has to equal or exceed
And yes, the skill of 7 would fail, unless he had a stat of at least 3 (total DM of +8)

difficult to get ANY Traveller stuff (Red Zone).
I started to becomne interested in Traveller quite a while ago and was 
just recently able to start my first MEGATRAVELLER Adventure. T3 and T4 
are no discussion. I asked a friend, who went to London, to look for T4 
Books, but he didn\'t get any.

So?

Keep on waiting! And smile ;-)

Look at it this way. Since the start and end points are moving at
different speeds, and are at "heights" in both the stellar and galactic
gravitational fields, it\'s not *possible* for the duration to be fixed.

Why? Because, time flows at different rates at each end. So if it takes
a week according to clocks at one end, it won\'t according to clocks at
the other end. 

Thus the time *must* be variable.

In Traveller "size" has a *specific* meaning with regards to celestial
bodies. It started out as *diameter* in *thousands of miles* (which is
how earth got to be size 8). They may have changed it to radius in
thousands of km later, but I\'m not sure.

So you need to come up with a different term for your figures.

Makes things kinda arbitrary, and as you have no doubt noted by now, it
makes for massive misunderstandings when talking to people using the
standard terminology.

Actuallly, high/middle/low passage, "slow" drug, and "fast" drug were
all *very* obviously swiped from E.C. Tubb\'s "Dumarest of Terra" series
of stories.

The thing is, the difference between middle passage and what you
describe above is essentially zero FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE SHIP
CAPTAIN. Other than volume occupied by the passengers, you don\'t save a
thing. You still have to have the *same* amount of air and water (and
recyling for same) per person. Ditto for waste management. And while
with Traveller tech the cost per mass isn\'t that bad, it\'s still a case
that like on an airline, the cost of hauling the food is almost as
important as the purchase price!

But it\'s the air, water, and recycling that are the big problem. Sure,
the cargo hold can be converted into a bunkroom letting you pack 50-100
people into a Free Trader. But the life support system can\'t handle it.
Check some of Heinlein or Clarke\'s older stuff for the per person air &
water requirements. As I vaguely recall you need at least a couple of
liters of water a day for drinking alone. Multiply that by 100 and a
week. Then add in water for washing, etc. 

Air and food just make things worse.

Sorry, copied the table with the wrong log-scale
Here\'s the new one.
STR      Unenc.      Unc.      H Enc.
1-2       2 kg       5 kg      7 kg
3-5       3 kg       7 kg      15 kg

9-11      7 kg       15 kg     30 kg
12-14     10 kg      20 kg     50 kg
15+       15 kg      30 kg     70 kg
Stuff carried in backpack count as half.
Armor worn count as half.
My definition of \'in backpack\' is \'not easily reached\' so the players don\'t
start to construct ingenious backholsters and the like.
Unencumbered characters can sprint (DEX 14+ guys make 100m in 10s)
Encumbered characters can trot
Heavily encumbered characters can walk

The reason for x1/2 for backpack load is simplicity, it is easier to calculate.

OK, how about this. With the current "technology" available in Traveller,
a 100 ton Missile Bay contains 100 missiles ... if you assume CT 0.1 ton
missiles, thats 90% "waste" space (yes, I know it\'s reloading mechanism,
but we\'re also talking 30 minute turns here for a 100 kilo missile!); if
you assume 0.5 ton missiles, its better ... only 50% waste space.

Now, why not have VLS Box launchers ... *no* reloading mechanism.
Currently the naval versions can get close to 50% (the extra space is
because rocket exhaust has to be vented), however, in space versions, this
is not required ... a squib charge can be used to launch them from the box
and then the main motor (thruster plate or heplar, whatever) can kick in
at a suitable distance so the hull paint doesn\'t get too badly scorched.
Assume that it is more like a airborne rocket pod, and gets (say) 75%
usable space, or 750 0.1 CTrav missiles or 150 0.5 ton missiles.

Assume the 0.1 ton  missiles for a moment ... take a modest sized vessel,
a Destroyer (3000 tons in Supplement #9) or a Fleet Escort (5000 tons).
Assume half of the possible number of VLS launchers are installed ... 15
for the Destroyer or 25 for the Escort. That means a standard Desron (8
"DDGs") will have a one shot salvo of *90000* missiles (18000 if you
assume 0.5 ton types). An Esron (8 Escorts) would have a one shot salvo of
150000 missiles (30000 0.5 ton types). I do not care what sort of fire
control you have on your PD systems, this sort of initial salvo is
effectively unstoppable if it is targetted effectively (i.e. against a
relatively small number of ships, based on their fire control capacities)
... it simply overwhelms the PD Fire control no matter how good it is.

It gives light craft something that will make them useful in "line of
battle" against the larger vessels that would simply brush them aside
under normal circumstances. However, I would *not* see this as
*necessarily* the way to go for larger vessels ... you need *some*
capacity for closer ("gun") combat and for survivability that lighter
craft simply cannot achieve. I do not see missiles as a guaranteed winner,
but as a method of evening the odds ... one of tradeoffs. Sure, you
*could* have a BB (500 kilotons) with a one shot salvo of almost 2
*million* missiles, but only by foregoing conventional weapons ... and
once the VLS systems are expended, they can only be reloaded by a fleet
tender, so its a poor choice if sustained combat is expected. This is why
I see it as something that light ships would use.

Hmm, no, but 90000 might well do so ... and a Desron that can take out a
BB is a pretty good investment (a DN in Supplement 9 is worth around 180
DDs).

     Ahh, David, I see you\'ve been reading my rgfm posts then ;-).
     
     For the brief period that I had access to the rec.* newsgroups, I 
     tried to answer T4 system questions, and contribute towards

     Joe posting his IG FAQ to rgfm is an excellent idea.  It shows that IG

        1) They were briefly cited in DGP Vilani & Vargr as the first human
spacefaring race which Vilani met (with borrowed technology, of course).
        2) They were depicted in an illustration of DGP Solomani & Aslan,
with no mention (short and tall).
        3) In Hard Times, there was a "Geoneecide" against them made by
Marquis Tanzer, a noble akin to Margaret. The TNS news were incorporated to
Survival Margin. Thay briefly stated that there was a Geonee region of ten
worlds centered an the Shiwonee subsector. I was stated by Tanzer that the
fact of the Geonee being short and tall made them "easier to kill" when harmed.

        Are there any canon/noncanon materials on them? Is IG (or DGP)
planning something? Was GDW planning something? Thanks to anybody who can help.

The mechanics or the background?  In either case, I don\'t own any

Hmm...World Builders Handbook and the alien modules. All the DGP stuff

And the Solomani didn\'t discover j-drive until after they had thoroughly
explored their own solar system. And according to DGP, there were
ancient sites in the outer system and/or asteroid belt...

In the aliens books (1-8 by GDW and 1-2 (new and better) by DGP
Vilani, IMO, would look sort of like a polynesian swede (?) in terms of features and 
appearance, ie fine featured but dark skinned (Vilani & Vargr mentions that they have 
darker skin to deal with Vland\'s brighter star and the pictures give them fairly sharp 
features)
Zhodani look sort of arabic, with a touch of european
the minor race Suerrat look like neanderthals, the Geonee like slavic dwarves
the jonkereen (desert dwelling minor human race) look like arabs with samurai haircuts
That is all I could find quickly

        Minor correction: Nicean Creed is NOT "also known as" Apostle\'s
Creed. The apostolic creed dates back to the early church (1st century, or
so), and begins "I Believe..." It\'s also much shorter.

        The Nicean Creed is slightly more recent, when some emperor or such
got tired of all the inconsistencies between various various "bishops,"
"apostles," etc., and forced them to sit down in a city called Nicea and
explain what exactly being a Christian meant. That\'s why it starts out "We
Believe ..."

standards doesn\'t make much of a cargo ship, plus there are large 
sections of the Falcon which we never see..."

200\'!, this would make the Falcon come out to around 900 dtons.  After a
bit of digging around I see that "The Art of the Empire Strike Back" has
the sound stage layout for the main hanger on Hoth.  Using the measurements
shown on this layout I calculate the length of the full size Falcon mockup
was just under 27 meters, that same size used by WEG.  Unfortunately, when
I calculated the displacement of the Millennium Falcon to be around 150 to
200 dtons I assumed that my model was about 1/76 scale (making the Falcon
35 meters long).  However, since the ship is only 27 meter long the ship\'s
displacement should be around 70 to 100 dtons.  This really doesn\'t make
for much of a cargo ship, but it does fit on a sound stage. (BTW, at 27
meters long make the model of the Falcon about 1/60 scale, a great fit for
those Grenadier Star Wars minis)

"Scout Uniform" is an oxymoron. Most Scouts in the field have as much use for a uniform 
as they do the HQ weenies who send them out to survey new worlds -- and, all too often, 
die in the attempt.

My Scout characters have what I call the "Scout Attitude." They say: stick the military 
filagee and gold braid where starlight never penetrates! Scouts are spacers too low-born 
and/or authority-adverse to make it in the Navy and too lacking in guile to make it as 
merchies. The IISS is the working stiff\'s ticket into space; what a Scout may lack in 
raw brainpower and social connections, he makes up for in sheer guts and raw 
practicality (which is why Scouts get J-o-T skill: the skill is a measure of how 
\'practical\' a character is). The reliance on grit over firepower, tactical/technical 
wizardry, guile and social connections makes for what a 20th-C Terran would call "An 
Attitude." Survival by one\'s sheer grit in a hostile universe breeds the attitude that 
Scouts can overcome anything a hostile universe can throw at them.

This leads to stereotypes. Uniformed types see the Scout\'s rejection of the military 
mentality as evidence of a kind of wild indiscipline. Those who populate the upper 
(social and military ranks) ranks of the Armed Forces view this as evidence of social 
inferiority. Scouts view the military types insistience on uniforms, saluting, ranks and 
so forth as a worldview that substitutes regimentation for practicality.

Every once in a while, the topic of world population distributions
comes up on this list, usually accompanied by the assertion that
pleasant worlds are bound to be more populous than unpleasant worlds.

I don\'t buy this assertion. If it were true, then it should be reflected
in real life here on earth. In other words, the island of Oahu should
have a higher population than the island of Manhattan (It doesn\'t). And
New Zealand should have a higher pop than Great Britain. And Wyoming
should have a higher pop than New Jersey. And so on ad nauseam.

In fact, pleasure is rarely the first factor in determining where people
live. The primary factors are usually economic and social.

1) Where are the jobs and how much do they pay? The largest number of
high-paying jobs can be found on industrial worlds. And the quality of the
industry is rarely going to be proportional to the pleasantness of the
environment.

2) What is the cost of living and how much is the real estate? Pleasant
worlds are going to cost more to live on (typically) because the land is
in demand  by people who can afford it. In a technologically advanced
civilization, hostile environs are not going to drive up the cost of
living as much as they do today. So places like Pittsburgh are going to
be cheaper to live in than places like Aspen or Key West.

3) Who lives there already and do they like me? Nice places almost
always have laws that restrict the number and kind of people who can
move there. New Zealand, Canada, and the US are all famous (imfamous?) 
for being difficult to move to.

4) What\'s happening there? People usually want to move to places where
there\'s a lot going on. These are more likely to be places that already
have a lot of people living there for the reasons listed above. There
are more people moving to Chicago, Illinois than to St. Clairsville,
Ohio, despite the fact that St. Clairsville has a lower cost of living and
a much nicer climate. Chicago is an exciting place; St. Clairsville is out
in Nowheresville.

So if you find that Traveller\'s population distributions don\'t make much
sense to you, I\'d say that you might be working from faulty assumptions.

Just my Cr 0.02.

 Certainly - consider the Schalli from T:TNE.  But (see note

 are the exception rather than the rule.  As IG/FFE release

 for them as well.  As of right now, the only race we have the

 Well, yes and no.  Different planetary chemistries will result
 in different limitations to technological development.  There
 are two very good books that address these topics, both under
 the Writer\'s Digest Books imprint - look for _Aliens_and_Alien_
 _Societies_, ISBN 0-89878-706-3, and _World_Building_, ISBN
 0-89879-707-1.  They are both well-written, and quite
 interesting.

 400 non-humans races out of 11,000 planets in 1100?  Sort of
 suggests that humans are the most common encounter.

I checked that and...you are right

Great, the entire human race is minor
Just anote about the vargr, Grandfather left an android to watch over them. What if this 
pseudo-bio actually was the one that gave the vargr the secret to the stars (otherwise the 
doggies would probably have driven themselves to extinction. 
(in short, if I am no longer a member of a major race, no one else is either)
While I am at it. The Vilani experimented with an inferior jump drive before developing 
the standard version. Maybe _that _was the one they discovered. It did not work very 
well, so they gave up and used the available ones they had (ancients devices)
You will note the Hivers also developed this drive first before developing the standard
So we are down to K\'kree and Droyne
The droyne did develop it (well, one of them did) (ie the ancient greeks were not 
influenced by the ancient greeks to quote the Principia Discordia)
So when it comes down to it, the only major races are the little lizards and the horseys
What a blow for humanoid pride

Kind of blows the whole major race thing straight to hell, don\'t it?
Alien Module Six, Solomani
p 4. 
The first use of jump drive was entirely within the Solar System. It enabled fast 
expeditions to the outer worlds and made possible several colonies in the outer worlds. 
UNSCA did not realize that the drives had a great enough range to reach the stars.

Sounds like people who are experimenting with something they do not really understand. 
With even modern physics you could probably figure out what the thing will do. This 
sounds very suspicious.

I agree 100%
Though I am not sure why I am in Toronto (I wonder if the people of the Traveller 
universe suffer from this as well?)

People follow jobs. The best examples of all time are the agricultural, industrial and 
information revolutions. They are and were all great upheavals, and with the new

Harn (by Columbia Games) uses a d100 system which treats each
percentile die roll that ends with either a "0" or a "5" as being a
*critical* result.  For example:

If the target number is 42 (percent), all results <=3D42 are a success
while all results >42 are a failure.  Furthermore, a result of 05, 10,
15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 would be a *critical* success while a
result of 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, and 00 would be
a *critical* failure.

It might be possible, for your 2d Task System, to state that any d66
result ending in a "1" (ie: 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, and 61) would be a
*critical* or *outstanding* result, using the same technique.

It would be easy enough to use coloured paint or a crayon to fill in
the single dot for the "1" result on the second die, making this
distinction very easy to make (much easier than trying to calculate
how much a die roll exceeds a particular target number since it would
be immediately apparent when the coloured "1" appears).

I haven\'t even received my hardback of T4 yet but from what others
have said about the task system, I think I like your d66 system better
:-)

Not necessarily.  When physicists first uncovered the principle of the
LASER, I\'m sure they have no concept of it\'s use in everyday items, like
CD-ROMs, range finders, gyroscopes, anti-missile defenses, etc.  
The problem may have been in the initial design--perhaps early Terran
Jumpdrives used a very inefficient design or weren\'t able to deliver
enough power to the jump-grid to make a very long jump (maybe they
didn\'t have Zuchai crystals and were forced to use Folger\'s <gdr>)

Drive developed on Mars failed to day, but the coffee was extremely
good...."

Sorry for the mistake. With the way you were talking, I thought you 
were Imperium games.  I did leave them two messages at the address
you indicate earlier.  I haven\'t heard from them and I find this very 
frustrating.  Sorry again.

Maybe you should clarify (for me and the other nincompoops (is that the 
word?) who don\'t know who you are?

Q.  Will the next printing of T4 have new artwork?

A.  The next printing of T4 will simply have errata in the back of it.  
The printing after that will be version 1.1, and will simply have the 
errors corrected (same artwork).


Q.  What is IG\'s copyright policy in regards to original works posted to 
the Traveller Mailing List, WWW sites, and/or Usenet?

A.  Just include "Traveller is a Registered Trademark of FarFuture 
Enterprises.  Copyright (c) 1996" in the document, and IG will be fine 
with it.  Be aware that this makes your work the property of FFE, though.


Q.  Is there any way around this?

A.  Yes.  Don\'t mention Traveller in your article, and don\'t pull 
material from any Traveller product.  Say it is an article for use with 
science fiction RPG\'s, and keep it generic.


Q.  What is the policy regarding copying previously published works by 
GDW or IG to the internet?

A.  You have to get written permission from Marc Miller in order to 
legally do so.  He holds all the copyrights on all such material.


Q.  When will [insert product here] be shipped?

A.  The correct schedule for products to be shipped (that is, when they
will begin to be shipped to dealers and those who ordered directly through
IG) is:

        Starships                       November 1
        JTAS                            November 1
        Citizens of the Imperium        November 15
        Aliens Archive                  November 15
        Central Supply Catalog          December 1
        Milieu 0                        December 15
        First Survey                    December 15


Q.  When is the web site going to be updated?  How about weekly updates?

A.  The folks at IG have been on extended vacation for the last couple of
weeks.  Starting next week, the web site will be updated _at least_ once
per week.


Q.  When is my T4 hardback going to arrive? 

A.  Foreign orders will take longer to arrive than orders shipped to 
the continental U.S.  In addition, some orders within the U.S. were
shipped Priority Mail, while others were shipped 4th Class.  The method
of shipping depended on the date the order was placed.  4th Class mail
takes quite a bit longer to arrive than Priority, so please be patient
and you should receive it shortly.


Q.  I really don\'t like [insert a rule from T4 here] . . .

A.  If you don\'t like something about any IG product, feel free to change
it!  The folks at IG realize they aren\'t gods, and are therefore unable
to create the perfect system for everyone.  Their philosophy is that they
are producing _guidelines_, not laws carved in stone.


Q.  My local game store doesn\'t carry Traveller products.  (Or, "There
aren\'t any Traveller players in my area.")

A.  Ask the owner of your friendly local game store if you can run a 
demo of the Traveller game.  If s/he will let you do so, some ideas 
for what to do include:
        1)  Run through some _extremely simple_ scenarios with 
            prospective customers.  These might be simply hitting
            a target - give them a character, a situation, a little
            build up, and a number to roll.  Act out the consequences.
        2)  Get a few members of your gaming group together, and play
            at the store, if they\'ll allow it and have an area where
            customers can stop by and watch you play.
        3)  Your own ideas

        The point is, demand drives supply.  If you would like to see a 
supply of Traveller products at your local game store, help to create the 
demand and let the game store owner know that demand exists.  If you can 
stir up enough demand among the gaming community in your area, the game 
store owner will almost certainly begin carrying lots of Traveller products.
        Plus, you you may end up making some new gaming friends! :)


Q.  Where do I send questions regarding IG and/or Traveller?

A.  It depends.  If it is a business-related question (such as license 
fees or distributor information), it should be addressed directly to 
Imperium Games (1-414-249-9430).  
    Other questions, such as those regarding what is meant by a given 
rule in an Imprium Games product, when a given supplement is due out, 
theory behind the technology used in the Traveller game (jump drives, 
sensors, starships, etc.), or other such questions, they should be 
addressed to either the TML (preferred) or to me personally 
(ransom@iconnect.net).
    But please be aware that any emailed question may be re-posted 
publicly, if I feel my reply should be made public to avoid duplication.  
I reserve the right to re-post any email sent to me regarding IG and/or 
Traveller.
    Please also be aware that messages posted to TML may not be answered 
unless it is made evident that an "official" answer is requested.
    Finally, at times it will be necessary for me to share questions with 
those who know more than I do about specific topics (i.e., a question about 
product release dates will be posed to someone at IG).  
    In other words, such communications are NOT considered private.

So, I will repeat it

If you roll animal damage (ie pre-roll) then how do you work in armour (which subtracts 
dice not damage) and how would you deal with initial and subsequent wounds. If each 
die is separate, then how do you distribute an animal attack of 11 points. Or even if you 
kept the dice, how would you divvy up 2D x 3, as each die tripled?

As I stated before, I have been  a gamer for 14 years now and can figure out a house 
rule. But if you want Traveller to appeal to new gamers (I sure do) these things need to 
be addressed

But they still new what exactly it could do when they built one. 
The phrase used in the book was something to the effect of they did not know what 
range it had. This seems to indicate either sloppy science, or it was something they really 
did not understand

Hmm... Well, even if there were ancient sites in the solar system I still
believe that we developed the jump drive independently.  Perhaps, finding
those ancient sites led to the research making jump drives available but in
my game the Solomani are still a major race.10

An entire issue of *Travellers\' Digest* (by DGP) was devoted to the
Shiwonee/Massilia area, with cultural and physical notes on the Geonee.  I
can\'t remember the issue number off-hand, but can check when I\'m home with
my library.

Note, also, that the odd-looking "lanes" of mixed-bureaux space on the map
of the Ziru Sirka in DGP\'s V&V make sense if you interpret the "pocket" 
they join to in Massilia as the Geonee\'s already well-developed area, set
aside by the Ishimkarun as "common ground" to prevent them all fighting
each other for the trade opportunities.

     There are two ways this could have happened: 
     1. The Ancients took H. Sapiens from Terra, OR
     2. The Ancients took pre-Sapiens hominids from Terra, geneered from

     to the Ancients, just like the Vargr. Once H.Sapiens were planted on 
     Terra, they overran the earlier hominid species.

    'body' => '     Why aren\'t plasma/fusion weapons listed in T4? I have an idea for an 
     explanation: 
     
     The PGMP-12 arrives around TL12 (naturally!), which is around where 
     the microfusion technology \'Fusion Plus\' comes in. It looks like the 
     PGMP would be a spinoff of Fusion Plus technology. Sound plausible?
     
     The development of the microfusion containment bottle that allows 
     teeny tiny fusion power plants, permits even smaller *plasma* 
     containment bottles. A primitive version of this was turned into the 
     slow but nasty PGMP-12; future refinements led to the PGMP-13/14, 
     FGMP-14/15/16, and TL16 Plasma Rifle (Fusion Rifle? I forget which!)
     
     This would place the Milieu Zero Imperium at early to mid TL12, with 
     prototypes at late TL12 and early TL13. The PGMP-12 is probably 
     available in prototype form in Year Zero, and will probably be 
     perfected sometime soon after Year Zero, probably by Zhunastu 
     technicians again (given their strong lead in Fusion Plus technology). 
     
     The PGMP-12, as a section or platoon support weapon, would give the 
     Imperial ground forces a substantial advantage over gauss rifle/RAM GL 
     equipped adversaries. 
     
     OFFICIAL QUESTION: 
     When is Fusion Plus developed? For it to have a significant impact on 
     the expansion of the late Federation into the Imperium, it probably 
     had to have been around a couple of decades in Year Zero. I\'d place 
     the invention at about -20 to -25. 
     
     OFFICIAL COMMENT: I think inserting some inventions/technological 
     developments into the \'official\' timeline, especially between years 
     -50 to +50, would give GMs a good feel for the pace of development in 
     the early Imperium.

     After the mysterious death of her older sister, Alexandra was unable 
     to pursue her intended career as an historical scholar. She was 
     recalled home and trained in the duties of a high noble; during this 
     time she showed strong ability in administrative and diplomatic work 
     and was formally confirmed Baroness (commissioned). On taking office, 
     she quietly investigated her sister\'s death and discovered that her 
     sister had died at the hands of a Zhunastu corporate agent. Commenced

     IV Noble       Diplomacy-1, +1 STR, Law-1, Admin-1
     Baroness Aurion took her seat on the Grand Senate, and showed great 
     talent in the cut-and-thrust of Federation politics, mainly in 
     opposition to President Cleon\'s and his Expansionist faction. She 
     developed major alliances within her own Federalist faction, and 
     drafted a number of industrial laws, treaties and Moot protocols; most 
     of which, by strange coincidence, attacked Cleon\'s political and 
     financial interests. She also gained appointments to a number of minor 
     Senate committees. Continued physical fitness program. 
     
     V  Noble       Admin-1, Diplomacy-2, Leader-1, Intimidation-1 
     Political ability led to Aurion\'s elevation to Countess (promotion). 
     Aurion began gathering a broad coalition of political factions opposed 
     to Cleon\'s Expansionist policies. During this term, Aurion became 
     widely known in the Senate as a leader, a powerful orator, and a very 
     bad person to annoy. 
     
     VI Noble       +1 SOC, Intimidation-1, Vac Suit-1, Interrogation-1
     In this term, Aurion became leader of the Federalist faction, and was 
     elected chair of the Senate Rules and Finance Committees, with 
     consequent elevation to Marquise. Aurion established her reputation as 
     a fearsome questioner; bureaucrats and military leaders dreaded 
     appearance before the Rules and Finance committees, particularly if 
     they supported the Zhunastu conglomerate or Expansionist policies. 
     During this term, Aurion made an eternal enemy of Cleon, by blocking 
     Federation finance for key Expansionist policies, forcing Cleon to 
     fund them from his own resources. 
     
     VII    Noble       Law-1, Interrogation-1, Diplomacy-1, Admin-1 
     Marquise Aurion was elected Deputy President of the Grand Senate. 
     Although heavily burdened with administrative duties, she still 
     managed to engage in Moot politics and drafted many laws and Moot 
     rules. Late in the term, Deputy President Aurion fell completely out 
     of favour as a result of President Cleon\'s increasing control of the 
     Senate. 
     
     MUSTERING OUT      Yacht, TAS Membership, Pistol-4 
     Officially suspended from Senate duties to pursue \'personal 
     interests\'. Cr250k Moot Sabbatical payment with Cr8k annuity. Received 
     Yacht and TAS membership. Took ceremonial pistol and became adept in 
     using it. 
     
     Character Outline: 
     When Cleon dissolved the Grand Senate and declared himself Emperor, he 
     contrived that Arion\'s powerful position of Deputy President of the 
     Grand Senate, which controlled most of the administrative and 
     financial dealings of the Senate, was transferred to the status of a 
     ceremonial figurehead within the Imperial Moot. Key posts, including 
     Cleon\'s former position of President, were filled by his supporters 
     among the nobility. 
     
     Aurion declined the ceremonial sinecure in the Imperial Moot, and took 
     a leave of absence with Emperor Cleon\'s blessing. Now that Cleon has 
     declared himself Emperor, Aurion\'s suspension from duty is effectively 
     permanent. The Marquise travels the frontiers, encouraging opposition 
     to the Third Imperium. 
     
     Aurion is dedicated to halt or delay Imperial expansion by any means 
     possible. She and Cleon are politically unable to strike each other 
     directly, but use covert methods to thwart each others\' plans. As of 
     Year Zero, she and Cleon are engaged in a shadowy war of diplomats, 
     spies and saboteurs. 
     
     Aurion maintains quiet contacts among her former Federalist 
     colleagues, who make up the Democratic Coalition in the Moot. Her 
     allies defend her interests in the Moot and the Imperial Court, and 
     covertly feed her resources and information in the hope that she can 
     blunt Cleon\'s victory.  
     
     Cleon has forbidden Aurion\'s name to be mentioned in his presence. 
     Courtiers therefore tactfully refer to Aurion by her formal title, 
     "the Marquise of Black Shroud", or simply as "Black Shroud". 
     
     Referee\'s Notes:
     Aurion is a tragic figure in the classic sense. She is painfully aware 
     that her ongoing opposition to Cleon and the Expansionists in the 
     Grand Senate was, ironically, played a part in Cleon\'s decision to 
     dissolve the Federation and declare himself Emperor. 
     
     Aurion will always use diplomatic, legal or covert methods to strike 
     at Cleon, because her family maintains extensive industrial and 
     property holdings within Imperial territory. Aurion\'s plans generally 
     meet with mixed results; like her efforts to block Cleon in the 
     Senate, her successes often accelerate the very process she is trying 
     to stop. For example, her success in encouraging a key subsector in 
     refusing to join the Imperium might give Cleon a pretext for reducing 
     that subsector by military siege or economic blockade. 
     
     Aurion is physically very small, and appears to be in her mid-twenties 
     because she has been using anagathics for the past twenty years. She 
     is of near-pure Solomani Russian heritage, which is a source of 
     considerable tension between her and "that vicious mongrel, Cleon". 
     Her Intimidation skill relies on her Social and Intelligence stats, 
     rather than her physical strength. 
     
     She is adept at cutting through legal and administrative red tape, and 
     delights in punishing or embarrassing Cleon\'s supporters wherever 
     possible. Opponents sometimes make the mistake of judging by her 
     physical appearance, which is an error that only the powerful survive. 
     
     The greatest achievement of Aurion\'s career was in building fear and 
     intense distrust of Third Imperium among the worlds of Meshan, Mendan 
     and Amdukan. This resistance eventually led to the Julian War of 
     175-191, bringing a permanent end to the Imperium\'s coreward 
     expansion. 
     
     Ironically, she did not live to see this victory. Zhunastu assassins 
     finally killed her in 52, less than a year before Cleon\'s own death.

     It looks like Imperial scouts and traders were in the Marches for 
     about 100 years before anybody discovered the Darrians! Why is this 
     so? The dates tell the story. 
     
     Let\'s listen in to a lecture in History of the Marches 201 at the 
     University of Regina, c.1110. The lecturer is Professor Eneri Aulech, 
     an academic who is infamous for her theory that the Zhunastu Dynasty 
     did not invent Fusion Plus technology, but merely copied it from Rule 
     of Man artifacts. 
     
     *********************************************************************
     Cleon I concentrated upon expanding the Imperium, mainly by peaceful 
     means. He generally offered economic incentives to join what was 
     basically a free trade federation. If states refused, he would simply 
     establish tariff barriers around them and push on, figuring that they 
     would eventually want to join as their economies lagged behind the 
     Imperium. In order to fulfil his bargain with the Vilani to provide 
     protection from Vargr raiders and \'Psionic Boogeymen\', Cleon 
     established outposts beyond Vland in the Corridor and Deneb sectors. 
     
     Cleon\'s secondary aims in settling the Trans-Rift territories were to 
     locate the fabled Zhodani and outflank the Vargr. Scouting and trade 
     routes through the Spinward Marches were concentrated almost 
     exclusively on the coreward subsectors. In 50, the Zhodani contacted 
     Imperial traders, leading to the settlement of Mora in 60 as an 
     outpost along the fledgeling trade route. 
     
     By the time of Cleon\'s death in 53, the Imperium resembled a (*very* 
     large) piece of Swiss cheese. Mora was the largest of a very small 
     number of Imperial colonies in the Marches. Cleon\'s successor, Cleon 
     II, felt that the Imperium was overextended to spinward, and decided 
     to consolidate, which gained him the name of Cleon the Weak among the 
     Expansionists in the Moot. 
     
     In the first century, the Moot was far from the rubber stamp it is in 
     today\'s Imperium; the Democratic coalition still exerted considerable 
     influence over the policies of the Imperium, while the Expansionists 
     were the basis of the Emperor\'s support among the nobility. By 
     alienating the Expansionists, Cleon II had ensured that his chance of 
     gaining approval for new policies was precisely zero. This is 
     generally believed to be the reason behind his emphasis on 
     consolidation within existing territories, for which he did not 
     require support in the Moot. 
     
     Cleon II removed the Scout Service from exploration outside existing 
     Imperial borders, which left a mere trickle of independent trade 
     though the Marches, which were defended by minimal Naval forces. He 
     directed the Scouts to concentrate on recontact within the borders of 
     the old *Ziru Sirka*, especially towards the Solomani Rim and the 
     coreward frontier. 
     
     Cleon II\'s successor, Artemsus, found that the \'holes\' in the Imperium 
     were beginning to disrupt trade; some of them were issuing letters of 
     marque to privateers and evading Imperial trade tariffs. Artemsus 
     found that the megacorporations (largely owned by Expansionist 
     nobility) would support him in a campaign against these \'recalcitrant\' 
     enclaves. 
     
     Artemsus issued an ultimatum to these troublesome states: take their 
     proper place as subjects of the Imperium, or be declared rebels. Some 
     joined, but many refused. The Emperor therefore appointed Archdukes 
     from among his Expansionist supporters, who were made responsible for 
     subduing their respective Domains. From 76-120 the Imperium\'s vast 
     resources were heavily engaged in the Pacification Campaigns, leaving 
     little for exploitation of the Marches. 
     
     The Domains were assigned as follows: Antares, Vland, Sylea (the 
     Emperor himself was Archduke of Sylea), Gateway, Ilelish, and Sol. The 
     Pacification Campaigns progressed well, although Vland found it 
     difficult holding their borders against the Vargr. The Antarean 
     campaign met with substantial resistance among the sectors that later 
     became the Julian Protectorate, while the Gateway campaign ground to a 
     halt through lack of finances, before any major gains could be made 
     beyond the Lesser Rift. 
     
     After the Pacification Campaigns ended in 120, the Archdukes spent 
     considerable time maintaining garrisons in captured territory. 
     Gradually the conquered territories quietened, releasing resources for 
     further exploration. Between 130 and 140, trade routes through the 
     Spinward Marches were reestablished, with further scouting in the 
     Rimward subsectors of the Marches leading to contact with the Darrians 
     in 148. 
     
     By this time the potential of the Spinward Main was recognised, with 
     the result that the Marches exploded with economic growth from 
     150-200. Of course, the increased volume of trade in the Marches, 
     Deneb and Corridor sectors proved to be very attractive to Vargr 
     corsairs. Under pressure from the Vilani megacorporations, the 
     Imperium finally took the battle to the enemy with the Vargr campaigns 
     from 210-348.

Which means they can use any material I place on my web site WITHOUT paying
me?  I hope not.  Seriously though, am I right in my interpretation of this
writing.  Say I put a starship up on my page (using T4 rules), and have the
proper copyright information on it.  This means that IG can come along and
use it for whatever they want, because they own it?

Covered as part of the ticket price for passengers. Covered as part of
life support for crew.

> Convoy Escort Fees

Since when are the ships travelling in convoys? And if this is a
*military* escort, the "fees" are "your tax dollars at work". 

Reality check. IN WWI and WWII there were no such fees charged.

> Tariffs, Duties, Taxes, and other government fees (avoided when smuggling)

Mentioned in passing in the rules but not detailed.

> Brokerage fees

Mentioned rather prominently in the rules! Mostly in examples of *why*
you needed certain skills...

> Delivery charges

Those tend to be *retail* fees. Starships count as "wholesale". Even if
you don\'t agree with that, if you get charged a "delivery fee for the
cargo, you\'ll either be very upset with the cargo broker who sold it to
you, or it will have been *included* in the negotiations.

And at the other end, *you* are the one who\'d be *charging* the fee.

Also, look up what F.O.B. means with regards to shipments.

> Loading/unloading charges (or, perhaps, heavy equipment rental)

Since starships can\'t easily have the huge open "side" that surface
vessels do, you have to build a lot of the container handling gear into
the ship. A small crane/hoist that can be run out from the hatch to
raise/lower containers at lower tech ports deals with the rest. Once
it\'s sitting "dockside" it\'s the *customer\'s* problem unless he pays
extra. In which case you rent a vehicle, and charge him that *plus*.

> Furniture, curtains, linens, little bars of soap, complimentary towels,
> etc etc for passenger and crew staterooms

Most of these are not "consumables". And as such, they come under
"maintenance". Remember, these are *not* luxury liners. You are
essentially taking passage on a tramp steamer. So don\'t expect "Hilton"
service. More like Motel 6.

> Plates, silverware, condiments, finger bowls, napkins, dishwashing liquid,

Water is *not* a problem in a closed environment. In fact, since human
metabolism *produces* water, you\'ll end up with more water than you
started with.

On the average ship, napkins are going to be recylable fiber ("paper")
not linen. There won\'t *be* finger bowls. Plumbing fixtures are part of
the ships life support systems.

All of this comes under life support. That includes recycling.
Depending on the level of recycling/life support, there won\'t *be* a
septic tank, ditto for a lot of waste removal.

Given the *huge* amounts of waste heat available from the power plant,
at a minimum, the wastes would be heated to drive of water and other
volatiles, and the solids sterilized (by heat, radiation, or both). The
water would get distilled and re-used. The solids can be *sold*
groundside, or on larger ships they go into the recycling system (which
is primarily *organic*)

Oxygen can be released from the excess water, and the CO2 "cracked"
into oxygen and "soot". That\'s only for small ships though. Larger ones
will use plants to recycle air, water, and portions of the wastes. 

Septic tanks are a *bad* idea for shipboard use. They rely on anaerobic
bacteria and are *really* touchy about some things, and can give off
dangerous gases. Processing using aerobic bacteria is actually safer
and easier. You effectively "compost" the wastes. And the result is
ready to be used in the ship\'s "farm".

> There\'s quite a bit to this starship economics thing that doesn\'t seem to

Some is *assumed*. Other portions are actually "hidden" in other items,
such as "life support" and "maintenance".

Remember, this "cooling" is more along the lines of a charge "leaking"

Better re-read Neutron Star. The ship was most definitely armed. Bey

Well, I like Holst, or just about any John Williams score, but I tend to be
looking for a more upbeat tone.  You might try some Nine Inch Nails, though.

I almost always go with instrumentals since lyrics tend to distract the
players, although sometimes I\'ll throw in hints about what\'s going on,
either through lyrics or song titles.

Certain parts of the "Babylon 5" soundtrack (Christopher Franke) would do
quite nicely, though some of the more melodramatic pieces you may wish to
save for queues. Other Vangelis and early Jarre, Vollenweider\'s "Down to
the Moon"... lots of things to choose from.

Woah, woah. This is NOT what the legal contact at Imperium Games told me
when I asked exactly what I needed to put on my web pages to make them
kosher. The only text on my page
(http://w3.one.net/~cinnamon/traveller.html) is this:

Traveller is a registered trademark of FarFuture Enterprises. All rights
reserved.

I can see Imperium Games wanting this, and also wanting you to copyright
your *own* pages (which is not a bad idea in and of itself) so that someone
cannot come along and reprint them. The statement above just reinforces
FarFuture\'s trademark status on Traveller.

Heh.  I\'m probably the nincompoop, for not making it clear right away.

Here\'s a good way to think of it:  I\'m like a reporter.  I have the 
equivalent of a "press pass" with IG.  I can find out information that 
others can\'t.  And I report that information to you.  That\'t it. :)

Sorry for not responding sooner.  What I usually do is write down 
questions that I think need "official answers," then when I call IG I ask 
them, THEN I respond.  Maybe I should revise this policy.

Anyway, that was on the list of questions I asked Ken Whitman today 
(taking time out from my parent\'s visit - they visit once every four 
years, so feel priviledged[G]).  Unfortunately, that and other 
rules-related questions were put on a list to be answered by them later 
this week.  Meaning, Ken didn\'t have an answer handy, and no one nearby 
to him had an answer.  They have to look through their notes or whatever, 
to see what (mistakenly) wasn\'t published in T4.  
Same goes for the cost of Diplo, Helmets, and Reflec, by the way.

Not necessarily.  *FFE* could come along and use it.  You see, you are 
building on AND REFERENCING a property of FarFuture Enterprises.  Without 
FFE, you wouldn\'t HAVE a product/article/whatever.  

To get around this, you have to get a Letter of Permission from FFE, or 
pay for a License.  

Why?  Without enforcing those rules, FFE could LOSE it\'s Trademark and 
Copyrights!  That\'s the way the law works.

Xerox has to VIROROUSLY pursue those who say their photocopiers
"xerox."  Similar for Kimberly-Klark and their trademark "Kleenex."  In 
private conversaton is one thing, but once it is public - ie, Puffs (TM) 
calling their products "Kleenex" - there is a legal problem, whether the 
TM owner wants to face it or not.

Let\'s say FFE let people use the Traveller trademark, and produce 
products (even not for sale) for free, and continue owning those 
products.  Then let\'s say I come along and produce a product, say it is 
for Traveller, and start selling it without paying FFE a license fee.  If 
Marc hauled me into court over it, I could point to all the people he let 
slide, and say that Traveller was no longer a Trademark, but rather it 
was in the public domain - a generic name - because he let others use it 
without paying a license fee.  I would almost certainly WIN, and be 
allowed to sell my "Traveller" products without paying Marc.

In short, it doesn\'t mean IG and FFE/Marc Miller are jerks - they HAVE to 
treat it that way if they want to retain their legal rights.

Hope this clears it up.


- -Joe
PS: I personally doubt it that FFE/IG would publish someone\'s work 
without at least asking permission. (My personal opinion, mind you.)  But, 
legally, yes, you are correct - anything with the Traveller name on it 
is either MM\'s property, or he has licensed it to be made.  There  can 
be no in-between, legally speaking.

In reality, he asked whether it was the case that IG wanted me to post

I completely misread Roger\'s email to me.

The CSC is split into "Imperial Surplus", a small selection of items that

useful to adventurers on a budget (10 scrap APC\'s for the price of 
one...), "Adventuring Gear" (ranging from compasses to grapple guns), 
"Personal Protection" (armor, spacesuits, etc), "Miscellaneous Goods"
(stuff that didn\'t fit into other categories) and vehicle design/combat,
liberally sprinkled with the add-on rules you need to use some of the items.

There is nothing really wierd or out of the way in there, and most of it is
designed for Mileu 0 play (i.e. TL12-), with some items of advanced
electronics of higher TL, and the vehicle rules cover design up to and
including TL15, which should be largely compatible with power systems and
design concepts for starships.

I believe that one of the earliest detractors of the newly-discovered

No, noone could come along and use it. According to Imperium\'s own web
page, the ONLY thing you have to do is acknowledge FFE\'s registered
trademark -- Traveller. That\'s fine.

Look at the "Other Sites" page on the web site. The symbol given in the
text of the disclaimer you have to use is the (R) -- not the (C). With a
Letter of Permission -- what you get when you write Matt Machtan? Or is it
more complex than that? He said: "Yeah, sure, just be sure it says this:",
and it does -- and the acknowledgment of trademark, there is *no reason* to
give copyright of your own pages to FFE.

However, trademark infringement is very touchy, because to be infringing
on the trademark, you usually have to be making money off of someone
else\'s work without their permission.

That\'s why so many people copyright a fan fiction piece (actually,
anything you write is automatically copyrighted), and then state that
the piece is trademarked by whoever owns the trade mark and that it is
used without permission.

Once you acknowledge that something is trademarked, you are not
challenging it.  Once you try to sell something for a trademarked
product, you are in a position to be sued.

I thought that Xerox lost their trademark.  Either that or they came
dangerously close.  But remember, this only comes when you don\'t
acknowledge the true owner of the trademark.  An example that has taken
place in our lifetime is "Do They Know It\'s Christmas" by Band Aid.
Johnson and Johnson regretted having to take (Virgin?) records to court
and forcing the record to be pulled from the market because the song was
released for a humanitarian effort.  J+J unfortunately had no choice
because they had to defend their trademark (nowhere on the album was is
stated that Band-Aid is a trademark of J+J).

If you write something and share it with your friends, then it\'s
copyrighted by you.  As long as you acknowlegde that it\'s trademarked by
FFE, then it\'s all cool because you\'re not selling another person\'s
trademark.

If you publish it and sell it, then you\'re in trouble because you
haven\'t purchased any publication rights, and thus you are ifringing on
FFE\'s livelihood.

Yes, there *is* a difference.

Admitting that your work is based upon someone\'s trademark doesn\'t
constitute in your work automatically being the property of the
trademark holder.  It\'s still your work, and the trademark holder has to
decide under what terms they want to purchase it from you (when you pay
a licensing fee, you are selling your work to them).

No, not a racist.  I just believe in the inherent superiority of Humanity
(and that\'s with a "y" not an "i.")  <grin>  Have you ever played Cthulhu?
Our group has a saying: "Humanity.  A greater independent race -- and we\'re
here to keep it that way."

Speaking of which -- has anyone else ever imported Cthulhu mythos into their
Traveller games?  The Mi-go have come a long way in the last few thousand

Dear Carlos,
 
The Geonee  were presented in detail  in DGP\'s Travellers\' Digest
(magazine)  #17.  They  were  the  special  focus  of  the issue,
introduced  as  the  main  non-player  characters  in the feature
adventure  "Missing in  Transit" in  the Digest\'s  epic series of
adventures: "The  Grand Tour". There are  plenty of illustrations
showing their size and their garb, including the cover painting.
 
Shiwonee, the Geonee Homeworld is  also presented, in DGP\'s Grand
Survey  (World Builders\'  Handbook) format.  A tech-level  G (16)
world,  Shiwonee is  an interesting  place to  visit, though  not
nearly as interesting as the arrogant and essentric Geonee (among
other things, they keep their women under lock and key, including
their posessions  - even crewmembers  who belong to  them!). They
claim to be a "Major Race", not by virtue of discovering the jump
drive  (they  didn\'t),  but  by  virtue  of  being  the  Ancients
themselves!  This claim is ignored by the official  six (that is,
five *)  Major Races, but the  Geonee actually do have  a special
relationship  with the  Ancients -  chirpers are  integrated into
their society and  have a very central role  in their culture. Of
course,  the  Geonee  are  first  to  brag  about  their superior
technology, and they act as superior beings at every opportunity,
despite their  diminutive stature (they  aren\'t much taller  than
chirpers!).
 
The  feature adventure  comes  complete  with a  diabolical plot,
Ancient Artifacts, and even a love interest.  :)
 
As with  most Travellers\' Digests, the  astrography of the region
is  also  presented,  complete  with  library  data.  Of  course,
as in  all TDs, character  descriptions of the  PCs of the  Grand
Tour series (Akidda Laagiir,  Dur Telemon, Dr. Theodor Krenstein,
and the AI robot AB 101) are included.
 
 
 
Travellers\' Digest 11 also presents  a system survey of the world
Far  Trinity in  the  Massilia  sector, "Project  Blackheart" (an
ultra secret  EYES ONLY naval  adventure set in  the aftermath of
the Fifth Frontier War  against an imposing Zhodani technological
threat),  an  entry  in  the  regular  feature  "Medical  Digest"
covering  TL  9  to  TL  12  human  medicine, detailed "Traveller
Arsenal" descriptions and illustrations of the PGMP-12, the Gauss
Pistol,  and  the  Gauss  Rifle,  a  "Tech  Brief" on information
processing,  Traveller  Q\'s  &  A\'s,  and  a  couple  informative
articles  for  use  with  GDW\'s  2300  game  ("An Overview of the
American Arm" and "Exploration: American Style").
 
 
 
* Special  Note:  In Travellers\' Digest  #17, in  the Grand  Tour
Feature Adventure "The Blade of Koiyehk", it is revealed that the
Aslan are  not a Major Race!  Not only did they  not discover the
jump-drive  for  themselves,  but  they  learned  about  it  from
humans!) Their honor would certainly be threatened if this secret
were  to become  public  knowledge.  Will our  hearty adventurers
escape with the secret and their lives? (Cliffhanger ending...).
 
:)
 
I hope I\'ve been of help.

variablity could also be variations in the n-dimensional density along any given
path, perhaps indirectly related to 3-D masses on the surface. 

The real skill of the astrogator would be in having a feeling or some knowledge
of the precise adjustments for a given jump. The old seagoing navigators on
earth (especially the Polynesians) used a combination of science (ie, the stars)
and a feeling for the winds, clouds, and waves based on experience and tradition
or logs.

Some explaination of misjumps is also needed. I like the suggestions that a ship
will "bubble" out of jumpspace sooner or later if there are problems with the
jump drive. Maybe every jump has a little misjump associated with it.

I feel the term "jump drive" is a misnomer. Once a jump is initiated, nothing
can be done to stop it, lengthen it, or change its direction. In jump space,
there is nothing for a traditional-type drive to push against. After it starts,
the crew is just along for the ride trusting to the skill of the astrogator.

Not only does it mean that. It seems, at least by interpretation, to mean
that if IG decides at some later date that they no longer want your
starship designs on the web, they can effectively shut you down. By
agreeing to this policy now, you would be sacrificing all rights to your
own designs.

Unless there is some form of miscommunication going on, which I *really*
hope is the case, it sounds to me like somebody at Imperium Games just
pulled a T$R. IMHO, this totally changes the relationship IG had with the
TML and with the fanzines and Traveller-enthusiasts everywhere. Joe, can
we get some sort of explanation for this? Is there perhaps some sort of
error?

Just to stick my neck onto the chopping block, here\'s the sort of
disclaimer that I could understand:

  "Traveller is a registered trademark of FarFuture Enterprises (FFE).
  Use of this trademark or of any material copyrighted by FFE is not
  to be interpreted as a claim on such material. This work is to be
  considered "unofficial" and FFE cannot be held liable for damages,
  material or otherwise, resulting from its use. This work is
  copyright 1996 (author\'s name). All rights reserved, except that
  FFE may draw on this work in any fashion they deem appropriate."

This reason I include the last sentence is just for IG\'s own protection,
as it is possible that by pure coincidence, IG might publish something
fairly similar to something a fan writes, and this line would protect
them from the fan suing (not that I could envision this ever happening,
but it pays to cover your aft-quarters every now and then). Of course,
the fan would have to rely on IG\'s sense of "rightness" to not publish
their work wholesale without compensation, but I don\'t see this as a
problem. Some people (like myself) might not even want compensation,
and might amend the last sentence to read: "All rights reserved, except
that FFE is invited to draw on this work or even republish it without
requesting permission."

In writing all this, of course, I\'m operating on the possibly-erroneous
assumption that Marc Miller isn\'t fixated on pulling a T$R. If he is, and
this advice is unwelcome, then Marc/Joe/somebody... please let us know so
that we can each make the personal decision about whether or not we, as
individual Traveller-fans, are willing to put up with this sort of
treatment. For myself, I have certain obligations to people who have
contributed material to the next version of "Galactic", but after that,
I can\'t really see myself staying involved with Traveller unless this new
policy of IG\'s is substantially amended.

   OK, I get it now.  It was just the terminology that was getting in my

As I am quite new to Traveller, my question may be an "overdone" one.
I think I missed the earlier postings partially.

Is travelling time in jump-space really ALWAYS 1 week?
This would mean, that every point in normal space is in the same distance 
from any point in jump-space. Sounds strange ...
But of course, time and space are not always the same, are they?

Actually, in the formation of obsidian, there are not _really_ specific
conditions. Obsidian is volcanic glass, an amorphous substance that has
formed due to rapid cooling. It is most commonly associated with regions of
acidic volcanism (Mt. St Helens and the volcanoes of the US\'s Cascades
range), but can be found in areas of more basic volcanism (such as at
Hawaii and Iceland).

The Lava dose not need to be _exteremly thin_, but this does help in the
rapid cooling of the lava.


Thanks in advance,


PS: I know this has little to do with the TRAVELLER game, but gives me my
first chance to use 3.5 years of Geological schooling! I\'ve read posts in
the past were the physics of rapid decompression and Jump theories were
thrashed to a quantified pulp, so I thought I\'d drop in and help clarify
the Geology for anyone who may actually notice the anomaly.

I would try Holst\'s _The Planets_ (Mar\'s the Bringer of War is good), the
soundtrack to _2001_ is another possability. Vangellis can be a bit soft at
times and not moody enough (to envoke atmosphere that is)

Yeah, the _Blade Runner_ soundtrack is the best. The only other Vangelis
album I\'ve liked is _Opera Sauvage_, there\'s good stuff on that (one piece
of which was used by Peter Weir in _The Year of Living Dangerously_. And
that\'s a pretty nice soundtrack too, mostly Maurice Jarre, with some Indo
gamelan.)

Soundtrack music is the way to go. For mood music and especially for
futurismo global-cultural flavour (as opposed to the obvious sci-fi movie
stuff), I\'d suggest:

_Passion_, Peter Gabriel\'s excellent soundtrack to _The Last Temptation_.

_Musst Musst_ and other disks by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Pakistan\'s top
Qawwali singer, and among the most incredible voices in the world.

_The Akira Symphonic Suite_ - one of the best movie soundtracks I\'ve ever
heard. Utterly unlike anything else.

_My Life in the Bush of Ghosts_ by David Byrne and Brian Eno. Deeply
strange music unlike anything done by anybody since 1982. One or two tracks
showed up in the movie _Wall Street_.

_Birdy_, the soundtrack by Peter Gabriel, mostly instrumental reworkings of
themes and rhythms from _Security_ and his previous eponymous records.

That\'s all I can think of at the moment. Hope this helps.

    'body' => 'PART ONE:  KEN\'S TASK FIX PROTOTYPE

OK, everyone, here it is! 

I\'ve been pretty quiet for some days now because I have been using most of my free time 
(except for Sunday when we had one hell of a paint ball game) working on this task 
problem with T4.  I think that I have come up with a system that most of us will like.

I\'m ready to throw it out there on the TML, have all of you tear it to shreds, and then 
pick up the pieces and head back to the laboratory to perfect it.  If anyone can find 
the bugs in something, it is all of you.

Back on Wed, Oct. 9th, I posted some goals for this project.  I am excited to say that I 
think that I accomplished most of them.

To reiterate, the ten goals were:



1.  Design a new system that involved minimal steps to fix the T4 system (minimal math, 
use D6 dice, designed to resemble the T4 system, etc).

	Accomplished this goal.



2.  Goal 2 was to either alter the target number or alter the difficulty system, but not 
both.  The idea here was to keep the changes to the T4 system to a minimum in accordance 
with goal 1.  

	Well, I\'ll have to give myself only a 50% success rate on this goal.  I ended up 
altering the difficulty system, but I also changed how the target number is arrived at.
	For those who just want a quick (super quick) fix to the T4 system, they can 
continue to calculate target numbers as detailed in the T4 main book (i.e. Add attribute 
to skill level for target number).  This new difficulty system will work fine with these 
target numbers AND impossible tasks are much harder to hit (rolling the impossible is 
what started this project).
	See the notes in goal 4 for why I changed the target number calculation as well.

	For all of you who hate the D3s, sorry.  They are a necessary evil when dealing 
with the curves produced by multiple D6 dice, but I have made an effort to keep them to 
a minimum.  Only Easy and Difficult difficulty levels are affected by the D3s--and Easy 
is usually automatic anyway.  50% of goal accomplished.



3.  Focus on changing the target number instead of the difficulty system.

	I\'d say I accomplished this too (which is done in the new target number 
calculation), but I found, upon further investigation of the problem, that I had to 
focus somewhat on the difficulty system as well.  Goal accomplished.



4.  Decrease the importance of abilities but still make them a major modifier to a 
character\'s skill level.  Test the "I\'ve got Dex 10 and Pilot-1, and you\'ve only got Dex 
4 and Pilot-6, so I should pilot the ship" syndrome.  The pilot-6 character should have 
a better chance of success.

	The new target number calculation accomplishes this goal.



5.  Skill level should be the biggest component of the target number i.e. it should be 
weighter more than other components of the target number.

	The new target number calculation accomplishes this goal.


6.  Figure a way to include apptitude in the target number.  Dexterity is used for many 
skills, and it is not realistic that the attribute will effect all skills in the same 
way.  For instance, Dex covers picking a lock (intrusion), flying a ship (piloting), 
firing a weapon (gun combat), or lobbing a grenade (throwing).  Apptitude will weight 
Dexterity differently with respect to each of the applications.

	The new target number calculation accomplishes this goal.



7.  The task system should be better than the one used in MT (which is already a good 
system).  "Better" is qualified as meaning:

	Easier to use than MT (the new target number calculation is as simple as 	
T4--just precalculate target numbers for each skill a character has and record 	these on 
the character\'s sheet.  A player need only to referr to his sheet to 	see his target 
number and then roll dice.  This cuts out adding the modifiers 		from skill and 
ability in the MT system.)  Goal accomplished.  

	Provide better probabilities.  (The new task system does provide them.)  Goal 	
accomplished.

	Make characteristics more important to the throw--add more than just a +1, +2, 	
	or +3 to the throw.  (The new task system does this.)  Goal accomplished.



8.  An eye is kept on the harder difficulty levels--especially the impossible throws--to 
ensure that the probabilities do not become unrealistic.

	The new task system does this.  If you use the T4 method for target number 
calculation, you will have more "heroic" characters able to make task rolls more easily. 
 If you use the new target number calculation, you will have more realistic characters 
and task probabilities.  Goal accomplished.



9.  Check all work against the sample character provided in the original post on goals.

	Mr. Harrisani stacks up well with the new system.  Some of you may remember that 
I was irritated with the T4 system because this character could make an impossible throw 
44% of the time with only a computer-4 skill and Int of 9.  In the new system, this same 
character can make the impossible throw only 6% of the time, and his target number is 
reduced from 13 to 11.  I\'d say goal accomplished.



10.  The low end of the scale should be watched to make sure that it is not too 
unrealistic (read low and unplayable) for a character\'s many level-1 skills.

	Again, goal accomplished.



So, after reading all of this, I bet you are eager to see this new system.  Well, I\'m 
going to have to keep you in suspense for another day or so since it is almost 4:00 AM. 
 I\'ll try to post part two of this tomorrow--with the system--so that all of you can 
take a look and tell me what you think.

Good night all, 

Kenneth.

I agree Scouts are often rebels, but they are also survival-oriented rebels.

This thread should probably not go on for too long but:
Pink Floyd Ummagumma (esp "Set the control for the heart of the sun" and
"Astronomy Domine")
Empire Strikes back soundtrack (I use Imperial march as the official
Imperial hymn)
else is up to the mood of the campaign.
I also play a lot of Hawkwind from 70s as my players include Vargr and are
slightly counterculture (ie drugs, tatoos, traficking in artifacts etc)

Well, that would certainly explain how Grandfather knew which races would
become major races (ie the ones who he put on the coyns). 

He just planted jump drive relics in each race\'s solar system and waited.
If we follow this further, then one of his agents must have exposed the
use of this same ploy by the Geonee. 

Of course, if the Aslan actually got jump drive from a crippled Solomani
ship this argument falls apart, unless we assume that Grandfather made the
Solomani ship misjump (possibly because the Aslan looked like they might
destroy themselves before they found the relic he planted. 

Great, we\'re working out a Traveller version of Foucoult\'s Pendulum...

The IISS in my gaming world are rebels, criminals, the truly dedicated and
other eccentrics.  However, they take quite a bit of pride in their service
and wear a jet black uniform when attending official duties or any other
time it suites their needs.  As for a dress uniform, I\'m sure they drag out
their Sunday best when they have to interact with other services or are
attending state occasions.  Speaking of which, does anyone else miss the
decoration system in "Mercenary" and "High Guard?"  I always loved getting
"The Star Burst for Extreme Heroism."

Okay.  Let\'s not argue about it.  I\'m just relaying what Ken Whitman said 
to me.  I asked him what the official policy was regarding new rules, 
equipment, deck plans, etc. for Traveller which were posted to UseNET, 
TML, and/or a web site.  And he told me exactly what is in the FAQ.

However, if you believe otherwise, there\'s no use arguing about it.

Jim,

I was asked to clarify IG\'s official copyright policy, so I put that in 
my notes and asked Ken that question, along with many others, yesterday.  
Here is the fragment of our conversation that relates to this issue:


Joe: "What is IG\'s copyright policy vis a vis TML/Web/UseNET-published 
materials for traveller, regarding: 1) original works, and 2) copyrighted 
works."

Ken:  "What do you mean by original works?"

Joe:  "Stuff that people make up on their own, like new equipment, new 
rules, etc."

Ken:  "Well, as long as they put \'Traveller is a registered trademark of 
FarFuture Enterprises.  Copyright (c) 1996\' in there, there\'s no problem."

Joe:  "So that means that, technically, all such works are the property 
of FFE...?"

Ken:  "Yeah.  We\'ve been lax in our enforcement of this requirement, but 
we really have to be more careful.  FFE could lose its Trademark.  But, 
we don\'t want to anger the fans."

Joe:  "It\'s a thorny issue.  So, what about copied works - copies of GDW 
or IG published works, such as deck plans, and...."

Ken:  "They\'ll have to get a Letter of Permission from FarFuture 
Enterprises.  Marc owns the copyrights on all that stuff."

...

That\'s it.  That\'s where I got my information.  Maybe Ken didn\'t 
understand what I meant, but his answer seemed to indicate what I said.

Now, though, you can decide for yourself. :)

Right.  That does not, however, mean that FFE has the right to publish any
work they have licensed without the author\'s consent.  It means that they
can keep people from publishing stuff, but it does *not* mean that they
themselves have the right to publish that same stuff.  For that, they\'ll
need a specific agreement with the author (probably as part of the
licensing agreement, but it will need to be explicit in any case).

Ask yourself:  "Why doesn\'t FFE have the right to republish DGP material?"

Answer:  because that material is the property of DGP.  DGP can\'t publish
it without FFE\'s consent, as it references FFE *trademarks*.  FFE,
however, can\'t publish it without DGP\'s consent, as DGP holds *copyright*
on the text.

[Legal digression:  Author A writes and publishes a book.  B likes the
 book -- so much that he writes another book, using the same characters,
 some of the plot elements, and large direct quotes.  A goes to court, and
 B is busted for violating A\'s copyright.  A then says "Why work?  I\'ll
 just steal B\'s book; after all, he ripped me off."  B can then sue A for
 copyright infringement, and may well win, provided A used parts of B\'s
 book which were original to B.]

 differ.  But it won\'t have changed since the Ziru Sirka.)

So, again, I wasn\'t flying solo on those two Q\'s in the FAQ.  That\'s 
straight from Ken to you.

But, my personal opinion is that there\'s nothing to get excited about.  I 
personally don\'t see IG publishing people\'s stuff without their 
permission, or stepping in and shutting people\'s web sites down.  That 
would be extremely bad P.R., and would almost certainly not be worth it.  

IG is here to make games, and that\'s what they\'re focused on, now more than 
ever.  And, heck, at least one of you has posted a message from Marc 
Miller granting permission to post certain copyrighted GDW materials on the 
Web.  I don\'t see them being tight about this.

Perhaps I shouldn\'t have asked that follow-up question about the work 
being technically FFE\'s property.  It\'s just that that was what Ken\'s 
inclusion of the copyright statement seemed to imply, and I wanted to 
clarify it.

Unfortunately if we assume the 60m 200\' model interior details are right, 
the cockpit is 16\' across, at 27m the cockpit is only 8 feet across...  
That\'s a really tight squeeze...  With my measurements the secret 
compartments in the floor are 2x1m or 6\'x3\', with a 27m ship those 
compartments become roughly 1x0.5m or 3\'x1.5\'.  I\'m starting to get the 
feeling that the M. Falcon is rather like Dr. Who\'s Tardas...  Bigger on 
the inside than it is on the outside.  The thing we have to remember with 
my 200\' or 60m measurement is that roughly 16m or 50\' is wasted space, 
the front forks, and the aft 2.5 meters or 8\' is that flap that hangs 
over the top and bottom of the engines.

Hummmmm....  There\'s definitely something weird here...

For the blueprints I\'m using, the only blue print\'s that I\'ve found that 
make sence of all the interior details found in the movies, see the 
"StarWars, Technical Journal of the Planet Tatooine, Vol 1."  I beleive 
that this has been republished in a hard cover format covering all 3 of 
the original magazines...

Precisely!  If FFE has licensed it, then it\'s a completely different 
matter.  As I said above, it\'s either MM\'s property OR it is licensed.  
There is no in-between.

Absolutely right again.

Perfect again.

Nor am I an attorney, so the same disclaimer applies to me. :)  I\'m just 
going by what I learned in the various business law classes I took... 
years ago, and what Ken said to me yesterday.

Q.  What is IG\'s copyright policy in regards to original works posted to 
the Traveller Mailing List, WWW sites, and/or Usenet?

A.  Just include "Traveller is a Registered Trademark of FarFuture 
Enterprises.  Copyright (c) 1996" in the document, and IG will be fine 
with it.  Be aware that this makes your work the property of FFE, 
though.  ALTERNATIVELY, IF YOU HAVE A LETTER OF PERMISSION FROM FFE, THE 
WORK WILL REMAIN YOUR OWN (ALTHOUGH YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO NOTE THE 
TRADEMARK).

 Hmm... Well, even if there were ancient sites in the solar system I still
 believe that we developed the jump drive independently.  Perhaps, finding
 those ancient sites led to the research making jump drives available but in
 my game the Solomani are still a major race.10 >>

The purpose of my post wasn\'t to denigrate the Solomani. Nor was it even
to
state that the Solomani did not invent j-drive. It was merely
to sow some seeds of doubt into the official history.

Traveller has a distinguished history of establishing stereotypes and
then demolishing them. To give a few examples:

1) The Zhodani Consulate is an evil, totalitarian state. Or not.

2) The Droyne are a peculiar, backwards race. Or they are the legendary
Ancients.

3) The Imperium is a monolithic structure maintained by the fealty of
its nobles. Or it\'s a frayed and shattered government fractured by
infighting.

4) The Aslan independently invented jump drive. Or they copied the
technology from Solomani traders.

In all of the above cases, there were clues in the form of oblique
references and data which were inconsistant which forshadowed these
earth-shattering revelations. This tradition has inspired me to wonder
about any oblique references and inconsistant data which I find buried
in the canon, and generate theories which may explain them. Since these
theories need to be tested, they make for great adventure seeds.

Whichever case turns out to be true, the /doubt/ forms a motive for
/research/, which can drive a very interesting adventure.

BTW, to the above list, some might add:

5) The labels "Major Race" and "Minor Race" are an objective way of
distinguishing the relative importance of a given species\' contribution
to interstellar society. Or they are an arbitrary distinction designed
to justify oppression of the weak by the strong. Or they have some other
origin.

Point five has always interested me, by the way. The Vilani seem to have
invented the terms back when they were the only known major race. This
tool of oppression may have turned out to be a two edged sword when the
Terrans and Vargr appeared on the scene.

But then again the term "Six Races" appears independently in the
folklore of several different starfaring races, all of whom ostensibly
obtained starflight independently of one another. There\'s something
going on here...

Whatever the truth is, it\'s probably not what you\'d expect.

Fact is stranger than fiction, but Traveller has always done what it
could to narrow that gap. 8^)

Might I suggest Team Metlay\'s e-music CD\'s. Mike Metlay is a long time
Traveller player and contributer to JTAS and MT. His record company is
Atomic City (http://www.pd.net/atomic-city/). I haven\'t seen him in a

All the books will be in the mail by the end of this week.

It is not (nor will it be) my intention that I (Marc Miller. Far Future) or
Imperium Games be able to steal your work. The purpose of the
acknowledgements is to protect the Traveller trademarks and copyrights.

Look at DGP (which is some of the best stuff done for Traveller). Their
copyright notices included acknowledgements of the Traveller trademarks and
copyrights. Some pieces say copyright GDW and DGP. Now in order to use the
material (since their original license has expired) they need permission. AND
I can use their material in the sense that I can refer to their materials
when I (or Imperium writes new stuff). Which makes sense, since otherwise,
their participation in the universe would be totally disallowed (ie. you
asked about the Geonee, they were in TD 11, so what was said there would now
be NOT true).

But no one (at FFE or IG) is going to come along and download your materials
and print it or publish it.
