  Is it reasonable to assume that a Far Trader with excellent
armaments can classify as a standard "independent" pirate? It
is common, can make money legitimately, can J-2, has enough
cargo to loot a hold, swallow a ship\'s boat, or get another
couple parsecs on collapsible tanks.

  It\'s also cheap enough (~85-90 MCr at TL 12, HG) to be the
"ship" type benefit, i.e., privately owned, and requiring a
small enough crew to keep a secret (very important). OTOH,
it can\'t take an SDB under any serious conditions; so what?

  It can unquestionably smuggle and engage in fraud, or even
legitimate business. Now, if it happens to find itself in a
backwater system (very preferably without live passengers)
with no obvious patrols and a potential victim, why might it
not examine the possibilities?

  I assume there will be no SDB\'s, garrison warships, but the
possibility of several patrol ships at any time. If I\'m having
trouble making payments, or believe that I can cash the _ship_
in for even 10% (say 6 MCr, or 6000 Dt cargo haulage!) then I
may try it. I believe that under these circumstances taking the
ship is necessary (they could be hauling anything, but I don\'t
have to worry about 0-G stevedoring that way), as this must be
a rare opening, and repeated attempts will almost inevitably
deal you out of the game.

  This begs the question of whether a transponder transmits
constantly, or replies when pinged.

  Also, what is a reasonable average cost (before fencing) of a
Dt of cargo? I\'m assuming that the pirate can\'t reasonably expect
to have foreknowledge of ships manifests.

  Again, a Far Trader at a jerkwater planet may not need to fence
a cargo at all - rather fake a manifest and sell at whatever you
can get. If it\'s a good price, they may not complain, right?

        Yours truly,
                Steven Hudson

Frankly, I haven\'t thought about that part of the design, but yes you are

    'body' => 'Some Numbers About Piracy, Trade and Imperial Budgets

Summary: The Imperium is BIG, and it\'s WEALTHY.  It\'s requently hard to grasp
just how big and how wealthy, because the numbers are usually astronomical
(and
I hope you\'ll pardon the pun).

To try and inject hard numbers into the current piracy debate, I went into my
archives.  The size of the Imperium and it\'s armed forces, the amount of
interstellar trade, and the possibility (or not) of piracy has appeared the
TML
before.  The whole time I\'ve been a member (and as a resident old-timer on the
list, that means a long time), the thread keeps coming back.

Years ago I analysed the DGP sector data with SAS (a statistical data
analysis 
package).  These sector files were generated by DGP, and represent the
Imperium 
in the first year or so of the Rebellion. TheImperium tallys 10,497 worlds 
(close enough to the expected 11,000 to give the following data has an 
uncertanty of about 5%).  I believe that the sector data files have since
been 
declared non-canonical.  Although they do include almost all published canon 
data, the bulk of the data was computer-generated without human oversight or 
correction.

The Gross Planetary Product (GPP) and Taxation rules from Striker (original
edition) were used to compute the GPP in Local Credits.  The Striker exchange
table was used to convert these to Imperial Standard (Port-A, TL-15) Credits,
which were then taxed at the suggested rates.  Rules from Trillion Credit
Squadron (TCS) were used to compute the shipyard capacity of each Class A
and B
Starports, as well.  The shipyard capacity is primarily determined by the
population of a world.

For those of you that don\'t recognize the term, Striker and Classic Traveller
recognized different values for a Credit, depending on the TL and starport
type
of a world.  These factors were assumed to indicate the strength and
sophistication of the local economy.  The exchange rate between a world\'s
local
Credit and the Imperial Standard Credit reduces the value of the taxes paid to
the Imperium by low-tech, backwater worlds, and increases the relative
importance of the contributions of of high-tech trading centers.

The Third Imperium is a trade protectorate encompassing 10,497 star systems
with
a total population of about 16,731,817,153,000 sophonts.  The annual Gross
Imperial Product (GIP) is 219,474,958,700,000,000 Credits.  This is the total
value of all of the goods and services produced on all the member worlds of
the
Imperium in one year, adjusted to Imperial Standard Credits.  The
per-capita GIP
is 13,117.22 Imperial Standard Credits per sophont, but is concentrated
primarily in the inhabitants of high-tech worlds.  The Imperium imposes a tax
burden of about 1% of the GIP, producing Imperial revenues of about
2,194,749,587,000,000 Imperial Standard Credits per year. Individual worlds
tax
their citizens at various rates, depending on the government type and need.

Also relevant to the piracy debate is the shipbuilding and maintenance capacity
of the world\'s shipyards.  The shipyards of the Imperium\'s Class A starports
have an aggregate capacity (all tech levels) of 5,098,672,838 displacement tons
for vessel construction. Its Class B ports have an additional capacity
4,367,049,593 displacement tons for the repair and annual maintainance of
starships.  The table below shows the tech level breakdown for the Imperium\'s
Class A and B starports.

The TCS rules are aimed at military campaigns, and generally ignore civilian
shipping entirely.  Therefore it is reasonable to assume that this bias also
applies to shipyard and base capacity.  The TCS rules are not clear if this
capacity includes Imperial facilities (such as Navy Depots, Scout Way Stations,
and various yards operating under contract to the Imperium), or includes only
non-Imperial facilities.

By making a few (reasonable, I hope) assumptions, I worked out the total amount
of ships that these facilities can support.  I assumed that the total size of
the forces was constant at about 90% of the capacity of the various facilities,
that the average lifetime of a ship was 80 years (40 years on the front-line,
and 40 years in secondary or local service), and that all ships recieve their
annual maintenance.  The total aggregate tonnage varies with the average size of
ships (because of the construction time of the ship increases with size), as
summarized below.

Picking a force mix rather arbitrarily, I come up with the following numbers
for the ships that compose the available forces.  You can choose your own
force mix, and generate different numbers of vessels.  It\'s worth remembering
that these figures represent the ability of the starports to construct and
maintain these ships.

Category                        %Total Avg Tons    Ships

Battleships and Battletenders    30.0%  500,000      611
Battledriders and Monitors       30.0%  200,000     3953
Cruisers and Fleet Intruders     10.0%   50,000    24615
Fleet Escorts                     3.0%   10,000   221497

Patrol, Enforcement and Convoy    0.1%    1,000   984432
System Defense Boats             10.0%    5,000  3281417

System Defense: There are about 5170 class A or B starports in the Imperium.
SDBs are  nonstarships, which can be built at either type of starport.  Making
the (mostly) reasonable assumption that SDBs will be located in systems
that can
build them locally, this allocates about 634 per system for local defense.
Note that these are 5,000 ton "heavy" SDBs. Actually, a mixture of ships would
be chosen so that the aggregate tonnage is the same as if they were all 5,000
tons.  If they were all 400-ton "light" SDBs, there could be over 200 thousand
SDBs in EACH SYSTEM (the crews alone would exceed the population of most
worlds).

Piracy Supression: The Patrol, Enforcement, and Convoy Escort ships are assumed
to be jump-capable starships in the 1000-ton class.  Actually, these ships would
range from the 300-ton Gazelle-class Close Escorts, through Patrol and Mercenary
Cruisers, up to light destroyers.  Almost all would be jump-capable.  Given that
the bulk of these ships would be deployed at some distance from their bases, it
is reasonable to assume that a total of 4 ships will be required to maintain one
ship on patrol at any given time (one ship on patrol, one in port, and one each
in transit to and from the patrol zone).  Making these assumtions and doing
the math, I come up with 23 ships on patrol simultaneously on patrol in each 
and every system of the Imperium at any given time.

I also computed detailed statistics (by TL and starport class) for the Imperium
as a whole, and for each sector individually.  The following table is for all of
the 10,497 star systems of the Third Imperium, and gives the GPP, local Army and
local Navy budgets, as well as the Imperial tax budget from each combination of
TL and starport type.  This will give you an idea of the funds and
manpower available as well as the facilities.

The Imperial Military Advanced Research Projects Administration (IMARPA),
in partnership with the Imperial Ship Builders Association (ISBA), is
pleased to announce the inception of a new prototype-vessel development
program under the umbrella of the Imperial Navy Year 50 (IN50) task force.
IN50 is a long-term effort to study and prototype designs for the next
generation of Imperial Navy vessels.

Proposals are being solicited for a next-generation aerospace heavy 
fighter, designated Project IN50-F2.  Baseline requirements are:

* Size in the range 20-50 tons inclusive
* Capable of both atmospheric and vacuum combat operations
* Crew of 1 or 2
* Minimal life support and provisions for up to 7 days

The potentially long operational duration of 7 days is meant for emergency
situations only; e.g., a fighter stranded in a hostile system following
destruction/withdrawal of its parent fleet, waiting for rescue or making
its way to a habitable world.  Normal operational duration for the fighter
will not exceed 1 day.

In addition to these requirements, the craft must be an effective and
survivable weapons platform.  Major operational scenarios upon which
vessel evaluation will be based are: 

* Fleet combat support
  - Auxilliary point defense for friendly ships/installations
  - Force projection against isolated small/damaged enemy ships
  - Force projection against atmospheric/ground targets

* Patrol support
  - Close-orbit patrol/scouting
  - Blockade enforcement
  - Commerce escort

To fulfill all these roles, the fighter must be capable of operating from
planetary bases or from stations/vessels.

The wide permitted range of fighter sizes is intentional.  IMARPA is
attempting to find the optimal point between:

* Swarms of smaller fighters, the loss of each of which is less
  significant, but which are so underarmed as to be nearly useless
  offensively, and

* A few larger, well-armed fighters, each with more offensive punch,
  but also very expensive to lose in combat.

Proposals submitted in response to this request should explain how the
design presented addresses this issue.

The selected bidder will be contracted to build 24 units of their design
for performance evaluation; it is expected that this will lead to a full
production order (totalling thousands of units) within 10 years.

David Drake wrote Hammer\'s Slammers and a whole bunch of other stuff.
He brings a somewhat different view of warfare, having been a grunt in Nam.

That\'s the boundary of the field that keeps you "4-dimensional". That\'s
why going past it dumps you into realspace in tiny pieces.

Actually, he started in the mid-to-late *30s*. All of Future History
stories (well the first batch) were written *before* 1950. Not until
Time Enough for Love (1970s?) did he re-visit that series.

He and his wife spent a *week* doing orbital calculations by hand (it
was 1950) on *huge* sheets of butcher paper for the sake of 3 lines in
"Space Cadet".

For a good taste of whate life might be like on a world with a
ridiculously high law level, try David Drake\'s "Lacey and his Friends".
The Lacey stories are in a world where the *only* place cameras don\'t
cover is the keypads people use to enter their access codes. 

It\'s interesting to note that even in a world like that, crime is still
possible. And it\'s even possible to get away with murder. Damn
difficult, but possible.

ps. I thought the diving board was a nice touch.

"Stranger in a Strange Land" predates "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" by
quite a bit. 

Here\'s (roughly) the order of his later books:

Starship Troopers
Stranger in a Strange Land
Glory Road
The Moon is a Harsh Mistress
Time Enough For Love
I Will Fear No Evil (the absolute low point in his writings)
Number of the Beast

The Flandry stories are by Poul Anderson. He\'s also the author of the
Polesotechnic(?) League stories which are set in the same universe as
the Flandry stories, only some centuries earlier. They are even closer
to Traveller. 

Fritz Lieber, jr. (Sr. was a well known Shakespearen actor) is best
know for the Fafhrd & Gray Mouser fantasy stories. His SF isn\'t as well
know, and isn\'t very Traveller like.

They found the manuscript Piper\'s third Fuzzy novel and printed it in
the late 80s. Look for "The Other Human Race".

Roger MacBride Allen has written some good stuff.

Worse, he made the mistake of looking "up". His entire field of view
was hyperspace, and the description of what happened then is a classic.

4 is most likely. It\'s not certain that a fire would start in the first
place. If you did have a fire, it\'d be in "mid air" somewhere between
the air rushing in, and the LH2 vaporizing. 

Remember, LH2 doesn\'t burn. H2 *gas* burns.

("forgettys," "go-captains," Johnny Joy Tree, "battle hypnosis") but it can
give a good ideas.

I\'ve even created two minor human races based on Cordwainer Smith ideas:

The Allamani, a race made up of Solomani cold-sleep settlers who ended up
on a world that whose environment included pathogens that killed all female
humans at the age of puberty. I even used the word "klopt" for their single
gender/sex, which is a blatant crib from "The Crime and the Glory of
Commander Suzdal."

The Kaahiniin, a minor race with jumpspace intolerance (in my
interpretation of the Traveller universe, jump technology is separate from
jumpspace containment technology--it was much easier to send items through
jumpspace than to send people through and keep them sane). They experience
pain at levels that rapidly drive them mad even when protected by the most
sophisticated jumpspace damping fields. Kaahiniin either travel low or
undergo sophisticated neurosurgery to dampen their senses of touch, taste,
hearing and smell; after the surgery, they are able to function in
jumpspace, though their ability to function as "normal" beings is
drastically curtailed.

I didn\'t attempt to integrate these races into the canonical Imperium, but
rather placed them (initially) in the Trojan Reach sector and then, when
Atlas of the Imperium came out, decided to shift my whole campaign to a
version of the mid-Long Night period that has been superseded by events.

Kaahin "scanners" were always effective heavies; I loved doing their loud,
screeching voices and forcing my players to speak so that I could lipread.

Poul Anderson. He\'s written an *incredible* amount of stuff, all good.
Last time I had my collection mostly on shelves (as opposed to boxes),
he had something like 5 or six *feet* of shelf space. And all of that
was *paperbacks*!

Do give him another chance. Even if you didn\'t like that one, I suspect
you\'d enjoy "Friday", "Job: A Comedy of Justice", and the collections
that were issued after that point. It\'s also a good idea to pick up the
re-issues of "Red Planet", "The Puppet Masters" and "Stranger in a
Strange Land" as all have changes from the older editions.

Steve is a fun guy to be around.

But mentioning him reminds my of a local writer. Steve Perry. His
Matador series and Black Steel series are good reads. And point out

And I think Hengbar would love many of the weapons. He probably

You mean like the various car makers use interchangeable parts? Or how
Microsoft enhances their proifits by making sure that competitors
software works as well with their OSes as Microsoft software does? (1)

(1) For those who aren\'t aware of it, Microsoft has a long history of
sticking routines in their OSes to either prevent third party software
from working with them (Windows 3.1 was *specifically* written so that
it wouldn\'t run under DR-DOS), or reduce performance (Someone recemtly
discovered that Windows 95 checks to see if Netscape is running, and if
it is, it disables a routine that smooths out the "jaggies" in large
fonts).

He was invalided out in *1930*. Long before the War. And he did do a
lot of war-related work during WWII (in the lab).

Actually, the juveniles date from the *middle* of his career. At least
a third of his work was written before 1940. 

Among other things, Heinlein pretty much invented *all* the Time
Travel plots, as well as the Generation ship. And he was the first SF
author to be published in "mainstream" magazines such as The Saturday
Evening Post and Blue Book.

"Triplanetary", "First Lensman", "Galactic Patrol", "Gray Lensman",
"Second-Stage Lensman", "Children of the Lens". There\'s also a novel
set in the Lensman universe, but not part of the main stream of the
stories "The Vortex Blaster".

Smith is know for writing the very *first* truly *interstellar* SF
story. That\'s "The Skylark of Space", first story in the Skylark series
(the others are "Skylark Three", "Skylark of Valeron", and "Skylark
Duquesne"). This series is notable for one of the most "admirable" long
term villians ever: Dr. Marc C. "Blackie" Duquesne.

And "A Nice Day For Screaming, and other Tales of the Hub" ("the Hub"
being the area of the galaxy that the above stories are set in). It\'s
*very* hard to find, but has a number of short stories that are
otherwise hard to find.

Also, "The Witches of Karres" by Schmitz is very good, though set in a
different universe.

Better, try to find "The Complete Venus Equilateral" as it includes a

This is not quite correct. It would be if all ships built in the Imperium
were TL 15. Credits spent on any ship built at TLs lower than 15 would count
for more. You\'d have 1% more TL 14 ships, 11% more TL 13 ships, 17% more
TL 12 ships, etc. than your figures result in.

>The Imperium imposes a tax burden of about 1% of the GIP,

Where did you get that figure? If it is supposed to be the ~30% of military
taxes passed on to the interstellar power by member systems that _Striker_
calls for, then you haven\'t accounted for any of the local planetary navies
in your figures.

>Also relevant to the piracy debate is the shipbuilding and maintenance
>capacity of the world\'s shipyards.

Shipbuilding, yes, but not maintenance. If you are using TCS rules to
establish the size of the shipyards then you should also use TCS rules
for maintenance. And that means that shipyard capacity for maintenance
is hidden (Or that maintenance dosen\'t require shipyard capacity). And
if you think about it, that isn\'t as screwy as it sounds at first.
Shipyard capacity isn\'t just a huge floating spacedock. It is also the
skilled workers to perform the work and the mines and factories and
workshops to produce the hull and engines. But you don\'t need nearly as
many people to give a ship a tuneup that you need to build it, and you
cetainly don\'t need to replace even 2% of the hull and engines every year.

BTW. it may also mean that replacement of worn-out ships (as opposed to
shot-up ships) is hidden (And that would be geniune shipyard capacity).
OTOH it is possble (propable) that the authors of TCS just didn\'t
imagine than anyone would ever need to replace a worn-out ship, most
ships in TCS campaigns being retired the hard way. Still, if we played a
TCS game and spent 100 years without fighting anyone, the fleets would
be as strong as ever, without anyone ever having paid for any replacements.
So by strict TCS rules replacements are included in the 10% maintenance
figure.

>Battleships and Battletenders    30.0%  500,000      611

I don\'t think that Imperial battleships average 500,000 T, though ships
and tenders together might.

>Battledriders and Monitors       30.0%  200,000     3953

Battleriders won\'t average 200,000 T. The largest possible tender of
1,000,000 would only be able to carry 3 of them. Battleriders would
max 100,000 and (IMO) average 50,000.

Monitors may be bigger, but the Imperial Navy wouldn\'t build many, if any.

>Cruisers and Fleet Intruders     10.0%   50,000    24615

According to _Rebellion_ the above three categories together should amount
to about 40,000 (Well, 20,000 for the regular fleets and an equal amount of
money spent of the colonial forces; the force mix may be different for the
colonial forces). Always provided you\'re not including planetary navies in
your tax figure.

Also, if the force mix in _Fifth Frontier War_ is representative of the
whole Imperial navy, the proportion of battleship to cruiser squadrons
is more like 1:1. If battleships are traditionally arranged in 8 ship
squadrons and cruisers in 4-8 ship squadrons. the proportion of battleships
to cruisers would be about 4:3.

OH, and battleship squadrons to scout squadrons would be 4:1, but I have
no notion of how many scouts you need to group to make a FFW squadron.

>System Defense Boats             10.0%    5,000  3281417

If the 1% dosen\'t include the planetary navy, then IMO there should be no
SDBs included in these figures. I don\'t see the Imperial navy building any
SDBs for themselves.

I think you must be making a mistake here. A 400 T SDB takes the naval taxes
of 240,000 people to maintain (If they earn your average  of Cr13,000/year)
and has a crew of 12. I think you should be able to man all you can build.

I think you are being overly cautious here. Very few ships would be
stationed more than 2 jumps from their base (it\'s hard to find any place
in the Imperium that is more than 6 parsecs from a suitable world). 
Assuming that 3 month tours of duty are standard and double crews are
used, a ship would spend about 36 days of every 90 in transit (four jumps
of average duration 9 days). Even with another 9 days spent in port (on the
average -- every fourth tour would require a 14 day maintenance, but the
three others would not take nearly as long) you\'d get 50% use out of the
ship. And for those systems only one jump from the base it would be even
more. (For those rare ones more than 6 parsecs away you\'d use high-jump
ships).

A fleet tender may even enable you to keep the ships out a far higher
percentage of the time.

>BuildTons -- Starship Construction (Port "A") Capacity, in Displacement Tons.
>MaintTons -- Starship Overhaul (Port "B") Capability, in Displacement Tons.

None of this goes to maintenance if we use TCS rules, but it can all be
used to build SDBs. You don\'t need to use Port "A" capacity for that at
all.

I actually ran this as a Traveller mini-adventure. My characters were
assigned to discover what happened to a patron\'s father, who jumped
into an empty hex. The patron, with the PCs, jumped into the same
hex, where they encountered the antimatter planet. 

They sent a probe (read: pushed something out the airlock) down
to it and watch it vaporize. They were really puzzled by the radiation
and by the smooth surface. They ALMOST landed on it when one of them
figured it out (he\'s a Niven fan).

I was in a truly evil mood when I came up with that one!

I\'m the same way. In most of the bookstores I visit, there seems to
be more Star Wars and Star Trek novels than original ones. It makes
me think we\'re in a Long Night for sci-fi -- building on others\' 
work, minimal creativity, worshipping the past.

The Lensman series consisted of six books: TRIPLANETARY, FIRST
LENSMAN, GALACTIC PATROL, GRAY LENSMAN, SECOND-STAGE LENSMAN, and
CHILDREN OF THE LENS.  In addition, he wrote another book set in
the same universe, MASTERS OF THE VORTEX, and David Kyle was
given permission to write three other novels in the same
universe, THE DRAGON LENSMAN, LENSMAN FROM RIGEL, and Z-LENSMAN.

On a different note, Heinlein wrote another novel that I enjoyed,
although it is less "hard SF" than I normally like - British and
recent US printings call it "Sixth Column"; older US printings
call it "The Day After Tomorrow".

Yet a different kind of story that he wrote that I also enjoyed
was "Farnham\'s Freehold".  Rather than spoil either for you, I
will simply tell you to go find them.

<< Any thoughts/recommendations?

I\'d like to recommend David Weber...he is the author of several different
books, here are the ones I know of:

Oath of Swords (Fantasy)
Path of the Fury (Sci-Fi)
The Dahak series (Sci-fi)
     Mutineers Moon
     The Armageddon Inheritance
     Heirs of Empire

Insurrection (Sci-fi, set in the STARFIRE universe)
Crusade (Sci-fi, also set in the STARFIRE universe)

And best of all, the Honor Harrington series (All Sci-fi, mix of SF and
historical fiction)

On Basilisk Station
The Honor of the Queen
The Short Victorious War
Field of Dishonor
Flag in Exile
Honor among Enemies
In Enemy Hands

In my opinion, the Honor Harrington series are his best works...his
inspiration seems to be drawn from history (The Napoleonics Wars) and from
the C.S. Forester character Horatio Hornblower.  They are great books for
ideas about how to play both noble characters and Naval characters as well.
 The universe dosen\'t *exactly* fit well with the Traveller universe (mainly
due to differences in FTL/STL movement, and weapons systems & defenses) but
many ideas can be readily adapted to a Trav campaign.

Correct me if I\'m wrong, but wasn\'t Fallen Angels written to be an inside
joke for the "Fandom" community? If that\'s true, then there\'s probably a
lot folks didn\'t "get" unless they were insiders.

Two points that make life different.  Ships are a _lot_ more expensive than
cars, to the tune of four or five orders of magnitude.

While the total size of the task is roughly the same as keeping track of
all the cars in the country, the thing tracked are valuable enough to
justify some effort.  Perhaps the Imperium would not do it, but some
organization would - they are just too valuable not to.

Consider, even a measaly free trader, at some 20 MCr, IIRC, could justify
the full lifetime services of an investigator to go find it and return it,
if it saved a 10% insurance payment, and a 50% replacement on a 3000t ship
could jsutify an entire mercentary company being formed.  Now clearly,
there will not be one person assigned to each lost ship, but I coud see a
few thousand people assigned to a few thousand lost ships, if the problem
were that large.

It all comes down to one simple rule - if insurance is involved, or if the
society has any grasp of probability, they will spend somewhere up to the
expected cost of loss to prevent the loss.

Were ships three orders of magnitude cheaper, then it would be more  like
present day autos - a loss will take sveral hours of an adjuster\'s time,
but a decent scam can fool them for quite some time, as it is not worth two
weeks of an investigators time.

Locally owned hot grav cars no, but those abandoned cars might get more
attention if they were each worth a hundred million dollars, and if some
insurer somewhere was paying for them, or if they had some similar write
off value.

Present day cars are not worth a day of a foot patrolelr\'s time, in
general.  Even a junked starship is likely worth a bit of effort.

The ship would probably need to be modified (perhaps adding some armour to
it). Is it at all possible to modify an existing ship without having to
dismantle the whole ship? If it is not possible, the ship would have to be
customized. It would be a good point to make the ship look like a normal
free trader on the outside, since this would attract less suspicious eyes
from the government.

If every transpoder transmitted it\'s signal constantly, the ether would be
filled with various signals. It would only be possible to have it send it\'s
message when pinged. Can any ship ping another ship, or is it only
government ships that have access to this (at least legally) ?

1984 by George Orwell springs to mind ... although it is very old (1984 has,
after all, already happened). The book is a classic, and if you haven\'t read
it yet, take the time to do it.

The society within that book is _extremely_ controlled. It is really a
horror-vision of bureaucracy at it\'s worst.

You *could*, if you really tried, but you would lose a great deal fo the

The problem is that so  many of tha advantages/diads are very vaguely

level two Ally costs 4 SP, a level 5 costs 25 SP).  The smae goes for skills.

In the full rules, there\'s a tiny little table that handles that for you

But the real world _does drive lots of people insane :-)

Seriously, I do not think that a person could logically go insane just by
looking at something. I visualize jumpspace as a _black_ ... something.

Of course, looking at something when there is nothing to look at can drive
you insane, or at least cause you to hallucinate. Try entering a really dark
cellar or something and stare out in the darkness, without really seeing
anything. After a while, there seems to be movement in the darkness, and you
can faintly visualize objects ...

Who says there really is nothing out there ?

It would be really hard to convince yourself that there is pure nothing
around you while in the middle of it.

And, off course, there are the numerous tales of dissappearing ships, and
strange sensor disturbances...

FA is a big joke for the fans.. every character in there is based on a real
fan.  EX: "Jenny Trout" = superfilker Leslie Fish, 3MJ = Forrie Ackerman.
You might have noticed a small black yoga master in the van also... a
pre-fame Steve Barnes...

Kirsten and I both show up dead in "House of Secrets", a novel for
Jyhad/Vampire.  We appear as photos of two vampires who have been
completely destroyed.  Kevin just skewers us.  The characters discussing us
can\'t decide if we were "Toreadors with a thing for kitsch or Ravnos out to
embarrass the clan."  Once somebody explained the reference to me, I must
admit, it fit!

I thought it would be very cool to do a Striker Bolo design, but I never
had the patience to design the zillion subsystems, and was doing all of
my Striker designs in the days before easy spreadsheets (although I did
try to put High Guard into Lotus 123 when I was a grad student).  I\'m
not much of a gearhead, anyway.

This is not quite correct. It would be if all ships built in the
Imperium
were TL 15. Credits spent on any ship built at TLs lower than 15 would
count
for more. You\'d have 1% more TL 14 ships, 11% more TL 13 ships, 17% more
TL 12 ships, etc. than your figures result in.

>The Imperium imposes a tax burden of about 1% of the GIP,

Where did you get that figure? If it is supposed to be the ~30% of
military
taxes passed on to the interstellar power by member systems that
_Striker_
calls for, then you haven\'t accounted for any of the local planetary
navies
in your figures.

>Also relevant to the piracy debate is the shipbuilding and maintenance
>capacity of the world\'s shipyards.

Shipbuilding, yes, but not maintenance. If you are using TCS rules to
establish the size of the shipyards then you should also use TCS rules
for maintenance. And that means that shipyard capacity for maintenance
is hidden (Or that maintenance dosen\'t require shipyard capacity). And
if you think about it, that isn\'t as screwy as it sounds at first.
Shipyard capacity isn\'t just a huge floating spacedock. It is also the
skilled workers to perform the work and the mines and factories and
workshops to produce the hull and engines. But you don\'t need nearly as
many people to give a ship a tuneup that you need to build it, and you
cetainly don\'t need to replace even 2% of the hull and engines every
year.

BTW. it may also mean that replacement of worn-out ships (as opposed to
shot-up ships) is hidden (And that would be geniune shipyard capacity).
OTOH it is possble (propable) that the authors of TCS just didn\'t
imagine than anyone would ever need to replace a worn-out ship, most
ships in TCS campaigns being retired the hard way. Still, if we played a
TCS game and spent 100 years without fighting anyone, the fleets would
be as strong as ever, without anyone ever having paid for any
replacements.
So by strict TCS rules replacements are included in the 10% maintenance
figure.

>Battleships and Battletenders    30.0%  500,000      611

I don\'t think that Imperial battleships average 500,000 T, though ships
and tenders together might.

>Battledriders and Monitors       30.0%  200,000     3953

Battleriders won\'t average 200,000 T. The largest possible tender of
1,000,000 would only be able to carry 3 of them. Battleriders would
max 100,000 and (IMO) average 50,000.

Monitors may be bigger, but the Imperial Navy wouldn\'t build many, if
any.

>Cruisers and Fleet Intruders     10.0%   50,000    24615

According to _Rebellion_ the above three categories together should
amount
to about 40,000 (Well, 20,000 for the regular fleets and an equal amount
of
money spent of the colonial forces; the force mix may be different for
the
colonial forces). Always provided you\'re not including planetary navies
in
your tax figure.

Also, if the force mix in _Fifth Frontier War_ is representative of the
whole Imperial navy, the proportion of battleship to cruiser squadrons
is more like 1:1. If battleships are traditionally arranged in 8 ship
squadrons and cruisers in 4-8 ship squadrons. the proportion of
battleships
to cruisers would be about 4:3.

OH, and battleship squadrons to scout squadrons would be 4:1, but I have
no notion of how many scouts you need to group to make a FFW squadron.

>Fleet Escorts                     3.0%   10,000   221497

>System Defense Boats             10.0%    5,000  3281417

If the 1% dosen\'t include the planetary navy, then IMO there should be
no
SDBs included in these figures. I don\'t see the Imperial navy building
any
SDBs for themselves.

I think you must be making a mistake here. A 400 T SDB takes the naval
taxes
of 240,000 people to maintain (If they earn your average  of
Cr13,000/year)
and has a crew of 12. I think you should be able to man all you can
build.

I think you are being overly cautious here. Very few ships would be
stationed more than 2 jumps from their base (it\'s hard to find any place
in the Imperium that is more than 6 parsecs from a suitable world). 
Assuming that 3 month tours of duty are standard and double crews are
used, a ship would spend about 36 days of every 90 in transit (four
jumps
of average duration 9 days). Even with another 9 days spent in port (on
the
average -- every fourth tour would require a 14 day maintenance, but the
three others would not take nearly as long) you\'d get 50% use out of the
ship. And for those systems only one jump from the base it would be even
more. (For those rare ones more than 6 parsecs away you\'d use high-jump
ships).

A fleet tender may even enable you to keep the ships out a far higher
percentage of the time.

>BuildTons -- Starship Construction (Port "A") Capacity, in Displacement Tons.

None of this goes to maintenance if we use TCS rules, but it can all be
used to build SDBs. You don\'t need to use Port "A" capacity for that at
all.

I do like Honor Harrington. Of course, I also like the Hornblower books.

Has he (or anybody) explained just how his STL/FTL systems are supposed to
work?

I get the impression it\'s all based on gravity control with ?high? gravity
bands running from the Alpha to the Beta nodes along the top and bottom of
the ships. Just how this translates into forward momentum, I don\'t know. 
Anyway ships can accelerate at several hundred g\'s and missles at
?thousands?, I think.

At FTL, I *think* the ship translates into a ?hyperspace? where the Alpha
nodes are unfolded into ?gravity? sails that catch some sort of gravity
currents that flow naturally.  In this hyperspace the effective velocity is
greater than c, but I don\'t know exactly how much.

Then there are the ?junction? points that allow instantanous movement from
place to place. Natural wormholes, maybe?

If we had some details about how his IC/AG and STL/FTL worked we could
pretty easily adapt the rest of it to Traveller. Or, actually, adapt the
rest of Traveller to his universe.

	I dunno.  Apparently SD is not terribly realistic.  If they fix it
so that it achieves the same level of attempting to slavishly simulate
reality (or at least achieve scientific verisimilitude) that the rest of
Trav does, then it might pan out...

They way current transponders work is that they "piggyback" the ID info
on radar pulses. You bounce the right kind of radar off them and they
squirt back a return pulse containing the ID codes. This converts radar
from inverse 4th power to inverse square (since you are using the
transponders "squawk" rather than the echo of your own pulse) and it
avoids the "sea of noise" problem that continuos broadcasts would give.

Note that there\'s a *limited* amount of "space" for data in the
transponder squawk. For aircraft, it returns a *settable* multi-digit
ID (4 digits, as I recall) and some info about altitude (which the ATC
radar can\'t determine as accurately as the plane can)

As I recall certain ID codes are reserved for special purposes. For
example, if you have an emergency, you\'ll be instructed to set your
transponder to 7777. And in Traveller, there\'s probably as setting (say
1111...) that you have set when you pop out of jump so as to let STV
known you are a new arrival, and need to be assigned a code.

I suspect that even in traveller, due to the requirement for
transponder squawks to be *brief*, the info returned will be not all
that much greater. Instead, there\'ll be (as with the more advanced
*current* transponders) an "interrogate" option. That\'d be a radar
pulse with special embedded codes. And the transponder would respond
on a different frequency with a detailed info burst.

Transponder *squawks* are triggerable by *anybody*, as part of the
purpose is to enhance radar returns, and provide info useful for
identifying and avoiding other ships. I figure the info would be a
settable ID (assigned by STC, or picked at random if there\'s no STC in
the system), and vector info (ie what direction the ship is moving and
at what speed in some standard co-ordinate system).

I suspect that the interrogate pulse can be used legally by anybody,
but that either there are different levels of detail, with the higher
levels either encrypted or requiring special codes in the interrogate
pulse. The higher levels would be reserved for official use.

I picked up a book of cartoons about 1984ish stuff that was being

is a *wonderful* example of how high levels of law and bureaucracy can

It\'s a drawing of a Russian type guard that has just stopped a car and
is looking at the id folder the driver has handed him. The book title

The Kyle books are *atrocious*. But Smith *himself* gave William
Halpern permission to set stories in the Lensman universe, and while
hard to find, they are better.

Sixth Column is based on a plot idea by John W. Campbell. There was a
collection of Campbell stories published posthumously that has
Campbell\'s version (titled "All").

Campbell wrote a lot of stuff back in the 30s and 40s that helped shape
the course of SF. "Forgetfulness" should be mandatory reading. It\'ll
give you lots of nasty ideas about high tech level "ruins".

I, too, would recommend the Harrington for a good read, however I believe
that the Dahak series is much closer to a Traveller feel, with the exception
of the matter transmitters. Why, (gasp!) it even has a virus that destroys
the Empire (not computer based though!). Heirs to the Empire seems ready

Actually, the \'flaw\' in the random generator was that it implemented
the world generation rules as written, without a human to modify the
values produced by blind application of the rules.  If the statistics 
of the world generation rules are accurate using fair dice, then the 
generated values should correspond in a general way to the \'actual\'
Third Imperium.

Sure.  If you\'ll recall, IISS protocol specifies that the TL reflect local,
sustainable resources.  If some aerospace company were to arrange a deal
with a convenient Imperial megacorporation to build a starship assembly
yard in Bremen ...

I\'d interpret these results as a low-tech world with some type of high-tech
outpost on it for some reason.  Perhaps a megacorporation is taking advantage
of cheap labor by putting a starship assembly facility on an underdeveloped
planet (I\'m sure the local high-tech worlds hear a \'great big sucking sound\'
coming from that direction).

> The second flaw in the calculation is to ignore economics,

I didn\'t exactly ignore it ... I was merely commenting on the upper bounds
of what can be built and maintained using the yard capacity available.  I
did present enough data so that you could decide wether or not the worlds
could afford that many ships, but I didn\'t analyze it or comment on it.
I believe Hans has done a good job of commenting on the economic side of
the analysis.

I assume that all (or almost all) new construction for the Imperial Navy is
at TL-15.  Lower-TL ships would be acquired by planetary navies and other
local forces.  As a conservative approximation, this isn\'t bad.  The actual
figures could certainly be higher by a \'significant\' amount (in this case,
by more than the +/- 5% uncertanty in the base data).

It\'s been a while since I did that analysis, but I believe it\'s based on
the Striker figures (30% of 3%).

Correct.  The large table does give local Army and Navy budges by starport
type and TL in local megacredits.  That should be sufficient to figure out
how much the local governments have available for spending on their own
forces.

It\'s worth noting that the bulk of my analysis (numbers of ships) is based
on starport construction and maintenance capacity, and NOT tax revenue.  In
other words, it\'s an analysis of what the Imperium could build, if funds
and manpower was available.

TCS doesn\'t require shipyard capacity for maintenance, but it\'s traditional
that Traveller ships require an annual maintenance in a starport.  Since
the TCS "port capacity" figures are based primarily on population, I
assume that the limiting factor is the available workforce.  I\'m being 
conservative again, I assumed that an annual maintanance requires the
same workforce as construction.   I\'ve provided enough numbers so that you 
can compute the (much larger) naval capacity using other scenarios.

As a rough approximation, the total number of ships that is supportable more 
than doubles if you assume annual maintanance does not require shipyard
capacity.  However, about half of these ships must now be non-jump-capable,
since they\'re constructed at Class-B starports.

That was my assumption as well.  IMHO, it makes sense that you\'d need to
use shipyard capacity to build replacements for a ship.  If nothing else,
by the end of the assumed lifetime of a starship (80 years), you\'d want
to replace it with an improved (higher-TL) ship, rather than an exact
copy of the old ship.  The TCS rules pretty clearly indicate that you\'d
have to use shipyard capacity to build the replacement, and then put the
old one in ordinary or pay it off.

Also note that, since the analysis was based on shipbuilding factors, the
only limit on the number of ships in the "mothball fleet" is the available
funds for maintaining them.

>[battleships, riders, and monitors]

You\'re right; the size mix for these vessels seems to be messed up.  It\'s
relatively easy to choose a different mix and come up with different numbers.
If you switch to smaller ships, you can build significantly more of them.

>Always provided you\'re not including planetary navies in your tax figure.

It\'s worth mentioning that I\'m _not_ working from tax figures for the
analysis of the numbers of ships.  I\'m working from the construction and
maintenance capacity of the shipyards.  If you go with my argument on the
construction and maintenance, then the figures are a conservative upper
limit on the number of ships that could be built and maintained in the
Imperium.  Figuring out how to pay for these ships is your department,
I\'ve provided some basic raw data, but didn\'t analyse it.  ;-)

It\'s not clear from TCS if the Imperial Navy\'s ship construction and
maintanace facilities are included in the shipbuilding figures.  For
purposes of the analysis, I assumed that they are, but the argument can
be made that the figures reflect ONLY local shipbuilding.

A lot depends on the relative size of the vessels.  From a shipbuilding
point of view, small is beautiful.  You can build more aggregate tons of
smaller ships than you can of large ships.  If the average size of tenders,
battleships, and riders was smaller, then the numbers of these ships
would be larger.

I\'m not sure if I buy the 4:3 ration of Battleships to Cruisers.  Given
the overall utility of cruisers, I\'d expect them to be the most numerous
of the three types of ships.

I\'ve always imagined that the Imperium invests heavily in cruisers and
fleet intruders, since they\'re big enough for almost any application of
force short of a war with another interstellar power.  I\'ve always
considered Cruisers to be the long-duration patrol ships of the Imperium
(and Fleet Intruders are likewise, but more so), while Battleships and
Battleriders are more likely to be found at a Depot, unless a serious show
of force is required; YMMV.

Again, this is based on shipyard capacity, not ability to pay for the things.

Let me rephrase that ... if applied to building 400-ton SDBs, 10% of the 
Naval shipbuilding capacity of the Imperium is ehough to sustain a force of 
about 1.15 BILLION of the annoying little things, assuming that someone could 
pay for and man them.  Since that seems rather impossible, I assumed that the
average SDB was much larger (and therefore there are MUCH fewer of them).

>>[Patrol ships]
>I think you are being overly cautious here.

Probably.  I was being conservative, and recalled that Donitz needed a total
of about 3 U-Boats in the inventory for each one that could be on patrol at
any one point in time (this accounts for ships required for training, in
transit, and in refit at any one time).  I upped the figure to 4 to account
for ships that made port calls (or at least basic drive maintenance) of a 
few days between jumps.  While ships could deploy faster in wartime, in
peacetime, they\'d be much less likely to risk back-to-back jumps.

I\'m sorry, Loren, that came out sounding more offensive than it should have. 
I didn\'t mean that to be a slam on you or Frank.  I know you wrote that (very

At one point, either right before the publication of T:TNE, or shortly after 
it, I\'d asked Dave if he\'d ever read Saberhagen\'s Berzerkers.  He told me that 
he\'d never heard of them (I was stunned).  I know I suggested that he read up
on it, since his description of his conception of a Vampire Fleet sounded so
familiar.  That (and the feeling that Dave was the primary architect of the 
Virus) was the basis for my earlier comment on the TML.

Here in Houston we have a non-denominational religious structure (yes, I
wrote that right) called the "Rothko Chapel".  It\'s named so because of
the huge canvases adorning it, painted by \'60\'s artist Mark Rothko, who
was known for his use of broad swathes of color.

All half-dozen of these canvases, two stories high or so each, are
completely black.  Folks will sit on meditation cushions in the middle
of the room and stare at the walls.  After a while you can start to see
brush strokes, and things like that.

So there you have it: jump space is a giant 1960\'s avante-garde art canvas.

Hmmm...Looking at my copy of T4, I still see a draft roll.

It would appear to me, that when you register as an Imperial Subject (i.e. 
get your ImpID), you either have proof of employment, or take a ride with 
the boys in uniform.

(Another reason, IMHO, that there is resentment against the Imperium, 
regardless of the benefits of membership...)

I assume that GGs are the primary line of defense mostly due to the fact 
that a invading fleet will want to fight with full fuel tanks, so that they 
can disengage if necessary.  It might be somewhat awkward to request 
refueling from the Starport before the battle...  :)

No, more like the two shipyards building the SeaWolf class attack subs. 
 Both wanted the Seawolf contract, and to prevent the loss of another 
shipyard capable of building subs for the USN both were assigned specific 
boats.  They are built to a common plan, however.  When we start talking 
about significant sums of cash (credit), companies will adapt or die. 
 Think about the competition between Apple and the PC community. 
 Macintoshes are better machines.  They are also highly proprietary.  Apple 
sits on the edge of oblivion.

To paraphrase, Raymond Moorda, Naval Architect, designs a kickbutt Free 
Trader that will hit 2G 2J and only requires servicing every 2 years, but 
needs specific parts only available at a specific shipyard.  Meanwhile, 
William Doors, N.A., designs another ship (after looking at Raymond\'s 
specifications) that will fill roughly the same need, but using standard 
parts (and juuuust different enough...)  While the custom starship may be 
better, the yard that built it is the only one that can service it. 
 William doesn\'t have as good a starship, but gets scads more licensing 
because there is a larger market available.

between Ray Noorda (CEO of Novell) and Bill Gates (CEO of Microsoft) was 
rather well known.  Bill Gates, IMHO, realized that the bottom line was 
being affected, and dropped the battle.  Ray Noorda, also IMHO, did not. 
 That is why he is no longer with Novell.

Couerls, hell.  Imagine what an army of Ixtls would do!

Captain : "Life support, would you please repeat that?!"

Life support : "Yes, sir, I coulda swore I saw something that looked
like Satan fly past!  All scarlet and mean looking!  Dropped right thru
the ceiling and then thru the floor like they weren\'t even there!"

Engineering : "Captain!  Captain!  You won\'t believe what I just saw

[Stuff about what the Imperium could afford to do...]

I\'ve tried to make this point before.  Yes, huge organizations
have huge resources.  Does this mean they do things that modest
organizations wouldn\'t do because they don\'t bother with the cost?
_No_.  If anything they watch their expenses in a way that may
be even more detailed.  Why?  That is because those organizations
with mind boggling resources have a mind boggling huge number of
things that it could do competing for those resources.  The
Imperium is not going to spend money to stop piracy because
it doesn\'t care about the money and if the cost to completely
eliminate piracy exceeds the losses involved, then you have a
situation where such an effort is dubious, regardless of whether
we are talking about  10% if the Imperium\'s budget or 0.00001%
of the budget.

I hope you were joking? Given the title of your E-Mail, I assume so, however,
just in case...  Murder.. was one of the better Traveller adventures
published for Classic Traveller - The aim was for the ref. to decide who the
murder was and why.. More a how to.. but very enjoyable.. 

I used something similar in an adventure whereby the murder was actually an
escaped \'popsicle\' being transferred from one prison to another on another
planet.. The Lowberth did contain a body - dead, and was the prisoners
guard.. The main problem was that this was a maiden voyage of a giant cruise
ship and there were thousands of possible suspects - to make things worse
this guy had been frozen for crimes against the Imperium during the Civil
War.. Ended up with a hunt through the air vents...

1. Leonard Erickso said earlier that the missles would be limited like
Shoemaker-Levy on impact - sorry.. Missles like shuttles, can be guided into
the atmosphere until it reaches an appropriate depth or is crushed by the
pressure..  We are not talking direct attacks on the atmosphere here..
<<What would  >happen if you set off a fusion warhead waaaaaay down in the

 Would the pressure be enough to sustain a fusion reaction? Or at least make
the fusion reaction that _does_ occur go on a lot longer and be a lot bigger
than it would normally be?
 
 Jupiter is not big enough, by a decent margin, to sustain such
 a reaction.  Wether you could get a bigger reaction if you could
 somehow get a warhead down there, I don\'t know.  Though I\'m not
 sure what one would be intending to blow up...

2. Reason for the question was that in Dag\' we have a highly advanced alien
race that are GG hydrogen-breathers. In order to keep them under control the
IN destroyed one of their colonies as a warning against any future
aggression.

I\'m no scientist so I wished to find out from those with experience in the
field what would happen if missles were exploded in the mixed atmosphere of a
GG. I have elected to go with the pressure wave decimating the colony and
creating a temporary atmospheric discharge.

Thanks for your help.

P.S. Was the Anti-matter Torp ever agreed as a possible and if so what would
its distructive force be? What would be the long term effects of several
missles - eg. could it create a long-term storm in the atmosphere etc..

I\'m looking (probably foolishly) for something that would still be a reminder
three hundred years later..

Again thanks to everyone for their help, much appreciated..

 	Steve them asked what was to stop someone from performing a suicide jump

  >>

Sorry its taken me so long to get involved in this thread - Its been
mentioned elsewhere that thanks to SOM and its thruster plates there is no
need for blast bays - In my campaign all A-C startports have blast bays
because they shield the port against attempted planetary jumps - eg. the
ship\'s jump drive explodes because of the (very) close proximity to gravity
and mass.. The blast bays are a safety measure to confine any such
explosion.. In the only time I\'ve enforced the rule - (a character totally
paranoid had a device fitted to monitor brain activity and when he died - in
a shoot out - the device activated the ship\'s deadman switch and blew up the
ship) it destroyed the bay, did major damage to surrounding buildings and
injured a few personnel that were nearby but failed to do major damage to the
city or to the public areas of the port - within a day the port was once more
running though the area was under repair for several months..

Also although I adventure in CT in the core (Dag\'), I still allow ships
weapons as I equate the area similar to the 17th Century - basically lawful
provided you stayed in civilised systems but there were a lot of hellholes
you didn\'t want \'honest\' citizens to travel to.. Thus the majority of ships
are armed - although these weapon systems are \'sealed\' by the boarding team
on arrival into close orbit - I use a ship\'s gig at most A-B ports to
transfer an official to seal weapons before landing on high pop, high tech
worlds. The use of blast bays renders any hidden weapons use on the ground
pretty limited any way and I place weapon turrets around the ports as
security measures..

On Jumps - SOM states that \'nature has provided certain safeguards which
prevent an object from exiting jumpspace while inside the 100 diameter
limit.. My house rules states that ships can\'t exit near any mass.. Now to me
that means that a ship can appear anywhere outside that limit from any of the
planets... Again house rules - ships exiting jump can arrive anywhere in the
system - good navigation and well maintained jump equipment will ensure that
it is closer to the 100d rather than further out. This obviously makes a
difference to pirates who might hide a distance out and attack poorly
maintained independent merchants - getting tech info on the state of a ship
can be almost as valuable as the cargo manifest - 

Also another house rule - again in SOM (Spacers Bible) - \'after about 150 -
185 hours the ship finally emerges from jumpspace back into our own
universe.. the average duration of the jump is about 168 hours, plus or minus
10%." - I only allow this if the ship\'s jump mechanisms are well maintained -
something few independents appear to do due to the cost. However I do allow
my players to jack up their ship to enable it to make tighter jumps and
provided it is very well maintained and coupled with tight rolls per jump - I
allow the ship to exit closer to the 150 hour mark (155 hours + or - 1d6
hours) allowing them to have more time to get away from following ships  --
IMHO

It gives the engineer characters a real reason to nurse those engines and to
spend time hunting around for new parts, to try new bodges etc.. 

"A quick getaway is more than just a fast maneuvre drive, sonny. Its having a
finely tuned jumpdrive that can make a two parsec jump in under 160 hours!
Impie ships are over eight hours behind you giving you enough time to refuel
and rejump.. That\'s why you WILL pay me the extra cred\'s..."

I am sure there can not possibly be any Winnebagos on the North American
continent that are not driving around southcentral Alaska at 30 mph all
summer stopping suddenly and without notice to look at Dahl Sheep :) 
Therefore I must conclude that you only have problems 8-9 months a year.

ObTraveller:  How would you like to be trying to bring your merchant
ship into port to deliver a cargo.  You will receive a prompt delivery
bonus if you get it delivered soon.  The local government is a type 9
Impersonal Bureaucracy.  They have a first come, first served policy at
their starport.  You have to wait to land until after an old, slow,
breakdown prine, coasting, Heplar ship with an elderly crew who are
doing every landing task cautiously (MT rules double time required)
because they are not competant to do any more.  They leave their landing
warning beacon on all the time and it would be a violation of the
systems safety regulations (law level C) if you turned off your ships
broadcasting of their warning.  So your charecters are just sitting
around waiting, and waiting, and waiting for hour, after hour, after
hour.  The whole time the players ship is broadcasting the other ships
"Warning We Are About To Land ! Waring We Are About To Land !" message
at 80 decibles in Gilbert Gottfreids voice.

Naturally once they get down to the planet the elderly crews ship will
have already picked up all the valuable cargos.  If they try to start
trouble with the others ships crew they will discover that they are up
against the 2020 AD versions of Clint, Arnold, and Sylvester.

This really isn\'t logical. A TL 15 world will pay 30% of its military budget
to the Imperium. The most efficient way for the Imperium to collect those
taxes is by taking them out in ships built in that system. Fine. But the
half of those taxes will go to the subsector forces, and they too would get
TL 15 ships from that world. And finally the planetary navy would use their
42% or more on locally produced TL 15 ships. Moving on to the TL 14 world
next door, the Imperium would get their 30% and again it would be most
efficient to take their taxes out in locally produced ships, this time
TL 14 ships. It\'s true that the taxes from worlds that don\'t produce ships
at all would propably mostly be spent on TL 15 worlds. And in every case,
down to TL 9 much of the planetary navy will be built in-system (Though
planetary navies is allowed to buy from any world within the subsector
(more propably withing reasonable range).

Sure, but IIRC it dosen\'t have to be a world with the TL of the ship in
question, just a class A or B starport. In any case, I wasn\'t saying that
ship maintenance positively didn\'t require shipyard capacity (hereinafter
abreviated SC), just that IF maintenance requires SC, then that capacity
is hidden in TCS games and should be accounted for when you decide to
draw it forth from its hiding place.

And contrariwise, true SC more than doubles if maintenance does require it
and we still want to be compatible with TCS. I actually think that is more
than a little plausible. Remember that by TCS rules you can leave all your
SC totally unused for months, then show up with a damaged ship, use your SC
for a few months, then not use it again for months and still have it
available at a moment\'s notice. That kind of yo-yo-like employment
practices just isn\'t plausible. It seems much more likely to me that if you
have so-and-so many people permanently employed on maintenance and
replacements, then you can temporarily increase your shipyard capacity
by 60 or 70%. Its true that while this models repairs taking a few months
fairly well, permanent construction like a whole new line of battleships
ought to gradually increase excess SC as the workforce expands to meet the
new demand. But that could be explained as a factor omitted from TCS for
simplification.

>That was my assumption as well.  IMHO, it makes sense that you\'d need to
>use shipyard capacity to build replacements for a ship.

Absolutely no argument there. What I was arguing was that just as these
replacements are hidden from the TCS player, the necessary SC might also
be hidden from him. In other words, true shipyard capacity might be 2.5 T
per 1000 inhabitants, but since 60% of that will always be needed for
maintenance and replacements, TCS chose to ignore it.

>If nothing else, by the end of the assumed lifetime of a starship
>(80 years), you\'d want to replace it with an improved (higher-TL) ship,

Not if your TL haven\'t improved. Tech advancement in the Traveller
universe just isn\'t anything like we are used to on Earth today.

We\'ve accounted for that by assuming an average ship size for each category.
I agree with you about cruisers, disagree about battleships and are
doubtful about some of the others.

I\'m not trying to sell it. I just offer the data from 5FW as the best
evidence we have. I admit it is damn poor. In my own recent posting I
assumed 3:7.

  I made some efforts, but it simply couldn\'t fly because I wasn\'t
willing to re-write the Striker rules to allow such a vehicle to
survive multiple hits; after all, on 5-6 a Major penetration is
catastrophic. Later, I was willing, but not interested in doing so.
Hmm, it does have appeal. Are there many people still using Striker

<< eg. the
 ship\'s jump drive explodes because of the (very) close proximity to gravity

 explosion.. >>

Since then I\'d reread SOM once more and came across a passage that
contradicted my statement - P.13 "Jumping in a gravity well - While it is
possible to enter jumpspace from anywhere (even sitting in a docking bay on
the surface of a planet).."

So, IMHO I interpret this to mean that the ship would NOT explode but would
enter jumpspace.. The energy discharge would however cause extensive damage
unless contained and earthed and (new house rule) the grid would be
completely disrupted to such an extent that the jumpfield would fail to
function causing the ship\'s crew to suffer fatal jump sickness.. Still the
need for blast bays however.

Here\'s a thought from another section of SOM - P.11 "the grid display
displayed a rupture.. tore a hole about half a metre across.. The jump field
closed up all right .. but the field deformation extended too far into the
room and he died a few days later of jump sickness..."

What if a hull breach means that the jump field flows through the hole and
blisters in ever extending, and thinning as it goes. Eventually it will be so
thin that it will rupture allowing jumpspace in - unless... The only thing
that can stop it would be for the players to create a grid (its my
understanding that the grid maintains the jump field - switch it off and the
field goes down!) to stop it extending any further. laugh as the players hunt
for enough lanthanum to create a \'patch\', snigger as they try and figure out
how to power it up without destroying themselves.  By trying to place the
patch as close to the breached hole as possible it would restore or at least
strengthen the jump field integrity.

Another aside, re jumpspace dementia - I vote for the seeing things in the
black explanation except that the brain interprets the psionic reflection as
well as the visual.

On jumpspace monsters - in my campaign they exist: 

*Moses David

 Only known space-dwelling species discovered within Dagudashaag. The
Moses David inhabited the asteroid belt of Mianda (2533). Discovered
in 342 by the famous amateur biologist Patriach Moses David Ba-Shuu
of Shardi (285 - 397), Moses David were a type of border creature
between animal and plant similar in design concept to the Terran jelly-fish.
They were shaped like an open umbrella composed of a gelatinous-like
substance with several  \'feeding\' tentacle-like appendages growing
underneath. The main body could grow up to 35m across and the appendages
as long as 100m. Moses David existed by feeding on the ice and minerals
of the asteroids using their tentacles to anchor themselves and absorb
the minerals and frozen water into the vein-like structure that networked
across the umbrella where sunlight and hard radiation reacted with
the chlorophyll-like substance within their body or  \'sail\' to alter
the minerals into the living organic substances that they needed to
exist. Moses David moved around by means of gas sacs under the  \'sail\'
which were filled with carbon dioxide produced as a side product of
their metabolism. They could close the sail by muscular con traction
which caused a stream of gas to propel them from asteroid to asteroid.
Moses David were declared a protected species in 566.

Ref. Note: Moses David\'s absorb lanthanum and continue to grow until such
time as they enter jumpspace (almost always weave level 1) whereupon they
exist outside time and space.. Given the immensity of the dimension it is
rare for ships to encounter them and even rarer to see them through the
jumpfield though certain \'sensitives\' can feel their presence - giant,
inhuman intelligences trapped, and dying yet unable to do so as time does not
exist...

Again just a personal bit of fun but it adds to the mythic nature of
JumpSpace - the ship that encountered them - bumped into one and for a second
the ships jump field enclosed it too .. A halucination? Then what is that
gunk all over the ships\' hull???

   I find it highly unlikely that the Imperium drafts locals.  My take on
   the draft roll has always been that you get drafted into a local
   service, usually the planetary army or navy.  If the Imperium is short

To me, this is an example of the same flawed reasoning that has been
used in the piracy thread.  Just because something is possible
doesn\'t mean it is inevitable.  Putting cameras in places isn\'t
that expensive _today_, but they are hardly universal, even
in high crime places.  Because most the time it just isn\'t
worth the bother.

anyone is familiar with a short story I read lo these twenty years ago or
so and recalled the other day.  It was anthologized in a library book,
so I suspect it predates the \'70\'s by a fair amount.

The setting is a "treasure trove" city on an alien planet, chock-full of
precious metals and artifacts.  But it\'s guarded by a fearsome robot who,
whenever someone comes calling, asks them an obscure question and then
kills them when they answer.  Our Hero and his partner have equipped their
ship with top-of-the-line library data in order to answer any question
perfectly via a radio link: but the partner still gets killed despite his 
flawless answers.

Our Hero then figures out that the robot _isn\'t_ looking for  answers, and
tries it out on non-sequiturs.  (Made-up example -- Q: "Who was the leading
artist of the Genji period on Maranatha XII?"  A: "Truly, art matters little
beside the eternal quest for wisdom.")  Sure enough, he passes safely through
the gauntlet and begins loading up the ship with booty.

It\'s a long, hard day of stevedore duty.  As the sun sets and the last
load is put in place, the robot, who\'s been tagging along asking question
throughout, inquires "Why do you want these things?"  "Because they\'re
pretty," replies our exhausted protagonist.

So the robot kills him.

Ring any bells?

But what is logical and efficient has nothing to do with government. 
 Political expiedency is the rule.

First off, the shipyard is not necessarily run by the government.  It is a 
division of some corp or mega-corp.  Placing the burden of taxes on that 
one company or consortium is a trifle unfair, no?  Second, there are a slew 
of political reasons why the Imperium can not go directly to a shipyard for 
work, starting off with the Archduke\'s sister\'s husband\'s brother who acts 
as a general contractor for that work normally.  Why, to cut him out of the 
project would mean...  Well, it couldn\'t...  Ummm, take my word for it, 
he\'s important.  :)

Governments, even the best of \'em, suffer from inefficiency and lack of 
direction.  A dispersed self-perpetuating oligarchy such as the Imperium 
would not even come near what I would envision as the best.

Actually 4:1 is a good estimate.  The USN (when we had the budget) would 
have one carrier BG working up for deployment, one carrier BG deployed, one 
carrier BG on post deployment standdown (and being in reserve if the caca 
hit the oscellating air mover), and one carrier BG in maintenance (either 
in a shipyard or by a tender).

This is, btw, why I have always disagreed with the 1 world 1 SDB theory of 
piracy suppression.

my friends on the TML in on a recent decision I\'ve made in my life.

For the past 7 years, I\'ve had this incredible dream of making a movie. 
After graduation from college, though, I did like all other good college
students did, I went off and persued a career in medical sales instead
of following my heart.

I always had the intention of working on my film in my off time.  I
thought I\'d make money at a career to finance my dream.

Well, here I am, 7 years later, almost 32 years old, and I don\'t have
anything to show for it.  My passion is still my passion, but I don\'t
have a script, and I sure as hell don\'t have a complete feature film.

Some of you know that my mom passed away a short while ago.  When you
loose somebody like that, it sure makes you think of your own
mortality.  It makes you re-evaluate your own life and goals.

I thought to myself that I\'ve got this passionate dream, and if I keep
going the way I\'m going, I\'m never going to do anything about it.

With this in mind, I made a big decision last week.  I\'m going to devote
my life right now to making this thing--my film.  I\'ve moved out of my
condo and in with my dad (he needs me right now anyway).  I\'ve paid off
all of my bills, and I\'ve quit my job.

I\'m going to work at getting this independent film made as a full time
proposition.  In order to eat, I\'m going to get a part time
job--something dead-head that I won\'t have to think about or bring home.

I plan to have the script written in a few months--probably about
three.  Then, I\'ll be raising money to film it.  I want to get principal
photography completed sometime next year, then I\'ll raise more money and
go into post.

It\'s truly amazing the support I\'m getting.  I really had no idea how
people would respond to this, but I actually have people cheering for
me.  My dad, brother and sister are all for it.  My best friend gave me
$1000 towards the filming budget for next year.  All told, the few
people I\'ve spoken with so far about this have contributed to getting
this thing done, and I\'ve raised $2200 in a week.

I\'m not soliciting funds here on the TML, so please don\'t take it that
way.  I\'m just excited about getting this thing going, and I\'m reporting
to anybody that is interested in this that it is finally, really,
honestly, moving in that direction.

I won\'t be wasting bandwidth on the TML with this non-Traveller related
material--it\'s not the place--but I\'ve come to know some of you quite
well, and I wanted to share this with you.

I\'m extremely excited, and determined, about this.

If anybody has comments, please don\'t bore the rest of the list with
them.  You are welcome (anytime, as always), to write me in private.

Thanks for letting me share this with you.

....and now, back to your regularly scheduled Traveller communications.

wet bar ensure a comfortable trip for passengers. While not fast enough to
compete with express aircraft, the Mavros is considerably cheaper to own and
operate, and admirably serves its niche.

Additionally, they don\'t appear to solve the crime problem.  British studies
showed that cameras shifted crime into unphotographed areas rather than
eliminated it.  Thus, you can make your nice Tory neighbourhood safer, but
the nearby set of Council flats gets more dangerous.

ObTrav: This could be a useful plot device to make some parts of a city much
more dangerous than others.  The group, planning a shady deal, passes a sign
reading "You are now entering an unmonitored area" and figures they can start
talking.  Meanwhile, the local muggers, concentrated in this small
neighbourhood, figure they can start working.

Inertial comps simply sense the accleration and compensates with
floorfields, they consists of plus and minus floorfield plates mounted
along all three axes. They also need to be fast to compensate quick enough.
They\'re just called Inertial Comps by nontechnical people (that\'s my take

show up some shortcomings of the VDS.  For one, it won\'t let you put power
plants (i.e. parents) on the outside.  Crewstations are fixed in size and
cannot be adjusted to take into account age, size, or degree of toilet
training of passengers.  Furthermore it does not allow  you to adjust
ejection seats to fit the same criteria.  Food supply for parents is
ludicrously large; mommy & daddy must be on a high-bulk diet.   Aside from
that, though, everyone should run out and buy Macs so that they can use
Rob\'s CSC.  It  rocks.

   I find it highly unlikely that the Imperium drafts locals.  My take on
   the draft roll has always been that you get drafted into a local
   service, usually the planetary army or navy.  If the Imperium is short
   of personel, they can always abscond some from their vassals.  I can\'t
   even imagine an Imperium-wide registry.

I am saying, based on what I am seeing in CT, MT, TNE and T4 that some form 
of mandatory employment through age 22 does seem to be in effect.  I do 
think that planetary and system requirements would be filled first, but we 
have already established that the SubSector and Imperial beauracracies do 
require manpower to fill positions, be it in the military, the merchant 
service, or the beauracracy.

I\'m not sure I\'d be willing to pay Cr 6448 to walk the tike down the street!
Seems that the pricing in the program may be a bit high for some cases as
well. All in all though, from your other posts I really wish Rob would port
it to the Evil Empire, I have too much invested to change!

That\'s good news!  Over here in the US we got some of the Sharpe\'s on
public broadcasting\'s Masterpiece Theatre. They were all set in Spain,
though. Aren\'t there some Sharpe novels set before and after the Peninsula
Campaign?

As for Hornblower, I\'d *love* for somebody to do a whole series following
his career from Midshipman to Admiral.  Of course, that could be several
years worth of shows. ;->

<< Has he (or anybody) explained just how his STL/FTL systems are supposed to
 work?
 
 I get the impression it\'s all based on gravity control with ?high? gravity
 bands running from the Alpha to the Beta nodes along the top and bottom of
 the ships. Just how this translates into forward momentum, I don\'t know. 
 Anyway ships can accelerate at several hundred g\'s and missles at
 ?thousands?, I think.
 
 At FTL, I *think* the ship translates into a ?hyperspace? where the Alpha
 nodes are unfolded into ?gravity? sails that catch some sort of gravity
 currents that flow naturally.  In this hyperspace the effective velocity is
 greater than c, but I don\'t know exactly how much.
 
 Then there are the ?junction? points that allow instantanous movement from
 place to place. Natural wormholes, maybe?
 
 If we had some details about how his IC/AG and STL/FTL worked we could
 pretty easily adapt the rest of it to Traveller. Or, actually, adapt the
 rest of Traveller to his universe. >>

Well, everything you wrote sounds like a perfect description of it from the
book!  The drive nodes are supposed to channel a "wedge" of stressd gravity
bands above and below the ship...allowing it to achieve accels of over 500 Gs
for light combatants, and even 300-350 GS for superdreadnoughts.  This is one
of the things about his universe I like... they operate at VERY high
velocities!

The speed of the ships is only limited by the grav comps...which is Traveller
related also (I wonder how many people actually realize that 6-G combat
vessels are purely TL 15 creations, since it\'s only then that G-comps handle
6-Gs [per FF&S2] ).

Hyperspace is used to make the long crossings between stars...by changing the
wedge to the sail configuration, it is supposed to use the grav waves to
increase accel by 10 times...since about the max accel under normal drive is
near .6-.7c, this means that the ships will be doing 6-7 times lightspeed.

And then the wormholes...just what they sound like.  The only problem w/
making all this work for Trav is his universe just moves too fast.  I may be
wrong, but his universe seems loosely tied with the STARFIRE game universe
also, which he helped create.  

But still...absolutely great books!  Makes me wish they had busted Hornblower
a few times, so we could have had some more books!

And why _not_, sir?  Tsk, tsk, tsk.  We are not amused.  Though TravMoms is
surely pleased with this bout of sanity.  And I must point out -- it isn\'t
quite large enough to accomodate Leroy.

I think the time has come for me to get CSC and permit the Sayat Bureau for

There is absolutely no reason why pre-citizens who are not yet

safeguarding civilization from Lurking Alien Evil.  Indeed not.

  Umm, reasoning? Why would I bother with that? I didn\'t make any
conclusions, after all...

  Here\'s an interesting proposition for the Traffic Control types;
you\'re being asked to haul a passenger in your trader to a pre-stellar
tech world (TL 7-8?). You\'re required to go through the starport,
preferably without a search. The passenger _must_ not go through the
port, but has no official standing (i.e., not IN, noble, or eminent
mafioso). The passenger has extensive marine type experience for a
non-combat insertion.

  How do you do it with a minimum risk of you or the passenger getting
caught? (No, not a puzzle, just working out solutions). Payment is on
completion. No, they won\'t tell you who he is or what he\'s doing.

   The majority of worlds on the FFW map have no SDBs, and, from a 
casual glance, a good startport or the presence of a Naval Base does 
not increase the odds of the system having any (or for that matter, 
neither does being a subsector capital help).  It looks like most 
high-pop worlds have at least 50+ SDBs.  The highest totals on the 
Imperial side are 1000 at Rhylanor, and 500 at each of Louzy and 
Rethe.  Of those non-high-pop worlds that have SDBs, they normally 
have around a dozen ships.

Luckily there can\'t *be* an army of Ixtls. Not unless the players lose.
And I do think that most players are paranoid enough to survive that.

To switch books, I\'d like to see some players land on a planet with the
Weapon Shops of Isher on it. Specificly, all the trigger happy, overly
be-weaponed types. :-)

Well, one of the *big* problems is the hull. It is stated in one of the
Bolo stories that the Mark III had 25 *millimeters* of "durachrome"
armor, and that this was protection against anything short of a
*contact* nuclear blast!

I\'m not sure we have anything *that* tough available in Traveller.

Also, by the Mark X or so, we are dealing with *serious* AI. A Mark X
or Mark XII (I can\'t recall, and the book isn\'t accessible) was
sufficiently "human" that it fought on against impossible odds when
logic dictated that it should have retreated. When asked *why* it did
such an illogical thing, it replied "For the honor of the Regiment,
sir."

By the Mark XXXV Bolo, you have something that would shrug off the
Virus as a nuisance. In fact there are several instances of that range
of Bolo *taking over* computers when the Enemy was stupid enough to let
them close enough.

I\'d make them something that explorers find on the fringes of a remote
pocket empire, where they are relics from before that empire\'s "Long
Night". Said Long Night being caused by a war with aliens that the
humans (a new major race) barely won.

Bear in mind that the forces in FFW appears to have been "abbreviated".
The average Imperial fleet has 8-10 combat squadrons and the average
subsector (colonial) fleet ought to have about the same. Thus initial
deployments on the FFW map ought to have been ~70 squadrons (the FFW
covers about 4 subsectors, IIRC). Assuming that half the forces in the
rest of the Domain of Deneb + Corridor was left in place, immidiate
reinforcements (those that comes as soon as they hear of the war) ought
to be about 325 squadrons. Further reinforcements reactivated reserves)
are more difficult to estimate, since we don\'t know just how many ships
are laid up in ordinary (my estimates vary from 50% to 800% of active
strength, depending on assumptions), but they should begin to show up
before six months are out (anything laid up at Rhylanor begins to become
available after three months (it takes about 10 weeks to reactivate a
battleship).

The SDB strengths are propably equally flawed.

The problem is that your examples (about tanks etc) are not valid in the
currrent thread (about ships and mostly passive IR signatures). The IR
signatures are governed by thermodynamics and we\'re not extrapolating
sensors into the future - these are off the shelf sensors of today. What
the poor pirates has to do is the same as real pirates of today do: ignore
stealth and stuff (leave that to defense budget backed projects)
concentrate on looking legitimate. Bogus transponders, faked distresscalls
etc would be valid pirate tactics as well as moles in the crew/passengers
of the target ship that disable p-plant/comm etc.

Although those books may not explicitly say so, there is an older rule from
Classic Traveller that no ship below 100 tons may have a jump drive.

The same rule was broken by the Adventure entitled _Leviathan_ (13?) which
had jump message torps (unmanned).  This whole concept has been the source
of much debate here on this list in the past.

Megatraveller generally followed this rule, but I think TNE did not,
although Fire Fusion & Steel (I) may have made ships less than 100 dtons
inconvenient from a design standpoint.

Suffice it to say that, if you wish to design vessels smaller than 100
dtons in your campaign, the official rules will probably not support you.
You may need to interpolate or guess at certain aspects of the data.

Have Fun!

And watch out for Jump Torpedos approaching at relativistic velocities!

I think it might be, but I do not have great alternatives to offer.

An analysis of the number of skills a CT player got showed that the Scouts
alone, 1/6th of the population, could produce any conceivable number of
Pilot-6s, if the chargen charts represented the average person\'s life.

I do not have a good solution for you, save to note that the military,
which are represented in four of the basic services should really be far,
far less than 10% of the population most of the time, and that producing
enough of those ships would consume way, way too much cash.

My general rule is that you must pick one place to stand, state it loudly,
and then see what it implies.  I have settled on PCGPP as my spot, and it
seems that we should have an average one of about 10KCr/person, +/- 3KCr.
(Drawn from Striker, food costs in T4, present day GNPs and a credit<->$
conversion.  Which one you make "real" and which you make derived will
determine what number you get.)

Given that, we know how much money the Imperium has as an economic body,
and then we can decide how much of it goes through space, and how much is
used to defend that part going through space.  Once you know that, you can
decide if ships are too cheap or too expensive in order to determine how
the world works.

As far as the skill level thing goes, I have decided to create some
standards, purely by fiat.  These will state the odds of encountering a
certain skill level in a profession, the rough fraction of the society that
includes that profession, and whether the profession is especially
selective or profitable.  With luck, I can then beat the task system and
chargen to make that happen.

God only knows when I will find the time to do this, though.

True.  On the other hand, while they have a lot of things they could do, it
is very important to know if they could possibly do prevent piracy, were
they willing.  If they can\'t, then the debate is over.  For example, if
ships travelled in real space between stars, it would be very difficult to
police that much area, even if they wanted to more than anything.

I do not think there is much disagreement that they could, *** if they
wanted to ***, put enough SDBs in orbit around one gas giant and one planet
per system to make snaking in, piracy, and other good things impossible.
Your thesis is that there would be enough they would want to do with those
resources that they would not.

And I have tried to make these points before:

The ships that might be lost cost a hell of a lot.  Up to a factor of 25
more than present day vessels with similar missions.  Even a very small
chance of loss will make a note holder uncomfortable, and note holders tend
to control money.

The cargoes needed to pay for these ungodly expensive ships have to produce
revenue sufficient to pay for an ungodly expensive ship.  Simple economics,
thus they also will have a relatively high value.  Perhaps not enough to
justify anti piracy without the expensive ships, but still, expensive
enough to make an insurer unhappy if the chance of loss is significant.

The military ships needed to defend these merchants do not cost much more
than the merchants, so it takes very, very few incidents to justify anti
piracy efforts, especially since it takes only a few hundred thousand
people to pay the costs for a patrol ship, and a single loss of a large
merchant to justify three Kinunirs.

_Interstellar_ piracy prevention can be afforded, if the Imperium wants to,
because of the aforementioned low cost of military ships, the small area
which you need to defend to prevent interstellar piracy, and the military
budget they have.  You may argue still that they do not, but I just do not
see how such large down sides, and small (relative) costs could fail to
justify it.

Interplanetary piracy opens up a much larger area, and I would be very
surprised if it could be stopped by any other method than convoys.

I can\'t decide if I\'m happy or sad that they\'re doing Horblower and not
O\'Brian...I suppose they can get all the special effects right on Hornblower
before moving on to the more important stuff. I suppose Hornblower is easier
to cast than O\'Brian, too.

(For those who have no idea who I\'m talking about - Patrick O\'Brian has
written a long, brilliant series of Napoleonic naval stories centered around
Jack Aubrey - a captain in the RN - and Stephen Maturin, his particular
friend, surgeon, and intelligence agent. They\'re (in my opinion) much better
than the Hornblower novels - more humour, better characterization, better
period feel (although even O\'Brian admits that Forrester was possibly better
at describing battles, O\'Brian is definitely better at describing everything
else. The first book (one of the weaker ones) is "Master and Commander" - 
either it or "HMS Surprise" are good places to start. They\'re a great
inspiration for a Navy-based campaign - my view of Traveller naval combat and
lifestyle is fairly close to Napoleonic.)

  So the guesses about deployment seem reasonable. It also coincides
with the belief that planets incapable of building their own SDB\'s
will not have SDB forces deployed (they might have police cutters
not intended to hunt warships, but I suspect that my Far Trader
smuggler might have an excellent chance against one or two of those).

  OTOH, even with GG and deep-space (if any) deployments a system
with a high SDB strength will still be able to patrol all choke-
points adequately, even if the worlds themselves somehow have no
other defenses (!).

	Over the past few years, I have reread most of my old Heinlein books.
	Some of those that I had loved the most as a youth, had lost some of
	their charm; two that had retained all of the special qualities that
	originally endeared them to me were, surprisingly, unmentioned on the
	various lists of Heinlein\'s works: "The Door Into Summer" and
	"Doublestar." As I age, I find more in these than I saw as a child --
	it\'s like reading Austen or Forrester[sp?].

Hello,
  We both appear to pointing out that GG\'s will be battle, training,
and possibly peacetime deployment sites for non-SDB units. The post
I was responding to seems to be the one we\'re both disagreeing with.

  BTW, what other possible peacetime deployments would seem likely
for active service CruRons and BatRons?

Hello, 
  I\'m still thinking in terms of a well-equipped merchant looking
for targets of opportunity - you\'ve got forever to look, as you\'re
making a profit on regular operations, and taking a heavy risk for
one big score (the target _ship_ at MCr 15-50, ideally) is worth it
if you\'re so inclined.

  OTOH, a ship too specialized to make money may very well end up
toasted because you jumped a bad target because payroll was overdue.
The authorities, whether they encounter you casually or whether they
are being proactive, may very well notice that you may not be able to
make money honestly. Also, if you\'ve got much more than MCr 10-15 to
invest, why not just build a world-based criminal organization. You
can always pirate vicariously by specializing in providing services
to hijackers, smugglers, pirates, and shipping fraud artists.

	Well, Leroy would fit just fine into this.  It\'s accomodating his

Hello,
  There still remains the issue (even if piracy will not be combated
using dual-purpose assets in place) of the military security of the
3I. Asides from the case that it appears unconcerned with the lack
of legitimacy flowing from its unwillingness or inability to police
within its borders, or the weakening of its economic strength as
resources are destroyed or redirected to unacceptable ends, I doubt
anyone will argue that they are very concerned with the physical
security of their external borders.

  However, enemy intelligence operations (such as squadron deployments,
basing, SDB/PD strengths) can easily penetrate the border, and would
then under these assumptions be able to function easily as pirates or
merchants using forged papers. Internal and external security functions
seem inextricably linked, just as they are in the modern world. Further,
small commerce raiders could be easily pre-placed along with their
supplies and their target familiarization runs under this regime.

  If the 3I is incapable of providing necessary security, why does it
still exist, or why did it ever? I suspect that a non-zero level of
piracy exists at an equilibrium acceptable to the Imperium, but that
full-time pirates would suffer an attrition rate too high for their
returns or for their cover function for intel ops to be desirable.

    'body' => '	In a sudden bout of insanity, I decided to take a closer look at
the FF&S2 gun designs I\'ve done in order to get a grip on the recoil
numbers for pistols.  My findings do seem to match Wildstar\'s.  Recoil on
light pistols should be under 2, recoil starts getting heavy around 3, 4 is
unusual, and 5+ would likely be really brutal.  Weight relative to muzzle
energy seems to be the most determining factor, although gyrostabilization
and muzzle brakes make a big difference too.  Designs follow.

	What would be really useful is if somebody did a bunch of rifle
designs modelling current firearms, so that we could get a handle on how
much recoil is too much for long arms.


1) TL-12 7.5 mm pistol:  This one was done using TL-12 advanced materials;
the weight is relatively low, which explains why the recoil is relatively
high in comparison to the muzzle energy and hence damage.  This is
comparable to a normal, non-psychotic handgun such as a .45 or a 9mm;
recoil is right where Wildstar\'s ratings would put it.


Length:			24.5 cm
Bulk:			2
Mass (empty):		1.16 kg
Mass (loaded):		1.33 kg
Price (no mag):		1612 cr
Actual Muzzle Energy:	450 joules
Basic Range:		9.76 m (Very Short)
Damage:			2 slug, 3 (3.18) HE/HEAP
Recoil:			Single shot: 2.27, B.-of-3: 3.41

Feed: Grip mag, 25 rounds (sticks out a bit)



2)  Another TL-12 7.5 mm pistol; however, the recoil is much more
manageable on this one despite the higher muzzle energy; the muzzle brake
and extra weight from the accessories really help.

Length:				28.75 cm
Bulk:				2
Mass (empty):			2.19 kg
Mass (loaded):			2.39 kg
Price (no mag):			823 cr
Basic Range:			10 m (Short)
Actual ME: 			737.6 joules
Damage:				2 (2.58) slug, 3 (3.57) HE/HEAP
Recoil:				Single shot: 1.39, B.-of-3: 2.09

Reciever: SA, Burst-of-5, hollow pistol grip, optic sight, laser pointer
Barrel: TL-12 light rifled, 12 cm, short muzzle brake (recoil mod: .75)
Feed: Grip mag, 25 rounds (sticks out a bit)


3) TL-12 8mm pistol: the aim here was a light, cheap, compact, Saturday
Night Special sort of weapon.  Note the recoil!


Length:				23.1 cm
Bulk:				1
Mass (empty):			0.513 kg
Mass (loaded):			0.613 kg
Price (no mag):			138.75 cr
Basic Range:			8.2 m (Very Short)
Actual ME: 			285.27 joules
Damage:				1 (1.61) slug, 3 (3.033) HE/HEAP
Recoil:				Single shot: 4.69, B.-of-3: 7.04

Feed: Grip mag, 17 rounds


4) .44 magnum hand cannon: this is one of the Marathon weapons I posted a
while ago.  Price is due to use of TL-8 advanced materials (and eve so it\'s
still real heavy).  Note that although muzzle energy is six and a half
times higher than the previous design, recoil is actually lower.  Weight
helps.


Weapon length: 			37 cm
Bulk: 				2
Mass: 				loaded 2.894 Kg, empty 2.578 Kg
Price: 				3,364 Cr.
Basic Range:			19.35 m (Short Range in T4 range bands)
Actual Muzzle Energy:		1,850
Damage: 			4 (actually 4.09) HE/HEAP: 5.54
Recoil:				3.06


5) My most-optimised take on a TL-9 .47 automag.  I did this for Ross\'s
current campaign.  Compare with the previous design.

Weapon length:			28.1 cm
Bulk: 				2
Mass: 				loaded 2.21 Kg, empty 1.6 Kg
Price: 				1416 Cr.
Cartridge: 			11.75X32.2 mm straight cased
Barrel length: 			9.8 cm
Actual Muzzle Energy: 		1,350 joules
Reciever:			TL-9 light semi-auto, TL-8 advanced materials,
		 		hollow pistol grip, optic sight
Basic Range: 			16.9 m (Short Range).
Damage: 			3 (3.499), 4 (4.06) HE/HEAP
Recoil: 			3.319

Magazine (12-round grip): Mass: 189.4 g empty, 615.52 g full.Price: 1.9 Cr
empty, 18.94 Cr full



6) TL-12 12mm heavy pistol: continuing towards the high end of the scale.
Note how the use of TL-12 advanced materials affects both price and recoil.


Length:				31 cm
Bulk:				2
Mass (empty):			1.43 kg
Mass (loaded):			1.62 kg
Price (no mag):			2066 cr
Basic Range:			20.3 m (Short)
Actual ME: 			1721.7 joules
Damage:				4 (3.95) slug, 5 (5.26) HE/HEAP
Recoil:				Single shot: 3.84, B.-of-3: 5.76
Feed: 				Grip mag, 11 rounds



7) TL-14 10mm gauss pistol: Very light relative to its damage.  The three
settings (Kill, Really Kill, and Overkill) display nicely the way recoil
climbs really quickly with a light weapon, even with the use of a
gyroscopic recoil compensator.  I suspect that burst-of-five at Really
Kill, and all burst settings at Overkill would be factory disabled.


Length:				26.4 cm
Mass (empty):			14-round mag: 1.97 kg; 21-round mag: 2.07 kg
Mass (loaded):			14-round mag: 2.08 kg, 21-round mag: 2.24 kg
Price (no mag):			997.89 cr
Basic Range (supersonic):	23.34 m (Short)
Basic Range (medium):		17.29 m (Very Short)
Basic Range (subsonic):		11.38 m (Very Short)
ME (supersonic):		1788 joules
ME (medium):			981.25 joules
ME (subsonic):			424.85 joules
Damage (supersonic):		4 (4.02) dart, 5 (5.64) HE/HEAP
Damage (medium):		3 (2.98) dart, 5 (4.96)HE/HEAP

and \'anti-piracy thread\' camp ;), and really haven\'t done anything
except stir the waters and develop a number of very cool off-shoots.

As Hans pointed out earlier, we have the following situation:

A: Piracy is canon, it is mentioned throughout the life of Traveller; it
is represented in both the encounter tables and the chargen tables

B: Naval and Industrial Capacity would seem to support the idea that
Piracy can be stamped out.

As Hans pointed out, A can exist, B can exist, but A and B cannot
exist.  (Am I getting this correct?)

So...

Instead of arguing from the outside in (ie why one exists rather than
the other), let\'s shift.  Let\'s argue from the inside out!

I _think_ we are all in agreement that having pirates in the game adds
flavor and some excitement.  Having PCs that have that in their
background gives the GM a fair amount of history to draw on.  So, rather
than developing a either/or situation (which really doesn\'t help anyone,
even if it is fun to debate) let\'s concentrate on developing the
rationale where such a situation _could_ occur (which _would_ help the
GMs at large, since we have to turn around and explain to our players
why we just blew their ship to MC^2 with a pirate that shouldn\'t be
there!)  Perhaps one of the several authors that frequent the list will
be able to produce something constructive that we can then point to as
\'canon\' when this debate (inevitably) resurfaces in the future!  :)

    'body' => 'Hello,
  With regards to the piracy thing, let\'s work through where in
a i) high pop system, you\'d be safe to rip-off starships.

  For convenience sake, this is a stellar tech culture in a system
effectively identical to ours, with a few billion+ sapient critters.

  Say there\'s a few colonial BatRons and CruRons (some of the latter
are elsewhere), lots of little warships, and the happy little animals
of the SDB/COACC arm. All the heavy iron is parked around the main
world except for a few cruisers around the GG\'s and Mars. Reasonable?

  Let\'s assume that a manned merchant starship can and will be able
to cry for (distant, likely) help using his maser, and that traffic
control will get on your case big time if your transponder (not an
Imperial series, just a repeater for ID/location, etc.) isn\'t up.
You also get fined if they catch you throwing pig iron ingots or the
like out of the cargo hatch...  ...right?

  Masses inside the orbit of Terra are a non-starter. A vessel can\'t
jump safely from inside Sol\'s 100-D zone (correct?), and waiting to
get out will entail a very likely risk of meeting something big and
furry. Economically, it\'s also debatable that a J-merchant would
even be down there in a fully developed system. The risks seem too
high for anyone not truly desperate (hmm, that leaves some potential).

  Terra. Jump limit is ~1.2 million km? Four L-S? Forget traffic control
corridors, if anyone screams "Pirate", you\'re dead if you twitch wrong.
Forget inbound, that\'s simply crazy. Outbound, matching courses, you\'re
stationary. Something from orbit will vapourize you in seconds, and all
you have to do is prepare to jump or maneuver without permission. OK,
you might last a few minutes, but you\'re not playing around with cargo
boxes in that time. Now, hijacking seems a different kettle of fish,
but that\'s a whole different thread.

  Mars. See above, to a large extent. If you cripple another outbound
ship and match trajectories 3 L-S from a 20 KDt cruiser, you\'re still
dead. Remember, a stationary target may as well be 3 km from the guns.

  The Gas Giants. Well, the System Navy probably has some big guns
passing the time here, at least at Jupiter/Saturn, as they protect
the entire cluster of facilities and habitations there. They also
probably have a bad case of SDB\'s, but it\'s hardly relevant.

  The outer GG\'s. Well, they\'ll have a picket system of some sort
for security. Probably SDB\'s. Why anyone else would be there sort
of escapes me.

  Pluto? Why? You can probably rig an armed picket system up for
a reasonable bill after the first time someone does get pirated
there.

  The Asteroid belt. This is virtually indefensible. One defense,
however, is not to use (Jump) ships. Ore? Kick it downhill to a
smelter where energy is cheap, and save the bulk handling. Gotta
ship something? Manned or not, if it isn\'t jumping, why waste the
interest costs on the J-drive, and the lost cargo space? But if
I own an armed rustbucket and no social conscience, I might sit
and try/pretend to prospect until a nice fat one came along and
then take it, and decide what to do with the proceeds long before
anyone else can do anything about it. OC, this is where "an armed
society is a polite society" applies - if the armed merchant zaps
my j-drive, I have a couple days to come up with some really poor
excuses before that patrol cruiser arrives.

  In all seriousness, any defended point is almost impossible to
safely touch in such a system, unless you\'re a dedicated cruiser
class commerce raider, which is clearly outside of the case.

        Yours truly,
                Steven Hudson

Well, let\'s see: a 4cm cannon projectile would have a nominal energy of
0.15Mj, and we\'ll punch in the figures at TL-10..  With the various warheads
available, that works out to:

HE: Pen 8
HEAP: Pen 68
KEAP: Pen 77

A CPR (chemically-propelled round) gun or a mass driver gun would have these
same characteristics (assuming that both weapons had a 0.15MJ muzzle energy.

A plasma or fusion gun with the same pulse energy would have a damage of 15.
A laser with a 0.15MJ discharge energy would have a damage of 19.
I\'m not sure if the calculation for a particle beam is correct (damage 2;
IMHO it should be around damage 39 - about twice that of a laser with the
same discharge energy).

The plasma/fusion gun is most comparable to the slugthrower using general
purpose (GP, also known as HE) ammunition.  As you can see, the high energy
weapon gets better penetration.  There is no plasma/fusion equivalent of a
HEAP or KEAP round.

The primary advantages of lasers and particle weapons isn\'t that they do
more damage at a given energy level, but that they can reach areas that a
slugthrower can\'t.  Both lasers and particle beams are speed-of-light
weapons with ranges extending to the millions of kilometers.  Both can be
scaled up to relatively high energies.  Slugthrowers increase energy by
increasing the bore size, which slows the rate of fire, and increases the
size of the ammunition.  The maximum energy that can be handled by any
slughthrower is on the order of 500MJ, and high-energy slugthrowers are much
larger and heavier than high-energy laser and particle weapons (for example,
a 150MJ laser can be mounted on a space fighter, while a 150MJ slughthrower
is a 12" naval cannon).

By TL-10, lasers are capable of 500MJ, and the maximum energy increases with
each TL.  The discharge energy of particle weapons is limited only by the
length of the installation.  Lasers have a higher rate of fire than particle
beams, but for both weapons, the rate of fire doesn\'t decrease as the energy
is increased.

However, at all but the highest TLs, the most efficient way to kill someone
(particularly someone nearby) is to use a slugthrower of some type.

> What is the correct formula or conversion for T4? 

I believe the warhead figures are substantially correct for T4.

You can\'t use the vehicles in EV with the weapons in EA.  The weapons in EA
were designed using Greg Porter\'s armor/damage scheme, where armor value is
proportional to the cube root of thickness.  I don\'t know the provenance of
all of the designs in EV, but I suspect that they are all \'FF&S2 compatible\'
though I doubt that they were actually designed in FF&S2.

This all goes back to an original decision made in T4, which was to have
different rating schemes for spacecraft, and non-spacecraft combat systems.
When extending the basic T4 armor and damage values to encompass everything
in the Traveller universe, Greg Porter and I chose different techniques to
perform the analysis (I chose a linear model, and Greg chose a cubic model).

Greg\'s system produces slightly better results at the low end of the scale,
where most of the stuff in CSC and EA (and most of the PCs equipment) are
located. The exponent in Greg\'s scale lumps most of the high end into a
pretty indistinguished clump at the high end of the scale.  The linear model
I used is (IMHO) a better overall compromise.

I believe that a conversion chart was posted to the TML a while back, that
will allow you to rate the vehicle armor under the EA system (or
alternatively, rate the weapons using the FF&S2 damage system).

 Well, I have the heretical view that the Imperium is not a particularly
welcome government (much like the Terran Imperium in the \'Flandry\' series).
The CruRons and BatRons drop in on the various worlds for \'liberty\' and to
remind them who has the biggest stick...  (There is nothing quite like the
expression of the SysDef admiral watching Tigress BatRon launch it\'s liberty
ships - in the same assault shuttles that would be used to drop the Marines if
it came to it...  ;)

The primary mission of the Navy is to keep the peace, and maintain the Empire.
No matter how many people they have to kill to do it.

But you do not need to compensate the whole 6 G !

At TL15, the crew could build card houses at maximum acceleration, because
the grav. compensators remove the effects of the 6 G acceleration within the
ship.

A fighter ship does not need to compensate it\'s entire acceleration. While
riding a rollercoaster you are sometimes affected by up to 2 G of
acceleration. A TL12 fighter pilot accelerating at 6 G would feel 3 G
acceleration, which is acceptable.

No one would be able to stand up inside passenger compartments and such, but=

The tech is still valuable, even more so on low-tech worlds. Imagine what
TL12 luxury items could buy you on a TL7 world for example. If you are going
to a world of even lower tech level, like 0 or 1, a few cigarette lighters
can do wonders, while costing you virtually nothing.

I have another question concerning money in Traveller:

Some items exist in different versions on different tech levels. These items
include ship\'s guns, weapons etc.

If someone wants to purchase an outdated item, how much would it cost ? The
price would no doubt be reduced, but how much ?

I\'m surprised that no-one has mentioned David Feintuch\'s "Hope" series.
Set in a very repressive future, it follows the amazing career of a single
Navy officer in a star navy very reminiscent of the Hornblower saga.  Nick
Seafort starts as a Midshipman who has to take command when all the
commissioned officers are killed.  He is a tormented soul, pursued by the
demons of his strict upbringing and holding himself to an impossible standard.

The first book is "Midshipman\'s Hope", and is highly recommended for the
Age of Sail fans among us.

OK.  I agree that,  if the Imperium was willing to pull out
all the stops and pay any price, they could relegate
piracy to a crime that occurs rarely and under special
circumstances.  My point has been that it is not clear
the they would find that price worth while (I am personally
am dubious they would).

In which case the pirates might find taking just the cargo
a better bet because they don\'t worry about having to
move a damaged or sabatoged ship and, more importantly,
they don\'t have to deal with the heat that such a heavy
loss would call down on them.

Emperor/Emperess

(Note: for clarity, I will only be using the male form of address for the rest
of this post.  This is for convienence only, not to imply any disregard for the
achievements of the female gender...  ;)

What do these people provide?  What exactly does the Imperium do, except provide
a military force?

This is kind of how I see it...

Emperor (the whole shebang)
        I
        I
ArchDuke (Administers a Sector or Domain)
        I
        I
Duke (Administers one or more Subsectors)
        I
        I
Baron (Administers a Cluster, System or a World)
        I
        I
Knight (Administers a World or Industrial Sector)

The knight serves as the first line of the Imperial Nobility.  Usually a award
for service to the Empire.  This accolade cannot be passed to your children,
though it is not uncommon, once a family has achieved this social level, for the
children of a knight to also be knighted (usually for a far less demanding
achievement that the original gift...)

Knights, when awarded a fiefdom along with their title, will assume
administrative control (and recieve payment from) a backwater world or an
industrial sector of a more prosperous world or system.  They are responsible to
a Baron who they will pledge fealty to.

Barons will administer worlds or systems, and in some cases clusters of
systems.  Baronies are hereditary fiefdoms, and will pass to the designated heir
upon confirmation by the SubSector Duke.  Children of a Baron will also receive
the honor of being addressed by the title, however, with the exception of the
designated heir, they will not be able to pass that title to their children.
Barons are responsible to a SubSector Duke, who they will pledge fealty to.  The
Baron administering the system is the nominal commander of the System Defense
Forces, and may call upon the resources of the system to man those forces,
within the guidelines set by their Duke.

*Note - Planetary defense forces are the responsibility of the member worlds,
Imperial Nobles may not interfere with the manning or deployment of those forces
except where:

1) Such manning interferes with the planet\'s responsibility to provide Imperial
forces.
2) Such deployment threatens Imperial assets or interests.
3) Other cases, as defined by Imperial Law.

Certain individuals are granted the title of Baron for deeds for the glory of,
or in defense of, the Empire.  If no fiefdom is granted, then this is an
honorary title, and is not hereditary.

Dukes administer one or more SubSectors.  This is a hereditary position, and is
passed to the designated heir upon confirmation of the ArchDuke.  Dukes are
responsible to the ArchDuke, who they pledge fealty to.  Dukes are the nominal
commanders of the SubSector military forces and may call upon their vassals for
personnel to man those forces, within the guidelines set by his Arch-Duke.
Dukes are responsible to:

1) Maintain the Imperial Presence in their Sector.
2) Provide such forces as the member planets request for the safety and welfare
of the Imperium.
3) This is the lowest level of nobility that can authorize the interference with
Planetary governments.  Such interference requires a review by the Archduke.

ArchDukes administer Sectors or Domains.  These positions are appointed by the
Emperor/Emperess and are subject to his/her pleasure.  ArchDukes are responsible
to the Emperor/Emperess, who they pledge fealty to.  Archdukes are the nominal
commanders of all Imperial forces in their domain.


The focal point of any Imperial presence in a system will be on the mainworld.
The "Imperial Building" will be placed in the highport, if it exists, or else in
the downport.  All Imperial government offices will be located here, as will any
diplomatic missions an individual world has assigned to it.  Access to this
building will be controlled by Imperial Marines.  Any military presence, with
the exception of recruiting and public affairs, will be in a separate structure.

The primary purpose of the Knights and Barons are to promote their charges to
the Sector in general.  Since they recieve a fraction of the trade that passes
through thier area of administration, it is also in thier best interests to
increase the viability of their charges.  The Dukes and the Archdukes look to
maintain the peace, and the integrity of the Empire.

Fealty is always (with the exception of Oaths to the  Emperor) sworn to the
office, not to the person filling it.  There are provisions for personal oaths,
but they are not part of the office.  Fealty flows upward from one level to the
next, never through the same level.  (i.e. even if there are two barons
administering a system, neither will swear to each other, only to the Duke above
them.)

This is all I\'ve really developed so far.  Comments?  Suggestions?

be, can have a lot of interesting inspirations for Traveller 
stuff in it... for those who are near a library, check out the October
issue of Spectrum. 

People who are bigger NMR/MRI experts than I should feel free
to correct me if I get anything wrong.

A short background on NMR:

Essentially,  when protons (hydrogen nuclei) are placed in a strong
magnetic field, they "precess", much like a gyroscope precesses in a
gravitational field. If you\'ve never seen a gyroscope precess,
essentially what happens is that the axis of rotation of the gyroscope
rotates in such a way that the axis of rotation sweeps out a cone. If
you\'ve ever seen a top wobble about its axis of rotation, you\'ve seen
precession. (If you\'ve ever sat through university undergrad physics,
you\'ve probably seen a mathematical/physical explanation of why
precession occurs, but, if you\'re like me, you were asleep).

When an oscillating magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the
static field (which is causing the precession), the protons will begin
to precess about the axis of the oscillating field as well as the axis
of the static field. The oscillation of the protons about the new axis
excites a voltage in an RF coil, which can then be picked up,
demodulated and turned into really amazing images of anything that
contains a lot of hydrogen. In the case of humans, this means
water-bearing stuff, soft tissue.

(If you want the whole 9 yards, read the sidebar on pgs. 52-53 of
Spectrum. Be warned that reading Spectrum kinda assumes you have an
electrical engineering degree, so they kinda skip over bits of stuff,
like how a changing EM field can induce another field, which can, in
turn, induce a field in the object that generated the first field. But I
digress)

MIS - Medical Imaging System/Scanner

A standard fixture in any starship medical lab or sickbay is the MIS -
the Medical Imaging Scanner.

MIS systems are initially developed around TL 6, however they are too
bulky and fragile to be mobile and are only found in fixed
installations. By TL 9 or so they are suitably rugged to be used in
mobile applications. In terms of functionality, most starship based
units lag fixed units by about 1 TL and field units (sometimes even
man-portable) lag by about 2 TLs.

At TL 6, very early MIS systems used high-frequency radiation to
penetrate human tissue and leave images on photo-sensitive plates. The
drawbacks to this technique are that only high-density features are
accurately images (bones and foreign objects) and the rather unplesant
side effects that high-energy radiation has on the human body.
(Essentially, early MIS systems are X-Ray machines).

Around TL 8, the next major stage of development is two-fold: the
development of MRI and the integration of computerized signal
processing.

MRI exploits the properties of NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) to make
accurate images of water-bearing tissue. This is a major step up from
X-rays, as the technique doesn\'t involve exposing the patient to
radiation and as it gives an excellent view of organs, blood vessels,
etc.

Computerized signal processing is essential to NMR-based techniques, as
they don\'t have any sort of analogy to x-ray "film". Computer
techniques, used in conjunction with X-rays or NMR, also give the
ability to take multiple "slices" and recombine them into a three
dimensional model of the patient.

Early NMR based units (TL 8) require large magnetic fields, often in the
range of 5-18 teslas. These early units require the use of huge magnets
that very often enclose the entire patient (These units amy be as large
as 5 Td!). Higher TL units (TL 9+) often use smaller fields and, by
extension, have smaller field generation units. (Less than 1 Td).

At higher TLs, low-power x-rays are combined with NMR techniques to
yield images of soft & hard tissue, in three dimensions, often in
real-time. AT very high TLs, NMR techniques can be used to induce soft
tissue changes in the patient, which can be used in a variety of
non-invasive surgical techniques. Advances in field generation and
detection also lead to units shrinking as higher TLs, to the point where
around TL 13, you have units about the size of a large camcorder that
can give cross-sections of a typical human arm or leg.

Other technology related to the NMR scanners used in the MIS includes
NMR wide-band spectroscopy, which uses a variant NMR technique to
analyze chemical samples as small as 20 nL (20 nano-liters). This is
essentially standard spectroscopy, where you\'re trying to figure out
what something is made of, but unlike standard spectrometers, you can
get away with really, really small samples.

Anyway, if you need to describe a sick bay/medical lab this might be
good for some "colour". (If you need to add some colour to a
semiconductor cip fabrication plant in Traveller, you might want to look
at "Finding fault with deep-submicros ICs" in the same issue, but then
again, maybe you\'ll just leave the chip fab out of the adventure... :) )

MD/CPR guns are *way* better than plasma/fusion/PAW weapons. In FFS1 lasers
got a bonus on penetrating armour and hence were comparable...now that
that\'s gone, CPR/MD guns dominate over everything. As Wildstar says, 
laser weapons have various operational advantages...but not enough to
overcome the big advantage CPR guns have for non-space aps; and plasma/fusion
weapons aren\'t even in the running. As printed, FFS2 causes CPR/MD guns to
be the dominant vehicle weapon at all tech levels, which (in my opinion)
needs to be fixed. (The root of the problem is that for large CPR/MD guns
the penetration is linear with energy while for *EVERY* other weapon it\'s
square root (energy.) 

Try designing some tanks if you don\'t belive me.

I\'ve always had an exchange bank at the starport that will give you the current
market value (cross-index the starport/TL chart).  If you trade out in town, you
get a substantially worse rate (depending on the person you are dealing with, how
important it is, and your sobriety - just like the good \'ol days in the PI!)

Physical money (the credit), Paper letters of credit or bearer bonds, electronic
forms of transfer (I have a special computer installed on each starship that is
effectively tamperproof.  The one time it was tried, they wiped the bank and
killed it dead...several 100Ks of credit were lost - they haven\'t messed with one
since.)

Fad items (like gigapets or pet rocks), Hand crafts (like furniture), Unique items (woods, wines, foods, etc), specialty items (just how many worlds do you think produce sub-orbital pogo sticks or armored prams?), cultural/religious items,  etc...

don\'t have any data on the actual mass of the Boys Mk1 antitank rifle that
I modelled this after, I have no idea how accurate the recoil numbers are.
IMHO, 28.5 kg strikes me as being a wee bit heavy.  As I\'ve mentioned
before, I think that the reciever length formula in FF&S2 is a wee bit off,
and ought to have a cap based on round power or reciever type or something.
As it happens, according to FF&S 1 a bolt-action reciever for this rifle
should be 85 cm long.  This of course throws the mass off and hence the
recoil.

	Any comments from the more firearms-savvy list members?  If
somebody knows how much the Boys weighed it\'d be just fantastic; I could
then get a better value for the recoil.

Well, this is _not_ agreed on.  For B to invalidate A it not only
has to be "possible" to stamp out piracy (or at least make
it a rare crime in special sitatuations, it is generally
impossible to _completely_ stamp out a crime) but it
has to low enough cost the Imperium would clearly choose
to do it.  (otherwise, you have to invoke assumptions about
how the Imperium would treat piracy, which makes the execise
not one of "invalidating" piracy but just putting forward
one possible interpretation in which it doesn\'t exist).

It maybe that you are presenting a "what if theories that
piracy can\'t exist are right" quesition.  However, it
needs to be noted that this is only relevant to those who
do think those theories are right.

Interesting post.  Funny thing about oaths.  Traditionally, oths are
personal oths.  These are the only ones that make much sense.  (Even the
Whermacht made a personal oath of allegiance to Hitler).  In the UK and most
commonwealth armed forces you take a personal oath. The reason behind this
is presumably that all institutions require to have their requirements
interpreted.  An oath to say serve and protect the Democratic Republic of
Kafiristan means nothing unless you know who speaks for it and decides what
ought to be done.  One solution is to presume it is simply lawful commands
(as laid down by that institution) that need to be obeyed, the difficulty
usually only arise when there is some disputes as to whrere the division of
powrers (if such is present) lies, or where parts of the institution are t
loggerheads.  There are less (note not no) problems with personal oths,
tytpically of the form, I XXX swear to serve YYYY [and sometimes also her
heirs and succssors], until such time as I be lawfully discharged (or
similar such).  If you want to know what is to be done, you can ask them.

Funnily, fealty (the obligation of fidelity on the part of a feudal tennant
or vassal to his Lord, or the recognition of this obligation) is not usually
one sided.  Such arrangements within medieval europe, between suzereign
(sometimes also sovereign) and vassal normally stipulated protection in
return for service, or similar such, made before large numbers of
witnessses, (especually important before litercy became widespread amongst
the nobility).  It is interesting to see to what degree the imperium carries
on these traditions.

Yep, but that was just one of the books, and it was just one movie. If it\'s
done like the Sharpe books it will be a whole series of shows, a
mini-series if you will, and might be several of the books as well.

Page:373 Infantry Antitank Weapons

The British army began World War II equipped with an antitank
rifle dating from 1934. This was the Boys, which had beenknow
as the Stanchion, but received the name of one of the development
team who died before it was completed.
The Boys rifle weighed 36 pounds and projected a .55-inch solid-shot bullet
at 3250fps. This could pernetrate 25mm of armor at 500 yards.
The weaopn was both heavy and unpleasant to fire-recoil was severe.
Boys rifle was fed from a top-mounted fiveround box magazine.


Hello,

I used this setup above for a TNE Anti-Personal/Anti-Equipment
Sniper rifle.

Come to find out The pary would only use it for bording actions

That\'s true, but is a Weber ton equal to a Traveller ton?  ;-> Even if they

larger than Traveller ships.

Re: the Boys Anti-Tank Rifle
 
Having fired one several times earlier this summer, what I can tell you is that it is a heavy SOB.  _Military_Firearms_of_the_20th_C._, 4th Ed. reports that the Boys weighs 36 lb./16 kg. unloaded, so 28 kg. is, indeed, way off.
 
Lots of fun to fire, though.  Especially when lying prone, looking downrange towards a Wisconsin hillside of scrub pine and tall grass, trying to imagine a Pzkw. I or II getting ventilated (hopefully) every time I fired.

I run my games in a universe of single system and small multi-system
governments.  If you want to travel to a nearby system that doesn\'t accept
your currency you have three options:

1. You can arrange for currency exchange either before you go or at your
destination.  There is going to be a fee for the exchange and rates are
going to bounce around.  You\'ll also have the problem of hauling the cash
around with you...trey dangerous! 

2. You can arrange for a "Bank Letter of Credit" through one of your local
banks.  You present your letter to a subscribing bank at your destination
and it extends you credit in a local account and passes a charge back to
the originating bank.  These banks balance accounts between themselves by
whatever exchanges of value they negotiate.  There is, of course, a small
handling fee, but it is safer and more convienent than hauling cash around. 
If a player handles it this way, she\'ll have to keep making arrangements
with banks as she travels from one financial jurisdiction to another,
because not all banks will deal with all other banks.  OTOH, it also gives
small armed traders something to haul around...legal documents going back
to calling banks.

3.  You can buy high value transportables with your cash and sell them for
local cash at your destination.  High value transportables would normally
be gems (jewel quality diamonds, opals, emeralds, starstones, fire-eyes) or
precious metals (gold, platinum, gold pressed latnium <joke>).  Of course,
you\'ll have to hope that your "high value" item is "high value" where
you\'re going.

Most of the players in my AKUS MOBY pbem are on this list, so here\'s a
reminder, if you don\'t transfer your CSA credits and/or make arrangments
with your banks before you get to the Mark system you\'ll be effectively
broke no matter what your bank balance says.  Some of you have made
arrangements, but some of you haven\'t even thought about it yet...;->

It\'s the angst, Doug.  There\'s only soooo much self-doubt and torment I can
take.  Why can\'t the poor guy either get a break, a life, or a clue!  Why
can\'t Feintuch give his protagonist a break.... ;->  Weber\'s Harrington has

me nearly as much as Seaford\'s.

I\'ll eventually read the rest of the books, but they\'ll come from a used

Yes, I do recommend it too. Even if the angst made me squirm the book was
worth reading.

If they can spare the time, the easiest entry is to use a combo of a
personal re-entry kit and some fast drug. You dump the guy into a
trajectory that\'ll look like a natural meteoroid. The fast drug makes
the wait tolerable (or is it slow drug I want, I keep getting them
confused). When he gets close enough to the planet, an antidote for the
drug is administered so that he\'ll be at normal speed for re-entry. 

He\'ll have the radar return of a rock that isn\'t worth worrying about.
And one way of unobtrusively dumping him is to come out of jump
and either start drifting immediately, or have M-drive failure after
you get the right vector. You can blame it on the "bargain" the
engineer got on some parts. :-)

You use the ship to mask the launch of the re-entry pod. It won\'t need
much thrust, so it should be fairly easy to screen the small rocket
from the planetary sensors. Especially for a TL7-8 world.

Nope. Those parts of SDI get funding *because* there are still folks

Hello,

BTW, does anyone know how big the differences were between
Striker I and II? Did II have a design sequence, or use MT?

Well, this is _not_ agreed on.  For B to invalidate A it not only
has to be "possible" to stamp out piracy (or at least make
it a rare crime in special sitatuations, it is generally
impossible to _completely_ stamp out a crime) but it
has to low enough cost the Imperium would clearly choose
to do it.  (otherwise, you have to invoke assumptions about
how the Imperium would treat piracy, which makes the execise
not one of "invalidating" piracy but just putting forward
one possible interpretation in which it doesn\'t exist).

It maybe that you are presenting a "what if theories that
piracy can\'t exist are right" quesition.  However, it
needs to be noted that this is only relevant to those who
do think those theories are right.

I am not conceding the debate.  I am, however, conceding that we have 
hammered on this thread for a month now, and the  principles who started 
the debate have not shifted position appreciably.  It is time to shift the 
view to how it can be played, rather than whether or not it should be.

As I said, I think we all agree that piracy is canon.  I think we all agree 
that it adds flavor to the game.  Let\'s shift our energy from battling each 
other (albeit it is fun) to making creating the environment necessary to 
enjoy this facet of the game.  If we put half the energy into that process, 
I think we will be able to resolve the issue to everyone\'s satisfaction!

For the purposes of the THUDDD, this has already been clearly decided; see
the THUDDD website for details.  In short, FFS2 establishes canon for
THUDDD purposes; other design systems may be used only to the extent they
agree with FFS2.  As FFS2 does not allow g-comp stacking, neither is it
permitted in THUDDD entries.

Now, realize that today\'s fighter pilots pull 3Gs routinely, which is what
you\'d feel at 6Gs with 3 compensated.  Of course, they do this for only
very short intervals, as opposed to space fighters which might be called
upon to accelerate longer.  In short, I\'m leaving the answer to this
dilemma up to the THUDDD designers, and then the judges:  How much
acceleration can/should a TL-12 fighter have, in the absence of g-comp
stacking?

By the way, another note:  As fighters tend to be dense, be sure to run
mass-based acceleration calculations for your designs, not just
volume-based.

Those who want smaller J-drives go ahead and use them but be warned that
they might wreac havoc on the underlying assumtions about the Imperium.
As FF&S2 went back to the old 10% x Jn fuel requirements for jumps perhaps
we could add this arbitrary rule:
Jump fuel requirements are: 10% x Jn but always at least 10dTon x Jn.
This allows you the ability to make smaller jumpships but at a MUCH higher
cost in fuel percentage.

                        The Ophiuchi Hotline (coll.)

James Tiptree, Jr. (pseudonym of Alice Sheldon). Best known for her short
stories, collected in Warm Worlds and Otherwise; 10,000 Light Years from
Home; Her Smoke Rose Up Forever; and others. "Houston, Houston, Do You
Read" is an absolute must-read. "The Screwfly Solution" (written as
\'Racoona Sheldon\') is without a doubt the scariest story I\'ve ever read.
"I\'ll Be Waiting for You When the Swimming Pool is Empty" is one of the
funniest.

Fredrick Pohl   - Gateway; Beyond the Blue Event Horizon; Heechee Rendezvous...
        Unfortunately, the Heechee books go downhill quickly. But Gateway
must be one of the top ten best SF novels of all time.

Samuel R. Delany  - Nova; Triton; Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand;
                        Babel-17

Bruce Sterling  - Schismatrix; Islands in the Net; Heavy Weather; Holy Fire;
                        Crystal Express (coll); Globalhead (coll);
                        Involution Ocean; The Artificial Kid

Gwynneth Jones  - White Queen;
        A challenging but astonishing book about mis-communication between
humans and humanoid alien visitors; written like a very good mainstream
novel that has somehow fallen backwards in time from the mid-21st Century.
The author explains very little, forcing the reader to figure out much of
the background from dropped hints and tantalizingly vague references. Not
an easy read, but well worth it. Confounds expectations at every turn.

Geoff Ryman     - The Child Garden
        Beautifully written, hilarious, bizarre, brilliant, powerful,
unique... I run out superlatives for this thing. A tragic lesbian love
story between a misfit actress and a geneered human polar bear/opera
singer(!). Nobody reads any more, but everyone is hyper-educated thanks to
geneered viruses that transfer knowledge into the brain. Ryman is so
wildly, endlessly inventive that I can easily ignore the occasionally wonky
science. (Especially recommended for fans of Dante\'s Divine Comedy, which
provides a thematic template.)

Neal Stephenson - Snow Crash; Zodiac; The Diamond Age

Jack McDevitt   - The Hercules Text
        The best \'first-radio-Contact\' novel ever written.

George Alec Effinger - When Gravity Fails; A Fire in the Sun; The Exile Kiss
        Was there another Marid Audran novel after Exile Kiss? I thought
these books just kept getting better and better. Effinger insistently put
his character through unexpected changes, and admirably avoided falling
into any Detective or Science Fiction formula.

Jack Womack     - Heathern; Ambient; Terraplane; Elvissey; 
                        Random Acts of Senseless Violence;
        Fans who feel that the writer\'s style should be \'invisible\' will
hate this stuff. Social satire written in a dense futuristic argot, with an
acidic sense of irony and vast amounts of, yes, senseless violence.
Cyberpunk without any of the \'cyber\'.

So that\'s my list - in addition to lots of other names that have already
been mentioned, especially Bear and Brunner.

Striker II was beased (I think) upon the Command system from GDW with no
design system and a definite WWII feel to the rules. Gone were the order
giving system that gave Striker its unique RPG flavor. The feeling I got
from Striker II was that it was done by somebody not very familiar with
Traveller but that was the feel I got from all TNE stuff.

	Basically, the Boys, according to FF&S2, should have a recoil of
6.38.  Those of you who\'ve fired it; how bad was the recoil?  On a scale of
1 to 10; 1 being your 93-year-old grandma could run around firing it all
day, 10 being Ahnold could fire it once and would run whimpering straight
to his masseur.

	Interestingly, not only does the FF&S2 reciever length seem a
little off, but if the Boys had a 36-inch barrel, then the barrel length is
off by approximately 20% too, with a corresponding effect on weight.

This is a good thing - of such ideas are roleplaying plots made.

A related question is:

       "Why doesn\'t the pirate crew just sell off their own ship
        and retire on the profits?"

It can\'t be the bank payments, because if the pirates can\'t skip their
payments and sell off their ship then how could they find a market for
stuff that they steal?

But then where does the pirate ship come from?

Borrowing 30-300MCr from any bank wanting to stay in business is going to
require good security and a sound business plan - so what is the business
plan of a pirate?

#1
Well you could find the ship dead in space - but this is just salvage
rights and 5% or 10% of the ship\'s value is lots. In any case, unless
it landed with alomst no damage, you need a ship to salvage the ship...

#2
Maybe some "organisations" specialise in this sort of loan - supplying
a ship for a cut of the profits. In this country (UK) the large breweries
tend to provide the loans to lease pubs in exchange for tying the landlord
into a contract on beer and other supplies.

These organisations might also provide other services such as no questions
asked damage repair and cargo handling, guaranteeing to return at least
5% of cargo value to the pirate. They would also give the pirate an area
of operations with no competition, but be unhappy to find one of their
ships out of area (after all someone might be trying to steal it :)

(A chance to have a follow up mission to the PCs defeat the pirates and
capture their ship scenario :)

#3
It seems to be agreed that the question is "independant" pirates, so
I\'ll ignore ships from a rival Navy or Megacorp.

#4
Maybe the ship was owned by the Navy or a Megacorp. and the crew has
resigned or an independant trader who has skipped bank payments.
Since it can\'t be sold in the area they are heading out of the empire.
On the way they are looking for parts or wanting to change ships to
avoid discovery (eg "swap" ships with a trader, call for help and then
thank the SDB when they destroy the "pirate" and the evidence).

#5
Pirate or customs inspection?
A mercenary cruiser or a couple of armed merchants could easily be at a
planet with a merc team for a (planetary) government backed mission.

Part of the mission could include trade inspections. If the ship has the
correct paperwork to prove that it is acting on behalf of the recognised
government then even an complete batron of Tigresses might not have the
jurisdiction to interceed (although they might encourage PC compliance:)

If the world is low tech or balkanised, the true position of the "pirate"
might not be clear...

the hit point style of damage (ie as you take damage,

your ship goes bang).

Also the weapon ranges would be too short and finally,

Remember the Graphics of the dutch drafter Maurits Cornelis Escher?
The twisted "Belvedere" is a classic example of a building that cannot be 
built in three dimensions. Looking at this Graphic is quite fascinating, 
but does it drive you crazy? It didn\'t so to me (I do hope that), and I 
got this one as a jigsaw puzzle in 1000 pieces!

So, even if one could see a fourdimensional thing (or its 3D shadow), for 
me that would not be enough to become insane.

Else, why would anyone risk travel through JSpace for a total week, if 
there is this chance of getting mental dislocated?

Not naval and industrial capacity taken out of contest, but that capacity
compared to the share thereof canonically used on the navy and the size of
the navy compared to the number of places you\'d need to guard in order to
make piracy very difficult.

Exactly. And if it only takes a tiny percentage of the active fleet to
safeguard all the necessary places, I submit that such is the case. You
may argue that _all_ the active ships of the regular, colonial, and
planetary fleets would be needed to sit around the high-population
worlds looking menacing, instead of just 99.8% of them, but this is just
as clearly contrary to previously published material. Not only are there
examples of ship designs that are of practically no value in a general
fleet engagement and are described as being used for escort duties, police
operations, patrol duties, and even anti-piracy operations (check
_Fighting Ships_ for specific examples) and of ships specifically
designed for anti-piracy activity (_Sydkai_ Class Cruisers in MTJ#3 for
example), but there are also mentions of cruisers and even battleships
being routinely deployed singly instead of in squadrons during peacetime
(In wartime the BatRons are deployed as units).

>(otherwise, you have to invoke assumptions about
>how the Imperium would treat piracy,

We know how the Imperium treats piracy. They patrol against pirates and even
employ strike forces to replace governments that are found to support them.
The discrepancy lies in how many ships they ought to have have available
to do the job vs. how few ships they would have to be using in order _Not_
to make piracy almost impossible.

This is, IMO, the reason that the TML is the coolest mailing list 
around. You ask a question about astronomy and the astronomers pop
up. You ask a question about sensors and the IR astronomer pops
up and says "Well, I ran some simulations...". You ask about a 
wonking huge anti-tank rifle and someone\'s fired it. You ask about
real-world military vehicles, someone\'s usually driven one. Hey, you
can even get answers about Quebec civil law. ;)

OK. Say they have a total production equal to Cr10,000/citizen per year,
or MCr20,000,000. Let\'s give them a military budget of 3%, standard
peacetime spending according to _Striker_. Total: MCr600,000. Of this
figure 30% goes to the interstellar state of which the world is a
member. We would be justified in assumingh that quite a few of the
ships bought for that money would be stationed in the system, but let\'s
ignore that for the moment. Ther remains MCr420,000. Since the mainworld
is similar to Old Earth, (ie. has a breathable atmosphere), 40% of that
goes to support an army. There remains MCr252,000. Using TCS\'s figure of
10% of purchase price to support a ship, this can support MCr2,520,000
of ships. If you have eight ships laid up in ordinary for each ship you
keep active in peacetime, you\'d have an active fleet worth MCr1,386,000.

I think the bulk of the planetary navy would be cruiser-sized SDBs, with
a smattering of smaller ships. But that\'s just an unsupported opinion.

Well, any ship that isn\'t close to a warship can thumb its nose at
regulations _provided_ it isn\'t using its regular transponder code
and is able to disguise itself.

Depends on just what rules you use. The ones I prefer are the MT ones
that makes it too hazardous to get insurance inside the 100 diameter,
but not really desperate until you get inside 10 diameters. Note,
however, that any rule that helps a pirate get away from a warship
will help a merchant get away from a pirate, and any rule that helps
a warship catch a pirate will help the pirate catch a merchant.

The problem with that is that pirate ships costs a hell of a lot too,
and if they only get a cargo once in a blue moon, they won\'t be able
to make a profit. 

>and, more importantly, they don\'t have to deal with the heat that such

The problems with that notion is that what is bad for pirates as a class
is good for the individual pirate. Assuming for purposes of argument that
he has managed to capture a ship intact, the ship is so much more valuable
than the cargo, even if we assume rock-bottom fencing prices, that he
would be crazy to leave it behind just to avoid increasing the odds
against him at a later date. A ship can easily represent 10-20 cargoes
(assuming cargoes can be sold for their full value, a very iffy assumption
to begin with), so why not take the ship and retire and let the other
pirates worry about the reaction?

   What about the earlier Marks, like good old "Markee" down in San Gabriel?
 Ought to be easy for Bill G to work out the software, as Markee was pretty
dumb.  And if we got a little bit away from the operator independant sent up,
the Third Imperium should be able to field at least a Mark XXIV.  The
Glorious Mk XXX  may be a little much, But then I was always a favorite of
Bolos of the Line 375-RML and 278-DAK myself.

Ever fly anywhere?  Why did you get into a fragile metal tube with
thousands of moving parts and trust a trick of physics to keep you from
returning to Earth at several hundred miles per hour?  Because it\'s
convenient.  When in Jumpspace, just turn off the exterior views and put up

>[nice article on NMR and traveller-style description of NMR imaging]

It\'s interesting to try and think of some other medical imaging technologies
that might come into play at high tech levels. Possibly damper-style 
manipulation of the strong force could be used for a nuclear scanner - 
either to induce mild radioactivity in specific normally-stable isotopes 
to locate them in the body (like a PET scanner, which uses positron-emitting
decay in some radioisotope who\'s name escapes me, but without the requirement
for injecting the positron-emitter) or through resonances in the strong force
itself (conservation of energy implies that how much power damping/augmenting
the nuclear force requies is a function of what material is used...) 

Then there are neural activity scanners, which are currently pretty
ill-defined; and maybe there would be a roll for grav scanners in medical
applications, if they\'re precise enough, to chart out interior density/
composition.

There are many, many visual events which can affect the human nervous
system.  Lights flashing at just the right rythym causing epileptic
seizures are a good example.  The unusual nature of J-space could easily be
said to do something even more drastic.  Remember: it isn\'t real.  J-Space
doesn\'t exist, so trying to force it to obey the laws of the REAL universe
makes no sense.  Have fun with it.

That makes some sense.  The straight Imperial military forces (Army, Navy,
Marines) should  come to less than 10%.  However the Scout service really has no
analogy IRL.  Further, if you consider that part of their duties are in locating
exploitable resources - they may actually recoup part or all of their operating
expenses.

So perhaps we can shift the numbers from 50% of the population finding careers
outside of the basic 6 (my original supposition) and bump it up to 80%.  That
puts military draft at about 50% of what is left, or 10%.  Since some of those
people will be co-opted by Planetary, System and Subsector forces, that leaves
the percentage going to Imperial service at far less than 10%.

Actually, there has only been a bit of argument on how much money the Imperium
has to spend.  (Although, it has been kinda neat to count it...  1..2..3.. wow!
:)  There has been a great big argument on how the money is spent.

O.K.  We know that you believe (from canon sources) that the Imperium can stamp
out piracy.  There is disagreement about that, but that is not what I am hoping
to achieve with this thread.

What would need to change to make piracy at the frontier a hazardous, but
potentially profitable, undertaking?  How would you set up a successful pirate?

Obviously some factors need to be taken into consideration.

Motivation - how to motivate the captain and crew to repeatedly raid shipping.
Security - Up to a point, risk can be dealt with.  Certain death will not be.
Facilities - the ship will need someplace to go to.  A free port?  A port
official that would be willing to look the other way for a sufficient donation?

To recap the purpose of _this_ thread:  To make it possible for a GM to
logically include piracy in a campaign.  To help determine the factors that need
to be modified or explained from canon sources, preferably without changing the
overall structure provided by Traveller.

My sense of it, having fired five rounds (one complete magazine), was that it was difficult, BUT, the hydropneumatic recoil cylinder and the monopod helped stabilize it.  Certainly the padding on the buttface was insufficient (but my shoulder appreciated it).
 
Hmmmm....I suspect that 6.38 is about right.  And it shot a little to the right at 200 yards, too. :)  (That is, until Col. Castonguay had it properly sighted in).
 
For anybody wondering, my opportunity to fire the Boys came about because my friend Col. Castonguay is a gunsmith, and has been methodically collecting smallarms used in the Russo-Finnish War (\'39-\'40), and the Continuation War (\'41-\'45).  Nothing automatic, but lots of other stuff.

I remember this rule from CT, also, but don\'t remember any specific reasoning
(if any was even given).  HOWEVER, my thought would be that take a 100 ton
ship, fill it with the required jump drive space, maneuver drive (probably,
even if only 1G), and fuel to accomodate both, and there wouldn\'t be enough
room left to keep a person or more likely a team of people comfortable for a
week straight, especially if it happened regularly. (I won\'t jump to the
"dementia" thread on watching jump space for a week...)

That would allow these jump message torps, since there\'d be no people
involved and you could pack systems in to the limit.  It also corresponds
nicely with the transition that heppens from "comfy seats" for a couple day
interplanetary trip to "cabins or low berths required" for any interstellar
trip.  

This makes sense to me simply when I imagine the difficulty of trying to sit
and work in cramped quarters for any real length of time, even though it be
with friends.  Certainly it HAS been done by many men and women astronauts
from a variety of nations, but I bet most people wouldn\'t find the actual
conditions all that appealling.

I think there will be two, possibly three classes of Knights. If a Knight
is awarded a fiefdom, then almost certainly the title (and the fief) would
be hereditary, if not the advancement to the noble class is severely
restricted, and there will be unrest. 

There will be \'Honor\' nobles, much like knights in the UK
today, awarded non-inheritable titles for their lifetimes, with no fiefdom
attached. These are what you\'re describing.

Thirdly (as I recall form Traveller canon) there\'s a third class of
nobles, the so-called \'administrative\' nobles, typically civil servants
given the rank of knight to fit them into the command structure. These
titles last for the duration of their careers. They may be awarded an
honor patent when they retire, or there may be some title like \'Knight
Administrative, (ret)\' that they get to keep.

How about doing a Model 5 (the \'Jungle Carbine\').  I\'d like to see the
recoil numbers for that.  I already know what it feels like.  Of course,
that buttpad I have on there is just to place it well for aiming,
nothing to do with recoil ;-).  I\'ll get the measurement if you need
them.

I\'ve always liked to use some of these plot devices:1) Ship supplied by a
*unnamed* corporation - they wish the PCs to prey on one of their competitors
[either a direct competitor in shipping, or the shipping lines supplying their
competitor], but not so exclusively that the finger points at them.  Another
ploy is to make using free traders unreliable enough to shift some more trade to
the major shipping lines.
2) An *unnamed* stellar government supplies the ship and a list of planets to
hit - purpose is to draw off system coverage from a planet (not on the list) so
that some covert insertion can be made (this is unknown to the PCs).
3) PC is a noble with some rather large debts to clear - or his family will lose
their home and their titles.
4) PC is scion of a merchant house desparate for money to support it\'s
operations (just until the economy turns around).
5) PC is a member of a rebellious anti-Imperial element on a planet - ship is a
way to supply money for their cause and strike against the Imperium.

This is simple and elegant, but allows \'jump torpedos\' to get around it
by using drop tanks, assuming you allow them ;-).  I wasn\'t here when
this was previously (as I\'m sure it was) beaten into the ground, but I\'d
like to throw out a potentially useful handwave  on the topic.  It\'s
turned out a little longer than I hoped, but hopefully it\'ll be useful. 
Criticism welcome.


[STARSHIP MINIMUM SIZE LIMITATIONS]
Although the phenomena known as \'Jump\' is still imperfectly understood
by Imperium scientists, certain limitations of it\'s application have
been determined.  One of these is the minimum size of a ship which can
be reliably sent through jump.

It appears that the jump space envelope surrounding a ship requires a
minimum amount of mass (or volume of material? [ed]) to \'anchor\' itself
to in order to be stable.  This size is on the order of 100 displacement
ton, and is the reason for the commonly accepted minimum size for
starships.  The stability of the envelope deteriorates rapidly as the
size of the ship decreases.  It has been theorized that the minimum size
is necessary to overcome the mass effects of interstellar dust on the
jump fields.  The cost of performing a statistically significant number
of experiments has, to date, precluded testing of this hypothesis.

Reports from survivors of experiments with smaller jump-capable ships
indicate that, over time, instabilities develop in the jump envelope. 
These instabilities appear to increase in magnitude in an oscilliatory
nature with time, resulting in the jump envelope intersecting with and
destroying parts of the vessel.  Substantial psychic disturbances have
also been noted among survivors.

[Game Application]
I envisioned the chance of misjump going up as the square of
(100-size).  This has the advantage of making the risk comensurate with
the relative advantage.  I came up with three potential ways of
incorporating it, each a little farther from strictly following this
relationship.  

For simplicity, I define a Size Defficiency number (SD) of (100-size)/10
[rounded up], with size in displacement tons.  So, for a ship of 90-99
dt, SD=1 and for a ship of 40-49 dt, SD=6.

1) This scheme requires a size misjump roll independant of the standard
misjump roll.  This is a percentage roll, where the percentage chance of
misjump is SD squared.  Thus, a 45 td ship (SD=6) always has a 36%
chance of misjumping, independant of drive/maintanence/fuel factors.

2) The second scheme roughly converts the above percentages into a 2D6
roll as a modifier to the standard misjump roll.  This assumes a base
zero chance of misjump.  While non-canon, it makes life a little easier
for me. 
If the ship\'s size is less that the value in the left hand column, the
value in the right hand column is added to the misjump DM (making
misjump more likely). Note that these are _not_ cumulative.
SIZE 	DM
- ----	--
100-	 1
 83-	 2
 71-	 3
 59-	 4
 47-	 5
 35-	 6
 24-	 7
 15- 	 8
  9-	 9
  4-	10
  2-	11

3) This is the simplest, and the one I\'ll probably use.  I simply use
the SD defined above as a DM on the misjump roll.  It\'s close enough for
all practical purposes, and makes life easier.

Interestingly, it was also procured by the USMC for their Raider
battalions when they were first formed during WWII.  On at least one
occasion, it was used to shoot down a Japanese float plane which was
attempting to resupply a garrison.

Just a bit of random trivia I ran across a few weeks ago.

American tradition is a bit different.  
[Approximate quote] \'I swear (or affirm) to uphold and defend the
Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and
domestic, to bear true faith and allegiance to the same, and to obey the
orders of the President of the United States and the officers appointed
over me.\'  Followed by yada yada about taking this obligation under free
will with no coercion blah blah blah.  This is the enlistment oath.  I
think the officers\' is basically the same, but leaves out the bit about
\'officers appointed over me\'.

I\'m not an expert on it, but I suspect the whole oath to a person thing
was dropped in favor of an oath to an ideal, or the institutional
representation of that ideal (the constitution). The whole theory of
co-government of equals by equals makes it difficult to support the idea
of an oath of fealty to an individual.

As far as Travller is concerned, I suspect that the British model is
much closer.  It seems to me that ties to persons can cross ideological
boundaries that institutions would find prohibitive.

Hello,
  CT players can also get about the same effect by requiring small
craft with Jump to have a Starship-type bridge - which means a minimum
of 20 Dt bridge. That really ups the minimum size. Or you can fiddle
LHyd requirements as (Dt)[root(Dt/100)], or ~3Dt at 10Dt.

stability threshold at TL16; Jump drives at TL15 or lower become unstable
at less than 100dt, while at TL16+ they become unstable at less than 10dt.
At least then there was some reason for all of the excitement and
hullabaloo over TL16 technology; the design charts from all of the various
Traveller incarnations made TL16 fairly boring and non-exciting.

This way, Jump Torpedoes would only be possible if you used TL16 Jump Drive
components, which would be hard to come by in 1105-1115, but at least would
be possible to find, and would become more common as time progressed.

At about TL20, the threshold drops to 1dt, which was the effective minimum.
After that, Grandfather is putting up Jump Gates and pocket universes
anyway, so it all becomes somewhat less important.

However, I do like the "stability breakdown" effect you\'ve postulated here.
I think I might include that along with the 10dt threshold, and even once
you get past the TL16 threshold the DMs would still apply for hulls of less
than 10dt (by using a formula like DM = Hull Size - 10 or something
similar).

Certainly, dampers could be used to help amplify EM fields are the 
source or somesuch, increasing the accuracy of the entire imaging
system without having to make the magnets or sensor any better.
Alternately, you might be able to get away with fairly small magnetic 
fields, which is the holy grail of MRI system designers.

One thing you might be able to do is to get bigger atoms to start 
moving around so you could see stuff other than just hydrogen. Nitrogen
might me a good candidate for imaging protien-based stuff.

The problem with that is that the stuff they inject in you gets
pumped around and what you\'re trying to track is where stuff is getting
pumped to... if everything emits positrons then it\'s not much good. 

Of course, that\'s not to say that you couldn\'t do something else
interesting with the effect. Again, you might use it to image
nitrogen instead of hydrogen, since nitrogen is actually big enough
to break down (unlike hydrogen).

Yeah. Since this whole strong/weak force manipulation thing is all
handwaving anyways, who\'s to say that you can\'t set of oscillating
strong fields in order to induce another field, just like NMR does
with EM fields. Maybe strong/weak force manipulation could be used 
for non-invasive surgery. (and the tumour goes... *poof*)

I dunno if you\'d need grav sensors - you can get pretty good density 
estimates from NMR due to the fact that the human body is constructed
in a pretty limited way. Xeno-medical sensors might benefit from 
densimometer (??) tech, as aliens may have different amounts of water
in their tissue, their bones will be different, etc.

As for the mysterious NAS, I always assumed it was some ultra-precise
EM scanner that picked up "Alpha waves" or somesuch.  My other guess
was that NAS relies on a psionic effect, which I would explain,
but my shoulder muscles are starting to cramp up.

What I though was really cool about the article wasn\'t so much the
MRI stuff, but the NMR spectroscopy. They had a picture of a graph
showing the amount of Glycine, Cysteine and Arginine (amino acids I
think) in a 20 nL sample. 20nL!!! I\'ll shed more than 20 nL of
skin cells just writing this email! And not only are the samples small,
but they can put the sensors on ICs!!! Pocket mass spectrographs 
could be very, very real - just don\'t call them Tricorders. :)

Thanks for the comments Bruce,

Hello,

Hello,
  This one hasn\'t been touched on, IIRC, and has great adventure/merc
campaign potential, esp. if you have Broadsword. What would the 3I be
obliged or inclined to do if a world started impounding/seizing small
independent vessels? Obviously that traffic would dry up, but what
might be done about ones already nabbed (if anything).

Yes, but I contend that \'most people\' aren\'t Travellers any more than
\'most people\' are astronauts or submariners.  The costs of making such a
hostile environment surviveable are largely related to volume.  As long
as there are enough people available willing/able to perform in such
cramped quarters, there\'s no need to meet the conditions of comfort that
most people would require.

This interests me because, as an ex-sub sailor, I enjoy playing with
designs which pack the most capability in the smallest package, and
reducing crew space is a significant factor in this.

   Actually, I don\'t think that there was any hard rule that no starship
   below 100 tons is allowed.  The disclaimer was that these starship
   design sequences only work for ships 100-5000 tons (Book 2) or
   100-1,000,000 tons (Book 5).
   
> I remember this rule from CT, also, but don\'t remember any specific reasoning

   [snip]
   
   None was given, so I made my own rules for designing `starboats\' which work
   very well with canon.  (This is not to say that other rules are not
   possible that agree equally well with canon.)
   
   RATIONALE:  There is a limit to the minimum size you can make a lanthanum
   jump coil.  Beyond this minimum, the flux of j-space through the coil
   causes it to heat up beyond the melting point, and your j-drive breaks
   down and needs to be rebuilt.
   
   SHIP DESIGN: The j-drive size, cost, and energy use for j-boats are
   the same as those for 100-ton ships.  So just design your boat like
   any other small craft (using HG rules), but instead of the j-drive
   formulae, just use the following table:
   
   	Jump   Size    Cost    EP
   	1      2 tons  MCr 4   1
   	2      3 tons  MCr 6   2
   	3      4 tons  MCr 8   3
   	4      5 tons  MCr 10  4
           5      6 tons  MCr 12  5
           6      7 tons  MCr 14  6
   
   (I don\'t have my books here, so I may misremember the costs.)  Keep in
   mind the computer and power-plant requirents make 50-ton j-6 boats
   very hard to build.
   
   J-TORPS: J-torps violate the minimum drive size, and so their drives
   are destroyed during jump.  This means that their chances of misjump
   are higher than normal, and that their drives need to be replaced
   after each jump.  The cost of replacing the slagged drive with a
   rebuilt one runs from many hundred-thousands of credits for a j-1, to
   several million for a j-6.  The computers that navigate the j-torps
   through j-space are very small, low-power versions of the big analog
   computers than navigate starships and are very hard to build; they
   cost 50% /more/ than the standard starship computers, and make up most of
   the cost of the j-torp.  Fortunately, they do not need to be replaced
   after each jump (unless, of course, the j-torp misjumps).
   
   These rules have served me well.  They keep miniature jump vessels
   an exotic though doable technology.  They can add some cool gimmicks to
   a game without unbalancing the campaign.  Maybe they can help out your
   campaign too.

But also remember that to a good first approximation, 2-d is all you ever
see.  Your brain is wired to do \'sensor fusion\' on the binocular input
from your eyes, and derive a 3-d picture, but the basic underlying data is
a 2-d distribution of photons on your retinas.

Douglas, you have that backwards!  "If it has affected your mind, it will
look real enough."  *That* sums up LSD.  In other words, back on topic, I
can\'t imagine any (likely) purely visual effects of looking at jumpspace
causing insanity; rather, it\'d have to mess with your mind directly, with
the visual stuff being a side effect.

Note that my use of \'likely\' up there is meant to cover the possibility
that jumpspace looks like (say) your loved ones being tortured non-stop
for a week, or stuff like that, which *might* drive you crazy.  However,
to look like that, it\'d need to \'know\' what would freak you out, and we\'re
back to the direct mental interaction model.

In short, while Niven-style weird-looking jumpspace is a cool concept, I
don\'t buy it.  IMTU, look out a port in jump and you\'ll see a very faint
blue glow flickering over absolute blackness.

The only time you have a problem is if the jump field goes wonky (as in a
misjump or equipment failure), in which case you get physical interactions
with \'normal\' mass/ernergy as j-space intrudes into the ship...but that\'s
a *very* different question!

BTW, I must have typed too fast if that is what I posted.  It should
have been "someone I know".  Now, some quick comments.
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Craig Berry, at your request, I "took the discussion offlist", but you
didn\'t seem to want to discuss it at that point, or at least I got no
reply from the note I sent you.  So, back I am, Sam I am.

Andrew Boulton, just remember that _you_ posed the first set of questions
and demanded I answer them, and I answered.

Now, in exactly the form that I had predicted, you launch more questions,
because you are not satisfied with your first questions.  It is like I said
before, you get a tire count, and you\'re not happy with that, then you want
tire _pressure_.  Simply--you won\'t be happy with it, _no_ matter _what_ it
_does_ contain.  I\'m even skeptical that you had seen a copy at the time
you wrote what you did.

So, now that midterms are over, I\'ll start with the one reply that was
worthy of an answer.


Ethan, regarding the above...

I just call it social.  Afterall, we are talking about a game, not
something that the masses will rebuild civilisation from after the
fall.  Had the feedback been solicited, then that would be a different
matter, and then more diplomacy could be used than what I have seen
on the Traveller Maligning List (TML).  Since it was _unsolicited_,
In call it lack of spine.  It is that simple.

Frankly, the whole TML would be better off if there were less gossip
and flaming of the game.

To make mountains out of mole-hills is how I see the chatter about
IG\'s product on part of this list.  It reminds me of the time that
it was declared here that (I paraphrase) "Marc had killed off a
major race, and what was he going to do about it?"  Hogwash!

No, Literary Criticism is the work of peers _knowledgeable_ of a subject.

It is frequently solicited as well.  With a game, sales is the
solicitation.

Good point, and thanks for bringing it up.  But with some people, I
don\'t think that applies.

>the relative human worthiness of the products\' respective authors.


The only reason I brought up the Skyraiders trilogy was because Doug
seemed (to me) to be holding up the flawed past as unflawed, and using
it as an excuse for his pointing out flaws of current product.

I really don\'t believe that is so difficult to gather from my post, but
I am willing to consider that the point was not conveyed as well as it
could have been.

"Any sort of review" _is_ a personal attack on the author if it is not
balanced.  Since you bring it up, I was reviewing the informal reviews
of the Traveller Maligning List (TML) as unbalanced and maligning, so
we are in this circle you see.


>Quite simply, you have to be trolling. Your statement goes so much

I\'ve already stated that I feel that there is no balance, supported by
reading some of the TML posts, and don\'t feel obliged to address any
perceived drawbacks, especially when I perceive *NONE*.  Of course, if
you\'d like to compose my reviews, I\'ll have to disappoint you.

Well, that would depend upon the size of "h".  No, it is not an issue
that I might be without spine for preferring Newton\'s method in "n"
dimensions solving the gradient elements of the jacobian for a non-
finite solution.  Having said that, the finite solution is good if it
meets your tolerance criteria.  That is what is important.  Anything
else is wasted cycles.  On the other hand, if you need more precision,
then my "spineless" gaussian elimination might be the only way. :)

However, to flame the game, is an issue of spine when you tell Loren
what you thought of TNE (No matter how right you are) because after all,
it _is_ a game.  We have lost sight of the fact that we derive hours
of enjoyment from this game.  This all reminds me of sportsfans.


>Honestly Leroy, what do you study in school?


Honestly Ethan, I see that of _little_ relevance for this discussion.

Also, if this is going (errantly) the way it did with Dave Golden this
summer, improperly constructed views of my person don\'t account for a
student that is 41 and has played Traveller nearly half his life.

I am trying to decide whether to just apply as a Master\'s candidate, or
go for a straight-through PhD program, in Computer Science and Engineering.
Significant choices for a significant lifestyle. :)

Thank you for at least making an attempt to understand my posts.  I admit
that I don\'t always communicate effectively, but e-mail can effect that
as well. (Personally, I think it is all that IP packet switching. :)


>Ethan Henry

As for the rest of those who might attempt to respond, I _challenge_ you
to understand my posts, rather than interpret whatever view you want to,
to what I have "said."  For some, I know that may be difficult, and none
of us will be surprised if you can not. :)

As for continuing the discussion of the issues of Traveller Maligning with
some of you, I\'ll be happy to if it is worthy of a response, but I am
starting to get complaints that I have not worked on my web page since May
(just before "learning" the whole TML experience).

Don\'t expect line-by-line opinions from me--that is for people who can\'t
stand having their opinions challenged, and a particularly bad habit that
is easy to get in with e-mail commo.  (I only did it here because it was
all worth commenting on to explain something I said from over a week ago.)

So, even though all people with the the ranks them as a Knight are referred to as
\'Sir\', there are specific titles for the various levels.  How about this:

Sir Bruce Johnson, Imperial Knight of Arizona (hereditary title with fiefdom)
Sir Bruce Johnson, Imperial Knight (hereditary title without a fiefdom)
Sir Bruce Johnson, Knight (nonhereditary title)
Sir Bruce Johnson, Knight for the venerable Arizona University (Administrative
Knight, including the institution where title is derived from)

Would this be correct?

I never really thought about it [blush], but swearing to an office may be an American
tradition.

oops.

Barring tradition, do we want to have forces sworn to a single person, or to uphold
the office?  In light of the Rebellion to come, swearing to the person may be more in
line with canon.

You\'re welcome. Sounds good that you want to use it - I was hoping someone
could use it in their own campaign. I thought that this was a good way to
bring some good old fashioned puzzle solving into a Traveller adventure.

Well, the whole idea was to make it as easy to decode as possible in the
first place. If you read my original post, you will see that it was the
_hiding place_ that needed to be inaccessible, if you didn\'t know where to
look. The noble NPC in my campaign did everything he could to make the DNA*
easy to decode - as easy as possible when you\'ve only got four characters.
He actually went so far as supplying the entire alphabet and the \'poly
adenylated tail\' to make the message stand out from the \'garbage\', as well
as some repeating triplets to indicate that the message was to be decoded
in triplets. The code was quite interesting to construct in the first
place, because I had to give as many hints as possible in a _very_ basic
language. Sort of like the same problems you face at first contact.

* We\'re talking DNA here, because DNA contains Adenine, Cytocine, Guanine
and Thymine whereas in RNA the Thymine is replaced by Uracil (Molecular
Biology of the Cell, 2nd Edition, Albert et al. Garland Publishing,
Inc.1989, p. 101). Well, my girlfriend, who\'s a medical student, was
heavily involved in developing the message-in-a-DNA-string concept :-)

There is a chart somewhere that details the tech level differences in items.  I\'m
not sure where it is, but I\'ve come up with an off the cuff way of dealing with
player purchases,

find a specific  item, success on an easy streetwise roll.
(assuming the item is not restricted (i.e. Legal) and is produced _at_ this TL)
For each TL difference - increase the difficulty by 1 level
For each Law Level factor - increase the difficulty by 1 level

Base price is the price found in the book.  Base TL is the TL the item is produced
at.  (I actually assign a range of TLs that an item may be produced at)
If the TL of the location is higher than the base TL: reduce the price by 10% per
TL difference.
(i.e. a TL 7 widget sold on a TL 9 world would have a base price of 80%)
If the TL of the location is less than the base TL: increase by half the price for
each TL difference.
(i.e. a TL 9 widget sold on a TL 8 world would have a base price of 150%, on a TL
7 world it would have a base price of 200%)
if the item is restricted by LL, increase by half the base price for each level of
Law it violates

I always cut the price of used items in half.  (But I may add some interesting
feature to them at the same time...)

Finally, use the actual value table to figure the asking price for the player.

Yes. I\'ll get back to this.

Ok, like, how many times do I have to mention this: Niven\'s hyperspace
doesn\'t look like _anything_. You have an open window, you go into
hyperspace, and the entire wall warps so that the window disappears.
In Niven\'s universe, that makes some people nauseous. But there is no
"look" to Niven\'s hyperspace. It is the "un-look".

Ah-ha! Yes, we have examples in canon where jumpspace makes people
"sick". There are also examples scattered here and there are cargos
that don\'t handle jumpsace well and may break down, or can\'t be carried
in a ship going more than jump-1. 

So, in canon, there are plenty of examples of items being _physically_
affected by being in a ship in jump, even when everything is normal.
If the jump buble breaks down, things can be fatal. But even way before
they get to the fatal point, jumpspace can affect stuff. Stuff like...
your mind! (Aaaaaaaiieeeee!!!) And...

  "If it has affected your mind, it will look real enough."

It reminds me of a sci-fi story (maybe it was a novel even) where,
one day, suddenly, the speed of light changed. It want up by some
fraction of a percent. Scientist figured that the Earth had been in
a "slow" region of space. Entering the "slow" region had killed
the dinosaurs, as suddenly all chemical reactions went awry due to
different energy levels. The big plot point that when the speed of light
went back up, everyone got really, really smart since their brains all
worked just fractionally faster. Chaos ensues when everyone realizes
that their job sucks and they all want to be a lot more fulfilled (maybe
it was a social commentary, I read it when I was young...)

Anyway, maybe that\'s it - maybe the speed of light is .01% faster or slower
in jumpspace. Maybe electron energy levels are slightly different.
Maybe photons are more massive. (Maybe the Great Chuthlu serves drinks 
on the Lido deck) Any of those things might mess with your mind...

	The ATF requires that everything over .50 cal is registered with

Nope, the officer\'s oath has this part in it as well.

According to 

<duck>
Millieu 0, 
</duck>

this is what Cleon had in mind when he founded the 3I. Honorable
individual nobles who would act in the best interest of their charges
and the Imperium.  This would allow a certain stability if the nobles
in questions fulfilled this ideal.  And so an oath by this noble to
the emperor (and thus the Imperium) would be binding as would oaths by
others to this noble.

Currently in the works, but it is a much more complicated project!  FFS2 is
currently at the "this is what the menus look like, send me suggestions"
stage.  If any Maccers out there want to get copies, email me privately and
I\'ll blip them out.

I had originally planned on leaving CSC, but it seems to have taken on a life
of its own :-)

Now if someone would just pay me for the damn thing.  Or if IG would respond
to the letters I\'ve sent them.  Or CORE.

Well, there\'s always the \'Dark Star\' approach...strap on a vac suit, stand
on your board and surf on in...;-)

Sadly enough, I could probably work up something like this that would
work...clamps on the board, some sort of ablative surface, a windscreen of
some sort to keep you from being blown off as you pass Mach 2, winglets
that pop out as you get slowed down from an impossible speed to merely
insane to give you some sort of control. 

He he heh...I can see it now...an insane company of drop
troops...screaming down into the atmosphere..."Ride of the Valkyries"
blasting...screaming "Charlie don\'t surf!"

Some features I plan on adding:

2) External power sources, as well as external power feeds. 
3) Lighter-Than-Air vehicles.
4) The ability to paste illustrations (although not to draw them).



Some features I would like to have, but need some help with:

1) Stacking armour of different materials: I need a nice simple formula for
adding 1cm of iron to 2cm of wood (for example), and then sloping it.

2) Nuclear dampers: I can\'t figure out the tables, so I need some examples
designed for me (with explanations).

3) Gun design: I understand that this is a version of GunsGunsGuns.  If
anyone sends me the book, I will add the capability to design your own
weapons.  (I can\'t afford the book right now.  Think of it as a shareware
payment for a program that gives you hours of twisted enjoyment designing

There will also be individuals, who by reason of the position they hold in either government or
commerce, will be granted the title of \'Knight\' to facilitate their work.  This is an honorary title,
and they are permitted to use it only so long as they hold the position that warrants it.  In most
cases, they will be granted an honorary knighthood upon retirement, but this accolade is not passed to
their children.

Counts administer systems.  A County is hereditary, and will pass to the designated heir upon
confirmation by the Marquis or Sector Duke.  Children of a Count will also receive the honor of adding
\'Lord\' or \'Lady\' to their name, however, with the exception of the designated heir, they may not use
the title \'Count\'.  Counts are responsible to the SubSector Duke, or the Cluster Marquis (if one has
been appointed), whom they will pledge fealty to.  The Count is the nominal commander of the System
Defense Forces, and may call upon the resources of the system to man those forces,  within the
guidelines set by the SubSector Duke.

*Note - Planetary defense forces are the responsibility of the member worlds,  Imperial Nobles may not
interfere with the manning or deployment of those forces
except where:

1) Such manning interferes with the planet\'s responsibility to provide Imperial forces.
2) Such deployment threatens Imperial assets or interests.
3) Other cases, as defined by Imperial Law.

Marquis administer clusters of systems.  [I know absolutely nothing about Marquis - comments from the
list are invited]

	Hm... so if a 6.38 is difficult, how would a 7, 8, 9, and 10 be?
At which point would the recoil be too much for a shoulder-fired weapon?

	I agree.  This place is an oasis of erudition, humour, and
(usually) good temper in the wasteland of cyberspace.  And the cool thing
is is that it\'s not discipline-specific.  I guess that the reason why is
that Traveller\'s scope is just so _huge_, and taps on so many fields, that
a TML will simply attract people from a wide variety of backgrounds.

	And I guess also that since Trav has been around for so long, the
TML also has a pretty high average age for an RPG-related list.  Which is a
great thing, because you don\'t get any munchkins raving about how Victor,
their 4th-Generation Brujah with four dots in Vicissitude and Celerity, can
do 27 dice of damage four times a round...

	It\'s a pretty darn cool list, all right :).

   [a lot of good stuff snipped]
   
   The subject of what do nobles do and how do they retain their social
   standings in a technological and putatively capitalistic society has
   always interested me.  The fact that the Imperium provides a military
   seems an inadequate reason since military rank seems largely
   independent of noble rank.
   
   So here\'s my take on it:  
   
   	The nobles run the starports and collect taxes.
   
   For example:
   
   KNIGHTS: Appointed by the emperor and owing fealty directly to him,
   knights `assist\' barons and other nobles at their duties and encourage
   them to always consider the good of the emperor.  His Majesty\'s
   representatives to planetary governments are also knighted, as are
   high level imperial ministers.  Knightly titles are not heritable.
   
   BARONETS: Otherwise having the full rank, standing, and authority of a
   baron, the baronet is denied a vote on the subsector conclave.  A
   baronet is often appointed by an archduke or viceroy to rule tiny
   insignificant starports on backwater worlds.  In all other
   matters, however, a baronet is essentially a baron.
   
   BARONS: Every starport is a barony and its ruler is a baron.  The baron
   makes sure that the interstellar taxes are collected and that the
   barony and the Imperium both get their share.  In peacetime, he also
   commands the security/naval/marine force at the starport.  He gives
   naughty travellers a hard time, and rewards nice travellers with
   elegant soirees and other social functions designed to promote
   interstellar trade (and interstellar taxes).  Barons run the gamut
   from mighty lords in magnificent manors on wealthy worlds to rude
   dirty starport managers with a fancy name and a big gun on backwater
   worlds.  The baron swears fealty to a count.
   
   COUNTS: Many worlds have more than one starport; such worlds are
   counties.  The count makes sure that the right baron gets the right
   taxes on the interstellar trade, depending on where on the world is
   the official destination or origin of the traded goods.  He handles
   disputes between the barons in his county.  During peacetime he is the
   supreme commander of the world\'s summed starport military forces.  The
   count swears fealty to a marquis.
   
   MARQUISES: Worlds that are closely dependent on one another for trade
   are bound together into interstellar districts called marches.  The
   marquis resolves ambiguities in the interstellar trade tax codes and
   makes sure that traders do not get around the tax laws by trading
   through false destinations/origins.  The marquis also heads up his
   local delegation of barons when they meet at the subsector conclaves
   to vote on trade regulations and duties.  If you falsify your
   destination or origin when you jump, it will be officers of the Palace
   of the Marquis who first notice the discrepancy and question you about
   it.  The marquis swears fealty to a duke.
   
   DUKES: The most important level of interstellar government is the
   subsector level, and most subsectors are duchies.  The Duke collects
   taxes from his barons and uses them to maintain the subsector naval
   and marine forces.  In peacetime, the security of traders and
   travellers is his responsibility.  All subsector officials are
   ultimately hired or fired by him or his officers.  He resolves
   disputes between his marches and enacts the laws passed by the
   conclave.  He represents his subsector at the Palace of the Sector
   Minister of Trade and makes sure that his vassals are not bearing an
   unfair tax burden.  He socializes with the captains of industry and
   does his part to encourage interstellar trade, the lifeblood of the
   Imperium.  The duke swears fealty to His Majesty himself, the emperor.
   
   ARCHDUKES: During the years of the Federation, the Grand Dukes were
   sovereigns, collecting oaths of fealty from their vassals but swearing
   to no sovereign.  They resolved disputes among themselves in the
   Federation Senate.  After Year 0, the Grand Dukes (except for Cleon,
   who retained his title) swore fealty to the Crown and were called
   archdukes.  An honorary title, the archduchy was no different from an
   ordinary duchy, except that its lord was entitled to be addressed as
   `Your Highness\' instead of as `Your Grace.\'  In later years, the
   emperor often granted the title of archduke to his viceroys, but these
   archduchies, like the viceroyalties themselves, were not hereditary.
   
   VICEROYS: The viceroy is appointed by the emperor and acts as his
   agent.  Having full imperial authority, he can do anything the the
   emperor can do. (Although if does anything the emperor would not do,
   he may lose his head.)  A viceroy is appointed for as long as the
   emperor specifies to do whatever he specifies.  Once recalled, he
   loses all rank and privilege, although he can be rewarded with other
   more permanent titles.  Viceroys are common wherever dukes fail to get
   along and in newly conquered territories without a trusted nobility.
   Grand Admirals acquire viceregal power during wartime.
   
   SENATORS: Nobles who distinguish themselves in the eyes of His Majesty
   are often offered seats on the Senate, a house of trusted advisors
   on Capital.  The senator hands over his fief to his heir, and moves
   to the imperial court to represent his area and advise the emperor.
   The rank of senator is not hereditary.
   
   FOPS: Particularly obnoxious or incompetent nobles with a penchant for
   surviving duels are often encouraged by their knights to hand over
   most of the routine responsibilities of administration to a competent
   chamberlain.  The lord, of course, is still consulted on important
   matters like interior decoration and pageantry color-schemes.  Often
   the fief will pay its lord who goes far away a stipend or a yacht in
   gratitude.
   
   MULTIPLE FIEFS: It is sometimes the case on worlds with several fiefs
   that the ranking lord assumes control of more than one fief.  In such
   cases, the ranking lord may hand out the titles of these fiefs to
   others (say, his younger sons) while administering them from his own
   palace.  The lords of these controlled fiefs are essentially
   powerless, although they have their titles and privileges.
   
   
   
   This set-up works pretty well in my campaign.  It gives noble
   characters a great deal of power (but keeps a great many limits on it)
   without giving them a great deal of personal property, so they keep
   their interest in adventuring.

Indeed! I think this has been one of the most sensible comments 
I have seen in a while.  Sure, the Imperium is going to have
enormous tax revenues, but what\'s the waste factor?  Pretty darned
high, I would think, given the way the Imperium is set up.

Which is why I have already said that piracy would probaly
occur as a sideling.  (To smuggling is good, because such
people will already have connections to sell illegal goods).

This cuts both ways.  Sure the profits are high.  But, the
high cost attracts more attention.  If the risks of taking
a ship are high, then you are only going to attract the
very greedy and reckless to such a crime. This is enough
that ship taking will be comesurately rarer.

Well, we already know that I don\'t agree that the percentge is
as tiny as you describe and I don\'t agree that you can take out
enough ships to stop piracy without hurting defense.  (For example,
the number of escorts you need in wartime is a fraction of what
you need to safeguard every ship everwhere, since the point
of convoys is to concentrate ships to make them easier to
defend).  My disagreement is unchanged.

Anti-piracy messages (including many of yours) have included
assumption about the utility of Gas Giants, whether you
would have a regulated jump point, whether transponders
would make ship identification easy and certain, wether
all ships would be tracked on all worlds, etc.  These are
all in dispute and are not cannon.

WWII, actually.  It was introduced in 1938, but was obsolete soon after.

Here\'s the real-world data:
Mass (empty/loaded): 16.32kg/17.235kg.
Length: 163cm.
Recoil system: Muzzle brake, shock-absorbing stock.

>IMHO, 28.5 kg strikes me as being a wee bit heavy.

Yes, that does sound a bit heavy; it _is_ a bit heavy.  Both the PTRS-41
and the .55 Boys suffer from this problem.  The reason that the rules are
set up this way is to allow the machineguns and light autocannons to work
out.  I\'d tested (and rejected) a "High-Energy Recievers" formula that went
something like this:

	Rmass = 10.25 + (Erated - 10,000) / 2500

Ideally, I could use more detailed data on the various modern anti-material
rifles that have been developed within the last 10 years or so, to allow me
to work up a formula that works for all of them.  I suspect that this would
require a special receiver type or other special rule just for these weapons, 
that uses a different formula from the main sequence.

	It\'s not in FF&S2, and IIRC, that was at Marc\'s desire. It\'s not
canonical, and changes the flavor of things. You can still build 6G
fighters, BTW--your crew will just have to deal with the excess Gs.

	Sorry, that\'s a common layman\'s mistake--just because the G-Comps can only
handle 6 Gs says NOTHING about what the maximum acceleration of the ship
is. You can handle 1G excess indefinitely (hint: you\'re subject to 1G of
uncompensated acceleration right now ...), and in combat, for _short_

	I thought we explicitly pointed that out in FF&S2, and provided some
guidelines for the effects of excess Gs?

	FWIW, the oath I took as an American military officer is neither to a
person nor to a government nor other body, but to an ideal:

	"I, David J. Golden, having been appointed a Second Lieutenant in the
United States Air Force, do solemnly swear that I will uphold and defend
the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and
domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I
take this oath freely, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion;
and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office I am
about to enter. So help me God."

There is a small set of rules that I live by regarding communication:

1.  It is up to the person talking to be understood.

2.  Eventually, you must decide that the person on the other end is not
listening.  Stop talking to them at that time.

If your posts are regularly misunderstood, in your opinion, then change how
you communicate.  Or don\'t.  It is entirely your call, but I would be more
likely to listen if you did.  It is up to you whether that is worth
altering your argument style.

Leroy has dug up the grease spot that used to be horse.  Lovely.

I don\'t know what list you are reading, but the TML I\'m on has intense
debates about everything Traveller, a little silliness, and a core group of
people who have grown to be friends.

I would point out that the whole "dissident" minority bit is rather weak in
the face of the thunderous silence from the legions of supporters you keep
claiming.  Why don\'t you accept that many of us find you and your bizarre
opinions tiresome and annoying?

During the Great Task Debate, there was a period when Kenneth Bearden was
posting hourly screeds on how his task system was the Traveller equivalent
of the Second Coming.  It would save our games, knock AD&D out of
contention, whiten our teeth, and help us Make Money Fast!  Many people, me
included, got rather tired of this and told him to knock it off.

How did Kenneth respond?  Not by insulting us, or claiming infallibility
because he once fetched a Pepsi for Loren at a con, but by realizing he had
gone overboard and apologizing.

You seem to be unable to conceive of a universe where people disagree with
you or just dislike you.  Guess what?  I don\'t like you from what I\'ve read
of your work and what my friends who also know you have told me.

Craig has a busy life, raising the Future Ruler of the Planet.  He

OK, there are four vehicles per page, and only one illustration.  Where in

Based on the drawing on page 60, what is the crew compliment of the

So if IG doesn\'t explicitly ask my opinion, I should shut up and take it?
Sure..

Right now I\'m writing an adventure for "Missions of State."  When the
product comes out, I *want* to hear what people are saying about my work,
for good or bad.  That\'s how I improve, by finding out what I\'m doing
wrong, and correcting it.

Looking at the credits for EV, I see the names of several people I would
consider friends.  That friendship won\'t stop me from speaking my opinion.
If an author can\'t take the heat, I suggest that he or she should find a
new line of work.

A few weeks ago, I received email from someone who hated my article
"Strike!" in JTAS.  Went on in vulgar and threatening terms about how
anti-union I was, and how I was probably some life-long college student who
had never worked a day in my life, and if he ever caught me, etc...

The funny thing, I\'m a member of the Teamsters.  Do I get upset that
someone so misread what I meant by the article?  No, I smile and get back
to work.

>Frankly, the whole TML would be better off if there were less gossip

IMHO, the list would be better off without people who make personal attacks
a regular part of their postings.

So the fans had no right to discuss the Aslan?  Hogwash!  It was a major
turning point in the game\'s history, and led to some serious discussions of

No, what Doug did was use a single scene out of a three part adventure to
point out that knowing the capacity of a fuel tank could be important.

You then started yelling about the *jump drives* involved in a separate
book of the trilogy!

That had nothing at all to do with my point, you neatly avoided any
response by going off on a tangent.  Again, since a significant plot point
in TotSR involves a cross-country chase, would you admit that having
detailed information about the vehicles involved is important?

So if I were to review "Plan 9 from Outer Space", it would be a personal
attack on Ed Wood, Jr. if I didn\'t say equally good and bad things about it?

Political Correctness gone mad!  Leroy, I\'m going to call a spade a spade,

Fine, you did that.  Then when several of us pinned your ears back by
calling out the glaring omissions and errors, you responded, in essence,
that we were picking on you, and oops!  mid-terms, gotta run.

I\'ve told Loren what I thought of TNE, and T2K, to his face, and he thanked
me for it.  Leroy, these games aren\'t abstract works of art to be admired
for their simple creation, they are products being released into a very
competitive market.  TNE was like the New Coke of RPGs.  Take an
established winner and screw with it.  T4 is Coke Classic.

Funny, I do line-by-line commentary so that I can reply in full and make
sure that my comments are next to the subject.

Ken wondered if I had fired one legally.  The answer is yes; this particular Boys had been rechambered for .50 cal. Browning.  Col. Castonguay assured me that the difference between .50 Browning and .55 BESA was miniscule; if anything, the Browning round had more kick.

Yeah, Rod\'s definitely in.. of course, after *your* little example in the

Interestingly you get the same problem with the 14.5mm KPV Russian Heavy
machine Gun.  I designed one according to FF&S to check out the the limits
of the design protocol.  It comes out as heavier and longer, by 20% or more
from the figures given in Jane\'s Infantry weapons. ( I will post both
figures as sonn as I can).
Incidently, the KPV was designed around the round of the PTRS and PTRD AT
Rifles, and has roughly twice the Muzzle energy of a .50 cal. (18000:32000
Joules).  By the way, why is there no mechanism for water-coling?

authors isn\'t all that easy. But it could be worse--here\'s the next
challenge. You\'re going to be locked away (or snowed in) from bookstores,

indeterminate period of time. You can choose ten SF books to take into the
box with you for entertainment. These have to be books you can reread (not
right away, necessary, although I\'ve enjoyed a few books so much I started
in again on page one as soon as I finished them). They also have to be
real, hardcopy, paper and ink, bound BOOKS. Which books, by which authors,
would you take?

I haven\'t given this much thought yet, myself, but I know these books will
be contenders to make the list without even looking at my library:

	Heinlein, Puppet Masters
	Heinlein, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress
	Heinlein, Starship Troopers
	Niven/Pournelle, The Mote In God\'s Eye
	Niven, Ringworld
	Cherryh, The Book of Morgaine (cheat--it\'s all three of her Morgaine books
combined into one, from the Science Fiction Book Club. Hey, it\'s a single
book!)
	McCaffrey, The Dragonriders of Pern (another cheat--the first three Pern
books ... Now if the SFBC would just combine a bunch of Heinleins, instead
of doing them one by one ...)

Hmmm ... this is getting harder than I thought! And no fair psychoanalyzing
people\'s personalities based on their choice.

ObTrav: I suppose you could limit this to books with a "Travelleresque"
feel, but I think that would be too limiting...

	I don\'t think it\'s possible, given the cubic root function Greg was forced

two armor values.

It is 10 rounds.  Early version of the No.1 Mk. III had a

On the other hand, aircraft pilots are pulling 3 g *head-to-foot*.
Space fighter pilots will be pulling 3 g *chest-to-back*. You can take
the latter for *long* periods as the centrifuge tests with the
astronauts show.

I\'d say that 3g for extended periods is quite possible. And for
specially picked crews 6g ought to be possible. Maybe even higher.
(anybody know where to get info about the tests they ran on the early
astronauts?)

This is a matter of terminology, but I\'d call that "looking like
something;" that is, it has a visible effect; or in other words, you can
tell you\'re looking at hyperspace by the fact that the porthole has
mysteriously contracted.

I always thought the same way...modern astronauts experience accel of 3-g all
the way to orbit and don\'t really suffer ill effects.  I personally like the
example given in Niven/Pournelle "The Mote in Gods Eye".  The ships were
built for sustained hi-g manuevers, with most controls and equipment built
into specially padded and supported couches, which were able to move around.
 Very few tasks were taken under accel, unless in dire need.  BTW this
universe presupposes NO g-comps...my reason for posting the comment I did was
that the rules (BL/BR) states tasks are 1 level harder for each G of accel
above the comp limit.  Anyone else have any take on this?

Ballad of Beta-2 is an interesting story for giving ideas on high tech
visiting low tech.

BTW, Fritz lieber\'s SF has a few stories that are useful to Traveller
folk. "The Wanderer" has ships the size of *planets*, with weaponry to
match (Particle accelerators thousands of miles long with aperutures
measured in km).

"Gather, Darkness" has a society where a religion is using high-tech as
"magic". 

I can\'t recall if he or Lester del Rey wrote "The Eleventh
Commandment", which deals with another religion dominated society on a
high pop world. And in the end, it turns out that the religion\'s most
objectional (to at least some folks) doctrine is justified after all.
Or at least justified enough that there\'s no easy answer. A great way
to shake up self-righteous characters.

When I was running D&D, I had a simple solution for would be munchkins.
I just dragged out my copy of the C&S Saurians supplement (which
included tables for converting C&S critters to other systems), pointed
out the stats for a T. Rex and after they digested the figures, I
handed them the C&S rules with the stats for Dragons and Trolls
highlighted. They tended to be somewhat subdued after that...

It helped that I\'d been known to have parties fall through "gates" to
other worlds more than once.

Transponders were something I\'ve always had a problem with more or less in
Traveller.  They make sense in the broad scheme of things:  the Imperium
could find out who was there in the system.  That makes sense.

However, I hardly think fringe traders would find this acceptable for just
that reason.  And this isn\'t just a free trader concern either.  There are
several megacorps that have bases and factories outside of the Imperium
(susag jumps to mind).

I mean, even if you were armed, would you want to jump into a non-Imperial
system with a transponder activated?  Of course not!

I think transponders should be overhauled before piracy eliminated.

>Not unless they are at war.

No, naval forces at the borders will have bigger fish to fry.  Coreward, the
Imperium is not at "war" with the Vargr, but there are many incursions into
Imperial space.  That would be the first priority of the Navy.  Granted, it
would be difficult to tell Imperial piracy from Vargr piracy on a ship\'s
scanner, so you\'d have a good chance of being vaporized by a large ship.

On the Zhodani border I\'m sure alot of manpower goes into monitoring Zhodani
ship movements, even when they\'re not at war.

I think the Cr500 per head is too high.  After reading through Trillion
Credit Squadron, which is where the figure comes from, I have decided the
number doesn\'t _work_.  TCS is a set of wargame rules with simplified wargame
economics. As such doesn\'t reflect proper balance.

In addition, it just doesn\'t fit well with the Imperium.  It seems to be more
geared towards smaller pocket empires battling each other than anything else.

If I am to use the Cr500 tax rate, then I\'ll argue that it is the _total_
imperial tax rate, and _everything_ comes out of it.  The XBoats, the
bureaucracy, Imperial colonization projects, naval depots, scout waystations,
scout bases, imperial run starports, imperial colonies, big navy ships, etc
etc.

I\'d be slightly more inclined to accept this figure.  Psychologically it
doesn\'t sit well because the majority of the population aren\'t spacefarers,
and would be, IMHO, less inclined to like paying Imperial taxes.  Most would
be invisible to the common man (traders and brokers are taxed for goods,
which is passed on in cost to the consumer).  However, I would think that the
less interstellar trade on a world (the lower the starport), the less
Imperial taxes they\'d pay.  As a result, these places would be less patrolled
(the Imperium has always struck me as being somewhat mercenary, especially
now with the Milieu:0 book).  Some trade would be done, mainly by tramp
freighters, and some piracy would, or could exist.  So a flat Cr500 just
doesn\'t work.

I\'m not going to assume yearly maintenance is 20%.  I\'m going to assume that
maintenance is 10%, as TCS states.  Actually, the number I *was* using was
0.01%, which is just as low as merchant ships.  Crew costs are relatively
cheap, granted.  But the crew on the ship are not the only crew, AND, high
tech warships _will_ pay alot more money for maintenance than tramp
freighters.  Just the way things are.

And I\'m not so sure that the Navy gets repaired "easier" than pirates do.
 Cheaper?  Sort of.  The navy\'s still paying, but they\'re paying out of the
tax pool.  The pirates are paying out of the lucrative pirate trade pool.

As far as easier, I would bet that pirate ships tend to be lower tech, so
easier and cheaper to repair (a TL 12 sensor is easier than a TL 15 one, for
example).  Further, it\'ll be easier for a TL 12 ship to find a port to repair
in then a TL 15 naval vessel.  Just the way the Imperium lays.

Oh, if *that* is what you want....

1. Recruit a psi with Teleportation and teleport the guy off the ship.

2. While the ship is in atmosphere on the way to the port, do a HALO
   (High Altitude, Low Opening) parachute jump from the ship. That is,
   jump at 10 km or more (if you have oxygen) and only open the chute
   in the last thousand or so feet.

   It\'s a "standard" method for covert insertion. It requires *high*
   levels of skill and is dangerous as hell. Among other things, the
   slipstream around the ship should make things interesting.

3. Use drugs to slow the guy\'s metabolism, wrap him in an insulating
   blanket and bury him in a cargo container full of frozen meat. Sell
   the meat to the folks who want to sneak him in.

"Brain Wave" by Poul Anderson.

One nasty side effect is that *everything* got smarter. This made a lot
of animals dangerous. Earth wound up populated by what had been "low
grade morons" before. The "normal" people (now super geniuses) went
elsewhere. And the remaining people had to do things like introduce a
religion among farm animals so that the animals were willing to be
"sacrificed".

Any effects have to be *really* small. That\'s because changing almost
*any* physical constant by a *small* fraction of a percent will not
merely "mess with your mind", but make the existence of *matter*
impossible.

Well, if you can build a sufficiently sensitive EEG (or equivalent
using other technologies), you should be able to map brain activity
*very* well. Which has a lot of medical uses.

Combine with some of the other scanners mentioned, and you should be
able to monitor whatever goes on in the body to unreal levels of detail.

At high TLs it should be easy to spot anything in the body that is not
working normally, as well as foreign objects. And, much to the
discomfort of players, *reliable* lie detectors should be available.
That is, they\'ll be able to determine if the subject is telling what he
believes to be the truth. Obviously, no device can detect that you are
honestly mistaken about something.

I suspect that such devices won\'t be allowed in court on many worlds,
but that doesn\'t stop people from using them for other purposes. Such
as military use for interrogating prisoners. Or people using them to
interrogate captured player characters (and players using them on
captured NPCs). 

Sure, you don\'t *have* to answer questions. And unless they want to
risk leaving traces that can be detected (almost *any* sort of "abuse"
would show up on a med scan), in most cases folks will be reluctant to
try forcing you to answer. But a lot can be told from what you *won\'t*
answer. And if they don\'t have to worry about abusing you, well... :-)

year. 1000 megacredits a year will support a lot of armed starships.

This is as relevant an argument as saying that people living in the Midwest
wont like and therefore shouldnt pay taxes for the US Navy.

You pay taxes, and the Imperial Navy provides security. Stop paying taxes,
and life starts getting less secure.

How the Imperium levies taxes (whatever their level and purpose), well
that\'s an interesting question. They could do it through taxing
interstellar trade, but that would discourage interstellar trade so I
suspect they\'d just invoice planetary governments and tell them to come up
with the money. Less legitimacy issues that way.

*shrug* it cancels out. If you assume Cr500 a year taxes and maintainence
at 30% per annum, you get the same size fleet as Cr170 a year taxes and
maintainence at 10% per annum. You still get a lot more starships and
spaceships than you need to defend out to the 100 diameter limit.

The 9.98% difference in annual maintainence costs hires all the IN
bureaucrats, pays for the gold-plated Admirals Shore Command Facilities,
maintains all those Naval Bases and so on.

Of course the Navy gets repaired easier. Any civilian facility that can
repair a naval vessel will, with no questions. Any civillian vessel that
gets heavily battle damaged is going to have a paper trail established with
INI or the IISS or whatever other Imperial Bureaucracy gets line
responsibility for piracy intelligence.

Your name shows up as someone who gets into too many fights and some people
want to have a quiet word with you.

True. There is also a good argument for the Navy to procure it\'s low-threat
mission ships at lower TL too, for the same reasons. Lower tech also
corresponds to a disadvantage in combat - could be embarressing if your
TL10 pirate hits a TL12 armed merchant.

The nobility are intended to be a body of trustworthy individuals, upon
whom the Emperor can rely to carry out his intentions. This goes for lowly
knights cruising the frontier in their armed yachts, and archdukes who
administer Domains in the Emperor\' s name.

The Imperium actively encourages adventuring among the young nobility, both
as a means of gaining experience and because the noble and his entourage
\'carry the Imperial torch\' with them. They can be relied upon to uphold
Imperial principles, act as a fire brigade, and take on missions that crop
up suddenly. This is quite a responsibility. 

Of course, there are fools among the nobility. These have to be got out of
the way, perhaps by sending them on long pleasure cruises, or a figurehead
post where the noble can be relied upon to goof off and leave the work to
someone competent. What gets dangerous is when one of these playboys gets
landed with a \'real\' job....

I guess you haven\'t seen any "skyboards" being used. Yes, there are
folks crazy enough to use something that resenbles a
snowboard/surfboard after they jump out of a plane.

And you don\'t need an ablative surface. Most sky surfers would hate the
idea of a one use board. Use something like the thermal tiles on the
shuttle, with a coating that "seals" the surface and toughens it. That
way you can re-use your favorite board. 

If you are going with single use boards, when you get low enough to use
antigrav or a parachute, you cut the board loose after designating a
target. It sails on down and smashes it.

I\'d say there was a disaffected majority who love Traveller (playing, 
reffing, arguing about/discussing. building honking great weapons 
for) but are not entirely happy about all of IG\'s output to date. OK, 
have really slated some products (First Survey, Starships) but have 
been very positive about others (Pocket Empires, Emperor\'s Arsenal).

TML has a highly literate "core" membership (by volume of post) with 
more years of Traveller experience between them than I care to think 
about.  (Me, I only played from the mid-eighties.)  They are highly 
critical, in the sense of literary criticism: informed, constructive 
and sometimes barbed comments.

The prevailing mood is that informed criticism is OK.  Sometimes 
frighteningly well informed criticism, indeed.  Now, do you really 
have a problem with that?  If so, tell us.

IYNSHO.  I agree somewhat -- but the people you attack for this crime 
seem to be among the most ardent lovers of the game _Traveller_ on TML.
I respect their views on other subjects, and it seems reasonable to 
read what they write about the game they enjoy when it\'s negative as 
well as when it\'s positive.


> No, Literary Criticism is the work of peers _knowledgeable_ of a subject.

I can\'t wait for you and Doug to face off at GenCon.  Who\'s going to 
referee?  (JP and Craig are right out.)

Seriously, while I appreciate you have an extensive knowledge of 
Traveller, consider that others may also have such knowledge AND 
STILL DISAGREE WITH YOU.  I see a lot of scientific papers saying 
"such-and-such are incorrect" (only rather more indirectly) but none 
saying "so-and-so is such an obvious know-nothing lowlife" even when 
there is a very polite but bitter disagreement going on.

It is bad form to rubbish the knowledge of people you don\'t know.
It\'s also pretty stupid if you want them to listen to what you say.
It\'s even dumber if you happen to be wrong, in their opinion.


> "Any sort of review" _is_ a personal attack on the author if it is not
> balanced.

Balanced between what and what?  If it\'s an assessment of the merits 
and demerits of a product, then it should include positive and 
negative points, but they need not be explicit.  They will always be 
the reviewer\'s opinion.

If I review something I\'m usually pretty harsh: I point out 
infelicities of phrase, less-than-impeccable grammar, misuse of 
commas, and so forth.  At the end, the very end, comes a note saying 
"Great piece of work, but needs some minor changes to be better."  
Many people on TML review like this.  They want everything to be 
perfect and point out the flaws as they see them.

A former colleague\'s fiancee is a Special Needs teacher i.e. deals 
with the less able and more disruptive junior school pupils.  er 
approach is "Well, you haven\'t got all the letters right... let\'s 
tick all the ones you *have* got right, shall we?"  This approach is 
very good for some situations, but does require detailed attention on 
the part of the listener.  IG doesn\'t have a good record on listening 
to TML, even when things are phrased nicely...

No, no, no.  Ethan\'s point is (I believe) that the method of arguing 
is flawed.  It\'s OK to prefer finite element solutions to analytical, 
or vice versa, but it\'s not OK to say "Using approximate methods of 
integration is worse than worshipping Satan, voting National Front, 
sexually assaulting nuns and small children and liking dogs better 
than cats." (except maybe as a reductio ad absurdam)  It\'s an ad 
hominem argument.  It\'s roughing the passer.  It\'s like the base 
runner interfering with the second baseman\'s throw.

The argument may also be wrong, but that\'s kind of secondary.

Apologies in advance for the following paragraphs:

Look, it\'s very simple.  This is about communication.  The idea is 
for you to tell us things in such a way that we understand what you 
tell us.  Savvy?  Capisce?  Now, if we don\'t seem to understand what 
you\'re saying, either you can try to explain differently, or you can 
give up.  If we understand but don\'t agree (which is neither an 
insult to you nor a sign of ignorance by your readers) you just have 
to live with it, or argue a case in a civil manner.

I believe I understand a large fraction of what you say on TML.  I 
just happen not to agree with it.  I _challenge_ you to argue 
properly or not at all.

I agree that you can over-dissect arguments made by email, but this is 
not a sufficient reason not to read them and comment critically upon 
them.

The "Sir Bruce Johnson, Knight" is kind of plain by comparison, isn\'t it?

I think there would be several "orders" of the non-heriditary knighthood,
and the exact title would depend on the order that the knight was inducted
into.  Exactly which order would depend on who it was that knighted you, and
what it was that you did to get knighted.  Thus:

Sir Bruce Johnson, Knight of the Order of the Emperor\'s Guard
  (for personal service to the Emperor or the Imperial household)
Sir Bruce Johnson, Knight of the Legion of Anatares
  (Knighted by the Archduke of Antares, for service to the Domain)
Sir Bruce Johnson, Knight of the Order of Starship and Sunburst
  (Imperial Navy officers are frequently knighted into this order)

These Orders would frequntly be abbreviated (particularly in
correspondance), so that you\'d have:
Sir Bruce Johnson, OEG
Sir Bruce Johnson, LA
Sir Bruce Johnson, OSS

Players and referees should be encouraged to get creative with this, though
if someone comes up with the Order of the Knights Who Formerly Said \'Nee\'!
(OKWFSN), they\'ve probably gone too far ...  ;-)

The DOS version of SYSGEN/Library is up on
ftp://ftp.maths.tcd.ie/pub/jaymin/trav. It is a few years old but does all
of WBH, including surface generation. Unfortunately it is also rather
unstable.
A Java version of Galactic, with the same functionality, can be run from
the web on http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~jaymin/weaver/GALApplet.html. You need
a 1.1 browser. You can also run this on your local machine under W95 if you
upload Sun\'s runtime environment kit.

Yea, verily, and kneel when you say that, knave! ;-)

That\'s about right. Since the Knight as the lowest noble rank, is the
interface between noble and common, it\'ll be more complicated. All the
other ranks will probably be straightforward \'title-and-a-fief\' sorts of
things.

Except, of course, for those impovershed nobility who\'ve gambled away,
frittered away, blown away, or otherwise lost their incomes from the
fiefdom. Those will be uncommon in the early 3I when the nobility is being
chosen from the rich and influential, but later there should be quite a
number of them to provide needy GM\'s with helpful game hooks and colorful
NPC\'s.

What about converting all armours to an equivalent thickness of steel, adding

The epileptic seisure example is not so good, because a preexisting
condition exists. :-) There is no example of a visual stimuli, by itself,
causing a mental disorder like what is popularly conceived of as "insanity"
- -- personality disorders, schizophrenia, and the like -- in a normal
individual.

The statement that sparked this thread went along the lines of "while it
[seeing jumpspace] doesn\'t cause you to go insane, it sure doesn\'t help."
(I paraphrase) I contend that this is only true to the extent that looking
at any really disturbing visual stimuli in realspace "doesn\'t help" your
sanity.

Human senses are limited. Even if jumpspace were to be 5-, 6-, or even
10-dimensional, all you could percieve would be a 3-dimensional
manifestation of it (4, if you count seeing events evolve as "seeing"
time). I submit that there is no reason to believe that 3-dimensional
stimuli would cause insanity.

(If there was, then we could expect Imperial technology to be able to
replicate it (the holo that drove the Imperium insane ... :-). While this
is entirely cool for a setting with a horror or fantasy bent, it doesn\'t
seem so appropriate for a hard sf one.)

I have no problem with a handwave like jump dementia, or jump psychosis, or
whatever. But the mechanism should be appropriate -- and simple visual
perception just doesn\'t fit the bill.

(BTW, I like the "perfect mirror" description of the jump bubble that was
described during this thread. :-) Much better than the grey nothingness,
white noise, or void that I had envisioned myself).

Yeah, the PTRS is a big honking belted round so they can stuff a lot more
propellant in it.

This points out a problem that plagues all the design systems for firearms
I\'ve worked with...all of them try to use linear (or close to linear)
functions to describe real-world processes that aren\'t linear. As energy
goes up in the real world, you don\'t necessarily need more mass in the
reciever, but differently designed recievers and different materials in
the reciever. 

FFS2 does allow the use of advanced materials in recievers,
but for very high energy weapons on the border between the firearm and
artillery things go screwy. (I wonder what would happen if I used the
artillery design sequence to make one of these rifles? It would be off the
low end of the scale, and would require some creative rules-bending.)

Having a third reciever design for \'high energy firearms\' might help, but
that, too would have it\'s problems, by simply shifting that border to a
different energy range.

It\'s just something we have to live with: after all (despite what some
people say about it) FFS2 is a _simplified_ modelling system. One that is
accurate would require us to actually _design_ the weapons in question,
and believe me, that is _slightly_ more complex. :->

Water-cooling jackets were not included because there is no provison for
heat dissipation, or calculating the heat to dissipate in _any_ design.
The automatic weapons in FFS2 will fire at full auto until you rin out of 
ammunition, however unrealistic that might be.

I think cooling systems are just assumed to be there if neccesary. There\'s
nothing to staop anyone from tacking one on, it\'s just that you\'ll have to
pretty much wing it as far as what the stats would be.

As I studied Chemistry I have some experience with NMR, because we use it 
for chemical analysis of organic molecules. So I only want to add that 
not only Hydrogen is NMR-active, also is Carbon, Phosphor, Fluorine, etc.
But it\'s only special Isotopes of some elements that you can detect with 
NMR. (C-13 for example, or F-19, which is also the only isotope of 
Flourine existing).

There indeed is the possibility of analyzing proteins with the NMR Method 
and I know some Chemics just doing this. It\'s not perfectly now, but with 
increasing TL in Biochemistry and Computers, you should soon expect a true 
imaging device that can read your entire DNA by placing a sample of hair 
in it.

Additionally this seems to be an answer to the article honouring the

What about resolving the armor values to the \'lowest common denominator\'
and adding them...ie: lets say you have iron over wood, figure out the
thickness of wood that gives you the equivalent armor value of the iron,
add the thickness of the wood underlaying it, and calculate from there.

Again, if we look at the way most movie and book reviewers work,
they make unsolicited (but not unappreciated) reviews and they are
under no obligation to know _anything whatsoever_ about the author.
Lots of people reviewed "Primary Colors" by the ever-popular
"Anonymous".

> No, Literary Criticism is the work of peers _knowledgeable_ of a subject.

Ugh. Come on. Most movie reviewers are not film makers. Most book
reviewers are not authors. As a matter of fact, I would go so far 
as to say that it\'s unlikely that, in the arts, there are ever 
reviews by peers. In scientific papers, it\'s a different story, but
I think that the closest comparison for a product like _Emperor\'s
Vehicles_ is, well, a book, so I think that the model set by book
reviews should apply to reviews of _EV_.

You, Doug or I can say anything we like about _EV_, without making
any statements about the author by implication. It\'s a review of
the _work_ not the _author_. I can say "This book is shit" to the
authors face. It isn\'t in any way "spineless". If you don\'t
agree with that, fine, but please, don\'t make too much noise when
people disagree with your reviews.

Forcing reviews to be "balanced" is the kind of advice you give grade 
school students for book reports. If the product is balanced, the review 
will be balanced. If the product is biased (say, biased towards being
useless) then the review will be biased (say, biased towards saying
the product is useless).

Whether it\'s a game, a book, a painting, a play or a piece of music,
they are all works by an author. We interact with them differently,
but they\'re all creative works. As creative works, they\'re received
by different people differently. I have every right to say, to anyone,
what my opinion of a work is. I resent you saying that I _cannot_
express my opinion. Also, can we keep Loren out of this? Unless I
am mistaken, Mr. Wiseman is an individual person, not some sort of
author-archetype. I am making a general point, not a specific one,
so it is a non-sequiter to drag in "Author X" and "Creative Work Y".

*Bingo* Did I mention that my last message was a flame? This is what\'s

Oh boy. "I challenge you to _understand_ my posts, rather than 
_interpret_..." (emphasis mine). I really wish I understood more
Habermas (and communicative philosophy in general) as I\'m sure I\'d
be able to rip yo to shreds for making some sort of bizzarze
dichotomy between  "understand" and "interpret". You sure are lucky
that I\'m so poorly read.

Anyways, that is that. As Nick Munn said, in communication,
the onus is on the _comminicator_, not the communicatee (is there
such a word?) to make himself understood. If we have misunderstood you,
well, I hate to hurt your feelings, but IT\'S YOUR OWN FAULT!

Whew. I feel better now.

Leroy, you don\'t mean to insinuate that members of the TML are *NOT*
_knowledgeable_ about what makes a rpg supplement worth buying, do you?

That\'s what the above comment implies to me -- you better don some
asbestos underwear...

> It is frequently solicited as well.  With a game, sales is the

There are not-so-friendly local gaming stores which don\'t allow you to
browse books cuz they shrink-wrap \'em. If one orders by mail, or simply
doesn\'t have the time to give a book a thourough looking-over in the
store, one doesn\'t know whether the supplement is worth the 30 clams
(canadian clams, in my case).

To all members of the TML: Keep reviewing products!

They are useful to *me* because I can\'t afford to buy _every_ supplement
that comes out -- I really don\'t play the game much anymore. Also, it
ticks me off when I buy something of no use or of little value.

??? "Balanced" ???

Most reviews I have read on the TML have been honest and critical, and
frequently give glowing praise to the *authors* of the book. The layout
people, proofreaders, and actual production staff on the other hand . .
.

I\'ve read many a "balanced" review on this list. I\'ve made opinions of
what is important to certain reviewers by their posts, and judge each
review accordingly, taking into account *my* tastes. Just because what\'s
important to *them* isn\'t important to *you* is no reason to call the
review "unbalanced".

OK, apparently you think the goose can call the gander black and what\'s
good for the kettle is not good for the pot. ooops... getting flustered
;->

It\'s perfectly fine to state that you saw no flaws in a product. That\'s
jim-dandy. And I, reading your review, formed an opinion of what was
good about the product, and why, according to your taste and
interpretation.

That\'s just super.

Someone reading your review posts their own, pointing out why they
believed the things *you* liked were actually flaws in the product. I
read, and try to understand this person\'s points, taking into account
what I know about his priorities.

Great! Awesome! Another point of view. I process...

This is called healthy debate. I try to filter out personal grudges,
tone, and bad feelings. I try to get to the heart of the disagreement.
The facts.

Knowing what\'s important to *me*, I form my *own* opinion, which
amazingly enough, is _still_ subject to change.

Taking EV as a concrete example, to me it is flawed. *Every* other
vehicle supplement *ever* produced for Traveller (that I have, anyway)
included info on how many people it takes to crew it, how much fuel it
needs, and at what TL it is produced. I might buy a used copy if my FLGS
has their half-price on used item sale, (picked up an extra TNE boxed
set for $21 and Belter for $3.50 last time) but it\'s not worth 30
smackeroons to me.

Do you *really* think that Loren didn\'t want to hear about what others
thought of TNE? Do you think he only wants to hear praise, and not
criticism? Do you really want to treat him like a mushroom? (keep in the
dark, feed manure)

HEY LOREN! If you\'re listening. I really liked the vast majority of TNE
supplements. What I liked best was the consistancy. For example,
Brilliant Lances was easy to integrate with the game, and used the
underlying FF&S sequence. Movement was a tad cumbersome, though. Battle
Rider\'s vectored movement was better than that chart on the combat
sheet. Weapons, vehicles and starships were included in the back of many
supplements, and were based on the same FF&S sequence.

It was good that when mistakes were made, you always tried to issue
errata in a timely manner. The little errata booklet included with FF&S
was very useful. And the article boosting plasma weapons in Challenge
was great.

The setting held promise, but was too gritty and milataristic for my
tastes. Ah well. The black curtain bit was too much. The game mechanics
were too heavy on detail. A friend who borrowed the rulebook couldn\'t
absorb it all. It was really an rpg for the experienced, and those
unafraid of a lot of reading.

I didn\'t actually *play* the game that much, but I bought nearly every
supplement. They were all interesting, and good reading. I played with
FF&S design, chuckled at those pesky hivers, and we experimented with
the combat system and the starship combat boxed sets.

I look forward to your GURPS Traveller supps. I may actually never buy
GURPS, but I anticipate buying your supplements.

I know that Marc doesn\'t like personal attacks on IG. I appreciate that.
But he does want to know where mistakes were made, and he doesn\'t want
that to happen anymore, as evidenced by his last post re: Aliens, and
the extra time and feedback he solicited for T4.1. Feedback on quality
is all-important to a successful businessperson.

Being a little short in psionic ability, the best I can do is interpret
your words in a manner most consistant with the rest of the english
speaking world.

If you feel you are being misunderstood, perhaps you should get someone
else to read your post and tell you in his or her own words what you
have said. That way, you will know if everyone understands what you mean
to say.

Speaking as part of the Silent Majority, I\'d just like to say that 
based on the review fragments about EV written by various people on the list
whom I respect, I\'m highly unlikely to buy it. Leroy\'s defence ("Look at the
picture if you want to know what the crew is!"), on the whole, makes me 
even less likely to buy it. To some extent this can be taken as a measure of 
the success of Leroy\'s communication skills. 

And I would note that lots of the people who are criticizing EV aren\'t 
mindless IG-haters; one of the most common comments seems to have been
how poor it was compared to Emporer\'s Arsenal, which nearly everyone likes
a great deal.

Currently manufactured by the Sayat Board of Organization and Oversight for
Munitions, the PMPP was originally designed as a novelty item for the
domestic market.  It is, however, exported in some quantity to the
Imperium, where it is popular with collectors and certain paramilitary
organizations.

The optional Kegel trigger of earlier models has now been discontinued, as
numerous accidental discharges had resulted in injury and death.  A variety
of manual or voice-activated triggering devices are available from the
manufacturer and many local retailers.  The extremely popular "pop-up"
holster is now factory-packaged with each weapon, though it requires fairly
extensive adjustment and custom fitting to function correctly.  The
Imperial Ministry of Commerce has not yet handed down a ruling on whether
the PMPP is to be regulated as a "concealable weapon", however.

Users should also be warned that "boinging" and lateral wobble makes firing
in motion or turning rapidly a highly inaccurate and dangerous endeavour.
Owners are strongly urged not to attempt to emulate usage of the PMPP seen
in action/adventure holovids.  Furthermore, after firing the barrel remains
superheated, and incautious users may burn themselves.  Finally, the PMPP\'s
extreme recoil requires that the shock-absorbing harness be worn properly
to minimize the possibility of severe internal damage.  SayBOOM are said to
be investigating the application of gravitic stabilization to further
improve accuracy and aim.

Yep.  It\'s my deer rifle.  It\'s good for the woods in Missouri, where
there\'s lots of undergrowth.  The only problem is the bloody thing\'s
sighted for 100+ yards, so I have to adjust a little at closer (hunting)
ranges.  One of these days I\'ll get a long front blade installed.

I was planning on getting you the measurements the old fashioned way
(ruler and scale), but with some of the references I\'ve seen kicking
around on the list, I\'m sure someone can just look them up.  (Which
would be greatly appreciated... hint, hint :-)  If they\'re not
available, I\'ll measure it.

It\'s a 10-round magazine fed by 5-round speed clips.  The original mag
on mine was cut down to 5 rounds by a previous owner to meet the 5-round
limit for hunting rifles.  I wish he\'d cut down an after market one

There is a question of whether two 1cm layers is better or worse than a 2cm
layer.  IIRC, you are better off with two, especially if there is even the
smallest gap between them, but I do not know.

The way I played it when I needed to was to assume that one added them
together as layers of hard steel, and the interface added a bonus.

Thanks.  I was also thinking that (uh-oh), to make such a concave mirrored
reflection seem even stranger, you could introduce stray power surges that
make their way to the jump bubble due to *minor* impurities in the liquid
hydrogen.  They could create momentary bulges or ripples that could give
the jump bubble reflection a little "life" to it.  It would also help to
create some discomfort for anyone viewing it, driving home the notion that
the jump bubble is very delicate indeed, and that it is all that stands
between them and their doom.  Bwah-hah-hah-hah!

Ok, sure. But it could be the root of jumpace sickness and

of physical constants could alter biochemistry just enough to cause
a subtle change. I agree, it wouldn\'t be very large at all. It would

The hermeneutic movement and moment are, I think, a highly distasteful

  >>

In my previous message I mentioned that J. Andrew Keith apparently wrote a
(draft) source book on piracy in the Imperium.. My understanding is that Marc
and GDW both accepted it as canon..

I\'ve now got more information if anyone can help track it down..

J. Andrew Keith wrote it in 1984 while running Marischal Adventures?Gamelords
with the intention that GDW publish it as a boxed module - it was either
called \'Rogues in Space\' or Letter of Marque\' or something similar and was
intended to be the first in a series detailing the underworld.

The basic idea as I\'ve been told was that piracy exists but piracy as such is
not common and isn\'t effective without the support of wealthy backers or
planets. As such pirates are rare in the Imperium.

Instead Privateers roam the Imperium spacelanes - which are tolerated by the
authorities much in the same way that mercenaries are tolerated. The Rules of
War apply. These ships attack shipping belonging to hostile governments or
traders  supporting that government on the understanding that completely
independent shipping and passengers are untouched..

Of course privateers are also used in Trade Wars and a large merchant Corp
may elect to \'attack, burn, cripple or destroy\' independent traders who are
in competition with them and during lean times could \'drift\' into outright
piracy. Because they are merc\'s they receive funding from Governments or
corps as well as catured cargo or salvage on ships... Personally I like the
idea that privateers don\'t keep your ship however, to get it back you must
pay salvage.. Would make the backers happier too.

This could provide an answer to the piracy question - merc\'s and privateers
can roam the starlanes freely and provided they don\'t break the rules of war
then the Imperium doesn\'t interfere yet if the players p*ss off any major
corps they could find themselves at risk from authorised Privateers.. Pirates
are hunted down mercilessly and destroyed. Unfortunately many Imperial
\'pirates\' are legal privateers MOST of the time and they need to be
identified or caught in the act... Difficult.

Comments please!

Hello,
  Has anyone had the chance to ballpark an average cargo value to
help work this through? I would expect that resale values will
start at 50% and head up, especially if you redeploy to sell them
as your own specualtive cargo, or have a confederate do so for you.

  As far as grabbing the ship goes, if it can be sold for a good
portion of its real value then doing so is provably better for the
pirate gang involved. The system isn\'t closed, and the purpose is
to make wads of money, not to stay in "business" as long as you
can (which maximizes your chance of being attritted).

  The "organization" Douglas proposed would be an excellent campaign
specific (either regionally or temporally limited) model for having
a true pirate problem in a policed zone. These "Orion Pirates" do
appear awfully close to the "enemy gov\'t/corp" model, and should be
considered as such until a method for recruiting individual ships
without a 20%+ capital outlay is proposed (about, three hours?).

        Yours truly,

  I\'ll buy that. The light SDB\'s don\'t work well for open space fights.
Either way, the large ships are most likely going to function as guards
at fixed sites, as they lack the numbers to patrol except as training.

  Assuming goodly quantities of light SDBs or police cutters, all of
the gravity wells with noticeable traffic will be inviolable. This
refers only to clasic piracy, not smuggling, hijacking, kidnapping...
Actually, said vessels serve mostly as reaction forces and inspection
boats, as COACC/PD/fleet units provide ridiculous physical force levels.

  Further, in a well integrated system, starships will not carry cargo
from the belt, for example, unless said cargo is perishable. For this
case that means effectively no starships with valuable cargos will
be leaving the belt - valuable machinery, etc, being brought in will
jump direct to the locale of the destination, and not be interceptable
without inside info. Given the literary commentary going on, Niven\'s
model of a populated belt and the number of telescopes tracking every
object that moves is instructive.

  I\'m assuming <100 D is +5, <10 D is +10, 11+ misjump, 16+ XX (IIRC).
The +5 makes commercial ops non-viable, makes various forms of death
quite possible, and generally contributes to an attrittion rate that
is unacceptable for prolonged operations. If the alternative is getting
shot up, you\'ll jump, but if attacking inside 100 solar D\'s is your
best plan then you\'re not bright enough to last very long.

  Greed, or desperation in making an honest living/merchant house, or just

  Attrition rates relative to pay-off will be very important. As attrition is
directly related to number of missions (regardless of payoff), and payoff is
likely much higher for nabbing ships, I would argue that the objective is to
hit and take a ship, leave, and go legit (either by selling the target or
using it as a payment-free merchant).

  The most practical way for an independent pirate to function is through
normal channels. Dump cargo to crooked dealers, sell it to belters or
other merchants, or sell it as your own spec cargo. If you can\'t fake
the papers for these, how can you avoid leaving a trail for INI.

  As for how to justify a large independent, full time pirate? Not sure, yet.

No, I expect someone that suggests a subject go off list would _actually_

Nowhere.  I treat it like most Traveller references--the art is just
eye-candy, and in the cases that I am happy with an illustration, I use
it as the conceptualization.   If I don\'t, then I imagine something else.

It is seldom that you get someone who both writes and does artwork, that
it is rare that you match any artwork with an item/reference in Traveller.
In CT, you see that happen most with Bill Keith\'s works of art.


>Based on the drawing on page 60, what is the crew compliment of the

I\'m not sure the question is even relevant.  I would use it as an encounter,
and my Traveller campaign is not Star Trek where you take your trusty old
tricorder out and find out the exact census of the vehicle.

It is not likely that my players would be interested in "buying" one for
tooling around the planet on, and if they did, they\'d have to get a larger
starship to carry the damned thing.  Like I said, irrelevant.

In general, these questions are up to the referee to decide.  Some may not
even use it since it is grav-powered, such as the campaign in which I play.

I think the basic value of _EV_ has been totally overlooked.  I\'ve said
before, I don\'t sit around designing things, and having this kind of book
is _great_ as an idea generator.

Hello,
  These are good, certainly as one-offs. #3 and 4 lend themselves very well
to smuggling, fraud, and perhaps one-shot piracy for the big score. #5 sounds
more like an invite to suicide, as eventually someone may notice that this
is _political_ (+ armed) opposition. I assume we agree that\'s verboten.

  I seriously doubt that specialized piracy vessels could get bank financing
in the 3I. You can\'t come up with a convincing business plan, without your
loans dept. getting the _right_ idea. I further suspect that a bank is truly
hosed if a pirate is caught, and investigation reveals that they should have
known what the ship was intended for. It\'s quite possible that Imperial mega-
corps end up as Japanese-style conglomerates including their own financial
reserves, i.e, interstellar banks are closely inter-related (though not under
the thumb) to the mega-corps. This gives the Imperium (and thus IN) an "in"
to these organizations through Imperial family stock holdings and resultant
seats on the boards of directors. Tukera, OC, is a low % holding.

As opposed to the way Americans gleefully pay their taxes secure in the
knowledge that they are doing their patriotic duty ?  Who can forget the
many smiling faces you see on the news every April 15th standing in line
at the Post Office ?

Must control maniacal laughter !

Taxes are not exactly voluntary in most places. (Although they probably
are on a few planets with government type 0).   If you do not pay your
taxes the government will take your possesions away from you.  If you
give them trouble they will send people with guns to talk to you.  If
you give the people with guns trouble they will hurt you.  If you try to
stop the people with guns from hurting you they will _kill_ you.

If you do not pay your taxes your planet will not have the money to pay
its taxes to the Imperium.  If your planet is sufficently short or late
in its tax payments the Imperial government may or will send the
Imperial Navy to come talk to your planet.  It is entirely possible that
they will start talking to your planet with their spinal mount weapons
and nuclear missiles.  After all if your planet is not fullfilling its
duty to the Imperium by paying its taxes it is in open rebellion against
it.  After they make an example of a few million people or so I\'ll bet
your neighbors will pay _their_ taxes on time.  It is true you can\'t get
milk from a dead cow but the Imperium has (in M1100) trillions of
citizens, they can afford to kill a million & miss it no more than a
govvernmnet with millions of citizens will miss 1 taxpayer - they will
serve as a good example for the others.  (Besides it has been a good
live run for the Imperial Navy after all they need to know how to
properly commit genocide....)

Just because the Imperium is a fun place to role play in does not mean
that it is a benign government based on sweetness and light.

Are you suggesting that they would pay a lower _rate_ or just that,
being poorer, the same tax rate would lead to less tax revenue ?

What makes you assume that the Imperium does not use the legal concept
of sovreign immunity.  Using this legal doctrine (simplified from real
world use for role playing use) you can not sue the government without
their permission.  I think the estate of little Billy Jenkins may be out
of luck.

  If valid, this would make "casual" pirates much more survivable
(and thus more likely) while waiting for the "one big score". This
still begs the question as to whether constantly taking the cargos

  The period in which such a ship runs rampant may still be
unacceptable even from apurely military POV. Also, any model
that applies to "squashing" commerce raiders would seem to
apply to the specialty pirate as well.

Ever have a moment when you\'re glad you\'re _not_ drinking a coke?

My apologies to the list for raising the spectre of post-modernist
(actually, I think it\'s post-post-modernist, or modernist, depending
on how you look at it) philosophers. Not that I know anything about
Habermas, mind you, I just watched him drive my wife insane last year
in grad school (no, not personally, just through essays).

Perhaps obtuse German po-mo philosophers hold the key to Jumpspace

   This sounds very similar in concept to the trade war that Marc
   wrote about `The Traveller Adventure\' where Akerut and Oberlindes
   trading companies were having at each other with the players
   running `special ops\' for Oberlindes.
   
   The `Traveller Adventure\' also had an episode of Pirating going
   on in an asteroid belt.  Pirates that prey on belters are going
   to be relatively safe. (Especially compared to pirates operating
   within 100 diameters of a starport!)
   
   This will be especially true in a belt where lanthanum is mined.
   If the players are foolish enough to bring their starship into
   such a belt, a local pirate may just realize that the ship\'s
   j-drives are the richest `lode\' of lanthanum in the area.  He
   disposes of the players and the remains of the ship and takes its
   lanthanum coil (properly slagged and laced with impurities) down
   to the local watering whole to brag about the big new find he\'s
   staked out.  He sells the lanthanum and THEN auctions off his
   stake.  He makes a killing and gets off scott free.  Very
   lucrative.  No need for a fence, fake transponders, or an
   extensive supply area.  Imperial authorities are never involved;
   it\'s entirely a local matter, and the victims were off-worlders.
   
   Why, a pirate could make a living doing this, if he moved around
   enough. 8^)

Almost anything would be better than ID4 (ID4? What happened to the first

Sorry, but I\'m not a huge Heinlein fan. Maybe if I\'d spent my youth reading 
_Starship Troopers_ instead of _Childhood\'s End_, _I Robot_, or _The 
Stainless Steel Rat_ I\'d feel different.

Well, maybe just this once.

To clarify, I said EV was broken, you said it wasn\'t. I asked you to 
demonstrate how usable it was by answering some basic questions that the book 
didn\'t appear to answer. I seem to remember your answers were basically, "In 
my campaign, nobody would ask these questions."

Nooo...I wasn\'t happy with your answers. Subtle difference.

If it\'s full of crap, no, I won\'t be happy.

Then I\'d be interested in your theory about how I could quote data directly 
out of the book, giving the correct page numbers.

Why do you think that? First of all, why does a review have to be balanced 
(by which I assume you mean it contains an equal number of good and bad 
points)? A review should be accurate - if the book is a load of crap, the 
review should say so. This *may* take the form of a personal attack on the 
author, but it doesn\'t have to (and normally shouldn\'t do); one doesn\'t imply 
the other.

*Everybody* else (who has commented) thinks there are problems with EV: I 
(and many others) *wanted* to like it, but were very disappointed; others 
*did* like it, but agreed there were things wrong with it. Only you failed to 
find a single flaw. 

Strange.

Ah, so anything too difficult will simply be deemed \'unworthy\'. I do hope my

I\'m sure everyone has pretty much taken notice of Leroy\'s tired old method
of debating.

A venerable member of the HIWG list described his methods best when he said
that Leroy constructs "straw man" arguments. Essentially he (mis)interprets
your statements to his advantage, ascribes comments to you that you never
made, and then proceeds to disparage them one by one.

In short, he puts words into your mouth and then acts like they were your
words in the first place. It\'s a handy way of winning an argument, but in
the end it\'s more like he\'s argued with himself than with you.

I haven\'t figured out yet if he does this on purpose or if he suffers from
some sort of dementia. Perhaps we\'ll all figure it out eventually if he
continues to prattle on this list.

Best,

Leroy, _you_ were the one who was saying "look at the pictures" several
posts back when people were asking the crew complement of several vehicles.
To do an about face in response to Dougs question is.... curious.


>In general, these questions are up to the referee to decide.  Some may not

No, these questions are not up to the referee to decide. These questions
are answered when the vehicle is designed. IG chose not to include the
information *that was already there*. If the referee wants something else
than what is in the book, the referee can either design it himself or make
up the numbers. As it is, with this book he still has to make up some of
the numbers.


>I think the basic value of _EV_ has been totally overlooked.  I\'ve said

Like you, I don\'t sit around and design things (although I\'m beginning to
play around with 3G3). Having this sort of book is, for many purposes, of
very little value. Sure, I can get ideas from it - but then, I could get
ideas before spending $30+ Australian. Although if I remember correctly one
of the people who designed several of the vehicles put his original designs
up on the web (with - shock, horror - the _full_ stats for the vehicle).

criticism. In order to convey my thoughts, I\'m going to paraphrase someone
famous. I can\'t remember who - I think it was Chris Rea - said this but:

(Commence paraphrase mode)
\'If I grow cabbages in my garden and eat them myself, then nobody has the
right to tell me that my cabbages are no good. If I go around saying \'hey,
my cabbages are the best in the world\'  then EVERYONE has the right to
comment, because I\'m holding them up for criticism,\'
(Paraphrase mode off)

What the man was saying was this: If I write something for publication I\'m
inviting comment on it.
That means it\'s quite legitimate to criticise the work that someone is
holding up to the world. If you can\'t handle that then don\'t publish. Same
goes for criticism - if you make your criticism public then be prepared to
be criticised yourself or to be challenged on your accuracy.

Thus, I think it\'s fair enough me saying: \'Newton\'s laws are a fine model,
even though they\'re not truly laws but more like observations, and they
don\'t work for all cases. Yes, overall Newton\'s laws are good enough for
the macro universe we inhabit day-to-day - but they\'re certainly not the
whole story.\'

I can expect to be disagreed with, of course. 
But what I\'ve said is a commentary upon Newton\'s work, or rather this part
of it.

I\'d be out of line to say, "Newton was an idiot, a fool, a gabeezling
wabsnart of a man with no more intellect than a sponge pudding." (I\'d also
be some kind of idiot myself).

My point is:
It\'s fair enough for those of us who know a little about gaming to comment
on a game product. It\'s not spineless or vindictive in fact it\'s our RIGHT,
since the product is being held up for our evaluation. I write for
publication, and I expect that people will judge my work. If they  look at
my work and say, "This bit\'s not so good" that\'s fine. If they say,
"Dougherty is a fool." then I\'d object. That\'s not crisicism of a piece of
work, that\'s a personal attack. I do not expect someone to tell the world
he thinks I\'m an idiot for writing something. But he\'s welcome to say he
dislikes it for this or that reason - I reserve the right to reply and
justify myself.

We are the Faithful. We are the ones who love Traveller. It is our right
and our duty to say what we really think about a particular product. How
else will IG discover what the gamer-public thinks? 

(Which is the correct approach?
	
	A: IG are a pack of bumbling fools. They must be, to let this rubbish
escape their wastebin!

	B: This supplement has several things I really don\'t like. These are: Blah
Blah Blah
	This is why I disagree with these points blah blah blah.....

	C: I really love Traveller and this supplement is a fine addition to the
range. There\'s a couple of 	points I disagreed with and these could, in my
opinion, be improved by.... here\'s why I think 	that....

	D: The author is a slavering wretch of a man. A fool, a baboon in sheep\'s
clothing!!! (rant rant)

	E: This supplement is crap.

It\'s obvious which ones are useful (B and C), even if quite critical, and
which ones are personal attacks, or are unjustified, unsubstantiated
opinion which contributes nothing but bad feeling.)

SO: If you have an opinion about a product, it\'s OK to share it, provided
you\'ll not be embarassed to face the ensuing difference of opinion. If you
quibble with a fact, make sure yours are correct. If you disagree with an
opinion, justify yourself. Don\'t state opinion as fact. Argue calmly and
rationally. Don\'t slander others because their opinion differs from yours.
Consider why it differs. You may not change one another\'s veiwpoint, but
you\'ll learn something.

The only thing you\'ll learn from personal attacks is what a punch in the
mouth feels like.

The above is, of course, my personal opinion. You are welcome to

	Leroy. Please. Try following your own argument. In response to the
complaint "The stats don\'t tell me the crew" your response was "But the
artwork does."  Now you\'re saying you can\'t use the artwork to figure out
the crew? Tch tch. Ok. We\'ll assume your first response was wrong, and your
second was right. The artwork does NOT tell anybody what the crew is, nor
do the stats. Where do I find this information (or are you simply going to
claim that no REAL referee or Traveller player would be interested in this
information)?

	The question is indeed relevant if someone is using the supplement, and
needs to know the crew complement of the Industrial Grav. Furthermore, you
have already told that referee he can figure out the crew complement of a
vehicle based on the drawing (well, then you also told him he couldn\'t, but
we\'ve already discussed that, and I\'m trying to give you the benefit of the
doubt ...). Now, without even trying, I can think of a handful of
situations commonly encountered in gaming where it is necessary for the
REFEREE to know the number of occupants of a vehicle, regardless of whether
the players know, and I really don\'t consider myself that imaginative, as
referees go ...

	You\'re evading the question, Leroy. What if the players ENCOUNTER one
(like you said above, you\'d treat it as an encounter), and the occupants
for some reason decide to get out of the vehicle to confront the players?
How many occupants get out? (Punch Line: "If one more person goes in, the
house will be empty"--who knows the joke?). What if the players in SOMEBODY
ELSE\'S campaign decide they need one (since some other referees might
actually tailor their games somewhat to the players ...)

	Furthermore, in a discussion of the value of a supplement to the gaming
community, it seems highly arrogant to state that, since none of YOUR
players would do something, therefore nobody else\'s should. Long-time
Traveller players and members of the TML should have a fair idea of how
much variety there is out there ...

	Which is why most of your replies come across as personal attacks? Hint:
Criticism of an opinion is not criticism of the person holding the opinion,
and doesn\'t warrant attacking the critic. Second hint: I don\'t know you,
and have little opinion about your personality, your morals, your
character, your intelligence, or your worth. I\'m specifically addressing
statements you have made, and trying to understand the logic involved.
Because, based on the type of logic I\'ve been taught, I\'m having trouble.

	YOUR memory is flawed. It was the *Aslan* who were demoted from Major Race
status when it was discovered that the Aslan stole their jump technology
from a captured starship (Solomani, IIRC).

Orders of knighthood are set out in one of Megatraveller books (so they

before.  Someone with the text (mine\'s in storage) should post them.

	The Foucault-class biological warfare vessel?

	Reminds me of this seminar I did back in my BA (anthropology).  I
was stuck with a bunch of raving pomoids...  I delivered my class
presentation, which was well recieved, and in the Q&A period afterwards I
raised the fact that actually, I had real problems with the scholarly use
of the term "discourse", since I had been able to use it repeatedly before
the class for about 45 minutes without even having so much as bothered to
look up a definition of it when writing the presentation.

	I of course reassured the prof that I would do so before writing
the paper :).

	Ye gods, man, what are you on?!



	I mean, the recoil is just _way_ too high for a crotch-mounted
weapon.  Any human with exterior genitalia would be completely
incapacitated if they fired it.  I could see it working if you toned the
recoil down to 2 or 3, and added some weight to compensate for a
carbon-steel kevlar-lined codpiece like the one in _From Dusk \'till
Dawn_,though.  It\'d look really cool with a lot of chrome studs.  I think
you\'ve discovered another shortcoming in FF&S2; the stocks & sights section
doesn\'t include pelvic mounts.  And the rules don\'t provide DM\'s for firing
with one weapon in each fist plus one of these.  It\'s too bad...

	And if one of my characters ever finds himself being flirted with
by a Sayat in the spaceport bar, he is going to run, not walk, back to the
ship and hide under his bunk clutching the biggest gun on board until they
jump out of system :).

Hello,
  His SF is (IMO) excellent, and the books on the Vang all handle
the background and the Vang presence differently enough to avoid
the impression of "over-serialization".

  OTOH, giving FS access to "...the Military Forms" names and
conceptualizations for small arms might not be a good thing.

While I love the idea of the totally reflective jump bubble... wouldn\'t
the big honkin\' fusion plants on most starships mean that, after a full
week of total reflection of infrared, etc., the ship would emerge from
jump space as a pile of molten slag? 

I can just see checking how close you are to jump emergence by sticking a
skewer of marshmallows out the airlock....

Um, all this had to do with how ships are being deployed
for military purposes alone (and how useful that would be
for stopping piracy).  So the patrols we are talking
about are not patrols to shoot up piracy, but to note
that an enemy fleet has appeared and report back.
Similarly, the second paragraph was about how long
a small ship trying to seek fights would last in
a war.

I can\'t remember you giving anyone a "tire count" regarding EV.  They asked
some questions and your reply was usually "irrelevant".  This isn\'t
multiple choice.  I hope you didn\'t use that answer on your mid terms.

How can the art be "eye candy" now, when you clearly referred to it in
earlier posts essentially as "data" (regarding using the pictures to
determine "obvious" things like crew compliment, number of wheels, etc.)?

Why not just do away with the stats all together and just publish a book of
pretty pictures?  Because most Traveller players want information that
meshes with the game rules, not a bunch of drawings-- to which the referee
must apply game stats like armour, speed, endurance, etc. "on the fly".
Players ask questions... and they expect consistent answers.  Without hard
facts, you cannot promise this with brief descriptions and a few pictures.

Strange that IG managed to get it right with EA by having the correct
picture listed next to each weapon description, or in the original
Traveller Book, with its matching starship descriptions and pictures (most
of which were drawn by Mr. Keith, and which have become Traveller "canon"--
hardly "eye candy").  EV is a technical book with pictures meant to
represent some of the vehicles (as the layout would have you think).  It is
not a bit of fiction with random images thrown in to occupy what would
normally end up as white space anyway.

But the question *is* relevant (to Doug), regardless as to what he wants to
do with that information.  It may not be relevant to *you*.  Doug may be
playing a military type that has basic knowledge of said vehicle.  Now you
have to come up with an answer on the fly because Doug\'s character wants to
evacuate a large number of refugees (more than the vehicle\'s compliment,
whatever you choose it to be).  Now what if he needs to do the same thing a
year or so later and you come up with a different answer?  Poor \'ole Doug
begins to lose face in his referee.

It seems that you run your campaign quite a bit differently than many on
this list.  I would say that you are the exception, not the rule.  As for
the majority of us TMLers that would like these simple tidbits of
information that have been included in many similar products before (and
which were originally submitted with many of the designs), it should be
available.

Granted, there is a variable line where information becomes irrelevant to
/most/ Traveller players, but I\'m sure that many of them would have
preferred a book with fewer, more descriptive entries, than what EV gave
us.

Again, it may be "irrelevant" to you and your campaign but the information
should still be included for those that want it and have gotten used to
seeing it in previous incarnations.  Doug asked a *very* simple question
and you couldn\'t answer it with your copy of EV.  To me, that is a visible
flaw.

Why should they be up to the referee to decide?  These vehicles were
originally designed with a design system that included all of the info
people are now asking for.

I doubt many are willing to spend $25 US ($33 CAN) simply for an "idea
book" that was supposed to cover physical equipment in detail.  I purchased
Shadowrun\'s new 170+ page rigger/vehicle book the last time I was in my
FLGS and found it to be *far* superior to EA-- and it was only $27 CAN.

If you consider any information about Traveller to be useless, then by that
I assume that you are the type of person that prefers real facts.  Strange
that EV doesn\'t seem to provide very much of that.

Apparently, you can always find the silver lining, no matter how dark the
clouds.  There is a point, however, when even the brightest silver won\'t
help a dark and dreary product like EV.  Hey, that\'s heavy...

I tried and tried, but I finally had to get a neighbour to compose this
email, since "it was just too difficult for me".  After all, it hard to
understand one of your posts when you keep twisting words around and going
off in bizarre tangents.

Oh dear... (looking towards the TML camera, shaking head slowly)... for
someone who claims to be so "intelligent", Leroy sure has trouble with the

Excuse me!?!  Line-by-line notation is proper netiquette when responding to
lengthy posts (to keep replies next to their appropriate subject).

Oh, and feel free to challenge my opinions.  Contrary to what you believe,
I can take it.

Key:
Designation ---- The FF&S2 (NATO) designator for the round.
Enrgy ---- The nominal muzzle energy of the round.
D ---- The nominal Traveller (T4) damange of the round.
Common Name ---- The commonly-used name or designation of the round.
Reference Weapon - The designation of the weapon used to determine the recoil.
Mass ---- The loaded mass of the Reference Weapon.
Recoil ---- Recoil values for single-shot, 3-round burst, and full
auto.

If recoil numbers are missing for burst and full-auto fire, that indicates
that
the reference weapon wasn\'t capable of either burst or automatic fire.

Based on the above, I\'d suggest using something like the following scale
for recoil values

1-Hand     2-Hand
Recoil     Recoil    General Effect
0          0         Negligable recoil, no effect.
1-2        1-2       Light recoil.  Almost all shooters can control weapon.
3          3-4       Average Recoil.
4-5        5-6       Heavy Recoil.  Large/strong shooter or special techniques
6+         7+        Extreme Recoil, unusable by some, uncomfortable for most.

Note that the recoil scale is pretty coarse, and makes some (IMHO) errors.  
For example, I\'ve got experience with .22 target pistols, various 9mm 
automatics, and the Colt Government.  IMHO, the .45 recoil is harder to 
control than 9mm, and definitely much heavier than the .22.  The recoil
scale puts the .22 and the .45 as the same, on the light side of average,
and rates the 9mm as heavier.  This is because of the relatively massive
..45; .45 and 9mm ammo have the same energy.

Hmmm.  I\'m getting my mail from the TML OK.  I received a message from

That \'foreign language\' is American ... and refers to the sports of football
and baseball (known in your country as ... er, well ... not known in your
country).  This is because the rest of the world doesn\'t follow the ANSI
standard for \'football\', and insists on applying the term to some sport that
is involves kicking a ball with your feet.  \'Baseball\' also seems to be 
unknown Over There as well, although it\'s been adopted by the Japanese (it
must

The discourse which can be defined is no po-mo discourse, grasshopper.
Only by engaging the totality of the field of narrative power relations can
"discourse" be constructed.

I wrote a module for Kant Generator Pro=81 once that randomly wrote
=46oucaultian text.  It still didn\'t have that je ne sais crock of His
Baldness, but it was fun.

Enough of this!  Yes, it\'s true, a single Kristeva-class cruiser could
completely eliminate piracy in the Third Imperium, without recourse to
relativistic Viral/viral rocks or fighters, but the cost is simply too high
to pay.

Yes, the draft existed, but was never published (and therefore, I suppose,
never entered the canon).  I have read it, but it\'s been a few years ago
now.  It includes Book 2 ship designs for both pirate and pirate-catching 
forces of small, non-Imperial interstellar polities in the Reavers Deep area,
and adventure hooks for the referee to build into a campaign.

Also included in the module are rules for moving the pirate-catching forces
around (boardgame-style), and the chances of them encountering the PCs.  The 
assumption is that the available anti-pracy forces are QUITE limited (after 
all, the adventure is intended for use with PCs as pirates). 

>J. Andrew Keith wrote it in 1984 while running Marischal Adventures?Gamelords
>with the intention that GDW publish it as a boxed module

Marischal Adventures was the Keith\'s company, and the module was written
under that letterhead.  The intent was for Marischal to sell it to one of 
the varios Traveller licensees for publication as a boxed module with maps, 
deckplans and counters, similar to the boxed modules GDW produced.  I
presume Gamelords and GDW would have been interested in publishing it.  If
accepted for 
publication, Marischal would have gotten all of the material approved by GDW.

>either called \'Rogues in Space\' or Letter of Marque\'

The particular module you\'re referring to was called _Letter of Marque_.  It
was to be the first module in a series called "Rogues in Space", the series
detailing various criminal occupations in Traveller.  I don\'t believe that
the subsequent modules were ever written.

>not common and isn\'t effective without the support of wealthy backers or

Right.  This particular adventure takes place in Reavers\' Deep, which is
not part of the Imperium.  Back in the \'Land-Grant\' days of Classic Traveller,
Reavers\' Deep belonged to Marschial Adventures.

>This could provide an answer to the piracy question 

Not definitively.  It was never published (and possibly never recieved final
approval from GDW - the materials I read were unclear on that subject).  THe 
module was designed with CT (book 2) assumptions about starships and 
interstellar trade - the overall flavor of the module would fit best in the 
kind of a universe where the total Imperial forces are a squadron of
Kinunirs per subsector.

Thanks for the post.  Most of the time I am amazed that the systems do turn
out results bearing even a passing resemblence to real world figures.  I
think this a credit to the design protocols in general.  I must see if I can
come up with limits on sustainable rates of fire and cooling systems., Not
that this is is an issue in most games.  However since the maximum rates of
fire "at the rapid rate" was 200 rds a minute , and barrels were normally
required to be changed at 2-300 rounds, (in am M60)( to avoid cook off and
and barrel wear),it riases some interesting points.  A Water cooled machine
gun could fire ad infinitum at these rates, But I really would not want to
carry these things around.

Not to mention how *big* marshmallows will get in a vacuum (at least, for

Could a large marshmallow dispenser be used as a jury-rigged replacement

Uh?  Eurgh?  We\'ve got _lumps_ of it \'round back.

Oh, yeah.  Those.

>incapacitated if they fired it.

But wouldn\'t there be any advantage from firing closer to the body\'s center
of gravity?  I\'m not up on firearms.  Seems to me that a carefully-designed
harness to distribute the recoil over a larger surface would help, too;
it\'s not going straight up your arm/into your shoulder.  Is this at all
correct?

Adding an inertial compensator to the PMPP brings the recoil down to
2-something, I think.  For those of you who just aren\'t quite _femsch_
enough to handle the real thing.  A laser version would avoid the recoil
problem, but would be prohibitively heavy for the same "zap", and lack the,
er, explosive effect.

(No, there is _no_ double-ended version.  I don\'t know where you people are
getting such sick and disgusting ideas.  It\'s double-BARRELED, the new
model.)

In certain senses, I think the PMPP is the ultimate distillation of the

I suspect there\'s Imperial legislation prohibiting Sayat visitors from
packing.  :|

But do watch out for weirdos in trenchcoats.  The PMPP adds a whole new
dimension to "flashing".

Well I guess the weather helps, but not by a lot.  The Finns stil use the
Maxim \'08, and did throughout the Winter War and Continuation War.
Portability has been the demise of the Water cooled machine gun, although
many armies retain them in stores.

I dunno.  I grew up on all of \'em and I still like Heinlein (early rather

Its this small change in biochemistry coupled with the viewing of a
jumpspace bubble that really makes the symptoms of jump sickness
noticeable.  Since most everyone will be sick after a misjump, there is
definitely something that hits *everyone* to some degree (mostly
unnoticeable in a normal jump).  This minor disturbance is all the more
aggravated by actually looking at jumpspace.

Its like seasickness.  You can get queasy in the cabin of the ship, then
you look out the porthole and it really hits you. Jump sickness isn\'t a
dementia as much as complete all-the-way-to-the-neurons disorientation. 
Mental seasickness writ large.

In re: Orders of Chivalry and various grades of knighthood (or dame-hood).
According to Debrett ( a source of great use in Traveller &constant
amazement to me)
There are multiple grades of orders of chivalry (knighthood)

The senior most grades (read most prestigious) do not have seperate
classes.

The junior grades do often have multiple classes.
The British currently use the following classes for junior orders of
chivalry. 
In ascending order of prestige.
1.	Knight
2.	Knight Bachelor
3.	Knight Commander
4.	Knight Grand Commander
5.	Knight Grand Cross.
(Boy, you should see the rats nest that was 
pre-revolutionary Imperial Russian or China)

Also, please note that several meritorious orders, 
decorations and medals also grant entitlements
and the right to have lot\'s of neat little letters after a PC\'s name.

So, in my universe	
Brig. Lord Sir Sri Arunda, K.C.M.G., I.C, O.M.S.M., I.M. (ret) 
would translate into.
Brigadier - Lord (honorary title) Sir (knight hood prefix) NAME, 
Knight Commander of the Order St. Michael & St. George (junior order of
chivalry) 
IC = Imperial Cross (decoration of highest rank) 
O.M.S.M = Order of Merit of the Spinward Marches (decoration of lower
rank), 
and IM = Imperial Marines retired.

I\'ve got a great deal more of this sort of material if anyone has any
use for it. 
Please let me know
Thanks

2) checks for Sylean orbital licensing requirements
3) adds external power socket (for supplying power to other
vehicles/trailers)
4) fixed some formatting problems
5) added option to prohibit stacked g-compensators
6) added option to export both HTML and text files at once (saves steps)


I would like to retire CSC and concentrate on FFS2 and Metator.  You folks
can expedite this process by helping me design the menu/dialog box structure
for FFS2.  Those of you that want expandable rules should specify how you
want the interfaces to work, too!

Okay, maybe it is not totally reflective. Maybe just reflective to visible
light and the evil n-rays of jumpspace. :-)

To run with this, though -- what are other handwaves that allows a ship to
radiate energy when in jumpspace? If the jump bubble isolates the ship from
jumpspace, then would you think any radiation would be able to escape at
all?

I would think a one-way transfer of energy would be difficult. Can you say
"white globe" anyone?

And the more I think about it, what would jumpspace be like, anyhow? I
mean, is it full of an etherial substance (like the ether or phlogistan)?
Is it a 5d (and higher) void? Is it full of hot radiation and protomatter,
like our own young universe? What is it that the jump bubble protects
against? And how does it do so? Is it a force field, or is it just the
boundary of a pocket universe created by the jump drive?

If jump is analogous to "pinching-off" your own little 4d pocket universe,
you still run into the problem of radiation, don\'t you?

If it is an energy screen, easily breached by contact like some seem to
suggest, then I suppose jumpspace must be a void or near-void. What is it,
then, that is so dangerous about jumpspace, anyway? (Azathoth and his court
don\'t count)

I know, I know -- there is no such thing as jumpspace in the real world.
It\'s a great-big, monstrously gigantic, overstuffed barneysaur of a
handwave. But I want to have a consistant illusion (delusion, fantasy,
verisimilitude, what have you :-). I hate the "here there be dragons"
approach.

Hmm. I am liking the idea of non-canon instant jumps better and better all
the time! :-) If it weren\'t for that dang xboat/transfer of information
problem, I could have it all!

Somewhere between CT and T4 it was decided that consuming a minimum of
10% of a ship\'s mass at the moment of jump was simply too much to
accomplish in such a short period.  It was decided that the excess
hydrogen would act as ballast, surrounding the ship as it traversed
jumpspace.

As I stated in response to Joseph\'s post:

Perhaps the mass of the hydrogen jump fuel/ballast (which occupies the
remaining space inside the jump bubble) absorbs radiated heat energy.
Upon returning to N-space, the hydrogen would be released.  The math &
physics of this I leave up to Leonard and the rest of the "I\'ve
Memorized Pi Club" :)

And to quote Steven Wright: "I put tape on the mirrors in my house so
I don\'t accidentally walk through into another dimension."  See, even
Steve\'s got an inkling into what the barrier into jumpspace looks like

Hello,
  Yes, but as indicated since, those same or similar patrols
would almost certainly also be tasked with detecting and/or
interdicting enemy commerce raiders or intelligence gathering
missions. It\'s perhaps hard to justify that those units would
be unable to deal with piracy at the same time as their usual
peacetime patrols.

  BTW, have you had any further luck with coming up with what
sources (besides merchants pirating on the side) would provide
hulls, especially larger ones, for piracy inside the 3I?

	Surely you jest sir? Proper football (or soccer as you dear chaps mutate
it) is played by countless many more people than the gridiron version. I do
like American Football myself, (especially as I saw the London Monarchs
stride past everyone in 1991) but to say it is more popular in the world
than soccer is grossly incorrect. Also, please note how much more succesful
MLS is in your country than the World League of American Football is here
and the rest of Europe.

	Soccer has been adopted by the Japanese as well, and they have a very

It depends which canon you look at really.
In the SOM it states that transponders have an on/off switch which can be used
if necessary, but the ship doing it must have a good reason (ie. being
attacked
by pirates etc.)
Military ships have a transponder which can broadcast any ID they like :)

If the transponders have an on/off switch you can switch it off when leaving
imperial space.

>I think transponders should be overhauled before piracy eliminated.

I\'ve been thinking about transponders for a while now, here\'s what I\'ve
come up with so far:

For those of you who don\'t know, here in Great Britain our Car 
registration numbers (licence plates) carry more information than 
just a unique code for each vehicle. One of the letters shows the 
year of registration, this year it\'s an R, next year it\'s S and so on.
(O and I are missed out to avoid confusion with 0 and 1, and Q is
reserved for special cases).
Also another two of the letters represent the place of registration,
leaving the last letter and numbers to make each registration unique.
A large database is maintained containing all this data, but just by
looking at a number plate you can actually find out alot about a car,
and this is only using 4 letters and 3 numbers.

Applying this to traveller, each transponder could broadcast a code 
that contains the exact type of ship, it\'s size, it\'s exact date and
place of registry, it\'s current owner, any other detail you care to 
mention. If you then encode this infomation into a string of numbers
and letters, eg.

4572WAYWARD_DREAM100SCJ2M11211105SM1910JAMESONR123456789

This decodes as:
4572WAYWARD_DREAM = Wayward Dream (the number is used if two ships have the
same name)
100 = 100 tons
SC = Scout 
J2 = Jump 2
M1 = Maneuver 1
1211105 = 121-1105 Date of registry
SM1910 = Place of registry (Regina (1910) Spinward Marches)
JAMESONR123456789 = The imperial ID of the registered ship owner
(All characters who have left their homeworld in my traveller games
must have an imperial ID, effectively a passport).

You don\'t need to maintain a totally up to date database of ships.
If a ship jumps into a system before it\'s records have arrived, it 
will be obvious because of it\'s ID, and the authorities will probably
investigate the ship to check it matches it\'s ID. A new ship jumping 
ahead of it\'s records is going to receive a lot of attention from
the imperial authorities, but that\'s just one of the problems of
living in a bureaucrasy :)
This problem can also be avoided by registering a ship while it is 
being built, the details of the ship will be spread for many weeks
in front of the ship.

Faking ID\'s is a problem, there are several ways to make the codes 
more difficult to fake. One of the easiest ways to do this is to add
a few characters to the end of the ID as a "check code" this is 
calculated from the rest of the code using a simple formula,
similar to liceincing codes for software.
(If anybody wants such a formula I can provide one).

Obviously the formula is only known by the authorities, this will
catch quite a few amature ID fakers. Eventually the code will leak out
and someone will work out how to fake a correct ID, but random checks
to see if ID\'s have been tampered with should stop the majority of
people tampering with their transponders (provided the penalty is
suitable harsh enough).

This system of transponder ID\'s is not perfect, but it is good enough
for someone to need a very good reason to mess with their transponder.

Comments?

J.

Note: Just a little side point of interest, the SOM says
"No vessel, military or otherwise, is required to detail it\'s armament
or defenses on it\'s transponder ID".

	Kewl.  Although I don\'t know whether recreational substance abuse
is covered under the 5th goal for Traveller in the T4 introduction.  That
nasty "wholesome" word came up, along with something about "eliminating
gratituous violence and sexual content" or words to that effect.  I\'m sure
they meant to cover drugs too.  Note the inexplicable absence of drug drug
in the T4 pharmacopaeia.

	Oh well... it was an IG product.  It was probably a typo.  I\'ll be
a good little Heinlein fan and take those lumps!

	Actually, this would be a major advantage in zero G.  Aside from
the recoil, someone, especially a someone with a relatively lower center of
gravity than the average male human, could probably fire one of these
babies unbraced without going into a tumble.

Read (or re-read) "And He Built A Crooked House..." by Heinlein. At one

something like "It wasn\'t black, black is a color. This was *nothing*"

Ah! But were they the ones she wrote under pseudonyms? For example, she

"Sleeping Beauty" trilogy under the name A. n. Rocquelare (sp).

These books are *quite* different from her Vampire books. :-)

Trouble is, j-space *has* to be pretty darn black. If it isn\'t, you\'ll
fry in your own juices before the week is out.

The perfect mirror is the *worst* possible situation. If it was true,
the ship couldn\'t get rid of *any* heat. And all other radiation
emitted by the ship would wind up as heat fairly soon. So by the end of
the week, the ship would have achieved thermal equilibrium... somewhere
around dull red heat.

David Brin wrote a short story that hinges on this exact situation. A
"hyperspace" that ship\'s pass thru and that has a "background temp" of
around 300K.

There is a realy cool film, produced by Channel 4 IIRC, that is about
undercover police infiltration of football holigan gangs, which ends with
one policeman "going native". This is the original ID ... so ID4 must
translate to Indipendence Day 4th July, but then wouldn\'t that be ID47 ?
or even ID74 ?  ;-) (dependent on how you view the dateing system).

I developed Glisten/Glisten into a pretty cyberpunkish place.  Fairly
liberal gov\'t, Asteroid Belt mainworld (gives rise to lots of "indoor"
venues, slimy city-like locations), High technology (putting the "cyber" in
the punk), etc.

Stayed away from the psionics this campaign though.

I processed a grant application to NIH the other day that proposed
researching a "planar MRI" machine which would be smaller and not as
claustrophobic as the MRI machines currently prevalent.

The scanner would be a flat "bed" rather than a tunnel, and use the
properties of magnetic fields to "wrap" the patient in the detecting field.

So, at TL9 (since this is experimental TL8) lower the weight and increase
the pricing a bit.

While I don\'t know for certain, I suspect that the majority of vehicles in
EV were NOT designed using FF&S2.

This is, at least in part, my fault - the original plan was to solicit
designs from the playtest group and here on the TML.  However, FF&S2 didn\'t
hit the stores until after the deadline for EV, and I failed to generate
enough designs (or recruit enough designers) to fill the book by the
deadline.  I didn\'t give it a high priority because I didn\'t recieve a

work at the time (from a long-standing, well-paying customer of mine).

Some of the vehicles in the book were designed by FF&S2 playtesters (these
should be credited to the appropriate designer), but the rest were
generated by IG staff, and I don\'t know what procedure was used to come
up with the numbers.

What do you mean "Greg was forced into". My take on this was that Greg put
it in himself after doing some research (read curve fitting) on WWII HE
rounds vs armour. The cube root thing totally contradicts his own 3G3 so I
see no reason why it was put in - not well supported by real world data and
(worst of all) made armour MUCH harder to use for "ad hocing".

Hmmm, if i might interject here - why would you have to indicate your
maneuver or jump types - its of no interest to anyone else and can take
away your chance of surprise if you needed to outrun someone - Also you
would have to have the transponder updated everytime you change the
engines... 

And the registration ID is kinda cool but with trillions of citizens it
would be difficult to process that kind of data to be reliable - it would
make creating your own ID very easy... 

I guess I seem to feel different about how certain star systems appear - I
like to portray a Class A starport system as something like one of our
extremely busy airports - there are starships landing and launching almost
every 10-15 minutes... this makes for an extremely busy area of space and
no possible way that the imperium is going to stop every ship to inspect
it on some hunch that someone might possibly smuggle a few Mcr worth of
something into the system... They might make spot checks but that might be
like 1 ship out of every 25 or so... maybe more...

Lets see if a Class A starport has 100 pads for instance and an Orbital
Facility for repairs and docking (lets say this can hold another 50
ships).. that would mean you have anywhere from 50-75 ships departing
and arriving every 15-30 minutes - of course some will be offloading cargo
and supplies - some may need longer times to load cargo some shorter...
most must have cargo and passengers already waiting for departure - so
once they are refueled and loaded they are off and on there way...

Yes but if you change your mind on the type of engines in your code then
it might not ever be changed at one of the locations that recieved if
before and if you go there you ID fails to match and ooops we are so sorry
to have bothered you it was in our error...

Yes but player characters are never the norm are they - they possess
skills between the members to pull off "tampering" with a transponder -
gee if i was the players all i would do is locate some military grave yard
of mothballed ships and remove a transponder - or find another similar to
the one i have - and mess with it until i get it right - heck if no other
reason then to screw my competitor because now he is operating with out a
transponder and must explain to the authorities "well it was there when we
came in - yeah right, we heard that one again"... 

I guess I have seen this discussion stay on this list maybe to long - it
is just a game - and piracy and such things add to the game - besides I
just ending up multipling all the cargo rates by 10 or 15 -- increases
there worth and allows more people to afford ships - because you can make
your monthly payments - this keeps my players honest for most of the
time...

Yes! 

I\'m being serious here - there are only two possibile reasons for
Leroy\'s behaviour: one, he\'s trolling or two, he doesn\'t understand
the fundamentals of having a discussion with other people.

I have yet to see a shit-disturber on USENET that didn\'t fit into
one of these two categories (or both!).

At any rate, I think it\'s safe to leave him alone. At least,
I promise to try.

I\'m afraid it\'s a transrational, er, transnational effort.

Yes, hm, the more I think of it, the more I realize I will, after all, have
to buy _FF&S2_ in order to design a new class of vessels, the discursive
cruisers:  the impenetrable _ISS Derrida_, the florid (yet genial)
_Baudrillard_, and the cruelly mocking _Foucault_.  Each attended by a
swarm of American tenders and disposable small fighters...  Oh ho ho.

Yes, you\'re right, I\'m glad I\'m not drinking a coke right now.

Now, now, now... the Sayat aren\'t "sexually deviant"; they\'d argue that
it\'s Homo sapiens sapiens and H. s. vilanensis (etc.) that are the wretched
mutants.  Clearly the result of genetic manipulation by ancient, lurking
alien Evil.  How else could normal humans have ended up with half their
populations suffering from a severe genetic disease?  The entire Y
chromosome is obviously of alien manufacture; who _knows_ what it really is
intended to do?  Eh?  Think about it...  "Y" chromosome?  Whose name starts
with a "Y"?  Yes...

Just as the Vargr were "provolved" into sentience, the hominids on Earth
and Vland were clearly _devolved_ into a more animalistic state.  Look at
how fast they breed ---- like livestock!  And they have entire _litters_ of
babies!  And they have buzzy voices; barking, like dogs!  How unnatural!
For these heinous crimes, the Secret of the Ancients must be discovered
with "extreme prejudice".

I took inventory at my local game store last week.  They just got in a
few TNE supplements.  Most of these are brand new, and a couple are
used.  In most cases, there is only one copy of each item.

Like many other GM\'s on this list, I find the TNE supplements helpful in
my 1100\'s campaign.  If I was ref-ing a M0 game, I\'d probably find them
even more useful since the backgrounds are so similar.

If you are interested, e-mail me in private.  I\'ll send you a list of
what they have with a short description of what\'s included in each book
(for those who inquired privately recently, the Aliens of the Rim Vol. 1
book is already sold).
  
I will pick these items up for anybody who wants them for the price of
the book, tax, and postage.

Humor?  Oh, you were _kidding_...  The Sayat have many fixations, but in
this case it\'s simply a matter of slightly flawed intercultural
communication.  Not having dangly bits themselves, why not come up with a
more useful, more rugged, more destructive equivalent?  It should help them
win acceptance among these half-human "Imperials" and "Solomani" --
shouldn\'t it?

I\'m still wondering what the status of psychology and psychiatry (et al.)
in the Third Imperium is, particularly after the Psionics Suppressions and
the Frontier Wars get under way.  Have any thoughts on this?

>But whatever you do, please, PLEASE keep this away from Hengie and the

Actually, it\'s all part of a diabolical Sayat plan.  Charm Famille Spofulam
with the SHREP armored pram (with anti-hijack system); sell them a fleet
for use in the FS creches.  Then introduce the PMPP; impugn the manliness
of those who are afraid to fire it without intertial compensators.  Hengie
and other male Spofulams will be reproductively incapacitated.  Sayat
agents will seize remote control of the prams containing Spofulam spawn and
reroute them to waiting getaway ships.  In a single swoop, the Concourse
will have acquired a young, malleable population of psychopathic geniuses,
and prevented the competition from producing more.

Often described as a "bare-bones box with an engine," the Ziv van is
optimized for one purpose: delivery of goods within an urban area. Its total
lack of comfort, environmental controls, and speed render it useless in
extreme climates and the countryside.

Small and relatively cheap, the Mavros is typically operated by charter
companies serving medium-distance shuttle routes. Roomy seats and a built-in
wet bar ensure a comfortable trip for passengers. While not fast enough to
compete with express aircraft, the Mavros is considerably cheaper to own and
operate, and admirably serves its niche.

Military commanders frequently need detailed information about opposing
forces. Before the advent of surveillance satellites, long-range aircraft are
the best means of acquiring this data. The Albatross is an early example of
the long-range spy plane. Slow and unarmoured, it relies on a stealthy
profile for survival. Its relatively low cost allows for multiple missions
over the same target to ensure success.

Small and fast, the Whippet exemplifies a new concept in armoured warfare
tactics. With a maximum speed rivalling that of wheeled vehicles and armour
proof against small-arms and light crew-served weapons, the Whippet is
eminently suited for the newly-developed blitzkreig tactics.

Aimed at the luxury market, the Wanax resembles an old-fashioned yacht more
than a modern grav car. Up to a dozen passengers travel in luxurious style,
pampered by four stewards, with the latest in entertainment facilities. Full
kitchen and washroom facilities ensure that they arrive at their destination
fresh and alert; state-of-the-art anti-hijack systems and Roadgrid ensure
that they arrive safely.

Styling is very personal. While the basic chassis is a disk, every Wanax is
hand-finished to individual specifications. Most owners choose a theme from a
favourite period of history.

At last year\'s BayCon, I was running a late night Traveller game
(Twilight\'s Peak) when Poul Anderson came in and asked if he could watch.
After an hour, he took over for a kid who had to leave.  We played until
0300, and had a great time.  Poul told me after the game that he\'s
role-played off and on for years, and has always enjoyed Traveller.

Made my weekend.

Stanford University Medical Center is currently testing one of these units.
 It was down when I had my last MRI, but I got to look over the unit, which
is much smaller and far less claustrophobic that a normal scanner.

If you\'ve never had a MRI, the experience is similar to being stuck in a
drop capsule while the Grateful Dead\'s drummers jam at about 110 decibels.
I kinda like it.

I don\'t know how to break this to you folks, but... we had baseball 
here _first_.  It was played for many years in Derby, England;
indeed, until this autumn Derby County F.C. played at a ground called 
the Baseball Ground, \'cause -- you guessed it -- it\'s where baseball 
used to be played.  A looong time ago.

Not unknown, just forgotten.  Maybe we thought cricket was more 
exciting.

Funny you should ask that.  One day after receiving the "Bilanidin Bold" 
font, i decided to decode some of the script found in various T4 
publications.  In Psi Institutes, in the scene where the psion is lifting 
the object with many citizens around him watching.  If you look at one of 
the signs it is a COKE advertisement!  The Coca Cola company survives into 
the 3rd Imperium!

Coke company may have put its assets into Sylea or a Vilani Megacorp, coke 
may have died out on Terra, or the company split up during the night.

Imagine. Classic Coke became "Traditional" Coke(Vilani) and then a new 
version, Imperial Coke was created on year 0  Not to be confused with Royal 
Crown (RC) which was consumed by various Kingdoms and Pocket empires.

I am going to assume that the Terrans drink Pepsi and Mountain Dew.

The Zhodani drink Barq\'s Root Beer, because the foam goes straight to the 
brain...

I can\'t think of any softdrinks for the Aliens.  Aslan, Vargr, Great

No no no, you\'re doing it again. You cannot avoid a question you don\'t like by 
saying, "in my campaign it doesn\'t matter." Assume, for the sake of this 
discussion, that the compliment *is* important (maybe you\'re hiring it and you 
need to know how many to pay, or you\'re trying to rescue the crew and need to 
know if they\'ll fit on your ship).

> In general, these questions are up to the referee to decide.  Some may not

NO THEY ARE NOT. They are for the designer to determine when creating the 
vehicle, and for any product containing the design to list along with the 
other data. As I\'ve said far too many times already, if you\'re going to make 
up the numbers yourself, what\'s the point of buying the book.

A paragraph ago you said you\'re capable of working out all the details in your 
head, instantly. Now you\'re saying you\'re so incapable of thinking up even the 
*idea* for a vehicle that you have to spend $24 on a book of them?

Marc didn\'t kill them. The author of the adventure, who obviously knew very 
little about Traveller, did. And the IG editor didn\'t spot it. And neither did 
the proofreaders.

Actually, if we continue to follow Terrestrial models, there
would be several ranks within the orders, so that one could be a
Companion, a Knight Commander, or a Knight Grand Cross, for
example, and these ranks would be abbreviated as well, so that
you\'d get

Sir Bruce Johnson, CEG (Companion in the Emperor\'s Guard)
Sir Bruce Johnson, KCLA (Kt. Cmdr. of the Legion of Antares)
Sir Bruce Johnson, GCSS (Kt. Gd. Cr. of the Starship & Sunburst)

If your Order has fortuitous initials, you might be able to make
jokes about it as was done in "Yes, Minister"; the ranks in the
Order of Saint Mich=E6l and Saint George led to these acronyms with
the unofficial meanings:

Companions 			- CMG  - "Call Me G-d"
Knights Commander 	- KCMG - "Kindly Call Me G-d"
Knights Grand Cross - GCMG - "G-d Calls Me G-d"

Oh my god.  He\'s caught onomasticodroptic guatneyitis.  Soon it will
progress to the next stage -- killing off famous science-fiction authors in
At Close Quarters and bragging about how they begged him to do it.

Fortunately, guatneyitis is rarely contagious.  (The more virulent forms
became extinct, thankfully, after they depopulated the First Imperium in
the wake of the Nth Interstellar Wars.)

The problem with this is, if you are using it for ballast, or
cooling, etc., why does it have to be hydrogen?  Why not use
a denser material that can be stored in a smaller volume?

I prefer idea that the jump drive reactor is just a very
low efficiency/high output reaction (which also explains
why a jump drive has it\'s own power supply).

The patrols in question exist to spot an invaision fleet and
immediately jump back to the main fleet with the news.  They
don\'t have to be armed enough to be able to stop a pirate,
be close enough to be able arrive in time to stop a pirate,
or even necessarily be able to reliably spot single ships.
Furthermore, the would exist only within some distance
of the frontier.

I haven\'t been trying.  You must be thinking of someone else.
I see not reason why pirates don\'t just use armed comercial
ships.

	IIRC, the damage values and armor ratings for some of the basic weapons
and armor were established before Greg joined the team, using the "this
feels about right ..." method. Greg then had to try to come up with a curve
to describe the progression ("This handgun will go through armor \'X\'--real
world data says that\'s equivalent to about THIS much steel. And this rifle
penetrates armor \'Y,\' and I know that a realworld rifle like that will go
through THAT much steel. Now how do I come up with a curve that will
generate numbers that say the same thing.")  Although he did also use the
WWII data to which you refer.

I think what Andrew is refering to is an adventure in Anomolies where, in
the background section, the author of the adventure got confused between
the Droyne and Grandfathers children. So, acording to the adventure,
Grandfather killed all the Droyne in an [x] century long war (at least, I
hope I got that right). Whether that is what Leroy is referring to - who
knows? Leroy hasn\'t volunteered any more info on what in particular he is
referring to.

	Wildstar: thanks.  This is incredibly informative.  Just what I was
looking for.

	Incidentally, it occurred to me just this evening that in Trav,
there are probably going to be worlds where conventional chemical
propellants are going to be either unavailable or simply too expensive...
What might be kinda fun is to see some numbers on things like higher-TL air
guns, steam guns, etc, etc.  Just to make a change...

	Ye gods!  This goes somewhat beyond diabolical.  The thought of
Sayat-raised Spofulams chills the blood.  Of course, this raises the
spectre of the female side of the Famille getting vengefully maternal.
This is just all too apocalyptic for my taste.  I think I\'m going to go lie

anathema to u T4\'ers.  Ah well...   RUs to credit conversion even got their
own page so I\'ll use that.  In planning my game, though, i began thinking
about other types of planetary defenses.  (Battle) stations caught my eye, so
i began thinking about the design of them.  
      In low tech  (8/9) these would probably be primarily missle based.  I\'d
see this as being just a ship w/o drives and possibly even w/o crews.  There
could be (relatively) low cost models w/ maybe one or two missle turrets or
bays, remotely operated.   No life support or accomidations would be needed.
Sensors could be in dedicated sensor arrays or seperate stations or big
stations and need only have a radar/ladar or PEMS for targeting on an unmanned
orbital missle launcher.  
        A full blown battle station would be just like a ship, i assume.
Multiple weapons of multiple types.  Screens defenses.  All w/ very minimal
drives to maintain orbit. Would  full manuever drives be necessary?  Maybe go
w/ something cheap like ion drives or something, if the goal is just to
maintain orbit. 
       My next thought was a ship sized meson station.  I\'d see this as being
valuable to my space defense, but is this practical?  or just stick w/ deep
meson sites?  Stations would probably be cheaper than the colossal deep site
mounts. But would they be easily destroyed?  Is there any advantage to a space
based station w/ a meson gun?  or just stick to SDBs and planetary deep mounts
and missles? ditch the whole battle station idea?  
        Assuming battle stations are practical, they could tie into the piracy
thread.  U could drop one off at the 100 diameter limit.  Serve as an
"outsystem" starport/traffic control. 
         I\'ll work up a couple designs but thought that some of you gearheads
are probably much more proficient than me at this though.  Maybe this has
already been chewed up and spit out?

established winner and screw with it.  T4 is Coke Classic.

    The "established winner" was dying.  It needed new blood and bad.  If t4
is Coke Classic, it wouldn\'t have the crap put out it does now.  We wouldn\'t
be hearing grand tales of an imaginary T4.1.  Look at CT again and u\'ll see
how immature the rules system is.  That\'s why T4 isn\'t just a rehash.  CT is
obviously over two decades old.  MT is obviously one.  TRAVELLER needs new
blood and it\'s not gonna get it the way things are.  It doesn\'t matter to me. 
    TNE, IMO, is much better than CT and MT.  MT was all right, but the design
and combat sequences are much better in Brilliant Lances/Battle Rider than
anything t4 has put out.  Combat was not as complicated as it seemed.  Go
through 3 combats and it flows smooth if u\'ve got the intellect of a chia pet.
    The storyline in CT is so damned bland and boring.  The stable Imperium is
boring.  It doesn\'t attract new gamers otherwise in MMT we\'d being seeing
M:1100.    MT had an interesting story and an interesting ending too. : ) All
M:0 is is TNE w/o the Collapse.  U have Wilds, w/ the expansion back into
once civilized space. Pirates et all.  Gurps Traveller should take the us to
alternates.  Better to divorce itself from the boooooring setting completely.
Take us to the Zhodani or center on the Solomani and space to rimward.  
    Interesting how "Coke Classic" has only 6 siders and thruster plates in
common w/ it\'s forebears.   FF&S is far superior to ANYTHING comparable in CT
and MT. FFS2 is just a reworking of FFS for T4.  The TNE aspects are there
cause it\'s a TNE product.  The design sequences in MT?  LOL... i don\'t even
need to go there, do i? CT\'s stuff is obviously novice.  U can see how the
sophistication grows w/ the later and later works.  Kind of like Oriental
Adventures was to AD&D 1st and 2nd Ed.
    Let\'s talk about presentation.  T4\'s stinks.  That foss art.  To say
nothing of the typesetting.  Every one of TNEs books beats the pants off
anything IG has published.                                                    
U may not like the "comic bookish" interior art, but it\'s better than t4s.
TNE is remiscent of AD&Ds products that sold so well.  You have the headers w/
illustrations and a good feel for the game even if u don\'t like the rules or
setting.  T4s stuff (the Hardback and Softback, starships, First Survey, M:
0.) They all look like they came off of an old typewriter.  Pocket Empires
looks ok, but on presentation, T4 can\'t touched TNE yet.
      I\'ve tried to keep quiet and i did through the little snide comments and
the bash at the authors of TNE and their hard sci fi knowledge.  I get fed up
w/ all of the Old Farts and others who can\'t seem to get enough out of kicking
a dead dog.  A snide comment here and derogatory statement there.  I would
think that Traveller is Traveller and u\'d be more supportive.  Very little
that happens in one of your Imperiums is ever gonna be felt in anothers
anyways.  Who cares bout whether *your* Imperium goes into Rebellion,
Collapse, Emperor Dulinor or Lucan or Strephon or Cleon.  Pretty much only you
and *maybe* your players.  I never dogged CT or MT.  Without em there\'d have
been no TNE.  
       I put up through all the whining and ranting on the GDW Beta and here
too w/o comment. I\'m not interested in a flame war, but enough is enough.
       This is just letting some well built up steam blow.  Give TNE a break.
Your dislike of it is well known.  It\'s not like u have to moan about
san*klaas hats anymore.  
        IMO, T4 should do what it was said to be about.  Multiple milieu.  M:0
is not gonna hold up the rules set f/e.  Let\'s see what\'s next, whatever it
is.  Pump out a Milieu book a year, not one every 2 or 3.  It\'ll sell more.
TSR proved that every time a setting gets to a sequential product, sales drop.
make a new setting, big sales.  Popular ones can endure more products.  That\'s
what Traveller always misses.  One Milieu will sink T4, just like one milieu
sank all the others (except TNE which was branching out.  It got sunk by those
damned card games and the shifting market)  Hey i got it!  A pocket empires
card game!  nah... it\'d probably have foss art and a bunch of typos...

Yes, you must avoid High Drug.  You don\'t get high, you just get small,
because everything around you appears to be very high.  Low Drug is not
an antidote; you\'ll get a nasty synergic reaction if you take Low Drug
while you\'re small.  Low Drug will make everything around you appear to
be very low, including the morals of those you meet.  This makes it a
very dangerous drug in polite company.

In one of Poul Anderson\'s stories there is a truly *sick* weapon. It\'s
a sort of blaster built into a prosthetic penis. The bad guys blackmail
the protagonist into using it by performing a bit of surgery and
telling him that *if* he uses it to assassinate the target (some
"rebel" leaders) they\'ll arrange for regenerating the missing part.

Anyway, using this weapon presents a truly *weird* picture. "He

Whooo-eee.... lance that boil.....!!!!

I recently read some classic trav sources...

In classic traveller TL-8 was 1980-1989, available in this era were such
delights as fusion power, anti-grav and lasers.

The air-raft, as listed in the Traveller Book, was TL-8

TL-9 started in the 1990\'s, when we developed jump drives!

My... we were very optomistic!

I played classic trav and I loved it! 
I thought Mega-trav was an excellent upgrade!
TNE was a delight... finally everthing in trav fitted together (scalable
technology)... and it still felt like traveller (although I must admit I
missed the romance of the d6)

I really don\'t understand why TNE wasn\'t used as a basis for T4... but with
all the difficult parts made easier, there was such potential.

hmmm..... 

And I must agree... there are far too many snide side comments on this list
about TNE. I like the system, I use it, I don\'t understand the hostility on
this list to it!
The more TNE gets \'sledged\' the more I feel like sledging T$ .... whoops
T4. But then.... why pick on such a large stationary target!

OK... please stop bashing TNE... (see, I\'m being nice) what\'s the point?
(and your wrong anyway!)

I think that given this Fifth Prime Directive of T4 there\'s not a
snowball\'s chance in -- um, in a very, very bad place indeed -- of that
coming to pass.  Murderously atheistic Commie lesbians (who probably build
fusion-plus powered water pipes with which to abuse drug drug) aren\'t what
you\'d want to bring home to Mom and Dad from the bar^H^H^H game store.
They\'d have to be gutted to the point that they\'re simply
cooperatively-inclined secular humanists in comfortable shoes.  Oh, I
suppose we could let them keep the red pigmentation.  Sort of like all
those pastel-hued dancing girls that Captain Kirk was always after, right?
That\'d be real nice.  (But thanks much for the nomination!)

(And the more I think about it the greater becomes the lurid allure of
identifying "Y"askodray, a.k.a. Grandfather (!), as the ultimate source of
the Patriarchy...)

It\'s those dang Vargr\'s fault, always rolling it down to stick their heads
out...

Yes, certain weirder-than-I TML inmates^H participants suggested prehensile
ovipositors, and from the genetic engineer\'s point of view, existing
erectile tissue would be the reasonable point of departure.  This aspect of
Sayat physiology, at least, I\'m not inclined to define -- Jeff is being
remarkably tolerant in allowing them into _Freelance Traveller_ as it is
<G>.

Personally, I guess I\'ve been conceiving of them as not having this type of
external genitalia; I still prefer the idea that they _need_ a modicum of
technology just to reproduce.  The idea was that their genetic design
wasn\'t without flaws and peculiar lacunae.

OTOH, the Sayat are there for people to take and USE; there\'s absolutely no
reason why they can\'t have home-grown footlong prehensiles.  Given that
I\'ve also written them as having a fairly good grasp of biomedicine and
genetics, it\'s plausible that there\'s a laboratory full of experimental
autoovipositoring Sayat teenagers...

I must confess: it\'s actually all part of a fiendish plot to keep you from

Hello,
  That\'s a remarkably limited picket design - it has one very
specific peacetime and no wartime function. Why don\'t pirates
just hunt these underarmed things for parts?

  No, I was just hoping someone had figured something out along
those lines. I guess negative evidence isn\'t my favourite way
of looking at things. So far I can construct my best case for
armed standard merchants, but that does completely negate the
possibility of successful combat with even a light SDB.

Marc Miller hadn\'t figured in the rise of Po-mo, New age etc that stopped
us from going TL 8 in the nineties (drastic drop in the percentage of
humans capable of rational thought). Just wait a couple of decades like
this and the world will look like Shadowrun ;)

Hey! The most digits of pi I ever memorized was 8. That was all my

need the it to some ridiculous number of places I can look it up

I believe that this was the /original/ canon approach.  Over time,
however, someone (?) began to wonder exactly what type of fusion plant
could burn so much liquid hydrogen in so little time.  The idea of the
liquid hydrogen jump bubble came from that.  I /believe/ this
definition is now canon, although I may be wrong.

I\'m not saying that J-space isn\'t [thermally] black... just that any
barrier designed to prevent J-space physics from interacting with
N-space could easily be argued to *have* to be "reflective" (not that
it would be the best way to go, but I could still argue).  If the
thought of matter and antimatter interacting to produce raw energy
sounds violent, just imagine an interaction between the "physics" of
two different dimensions.  Kinda brings up all that Star Trek "a tear
in the fabric of space" stuff :)

Wasn\'t it Niven that claimed that a stasis field would appear as a
reflective sphere, due to the barrier preventing anything from
entering the region of null-time (including visible light, which would
be reflected back upon the viewer)?  Technically, activating a stasis
field would "create" a new dimension inside it, would it not (a
dimension where time did not exist)?

If we go your way and allow ship occupants to peer out beyond the jump
bubble into J-space, we are allowing photons from J-space to penetrate
into N-space.  I guess you could argue that light in J-space is
physically identical to that in N-space, and that the jump bubble
allows visible light to propagate naturally (like a General Products
hull) while still keeping out all the harmful J-space physics.  But
this is a "handwave".

Traveller already has problems with ships not being able to radiate
enough heat so this isn\'t as bad a problem as it sounds.  It only adds
to it.  Considering the *fantastic* excess heat radiation rates that
current Traveller starships seem possess (via super duper power plant
radiators or whatever), is the liquid hydrogen jump "cocoon" any
closer to being feasible?  IOW, is it a bigger "handwave"?

I seem to remember something like that.

Don,

Well,  Imperium originally (Conflict) sold for $12.  You just MIGHT (humor
intended) get a bit more for it now...  Recommendation:  Keep it!  Most of
us who played it when it originally came out had no clue that it was tied
to Traveller!

The flaw with this is (as has been noted on TML earler) that if this is the
case why isn\'t there ANY inprovement on the fuel efficiency of J-drives as
the TL rises? The fuel consumtion of J-drives is the most important
limiting factor when designing warships and merchants so I\'d say some
serious research money must have been spent here.

My take is that the hydrogen is some kind of mass dumped into jumpspace in
order to enter the ship. If you need a handwave for why it has to be
hydrogen lets say that matter containing neutrons as well as protons causes
severe disturbances for the jumpfield. That is also why fuel purifiers
improve jump - They remove deuterium and He etc. All jump hydrogen is
dumped at jumpentry - this explains why you cannot use water, ammonia etc
to store hydrogen efficiently as you need to dump the superpure hydrogen in
a short time. Ships that has more jumpfuel than what can be used up in a
single jump might well store this fuel as water, ammonia and prior to the
next jump (in hyperspace for instance) crack it into LHyd.

NO you\'re talking about Mr J Pournelle in response to someones post about
Poul Anderson.
 You wouldn\'t see Mr Pournelle playing Traveller (well, perhaps TNE), he\'d
be more at home in "Twilight2000" or "VietVet the RPG".
As for filming Mote that would be great if they choose a good
director/producer. Lets say they talked Ridley Scott into making SF movies
again...

I\'ve always view this as a benefit to the game.  The TL\'s, at least in
my opinion, take into account the "spillage" lower tech planets get from
contact with higher tech worlds.

I mean, if you are a TL 9 world, it seems reasonable to me that things
will be imported, by default, from the ships landing at the local
starport.

It might not even have anything to do with jump drives--maybe its
something that leads to indirectly to jump drives.

For instance (and this is a lame example, but you\'ll get my point), the
groves for rain you see in some road ways were developed as a means to
dry off airplane runways.  It was an afterthought to put them on
interstates as well.

How about the laser in today\'s world?  Look at all the things it\'s found
its way into--medical eye surgery, CD\'s, fine metal etching...this list
goes on and on.

I think Traveller\'s TL codes, whether by design or accident, reflect
this "spillage" and increase in "infrastructure" nicely.

Hmmmm, good point. I included Jump and Maneuver types because of an example
in the SOM. The reason the SOM has them is so military ships can pretend to
be far better than they actually are, if it wasn\'t standard practice to
broadcast these details the bluff wouldn\'t work, would it?

How often do your players have their engines changed? :)
Changing engines isn\'t really a regular occurance, it generally means a major
change to the internal structure of the ship. Having your transponder ID 
updated and your registration changed would hardly be a hassle compared to
actually having the engine fitted.

>And the registration ID is kinda cool but with trillions of citizens it

>make creating your own ID very easy... 

ID are only required for those citizens who leave their homeworld, like
a passport if you don\'t want to travel you don\'t need one. I\'m not suggesting
that a huge database be kept of every citizen. There isn\'t a database
holding everyone with a valid passport on earth. My idea of Imperial Passports
is a document similar to our current passports, getting hold of one is 
difficult it general involves applying to your subsector capital and waiting.
Of course you can always join the military/merchants as a quick way to get
one,
serve four years and leave, this would explain why so many PC\'s are
ex-military
or ex-merchant.

>I guess I have seen this discussion stay on this list maybe to long - it
>is just a game - and piracy and such things add to the game.

Agreed. It is a game. If PC\'s (or NPC\'s) can\'t go around fiddling with 
transponders and faking transponder ID\'s and passports I\'d lose a lot of
plot devices. I also feel that Piracy adds to the game without it my players
would rarely get involved in space combat, I don\'t care about whether it\'s
possible to stamp out piracy. I want pirates in my game so they are in my 
game. 

Similarly I want transponder tampering, so it exists, but I want
it to be difficult and I want to be a risk the players have to consider
carefully before they do it.

I also like to portray the Imperium as a huge bureaucracy that does get tied
up in it\'s own paper work, so having to change your transponder when you
change your ship is suitable for my games.

I do also await another Milieu Book (although here in Germany I think=20
I=B4ll have to wait an additional year for it ...) The Milieu 0 is fine for==20
one purpose: Exploring the now unknown space around the small Imperium.
But it has the problem (for me) that you can=B4t use the Alien Races that==20
as they haven=B4t been contacted yet. So there is missing a whole part of==20
the established Traveller Universe.

Also, I would be interested, if IG wants to go into the New Era Milieu=20
again or if they consider an alternate Timeline as GURPS intends to do.
(Just an idea, Time Travel comes to my mind, so don=B4t sue me, I know,=20
what is the opinion about it - although I could think a not too powerful=20
solution to that)

Hope to see soon of the other Milieus.

Snapshot is a boxed rules game specially designed for shipboard combat.
AHL is a CT supplement, so I think.

AHL was a boxed supplement for CT consisting of (I think) 14 deckplans of
the Azhanti Highlightning, counters, a rules booklet and a scenario
booklet. The combat system used very simple mechanics yet managed to force
the players to plan their strategy. It used stats compatible with Striker I
and had some cool scenarios especially "The great wine heist". Some very
ballsy criminals hidden inside cargocrates were to steal the emperors Tokaj
Escenzia wineload by going to the cargo area and steal a shipsboat and
flee.

In a later unrelated adventure (The Traveller adventure?) in the library
data section a note was that wine could sell as high as 1 MCr per bottle
for some stolen wine with the same name. Presumably the criminals got away
with their heist and were well paid for the effort.

I doubt it. I still post questions about MT to this list and get

	"Why was I not invited?" demands Aslan ambassador. "My clan commands a...

I suppose the TL of a world should never be understood as TL in every=20

higher, others are lower on this world - or the one of the highest branch.
Think of our own world, pre-spaceflight Terra.=20

equipment, although, got better.)
But our Computers seem to get advanced even more and more - assuming TL 9=

is short before, if not even here. I mean - if we=B4re able to put real=20
looking Dinosaurs on the screen - but not able to cross the distance to=20
Alpha Centauri in one week - what tech level should this be?

I remind an article about twisted tech levels in the Challenge Magazine -

  "This is only a tech level 4 world, so it won=B4t be much interesting for=
=20
   us ..."
  "Are you sure? Then explain to me how they=B4ve got this colony on their=

I think this way it was always to be seen.

I find the biggest problems between Traveller editions are the wholesale
mechanics changes, so that MT, while it bore some resemblance to CT, was
not built upon/corrected when TNE was thrust on us. And when TNE died, MMT
went off in its own direction again.

I recently played some AD&D (yes, I was coerced by my gaming group), and I
found it wasn\'t nearly as ungainly a game as I remembered it -- yet it
still felt like it was a direct descendant of the original -- the "flavor"
was still there, with improved, evolved rules. TNE never did this (although
I liked the GDW house rules, I didn\'t find that much Traveller flavor in
them), and T4 does so marginally (again, only MHO -- people\'s tastes and
expectations vary). Wouldn\'t it have been great if CT had been built upon
so that now, we did have 20 years of evolution from the original set?

But I\'m digressing.

Main Point:

I find it incomprehensible that animosity between edition supporters
springs up like this every now and then. I mean, the last few books for TNE
were just as ugly as anything that appeared from IG, while (IMHO) the best
supplements for T4 are about as good as anything that\'s was put out for TNE.

People who don\'t recognize problems in each edition (CT - too basic, MT -
too many typos, TNE, T4....well, we\'re all familiar with those
arguments...) are wearing blinders. If they want to, that\'s fine. We all do
from time to time.

But people who start bleating that they or their system are being picked
upon because others have noticed the flaws seem to be missing the point. I
haven\'t seen anyone trying to push TNE off of TML (although I may have
missed something -- I\'ve been tuning off since the recent flame wars
ignited again). Similarly, I\'m amazed some people seem unable to see that
IG has produced some pure, unadultreated CRAP along with a few fine pieces
(PI, PE).

I\'ve played all versions, and enjoyed all versions. I\'ve been pissed off by
limitations and mistakes in all versions. I\'m currently playing
GURPS:Traveller (my own conversions) because of the poor quality of the
early IG releases, but I am looking forward to T4.1. Hell, IG cashed my
check a while ago for it. :-)

We each have our own Platonic Ideal of what Traveller is and isn\'t. But in
a forum where the exchange of ideas is the whole point, let\'s try and get
over our thin skins as well.

It looks alot better in the worksheet \'cause I use fonts.

Most of it should be self explanatory -
  All weaponry, armor and structure are rated using the USP system in
QSDS/SSDS.
  The mass is Loaded/Clean.
  Crew is M/C, where M is minimal crew and C is complete crew. Minimal crew
    is defined as the crew members needed to just move the ship - it does not
    include maintenance, gunnery, screens, flight, troops, command, steward, 
    or medical. Basically, the ship could go somewhere, but couldn\'t do it\'s
    job.
  Sensors and communications are rated ( N, P ) where N is the
range/sensitivity
    and P is the power used.
  The Maneuver and Contra Grav are Loaded/Clean
  The Power extra data is (MW produced,Fuel duration)
  The Purification extra data is (hours to purify,MW used)
  Accomodations are the number of bunks/small rooms/large rooms/low/emer low
  Life support is the number of man-days of supplies are carried. /Type:
    represents type of life support (in this case standard). /FQ: is the
    food quality (in this case normal). /Sto means food storage is present.
  G-Comp is the number of Gs compensated by the grav plates. If G-Tanks
    are present, they are shown afterward as (/G-Tanks:P,C) where P is
    the number of passenger G-Tanks, C is the number of Crew G-tanks.
    G-Tanks are NOT included in the basic G-Comp rating, even if present.
  ESA is the protection value of the ESA generator, if present followed
    by (/ROD:N) where N is the number of discharges allowed in a turn.
  Sancasters is the number of sandcasters, followed by (/AV:N,/Cans:C) 
    where N is the AV provided by one canister of sand and C is the
    number of cans each sandcaster carries.
  Damper Turrets is the number of damper turrets, followed by (0MW /Rng:N)
    the power used by each turret and the range of each turret, N.
  Damper Screen is the protection value produced by the screen, followed by
    the power use (0MW).
  Meson Screen is the protection value produced by the screen, followed by
    the power use (0MW).
  Force field is the flicker rate followed by (/Acc:N MJ/tn) where N is the
    total number of MJ the field can absorb in a turn. This includes jump
    capacitors as well as dedicated accumulators.
  Gravtics is the number of gravtic systems, followed by (0MW /Sys:N kN)
    where /Sys: is /Tractor:, /Repulsor:, or /Manipulator: and N is the
    amount of force the gravtic can provide.
  Signature is right out of the FF&S2 manual.
  

So....what do people think? 

I think something like this would be useful to define entries for THUDDD 7,
for people using FF&S2.

Please let me know.

"Hold the high ground" has long been a military maxim. With this Orbital
Bombardment Platform, the high ground proves to be a very tangible advantage.
Three ordinance bays can launch up to 660 pieces of guided bombardment
devices, while two rapid-fire autocannons and over 50 missiles protect the
platform itself. Roomy facilities for three crew shifts provide for enhanced
combat readiness for long-term missions lasting up to 1000 hours.

I\'ve been working on expanding out the trade to large scales and was
wondering about a couple of things:

1) Does the Imperium trade with its neighbors?  It would seem likely that
they do, but it is not clear which neighbors would get the trade.  What
thinks the list?  What is the Cannon position on this?

2) I\'d like to get a tally of the sectors that have been detailed, and
where they were published.  It would also be helpful to know what eras
they are relevant to ( for example Diaspora has been detailed for M1100
and TNE).

The "dangly bits" that make crotch mounted weapons such a pain are the

The Commander is referring to a font I created called "Bilanidin". I
uploaded a "beta" version, based on pictures in DGP\'s Starship Operators
Guide to my website, so those on the TravLang list could comment.

I\'m in the process of adding numbers, punctuation, and tonality marks to
the typeface; for now all it contains are the letters a-z.

The font is similar to the equipment detail sheets you mention, but
might not be useful for translating what they mean, since the encoding
seemed to be different from product to product. I used the SOM because
it had the largest sample of the same character substitution.


You can find it at the following URL:

(Mac TrueType version)

<http:\\\\www.geocities.com\\Area51\\8275\\bilani.zip>

Note to TravLang members: PC version works now. Thanks Jo Grant for
converting the Mac version. I still need to figure out what I did wrong
the first time... anyone out there have experience with Fontographer?

Well, baseball dates back to before the US Civil War, so I don\'t know
if that counts as "a looong time ago".

Because hydrogen is simplest, most abundant element in the universe.

<handwave ON>
More complex gasses don\'t react well to the jumpspace interface. They
cause disturbances in the jumpspace field. This is why using unrefined
hydrogen that has trace quantities of deuterium and tritium, instead of
100% pure protium, gives one a possibility of misjump.

Actually, no, it\'s not canon, since the jump ballast theory has never
been published in Traveller materials, afaik.

I think it\'s canon for the TML, though, since most people agree it\'s the
most elegant handwave. :-) It won me over, anyway.

I use the TL detailing rules in MT\'s World Builder\'s Handbook when I
need to find this out.  Those rules do exactly what you\'re describing
here.

For instance, my characters are currently on Pysadi.  The planet is
overall TL 4, but the weapon technology (determined with WBH) is only TL
2.  I have the Pysadian Salvors (guards) running around with staves of
office and one shot flintlock pistols and rifles.

I was really happy when I determined this result (WBH TL detailing uses
die rolls with results based on the planet\'s overall TL) because it
corresponds with the political outlook on the planet about weapons.  I
couldn\'t have done it better if I had just made it up.

Actually, I think the favoured interpretation is that the jump fuel gets
dumped into some different (lower) level of jumpspace to let the ship
ascend to the (higher) level it wants to. (At least that\'s what I favour.)
It doesn\'t *have* to be hydrogen - note that you can jump with unrefined 
fuel, which is basically methane or water - but for subtle quantum 
technobabble reasons it works best if you\'re dumping only protons and
electrons.

You probably do need maneuver drives of some sort (at least a tenth of a G),
since what limits laser range (to first order) is the ability of the target
to evade in the light-travel time of the shot; if you can\'t evade, 
attackers can hit you with lasers from well outside the range you can hit
them. (In BL/BR terms, a station without maneuver drives wouldn\'t get the
- -1 DM/3 hexes - you can easily see how it would get hammered to death by
enemies at 40 hexes or so.)

In addition, without some maneuver capability to change your orbit by a 
fair amount every day or so you\'re very vulnerable to swarms of relativisitic
rocks.

In general, I think any fixed installation smaller than a big asteroid is
too vulnerable - ships are the way to go for defence.

(Although planets may well have large numbers of disposable missile  boxes in
orbit - to pre-position missiles above the atmosphere. There may also be
large numbers of orbiting laser turrets (remote controlled) since lasers
are much more effective if they start above the atmosphere. (There\'s an
argument to be made that grav focus doesn\'t work inside an atmosphere.) 
There\'d be several sensor arrays in orbit too - I guess the picture to go for
is large numbers of small, independent, low-value orbital isntallations rather
than a big battle station crying out for Merrick to hit it with a 0.1c KKM.) 

(Another handy planetary defence trick is mines - you can make a 0.2 m3 
warhead-only mine nearly undetectable in FFS2; seed the close orbit space witht
them as a last line of defence. Control them from the ground.)

Both Snapshot and AHL are both personal combat systems for CT.  I use
Snapshot in my current game.  It fits in beautifully with T4.

All Snapshot does is assign "action points" to every action a PC can
take.  If you want to move, it\'s 1 AP per square (squares are 1.5 meter
grid).  If you want to fire your weapon, it\'s 4 AP\'s to fire a
revolver--more AP\'s are required if you want to fire an automatic
weapon.

Using Snapshot, it really cuts down on the argument of "why can\'t I do
that in a round?"  and "I can surely do all of this before the bad guy
does that".

I introduced it to my group a few months ago, and they love it.

AHL, on the other hand, is a similar tactical system, although it takes
a more abstract stance.  You have APs for actions, but everybody is
given the same number of AP\'s (in Snapshot, AP total is variable,
dependent on your Dex and End).

AHL is a good system--it\'s just a more abstract system than Snapshot.

In my view, CT had four basic ground combat systems.  If you wanted your
normal, free-style type of play that most RPG\'s have (like what T4 has
now), you used the one from the core rule book.

You could get more detailed by adding a tactical element to this same
system, and that\'s what Snapshot accomplished.

Then, there was large scale combat, which Striker covered.  But, Striker
was made for combat outdoors.  Because of scale, buildings are rarely
drawn on the map as individual buildings--rather one large building will
represent several buildings or a warehouse.

There was a need to do house to house combat in Traveller, because
Snapshot would be too tedious when dealing with the number of troops
that Striker uses.

To fill this need, you have AHL--a more abstract personal combat system
allowing you to do individual combat with a large number of people.

AHL is good in any indoor setting--even mutinies aboard large naval
vessels where there are several characters on both sides or boarding
actions.

In sum, CT had:

Free-Style and Snapshot for regular ground combat (depending on how
detailed you wanted to get).

Azhanti High Lightning for personal combat with several characters (when
running Free-Style or Snapshot would take too long for the number of
people involved).

Striker for large scale tactical combat focussing on the platoon level.

Let\'s look at that idea.  Battle stations take the rider idea one step 
further -- by getting rid of maneuver drives, you have more room for 
armor and weapons (and in fact, you don\'t need to worry about how much
armor you\'re hauling around).  Of course, you can\'t evade either, and
the enemy can maneuver to avoid you, among other problems.  

I\'d think you\'d be better off with deep-site meson guns, if you can make
them.  There\'s less support equipment (and hence less cost), you get all
sorts of advantageous DiffMods against detection, and Battle Rider armor
value (AV) is probably 30 or higher.  Part of the reason I made the TL12
facility was to test deep-site viability out.

Of course, who said all your deep-sites have to be located on the planet?
If you\'ve got a convenient moon or two, you can put some there as well.
Then there\'s a whole world of possibilities involving other sorts of 
surface-based planetary defense systems....

What you really should do is set up some scenarios using your ideas and
game them out.  (Oh, and let us know what you do and how it goes!)

Hmmm, I guess this is where we differ - I look at the Imperium as one big
Empire - therefore as long as you are within its borders you are free to
come and go as you choose... Its when you leave you need to have papers -
more or less to prove that you are actually citizens of the imperium - but
for the most part i would wager nearly 10-25% of the population in my
universe moves around from world to world - that would be an extremely
high overhead to maintain track of...

From the MT Referee\'s Companion, pg 34:

300   TL13
700   TL14
1000  TL15

IMHO, the tech level of the Imperium changes when enough Industrial worlds
exist at the new TL to support a wholescale upgrade of the Imperial
Military to the new standard.

T4 is my system of choice, but I use all editions of Traveller (and I
mean all--CT, MT, TNE, T4) in my game as well as some outside stuff
(T2300, GURPS, some other sci-fi RPG games).

Basically, I use T4 as my base rules system, but I pick and choose
equipment, adventures, background, rules from all of these other sources
to enhance my T4 game.

I really didn\'t care for TNE--mainly because it didn\'t "feel" like
Traveller, but I own just about all of the TNE supplements and they are
not going to waste.

It\'s really not that hard to pick something from a previous edition of
Traveller and convert it to your system of choice.  For me, it is easy
to convert from TNE to T4 because T4 is a less detailed, simpler
system.  It would be much more work to go the other way.

But, in general, I like having all of these diverse products to choose
from.  You don\'t have to like them all--but that\'s the beauty of it. 
You can pick and choose what you like best and use it in your campaign.

Recently, I needed to roll up weather for the PC\'s trip through a
forest.  I searched all of my Trav stuff for some rules, and I found
those rules in TNE\'s World Tamer\'s Handbook.

It was no problem at all to roll up weather for my T4 game using these
TNE rules.

If I had shunned TNE because I didn\'t like the system, I would have had
to wing it--because I couldn\'t find any other weather rules (based on a
planet\'s UWP) anywhere else in all the other supplements and magazines I
have.

In sum, TNE is not my system of choice, but the supplements are still
worth having to enhance my game.  I\'m sure the same would be true if I
used any of the other editions as my base system.  I would just convert
the other way.

To me, having the choice is a benefit.  Take starship combat for
example.  With Traveller, unlike any other RPG I know of, I have a good
many options.  I can pick the system that best fits my playing style.

There\'s the starship combat system from basic CT.  You can play with
High Guard if you want to.  And, CT even has Mayday.

Then, you can use the system in MT, if you want another choice.

Not enough?  OK, how about the system in basic TNE, or the improved
version of this in BL?  Want to do fleet battles?  How about BR?

Now, there\'s a new system in T4.  I\'m not sure what T4.1 will have in
it, but Marc has stated that the basic starship combat system in T4.1
will be updated.

And then, there\'s this new T4 space combat system coming out based on
Silent Death.

Still not enough choices?  Look at the RPSCS designed by TML members.

You may not like all of these systems, but the point is that you\'ve got
a lot of choice here.  Whatever you like, you can focus on it. 
Eventhough the Traveller editions are vastly different, the basics
always stay the same.  Starships always have G ratings.  Jump drives
always range from 1-6.

Given this base line, you can focus on one system--your system of
choice--and base your entire game on it, using all of these other
supplements if you want them.

AD&D is an incredibly complicated rules system--if you want it to
be--and there is a multitude of supplements out for the game.  You could
never master all of the rules that are available for that game, and you
are afforded the luxury of customizing your game, using the many
official rules, to your own tastes.

I see Traveller, with it\'s four editions the same way.  For me, TNE (or
CT/MT products, for that matter) are not to be shunned because the game
system is so drastically different from T4.  There is enough
similarities between all the Trav editions to make conversion easy and
worthwhile.

For me, everything that is not T4, from both GDW and licenees, is just
another supplement for my T4 game.

If I was playing TNE, I\'d look at T4 and GURPS stuff as supplements for
that game.

I think the choice is good.  Pick what you want.  Don\'t use what you
don\'t like.

Actually, MT was doing fairly well, as I recall.  There was a push to get
all of GDW\'s systems using one rules set, and a need to resolve the
moribund Rebellion setting.

Since I played in a TNE campaign for the better part of 2.5 years, you need
not sing TNE\'s praises to me.  I still use BL in my Traveller/CORPS campaign.

Through all of that, MT remains my personal favorite set of rules.  Why.
Personal preference.  Simple as that.

The setting is.  How exciting that setting is depends on the Referee and
the players.  Back in the early 80s I ran a campaign that had the
characters working as couriers, lots of intrigue and danger, very exciting
game.  The setting?  Core Subsector.  In the very heart of the stable
Imperium.

There are differences between the TNE setting and the T4 setting.  In the
RC, mankind has been nearly destroyed, trillions died in a span of short
decades, and coldly intelligent starships lurk among the shattered remnants
of past glory.

In Milieu:0, A new dawn has come, and a vigorous young empire is going
where few have tread for a thousand years, bringing unity and hope (and low
cost trade goods!)  There are mysteries and enigmas, and fortunes to be won!

I much prefer scouting an Earth-like planet and trying to figure out why no
one lives there than rooting around a planetary graveyard for cast-off bits
of high technology.

>Take us to the Zhodani or center on the Solomani and space to rimward.

Write it.  That simple.  Contact the editor of JTAS, or Freelance
traveller, or make a pitch to IG or BITS.  Or just do the work and design
your own campaign setting.

T4 has the same characteristics, careers, and feel as CT.  As a user of
both FFS, FFS2, and the MT design sequences, let me say that I found them
all to be useful for the game they were designed for.  Of course FFS2 is a
follow-on to the original!  That was a highly successful product and a
great idea, you expected IG to drop an established winner?

I find it interesting that with all your complaining about TNE-bashing, you
feel free to insult those who still play CT or MT.

While Foss\'s art is not my favorite, I will admit that it has grown on me.
Aside for IG\'s insistence on putting the tables at the back, what specific
complaints do you have with the layout?

William Keith\'s stuff is "comic bookish"???  Or are you referring to Donna

I note you chose two of the acknowledged worst products for your examples..
what did you think of Emperor\'s Arsenal, or Psionics Institutes?

I am, at best, a Middle-Aged Fart, thank you very much!

Once again.  I am entitled to express my opinion.  I like all forms of
Traveller, and have played them all.  I never had the chance to run TNE.
TNE remains in 4th place in my opinion.  This opinion will be reflected in
my commentary.

Go back and read what you\'ve written.  You\'ve done little but belittle CT
and MT throughout this message.  You\'ve also taken the tact of directly
insulting people because of their opinions.  This does little to make me
feel like engaging in a frank discussion of the various merits of the
different rules with you.

"Whining and ranting"?  On GDW-Beta???  That has to be one of the politest

*Splut*  One a year?!  You want a complete new setting, along with the
support products, on a yearly basis, and you also of course want it errata
free and properly typeset, etc..  Why don\'t you let us finish up the M:0
line first?  Remember what happened to TSR when they went setting happy..
Al-Qadim, Ravenloft, Spelljammer, Dark Sun, Known World, etc..  They went
broke trying to support them all in the face of massive fan indifference.
The fans stuck to one main setting (Forgotten Realms) that had received
constant and detailed support.

This explains the Forgotten Realms setting, over *200* products, books,

>make a new setting, big sales.  Popular ones can endure more products. 

Spelljammer.  Despite a massive ad campaign, tons of modules, aggressive
support in Dragon, the line died a slow, horrible death.  That, along with
a few other fiascoes, sank TSR.  Do you honestly think IG can survive *one*
disaster like that?

CT survived nicely for ten years on a single setting before GDW decided to
change things.  MT lasted about six, before once again GDW pulled the line
in favor of TNE.  TNE lasted until GDW folded.

There was some discussion about a ship combat card game a while back, but
since that wave seems to have crested, I don\'t think it will happen.

But the real fun is that the TL 12 suppliers are probably not the same
bunch
as the TL 13 suppliers... imagine having to tell your boss you lost a
contract for half a million grav tanks. Ouch.

I\'d imagine that there are only a handful of really high-tech worlds in
the Imperium vying for pan-Imperial military equipment contracts. The
competition would probably get pretty heated when you consider that you
could probably put the entirety of modern-day Earth on to a couple of
really fat Naval contracts. There\'s an adventure in there somewhere...

I would guess that "Classic Coke" is a Solomani tradition
and the Vilani would (if they just didn\'t reject it
all together) use whatever happened to be the current
when they took it up and then never changes it
("Traditional New Coke"?).

NO, it has one very important peacetime and wartime function.
giving you intel on enemy fleet movements.  (Probably the
most important picket funciton).  In any case, the message
grew out of the claim that the patrols I was agreeing to
could also be used to stop piracy.  If you think they
wouldn\'t exist, then they wouldn\'t be there to stop
piracy.  If you think there would be other types of
patrols, that is _your_ take on the issue.

Becuse they would be sitting just outside the jump limit and
would just jump away.

A pocket rocket, yes?

Hm, well, um, I imagine external genitalia would need to be fairly
prehensile to handle anything in the range of a derringer.  Even doing away
with a trigger guard, a pretty slender "digit" would be called for -- so
the Centauri would, presumably, be adherents of the "length is more

Who can say?  Since we don\'t know what technologies are needed
we can\'t say how fundamental the blockages to advancement are.
It may be that the difficulty in getting that much power
without turning the ship into an H bomb is enourmous enough
that the advancement in the TL\'s in question is not enough
to warrent a change in game terms.

Yeah, to me that is a lot bigger handwave than the low efficiency
reactor.

Or ID4J. Except, of course, that the full title is just "Independence Day," 
with no mention of the date.

I remember a cute exchange in _Yes, Minister_ (or maybe _Yes, Prime

KCMG = Kindly Call Me God

Are you still having problems getting to me in private?  I\'m getting
e-mails from other people--just checking.

Unfortunately, the Regency Sourcebook has been spoken for by somebody
else.  As a matter of fact, most of the TNE items on the list are spoken
for--I\'m going to walk in there and buy out the whole  shelf, just for
TML people!

The only thing left not spoken for is a new copy of Star Vikings,
Invasion for T2300, and the two TNE gamescreens they have.

The key here is normalization...define your units so c = 1.  Makes

I am sure it is a good app, but for better or worse, PC\'s are more common than Macs and I

Poor Rob isn\'t making any money on this, so I think it\'s his perogative

I used to, then I noticed that PC programmers never specified their platform

I\'m not sure what version of Excel I have, it\'s the one with MS Office
97.  I don\'t have a clue how to use it though.  :)

Yes, it being only for the MAC was my problem.  So many times I have
seen or heard of really cool RPG aids being made, but SIGH, it\'s always
for some other comuter then what I have.  That really bites.  Since I\'m
not rich, don\'t expect me to ever own a Mac.  That and the fact of
having to learn a whole new computer system.  I know DOS and Win95
better then Microsoft\'s Support people (I have solved problems they
couldn\'t many times on my system).

Bruce brings up some important points.  Essentialy, it makes for an even
more difficult time of it for any attacker (also puts more ammo in the
hands of the virus in TNE).  I would imagine some very important worlds
would have these low-value orbital installations spread out to nearly the
100 diameter limit.  Even the Moon would be an ideal location for
defending the earth.  Many low-value locations could be spread over the
near side surface making for a very annoying strong point, protecting the
earth.  I don\'t believe that the Moon\'s defensive nature would be
decicive, but it would definately factor into strategic planning.   

I\'d be interested in some of these low-value installations from the
design/cost viewpoint.  Anyone have some initial figures?

Lee,

While I\'ve seen many remarks made about TNE on this list, the majority, by
far, from what I\'ve seen have been in good humor. Not to say that some don\'t
bash the rules. I think if you posted a serious question someone would have
an answer for you.

My biggest problem with TNE was 2 fold. One I couldn\'t get the group I was
playing with to take the time to learn the rules (I had the same problem
with GURPS) they generally like rules that are quick to learn from some one
else.  Since each runs his/her own game they would rather spend their bucks
to increase their libraries in their own game, unless the books are cheap
and/or very very good. Unfortunately, the TNE rules appeared to be so
complicated (especially the char gen) that it just turned them off.

The second was the Hivers. In the Reformation Coalition, it seemed to put
the Humans back to client race status, and I\'m way too proud to feel
comfortable with that. I\'d have rather seen the proud Human race struggle
back on it\'s own, perhaps even taming Virus or enlisting mutants of it, to
their own ends, (which was how I intended to run a campaign, but it never
materialized).

In short, I have the books but didn\'t care for the game, just as I don\'t
care for all of the Cnnon assumptions in ANY of the T-rules. It\'s just that
T4 seems to be more appealing to my players.

Andrew,
Can\'t wait to see ! I started a spread for FFS2 but work side tracked me.
Looks like I won\'t have to finish it now. Yours looks great.

I like it a great deal.  It\'s close enough to the current standard format
that it\'s easy to scan, while also providing a lot more detail.

If I\'m remembering correctly, the jump drive explanation in FFS2
"canonizes" *both* the jump-ballast *and* the lanthanum-grid models -- the
latter stabilizes the bubble formed by the former.

TL is \'General\' TL, ie the level of technology encountered in everyday life
in the main populaton centres.
This includes communications, entertainment, computers, electronics and
most of the day-to-day Tech used by the populace.
I then take 2D and roll for each of the following sub-techs:

Transport
Medical
Personal Weaponry
Heavy/Military Weaponry
Manufacturing

2-3 is 2 TL below \'general\'
4-5 is 1 TL below
6-9 is as general
10-11 is +1 above \'general\'
12 is 2 above.

This can throw up worlds with TL7 \'general\', Tl 5 medical tech and TL 9
Transport.  Reasons for this are generally cultural, and while coming up
with some I begin to get a flavour for the local culture.

It works for me....

Yeah, like all the CORE stuff that runs on Windows boxes, or Galactic (a

Uhhh, not to get into a flamewar here or anything, but Mac\'s have been
price competitive for quite a while now. You can get get a 200 Mhz clone
system with CD, 2 Gb drive, 16 meg of ram and a 33.6 modem for $1199.
There are closeouts on PowerComputing systems too, I saw a PowerBase
system with a 240 Mhz system for $999. Apple\'s own dual system (200 mhz
PPC, 166 Mhz Cyrix) is going for $2100 right now (all prices coutesy of my
latest Mac Warehouse catalog) I\'m beginning to wonder what I could get for
my gently used 7200/75, and more importantly, how to tell \'She who must be
obeyed\' that we just _have_ to get a new computer, or our lives will be
woefully incomplete. ;-)

Well, there is that, but there\'s also my POV. I work all day on a Windows
system supporting ~200 people using Windows systems, so when I go home I
want a computer that _works_. ;-)

And it runs the coolest design utility ever invented: CSC. If Rob\'s
incarnation of FFS2 is up to the standards he\'s set with his other
products, Mac\'s are going to become a gearhead must-have.

I enjoy hearing praise (who doesn\'t?). I find _constructive_ criticism 
valuable. I don\'t much like screaming, vituperitive (sic?) bile. I\'ve gotten
my share of 
each. The days are long past when I and my co-workers were regularly accused 
of plagiarism (and worse) on the TML, but I remember them (we stole the Aslan
from C.J. Cherryh, we stole the Ancients from Fred Pohl, we stole the Centaurs 
from Larry Niven, and so on ad nauseatum...I\'m glad those days are gone).

How many people here remember the debate that raged when I first subscribed 
to TML...the one that said that I should not be allowed to subscribe because
(emphasis mine) _I would inhibit free discussion_? I\'ll admit that the idea was
dispensed with pretty quickly, but there were people who stormed off in a huff, 
and never returned, weren\'t there?

Why, people would no longer be able to call GDW employees ignorant

I must confess that I made more than my fair share of mistakes in relation 
to TNE (in other words, I also did some of my worst work for TNE).

It was ultimately inspired the Borg chick in _First Contact_, but that\'s
another story.

I won\'t ask how the protagonist is expected to, ahem, "inflitrate" the
rebel organization and, <cough> <wink> gain an audience with the leaders.

<VBG>  I wonder if it has a safety catch on it?  I guess gears are starting
to grow in my head or something, but I still like the popup voice activated
laser-dot-sighted plasma cannon version, too.

Lee, did I miss something?  Who has said TNE doesn\'t belong on this list?

I don\'t know who the "you" you are refering to is, but whoever it is
doesn\'t represent the whole list.  I might not be able to help much with
answering questions, but I\'d try to help, and those that *really* can help
like Harold, Dave, Guy, Chris, Bruce, Doug, Craig, and too many more to
mention would too.

>Please just give TNE a break on the mailing list..

Does it *need* a break?

Ok, if what you mean is that a bunch of people will rag on TNE (background
and/or rules) every now and then...so what?  We rag on T4, MT, CT, and each
other now and then, too! ;->  Most of us generally like parts of *all*
versions of Traveller, but we also dislike bits of *all* versions and we
aren\'t shy about expressing our opinions pro or con. Heck, the high holy
canonists even (mostly) put up with heretics like me that use different
backgrounds, different rules, different almost everythings. ;->

Anyway, if you like TNE, great! If you want to ask questions, make
comments, or generally enlighten the list with your opinions please do.  We
might bark, but we won\'t bite...promise.

Yeah, Bruce, but the problem is we\'ve already spent 1, 2 or 3 thousand
bucks for an intel based system and plunking down another thousand or two
for a mac just to run CSC or Metator (even if they *are* the best Traveller
programs in existence) is a little excessive.  ;->

You know, I had such *high* hopes for the powerPC...if it had caught on
multi-platform we could have had our cake and candy too.  

Speaking of Galactic, and the desire to run DOS programs, you Mac-heads
have the option of software or hardware emulation that works.  We poor
blighted intel folk can\'t emulate the Mac a-tall!

Rob has mentioned using JAVA for future projects.  That *should* help. If
he uses pure-Java the programs should run on virtually all our platforms. 
It might not be fast (at this point), but speed isn\'t really an issue for
this kind of software.

   I know the differences between TNE and M:0.  Theres a similarity in it\'s
underlying concepts is what i was getting at.
   
>I find it interesting that with all your complaining about TNE-bashing, you
>feel free to insult those who still play CT or MT.

   I meant no insult at all to CT or MT.  I said that CT was obviously novice.
It is.  I was pointing out how one can see it\'s evolution and the need for a
more advanced rules set. No insult intended.  I find MT designs sequences to
be horrible.  All in IMO, of course.  :)
Again, I intended no insult anywhere.  Where was insult percieved?
   I can\'t remember where, but I saw a complaint on TNE that said the interior
art looked reminiscent of a comic book.  It does a little, to my eye, but I
like it.  I don\'t remember where or from whom, and don\'t really want to search
for it, so take it as a babble from me. : )
   My comment on FFS and FFS2 was simply in rebuttal that TNE was "new coke"
and T4 is "classic."  Of course, IG is gonna go w/ something proven. It has
since been relayed to me that the analogy was intended for the setting and not
the rules, anyways.
    I have Pocket Empires, Milieu 0 Campaign, and Psionic Institutes.  I can\'t
stand the positioning of the tables in the back.  The missing tables are
annoyances and the only hum dinger is the well known UWP snafu in First
Survey.  Other than, I hate the typeface.  I just think every other Traveller
product looks better (though has improved).  It\'s that First Survey type that
i\'m speaking about.  Looks like it came off of a typewriter in someones
garage.
    Pocket Empires is outstanding and i\'m using that in a game where I have
about 8 players all starting their pocket empires in a new universe (created
by the equally outstanding Galactic v 2.3 by Jim V), all at tl9 w/ a few npc
PEs to spice things up. Mostly i\'m gonna enjoy watching their diplomacy (of
which i\'ve crafted some home rules) and lack thereof. : )  I\'m using the
alternate techs from FFS.  We\'ll see who ends up w/ what and therefor what
strategic advantages, etc, too.  Numerous house rules on extra stuff (im using
Battle Rider for tactical combat and a homemade system for strategic combat
and dirt based).

Your opinion is obvious. : )  The emphasis goes w/ the kicking of the dead
dog, not on the Old Fart (which is tongue in cheek to the categorization of
the tml\'ers in a previous post).  I am also entitled to my opinion, which i
have expressed.  I played MT and TNE.  I Think CT came out before I was born
and I may consider "T4.1" (after a loooong review in the hobby shop).  Between
MT and TNE, there\'s no contest to me, though i like the bits of future tech
like the disintegrators/jump projectors, etc.  The few CT i have is background
material (though i\'ve quite successfully garnished Double Adventure 6).  I
haven\'t yet used Milieu 0 campaign, though i found the Milieu 0 section to be
good reading (though i don\'t like the (well known) canon violations.
Background material probably, and a small desire to support IG. (in vain hope
for my TNE Milieu ?  )  ; )
   Um. I take it u just played in that campaign for 2.5 years, right?  Gotcha.

The "whining" on the GDW beta refers the "theft" of the cruch gun, etc.  It
reaches a feverish pitch when we get to AotR.   GDW beta is very polite...
hmm... the "Aliens book is guano" and "[God\'s Name in vain] Damn GDW!"
Subjects seem to stick out on the archive a bit, don\'t they? (The latter is
somewhat justified, but decidedly impolite). I see the same "i\'m never gonna
buy another product again!" completely uncriticized when its condemned when
done against IG. AotR (which some consider the worst of the TNE books) is
miles above say... Starships and First Survey in quality.  Again the worst of
the T4 products... somewhat notorious.  Whenever I hear an AotR slam, i\'m
gonna bring these up.  Do we wanna nanny nanny nah nah! each other? lol
     My one a year Milieu was devils advocate.  I don\'t expect this.  Some of
those TSR settings were designed to be 1 and 2 year runs, or at least that was
TSRs side of it.  The settings didn\'t sink TSR.  It was the same thing that
sank GDW... the shifting market and that damnable card game.  Originally, all
IG looked like it was gonna be was a disaster, but it seems to be shaping up
quite nicely.  : ) Will it survive it\'s first products?  I hope so.
     Much of my post was motivated by the fact that i saw no defense of TNE.
I simply endured a few too many comments and ripped that post out in haste.
I\'ve never seen nor thought that TNE was trying to be kicked off this list,
just that it needed a voice here.  Even if that was the goal, i\'d like to see
someone try and kick me off this list.  We\'ve got our own list anyways, but
this was aimed at the new Traveller.  Who sees the TNE bash, but no TNE
defense.  That\'s all.  Anytime anyone\'s feeling froggy bout discussing the
merits and detractions of the various settings... I\'m game.  Sauce for the
goose...  : )

Happy Travelling.  (especially the T4\'ers.  We TNE\'ers got it already. lol)

Actually, he was already part of it. The government just chose him as
the most likely to "cooperate". The group wasn\'t doing anything illegal
(yet), but the government was unhappy with them.

Text works best for me, if that\'s all right. That way I can include

Well Bruce, all i have are PC\'s, and previous to that, I had C/PM
machines and a Commodore-128.

I once had an Amiga500 as well, and I\'ll say this for it : my PC with an
Awe-32 sound card does not even compare in sound quality to the little
Amiga500 and it\'s rca jacks.

I also have a 286, 386 and 486 as well as my Pentium.  All PC\'s built by
me, trying to learn how.  The Pentium was designed expressly for windows
95, which is why it has 81megs RAM and 2 2.1 gig hard drives and a
Matrox Millenium 4meg SVGA card.  Overkill, but not when you think about
Active Desktop and windows 98 (due out later next year).  So as you can
see, I\'ve dumped all my spare cash into PC\'s and have nothing left for a
Mac, even if I wished to buy one. My first look at a Mac was the
"classic" model, with the absurdly tiny monochrome screen.  Certainly
not too impressive.  Later, I attended an Apple computer symposium where
then unveiled the Apple //gs and Machintosh II, and finally they decided
to hook a real monitor up to those things.  :)  At the time it was
impressive as they had a 3d cad/cam program running.

Actually, 99% of everything I\'ve seen written for Traveller, aside from
the two games for MegaTraveller, has been written on the Mac.  A lot of
it in Hypercard, whatever that is.  :)

It would be nice to see SOMETHING that works, written on the PC.

That will work.  But I won\'t touch a "classic".  Gak.  Something more
modern though...

Right, I agree.  In general, the format you\'ve got looks good to me.  I\'ve
got a few humble requests, based in work that\'s in progress* (or will be,

I\'d suggest also including the "raw" (FF&S2) values wherever possible, and
particularly for armor (maybe in parentheses?).  The new FF&S2 values are 
compatible with the numbers in the T4 basic rules (so you can know what 
happens when you shoot at a starship with a laser rifle).  Thus, you\'d
have something like: "10 Armor (120), Structure 11"  (or whatever the correct 
conversion is).

I\'ll try to keep the updated QSDS and RPSC as "compatible" as possible, and
will provide conversion tabless from the version 1.x values to the new ones 
whenever I make a change, but it\'s likely that you\'ll want to revise some of 
the conversions in your spreadsheet once the new versions of QSDS and RPSC 
are out.  The revised  versions of QSDS and RPSC will make more use of the 
FF&S2 numbers (particularly for sensors) as well.

>So....what do people think? 

Go fur it!o


* For the curious, the work that\'s in progress is QSDS 2.0 (FF&S2 compatible),
  and a new revision of RPSC that\'s FF&S2/QSDS2 compatible.  With a little 
  luck, maybe the new QSDS will be ready in time for Marc to look at it, and 
  make the T4.1 design system QSDS2/FF&S2 compatible too (Marc, any idea
  what that deadline might be?).

CSC was always treating them as TL10, therefore stacking them at higher tech
levels).

I also added the hooks for computers and autopilots, although I haven\'t
included those yet.  Maybe later.

Cockpit armour has moved from the "Crew and Passengers"  dialog to the
"Armour" dialog.

Humans, especially adolescent males, have a burning desire for speed at any
cost. The Aurens motorbike is targeted at that market. Bare-bones, with not
even a windscreen for comfort, the Aurens provides an intimate acquiantance
with speed, as well as hours of enjoyment tinkering with its finicky engine.
Curiously, the latter has been an asset rather than a liability: true Aurens
riders disdain anyone who can\'t field-strip their motorbike!

Inspired by the Aurens motorbike, the El Aurens gravbike is named after an
ancient Terran hero who fought enemies and built the pyramids. Built for
speed and little else, it appeals mainly to young humans suffering from
hormonal imbalances.

According to my encyclopedia, it is "believed to have been invented by a 
West Point cadet...in 1839." However, it is almost certainly based on the 
English game of rounders, which dates back to at least 1744.

Now, tell me again how many countries take part in the World Series...?

The story was "The Pugilist", by Poul Anderson, in _2020 Visions_ (Avon
1974) a quite good anthology  edited (ironically enough) by Jerry
Pournelle. The story takes place in People\'s Soviet America, after those
danged Godless Russkies have taken over. 

>>Anyway, using this weapon presents a truly *weird* picture. "He

Something very much like this is indeed a scene in the story - in fact it\'s
the, uh, climax...

Actually, Anderson\'s is a small fission gun(!), which supposedly brings
tiny uranium pellets to critical mass and directs the energy release with a
laser. It is fired by a squeeze mechanism, even has a self-destruct
feature.

Rather a wacky story actually; full of weepy over-the-top patriotic
sentiment. Like the scene where the new Revolutionary troops blow up the
Stone Mountain monument with artillery.

Periodically in favour with the yuppie "outdoorsman", the Seadoo can
frequently be found shattering the silence near fashionable resorts. Utterly
useless in anything except calm waters, with virtually no endurance, the
Seadoo is nothing more than an expensive toy for those who believe that the
great outdoors comes with 200 holovid channels and air conditioning.

Unconfirmed rumours hold that some planets treat the killing of Seadoo
operators as public duty rather than murder.

Look what happened to IBM.  For a few decades "IBM" and "Computers" were
almost synonymous to the great unwashed.  Then they told two guys named
Jobs and Wozniack to take a walk...  They almost recovered, But then Bill
Gates blew into town, and Intel (founded by more IBM refugees) pulled the
rug out from under them.  IBM survived by virtue of it\'s shear size, but in
the public\'s mind, it\'s almost a non-entity.

I imagine a great part of Rhylanor, Mora, and Glisten\'s GPP comes from
selling arms to the Imperial forces in the Spinward Marches.  Those great
corporations would also train field reps to operate the branch offices,
where upgrades and repairs were taken care of.. this would slowly spread
the highest technology around, causing a slow TL rise throughout the Imperium.

10% of the Imperium\'s 15 trillion inhabitants is 1,500,000 million people.
If the average lifespan was 75 years and each of them took ONE round trip
(one jump-1 mid passage out and one jump-1 mid passage home) once in a
lifetime, you\'d have 40,000 million jump-1 trips per year. You\'d need
500,000 5000 T pure passenger liners to carry that number of people,
assuming 100% occupancy. Or you\'d need more than 13 million 600 T pure
passenger liners with 90% occupancy. A planet with 10 billion inhabitants
would need 8900 600 T liners just to take care of its own citizens, ships
from neighboring worlds not included.

If some of them take high passage or 2-parsec trips or if some of the ships
carry cargo you need more ships. If some of them actually takes more than
one round trip per lifetime, the number of ships required gets kinda big...

Eris,

I found it at www.ardi.com. It works with both CSC, and Metator, except I
haven\'t been able to get it to print as yet. The Demo runs for ten minute
intervals and then has to be restarted but if I can figure the print part of
it out I think it might be worth the money. more later.

To be fair, Navy scouts (as distinct from Scout scouts) on an invasion
watch would not be deployed in any place where they would have a chance
to interfere with merchants, pirates, or raiders. They would be either be
deployed powered down as as far away from whatever planet they are watching
as their sensors will allow, propably at a right angle to the system, to
make it extremely unlikely that any enemy can target them. Or they will
be constantly moving about, in the same sort of area, but very careful
never to be in the same place as they were two weeks earlier, again to
prevent enemies from targeting them. They certainly wouldn\'t be anywhere
close to a regular trade route.

Still, it is difficult to imagine any military mind _not_ puttting arms
on any military ship and also to design a ship with only one possible
function. The ship I would imagine used for scout duties would be something
like the 400 T courier from _Fighting Ships_, though perhaps with somewhat
better maneuver drives.

Anyway, armed or not, the scouts that David believes in will not be able
to help against pirates. What David evidently dosen\'t believe in are all
the OTHER small ships, like the destroyers and escorts from FS -- or the
cruisers and battleships that FS also states are deployed away from the
fleets in peacetime, for that matter. I must say that I\'d love to play
against David in a TCS campaign, at least if he promises to build and
deploy his fleet according to the principles he has proposed during this
debate.

Good. I\'m glad we got that nailed down. So pirates use armed commercial
ships. That means they are outgunned by navy ships of their own or even
lower tonnage (commercial ships have the lowest possible computer for
their jump rating while navy ships have as high computer as their TL
will allow -- the single most effective piece of fighting equipment on
a Traveller starship is the computer). Upgrading the computer is costly
and makes the ship even more costly to maintain. Indeed, you still
haven\'t explained how our weekend pirate manages to make ends meet. As
I\'ve pointed out before, in the Traveller universe you can make living
carrying goods from port to port or you can move around searching for
suitable victims. You cannot do both.

If you can get hold of _THE Traveller Chronicle_ #9 I had an article about
the nobility in that issue. I summarized it in a message to the list a
couple of months ago, so I won\'t do it again just yet (to summarize the
summary: The Traveller social system fails to account for non-imperial
nobles and I provide an alternate system), but if anyone is interested I
could send him a copy by e-mail.

Some people would call that war. I have a hard time believing that the
imperium would have quite as cavalier an attitude to piracy as some of my
opponents think. I have an even harder time believing that they would not
frown on Vargr raids.

>That would be the first priority of the Navy.

Well, I agree. But I think that this would manifest itself in the Navy
using a few more percent of their strength. And never forget that Vargr
corsairs suffer from the same disadvantage that human pirates do: They
have to keep their outfits in the black. No kindly government will
repair their battle damage and replace their dead crewmembers. Fighting
the Imperium is just not cost effective. Nor is it cost effective for
Vargr planets to support Vargr corsairs, since the Imperium would treat
anyone caught doing so as the US treated the Barbary States.

A _Gazelle_ or a Fleet Courier is as effective at that task as any cruiser
or battleship. You won\'t burn up much of the Navy budget monitoring the
Zhodani.

You can reduce the figure to Cr300 per head and use 40% of that on other
branches of the military and you will still get a huge fleet.

Ah... of those 500 only 30% went to the Imperium by the original calculations.
If you\'re willing to give a full Cr500 per citizen to the Imperium then I see
no problem in funding all those other branches. Though I would expect the
X-boats and most of the starports to make a profit.

Action Points

	Action points allow a character to perform actions during the turn. 
Each character receives an allocation of action points equal to the sum
of his ENDURANCE and DEXTERITY characteristics (exception:  if this sum
is less then six, the character receives an allocation of six action
points).

WHOA, now!  I\'d like to point out that the "Crunch Gun" was _NOT_ stolen,
from anyone, at any point in time.  I was the designer, and Loren Wiseman
asked for, and recieved, my permission to print it in two T:TNE books, with
the proviso that I get a copy of the book, and credit for the design.  Due
to editorial slip-up at GDW, the credit was omitted from one of the books.

I\'m hardly the first or only person that\'s happened to, and GDW is hardly
the first or only company that\'s done it.  I recieved a satisfactory apology 
from Loren and GDW, and I consider the matter closed.  

If half-baked accusations and innuendo based on skimming parts of message 
threads is what I get for making an archive of the GDW-Beta list available, 
then I think it\'s time to take that archive down.  It\'s a part of Traveller\'s 
and T:TNE\'s history, but it appears that it\'s outlived its usefulness.  One
incident like this was too many.

>Much of my post was motivated by the fact that i saw no defense of TNE.

If your posts are \'defense\', I think most T:TNE fans would have appreciated
silence.  It certainly hasn\'t raised my opinion of the people who play TNE,
thankfully, my opinion of the game is unlikely to change due to your posts.

I\'ve spent a considerable amount of time and personal energy working on 
T:TNE-related subjects.  I\'m certainly not \'against\' it (though I\'ve been
known to criticize it\'s failings), but I feel that T4 is the currently-active 
product, and I spend the bulk of my time supporting and extending that.  I 
don\'t particularly appreciate being dragged into this argument, particularly 
in the (presumed) \'against T:TNE\' camp because I don\'t leap to answer every 
T:TNE question that comes along, or because I\'m critical of what IMHO are
the worst features of the game.

>I simply endured a few too many comments and ripped that post out in haste.

Some friendly advice: I can\'t think of a single occasion where I\'ve sent a
post in haste or anger where my words improved things.  In situations like
this, wait a few hours or a day and re-read your post.  If it still seems
reasonable and relevant, send it.  If not, forward it to the trashcan.
You\'d be surprised how many flames start from the careless posting of
unintentionally-incendiary material.

Sure you do, you just haven\'t bothered to do the math yet ;-). You said
in another posting that you believe 12 ships are needed to safeguard a
planet and that a system will have an average of 5 places to guard. I
believe that you are overestimating on both counts, but never mind that
for the moment. If you are right it would require 50,000 12-ship squadrons
for the entire Imperium. If you use 1000 T destroyers as the standard guard
ship then you need 43.8 Teracredit per year to maintain them. The Imperial
budget for naval ships (regular, colonial, and planetary) amounts to 4500
Teracredits. So 600,000 of those ships would cost less than 1% of the budget.
Not very much less, I admit (0.97% actually), but then, you wouldn\'t need to
guard those systems with a planetary navy of their own and you wouldn\'t need
1000 T ships (pirates are mostly clvilian ships, so 400 T patrol ships should
be able to handle them, especially if they hunt in packs).

OK, I know that you don\'t think that the Imperium would have 600,000
destroyers. Well, I agree with you there. But they will have other
ships instead, and a single carrier can do the work of an entire
squadron. And I don\'t for a moment believe that the average number of
places to guard is as high as five per system. The only detailed systems
I recall with multiple settlements are high-medium and high population
systems, which would have defenses of their own.

And yet that is canon too. According to _Fighting Ships_ the Imperial Navy
can afford to split up _battle_ squadrons for individual deployment in
peacetime. They can certainly afford to split up cruiser squadrons too.

>(For example, the number of escorts you need in wartime is a fraction of

Most convoys in Traveller would consist of a squadron of ships at each
point of the trade route. Which is exactly what you need to protect 
ships from pirates in peacetime.

Oh, that goes without saying.

I\'d better restate my position about transponders and tracking of ships,
just to keep the record straight: 

IMO fake transponders are difficult, but possible and a ship has an
excellent chance of avoiding identification as long as it keep its
distance. What is very, very difficult is to avoid identification if
you let an inspector aboard your ship -- which is something you RISK 
every time you set down in a starport. As for keeping track of all
ships on all worlds, I don\'t believe that for a moment. I do believe
you can easily know of MOST ships within several score parsecs and
also that the ships that you don\'t recognize are the ones you  will
single out for attention.

This is war rather than piracy unless the corporation insists that the pirate

This is not piracy, it\'s an espionage operation.

If the debts are bigger than the value of a ship that has a chance on the

All of these explains how the pirate crew got their ship. Well and good.
None of them are any good unless the pirate can make enough money on
pirating to cover his expenses. But can he? I doubt it.

I was kinda saving this for FFS2, the program I\'m currently working on.  It\'s

I\'m kinda thinkin\' of making this one "political-action-ware".  All those who
bombard the Ontario government with requests for laws that don\'t place
ministerial regulations above judicial review get free lifetime support...  

OK, maybe I\'ve been folding flyers a bit too long, but Bill 160, which
includes clauses that state that any ministerial directive or direction shall
have the force of law and shall not be subject to review or challenge in the
courts, and which explicitly renders the ministry not liable for any
consequences of these directive or direction, really needs rewriting.  Or
something.

A prototypical political machine, the Big Blue Machine favours internal logic
over real-world sense. 

Hordes of poorly-paid peons keep the machine in motion, using legs to trample
any signs of opposition. The chassis, of course, is a wedge (thin end, for
the insertion of), armoured and sealed against outside influences. The crew
and their staff (passengers) are provided with ejection seats with golden
parachutes, the cost of which is not included in the official statistics.
While living inside the Machine, all life support needs are provided, as well
as full sanitary facilities (which also clean money). Entertainment
facilities and recreation space make the members\' stay a pleasant one. No
communications facilities are necessary, although a jammer is used to
disruption communications in the vicinity of the machine. No sensors are
needed whatsoever, as nothing that happens outside the machine is important.
A large blade is useful for bulldozing measures through the legislature,
while a large shovel is useful for slinging fecal matter and digging in
heels. 

The optional turret mounts a water cannon for breaking up special interest
groups (any group of three or more opponents).


A bit of insanity, I\'ll admit.  But then, insanity may be the only rational
response to irrational situations.

   OK, one more thing: this is probably the best short "what TML is all

   Now, as for this comment...

>TNE was like the New Coke of RPGs.  Take an

   Your first analogy doesn\'t quite hold up, because MegaTraveller
wasn\'t an established winner.  GDW\'s sales figures simply don\'t support
your contention.  Also, TNE wasn\'t an attempt to "screw" with
MegaTraveller, it was conceived of as a fresh start--something that
would correct the perceived mistakes made during the MT era by
"reinventing" the game.  I say "reinventing", because the changes made
consisted moving to in-house production of products, advancing the
storyline 70 years (and in doing so, bringing the game down to a level
where the player characters could influence the plot), and the
establishment of the so-called "house rules" (interesting side note:
IIRC, T:2000 was outselling Traveller at the time that TNE was in the
development stages, this might explain why the lean toward a more
T:2000-like rule set).  Nothing that was done was a particularly novel
concept, with the exception of some of the design sequences in FF&S.

   "T4" is what would happen if Coca-Cola went out of business, and some
20 years later, Microsoft (or some other company looking to diversify)
attempted to recreate Coke without the secret formula.  They may be able
to create a new "Coca-Cola" subsidary, and hire a bunch of people who
know the soft drink business to run it (maybe even some of the people
who worked for Coca-Cola all those years ago), but what ultimately comes
out of the bottling plant in a Coke bottle may not taste like Coke.  

   "T4" not only doesn\'t look like classic Traveller, IMHO and the
opinion of many others, doesn\'t taste like it.  Continuing the analogy,
this is not to say that "T4" is therefore swill water or skunk piss,
just that either you like this new flavor or you don\'t.  If in some way
it reminds you of the original, then fine IG has a selling point with
you.  But "T4" is not classic Traveller, anymore than a 1997 Dodge Viper
is a 1963 Corvette.

   I know I said I\'d try to address less history topics but...

   Baseball gets its start in the US in the 1850s as a varient of
something called "rounders", which I believe is a British game.  Both
sides in the American Civil War played baseball when they had spare time
time between campaigns (in other words before US Grant got control of
the Union Army  :-)  ).  Abner Doubleday (a Union general) is credited
in folklore with inventing it at Cooperstown, New York.  Today of course
we know that he didn\'t invent it, but he was responsible for helping to
standardize the rules of the game, and therefore deserves at least some
credit.

   The first professional baseball team took the field in Cincinnati,
Ohio.  The Cincinnati Red Legs (the name was shortened to \'Reds\' many
years later) were organized in 1868.  The last professional baseball
team seems destined to play sometime around 2015 or 2020 unless the
owners and players manage to destroy the professional game before then.  

   I don\'t know how professional sports are doing in Europe and
elsewhere about now, but here in the US player salaries and owner\'s
greed are pretty much out of control in most sports.  Professional
baseball however is the most unhealthy here.  :-(

ObTrav: This of course begs several questions: what sports will be
around 3000+ years from now?  Will professional sports exist?  What
would professional athletes make?  are they the celebrities they are
now?  Remember, it takes at least a week to get scores on a game...

It wouldn\'t. Now let me ask you one in return: How many ships do you think
will make it from Glimmern Deep (whereever that may be) to Corridor without
being detected and registered by a navy patrol? (Remember that I\'m
postulating a picket in each system with anything worth plundering).
And with navy couriers going at jump-6 and X-boats at jump-4, how many
of them do you think would outrun their own data? And don\'t you think a
patrol would find it passing strange when a ship does manage it?
 
>Keep the information local, and updated locally.  It makes more sense.

I agree. Your own sector and all adjacent sectors would do the trick. Or
just all systems within 40 parsecs. Any ship that manages to travel 40
parsecs without having to identify itself to anyone would definitely be
a rare bird.

   Funny, when the Ithklur turned up in RCES Equipment Guide with 5.5mm
gauss weapons after I had submitted some similar 5.5mm designs for
publication as RC firearms I didn\'t whine.  I thought of it as a
*compliment*.  I figured that I at least served as a source of
inspiration.

   As I recall, a number of people were working simultaneously at the
time with FF&S trying to come up with a "bullet thrower" that would stop
armored troops.  I could easily see where both Loren and GDW-Beta would
have arrived at a large caliber CPR gun that used ETC cartridges
*without* anyone stealing anything from anybody.

   FYI: Those of you who have TTC #12 saw my ultimate revision of the
original 5.5mm gauss weapons I developed for the RCES Equipment Guide in
the form of the Terran Republic\'s 5.3mm gauss weapon series.  The
assault rifle version turned out to be very similar in terms of weight
and ammo capacity to the AK-47, which it was modelled after.

Ok, I got the DOS version of Executor and installed it. It seems to run OK,
but when I went to Rob\'s site and grabbed his CSC program I couldn\'t get
Executor to recognize that I\'d gotten the file.  CSC is in a binhexed file,
and I know I have to expand it, but I couldn\'t find any sign of the Binhex
program (or the Util folder) in the System folder.

How did you get Executor to see CSC?

Hello,
  Given the minimum administrative window assumed for the vast majority
of (peacetime, intra-Imperium) canon adventures, I think that the case
outlined for the armed merchant pirate still holds if the purpose of
their pirating a _ship_ is to get clear and sell it for a large portion
of its\' value at some later point. OTOH, if they somehow wish to repeat
the operation at intervals under those same conditions, I\'d recommend
Russian Roulette instead, as being safer.

Yes.  In Snapshot, a character can spend a total amount of AP\'s equal to

Right! Right! Now I remember.  "The Boxer" was Simon and Garfunkle, "The

I hadn\'t thought about that story in 20 years, but when people started
discussing the "Pelvic Special" it came right back.

It prints fine for me.  I have designed a couple of vehicles, saved and

I\'ve been severely misunderstood on this point.  I didn\'t mean to imply in
any way that GDW or anyone else stole the crunch gun.  I did not skim the
threads, but read them all and quite thoroughly before this post.  I
understand exactly what happened.  That\'s why i put the word theft in quotes.
I should have clarified and for that I apologize to the entire list and to
Loren in particular.  In My Opinion there was a great deal of whining in
response to the mix up that didn\'t give credit to the author of that weapon.
That was my point.  Look through the record yourself, but it definately has
the tone of whining to me.  Don\'t deprive other Travellers of the archive
because of this misunderstanding.

Only my first post on this thread was in haste.  The 2nd was very well
thought out.  I stand by BOTH posts and would repeat them again (though i
would clarify on the "theft" issue).
Just FYI, but I\'ve recieved many a comment in praise of my vocalizing a
defense.  I\'ve heard from others that they percieved the same thing i did.
Attack and no defense.  I don\'t want nor expect anyone to reply to my every
TNE post or even any TNE related post.

    'body' => 'I bought CT when I was a kid, played about with the big guns from
mercenary, loved it. But for one other game out then (Runequest second
edition) CT was the best game there was, bar none. I played both these
games for years and years. I still play RQ II.

I refer to my CT supplements, read library data from them, even collect the
ones I missed getting when I can find them. CT was great! But the system
was a product of its time. Every supplement brought in a new mechanic or
target roll for a different task. Naive and bitty, I\'d say the system was.
Enough so that I experimented with other rules - especially for combat -
and thus established my penchant for fidfdling with game rules. I still use
CT\'s background material, and I\'d play Chamax Plague, Twilight\'s Peak (THE
Traveller adventure), or Death Station tomorrow. A friend of mine held a
birthday celebration recently by running Research Station Gamma - the first
Traveller he ever did. CT was great! But the system didn\'t really keep up
with the increasing sophistication demanded by the players.

I missed much of the Megatraveller period, since I was in my \'If I want to
play it, I\'ll write it!\' period. 
I got the rules, and now collect back material when I can get it. Why?
Because the Traveller background was further developed by MT, and I want to
know what I missed. I want to know about COACC and suchlike.  Until T4 came
out, we played MT regularly.

Then TNE came along and I got involved. sure, there were flaws. I never
really bothered about them, I just played the game. The opportunities were
there for three guys in a scout/courier to really make a difference. I ran
TNE right up until T4 came out, I still like (most things about) the
setting, and occasionally refer to my TNE material. 

Then T4 arrived. The system is flexible enough that I can forget the rules
and just run the game. The setting is interesting. Product support is good
(I haven\'t bought all the supplements, just most). Now both our Traveller
GMs run T4 for compatibility, and because it \'feels\' like the original
style. The mechanics have moved on, the game has greater sophistication,
but it\'s Classic Traveller 20 years on. 

That\'s my choice. I decided to play T4. But the others are all still valid
- - I\'d play any of them quite happily, and have. What is important to me is
Traveller. You can hang any rules you like on it (but T4 has the most
\'original Traveller\' feeling). What I want is the background, the \'world\'. 

We all play in this \'world\', whatever rules we use. So if you happen to be
a die-hard TNE or unrepentant CT fan, that\'s great! You\'ll not get any
grief from me. To those who want to bash TNE or whatever, I have to say:
TNE, MT and CT are now Past Tense as far as products go. They still have
fans, but the games themselves are history. What is the point of tearing,
say, MT apart? It\'s done, written down and out of print. It can\'t be
changed.

T4 can be changed, so why not concentrate on shaping the current universe?
And don\'t try to show the TNE etc players the \'error of their ways\'. They
are, after all, *playing Traveller*. Unlike the great hordes of gamers who
think that Vampire The Condescending RPG system or whatever is the ultimate
game.

	The "Crunch Gun" is a 14.5mm Anti-Armor Rifle describe in the "Path Of
Tears" TNE sourcebook for the Reformation Coalition. Designed to be able to
penetrate even battle dress, it was originally sold by the Guild of Free
Merchants to various dictatorships to make life miserable for RCES teams.

	In Real Life, the Crunch Gun was designed using FF&S by Guy Garnett, and
GDW was given permission to use it in their supplements. Due to a mix-up,
he wasn\'t credit in one of them. However, he\'s stated that was straightened
out to his satisfaction.

    'body' => 'The crew of the Gelektelk=EAkuttin, a small exploratory vessel operating
towards Imperial space, presents as many unjust stereotypes of the Sayat as
one could ask for.  The following individuals are offered for consideration
and adaptation as desired.

- ----

Jolnurkalar ("Jolly") 5B7AD?, age 30.  Intellectually-inclined, curious and
prying even by Sayat standards, infuriatingly optimistic and cheery, petite
and hyperactive.  Knowledgable in chemistry, biology, and medicine;
practical skills in starship engineering, sensor operations, reconaissance
and surveying.  Bubbly personality notwithstanding, she has no compunctions
whatsoever about conducting invasive experimentation and vivisection upon
unwilling alien sophonts.  Characteristic lines: "I wonder..."  "So that\'s
what it looks like inside!"  "Well, we\'ll just have to come up with a
better idea next time."  "Oooh!  What a silly little organism!"

Tunngardaya ("the Tongue") 687BA?, age 38.  Specialist in alien contact and
diplomacy; formal, suave, perceptive, suspicious, impatient.  Also deeply
cynical, devious, treacherous, and paranoid, understanding better than her
colleagues just what a tiny insignificance the Concourse is compared to the
rest of known space.  Weak telepathic ability.  Skills such as liaison,
carousing, streetwise, forgery, admin, legal, linguistics, vehicles, ship\'s
gunnery, forward observer.  Speaks Galanglic most fluently of the group,
and is generally recognized as "the captain" by Imperials.  Spends most of
jump-time in cold sleep out of boredom.  Sexually predatory towards
non-Sayat humans, but afterwards is wracked by shame and self-disgust, in
turn leading to heavy drinking binges.  Characteristic lines:  "Your
fascinating suggestion certainly merits serious reconsideration."  "I
cannot agree with you enough."  "Would you by any chance care to see a
trick I can do with my tongue?"

Hurkiptan ("Herc") B5D64?, age 30.  A hulking, clumsy, musclebound lug with
a permanent scowl.  Received training in psionically-enhanced strength and
endurance for added levels of menace.  Actually rather sweet-tempered and
patient.  Skilled mechanic, general jack-of-all-trades, "steward" type
skills (alien cuisine being something of a hobby); also extensively trained
in demolitions, heavy weapons, personal combat, and security operations.
Enjoys trying new effervescent beverages, particularly beers; fond of
belching contests in starport bars and diplomatic receptions.
Characteristic lines:  "Huh."  "Betcha that\'ll blow up real good."  "Just
lemme see that, willya?"

Nyuungaptan ("the Nun") 77799? (?), age unknown (but fairly junior).  A
Servitor in Silence;  mysterious and cryptic, communicating only by sign
language and email.  Seems to float a few centimeters above the deck or
ground, but it\'s not certain whether this is gravitic technology or psionic
levitation.  Never seen except in all-concealing black robes and ominously
blank mirror-surfaced face mask.  May be able to psionically teleport;
certainly tends to pop out of the woodwork unexpectedly.  A highly skilled
computer scientist, electronics technician and spacecraft pilot, with no
known outside interests or hobbies.  Keeps to herself more than the rest of
the group; spends much time meditating on jumpspace or old vaccuum tubes,
and otherwise lurking in dark corners.  Overall, pretty spooky.
Characteristic lines: "In a certain sense."  "I have no response to that."
"Ah."

Kooyelen ("the Kid") 57785?, age 17.  A teenage conscript, just out of
"basic training" and thrilled to bits about this incredibly exciting
assignment.  Unstoppably enthusiastic, frighteningly innocent.  Still
physically maturing, shares information all too readily about the progress
of her menarche and breast growth; fusses constantly over zits and
blackheads.  Occasionally violently homesick.  Some psionic talent, under
training by Redeye; has skills only in gun combat, vacc suit;
default/zero-level computer and zero-g combat.  A native of one of the
Sayat space habitats, she\'s the most at home of the group in vaccuum/zero-g
environments.  Characteristic lines:  "But WHY?"  "Can I {come along, try
that, have some} too?  Pleeeeeze?"  "WOW!"

Redeye (576CD?), age c.100.  A Slimy; amiable, chatty, courteous, helpful;
hideous beyond belief.  Has bright red blotch around one bulbous eye,
providing his Sayat and Galanglic names.  Hissing, foggy, damp, sulphurous;
slurps around in a robotic exoskeletal frame and a not-concealing-enough
"drip robe".  Stays out of sight as much as possible out of consideration
for delicate barbarian sensibilities (Sayat regard its appearance as
perfectly normal and acceptable).  Possibly the least prejudiced and
"superstitious" of the team; the closest approximation to a voice of
reason.  Scientific specialty is in mathematics, astronomy and physics;
practical skills in starship engineering, gravitics, jumpspace navigation.
Strong psionic ability and many talents.  Characteristic lines:  "Oh,
indubitably."  "Why, that\'s [not] a very helpful contribution."  "And how
did that make you feel?"  "Sorry to trouble you, but please do stand back
while I vent my mucus compressor."

"Puddles" (23243?), age 4.  A Vargr cub rescued from Bad Aliens someplace
and adopted by the group.  Toilet training has been problematic, hence the
name.  Teething is now the issue of the day.  As a little boy-puppy being
raised by human women, he\'s understandably a tad bit confused.  But very
cute and totally adorable.  Refers to all bipeds and most computers as
"mommy."  Characteristic lines:  "Yap-yap-yap!"  "Uh-oh."

Like most extra-Concourse starship crews, that of the Gelektelk=EAkuttin are
all members of the same nest; within the Concourse this not as common.
There is no "leader" or "commander" of the group -- though Tunngardaya
generally handles dealings with aliens and barter, giving her a certain
amount of power, and Redeye\'s seniority and level-headedness are accorded a
degree of respect, sometimes.  Sayat have only a single name; Slimies tend
to go by a nickname alone or adopt a Sayat name.  Skill descriptions, ages,
and UPPs have been given only as guidelines; social status is not
particularly relevant to the Sayat.  Note that all Sayat have had at least
minimal military training as teenagers.

The Gelektelk=EAkuttin is in the 200-300 dT range, designed with Sayat
technology (i.e., low-fuel/massive-capacitor jump drive in a heavily
armored spherical hull bristling with sensors, ECM, and stealthing gear,
with a cramped, warrenlike, unevenly heated, dimly lit crew compartment).

If you can get hold of _THE Traveller Chronicle_ #9 I had an article about
the nobility in that issue. I summarized it in a message to the list a
couple of months ago, so I won\'t do it again just yet (to summarize the
summary: The Traveller social system fails to account for non-imperial
nobles and I provide an alternate system), but if anyone is interested I
could send him a copy by e-mail.

This is simply not true.  What a I don\'t believe in are the numbers
of ships necessary to stop piracy (or even what numbers are necessary
for that purpose), or the awful (for military purposes) deployement
of distributing ships evenly accross all worlds, in all systems, with
significant traffic.

Sure, if you are willing to start with several ships deployed around
every world with traffic.

Sure.  I have always been willing to postulate that a Kuninuir is

And I have pointed out that you are wrong (though maybe it would be
better if we both acknowledge that we have only pointed out what
we _think_ to be true, rather than stating our positions as truth?).
My disagreement is unchanged.

[Deletions].

>you need 43.8 Teracredit per year to maintain them.

 If we use the Kinunuir that you talked about when
we were posting on this (and which is close to 1000 Tons), and
taking your 10%/year (I think it will be more, but if you say
it is the "canon" number), it costs 100 MCr/yr for each ship.
That\'s 1200 MCr/yr (actually, I think it would be three shifts,
not two, but we will let that pass) per world or 6 TCr per
system per year.  With about a 1000 systems in the Imperium, that is
6,000 TCr/year.

>The Imperial
>budget for naval ships (regular, colonial, and planetary) amounts to 4500
>Teracredits. So 600,000 of those ships would cost less than 1% of the budget.
>Not very much less, I admit (0.97% actually)

At 6,000/year, it amounts to more than your budget.  But even if it
were 1%, that is already more than your original "minicule" amount
(as you have come up an order of magnitude from your original
0.1 %).  In any case, I feel (as I have mentioned before) this is a
sidelight since the point isn\'t what %\'age of the budget it is,
it is what effort is justified by the losses being incured to piracy.

>>and I don\'t agree that you can take out
>>enough ships to stop piracy without hurting defense.

>And yet that is canon too. According to _Fighting Ships_ the Imperial Navy

It depends on what you mean by "split up".  It could me distrbiuting
to the top 10% pop worlds rather than distributing equally to
ever single world with traffic.

>>(For example, the number of escorts you need in wartime is a fraction of

We have been through whether merchants would be wiling the pay the price
for this in peacetime as well in wartime.  My opinion on it is the same.

[Stuff about the effictiveness of transponders....]

I don\'t agree for reasons I have given before (and because experience
has taught us that a system designed to stop individuals from
getting around the system never works like it is thought it would).

Eris,
I used Winzip to expand both Metator and CSC into seperate subdirectories of
the Executor directory. Loaded up Executor. Then used the stuffit expander
program that came with executor on the CSC and Metator files.

When that was done I clicked on the fileing cabinet icon at the upper left
hand corner of the "Mac" screen. THat brought up a list of drives acros the
top row of the screen. From there I just navigated through until I found the
right subdirectory. Clicked on the program icons(s) and they ran. I don\'t
know if there was an easier way, since I don\'t know Mac\'s, but this worked
for me. By the way I used IE4 to download the original files, in the
Executor readme files it says something about Netscape attempting to convert
Mac files during down loads and that you need to use a hot key combination
to stop this process.

I still haven\'t been able to print either a CSC design or Metator file,  I
get an illegal operation error that crashes Executor when ever I try to
print. I\'m using a Pentium 200 MMX processor, so I don\'t know if that is the
cause or the fact that my system is set up for multiple printers.

What I can do is export the files files as HTML in CSC and access them for
print that way. In Metator, however, I can only use this feature with SOME
screens. If I try to export a Complete Report, it only gives me the
Atmopheric Pressure and Hydrogaphic pressure lists? None of the other
information shows up.

A note to Rob. Executor apparently offers to bullet proof programs for this
OS. as well as a Runtime program to be added to the programs to allow them
to be run on Intell systems. I haven\'t looked into pricing for these
services. If you are interested in looking into this with your code let me
know, I think those of us using Evil Empire systems might be able to take up
a collection (I WOULD CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTE AFTER SEEING A TASTE OF THESE
FANTASTIC PROGRAMS!).

Also contact me by private email. I\'d like to discuss what systems
requirements you\'d need on an Intel box. Seems I might be able to get ahold
of an OLD machine that I might also contribute to the cause if it can do the
job. Contact me. These prorams are fantastic Traveller aids, especially
Metator! IG MUST be CRAZIER than I thought not to be interested!

   I\'m sure it\'s a case of misunderstanding and youthful exuberance.  No
reason IMHO to shut down access.  If every Traveller resource were
removed from public viewing just because somebody didn\'t use it properly
this would be the Bab 5 RPG mailing list.

   TNE has its enemies on this list to be sure, but it also has its
allies.  Since the Virus Wars and the T-Plate vs. Heplar Wars and all
the rest were fought over and over centuries ago (by TML time), it is
best that everyone pretty much mellow out at this point.  Our friend
here perhaps wasn\'t aware that we\'ve pretty well exhausted those
discussions (OK, verbal brawls).  While I keep my armor and broadsword
handy to come to TNE\'s defense, I see no need to conduct offensive
actions, or jump all over everyone who insists on saying an unkind word
about the game.  Those TNE fans who feel the need to be surrounded by
the "faithful" always have the TNE-RCES mailing list (subscription
instructions available upon request).

   Many of us have too much mixed Irish and Scottish ancestry to just
hold back like that.  :-)  My policy is to save the flames for those who
really, really, deserve it, and *always* make sure I\'ve got some
semblance of fact (or at least well informed opinion) behind me.

  For those of you not discouraged or disgusted by the above
discussions, the story is "The Pugilist" and is part of Poul
Anderson\'s Psychotechnic League Cycle. I highly recommend the
entire cycle. Anderson has the knack of not needing to use
angst when depicting settings that are not at all sweetness
and light. His talent for setting atmosphere is largely
unmatched by the modern SF writers, I\'m afraid...

  The Psychotechnic League was collated and collected into
several volumes of short stories about ten years ago. There
are a few novels mixed in as well. The timeline starts in a
roughly modern setting and progresses steadily through about
two hundred years before leaping forward into a spacefaring
era which finally ends with the haunting "The Horn of Time".
  As for shock value, "The Pugilist" is unusually high for
the cycle as a whole as well as for Anderson\'s work in general.

  I will produce for this forum a complete story list if anyone
is interested...

Shall we agree on a registry consisting of the subsector you are in, and

Yes, it does, and the two "looongs" are of similar leeength, IYSWIM.  
I would guess that Derby FC dates from late in the 19th century.

It\'s probably mine - it works reasonably well, but sometimes you still have

>What would need to change to make piracy at the frontier a hazardous, but
>potentially profitable, undertaking?  How would you set up a successful pirate?

OK. Let\'s see...

1) Make civilian ships cheaper, both relative to military ships and in
   absolute terms. This would make pirate ships cheaper to run and increase
   the number of potential victims.

2) Make ships cheaper to operate. Same effect as above.

3) Increase the number of places where pirates can intercept merchants. There
   are several possibilities:

   3a) Increase the number of systems without increasing the number of
       inhabited systems, thus making most merchant routes go through several
       empty systems (This would have to be combined with making civilian ships
       cheaper, otherwise transport costs would skyrocket and number of people
       able to travel plummet). One possibility would be to make the Traveller
       universe three-dimensional. If the Imperium was two or three sectors
       deep then you\'d have more than a 100 times as many systems. This might
       be combined with reducing the number of agricultural planets orbiting
       red dwarfs as an added benefit.

   3b) Let incoming ships precipitate out at 1000 diameter limits instead of
       100 diameter limits. Or possibly at a random point outside 100 diameters
       and inside 1000 diameters. This should be combined with 4) below to 
       allow pirates to lurk unseen. Outgoing ships should still be able to
       jump from 100 diameters.

   3c) Allow ships to track and intercept ships in jumpspace.

4) Introduce a stealth field or cloaking device.

5) Make the number of military ships the Imperium _can_ have smaller.

   5a) Reduce the contribution of high-population worlds to military budgets.
       My own suggestion would be to halve it for pop 9 systems and halve it
       again for pop 10 planets. Even better, make it a logarithmic function.

   5b) Introduce what I have dubbed the MISS factor. MISS stands for \'Military
       Inefficiency Spending Syndrome\' and refers to the (possibly mythical)
       tendency of militaries to pay more for their needs than a civilian
       company would. The MISS factor would be a factor from 1.0 and up that
       you multiplied all costs with when the military bought. Thus a navy
       with a MISS factor of 1.5 would pay 1.5 times the going rate for a
       ship (And maintenance would likewise be increased). MISS factors would
       differ from navy to navy. It would increase with the size of the budget
       and the length of time since the state had been at war with an equal
       enemy. Large agressive neighbors would reduce it, small peaceful ones
       would increase it. The Sword World navies, for example, would have
       MISS factors around 1.1 and 1.2 while the Imperium might have one of
       2 or more.

If you ask nicely, perhaps Doug Berry might be willing to send you

Isn\'t the Naval Architect\'s Manual the ideal place for this - I mean, most
of the IG releases seem to be aimed at killing any market for DGP

When considering shipbuilding capacity, remember that yards can build
*above* the planet\'s tech level - eg Regina\'s General Products Yard
building Kinuir Class Bathtubs.

As a related issue - what TL does the Book 2 CT starships system assume?

Fair point. Okay, what I specifically meant was that you induce spin in all
three axes to make the ship unapproachable.

I used \'dead man\'s tumble\' because IIRC Hard Times uses it as a phrase to
describe a ship in such a situation.

FYI - from CT supplement 7 Traders and Gunboats.

Gazelle Class Close escort -
300dt+additional 100dt disposable tanks.
4 hard points carrying 2x PA barbettes and 2x Triple beam laser
Armour level 3 (if I remember my USPs right)

System Defense Boat -
400 dt armoured hull
4 hardpoints carrying 2x triple laser  and 2x triple missile
Armour level 9 (again if my memory of the USP is right)

All the rules I know from Traveller (I\'m not au fait on TNE) would allow
all weapons to fire simultaneously.

So I think that the anti-piracy patrols are harder than you are allowing for.

Fair point - look at the isofreight standards and they give a rating for
the various locks - I can\'t remember if it is explained in the standard,
but is quite a simple FE type problem when you know the maximum mass (say
35 te and acceleration 6G?).

Yes - this is one of the reasons I was arguing (with others) for the
steward skill to include the Andre Norton type cargo master role.

Yes - I agree - a 5dt box is around the size of an isofreight...

Usually, the dowel is a kind of twistlock - it would be \'spade shaped\' to
look at from one end, and is thin. Once in place it is twisted to lock the
isofreight in position. These slots are also on the top of the container to
allow lifting or stacking. Sometimes there are six on a face (I read the BS
a while ago, but can\'t remember that well).

I agree with your discussion on how the stacking may be done. In reality,
the containers would probably be liftable with an automated frame and
twistlocks. For an idea of how, phone BNFL\'s corporate publicity in
Warrington and ask for the brochure on EP1 / EP2 / EPS1 and EPS2 (They are
the drum encapsulation plants and stores and maybe called WEP and MEP now)
which use this kind of system to store stacked stillages of nuclear waste
drums!

>(Following from recent steps with aircraft containers due to bombs onboard, I
>would imagine that the containers are designed to contain quite large
>explosions without rupturing).

Possibly not - the internal bulkhead that surrounds the cargo should
contain the blast - starships are tougher than aircraft. A better analogy
would be a container ship.

>Loading and unloading by computer control would be very fast (less than 1
>minute per container).

I think that this is optimistic - isofreight tops out at about 30000 kg,
which would probably the kind of mass the lifting gear would assume, and to
avoid stressing the system (especially if it is built in the ship) you
would probably move it slowly to avoid hazard in normal conditions. Say
between 3 to 5 min a container, and this will be limited by the rate at
which the cargo handler can receive cargo.

Or you could use manual controls on the lifting frame.

I would think that there would be either a manual way to do this *or*
access so you can cut the pins/twistlocks out.

>It would be slightly easier if the ship was not fully loaded.

Agreed.

Excellent post - I enjoyed it no end.

As an extra thought, free traders probably need some kind of unloading
equipment for those X, E and D ports they visit!

Good point! Now I\'m in a spot. I\'ve always told my players that,
in order for a starport to be able to repair/service their ship,
that starport must be of at least the TL of the ship! I guess I\'ll

I unzipped the origional archive with winzip.  I then put what was enclosed

    'body' => 'Gentle readers:

The piracy-industrial capacity thread leads me to the
issue backwards.  What _really_ should shipbuilding
capacities be?

I once posted a rule-of-thumb for calculating starport
order-of-magitude size, with some auxilary tables for
starport hectarage and capacity, etc.  What I didn\'t
know was that a rule exists: spaceship support for one 
week equals 1 ton per 1000 population.

There\'s a nasty little word: support.

Milieu E:20
===========

Terra         1827 C867966-7    Hi                 514    G2 V

Terra -- a backwater world during most of the 1st Imperium; 
balkanized with no jump drive technology.  Not even a client 
state of a pocket empire.  Very sad.

If it were a member of the Imperium, its starport could support 
5,000,000 tons per week.  Right?  That\'s 50,000 scouts: 7,000
scouts per day; about 300 scouts per hour.  Sure its support is
only TL7, but heck, a gas station is a gas station.  Oh yes:
no orbital facility, so your ship had better be streamlined.

- ----

Ok, I have to convince myself of the reasonability of these
numbers.  I will guesstimate, since I don\'t have any real facts.


Earth\'s Airship Support Capacity 
================================

Airport Support Capacity per week
- ----
Earth has 10,000 mass-passenger and -cargo planes, 500t each -> 5Mt
Earth has 10,000 large support planes,             500t each -> 5Mt
Earth has 100,000 fighters,                         10t each -> 1Mt
Earth has 200,000 small planes,                      5t each -> 1Mt
							       ----
							       12Mt

Each week, these planes are more-or-less supported.  12 Mt/wk.


Airplane Construction per week
- ----
Earth builds 4 mass-passenger or -cargo planes,  500t each -> 2000t
Earth builds 4 large support planes,             500t each -> 2000t
Earth builds 400 fighters,                        10t each -> 4000t
Earth builds 800 small planes,                     5t each -> 4000t
					                    ----
						            12,000t

Each week, 12,000 tons of airplane is built.  12 Kt/wk.
That makes building capacity = 0.001 x support capacity.


Air/Space Correlation
=====================

Now I\'ll correlate Airship numbers with Spaceship numbers:
Space Support == Air Support.  There, that was easy.

So, my guesstimations say Earth can support 120,000 scouts per
week, This is the same order of magnitude as the rules\', so
the rules look reasonable.

UNLESS... the correlation factor isn\'t 1.0.


Questions, comments, corrections?

Don\'t worry Bruce, my expectations of what a Mac looks like is probably

I used to think like this as well when I worked in a mom-&-pop
computer store doing pc repairs.  After I got to the University and
saw the IBM boxes they have here (not the pcs, the unix boxes, rs6000,
etc. which they\'ve built into the \'mainframe\') I changed my opinion.

Granted IBM still made a lot of bad marketing decisions (what was MCA
after all, not that it was bad technology, but they never convinced
anyone else to hop on the wagon!).  But it appears to me more that
they decided to aim for the corporate market at the expense of the PC
you-and-me type of market.  And only recently have they tried to get
back into it (Acer is owned by IBM after all, and I\'ve got one of
those).  

They are, after all, still charging $400+/hour for their techs.  But
you can get one 24x7.  Which is what Corporate America wants.

So as near as I can tell (I\'ve got a buddy working for IBM out of
Kansas City), IBM doesn\'t care what we of the great unwashed masses
thinks.

IMHO.

   lets the players sink their hard-earned millions into augmented 
   solar-sailcraft for a ride through Jupiter\'s stratosphere.  The
   winner gains celebrity status and a generous purse.  The losers

Hello,
  Great stuff. But what about water-going transport -
perhaps barges could be ignored with trains, but ocean
going tranport is our major long-distance bulk movement
system.

I don\'t remember that rule, tho\' it makes sense if you accept the idea of
standard parts.  Would you point it out for me so I can go over it?

My guess would be yes to casual sex, with a general cultural dislike of
contraception. Aslan have a well-developed familial based culture, which
would seem to imply partners (I know it is controversial 
but I follow the idea that permanent couples were a necessary first step for
civilization). As a culture that values family (clans) and expansion
(remember the Fteirle had several nuclear wars before they ever went into
space. The idea of self-restraint, ie population controls, seems unlikely)

If they happen to mate like terrestrial cats, then the humans may come
running to rescue their friend when she lets out an ear piercing
shriek/roar!

It depends on what book you use.  The is another version
in Fighting Ships that only has two turrets.  In any case,
the one you site doesn\'t cost that much less than a
Kinunuir.

First of a new generation of plasma-armed gravtanks, the Peroz boasts a light
plasma cannon and rapid-firing autocannon in turret mounts. The power plant
is rated to supply continuous power to the plasma cannon; a platoon of Peroz
gravtanks can devastate vast areas in a short period of time. The autocannon
is primarily used in a defensive role against incoming missiles and infantry
attacks. 

The Peroz is lightly armoured, and relies on its speed and agility to
survive.

On many urbanized worlds, the wilderness holds a special allure. Discontented
urbanites long to "return to the wilderness", as long as it contains flush
toilets and showers. The Airstream Camper is a low-tech vehicle catering to
that need. In spite of its name, it is totaly unsuitable for real camping,
being little more than a mobile bedroom and kitchen; on worlds where this
type of vehicle is found, there are special \'campgrounds\' providing suitably
rustic parking spaces, flush toilets, and hot showers.

	A few days ago I came across a blurb on Starship Troopers: The
Gotching Abortion in one of those promotional movie mags they give away
free in the theatres.  One of the cast was quoted to the effect that much
of the plot involves the male troopers fighting over female troopers when
they\'re not all fighting bugs together.

	A while back I said that ST:TGA was going to look like The Last
Remake of Beau Geste meets Aliens.  I think I\'m going to downgrade the
outlook.

	I now think that it\'s going to look like 90210 joins the French
Foreign Legion and meets the Aliens, only worse, since we won\'t get to see
Brandon getting his head bitten off by a 12-foot mutant cockroach.

Thanks for the reply.  I found the problem. 

Turns out Executor didn\'t recognize the file\'s names on an HPFS partition.
When I copied them to a FAT partition Executor saw them, and I was able to
get them unstuffed and installed. The interface seems pretty clunky (of
course, the Mac\'s might be too, I don\'t know), but CSC works fine. 

I haven\'t tried printing yet though.

     Trailer hitch for 2.00 tonnes; 63.1 L of cargo space; illuminated
     SmartCoat display on all unused surface area

A fine example of the creative applications to which backwards pocket
empires put advanced Imperial technology, the Sayat RoboReindeer uses a
pair of standard-model Cleon Industries "Fusion Plus" power plants.  The
"reindeer", a domestic riding and pack animal of the Sayat homeworld, could
not successfully be transplanted to one of their main colony worlds due to
biological incompatibilities with the terraforming agents deployed there.
Unwilling to be parted from this economically and emotionally valuable
beast, Sayat engineers designed and built this surrogate.

The RoboReindeer outwardly resembles a biological reindeer in every
respect; even the radio antenna is disguised in the lifelike antlers, and
the onboard computer and control system is designed to mimic the genuine
reindeer-riding experience.  (The illuminated fur coat comes in a range of
attractive neon colors, and can be turned off during the daytime.)
Specially designed hooves provide excellent traction on ice and in snow and
sand, and the RoboReindeer is fully capable of swimming short distances,
such as across lakes and fording rivers.  Internal compartments hold the
ubiquitous Sayat liquor cabinet (who would go out into the taiga without a
stock of strong spirits?) and a miniaturized kitchen, providing the ability
to cook hot meals on the road.  The built-in "tundra blaster" provides for
rider entertainment on long-haul trips.  Internal cargo capacity (minimal)
can be augmented by use of pack saddles, and the RoboReindeer is easily
harnessed to sleighs and travoises of up to two metric tons weight.  Able
to walk clear around most small planets without refueling, the RoboReindeer
drinks additional water after refinement in a portable solar-powered
"bucket" (not included).

As with all Sayat technology, the RoboReindeer is built for extreme
durability and reliability, with a warantee for one million kilometers or
ten years of operation.  However, insofar as pricing can be determined in
the Sayat economy, the RoboReindeer seems to "cost" nearly two and a half
times much as it would under Imperial manufacture.

Math Error...
1200 MCr/yr per system times 5 planets per system is only 6000 MCr or 
6 GigaCredits, not 6 TeraCredits. (6 TCr is 6 million MCr). The 
standard assumption is 10,000 systems in the Imperium (which is 
where Hans is getting his overall budget), for a total of 60 TCr per 
year. (Out of 4500 TCr in taxes, yields 1.33% of the budget).

[Note, I don\'t know the price of a Kinunir, so I am not attempting to 
correct anything but the math error here.]

In case you don\'t remember me, I\'m the poor fool who started this 
thread two months ago, and has been lurking since, watching the 
incredible debate that has sprung from my innocently asking a couple 
of simple questions...

Well, this should be an interesting topic!

Here\'s (my) short answer:
> 1) would Alsan have \'casual\' sexual encounters, and if so 

It\'s been known to happen, from time to time.  But usually not in situations
where rumours are likely to get back to her family.  But IMHO, she\'d probably 
be more likely to be interested in finding an unattached Aslan FEMALE (!) for 
an evening\'s pleasure ...

> 2) would they use contraceptives.

Definitely.


Here\'s the details of my take on it, as tempered by a file I used to have, but 
currently  can\'t find, which covered in intimate detail, how the various major 
races "do it".  If I locate the file, I\'ll be sure to let the TML know, as I\'m 
sure that many people would be interested in this, ah, research.

IMHO, the usual type of \'casual\' sexual encounter for an Aslan female would
be with another female.  

Here\'s why:
Females outnumber the males by about 3:1, yet Aslan \'families\' are normally
monogamous.  If we assume that Aslan females have some type of sex drive*,
then the two-thirds of the Aslan female population must be doing something
about having sex.  Whatever that \'something\', is:
- - Has NO chance of causing pregnancies (even under pre-industrial tech), and
- - Doesn\'t involve a significant portion of the male population.
Female-female activities meet both of these criteria rather conveniently, and
(if accepted as a normal part of an unmarried female\'s life), probably doesn\'t
cause any particular comment by Aslan society as a whole.

* Assuming that Aslan females have no particular desire for sex does solve
  the entire problem, but makes the entire question moot, raises the question
  of \'where do all the ihatei come from\', and is rather boring besides.


Aslan are fairly conservative (particularly the males), and the invention of 
effective contraceptive drugs is a post industrial revolution technology.
Aslan males would be reluctant to trust a (female) technology they don\'t 
understand when the consequences could be so serious.

In addition, the overall structure of Aslan society doesn\'t change very much
regardless of TL.  Even privmitive Aslan societies use the same structure.
Therefore, whatever the females do to relieve sexual tension doesn\'t have
a risk of pregnancy, no matter what the available contraceptive TL** is.

** Is contraceptive TL a world statistic that could be derived from WBH?

Conceiving a child outside of a family structure would be a grave dishonor
(due to the breach of the traditional Aslan family/clan/pride structure), and
would practically guarantee that the child (and probably both parents) would
become outcasts (social status 0), unless the couple were to marry (and even 
then, there may be lingering dishonor).  It\'s worth noting that Aslan don\'t 
even have a way of formally addressing someone who is born outside of the 
traditional family structure.


Now, what do the males do to relieve sexual tension?  IMHO, male-male sexual 
relationships would be almost unheard-of, and discouraged by Aslan society.  
There are probably low-standing or outcast females who are \'prostitutes\' 
(this is a very loose  translation; it\'s hard to have prostitution, in the 
sense that humans use it, when the \'cusotomer\' has no concept of money, and 
probably doesn\'t have and/or doesn\'t have access to any).  

In any case, the female involved manages the male\'s affairs (much like his
female relatives would ordinarily do) in addition to any more personal 
services she may provide.  She skims a percentage off of the male\'s accounts, 
and as long as he\'s satisfied, he\'s not going to go complaining to his female 
elatives.  This is a balancing act, with amount being skimmed depending on the 
proximity and watchfulness of the male\'s female relatives.  Even merc troopers 
are typically related to the females who manage the unit (and keep their pay 
accounts), so there is a certain amount of balance in the system.

The other way to view this arrangement is that the male\'s female relatives
pay an unrelated, lower-class female to \'watch over\' the affairs of the
male.  She gets a percentage of the assets as her pay, and may provide the
male with sex and companionship so that he doesn\'t complain about it.

That\'s odd. I, personally, got it to install on win95. I know it works.

Tomorrow, I will download it again, and check one more time to ensure 
that I can install it. I\'ll post step by step instructions.

I seem to recall that I couldn\'t do it the first time, \'cuz there\'s no 
bitmap, but I worked around that somehow. Don\'t recall how of the top of 
my head.

Once again, apologies for the trouble...

Remember, this *is* a beta version. ;) I will create an easier to install 
version, with PC bitmaps and the whole shpiel, as soon as my fontographer 
skills improve and the thing is finished...

Windows users might still be interested in doing the dearchiving of .hqx

I assure you, Eris, the clunkyness was due to the "clean-room" nature of 
the program, and is no reflection of the actual Mac experience. I tried 
it today. What\'s with that green circle when highlighting icons? The 
icons remind me of clumsy Windows 2. I bet they were unwilling to "swipe" 
the actual mac icons and risk litigation. 

And opening large folders was sloooooww. The "real" Mac finder is no 
speed demon at present, but this emulated one -- I wasted half of the 10 
minute demo just waiting for the screen to update after I quit an 
application.

But -- CSC seems to work, and I guess that\'s what\'s important to PC 
people...

PS. I\'m not sure if everyone realizes that there is a linux version of 
Executor too, iirc.

Metator and CSC running on my PC!!!!! 8-)

Executor takes a while to load (long enough for me to start listening
nervously to the precise noises coming from my hard disk drive) but does
seem to run quite fast, although it does have plenty of stuff disabled, and
not all the interface functionality (clicking on scroll-bars, etc.) seems to
work. I\'m running on a 166 MHz Pentium, so I guess it\'ll be slower for some
people...

Oh, and I had to de-stuff CSC & Metator using the StuffIt Expander provided,
because using WinZip created a file which Executor regarded as a Unix text
file and therefore wouldn\'t execute. Then again, I avoid Macs like the
plague, so I may have done something wrong.

I think of the Aslan as being TNG-Klingon-like in their honor (no doubt wich=20

contraceptives.
Would make an interesting outcome for your Aslan character player, isn=B4t =it?

For the play, if a character wants to have a sexual encouter, I would=20
leave it up to them. (It did not occur yet in my group). For the Aslan=20
the only question would be: is it honorable? I think it is, if both of=20
them agree. It is possibly not honorable to pay for it. But I leave that=20
to further discussion.

The Zhodani, for example, would never go to a prostitute, because of=20
their dislike for any untruly. But if two of them come together it might=20
be a night like no other - mentally linked toegether.

I don=B4t know if this fits into the conservative system of the Vilani.=20

Sorry, but a spin around any two axes can be computed to a spin of one=20
axis between them. But, what is the point, if you did not get one of the=20

Every physical body will do this. You can test this with a pingpong=20

Not true. With ships of that size all batteries bear.

Even if that does happen (and it isn\'t nearly as much of a sure thing as
you claim) the SDB would still have its othe turret. All it has to do is
to rotate and bring the other one to bear, whereafter it would proceed to
cut the offending ship into shish-kebab.

Sure. And the accompanying text points out that "The range of possible
system defense boats is large, if not actually infinite." In Traveller
naval parlance a boat is any spacegoing vessel that dosen\'t have a jump
drive. A battlerider is a boat. Indeed, I\'m inclined to believe that most
SDBs are quite a bit bigger than both the published types. Obsolescent
battleriders would make excellent SDBs and any PE I ran would have most
of its planetary defense boats interchangable with my battleriders. (And
my tanker squadrons would be battlecarriers with rider-sized tanks).

>In any case, the one you site doesn\'t cost that much less than a Kinunuir.

I don\'t have that book with me, so I can\'t be specific, but surely it can\'t
cost more than a third? It\'s a third the size, its computer can\'t be more
than 2 grades higher, and it dosen\'t have a jump drive.

And the one you cite (less than 25% of the Kinunir\'s cost) has a model 9
computer. That makes it quite capable of dealing with merchant ships
several times its own size.

Death Station is about a lab ship in orbit with an experiment in battle=20

I=B4d have to look up the Argon Gambit, as I do not think of using that one==20
for my players group. (The above will fit in well, as one of the player=B4s==20

time)

That\'s "triticale". And it\'s a hybrid cross of wheat and rye. I\'ve got

Easy solution. Add the unix commands to the PC (they are usually
available) and use 4dos, so you can alias things. On the unix side, a
good alias file helps too.

"Cannonized" (note the extra "n") is used jokingly to refer to the fate
of some of the losers in the Sepoy Mutiny. You load them into a *large*
cannon, or at least tie them across the business end. Then you fire the
cannon. Messy, but effective.

That has been discussed before on the list. It\'s a discrepancy. The TCS rule
is that you can\'t build or repair a ship of a higher TL than the planet\'s
(BTW. you CAN repair jump drives at Class B starports, it just costs twice
as much. And you can maintain a ship at any Class A and B starport, regard-
less of planetary TL).

Possible ways to resolve the discrepancy is to increase the space TL of
Regina (note that Regina was classed as TL 10 in some of the early books
but that was quickly changed to 12). Another is to reduce the Kinunir\'s
TL. I do both; in my Traveller Universe Regina has a space TL of 14 and
the Kinunirs are TL 14.

A third possibility is to let Regina import the TL 15 parts and assemble
them/fit them into a TL 12 hull. I don\'t like that solution, since that
would add transportation costs, but I haven\'t done the calculations. It\'s
possible that Regina\'s lower labor costs will make it economical.

According to the rules you need the TL of the ship to repair it, but not
to maintain it.

>I guess I\'ll have to eat my words.

Or you could say that if you perform annual maintenance of a ship on a
planet with too low a TL, you have to pay for the transportation costs
of the spare parts (Double up according to _Striker_. Personally I would
use +10% per parsec\'s distance to the nearest suitable world).

And most of the "great unwashed" have little or no idea of what the
*current* generation of mainframes do. Things like run the airline
reservation systems (one of the biggest, ugliest, realtime databases
ever invented). 

Heck the "huge" amounts of data that folks are worried about for ship
registry is *not* that big (allowing for TL differences) compared with
things like the stock market (which runs on *minis*) and the airline
systems.

That\'s not quite true, unless you\'re referring to a rule I don\'t know
about. The relevant rule is that the shipyard capacity of a world (with
a Class A or B starport) is 1 T per 1000 population. That is, the total
tonnage of all ships that the world can work on simultaneously is 1 T
per 1000 population. That is NEW construction and repairs. Maintenance
(if maintenance requires shipyard capacity) and replacements are hidden
from TCS players and would have to be in addition to that number.

No, it could work on 5,000,000 T of ship at a time, provided the money
to do so was available. And provided its starport had been upgraded...

It actually does make sense (for me).
There are good and bad ways to weightlift/dieting/agility training etc and
INT could perhaps guide you right there. The reason bodybuilders are so
much bigger these days than for say 20 years ago is not only due to
steroids - they actually got better at training by doing research studies
etc. I\'m not shure the MT rule could be an error nevertheless but for me it
would be really rewarding to give your superstrong dimwit PCs a hard time
increasing their STR because they\'re too stupid to train efficiently.

It\'s not a rule - more a statement garnered from various c-word sources.

CT adventure 1 - The Kinuir. General Products Yards have been building the
Kinuir on Regina (A788899-A in the supplement, TLC by Rebellion) and High
Guard (Book 5) gives the TL of the Kinuir as TL15 (F).

Now, the performance of the Kinuir would require a TL13 Jumpdrive. So,
either the components are manufactured elsewhere and shipped in, or yards
can manufacture at a higher tech level than their infrastructure. I
personally deal with this by allowing lower tech yards to buy in components
(at higher costs etc) for repairs, and assuming that Navy and Scout
Facilities can maintin TL15 ships.

1250 T. I switched to a 1000 T destroyer costing ~750 MCr at some point
when I was doing some calculations based on tonnage because it was more
convenient. I\'ve stuck to them because a 1000 T destroyer is just as able
to deal with an armed merchant as a Kinunir. Still, the difference
shouldn\'t be that great.

Well, 108 MCr.

>That\'s 1200 MCr/yr (actually, I think it would be three shifts, not two,
>but we will let that pass) per world or 6 TCr per system per year.

A teracredit is a million megacredits, not a thousand.
 
5*1200 MCr = 6,000 MCr = 6 BCr = 0.006 TCr.

6 TCr.

And at 6/year it amounts to 0.13% of it.

True, because at every point I\'ve overestimated, just to make sure no one
could reasonably carp about the end result. You don\'t need to provide
extra guards to all 10,000 worlds (because a lot of them would have
defenses of their own), you don\'t have 5 planets to guard in all 10,000
systems (and those systems that will have the most places will be the ones
with their own defenses forces), and you don\'t need Kinunirs or destroyers
to deal with armed merchant ships. I may not be able to get the total down
to 0.1%, but the true figure would be a lot less than 1%. And you know what?
Even if it WAS one entire percent, I still don\'t see how you could possibly
consider that too much to use _of an already existing, active force_. How
much of the US navy budget goes to defending your harbors and bases? 99%?
I kind of doubt it. 

>In any case, I feel (as I have mentioned before) this is a sidelight since

And as I have mentioned before, the percentage of the budget isn\'t the
point except at one remove. The point is the percentage of the available
forces (which can be estimated based on the budget) it would take to
suppress the pirates.

Why in the universe would anyone split up a squadron in order to distribute
the individual ships to worlds that maintain scores and hundreds of cruisers
of their own? That makes absolutely no sense. The only reasonable thing to
do with a split-up squadron is to post them at worlds where they make a
difference.

And you are assuming facts not in evidence, to wit: 1) that the merchants
have any say in the matter, and 2) that the tax burden would be less if
the Imperial navy kept all its active ships clumbed together at the
high-population worlds.

I\'m not in the least surprised.

Stephen Jay Gould wrote a very interesting essay on the history of 
baseball - unfortunately I can\'t find the relevant volume right now.
To summarise: it is definitely a US game, it evolved rather than being 
invented, and there are several British forerunners.  Some of these were 
actually called baseball - it gets mentioned by that name in a Jane 
Austen novel (or was it a Bronte?).

I\'ll try harder to find the relevant volume if anyone\'s interested.

I would say it just a bit differently, though I agree in principle - a
registry exists, based on the three or four sigma travel distances of
ships.  (This is roughly 99.99%).  When I worked out the numbers, I got
that it was very unlikely for any ship to go more than one unprofitable
jump and still make more money than a single trip to a closer, lesser
destination.  You are also more likely to get good cargos if you know
someone on the world, thus I figured you would end up with the vast, vast
majority of the ships staying in a two or three parsec radius around a high
pop world.

Note: my numbers indicate that the whole sector, or the subsector with the
surrounding 8 both meet that requirement.

Aside: why such a large area?

If you have a registry that covers every ship you are likely to see, then
you save your patrollers time.  It also means that when you see the one in
ten thousand that is really trucking, then it might be worth investigating
it.  It is, after all, rather unusual, and just might be fleeing an
incident of piracy, or might have someone important on board who needs to
see that the Navy is on the ball.

Further, if our previous discussion indicated a thousand ships a day coming
from a big world, then the patrols are only interested in one ship a day,
and the backwater worlds need only care once a month, or once a year.

I suspect ships in my game might well have the entire database, because I
do not see strong reasons against it, but making the ship cost
modifications I mentioned in other posts might make that infeasible.

    'body' => 'I was thinking over the ramifications of altering the ships costs, like I
have been planning to do, and here were some thoughts.

It is terribly unlikely that a merchant will go far away from the supply
worlds.  The M0 materials assume, falsely, imho, that a year trip is
economically feasible.  This is, if the FS data or anything like it is
used, not sensible.  There are no listed destinations that are even
remotely worth that level of effort and expense.

(Consider - at current ship prices, it takes a year of use of roughly
50-100 megacredits to ship 100 tons of stuff for a year, ignoring all other
expenses.  I find it hard to imagine that this is the best use of that
100MCr of capital, given that it could likely find a trade half as good
just two jumps or so away.)

In 1700, a three month trip made good sense, because there was a very
valuable port on the other end, and few destinations closer to stop at.  A
ship owner could make more money taking his ship out of service for that
long, because the closer choices were far worse.  To make the same
situation arise in Traveller, it has to be worth more to go that far, and
the ships would need to be cheaper, so that the one in a thousand ships who
might make that trip would represent enough to be noticeable.

By the bye, I am aware that most of this trade consists of traders trading
to traders, who might ship things farther.  This actually makes it worse,
because every transaction has to involve some inefficiency, so the trip of
one fusion plant from Sylea to West Nowhere has to generate even more money.

This is compounded by the incredible cost of a trip, far out of line with
the assumptions most people are making about star travel.  Present day
business travel costs ~1/30th of the salary of the typical business person
for a round trip ticket to most of the world.  Traveller travel costs about
the same as that person\'s salary, which means a star trip is a lot more
like taking a new job and moving, than taking a trip to see the outlying
office.

This is not a bad model, mind, but it does not fit the way many people seem
to play.  (Me, as an example)  For example, I believe douglas@teleport.com
wanted to have something like a third of the people in his universe have
taken a star trip at some point.  This can be done, but only if there is a
way to take a star strip that does not cost more than about 10-25% of the
PCGPP of the average citizen.

My current working solutions:
Gas giant refueling is very difficult, but can be done by any armored and
hardened ship.  Scouts and military vessels are.  This raises the number of
ships that will go to planets, and makes in system travel more likely.

Merchant ships cost somewhere between a tenth and a twenty fifth of their
present cost.  This lowers the cost of passage, and lowers the cost of
cargo.  With significantly cheaper cargo prices, shipping raw resources
becomes more likely, and it is possible for the value of something to be
larger than the cost to ship it for a year.

With other adjustments, out system cargo costs roughly 200Cr/t to go jump
1, 300Cr/t to go jump 2.

With other adjustments, in system cargo costs roughly 100Cr/t to take a one
week trip.

(These other adjustments will include crew salaries, as they seem a bit
high.  For example, a gunner makes over the average, and a pilot makes
seven times the average salary.  While this might be reasonable, I note
that present day ships that are far larger have much smaller crews.  To
make the model closer, it might be worth trying to drop either the crew
size or the crew cost.)

There are four classes of passage: steerage, low, medium, and high, plus
frozen.  Steerage involves being shipped literally as cargo, often with
sedatives to keep the people from moving very far or very fast.  The others
represent ever higher classes of luxury.  Anyone who has taken an overseas
plane flight in coach should have some feeling for low passage, while the
critter comforts of present day first class represent a middle passage.
The cost is the cost to the merchant for the space, while the price is what
they charge the ticket holder.

	steer	cargo	frozen	low	medium	high
space	0.5	1	1	1	2	4
cost	100	200	250	200	400	800
price	250	500	600	800	2K	10K

Note: the profit margin on a frozen passenger is lower than that on a low
passenger.  The reason for this is that the standard low unit is mounted in
a cargo bay, and can be added to a vessel quickly if no other cargo becomes
available.  Both steerage and frozen passage are often offered by cargo
vessels with little advance planning, while higher grades require
significant work to prepare for and implement.

TAS still provides high passage, and getting a high passage certification
is very important to those merchants servicing TAS members.  Often, a
merchant will take a TAS member for quite a few jumps in exchange for that
ticket, in return for the passenger not demanding a full time steward.

The average merchant ship is roughly three thousand tons, but a free trader
can make it pretty easily in the 100-500 ton niche.

The average peacetime military ship is a 5000t destroyer.

The average wartime military ship is the 30kt cruiser

The jump limit is now 2 AU, so that there is some space for pirates to
operate.

The adventures were "Death Station" and "The Argon Gambit".

;-)

DS is one of the scariest adventures that I have ever played in and
involves a labship, drugs experiments going wrong and possibly trips down
fuel tanks a la Aliens airshafts. Oh yes, the players get to investigate.

IIRC the Argon Gambit revolves around politics, specifically the Solomani
party. Anyone help here?

Fair point. I didn\'t look in Fighting Ships.

Kinuir 1080 MCr (volume discount)
Dragon Class (CT Traders and Gun Boats) 780 MCr (*undiscounted* so in
volume approx 625 MCr)
2 turret SDB 255 MCr (Volume discount)

Only point that I would make is that the smaller SDB has a factor 9
computer (not 5fib) and factor 13 armour which makes 50% of normal (none
pulse laser, none nuke) hits have no effect, so it will still cream most
pirates pretty quickly.

Argon Gambit was a political intrigue thriller set in the Solomani Rim.
Not the best adventure I ever played, the players were led by the nose
through most of it.

Death Station took place aboard a Lab Ship that derelict, with the usual
Horrible Bug That Turns People Into Homicidal Maniacs.

These are both AFAIR.

"Death From Above" used to be the motto of the 44th Airborne Company
(Training) at Jump School.  I still have the shirt somewhere.  It\'s been an
unoffcial motto of Airborne and Air Assult forces since WWII

On a side note, the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne
Division still proudly bears the nickname given to it by the Germans..
"Devils in Baggy Pants."

ObTrav:  What sort of unit nicknames show up in your Traveller military
units?  My favorite is the 3407th Marine Regiment "Hell on the Half-Shell"

Ah, that just warms my poverty stricken heart....

Right now, At Close Quarters is being working on diligently.  I\'m waiting
to hear back from several playtest groups before going any farther.

ACQ is a decendant of Sanpshot/AHL, and uses Action Points.  It\'s based on
my experiences as an infantryman, along with research on what really
happens in firefights.  (Several San Francisco Police Officers have been a
great source of information, as well as being great players in my game.)

Right now, I\'ve been in contact with Andy Lilly about having BITS publish
it, and would be more than willing to see IG put it out.  The final product
will have complete combat rules for small groups of people and vehicles and
an extensive armory and equipment list.

I have no idea when it will be finished.

I\'ve always wondered about how naval fleets manage to arrive in a system with
enough cohesion to begin an attack.  According to the rules, they will arrive
over the course of 3 days!  Something tells me the Imperium would not look the
way that it does if attacking fleets took that long to arrive...

I have never seen a reasonable answer to this question that matches what we
know about the universe.  I\'ve seen people mention \'synchronizing\' the jump
calculations, but that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  This synchronization is
free, takes no extra time, no extra risk and no trade off.  Why is it that it\'s not
more commonly used for multiple ship missions, both civilian and military?

Eventually I gave up on this as a bad deal, when I was awake that is. The
other night I had a dream.  In this dream I was enlightened.  I\'m going to share
this enlightenment with you :-)

Now, this whole house of cards I\'m going to construct depends on a few key
assumptions, and some careful, adept handwaving, so bear with me as I set
this up.  First a few facts:

a)  You can\'t survive jumping at under 10 diamters (ship destroyed).
b) Under 100 diamters the ship will almost always misjump.
c) After 100 diameters you have a standard jump (+/- 1 day) with a small chance
of misjump.

And now the inspiration.  A simple question, posed by a navigator in a dream.
What happens at 1000 diameters?

Thrusters are affected by gravity, so are  jump-drives?  What if 100 diameters
was just the \'reasonably safe\' limit?  What if you moved out far enough the
+/- 1 day went away?  What if that distance was 1000 diameters?  What if at
that distance the error went from +/- 10% to +/-1%?

The time required to travel to 1000 diameters far outweighs the benifits for
traders.    The only people this would benifit would be military operations
involving large numbers of ships.  Any comments?

The discussion that preceded your comment was with reference to
the MAC versions of the fonts; Windows won\'t see them.  I had no
trouble with the PC version of it; unfortunately, I don\'t
remember where I got it from; it _wasn\'t_ the Geocities site.
I\'m pretty sure that Jo Grant has the info, though.

Interesting idea.  I have published the original FF&S2 spreadsheets I 
submitted for EV to my website. 

(http://www.magicnet.net/~cmdrx/xtek/grav.htm).  They could use some

If you want I can e-mail them to you.

I wouldn\'t be too quick to criticize this movie based on the content of its
web site. Reuters posted a fairly glowing review of the film. They said it
was a great action film with excellent special effects.

From what I\'ve read of the plot and characters, it also pays a fair amount
of respect to the intent of the original author, Robert Heinlein. The
characters and plot are much the same as they are in the book. I\'m not too
pleased about the lack of powered armor, but for a movie that already cost
the studio well into nine figures, I\'m sure that would have been a luxury
they could not afford.

It should be an entertaining sci-fi.

Best,

I totally agree -- I mean, EVERYONE knows that the male troopers fight with

If I spent more time in dos than I do now that I have win95 I would.

The only people more clueless about military matters than journalist

Just because we agreed to limit the area does not mean that I agree that every
ship is going to have a complete ship\'s registry.  I was pretty clear in my
earlier post where I stated that Class A, B, and C starports, Navy bases, and
capital ships.

Consider all the information that a ship has to have in it\'s data banks.
Library data, Sector information (including detailed information down to the
Planetary level), biographies for VIPs in the sector, dossiers on potential
adversaries (military and civilian), IFF data for sector and planetary navies,
as well as various allied (but non-Imperial) military fleets, cryptological data
for interfacing with any of the forces mentioned above.  Protocols for
interacting with civilians of, literally, hundreds of different cultures.
Military information including detailed contingency plans (in the event of
conflict), fallback and rally points,  supply caches, etc.  Medical, scientific,
and general knowledge to supply the captain and crew with the means to construct
solutions for literally any problem that they may encounter, when they are the
sole representative of the Empire.

I agree that known pirate ships, and ships on the \'skip\' list will be listed in
the general ship\'s registry, but I don\'t think that every ship, down to the
sub-light intra-system lighters and shuttles, will be.

Ok here comes the problems....

I have excel 97 for windows, the excel 5 spreadsheet has vast areas in the
tables that have the #N/A filling them up. Which then effects the other
sheets in the workbook. Some Quattro Pro function did not convert over to
excel 5. If you can try version 6 or later if Quattro Pro has that ability.
My version of excel will not convert the Quatto Pro version that you have
posted.

Also having to look up the varlous codes for the entry fields is a great
pain. Look at Ananti\'s(sp) FFS1 spread heets for a good resolution for same.

Right.  I skipped "Giga".  Mea Culpa.  I\'m not sure how we
got to 4500TCr in taxes (when the old number I remember from
Hans was 2,500 Cr) but that is a small effect.

Death station is one of my players best remembered adventures. A Lab ship 
researching new drugs goes off line, players are sent in to find out what 
happened. It includes lab ship plans for the dungeon crawl, good 
"monsters", just the right level of horror, industrial espionage and a 
great detective story. Sadly when my players saw the title of the book I 
was using for the adventure they became very paranoid...

The Argon Gambit - well I never ran it. Set in the Solomani Rim, it says 
in the book "an involved poloitical intrigue that the players will become 
ensnared in against there will". Not even an illustration breaks the text.

Computers can be upgraded and modest sized merchants can have
as many weapons.  When you add in the fact that, since the
pirate takes the initiative, he has to be able to win no
matter what tatical situation the pirate puts him in, I
find his level of fire power quite questionable for the role.

Sure, I\'ve heard of "Death from Above" before, but it seems like
an odd slogan for people designated as mobile _infantry_. If they
were called "drop troops", "Jump troops", "Airborne Assault Troops"
or something like that, sure, it would be a great slogan.

But from watching the ads, it seems to me like most of the mobile
infantry in "Starship Troopers" live up to their name - they run 
around on the ground a lot. The way the ads play, their slogan
should be "Death from... *crunch* *snap* blark! gurgle..." as a big

Actually, as Garth pointed out, I made two errrors and the
final number is 1.3% (more if you use the old 2,500 TCr
budget you mentioned rather than 4,500 TCr).

>>But even if it were 1%, that is already more than your original "minicule"

Well, my statement was that is it not as miniscule as you said.
An order of maginitude certain qualifies as a significant change.
Also, in addition to the fact that large organizations really
don\'t ignore any cost because it is "too small", the fact
is that 1 or 2% of a budget is a significant expenditure.
(esp. if it is being used for any specific purpose, like
stamping out one type of crime). NASA\'s budget, for which
some cry a huge waste of money, is about this amount.
(Heck, the SETI search, which was large enough for
politicians to sigle out for elimination, was a fraction
of that).  It was debatable that a large organization
would consider 0.1% not worth worrying about.  It seems
to me clearly not true when you start getting into the
>1% range.

[Various basis number in disagreement....]
>I may not be able to get the total down
>to 0.1%, but the true figure would be a lot less than 1%.

And I could could push it up to 5% if you replace your approach
with the one I used when I replied a month (?) ago.

>Even if it WAS one entire percent, I still don\'t see how you could possibly
>consider that too much to use _of an already existing, active force_.

Well, you _know_ I don\'t agree that you can use an already exisiting
force without diminishing the effectiveness of that force for
its primary (military) use.   I\'m not sure what the point in
reasserting your view as if it were fact is, unless you either want
me to just give in because you keep raising it or you somehow
expect that I will be willing for the both of us to simply
repeat the points we didn\'t agree on before.

>>It depends on what you mean by "split up".  It could mean distributing

>of their own?

Sigh.  _You_ are the one that advocates taking military forces
and using them to stop piracy.  I don\'t know if personal navies
for systems are "canon" and I don\'t care.  Militarily you
want to concentrate forces into fleets and about high
value targets (a large system generates more forces, but
is also a large target).  If you want to stop piracy
you have to take those forces and spread them out to
every world, in every system, that has traffic.

>>We have been through whether merchants would be willing the pay the price

>And you are assuming facts not in evidence, to wit: 1) that the merchants

Well, no.  _You_ are the one that is trying to prove something
and assuming facts to justify it.  I\'m willing to agree that
these facts are uncertain and are one of several assumptions
that can be cast one way or the other to make piracy possible
or impossible.

Also, regarding number 2, this is another way of proposing the
same "free lunch".  We don\'t agree that the military ships
can be used to stop piracy without harming their mission
and hiding the issue in a tax question isn\'t going to
change that.  (It also has nothing to do with the point
you are answering and bringing up unrelated points
that we have already covered before is just a waste of
time.)

The tax burden would not necessarily be less if you took ships
away from their military mission and used them for something else.
Except that presumably one thought that military mission was
important enough to build those ships in the first place, so
that you now need to build new ships to replace the ships you
took away.  Otherwise, you could just scrap them and lower the
tax rate.

>>My opinion on it is the same.

>I\'m not in the least surprised.

Of course.  Since you haven\'t given may any reason to change it.

	Excellent!  I\'ve been hoping that somebody would archive all the
designs that have come through here.  Some of them have been brutally cool,
others brutally funny (like the Big Blue Machine and the Jet Bong).  They
really deserve saving, not to mention publication so that non-net-enabled
Trav players can benefit from them.  Expect an email blitz from me shortly.

I have just downloaded the latest excel version from you webpage,
translation in the tables is still FUBAR ie beam pointer, primiative drive,
fuels, meson gun all in the tables section. All read #value.

I will try to find Antti Lahtinen <lahtinen@ee.tut.fi> oops found part of
it it is
http://www.ee.tut.fi/~lahtinen/Traveller/MPW-97r2.zip  this one is for

Look around on his web page you should find several excellant FFS1
spreadsheets that he has made. I hear that he is working on a FFS2 series
of spreadsheets too.

Give that there are merchant ships with significantly more

importantly) this ship has fight in the tatical situation
the pirate puts them in, I don\'t agree.  But I guess
we will have to agree to diagree on this.

Aslan are not cats. They are no more closely related to cats than they are to
eggplants. They do not love catnip, they do not meow, and they do not rub
their chin glands on everything in sight. 

FWIW, I think Wildstar\'s take on the situation comes closest to my own. 

Comment #2:
The extent to which alien races find sex enjoyable is a matter for debate. It
is a major drive in Humans, but there is no reason why Aslan should be
subject to the same drives (and no reason for them not to -- this is the sort
of thing GDW preferred to leave up to individual referees). Present day
Terrans have a wide variety of sexual customs and behaviors, and we may
assume that other races are equally (if not more) varied.

I see no reason for the Zhos to frown on the use of prostitutes (indeed, they
are probably a form of therapist in Zhodani culture).

Not all Zhodani are psionic. Many of those who have psi talents have no
talent for telapathy. 

For those who care, I believe the sexual habits of every Traveller alien have
been a topic for argument that has used up almost as much bandwidth as
pirates and (dare I say it) big rocks. Don\'t open the floodgates again...some
people are still wearing their underwear too tight : )

This is an incredible idea.  There is so much creativity on this list, I\'ve always
thought that it is a shame that a lot of it has a shelf life of a day or two.  You
send your stuff to the list, and it is seen only by those TMLers tuning in that
day, then poof, it\'s no longer available to anybody.

I\'ve always wanted to see a "Best Of" TML archive--one that takes all of the house
rules, the NPC\'s, the adventures, the stories, the equipment, the alien race
write-ups, the world and system details and puts them all together in a searchable
database somewhere.

What if you wanted to find something on the planet Tureded in the Spinward
Marches.  To my knowledge, there\'s never been any offical description of the
planet in any Traveller product to date, except for the line or two about it in
the library data section of the MT computer game "Quest for the Ancients".

Yet, I have detailed this world.  It would be nice to store this someplace.

I envision a site where, if you want to find a particular item, you can type it
in, and there you have multiple takes on it by different GM\'s.

Like Regina.  There\'s a lot that\'s been written about it, and I\'m sure different
GM\'s have different takes on the planet when they detail it in their campaigns.

It\'s a shame to let all of this creative effort go to waste.  We should start a
TML archiveing project (which is, of course, much different from the standard TML
archives).

"Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science", Dover Publications: New York,
1957 (1st ed 1952). Chapter 22, "Dianetics":

"Dianetics has not been mentioned in Astounding Science Fiction for many
years. Editor Campbell has found something even more revolutionary --
"psionics," a combination of electronics with psi (psychic) phenomena.
Campbell first wrote about it in an editorial, "The Science of Psionics,"
Astounding, Feb., 1956. The editorial asked his readers if they would like
to see a series of articles about psychic electronic machines. Campbell
described psionics as "honest non-scientific research," pointing out that
"Buddha, Jesus, and President Eisenhower" also are excluded from the
category of "honest scientific research" since they "use methods other than
those used by physicists in their laboratory work." 

"After a resounding "Yea!" from his readers, Campbell ran the first
article, "Psionic Machine -- Type One" in his June, 1956 issue. The article
was written by himself. It tells how to build a Hieronymous machine,
patented in 1949 by one Thomas G. Hieronymous, at that time a resident of
Kansas City, Mo., and tested with positive results by "nuclear physicist"
(see above)
Campbell. The machine was designed by the inventor to analyze the "eloptic
radiation" of minerals, a new type of radiation discovered by Hieronymous.
Among electronic engineers, Hieronymous\' patent (No. 2,482,773) is passed
around for laughs, and considered in a class with Socrates Scholfield\'s
famous patent of 1914 (No. 1,087,186), consisting of two intertwined
helices for demonstrating the existence of God. 

"Campbell thinks Hieronymous\' theory is "cockeyed" and he has also made
several basic changes in the construction of the machine. Hieronymous
claimed that his detector worked on photographs of minerals. Campbell
hasn\'t bothered to test that. Nevertheless, the machine Campbell built did
detect something "not detectable by any standard form of meter," and he
knows there is no "jiggery-poker" because he constructed the thing himself.


"In a lecture on psionics at the New York Science Fiction Convention, 1956,
Campbell displayed his second and "more precise" version of the Hieronymous
machine. It works just as well, he claimed, without the electric power
supply. But it won\'t work, he added, if there is a burned-out vacuum tube!
The device is beautifully subjective. You turn a dial with one hand while
you stroke a plastic plate with the other. The plate is supposed to feel
"sticky" when the dial reaches a certain setting, the setting varying with
each individual. Some people get the proper tactile sensation the first
time they try it. Willy Ley and others at the convention couldn\'t feel a
thing. Campbell solemnly informed his audience that the machine does not
work well with either scientists or mystics. Five mystics tried it, he
stated, and got only random responses. His own personal "hunch" is that the
machine is detecting something "beyond space and time." Or as he expresses
it in the October, 1956 issue of his magazine, "there is a reality-field
other than, and different in nature from, that we know as Science." 

"Another Campbell "hunch" is that the device operates because of certain
"relations" between its parts. Someone at the lecture stood up and asked
the obvious question: had Campbell tried  varying the circuit or even
removing it altogether to see if the device still worked? No, Campbell
hadn\'t tried that. He was just an amateur, he explained, "having fun" with
psionics, and he felt no obligation to try all the experiments that are
possible, particularly without getting paid for it. 

"No one of course expects a researcher to perform all possible experiments
with a device before he publishes results. But one does expect at least a
minimum of experimentation to insure fairly adequate controls. As it is,
psionics promises to be even funnier than dianetics or Ray Palmer\'s Shaver
stories. It suggests once more how far from accurate is the stereotype of
the science fiction fan as a bright, well-informed, scientifically literate
fellow. Judging by the number of Campbell\'s readers who are impressed by
this nonsense, the average fan may very well be a chap in his teens, with a
smattering of scientific knowledge culled mostly from science fiction,
enormously gullible, with a strong bent toward occultism, no understanding
of scientific method, and a basic insecurity for which he compensates by
fantasies of scientific power."

I apologize to those of you who have had trouble with my FF&S spreadsheet
excel version. I am a user of Quattro Pro myself, but I knew the majority
of users out there want Excel. So, I saved it in that format. Apparently,
some of the functions (notably the @fixed() and @concatenate() ) don\'t
translate right, becuase Excel users have had some problems.

I tried to save to Lotus 1-2-3 (so Excel users could import), but I get a
message that some of my strings would have to be truncated. This doesn\'t
sound like it would work either.

If anyone has any ideas on how to make this work, I\'d be interested (other
than the obvious "use Excel!". I don\'t consider that an option).

Again, I\'m sorry that this isn\'t working out the way I wanted...

For those of you interested, if you downloaded the Excel version, you can
fix the #value cells (I think) by doing a search & replace on FIXED( and
CONCATENATE(, replacing them with @FIXED( and @CONCATENATE(. I don\'t know
WHY this works, but it seems to.

If anyone has any insight on the matter, I\'d love to hear it.

No, it\'s a long way from the intent of the author. Farther than even
the most pessimistic could have possibly imagined.

I can remember when people were initially asking "will it include 
the political aspects?" Once it became apparent the answer was no, 
discussion changed to "will it include powered armour"? Or "Will
the basic plot be intact"?

All this was misguided. It turns out what people should *really* have
been asking was "Will it contain teen romance and a co-ed shower
scene?" It\'s been a long time since I read the original, but I\'m
fairly sure there was no shower scene, and that romantic rivalry
was not a major factor in the plot.

I\'ve decided that the movie\'s title and the names of certain characters
are only coincidentally the same as Heinlein\'s novel, but that there is
no other connection.  In that spirit, I\'m looking forward to an evening
of blood, guts, explosions, and more blood with my little brother.  Then

You know, that\'s exactly what it reminds me of, Windows 2.0 or maybe the

Rob, my reference to "clunky interface" referred to Executor\'s not CSC\'s.

Possibly I\'m a bit cranky on this, but I\'ve seen one of my shareware stacks

Yes, and/or make military ships more expensive in both absolute and

Several folks have recommended this.  If you want 3d, do 3d, but it\'s more
complicated than I want to get involved with.  Increasing the number of
"uninteresting" systems is a good idea, though.

>   3b) Let incoming ships precipitate out at 1000 diameter limits instead

TOO MUCH! Good idea, but too much!

Hans, in the Sol system 1000 diameters from Sol is over 9AU, somewhere
between Jupiter and Saturn.  That\'s a *little* far unless you are going to
boost your ship\'s velocity.  A 1g ship will take 195 hours to travel in to
1AU, and a 6g ship will take 80 hours.  It would take a 600g constant boost
to reduce the time to about 8 hours!

You might have better luck with 250 diameters, out just beyond the
asteroids.  That\'s a pretty long journey for 1g ships in to 1AU (78 hours),
but you wanted more time.  BTW, a 6g ship will take about 32 hours from 250
dia out.

>   3c) Allow ships to track and intercept ships in jumpspace.

Nope, don\'t like that one.

If you can come up with one that doesn\'t do *too* much violence to physics
let me know.  I suppose that if you can potentially extract energy from the
vacuum it might be possible to inject it.  <g> I\'ve got some general
problems with that, but haven\'t completely thought it out yet.

How?  Much more expensive?  Many fewer inhabited (and less densely

This is a very good point.  As a matter of fact, I\'ll get up on a soapbox
and generalize it:  Just because Humans do something one particular way
doesn\'t mean that Traveller aliens (even \'human-like\' aliens like Aslan and
Vargr) will do the same thing that same way.  They may do it in a totally
different way, or they may do something else entirely.

The interesting part about aliens in Traveller is looking at why humans
do what they do, and then trying to figure out ways that might be different
for aliens.  Not different for the sake of being silly or odd, but different
for some reason that makes sense in terms of alien biology or social
structures.

>It is a major drive in Humans, but there is no reason why Aslan should be
>subject to the same drives 

Right.  And when working things out, you generally have to start from an
assumption (in my case "Aslan females have a sex drive"), use the known facts
about the race (such as the 3:1 female-to-male ratio and what we know
about Aslan society and naming), and proceed to a solution that makes some 
sort of sense.  This applies to just about everything you\'d want to know
about 
an alien race - this is the way that "classic" hard SF works.

>(and no reason for them not to -- this is the sort
>of thing GDW preferred to leave up to individual referees).

For those of you that are curious, here\'s what I\'ve done when the 
question has come up:
Major Races:
  Humans: We know about those humans, right?
  Aslan: Roughly similar to humans, but drive stronger in females than males.
  Vargr: High-SOC individuales get more chances to mate.  Both sexes find
    sex pleasurable, but sex drive is based on seasonal factors (higher and
    lower at various times of the year).
  Droyne: They\'re not telling, other than that it requires 6 droyne of the
    appropriate castes, and a ceremony that was prescribed by Grandfather.
  Centaurs: The K\'Kree are rather reticent on this topic.
  Hivers: Have sex ("shake hands") constantly, but don\'t seem to notice or 
    care.
Minor Races:
  Dolphins: The horniest creatures in known space (males and females both).

>Present day Terrans have a wide variety of sexual customs and behaviors, 
>and we may assume that other races are equally (if not more) varied.

This points to another pitfall when dealing with aliens in a SF game.  Most
referees tend to play an alien race as one huge monoculture.  Humans are not
like that - the society and behavior of Humans can vary radically from
location to location.  Most Traveller referees recognize that a farm
boy from Rouie will have a different outlook from a kid from the belts 
of Glisten.  Unless there\'s some reason or mechanism that creates a unified 
culture*, aliens can vary as much as humans do.

* And some Traveller aliens do have such a mechanism.  Both the Hivers and
  the Aslan intentionally promote a uniform culture accross their areas of
  space, and both races expend a significant amount of time and energy
  (in the case of the Hivers, by manupulation; the Aslan tend to use 
  military force) keeping their cultures as homogenous as possible, given the 
  realities of interstellar communication.

I dunno, Loren.  ;-)  I made what (I thought) would be a pretty controversial
post, and got nearly no private replies, and only a couple here on the
list.  There\'s more bandwidth being devoted to complaining about Starship 
Troopers and looking for fonts, and I think the piracy debate is the clear
bandwidth leader at the moment.

I think you get the same problem in PE.  I picked a copy of PE the other
day, and have been working on harmonising the military system with WTH,
Striker, INH, TCS, & a host of other MT/CT/TNE material.  I have not got far
yet, but I think at this stage that any consistency will be purely
coincidental:  
For what its worth, at TL15 on an appropriate world, an RU = 5000 MCr, and a
(puny) A1D1T0J4 Starship unit will cost (1*50+1*50+8*50)= 500 Ru or approx 2
500 000MCr.   Enough for lots of little ships, or  a couple of Batrons of
old Tigress class BBs (CT) or about 6-8 really big BBs in TNE, or 1-4 BBs
from Starships of the Imperium (or whatever it was called) in MT.  
Interestingly, Since all units in PE have the same strength across TL, the
smae units costs 2,275,000MCr at TL14, and 3, 000,000 MCr at Tl 13.  Whilst
it is true that as TL decreases, effectiveness decreases AND cost increases,
(in accordance with FF&S v1/2), I do not know if this works out in any of
the starship combat rules in the same proportion as it does in PE, but I may
check this out with BL and BR.
If you only want to build SDBs they cost (for A1D1) 100 RU or about 50 000
MCr worth.  

To put this into perspective: for a Tl 13 Pop 9 (actually 2x10exp9) world
(all calculated according to PE) which had about 4% spent GWP on Military
gave approx 648 RU spent on maintenance, or a force size of 216 RU.  If only
..3 of this were assigned to the imperial navy (see below) for consistency\'s
sake, this would be 64.8 Ru on maintenance if inerstellar military.  If we
were maintaining A1D1J8 (Jump 4 capable starfleets)which cost 30 Ru each we
could maintain 2 of them, call it A2D2J16, This has a value (see above) of 2
x 3 000 000 MCr or 6 000 000 MCr (in local credits, starport Type A)[If all
was spent on interstellar military, approx 21 000 000]

The same figure for TCS are approximately 2 000 000 000  x 500/1 000 000 or
1 000 000 MCr and can be multiplied by up to 10 to account for the gradual
construction of the fleet or 10 000, 000 MCr.  (Imperail navy only)

For striker/INH these figures are:
2 000 000 000 x 3/100 (3%) x 18 000/1 000 000 x .3 (for imperial forces
only- not including system defence of this world) or 324 000MCr or for the
biuggest fleet (as per TCS above) 3 240 000 MCr.

Note that this is only a 2x10EXP9 world...
ERRORS PROBABLE

 It doesn\'t seem to matter what system you use, the imperium has ENORMOUS
resources at its dispposal.

Of course, the Terrans caused substantial problems by having a

By the time the Vilani worked it out...too late. 
Absorbing the Vilani Imperium gave the Terrans the \'missing bits\' of

where they had been deficient before. The \'Vilani TL System\' could then
have been roughly applicable to the Rule of Man and later regimes.

Hello,
  Yes, but upgrading computers costs money, which if it were 
available as cash at some point would obviate the need to
engage in piracy (though not necessarily the desire...). The
economic return issue rears its ugly head, as well as why no
one would simply tag such a grossly over-equipped merchant as
a potential security risk.

  While I support the possibility of part-time pirates looking
for targets of opportunity, I find suggestions of their interest
in challenging purpose built small warships highly dubious. There
is no cargo, and no ship to take in the (highly) unlikely case
that they win.

  If the 200 ton /60 MCr traders represent the typical free trader,
then what would the maximum practical free trader be for operation
as a corsair? Could a 400 Dt J-2 design function profitably as a 
free trader while mounting hardware capable of fighting off a
Type T (?) patrol vessel?

  PS - for further pursuit of firepower issues, hard numbers as to
maximum practical size of merchant-pirates, relative TL\'s, and
ship combat systems will be needed. I\'m currently projecting based
on TL 12 equality, for CT/High Guard.

        Yours truly,

I agree that this SDB is weak, but it should handle most Free Trader size
pirates. Probably you\'d want 2 or more for any corsairs. (The computer
upgrade for the pirate to go anywhere near meeting the level 9 computer on
the SDB would need a power plant upgrade too in High Guard).

But I agree with you that this discussion is getting nowhere, and that we
all appear to have selected our trenches. As a result, I don\'t intend to

Sure. Now tell me how to get my Mac+ to *talk* TCP/IP. It\'s got an
Appletalk(serial) port, a printer (serial) port, a SCSI port, a floppy
port and a mouse port. And *no* slots.

For that matter, is there a way to get my PCs to talk TCP/IP and still
run Netware Lite on top of it? Or tell me how to get the same level of
file and device sharing.

While you are at it, tell me how to network my Aplle II clone and my
TRS-80s with the Mac and PCs. :-)

More likely INT was chosen as being the closest match to "will". It

Well, one possibility is negative matter. It\'s got a whole host of
handling difficulties, and manufacturing it should be a real pain (In
theory, you should *produce* energy by making it, but the same theory
would also have it being "easy" to create).

On the down side, I can\'t see why negative matter production should be
easier than using antimatter for power. Maybe it\'s something that the
control of nuclear force that leads to dampers also makes possible.

One "neat" effect for damage to ships using it is "loss of
containment". If negamatter hits normal matter (or antimatter!) they
both canel each other. No radiation, no nothing. Just *gone*. 

I *think* that it\'d be a great "heat sink", but we (the gearheads) will
have to play with the idea for a bit to see just *how* good it might be.

Well, you might want to check out the Win95 version of TakeCommand (a

Also thoroughly trashed on the net back when the book first came out.
You see, pi\'s value is a matter of *definition*. That is, regardless of
the characteristics of the universe, it will always have the same value
because its value derives from basic definitions of mathematics (not
even geometry!). 

Among other things, it\'s related to e (base of the natural logarithms)
in several ways. The one I recall is:

                i      -pi/2
               i   =  e

That is: i to the ith power equals e to the negative one-half pi power.

It\'s a neat idea, it\'s just not *possible*. 

Also, I *think* (I may be wrong about this) that *any* sequence of
digits will turn up in *any* irrational number if you carry it out to
enough digits. It\'s a sort of "monkeys with typewriters" effect. So
that kills it too.

And in any case, if the military loosens up enough to allow
"fraternization", then you are likely going to have a noticeable
percentage of the troops interested in the *same* sex. After all, if
regs allow it, one thing combat soldiers of *any* sex are not is *shy*!

Substitute "Marines" for "Legion" in the above to get a sign that *is*

As I recall, it *does* take extra time. And it reduces the spread to
something like +/- 30 minutes.

It doesn\'t work that well for the military either. At 1000 diameters,
you have to worry about the *star*, not just the planet (actually, in
some systems you have to worry about the star even at 100 diameters).

That makes the jump limit for the Sol system (for "synchronized" jumps)
9 AU. As someone pointed out when 1000 diameters was suggested for
something else, that\'s *weeks* at high acceleration. The enemy has time
to do almost anything.

The final NOTE quoted is so typical of male military bulshittism that I\'d
say offhand it has to come from some of the sillywood productions - Top gun

The Argon gambit adventure was one of the most interesting adventures I\'ve
ever ran as there isn\'t really a solution for the PC in the adventure
itself. I\'d like to see more of these brains/detective style adventures a
la Argon gambit and Murder on Arcturus station where the adventure is
basically a plot with motivation for all the major NPCs. More work for the
ref but thats OK. The Jason Grant character in Argon gambit was so
impressive according to my my players that I brought him along as a Naval
Intelligence boss in my Spinward marches campaign until one of my PCs
retired him (shot in the back at 100+ m from an pistolshot).

maybe :)

The .1ls scheme coresponds to the old Brilliant Lances system where the
ranges also equaled hexes (1hex-2hex-4hex-8hex). I\'m no physisist, but
these numbers seem more reasonable than SSDSs ranges.

For example, here are ranges in km:

          Short    Med     Long         Ext
SSDS    300,000  600,000  1,200,000   2,400,000
FF&S     30,000   60,000    120,000     240,000

I like the FF&S system - I have trouble imagining engaging a target at 1.2
million kilometers. But, it does mean that my spreadsheet\'s weapon USPs are
incompatable with SSDS.

Any comments?

I thought there was actually a considerable amount of variation in the
Aslan \'culture\'. Various clans tended to have similar culture (mores,
social rituals, customs, outlooks, etc) within the clan, but other than
the clan being the basis of government, and biologically mediated factors
(there\'s a 3:1 female:male ratio, males are driven to claim large
territories) there was considerable variation between clans, as much as
say, the difference between that boy on Ruie, and a girl on Sylea.

While we\'re looking at biologically related determinants of culture, VArgr
are going to be pretty territory-driven as well. They\'re derived from pack
animals which stake out huge hunting territories and vigorously defend
them from strangers.

Perhaps the long standing tradition of Vargr raiding is based on a \'pack\'
claiming new hunting grounds.

Man o man, I wonder what the life of an omega Vargr is like...

one hex (30,000km)

Please note that Andy\'s spreadsheet calculates USP damages at 1-2-4-8 hexes.

This previously classified and experimental weapon was devloped by X-TEK R&D 
for its "Totenshadde" or Deathshadow class Meson Assault Scout.  It is 
effectively a scaled down Meson Spinal Mount.  It\'s range is somewhat 
limited due to the length of the accelerator and damage is little more than 
that of a overpowered standard laser at the same tech level, but the 
advantage of a meson weapon is its ability to foil armour and sand. It is 
known that most pocket empires and pirate bands to not have meson screen 
capability, so this weapon will give the imperium a definite advantage. 
 Ever see a small, fast ship carrying one of the most fearsome weapons 
technology can create?  You will and X-TEK will bring it to you!

Zhunastu developed the Fusion+ which helped develop the Modern Fighter.
X-TEK now gives a new technology to further the protection of the empire 
with its
10 Ton Meson Pod.

And why is that (aside from the roleplaying aspect of the picket ships may
not have your shipdata). Even if Traveller computers generally are lame
compared to todays I\'d suspect some improvement over the next thousand
years.

Hm, well, you know, the way I read the Aslan is that there is one drive 
that probably supercedes the sex drive at least in males - the need to own 
land. Now, I realize that the ability of the Ihatei (sp?) to invade and 
conquer even a single Imperial world has long been up for debate, but that 
aside, there seem to be a _lot_ of Aslan social structures that revolve 
around landless males trying to get some land.

So, for me, the list of known facts would be:

 - everyone has a sex drive (duh!)
 - Aslan males really, really, REALLY like owning land - to the exclusion 
    of almost everything else (like money, for example)
 - Aslan have that nasty 3:1 sex ratio

Aslo, because of the last point, the Aslan would have a really bad 
population problem if they had human-like sex drives - they\'d be
able to produce children at 3 times the human rate, assuming similar
rates of fertiliy and similar gestation periods. So, maybe Aslan 
females aren\'t constantly fertile like human females, maybe they
go through a short period of estrus (is that the right word?) on
an annual basis. That would relieve most of the need for contraception
if they wanted to have casual sex. Maybe there are"alpha" and "beta"
females where only one of the castes gets to breed (is the lower caste
forced to breed or is the higher caste granted the privledge of breeding?)
There are lots of possibilities.

Personally, I would go with saying that Aslan sex habits vary somewhat,
depending on social standing and with regional differences, but that 
for the most part, females aren\'t in estrus and males are more concerned 
with getting a piece of land than with getting a piece of ass.

Of course, you may want to stand back during that one week of the Aslan
year...

Human 1 : What\'s with our female Aslan engineer?
Human 2 : Don\'t ask.
Human 1 : She\'s been clawing at that stateroom door for 2 days now.
          What\'s in there?
Human 2 : That Aslan mercenary squad we picked up back on Regina.
          They\'ve locked themselves in and keep screaming over
          the intercom for help.
Human 1 : This is going to be a looooong jump...

In one of the earlier TD issues I think they equated "will" with average of

Ah but then Determination (Int + End) should be the modifier, not

>Do any of you Pocket Empires owners have any ideas on quantifying the vague
>military values for the "forces" in the game?  

As Colin Hutchinson has pointed out, one way is simply in monetary terms:
forces cost RU; RU can be converted into Cr. However, those Cr are divided
between the actual forces and their supporting infrastructure (from
buildings to staff) as well as on the separate maintenance budget, etc.

The important thing to note is that equating RU directly with a cash Cr
value is dangerous, because RU are supposed to represent a more general
economic quantity which combines resources, man-power, *training*,
infrastructure, etc. So you can\'t directly equate X RU = Y Cr = Z batrons or
SDBs or whatever.

Given the above, I\'d estimate perhaps 1/5 of so of the Cr value is actually
military hardware - whether starships or tanks, while perhaps another 1/5 is
the pay of the troops - given the old Book 4 Mercenary pay values, you could
estimate the number of troops this equates to. Perhaps someone with some
knowledge of current army expenditure could give you a realistic figure for
these?

The problem with PE was trying to find a simple method of describing
military combat factors at a higher level than Battle Rider/Brilliant
Lances/Fifth Frontier War, which was also fairly independent of the TL and
didn\'t involve lots of complicated multiplication factors. Basing everything
around equivalent RU cost seemed the optimal method at the time. I\'m not
claiming that it\'s perfect by any means, and if someone felt that the Cr/RU
ratio was out for the military sections, then you could adjust the RU costs
for Attk, Def, etc. factors accordingly. The relative costing of Attk/Def
vs. Transport and Jump factors was based in part on my analysis of the
relative costs of weaponry, ship hull and drives in the QSDS and SSDS
systems. How that now relates to FF&S2 I\'ve not checked.

I\'m interested in hearing any feedback from anyone who\'s used Pocket Empires
in anger, whether for combat, empire building or single world development.

Thanks

You can only connect Mac\'s and PC\'s up with TCP/IP through ethernet.

If you have a Mac Plus with no internal expansion, what you need is a
SCSI Ethernet Adaptor or EtherWave Adaptor.

Those who want to configure TCP/IP for a local network can check this
address:
<http://www.ambrosiasw.com/netgames/configTCP.html>

Mac info is up. Win95 is under construction.

When I read the book, I got the impression that Sagan was suggesting that
the universe had been created specifically with this message contained in
its ontological (if that\'s the right word) substance.

Agree with you there.  I thought it was a really neat idea, until I thought
of this.  There\'s a digital recording of Milli Vanilli\'s first album in
there, too.

I\'ve searched this year\'s worth of TMLs and have not found anything to
indicate that DGP is doing _anything_, or they have any prospect of doing
_anything_. Not a peep about any new sci-fi campaign, and, as of yet, no
sign of any release.

Now, if I were cynical, I would say that they are better than ever at doing
nothing. The future holds larger prospects of nothingness. Which is what I
would expect from the current management of DGP. And that he will release a
new version of nothing in 1997. So, if you apply a certain interpretation,
Roger isn\'t necessarily lying except about keeping us informed.

So, Roger: inform us. Is this all _completely_ bogus, or will you someday
_do_ something and make me eat my words?

I\'ve often thought of Vargr pack dominance being a bigger drive than sex,
per se -- plenty of para-sexual display and behavior that is really "about"
control and prestige rather than sexual/reproductive gratification.  Which
is little consolation to players when their Vargr commanding officer tries
to mount whenever they report for duty...  player _characters_, I mean.

This is an interesting topic in itself -- it seems that the Two Thousand
Worlds also promote a homogenous culture, and the Zhodani Consulate as well
(perhaps).  Only the Vargr Extents, the Imperium member worlds, and the
Solomani lack a pervasive sort of cultural integration.  In a (really)
loose sense, it seems like the Imperium and the Solomani Sphere are more
like bureaucratic or patrimonial empires, while the Consulate and
Federation are more like "nation-states".

Starship troopers are sexy, pirates are sexier, fonts are the sexiest...

Actually, out to 9 AU is 8 or 9 days according to the MTRC, and that\'s at 1G.

The US Army allows its soldiers to screw themselves silly as long as your
partner is of the opposite sex, not of vastly different rank, and consents.

Speaking as a "Chapter 15" case myself, the number of soldiers who came to
me and admitted they were gay or bi during my discharge proceedings was
comical.  If I had spoken up to CID, the 25th Infantry Division would have
been rendered mission-incapable.

I would still encourage FF&S2 for ships first, as that is what I use more.

For a truly ugly solution, buy an Appletalk-Ethernet router.  They cost a

Synchronization does take extra time, but it\'s time spent in preperation.
Take the Navy\'s Blue Angels.  These guys regularly flew withing inches of
each other at very high speeds.  Doing this takes excellent pilots and
intensive training.  Your average F/A-18 mission isn\'t going to require
that level of coordination.

You are the commander of the 173rd Fleet, and you are making a jump to a
hostile world.  Your staff will be carefully selecting who jumps when, and
setting up the formations.  Each of those ships\' navigators will be burning
the midnight photons checking and double checking the numbers to insure
that when they come out of jump, they won\'t be all alone.

(This might be a reason why the Imperium likes really BIG ships, and hasn\'t
flooded space with little pirate-catching escorts.. the need for a ship to
survive until the rest of the fleet breaks out of j-space.)

I imagine that the entries into j-space must be timed down to the last
second, and any deviation will result in a ship "dropping formation" and
being subject to normal jump time deviation.

Well, you *can* jump from inside 10 diameters, it\'s just not very smart.

Well, the safe jump distance from a Size A world is about .01 AU.  A rough
estimate of 1000 diameters is therefore .1 AU.  According to the MT
Referee\'s Companion (pg 21) it would only take about 21 hours to get out
that far using 1G acceleration.  I could see where most if not all
merchants would accept the additional two days in N-space over the
randomness of J-space.

It also gives those pesky pirates more room to work in....  :)

Interesting concept.

An important issue - mission creep because of civilian complaints.  If
piracy of very expensive vessels happens regularly, then either the
citizens will complain, the citizens will build deadly vessels themselves,
or the Navy will stop it.  From what you said, you feel the citizens of the
unpopular planets will just whine about it, as you previously noted that
you could not see the Imperium allowing private navies that could rival
their own.  (I must agree with that - I cannot see any Empire allowing a
world to get built up enough that it could secede.)

Even when it is not in their interest, modern Navies send destroyers about
in order to express frightfulness.  It is possible that the Imperium would
not do that, but the level of resources possessed is so large compared to
the area required to patrol that they could without materially affecting
their striking power (1% is not a major difference to their fleet makeup.
I know you argue that just because they have the capability, they will not
choose to use it, but given the political pressure, it seems like the
Imperium would be war torn if it did not.)

Were the items at risk not as expensive as the yearly maintenance on ~5
defender ships of similar size, or one good sized patrol craft that could
crush any casual pirate, then the situation changes.  Insurers will not
care as much, and if one merchant in a million is lost, then it become more
like car jacking than the Lindbergh kidnapping.

He is using the exact same technique you are.  Both of you assert your
views as if they are fact, when in reality, they are both based on rather
large chains of assumption about the rules, the politics, and other
details.  It is my opinion that Hans arguments carry more weight, but that
is because he is arguing from a very numerical resources/costs basis, and I
am an engineer working for economists.  That kind of argument is going to
appeal to me.  Both you and he have noted several critical differing
assumptions.

(Example: Hans cannot see how using 1% of a pre-existing force to stop
piracy of very expensive vessels could be avoided, and you cannot see why
the Navy would ever face sufficient pressure to use any fraction, no matter
how small, of its forces in response to a world that was not high
population, given that the Empire only needs the high pop worlds anyway.)

Both of your respond whenever this thread comes up, each hoping to win by
exhaustion, and each a bit mystified, I suspect, about why the other cannot
see what is, to you, obvious.  (NB, my camp is pretty obvious from my above
comments.)

I cannot imagine either one of you being willing to let the other one get
the last post at this point, but there is a simple way to prove me
completely off base - do not reply to this or any other piracy thread.  Do
not post a "this is my last word on the subject" post, just stop posting.

See if the other parties, like me, in this debate do the same, once the two
of you stop.

If you are having fun with it, then by all means go ahead and continue - I
certainly am not the list cop, but if you want to use the (implied)
argument you did above, that Hans was not adding anything new to the
debate, and should just stop, consider that this is likely how all of us
who still post on the thread look.

I like this solution... interesting.  It seems that Aslan males are victims
of a system that\'s the close cousin of a human male fantasy (c.f. Russ
Meyer, esp. _Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!_) -- meek, earnest men being
outnumbered and terrorized by swarms of agressive and sexually voracious
women.  How ironic!

PS -- would Aslan males know how to lock a door? Or turn on the intercom? <G>

Second in a new generation of plasma-armed gravtanks, the Abivard boasts a
heavy plasma cannon and rapid-firing autocannon in turret mounts. The power
plant is rated to supply continuous power to the plasma cannon; a platoon of
Peroz gravtanks can devastate vast areas in a short period of time. The
autocannon is primarily used in a defensive role against incoming missiles
and infantry attacks. 

The Abivard is moderately armoured, but still relies mainly on its speed and
agility to survive.

1 armour rating
     
Performance:
     100 kW TL4 Internal Combustion power plant;  Fuel: 50.0 L of
hydrocarbons (50.0 kg), 5 hours supply
     Propulsion System: 100 kW wheels with off-road suspension; 
Maximum Speed: 109 km/h; 
Range: 545 km;  Agility: +1DM (0.2G)
Crew:
     Crew roster: driver;  1 external crew station
Communications:
     No communicators installed.
Sensors:

Off-road motorbike racing is very popular with lower-social-standing
inhabitants of many worlds. Races are typically run over convoluted courses
requiring speed, endurance, and skill to complete. 

The Mishnak is an ideal bike for a cross-country race. It is fast,
maneuverable, and has excellent off-road handling. This model is stripped
down to the bare essentials, which lowers price and increases speed.

The Kaalin is an ideal bike for a cross-country race. It is fast,
maneuverable, and has excellent off-road handling. Essentially an upgraded
Astraan, the Kaalin is almost 50 km/h faster.  Manufacturing improvements
have lowered the price by over Cr2000, as well.  This model is stripped down

The Astraan is an ideal bike for a cross-country race. It is fast,
maneuverable, and has excellent off-road handling. An alloy frame and
improved internal combustion engine lower mass, increasing speed by over 20
km/h over the slightly cheaper Mishnak.  Most serious racers find the extra
performance well worth the slight increase in price.  This model is stripped
down to the bare essentials, which lowers price and increases speed.

    'body' => 'Gentle Travellers,

After reading posts with numbers and arguments good and suspect,
I\'ve considered bits of canon with bits of thought and decided:

1) SDBs are sufficient deterrent to pirates, but are only in force
   on class A and B starported systems.  Why this would be, I am
   not sure.

2) Lower-class starports do not field many (or any) SDBs, and thus 
   may have pirates lurking about.

3) For some reason most traders are not armed (!!).  Why this would
   be, I am not sure.

4) Pirates are lightly armed and steal cargo.  Why they would not
   normally steal an entire ship, I am not sure.

5) Pirates would not normally fool with other armed ships.

Now, our Traveller group would never even think of running a ship
weaponless.  Heavens, a laser battery is only a fraction of the
cost of a ship.  Also, our Traveller group probably figures any
pirates willing to run down another ship will take everything and
either strand or kill the victims.  It\'s a rough universe.


As an aside, I have occasionally wondered why the Classic
Traveller\'s ship construction rules seem easier than the
others.  Of course, everything is simplified, but really 
there isn\'t that great a difference, yes?

I think what I may try to do is forward-engineer the QSDS
or SSDS down into a simplified system, similar to the Classic
system.  Any thoughts?

Exactly! Thank you!

And if some other things are done well: good cinematography, a tight
script, good special effects, all the better.

Just because the movie isn\'t "The English Patient" doesn\'t mean it\'s not
worth seeing.

Perhaps I should have stated that in the proper context:

The movie approaches the original intent of the author *as close as you\'re
likely to get from Hollywood*.

The film is about young troops getting their mettle tested by a difficult
military challenge. A testosterone-infused coming-of-age tale. Which is, at
least in part, what the book was about. The fascistic appearance and feel
of the Terran military also seems fairly accurate based on the trailers
I\'ve seen and what I\'ve read.

I\'ve read the book. I\'m not speaking from ignorance here. There\'s no way
the book is a feasible financial or marketable concept in its original
state. Verhoeven has taken the concept, and as is done in Hollywood, and
changed things to make it a movie.

I don\'t know why I beat this dead horse every time, but people have got to
realize that film making is a business. There are millions of dollars
involved. It\'s too bad that the reality of vector physics isn\'t observed
and that powered armor will not be shown, but the simple fact of the matter
is that audiences want sound effects in space. Fighter jets and WWII movies
are their point of reference for starships and ground troops, respectively.

For a successful film, you have to market it to the lowest common
denominator to a certain extent. Now, that doesn\'t mean you can\'t do some
smart film making to satisfy more intellectually developed members of the
audience, but big-budget sci-fi films *have* to get a big return at the box
office or they aren\'t made.

If the movie is good on a visceral level, people shouldn\'t turn their noses
up to it. Success of sci-fi movies like Starship Troopers can only breed
*more* sci-fi films and continued opportunities to make better ones.

Again, adhering to the letter of Robert Heinlein would be an unprofitable
venture. I don\'t see how a group shower scene or some teen romance will
detract from this movie. It\'s entertainment. If you want to see films that
pay more strict homage to the original material, see a smaller independent
film like "Moll Flanders" or "The Mill on the Floss."

are their point of reference for starships and ground troops, respectively.

For a successful film, you have to market it to the lowest common
denominator to a certain extent. Now, that doesn\'t mean you can\'t do some
smart film making to satisfy more intellectually developed members of the
audience, but big-budget sci-fi films *have* to get a big return at the box
office or they aren\'t made.

If the movie is good on a visceral level, people shouldn\'t turn their noses
up to it. Success of sci-fi movies like Starship Troopers can only breed
*more* sci-fi films and continued opportunities to make better ones.

Again, adhering to the letter of Robert Heinlein would be an unprofitable
venture. I don\'t see how a group shower scene or some teen romance will
detract from this movie. It\'s entertainment. If you want to see films that
pay more strict homage to the original material, see a smaller independent
film like "Moll Flanders" or "The Mill on the Floss."

Now, there is a movie series that is begging to be made!  Jerry Pournelle did a
really good job with that series - even when he expanded it far beyond the
original scope!

Anders,

I would have liked to have made this cleaner, but my workload is increasing
(finally!) so I have only been able to work on my reply in \'spurts\'.  (ie a couple
of minutes here, a couple of minutes there).My reasoning:

Assumed - A detailed registry of all ships in the Sector and surrounding sectors
exists.  (See Ship\'s Registration and Crew Certifications

 Assumed (extrapolating from current practices) -  Military ship contracts are
offered to a variety of Naval Architects, representing shipyards around the sector,
and are awarded to the lowest bidder.

Assumed (extrapolating from current practices) -  Ship upgrades, repairs and
maintenance services will be offered to various corporations (to be performed at
Navy Shipyards) and starports (for outsourced work), and will be awarded to the
lowest bidder.

Confident -  Shipboard maintenance and minor upgrades will be performed by ship\'s
personnel.

Assumed (interpreting from canon sources) - Most enlisted personnel (the
technicians) serving in the military are conscripts.

Confident - The companies that pad the bids with \'frill\' components will not get
the contracts (look at some of the ships that THUDD have generated...some really
nice ones, but the winners are the ones that come closest to the announced
specification, and cost the least).

Confident -  Memory and disk storage are components.

Assumed - There will be a certain amount of redundant storage space for emergancies
(failures, etc...)

Assumed - Larger ships will benefit from economies of scale.

Assumed - At a certain point, the amount of unused space will allow for some
luxuries (i.e. data not having to do with military functions) to be added (such as
a full civilian ship\'s registry).

Assumed - Cruisers are the smallest class of ship (10,000 dton +) where such
economies of scale begin to be commonplace.

Conclusion =  Military ship that are built by lowest bid companies, maintained by
lowest bid starports, and manned by conscripts and a smattering of volunteers.
Ships such as Patrol ships, Escorts and Destroyers are all smaller (5,000 dTon-)
ships that do not have a large profit margin - or margin for extras.  Larger ships
such as Cruisers, Battleships, Fleet Carriers, and Dreadnaughts benefit from
economy of scale, and will have margins for extras.  Additionally, such ships are
intended to act as command and control points, and it is logical to assume that
they would be routed such information.

Designed for coastal defense, the Triumph allocates most of its internal
space to guns and magazines. In normal usage the ship is accompanied by a
fleet coaler to top off its bunkers on a daily basis. Although it has
moderate armour, theTriumph is essentially a floating gun platform intended
to fight in concert with coastal fortifications and lighter screening ships. 

A kitchen provides hot meals for the crew, but little else in the way of
amenities is provided. Being so close to port, the crew needs no recreational
facilities, instead being granted regular shore leave.

- ----
After a lengthy development period we\'ve finally released our new MapMaker
Fonts package.

This is a special set of 9 fonts specifically designed for gamemasters and
game designers who need to make maps and plans for their scenarios or
settings.

The idea of the MapMaker Fonts collection is to use the convenience of
one-keystroke access to make it possible to create original maps and plans
with extraordinary easy and speed on your computer.

Fonts in the package include:

Basilica - each character is an architectural element which can be
combined to make a wide variety of floor plans.

Ortelius - each character is a geographical feature which can be combined
with other characters to make a regional or world map.

Floorplans - each character is a historical building floorplan, including
churches, castles, houses and more.

Landscape - each character is a large scale landscape feature - trees,
bushes, rocks, etc, for mapping terrain.

Cityscape - each charactr is a profile of a building, including famous
landmarks, which can be combined to make a skyline of a city.

Also included are a number of attractive titling and captioning fonts for
use on your maps.

These are all original font designs, and they are available in both
TrueType and PostScript format for PC and MacOS based computers.  Unlike
traditional map-making software, these fonts allow you to use your
preferred art or DTP program, let you work in any scale you like, and
print at high resolution.

You can preview the package on our webiste, plus there\'s a shareware
version of the Ortelius font to try out AND a map design contest.

Check the package out at http://www.ragnarokpress.com/mapmaker

Well, I\'m not sure why everyone knows you have such a
highly equiped equiped computer.  The fact is that
the Rebellion sourcebook has a model of ships designed
to hide the fact that it not only has a bigger computer,
but also more weaponry and a bigger jump and maneuver
rating than it is suppose to have.

As to the economics, the cost is small wrt to the ship
and so it is realy the same issue about whether someone
who owns a ship would engage in piracy.  I haven\'t
formed an opinion on this except to note that there
are so many ways you could be using a ship as to make
such an analysis mostly a case of guess work.  Ships
could be making money based on other trade (legit
trade, trade outside the Imperium, shipments that
other corps might want to interfere with, smugglers
with rivals, etc.) and only engage in piracy on the
side.  Similarly a ship could be so heavily in hock
that selling it would generate not revenue (and provide
a desperate need for new revenue).

If you have, as people suggested, only one small system
defense boat guarding a sytem, then taking it out lets
you prey and any number of ships for some time.  A
small SDB is out gunned by even some moderate sized
merchants and it only take one ruthless person to
decide to get a couple of friends to take one out
so he can attack ships without fear of retaliation.

>  If the 200 ton /60 MCr traders represent the typical free trader

Um, no.  If you read the description this are tramp traders
operating on the leavings of larger ships.  In fact,
the rebellion source book lists a trader that is considerably
bigger and is still just a frontier transport operating
off of the main routes.  Nor can the
system defense boat be designed to handle a "typical"
ship.  It has to be designed to handle the biggest ships
that it comes up agaisnt in situation where those ships
can determine the tatical sitautions.  That is the inherent
problem in these types of situation and is the reason why
we had so much trouble in Vietnam in spite of superior
firepower.

Well, remember that is not clear that vargr are any more close
related to canines than we are to primates.  The fact that
they weren\'t as "highly evolved" as humans when the ancients
came along may have been more than made up for by the ancients
genetic manipulation.  Primates are just as pack orientated
as canines are and they have similar dominate male and female
hierarchies.

I should add that there are other irrational numbers for which arbitrary
sequences of digits will show up somewhere (I think), but I\'m sure there\'s
no proof one way or another what category pi is in.

However, even if pi does have all arbitrary sequences in it, in "Contact"
the circle showed up very early (relatively speaking) in pi - well before
you would expect it due to random chance.

Not true.  You can run Mac TCP/IP through Appletalk too.  I did
this for anumber of years before I got an ethernet line
put into my office.  If the poster has access to an Appletalk
line, he just needs to hook it up and start running
MacTCP.  If he has not connection, he needs a modem,
and internet service provider, PPP or SLIP software
(there is some for free out there) and MacTCP.  If
he only has access to ethernet, then he needs the hardware

Definitely not. For example, 0.121121112111121111121111112... is 
irrational, but no digits other than 1 or 2 will appear.

Whether the circle-in-pi is "valid" or not is more a question of 
philosphy...Yes, pi is built into mathematics, not into circles, but I always
interpreted it as indicating that the creator of the universe built mathematics
at some meta-level...a strange idea from an extreme aethist such as Sagan,
admittedly.

Actually, short/medium/long/extreme in FFS1 were set by your beam pointer - 
they could be anything from 1/2/4/8 hexes to 10/20/40/80. SSDS rather
arbitarily picked the longest of these as its range bands (a mistake, since
at low TL\'s it\'s hard to make weapons with ranges this good...and in BL,
maximum weapon range due to the range DM\'s was abotu 40 hexes anyway.)

>Any comments?

Your spreadsheet should probably use the FFS system of having ranges set
by the beam pointer. 1.2 million km ranges aren\'t actually ludicrous. Clearly
(at high TL\'s) you can build lasers that have decent damage at those levels...
and it\'s actually not impossible to build lasers that can hit constant-
velocity targets at those ranges, even with TL-8 technology. What will limit
ranges is evasion - the ability of the target to randomly change its position
in the few seconds of there-and-back-again lightspeed lag between detection
and arrival of the laser pulse. It\'s unclear at what range this begins to 
become an issue - it\'s highly non-linear and depends on assumptions about
spacecraft pitch and yaw rates - but it\'s certainly more than 240,000km.
(This has been detbated at length on the list formerly known as gdw-beta.)

Some people have expressed concern with a large number of @ERRs or #VALUEs

I have just downloaded and installed the Bilanidin font, and I think it looks
great as well. So here\'s the next task...

What letters are there in the Vilani alphabet and what are the equivalents
between those sounds and the Bilanidin symbols. Since there are 26 symbols,
we need to determine what each one\'s sound is...

At the same time, should we revise or restructure the Vilani sounds... and

So, you play Vargr basically like... apes? Chimps? Sportscasters?
I mean, since when do humans not display pack dominance via para-sexual
behaviour? Or via outright sexual behaviour?

Hm... can TML digests be used in court? I hope not. May a psychologist
never connect me to "Faster, Pussycat!" in public.

Anyway, I didn\'t really picture Aslan females as "Faster, Pussycat!" types
as much as I thought of that Star Trek episode... you know, the one where
Spock gets the "seven year itch" and has to return to Vulcan to mate
or do whatever it was he needed to do. I envision Aslan females thinking of
estrus as a "taboo" kinda subject and, if they\'re single, perhaps isolating
themselves during their mating period. Sort of a physical denial-monastic 
thing. Of course, not every society will be the same.

It is, of course, somewhat iffy as to whether you can become the dominant
on your homeworld if you\'re still locked (as a race) in estrus cycles, as I\'ve
heard theories that the human ability to mate year-round was critical to
our evolution, but the concept of a sentient race whose members go into
"heat" is interesting nonetheless.

As long as the door knob or intercom switch looks like either a sword hilt
or a trigger, sure.

Well, it depends.  If you buy that human male sex drive is
higher than human female sex drive, then this can be interpreted
as occuring because one man can have children with multiple
partners while multiple partners doesn\'t increase the
number of children a female can have.  The 3 to 1
ratio may modify things a _bit_ with Aslan, but this
dynamic would, IMO, still hold.

As far as how fundamental the clan structure for
mating is.  The Aslan are presented as being drived
from a species where males would
have sole access to a group a females (like a number
of Terran mamalian species of which lions are only
one example).  Among our closest relatives, is also
true.  Males collect harems of females (and since
the male female ratio is 1:1 this is more at the
expense of other males).  Among primates, females
"cheating" on the dominate male behind his back
occurs.  I don\'t know about other species.

My guess is that a "single" female (ie own that is
still living with her parent clan) would have an
attitude similar to a human woman from a society that
does not believe in premarital sex (ie it happens,
but it isn\'t suppose to) though clans being willing
to accept in offspring from their "unmarried" female
ofspring, or access to reliable birth control being
seen as removing problems with casual sex, then this
might be relaxed.  I would think that "married" Aslan
would be similar to married human females (again from
a society that values fidelity highly).

just like with humans....

Unclear.  Such seaonal variations occur so births occur when
prey is plentifull.  However, it is not clear if this would
have been dropped out by the ancients (to aid in breeding)
or would have been lost in evolution on Lair.

I don\'t think that the actual sex act requires all 6 droynes present.
I only requires one of the female cast (what is that name again...)
and one of the Alpha male casts (Leaders and Sports) who are
living in proximity with a Beta male (Techinician, Warrior, etc)
Nor do I think the Grandfather prescribed the cermony where the
ofspring were concieved, just the one where they were casted.

>This points to another pitfall when dealing with aliens in a SF game.  Most

There is a tension here.  You want them to be fundamentally
different, but not clones of each other.   IMO the thing to
do is first note what the human "average" is and then realize
that one is discussing how "average alien" varies from and
average human.  (Realising that one is _not_ discussing
the one place that all aliens fit in compared to the
range of human behavior).

For all it\'s flaws, Star Trek does  good job of showing
Kligons to be different in out look while still showing
variation between the Klingon characters presented (for
example, some are more weasly, some more jovial, and
some more stuck on honor, all within the klingon range
of variation than the human).

Vargr males should be rather insane on the subject (as Vargr males tend
to be on every subject).  They\'re always ready, but females are only in
estrus a few times a year.  Vargr from most cultures are oriented
towards material benefits and pleasure, so sex would be very important
to them.

some herd-type behaviors, like one dominant male being bonded to several
females.

Given the other things that the Ancients did, I suspect a DM can rule
virtually anything as reasonable.  I suspect that giving up the inherent
chaos of Vargr society, or the rapidly changing charisma would be a bad idea.

I will likely use the idea that a good "first crack" assessment of Vargr or
Aslan behavior would be the terrestrial wolf and tiger, as both of those
are fairly near the top of the food chain in their environments.  On the
other hand, I also use chimp behavior as a good first assessment for human
behavior on the part of other races.

The model is not great, but it explains enough that someone foolish enough
to use it for anything more than a rough guess will suffer what they deserve.

Well, this is a different topic.  Would complaints push
the Imperium to divert forces away from the military
toward piracy?  Of course the answer is that "it depends".
It depends on the losses due to piracy, the percieved
losses due to piracy, how much the Imperium listens
to complaints, etc.  This is really the "how much
does the Imperium want to get rid of piracy question"
and, to me, is clearly something that depends on how
the GM set up the campaign.

As to armed ships.  The Imperium _does_ allowed merchants
to be armed on they often are.  Otherwise you wouldn\'t
see all those armed merchant designs in CT and MT source
books and all merchants wouldn\'t automatically come with
hardpoints waiting for weapons.

Well, I\'ve said before large organization don\'t just blow
away 1% of their resources like that.  The US military
cares very much if congress were to cut their budget
1%.  Similarly NASA is only about 1 or 2% of the US budget
but it doesn\'t get money without anyone caring because it
is such a small amount.

>I know you argue that just because they have the capability, they will not
>choose to use it, but given the political pressure, it seems like the

I find this highly debatable.   The Imperium is not going
to be torn by civil war because it didn\'t divert 1% of
it\'s miltary budget to stopping one kind of crime any
more than the large US cities are torn by civil strife
because the US doesn\'t take 1% of the US military and
use them to wipe out transit crime.

Mercants aren\'t going to get to bent out of shape if
they have us much chance of getting mugged in the starport
as they do of pirates taking their cargoes.  Things are
different if piracy is so rampant that ships are being
taken left and right, but that is not what I\'m talking
about.

Yeah, but it is, in fact, reasonable that pirates will
concentrate on taking cargoes (less determined oppostion,
etc. this has been debated and look at the list archive
for discussion).  One has to loose a lot of cargoes to
justify multiple patrol ships at every world that
has traffic in every system.

Well, to.  I _don\'t_ take point that we both know we disagree

and baldly assert them to be true in a reply to posts
on other points.  This isn\'t the same thing as standing up

Well, we both have numerical analysis.  The point as you note,
are his assumptions and mine are different.  I don\'t see
the fact that he dresses them up with calculations, while
I don\'t see the point in calcultion when you can\'t even
agree on the basis numbers for those calculations, as
making them any more valid.  I would suspect that this
has more to do with the fact that you agree with him.

Wrong.  This particular message resulted from Hans jumping
in on a reply that was wrapping up a discussion with someone
other than Hans and bringing up old points.  Now you
have jumped into my reply to Hans.  The only post that
I made in weeks that wasn\'t a reply was one that did
nothing more than disagree with someone that was trying
to claim that there was no disagreement that piracy
was impossible.

>I cannot imagine either one of you being willing to let the other one get

Well, I have posted numerous times how "well I just happen to
not agree with that".  If Hans has simply not jumped in with
new messages and reraising old points this would have stopped
some time back.

Well, yes they have.  I don\'t happen to feel that I have to
either respond to every post or suddently cut off replies
to anyone.  Simply acknowledging that two people have
beaten a topic into the ground and moving on should
be enough.  I wish to be able reply to someone on one
of the few points that have not been beaten to death,
or which has thing that two of use haven\'t resolved, or
simply explainto someone why I have a certain postion
without having to redebate every point on the thread with
Hans.

From the reading I have done, it looks like a strong alpha male will not
get a lot of cheating among most of the pack critters.  If the issue is in
doubt, cheating becomes more likely.

Well, my take is that keeping patrols going in systems with
low traffic and little military importance just isn\'t seen
as being worth the cost.  Obviously this has been debated
based on reasons and assumptions that are too numerous
to go into.

Also, not everyone believes that pirates "lurk".  There is
a school that maintains that they are ships engaged in other
business (legit and illegit) and only take targets
that present themselves, much like how muggers in
the USA work.

Well, one possibility is that piracy doesn\'t occur often enough
for the occaisional lost cargo to cost more than investing
money into weapons.

>   normally steal an entire ship, I am not sure.

If you try and take the whole ship you...
a) Have to take the crew also.  The raises the possibility
that you are going to kill them (rather than just shoot
them if they come into the cargo area when you are taking
the cargo).  They then become motivated to render the
ship unjumpable (so it isn\'t worth taking it and them)
and to fight any boarding action.

b) You have to take the ships in jump capable condition
(no battle damage or crew sabotage).

c) The greater cost and loss of people makes the authorities
more motivated to catch you.

I guess my statement was unclear. I\'ve been misunderstood.

afaik, if you want to connect up Mac\'s *together with* PC\'s, and use
TCP/IP protocol, then you _need_ ethernet. PC\'s don\'t grok appletalk.
That\'s I believe, what Leonard wants to do.

Yes, if you have a purely Mac based network, you can run TCP/IP through
Appletalk.

Actually, the font was designed so that it transliterated english
letters, not Vilani sounds. I\'m working on the Vilani based one now. I\'m

I was inspired by the artist who did the lettering in DGP\'s Starship

Poor Kenji.

I think what he\'s getting at is, we\'ve (well, he\'s done most the work :)
) been working hard coming up with a constructed Vilani language.
(Trekkies have Klingon, after all) We would hate to see it go to waste.

We\'ve been using previously published sound and random generation
charts. To change them would invalidate a lot of the work we\'ve put into
it.

I see no reason to change \'em. If they ain\'t broke, why \'fix\' them?

Just a few weeks ago, Michael Koehne asked that very question. Here\'s
the function I came up with:

Let dX = toX - fromX
    dY = toY - fromY

If |2dY|<=|dX|+1 then D=|dX|

I think we\'re overstating the gneder identifycation of roles just a bit.
An Aslan male would have to know the basics of how to survive in a
technological society (doors and comm switches), plus wahtever incidental
knowledge he picked up along his normal cultural path.

An Aslan "Robinson Crusoe" would either figure out how to fend for himself
*quickly* or die.  Given that the cultural bias runs so deep, I can see
many a shipwrecked Aslan dying due to his lack of practical knowledge.

That\'s how I picture it.  The real headache is in coordinating the exact
jump entry parameters for everything from a 400 ton Gazelle to a 500,000
ton Tigress.  This is also might be why standardized designs are so popular
in the Imperium.. if you are a convoy master, you don\'t have to figure the
differences between 20 different ships, if they are all Mammoth class
haulers..

I\'d take the opposite view. K\'Kree are herd creatures with almost no sense
of privacy.. Odds are mating is done in public, or at least in the clan\'s
area.  Remember the bit in JTAS where a K\'Kree diplomat told a human
reporter he could smell what the human had for dinner, along with who his
bed partner had been?  Maintaining any sort of decorum under those
circumstances would be impossible.

Also, clashes over mates among young males might be a regular part of
society, with the winner taking his new bride right there!  (Imagine RPing
a noble lady of the Imperium, on a trade mission to the Two Thousand Worlds
being invited to her host\'s son\'s "wedding"...)

  No, but if the 3I/IN/INI want to know, they have a good chance

  I assume you\'re referring to the Type TJ. If so, keep in mind 
that this is really a subsidized vessel carrying out business
for the Imperial Household.

  The % cost depends on the size of the ship, OC. I agree that
your view of normal economic activities above makes a good deal
of sense, as it supplies the potential pirate with revenue, cover,
contacts, and a target selection process.

  On the wolf-pack thing - it only takes one ruthless SOB

  The type TI? Sure, but where do your pirates get the cash for a
_2000_ Dt ship? Or have they mutinied, and no-one has processed
the paperwork yet to alert the authorities? The TI is also purpose
built to provide cover to the TJ, so the real role is in question.

  Actually, as you (IIRC) pointed out, and I agreed, SDB\'s are very
unlikely to be present in peacetime except in systems capable of
supporting (and usually, therefore, of building) them. Those systems
are unlikely to have one, as the shipyard cap. to build one implies
the budget to maintain rather more.

  The issue then becomes what are anti-piracy/internal security ships
capable of, and the supply of 300 and 400 Dt ships for that purpose
would indicate that by canon, the vast majority of potential pirates
are inferior to those vessels.

  If the debate is to become one of larger pirate vessels then we
have to clarify where these independent pirates are getting these
ships, and the requisite funding for acquisition or operations.

  Hmm, Oberlindes has an AHL, right?...

One of the two core roles for gdw-beta is beta-testing of actual rules
(to the extent that that\'s not a foriegn concept for IG, of course) and 
suggestions for rules revisions - so in that role, the focus is naturally on
T4. The other core role for the new list is discussing the underlying
technology - How Laser Weapons Work, for example - which is applicable to
all flavours, I would say.

(Though of course the illustrious Mr. Garnett has the last word.)

(An interesting note on variable jump length is that it provides a reason
not to do what Marc called "running" jumps. Since planets, stars, etc., are
all moving, the only reasonable assumption with variable jump duration is
that your jump exit point moves with time at your initial pre-jump
velocity; so if you\'re at rest with respect to your target planet/star,
it doesn\'t matter if you come out a day early or late; but if you\'re
moving at 8 hexes per turn (typical for a 1-G ship doing a running
jump) and you emerge a day early you\'re nearly 400 hexes from your
desitnation - which is a big deal.)

Well, I suppose I should hedge that a bit:  screams of pain aren\'t
_intrinsically_ a bad thing, IME.

There are some odd things about Vilani phonology; not totally out of line
with some real-world languages, but just very unusual.  I think we\'ve come
up with pretty good "explanations" for them.  I\'m content with it as it
stands, I guess.

We even have idioms and a folktale in Vilani!  And tons of sentences
illustrating grammatical constructions, all about Eneri and his eneri and
Sharik and the Seven Shugilii!  Don\'t let this priceless contribution to
Travellerdom go to waste!

26 symbols?  That feels to me too close to the 26 letters familiar to
every English speaker.  Shouldn\'t we have 30 or 22 or something?

	Well, actually, the old system WASN\'T a fixed 0.1ls-0.2ls-0.4ls-0.8ls.
Under BL/BR/FF&S it _wasn\'t_ always 1-2-4-8 hexes--it depended on the
weapon itself. Different weapons had different ranges. For example, some
weapons had short ranges of 10 hexes, which meant the progression went
10-20-40-80. Basically, when you designed a weapon using FF&S (original),
the short range of the weapon was one of the results. Medium was then 2x,
Long was 4x, and Extreme was 8x.

	For T4, we were told that the range bands would be fixed instead of weapon
dependent (which I didn\'t like, but ...). Since QSDS/SSDS were supposed to
be derived from FF&S, we chose 10-20-40-80. Hence the 1ls-2ls-4ls-8ls ...

	To summarize: FF&S/BL/BR did NOT have fixed range bands at
1hex-2hex-4-hex-8 hex. In fact, those were pretty weak, short-ranged
weapons. Instead, the range bands depended on the weapon\'s characteristics.

	SSDS/QSDS weapons were rated using the maximum range bands for FF&S
weapons: 10-20-40-80.

While that\'s theoretically true from a governmental sense (in that no clan
governs any other clan), it\'s not true in a practical, social sense.  
\'Fteirle\' (the word the Aslan use to name themselves) refers to the social
system, not the biology.  I believe one of the Alien supplements established 
that there was a lengthy conclave on what exactly it meant to be \'Fteirle\',
and clans started grabbing the territory of heretical opponents before the
results were even formally published.

The net result being that clans which do not cleave fairly closely to the
accepted definition of \'Fteirle\' are considered (at least by the Fteirle) as 
being outcast and non-persons.  Non-persons, of course, have no right to hold 
land that could be petter put to use by convenient ihaeti, so ihaeti fleets 
get fitted out to take that land away (by use of force).

That\'s a possibility, and it means (that like personal agressiveness,
leadership challenges, and reproductive drive) is probably governed by the
turn of the seasons (length of day, temperature, and similar factors).  A
cagey captain mught be able to manipulate this effect in an artificial
environment like a ship.

>Man o man, I wonder what the life of an omega Vargr is like...

Well, assuming that Vargr social structures are similar to dogs or wolves
(which makes a certain amount of sense) there wouldn\'t be very many perks (or 
reproductive opportunities), plus a very submissive attitude would be
required and enforced.  While the omega would probably take the brunt of the 
blame and punishment for any problems, it\'s also the case that the omega is 
the (only!) one who initiates play.

KIBO!!!!   :-)

I _knew_ this \'Kenji Schwartz\' was a pseudonym (obviously a bogus
name, but who)?   I was having a devil of a time figuring out, but
the weirdness of your ideas had a familiar ring.

The fonts were a dead giveaway ... of course!

Evangeline is a character in a comic of the same name (from Comico).
She\'s a nun in a future with space travel and star travel (her first
adventure was on Mars, a latter one was on a interstellar colony
world). She\'s also an assassin for the Church. A very *good* assassin.

I made a slightly different assumption.  In Terran predators (particularly
tigers and lions), the male "owns" the land that the females live on.  If a
new male takes over the territory, one of the first things he does is kill
all of the cubs (because they\'re not his).

For Aslan males, I assumed that the territorial drive was paramount.  Aslan 
males want to own and hold territory, especially desirable territory; if they 
do this, then mating opportunities (with the females that live on that
territory) and children that live to adulthood (under his protection) will 
result.  In pre-civilized times, an Aslan male who does not hold the territory 
that his female(s) live on will not have children who live to adulthood, even 
if he manages to mate.

Because of the 3:1 abundance of females to males, I see the females competing
for the male\'s attentions, and particularly for his commitment to helping
her defend and raise the children.  A relatively high sex drive (and possibly 
a tendancy towards jealousy) might well help in this.

In various Canon sources, it is mentioned that Aslan females who want to
marry frequently strive to do well in business, to demonstrate that they
will be good wives and managers of the family\'s business affairs.  In my
interpretation, this is one way in which civilized Aslan females compete
with one another for a male\'s attention.

Because of the 3:1 ratio, Aslan society promotes monagamy as a way of
keeping the birth rate under control.  As was pointed out earlier, one
male _could_ very well service an average of 3 females (and quite possibly
did in prehistoric times) , but this would make the population growth rate 
excessive once the mortality rate started to drop.  

>Among primates, females "cheating" on the dominate male behind his back

I believe that it happens more often with some species than with others.
For the case of the Aslan, I assumed that it happened less often than
it does with Terran primates.

Could be, but I assumed not.  If I recall correctly, eivronmental cues
like the length of the day and the average temperaturs trigger changes in
hormone levels that cause increased agressiveness, competition, and
sexual desire in males, and trigger ovulation and sexual desire in females.
The Ancients could simply have used these environmental factors as an aid
in breeding the Vargr.

>would have been lost in evolution on Lair.

I doubt that there\'s been sufficient time since the time of the Ancients
for significant amounts of evolution to occur.

Obviously not, since Chripers are uncasted (and therefore have only the
basic males and females) and can still reproduce.  Uncasted chirpers
born of chirper parents can still be casted, if coyns are re-introduced.

>Nor do I think the Grandfather prescribed the cermony where the

The Droyne item was tongue-in-cheek, but for what it\'s worth, I believe
that it was mentioned that each of the castes has a role in the
reproductive process.

Well, yes.

There are many species that approximate this, and the males don\'t seem
to be particularly insane.  I assumed that, although the male would be
always ready, his sex drive varies, so that he\'s not so frustrated when
it\'s not mating season.

Of course, Vargr being the way that they are, some cultures probably use
drugs or other mechanisms to induce (or inhibit) mating seasons
periodically.  Others counsider that illegal and immoral.  And everything
in between.

The mean distance between the Earth and the Moon is 384,000 km. So that
should give a useful "scaling factor".

And I find the FF&S ranges rather short.

Yep.  As I think Glenn Hoppe has since posted, the current issue of
"Bilanidin Bold" is the alphabet used by the Vilani to write/transcribe
Galanglic in -- not their own language.  The latter is under construction,
IUUC, and will have 20 letters, 5 or 6 tone diacritics, and 10 numeral
characters, plus maybe punctuation.  IIUC -- am I right, O Designer?  And
did we go with an upper case set as well?

Even this is contemplated to be a simplified, Galanglic-influenced
alphabet; the "real" Vilani script, we\'re thinking, works something like
Korean Han\'gul: alphabetic elements combined into syllabic graphic blocks.

It\'s "irrational", but it\'s also not an "algebraic"(?) number. That is,
there\'s no function or equation that\'ll produce it.

Well, as I said in another post, it\'d be equally "possible" to build a

As I said, you can\'t *do* that. It\'d be like creating a universe where
1+1=3. In fact, they are both impossible for the *same* reasons. You
can\'t build a consistent mathematics with either.

Which are, basically, the big Imp has lots \'o money, lots \'o manpower,
lots \'o warships, and thinks that even the citizens of the smallest
systems deserve protection, even if it is not coldly cost-effective.

And another school that says that this is not quite possible (and it\'s a
false analogy to compare ships to muggers). It maintains that to do
"other business" would put the would-be blackbeard in a position where
he would never get a target of opportunity.

*  *  *

No school is "right" in any of these matters, because no school can
prove anything. These arguments are all based on assumptions. Basically,
there are good reasons (and not-so-good reasons) on both sides of the
argument, and the piracy thread has unearthed them. Choose what you
like, and go with it. :-)

You can even have it both ways, since there is this neat thing called
time. You can have a period in history where piracy has been completely
stomped out, and you can have a period in which it is rife. There are
historical precedents for both, IIRC. A strong, stable, benevolent
Imperium (or Regency) is good for the former, and a Shattered Imperium
(or Virus-infected Imperium, or emerging-from-the-Long-Night-Imperium)
is good for the latter.

I\'m a film-lover, and I thought the English Patient stunk.

But, that\'s what I like about the movies--it\'s so subjective.  One man\'s crap

This brings up a question I have about the whole "running" jump idea.

          HOW TO SURVIVE YOUR STINT IN FEDERAL SERVICE

Twenty useful tips brought to you by Gen. Paul Verhoven, C in C...

20. The enemy can drop driveless asteroids on your cities from over 1000
light years distance - presumably at FTL speeds - without resorting to any
visible technology. Therefore, assume they\'re just stupid Bugs incapable of
rational thought;

19. When piloting the ship, don\'t strap yourself in. When the ship is hit,
you\'ll look cool flying through the air into the viewport;

18. Artillery? Only wussies need artillery.

17. Ignore those plasma bolts the mindless Bugs are firing at your ship -
they\'re just "random light";

16. Be ready to shoot your buddies at a moments notice; they\'ll thank you
for it;

15. Rest assured that, in the future, even the chicks are pumped on
testosterone;

14. Remember: football is actually vital combat training;

13. Make the escape pods really hard to get to. It adds dramatic tension
when you have to run an obstacle course to reach them;

12. Join the Psychic Friends Network and learn to mind-meld with a
mongoose. It just might come in handy;

11. Watch out for those asteroids - their gravity is such that they\'ll drag
your coffee out of its cup at a thousand clicks. (Must be made of
neutronium!);

10. Never miss an opportunity to show off your breasts;

9. Power armor? Who needs power armor? (The Feds decided to spend the money
on computer animated Bug simulations or something. Sorry...);

8. Before your mission starts, suck your brain out with a straw. You\'ll
save the Bugs the trouble, and you\'ll be able to sit back and enjoy the
ride; 

7. Embrace Fascism. The uniforms look cool;

6. Let the new recruit pilot the ship out of the space dock, even though
it\'s her first time at the controls. Computer guidance is for wussies.
(Besides, that\'s the way it\'s done at Star Fleet, so it must be right);

5. Never do anything original. Only do things heroes of sci-fi action
movies have done before;

4. Air support? Only wussies need air support;

3. Leave your copy of Heinlein\'s book at home. It won\'t help you here;

2. Always fly your ships in very tight battle formation, no more than 20m
apart. It looks cool and you\'ll get lots of chances to test your piloting
skills;

1. Look cute in a uniform.

Just follow these simple instructions and you\'ll survive your term in
Federal Service. Then you\'ll qualify to be a Citizen. You\'ll have the right
to vote, and a license to have children! Yes, it\'s a glorious world here in
the future, where all the decisions - and all the babies - are made
exclusively by steroid-pumped multiple amputees suffering from Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder and likely to go postal at the sight of
cockroaches!

C\'mon everybody, sing the Anthem...."Wooo-hooo!"

True but there does need to be some way to ensure that the next
generation of Aslan comes from somewhere.  "If your parents did not have

_Why_ did you make the assumption that all Aslan females have a sex
drive ?

It is a reasonable assumption but it would be just as easy to assume
that the female Aslan sex drive only kicks in when they pick up
phermones from an Aslan male they are pair bonded to.  Thus all the
unatttached females would not be thinking about sex at all.  This would
leave them more time to get work done.  Therefore the extra females
would add more to the productivity of the group.  This might help to
explain why there are more Aslan females than males in the first place.

For there to be more Aslan females than males this has to be (or at
least have been) evolutionarily adventageous at some point.  Perhaps
proto aslan with a more equal number of males experienced too much
infighting and were inefficient.  Perhaps the female Aslan died off at
higher rates so more needed to be born in the first place.  For example
the female Aslan birth canal might be be insufficiently evolved to cope
with the larger brain (and therefore head size) that has developed. 
Therefore the Aslan might have had an exceedingly high rate of mortality
during childbirth.

It is also possible to believe that Aslan females do not have much, or
any, sex drive at all and that they engage in sex only when they are
physically forced or when otherwise coerced to do so.

Just because _an_ explanation makes sense does not mean that there are
not other plausible explanations.

Well, they are aliens so you can justify almost anything.  OTOH,
I just wanted to point out that a lot of these things don\'t
necessarily follow from how the Vargr were set up (and I would
suggest that just dumping things on them because they seem
cute is the sort of common mistake that makes aliens seem
hokey).  I also wanted to point out they are not "dogs" anymore
than we are "chimps".

I think that it is a bit short even for rough guesses.  I would
go a step further or not use it at all.

I would say that one should look at how humans have come from chimp
behavior and make Aslan and Vargr an equal distance from canines
or the species that Aslan evolved from.  You need to
look at he change as much as where you are starting from.
For example, just saying humans will act like chimps will be
as wrong as it is right.  All these species
have travelled a long journey since their animal ancestors

Well, this gets back to assumptions about how extensive
the documentation on each ship is, whether it get
distributed so it is at each system when it gets there,
whether it includes thing like upgrades, etc.  I
am one of those who don\'t feel that simply assuming,
given the slow communications, that all sites will
have any records they might want is a mistake.

Yeah, but just uping a computer is only a fraction of
what those ships do.

Yeah, this is classic of all crimes that involve cooperation.
What happens is that it does happen enough to catch the
criminal sometimes, but not enough to make the crime
seem impractical to all who might plan it.

Yeah, but if even a 2000 ton ship can be described as ships that
are marginal enough that they are intended to operate off of the
main trade routes, there are certainly ships that can worry
a measly 200 ton system defense boat.  (or even the bigger
400 ton one).

Well, I would say the 400 ton SDB (which costs 3/4 what the
Kuninuir that Hans was using and I felt was appropriate)
is the bare minimum.  It is as small, or smaller, than
almost all merchant vessels and what it gains in
being a military ship is lost in the fact that it
has to be clearly superior to the biggest ship the
pirate use (in a situation where the pirate chooses the
tatical sitation).

In MT the rules give a big penalty for jumping out within 10 diameters
but do not increase this penalty for lesser distances.  So if you are
going to jump within 10 diameters [Formidable, Engineer, Navigators Edu
(hazardous, fateful)] you might as well jump out at 1 diameter, or 0.1
diameter, or from within the high port.... It won\'t be any more

Yes but the ship would still be within 1,000 diameters of the star
(unless the planet in question was in an outer orbit) therefore no
benefit would accrue.

A few factoids culled from Henbest & Couper\'s _A Guide to the Galaxy_:

A pulsar\'s magnetic field is about a million-million times as strong as
Earth\'s. The field dies out after about 10 million years. Young pulsars
rotate at rates up to 1000 times per second, but their magnetic fields
eventually slow them down. There are probably about 500,000 pulsars in the
Galaxy, and about 1000 \'dead\' pulsars (undetectable from Earth).

Vague answers, but that\'s all I know :)

	We\'re pretty darn close to primates.  I remember reading in
_Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors_ (St. Carl doing human evolution) this long
list of behavious that humans and chimps shared in common...  in fact,
Sagan seemed to imply (in stating that the only real difference was that
chimps don\'t have abstract codes of behavioural norms) that lawyers were
the driving force behind human evolution taking the course it has :).

	Ok.  So it was a real stretch.  So sue me :).

	But seriously, there are some pretty chimp-like human societies out
there, as Carl pointed out; motorcycle gangs spring to mind.  I could see
Vargr "packs".  OTOH, your point about genetic manipulation by Grandfather
could very well hold.  In fact, it makes a lot of sense.  I don\'t think
I\'ll decide one way or the other without reference to canon.

I believe he\'s a font designer in his day job.

I just looked thks up in my Physics Book. I hope I=B4ll bore no one with=20
it now, so only read on, if you=B4re really interested.
The Formula for the zentrifugal force is

 F =3D m * v^2 / r =3D m * omega^2 * r,

so the acceleration has to be

 a =3D v^2 / r =3D omega^2 * r =3D g =3D 9.81 m/s^2,=20

omega being the angular velocity in radians.
Given the radius of 800 m, we=B4ll get:

 omega =3D sqrt(g / r) =3D sqrt(9,81 m/s^2 / 800 m) =3D 0,1107 s^-1
     v =3D sqrt(g * r) =3D 88,6 m/s

This would be a time for one turn of T =3D 2 * pi / omega =3D 56,7 s.
i.e. this station will have to turn circa once a minute around itself to=20
have an artificial gravity of 1 g. Make it bigger, and it needs not to=20
turn as fast. I hope, I did no mistakes in this calculation.
Now we see, why it is better to dock on the axis ...

Additional Comments: Walking on such a station can become quite=20
interesting, as there exist coriolis effects because of the spin. i.e.=20
anything falling from inside to outside of the station, like a drink=20
poured into a glass will be diverted to trailing. anything that goes up=20
will be forced spinward. And if you=B4re running around the ring, you=B4ll=
=20
get either more weight or less as you are changing your angular velocity.
They never induced that on Babylon 5.

Yup. I\'m not doing an upper case set. The Roman & Cyrillic alphabets are
rare in that they have upper and lower cases. I see no need for two
cases.

I\'d rather devote that energy to creating different typeface "styles". I
envision an even "bolder" display face, a script-like "hand drawn"
style...

That\'s the way I envisioned it.

A have a comment from the peanut gallery.

I\'ve noticed a tendency towards faulty analogy. Piracy cannot be
compared to street crime, transit crime, or mugging. I assume the
average Imperial citizen\'s purchasing power is the same order of
magnitude as the average citizen in today\'s industrialized countries.
(This can be inferred from the chargen charts)

The average merchant vessel is valued in the tens of *Mega*Credits.
That\'s a bucketload of cash for most citizens. If even _one_ of these
things is stolen, it *is* a big deal. It\'s a major bank heist. The local
authorities (representing the Imperium) *will* take notice. It\'s not a
mugging, or a transit crime.

If pirates instead choose to steal cargo (assuming they are able to
disable a vessel very quickly and transfer the cargo -- a very shaky
assumption, imho) then there is the problem of "fencing" the cargo.
Unlike a regular mugging, these aren\'t liquid assets like cash or credit
cards. This is a lot of information, raw material, finished goods,
chemicals, live animals... unless the pirate knows *before hand* (how?)
what the cargo is, he could be in possession of 20 tons of Antarean
Mountain Groats.

And the cargo will likely have some sort of way of being traced. Source
information encrypted in the cargo containers, embedded microchips, etc.
Reputable industry and business, the type that would buy most cargoes in
bulk, would not likely buy cargo which is of questionable lineage.

So again, I reach the conlusion that piracy is possible to occur once in
a while (it\'s too profitable not to), but Imperial Authorities will be
vigilant. There is too much risk for lone individuals, so the successful
pirate will have a well laid out plan, information covertly supplied,
and most importantly, the backing of a government or large corporation.

    'month' => '11',

    'body' => 'OPERATION: RISEK  -- A Scenario for BATTLE RIDER

In the year 1104 imperial, tensions were running high between the Third
Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate in the region near Deneb.  Both 
governments were busily readying their forces in case war were to 
break out.  To this end, a series of naval exercises were performed
by the Imperial and regional navies in preparation for conflict.

One such exercise was performed in the Risek system.  About the size
of the moon Titan in the Sol system, Risek is home to only about forty
thousand inhabitants, a small but capable refitting yard, and a naval
base.  Risek was chosen as a site for this exercise for a number of
reasons, not least of which was its proximity to the IN Fleet Tactics
School (Deneb) then located in the Macene Belt.

Red Fleet was ordered to execute a jump from the marshaling point in
the Porozlo system and to conduct a simulated invasion of Risek.  In
the meantime, Blue Fleet had left Macene and taken up positions in the
Risek system to repel the attack.  The initial scenario called for Red
Fleet to secure the system, but did not include landing operations.

- ----

VICTORY:  The game concludes after all Red ships have exited from jump
          and one side has gained complete control of the board (all 
          enemy ships destroyed, disabled, or escaped).

SET-UP:   This scenario covers the entire area within 100 diameters of
          Risek.  This will require six BRILLIANT LANCES hex sheets, 
          if available.  They should be laid out in a square, so that
          the board is about 36 hexes wide and 33 across. 
          
          |----|----|----|  A planet counter is placed as near to the 
          |   |   |   |  center of the board as possible; this is
          |   |   |   |  Risek.  Any ship in the same hex as Risek
          |----|-*-|----|  or adjacent to it is within the ten diameter
          |   |   |   |  limit; any ship within 16 hexes of Risek is
          |   |   |   |  within the one hundred diameter limit.
          |----|----|----|
          
Red Fleet has 750 points to spend as specified in the Advanced Scenario
generation section of the rules.  All Red Fleet ships must be jump-3 at
least, or be a battle rider carried by a tender with a jump-3+ drive.  

All Red Fleet ships (or tenders carrying battle riders) must plot a jump
exit point.  Each ship selects a hex sixteen or more hexes from Risek;
more than one ship may select the same hex.  Each ship selects a initial
vector not greater than its\' maneuver drive value, in any direction.
Each ship also selects a turn on which the "jump exit window" opens.  
Roll 4D6-4 for each ship.  This is the actual turn after the window is
open that the ship appears in the selected hex on the map.  At least one
"jump exit window" must be plotted to open on the first turn.

Red Fleet ships which exit jump and find each other in the same hex with
the same vector may form task forces subject to the usual restrictions.
Ships exit jump at the beginning of the Initiative Phase.  Riders may be
launched in the same Initiative Phase as jump exit occurs.

Blue Fleet has 375 points to spend.  Blue Fleet ships do not need jump
drives.  The Blue player may place ships anywhere on the board once Red
Fleet has plotted the jump exit points for all vessels.  Red should not
reveal the jump exit point(s) plotted for ships in Red Fleet until the
turn on which they exit jump.

VARIANT ONE

The jump exit rules are designed to give a ten hour jump exit window
for the invading ships, as currently proposed.   The chances are good 
that ships will exit during the middle five hours of that window.  

This can be altered to test alternative rules.  For a tighter exit
window of five hours, use 2D-2 instead of 4D-4.  You can also try the
civilian jump exit window of twenty hours by using 2x(4D-4).

It\'s very likely that point values for each side will have to be 
adjusted depending on which version of this variant you use.

VARIANT TWO

Blue Fleet may, at its discretion, purchase a small deep-site meson gun
for use as a planetary defense weapon.  It has the following approximate
statistics:

M(-2)6:10-7-4-2           -4
 --                     TL12
 --                    FC:-4
 --                      --
A:16 P:8 J:16 Msk        --
AV:30 AuxB               --
MS:14                    185

The meson gun is buried permanently two kilometers underground on Risek.
It gets a DiffMod of +4 applied to sensor tasks against it (+2 for being
landed, and +2 for being buried).  Alternatively, Blue Fleet might be 
allowed to buy a smaller meson gun of size -3 at half the point cost but
with half the short range.  [Note that both alternatives are accurately
designed.]  It must also be suppressed for Red Fleet to declare victory.
All reasonable rules apply (for instance, Powering Down).

COMMENTARY

This scenario is designed to test the feasibility of a direct attack
after jump exit by an invading fleet.  Risek\'s small size (size-3)
allows the entire region inside the 100-diameter boundary to fit in
a reasonable amount of space.

If Variant Two is in use, the Blue player isn\'t required to buy the 
weapon -- it might be useful to use a decoy task force to force Red
Fleet to worry about whether or not a deep-site is really there.

I\'ve given the invading fleet a 2:1 point advantage over the defense.
This should be adjusted as necessary as players discover the optimal 
strategies for this scenario.

    'body' => 'One of the great undersolved problems of Traveller space combat is 
how well a starship can evade; that is, what volume of space it can 
cover in the time between observation by the firing ship and the 
arrival of a laser pulse.  IMHO, obviously.

Let us assume a ship with maximum acceleration A, and thrusters 
capable of delivering either a lateral acceleration a or an angular 
acceleration C.  The frame of reference is w.r.t. the ship\'s vector 
at the moment of detection, so zero acceleration represents the ship 
remaining where it is.  The assumption is that a relatively dumb fire 
control computer can hit a constant-v target.  We will also assume 
non-relativistic ship velocities.

The easy problem to solve (read: problem with an 
analytical solution) is for the ship under forward and lateral 
acceleration.  Max. distance travelled under forward acceleration A 
is 1/2 At^2, where t = 2 * lag-time + reaction time, lag-time is the
distance to target in light-seconds and reaction time is the time to
compute firing solution, train and fire.  Reaction time is probably 
negligible if you continually refine your firing solution based on 
constant sensor readings, so we\'ll assume t = 2 * lag-time.  Max 
distance under lateral acceleration is 1/2 at^2.  Since the two 
thrusts are independent, the locus of possible ship positions is a 
cylinder, length 1/2 At^2, radius 1/2 at^2.  The ship is contained in 
a volume pi r^2 l = 1/8 pi A a^2 t^6.  A random cross-section through 
this will have an area of roughly 1/16 pi (a + A) a t^4 

Assuming the laser beam to be negligibly wide itself, it can be
thought of as having an effective beam cross-section of the target
ship\'s profile i.e. if the thin beam intersects the ship, the laser
hits.  Since the laser beam moves at c, it is much faster than the
ship and it is assumed to pass through the volume of possible ship
positions instantaneously. Assuming a spherical ship, diameter d,
cross-section area is pi d^2.  Thus, chance of hitting the ship is:

pi d^2 / 1/16 pi (a + A) a t^4

= 16 d^2 / a (a + A) t^4

This is based on the ship having an equal chance of being in any 
region of the cylinder.  Bearing in mind that starship captains will 
wish to "push the envelope" a bit (use as much acceleration as 
possible) but have more chance of being towards the interior of the 
cylinder if they choose accelerations at random, this is a fair 
assumption.

Now, consider how starship evasion has to work.  Let us assume that 
the distance between the ships is known, to reasonable accuracy, by 
both sides.  The target ship therefore knows the lag time, but 
doesn\'t know when the enemy ship will fire.  Its maneuver will 
therefore be somewhat less efficient, since each evasion pattern can 
take it back into the volume of the previous one, where a shot could 
well be fired.  Let\'s say that the effective time of maneuver is 
equal to half the lag time, or the range in light seconds.

p(hit) = 16 d^2 / a (a + A) t^4 where t = range in light seconds

= 4 for a 10m sphere at 1g lateral, 4g forward, 1 ls distant.

p > 1 implies a certain hit, and p>>1 implies it\'s possible to pick 
hit locations.  This, however, assumes a 100% accurate sensor fix and 
a 100% accurate laser system.  I\'d guess laser accuracy decays as 
1/r^2 (laser can be aimed to a certain angular precision, i.e. beam 
fired within a very small solid angle, possible area in which beam is 
found is proportional to r^2) but I don\'t have good intuition as to 
the constant of proportionality -- how well *can* you point a laser?
Equally, how accurate a fix can sensors get as a function of 
distance?

Can some kind and/or knowledgeable soul give me some ideas on these 
numbers?  (And if you can, will you?  Please?)

The practical upshot of all of this is that a ship unmissable at 1 ls 
can be very hard to hit at 2 ls and virtually impossible at 4 ls.  
Score one for 0.1 ls BL/BR hexes...

The *hard* problem to solve, that of the ship turning and using its 
main drive to alter course, can\'t be solved so neatly.  (A solution 
involves Fresnel integrals, about which I have no data.)  I think the 
solution has the same dimensions as above (it ought to!) but I don\'t 
know the constants involved.  Small ships (fighter-sized) can have 
enormous angular accelerations (like 10+ rad/s^2) when G-compensated, 
so it might be important for the survivability of fighters in 
combat.

My guess is volume swept = K A^3 C^2 t^4 where K is a constant, C the 
angular acceleration and A the (forward) linear acceleration.  Which 
makes an SDB *way* harder to hit than a merchant ship. (ObPiracy.)

Wrong.  The pulsar noises come from the rotating magnetic field.  Most of
the radiation associated with the nebula is secondary radiation (usually
sycrotron) driven by the rotation of the fields inside.  This sycrotron
does fall off as the nebula\'s density decreases.

The magnetic fields of neutron stars vary from 10^11 Gauss to 10^13 Gauss.
There has been reported a field strength of 10^14 Gauss reported in the
literature, but the confidence level is low.  The field will fall off at
1/r^2.  Picture a huge version of the field from a bar magnet.

The radius of neutron stars could be from 5 to 15 km depending upon the
characteristics of matter at high densities ( >10^14 g/cc ).

The spin down rate would eventually give you the conditions that you
orignialy suggested, the field no longer rotating, but the time required
to bring this rate down has been esitmated to be over 10^10 years.

Two reasons: 1) this is a public exchange - if you had wanted it to be an
exchange only between Hans and yourself, then you would have done it
privately, and 2) your posts are getting a definite martyr air, which I
attempt to stamp out whenever and wherever I find it in public forums.  It
damages rational argument.

Most people have lousy models of anyone they do not live near.

Frankly, I would be surprised if the typical human who did not have a large
Vargr population on their home world had even the faintest idea how their
society ran.  Using the typical wolf pack as the model for the average
person\'s perception of Vargr behavior seems quite reasonable.

At the very least, present day average people have virtually no
understanding of other cultures.  Every exchange student I have talked with
seemed to indicate this from personal experience, and these were people who
were well prepped, and going to places with the same species.  I
experienced it going to Scotland, and there are few cultures on Earth
outside the US closer to Irvine than the UK.

In that sense, Pi is also no algebraic - you can only define it with infinite

Actually, if you work the scale from the bottom (the individual citizen) to the
top (megacorporations with annual budgets greater than most world\'s GWP), and
put in in the perspective of the Imperium (Impersonal bureacracy spanning
thousands of worlds, etc...), the piracy of a 1,000- dTon ship looks more like a
carjacking.  It\'s enough to get the local \'police\' (Planetary or Cluster forces)
involved, and if it happens enough, to bring in the \'state\' cops (i.e. SubSector
fleet attention), but Imperial Forces?  Not likely, if it is happening at a
Class D or E world (which by definition would have very little clout, or it
would have a better starport, no?)

As a caveat, however, once you start hitting the 1,000+ dTon ships (and some
selected smaller ships...), you are hitting megacorp ships...they are mobile
patches of political clout that can call in the big guns.  You don\'t want to
annoy someone who has lunch with the Arch Duke!  :)  That is, of course,
assuming they do not decide to resolve the issue without Imperial intervention!

If you assign any kind of intelligence to a pirate, they will either know
roughly what you are carrying, or you had the bad luck to be a target of
opportunity.  Brokers and Traders advertise what they have, it\'s the only way to
make cargo move (unless, of course, it is the \'small package\' trade, but that
has it\'s own risks, including cargo-jacking).  Ships advertise their
destinations and approximate schedules, it\'s the only way to get passengers.
Manifests are recorded at the starport.  It\'s all information that is available,
if you have the capability to access it.

Security devised by men, will be broken by men.  Records can be forged.
Electronic tags can be altered.  Shipments can be broken up and repackaged in
new containers.  Admittably, new and intriguing security devices can and will be
introduced, but they are exceptions, not the rule.

The Imperial Authorities have far too much to do, to be concerned with
_unorganized_ piracy, especially small ship conflicts.  As with most crime, you
concentrate on the major offenders, and hope that the patrol cops catch the
rest.  Once a pattern has been established, I\'m sure that there are specific
units or investigation teams that may form to track down an individual - but
that individual will have to make quite the splash before that happens!

Actually, in keeping with the theme of the thread (making piracy possible for
the GM) - how does the idea of a Piracy Investigative Arm sound?  These are the
sophonts who reconstruct the event, trace the ships and cargos taken, and
eventually identify the perp?

Well, remember that Aslan are the product of evolution just like humans.
We went from a male dominating a group of females to a setup where each
mates with whomever they can attract.  Since the Aslan have a formal
marraige type system, they have abandoned the ideat that males get
any woman who wanders (or can be herded or lured) into their territory.
So getting a territory that is attractive (though now it can comprise
more abstract aspects, like mineral rights, having profitable enterpirses
on it, etc.) to females is still a factor (just as being big, strong, and
dominant is still a factor in humans), but just like humans they also
have other factors that have evolved and they also have cultural
influences.

Well, human women compete for the attention of males too and are looking
for the same sort of commitment and, like human women, they have
an interest (evolutionarily) in securing the best male they can get
with as much commitment as they can, rather than seeing how many males
they can mate with.

I agree.

Well, Aslan are aleardy in canon as having multiple wives all of which
can bear children just as well from their husband as anyone else.
So that wouldn\'t cut down the birth rate.  Forcing women to go
unmarried and celebate could work, though humans can do this to
(they just have to do it to equal numbers of men and women)
and Aslan would also have incentive to use other means
as humans (unless you wanted to suppose that they enjoy sex
less than humans, which seems unlikely).

I can see that, if indeed they come from
a species where women only mated with males who controlled the
territory they are in, then casual sex might be less of a driving
force.  But the would cut both ways.  Females wouldn\'t tend to sleep
with a male until she had moved in with him, and males would put
getting the woman to move in ahead of sleeping with her.  It would,
in my mind, mean that Alsan have a different attitude toward
"premarital" sex than humans, but I don\'t see it as making
a big difference in sex drive.

There was for humans.  We are not the same species that was taken and
that is why you have things like Zhodane having different numbers of
teeth.

If females were only receptive a few times a year, then males would
have evolved to be used to it.  The common mechanism is that a male
sex drive doesn\'t kick in until he senses the female is potentially
receptive.

Hello,
  Even if the cargo is all you get, just cream off the best as you can,
and go to some backwater without real controls, and sell at a moderate
discount (20-50%). Your profit margin is still _real_ good.

  This is probably only an issue if the cargo is examined by the authorities,
in which case you may as well have a final shoot-out. Unless it\'s one of
Douglas\' boarding parties, in which case it\'s recommended you go peacefully :)

Well, of course this is something that is hard to pin down.  Do
they go in gangs because of pirmate genetics?  Or because a group
of people can get what they want from individuals?  I guess
I\'m mostly saying is that it should be treated evenhandedly.
One shouldn\'t look at a human group and say they formed because
they decided to and look at a Vargr group and say they are a
"pack" because they are evolved from "dogs".  If everyone
in the Imperium, except Vargr, keep noticing they act like
wolves, then everyone, except humans, should keep noting
they act like chimps.  (And for every "Vargr/dog" joke
that a human makes another race should be making a
"human/chimp" joke.)

>  I could see

It would be better to say that, like all being evolved from
social animals, they tend to look to form groups to solve
problems and prefer interacting with others.

Well, I think the fault is that piracy _is_ just another crime
that is, wrongly, being singled out for elimination.  The fact
is that there are things that hold true for criminal activity
from organized crime down to street crime and for muggers
trying to get someone one the street back in time to highway
robbery.

Well, it is not clear that piracy takes ships or cargo (and that
has been debated already).  In any case, the costs are not
bourne by average joes, but either by corps, the banks who
the owner will default to, or insurance.  They will be real
keen in weighing taxes versus losses.  To  the average
person in the Imperium I doubt piracy will be the crime
that bother them the most and to a corp it will be one
of a number of sources of losses.

>It\'s a major bank heist. The local
>authorities (representing the Imperium) *will* take notice. It\'s not a
>mugging, or a transit crime.

Well, we don\'t take 1% of our military budget and divert
it to eliminating bank robbery either.  At that rate
you could have a guy behind a bullet proof shield ready
to shoot any bank robber.

>If pirates instead choose to steal cargo (assuming they are able to

Well, it is no more difficult than fencing today or that smugglers,
etc. will have to do.  (In fact, that is why smugglers are good
to engage in piracy, they already have contacts to fence goods
and they already have a reason to arm their ships to stop rival
smugglers from taking their stuff).

>And the cargo will likely have some sort of way of being traced. Source
>information encrypted in the cargo containers, embedded microchips, etc.

This falls under the heading of things you can assume if you
want to make piracy harder.  Even if you want to assume it,
you still have the fact that work around will exist and smuggling
is also canon.

Y\'know, I\'ve had so many people misplay Aslan males that I _have_
to answer this seriously:

Yes, they would.  They\'re not stupid; they are simply not
technologically inclined.  They are _capable_ of learning how to
use technology, and will willingly do so where it is both
culturally acceptable and a proven necessity for their interests
(there probably isn\'t an Aslan male aboard ship that can\'t fire,
field-strip, and maintain his gauss rifle or FGMP, for example),
but if it\'s not something that interests them, they are simply
unwilling to invest the time and effort needed to learn.

In the rare event that it is absolutely necessary for an Aslan to
learn a culturally inappropriate skill (such as if the Aslan is
an Outcast), they will learn the skill - it is ultimately a
matter of life and death - but they will never publicly admit to
knowing the skill.

Quite likely - among other things, he\'s been sitting on a
goldmine of Traveller stuff that DGP wrote, and hasn\'t
re-released it or arranged for someone else to do so.

Although I would tend to characterize this as an error of
omission rather than commission.

His last message on the state of the negotiations to get this
stuff re-released, and some of the unfinished Traveller products
(the MegaTraveller Alien series, and the Black Duke sourcebook
immediately come to mind) implied that IG was the bottleneck; I
took it at face value at the time; given that they have since
arranged a license for SJG, and given the liberal non-profit
license arrangements that make so many of our web sites possible
(and for which Freelance Traveller is officially and thoroughly
thankful), I now think that Roger is much like certain
acquaintances of mine - lots of very good ideas; little
follow-through.

A similar situation obtains with respect to AI and Macrocosm, two
non-Traveller-related products for which he also painted glowing
pictures, but which, to this day, are still as much vaporware as
Windows for Toaster-ovens.

=46WIW, there was a strictly non-canonical (but very plausible)
document that circulated here a while back that described the
"mechanical issues" of sex among Vargr and Aslan.  I have the
text, and will send it, _private_mail_only_, to interested
parties.  I would very much like to see someone work up a similar
document on the "social issues" of sex among the major races,

True, but then they are not "prostitutes" by definition;
prostitution implies the selling of sexual activity as the
objective, rather than as a vehicle for therapy.  Fine line,
perhaps, but a very real one...

The 26 symbols stems from the fontmaker mapping symbols to the 26 letters of

Actually, the Vilani word generator (MT Referee\'s Companion) has 17 distinct

positional (that is to say, Sh at the beginning of a syllable could be a
different symbol than Sh at the end of a syllable). And some of the symbols

You\'ve missed my point.

The "bottom" of the scale is relatively equivalent to todays "bottom".
The analogy doesn\'t hold. The top could be infinite and it wouldn\'t
matter. To use an example, just because Bill Gates is worth tens of
billions doesn\'t mean he won\'t notice it if someone walks in and steals
the 10 million dollar Leonardo da Vinci notebooks.

In the same vein, the Imperium *because* it is a bureaucracy spanning
thousands of worlds, (it\'s everywhere!) *will* get involved. If an item
worth the yearly salary of 1000 of its citizens is stolen, it is a cause
of concern.

It\'s no "carjacking". A car is worth less than a thousandth of a
starship. A car is many orders of magnitude easier to steal than a
starship.

Your assumption is piracy is as common as modern petty larceny, and
therefore the Imperium won\'t notice. My assumption is piracy is
difficult. Therefore when it happens, it is noticed. This is bigger than
grand theft auto. MILLIONs of creds. Big bucks.

At least we agree here. You really have to have guts (or be stupid) to

Cargo manifests are *not* public knowledge. There\'s no way to know which
cargos are going where, on what vessel, and how to identify that vessel,
without covertly obtained information.

Forging records, altering tags, fencing the goods... all of this takes
very specific knowledge from a wide variety of fields.

The vast majority of cargos would be very difficult to resell. The cargo
is intended for a specific market. Who would buy it? Would the paultry
sum received be worth the risk?

My point has been this: "Unorganized" Piracy is incredibly, insanely
difficult!! No, let be me more clear, "Unorganized" Piracy is
impossible! A fool\'s errand.

Lets see... you need covert knowledge of the "mark"\'s manifest, a spy
with intrusion skills, a broker able to know where a cargo could be
sold, equipment and methods able to move cargo from one ship to another
in space, a well armed starship, the ability to crack the encrypted
manifest and lineage, the skills to forge new documents, a willing
buyer...

You gotta be organized. You gotta have the backing of a government,
corporation or crime syndicate. Or you\'re toast. A footnote on the 11
o\'clock news.

It could well be there is a Imperial Navy Office for Piracy Suppression

No, the discount will be closer to 90%. (This has been posted on this
thread in the past) How much money does it cost to travel to the
backwater world? How much money does it cost to feed the groats in the
meantime? Who\'s going to buy 20 tons of groats?

You\'ll probably have to break the lot, and sell it in small parts. (More
travel. more time. time=money. ergo, less money.)

What\'s the average cost of a ton of cargo according to the rules? 10% of
that is how much? Less cost of transport? Less food and supplies for the
ship\'s crew? Less time lost in travel, searching for a buyer? What
exactly is the profit margin? Is that profit worth putting your armed
starship at risk in a battle?

These questions need to be answered before I will believe that cargo
piracy can be profitable. I see no one addressing them. These points
apply to every cargo, not just groats.

If it\'s more profitable for an individual to make a living honestly, (or
dishonestly in easier ways :) ) I don\'t see why there would be piracy.

No, it\'s always an issue when trying to find a buyer. No reputable buyer
would buy a cargo that wasn\'t intended for them (ie exactly what they
ordered, from their supplier), and has the correct documents attached.
They could get in *big* trouble.

This *drastically* reduces the opportunity for a character to fence the
cargo. He\'s got to have connections. It will very difficult to sell
large lots of possibly obscure cargo (that is, cargo intended for a
specific market -- widgets for the production of X-Co\'s Spargle
Munchners)

Another point, maybe a not so important one, that got me thinking, was the
Grandfather decided to take human specimens 300kya, but humans haven\'t
looked like us for more than 40-60kya. At the time, archaic homo sapiens,
with protruding supra orbital ridges, strong jutting jaws, and a hint of
that occipital bun on the back of their skulls would be just coming on the
scene. Unless you could say that Grandfather did some modification beyond
that to correct this little time lapse, there might be some possibilities
in designing a human minor race that still has these characteristics.
Perhaps you could argue parallel evolution for the rest. I don\'t know all
the human minor races that have been described, though, so I don\'t know if
this idea has already been covered.

Had a good week pirating.  Got 20 tons of Antarean Mountain

them for Cr1000/ton on Tureded.  The locals don\'t care where
this stuff comes from; their economy doesn\'t run that hot

I guess I\'d better apply my profits to my ship\'s monthly

should make a fine coat for special occasions.  Gotta work our 
way over to Rech to see that tanner guy.

On the way to the second gas giant, the sensor ops guy 
complained about this "life of crime", but heck, I think it 
beats living on Roup, or even the Regina slums.  Or, for
some of us, an unhappy and violent incarceration on The Gash.

250-1016	Dear Diary,

Offered protection for a free trader inbound to Rech in
exchange for their life support scrubbers.  Good condition...
from a TL 14 port... keeps the smell down a little bit.  
Should be good for a couple months.  At the starport I
dropped off the groatle for processing.

Heard about a little local unrest in Rhise from a tramp

Sure it\'s TL10, but it\'s just a class C starport.  There
might be good stuff there.

WOW!  What incredible luck.  Rhise underwent such a 
revolution like you wouldn\'t believe.  And so sudden, too!
The Equus Patrol dragged their feet getting here -- this
kind of thing is always looming, and there\'ve been so many
false alarms -- and we had a field day.  I\'ll bet the 
Baron Rhise (if there is one) is screaming his head off.
We got a bit of electronics, some TL10 firearms, even a
laser battery.  And of course we helped ourselves to the
fuel tanks.  Got to get those lasers installed somehow...
I know a guy on Cogri who might be able to do it.  I know
he likes dust-spice for his Aslan friends, and I also know
he can\'t afford anagathics.  Now, where can I find a

Re: Prototype specs

Dear Sir.  Above are the specifications for our new secret weapon against
the arachnid enemy, the "Bug-Zapper" Anti-Arachnid Armoured Vehicle.  As
the project inception report states, the "tank", an armoured battlefield
vehicle rendered totally obsolete by the advent of nuke bazookas and the
peaceful Citizen Rule of the Terran Federation, displays great promise
against insect adversaries, which, although big and ugly and really
terrifying, are after all armed only with mandibles and claws (albeit big
ones), and in some cases corrosive sprays.

     The "Bug-Zapper" concept is quite simple.  The "Bug-Zapper" is a
flatbed tracked vehicle, capable of speeds up to 80 km/h (significantly
faster than a Warrior Bug on flat terrain) crewed by a driver and an
electrician, who operates the 2 fission power plants.  15 MI Troopers, with
full armament ride on the back of the vehicle, inside a heavily armoured
cage that affords full visibility both in and out.  They occupy a crew
position hourously designated "Bait" by the boys here in the lab.

	When faced with a typical Bug swarming attack, the driver is to
halt the vehicle immediately, and allow the onrushing arachnid horde to
completely bury the vehicle in a writhing, chittering heap of angry
Warriors.  Once the vehicle is completely buried, the electrician then
throws a switch, sending the full 20 megawatt output of the secondary power
plant through the cage bars and outside of the vehicle, spectacularly
electrocuting the Bugs.  The process is to be repeated as needed until
there are only a few bugs left, at which point the the vehicle\'s armament
(a large insecticide sprayer and a machinegun) and the Bait Troopers\' small
arms will deal with the survivors.

	For the winged Hopper bugs, the vehcile is equipped with a VRF
autocannon with special 00 pellet "Bugshot" rounds, easily capable of
downing chitin-armoured targets at range.  Finally, for the Tanker Bugs and
other larger variants, an anti-armour rocket launcher is provided.

	We predict that rapid deployment of this vehicle will drastically
reduce the number of casualties the MI, without armoured vehicles, indeed
without vehicles of any kind, are currently suffering when deployed against
large armoured creatures with vicious natural armament, while wearing only
flak jackets and helmets.

Laser accuracy is actually nearly perfect for these purposes. Even a TL-8
system can have an accuracy of 4 nanoradians or so, which means an error
circle with area A=(5*10^-9  * R)^2 = 25m2 * (range/1,000,000km)^2, which is
smaller than other error sources - and that\'s for existing TL-8 systems;
i would expect traveller TL error boxes to be a hundred times smaller.

Sensor accuracy - a sensor lock (in my sensor rules) was defined as a positional
measurement good to 5m (so again an error box 25m2 on a size), if I recall
correctly, at maximum lock-on range; it\'ll get better as somewhere between
R^2 and R^6 depending on complicated hard-to-model things. 

Again, at most ranges this is negligible, and evasion dominates.

  Why not just wait and see if you ever get an opportunity safe

Aaaiiieee! Humans are animals, just like the doggies and the kitties and
the winged geckos and the c\'cows! Of course it is problematic to compare
behaviors even among closely related species (like the various
primates). However, sapient species (like humans) are no different than
any other when it comes to this.

	Centripetal acceleration required to follow a circular path is v^2/r, so
the apparent "centrifugal gravity" is v^2/r. A point at distance r and
angular velocity w has an instantaneous linear velocity v=wr. Therefore,
a=w^2 r, or the rotation rate required is (a/r)^0.5.

canon?) and gained access to sex, ofspring and (if the lion
anology holds, though it is not clear if even regarding
Aslan as evolved from lions might not be a mistake) the
prey they catch.  As the race evolves, women remain a
source of resoures (though increasingly in the from of
"wealth" instead of "food").  Thus, it remains
important to not only sleep with women, but also keep
them arond for economic reasons.  Thus I would _guess_
that Aslan would tend to be a bit possesive of their mates.

As the species evolves, females will continue to gain
benefits (protection in child birth, help from the other
women he has, etc.) which will remain as the species
evolve (though they will switch to military/political
benefits).  They thus have about as much to gain from
remaining committed to a male as a human female, though
they are going to be choosier about entering into marraige
than the males since if one finds their mate lacking, males
can marry additional females while the females are committed
to the one male they chose at first.

I see courting as much like human courting in that the
male courts the female, with the difference that the
question of which sex presses for the commitment of
marraige depends more on which see him/herself as
having landed "a good one" rather than it being
more one gender than the other.

Since there seems to be more strive for commitment on
both sides, but Aslan presumably still get some pleasure
from sex which will not be lost on them as they gain
intellegence, I think that you would see premarital
sex, but it would be significantly less common than
among humans....

I don\'t.  "Highly" is too inadequate a word for my opinion of

I\'ve beta-tested 4DOS and Take Command for about a year now, and
I\'ve been a user since version 3.00.  The most recent release is

That depends on your definition of "significant." For humans, it is

in about this time. Evolution seems to be characterized by long periods
of stasis interrupted by short periods of relatively rapid change

The positional idea is interesting, but could be a distraction. 
Positional characters, as far as I know, are mostly useful in script-like 
writing systems where letterforms are joined. Like hindu and arabic.

My thinking on punctuation is that it should be different enough from 
basic letterforms that it is easy to spot and discern.

My explanation of the font is that it\'s a simplification of a more 
complicated writing system that has been applied to Galanglic phonemes to 
transliterate Galanglic into something the Vilani find easy to read. In 
the same way, chinese is transliterated into the Roman alphabet (pinyin).

On TravLang, we\'ve also counted AA, II, and UU as distinct phonemes, 
bringing the total up to 20.

I\'m working on that right now. I\'m shooting for a Nov. 15 release.

My current thinking is to use the symbol currently assigned to \'q\' for 
viani \'kh\' and \'x\' for \'sh\', and modify the current a, i, u symbols for 
vilani aa, ii, and uu phonemes.

This is something we have been working on at TravLang.

I could email you out what I have, if you like.

It\'s exciting that you\'re interested in our work!

I\'d me more than happy to see my font in an upcoming product (as long as 
I get credit, of course! ;) )

I got your point.  You missed mine.  Relative value has a lot of play here.  Yes, we
are talking about 30 - 70 MCr ships.  However, we are discussing them in the
reference of a society where 14-18 MCr ships are common (almost any in-system shuttle
or lauch you care to name), 21 MCr ships are given away (Scouts), and 30 -70 MCr
ships are only viable on the fringe markets of the Imperium.  The real markets use
25,000 dTon ships, and I don\'t even have a price there - easily a factor of 10 to 20
times the target vessels we see here.  Carjacking may not be appropriate - Truck
jacking would be.  Makes a big splash around the truckstop, even hits the news for
the town it occurs in.  Doesn\'t make a ripple outside of that area tho\'.

The Imperium has many, many other things to worry about besides small ship conflicts,
or events happening to traders with no clout.  We have brought out piracy and
dissected it, but let\'s keep some things in perspective.  Ships disappear every day.
Some skip.  Some are retired.  Some are damaged.  Some misjump.  As long as the sound
to noise ratio of piracy is kept below a certain level, there will be no response.

This is where I think we have a basic disagreement.  I think piracy is possible.  I
don\'t think it is common.  I would imagine there are *maybe* 1 or 2 serious pirates
per sector.  (Let me be clear - SECTOR, not subsector)

I never said they were public knowledge.  Just that it is information.  So far as
knowing where... [I\'ve been over this before], let\'s just agree to disagree.  I
obviously allow for more than you do.

forgery, electronics, computer and streetwise - there are no less than 2 characters
(rolled using std. chargen) that have these combination of skills in my current
group.  The individual skills may not be very high - but that is subject to
change...  And I think a merchant character would be familiar with the requirements
to change manifests and cargo containers.

Raw materials I might agree with.  Finished goods, I don\'t.  There is a market for

Sorry, by unorganized I meant \'single ship\'.  Fleets attract attention.  So far as
the skills and the contacts - most scouts and merchants will already know the people,
it\'s just how they use \'em.

Hello,
  Or you\'ve got to be able to take the ship in roughly working
order, and screw the cargo and the "pirates life for me" BS. Get
to where you can sell the ship (i.e., outside the state you\'re in
- - varies by campaign) and retire to a life in the sun.

  For a well-equipped far trader making profits on normal operations,
this could be a very real option for the morality-impaired if they
come across a safe target of opportunity.

  But yes, the "let\'s steal two cargos a month and boy are we happy
that we don\'t understand the statistics of attrition" routine doesn\'t
fly unless the campaign in question is substantially customised to
make it possible.

        Yours truly,

Hello,
  Well, actually the discount will be situational or vary by campaign.
The transit time issue can be largely avoided by dumping the cargo at
your very own little calibration point and coming back as customers
are arranged. Also, a crooked broker (yes, aka "a fence") can handle
the work to avoid humourous attempts at a barter economy.

  Don\'t know. I tried asking on the list recently. No answer. I\'m not
big on cargo piracy, and obviously then turning tinker to sell the
stuff is ludicrous.

>If it\'s more profitable for an individual to make a living honestly, (or
>dishonestly in easier ways :) ) I don\'t see why there would be piracy.

  Agreed. If it is subsidized, it isn\'t independent piracy. I also suspect
that full-time pirates won\'t stop at the cargo, as it\'s not an economically
rational course of action.

  There\'s a sudden lack of _dis_-reputable (or dishonest) buyers? Bad news.

Hello,
  However, having (anti-piracy) intelligence units collating
and distributing material pre-emptively isn\'t commo-time
dependent, nor is determining that a ship design will be hard
pressed to make money legally, although realizing that a given 
ship must be losing money by reported operations is.

  Pardon? Everything that\'s hidden about that design is meant to 
serve the authorities, including the immense network of agents 
and branch offices they have to draw upon.

  Again, ImperialLines is an empire wide mega-corp running off
major trade routes. They _are_ the larger ships in their AO.

  Also, if truly independent traders operate ships this big,
where the heck did the financing come from?

  So the 300 and 400 Dt anti-piracy ships designated by canon are

  Actually, the entire idea of when pirates would be attacking warships
needs to be explored in depth, as it seems to reappear quite often.

Slow and lumbering, the Penguin is a workhorse for low-tech worlds. Hauling
up to 70 tonnes of cargo out of short rutted airstrips in the middle of
nowhere, Penguins are usually held together with baling wire and good
intentions. Limited passenger seating is provided; extra passengers must
travel in the cargo hold.

Designed for coastal defense, the Triumph allocates most of its internal
space to guns and magazines. In normal usage the ship is accompanied by a
fleet coaler to top off its bunkers on a daily basis. Although it has
moderate armour, theTriumph is essentially a floating gun platform intended
to fight in concert with coastal fortifications and lighter screening ships. 

A kitchen provides hot meals for the crew, but little else in the way of
amenities is provided. Being so close to port, the crew needs no recreational
facilities, instead being granted regular shore leave.

Oh, certainly; all I\'ve said is that (in my conception, at least), the most
important factor (although hardly the only one) is aquisition of land.  And
I\'ve also postulated that the Aslan female\'s desire to mate is stronger than
that of the male (I do assume that they both have such a desire).

>Well, human women compete for the attention of males too and are looking
>for the same sort of commitment and, like human women, they have

Yep.  And human women have a sex drive, too.  This is one of the reasons
that I assumed that Aslan females would have one.  It\'d be hard to do a
cross-species comparison, since not only does the biology differ, the culture
differs, too.

>Well, Aslan are aleardy in canon as having multiple wives all of which
>can bear children [...] So that wouldn\'t cut down the birth rate.

I believe that it\'s only the high-SOC Aslan males that have multiple wives 
(basically, those that have enough land and can support the much larger 
family).  The average Aslan male can\'t.  Thus, for rough figuring-out
purposes, I\'ve assumed that approximately a third of the females marry and
have children.

>Forcing women to go unmarried and celebate could work,

Well, the solution that I came up with (and this is what got us started on
this topic) was that Aslan society (and possibly biology) encourages umarried 
females to have female-female sexual relations as a much more emotionally 
fulfilling (and therefore stable and reliable) alternative to celibacy.

>[I]f [Aslan] women only mated with males who controlled the territory they

That\'s about the way I was thinking.  IMHO, for this to work, the males will
need to have less of a sex drive than the females do; this is so that the
male can remain happily celibate until he does attract a female (it seems
to me that all, or almost all, Aslan males eventually marry).  

IF you accept my female-female premise above, then unmarried females have 
other socially acceptable outlets for their sexual needs, and don\'t need
to be able to remain celibate.  They can be happily unmarried and
uncelibate.  It is pretty-well established that there is a significant
fraction of Aslan 
females that don\'t want marriage or children, and do remain unmarried for
their entire lives.

>[Regarding evolution on Lair...]
>>I doubt that there\'s been sufficient time

>There was for humans.  We are not the same species that was taken [...]

Unless I\'m very mistaken, I believe that all of the human races in Traveller
are interfertile (it is well established in the Canon that Vilani and
Solomani are, and by definition that makes all of the humans in Traveller
the same species (Solomani, Vilani, Zhodani, etc.).

Relatively minor variation (such as in number of teeth, number of fingers,
most common hair and skin color, etc) can be explained as being caused by a 
small initial original population that had these traits.

The Vargr have a LOT of subspecies, and at least as much (probably more)
variation between them than between the various Human subspecies.  This was
probably deliberate on the part of the Ancients.  But, AFIK all Vargr are the 
same species (all dogs - regardless of breed and despite wide variations in 
size and appearance - are the same species).

Even a small commercial starship is purchased with a bank loan.  I assume
that means that the ship is insured against loss (a smart bank would require
it).  It\'s also likely that except in the case of the smallest tramp 
freighters, the ship\'s captain or the bank has insurace that covers the cargo 
as well.

This means that if a ship is pirated, either the shipowner, the shipper, the 
bank or the insurance company takes the loss (probably the insurance
company).  
If this sort of thing happens too often, it gets painful (after all, 50MCr 
isn\'t unreasonable for a sub-1000 ton ship; 5 such losses gets to be a
QUARTER 
BILLION credits, and that\'s enough to make anyone have a bad day).

We know that there are Megacorporations that do banking and insurance.  While
a pirate may avoid megacorp-owned ships, is the pirate going to be able to
run 
an insurance check on her target before attacking, to make sure they\'re not 
megacorp financed or insured?

If a megacorp starts loosing money to the tune of billions of credits, (and
we\'re not talking about many incidences for this to happen), you can be sure
that the Archduke will hear about it.  Even if the insurance company is a
small one, they\'ll have to compensate somehow - by raising rates for
everyone else.  And so will all of the other insurance companies in the
area, because there\'s no guarantee that _they_ won\'t be the next ones to
suffer a loss from the pirates.  Now instead of a handful of shipowners 
who\'ve been directly hit, _every_ shipowner in the subsector is upset about 
the piracy.  And you can be sure that Important People will start hearing
about it.

Historical examples abound, but my favorite is US privateers operating off
of England (you\'ve heard of John Paul Jones and the _Bonhomme Richard_,
right?).  The number of merchant ships captured or destroyed wasn\'t really
significant compared to England\'s shipping trade - but it was enough to
cause insurance rates to double temporarily.  And THAT was enough that every 
shipper and every shipowner in England lobbied Parlament to get the Royal
Navy 
to DO SOMETHING about those horrible Colonial pirates.  And this political
pressure was more than enough to get the Royal Navy to devote a significant
and visible fraction of its resources to dealing with a relatively small 
number of relatively weak American ships.

If by "Robinson Crusoe" you refer to an Aslan marooned on a planet
in a wilderness situation, I don\'t agree.  A male would be just as
suited (if not more) than a female for survival in a low-tech,
wilderness survival situation.  The list of female-only skills
does not include any skill that is particularly vital in this
sort of case.

However, if you would refer to an Aslan male who is stranded in a
more technologically demanding situation (i.e. on a ship, or on a
planet whose environment requires technology to survive -- vacuum,
toxic or exotic atmospheres, etc.) then I would tend to agree. Then,
they would either learn quickly and survive (and never, EVER, admit
they know female skill!) or die.

Hello,
  There is a case to be made that existing small warships may as
well be used, especially as patrol work is one of their presumed
major wartime duties.

  OTOH, no reasonable amount of patrolling will prevent either
certain cases or rare circumstances arising in which a target
of opportunity does present itself to an armed moral cripple.

Hello,
  This presupposes that both reconaissance in force and anti-
logistics (both classic cruiser roles) will be non-existent
until such time as the main fleets from a couple subsectors
back arrive?

So even 5-10 billion years later it\'ll still be generating pulses as
strong as a "new" pulsar (like the one in the Crab Nebula)?

How about the appearance?

Basicly, I need info on what a neutron star formed *early* in the
"first generation" of stars would be like now. Stuff like surface temp
(or spectral curve, if it is likely to be really different than black
body). 

If my idea is workable, it will have planets. So I need to be able to
figure surface conditions on them, as well as conditions in space.

BTW, would you happen to have estimated masses and orbital periods for
the pulsar planets that\'ve been discovered so far? 

My main problemm is that if I can use the pulsar the way I want to, it
has to *not* be "announcing" its presence unless you are looking hard.
So if observatories sectors away will have plotted it, the idea won\'t
work. (Though I have a backup plan for this).

Flattering - but use it unattributed, please. I wouldn\'t want even a chance

The film really does have a disturbing problem. I came out of _Starship

unabashed ultra-militaristic right-wing commercial, cheerfully admitting,
"Sure, it\'s fascist propaganda. You got a problem with that?!"

I can\'t help being reminded of the kid in Rick Veitch\'s satirical comic
"The Brat Pack" (if you happen to have read that), the mindless high school
kid who likes to look at books on the Nazis - not because he\'s interested
in knowing anything about history, but because he thinks the uniforms and
symbols and stuff look "cool".

Verhoeven\'s approach to making _Starship Troopers_ seems to have been: "If
it looks cool, use it - even if it\'s insultingly daft." Or if it\'s morally
questionable, for that matter.

suppression (Was: Piracy -- the new era!)...

Not a rant, just a few points, worth discussing since they are, at least, on
a slightly different aspect of the Piracy debate:

>Cargo manifests are *not* public knowledge. There\'s no way to know which
>cargos are going where, on what vessel, and how to identify that vessel,
>without covertly obtained information.

Given what goes on nowadays on Terra, and the ease with which one can
acquire equivalent information, legally or illegally, I think that\'s a
pretty bold statement to make!

IMHO, on med/high tech worlds, the entire manifest may not be stored in one
location in the starport computers, but all the transactions, from broker
purchase records through to customs records will be available through one
source or another, legal or illegal. It wouldn\'t require much work to gain a
full description of the manifest - even if the computers are fairly secure,
there are hundreds of starport officials (from cargo handlers to customs
officials) who can give the information away, either in a casual reference,
or if bribed to do so.

>Forging records, altering tags, fencing the goods... all of this takes
>very specific knowledge from a wide variety of fields.

In much the same way that fraudulent use of stolen mobile phones and/or
their identities, requires specific knowledge but is commonplace today?

>My point has been this: "Unorganized" Piracy is incredibly, insanely
>difficult!! No, let be me more clear, "Unorganized" Piracy is
>impossible! A fool\'s errand.

Which probably means that any pirates that have survived for more than a few
weeks are exceptionally intelligent, organised, and have all the skills (and
mentality) of a typical Traveller adventuring group (or they\'re Vargr). Now
obviously adventurers are supposed to be a rare breed, but that doesn\'t mean
there aren\'t any such pirates about...

>Lets see... you need covert knowledge of the "mark"\'s manifest...
Which I pointed out wouldn\'t need much work to obtain if the world\'s law
level is, say 7 or less.

>a spy with intrusion skills...
I think I missed why this was necessary, but I\'ll assume you mean to steal
cargo details, so computer hacking, bribery or similar might be appropriate.
Certainly knowledge of breaking into cargos isn\'t rare nowadays (any more
than breaking into cars is a particularly \'specialist\' field)

>a broker able to know where a cargo could be sold...
Just the sort of skills that an ex-merchant, turned pirate would have
anyway, or could easily recruit at any starport if he paid well enough.

>equipment and methods able to move cargo from one ship to another in space...
Certainly specialist equipment, but I assume something of this sort would be
required on many cargo ships, for loading/unloading at orbital starports and
for shuttle/main ship transfers, which would mean the equipment and
necessary skills would be available within the merchant community.

>a well armed starship...
The costs of space combat have already been widely discussed. Recognising
the relative costs of repairs, my Traveller players would think carefully
about going into a fight, even against a smaller ship, where there was
significant chance of being damaged. So if they were the pirates, they would
be cautious. If they were the trader being attacked, then they might well
hand over their cargo rather than have their ship damaged - it\'s an
interesting compromise as to which position is stronger.

>the ability to crack the encrypted manifest and lineage...
As noted above, hackers will probably be as common (if not more so) in the
Imperium than in our current Terran society. Also, as noted, there are
alternative methods of gaining the information.

>the skills to forge new documents...
Also not an uncommon skill among characters.

>a willing buyer...
There is almost *always* a buyer, and the lower the value of the goods, the
easier it is usually to dispose of them. So that cargo of 20 tons of Groats
will probably sell better than, say, the equivalent of the Mona Lisa - you
wouldn\'t dream of stealing the latter unless you already had the buyer set
up, in which case you know precisely what your profit margin is.

>You gotta be organized...
Agreed. Very organised, with a slick crew who work fast as a team (that
rules out most adventurers! :-) )

>You gotta have the backing of a government, corporation or crime syndicate.
The former is the Vargr position; the corps have their own privateering, but
this would tend to be knocking out competitors rather than just stealing
their cargos; the latter is a good way to ensure you have all the necessary
skills noted by Glenn above.

>You\'ll probably have to break the lot, and sell it in small parts. (More
>travel. more time. time=money. ergo, less money.)

Nope. You accumulate goods at your pirate base (i.e. depot) until you can
farm them out, in bulk, to selected buyers. This allows you to keep stuff
until the heat has died down, gives you time to select the best buyer, is
probably required time to allow forging of the paperwork, etc.

>What\'s the average cost of a ton of cargo according to the rules? 10% of
>that is how much? Less cost of transport? Less food and supplies for the
>ship\'s crew? Less time lost in travel, searching for a buyer? What
>exactly is the profit margin? Is that profit worth putting your armed
>starship at risk in a battle?

The profit margin might at first appear doubtful on most cargos, but then as
noted above, the only surviving non-corporate pirates in the Imperium are
going to have to be damned good at their job; they will *have* to know
exactly what cargos to take, and which ships not to touch (e.g. because
they\'re more heavily armed than they appear).

Going back to the profit margin, I think it\'s important to note that your
Cr1,000 or Cr4,000 per ton shipping cost might be only a tiny fraction of
the actual *value* of the cargo if bought or sold outright. Looking back to
the Classic Traveller cargo list (or using the rules in the BITS product 101
Cargos) you can see that a mere 1% cut of some shipments would still make a
healthy profit for the pirate. By definition, the shipment wouldn\'t be going
in the starship at such a high cost, if it wasn\'t actually worth
considerably more when sold at the other end of its journey; that sale price
has to include a cut for the retailer, the shipment costs, all customs and
taxes, the original production and packaging costs, etc., so any starship
shipment must be worth at least twice the standard freight cost to make it
worthwhile shipping...

>If it\'s more profitable for an individual to make a living honestly, (or
>dishonestly in easier ways :) ) I don\'t see why there would be piracy.

Again, I\'d cite real life as an example. Taking purely those people I know
personally (so as not to offend anyone by appearing to make
generalisations), there are plenty of people who do dangerous or illegal
things for the \'hell of it\', because they were brought up that way, because
they get a buzz out of it, or because they just hate the idea of making
their living by doing a \'proper\' job. There will be plenty of such people
available in a Traveller universe, who won\'t bother to sit down with an
accountant and a calculator to do all the sums before turning to illicit
work (of which piracy is only one example).

>No, it\'s always an issue when trying to find a buyer. No reputable buyer
>would buy a cargo that wasn\'t intended for them (ie exactly what they

>They could get in *big* trouble.

Again, in today\'s world, fencing of stolen goods (even where it\'s absolutely
bloody obvious they\'re stolen) is commonplace. Scams involving buying goods,
selling them fast and then disappearing before you have to pay the invoices
from the original suppliers is just another example.

In summary, you have to be a bright bunch to be *successful* pirates, but
that doesn\'t prevent others from trying their hand at the game. No doubt the
majority of piracy \'random encounters\' mentioned in the Traveller rules
apply to the latter situation - the PCs might just be unlucky to encounter
such an incompetent pirate group in the one or two attacks they make before
being hit by the INFDTKFSOSOOIP (Imperial Naval Forces Dedicated To Kicking
Five Sorts Of **** Out Of Incompetent Pirates). :-)

P.S. It\'s worth remembering that in my games I play the 100 diameter limit
from Mr. Sun, and this often far exceeds the distance to Mr. Inhabitable

Mr. System Patrol close at hand at spoil one\'s fun.

I originally used NDOS, then switched to 4DOS because NDOS and Windows
95 did not get along.

I NEED my aliases when I am in DOS, so I decided to try out 4DOS 3.xx. 
I recently grabbed 6.55(?) about 3 months ago.  I have Take Commadn
installed as well, although I hardly use it for anything with 4DOS
installed.  

The only reason I\'ll use Take Command is that it has that handy screen
buffer.  Too bad that feature isn\'t supported in DOS shell.

My agenda is not to eliminate the possibility of piracy.

I just don\'t believe it will be at all common (about as common as large 
bank heists). And I don\'t believe that an independant pirate will be very 
successful, again about as successful as there are successful large bank 
heists. The successful ones will become very famous, much like that 
British Great Train Robber fella currently living in Brazil.

They will also be keen on not encouraging this sort of crime, which can 
get real expensive real fast. I hate the way it\'s always compared to car 
robbery or the like. It\'s *not* the same.

That point has been argued a lot. We disagree on it. I don\'t believe 1% 
is needed. The reason why we don\'t divert that much to preventing bank 
robbery, is because that much isn\'t needed! It\'s inherently risky and 
difficult to rob a bank of a large amount of cash without getting caught.

It takes a very small amout of prevention by using resources already "out 
there", without diverting a whack of cash. But, you disagree that every 
system with trade and/or a starport will have patrols of small vessels 
for military reasons so there\'s no point in arguing on this further.

Ah, but it *is* more difficult! Most modern fences deal in consumer 
products the public wants, in a local area. The sheer vastness of the 
Imperium means that there are several times as many markets. And many 
cargos aren\'t easy-to-sell consumer items, but specialized 
pharmaceuticals, information, raw materials, custom manufactured items...

Smugglers *know* what their buyer wants, and try to procure it. A pirate 
has to have foreknowledge of what its target is carrying, as well as 
knowledge of what its contacts want to sell. That foreknowledge is very 
difficult to come by...

Why wouldn\'t the Imperium use the latest technology to track the trade of 
goods, especially with the information and travel barriers inherent in 
interstellar travel? Even now, on earth, cargo manifests are very 
specific for goods crossing borders. You have to know where the stuff 
comes from, and what route it took.

What if there were an infestation of rabbits on Rhylanor? A bad batch of 
pharmaceuticals? Defective grapple-grommits? How do you find out where it 
came from? We\'re talking trade between _worlds_ here. Self contained 
ecosystems. It\'s imperative to trace the transfer of goods!

Look -- I\'m not one of those who says that piracy *cannot* exist. I just 
believe that it is very risky, and nearly impossible to be profitable for 
the lone individual without outside support. If the average smuggler 
decides to take up piracy, he will find himself out of business quite 
quickly...

Maybe, tho\' I kibbitzed for a year or so 1995-96 for DGP\'s new RPGs, 
and hence I\'m not holding my breath.  (I also expect records of my 
contribution to have been lost in the mists of time... sigh.)

OTOH, I\'m not keen on firms rushing out a defective product.  If I 
see a DGP game, I\'ll look at it with mild interest.

You mean like the ones about "Look! Grooming behavior!" (old Anthro
joke :-)

Seriously, folks who *are* familair with non-human primate behavior
*do* make jokes about some of our "cultural" behavior that looks to
match up.  So aliens will too.

If I remembered more of the anthro stuff, or knew someone studying it,
I\'d come up with some jokes for the list.

Not sure. I live in an apartment. Back when I last lived in a house, my
collection included an IBM 2311 disk drive. That\'s a HD for an IBM 360.
Cabinet the size of a washing machine, 14 "cake tin" removable media,
runs on 220 3-phase (actually an individual drive only uses one phase),
*hydraulic* head actuators. Mine went into service in 1965.

I still have two disk packs. I also have a core memory plane (128bytes
of RAM!).

The stuff that works is a bunch of TRS-60 gear, a 1977 vintage 8080
system, a 6800 system, a bunch of PC clones (and even some *real* IBM
PCs), an Apple clone, and the Mac.

This requires that a would-be pirate can routinely do legitimate business
at a starport without giving the authorities enough information to
identify him and track him down after the event. Do you really think
that is a reasonable assumption?
 
(Oh, and stealing a starship requires that you can disguise it or its
component parts enough that it/they can\'t be identified later. Another
very iffy assumption, IMO.

	Actually, the females in the marriage might be the more closely
bonded ones, with the male kept around for social advantages ("our male is
bigger/meaner than yours"), dealing with other annoying bunches of females
("their male just marked a tree ON YOUR LAND!  YOUR HONOUR IS AT STAKE!
AGRESS!  AGRESS!  AGRESS!  Wait!  Come back!  They\'re over that way!  Good
luck!  <aside>  That\'ll teach those no-good [cattiness deleted]"), and
producing more females so that the clan\'s business interests can be
adequately staffed.

	The more I think about it, the more I think Aslan society is almost
like Victorian society; one gender runs everything, with the other gender
strictly limited to specific roles (reproduction, cooking, and being
displayed on one\'s arm at social events) and, although put on a pedestal
and \'revered\', are more or less kept out of it.

	Yup, I think that the Aslans are a matriarchy.  A pretty
passive-aggressive one, but a full-blown females-run-everything and the
males are just kept around as political figureheads, guard dogs, and
reproductive assets.

	In fact, the female/male ratio might be due to social engineering
on the part of the females!  After all, male Aslan are not good things to
have around if they\'re trying to build a civilization...  so by whatever
means, they have just enough males to keep things going and meet military
requirements, while raising three times as many of the productive and
intelligent females.

Agreed. That a pirate would often be able to get copies of cargo manifests

I think a reasonable assumption would be that a pirate would know where
to sell a stolen cargo, but that he would not usually get more than the
percentage robbers commonly get today (10-20% if the crime authors I\'ve
read are right).

Keep in mind that a 600 T armed ship will need to earn about 8 million
credits per year to keep in the black. Every additional jump the ship
has to make in order to fence the stuff costs it another 320,000 Cr.
(Not all in actual expenses; some of it in lost revenue).

That\'s the big problem right there. Let\'s say the pirate lurks about in a
big starport waiting for the right cargo to come along. Let\'s ignore the
risk that the authorities will notice that he is idling about and start
wondering why he is wasting his time doing nothing. First off, we have
the loss of revenue from sitting idle until he marks the perfect victim.
Can we agree that attacking the prospective victim on its way out is a
bad idea? If its a big starport then the world will have defenses; and
if the victim is outside the 10 diameter limit, then it has the option
of jumping to avoid capture -- something that you certainly can\'t be SURE
he won\'t do. So you jump to the destination system. Now, I\'m going to
assume that there is a minimum of one patrol vessel in the target system.
Even if you disagree with permanent patrols, canonically there are patrols
jumping back and forth to the backwater systems. Certainly the pirate 
cannot assume that there won\'t be a patrol in the system when he arrives.
OK, if you get your information sufficiently far in advance and know the
victim\'s schedule you have the option of jumping before him and be
absolutely certain that you get there ahead of him. Since the margin of
error for jumps, timewise, is about a day each way, you risk arriving
four days ahead of your victim (your jump took 6 days and his took 8).
You now have the option of remaining at the jump limit for up to 4 days,
which gives the patrol both the time and the incentive to check you out,
or going down to the starport, which involves the risk of a thorough
check by the starport authorities. I\'ll accept that you can fool such
an inspection, but do you really think the authorities won\'t get enough
information about your ship to identify it later?

The alternative is to aim to hit the target system at the same time as the
victim. That means your risk getting there any time from 2 days early till
2 days late. The odds that you will arrive silmutaneously are not good.

But say that you do arrive at roughly the same time as your victim. Either
there will be a patrol vessel stationed a some specific spot at the 100
diameter limit, in which case your victim will aim for that spot and you
will have to perform your piracy under the guns of the patrol; or there
will not be such a picket, in which case you have to guess at what part
of the 100 diameter limit \'shell\' that your victim aimed for (something
that you _won\'t_ be able to get beforehand, since a ship carrying an
extra valuable cargo will be careful not to compute that until they are
approaching the jump limit). If your victim arrives at some distance from
you, the captain (knowing what a valuable cargo he is carrying) will have
ample time to request an escort from the patrol vessel in orbit around the
world.

This is something I\'ve tried to get the pro-pirate side to address
several times. A DETAILED description of a workable _modus operandi_ for
the succesful pirate that allows him to make a living. So far all I\'ve
seen are very general statements about attacking targets of opportunity,
something that requires either that targets of opportunity appear often
enough that a pirate can make a living capturing them or that the pirate
can make a living in between looking for targets of opportunity. As far
as I can judge, neither assumption is warranted.

But I\'m ready to be convinced if you can come up with something a bit
more well-founded than \'Can too!\'.

BTW. all the above assumes that the cargo is not sufficiently valuable that
your victim (or your victim\'s insurance agent) hires an escort (and that
the cargo\'s owner dosen\'t send it by a better armed ship).

Not really. It gives Mr. Pirate the problem of catching Mr. Victim before
he gets more than 10 diameters from the planet, when Mr. Pirate has to come
in several 100 diameters from the planet. (As mentioned above, pursuing Mr.
Victim from the starport involves staying at the starport for a time, 
which involves the authorities having the ship equivalent of your
fingerprints (and they propably have your fingerprints too). This is
not conductive to living long and prospering as a pirate.)

Truck jacking would only be appropiate if truck could teleport from just
outside one city limit to just outside the destination city limit.

But that was btw. What I really wanted to ask was don\'t you think that IF
the argument of relative value is valid, then it ought to apply to both
sides of the situation? If relative values apply don\'t it apply to the
cost of anti-pirate activity too?

I\'ve seen this claim before, and I\'ve asked for a few examples of those
many, many other things the Imperium -- no, sorry, I mean the Imperial
Navy specifically -- has to worry about besides piracy. What does the
Imperial Navy do in peacetime that dosen\'t leave them enough assets left
over to do what the Royal Navy found considerable assets to do while
_even_ while involved in a vicious life-and-death struggle with France?

I would think that that would insure that piracy recieved a disproportional

No lack of disreputable buyers. But there will be a dearth of dishonest
buyers willing to pay top credit for goods of dubious origin.

That is partly because you have a law forbidding your military from
performing law enforcement and partly because of what we in Denmark
call "account thinking" -- the people who could do something don\'t
do it because it is not what their money is allocated to them to do.
It is \'somebody else\'s problem\'.

But you do use some percentage of your military budget on trying to
prevent smuggling and piracy (your Coast Guard). It\'s just so much
more difficult to patrol the coast of the US with ships than it is
to patrol planets with starships in Traveller.

This is a typical move of Rogers. By binding people to silence he instils
an air amongs his kibbitzers that they are on to something special. It
restricts the amount of public discussion and provides an excellent cover
for his continued lack of production.

Nothing would please me more. I\'d really like to see some of the stuff done
by the _real_ DGP back and available. I\'ve promised to buy anything and
everything Roger produces as penitence for my lack of faith. IF he ever
produces ANYTHING.

However the way you hint at great things just around the corner is also
pure Roger and I\'ve heard to for many, many years now. If I were a betting
man, the odds on Roger ever doing ANYTHING are so long as to be
inconsequential.

Besides, why do you need to defend him? You admit you are out of the loop.
Where is Roger himself? Why doesn\'t HE post to the list?

As a long string of 5s is as likely as the same length of any other
sequence of digits and that the location in the decimal progression is as
likeley as any other you cannot say anything about probable/improbable
there. Also note that as the decimal progression of any irrational
(rational as well for that matter) number is infinite any given place in
the progression will have to be close to the beginning (infinitely close to
the start).

All irrational numbers share the behaviour of having arbitrary sequences of
digits showing up.

Indeed. And that reduces the number of potential victims for a pirate.

And neither does the Imperial Navy "blow" any amount of their resources by
using their ships. They get a certain amount of money each year. If the
setup is anything like the institutions here in Denmark, any part of
their budget that they don\'t use is simply lost (and their next year\'s
budget propably cut). I\'ve been told that things are the same way in the
USA. And any other bureaucracy that I\'ve ever heard of.

>The US military cares very much if congress were to cut their budget 1%.

Sure would. So what do they do about it? Use less money than their budget
allows? In Denmark the army has a tendency to do a _lot_ of driving
around with their tanks and trucks in december. The reason? They have to
use up all their gasoline (or do I mean petrol?) before New Year\'s Day.

Let me quote from about 20 lines above in your very same posting:

"Yeah, but it is, in fact, reasonable that pirates will concentrate on
taking cargoes (less determined oppostion, etc. this has been debated
>and look at the list archive for discussion)."

If you can see a difference between that statement and to take something
that we both know we disagree on, and have beaten into the ground several
times already, and baldly assert them to be true in a reply to posts on
another point, then you are a far more subtle man than I am.

>Well, we both have numerical analysis.  The point as you note,
>are his assumptions and mine are different.

But not the whole point. As a matter of fact, there are several different
kinds of disagreements, and you keep mixing them up. There is the basic
difference of opinion, where both opinions are reasonable. That is the
kind you talk about all the time, but precious few of our disagreements
are of that kind, and I try to avoid responding to those, except when
you fail to make clear that whatever bald statement you present as true
is actually based on a particular set of assumptions. I won\'t claim that
I have never inadvertently responded to something like that, but I try
not to. The other kind are the disagreements when one opinion is very
much more unlikely than the other or, worse yet, is inconsistent or
self-referential. Those are the kind that really sets me off, and if
you keep posting them, I\'ll propably keep responding to them.

>>Both of your respond whenever this thread comes up, each hoping to win by
>>exhaustion

Not in my case. I have long ago given up trying to convince David, and I
wouldn\'t consider it a victory if he stopped posting from sheer exhaustion.
(Now, if I could actually convince him...) It just bugs the hell out of me
when he baldly states a contested opinion as an uncontested truth. There\'s
always the chance that some unfortunate neophyte will believe him... ;-)

And I note that I\'m not the only one that still responds to David. I\'ve
been unable to keep up with my e-mail, but I note that most of his most
recent batch of assertations have been dealt with by others. How many
of you believes that your reply will convince David?

>Wrong.  This particular message resulted from Hans jumping
>in on a reply that was wrapping up a discussion with someone
>other than Hans and bringing up old points.  Now you
>have jumped into my reply to Hans. 

"Jumping in". Now there\'s a value-loaded expression if ever I saw one.
All I can say is that if someone posts to the list, then I consider the
post aimed just as much at me as at any other reciepient of the net. If
you want private discussions I suggest that private e-mail would be
more appropiate. If you keep posting things I disagree strongly with
to the list, then I will propably resond, and I don\'t feel the least
bit guilty about it.

"Jumping in", indeed!! Hmpff!

>>See if the other parties, like me, in this debate do the same, once the two
>>of you stop.

From the amount of other people still posting on the subject it appears that
there is still some meat on the bone. My time is running out, but next week
I\'ll have a few CT descriptions of various patrol ships that I\'ve designed
to figure out just what a good patrol ship could do and would cost. They
may be of use to others.

On most of the subjects that you and I have beaten to death, you have
posted an initial statement with which I have disagreed. I have responded
with an objection to which you have responded with what I regard as an
equally flawed reply. Eventually you have come to a point where you have
either ignored a posting or claimed that it boiled down to a mere
difference of opinion, something that I usually don\'t agree with you
about. That isn\'t resolving the question and it certainly dosen\'t entitle
you to repost your original statement as if it was a fact without getting
jumped on again, to use your charming terminology.

>>If you are having fun with it, then by all means go ahead and continue - I
>>certainly am not the list cop

Well, every so often something new does occur. For instance, the point that
the Imperial Navy would have an interest over and above just doing their
duty in using anti-piracy patrols to boost their budget hadn\'t occurred to
me before.
 
>They why are you jumping into an exchange between Hans and
>me and lecturing me on how to post?

At a guess, because he disagreed with something you baldly asserted as true.
 
BTW. in the interest of not escalating this thing out of control, I have
refrained from providing concreted examples of things you regard as
adequately dealt with and I regard as still unresolved, but if you
require me to, I will be happy to supply a few, either public or by
e-mail. I\'m perfectly willing to back up anything I\'ve baldly asserted as
the truth in this posting.

Or you can just go on as before and I will point them out as you bring them
up yet again... ;-)
